This study confirmed the prevalence of the male-taller and the male-not-too-tall norms in Taiwan.\nThe frequency of the height difference between a husband and wife within the range of 5\u00ad15 cm was higher than what would be\nexpected by chance. This range in Taiwan was smaller than the range in the United Kingdom, which may imply that there are\npreferred height differences between couples that vary across populations.\n",

This rule has been called the ``male-taller'' norm\n(Gillis & Avis, 1980), and women are more likely to comply\nwith the male-taller norm than men (Stulp, Buunk, & Pollet,\n2013). In studies on personal advertisements, Pawlowski and\nrate or hit rate for tall males was greater, but for tall females, it\nwas lower. In personal advertisements, females usually seek a\ntaller partner (Koestner & Wheller, 1988). Shepperd and\nStrathman (1989) reported that females rated taller males as\nbeing more attractive. Taller males had also dated more fre-\nquently than their counterparts. In the marriage market, a\nmale's height is valued by females.\nMale physical contests for mates are rare in modern societ-\nies. Yet, male height still matters in female mate selection. Two\npossible reasons explain why modern women prefer tall men.\nFirst, as evolutionary psychology suggests, modern female\nheight preferences might be inherited from our ancestors\nmales are perceived to be more attractive. Secondly, studies\nhave shown that male height is positively associated with edu-\ncational attainment (Cinnirella, Piopiunik, & Winter, 2011;\nMagnusson, Rasmussen, & Gyllensten, 2006; Meyer & Selmer,\n\u00a8ckerman & Vainioma\nBuunk, Verhulst, & Pollet, 2013), and status (Case & Paxson,\nzanowska\n& Mascie-Taylor, 2011; Silventoinen, Lahelma, Lundberg, &\nRahkonen, 2001). Specifically, for the first explanation, evolu-\ntionary psychology argues that women are born with the per-\nception that tall men are more attractive than short men. The\nsecond explanation indicates that men's height is positively\ncorrelated with resource access.\nThe male-taller norm is not universally true, in particular not\nin some indigenous populations that have been isolated from\nmodernization. On the one hand, Sear and Marlowe (2009)\nfound that mate selection for actual couples is random with\nrespect to height in the Hadza, a hunter-gatherer population\nliving in Tanzania. Sorokowski and Sorokowska (2012)\nreached the same conclusion with regard to Yali populations,\n1 Department of Economics, Soochow University, Taipei, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nHung-Lin Tao, Department of Economics, Soochow University, 56, Kuei-Yang\nEmail: hltao@scu.edu.tw\nEvolutionary Psychology\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nevp.sagepub.com\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 License\n(http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and distribution of the work without further\npermission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access pages (https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/open-access-at-sage).\na traditional ethnic group living in the mountains of Papua,\nIndonesia. Sorokowski and Butovskaya found that both sexes\nin Datoga, a tribe living in Tanzania, prefer their partners to be\neither much taller or much shorter than themselves. The mate\nselection in these populations violates the male-taller norm. On\nthe other hand, Sorokowski et al. (2015) did find the male-taller\npreference in some indigenous populations, such as the Hadza\nand the Tsiman\u00b4\ne. The Tsiman\u00b4\ne are a native Amazonian society\nof farmer foragers in the area of Beni in northern Bolivia, while\nthe Hadza were also investigated by Sear and Marlowe (2009)\nas mentioned above. Becker, Touraille, Froment, Heyer, and\nCourtiol (2012) found that the male-taller norm even prevailed\nin Baka pygmies in central Cameroon.\nFurthermore, although the male-taller norm prevails in\nWestern countries, people prefer the height difference between\na husband and wife to be within a certain range (Courtiol,\nNettle, & Verhulst, 2013; Stulp, Mills, Pollet, & Barrett,\n``male-not-too-tall'' norm. Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, Nettle, and\nVerhulst (2013) was the first to indicate that the most frequent\nrange of height difference was within 25 cm in the United\nKingdom. If the two explanations aforementioned can fully\nsupport the male-taller norm, then short women look for the\nsame tall men as tall women do. But this is not what we\nobserved. The incomplete explanation of evolutionary psychol-\nogy and resource access hypotheses on assortative mating with\nrespect to height implies more hypotheses are needed.\nRecently, in addition to the two possible explanations for the\nmale-taller norm, researchers (Salska et al., 2008; Swami et al.,\nble explanation, a socialization explanation, for the male-taller\nnorm. They argued that the male-taller norm is a reflection of\nsex-role ideology or sex stereotype because height amounts to\ndominance. Although the sex-role explanation can be partially\ncovered by the first two explanations, Yancey and Emerson\n(2016) showed that height preference for a mate should not\nviolate societal expectation. Respondents clearly specified that\na great height difference is awkward or weird even though the\nmale-taller norm was met. In other words, when people look for\na mate, they prefer a male taller than his coupled female but not\ntoo tall.\nThe purpose of this study was to use Taiwanese data to\nverify the assortative mating with respect to height: the male-\ntaller and male-not-too-tall norms in Taiwan. This study con-\ntributes to the literature on assortative mating with respect to\nheight in three ways. First, most of the existing evidence of the\nassortative mating with respect to height are from Western\npopulations (Krzy_\nzanowska, Mascie-Taylor, & Thalabard,\ndence from Eastern population. Second, the conclusions of the\nassortative mating with respect to height are usually challenged\nby the possibility that the observed assortative mating with\nrespect to height is due to characteristics other than height,\nsay education (Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, et al., 2013). This study\nemployed an ordered probit model to verify the male-taller and\nthe male-not-too-tall norm, while controlling for other charac-\nterisitcs. Third, using a sample from the United Kingdom,\nStulp, Buunk, Pollet, et al. (2013) found that couples where\nthe male partner was taller than the female partner within 25 cm\noccurred at a higher frequency in actual couples than that\nexpected by chance. If the male-not-too-tall norm does prevail\nin a society, the most frequent height difference between a\ncouple observed might vary with societies. It would be inter-\nesting to see whether the most frequent height difference\nbetween a couple will change for Eastern population, and what\nthe implications are if such difference is observed.\nMaterial and Method\nSample\nThe data were from the Elementary School Children's Nutri-\nfinancially supported by the Ministry of Health and Welfare\npose of this survey was to investigate elementary students'\nnutrition and health status. This survey also asked students'\nparents to report their heights. To date in Taiwan, this is a rare\ndata set simultaneously documenting the wife's and the hus-\nband's height. The ESCNHS is unique for the purpose of this\nstudy. In all, 3,069 students were drawn by stratified random\nsampling from the whole nation, and 2,419 students and their\nfamilies completed the questionnaire. After deleting single par-\nent and observations without height, age, educational attain-\nment, and family income, 1,344 observations remained for\nhusband and wife samples. This is the studied sample.\nThe ESCNHS separatively asked a child's father and\nmother their family income: ``Taking all income sources into\naccount, on average, how much is your monthly family\nincome?'' The answer is categorized to (1) less than 10,000,\nuncertain income, and (18) no income. The other categories\nare ``don't know'' and ``refused to answer.'' The middle val-\nues from Categories (2) to (15) are used to be their family\nincome. The income proxy for Categories (1) and (16) are\namount of income is 0 for uncertain income and no income.\nIf only one spouse reported that the family has income, then\nthis reported income is used as the family income. When both\nfather and mother reported their family income, their average\nvalue is taken as their family income.\nEducational attainment is recorded in 21 educational cate-\ngories in the questionnaire. These educational categories are\ntransferred into 11 categories in terms of educational years. For\nexample, diploma of senior high school, vocational senior high\nschool, and army academy senior high school all indicate\n9 years of education. The questionnaire contains 7 levels of\neducational attainment: no education, elementary school,\njunior high school, senior high school, junior college, college,\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nand postgraduate school. The 21 educational categories inclu-\ndefive other categories that do not finish the middle five edu-\ncational levels, for example, some years in elementary school.\nIn these cases, respondents who reported studying for some\nyears in certain educational level are assumed finishing half\nof the number of educational years. As some years in college\nand graduates of junior college have the same number of edu-\ncational years, these two categories have the same number of\neducational years. Consequently, there are 11 categories in\nterms of educational years. In addition to height, Table 1 pre-\nsents that average family income and its standard deviation of\nlars. Husbands' and wives' average educational years are 11.7\nand 11.2 years, respectively. Their respective standard devia-\ntions are 2.86 and 2.71. On average, husbands are older than\ntheir wives by about 3 years. The average ages for husbands\nand wives are, respectively, 40.3 and 37.4, and their standard\ndeviations are 4.83 and 4.64, respectively. The average age of\ntheir children is 8.45, and its standard deviation is 1.70 (not\nshown in Table 1).\nMethod\nRandom Simulation\nGiven the distributions of male and female heights in this sam-\nple, this study conducted a random match of men and women.\nA random simulation was repeatedly run 200 times. A random\nvalue X was drawn and was assigned to each husband. In the\nhusbands were then resorted according to the magnitude of the\ndrawn random value, and a new set of random matches was\nobtained. Recall that parents in this sample had children of a\nsimilar age meaning that all males and females in this sample\ncan be recoupled in terms of their own ages. In other words, the\nrandom simulation will not generate a couple where the hus-\nOrdered Probit Model\nA woman of a certain height group might be more likely to be\nmarried to a man of a certain height group, say 5\u00ad15 cm taller\nthan themselves. An ordered probit model is appropriate for\nthis study's purpose. The dependent variable of an ordered\nprobit model is an ordinal and discrete variable. A continuous\nheight variable can be classified into several categories, as in\nTable 1. An ordered probit model cannot be successfully con-\nducted when any category of the dependent variable contains a\nfew observations. Because only a small number of husbands\nwere shorter than or equal to 155 cm, the model specifies\nhusbands shorter than or equal to 160 cm as one category.\nSimilarly, wives taller than 170 cm were rare; this category\nrespectively five height categories for husband's height and\nwife's height as each model's dependent variable. As spouse\nheight was the explanatory variable, it was classified into five\ncategories. Through this classification, the study could exam-\nine which wife height category was more likely to be matched\nwith which husband height category.\nThe basic model was\ny\u00c3 \u00bc x \u00fe e; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere y* is a latent variable, x is a matrix of independent\nvariables,  is the coefficient vector, and e is the random error\nTable 1.

Height was\ndivided into five groups, and each group was assigned a new\ndiscrete value y.

The total probability cannot change.\nResults\nAssortative Mating\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics by height. The two panels\ndisplay the relationships between the height of male and female\nspouses, between one's height and family income, their educa-\ntional years, and their ages. Table 1 demonstrates that hus-\nband's height and wife's height were positively associated.\nThe correlation coefficient between the height of spouses is\n.23 (p < .01). Table 1 also exhibits that relative height is posi-\ntively correlated with husband's height (r \u00bc .61; p < .01) and\nnegatively correlated with wife's height (r \u00bc \u00c0.63; p < .01).\nHusband's height is positively correlated with family income\n(r \u00bc .22; p < .01) and with their educational years (r \u00bc .24;\np < .01). Likewise, wife's height is positively correlated with\nfamily income (r \u00bc .15; p < .01) and with their educational\nyears (r \u00bc .14; p < .01). Simple linear regression coefficients\nhave similar meanings as correlation coefficients. The height\nregression was conducted (not shown), and the height squared\nof spouse was also included in the regression model, but both\nspouse's height and its square were nonsignificant.\nAlthough in general, taller wives had higher family incomes\nand educational attainment, wives in the tallest group did not\nhave the highest family income and the highest eduational\nattainment. Men's height was more strongly associated with\ntheir achievement. The correlation coefficients between height\nand education and between height and family income for men\nwere stronger than those for women, and the differences were\nsignificant. The Fisher's Z transformation tests were 1.762 (one\nlatter, respectively.\nFigure 1 reveals that the height difference (husband's height\nminus wife's height) increased with the husband's height (lin-\nthe male-taller norm occurred in the shortest male group and\nthe tallest female group. The length of lines above the histo-\ngram represents the magnitude of the standard deviation of\nheight difference in each height category. Figure 2A shows the\nactual frequency of each height difference category. Height\ndifferences between 5 cm and 15 cm had a higher frequency\nof occurring than the other categories. Figure 2B follows the\nstrategy proposed by Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, et al. (2013) to\ncalculate the relative likelihood of pairing, that is the actual\nfrequency observed in the population divided by the simulated\nfrequency resulting from random pairing. The actual frequency\nwas greater than the expected frequency from the simulations\n2B supports the male-not-too-tall norm.\nWhether assortative mating with respect to height varies\nwith age cohort, educational level, and family income was\nexplored further in Table 2. The correlation coefficients\nbetween the height of male and female spouses were significant\nin all groups, indicating that the assorative mating with respect\nto height prevailed in all groups. The correlation coefficients\nfor the old cohort were greater than the young cohort. Likewise,\nthe association between the heights of male and female spouses\nwas greater for high family income group than low family\nincome group. As on average, the old were richer than the\nyoung, it is possible that the relationship between family\nincome and spouse's height is a reflection of the relationship\nbetween age and family income.\nSimulated Distribution and Actual Distribution\nthe wife was taller than the husband, comprising only 2.38% of\n4 Evolutionary Psychology\nthe sample (see Table 3), compared to 4.09% in Stulp, Buunk,\nPollet, et al. (2013). Of course, as in this sample, husbands on\naverage were taller than their wives by more than 11 cm, it was\nexpected by chance that husbands were taller than wives in\nmost cases. However, if assortative mating in the marriage\nmarket indeed conforms to the male-taller norm, then this\n2.38% would be significantly less than the breakage proportion\nof the male-taller norm resulting from a random sorting.\nTable 3 records the maximal and minimal number of cases\nin which a wife was taller than her husband in the 200 random\nsimulations. The maximal number and the minimal number of\ncases violating the male-taller norm were 84 and 46, respec-\ntively. Both numbers were much higher than the actual num-\nber of violation cases, 32. The frequency of violation cases,\nthat is, a wife taller than her husband, in each simulation was\nnever less than 32. The second column of Table 3 shows the\npercentage of cases violating the male-taller norm. The per-\ncentage of the cases violating the male-taller norm for the\nmaximal number of cases was 6.25%, while for the minimal\nnumber of cases, it was 3.42%; both percentages were greater\nthan the actual violation percentage, 2.38%. The third column\npresents Z tests for the percentages of the cases violating the\nmale-taller norm in the random sorting with respect to the\nactual violation percentage. All three Z values significantly\nrejected the null hypothesis that violation percentages for the\ncases in the random sorting were equal to or less than the\nactual violation percentage.\nThe difference between the actual violation percentage and\nthe violation percentage generated from 200 random simulations\nwas small. From another angle, the difference in the number of\nviolation cases between the actual situation and the simulations\nwas substantial. The actual number of violation cases was 32, but\nthe average amount of violation cases in the 200 simulations was\n65. This means that about half the number of male-taller viola-\ntion cases were avoided. This provides evidence of the male-\ntaller norm. Furthermore, because most males were taller than\nfemales, the percentages of violation cases in the simulations\nwere small. By its very nature, the difference of the violation\npercentages between the actual situation and the random simula-\ntion was also small. But this small percentage difference cannot\nbe used to deny the male-taller norm.\nThe first row of Table 4 presents the actual counts regarding\nheight difference between husband and wife.

The relative likelihood of pairing\nwhich is the actual frequency observed in the population divided by\nthe simulated frequency resulting from random pairing. The sample\nshows the median counts of 200 random simulations by height\ndifference. The values in the third row are the p values for each\nheight difference category. For example, in the 200 simula-\ntions, none of the simulated counts in the ``less than 0'' cate-\ngory were less than or equal to the actual counts, 32, so the\ncorresponds to the directional hypothesis that the simulated\ncounts are either over- or underrepresented compared to the\nactual counts (Stulp, Buunk, Pollet, et al., 2013). The p values\ngories were significantly higher than what would be expected\nby chance, while the actual counts in the categories less than\n5 cm and greater than 20 cm were significantly lower than\nwhat would be expected by chance. Due to the missing values\nof explanatory variables, 723 couples are deleted. Using the\nsame simulation approach, the same results are obtained from\nthe 2,067 couples. That is, the actual counts of height differ-\nence between 5 and 15 cm were higher than what would be\nexpected by chance. The deletion of observations does not\nchange the conclusion.\nOrdered Probit Models\nThe advantage of regression is that it can control for other\nfactors and specifically focus on the pure relationship between\nthe heights of husbands and wives. In Table 5, the dependent\nvariables of the left panel and right panel are husband's height\nand wife's height, respectively. The middle group of spouse's\nheight was the comparison reference and is not shown in\nTable 5. The left panel and the right panel of Table 5, respec-\ntively, show the husband and wife results of the ordered probit\nreference group, while height between 166 and 170 cm was the\nhusband height reference group. In other words, the groups of\naverage heights for males and females were used as the respec-\ntive reference groups. Neither reference group was shown in\nthe table. The explanatory variables included four categories of\nspouse height, respondents' and spouse's educational years and\nage, and logarithm family income. Family income was taken as\nthe logarithm because the ordered probit models cannot con-\nverge if the family income did not take a logarithm. Spouse's\nage was not incorporated into the explanatory variables due to a\nmulticollinearity concern. In this sample, the correlation coef-\nficient between a husband's age and his wife's age was .72.\nWhen spouse's age was included in the model, the coefficient\nof spouse's age in either husband model or in wife model\nshowed a reverse sign as expected. We expected that the young\ngeneration would be taller than the old generation, but the\ncoefficients of spouse's age were significantly positive, indi-\ncating that old spouses were coupled with tall respondents.\nGiven the high correlation between spouse's ages, this is likely\nto be a consequence of multicollinearity. Therefore, the\nspouse's age was excluded. In fact, Dormann et al. (2013)\nindicated that multicollinearity begins to severely distort model\nestimation when |r| > .7. Tabachnick and Fidell (2014) also\nsuggested deleting the highly correlated variable when |r| > .7.\nIn the left panel, the coefficients of wife's height categories\nshorter than and taller than the average height group were\nnegatively and positively significant at least at the 10% level,\nrespectively. Husband's education and age were respectively\npositively and negatively significant at the 1% level. Husbands\nTable 3.

The last column is the Z-value testing if the percentage is significantly\ndifferent with the actual percentage, 2.38.\nTable 2. Correlation Coefficients Between Husband's and Wife's Height by Age, Education, Family Income, and Sex.\nSex Young Old Low Education High Education Low Income High Income\nMen\nWomen\nNote. Table 2 divides age, educational attainment, and family income into two groups. The number of observations is 1,344. Husbands younger or equal to 40\n(median) years old were classified into the young group, whereas others into the old group. The median age for wives was 37, and the same classification rule\nwas applied. Educational attaintment less than or equal to high school was defined as low education, whereas higher than high school was high education. Family\nincome less than or equal to the median family income, NT$55,000, was low family income, and high family income if greater than the median family income.\n6 Evolutionary Psychology\nwith higher educational attainment and younger age were tal-\nler. Highly educated wives were coupled with tall men. Rich\nfamilies had tall husbands.\nThe right panel of Table 5 shows the results for wives. The\ncoefficients of husband height categories shorter than 166 were\nsignificant at the 5% level. The coefficient of the tallest hus-\nwas not significant. Although for women it seems to indicate\nthat husband's height were indistinguishable between the\nginal probability table) shows that men of 171\u00ad175 had a sig-\nnificantly different chance to be married to women of a\ndifferent height category. The absolute values of the coeffi-\ncients of age and family income and their t-values in the right\npanel were smaller than husband's corresponding values in the\nleft panel.\nNotably, ordered probit models are not linear. Unlike coef-\nficients of ordinary least squares (OLS) models, coefficients of\nordered probit models are not marginal effects of their corre-\nsponding variables. The marginal effects are in terms of prob-\nability and vary with the quantity of the independent variables\nin question. Computer software provides a marginal probability\neffect of an independent variable at its average and at the\nother variables' averages. The marginal probability effect of\na dummy variable, such as spouse height groups, is the prob-\nability change from the reference group to a group in question.\nThe top and bottom panels of Table 6 exhibit the marginal\nprobability effects of the ordered probit models as husband's\nheight and wife's height are the dependent variables, respec-\ntively. Each independent variable was associated with five\nmarginal probability effects. For example, in the top panel, the\nfive marginal probability effects of husband's education were\nginal probabilities corresponded to each husband height cate-\ngory in the top row. The probabailty \u00c0.004 meant that an\nincrement of 1 year of education decreased the probability by\n.004 of falling in the category of less than or equal to 160 cm.\nBy the same token, the increment of 1 year of education\ndecreased the probability by .008 and .003, respectively, falling\n175 and >175 cm categories. These five marginal probabilities\nwere calculated using Equation 4, and their sum was zero. The\nmarginal probability of a husband's educational attainment was\nnegative and became positive as a husband's height increased.\nThis property reflects the positive coefficient of husband's\neducational attainment in Table 5.\nIn the top panel of Table 6, wife's height between 156 and\n160 cm was the reference group which is not shown in the\ntable. Any marginal probability of the wife's height category\nwas the difference between that category and the reference\ncategory. For example, the first value in the first column\nTable 4. Actual and Simulated Counts of Height Differences.\nNote. The height difference is a husband's height minus his wife's height. Median counts is the median in each height difference category of the 200 simulations.\np Value for each category is calculated by dividing the number of simulations in which the number of the simulated counts is less than or equal to the number of\nactual counts. For example, for none of the 200 simulations were their simulated counts less than or equal to the actual counts (32), so the p < 1/200 \u00bc .005. The\nTable 5.

This marginal probability was signif-\nicant at the 1% level. Taking the category of wife height\ngroup, the marginal probability of women in this height cate-\ngory being coupled with a man whose height was less than or\nto the height reference group, women in the taller groups were\nmore unlikely to be married to a man shorter than 171 cm and\nmore likely to be married to a man taller than 175 cm. With\nwives who were taller than the reference group, the absolute\nvalue of the negative marginal probability increased with\nwomen's height, suggesting that taller women were more\nunlikely to be married to short men. Likewise, the positive\nmarginal probability of the taller women also increased with\nwomen's height, indicating that taller women were more likely\nto be married to tall men. When wives were shorter than the\nreference group, the positive marginal probability and the abso-\nlute value of the negative marginal probability decreased as\nwife's height increased. These figures indicated that short\nwomen were more likely to be married to short men and less\nlikely to be married to tall men, respectively.\nPositive values in Table 6 indicated that the height match in\nquestion had a higher probability to occur than the correspond-\ning match in the reference group.

The height\nDiscussion\nThe height data from the ESCNHS were self-reported.\nAlthough measured height is more precise than self-reported\nheight, several studies have reported that these two measure-\nments are highly correlated. For example, Spencer, Appleby,\ncorrelation coefficients between measured and self-reported\nheight were greater than .9 for British persons, .979 for Japa-\nnese men, and .988 for Japanese women, respectively. People\ntend to overreport their height and to underreport their weight.\nUsing self-reported stature to calculate body mass index might\ntherefore underestimate the problem of obesity (Spencer,\nAppleby, Davey, & Key, 2002). However, the bias of using\nself-reported height to investigate height difference between a\nhusband and his wife is limited as both sexes tend to overreport\ntheir height and the overestimates will be canceled out. There is\nno agreement about which sex overreports their height more\nthan the other sex. Some studies found that men overreported\ntheir height more than women (Krul, Daanen, & Choi, 2011),\nsome indicated that men and women overreported their height\nby the same magnitude (Wada et al., 2005), and some even\nfound that women overreported more than men (Lucca &\nIn each society, there seems to exist an ideal height differ-\nence between a male and his female spouse. The ideal range of\nheight difference consists of an upper and lower bound. This\nideal range of height difference in the United Kingdom is\nis 5\u00ad15 cm in Taiwan. The stereotype gender role implies that a\nhusband has to be significantly taller than his wife. Hence, the\nsex-role impression cannot be created when the height differ-\nence between a couple is less than the lower bound of the\nideal range. If shortness reflects liabilities of personal traits\n(Agerstro\n2004), then women dislike looking too short for their partners.\nMen also dislike their partners to look too short relative to\nthemselves. This societal expectation constructs the upper\nbound of the ideal range of the height difference between\na couple. Women prefer a mate taller than themselves.\nEvolutionary psychology and resource access can explain this\nmale-taller norm phenomena. However, these two hypotheses\ncannot explain why women do not prefer a mate much taller\nthan themselves. If tall men are a symbol of dominance, com-\npetitiveness, and resource access, then all women, regardless of\ntheir own height, will desire the same group of tall men. But\nthis contradicts what we observed. The recent finding of the\nmale-not-too-tall norm implies more hypotheses are needed to\nexplain why women prefer a mate taller but not much taller\nthan themselves.\nThe lower bound is probably determined by the societal\ncharacteristics, in particular the degree of sex equality. The\ndegree of sex stereotype is low in sex equal societies, and\nconsequently, these societies possess a small lower bound of\nthe ideal range of the height difference. The Global Gender\nGap Index (GGGI) was constructed by the World Economic\nForum to measure sex equality among countries. A large GGGI\nindicates a highly sex equal society. The lower bound of the\nheight difference observed in the United Kingdom is 0, while in\nTaiwan is 5. Correspondingly, the GGGI for the United King-\nThe upper bound of the ideal range is likely to vary with\nsocietal expectation and the stature property of a population.\nFrom the perspective of the stature property, Euopeans are\ntaller than Asians. It seems that tall populations have a greater\nupper bound than short populations. As tall populations have a\ngreater height variance than short populations (Schmitt &\nHarrison, 1988), a great upper bound of the ideal height differ-\nence in tall populations is able to contain a sufficiently large\npool of mates. This stature property of a population might be\nthe biological basis of the formation of societal expectation. In\nother words, a male taller than his female spouse by more than\nthe upper bound would be seen as a weird couple which actu-\nally implies that a sufficiently large pool of mates has been\nreached with a smaller height difference in this population.\nThis might explain why the observed upper bound of the height\ndifference in Taiwan was smaller than in the United Kingdom.\nCohen (2013) published a nonacademic article in the Atlantic.\nHe used 4,600 couples from the data set of the Panel Study of\ndom simulations for height match. From the figure he drew, the\nactual height difference was roughly within a range between\nthan expected by chance. The GGGI for the United States in\nheight difference occurring more than expected in the United\nStates was in line with the aforementioned arguments. How-\never, the lack of studies on this issue does not allow us to make\na persuasive conclusion. Further studies are encouraged to\nexplore this issue in different populations.\nThis study used Taiwanese data to examine the prevalence\nof the male-taller and the male-not-too-tall norms in Taiwan.\nConsistent with previous studies using Western populations\nrelative height for Taiwanese couples was large for tall men\nand short women and small for short men and tall women. This\nprovides evidence for the male-taller norm because tall men\nand short women have a greater buffer than short men and tall\nwomen to conform to the male-taller norm. As expected, the\nshorter the husband or the taller the wife, the more likely the\nviolation of the male-taller norm. The uneven distribution of\nthe number of cases violating the male-taller norm is also evi-\ndence for the male-taller norm because short men and tall\nwomen find it more difficult to avoid the violation of the\nmale-taller norm. Women want taller men more than men want\nshorter women (Stulp, Buunk, Kurzban, & Verhulst, 2013;\nStulp, Buunk, & Pollet, 2013). From another perspective, the\nhigh violation proportion of the male-taller norm for tall\nwomen indicates that the male-taller norm is not essential.\nAfter all, stature is only one of multiple dimensions considered\nin a marriage. In addition, the taller the husbands, the more\nfamily income and years of education they had. These results\nwere in line with the findings in the literature (Bo\n\u00a8ckerman &\nVainioma\nAn OLS model can verify the overall relationship between\nhusband's height and wife's height by controlling for other\nfactors. However, this continuous variable model cannot exam-\nine which height group of women is more likely to be coupled\nwith which height group of men. This is why the continuous\nvariable of height was categorized, and an ordered probit model\nwas applied. The subjective categorization on height implies\nthat the application of the ordered probit model is not a perfect\nmethodology, but it gives alternative results and conclusions\nthat an OLS model would be unable to give. With the control of\nother factors, an OLS model can verify the male-taller norm,\nbut it cannot verify the male-not-too-tall norm. An ordered\nprobit model is able to verify the male-taller norm as well as\nthe male-not-too-tall norm at the same time. The results of the\nordered probit models demonstrated that tall men were more\nlikely to be coupled with tall women, whereas short men were\nmore likely to be coupled with short women. These results\nverified the prevalence of the male-taller norm in Taiwan. The\nresults of the ordered probit models further confirmed the pre-\nvalence of the male-not-too-tall norm in Taiwan. The fre-\nquency of the height difference between a husband and his\nwife to be within the range of 5\u00ad15 cm was significantly higher\nthan other ranges. This range was consistent with the result of\nthe random simulations.\nactual couples were in line with the male-taller norm, statisti-\ncally more than 88.8% of random couples. Despite the signif-\nicant difference between random mating and actual mating,\nSohn (2015) argued that the small difference only made statis-\ntical sense and concluded a lack of evidence for the male-taller\nnorm in Indonesia. The difference of violation ratios between\nthe actual mating and the random mating in Taiwan was only\nabout 2.5% on average, but this study showed that this small\ndifference still differed from chance. The average number of\ncases violating the male-taller norm in the random mating was\nmore than 2 times the size of the actual mating.\nPreferred characteristics and actual characteristics of mates\nusually differ (Courtiol, Picq, Godelle, Raymond, & Ferdy,\n2010). This difference occurs for at least two reasons. First,\npreferred characteristics are usually compromised in actual\nmatches (Stulp, Buunk, Kurzban, et al., 2013). Second, a pos-\nitive association between the heights of a man and his female\nspouse from the actual couple data might reflect the assortative\nmating with respect to factors other than height. For example,\nwe have seen that educational attainment was positively corre-\nlated with height. The assortative mating with respect to edu-\ncation also supports the positive association between the\nheights of a male and of his female spouse. This was of course\nnot the case for the present study because the ordered probit\nmodels controlled for educational attainment. However, it is\nstill possible that the positive association of the heights\nbetween a couple is due to some other unobserved factors.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNote\n1.
