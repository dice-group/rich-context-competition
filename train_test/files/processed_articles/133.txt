However, such\nregulation can have negative side effects. In a weak economy asset risk increases which\nin turn increases capital requirements. This might induce banks to reduce lending. The\nrelationship between risk based capital charges and bank lending has been explored in\nthe theoretical literature. However, there has been no prior empirical examination of the\nissue. In this paper we estimate the effect of risk based capital charges on bank lending\nand firms' access to funds when there is an exogenous shock to credit risk.\nContribution\nWe are the first to provide direct empirical estimates of how the pro-cyclicality inherent in\nthe model-based approach to capital regulation affects the supply of loans to firms. The\nrichness of our loan-level data set and the institutional details of the German Basel II\nintroduction allow us to overcome several identification issues related to bank and firm\nheterogeneity. Our paper shows that a tightening of capital requirements caused by pro-\ncyclical regulation affected lending in Germany after the Lehman collapse and had severe\nconsequences for firms' overall access to funds.\nResults\nWe find that loans subject to model-based, time-varying capital charges were reduced\nby 3.5 percent more than loans under the traditional approach to capital regulation.\nImportantly, we show that the effects are not driven by changes in the demand for loans\nor differences between banks using the new approach and banks not using it. Several cross-\nsectional tests support our argumentation. Finally, the effect is even stronger when we\nexamine aggregate firm borrowing, suggesting that the pro-cyclical effect of model-based\ncapital charges is not offset by substitution to other banks which use the traditional\napproach.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nForschungsfrage\nEin Hauptziel der Bankenregulierung seit Einf\u00a8\nuhrung der Basel I-Richtlinien im Jahr 1988\nist eine st\u00a8\narkere Orientierung der Eigenkapitalanforderungen am tats\u00a8\nachlichen Risiko einer\nBank.

The\nusual disclaimer on errors applies here as well.\n1 Introduction\nThe determination of bank capital charges is one of the most important and controversial\ntopics in bank regulation.1 One of the main goals in recent decades--starting with the\nBasel I agreement in 1988--was to align capital charges with the risk of bank assets.\nBasel II made an important step in this direction by introducing capital charges for\nindividual loans that depend on model-based risk estimates. More than 100 countries\nhave implemented the agreement (see Financial Stability Institute 2010) and many of\nthe world's larger banks are now using their internal rating models to determine capital\ncharges for individual credit risks.\nThere has long been a concern that linking capital charges to asset risk may exacerbate\nbusiness cycle fluctuations (see Dan\u00b4\nielsson, Embrechts, Goodhart, Keating, Muennich,\ncapital requirements will increase in a downturn if measures of asset risk are responsive\nto economic conditions; at the same time bank capital is likely to be eroded by loan\nwrite-offs. Capital constrained banks that are unable or unwilling to raise new equity in\nbad times will be forced to deleverage by reducing lending, hence exacerbating the initial\ndownturn. In this paper, we use data from the German credit register to identify the\neffect of asset-specific, risk-based capital charges on bank lending behavior and on the\naggregate ability of firms to borrow when there is an exogenous real sector shock. The\neffects on firms access to credit are particularly important to assess the consequences of\npro-cyclical model-based capital regulation for the real sector.2\nWhile the pro-cyclicality of bank lending under Basel II has been widely discussed,3\nfour issues make identifying the empirical effects on lending a difficult task. First, a\nbank's risk assessment and its lending decision for a specific borrower are likely to be\njointly determined, which means that the relationship between risk estimates and lending\nadjustments suffers from endogeneity. Second, economic downturns are likely to affect\nboth a firm's loan demand and the lender's evaluation of its credit risk. Therefore, it is\nessential to disentangle a shift in a firm's loan demand from a shift in loan supply. Third,\na downturn might affect the larger banks which are more likely to use risk models to\ndetermine capital charges differently than the smaller banks which retain the traditional\napproach to capital regulation. Thus, it can be difficult to determine whether a change\nin bank lending is driven by pro-cyclical capital regulation, or the way in which the bank\nis affected by a recession shock. Fourth, micro-level data on loan amounts combined with\ninformation on the regulatory approach used by the bank to determine capital charges\nfor the respective loans are difficult to obtain.\nWe address these issues by examining changes in bank lending in Germany around\nreview of the literature is provided by Bhattacharya, Boot, and Thakor (1998).\n2Terminology is as follows: capital charges are counter-cyclical, if they increase during an economic\ndownturn. If banks react by cutting back lending, then lending and credit availability are pro-cyclical\nand amplify the business cycle.\ncontributed to the financial crisis.\nthe credit risk shock that followed the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.\nImmediately after Lehman, the German economy entered a recession, associated with a\nsteep and abrupt decline in real sector expectations. Contemporaneous newspaper articles\ndocument the importance of the credit risk shock and illustrate that the contraction came\nunexpectedly for the majority of analysts and economists.4 As credit risk exogenously\nincreased banks had to adjust their internal risk estimates, implying an increase in capital\ncharges for loans under model-based capital regulation. In contrast, capital charges for\nloans under the traditional approach to capital regulation were unaffected by the credit\nrisk shock as they did not depend on economic conditions.\nAt the time of the credit risk shock, German banks were in the midst of implementing\nthe Basel II regulations. They were allowed to choose between the model-based approach\n(termed internal ratings-based, or IRB) and the more traditional or standard approach\n(SA) with fixed risk weights. At those banks that opted for model-based regulation (IRB\nbanks), the approach was being phased in over time. Thus, in September 2008, IRB banks\nwere using the IRB approach for some of their loan portfolios while other portfolios were\nstill subject to SA. Since German firms typically have multiple banking relationships,\nmany firms found themselves in the IRB pool of one bank and in the SA pool of another\nIRB bank. This institutional setup allows us to systematically control for both bank and\nfirm heterogeneity. Specifically, we can test whether the same firm--borrowing from two\ndifferent IRB banks--obtains relatively less credit from the bank where the firm is in\nthe IRB pool following the credit risk shock, as compared to the bank where the firm is\nin the SA pool. Importantly, we are able to hold constant firm-specific determinants of\nloan demand and bank-specific determinants of loan supply (compare with Khwaja and\nenez, Ongena, Peydr\u00b4\no, and Saurina 2014). Our study benefits from the\nextensive information that is available in the German credit register, including loan-level\ninformation on the regulatory approach and the internal risk estimate of the bank.\nWe find that the approach used to determine capital charges has a strong and econom-\nically meaningful impact on the cyclicality of lending. Our estimates indicate that capital\nrequirements for loans under IRB rose by about 0.5 percentage points over the credit\nrisk shock, which is large since the regulatory minimum capital requirement is 8 percent\nof risk-weighted assets (RWA). As a consequence, banks using IRB reduced loans to the\nsame firm by 2.1 to 3.9 percentage points more in response to the shock when capital\ncharges for the loan were based on internal ratings (IRB) instead of fixed risk weights\n(SA).\nIdentification in this test rests on the assumption that the selection of IRB loans\nwithin IRB banks is not systematically related to the adjustment of loans in response to\nthe credit risk shock. Whether a specific loan portfolio had been shifted to IRB prior to\nthe shock is mainly determined by the size of the portfolio. Banks first applied IRB to\nloan portfolios for which they had sufficient data to calibrate a meaningful risk model.\nWe find that the size of a portfolio has a positive influence on the adjustment of loans\nover the shock, which means that any bias from selection is likely to work against our\nfindings.\nTo mitigate remaining concerns, we exploit another institutional feature of the Basel II\nframework. The regulation provides a capital charge discount for loans to firms with a\n4See, e.g., F.A.Z., December 23, 2008, \"Economists failed in predicting the crash\". Evidence from\nnewspaper articles is summarized in Appendix TableA.1.\nturnover less than e 50 million. Consequently, the impact of the credit risk shock on\ncapital charges for IRB loans varies with the size of the firm. A given increase in risk\nparameters induced a smaller increase in capital charges for loans to small firms that\nbenefited from the discount. Controlling for any potential difference between the SA and\nIRB pool of a specific bank, we find that the relative reduction of IRB loans is 1.3 to 3.2\npercentage points stronger for firms with a turnover of e 50 million as compared with\nfirms with a turnover of e 25 million. This finding suggests a strong influence of the\nregulatory treatment on the adjustment of loans over the shock, while it cannot be due\nto the assignment of loans to the IRB group.\nSeveral cross-sectional tests further strengthen our results. IRB banks with a low\nequity ratio had a small buffer to absorb increases in capital charges and consequently\nreduced their IRB loans relatively more following the credit risk shock. Further, the IRB\neffect is more pronounced for less profitable firms which are likely to be more affected by\nthe credit risk shock, and for firms to which IRB banks have a relatively large exposure.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that the credit risk shock forced banks to deleverage\nin order to fulfill the higher capital requirements induced by model-based regulation.\nIn a final step we examine whether the introduction of risk-based capital regulation\nhad pro-cyclical effects on the aggregate availability of bank credit to firms. To account\nfor differences in loan demand among firms borrowing from different types of banks, we\nfocus on variation in the share of a firm's loans obtained from IRB banks that are subject\nto the IRB approach. Interestingly, we find that pro-cyclical effects are even stronger\nat the firm level. A firm with 82 percent IRB loans (75th percentile) prior to the shock\nexperiences a reduction in aggregate lending that is 3.0 to 4.6 percentage points larger\nthan the reduction for a firm with 43 percent IRB loans (25th percentile). This result is\nconsistent with the earlier finding that banks cut particularly those IRB loans to which\nthey have a high exposure in response to the credit risk shock. Further, during economic\ndownturns, it seems to be difficult for firms to offset reductions in lending from one bank\nby increasing borrowing from other banks. This suggests that microprudential regulation\ncan have sizeable consequences for the real sector during economic downturns. We find\nlittle evidence that firms that had more IRB loans experienced greater increases in capital\ncosts, which suggests that banks using IRB adjusted loan quantities rather than loan\nconditions (i.e., prices) in reaction to the credit risk shock.\nWe conduct several robustness tests to assess the possibility that confounding shocks\naround our event are responsible for parts of our findings. For example, we use placebo\ntests to check for potential pre-trends and do not find any significant differences in the\nadjustment of IRB and SA loans prior to the credit risk shock in 2008Q3. In some\nsense, our findings are conditional on the banking sector finding itself in a crisis period.\nAlthough our identification strategy allows us to address the fact that individual banks\nhave been heterogeneously affected by the financial crisis, it is possible that differences in\nthe adjustment of IRB and SA loans would have been less pronounced if banks had not\nbeen affected by the global financial crisis and therefore had had more capital available.\nSince real sector and financial crises tend to go hand-in-hand, we do not think that this\nobservation makes the findings of our paper less interesting.\nOur paper is the first to provide direct empirical estimates of how the pro-cyclicality\ninherent in the model-based approach to capital regulation affects the supply of loans\nto firms. Previous studies of the pro-cyclicality of regulation used simulation models5\nor analyzed the effects of business cycles on aggregate buffers.6 Our findings confirm\nthe warnings regarding Basel II capital regulation by policy analysts such as Borio et al.\nFurther, we add to the literature that analyzes the impact of bank liquidity or capital\nshocks on loan supply (Bernanke 1983, Bernanke, Lown, and Friedman 1991, Kashyap and\nStein 2000). Our findings are consistent with earlier research indicating that poorly capi-\ntalized banks reduce lending during recessions (Gambacorta and Mistrulli 2004), and that\nloan supply shocks have a negative effect on real economic activity (Peek and Rosengren\nMost closely related to our own paper is the work by Jim\u00b4\nenez, Ongena, Peydr\u00b4\no, and\nSaurina (2013), who examine the effect of dynamic provisioning rules in Spain and find\nthat lowering capital requirements when economic conditions deteriorate helps banks to\nmaintain their supply of credit. Other evidence suggests that increases in capital require-\nments induce reductions in lending (Thakor 1996, Aiyar, Calomiris, and Wiedalek 2014).\nIyer, Da-Rocha-Lopes, Peydr\u00b4\no, and Schoar (2014), and Paravisini, Rappoport, Schnabl,\nand Wolfenzon (2014) document the extent of the credit crunch during the recent crisis.\nOur paper combines these different strands of the literature by showing that a tighten-\ning of capital requirements caused by pro-cyclical regulation affected lending in Germany\nafter the Lehman collapse and had severe consequences for firms' overall access to funds.\nOur findings illustrate how microprudential and macroprudential goals of banking\nsector regulation might conflict with one another.7 On the one hand, the reduction in\nlending we document is due to capital charges that are based on improved evaluations of\ncredit risk. In terms of safety of the individual bank, it might make sense to extend fewer\nloans when economic conditions deteriorate. Following this logic, Repullo and Suarez\n(2012) suggest that pro-cyclical side effects of Basel II may have a payoff in the long-term\nsolvency of the banking system. On the other hand, as banks simultaneously restrain their\nlending, firms' access to funds becomes restricted which might negatively affect investment\nexpenditure and exacerbate the cyclical shock. In order to evaluate the welfare effects of\npro-cyclical capital regulation one would have to evaluate both its impact on the long-\nterm safety of the banking sector and its effect on credit supply in economic downturns.\nWhile we cannot make a statement on the former, our findings help to quantify the latter.\nSection 2 describes the institutional details around the introduction of Basel II in\nGermany and our data. Section 3 outlines our empirical strategy. Sections 4, 5 and 6\npresent the results. Section 7 offers our conclusions.\n5See Carling, Jacobson, Lind\u00b4\nostegui, Gonz\u00b4\nalez-Mosquera, Marcelo, and\n6See Ayuso, P\u00b4\n7See Galati and Moessner (2013) for a survey of the literature on macroprudential regulation. Recent\nacademic contributions include Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein (2008), Brunnermeier, Goodhart, Persaud,\n2 Institutional background and data\nThe section begins with an explanation of the determination of capital charges in the\nBasel II agreement and the arrangements for its introduction in Germany. We then\ndescribe our event, a sudden change in expectations concerning the future performance\nof the German economy in the third quarter of 2008 that occurred as a consequence of\nthe turmoil following the Lehman bankruptcy. Finally, we outline our underlying data\nset from the German credit register of Deutsche Bundesbank and present descriptive\nstatistics.\n2.1 Introduction of risk-weighted capital charges\nThe original Basel agreement (Basel I) introduced risk-based capital charges by assigning\neach bank asset to one of several risk buckets that received different risk weights (e.g., all\ncorporate loans had the same risk weight of 100 percent). Regulatory capital requirements\nwere defined in terms of risk-weighted assets, the amount of each asset multiplied by its\nrisk weight. A drawback of this framework was that banks had an incentive to hold the\nriskiest assets within each risk bucket, as these provided the highest yield while being\nsubject to the same capital charges as less risky assets in the bucket. Therefore, an\nimportant motive for the introduction of Basel II capital standards was the desire to\nestablish a stronger link between capital charges and the actual risk of each asset.\nUnder Basel II, banks are allowed to choose among two broad methodologies to calcu-\nlate their capital charges for credit risk.8 First, the standard approach (SA) is similar to\nthe old Basel I framework and automatically assigns a fixed risk weight of 100 percent to\nthe uncollateralized part of corporate loans if the borrower has no external rating.9 Sec-\nond, banks can opt for the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach that relies on the banks'\nown estimates of the risk associated with a loan. IRB requires the estimation of four pa-\nrameters to determine the risk weight for a loan: the probability of default (PD), the\nloss given default, exposure at default, and the effective maturity of the loan. The higher\nthe estimate for any of these parameters, the higher the risk weight that is attributed to\nthe loan.10 For our analysis the crucial issue is that capital charges are endogenous to\ncredit risk with IRB but not with SA. The internal risk models used by German banks\nestimate PDs continuously, so PDs are likely to increase during an economic downturn,\nimplying higher capital charges if the bank is using IRB. In contrast, capital charges for\nloans under SA are determined when the loan is made and do not change.\n8For a description of the Basel agreements see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (1988), Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision (1999), and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2006).\n9If a firm's debt is rated by an external agency, the rating can be used to determine capital charges\nfor loans. In Germany, very few firms have external corporate bond ratings (0.1 percent of the firms\nin our data have external ratings). We exclude loans to these firms from our analysis. In unreported\nregressions we find that our main result is less pronounced in this subsample, maybe because external\nratings also change over the business cycle (although they tend to be more sticky than internal ratings,\nsee Borio and Zhu 2012). Results for these tests are available upon request.\n10In the advanced internal ratings-based approach, the bank provides estimates for all four parameters,\nwhile in the basic internal ratings-based approach the bank estimates only the PD, and standard values\nare assumed for the other parameters. We do not distinguish between the advanced and basic internal\nratings-based approaches in our empirical analysis, because the risk weight depends on the loan's PD in\nboth cases.\nSince the introduction of the IRB approach involves substantial administrative costs,\nit was only adopted by the larger banks that could benefit from scale economies. These\nbanks have an incentive to become IRB institutions because capital requirements are\nsubstantially lower under IRB than under SA. In order to deal with the operational\ncomplexity of introducing new rating models, banks that opted for IRB did not apply the\nnew approach to all loans at once; rather, they agreed on a gradual implementation plan\nwith the regulator. The implementation plan specifies an order according to which IRB\nis applied to the bank's loan portfolios (which are generally loans to a specific business\nunit). As the calibration of a meaningful PD model requires sufficient data on past loan\nperformance, banks typically started with loan portfolios in business units where they\nwere relatively active (see Section 3.1).\nThe introduction of IRB is closely monitored by the regulator. Each model has to be\napproved prior to its introduction and models are validated at least once a year. Once\na rating model has been put in place for a specific portfolio, it is used to determine the\ncapital charges for all new and existing loans. Thus, loans in a portfolio are shifted all\nat once, so that it is not possible for the bank to strategically shift individual loans from\none approach to the other. This also implies that all of a bank's loans to a given firm are\nclassified under the same regulatory approach at any point in time. The German banks\nthat adopted IRB submitted their implementation plans to the regulator in 2006. Hence,\nthey were not able to react to the financial crisis by changing the order of loan portfolios\nthat were transferred to IRB or by applying the standard approach to IRB portfolios after\nloan PDs deteriorated. At the outset of our data period, 2008Q1, the IRB phase-in of\nportfolios was underway. Thus, capital charges for IRB banks were determined by the\ninternal ratings-based approach for some loan portfolios and by the standard approach for\nothers. We exploit this within-bank variation for our identification strategy as explained\nin Section 3.\n2.2 The Lehman event as an exogenous real sector shock\nAs explained in the introduction, it is difficult to examine the relationship between changes\nin the PD and changes in lending, as these variables are endogenous. To circumvent this\nissue, we exploit the Lehman collapse which was an event that exogenously increased\ncredit risk in the German economy. That is, we examine the impact of the credit risk\nshock induced by the real sector downturn that followed the Lehman collapse.\nNewspaper articles from both the German and the international press document the\nimportance of the credit risk shock and show that real sector optimism persisted in 2008\nand then changed drastically after the Lehman bankruptcy in mid-September. E.g., in\nMay Die Welt (May 22, 2008) reported that \"the German economy is not affected by\nthe turbulence on financial markets and the crisis in the US\" and went on to cite expert\nopinion that \"the German economy rests on solid fundamentals.\" The tone changed within\na few weeks of the Lehman bankruptcy. Handelsblatt (October 14, 2008) quotes expert\nopinion that \"the German economy is now in a downward spiral [...] and [there will be an]\nincrease in corporate bankruptcies.\" By the end of the year F.A.Z. (December 23, 2008)\nreported that \"Germany will face the worst economic crisis in 50 years.\" Importantly, the\neconomic contraction came unexpectedly for the majority of economists as documented by\nthe revision of almost all forecast indicators around this time (see, e.g., F.A.Z., December\n23, 2008, \"Economists failed in predicting the crash\"). Relevant newspaper articles are\nsummarized in Appendix TableA.1.\nThe decline in real sector expectations at the end of 2008 was both steep and abrupt.\nReal GDP in Germany declined slightly in the second and third quarters but took an\nunprecedentedly large plunge in the two quarters following the Lehman collapse. It fell\nfollowing quarter. It took almost three years for real GDP to regain its peak level (see\nFigure 1, Panel A). Changed expectations regarding future economic performance led to\nan exogenous increase in estimated probabilities of default, which is precisely the event\nwe are looking for, as it induces variation in changes in capital charges between loans that\nare subject to IRB and loans that are subject to SA.\nThe impact of the credit risk shock on aggregate bank lending in Germany is shown\nin Figure 1, Panel B. German banks expanded their lending until the end of 2008 even as\neconomies around the world slowed down and the financial crisis had started. Only after\nthe third quarter of 2008 (our event date) did lending begin to decline.\nThe relationship between the decline in aggregate lending and model-based capital\nregulation is illustrated in Panel A of Figure 2. It shows aggregate IRB loans reported in\nthe German credit register and the associated risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The aggregate\nvolume of IRB loans drops sharply after the shock as banks reduce their IRB lending\nexposure. The right graph shows the ratio of total RWAs to total IRB loans; the ratio\nincreases sharply until the second quarter of 2009 then declines for about a year when it\nlevels off.\nThe figure shows that banks had to hold more capital for the same amount of IRB\nloans following the credit risk shock. This pattern illustrates the pro-cyclical effect of\ncapital charges: during a recession banks reduce lending in order to keep capital charges\nconstant. The decline in the ratio of RWAs to loans occurred because banks reduced\nthose loans whose risk weights increased most after the shock. We provide evidence for this\ninterpretation in Panel B of Figure 2, which shows total RWAs under the assumption that\nbanks do not adjust the quantity of their loans. Specifically, we calculate a hypothetical\nseries for RWAs by multiplying the observed risk weight for each loan in each period by the\nloan amount in 2008Q3, and then aggregate these amounts in each quarter.11 The right\ngraph of Panel B depicts the ratio of the hypothetical RWAs series to the total amount\nof loans in 2008Q3. It shows that if banks had not adjusted their IRB loans following the\ncredit risk shock, the RWAs to loans ratio would have continued to increase throughout\nthe period. Figure 2 offers strong evidence of a pro-cyclical effect of risk-weighted capital\ncharges on bank loan supply.\n2.3 Data and descriptive statistics\nOur principal source of data is the German credit register compiled by Deutsche Bundes-\nbank. The central bank collects data each quarter on all outstanding loans of at least e\n1.5 million. A distinct feature of the Bundesbank credit register as compared with other\ncredit registers is that banks have to report the regulatory approach used to determine\n11Since we cannot observe risk weights for loans that were canceled or matured before the end of our\nsample period, we consider only loans that existed throughout the entire sample period. The exclusion\nof other loans is likely to bias against finding an increase in the RWAs to loans ratio.\ncapital charges for the loan as well as the corresponding credit risk estimates (i.e., PDs).\nThe dataset also includes information on the lender's and the borrower's identity, the\namount of the loan outstanding, risk-weighted assets corresponding to the loan, and the\namount of collateral provided by the borrower. We supplement the loan data with annual\ninformation on the lenders from bank balance sheets obtained from the Bundesbank's\nBAKIS database.\nOur sample includes 1,825 banks. We restrict the analysis to those commercial loans\nfor which we are able to determine the regulatory approach used at the beginning of our\nsample period in 2008.12 We consider a loan to be an IRB loan if the bank adopted the\napproach for the loan no later than the second quarter of 2008. Since the implementation\nof the internal ratings-based approach extends over several years, some loans that we\nclassify as SA are moved to IRB during our sample period. We address this issue in\nbanks that have adopted IRB. On average, IRB banks had adopted the new approach for\n62 percent of their loans when our sample period starts (Share IRB). The IRB banks are\nmuch larger, have lower equity ratios and about the same ROA as institutions using the\nDescriptive statistics for the loan-level data are shown in Panel B of Table 1. There\nthrough the third quarter of 2011. Descriptive statistics are shown separately for the three\ntypes of loans in our sample: (1) loans provided by SA banks; (2) loans provided by IRB\nbanks that are still subject to SA; and (3) loans provided by IRB banks that are already\nsubject to the new approach. The panel presents loan characteristics at the start of our\ndata period, or prior to the credit risk shock (this pre-event period is the average of data\nThere are considerable differences in the characteristics of loans provided by SA banks\nand loans provided by IRB banks; the differences between IRB and SA loans within IRB\nbanks are considerably smaller. The indicator Relationship lender is equal to one if a\nbank's loans to a specific firm make up more than 75 percent of the firm's aggregate\nloans. Relationship length is the number of quarters that the relationship existed prior to\nour event.\nIRB banks report PDs for all loans and they are on average lower for loans under\nIRB. Further, in line with our expectations, risk-weighted assets for IRB loans are con-\nsiderably lower than risk-weighted assets for the other types of loans. The data also show\na considerable rise in PDs over the shock, which--for IRB loans--is associated with a\nrise in risk-weighted assets by about 6.7 percent. As regulatory capital requirements are\n8 percent of risk-weighted assets, this means that capital charges for loans under IRB\nincreased by 0.54 percentage points on average (6.7 percent \u00d7 8 percent). In contrast,\nrisk-weighted assets for SA loans are not affected by changes in PDs.\nSince the German credit register does not contain information on interest rates, we\nfollow a procedure developed by Haselmann, Schoenherr, and Vig (2013) to impute inter-\nest rates from the data that are available. Specifically, we infer the repayment structure\n12Although Basel II was introduced in Germany in January 2007, detailed information on the regu-\nlatory approach applied to loans including the PD estimates only became available to the regulator in\nof the loan contract from the quarterly data on loan amounts. We match this informa-\ntion with firm-level data on aggregate interest payments obtained from the Bundesbank's\nUSTAN database. This procedure allows us to back out effective annual interest rates\non individual loans. Interest rates for loans under the standard approach are on aver-\nage slightly lower than interest rates for loans under IRB, while there seems to be no\ndifference in the adjustment of interest rates over the shock. In contrast, we observe con-\nsiderable differences in the adjustment of loan quantities: the average IRB loan is reduced\nby 7.5 percent over the shock, which is almost double the amount of the reduction for the\naverage SA loan provided by IRB banks, and about six times the reduction of the average\nloan provided by SA banks.\nPanel B also reports variables measured at the portfolio level, i.e., averages for variables\nthat describe the loans in a bank's portfolio. Portfolio share for a loan to a firm is the\nratio between the bank's loans in the two-digit SIC code industry sector and all loans in\nour sample within that sector. Portfolio PD is the average firm-specific PD for the bank's\nloans in that industry sector.\nFinally, we match our loan data with accounting information for German firms from\nBureau van Dijk's Amadeus database. The Bundesbank credit register and the Amadeus\naccounting information were hand-matched by company name and location. Matches\nwere made for 7,778 firms. Firms in the matched sample are rather large, with average\nassets of e 153.4 million (see Panel C, Table 1). We use the matched sample in Section 5\nto investigate how the aggregate of all loans to a firm change over the shock. The average\ntotal loans to the firms in our matched sample was e 22.7 million prior to the event,\nand declined by 7.8 percent on average following the event. Remarkably, the percentage\ndecline in total loans to these firms is larger than the decline in the average loan within\nour sample. We will further examine this in Section 5.\n3 Empirical Strategy\nWe empirically analyze how the design of capital regulation affects lending by looking first\nat individual loans and then at firms' overall access to funds. In this section, we describe\nthe empirical strategies used to estimate the effects.\n3.1 Loan-level lending\nWe develop three tests to show how banks adjust their loans in response to the credit risk\nshock (see Figure 3 for an illustration of our empirical strategy). We start by examining\nhow banks that have adopted IRB (IRB banks) adjust their loans relative to banks still\nusing the standard approach (SA banks) around the shock. We refer to this as Test 1 and\nestimate the following specification:\nLog(loans)\nij\n= i\n+  Share IRBj\n+ Xij\n + ij\nThe dependent variable is the change in the logarithm of loans from bank j to firm i around\nthe credit risk shock. We collapse the quarterly data into pre- and post-event averages (as\ndefined in Section 2.3) in order to avoid problems of serial correlation (Bertrand, Duflo,\nand Mullainathan 2004).13 Thus, there is one observation per firm-bank relationship.\nShare IRBj\nis the percentage share of all loans of the bank that are subject to the IRB\napproach. Control variables are denoted by Xij\n. Standard errors are double-clustered at\nthe bank and firm level in all our regressions.\nFollowing Khwaja and Mian (2008), we capture differences in firm demand by in-\ncluding firm fixed effects, i\n. Thus, our coefficient  indicates whether the same firm,\nborrowing from (at least) two different banks, experiences a larger decline in lending from\nbanks that use IRB for a larger share of their loans. If, however, the credit risk shock\n(or other confounding events) affected banks that differ in their share of IRB loans in a\nsystematically different way, and the variables Xij\nare unable to control for these differ-\nences, the correlation between Share IRBj\nand the error term, ij\n, might be non-zero. In\nthis case,  would be biased.\nTo address this concern, we develop tests that exploit the gradual introduction of\nmodel-based regulation in Germany. Importantly, at the time of the credit risk shock,\nbanks that had introduced IRB had shifted only some of their loan portfolios to the new\napproach. Thus, there is variation in the regulatory approach within the same bank, which\nallows us to refine the identification strategy. To start, we test whether the results from\nTest 1 are due to bank heterogeneity. That is, we examine whether--for the same firm--\nSA loans from banks that have begun to introduce IRB and loans from SA institutions are\naffected differently by the shock (Test 2 in Figure 3). Neither the SA institution's capital\ncharges nor those for an IRB bank's SA loans are affected by an increase in the credit\nrisk of the borrowing firm. If differences in lending behavior are due to the regulatory\napproach rather than bank differences, then Test 2 should not show any effects.14\nOur strongest identification strategy compares IRB and SA loans to the same firm from\ndifferent banks that have introduced the IRB approach for some of their loan portfolios\n(Test 3 in Figure 3). To identify the effect of differences in capital regulation on loan\namounts within IRB institutions, we restrict the sample to firms that borrow from at\nleast two IRB banks--one bank where the loan is in the IRB pool and another where the\nloan is still subject to SA--and estimate the following equation:\nLog(loans)\nij\n= i\n+ j\n+  IRB loanpj\n+ Xij\n + ij\nwhere p denotes the loan pool and IRB loanpj\ntakes the value of one if the respective loan\nis in the IRB pool and zero if the loan is in the SA pool of bank j. Test 3 shows whether\nthe same firm--borrowing from two different IRB banks--experiences a larger decline in\nits loans under IRB as compared with its loans under SA. In contrast to Equation (1),\nthis specification allows us to include bank fixed effects, j\n, that systematically control for\nheterogeneity across banks (compare with Jim\u00b4\nenez et al. 2014). This is valuable because\nother confounding events might affect banks differently.\nIdentification in Test 3 rests on the assumption that there is no systematic relationship\nbetween the initial assignment of loans to the IRB pool and the bank's adjustment of loans\nin response to the shock. Since we are able to systematically control for firm as well as\nbank heterogeneity in Equation (2), the only concern would be relationship specific factors\n13We could also estimate Equation (1) without time averaging the data if we replace the firm fixed\neffects with firms \u00d7 quarter interactions. Results with this specification are qualitatively very similar.\n14If our findings in Test 1 are driven by bank heterogeneity, we would expect similar effects with this\nsample of SA loans.\ncorrelated with the time at which a specific loan is shifted to IRB. As explained in Section 2\nonly entire loan portfolios--and not individual loans--can be shifted to IRB. Therefore,\nwhether a specific loan was switched to IRB depends on portfolio characteristics rather\nthan characteristics of the loan or the firm's banking relationship.\nTo examine this selection issue empirically, we regress IRB loanpj\nwhich indicates\nwhether a loan was shifted to IRB prior to the credit risk shock on loan relationship\nand portfolio characteristics. There are two portfolio characteristics that may impact\nthe IRB selection: (1) since the regulator only approved risk models of portfolios that\nhad sufficient data for calibration, the size of a loan portfolio, Portfolio share, should\nbe positively correlated with IRB loanpj\n; (2) banks have an incentive to first shift those\nloan portfolios that carry the smallest risk (measured by Portfolio PD), since for these\nportfolios the shift to IRB would provide the greatest reduction in capital charges. Results\nin Table 2 show that only the size of the portfolio is related to the selection of loans, while\nall loan relationship characteristics such as the size of the loan, the collateral ratio, the\nindicator for relationship lending and the relationship length do not have a significant\nimpact. This result holds in the sample of all loans from IRB banks (columns 1-3) and in\nthe sample of loans to firms with at least one IRB loan and at least one SA loan from an\nIRB bank that we use for identification in Test 3 (columns 4-6). Consequently, we keep\nPortfolio share as a control for selection in our tests.\nTo address remaining concerns regarding the selection of IRB loans, we exploit a\nfeature in the risk weight formula relating PDs to risk-weighted assets that was introduced\nto promote lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). As illustrated in Figure 4,\nrisk weights vary with firm sales when sales are less than e 50 million, which means that an\nidentical increase in the PD induces a smaller increase in the risk weight for loans to SMEs.\nConsequently, capital charges for IRB loans to these firms are less affected by the credit\nrisk shock. By testing whether the effect estimated in Equation (2) is less pronounced\nfor SMEs we can provide evidence on the pro-cyclicality of model-based regulation that\nis independent of the initial assignment of loans to the IRB group. Specifically, we can\ninclude bank \u00d7 IRB fixed effects (i.e., fixed effects for the SA and IRB pool of each bank)\nand estimate the following equation:\nLog(loans)\nij\n= i\n+ pj\n+  IRB loanpj\n\u00d7 Log(firm sales)\ni\n+ ij\nwhere the variable Log(firm sales)i\nis equal to the logarithm of sales for firms with a\nturnover lower than the threshold, and equal to the logarithm of 50 million for larger\nfirms. Bank \u00d7 IRB fixed effects are denoted by pj\nand account for any potential difference\nbetween the IRB and SA pool of bank j. The coefficient of interest, , indicates whether\nthe relative adjustment of IRB loans is less severe for loans to SMEs that benefit from\nthe discount in capital charges.15\n15In similar specifications, we investigate whether the IRB effect is more pronounced for loans to which\nthe bank has a large exposure, or for loans to less profitable firms for which the PD is more likely to\nincrease. These tests also include bank \u00d7 IRB fixed effects that address concerns regarding the selection\nof IRB loans.\n3.2 Firm-level borrowing\nIn the previous section we developed tests to identify the effect of the credit risk shock on\nthe adjustment of individual loans. Here we explore the effect of IRB regulation on the\nability of firms to access funds. Firms may be able to offset the pro-cyclical effects on loans\nsubject to IRB by obtaining funds from other banks. We examine whether the change\nin firms' total outstanding loans around the credit risk shock depends on IRB loani\n, the\nshare of the firms' loans that were under IRB prior to the event:\nLog(firm loans)\ni\n=  +  IRB loani\n+ Xi\n + i\nThe dependent variable is the change in the logarithm of a firm's total loans over the\ncredit risk shock. The vector Xi\nincludes firm controls and weighted averages of bank\ncontrol variables.16 Standard errors in the firm-level regressions are clustered by the firms'\nlargest lender.\nFirms that borrow mostly from SA banks may differ from firms that borrow mostly\nfrom IRB banks, most notably in their demand for loans. E.g., small firms are more\nlikely to borrow from smaller banks which are largely SA institutions. As we cannot\ndirectly control for loan demand in the firm-level regression, we estimate Equation (4) on\na restricted sample of firms that have both SA loans and IRB loans from IRB banks. In\nthis case the explanatory variable is IRB loani\n\n, which is the share of a firm's loans from\nIRB banks that are subject to the IRB approach. That is, we focus on firms that borrow\nmostly from IRB banks and check whether--among those firms that have multiple loans\nfrom IRB banks--firms with a larger share of IRB loans experience a greater reduction\nin aggregate loans over the shock.17\nAdditionally, we also report  coefficients from Equation (4) with an adjustment for\npotential credit demand shocks on the firm level as suggested by Jim\u00b4\nenez, Mian, Peydr\u00b4\no,\nand Saurina (2011). The adjustment uses the difference between firm fixed effect and OLS\nestimates on the loan level to proxy for the unobserved covariance between credit supply\nand demand shocks on the firm level. Specifically, the adjusted coefficient is defined as\nfollows:\n = OLS\n- (OLS\n- FE\n) \u00d7\nL\nF\nwhere OLS\nF\nare the firm-level OLS coefficient and the variance of IRB loani\n\n,\nwhile OLS\n, FE\nL\nare loan-level OLS and fixed effect coefficients and the variance\nof IRB loanpj\n.\n16We use the amount that the firm borrows from a certain bank divided by the firms' total loans prior\nto the shock as a weight.\n17Aggregate loans to these firms also include loans from SA banks that are not taken into account for\nthe definition of IRB loani\n\n. However, loans from IRB banks account for 85.4 percent of total loans for\nthe average firm in this sample. The remaining loans from SA banks simply add noise and thus prevent\nus from finding a significant impact of the share of a firm's loans from IRB banks that are subject to IRB\non changes in total firm loans.\n4 Regulatory capital and changes in bank lending\nThis section presents results for the specification on the loan level described in Section 3.1.\nFurther, we provide additional cross-sectional results that support our argument.\nWe start by testing whether banks that adopted the IRB approach (IRB banks) adjusted\ntheir loans differently in response to the credit risk shock than banks that continued to\nuse the SA (Test 1). Estimates for Equation (1) are reported in Table 3, columns 1 to\n3. Since observations of firms with a single lending relationship get absorbed by firm\nfixed effects, we restrict the sample to firms that have at least two loans--one loan from\nan SA bank and one loan from an IRB bank, or two loans from distinct IRB banks.18\nColumn 1 indicates that the larger the share of IRB loans within a bank, the more the\nbank reduces its loans to a given firm. Firm-specific credit demand shocks are absorbed by\nthe firm fixed effects. Adding control variables (bank size, capitalization and profitability,\nbank type indicators and Portfolio share) in column 2 reduces the magnitude, but not\nthe significance of the coefficient. In column 3, we replace Share IRB with IRB bank, a\ndummy indicating whether the lender is an IRB institution, and still find a significant\neffect.\nTo illustrate the economic impact of the effect, we compare the change in loans by an\nSA bank to the change in loans by the average IRB bank. For an SA bank Share IRB is\nzero and the average value for an IRB bank is 0.62. Thus, the average IRB bank reduced\nits loans to the same firm by 5.0 percent more than a bank still using SA (column 1). The\ndifference in the change in loans is 3.3 percent when bank controls are included, column 2.\nThe coefficient on the dummy or indicator variable shown in column 3 implies that IRB\nbanks reduced their loans by about 3.1 percent more than SA banks on average.19\nNext, in columns 4-6 of Table 3, we present results for Test 2, where our sample is\nrestricted to SA loans made by both SA and IRB institutions.20 We test whether IRB\nbanks change SA loans to the same firm more than SA banks. Although, the coefficient\non Share IRB is significant in column 4, implying that IRB institutions reduced their\nloans over the shock more than SA institutions, the effect disappears when we control for\nbank characteristics in column 5 and in column 6. Moreover, the coefficients are smaller\nthan the corresponding coefficients for Test 1 in all cases. As before, firm fixed effects\nabsorb any firm-specific credit demand shocks and ensure that we are comparing relative\nchanges in loans to a given firm. The results so far support our claim that the regulatory\napproach itself induced a stronger reduction of loans from IRB banks or banks with more\nIRB loans.\nWe now turn to our strongest identification test for which the sample is restricted\nto loans made by IRB banks.21 Estimates of Equation (2) are reported in columns 7\n19The effect is equal to exp() - 1, where  is the dummy coefficient (Halvorsen and Palmquist 1980).\n20There are 10,496 firms that have at least one SA loan from an SA bank and at least one SA loan\nfrom an IRB bank or two SA loans from different IRB banks. These firms have a total of 49,492 SA\n21There are 7,159 firms with at least one IRB and one SA loan from two different IRB institutions.\nto 9 of Table 3. The key results are the significant negative coefficients on the IRB loan\ndummy which indicates whether the loan was transferred to IRB prior to the credit risk\nshock. The results in column 7 indicate that within the same firm, loans subject to IRB\nare reduced by about 3.8 percent more than loans subject to SA. The effect is robust\nto the inclusion of bank-level control variables in column 8. Since IRB banks have SA\nand IRB loans, we can systematically account for bank heterogeneity by including bank\nfixed effects (column 9). We still find a significant effect of the regulatory approach on\nchanges in loans to the same firm. This provides evidence that the regulatory approach\nused for a specific loan has a strong and economically meaningful influence on the extent\nto which the loan was `crunched' in response to the credit risk shock. Increases in risk\nweights during economic downturns force capital-constrained banks that use the internal\nratings-based approach to deleverage in order to fulfill their capital requirements. Results\nfor Test 3 indicate that they do so by reducing the very assets that caused the increase\nin capital requirements: loans that are subject to IRB. Loans that are subject to the\nstandard approach, on the other hand, are relatively less affected.22\nTo account for potential selection concerns resulting from the order in which loan\nportfolios were shifted to IRB, our estimates include the relative size of a loan portfolio\n(i.e., Portfolio share, the share of bank j's loans in firm i's two-digit SIC industry sector) as\na control variable. The coefficient on Portfolio share is positive and--in most regressions--\ninsignificant. Hence, if anything, banks tend to adjust loans less in response to the shock\nin portfolios where they are relatively active. Thus, the selection of IRB loans would bias\nour estimates against finding a significant effect of the choice of the regulatory approach\non changes in loans over the event. Further evidence that mitigates concerns regarding\nselection is presented in Section 4.2.\nSo far, we have focused on changes in the size or volume of lending relationships which\nwe call the intensive margin. We can also ask whether IRB banks are more likely to end\nan existing relationship entirely if the loan is subject to IRB as compared with SA, the\nextensive margin. These tests are found in Table 4 where the dependent variable is a\ndummy variable, Exit, that equals one for loans that existed in the second quarter of\n2008 but that ceased to exist at some point following the event. The equations follow\nthe specifications for Test 3 in Equation (2). The coefficient for IRB loan is positive, but\ninsignificant in most cases, indicating that the effect of the regulatory approach is less\npronounced on the extensive as compared with the intensive margin of lending.23\nIn addition to the volume of lending, the approach used to determine capital charges\nmight also affect the price of lending, the interest rate charged on a loan. Since an\nincrease in firm PDs results in higher capital charges on IRB loans, banks might react\nby increasing the interest rate charged on these loans. We explore this possibility by\nestimating Equation (2) for Test 3 with the change in interest rate instead of the change\n22The magnitude of these effects is in line with evidence on aggregate lending provided by Aiyar et al.\n(2014). They find that an increase in capital requirements by 1 percentage point induces a fall in bank-\nlevel loan growth by 6.5 to 7.2 percentage points. Studies estimating the effect of higher bank capital\nratios on loan growth usually find somewhat smaller effects (see Carlson, Shan, and Warusawitharana\n23This is consistent with a finding by Jim\u00b4\nenez et al. (2013), who argue that the more moderate effect on\nthe extensive margin is due to a time lag, since lending relationships end only when all loans--including\nthose with a longer maturity--are fully repaid.\nin loans as the dependent variable. Results are summarized in Table 5. The coefficient\non the IRB loan dummy is positive, indicating that interest rates increase relatively more\non IRB loans, but the effect is small and statistically insignificant (column 1). This result\nholds if we add bank specific control variables (column 2), bank fixed effects (column 3),\nand firm fixed effects (column 4). These findings suggest that banks react to the increase\nin capital charges on IRB loans by reducing loan quantities instead of increasing interest\nrates.\n4.2 Risk weights and lending to small and medium enterprises\nIn this section, we exploit an institutional feature of the Basel regulation--the capital\ncharge discount for loans to SMEs--to address remaining concerns regarding the selection\nof IRB loans at the outset of our sample period. The idea behind the test is quite\nsimple: the slope of the mapping from PDs into risk weights is smaller for loans to\nSMEs as compared with loans to larger firms at any point of the mapping (see Figure 4).\nConsequently, capital charges for IRB loans to SMEs are less affected by the credit risk\nshock. We now examine whether the relative reduction of IRB loans compared with SA\nloans to the same firm is less pronounced for SMEs. In this way, we can provide evidence\non the pro-cyclicality of model-based capital regulation while systematically controlling\nfor the initial assignment of loans to the IRB group.\nAs a starting point, we restrict ourselves to loans subject to the IRB approach for\nwhich we have information on the firm's sales, and check whether the lending adjustment\nin response to the credit risk shock is related to the sales of the firm (Table 6). IRB loans\nto firms with lower sales are reduced less over the credit risk shock (column 1), while\nthere is no relationship between firm sales and adjustments in lending for loans under SA\n(column 2). Further, we find a significantly negative coefficient on the interaction between\nLog(firm sales) and the IRB loan dummy (column 3) that is robust to the inclusion of\nfirm fixed effects (column 4) and bank \u00d7 IRB fixed effects (column 5). This means that\nIRB banks reduce IRB loans to the same firm relatively more than SA loans, but less\nso if the loan benefits from the capital charge discount for SMEs. Specifically, we can\ncompare a firm with sales of e 25 million to a large firm with sales over e 50 million.\nThe IRB effect is 1.3 to 3.2 percentage points larger in magnitude for loans to the larger\nfirm which does not benefit from the capital charge discount (columns 3-5, bottom row).\nImportantly, these effects are not driven by the selection of IRB loans, as bank \u00d7 IRB\nfixed effects in column 5 systematically control for any potential difference between the\nSA and IRB pool of a specific bank. Changes in capital charges seem to exert a strong\ninfluence on the lending adjustment over the credit risk shock.\n4.3 Impact of bank, loan, and firm characteristics\nIn this section, we present further cross-sectional results. Specifically, we expect a stronger\nreduction in outstanding loans in response to the credit risk shock (a) for loans by banks\nwith a low capital ratio prior to the recession; (b) for large IRB loans that have a sub-\nstantial impact on bank capital charges when their PD deteriorates; and (c) for loans to\nfirms for which PDs are more likely to increase in the recession.\nHellwig (2010) argues that banks reduced buffers over minimum capital requirements\nto a bare minimum in an attempt to `economize on equity' prior to the crisis, and that\nthere was only limited scope for raising additional equity during the crisis. Consequently,\nwe expect that banks with initially lower capital ratios which are closer to the regulatory\nminimum will have a stronger reaction when capital requirements increase due to the\ncredit risk shock. We test this by introducing an interaction between IRB loan and the\nbank's initial equity ratio in column 1 and an interaction with a dummy variable for banks\nwith a higher than median pre-event equity ratio, High equity, in column 2 of Table 7.24\nThe significantly positive coefficient for the interaction in column 1 shows that the IRB\neffect is mitigated as the bank's pre-event equity ratio increases. Similarly, the positive\ninteraction coefficient in column 2 indicates that the effect of the regulatory approach\nis more pronounced for IRB loans from banks that had lower capital ratios prior to the\nevent. As shown at the bottom of the table, the magnitudes are large. For example,\nmoving from the 25th to the 75th percentile of Bank equity ratio, the stronger reduction\nof IRB loans is reduced by 3.1 percentage points (column 1).\nNext, we investigate whether the size of a loan has an influence on how it is affected\nby the credit risk shock. Our concern is that increases in risk weights for larger loans\nresult in larger increases in required capital and hence banks may respond more. To test\nthis, we calculate the bank's exposure to each loan by dividing the loan amount prior to\nthe shock by the bank's pre-event total assets. Alternatively, we take the absolute size\nof the loan instead of the relative exposure of the bank as a criterion. We then generate\ntwo dummy variables; the first, High exposure, takes the value one if the exposure of the\nbank to a certain loan is larger than the median exposure in our sample, and the second,\nLarge loan, takes the value one if the loan is larger than the median loan in our sample.\nIn contrast to the bank equity measures these variables are on the loan level, which is\nwhy we can include bank \u00d7 IRB fixed effects as in Section 4.2. We show the results in\ncolumns 3 and 4 of Table 7. The coefficients for the interaction terms are significantly\nnegative, indicating that the IRB effect is particularly pronounced for large exposures,\ni.e., for loans for which increases in risk estimates translate into relatively large increases\nin capital requirements. The effects are large; for example, the coefficient in column 3\nimplies that the IRB effect is 14.1 percentage points larger for loans to which the bank\nhas a larger than median exposure. This indicates the magnitude of potential real effects\nof model-based regulation. As the IRB effect is particularly pronounced for large loan\nexposures, effects on the aggregate firm level could be even larger than those on the loan\nlevel. We examine this issue in the next section.\nFinally, our tests in Section 4.1 assumed that the shock uniformly increased PDs for\nIRB loans. However, a recession hits firms heterogeneously, and capital requirements\nincrease the most for loans to firms whose PD increases the most. As explained before,\nrelating the observed changes in the PD to changes in lending is problematic, as the risk\nassessment and the lending decision of a bank are endogenous. Therefore we use a firm's\npre-shock profitability, measured by its ROA in 2007-08, since it is not directly affected\nby the banks' lending decision, but is likely to be observed and employed by the bank's\nanalysts in order to predict future changes in the PD. Data on firm ROA is available for\n24In principle, it would be possible to include firm fixed effects in this equation to control for firm-\nspecific credit demand shocks as before. However, such a specification requires that each firm has at least\nfour banking relationships in order to identify the coefficients.\n3,370 firms that have both SA and IRB loans. We interact the IRB loan dummy with\nthe Firm ROA or a dummy for firms with above median ROA, High ROA, and present\nregression results in column 5 and 6 of Table 7.25 As expected, the interaction terms\nare positive in both instances, although only the coefficient in column 5 is statistically\nsignificant. These findings are consistent with our main argument: IRB loans are reduced\nmore than SA loans to the same firm, especially if the firm has a lower ROA prior to\nthe event and is hence more likely to experience an increase in the PD that would affect\ncapital charges.\n5 Capital regulation and firms' overall access to funds\nIn this section we turn our attention to firms' overall access to funds. Specifically, we\nexamine whether the pro-cyclical effects on loan balances documented above persist at\nthe firm level. That is, are firms able to offset a reduction in loans from one bank by\nincreasing their borrowing from another bank? Did firms relying on IRB loans experience\na stronger reduction in aggregate loan supply? These questions are central for evaluating\nthe real sector effects of capital charges based on credit-specific risks.\nFirm-level results are shown in Table 8, where the event is defined as before and the\ndependent variable is the change in the logarithm of total loans to the firm. We start\nby estimating Equation (4) to determine the effect of the share of a firm's loans that\nare subject to IRB on the change in the firm's total outstanding loans using all 107,025\nfirms in our data (column 1 of Table 8).26 Firms with a larger share of loans subject to\nIRB prior to the event experienced larger reductions in total borrowing. The coefficient\nremains highly significant and even increases in magnitude if we include variables that\ncontrol for the average characteristics of a firm's lenders in column 2, and firm-level control\nvariables in the matched sample of 7,778 firms in columns 3 and 4. The coefficient on\nIRB loani\nin column 2 implies that a firm that had only IRB loans experienced a reduction\nin total loans that is 5.6 percent larger than the decline in loans for a firm that had only\nSA loans. This effect increases to 11.3 percent in the matched sample where we control\nfor firm level characteristics (column 4). Interestingly, these aggregate firm effects are\nlarge compared to those previously shown at the loan level. After a credit risk shock,\nfirms seem to be unable to compensate for the reduction in IRB loans by switching to SA\nloans. Furthermore, the stronger reduction of IRB loans documented at the loan level is\nparticularly pronounced for large loan exposures (see Section 4.3). It is likely that the\ncombination of these two effects is responsible for the sizable effect of model-based capital\nregulation on firms' overall access to funds.\nTo address potential differences in loan demand by firms that borrow from SA and\nIRB institutions, we restrict the sample to firms that have both SA and IRB loans from\nIRB banks, i.e., to the 7,159 firms we use for identification in Test 3. Although the sample\nis much smaller, there continues to be a significant impact of the share of a firm's loans\nfrom IRB banks that are subject to IRB (IRB loani\n\n) on changes in firms' aggregate\n25As ROA varies on the firm level, we can include firm fixed effects in addition to bank \u00d7 IRB fixed\neffects. The sample includes loans from SA banks; the sample size would otherwise be very small for\nTest 3 which would include SA and IRB loans from IRB banks.\n26This sample includes single-relationship firms as well as firms that have only SA loans or only IRB\nloans. For these firms, IRB loani\nis equal to 0 or 1, respectively.\nborrowing (Table 8, column 5). Again, the result is robust to the inclusion of weighted\nbank-level characteristics as well as firm-level characteristics (columns 6 to 8). The effect\nis economically meaningful: the firm at the 75th percentile of IRB loani\n\n(which had\n81.7 percent IRB loans) experienced a 3.0 to 4.6 percent larger reduction in aggregate\nloans than the firm at the 25th percentile (which had 42.6 percent IRB loans).\nFinally, we apply the Jim\u00b4\nenez et al. (2011) procedure described in Section 3.2 to adjust\nthe IRB effects for firm demand. The adjusted coefficients are shown at the bottom of the\ntable. The corrections are relatively small in columns 1-4; in columns 5-8 they reduce the\neffects by about one third. The corrections indicate that it is unlikely that our findings\nare driven by heterogeneity in firms' demand for credit. Overall, the results in Table 8\nprovide strong evidence for a significant effect of the regulatory classification of loans\nwithin IRB banks on aggregate firm borrowing following the credit risk shock.\nWe also examine whether a firm's share of IRB loans affected its aggregate borrowing\ncosts. We use the ratio of aggregate interest expenses to total borrowing from the balance\nsheet and income statement to measure average borrowing costs for the firm. Regression\nresults are summarized in Table 9. Column 1 indicates that firms obtaining a larger share\nof IRB loans experience a greater increase in capital cost over the shock. However, this\nresult vanishes once we include the average bank-level controls in column 2. In columns 3\nand 4 we reduce the sample to firms that have both SA and IRB loans from IRB banks in\norder to account for potential differences in firm demand as before. The coefficient for the\nIRB variable in the reduced sample, IRB loani\n\n, is insignificant in both regressions. There\nis little evidence that firms that have more loans subject to the IRB regulatory approach\nexperience significantly greater increases in capital costs over the credit risk shock. These\nresults suggest--along with the loan-level results in Section 4.1--that banks reacted to the\ncredit risk shock by adjusting the amounts of IRB loans outstanding in order to deleverage\nand fulfill regulatory requirements rather than increasing the cost of loans.\n6 Robustness and further results\nIn this section we relax some of the assumptions regarding our data and sample period\nto see if our results are robust. We find that our results on both the loan and firm level\nare not materially affected.\n6.1 Ordinary least square results\nOur results in Section 4.1 only include firms with multiple lending relationships, as this\nis a necessary condition for the inclusion of firm fixed effects. Here we include firms with\na single bank relationship and estimate the regressions with OLS. Results are presented\nin Table A.2 in the Appendix and are qualitatively similar to the fixed effect results. Co-\nefficients decrease in magnitude when we include single-relationship firms, which suggests\nthat the IRB effect is less pronounced for these firms.\n6.2 Confounding shocks and selection issues\nThe focus of our analysis is the differential adjustment of loans under different regulatory\napproaches in response to the credit risk shock. This shock was preceded by two related\nevents: the introduction of the Basel II approach at the beginning of 2007, a policy shock,\nand the banking crisis associated with problems in several 'Landesbanks' and commercial\nbanks. Our concern here is to show that our results reflect responses to the credit risk\nshock rather than delayed responses to earlier events. To begin, note that the policy shock\nand the credit risk shock work in opposite directions. Basel II reduced capital charges\nfor IRB loans and should therefore, ceteris paribus, increase lending on these loans. The\ncredit risk shock increased PDs and risk weights which increases capital charges and\nshould reduce lending. As a consequence, any lingering effect of the policy shock in our\nevent study should work against our findings.\nTo further explore the influence of prior events we conduct placebo tests to examine\nwhether there are differences in the adjustment of different types of loans prior to the credit\nrisk shock. Specifically, we estimate difference-in-difference specifications similar to our\nTest 3, but using alternative time horizons. For example, we check whether loans under\nso on.27 Columns 1-4 of Table 10 reveal no significant differences in the adjustment of the\ndifferent types of loans prior to the credit risk shock in 2008Q3. If anything, prior to the\nLehman collapse, loans using IRB were increased relative to loans using SA, as indicated\nby the positive (but insignificant) coefficient in column 1. Overall, these placebo tests\nmake us confident that pre-trends, i.e. the delayed effects of the policy shock in 2007 or\nother events, are unlikely to be affecting our results.\nWe noted that several German banks had problems already in 2007 and might have\nreacted by adjusting their loans prior to our event. Our main identification test includes\nbank fixed effects and thus accounts for bank heterogeneity around the event in a sys-\ntematic manner. However, to avoid any confusion between the banking crisis and the\nreal sector event, we can start the pre-shock period in late 2006 instead of early 2008.\nIn column 5 of Table 10 we show results for Test 3 where the dependent variable is the\ndifference in the logarithm of loans between late 2006 and our usual post-event period.\nAlthough there are substantially fewer loans in this data set, the core result is maintained:\nloans that were moved to IRB before the shock decline relatively more. Alternatively, we\ncan remove from the sample the financial institutions that faced difficulty prior to the\nLehman shock. These are the `Landesbanks' identified by Puri et al. (2011): WestLB,\nBayernLB, and SachsenLB and the commercial banks, IKB and Hypo Real Estate. The\ncoefficient on the IRB dummy remains significantly negative (column 6) when loans from\nthese institutions are excluded.\nOur testing framework acknowledges that each bank-firm relationship was subject to\neither SA or IRB regulation at the time of the credit risk shock and does not exploit the\nvariation over time in regulatory treatment. Due to the gradual phase-in of Basel II, loans\nwere moved from SA to IRB throughout our sample period which means that the policy\nshock continues to affect certain loans as our event occurs. To avoid any confusion, we\nre-estimated Test 3 on the sample of loans that are consistently classified as either SA or\nIRB throughout the period. The result with this smaller sample in column 7 of Table 10\nconfirms that IRB loans are reduced significantly more than SA loans to the same firm.\n27As always, loans are classified as SA or IRB according to the regulatory approach used at the\nbeginning of 2008, the first quarter for which such information is available. As we can only include loans\nthat existed at the beginning of 2008, the sample becomes smaller the further we go back in time.\n6.3 Examining loans that were moved from SA to IRB\nWe develop an additional test that exploits the timing of the change in regulatory treat-\nment of individual loans. Our data set allows us to identify the point in time when a\nspecific PD increased. Thus, we can test whether a loan is adjusted following a change in\nPD and whether the adjustment depends on the regulatory approach used for the loan.\nAs noted before, banks' assessment of PDs and their lending reaction might be endoge-\nnous, which is why we prefer to collapse our data around the credit risk shock in our main\nspecifications. Nevertheless, we believe that the additional tests presented here can add\nfurther insights.\nResults in Table 11 show how loans are adjusted in response to a change in PD,\ndepending on the regulatory approach used for the loan. The sample includes only loans\nthat were subject to SA at the beginning of 2008 and shifted to IRB throughout our sample\nperiod, and only loan-quarter observations for which we observe an increase in PD. The\ndependent variable is the difference between the logarithm of loans two quarters following\nthe rise in PD and the logarithm of loans in the quarter of the rise in PD. Column 1 shows\nthat loans are reduced significantly more following a rise in PD if they have already been\nmoved to IRB. While the average SA loan is reduced by 2.3 percent following a rise in PD,\nthe average IRB loan is reduced by 3.9 percent. This result is robust to the inclusion of\nperiod fixed effects that control for the time at which the rise in PD occurred (column 2).\nNext, we further constrain the sample and include only loans for which we observe at least\ntwo increases in PD: one when the loan was still subject to SA and another one when the\nloan had already been moved to IRB. In this case we can include bank \u00d7 firm fixed effects\nand examine whether--for the same bank-firm relationship--the adjustment in lending is\ngreater when the loan has already been shifted to IRB. We find that this is indeed the\ncase: following an increase in PD, loan amounts for the same bank-firm relationship are\nreduced by about 3 percent more if the relationship has already been switched to IRB\n(column 3). This result is robust to the inclusion of bank \u00d7 period fixed effects that\naccount for time-varying shocks at the bank level.\n6.4 Addressing the e 1.5 million reporting threshold\nThe German credit register contains a e 1.5 million reporting threshold that could po-\ntentially bias our estimates at the firm level. In particular, it could be that we find a\nstronger effect at the firm level because we are missing out on smaller loans that are likely\nto be SA loans. In this section, we report tests that suggest that the threshold is not a\nserious concern.\nFirst, we use the matched sample with data from the firm balance sheet to measure\nthe change in aggregate firm borrowing. That is, the change in loans from the balance\nsheet is the dependent variable in the firm-level regression instead of the change in loans\nfrom the credit register. Thus, we ensure that we do not miss out on any loans for the\nfirms in the matched sample. The coefficient for the IRB variable in column 1 of Table 12\nis significantly negative and is similar in magnitude to the coefficient in the main test.\nSecond, we use the matched sample to calculate a coverage ratio defined as the ratio\nbetween aggregate loans in the credit register and total loans on the firm's balance sheet.\nFor firms in the matched sample, the mean coverage ratio is 73 percent, and the median is\n74 percent. In column 2 of Table 12 we restrict the sample to firms for which the coverage\nratio is above the median. Any bias should be less severe for these firms as most of their\nloans are in the credit register. The coefficient on IRB loani\nis even larger in magnitude\nfor the restricted sample as compared with the full sample. Next, we include only firms\nthat are larger than the median firm in our sample (in terms of total assets), as larger\nfirms tend to have larger loans that are more likely to be recorded in the credit register.\nAgain, the coefficient on this restricted sample is larger than the coefficient for the full\nsample (column 3).\nLastly, we use a procedure suggested by Ongena, T\u00a8\numer-Alkan, and Westernhagen\n(2012) to account for the fact that IRB loani\naccounts only for those loans of a firm that\nare recorded in the credit register. Specifically, for each firm, we estimate the amount of\nloans that are not recorded in the credit register by the difference between total balance\nsheet loans and total loans in the credit register. For this remainder, we use two extreme\nassumptions to calculate new versions of the IRB variable. For the first version, we\nassume that all of the unobserved loans are subject to SA. For the second version, we\nassume that all of the unobserved loans are subject to IRB. Re-estimating the firm-level\nregressions using the alternative IRB variables gives us an idea about the maximum size\nof any potential bias arising from a misclassification of IRB loani\n. Results are presented\nin columns 4-5 of Table 12. The coefficient for the IRB variable remains significantly\nnegative in both cases, and in the more likely case where unobserved loans are classified\nas SA loans, coefficients in the firm-level regressions become even larger in magnitude.\nOverall, this evidence leads us to conclude that it is unlikely that the reporting threshold\nin the credit register induces a bias that makes our findings stronger.\n7 Conclusion and discussion\nIn this paper we develop identification strategies that enable us to estimate how capital\nregulation based on individual asset risk affects bank lending. We exploit the gradual\nintroduction of Basel II in Germany and use the shock that accompanied the collapse of\nLehman Brothers in September 2008 as an event that increased credit risk in the German\nmarket for corporate loans. Our main finding is that the counter-cyclicality of capital\ncharges based on individual asset risk has a significant pro-cyclical effect on the lending\nbehavior of banks as well as a considerable effect on firms' aggregate ability to borrow. For\na given firm, loans by different IRB banks are reduced by 2.1 to 3.9 percent more when\ninternal ratings (IRB) instead of fixed risk weights (SA) are used to determine capital\ncharges. The effect is even stronger on the aggregate firm level: firms that had only IRB\nloans prior to the event experienced a reduction in total loans that was about 5 to 10 per-\ncent larger than the reduction for firms that had only SA loans. Thus, microprudential\nmodel-based capital regulation has sizeable macroeconomic consequences.\nOur findings have important policy implications for the design of bank capital regu-\nlation. The new Basel III framework includes measures that are meant to address the\nproblem of pro-cyclicality. Most importantly, Basel III introduces a counter-cyclical cap-\nital buffer that requires banks to build up additional capital reserves in times of excessive\ncredit growth which can be used to satisfy capital requirements when economic condi-\ntions deteriorate. Our findings could be interpreted as justification for such a measure.\nHowever, counter-cyclical capital buffers reduce pro-cyclicality only if the supervisor has\nsufficient foresight about future economic conditions. Unexpected shocks to credit risk\n(e.g., shocks that originate abroad such as the one analyzed in this paper) cannot be an-\nticipated and, therefore, regulators cannot always pre-empt such shocks by setting buffer\nrates accordingly. Furthermore, Basel III introduces capital conservation buffers. These\nare meant to address the problem of pro-cyclicality by reducing the pressure on banks\nto deleverage when economic conditions deteriorate. However, they also do not solve the\nbasic problem of pro-cyclical capital regulation, as their release has severe consequences\nfor banks, and markets might not accept lower capital ratios when economic conditions\ndeteriorate. One measure that would reduce the problem of pro-cyclicality is a simple\nleverage ratio. However, with a leverage ratio the link between capital charges and ac-\ntual asset risk would vanish. Making a final judgment on the efficiency of risk-based\ncapital requirements requires further research on the costs and benefits of this regulatory\napproach.\nReferences\nAcharya, V. (2009).

This figure illustrates how we use\nthe multiple bank relationships of a typical firm for identification in the empirical analysis.\nSuppose a firm has three loans: one IRB loan from an IRB bank, one SA loan from an IRB\nbank, and one SA loan from an SA bank.

Test 2 includes only SA loans and investigates whether there is\na difference between SA loans from SA banks and SA loans from IRB banks.

It is equal to 1 if the loan from bank j to firm i is subject to IRB and equal to 0 if the loan is\nsubject to the standard approach. Log(loan size) is equal to the logarithm of average loan size for the\ndefined in Table 1. The sample includes all loans from IRB banks in columns 1-3 and the loans to firms\nwith multiple lending relationships used for identification in Test 3 in columns 4-6. Robust standard\nerrors adjusted for clustering at the bank and and at the firm level are reported in parentheses.

We take the credit risk shock in late 2008\nas an event and collapse all quarterly data for a given loan into a single pre- and post-event period. Data are restricted to (a) loans that are larger than e\n1.5 million (b) loans from commercial, state, or cooperative banks that are subject to the Basel II capital regulation (c) loans that have an observation in\nboth the pre- and the post-shock period. The dependent variable is the difference in Log(loans) between the pre- and the post-event period. In columns 1\nto 3 we use observations for firms that have at least one loan from an SA bank and one loan from an IRB bank or loans from at least two distinct IRB\nbanks (Test 1). In columns 4 to 6 the sample is restricted to SA loans and includes only firms that have at least one SA loan from an SA bank and at least\none SA loan from an IRB bank or SA loans from at least two distinct IRB banks (Test 2). Finally, columns 7 to 9 include only loans from IRB banks and\nonly firms that have at least one SA loan and at least one IRB loan from an IRB bank (Test 3). The IRB impact at the bottom of the table in columns 1-2\nand 4 gives the difference in percentage points in the reduction in lending between loans from the average IRB bank (for which Share IRB equals 0.62)\nand loans from an SA bank (for which Share IRB equals 0); the difference between loans from IRB banks and loans from SA banks in column 3; and the\ndifference in percentage points between loans under IRB and loans under SA in columns 7-9.

The dependent variable is the difference in Log(loans) between the pre-\nand the post-event periods. The variable Log(firm sales) is equal to the logarithm of total sales for firms\nwith a turnover less than e 50 million and equal to the logarithm of 50 million for firms with a larger\nturnover; it accounts for the capital charge discount given to loans to SMEs. The Size impact at the\nbottom of the table gives the difference in percentage points in the relative reduction of IRB loans to\nfirms with total sales of e 50 million and firms with total sales of e 25 million. Robust standard errors\nadjusted for clustering at the bank and at the firm level are reported in parentheses. Note: * indicates\nstatistical significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% level and *** at the 1% level.\nDependent variable:  Log(loans)\nIRB loans SA loans All loans All loans All loans\nFirm, bank, and loan characteristics\nThese regressions examine the interaction between the IRB effect and bank, loan and firm characteristics.\nAs before, the dependent variable is the difference in Log(loans) between the pre- and the post-event\nperiod. In columns 1 and 2 we interact IRB loan with the Bank equity ratio (column 1) or with High\nequity, a dummy that indicates whether the bank equity ratio is above the median (column 2). Bank\ncontrol variables are the same as in previous tables. In column 3 we interact IRB loan with High exposure,\na dummy that indicates whether a bank's exposure to a specific loan (defined as the loan amount divided\nby the bank's total assets prior to the shock) is larger than the median, and in column 4 with Large loan,\na dummy that indicates whether a specific loan is larger than the median loan in our sample. Columns 5\nand 6 use a matched sample of 14,336 loans to 3,370 firms for which we are able to obtain balance sheet\ninformation and that have at least one SA loan and one IRB loan. We interact IRB loan with the Firm\nROA (column 5) or a dummy that indicates whether the firm's pre-shock ROA is higher than the median\n(column 6). The Differential impact at the bottom of the table gives the difference in percentage points\nin the relative reduction of IRB loans where the respective cross-sectional dummy is equal to 1 and IRB\nloans where it is equal to 0 (columns 2-4), or the difference between IRB loans where the respective\ncross-sectional variable is at its 75th percentile and IRB loans where it is at its 25th percentile (columns 1\nand 5). Robust standard errors adjusted for clustering at the bank and at the firm level are reported in\nparentheses.

As before we collapse our data into single\npre- and post-event time periods. The dependent variable is the change in the logarithm of a firm's total amount of loans around the event. IRB loan\ngives the share of a firm's loans that are subject to IRB. The variable IRB loan \ngives the share of a firm's loans received from IRB banks that are subject\nto IRB. For tests that include this variable the sample is restricted to firms that have at least one IRB loan and at least one SA loan from an IRB bank:\ni.e., firms for which IRB loan \ntakes values unequal to 0 or 1. The IRB impact at the bottom of the table gives the difference in percentage points in the\nreduction in lending between firms that have only IRB loans and firms that have only SA loans (columns 1-4), or firms where IRB loan \npercentile and firms where it is at its 25th percentile (columns 5-8). Further, the bottom of the table presents coefficients on the IRB variables corrected\nfor firm demand effects by applying the procedure described in Section 3.2. Robust standard errors adjusted for clustering at the main bank level are\nreported in parentheses. Note: * indicates statistical significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% level and *** at the 1% level.\nDependent variable:  Log(firm loans)\nIRB loan \nFirm capital cost\nThe table examines how changes in a firm's capital cost over the event depend on the regulatory approach\nused for its loans. The dependent variable is the change in a firm's capital cost (defined as interest paid\nover total loans) between the pre- and the post-event period. The variable IRB loan gives the share of\na firm's loans that are subject to IRB. The variable IRB loan \ngives the share of a firm's loans received\nfrom IRB banks that are subject to IRB. For tests that include this variable the sample is restricted to\nfirms that have at least one IRB loan and at least one SA loan from an IRB bank: i.e., firms for which\nthe variable IRB loan \ntakes values unequal to 0 or 1. Robust standard errors adjusted for clustering\nat the main bank level are reported in parentheses. Note: * indicates statistical significance at the 10%\nlevel, ** at the 5% level and *** at the 1% level.\nDependent variable:  Firm capital cost\nIRB loan \nFirm controls YES YES YES YES\nBank controls NO YES NO YES\nLoan-level robustness\nThe table contains placebo tests to control for pre-event trends as well as robustness tests regarding the\nevent definition. Columns 1-4 present results that are similar to our main test but use alternative time\nhorizons. The dependent variable is the change in the logarithm of loans between 2007 and 2008, between\n2006 and 2007, and so on. Loans are classified as SA or IRB loans according to the regulatory approach\nused at the beginning of 2008Q1, the first quarter for which this information is available. As we can only\ninclude loans that exist at the beginning of 2008, the sample becomes smaller and smaller the further we\ngo back in time. In column 5 we use the last two quarters of 2006 instead of the first two quarters of 2008\nas the pre-event period. In column 6 we exclude all loans from German banks that had problems already\nin 2007. In column 7 we exclude all loans that were moved from SA to IRB throughout our sample period\nand restrict the sample to those firms that still have at least one SA loan and at least one IRB loan from\ndifferent IRB banks. Bank controls are the same as in previous tables. Robust standard errors adjusted\nfor clustering at the bank and at the firm level are reported in parentheses. Note: * indicates statistical\nsignificance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% level and *** at the 1% level.\nDependent variable:  Log(loans)\nPlacebo tests Additional robustness tests\nBank controls NO NO NO NO YES YES YES\nActual changes in PD and lending\nThe table examines how loans are adjusted following a rise in the PD, and how the adjustment depends\non the regulatory approach. The sample is restricted to loan-quarter observations for which we observe\nan increase in the PD attributed to a specific loan. The dependent variable is the difference between\nthe logarithm of loans two quarters following the rise in PD and the logarithm of loans in the quarter of\nthe rise in PD. In columns 1 and 2, the sample is restricted to loans that were moved from SA to IRB\nthroughout our sample period. In columns 3 and 4 the sample is further restricted to loans for which we\nobserve at least two increases in the PD, one when the loan was still subject to SA and another one when\nthe loan had already been moved to IRB. The IRB impact at the bottom of the table gives the difference\nin percentage points in the reduction in lending between loans under IRB and loans under SA. Robust\nstandard errors adjusted for clustering at the bank and at the firm level are reported in parentheses.\nNote: * indicates statistical significance at the 10% level, ** at the 5% level and *** at the 1% level.\nDependent variable:  Log(loans) around the PD change\nPeriod FE NO YES YES --\nBank \u00d7 Firm FE NO NO YES YES\nBank \u00d7 Period FE NO NO NO YES\nFirm-level robustness\nThe table shows robustness tests for the firm-level results. In column 1, we replace the dependent variable\nobtained from the credit register with the difference in the logarithm of balance sheet loans as obtained\nfrom the Amadeus database. In column 2, the sample is restricted to firms for which aggregate loans in\nthe credit register cover at least 75 percent of balance sheet loans obtained from the Amadeus database.\nIn column 3, the sample is restricted to loans to firms that are larger (in terms of total assets) than the\nmedian firm in our sample. In columns 4 and 5, we apply a procedure similar to Ongena et al. (2012).\nWe calculate the difference between balance sheet loans from Amadeus and aggregate loans in the credit\nregister to obtain the remainder of loans for which we do not have information on the regulatory approach.\nWe make two extreme assumptions regarding the regulatory approach used for these remaining loans to\ncalculate adjusted IRB loan variables. First, we assume that they are all subject to SA (column 4), and\nsecond that they are all subject to IRB (column 5). Robust standard errors adjusted for clustering at the\nmain bank level are reported in parentheses.

The change in Log(loans) for a bank-firm relationship is the\ndependent variable. Columns 1, 4 and 7 restrict the sample to firms with multiple lending relationships as in Tables 3, so that we are able to compare the\ncoefficients from the FE estimation with the coefficient from the OLS regression. As OLS does not rely on identification within the same firm, we include\nalso firms with only one lending relationships (or with only IRB loans or only SA loans) in the remaining columns. The IRB impact at the bottom of the\ntable gives the difference in percentage points in the reduction in lending between loans from the average IRB bank (for which Share IRB equals 0.62)\nand loans from an SA bank in columns 1-2, and the percentage difference between IRB and SA banks or loans in the remaining columns.
