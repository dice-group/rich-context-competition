    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article will look at the impact that mobile technologies have had on the ability of people to document their everyday\nlives. What is important to note about this documentation is that it has become a public display of events and experiences via\nmediated content. This documentation becomes more interesting to observe when it is put in context of how people can now\nrecord their travels. This \"public memory\" of private travel is assisted via mobile technologies with applications designed to\nrecord locations through Global Positioning System data and mediated content. After the documentation, the consumption\nof this content is conducted through social media services and other public outlets as opposed to the traditional means of\nshowing where people have traveled via postcards, slides, and souvenirs. Through a mixed-method study, this process of\ndocumentation is analyzed via the thematic dichotomies that emerged throughout the course of surveys and interviews. This\narticle will explore this contrast between the digital and physical through an analysis of the \"traditional tourist\" versus the\n\"archiver of experiences.\" Finally, the impact of this documentation will be framed in the context of mobile communication.\n",

Some people are applying the\nchannels of communication to become more of a self-docu-\nmenting mode. This self-documenting mode is comprised of\nwriting posts and comments and recording mediated content\nfor the purpose of recording the experiences and mundane\nactions of everyday in a way that can be recalled or searched\nvia a public social feed. This feed of information represents\na kind of \"public memory\" for the individual who posted the\ncontent.\nFor the purpose of this analysis, the term public memory\nis simply shorthand for posting content onto a mediated plat-\nform where one of the purposes of posting is to journal or\nnote information that has a personal significance. For exam-\nple, one could take pictures of their meals not because they\nare showing the dinner to their friends but rather keeping a\nrecorded journal of their favorite meals to remember them\nlater. In this way, there is not necessarily an imagined audi-\nence that the individual is focusing their content toward, but\nrather it is designed to be an online scrapbook.\nThe purpose of this work is to look at how mobile media\nis changing the nature of the collection of memory via digital\nartifacts created by the hybrid of services that represent the\nsocial and hyper-local interactions. These interactions are\nbest exemplified through the use of the SoLoMo (social,\nlocal, mobile) category of applications for mobile devices,\nespecially services such as FourSquare and Instagram\n(Nelson, 2013). These services will be discussed within the\ncontext of their impact on public memory, specifically how\nthey bridge the gap between the digital and the physical, the\ngap between an artifact and a souvenir, and its ability to com-\nbine the role of the tourist and the archiver. The remaining\nparts of this article will define these terms and describe the\nimpact that the mobile media space has had on these\nconcepts.\nPublic Memory and Rhetoric\nWhile this article can only provide a basic understanding of\nmemory as a theoretical concept, there are two elements that\ncan be focused on to help explore this connection between\nthe transmission of personal public memory via social net-\nworks and the binary nature of those creations as\ndescribed in the introduction of this work. Both of these the-\nmatic elements can be explored by looking at the rhetorical\n1Ohio Northern University, Ada, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nShane Tilton, Assistant Professor of Multimedia Journalism, Ohio\nEmail: s-tilton@onu.edu\nMobile Public Memory: The (Digital/\nPhysical) (Artifacts/Souvenirs) of the\n(Archiver/Tourist)\nShane Tilton1\n Keywords\nmemory, artifacts, travel, mobile communication, mixed-method research\n2 SAGE Open\nelements of memory and the psychological elements of\nshared memories/shared social experiences.\nMost of the nominative constructions of the term public\nmemory tend to be embedded in the rhetorical aspects of com-\nmunication. This idea of \"public memory\" goes to the prac-\ntice of public remembrance to cultural events. Condit (1985)\nframed this concept within Aristotle's inartistic elements of\nrhetoric. Primarily, Condit made the argument that public\nmemory performed an epideictic element of rhetoric as public\nmemory was normally invoked through the ceremonial\nspeeches surrounding a particular event (in Condit's example,\nthe Boston Massacre). Communication actions using epideic-\ntic discourses allow for a definition of a public event by a\nspeaker via the sharing understanding of the context of the\nevent toward the larger whole shaped by the speaker. The\nspeaker shaped shared symbols to have a community focus on\none particular theme or image. The nature of these actions is\nnormally for the purpose of display or entertaining the com-\nmunity. Those commemorative discourses are normally for a\nshared audience with a mass understanding.\nAnother aspect of public memory is the sense of placement.\nAccording to Dickinson, Blair, and Ott (2010), the construction\nof the public memory is tied to the rhetorical art of memory in\ncontemporary public culture. Public memory exists \"at the\nnexus of rhetoric, memory, and place\" as this concept repre-\nsents a deep complexity of events as they were occurring. The\nconnection between rhetoric and public memory was enhanced\nby the works of Maurice Halbwachs (1992) and Michel\nFoucault, Bouchard, and Simon (1977) as their work focused\non the forms of memory, which tended to be broken up and\ndefined by the cultural norms and the \"language of the mem-\nory\" in the mind of society. Place within this context notes the\nterminologies of spaces, spatiality, sites, territory and\ndeterritorializing, border cultures, the urban and exurban, social\nlocations, geographies, zones, the archive . . . to reckon with the\ncomplexities of what anyone might mean when s/he deploys one\nPublic memory as a concept has a broad definition because\nthe theoretical discourse around the term public memory has\nsome semantical weight behind it. The definition fragments as\nnewer communication and humanities theorists explore the\ncentral concept of memory. In communication, memory is one\nof the foundations of rhetoric. This foundation adds to this dis-\ncussion of the chosen definition of \"public memory\" for this\narticle because it exemplifies the need to observe the cultural\naspects of memory. The technological aspects of memory\nrelated to the personal encoding and decoding of information\ncan best be theorized in the scientific/psychological realm.\nPublic Memory and Technological\nInfluence\nThe reason that the technological support of memory is\nnoted for this article is because the nature of memory distorts\nwithout some method of recording. One of the major influ-\nences to this sense of memory is social influence. People will\nnormally conform to the \"erroneous recollections of the\ngroup, producing both long-lasting and temporary errors,\neven when their initial memory was strong and accurate\"\nThis representation of communal public memory can be\ninfluenced through the normal discourse of communication\nactions or through social interactions. The record of an event\ncan be \"protected\" from these social influences with a well-\nconstructed archival system designed to limit this layer of\nsocial static and misinterpretation (Jacobsen, Punzalan, &\nThis archival element to the technological influence on\nthe public memory has often been framed in the scientific/\npsychological realm as a version of collective memory. This\ncollective memory represents \"an inherently mediated phe-\nnomenon . . . as much a result of conscious manipulation as\naspect of collective memory means that the dissemination of\nevents comes from channels of communication and mes-\nsages embedded in those channels. Under the traditional\nunderstanding of these channels of communication, the mes-\nsages related to collective memory encoded in these channels\nare often placed into these \"linear, one-way channels of\ndescription\" (Hall, 2013). New media channels create a more\ncomplete collective memory as the artifacts of the events are\nplaced in a shared space with the purpose of \"making claims\nabout the subjective experience, as if claiming that a given\nrepresentation is a authentic recollection (neither perception\nnor imagination)\" (Haye, 2012, p. 27). This representation is\ncrafted through the co-creation of the meaning of memories\nplaced within the shared space under the guise that most of\nthe artifacts added to the shared space come with their own\nset of bias and positional aspects. There is a sense of social\nstatic and misinterpretation can exist with this space, but\nthere are embedded check and balances that can normalize\nthose elements of distortion.\nThis version of public memory described in this article is\nnot a representation of the communal public memory as col-\nlective memory, but rather the publication of private or semi-\nprivate events (e.g., traveling) into a semi-public or public\nsphere (e.g., Instagram) as a way of remembering the experi-\nence and categorizing the elements of the experience via the\nnorms of the mode of communication (e.g., hashtags and\ncheck-ins). Hashtags have the potential to act as the \"guide-\nposts\" toward the shared spaces described earlier as they\nfunction as a public link to a common set of pictures, posts,\nand links that is hosted within the social networks of choice.\nThe common vernacular of hashtags has a shared lexicon\nwith significance and meaning. Those tags place individual\nartifacts connected to the tag within a framework designed to\neither support a community or maintain a dialogue around a\ncommon theme or event (Alper, 2013). The second aspect of\nthe hashtags that is rarely discussed is their ability to act as\npersonal organizational tools. A person can search through\nhis or her own feeds via typing his or her username and the\nselected hashtags to find post with a significant importance\n(e.g., the first trip abroad). These elements of selective filter-\ning influenced the creation of the methods used for this\nresearch.\nMethod\nThe data from this article come from mixed-methods\napproach using a survey and follow-up interview.Asnowball\nsample technique was used that led to a sample size of 98\npeople (Goodman, 1961). A snowball sample was used due\nto the point of analysis. The problematic in question is within\nthe range of those who travel and use SoLoMo to document\ntheir travel. As this would be considered a specific popula-\ntion, the use of the snowball sample seemed appropriate.\nThe surveys included 12 prompts on a 9-point Likert-type\nscale. Those prompts focused on the use of social networks\nand the tools used to access those social networks. In addi-\ntion, there were 10 prompts on a 7-point Likert-type scale\nthat focused on audience awareness, travel practices, and\ncultural awareness. The rationale for conducting the survey\nwas to make sure that the interview questions would fit the\n\"real world\" as understood by the people and at the same\ntime would eliminate possible personal bias. The two differ-\nent types of Likert-type scales were required for this research\nas the 9-point Likert-type scale prompts related to temporal\nelements (once a year, once a month, 2 or 3 times a month,\nonce a week, 2 or 3 times a week, once a day, 2 or 3 times a\nday, every hour, and multiple times an hour) to get a sense of\nthe survey taker relationship between themselves and the\ntools of posting (technology and services), while the 7-point\nLikert-type scale deals with the perceptions of survey takers\ntoward the tools of posting and thus had a \"more traditional\"\nset of ranges within the scale (strongly disagree, disagree,\ndisagree slightly, neither agree or disagree, agree slightly,\nagree, and strongly agree).\nA structured interview was conducted after the survey was\ncompleted. The interviews ranged from 15 to 20 min. The\ninterviewee was asked a few ethnographic questions that\nclosely resembled a \"guided ethnography\" (Tilton, 2012),\nwith the exception that the researcher would not be there to\nobserve them as they used their mobile devices. Interview\nquestions primarily dealt with how they use their mobile\ndevices when they traveled and whether they altered their doc-\numentation practices because of the SoLoMo applications.\nTo identify participants, the following message was sent\nvia Facebook feed and several group pages that dealt with\nacademic research:\nFacebook Hivemind: I'm looking to interview about 30 people\nabout their use of FourSquare and Instagram, especially how\nthey use it when they travel. If you are interested in being\ninterviewed, please message me. If you are not interested in\nbeing interviewed, please share this.\nIn addition, an abbreviated version of this call was sent\nvia Twitter. From this original call, 49 responses were\nreceived. From those requests, the respondents were asked if\nthey knew anybody else that would fit both of the criteria.\nFrom those requests, there were 49 more responses. Between\nthe two groups, the total sample size was 98.\nData Analysis\nThe sample size included 64 women and 34 men. Four of the\nresearch participants were college students, and 2 of the\nolder participants were retired. All of the other participants\nwere employed, with 16 of them being employed in social\nmedia/marketing-related positions. The participants all live\nin the United States, and the pool includes individuals from\ncities in the Northeast (Washington, DC; Boston, MA; New\nYork, NY; Arlington, VA), the Southeast (Raleigh, NC;\nChapel Hill, NC; Charlotte, NC; Atlanta, GA; Kennesaw,\nGA; St. Augustine, FL), the Midwest (Chicago, IL;\nCincinnati, OH; Indianapolis, IN), and the Pacific Northwest\n(Seattle, WA; Portland, OR; Central Washington state).\nThe interviewees were frequent users of FourSquare,\nInstagram, or both. Frequent users were defined as people\nwho had more than 100 posts on one of the sites and had\nchecked in at least once in the previous 3 days. Of the survey\npopulation of 98 people, there were 26 people who fit this\ncharacteristic. Six of the participants were interviewed face-\nto-face. Seventeen people were interviewed using Skype and\nthree people were interviewed using a phone with no video.\nThe interviewer did not notice an appreciable difference\nbetween the face-to-face and Skype/phone interviews. A\ngrounded theory approach was used throughout the data col-\nlection as a way of maintaining balance within the instru-\nment between a loose interpretation of the data and a narrow\ndeconstruction of the interviewee's statements (Charmaz,\nThe interviews were transcribed and placed within an\nopen coding procedure. There were extensive notes taken to\nencode the interviews in a way that helped overlay the analy-\nsis of the survey \"on top of\" the transcription of the inter-\nviews. Throughout the back and forth of interviewing and\ncoding, the data were organized into categories and eventu-\nally grouped categories based on thematic similarities. The\ncoding included multiple themes that emerged from the data.\nThose themes were gathered by transcribing the 26 inter-\nviews, for a total of 10 hr of interviews. The transcripts of\nthose interviews were then coded to examine for common\nthemes. The researcher was the lone coder for the process.\nThe common themes were examined for patterns consistent\nwith the trend found in the analysis of the surveys. Finally,\nthose common themes were framed within the context of the\ncurrent research in the field. The artifacts from this coding\nand selection process will be shown in the impact sections of\nthe article. For the purpose of this article, the focus will be on\nthree primary thematic dissidences that arose in the data.\n4 SAGE Open\nThe next two sections deal with the analysis of the sur-\nveys and interviews as a means of framing the thematics at\nthe end of this work.\nSurvey Analysis\nAs this was a mixed-method study, the analysis took on two\nseparate elements, an analysis of the survey and the coding\nanalysis for thematic elements of the interview. The initial\nrationale for this process was to reinforce the qualitative\nresearch and analysis with the analysis of quantitative instru-\nment. The survey instruments allowed for a clearer picture of\nthe people completing the interview process and better iden-\ntified the limitations that may be present in an interview that\nthe researcher would not be aware of.\nOne of the most interesting data points that came to light\nfrom the survey was with the prompt \"I use my mobile\nphone.\" All 98 of the participants responded by marking they\nused their phone once a day or more. Of the 98, 79 partici-\npants marked that they used their mobile phones once every\nhour, as noted in Table 1. This seems to be in line with other\nsimilar research dealing with current usage of mobile phones\nThe next point of analysis is the documentation practices\nof the sample population during their travels. The sample\npopulation was divided between those who fit the character-\nistics of the interviewee pool (n = 26) and those who did not\n(n = 72). From these data, there was little difference in the\ndocumentation and souvenir practices of those who were\ninterviewed versus those who were not. In terms of the ana-\nlog aspects of travel, both groups tended to buy souvenirs\nabout half of the times they travel. As noted in Table 2, more\noften those purchases would be for themselves over family\nand friends. In addition, this group was more likely to travel\nalone than with friends or family.\nThe final point of analysis from the survey would be the\nposting practices of the sample population. The only point of\ndivergence between the interviewee and non-interviewee\nthat stands out is their awareness of their audiences when the\npost content about their travels. Those in the interviewee\ngroup were less likely to be concerned about their audience\nwhen posted travel content on their social media feeds com-\npared with the non-interviewee group. This point of diver-\ngence is noted in Table 3.\nThis point of divergence helped shape some of the inter-\nview instrument to find out what the interviewees focused on\nwhen posted content from their trips.\nInterview Analysis\nWith a smaller interview pool, it was necessary to craft the\nquestions to not only work with the larger problematic but\nalso the element raised during the survey regarding audience\nawareness. This major point of separation between those\nwho were being interviewees and non-interviewees leads to\na deductive approach of interviewing and analysis\n(Schadewitz & Jachna, 2007). The questions raised during\nthe interview focused on the interviewee's understanding of\nmemory and their audience awareness.\nFrom the analysis of both methods, a series of thematic\ndichotomies emerged that positioned the collection of digi-\ntal artifacts while traveling into uses and gratifications\npresent when using any online services, especially those\nservices that can act as \"catalysts for personal narrative\nand recall\" (Viegas, boyd, Nguyen, Potter, & Donath,\nTable 1.

A person can see the Grand Canyon in front of\nhim or her while taking the picture of it on a digital camera.\nThe farther you move away from the physical location, the\nmore the digital representation of that space becomes the\n\"authentic\" symbol of your experience at that space. The\nInstagram picture allows the person to experience the feel-\nings of being in the location through a combination of\nobserving the picture with the personally embedded textual\nand location data within the picture. The comments attached\nto the picture become the \"vox populi\" of the overall impres-\nsion of the experience. This combination of all of the medi-\nated content represents the digital contextualization of the\nexperience.\nIn contrast, the physical represents a token, a takeaway\nthat allows the person to tactually touch elements from a\nlocation where the person visited. This ability to touch the\nobject means that the object can be placed in space defined\nby the person to be an area of significance based on other\nobjects of travel. Objects allow the person to immerse him-\nself or herself in the memories of the travel via the sensory\nrelationship between himself or herself and the object. The\nsmell of suntan lotion on a piece of sea glass allows the per-\nson to remember a trip to the beach via the smell.\nThe convergence of the physical and the digital is moving\ncloser together via the social media platforms and SoLoMo\napps.Aperson can look over his or her own feed on Instagram\nor FourSquare to find a great place to watch a sunset. They\nhave the mediated experience of watching the sunset on\nInstagram, which is a social media service design to share a\nsmall (300 \u00d7 300 pixels in size) picture that can be framed by\nthe \"filters\" that the users can use to overlay on top of the\npicture. This simple picture of the sunset also includes the\nlocation where the picture was taken (either in the form of\nGlobal Positioning System [GPS] data or location informa-\ntion \"borrowed\" from Facebook or FourSquare) and other\ntextual provided by the Instagram community in the form of\ncomments and tags.\nIt is in this way that the difference between the digital and\nanalog is more than a \"bits versus atoms\" discussion; it is\nalso a \"dynamic versus static\" discussion. It is more than the\nsimple ability to store the elements and place them in some\nform of order and structure. Dynamic allows for different\nmodes of selection and filtering. Static maintains a standard\nform of selection. A person can look over his or her boxes to\nview his or her collection of postcards. The digital elements\ncan be organized in multiple albums. The ability to tag these\nelements allows for a more complex and comprehensive\napproach to memory selection. For example, a person can\norganize his or her elements based on the people associated\nwith the elements (\"my wife\" or \"Grandma Sofia\") or the\ntiming of the elements (\"2013 Trips\") or the physical loca-\ntion the elements were taken from. One element can fit mul-\ntiple organization platforms (Hine, 2003).\nArtifacts Versus Souvenir\nArtifacts are the small constructed elements that have some\ncultural purpose (the postcards can be mailed to others to tell\nabout the trip or communicate some other aspect of travel) or\na social purpose (the Disney shot glasses can be used at a\nparty to serve drinks) that contains the visual cues of the\nlocation that the artifact comes from. Sociologically, artifacts\nbecome the central point of analyzing the practices of orga-\nnized communities.\nThe ways that artifacts are used can tell a lot about a soci-\nety. Digital or physical artifacts have a sense of placement\nthat reflects the discourses about how the culture or subcul-\ntures connect and interact with others. The slideshow is a\ncommunal sharing of pictures that have some meaning to the\nperson or group sharing. In a similar fashion, the album or\nfeed on social media has some significance to the person\nposting the photos without necessarily worrying about what\ntype of audience is viewing the work.\nSouvenirs are mass produced works that are created to fill\nthe needs of the tourist as a trinket from location that has\nsome significance to the tourist as a representation of the\nlocation (i.e., a piece of the Berlin Wall). In addition, souve-\nnirs could be individually created and have a larger represen-\ntation to societies in the form of collections or \"placement.\"\nFor example, you can look at the collective nature of the\n\"pressed penny\" as a self-created souvenir that not only rep-\nresents the location (the person inserts a penny and some\nTable 3. Posting Practices of Sample Population (N = 98).\nInterviewee average\nInterviewee\nNon-interviewee average\nNon-interviewee\nCollects digital artifacts (pictures,\nbadges, check-ins, etc.)\n6 SAGE Open\nother change to have the penny transform into a souvenir via\nthe pressing of a symbol of the location on the penny, thus\nflattening the penny) but also the penny becomes an addition\nto the penny collector collection.\nBoth the artifact and the souvenir in the area of public\nmemory represent a type of signifier in the ritualization of\ntravel. If ritual can be defined as a pattern of actions and the\nprocess of those actions via a type of performance, then the\nability to collect digital artifacts or souvenirs has the same\nweight as taking physical pieces from a location\nIn the digital realm, the argument is that the poster of the\ndigital work is the performer and there is an audience that\ncan be actual (posting pictures for friends or family to see\nthem) or imagined. It is in this regard to talk about services\nsuch as FourSquare as part of the ritual. FourSquare is a loca-\ntion-based social network service where the users of the site\ncan go to locations in the real world and \"check-in\" on the\nsite to indicate they are at the location. As a \"ritual leader,\"\nFourSquare is responsible for mediating the artifacts of the\nexperience (pictures taken at the location to prove aspects of\nthe experience) and the souvenirs (user can collect \"badges\"\nbased on their travel and check-ins). FourSquare also ampli-\nfies the ritual nature of travel via the expression of the expe-\nrience through mediated channel to the imagined other (\"the\ncrowd\").\nAs it relates to public memory, the important element to\nnote in this analysis of ritual is that the performer and the\naudience can be one and the same. The performer in the pres-\nent is collecting artifacts and/or souvenirs for the purpose of\nthe future self to observe the aspects of the performance. A\nperson performs the aspects of the ritual of taking pictures\nwhile travel. The person digs his or her phone out of his or\nher pocket or bag. She or he goes to their camera app, takes\nthe pictures, and adds the metadata or other information rel-\nevant to their current location and/or experience.\nArchiver Versus Tourist\nThe last conflict to consider is the role of the person collect-\ning the elements related to travel. In the traditional mode of\ndiscussing their role, the person would be described as a\ntourist, with all of the semantic baggage associated with that\nterm. The tourist is defined as a person who travels from his\nor her home to other place, while bringing all of his or her\ncultural bias and frameworks to the place of travel. All new\nexperiences the tourist has while traveling are foreign based\non the binary of familiar/non-familiar.\nThis foreignness forces the tourist to reconceptualize\nbasic tenets of the mundane. Even the extremely basic func-\ntion of getting up from sleep has the aspects of foreignness\n(the bed is not their own, the location of clothing and basic\nbathroom products would be different). It is also this foreign-\nness that frames the tourist interactions with people and the\ninanimate.\nThe collections of memories are based on their relation-\nship to the \"known\" (\"it tastes like chicken\") and the\n\"unknown\" (\"why are they wearing those funny hats?\"). The\ncollections of memories to the tourist are in the form of\nmementos. Therefore, the idea of public memory for the\ntourists would be the scrapbook of their own experience via\nthe mediated platforms.\nArchivers are trying to understand the location of travel\nthrough points of analysis and cataloging their experiences\nwithin the context of the tools of collection. Analysis is con-\nducted via the reflective examination of the collection of ele-\nments within a mediated distribution platform. The picture of\nthe Grand Canyon is understood and placed within the con-\ntext of similar experiences, either personally experienced by\nthe archiver or through the aggregation of similar elements\nwithin a common platform. The tools of collection mediate\nthe experience and transform the experience into an element\nof analysis.\nImpact on Mobile Media Space\nAs the interplay between mobile communication and the real\nworld is becoming more fluid, the ability to reflect on every-\nday experiences becomes a mode of coping and adjusting to\nthe speed of life. The framework of this work was to explore\npublic memory through the view of its impact to document\ntravel for the individual. It is a natural connection as the\nmobile device is a person's lifeline as they explore places\nthat she or he is not familiar with. It is their map, connection\nto the outside world, recommendation engine for trying new\nrestaurants and, as explored in the course of this work, the\nmode of documenting those new experiences. However, pub-\nlic memory is more than a reflective mode of understanding\nthe world. It is a way of filtering and organizing all informa-\ntion that an individual is exposed to on a daily basis. As peo-\nple are exposed to newer stimuli and feeds of information,\nthere needs to perhaps be agents that can help a person\nactively document his or her own experience. In addition,\nthose agents could act as the extension of memory that can be\nrecalled via mobile devices. Those technologies, platforms,\nand services could be thought of collectively as the public\nmemory of the individual with the purpose of being aware of\none's own environment.\nImpact on Mobile Media Usage\nOne of the common themes from the interviews and the lit-\nerature that impacts this concept of \"mobile public memory\"\nis the increase of usage of mobile devices over the past\ndecade, specifically the consumption of mobile media.\nMobile phones have changed how people in the developing\nworld cope with their dynamic lives through the engagement\nof the larger community. Of the 26 interviewees, 20 dis-\ncussed how their mobile phone was an extension of them-\nselves. Amber, a 29-year-old sales professional from New\nOrleans, stated, \"If I left the house and realized that I left my\n(Samsung) Note there, I would be running back for it. I feel\nnaked without it. My entire life is on my phone.\" Barry, an\nAfrican American 36-year-old freelance artist from\nColumbus, discussed during his interview:\nI only use my laptop when working on client's projects. When\nI'm out, I have my DSLR (his digital camera) and my phone.\nSometimes, I'll just use my phone to take pictures, even if I have\nmy DSLR with me.\nWhen pushed why he used his phone instead of his pro-\nfessional camera, he said \"it's easier to post from my phone\nand it's quicker.\"\nPart of the discussion related to mobile phone usage is the\n\"social disconnection\" supposedly created by the use of\nmobile device. The social disconnection within mobile\ndevice relates to the anecdotal evidence that the more a per-\nson consumes mobile media, the less likely that person is\nable to maintain relationship away from the device. Hampton,\nSessions, and Her (2011) disputed this claim in the research\nstating,\n[i]n support of our hypotheses, findings reveal that neither\nInternet nor mobile phone use is associated with having fewer\ncore discussion confidants, or having less diverse ties with\nwhom to discuss important matters. As predicted, mobile phone\nownership and specific Internet activities--the use of certain\n\"social media\"--were found to be associated with having a\nlarger number of confidants. (p. 148)\nThis assertion was supported through the interview con-\nducted during this research. In all, 19 out of the 26 interview-\nees mentioned through the course of this research that they\nfelt the same number of friends or more when compared with\na decade ago.\nThese social connections were important to note in this\nresearch because despite the observational point that the\ninterviewees felt they had more social connections, the post-\nings on SoLoMo apps and Instagram were more for the inter-\nviewee rather than for the imagined audience. In all, 16 of the\n26 interviewees very rarely use hashtags to attract audience.\nOf the 26 interviewees, 19 would use a hashtag or GPS meta-\ndata on their postings as a way to remember an event or a\nlocation they were at. Charlie, a 40-year-old educator, encap-\nsulated this point when he said, \"I remember my grandpar-\nents showing me their vacation slides and they were\norganized in this carousels. I sort of see using the map on\nInstagram or putting a hashtag in as organizing my photos in\nthose carousels.\"\nImpact on Documenting Experiences\nThe second thematic of documenting experiences versus col-\nlecting souvenirs was also reinforced from the interviews\nand the previous literature. Both documenting experiences\nand collecting souvenirs fit into what Neubaum, R\u00f6sner,\nRosenthal-von der P\u00fctten, and Kr\u00e4mer (2014) would describe\nas the \"psychosocial functions of social media usage\" and\nframed such functionality within the uses and gratifications\nof these services. The context of the psychosocial was bro-\nken down into information gathering and sharing and observ-\ning emotions. Neubaum et al. were studying how emotions in\na disaster situation were transmitted and expressed via social\nmedia connections and public interactions online. The psy-\nchosocial was also described in the documenting experiences\n(the private interpretation of the SoLoMo postings) in the\nobservation of emotions and mentioned in the collection of\nsouvenirs (the public display of the SoLoMo apps) when\ndescribing the sharing emotions. David, a 27-year-old male,\ndescribed these psychosocial elements by saying, \"When I\ntravel, I will normally look at the pictures and comments\nabout a location from FourSquare, Yelp and Instagram. I find\nthis seems to be more of a realistic look at a place.\" This\nwould correspond to information gathering. He would later\ntalk about sharing the picture not with his followers on\nInstagram, but rather with his family.\nThe last time I was in Boston, I went to a Red Sox (baseball)\ngame. I took a few pictures and post them on Instagram... I\nwanted to show my son the pictures I took and I couldn't find\nthem on my phone. I went back through my Instagram feed and\nfound them. He likes Jonny Gomes and I wanted to show him\nthe pictures I took of (Gomes). He kind of giggled when (my\nson) saw the pictures.\nImpact on Posting Practices\nThe final thematic that was explored was the posting prac-\ntices of the individuals on Instagram. Most of the literature\nthat studied posting practices on Instagram were looking\nhow the individuals captured everyday experiences with the\nservice (Memarovic et al., 2014) or how the foreign and\nstrange were \"normalized\" via the service (e.g., war photog-\nraphy; Alper, 2013). In the case of Memarovic et al.'s\nresearch, the service was mutated to a networked public dis-\nplay that could post snapshots taken on the display of an indi-\nvidual at a location onto any service or website the individual\nwished. The other option was to leave the picture on the pub-\nlic display as a part of the example pictures on the display. Of\n26, 18 chose to remove the pictures from public viewing and\nplace those snapshots onto private services. The public dis-\nplay, and therefore a more public audience for the photo-\ngraph, was rejected by a majority of the individuals. Those\nindividuals preferred a more private display of the photo-\ngraphs. The interviewees reinforced this private desire, spe-\ncifically when discussing hashtags. Ellen, a 22-year-old\nfemale sales representative from Austin, Texas, commented\non this by saying,\n8 SAGE Open\nMost of the time when I take pictures when I travel, I normally\ndon't post \"'#postforlikes\" or \"#foodpron.\" I like having the\npictures on Instagram. But, I don't need a large group of\nfollowers validating my pics or likes. Most of the time, I post the\npictures for me.\nLimitations\nThe major limitation to this work was the snowball sample\nthat led to the survey takers and the interviewees. Both the\nunits for inclusion in the sample were not based on random\nselection. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the possi-\nble sampling error and make statistical inferences from the\nsample to the population. This research is not fully represen-\ntative of the population being studied. The rationale for con-\nducting the survey and the interviews with a snowball sample\nallowed for a more select group that would provide better\nartifacts within the context of the thematics of the research.\nThe sample group was more familiar with tools of distribu-\ntion being described in the research and could therefore artic-\nulate the elements of study needed to conduct this research;\nspecifically the sample could discuss the connection between\naudience, memory, and the tools of distribution in a sensible\nmanner.\nConclusion\nOne of the common themes that has made up the current con-\nceptualization of the idea of memory is its connection to\nmediated content. A by-product of this thematic understand-\ning of memory is how digital content has impacted this dis-\ncourse. The collection of slides and postcards from trips long\nago have become the feeds of pictures from social network\nservices as we travel. The accessibility and ubiquity of this\ncontent has changed the way that memories are captured.\nThere are multiple public systems and social networks\ndesigned to catalog and distribute experiences in the form of\nmediated content. Layers of metadata are embedded within\nthe content posted on these networks and services. As the\nacademy and scholars study the influence and impact of\nmobile and social media on society, it is important to note\nhow these services and networks change people's memories\non previous experiences.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlper, M.
