    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Persons held in correctional facilities are at high risk for HIV infection and their prevalence of HIV is\nsubstantially higher than in the general population. Thus, the need for proper surveillance and care of this high risk\npopulation is a paramount public health issue. This study aims to evaluate an organization-level intervention\nstrategy for improving HIV services for persons in prison or jail.\nMethods/Design: HIV Services and Treatment Implementation in Corrections (HIV-STIC) is using a cluster\nrandomized trial design to test an organization-level intervention designed to implement improvements in\npreventing, detecting, and treating HIV for persons under correctional supervision. Matched pairs of prison or jail\nfacilities were randomized using a SAS algorithm. Facility staff members in both Experimental and Control\nconditions involved in HIV service delivery are recruited to receive training on HIV infection, the HIV services\ncontinuum, and relevant web-based resources. Staff members in both conditions are tasked to implement\nimprovements in HIV prevention, testing, or treatment in their facility. In the Control condition facilities, staff\nparticipants use existing techniques for implementing improvement in a selected area of HIV services. In contrast,\nthe Experimental condition staff participants work as a Local Change Team (LCT) with external coaching and use a\nstructured process improvement approach to improve a selected part of the HIV services continuum. The\nintervention period is 10 months during which data are obtained using survey instruments administered to staff\nmembers and aggregate services delivery data. The study is being implemented in 13 pairs of correctional facilities\nacross nine states in the US. Experimental sites are hypothesized to show improvements in both staff attitudes\ntoward HIV services and the number and quality of HIV services provided for inmates.\nDiscussion: The current study examines a range of process and outcome data relevant to the implementation of a\nChange Team approach across diverse correctional settings in the United States. This initial study represents an\nimportant step toward a national best practices approach to implementing change in U.S. correctional settings and\ncould serve as an exemplar for designing similar implementation studies.\n",

Health and Justice\nhttp://www.healthandjusticejournal.com/content/1/1/8\nBackground\nPrison inmates are at high risk for incident HIV infec-\ntion and their prevalence of HIV is substantial, estimated\nat 1.5% of all inmates in federal or state custody at the\nend of 2010, making the need for proper surveillance\nand care a paramount public health issue (Maruschak\n2012). Although many correctional facilities offer HIV\ntesting and prevention services, including the provision\nof antiretroviral therapy (ART), numerous studies have\ndemonstrated fundamental gaps in the delivery of effect-\nive HIV-focused care (Baillargeon et al. 2009; Beckwith\nstate prison systems offer opt-out testing (Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention 2009), yet such testing\nprotocols are cost effective and can help identify inmates\nwith undetected infections (Begier et al. 2010). A num-\nber of barriers limit expansion of HIV testing among in-\nmates, including stigma and discrimination (Earnshaw &\nChaudoir 2009), timing of the tests, and lack of linkage\nwith routine clinical exams (Kavasery et al. 2009).\nBoth primary and secondary interventions are important\nfor this population. Primary HIV prevention is directed at\nall inmates, regardless of HIV status, and secondary HIV\nprevention is tailored to individuals who have an HIV in-\nfection. However, many inmates choose to not get tested\nregularly, testing is not offered routinely throughout an in-\nmate's incarceration term, HIV prevention interventions\nmay not be evidence-based or appropriate for specific\nhigh-risk categories (e.g., injection drug users, women\nwho engage in risky sex, Spanish-speaking inmates, female\ndrug users), and primary and secondary prevention out-\ncomes are not routinely assessed following release from\nprison (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2009;\nHammett 2006). For inmates released to parole or under\nother types of community supervision, HIV prevention is\nnot usually a priority, and access to HIV testing/counsel-\ning and prevention services is not routinely available\nPerhaps an even greater concern, inmates identified as\nHIV-infected may be provided with ART by correctional\nfacilities because of constitutional mandates for provision\nof inmate health care, but linkage to care following release\ncan be problematic. There are typically disruptions in\nHIV-focused care once the inmate is released to the com-\nmunity. These disruptions may be caused by insufficient\nsupply of medications provided by the facility at release,\ndelays in obtaining Medicaid, and adherence problems by\nreleased inmates (Baillargeon et al. 2009), which can have\nserious health consequences for the HIV-infected inmate\nand the community (Springer et al. 2011). Interruptions in\nantiretroviral therapy can result in increased viral load or\nreduced effectiveness of the medications, and thus a\nheightened risk of HIV transmission (Deloria-Knoll et al.\nBarriers also exist for initiating and adhering to ART\nwithin correctional facilities, due to concerns about confi-\ndentiality, stigma, and lack of information (Earnshaw, &\nprevention programs for HIV-infected inmates are also\nimportant for reducing the spread of infection to their sex-\nual and drug-using partners. It is also common for\ncommunity-based HIV service providers to encounter a\nrange of difficulties as basic as gaining access to institu-\ntions to deliver services. For example, peer-based interven-\ntions that incorporate former inmates as facilitators may\nnot be permitted in some correctional facilities. For both\nHIV-negative and HIV-infected inmates, improvements in\npre-release planning/transitioning are needed. Because the\ntime immediately following release from prison to the\ncommunity is a particularly high-risk period, it is import-\nant to foster continuity of care approaches and secondary\nHIV prevention services (Gough et al. 2010). Several strat-\negies for improving pre-release discharge planning have\nbeen identified; effective linkages need to include engage-\nment in substance abuse or mental health treatment and\nhousing, in addition to HIV medical care (Baillargeon\nWolitski & Project START Writing Group 2006).\nImprovements in the implementation and delivery of\nHIV-related services in correctional facilities are urgently\nneeded to identify seropositive inmates, improve access to\nand utilization of HIV testing services, enhance continuity\nof prevention and medical care for inmates released to the\ncommunity, and expand access to evidence-based preven-\ntion and ART for individuals under community supervi-\nsion. Models of sexually transmitted disease transmission\ngest that reducing or preventing infections in core risk\ngroups, such as inmates, can greatly reduce transmission\nof HIV throughout the community.\nTheories of public health impact suggest that increas-\ning the receipt of HIV services into an at-risk population\nwould raise the overall positive public health impact,\neven without significantly increasing the effectiveness of\nthe intervention--since public health impact is a product\nof an intervention's effect size and the rate of utilization\nof the intervention (Tucker & Roth 2006). Thus, inter-\nventions to increase HIV testing and detection of un-\nidentified infections, and increase continuity of ART, if\nimplemented on a large scale - such as across multiple\ncorrectional systems \u00ad could be expected to convey tre-\nmendous public health benefits. The complex chal-\nlenges of improving the delivery of health services such\nas HIV testing, prevention, and treatment within correc-\ntional settings suggests that organizational or systems-\nlevel interventions are needed to change practice and\nincrease the use of evidence-based practices (Taxman &\nBelenko et al. Health and Justice Page 2 of 11\nhttp://www.healthandjusticejournal.com/content/1/1/8\nThe study described in this paper addresses three\nmajor aims designed to test the effectiveness of a local\nchange team process improvement approach for: (1) im-\nproving the perceived value of HIV services among staff\nof correctional and community HIV organizations, (2)\nincreasing service penetration for inmates infected by or\nat risk for HIV, and (3) improving the quality of HIV ser-\nvice delivery (e.g., improved ART adherence) for high\nrisk or HIV-infected inmates. These aims are informed\nby the Proctor et al. conceptual model of implementa-\ntion research distinguishing between intervention strat-\negies, implementation strategies, and three levels of\noutcomes, including implementation, service, and client\noutcomes (Proctor et al. 2009). This implementation\nmodel proposes that implementation strategies can tar-\nget one or more of the five levels of the service delivery\nenvironment, including individual providers, supervisory\npractices, group learning, and organizational and sys-\ntems environments. We examine the effectiveness of\nimplementation strategies at the organizational levels de-\nscribed by this model. In this model, improvements in\nclient outcomes are viewed as dependent not only on\nevidence-based practices and programs, including client\nfactors such as adherence to treatment, but also on\nwhether the innovation is an improvement to existing\npractices. Service outcomes and by extension, client out-\ncomes, are viewed as dependent on the quality of the\nimplementation itself. The implementation model is\nbased on the assumption that successful implementation\nwill result in improved service outcomes which, in turn,\nwill lead to enhanced client outcomes. As such, two\ntypes of outcomes are being assessed in the HIV-STIC\nstudy: (1) Implementation outcomes and (2) Service-\nlevel outcomes.\nThree primary hypotheses are being tested:\nHypothesis 1: Value. Compared to the Control\ncondition, staff members from facilities in the\nExperimental condition show greater improvements in\ntheir ratings of the value of implementing HIV services.\nHypothesis 2: Services Penetration. Compared to the\nControl condition, proportionately more inmates in the\nExperimental condition who are at risk of or infected by\nHIV receive services within the HIV services continuum.\nHypothesis 3: Quality of Service Delivery. Compared to\nthe Control condition, proportionately more inmates in\nthe Experimental condition who are infected by or at\nrisk for HIV receive improved services delivery within\nthe HIV services continuum.\nMethods/Design\nStudy design\nThe HIV Services and Treatment Implementation in Cor-\nrections (HIV-STIC) study evaluates the experimental\ncondition of using a modified Network for the Improve-\nment of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) model (McCarty\net al. 2007), which has been applied successfully in drug\nabuse treatment facilities (Hoffman et al. 2008), to im-\nprove HIV services in criminal justice settings, specifically\ncorrectional (i.e., jail or prison) facilities. The NIATx\norganizational change approach utilizes the program ad-\nministrator as the Executive Sponsor of a Local Change\nTeam (LCT) consisting of a Change Leader who has ac-\ncess to the Executive Sponsor and members agreed upon\nby the Change Leader. The NIATx approach focuses on\nimproving access to services and retention in treatment\nfive principles to identify problems and introduce and test\norganizational changes: (1) understand and involve the\ncustomer, (2) fix key, important problems, (3) pick a\npowerful change leader, (4) get ideas from outside the\norganization, and (5) use rapid cycle testing (McCarty\net al. 2009). Each of these principles is articulated, well-\ndefined, and reflected in structured activities that contrib-\nute toward identified organizational goals.\nIn the current study, a modified NIATx approach is\nbeing compared to a conventional HIV staff training ap-\nproach to improve the delivery of the continuum of HIV\nservices to jail or prison inmates. HIV services include\nroutine HIV testing, prevention/education program-\nming, and procedures to link HIV-infected individuals\nto community-based treatment after confinement. A\nnon-blinded cluster randomized design is used with 14\npairs of correctional facilities randomized within nine\nparticipating study sites in the US. Some of the study\nsites have one pair of facilities in the study while other\nsites have two pairs. The facilities are matched as pairs,\nwith the basic characteristics of each pair matched as\nclosely as possible to ensure an equivalent chance of\nsuccessful outcomes, based on size of inmate population\nand custody/classification levels (e.g., minimum or\nmedium). One facility in the pair is randomly assigned\nto the Control Condition while the other is assigned to\nthe Experimental Condition.\nThe quality improvement process tested in HIV-STIC\nis modeled after the NIATx approach, but differs in im-\nportant respects. Notably, the goal of the HIV-STIC is to\nimprove HIV testing and linkage to treatment, rather\nthan drug abuse treatment access and utilization. The\nstudy also spans across organizations (correctional agen-\ncies, community health and drug abuse treatment agen-\ncies), which places greater emphasis on cross-agency\ncollaboration and coordination.\nStudy conditions\nAn initial face-to-face stakeholder orientation meeting\nis designed to bring together criminal justice senior\nmanagement and the research center (RC) Principal\nBelenko et al. Health and Justice Page 3 of 11\nhttp://www.healthandjusticejournal.com/content/1/1/8\nInvestigator (PI)/researcher for an introduction to the\nHIV-STIC study and overview of the study protocol in\neach of the nine study sites. The RC PI designates an\nExecutive Sponsor for the study who is a senior agency\nadministrator. Across the nine study sites, Executive\nSponsors include state-level managers of correctional\nhealth programs, medical services directors, and general\nprogram directors. Topics for discussion at the orienta-\ntion meeting include an overview of the HIV-STIC and\nits goals, as well as details about study components , in-\ncluding timeline, baseline training, randomization, staff\nparticipation, consent process, and data collection. Based\non the discussions at this meeting, the Executive Spon-\nsor selects one of the components of the HIV services\ncontinuum \u00ad prevention/education, testing, or linkage to\ntreatment \u00ad on which to focus in the correctional agency\nselected for the study. The Executive Sponsor also selects\nFacility Sponsors (see Table 1) for each of the study\nfacilities. Additional study participants are then selected\nby the Executive and Facility Sponsors based on their\ninvolvement in delivering HIV services at the facilities;\nthese staff participate in baseline training prior to study\nsite randomization.\nBaseline training\nThis training is designed to provide basic information and\nresources relevant to the HIV services continuum as well\nas evidence-based practices for implementing HIV services\nto criminal justice populations. The content of this training\nincludes the HIV services continuum, HIV prevalence and\nissues among inmates, and evidence-based HIV services in\ninstitutional and community corrections. Staff attending\nthe training include the Executive Sponsor, the Facility\nSponsors, the facility medical directors, health care staff in-\nvolved with HIV testing, HIV counselors, qualified HIV in-\nterventionists, prison/jail pharmacists, the drug treatment\ncoordinator, drug treatment staff, and corrections officer\nsupervisors, as well as participants from identified\ncommunity-based treatment and health organizations pro-\nviding HIV-related care to newly released prisoners. One\njoint training session involving staff of the two or four facil-\nities selected for the study is held for each of the study\nsites. Thus, nine baseline trainings are conducted. Follow-\ning the training, informed consent is administered to the\nstaff participants and the baseline surveys administered.\nThe baseline training lasts about six hours and utilizes\nadult learning principles which include connecting with\npersonal experiences, creating a safe learning environ-\nment, accommodating various learning styles, and pro-\nviding active learning activities on HIV. The curriculum\nfocuses on knowledge acquisition (lecture, discussion,\nreview of printed materials) as well as skills training\nachieved through such activities as role-playing exercises\ninvolving realistic scenarios and practice sessions. The\ntraining also includes a review of evidence-based HIV\nprevention programs and information from the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention's Diffusion of Effect-\nive Behavioral Interventions project (Solomon et al.\n2006); antiretroviral therapy and adherence; HIV testing\nand counseling procedures and relevant policies, and\npre- and post-release planning models. Local policies\nand issues relevant to the focus area at each Department\nof Corrections (DOC) are incorporated and discussed in\ntraining segments on implementation issues. The train-\ning is interactive and action-oriented, and is designed to\nassist site staff to identify key agencies/staff positioned\nTable 1 Participant roles in HIV-STIC\nExecutive Sponsor An agency-level administrator who determines which area of the HIV services continuum will be the\nprimary focus for all facilities in their state or county.

Selected by the Executive Sponsor.\nChange Team Leader Interacts with the Facility Sponsor, keeping the Facility Sponsor informed of the change team progress,\nrequests the resources needed to accomplish the change team goal, works with the LCT Coach, tracking\nthe progress of the change team against the study timelines, calls meetings of the change team, and\nassigns tasks and roles within the team. Selected by the Facility Sponsor.\nChange Team Coach An external consultant trained in NIATx process improvement strategies. The Coach works with Change\nTeam Leader and agency representatives to help LCT identify roadblocks and other issues which may\nimpede effective implementation. The Coach spends one day training the change team and conducts\nregular and in-person coaching sessions with the Change Team Leader and LCT. The Coaches from all\nstudy sites participate in a collective monthly call with a mentor who is a senior member of the NIATx\ncore organization. Selected by the Researcher.\nLocal Change Team Consists of about 5\u00ad7 staff members from facility units affected by changes in HIV service delivery or\nagencies related to or affected by any changes, including prison medical staff, program staff, counselors,\nand community-based HIV service coordinators. The Team may also include an outside expert in the\nfield of HIV services.\nBelenko et al. Health and Justice Page 4 of 11\nhttp://www.healthandjusticejournal.com/content/1/1/8\nto deliver improved HIV services. Following baseline\ntraining, the matched pairs of study sites are randomized\ninto two study conditions. Randomization was con-\nducted by the chair of the CJDATS Steering Committee\nusing a SAS algorithm.\nControl condition\nIn addition to the standardized baseline training for all\nsites, participants at the control condition sites are pro-\nvided web-based informational resources regarding a\nrange of relevant HIV-focused care services. An individual\nwho holds a management or supervisory position in the\nfacility is designated as a Facility Sponsor and selected by\ncorrectional agency management to implement improve-\nment(s) to the HIV service delivery continuum at the con-\ntrol facilities. The leadership of those sites that focus on\nlinkage to care may include a representative from the tar-\ngeted community treatment agency. Management engages\nadditional staff at different stages of the study to work on\nHIV services improvements (see Figure 1).\nExperimental condition\nParticipants at the experimental condition sites are in-\nvolved in an approach to implementation that requires the\ncreation of local change teams (LCT) that work toward\nidentifying and accomplishing specific process improve-\nment goals with regard to HIV-focused care. Each LCT\nconsists of 5\u00ad7 permanent members, most of whom are\nfrom the correctional agency (prison or jail; see Table 1)\nor the agency's contracted on-site medical provider. Eli-\ngible change team members have direct responsibility for\nor direct involvement with the selected area of the HIV\nservices continuum and/or the specific evidence-based\npractice being implemented at a site. Preference is given\nto staff with responsibilities that affect the delivery of HIV\nservices who are recommended by correctional agency\nmanagement and who are expected to remain in their\ncurrent position for the duration of the study. For sites\nthat are focused on linking inmates to post-release HIV-\nrelated care, a community-based HIV service provider is\nalso identified.\nExperimental Condition participants engage in process\nimprovement strategies that involve a structured set of ac-\ntivities collectively designed to produce organizational\nchange (McCarty et al. 2007). The assumption underlying\nthis approach is that creating change in organizational\noperations requires a sustained multi-level effort that in-\nvolves leadership, ongoing staff involvement, understanding\nFigure 1 Overview of HIV-STIC study design.\nBelenko et al. Health and Justice Page 5 of 11\nhttp://www.healthandjusticejournal.com/content/1/1/8\nthe organization's function from multiple viewpoints in-\ncluding the \"consumer\" of services, systematic efforts to\ntest and measure new practices or interventions within the\norganization, and thoughtful decision-making regarding\nthe results of the process improvement efforts. Initiation of\nthe modified NIATx process involves several distinct roles;\nthe primary participants are Executive Sponsor, Facility\nSponsor, Change Team Leader, and a Change Team Coach.\nShort descriptions of these roles appear in Table 1.\nThe initial task of the LCT is to refine the problem ini-\ntially identified by the Executive Sponsor and the Facility\nSponsor, and to reduce the problem into components that\ncan be individually addressed. Two procedures adapted\nfrom NIATx are employed to gain a better understanding\nof the problem and its component parts. A walk-through\nis conducted in which two or more members of the LCT\ngo through the same process as the inmate regarding the\nspecific service under scrutiny. Confidential or anonymous\nfeedback is solicited from staff involved in the process\nbased on their observations and experience. The walk-\nthrough and staff observations are then reviewed in order\nto identify barriers within the system. The team then\nchooses a single manageable component to be changed,\nfollowed by additional components as each change is suc-\ncessfully implemented, accepted, or revised. Examples of\nprocess improvement goals that the LCT teams have iden-\ntified include:\n Increase female attendance at HIV prevention\nsessions;\n Increase percentage of inmates receiving HIV\nprevention/education in 60-day period before\nrelease;\n Increase percentage of inmates receiving HIV test at\nadmission;\n Increase HIV testing and;\n Improve linkage to community treatment for HIV +\ninmates.\nThe implementation process involves rapid cycle testing\nwith teams following a Plan, Do, Study, Act (PDSA)\nprocess. The frequency of team meetings is expected to\nvary between study sites, but generally takes place bi-\nweekly or monthly. Baseline data are collected for 6 weeks\nprior to implementing the changes. These are not research\ndata, but rather data assembled by the LCT to inform its\nwork. The change is then implemented and data are col-\nlected for a period of 3\u00ad6 weeks. Generally, data consist of\nsimple aggregates that can be shown on a single line graph\nso as to make progress easy to interpret and demonstrate\nto the agency staff. If the change is unsuccessful, another\nchange is substituted. If the change is successful, an add-\nitional change is made to further improve the process. After\nsuccessful changes, the team formulates a sustainability\nplan and responsibility for following up on the changes is\nassigned to one of the change team members. In some\ncases, a new sustainability team is formed along the same\nprinciples as the original change team.\nParticipating sites\nSix of the nine study sites implement the HIV-STIC study\nin state prison facilities where inmates transition to the\ncommunity under parole supervision after release; how-\never, three study sites implement HIV-STIC in jail facilities\nwhere inmates have pending court cases or short sen-\ntences. Study sites focusing on linking exiting inmates to\ncommunity-based HIV services identify at least one col-\nlaborating community-based program that provides HIV\nservices and medications to be involved in the study. To\nthe extent possible, the correctional and community-\nbased agencies involved in HIV-STIC are autonomous\nsuch that introduction of the intervention in one agency\ndoes not contaminate process improvements surrounding\nHIV services in other agencies. Separate adult correctional\ninstitutions are considered independent organizations if\nthey do not share a common central administrative entity\nthat is responsible for the establishment and promulgation\nof agency policies and procedures regarding within-facility\ndelivery of HIV services. The facility is the potential target\nof the organizational intervention.\nAdministrators of the correctional facilities selected for\nthe study and corresponding administrators of HIV com-\nmunity services organizations select staff to participate in\nthe HIV-STIC study, including staff responsible for pre-\nvention, testing, and treatment activities. These staff mem-\nbers vary as needed by site, but include HIV counselors,\nprison medical staff, substance abuse treatment staff, and\ncommunity-based HIV services staff. Staff member partici-\npants are asked to complete surveys, participate in semi-\nstructured interviews, and adhere to study protocols. Add-\nitionally, staff member participants in the experimental\ncondition serve as members of the LCT.\nData collection and measures\nPrimary and secondary outcomes for the study were se-\nlected based on both the implementation research frame-\nwork suggested by Proctor and her colleagues (Proctor\net al. 2009) and the public health impact framework. The\nprimary sources of data for this study are staff surveys,\nparticipating agency records of services, and anonymous\ninmate surveys.\nPrimary outcomes\nThe three primary outcomes are value, services penetra-\ntion, and services quality.\nValue In this study, value is defined as a combination of\nthe acceptability, perceived feasibility, and perceived relative\nBelenko et al. Health and Justice Page 6 of 11\nhttp://www.healthandjusticejournal.com/content/1/1/8\ncosts of implementing HIV service improvements as per-\nceived by staff members involved in the delivery of HIV ser-\nvices in the study sites. One measure of value is a set of\nitems adapted from the Barriers to Research Utilization\nScale (Funk et al. 1991). This instrument contains subscales\nfor characteristics of the adopter, characteristics of the\norganization, characteristics of the innovation, and charac-\nteristics of the communication. Another measure, a modi-\nfied version of the Usage Rating Profile-Intervention\n(Chafouleas et al. 2009), focuses more specifically on the ac-\nceptability and perceived relative costs of implementing\nenhancements of HIV services. This instrument contains\nsubscales for acceptability, knowledge, feasibility, and sys-\ntems support. Feasibility is also measured using a modified\nversion of the Evidence Based Practice Attitudes Scale\n(Aarons 2004), which includes subscales for requirements,\nappeal, openness and divergence. All scales are taken from\nprevious studies and have good psychometric properties.\nServices penetration Services penetration is defined as\nthe extent to which an evidence-based HIV service\nreaches the appropriate target population. An example is\nthe proportion of inmates that receive HIV tests at ad-\nmission. Because several study sites have very few staff\ninvolved in HIV testing or linkage to treatment in the\ncommunity, penetration does not focus on staff mea-\nsures, but rather focuses on the measure of penetration\nas the proportion of inmates who receive an HIV service\nsuch as HIV testing, prevention intervention, or linkage\nof HIV-infected inmates to treatment in the community.\nThe services penetration measures are collected at the\naggregate inmate level.\nQuality of service delivery Improvements in the quality\nin which HIV services are delivered in correctional facil-\nities are related to the service-level outcomes of effi-\nciency, effectiveness, or timeliness of the service\ndelivery. Outcomes linked directly to these improve-\nments include time between assessment and HIV test-\ning, increases in the number agreeing to an HIV test,\nincreases in the number of inmates who receive ART,\nand improved HIV treatment continuation rates.\nSecondary outcomes\nSecondary outcomes are stigma, interagency collabor-\nation, and inmate awareness.\nStigma Stigma may be related to two implementation\noutcome measures: (1) whether HIV service improve-\nments are perceived as having value and (2) the extent\nof acceptance of HIV service improvements by correc-\ntional staff. An adapted version of the HIV/AIDS Stigma\nScale (Zelaya et al. 2008) is given to staff in the study\nsites. Embedded within the 21 items of this instrument\nare 4 subscales reflecting fear of transmission and dis-\nease, association with shame, blame and judgment, per-\nsonal support of discriminatory actions or policies, and\nperceived community support of discriminatory actions\nor policies.\nInteragency collaboration Cooperation and coordination\nare described as key determinants of process improve-\nment interventions targeted at the group or team level\n(Proctor et al. 2009). Thus, interagency coordination and\ncollaboration are expected to be key factors determining\nimplementation outcomes at the organizational and sys-\ntems (defined as cross-organizational) levels. Improve-\nments in HIV services, especially as inmates transition\nto the community, are expected to result in experi-\nmental site increases in interagency contacts, commu-\nnication, program development, cross-agency training,\nclient service activities, and changes in collaborative\npolicies. These changes are expected to occur as part\nof changes in program/service delivery processes that\nare implemented as a part of the LCT intervention.\nInteragency collaboration is being measured with a\nmodified version of the Interagency Collaborative Ac-\ntivities Scale (Dedrick & Greenbaum 2011) and semi-\nstructured interviews with facility site administrators\nand key service staff.\nInmate awareness Although the study's main focus is\nthe organizational system, a process improvement pro-\nject designed to focus on the delivery of HIV services\nought to impact the individuals receiving those services.\nAs such, an additional outcome is the perceived value of\nservices based on the perceptions of the inmates them-\nselves. An anonymous survey of inmates at the study\nsites includes questions about each of the areas of the\nHIV services continuum (education and prevention, test-\ning, treatment), as well as pre-release planning.\nData sources\nStaff surveys are used to capture data related to value,\nstigma and interagency collaboration, as well as measure\nstaff perceptions of the characteristics of the organization,\nand are completed prior to the baseline training and\n10 months after the experimental site kick-off meeting.\nThus, the Barriers to Research Utilization, EBPAS, HIV\nStigma and Interagency Collaboration scales are completed\nat baseline, prior to training. The modified Usage Rating\nProfile-Intervention and the TCU-Workshop Evaluation\nForm (Bartholomew et al. 2007) are completed immedi-\nately after the baseline training. Ten to fifteen staff mem-\nbers at both Experimental and Control sites are selected to\nreceive the surveys, including nurses, correctional officers,\nsubstance abuse treatment counselors, deputy wardens,\ncase managers, pre-release discharge counselors, nursing\nBelenko et al. Health and Justice Page 7 of 11\nhttp://www.healthandjusticejournal.com/content/1/1/8\nadministrators, and community HIV staff such as nurses\nand administrators. At the end of the study, staff members\nalso complete a short survey designed to assess the impact\nof the change team process on the facility, including staff\nacceptance of the change process and whether sufficient\ntraining resources exist to support modifications initiated\nby the change team. Finally, members of the change team\nin the Experimental sites complete a short survey on the\nimpact of the change team process.\nParticipating agency records are used to collect ser-\nvices penetration and quality of service delivery data re-\nlated to the process improvement measures for HIV\nprevention/education, testing, and treatment. These data\nare collected at monthly intervals beginning with the ini-\ntiation of the intervention at the kick-off meeting and\nconcluding two months after the Experimental interven-\ntion ends for a total of 12 months. The nine primary\nHIV service penetration and quality of service items that\nare used in the analysis are presented in Table 2.\nThe anonymous survey of inmates is administered in\nboth Experimental and Control sites as a means of asses-\nsing awareness of and attitudes toward the HIV services\ncontinuum among the general inmate population at each\nstudy site. It provides a secondary measure of penetra-\ntion and value--from the perspective of the inmate--of\nthe HIV service (prevention/education, testing, and/or\ntreatment) that is the focus of the study site. Prior to the\nstart of the study and at the end of the final data collec-\ntion phase, at each facility, the research team administers\nthe survey to a convenience sample of a minimum of 50\ninmates per facility. Data are anonymous and are not\ncollected longitudinally.\nIn addition to the quantitative data collection, qualita-\ntive data are collected in both Experimental and Control\nsites in the form of in-depth interviews with selected\nstaff who are involved in the intervention and one focus\ngroup with the eight coaches assigned to the change\nteams (one coach is working with two study sites). The\nqualitative data provide additional contextual informa-\ntion to complement the quantitative data collected. In\neffect, the qualitative data help to explain why certain\nquantitative outcomes emerge in the patterns observed.\nIn order to accomplish this, several themes are devel-\noped from each of the primary and secondary hypoth-\neses. For example, the theme `perceived importance of\nservice improvement' emerges from primary hypothesis\n1 (Value). Specific interview questions are constructed\nfrom each theme that, in turn, map onto the hypothesis.\nFor example, the following is asked of the LCT members:\n\"In your opinion, how important are the goal(s) that the\nChange Team decided to address? Tell me some more\nabout that please. Do you feel that other goals should also\nbe addressed?\" These questions and others in the inter-\nview guide ask for staff views about the perceived import-\nance of service improvement related to HIV services and\nthus provide detailed explanatory information regarding\nhypothesis 1 (Value). The same process is done for each\nprimary and secondary hypothesis.\nThe focus group with the coaches provides additional\ncontextual information regarding their experience in\nimplementing a process improvement approach in cor-\nrectional settings. The primary aims of the focus group\nare to understand: 1) the challenges as a coach for\nimplementing a process improvement approach in cor-\nrectional settings, and 2) the challenges as a coach for\nimplementing a process improvement approach as part\nof a research project with an experimental design.\nIn order to monitor fidelity to the intervention and\ngather information about site activities such as changes\nin personnel, administration, or policies that may affect\nthe intervention, site research teams complete a quar-\nterly assessment of fidelity in the Experimental sites and\na monthly site activity assessment in both Experimental\nand Control sites. The monthly site activity data collec-\ntion also captures changes in the local environment un-\nrelated to the study that may affect study outcomes.\nFinally, data are also collected to estimate the costs asso-\nciated with the intervention. The cost to an organization\nof implementing a process improvement strategy is a po-\ntential barrier for sustainability. Costs vary depending on\nthe particular HIV services goal at each site and particular\nbarriers faced in their systems. Because of the complexity\nand variation across states and study sites in costs of HIV\nmedications and HIV tests, it is not feasible to do a full-\nscale cost analysis. For example, because the costs of anti-\nretroviral therapy differ, and prescriptions depend on\nclient- and state-specific guidelines and protocols, it would\nbe necessary to gain access to individual prescription data\nand update these data if prescriptions change over time.\nSuch data collection efforts are not feasible for this study.\nA benefit-cost analysis is also not possible because\nTable 2 HIV-STIC service penetration and quality of\nservice items\nPrevention and Testing Linkage to Antiretroviral (ARV)\nmedication in the Community\nPercent of inmates who receive\nthe HIV prevention intervention\nPercent of inmates given an\nappointment with a community\nHIV treatment provider\nPercent of inmates who complete\nthe HIV prevention intervention\nOf those with appointment,\npercent who contacted community\nHIV treatment provider\nPercent of inmates who receive an\nHIV test\nPercent assigned a case manager\nor linkage coordinator\nTime between the HIV test and\nresults counseling\nPercent discharged with supply of\nARV medication\nOf those discharged with ARV\nprescription, percent who refill the\nprescription\nBelenko et al.

Nonetheless, it is useful to collect some cost data\nbecause intervention costs may affect the likelihood\nof replication. Thus, study sites utilize a brief form to\ncollect data on the amount of time that staff members\nspend on study-related activities. In addition, the costs of\nHIV tests at each study site are collected to assess the\ncosts associated with any increased testing as a result of\nthe intervention.\nTimeline\nIn this implementation study, we seek to test Hypotheses\n1\u00ad3 that an organization-level intervention strategy can\nimprove the delivery of HIV services for preventing,\ndetecting, and treating HIV for offenders under correc-\ntional supervision. The duration of the intervention\nperiod is 10 months during which data are obtained\nusing a battery of survey instruments, and aggregate\nservices delivery data, as described above. Information\nis collected at baseline using the baseline survey of\norganizational characteristics (BSOC), HIV Staff Survey\n(comprised of four scales), HIV Services Delivery (modi-\nfied Usage Rating Profile-Intervention), Workshop\nEvaluation Form (WEVAL), and Inmate survey. At the\n10-month follow-up point the same instruments are\nused as well as the Facility Impact Assessment, Change\nTeam Assessment, and qualitative interviews. The BSOC\nand the WEVAL are only collected at baseline. Finally,\nwe collect information on a monthly basis \u00ad over a\n12 month period \u00ad with regard to agency records, cost\ndata, and site activity. Thus, these data collectively allow\nus to test Hypotheses 1\u00ad3 pertaining to the impact of an\norganization-level intervention strategy. The data collec-\ntion plan for the study is presented in Table 3. All sites\nexcept one were in the field with the intervention by\nearly 2012, with one site initiating the protocol in sum-\nDiscussion\nAlthough evidence-based practices for HIV services in\ncorrectional settings have been identified, successfully\nmoving these practices into routine and efficacious\nuse in the field is an important challenge. Implementa-\ntion research is needed to determine the optimal strat-\negies for achieving this goal (Rubenstein & Pugh 2006).\nImproving implementation, and ultimately the sustain-\nability, of health services and evidence-based practices\nrequires careful attention to the systems, organizational,\nand staff contexts within which these services are\ndelivered (Proctor et al. 2009). The multifaceted nature\nof these contexts suggest that unless various staff\nmembers embrace the need for and value of service\nimprovements, such improvements are not likely to be\nwell implemented or sustained.\nEpidemiological models of sexually transmitted disease\ntransmission and public health models for improving\npublic health impact of interventions indicate that public\nhealth impacts are maximized by detecting and reducing\ninfections within high-risk groups, and increasing the\nutilization of prevention and treatment services (Tucker\n2002). Yet there has been little rigorous research on the\nimplementation of HIV services, or strategies for im-\nproving implementation outcomes (especially staff per-\nceptions of the services) in correctional settings.\nThe high rate of HIV infection among incarcerated\npersons calls for interventions that are effective in vari-\nous correctional settings in the US. The dual priorities\nof health and security in correctional settings require\nstaff from different departments or organizations to\nwork across their usual domains in order to provide\nadequate services. The HIV-STIC study is designed to\ntest whether a process improvement model based on the\nutilization of Local Change Teams can significantly\nimprove services across the full continuum of HIV care,\nincluding prevention, testing, and linkage to care upon\nrelease. The study design described in this paper will\nenable the research team to investigate a wide range\nof process and outcome data relevant to the implemen-\ntation of the Change Team model across diverse\ncorrectional settings in the US. It is hoped that this\nstudy will be an important step toward a national best\nTable 3 HIV-STIC data collection plan\nInstrument Baseline Immediately\npost training\nmths\nmths\nHIV Staff Survey (4 scales)\nBarriers to Research Utilization X X X\nStigma X X X\nInteragency Collaboration X X X\nHIV Services Delivery X X X\nInmate Survey X X\nQualitative Interviews X X\nFacility Impact Assessment X\nChange Team Assessment X\nAgency Records X* X X\nCost Data X* X X\nSite Activity Report X* X X\n*Aggregate data collected every month beginning with the month following\ntraining and continuing for 12 months.\nBelenko et al.
