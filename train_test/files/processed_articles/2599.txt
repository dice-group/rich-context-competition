Several recent studies have examined the implications\nof measures of attractiveness for intimate relationships\ndocument a \"love premium\" for beauty in which physically\nattractive people (as measured by height, weight, or facial\nbeauty) are more likely to be in marital, dating, and sexual\nheterosexual relationships. While intriguing, these studies\ntend to focus on adolescence through middle age, and thus\ngenerate additional questions, particularly regarding how\nsustained the advantages of early life attractiveness are\nacross the life course. Does attractiveness early in life have\nan ongoing effect decades later, and if so, why? Or do these\nphysical benefits erode and lose significance for our pros-\npects of intimate relationships as we age? Is our face truly\nour fortune?\nTo address these questions, we use data from the\nWisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS), a prospective\nstudy based on a one-third sample of the Wisconsin high\nschool graduating class of 1957. The WLS has a number\nof advantages over prior work, including face-based meas-\nures of attractiveness validated by multiple raters, multi-\nple measures of intimate relationships later in life, as well\nJournals of Gerontology: Social Sciences\nas a rich array of covariates. These data allow us to track\nwhether physical attractiveness at adolescence, based on\nratings of high school yearbook photos, is associated with\nsexual activity overall and among married people, as well\nas unmarried sexual relationships (referred to jointly in\nthis article as \"intimate relationships\") later in life, as the\nWLS cohort enter their 60s and 70s. The richness of the\ndata allows us to control for and model many potential\nadditional covariates, such as socioeconomic status, health,\nand personality, which may explain potential associations\nbetween attractiveness and intimate relationships, and/or\nbe important predictors of intimate relationships in and of\nthemselves.\nAttractiveness and Intimate Relationships across\nthe Life Course\nA large and growing literature documents the importance\nof physical traits for intimate relationships. Dimensions\nof physical attractiveness such as facial attractiveness\nand weight (Fikkan & Rothblum, 2012) have been associ-\nated with a variety of intimate relationships in the repro-\nductive stage of the life course. Dating is associated with\nheight and weight (Cawley, Joyner, & Sobal, 2006) as well\nas researcher ratings of photographs (Luo & Zhang, 2009),\ncohabitation is linked to obesity (Mukhopadhyay, 2008),\nand marriage is related to height (Harper, 2000; Weitzman\nof physical attractiveness are also linked to sexual behavior\nspecifically. For example, Brody (2004) found that slimmer\npeople more frequently engaged in vaginal intercourse in\nlate adolescence through middle age. Among young men,\na composite measure of attractiveness based on researcher\nand self-reports is also positively associated with number\nof sexual partners (Bogaert & Fisher, 1995; McClintock,\n2011). In addition, more attractive people may enjoy lasting\nbenefits in their relationships. Margolin and White (1987)\nfound that as spouses--especially husbands--perceived\ndeclining spousal attractiveness, they became less inter-\nested in sex, became less happy in the sexual relationship,\nand were more likely to be unfaithful. Analysis of personal\nadvertisement descriptions (Alterovitz & Mendelsohn,\n2009) and qualitative interviews of older online daters\n(McWilliams & Barrett, 2014) also document the salience\nof attractiveness in internet dating among older adults.\nMost studies have only looked at the relationship\nbetween attractiveness and one aspect of intimate relation-\nships, though attractiveness may play a different role in\nthe initial attraction of a sexual partner than in the sexual\nrelationship between long-married people. In the present\nstudy, we advance the literature by examining the relation-\nship between adolescent facial attractiveness and a variety\nof outcomes in later life including sexual activity overall\nand among married and unmarried people. This helps us\nto understand whether attractiveness functions differently\nif someone is attracting a new partner (as well as how this\nmight vary by life course stage) or engaging in sexual activ-\nity within an established relationship.\nThere are a number of potential reasons why physi-\ncal attractiveness matters for intimate relationships. First,\nattractiveness facilitates sexual activity, which is impor-\ntant for intimate relationships (Bogaert & Fisher, 1995;\ntion, biological evolutionary theories argue that \"attrac-\ntive\" traits signal reproductive and genetic fitness as well\nas general good health (Buss & Schmitt, 1993). Using the\nWLS, Jokela (2009) found that both more attractive male\nand female adolescents had more children than their less\nattractive counterparts. However, the fact that attractive-\nness remains a preferred characteristic among older daters\n(Alterovitz & Mendelsohn, 2009; McWilliams & Barrett,\n2014) points to social and cultural explanations rather\nthan evolutionary theory in explaining the importance of\nattractiveness in at least some types of intimate relation-\nships in later life.\nAttractiveness may also be related to sexual activity via\nhealth, though extant evidence is mixed. Using WLS data,\nReither, Hauser, and Swallen (2009) found that a meas-\nure of adolescent facial mass was predictive of mortality\nin late midlife, with increased risk of nonaccidental death\nand heart disease mortality among those who were over-\nweight according to high school photographs. Another\nstudy also using WLS examined a measure of adolescent\nfacial attractiveness independent of body mass and did\nnot find an association with mortality (Scholz & Sicinski,\n2015). These mixed findings suggest that variation in the\nrelationship between attractiveness and health depends\non the particular measure of attractiveness used. Further,\nattractiveness ratings themselves are frequently influenced\nby factors such as socioeconomic background (Scholz &\nAttractiveness may also matter in intimate relation-\nships via social pathways. First, a large number of studies\ndocument that attractive people enjoy a wage premium\nScholz & Sicinski, 2015). Theories from social psychology\npropose that more attractive people benefit from advan-\ntaged social contexts because of the \"halo effect\" of the\nesteem of others (Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, & Longo,\n1991) and because more attractive individuals internal-\nize these favorable evaluations, fostering personality\ncharacteristics which may also encourage intimate rela-\ntionships (Berscheid & Walster, 1974). Attractive children\nand adults are evaluated more favorably by others and\nare treated better (Langlois et al., 2000). Perhaps in part\nbecause of this better treatment, attractive people are less\nsocially anxious and more socially skilled (Feingold, 1992)\nand are more likely to report higher levels of extraversion\nand lower levels of neuroticism (Scholz & Sicinski, 2015).\nSocial skills--reflected in part via the personality trait of\nextraversion--may make attractive people more likely to\nengage in social situations where potential romantic part-\nners may be encountered. Low neuroticism, which entails\nlow levels of a variety of negative emotions, may promote\nrelationship maintenance via relationship satisfaction and\nintimacy (Fisher & McNulty, 2008; White, Hendrick, &\nHendrick, 2004). Given these linkages between attractive-\nness and personality as well as the importance of early\nlife for personality development and its relative stability\nacross the life course (Caspi & Roberts, 2001), early life\nattractiveness may play an important role in shaping adult\npersonality. In addition, favorable treatment and associ-\nated low levels of negative emotions may foster positive\ndimensions of well-being among attractive people such as\nself-acceptance, which has consequential implications for\nsexual outcomes (Cornwell & Laumann, 2011). Although\nthese psychological correlates of attractiveness may also\nplay an important role in individuals' abilities to estab-\nlish intimate relationships with others, the literature has\nlargely ignored these potential pathways. This makes\nit difficult to assess the degree to which factors such as\npersonality characteristics like extraversion predict the\nestablishment of intimate relationships independent of\nattractiveness, or are themselves at least partly a function\nof attractiveness.\nAdditional Determinants of Intimate\nRelationships in the Later Life Course\nPrior literature has identified several additional determi-\nnants of sexual activity in later life. We briefly summarize\nthese here. First, earlier work has identified the impor-\ntance of gender for intimate relationships in later life. Men\nare more likely to be partnered in later life, a necessary\nbut insufficient condition for partnered sexual activity\n(Karraker, DeLamater, & Schwartz, 2011; Lindau, et al.,\n2007). Within relationships, men are also more likely to be\nsexually active (Karraker & DeLamater, 2013), a relation-\nship that may reflect age hypergamy and other factors.\nIntimate relationships in later life are also predicted\nby physical and psychological health (Lindau et al.,\n2007), including a variety of physical health conditions\n(DeLamater & Sill, 2005), as well as self-rated physical and\nmental health (Karraker & DeLamater, 2013; Karraker,\nDeLamater, & Schwartz 2011). Further, health may also\nbe associated with partnership to the extent that partners\nseek healthy mates, because of desires for sexual activity, to\navoid caregiving, or other reasons (England & McClintock,\nFinally, socioeconomic and other factors are also linked\nto intimate relationships in later life. Education and finan-\ncial resources are valued by both men and women in poten-\ntial partners across the life course (England & McClintock,\ntudes and beliefs about sexual activity earlier in the life\ncourse (Laumann et al., 1994). Finally, wealthier people\nare more likely to repartner, either via remarriage or via\ncohabitation, in later life (Vespa, 2012).\nThe Present Study\nAlthough the prior work on attractiveness and inti-\nmate relationships is intriguing, little is known about\nthe potential enduring role of attractiveness in later\nlife. Work that has examined the role of attractiveness\nin intimate relationships in later life has relied on con-\nvenience samples examining internet dating (Alterovitz\nDating is an increasingly important relationship context\nfor older adults, but the role of attractiveness may dif-\nfer in dating versus marital relationships, in part because\nthose who are dating are a select group of older adults\nwho are more advantaged in terms of education, assets,\nhealth, and social connectedness than nondaters (Brown\n& Shinohara, 2013). Given that attractiveness may be a\nstrong predictor of partnership, and partnership in turn\npredicts sexual activity in later life (Karraker, DeLamater,\n& Schwartz, 2011), early life attractiveness may facili-\ntate continued sexual activity in later life because of its\nconnections with partnership earlier in the life course.\nIn addition, because more attractive people benefit from\nbetter health and socioeconomic status, as well as cer-\ntain personality traits, these factors may also serve as\npotential mechanisms linking attractiveness and intimate\nrelationship outcomes. Further, it is unclear whether\nattractiveness (and other factors) will have the same\nassociation with intimate relationship outcomes within\ndifferent stages in the later life course. Using the WLS, we\naddress these gaps by examining the association between\nattractiveness and a variety of intimate relationship out-\ncomes (sexual activity, marital status, unmarried partner-\nship status), as well as the potential explanatory role of\nfactors such as health, socioeconomic status, and person-\nality at older ages.\nMethod\nWe use data from the WLS to explore the connections\nbetween attractiveness and intimate relationships in later\nlife. The WLS is a one-third random sample of Wisconsin\nhigh school graduates from the class of 1957 (born in\napproximately 1939). Respondents were interviewed in\nWe do not present these results (available upon request)\nas they generally do not differ from results for outcomes\nThe WLS provides a unique opportunity to exam-\nine the role of adolescent attractiveness in later life inti-\nmate relationships as well as the pathways across the life\ncourse through which attractiveness impacts these out-\ncomes. However, because the WLS is a distinctive cohort\nwith unique racial/ethnic, socioeconomic, and cultural\ncharacteristics, it is unclear how it compares with nation-\nally representative data. To address this, we compare our\nsample with men and women from the first wave (collected\nand had at least a high school education. We weighted\nNSHAP statistics with survey-provided weights that\naccount for differential probabilities of selection, making\nour NSHAP statistics representative of White Americans\nfound that the prevalence of sexual activity, marital status,\navailability of a (potential) sexual partner, and sexual activ-\nity within marriage was similar between WLS and NSHAP\n(Supplementary Material).\nDependent Variables: Intimate Relationships at\nWe examine three outcomes in 2004 when respondents\nare 64 years old. Our first outcome is a dichotomous\nmeasure of being sexually active for the entire sample to\nestablish a broad picture of the determinants of sexual\nactivity in later life. In order for respondents to be asked\nabout sexual frequency (the basis of the dichotomous \"is\nsexually active\" outcome measure), the respondent had\nto report being currently married or, if unmarried, also\nreport having a sexual partner. Respondents who were\nneither married nor unmarried not reporting a sexual\npartner were assigned a value of zero sexual frequency.\nGiven the importance of partner availability for sexual\nactivity, and that both marital and non-marital (i.e., dat-\ning) relationships provide access to partners, our second\noutcome is a measure of access to (potential) sexual\npartnership. This is based in part on a question posed to\nunmarried respondents on whether they have access to a\nsexual partner. To examine whether adolescent attractive-\nness matters to access to partners among the unmarried\nlater in life as well as in marriage, we compare the relative\nrisk ratios of being unmarried with a sexual partner and\nbeing married compared with being unmarried without a\nsexual partner. Finally, as marriage is a key relationship\ncontext for sexual activity in later life, our third outcome\nis a dichotomous measure of sexual activity among the\ncurrently married. Sexual activity for the first and third\noutcomes was ascertained using the question: \"During\nthe past 12 months, about how often did you have sex\nwith your spouse or partner?\" in the mail questionnaire.\nResponses were then recoded as dichotomous variables in\nwhich 0 = no sexual activity and 1 = any sexual activity.\nThe examination of the role of adolescent attractive-\nness for relationships formed in early midlife (generally\nappearing as long-term marriages in our data) and later life\n(unmarried sexual partnerships), as well as sexual activity\nwithin the context of marriage enables us to examine how\nthe relationship between adolescent attractiveness and sex-\nual expression may vary by life course stage and relationship\ncontext. Given theoretical and empirical work that suggests\nthe importance of attractiveness for initial partnering, we\nexpect that adolescent attractiveness will matter most for\nthe formation of marriage earlier in the life course. We also\nexamined the association between adolescent attractive-\nness and interviewer reports of respondent attractiveness at\nage 71--the only measure of attractiveness available in the\nWLS in later life. Adolescent attractiveness is only weakly\nassociated with later-life attractiveness (|r| = .13) (authors'\ncalculations, available on request). Given this fact and prior\nwork (e.g., Karraker & DeLamater, 2013) that finds that\nsexual expression in long-term marriages is strongly associ-\nated with health and marital quality, we expect adolescent\nattractiveness will have a weaker or nonrelationship with\nthese latter two outcomes.\nKey Independent Variable: Adolescent Facial\nAttractiveness\nOur key independent variable is adolescent facial attractive-\nness, which is based on respondents' senior year yearbook\nphotographs. Yearbook photographs were rated by six male\nand six female judges from approximately the same birth\ncohort as WLS respondents. Judges rated photographs from\none (\"not at all attractive\") to eleven \"extremely attrac-\ntive\" with the aid of gender-specific anchor photos. The\nraw scores were then standardized in a series of steps that\nincluded an adjustment for each judge (to rule out judge-\nspecific effects) and then averaging the scores and normal-\nizing them to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of\none (for details see Scholz & Sicinski, 2015).\nThe WLS use of high school yearbook photographs dif-\nfers substantially from many of the measures of attractive-\nness used by other studies, which include weight, height, and\nsurvey interviewer ratings of respondent attractiveness. One\npotential benefit of relying on facial attractiveness as opposed\nto height or weight is that it may be assumed that being more\nbeautiful is beneficial for both men and women, whereas the\nbenefits of height or weight may vary according to gender\nfacial attractiveness are associated with three characteristics\n(Rhodes, 2006). Symmetrical features are preferred to asym-\nmetrical ones. More average faces--in terms of similarity to\nthe traits of the relevant population--are perceived as more\nattractive than distinctive faces. Faces that feature classic\nrepresentations of notions about masculinity or femininity\n(referred to as secondary sexual characteristics, or sexual\ndimorphism) are also more highly valued. Attractiveness\nis culturally and temporally specific, and the study's use of\nraters from approximately the same birth cohort--the same\npeople respondents would encounter in marriage markets--\nimproves confidence that the measure of attractiveness used\nis meaningful for our outcomes of interest.\nOther Covariates of Interest\nOne advantage of the WLS is that it includes a rich array\nof additional covariates that prior literature has identified\nas salient for intimate relationships in the later life course.\nOf particular interest is gender (1 = female), given that prior\nliterature indicates that men are more likely to be sexu-\nally active in and out of relationships and more likely to\nbe partnered in later life. Other measures include family\nbackground (a factor-weighted composite parental socio-\neconomic status measure incorporating parental education,\nincome, and father's educational prestige; and dichotomous\nindicators of city background and farm background), which\nmay be associated with factors such as teeth straightening\nand good nutrition that are linked to attractiveness; edu-\ncation (high school only [reference], some college, college\nor more education); marital status (married [reference],\ndivorced, widowed, never married); physical health (self-\nrated health, count of chronic conditions, indicator that\nhealth limits moderate physical activities, body mass index\n[BMI]); net worth; extraversion, neuroticism, and self-\nacceptance. We code net worth as indicators for quintiles\nof the distribution of the 2004 imputed variable supplied\nby WLS. BMI is a categorical variable based on standard\nmal weight [reference]; 25  BMI < 30, overweight; BMI \n30, obese). Finally, when modeling sexual activity among\nmarried people, we also include indicators of marital dura-\ntion in years and marital satisfaction. An examination of\nlocal linear regression models of the probability of sexual\nactivity across marital duration revealed a nonlinear rela-\ntionship between duration and sexual activity. As such, we\nmodel marital duration with splines. Based on local linear\nregression model results, we include spline knots at 6 years\nand 20 years.We measure marital satisfaction using a phone\nsurvey item asking about closeness to the current spouse,\nwith answers ranging from\"not at all close\"to\"very close\".\nAnalytic Strategy\nWe use binary logistic or multinomial logistic regression\nmodels appropriate to the particular outcome of interest.\nResults are presented as odds or relative risk ratios. We\nfocus on attractiveness coefficients, as well as how these\nchange with the inclusion of additional covariates. We also\nconducted supplementary analyses in which we included\ninteractions between attractiveness and gender. In general,\nthese interactions were not statistically significant (avail-\nable upon request).\nResults\nTable 1 presents descriptive statistics. At age 64, 66% of\nthe overall sample--and 81% of married respondents--are\nsexually active.Approximately 20% of unmarried respond-\nents (4% of the total sample) have a sexual partner. Levels\nof sexual activity and sexual partnership among the unmar-\nried declined by age 71 (available upon request).\nTable 2 displays results from logistic regression models\npredicting the likelihood of being sexually active among\nall respondents. Adolescent attractiveness is positively\nassociated with being sexually active and is completely\nexplained by marital status. Across models, divorced, wid-\nowed, and never married persons are all far less likely to be\nsexually active compared with currently married persons.\nControlling for all other covariates, good self-rated health\nis positively associated with sexual activity and obese or\noverweight persons are less likely to be sexually active com-\npared with normal weight persons. In the full model, high\nnet worth (top quintile and fourth quintilevs bottom quin-\ntile) is positively associated with sexual activity as is self-\nacceptance. Extraversion and neuroticism are not related\nto sexual activity. Women are far less likely to be sexually\nactive than men across models.\nAs Table 2 indicates the importance of attractiveness\nin facilitating sexual activity via the availability of partner\nvia marriage, Table 3 further examines how attractiveness\nmatters to access to a (potential) sexual partner. We focus\non results for unmarried persons with a sexual partner ver-\nsus without, as results for the married versus unmarried\nwithout a sexual partner may reflect reverse causality (e.g.,\nhigher net worth may either select individuals into marriage\nand/or marriage may generate higher net worth). In the full\nmodel, we find that unmarried persons rated more attrac-\ntive as adolescents are more likely to have a sexual part-\nner. Among unmarried people, women and obese persons\nare less likely to have a sexual partner, whereas individu-\nals with high net worth, greater extraversion, and greater\nneuroticism are more likely to have a sexual partner. Given\nincreases in remarriage in later life, we also examined\nwhether adolescent attractiveness predicted remarriage by\nage 64. In our sample, we find that 21% of those who were\nHowever, we found that adolescent attractiveness was not\nrelated to remarriage in later life (results not shown, avail-\nable upon request).\nTable 4 shows results from models predicting sexual\nactivity among married people at age 64. Attractiveness\nis not associated with sexual activity within marriage,\nwhereas women are less likely to be sexually active across\nmodels. We also identify a \"honeymoon effect,\" in which\nthe odds of sexual activity drop rather quickly in the first\nfew years of marriage and then decline much more slowly.\nAt about 20 years of marriage, marital sexual activity flat-\ntens out, and even appears to rise gradually subsequently.\nFurther, marital closeness is positively associated with\nsexual activity. People with worse health have lower odds\nof sexual activity in the full model. Compared with those\nwho are normal weight, overweight or obese married\npersons are less likely to be sexually active. Net worth\nis strongly and positively associated with sexual activity\nas is self-acceptance. We also considered whether adoles-\ncent attractiveness was related to quality of sexual rela-\ntionships measured as either reported physical pleasure\nor emotional satisfaction within marital sexual relation-\nships. Attractiveness did not have a statistically significant\nrelationship with either measure at either age 64 or 71\n(results available upon request).\nDiscussion\nEven as a growing body of research provides insights into\nthe importance of attractiveness in young and middle\nadulthood for intimate relationships, we know relatively\nlittle about how attractiveness earlier in life may influ-\nence intimate relationships later in life. This article offers\nthe most comprehensive attempt to address this question.\nWe find that attractiveness matters largely by providing\naccess to sexual partners, for both married and unmarried\nindividuals. We find that more attractive adolescents have\ngreater sexual activity later in life and that this relationship\nis completely mediated by marital status. The results there-\nfore point to the importance of attractiveness in facilitating\naccess to a sexual partner via marriage. Turning to our sec-\nond outcome of (potential) sexual partner availability, we\nalso found evidence that more attractive adolescents are\nalso more likely to have access to sexual partners among\nthe unmarried at older ages. We did not find, however, an\nassociation between adolescent attractiveness and remar-\nriage in later life. This suggests that attractiveness may vary\nin its importance depending on whether someone is being\nevaluated as \"marriage material\" or for a more casual rela-\ntionship. Given that many marriages begin relatively early\nin the life course (i.e., one's 20s or 30s), attractiveness is\nlinked to later life sexual activity in part through the estab-\nlishment of partnerships (mostly marriage) sometimes dec-\nades in the past. However, adolescent attractiveness also\nfacilitates romantic relationships in later life, as evidenced\nby our findings for the unmarried having a sexual partner\nMean/Proportion SE Range n\nOutcome 2: Access to (potential) sexual partnership, age 64 years\nFamily background\nPersonality and psychological well-being, 2004\nNote: BMI = body mass index; SES = socioeconomic status.\nAll independent covariates are based on analytic sample for Outcome 1.\nTable 2.

Standard errors in parentheses.\nEven as attractiveness facilitates the finding of partners,\nwe found that attractiveness is not related to measures of\nsexual activity among married couples--being sexually\nactive, physical pleasure, or emotional satisfaction. This\nfinding serves to reinforce the point that the primary ben-\nefit of attractiveness in the context of intimate relationships\nis facilitating some form of partnership. The finding may\nalso reflect the long duration of the majority of marriages\nin the sample. Though we control for duration, physical\nattractiveness may be most salient in the very beginning of\nrelationships or be important in initial attraction, rather\nthan in sustaining the relationship. As relationship duration\nincreases, initial sexual attraction, in which attractiveness is\nan important component, may be a less critical determinant\nof sexual activity, possibly supplanted by other factors such\nas health. Given that intimate relationships are occurring\nin increasingly diverse forms--dating, cohabitation, living\napart together, remarriage (e.g., Brown & Shinohara, 2013,\nDe Jong Gierveld, 2004)--future research should examine\nvariation in the determinants of sexual activity by specific\nrelationship context.\nConsistent with prior findings, we find that women are\nless likely to be married, less likely to be partnered if unmar-\nried, and less likely to be sexually active within marriage.\nThis reflects in part skewed sex ratios in which women\nincreasingly outnumber men (Karraker, DeLamater, &\nSchwartz, 2011), and the differing spousal characteristics\nof men and women of the same age, as women tend to part-\nner with men older than themselves, which are accentuated\nfurther in remarriage markets (England & McClintock,\n2009). These patterns yield large asymmetries not only the\nchronological age, but also the health of same-aged wom-\nen's and men's spouses, with women less likely to have a\nhealthy spouse.\nSupplementary analysis revealed that the relationship\nbetween attractiveness and intimate relationship outcomes\ndid not generally vary by gender in our sample. Some prior\nstudies have suggested that female facial attractiveness is\nmore important for men in heterosexual partnered activity.\nHowever, this relationship may be age dependent. A recent\nstudy (Marcinkowska, Dixson, Kozlov, & Rantala, 2015)\nfound that men's preference for facial femininity declines\nwith age, which may be related to concomitant declines\nin testosterone. This finding may partially explain why we\ndo not see significant gender interactions between attrac-\ntiveness and sexual activity outcomes in later life. Another\nexplanation may be the increasing salience of other fac-\ntors--particularly health and economic resources--for\nboth men and women as they age. Further, as notions of\nintimate relationships change over the life course (Calasanti\n& Slevin, 2001), both women and men may prioritize emo-\ntional intimacy over sexual intimacy (Lodge & Umberson,\n2012). In addition, the relationship between gender and\nattractiveness may depend on life course stage (i.e., repro-\nductive ages vs postreproductive ages), as well as how the\nparticular historical period shapes factors such as women's\neconomic status relative to men, which could generate\ngender asymmetries in the value of beauty in marriage mar-\nkets. Consistent with several other studies (e.g., DeLamater\nassociations between health, economic resources, and inti-\nmate relationship outcomes. Health and financial resources\nare both sought-after attributes in a mate (England &\nWe also observe associations between personality and\nintimate relationship outcomes. People with higher self-\nacceptance have greater sexual activity (overall and within\nmarriage) and sexual partnership among the unmarried,\nsuggesting that positive psychological well-being is ben-\neficial for sexual relationships regardless of partner context.\nExtraversion is positively associated with unmarried respond-\nents reporting a sexual partner, but is not associated with sex-\nual activity within marriage or overall. This is not surprising\ngiven that extraversion is an advantage in meeting new peo-\nple, including new potential sexual partners. In addition, neu-\nroticism is positively associated with the unmarried having\na sexual partner, which may reflect that aspects of neuroti-\ncism, especially combined with conscientiousness, are protec-\ntive of health--itself a predictor of sexual activity (Turiano,\nMroczek, Moynihan, & Chapman, 2013). Neuroticism may\ncapture some efforts to maintain attractiveness in ways not\ncaptured by health items (e.g., grooming, dressing; Flint,\n2004). Collectively, these findings point to the roles that per-\nsonality and other psychological factors may play in building\nintimate relationships later in life, inviting additional research\nto better understand how these factors matter.\nStudy Limitations\nLike any study, there are some caveats to our findings. First,\nour findings are based on a unique sample of predominantly\nWhite individuals who graduated from Wisconsin high\nour findings are specific to the experiences of this cohort and\nare not nationally representative. However, we do note that\nbased on a comparison with similar individuals in NSHAP,\nour sample resembles White Americans born around the\nsame time as WLS respondents with at least a high school\neducation (see Supplementary Material). Future research\nshould explore variation in the determinants of intimate\nrelationships by class, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and\nother factors (Calasanti & Slevin, 2001). Further, though we\ngenerally do not find differences between results for age 64\nand age 71 (results for the latter available upon request), we\ndo note that any differences in findings between ages might\nalso be interpreted as period effects rather than age effects.\nIn addition, like prior studies of sexual behavior (e.g., Call,\nSprecher, & Schwartz, 1995), some individuals refused ques-\ntions about sexual activity. In supplementary analysis, we\nfound that women who were widowed and never married\nwere more likely to refuse to answer the sexual frequency\nquestion compared with men and the currently married.\nAdolescent attractiveness, however, was not associated with\nrefusals, suggesting that our sexual activity results may be\nbiased with respect to gender and marital status but that\nour estimates of the association between attractiveness and\noutcomes suffer from little bias.\nAnother caveat to our study is the vague measure of\n\"sex\" used in the survey instrument. To the extent that\nrespondents may have different conceptualizations of\n\"sex\" we may either over- or underestimate sexual activ-\nity. We also are unable to model many characteristics of\nspouses in the case of partnered sexual activity--including\nattractiveness. Future work should explore how spousal\nsimilarities (via assortative mating and/or shared environ-\nments--including those related to factors such as body\nweight) and differences (e.g., health mismatches) impact\npartnered sexual activity. Finally, we do not have good\nmeasures of attractiveness in later life, precluding an\nexamination of the direct role of attractiveness in later\nlife. Despite these limitations, the present study docu-\nments the importance of adolescent attractiveness in the\nsexual life course and also demonstrates nuanced dynam-\nics in the predictors of intimate relationships within the\nlater life course.\nSupplementary Material\nPlease visit the article online at http://psychsocgerontology.\noxfordjournals.org/ to view supplementary material.\nFunding\nSince 1991, the WLS has been supported principally by the National\n041868), with additional support from the Vilas Estate Trust, the\nNational Science Foundation, the Spencer Foundation, and the\nGraduate School of the University of Wisconsin\u00adMadison.\n"
