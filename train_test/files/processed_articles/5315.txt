Catholic Central High\nSchool, which had been in existence since 1967 in one building, now offered courses to students on two campuses. The\n\"dual campus\" philosophy was adopted so as to ensure maximum program flexibility for students. The philosophy, however,\nwas destined to affect student engagement and staff efficacy as the change in organizational structure, campus locations,\nand course availability was dramatic. Changing school organizational structure also had the potential of affecting student\nachievement. A mixed-methods study utilizing engagement surveys, efficacy scales, and interviews with students and teachers\nwas used to ascertain the degree of impact. The results of the study showed that minimal impact occurred to levels of\nstudent engagement, minor negative impact to staff efficacy, and a slight increase to student achievement results.\n",

The school was a remarkable\nexample of what can be achieved when people from various\nstakeholder groups come together and plan for communal\naction. It also provides an example of innovation and growth\nwithin the proposed structural organization of a school.\nWhen Holy Spirit School Division officials and Catholic\nCentral High School personnel began to explore what struc-\nture they wanted to see in the design of a new Catholic high\nschool, they came to the realization that to maximize student\nprogramming, the idea of a \"dual campus\" high school\nshould be investigated. They realized that the existing high\nschool, even though it had run out of the space required to\nincrease program options for its students, still offered pro-\ngram specialties that could not be duplicated in a new facility\nat the same time as introducing new areas of interest for stu-\ndents. The educators and school officials struck upon the\nidea of keeping the school as one even though the campuses\nwould be located on opposite sides of the city. The original\nschool was to become Campus East and, the new structure,\nCampus West.\nNow that both campuses are open, it is important to see\nwhether the organizational structure of the school will\nserve the needs of the students and the teachers. It is also\nimportant to see whether this is a model that could serve\nother communities who may be struggling with maximiz-\ning the programming options for their students. Finally,\ngiven the current interest in 21st-century learning, and the\nconcept that learning takes place in many environments\nand should not be restricted, it would be interesting to\ndetermine whether students can embrace the idea of \"one\nschool, two buildings.\"\nTheoretical Framework\nDuring the design phase of this study, a rather exhaustive\nsurvey was completed where we looked for research dealing\nwith what we would come to call a dual campus philosophy.\nResearch into the area of schools existing on multiple sites\nand the impact that the resulting organizational structure had\non students and staff was limited. The quest then for a litera-\nture review that would form the theoretical framework for\nthis study had to take a different tack than just looking at\nwhat other researchers discovered about the impact of cam-\npus structure. Issues of student engagement, staff efficacy,\n1The University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nCarmen Mombourquette, University of Lethbridge, 4401 University Drive,\nLethbridge, Alberta, Canada T1K 3M4.\nEmail: carmen.mombourquette@uleth.ca\nDual Campus High School: A Study to\nDetermine the Impact of a Multicampus\nHigh School on Student Engagement,\nStudent Success, and Faculty Efficacy\nCarmen P.

In other words, will the change in the structure\nof the school change the student perceptions of engagement,\nstaff sense of efficacy, and what will be the overall impact on\nstudent academic achievement?\nFortunately, we had access to student and staff data for the\n3 years prior to the opening of the second campus. From that\ndata, we were able to make interpretations about the levels of\nengagement, staff efficacy, and student academic perfor-\nmance for pre- and postdual campus perspectives.\nStudent Engagement\nThe topic of student engagement has become a well-\nresearched item. So much so, that Levin (2010) stated,\n\"Engaging students in secondary school appears to be a con-\nfrom the National Research Council (NRC) suggests that a\nfocus on engagement calls attention to the connection\nbetween a student and the social context in which learning\ntakes place, namely, the school. The NRC (2005) report\nstated,\nSuccessful high school reforms convey high expectations and\npromote a sense of competence in a student's ability to succeed,\nfeelings of control over academic outcomes, beliefs in the value\nof education, and a sense of belonging and respect. Effective\nschools and effective teachers provide support and help students\nunderstand what it takes to learn and succeed in school. (p. 3)\nEven John Dewey (1938), at the turn of the previous cen-\ntury, emphasized the important link that existed between stu-\ndent engagement and student learning.\nWhile in Canada, under the direction of the Canadian\nEducation Association (CEA), tremendous gains have been\nmade in developing an understanding of the connection\nbetween student engagement and student success in school.\nThe Willms, Friesen, and Milton (2009) report, commis-\nsioned by the CEA, defined student engagement as\nthe extent to which students identify with and value schooling\noutcomes, have a sense of belonging at school, participate in\nacademic and non-academic activities, strive to meet the formal\nrequirements of schooling, and make a serious personal\ninvestment in learning. (p. 7)\ndents across the United States and their engagement in\nschool. Engagement in this study was defined in terms of\nparticipation and identification with the school. The research-\ners looked at the role of school structure, regulatory environ-\nment, and racial/ethnic composition of the students and staff.\nThe most salient results were found in relation to school\nstructure. It was found that students who went to a small\nschool attended more regularly, were more likely to partici-\npate while at school, and identified their school as a warmer\nplace. The study was conducted with students at risk for\ndropping out of high school and succumbing to delinquency.\nIt showed that engagement was an important factor in keep-\ning youth in school and suggested ways to increase student\nengagement.\nLee and Smith (1995) built on the understanding of the\nconnection between student engagement and student learn-\ning by looking at the effects of school reform and school\nrestructuring on student achievement and engagement. The\nLee and Smith study examined two types of school organiza-\ntions: bureaucratic and communal. Many of the restructuring\nefforts in American schools aimed at making a shift from\nbureaucratic (comprehensive) high schools to smaller com-\nmunal schools. Although many schools claimed to be mak-\ning efforts to reform their schools, only some schools actually\nhad reform processes effectively in place. The results of the\nstudy found that students at schools with a variety of reform\npractices experienced achievement and learning gains. They\nalso found that these achievement gains were more equally\ndistributed among members of the school than in nonreform\nschools. The same findings were found in regard to student\nengagement. In schools that attempted reform processes but\ndid not follow through with them or did not put in a valiant\neffort, the reform process could actually be harmful and lead\nto reduced engagement and achievement. Lee and Smith\nsuggested that reform processes that support personal and\nsustained connection between students and adults appear to\nbe what is important.\nYazzie-Mintz (2006) found that many factors contributed\nto student engagement, including relationship with adults in\nthe building, feeling safe in the school, and interest in school\nactivities and classes. Yazzie-Mintz concluded that students\nwant to feel as though their voices are heard when they ren-\nder opinions about what makes high school effective to them.\nThe researcher reported that many students felt that their\nanswers on questionnaires and surveys would not be taken\nseriously or effect change. The key message from this study\nwas that when making school reforms, administrators should\ntake into consideration student ideas about what needs to be\nchanged and integrate them into the reform strategies. If stu-\ndents do not feel as though they have been heard, they are\nless likely to be engaged in the school community.\nNot all schools engage students in similar ways. Willms et\nal. (2009) argued that schools differ substantially in what\nthey do to promote student engagement. The differences in\napproach and the resulting changes in the levels of engage-\nment affect student performance. Furthermore, they state,\n\"that differences among schools have less to do with stu-\ndents' family backgrounds than they do with school policies\nand practices, particularly with the learning climate\" (Willms\nMombourquette 3\nTeacher Efficacy\nTeachers'belief in their ability to positively affect the growth\nand education of their students lies at the heart of the \"effi-\ncacy\" term. Bandura (1993) related the understanding of the\nterm self-efficacy to students, individual teachers, and teach-\ners collectively when he stated,\nThere are three different levels at which perceived self-efficacy\noperates as an important contributor to academic development.\nStudents' beliefs in their efficacy to regulate their own learning\nand to master academic activities determine their aspirations,\nlevel of motivation, and academic accomplishments. Teachers'\nbeliefs in their personal efficacy to motivate and promote\nlearning affect the types of learning environments they create\nand the level of academic progress their students achieve.\nFaculties' beliefs in their collective instructional efficacy\ncontribute significantly to their schools' level of academic\nachievement. (p. 1)\nTschannen-Moran and Hoy (2001) reviewed the existing\nmeasures of teacher efficacy and sought to develop a new\nand more comprehensive measure. They explored the exist-\ning definitions and concluded that teacher efficacy is a con-\ntextual and subject-matter-specific measure of a teacher's\njudgment of his or her capacity to facilitate learning and\nengagement in students. Tschannen-Moran and Hoy devel-\noped the Ohio State Teacher Efficacy Scale (OSTES). They\nfound that teachers' efficacy beliefs would transfer to the\nextent that they perceive similarity in the task resources and\nconstraints from one teaching situation to another. Therefore,\nwhen the teaching task is changed, teacher efficacy should\nalso be reassessed to determine any corresponding changes.\nTeacher efficacy has an impact on student engagement/moti-\nvation, student achievement, and student self-efficacy.\nGoddard, Hoy, and Hoy (2000) explored the meaning of\ncollective teacher efficacy. Goddard et al. reported that col-\nlective teacher efficacy is more than the sum of teacher indi-\nvidual efficacy. It is an emergent property based on the\ndynamics of the group. Therefore, they found collective\nteacher efficacy to be the extent to which the teachers in a\nschool as a whole believe that they as a group are able to\nteach and engage students. High teacher efficacy leads to the\nacceptance of challenging goals, strong organizational effort,\nand a persistence that leads to better performance, including\nhigher academic achievement.\nThat teachers make major differences in the educational\nlives of students is certainly not a new idea (Creemers, 1994;\nstarting to become apparent is that teachers'role may be even\nmore important than students' family background (Willms et\nal., 2009). Individual teachers make a great deal of difference\nwhen it comes to affecting student achievement. Collective\nteacher work, where teachers throughout the building col-\nlaborate and share in the experience of improved practice\nwill have an even greater impact on students (Garet, Porter,\nDesimone, Birman, & Suk Yoon, 2001; Penuel, Fishman,\nConnection Between Engagement and Student\nAcademic Success\nStudent disengagement is a serious issue in schools through-\nout Canada. In a 2011 report from the CEA, Dunleavy and\nsurveyed, only 70% are socially engaged in school. They\nalso report that roughly 70% get to their classes on time, or\neven make it to school at all. The numbers start to get a little\nstarker when the issue of being engaged in learning is\nassessed. They refer to a serious emotional and cognitive\ninvestment in learning as intellectual engagement. Dunleavy\nwomen as being intellectually engaged. Klem and Connell\nof all students--urban, suburban, and rural--are chronically\ndisengaged from school\" (p. 262).\nLonczak, Abbott, Hawkins, Kosterman, and Catalano\n(2002) pointed out that when students feel connected to\nthe school, we see less use of narcotic substances, lower\nlevels of social distress and violence, and fewer instances\nof teenage pregnancies, whereas Schapps (2003) reported\nthe same is true for instances of skipping. When students\nfeel connected to school, there is less likelihood that they\nwill be truant. Similarly, Wentzel (1998) made the link\nbetween students succeeding academically, with the\nresulting higher graduation rates, when students are con-\nnected to school.\nResearch Objectives/Purpose\nNow that the dual campus school is open, and students are\nreceiving instruction in two buildings rather than one, it was\nimportant to see whether the organizational structure of the\nschool serves the needs of the students in the way that the\noriginators planned. It is also important to see whether this is\na model that could serve other communities who may be\ndealing with their own issues surrounding programming\noptions for their students. Finally, given the current interest\nin 21st-century learning, and the concept that learning takes\nplace in many environments and should not be restricted, it\nbecomes necessary to determine whether students can\nembrace the idea of \"one school, two buildings.\"\nTherefore, the purpose of this study is to determine\nwhether a dual campus organizational structure had an\nimpact on student engagement and teacher efficacy while\n4 SAGE Open\nalso ascertaining whether there is a correlation between these\ntwo variables and overall student academic achievement and\nperformance. Specifically, the following research questions\nare addressed:\nResearch Question 1: What impact has the movement\ntoward a dual campus school had on student\nengagement?\nResearch Question 2: What impact has the movement\ntoward a dual campus school had on the teachers'sense\nof efficacy?\nResearch Question 3: What impact has the movement\ntoward a dual campus school had on the courses stu-\ndents complete in their high school program?\nResearch Question 4: What impact has the movement\ntoward a dual campus school had on student academic\nperformance as determined by overall grade point\naverage (GPA)?\nImportance of Study\nCatholic Central High School and Holy Spirit School\nDivision tried an organizational structure that was nothing\nshort of being radical. It had the potential to serve as a model\nfor other schools and school divisions faced with similar\nissues. However, before it could serve as a model, its impact\nfirst needed to be studied. Looking at how programming has\nchanged and whether students feel as, less, or more engaged;\nwhether student academic performance has increased, stayed\nthe same, or decreased; and whether teachers continue to feel\nthat their work influences the lives of students, all in relation-\nship to programming, provide the story other schools will\nneed before they decide on such a radical change to meet\ntheir students' needs. This project demanded thinking\n\"beyond the box.\" The challenges inherent in a dual campus\nranged from transportation to communication--from how\nwill students and staff be transported between campuses to\nhow will students be kept connected to all that is offered at\nthe school. A concept such as this demanded answers to\nquestions that were not even considered in the initial devel-\nopment of the plan.\nMethod\nThe study was of the mixed-methods type and entailed quan-\ntitative and qualitative data gathering. Quantitative came\nfrom surveys already administered within the School\nDivision--the Teacher Schollie Survey, the Student Schollie\nSurvey, as well as the Accountability Survey of Students and\nStaff. It also came from two new surveys that were adminis-\ntered in 2011--the OSTES to determine the level of teacher\nefficacy and the Tell Them From Me Survey as a measure of\nstudent engagement. Diploma examination results along\nwith data for school completion rates, graduation rates, and\ndrop-out rates were also used. Results from the 3 years prior\nto the opening of Campus West were used as baseline data.\nQualitative data came from interviews with students and\nstaff. They provided the personal piece that gave voice to\nthe study. Interviews took place in January and February of\nParticipants\nyear of the dual campus philosophy implementation, was\n856. There were 45 teachers on staff during this 1st year of\ninvited to complete the survey) took part in the Student\nSchollie Survey, whereas 38 teachers (all teachers were\ninvited to complete the survey) completed the Teacher\nSchollie Survey. The Tell Them From Me Survey had 179\nstudent participants. The Teacher Efficacy Scale was com-\npleted by 21 teachers. In total, 19 students and 14 teachers\nwere interviewed.\nSampling Procedures\nA member of the Holy Spirit School Division central office\nstaff was responsible for inviting the students to participate\nin the Student Schollie Survey. All students were invited to\nparticipate in the survey. All teachers were given the Teacher\nSchollie Survey and asked to participate. Students participat-\ning in the Tell Them From Me Survey were selected ran-\ndomly.All teachers were given a copy of the Teacher Efficacy\nScale; 21 elected to complete it. Students who were inter-\nviewed were selected by School Administration to provide a\ndiversity of opinion and background. Teachers who were\ninterviewed were selected on a volunteer basis. All who\nwanted to be interviewed were invited to book a time with a\nresearcher.\nQuantitative Measures\nThe Teacher Schollie Survey and Student Schollie Survey\n(collectively referred to as the Schollie Surveys) presented\nthe best opportunity for making comparative statements.\nSchollie Survey information was gathered from the 3 years\nprior to the dual campus philosophy coming into operation\nand therefore could be compared with the test year. With an\nassumption of independence of the group member scores\n(e.g., very few/no individuals completed more than one sur-\nvey), we conducted one-way ANOVA/Kruskal\u00adWallis tests\n(depending on normality of distribution) to determine the\nsignificance of observed changes in engagement scores for\nstudents and staff over time.\nFor the student group, we performed multiple regression\nand principal components analysis/factor analysis. Multiple\nregression was proposed because it served to identify the\nrelative importance of various independent variables in pre-\ndicting school engagement. Regression analyses were run for\neach year of data and overall to identify those variables that\nconsistently emerged as predictors of engagement.\nMombourquette 5\nQualitative Measures\nQualitative data analysis techniques were used in the analy-\nsis of the information obtained from the individual student\nand teacher interviews. Analysis included the compilation\nand review of each interview using a thematic analysis tech-\nnique. This involved a data review searching for and refining\nthe number of themes, which appeared as common threads\nthroughout the various focus groups.\nThe following is a pointed form of the analysis that was\nused for the qualitative data:\n1. Taped interview sessions held with students and\nteachers.\n2. Interviews transcribed verbatim.\n3. First Content review conducted--Themes pulled and\ncoded by the researcher and aligned with research\nquestions.\n4. Second Content review conducted--Themes orga-\nnized into categories.\n5. Third Content review conducted--Second researcher\nasked to read through interviews and additions made\nto theme search.\n6. Validation of common themes and analysis con-\nducted for meaning.\n7. Finalized themes ready for reporting and inclusion in\nreport.\nThe integrity of the data was important, but the interpreta-\ntion of the data is what gave credence to its use in this study.\nThe researchers expended a considerable amount of time and\nenergy into the analysis, weaving all the data sources into a\ncomprehensive set of indicators and, in turn, allowed for the\nrich text descriptors of what was happening in this case.\nResults\nThree years prior to the opening of the second campus, a new\nprincipal was appointed along with a new associate princi-\npal. The third administrator at this school was an incumbent.\nAll three school leaders were in place when the second cam-\npus opened in September of 2010. During the 1st year of new\ncampus operation, a fourth school administrator was added\nto the complement, it should be noted that this person was an\nincumbent teacher at the school. The teaching staff remained\nrelatively constant over the course of the 3 years prior to the\nopening of the second campus and during Year 1 of opera-\ntions of the dual campus philosophy. Of the 45 teachers on\nstaff in Year 1 of dual campus, 34 were on staff for the 3\npreceding years. Student population was experiencing a\ncampus operation), it was 856. All quantitative analyses\nwere performed using PASW\u00ae18.\nStudent Engagement\nTwo measures were used to determine levels of student\nengagement. The first came from the results of the Student\nSchollie Survey. The second was a new survey called Tell\nThem From Me Survey. This second instrument was admin-\nistered twice. However, both administrations were in the\nthe second administration were used.\nStudent Schollie Survey Results. Kruskal\u00adWallis test was used\nto evaluate whether students' ratings on Student Schollie\nSurvey questions differed over time. The Kruskal\u00adWallis test\nfound significant differences in the mean rank between the\ngroups for seven of the questions asked. There were differ-\nences in the mean rank between the groups (only four of the\nquestions related to significance affecting the 2010 cohort\nWhitney U test with a Bonferroni correction determined that\nwere significantly different from the 2010 group.\nQuestion 6: \"My teacher challenges me to do my best.\"\nlarly to this question; however, there was a trend toward\nthis item than did students from the 2007 cohort.\nQuestion 12: \"There are enough learning materials in\nmy classroom.\" Students from the 2007 cohort responded\nless favorably to this item than did those from the 2010\nQuestion 15: \"I am kept informed of my progress.\"\nStudents from the 2007 cohort responded more favorably to\nQuestion 20: \"Homework assignments are reasonable.\"\nStudents from the 2010 cohort responded more favorably to\nAfactor analysis was used to determine whether there were\na small number of core factors underlying the survey com-\nreplaced with mean scores leaving 1,082 cases for analysis.\nSome of the variables were skewed, but were not transformed\ndue to the same response options being used for each variable.\nEighty-four multivariate outliers were observed. These cases\nwere excluded from analysis. Principal components extraction\nwas used prior to factor analysis to estimate the number of fac-\ntors, presence of variable outliers, absence of multicollinearity\nand singularity, and factorability of the correlation matrix.\nFour factors were extracted using the maximum likelihood\nprocedure and rotated using a varimax rotation procedure. The\nfactor loadings yielded four interpretable factors: safe and car-\ning learning environment, religiousness, career path and learn-\ning opportunities, and technology supports for learning. Factor\n6 SAGE Open\n1 \"Safe and caring learning environment\" accounted for\n32.9% of the item variance, Factor 2 \"Religiousness\"\naccounted for 4.1% of the item variance, Factor 3 \"Career sup-\nport and learning opportunities\" accounted for 2.7% of the\nitem variance, and Factor 4 \"Technological supports for learn-\ning\" accounted for 2.5% of the item variance.\nTwo internal consistency estimates of reliability were\ncomputed for the individual items comprising the factors\n\"Safe and caring learning environment,\" \"Religiousness,\"\n\"Career path and learning opportunities,\" and \"Technological\nsupports for learning\": a split half coefficient expressed as a\nSpearman Brown corrected correlation and coefficient alpha.\nFor the split half coefficient, the scale was split into two\nhalves such that the two halves would be as equivalent as\npossible. In splitting the items, sequencing was taken into\naccount and individual items were divided so that both halves\ncontained a mixture of odd and even items. All four factors\nattained better than acceptable reliability values (.7).\nThe Kruskal\u00adWallis test found no significant differences\nin the mean rank between the year-based cohorts for the vari-\nables--Safe and caring learning environment, 2(3, N = 998)\np = .148; Career and supportive learning opportunities, 2(3,\nTellThem From Me Survey Results. In June of 2011, students at\nthis school participated in the Tell Them From Me Survey\nconducted by an organization called The Learning Bar\n(www.thelearningbar.com). This survey compares the school\nwith Canadian norms (see Table 1).\nStudent Academic Achievement.We examined student aca-\ndemic achievement for the 3 years prior to the study to estab-\nlish a baseline for comparison with the 1st year of\nimplementation of the dual campus philosophy. Table 2 dis-\nplays the results as a raw number of Credit Earned Units\n(CEUs) and the percentage each category represents of all\ncourses completed.\nSchool Accountability Data. We examined the school data that\nwere gleaned from the Provincial Accountability data. This\ninformation is contained in Table 3.\nStudent Interview Feedback. Students were selected by School\nAdministration for inclusion as a candidate for interview--\nten Grade 10 students were selected, six Grade 11, and three\nGrade 12 students were interviewed. All but one of the stu-\ndents had spent some of their years on both campuses. Data\nfrom the students revealed three general themes: transporta-\ntion, friends, and opportunities. These items were addressed\nby all the students during their interviews. In addition, a\nnumber of lesser themes were identified; some, but not all of\nthe students, addressed them. These themes included stu-\ndent-based decision making, small school atmosphere, bring-\ning students together, and communication.\nThe students recognized that if the School Division had\nsimply created a new stand-alone high school on the west\nside of the city, then students would not have had access to\nall specialty courses that were available in the dual campus\nmode. School of choice would have dictated what courses\nthey would have been able to complete. They also extended\nthat line of thinking to learning spaces like the gym, sports\nfields, fitness center, hallways, cafeteria, and classrooms.\nStudents understood the importance of having these spaces\navailable to all and not be reserved just for the students who\nhappened to attend that particular building. We could inter-\npret from the responses of the students interviewed that they\nunderstood the logic of increased opportunity as a rationale\nfor the dual campus philosophy.\nStudents also identified two general themes where they\nfelt that dual campuses interfered with their lives. Being sep-\narated from their friends and transportation were issues for\nthe students. The money charged by the School Division for\ntransportation was identified as being unfair and that it cre-\nated a negative image about the dual campus. Transportation\nwas viewed as necessary for getting them back and forth\nbetween the buildings, and they were not to be charged.\nNoon hour transportation was an issue--catching the bus on\ntime and missing opportunities to be with friends. A number\nof students also identified the confused nature of the trans-\nportation system at the start of the year. However, students\nalso appreciated that as the year went on, the system\nimproved.\nStudent Survey Question 5 had the students think about\nthe rationale for creating a dual campus rather than two\nstand-alone schools. The question presented a preamble that\nhighlighted the ideas of increased course and extracurricular\noptions available in the dual campus philosophy. They were\nthen asked to weigh this idea against creating two stand-\nalone schools where students would always be together with\ntheir friends yet may not have the courses or extracurricular\nspecialties available. When asked this question, 17 students\nsaid they preferred the dual campus, 2 said they would rather\nhave the single school even if it meant less courses and extra-\ncurricular options. The following are direct quotes from what\nthey said:\nI prefer the dual campus because even though I have to transfer\nbetween schools I get more opportunities to do different things\nlike preengineering class. I'm taking pre-engineering and it\nwouldn't have been available without the dual campus. (Student\nI definitely would want the two campuses because you know the\ntraveling is annoying but it's not so annoying that you wouldn't\nwant all of the opportunities that you have.

(Student 9)\nStudent 14 related that he or she would have liked to\nhave seen just one campus and defended that position by\nsaying,\nI'd probably say the one school with less programs. Even though\nit's nice with all the new options that we have. But sometimes\nit's hard to access them with the whole shuttling thing. So I'd\nprobably say just the one campus with less options.\nTeacher Efficacy\nInterpretations about the concept of teacher efficacy, and the\ndegree to which it changed or remained constant, were made\nfrom data gathered from the Teacher Schollie Survey, the\nOSTES, and from teacher interview feedback.\nMombourquette 9\nTeacher Schollie Survey Results.The Kruskal\u00adWallis test\nfound significant differences in the mean rank scores across\nthe different years only for Question 21, which was about the\noverall communication between the jurisdiction and the\nMann\u00adWhitney U tests with a Bonferroni correction deter-\nmined that teachers' satisfaction ranking to this question was\nOSTES.\"Teacher efficacy has proved to be powerfully\nrelated to many meaningful outcomes such as teachers' per-\nsistence, enthusiasm, commitment and instructional behav-\niours, as well as student outcomes such as achievement,\nmotivation, and self-efficacy beliefs\" (Tschannen-Moran &\nOSTES has the validity and reliability to allow its use in\nschools and for interpretations to be made.\nInstructional efficacy mentions items related to the ways\nin which teachers instructed students. Items pertaining to\nassessment, questioning, extra help, teaching strategy diver-\nsity, learning levels of students, and appropriate challenges\nwere assessed in this area.\nManagement efficacy looked at items related to student\ncontrol and the ways in which teachers dealt with behavior.\nItems pertaining to behavior, following rules, calming stu-\ndents, management systems, defiance, disruption to learning,\nand expectations were assessed in this area.\nEngagement efficacy meanwhile looked at items related\nto setting the conditions necessary to get students to want to\nlearn. To that end, items pertaining to students believing in\nthemselves, value of learning, motivation, role of families in\nstudent learning, thinking critically, and fostering creativity\nwere assessed in this version of the concept.\nThe norms generated from three separate validity and reli-\nability studies present the following categories of efficacy as\nmeasured by the OSTES: Instruction (M = 7.3, SD = 1.1),\nSD = 1.1). The OSTES was completed by 21 teachers. The\nresults for this group of teachers were as follows: Instruction\nTeacher Interview Feedback. As with the student responses,\nwe also see some general themes emerging from across the\nresponses provided by the teachers. The themes identified\nare programming/opportunities for students, organiza-\ntional difficulties, and the importance of team atmosphere.\nEach of these general themes was made up of subthemes.\nThe theme of programming/opportunities included new\ncourses, spaces for students to learn (gym, science labs,\nlibrary), and less crowding. The organizational difficulties\ntheme referred to transportation and travel glitches, lack\nof vision as the campuses opened, lack of support from\nSchool Division, and timetabling issues. The theme of\nteam atmosphere included items like small school atmo-\nsphere, feeling part of the organization, confidence in the\nability of staff to make it work, and the pride of doing\nsomething special and new as well as being something that\nnobody had ever done before.\nProgramming-type comments were the most often stated,\npositive and negative, about the new system. Teachers identi-\nfied the ability of students to take courses that were of inter-\nest to them as being the driving force for the construction of\nthe new school and that it was the reason they were most in\nfavor of the dual campus philosophy. Included in the pro-\ngramming comments were those associated with the useful-\nness of the new learning spaces that came with the building.\nThe gymnasium, fitness center, science labs, preengineering\nlab, and the new library were singled out for special mention\nand the positive impact they had on student learning. The\nteachers also identified that crowding had been a major issue\nin Campus East prior to the second building's opening. The\ncrowding issues were alleviated with the second building.\nCoaches appreciated the availability of the second gym.\nTransportation was addressed as a major issue with the\nstart of the dual campus philosophy. It was identified as the\nissue that should have been better thought out prior to open-\ning the second campus. However, teachers also acknowl-\nedged that as the year progressed, most of the issues were\nrectified. They were clear in their condemnation of charging\nstudents for transportation, as it did not send out a message\nof support for the dual campus. Travel was also mentioned in\nconnection with students and teachers needing to go between\ncampuses at noon. There was a general sense that this should\nnot be necessary. The travel issue tied directly into the whole\nidea of organizational leadership. Teachers felt that more\ntechnical type issues associated with the dual campuses\ncould have been rectified with increased communication and\ncommittee type meetings focused on problem solving. Even\nthough the teachers recognized the shared ownership they\nfelt in the concept's design, it was a little less evident with\nthe opening of the second campus itself.\nThere was a very strong sense of teacher efficacy in the\ncomments made during the interviews. Teachers spoke about\nthe pride they had in the creation of something new. They\nalso acknowledged the importance of the feeling of \"team\"\nthat the planning for the dual campus philosophy helped cre-\nate. Teachers addressed the fact that the change allowed the\nschool to return to a small school environment, only this\ntime, it was in two buildings rather than one. Yet, they also\nexpressed comments that indicated that some of that good\nfeeling associated with the new campus being opened dissi-\npated as the realities of how difficult it would be to make the\nsystem work actually sunk in. There was also a bit of a diver-\ngence of opinion between comments made by experienced\nteachers and those new to the school. The experienced teach-\ners, those who also played a major role in planning for the\nnew campus, were much more adamant about how the dual\ncampus was contributing to the life of the school, the stu-\ndents, and to teaching. While new teachers felt the system\nwas helping students in the school, they also felt that the\nwork associated with making it work was onerous.\nData, quantitative and qualitative, present evidence of a\nsystem that is working. Students and teachers interviewed\nacknowledge some of the growing pains associated with the\nchange inherent in the dual campus philosophy being imple-\nmented. The survey data paint a picture of a continuation of\nthe existing norms connected to the way in which students\nviewed the organization the 3 years prior to dual campus\nopening. The same is true for the teacher survey data--con-\ntinuation of the norm from the 3 previous years. Attention\nnow needs to be turned to making sense of these data and\ndrawing from them statements that can be made in relation to\nstudent engagement impact, teacher efficacy influences, and\nstudent programming connections.\nDiscussion\nIn a nutshell, the question of \"what has been the impact?\"\nstill needs to be answered. In this section of the article, we\nwill take a look at what has been the impact on student\nengagement, staff efficacy, and student programming options\nand achievement.\nStudent Engagement\nThe data gleaned from the Schollie Surveys have been infor-\nmative in that very little, if any, change occurred in the way\nthe students perceived their school, the staff, and their place\nin the organization. We expected to see a change in the way\nstudents completed the Student Schollie Survey as the stu-\ndents of this school just underwent a major change in the\nstructure of their school. Students, however, answered ques-\ntions like, \"The staff at my school care about me,\" \"I am\nsatisfied with the extracurricular activities,\" \"I am satisfied\nwith the opportunities to make decisions about how I learn,\"\n\"My teachers help me learn,\" \"Students are encouraged to\nbecome involved in school activities,\" \"There is a Christian\nattitude among the staff,\" and \"The school provides opportu-\nnities for students to become involved in volunteer activities\nand community service\" in much the same way in 2010 as\nthey did in any of the 3 previous years. These questions cover\ndiverse areas of student relationship to the school and the\nlearning program. They also connect to various understand-\nings of student engagement. The results from this survey\nreinforce the findings of the NRC (2005) when they made it\nclear, \"Successful high school reforms convey high expecta-\ntions and promote a sense of competence in a student's abil-\nity to succeed, feelings of control over academic outcomes,\nbeliefs in the value of education, and a sense of belonging\nand respect\" (p. 3). Furthermore, the data support the NRC's\nconclusion, \"Effective schools and effective teachers provide\nsupport and help students understand what it takes to learn\nand succeed in school\" (p. 3).\nThe data gleaned from the Tell Them From Me Survey\npresent evidence of a school community that is attempting to\nmake a difference in the lives of its students through the\nwork of its teachers and staff. It is interesting to note that the\nschool presents as average (the scores for this school are\nsimilar to those in the national sample) for items like\n\"Students that value school outcomes\" or \"Students are regu-\nlarly truant.\" Yet, this school's results for items that go to the\nheart of the teacher\u00adstudent relationship are significantly\nhigher than those from the national norm. The evidence from\nthe Tell Them From Me Survey reinforces what the Student\nSchollie Survey data were saying. We can interpret from the\ndata that the teacher\u00adstudent relationship is sound, that there\nis positive learning climate, and that expectations are high\nyet reasonable.\nFrom the interview data, we are able to infer that the stu-\ndents are satisfied with the change to the dual campus orga-\nnizational structure. They understand the rationale for the\nchange occurring and are willing to give the school a chance\nto make the new structure work for them. However, the\nschool needs to be aware of some dark clouds on the horizon\nwhen it comes to long-term acceptance of the new order.\nFirst and foremost, the school needs to be aware of the need\nto continue to provide opportunities for teachers and students\nto connect and to form healthy relationships. To do so, the\ntransportation issue is going to have to be resolved. Having\nstudents pay for a bus pass to go from one campus to the\nother will not be sustainable from the students'point of view,\nnor will the continued requirement of students being forced\nto move between campuses at the noon hour. In rare cases,\nwhere students want particular teachers, noon hour move-\nment might have to continue. Change needs to happen to cre-\nate opportunities in both buildings for core courses (science,\nsocial studies, English, math, religious studies, etc.) to occur\nin such a way that students need only to make the choice of\ncampus based on the specialty program (pre-engineering,\nnew media, languages, fine arts, etc.) they want to take. By\nkeeping student movement at noon hour to the minimum, the\nschool can then take full advantage of the \"Flex Time\" that is\nbuilt into the system and allow for greater teacher\u00adstudent\ninteraction. The school will need to pay attention to teachers\nnot moving back and forth at the noon hour--for the same\nreason that it is not prudent for students. The movement\ninterferes with the development of the healthy interactions\nthat build positive school culture.\nSecond, the students are accepting of the fact that the sec-\nond campus was needed for programming-type issues. That\npoint appeared as significant in each of the student inter-\nviews. However, students noted that as the year progressed,\nsome of that rationale was starting to wear a little thin.\nTransportation glitches made the point obvious, but other\nless obvious issues like lack of course availability were also\nbeing noted. Foods class was identified as a prime example.\nWith the new school came a second Foods Lab, yet the num-\nber of sections of Foods dropped from the previous year to\nthe year of opening. They also recognized that a course with\na large Career and Technology Studies (CTS) lab attached\nwas not even offered once the new school opened. To keep\nthe programming issue alive, and well accepted, the school\nwill need to remain vigilant in its quest to have the specialty\nprograms available to students.\nThird, the students spoke about being involved in the\ndecision-making process. Yazzie-Mintz (2006) highlighted\nthe importance of student voice being taken as valuable.\nYazzie-Mintz indicated that valuing student opinion was a\nmeans to increase student engagement. When students\nbelieved that their voices were not being heard, they became\nless engaged and in turn less inclined to do well at school.\nBeing heard may become an issue in the next few years with\nthis school. Students mentioned in their interviews that since\nthe start of the new school year, they felt people were too\nbusy to pay attention to them. The school should be search-\ning for ways for the student voices to be expressed and to be\nshown to make a difference in the way the dual campus\nevolves.\nFourth, the work of Lee and Smith (1995), even though it is\ngetting to be dated, provides a sounding board for change and\nits impact on students. They highlighted the need for schools\nthat are attempting large-scale change to be viewed as orga-\nnized and focused on making the project successful. Some of\nthe students noticed that the change to the dual campus organi-\nzational structure was not as smooth as it should have been. If\nthe reform effort is to prove to be long lasting and having a\npositive impact on students, then the involvement of students\nthemselves in the planning process will be required.\nFinally, the issue of small school environment showed\nthrough in the feedback from students. They did not address\nthe issue directly but mentioned in their statements the dif-\nferent \"feel\" that now existed in the two buildings--less stu-\ndents in the hall, more classrooms being available, more\nopportunities to talk to teachers--Campus West having a\ncalming effect on people. The atmosphere of a small school\nneeds to be addressed and used as an area of strength and\ngrowth within the school culture.\nStaff Efficacy\nOne of the most salient points that arose from the data was\none of the long-standing teachers viewing the move to dual\ncampus in a much more positive light than teachers new to\nthe school. Both groups, according to the interview feed-\nback, were willing to work with the new organizational\nstructure and that they could see the positives built into the\nsystem, yet there was a difference in perspective between the\ntwo. Bandura (1993) stated, \"Teachers' beliefs in their per-\nsonal efficacy to motivate and promote learning affect the\ntypes of learning environments they create and the level of\nacademic progress their students achieve\" (p. 1). The more\nexperienced teachers spoke about their roles in helping shape\nthe way the dual campus philosophy was developed and\nimplemented. They were able to relate the roles they played\nindividually to the way the project came together in the plan-\nning phases and, in turn, its implementation. The newer\nteachers did not have the same track record with the project\nand, therefore, interpreted the impact of the change in a more\nnegative light. Even the experienced teachers, however,\nspoke about the need to bring back a greater commitment to\ncommittees and individual teacher input into the running of\nthe school and making the dual campus philosophy work in\nthe future.\nAs we do not have longitudinal data from multiple admin-\nistrations of the OSTES, we are careful about drawing too\nmany conclusions about that aspect of teacher efficacy.\nHowever, we do note the major difference in the Engagement\nscore from the school norm to that of the norm established in\nthe OSTES itself. The OSTES mean was 7.3, while the\nschool's mean was 6.6 when dealing with questions related\nto the teachers' impact in helping to get students engaged.\nThis item will need to be monitored over the next few years.\nAs with the students, it was interesting to see that in the\nTeacher Schollie data, however, there was virtually no differ-\nence in the way the teachers of this school perceived the\nschool during the 1st year of dual campus operations than the\nways in which they perceived the organization in the previ-\nous 2 years. These data speak about the resiliency of teachers\nin accommodating themselves to new ideas, especially if\nthey have a say in shaping what the idea looks like.\nInterview data revealed a number of issues that school\nleadership will need to address. Transportation and move-\nment back and forth between the campuses will need to be\nstudied. Evidence from data suggests that teachers' lives\nshould be brought into the equation as the school tries to deal\nwith the issue of movement at noon. Teachers expressed a\nneed to be on one campus for the day, and that movement\nfrom quarter to quarter would work much better for all\nconcerned.\nThe data also suggest that the system is working as well as\nit is because the teachers believe it was the best decision the\nschool could have made. The teachers interviewed were\nclear in their desire to not see a separate and discrete school\nas being a better option. The teachers also believed that stu-\ndent programming was a driving force for the new system\nand that collectively they could find ways to better deal with\nmaking the programs work for students. A number of teach-\ners, however, mentioned in their interview that if the school\ncould not develop more effective ways for teachers to get\ntogether with colleagues, perhaps they would have to revisit\nthe structure.\nEngagement and Student Academic Success\nA statistically significant correlation between student\nengagement and academic success cannot be made from the\ndata that we collected. In this study, all we can do is present\nsome observations.\nThe theoretical framework of this article presented\nresearch that made connections between the importance of\nstudent engagement and student achievement at school. We\nwill use their findings to make a generalization that if student\nengagement scores go down, so too will their achievement.\nThat if students feel less connected to the school, believe that\nthe teachers are not really there to support them, that the\ncomfort and warmth they feel when they get to school is less-\nened in some way, then a corresponding drop in achievement\nwill in all likelihood occur (Dewey, 1938; Finn & Voelkl,\nThe data from this study present a picture that student\nengagement remained relatively constant in the 1st year of\nthe dual campus implementation. However, we see some\ninteresting changes in a number of achievement areas. Table\n3 presented the achievement data for the school year 2010-\n2011 and compared the results with the 3 previous years.\nFrom these data, we see relatively constant results for items\n\"safe and caring,\" \"program of studies,\" and \"education\nquality.\" We also noted a healthy increase in \"high school\ncompletion rates\" and a positive drop in the \"drop-out rate,\"\nwhile scores associated with student academic achievement\neither stayed the same or increased. What is most remarkable\nabout the achievement scores is a full 2% increase in stu-\ndents receiving an acceptable score on their provincial\ndiploma exams. This score is further highlighted by the fact\nthat in the same year, the percentage of all students in the\nprovince achieving an acceptable score went down by 1.4%\nfrom the 3-year average.\nProgramming was also affected by the move to dual cam-\npus. A programming area that achieved a dramatic increase\nin student enrollment was that of CTS, an increase that came\nin part due to the offering of a preengineering program.\nStudents flocked to the course. The school had only planned\non offering one or two sections, but, in the end, offered six.\nOther areas like fine arts, options, and Registered\nApprenticeship Program and Work Experience (RAP/WE)\nremained relatively constant. Languages experienced a\ndecline in enrollment, one that had been steadily occurring\nfor the previous 3 years. Core courses (English, science,\nmath, social studies) also remained relatively constant. From\nthese data, we can extrapolate that by keeping the two build-\nings together as one school, they were able to achieve conti-\nnuity of program. In other words, the dual campus fulfilled\nits mandate of keeping programming options for students as\nflexible and achievable as possible.\nStudents remained engaged to the same degree they were\nprior to the second campus being implemented, teacher effi-\ncacy remained similar to previous years, and student pro-\ngrammingandachievementremainedconstantorexperienced\na small upswing. We are left with the opinion that the school\nwas able to achieve that which it set out to do. However, we\nmust be cognizant that it is too early to draw too many solid\nconclusions. For the next 2 years, the surveys will be\nreadministered, achievement results will be analyzed, and\nstudents and teachers will be interviewed. Future findings\nwill provide evidence of the impact of the dual campus orga-\nnizational structure on student engagement, student achieve-\nment, and teacher efficacy.\n"
