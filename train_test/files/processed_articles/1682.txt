The present study examined the relationship between insulin resistance and both waist circumference and\ncardiorespiratory fitness in U.S. adolescents. Methods. NHANES assessed a nationally representative sample of U.S. adolescents\ncardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen uptake (VO2\nmax) from a treadmill exercise test). Insulin resistance was estimated from\nfasting insulin and glucose using the homeostatic model assessment method (i.e., HOMA) and was log-transformed. Results. 1078\nadolescents were included in the study. Positive correlations existed between lnHOMA and waist circumference (r = 0.59; r = 0.54)\nfor boys and girls, respectively. lnHOMA and VO2\nmax were inversely related in boys (r = -0.29) but not girls (r = -0.06.)\nGender-specific analyses by BMI category showed that the significant inverse relationship in lnHOMA and VO2\nmax was primarily\npresent in obese boys. Conclusion. Among adolescents, important gender and BMI differences exist in the relationship between\ninsulin resistance and fitness. While waist circumference and BMI are important predictors in all children, fitness appears especially\nimportant in obese boys. These findings may have important implications for gender-specific interventions to prevent adult obesity\nand diabetes mellitus.\n1. Introduction\nRecent studies have identified a growing epidemic of child-\nhood obesity in the United States [1, 2] and it has been\nestimated that one in three US children born in 2000 will\ndevelop diabetes mellitus at some point in their lifetime\n[3]. Hannon et al. [4] have reviewed the pathophysiologic\nrelationship between childhood obesity and the subsequent\ndevelopment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. The importance of\ninsulin resistance in this process was underscored by Bacha et\nal. [5] who demonstrated that, in obese adolescents of similar\nbody mass index (BMI), the relative magnitude of insulin\nresistance at any given BMI value contributed substantially\nto the risk for metabolic comorbidities and diabetes mellitus.\nIn addition to obesity levels, cardioresipratory fitness\nmay influence insulin resistance; however, to what degree is\nstill unclear. Data in adults suggests that abdominal adiposity\nis a stronger predictor of insulin resistance than fitness [6].\nThis relationship in children has been the subject of multiple\ninvestigations [7\u00ad11] with varying results. Works by Ball\net al. [9], and Krekoukia et al. [12] in children describe\nthe relatively greater importance of central adiposity/waist\ncircumference as a determinant of insulin resistance. In\ncontrast, Allen et al. [7] and Kasa-Vubu et al. [13] suggest\nthat cardiorespiratory fitness is of greater importance as\na determinant of insulin resistance in children and young\nadults. Imperatore et al. [14] describe the importance of\ncardiorespiratory fitness to insulin sensitivity, but did not\nstudy the relative contribution of abdominal adiposity.\nWhile, Lee et al. [15] first described the distribution of\ninsulin resistance in adolescents using the homeostatic model\nassessment (HOMA), they did not examine the relative\ncontributions of either abdominal adiposity or cardiorespi-\nratory fitness. Rizzo et al. [16] and Lee et al. [11] reported\nthat the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and\ninsulin sensitivity in children is mediated by the degree of\n2  \nadiposity. Further, Eisenmann et al. [10] found that, within\na BMI category, increased cardiorespiratory fitness improved\ninsulin sensitivity in children.\nData reported by Pate et al. [17] from NHANES on\n12\u00ad19 years old adolescents suggests that cardiorespiratory\nfitness is higher in boys than in girls and is reduced\nin overweight adolescents; however, the authors did not\nexamine the relationship to insulin resistance. Given the\ninconclusive results, the purpose of this study was to examine\nthe relationship of waist circumference and cardiorespiratory\nfitness to insulin resistance by weight category, race, gender,\nand age in a large nationally representative sample of US\n2. Methods\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is conducted annually by the National Center\nfor Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention (CDC) and provides data on a variety of\nhealth and nutritional parameters for US citizens. NHANES\nuses complex probability sampling with a cluster sample\nthe present study because adolescents aged 12\u00ad19 years\nold were oversampled in these years to provide more\nprecise population estimates. The NHANES protocol was\napproved by the CDC's institutional review board and\nwritten informed consent, from legal guardians, and minor\nassent was obtained.\nThe present study included all children aged 12\u00ad18\nyears old who participated in the fasting subsample of\ncardiorespiratory fitness data. Data was analyzed in 2008.\nThose excluded from the study were those who did not have\na fasting blood sample or those who were excluded from\nexercise treadmill testing because of cardiovascular or pul-\nmonary conditions, morbid obesity, pregnancy, amputation\nor disability, or other conditions, or medication use that\nmight pose a risk.\nBMI was calculated from height and weight measured\nby trained technicians using methods described by the\nNHANES manual for anthropometrics [18\u00ad20]. Using the\nCDC growth charts for US children, BMI values were\nthen used to categorize each adolescent as normal weight\nor obese (95th percentile) [21]. Waist circumference, a\nmeasure of abdominal adiposity, was measured to the\nnearest 0.1 cm at the highest point of the iliac crest. The\ntechnicians were trained on the proper procedures for\nmeasuring waist circumference and reliability checks were\nconducted throughout the data collection process [20].\nWaist circumference was chosen as a measure of abdominal\nadiposity in this study because of its availability in NHANES\ndatabases, because it can be easily and reliably measured\nin primary care practices, and because it is associated with\nCardiorespiratory fitness was measured using a sub-\nmaximal exercise treadmill test using a protocol specific\nto the individual's predicted fitness level and designed to\nachieve 80% of the age-predicted maximal heart rate [25].\nThe technicians were trained on the proper procedures for\nadministering the aerobic fitness test and reliability checks\nwere conducted throughout the data collection process\nby experienced personnel [25]. Estimated maximal oxygen\nuptake (VO2max) was determined by extrapolation of data\nfrom the heart rate response following the two main stages\nof the treadmill exercise test to an expected age-specific heart\nrate standard as specified by NHANES.\nVenous blood was obtained following at least an 8-\nhour fast and was analyzed for glucose by the hexokinase\ntechnique and for insulin by radioimmunoassay technique as\ndescribed in the NHANES methods [26]. The homeostatic\nmodel assessment (HOMA) was used to estimate insulin\nresistance, based on the work of Keskin et al. [27] who found\nit to have acceptable sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing\ninsulin resistance in children. HOMA was calculated from\nfasting glucose and insulin as follows: the product of the\nfasting value of glucose (expressed as mg/dL) and insulin\n(expressed as U/mL) is divided by 405. The resulting value\nwas subsequently log transformed (lnHOMA) to normalize\nthe distribution.\nFor statistical analysis, univariate comparisons utilized\nPearson correlation coefficients for continuous variables (i.e.,\nage, BMI, waist circumference, VO2max, and lnHOMA)\nusing SPSS (Version 15, Statistical Package for the Social\nSciences, Chicago; IL). T-tests and analysis of variance with\nBonferoni correction were used for multiple within gender\ncomparisons of means by tertiles (high fitness for boys,\nresp.) and (low fitness for boys, girls; VO2max  42.99,\n35.81, resp.) of cardiorespiratory fitness using SAS-callable\nSUDAAN (version 9, SAS, Cary, NC).\nMultivariate analysis involved the construction of several\nlinear regression models. These models examined the relative\nassociation of waist circumference, BMI, and VO2max with\nlnHOMA by gender, while controlling for the effects of age\n(in months), and race (Caucasian versus non-Caucasian). In\nthe final regression model, waist circumference and VO2max\nwere compared directly in all adolescents and in those with\na normal BMI versus those over the 85th percentile, and\nBMI was excluded from the model because of the potential\ninteraction of BMI and waist circumference.\nAll analyses utilized NHANES weights to accommodate\nfor the complex sampling design of NHANES. The weights\naccount for the geographic probability sampling methods,\nthe oversampling of specific groups such as minorities and\nadolescents, and are designed to insure the representativeness\nof the weighted findings to that of all adolescents in the U.S.\nStatistical significance was set at alpha < 0.05.\n3. Results\nA total of 1,078 adolescents from the NHANES database\naged 12\u00ad18 years with complete data were included in the\npresent analysis and their demographic characteristics are\nshown in Table 1. Forty-six percent of the participants were\ngirls and 38% were non-Caucasian (includes 14% African\n  3\nTable 1: Characteristics of the study sample by gender.\nObesity status (%)\nBMI: body mass index; P <.01 boys versus girls.\nTable 2: Pearson product moment correlation coefficients between\nwaist circumference, VO2\nmax, BMI, and lnHOMA by gender.\nBMI: body mass index; P <.01.\nAmerican, 11% Mexican American, and 13% other races).\nThe majority of participants were normal weight and 36%\nwere either overweight or obese. The distribution of obesity\nstatus was similar between boys and girls. Estimated VO2max\nwas significantly higher in boys than girls (P <.01); however,\nthere was no significant difference in waist circumference\nby gender. The mean age for the participants in the\nnormal, overweight, and obese groups was similar; however,\nmean HOMA was significantly higher in the overweight\n<.001) groups than in normal weight adolescents. Likewise,\nmean waist circumference was significantly higher in the\nadolescents. In contrast, estimated VO2max was higher in\nthe normal weight group (44.5 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1) compared\nTable 2 shows the correlation coefficients between\nlnHOMA, VO2max, waist circumference, and BMI for the\nentire sample and by gender. For the total sample, a positive\nand significant relationship existed between lnHOMA and\nboth waist circumference and BMI. There was a mod-\nest inverse relationship between lnHOMA and estimated\nWhen the correlations were separated by gender, the\nmoderate and significantly positive correlations were still\nobserved between lnHOMA and both waist circumference\nand BMI for both boys and girls. Further, a modest yet\nsignificant inverse correlation was present between lnHOMA\nand estimated VO2max for boys, but not for girls. To clarify\nthe role of estimated VO2max within gender, we separated\nboys and girls into tertiles based on their estimated VO2max\nand found a significant pattern of differences in HOMA\nin boys by fitness level (see Figure 1). By contrast, mean\nHOMA values in girls by fitness level did not show a\nconsistent pattern. Interestingly, when we compared normal\nweight low fitness boys and girls to overweight/obese high\nfitness boys and girls a difference was only observed among\nthe girls. A subanalysis examined this relationship with\nVO2max corrected by lean body mass. Lean body mass was\ndetermined by DEXA and was available on 536 adolescents.\nAfter correcting for lean body mass, mean HOMA values\nwere similar across fitness and obesity categories for both\nboys and girls (data not shown). Therefore, among boys the\ndifferences observed in HOMA values by fitness were no\nlonger present.\nThe initial regression analysis for lnHOMA, BMI, waist\ncircumference, and estimated VO2max for the entire sample\nand by gender, controlling for race and age is presented\nin Table 3. For all children, waist circumference, BMI, and\nestimated VO2max were significant independent predictors\nof lnHOMA after adjusting for race and age. Gender-\nspecific analyses showed that BMI remained a significant\nindependent predictor of lnHOMA in both boys and girls.\nHowever, waist circumference and estimated VO2max were\nboth significant independent predictors of lnHOMA in boys,\nbut not girls. In the final model comparing only waist\ncircumference and estimated VO2max without BMI (see\nTable 3), waist circumference remained a significant inde-\npendent predictor for both boys and girls while estimated\nVO2max was a significant independent predictor for only\nboys and not girls. To clarify this further, separate gender-\nspecific regression models were run by BMI group (normal\nversus >85th percentile), and demonstrated that, among\nboys, waist circumference was a significant independent\npredictor of lnHOMA in both BMI groups while cardiores-\npiratory fitness was a significant independent predictor of\nlnHOMA only in the group above the 85th percentile of BMI\nfor age and gender (data not shown). Among girls, waist\ncircumference was a significant independent predictor of\nlnHOMA in both BMI groups while cardiorespiratory fitness\nwas not a significant independent predictor of lnHOMA in\neither BMI group (data not shown).\n4.

Univariate analysis showed that increasing abdom-\ninal adiposity, as measured by waist circumference, was\nassociated with increasing insulin resistance, as measured by\nHOMA. Similar results have been demonstrated by other\ninvestigators using various markers for insulin resistance and\nand age, increased abdominal adiposity was associated with\ninsulin resistance for the entire sample and in boys and girls.\nInterestingly, others have reported a relationship between\ninsulin resistance and total percent body fat in boys, but\nnot girls [7]. A possible reason for the difference in results\nbetween the current study and Allen et al. [7] is due to\nparticipant and methodological differences. In the Allen et\nal. [7] study, participants were younger (Mean age = 12.9\nyears) and were all obese (BMI  30 kg\u00b7m-2). In contrast,\nthe NHANES sample used in the current study consisted\nof participants averaging 14 years old and the majority of\nparticipants were normal weight. Further, Allen et al. [7]\nmeasured percent body fat; whereas the current study was\ninterested in abdominal adiposity as measured via waist\ncircumference.\nAbdominal adiposity is not the only concern; overall\nBMI may also be a factor in insulin resistance. Univariate\nanalysis showed that BMI was related to lnHOMA in the total\nsample and within each gender. Further, after controlling for\nrace and age, BMI remained as an independent predictor\nof lnHOMA in both genders. Others have reported that\nHOMA scores and other insulin resistance measures increase\nshowed that increasing levels of cardiorespiratory fitness\nare associated with lower levels of insulin resistance for\nall children. A study by Krekoukia et al. [12] showed that\ncardiorespiratory fitness was not a significant predictor of\ninsulin resistance. One possible reason for differing results is\nthat Krekoukia et al. [12] measured cardiorespiratory fitness\nusing a cycle ergometer and the age of the participants\n  5\nwas 9\u00ad11 years old, whereas, the current study used a\ntreadmill protocol and the participants were 12\u00ad18 years old.\nThe cycle ergometer could have produced localized muscle\nfatigue earlier than the treadmill, or the lower physiological\ndevelopment of the participants in the Krekoukia et al. [12]\nstudy could have limited performance of the exercise test.\nWhen separated by fitness level, significant differences\nin insulin resistance were observed in boys, but not in girls.\nInterestingly, when we compared HOMA levels across fitness\nlevels, overweight/obese high fit girls had higher HOMA\nvalues compared to normal weight low fit girls. A similar\nfinding was not observed among the boys; the HOMA levels\nof these two groups were similar in the boys. These results\nsuggest that fitness is an important factor in boys more so\nthan girls. However, in a subanalysis, after adjusting aerobic\nfitness level by lean body mass, there were no differences\nin HOMA values within the normal and overweight/obese\ngroups. The lack of difference in HOMA values could be\ndue to similar lean body mass levels among boys within the\nlow fitness = 52.0 \u00b1 1.7 kg) groups. To the best of our\nknowledge other studies have not examined the relationship\nof fitness and fatness with HOMA by gender in this manner.\nIn the final regression model, after controlling for race\nand age, the relationship between insulin resistance and\nVO2max was maintained in all adolescents and among boys\nsuggesting a greater relative importance of cardiorespiratory\nfitness as a predictor of insulin resistance in boys. In\nparticular, this relationship remained significant only in\nthose boys over the 85th percentile of BMI for age and\ngender, a group at higher risk for adult obesity and diabetes\nmellitus. This is an important finding and suggests that\ngreater cardiorespiratory fitness in overweight boys leads to\nbiological changes in insulin and glucose metabolism that\nmay be protective with respect to the risk of Type 2 diabetes\nmellitus. Indeed, Shaibi et al. [30] have shown that exercise in\nboys can lead to marked improvement in insulin sensitivity\nwithout changes in body composition.\nBy contrast, in girls no relationship between estimated\nVO2max and lnHOMA was observed, regardless of BMI\ngroup, suggesting that cardiorespiratory fitness is a less\nimportant predictor in females. These findings support\nthe gender differences observed in a study by Allen et al.\n[7]. They found that in boys, fitness levels had a stronger\nrelationship with insulin resistance than percent body fat.\nWhereas, in girls, no relationship between either percent\nbody fat and HOMA or VO2max adjusted for lean body mass\nwas observed [7]. Our findings are similar to Allen et al. [7]\nfor the relationship between VO2max and lnHOMA among\ngirls even though they used a different method to estimate\npercent body fat and a younger, smaller non-population-\nbased sample.\nThe observed gender differences in the current study\ncould be due to the differences in cardiorespiratory fitness\n[17]. Differences in physical activity participation by the gen-\nders might explain why boys have higher cardiorespiratory\nfitness levels than girls. Girl's physical activity participation,\nespecially vigorous-intensity physical activity, declines as\nthey age more than boys [31]. According to a recent paper\nthat measured physical activity levels objectively, 10%\u00ad11.9%\nof boys from 12 to 19 years old are meeting current physical\n19 years old are meeting physical activity guidelines [31].\nDifferences in the relationship between cardiorespiratory\nfitness and insulin resistance may also relate to the complex\nand differing physiologic and psychosocial effects of puberty\nin boys and girls. Girls often have a decline in VO2max in late\npuberty in association with weight gain while boys frequently\nhave an increase in cardiovascular fitness in late puberty [32].\nWe have found that fitness level (VO2max) is an indepen-\ndent predictor of insulin resistance in boys. Even among boys\nwho are overweight or obese those with the highest fitness\nlevels do not meet criteria for insulin resistance (HOMA >\n3.26) while overweight and obese boys in the middle and\nlow tertiles for fitness are insulin resistant (HOMA levels\nof about 3.5 and 5.0, resp.). In contrast, overweight and\nobese girls are, on average, all insulin resistant, irrespective\nof their fitness tertile. Girls in this study had lower fitness\nthan lower physical activity levels, for the lower fitness\nlevels in girls is due to less lean body mass (muscle mass)\nthan boys. Lean body mass in girls ranged from 34.5 kg to\nTherefore, differences may be due, in large part, to the higher\npercentage lean body mass (muscle mass) found in boys than\nin girls [33]. Even the average VO2max for the highest fitness\ntertile of overweight and obese girls was lower than that\nof the lowest fitness tertile for overweight and obese boys\nThis observation suggests that fitness levels in overweight\nand obese girls, irrespective of their fitness tertile, fall\nbelow a threshold that protects against insulin resistance\nin the face of obesity. Hence all overweight and obese\ngirls might benefit from interventions designed not only to\nreduce abdominal adiposity/waist circumference and BMI\n(independent predictors of IR) but to increase fitness above\nthis theoretical threshold. In contrast, among overweight and\nobese boys significant insulin resistance was only seen at\nthe lowest fitness level. Consequently, the relative value of\ninterventions to improve fitness in order to promote insulin\nsensitivity in most overweight and obese boys requires\nadditional investigation to determine which boys may derive\nspecific benefit in terms of insulin sensitivity.\nThis study has some limitations; first, this was a cross-\nsectional study design. Given this design it is difficult to\nidentify which factor developed first, insulin resistance or\nobesity and thus causality cannot be determined. These data\nare only applicable to children with 12 years or older, as blood\nsamples were not obtained from younger children. Further,\nfor this age group, a clinical standard for measuring insulin\nresistance is lacking. While there are many different methods,\nHOMA was used in this study to estimate insulin resistance.\nHOMA has shown to be a valid and reliable method for\nquantifying insulin resistance in adolescents [27, 34, 35]. In\naddition, Tanner staging was not assessed in the NHANES\n6  \ntesting, so a good measure of sexual development is lacking.\nTherefore, adolescents of similar chronological age may have\nbeen at different stages of puberty, resulting in variability in\nmeasures of insulin resistance. Although not as accurate as\nmeasures such as dual energy absorptiometry, we measured\nbody fatness by measures commonly used in the clinical\nsetting (i.e., BMI and waist circumference) to facilitate\nbroader applicability. Although a structured protocol and\ntrained measurers were utilized, there is limited information\nabout the exact procedures for confirming the reliability of\nanthropometric measures. Finally, cardiorespiratory fitness\nwas estimated based on a submaximal treadmill test. While\na maximal cardiorespiratory fitness test was not conducted,\nthis is the largest number of adolescents in the US that have\ncompleted aerobic fitness testing.\n5. Conclusion\nAmong adolescents, important gender and weight category\ndifferences exist in the relationship between insulin resis-\ntance and cardiorespiratory fitness. While waist circumfer-\nence and BMI are important predictors of insulin resistance\nin all children, fitness may be more important in boys,\nespecially overweight boys, than girls. Our results suggest\nthat the determination of cardiorespiratory fitness in boys,\nusing a safe, noninvasive submaximal exercise treadmill\ntest may provide additional clinically relevant information\npertaining to insulin resistance. Longitudinal studies are\nneeded to determine if low cardiorespiratory fitness and\nassociated insulin resistance, as shown here, are predictive\nof higher risks for developing Type 2 diabetes. If so, early\ndetermination of cardiorespiratory fitness could help guide\nnot only who is in most need of intervention but also the\nnature of the interventions offered.\n"
