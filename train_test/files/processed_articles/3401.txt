    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe armed conflict between militias and government forces in Nigeria's Niger Delta region has spanned for more than two\ndecades, defying all solutions. A disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) program was established in August\n2015 in effort to end the violence and has remained in place. It is a radically different approach from past approaches that\ndisplayed zero tolerance to all political challenges to oil production or the allocation of oil profits. The approach appeared to\nbe immediately successful in that it forced a ceasefire, engaged militants in planned programs to rehabilitate and reintegrate\nthem into civilian society, and opened up the oil wells (many of which had been shut due to the crisis) with the effect of\nincreasing government revenue, which depends 85% on oil exports. Yet, few studies have attempted to understand the\ndynamics within the country that are responsible for the design and implementation of this broad policy shift or to understand\nwhether and how the current initiative is able to end the conflict and institute peace beyond the short term. This study,\ntherefore, is important because it provides a critical perspective that anticipates and explains emerging issues with the Niger\nDelta Amnesty Program, which have implications for DDR adaptation and implementation all over the world. Ultimately, the\nresearch demonstrates how the DDR program both transforms the Niger Delta conflict and becomes embroiled in intense\ncontestations not only about the mechanism for transforming the targeted population but also whether and how the program\nincorporates women who are being deprioritized by the program.\n",

Between\nrevenue and about 97% of foreign exchange (United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, 2006). Yet, the increase in oil\nwealth did not translate into improved standard of living for\nNigerians, especially people of the Niger Delta. Instead,\nincreases in poverty and inequality rates coincide with the\ndiscovery of oil and with increases in oil production and oil\nearnings. According to Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian\nincreased to $325 per capita, GDP per capita remained at the\nevidence such as this leads to the conclusion that Nigeria had\nsuffered from the \"resource curse.\" Waste, corruption, fiscal\nirresponsibility, political instability, and poor policy formu-\nlation and implementation had become the legacies of the\ncountry's globally acclaimed oil wealth and the veneer of the\nprotracted violence in the delta region.\nThe issue of resource curse also encapsulates the tension\nbetween environmental security, resources, politics, and vio-\nlence in the delta. Generally, interest in the environment and\nconflict concatenates around two antiquated ideas: demo-\ngraphically induced scarcity and environmental agency.\nSince the 1990s, there has been a dramatic increase in inter-\nest in the environment as a source of political conflict and as\nthe Cold War security problematic (M. Watts, Okonta, &\nKemedi, 2004). Interest in these issues peaked after the pub-\nlication of Tad Homer-Dixon's (1999) \"Environment,\nScarcity and Violence,\" Robert Kaplan's (2000) \"The\nComing Anarchy,\" and Michael Klare's (2001) \"Resource\nWars.\" These works and many others which focus on the\nenvironment raise questions concerning environmental deg-\nradation, rehabilitation, and conservation. For example,\nKaplan in \"The Coming Anarchy\" suggested that Africa is\naffected by severe environmental changes that results from\nimproper exploitation of natural resource wealth. These\nchanges or \"eco-demographic\" pressures from oil spills,\nhave impoverished, undernourished, and encouraged ordi-\nnary people, many of whom were displaced from farmlands,\nto engage in egregious acts of violence.\nhave examined polities dominated by oil revenue and the\nmechanisms through which rent-seeking produce what M.\nfor example, observe that oil rent in Nigeria have historically\nsustained a \"parasitic ruling elite\" and enabled the state to\nfraudulently purchase political consent from exploited minori-\nties while maintaining the \"delicate northern hegemony within\na competitive multi-ethnic polity\" (p. 4). Consent is obtained\nthrough a derivation principle that distributes oil rents and roy-\nalties to states, and this is complicated by massive institutional\ncorruption. Related to this is Paul Collier's (2000) \"predation\"\nargument in which he suggests that oil-resource dependency\nencourages and enables powerful people to prey on oil assets\nand oil revenue, becoming the basis of the protracted violence\nin the delta. It is the opportunity or feasibility of predation by\nboth governments and militias that inspires violence and\nensures that conflicts are never fully resolved.\nFinally, ethnicity, particularly the mobilization of ethnic\nidentity has frequently added fuel to the delta conflict.\ngest a relationship between Nigeria's post-colonial political\nstructure and the Niger Delta violence. The studies highlight\nthe role that a large (and expanding) federal government,\nseverely weakened states, over-indulged ethnic majorities,\nand marginalized ethnic minorities play in the delta conflict.\nFor example, Mamdani suggests that cultural indigeneity has\nbecome the basis of ethnicity and identifies the multiple\nways by which ethnicity is invented and reinvented within\nthe arena of oil politics, often leading to conflict. M. Watts\net al. suggest that local forms of community and the mobili-\nzation of ethnic identity within these communities have been\ncritical components of the social relations of oil extraction.\nThe way that these relations are forged, negotiated, and\nreconfigured (including land use and reform, customary\nlaws, territoriality, contact with oil companies, and forms of\nidentification: ethnicity, gender, age, chieftaincy, and clan-\nship) and particularly linkages to forms of traditional author-\nity and locally specific forms of capitalist development, have\nplayed important roles in the delta's conflict landscape.\nThe above factors as well as others produced a new type of\nresistance movement in the delta. Whereas in the past, resis-\ntance to oil production took the form of ideological struggle,\naimed at both deconstructing and reconstructing mainstream\nideas about the state, the delta's people and resources, and the\nlogics of oil wealth appropriation and distribution; the new\nresistance movement is existentialist, showcasing not just the\nvisceral antipathy of the people toward the governance\nmotions of the state but also the location of militias, their\nsponsors, and members in the entrenched, convoluted rent-\nseeking distributional coalitions that privilege individuals and\ngroups that are proximate to the political state. Unlike the past\nresistance that was led by intellectuals like the late Kenule\nSaro-Wiwa, the Ogoni playwright and activist who was judi-\ncially murdered by the Sani Abacha military junta, and which\ntargeted the state, oil majors, and the broader system of mer-\ncantile capitalism, the new resistance is led by cult gangs in\nalliance with politicians and target the state, oil majors, rival\ncult gangs, and anyone who poses a threat to their clandestine\ninterests. Irrespective of who the target of the new resistance\nOkonofua 3\nis, the armed struggle produced, within relatively brief com-\npass, countless deaths as well as unquantifiable economic and\nConsidering the above and in response to the apparent\nintractibility of the violence, the government of President\nYar'Adua believed that the continued deployment of soldiers\nand reliance on force to subdue opposition to the prevailing\noil regime, including the system of production (that indis-\ncriminately pollutes the delta ecology), allocation of oil min-\ning rights (that discriminates against delta communities), and\ndistribution of oil revenues and profits (that increased the\nvisceral hate for oil majors and the government among local\npeople), would be ineffectual. In place of force, the govern-\nment established the NDAP: a comprehensive system of dia-\nlogue, rehabilitation, and development. Specifically, the\nNDAP will demilitarize the Niger Delta by encouraging\nmilitias to surrender their arms and weapons, break the links\nbetween fighters and their militias, reintegrate fighters into\ncivil society by providing them with appropriate social skills,\nprovide direly needed but sorely lacking social and economic\ninfrastructure for the entire region, and restore full oil pro-\nduction activities in the Niger Delta to avoid the looming\nnational economic disaster. The NDAP commenced on\nAugust 6, 2009, and was expected to and has been eagerly\ntouted as helping to end or significantly reduce the violence\nended or significantly reduced the violence?\nFrom the start, the program was conceptualized as a one-\nstop shop for all activities related to restoring peace to the\ntroubled region. With this broad agenda, however, came enor-\nmous ambiguity about the specific purposes, processes,\nmechanisms, and expected outcomes of the program. The\nambiguity or lack of clarity was exacerbated by the govern-\nment's apparent failure to incorporate mechanisms or a strat-\negyforassessingtheprogram'sperformanceandeffectiveness,\nwhich is a major deficit considering that ambiguous strategic\nplanning throughout a programming and implementation\ncycle may undermine desired outcomes (Pugel, 2009). This\nstudy is conceived as a sort of post-hoc corrective of this defi-\ncit by using survey results of program participants as proxy to\nsystematically assess the performance of the NDAP. This will\nreveal existing gaps between outputs and outcomes, if they\nexist. More specifically, the study moves beyond what Pugel\nsuccess,\" which determines DDR success by whether or not a\nstate relapses into war, to focus on whether the program\naddresses the conditions of dual or multiple sovereignty\n(Tilly, 1973) that gave rise to the violence in the first place.\nThere are several reasons why this approach is important.\nFirst, research in social psychology and anthropology shows\ncongruence between reintegration success and several factors,\nincluding exposure to violence (Dyregrov, Jested, & Rundle,\nVincent, 2003), and gender (Mazurana, McKay, Carlson, &\nKasper, 2002). Beyond these, however, scholars who have\nreviewed the literature on demobilization and reintegration are\nyet to find systematic theories about the conditions under\nwhich some combatants but not others will give up their arms\nand reintegrate into civilian life (Humphreys & Weinstein,\n2009). In particular, most efforts to engage the Niger Delta\nviolence have been largely partisan, sensational, emotional,\nand lacking in empirical and theoretical depth; making it\nalmost impossible to contextualize both the violence and the\nNDAP or to give the issues theoretical nuance. This study uses\nJohn Paul Lederach's (1997) conflict transformation theory to\nexplain the extent (and conditions) of the NDAP success as\nwell as to frame the general conditions and contributions of\nDDR interventions in building peace in conflicted African\ncommunities.\nSecond, while selective amnesties like the NDAP are used\nindiscriminately to form terms of peace settlements and to\nkeep societies racked by armed conflict from slipping back\nMuggah, 2009), there is great skepticism about their perfor-\nmance in the broader scheme of things, especially given the\npotential for uneven, short term, and/or unsystematic fund-\ning and engagement of these programs. Because of these\nconcerns, there is clearly the need for a thoughtful examina-\ntion of the NDAP to document what elements operating\nwithin or outside of the program contributed to the observed\noutcomes, which can provide lessons that may support or\nimprove the implementation of this or similar programs. This\nwould offer the best opportunity, yet, for developing distinc-\ntive theoretical and practical approaches required to effec-\ntively end resource-based conflicts, build sustainable peace,\nand enable the integrated development of communities\naffected by armed conflict all over Africa.\nFinally, the violence, which appeared to abate immedi-\nately following the implementation of the NDAP, has steadily\nresurfaced, especially in the offshore and many believe that\nwith the outcome of Nigeria's 2015 presidential election,\nwhich did not favor Goodluck Jonathan, the incumbent who\nis from the region, the violence will resurface on a grand\nscale. It has, with the Niger Delta Avengers blowing up pipe-\nlines and sabotaging oil assets, critically impacting the coun-\ntry's oil output. Yet, the NDAP was conceptualized and\nidealized as the long-term solution for the delta \"problem\"\nthat will survive any presidential administration. In addition,\nmanagers of the program as well as top officials of the\nNigerian government have been enthusiastically celebrating\nthe \"wonderful\" successes of the program, which others,\nespecially opponents of the Jonathan government criticize as\na huge drain on the country's resources and incapable of\ndelivering the type of outcomes attributed to it. Considering\nthe above, but especially the vast contributions of time,\nmoney, and resources invested by the Nigerian government\nand other stakeholders in efforts to entrench long-standing\npeace in the delta, this study is tremendously important as it\noffers a means to understand how and where the investments\n4 SAGE Open\nare being applied as well as whether or not the intervention is\nachieving the impact in the community that the government\nand other stakeholders desire.\nTheoretical Framing\nThis analysis of the NDAP may be discussed theoretically\nunder the sign of conflict transformation. The theory offers a\nframework to discuss not only the cause(s) of the Niger Delta\nconflict but also the appropriate mechanisms for changing\nthe complex conflict dynamics of the delta. Using this\napproach, it is trite to perceive the NDAP as being wedged in\nthe middle of a major conceptual rift: a historical legacy of\necological abuse mixed with structural violence that has\nspurred enormous rage, protests, and violence, and the need\nfor order in light of contemporary realities, especially dwin-\ndling oil revenue and the potential impact of the delta vio-\nlence on Nigeria's economic and political stability. For the\nNDAP to produce long-standing peace, it must anticipate and\nengage the host of forces, including crescive structural fis-\nsures that gave rise to the conflict in the first place.\nConflict transformation theory is relatively new in the field\nof peacebuilding. However, the core of the theory draws on\nmany of the familiar concepts of conflict management and\nconflict resolution. Because of its ideological linkage to these,\nconflict transformation is not entirely seen as a new approach\nbut as a re-conceptualization of the field to make it more rele-\nvant to contemporary conflict situations (Miall, 2004). This\nre-conceptualization is imperative due to changes in the nature\nof contemporary conflicts. For example, most contemporary\nconflicts occur within national boundaries impelled asymmet-\nrically by structural conditions, including inequities of power\nand resource appropriation and distribution. Also, as Smith\n(2004) observes, many contemporary conflicts are protracted\nand marked by sporadic periods of violence and peace. In this\ncase, conflict occurs in waves--rising precipitously until some\naccommodation is reached and then falling off dramatically\n(almost to the point that there is a marked absence of conflict)\nand then rising again. Protracted conflicts not only upset social\nequilibriums but also ultimately distort society, creating com-\nplex emergencies.\nThe conflict transformation approach embodies three dis-\ntinct theoretical motions: conflict management (Bloomfield\n& Reilly, 1998), conflict resolution (Deutsch & Coleman,\nmanagement has been defined by Bloomfield and Reilly\npositive and constructive handling of difference and divergence.\nRather than advocating methods for removing conflict . . .\naddresses the more realistic question of managing conflict: how\nto deal with it in a constructive way, how to bring opposing sides\ntogether in a cooperative process, how to design a practical,\nachievable, cooperative system for the constructive management\nof differences. (p. 18)\nFor theorists and practitioners working within this tradi-\ntion, violent conflicts result from differences in values and\ninterests embedded within the structure of society. Because\nthese differences are entrenched within macro and micro\nsocial structures--historical experiences, institutional rela-\ntionships, resource appropriation and distribution, existing\npower coalitions, racism/ethnicity/tribalism, egos, and so\non--they cannot be eradicated. The best society can do is to\nmanage the conflict and prevent it from escalating in such a\nway that it potentially disrupts the smooth running of society.\nOccasionally, as Miall (2004) points out, it may be possible\nto arrive at a historic compromise resulting in the temporary\nabandonment or suspension of violence to allow peace to\nthrive temporarily. The goal of conflict management, there-\nfore, is to achieve political settlements leveraging the\nresources of certain key actors that are powerful enough to\nexert pressure on the conflicting parties to settle or to guide\nthe inevitable conflict into appropriate channels.\nConflict resolution theory, unlike conflict management\ntheory, focuses on intervention by skilled but powerless third\nparties operating outside of the political system who enable\nconflicting parties to understand, explore, analyze, question,\nreframe, and synthesize their positions and interests. Theorists\nworking within this tradition denounce the systemic approach\nof conflict management theorists as ineffectual and incapable\nof resolving conflicts because they ignore the communal and\nidentity depths from which conflicts spring. They argue that\npeople involved in identity-based conflicts are often unwilling\nto negotiate compromise; instead, the roots of the conflict\nmust be explored to evolve creative resolutions that the con-\nflicting parties may have missed due to their previously\nentrenched positions. Therefore, conflict resolution essentially\ninvolves helping the parties of conflict to transition from zero-\nsum destructive engagements to positive-sum outcomes\nthis approach because of the sense of \"definitiveness\" or\n\"finality\" about it and because its language \"implies finding a\nsolution to a problem.\" Thus, instead of building \"something\nthat is desired,\" it fixates on \"ending something that is not\ndesired\" (p.17). Conflict transformation focuses on how to\nbuild the type of peace that all stakeholders desire.Thus, con-\nflict transformation extends conflict management and conflict\nresolution theories beyond the mere reframing of positions\nand the identification of positive outcomes to include concern\nwith creating a new system, process, or approach that consoli-\ndates and leverages the gains from ending a conflict into build-\ning peace. Defined by Lederach (2003) as envisioning and\nresponding to \"the ebb and flow of social conflict as life-giv-\ning opportunities for creating constructive change processes\nthat reduce violence, increase justice in direct interaction and\nsocial structures, and respond to real-life problems in human\nrelationships\" (p. 18), it investigates the nature of the conflict-\ning parties, including their operational structures, historical\nexperiences, and relationships that extend conflicts beyond\nOkonofua 5\nspecific sites. According to Miall (2004), it is a \"process of\nengaging with and transforming the relationships, interests,\ndiscourses, and, if necessary, the very constitution of society\nthat supports the continuation of violent conflict.\" By interro-\ngating and affecting these domains (i.e., both episodes of con-\nflict such as the actual fighting and the epicenter of conflict\nsuch as the web of relational patterns, including the history of\nlived episodes from which new episodes of conflict emerge),\nconflicts may be transformed from their virulent, destructive\nform to situations amenable to all conflicting parties.\nI use the principle components of the conflict transforma-\ntion theory to evaluate the NDAP in order to determine\nwhether it is able to transcend the delta's conflict episodes and\ninterrogate the epicenter or the core of the conflict. The enor-\nmity of the forces at play in the delta, especially the region's\nstrategic importance to global energy production and the costs\nof the NDAP intervention, demands this type of assessment.\nLiterature Review\nOrigin of the NDAP\nThe Niger Delta region, the heart of Nigeria's oil production\nactivities, is one of the most diverse regions in the world in\nterms of human, animal, and plant life (Okonofua, 2013). The\nregion covers a distance of about 270 miles along the Atlantic\nCoast and stretches for about 120 miles inland, and is\ndescribed as the largest wetland in Africa and the second larg-\nest in the world after the Mississippi. The region also contains\nthe largest oil deposits in Africa and some of the highest qual-\nity oil in the world. It is the delta's oil, which indubitably has\nunprecedented economic and geo-strategic significance and\nvalue (M. Watts et al., 2004) and associated relationships,\nespecially being the mainstay of the Nigerian economy (Ikein,\nabout the region, at least, until the early 2000s.\nSince 1956 when oil was first discovered in commercial\nquantities in Oloibiri, a small rural community in Bayelsa\nstate, an estimated US$1 trillion has been generated from oil\nexports not including the many billions generated clandes-\ntinely from the illegal trade in stolen crude (Okonofua, 2013).\nYet, the region is one of the most polluted in the world with\ndaily oil spills, the size of the Exxon-Valdez oil disaster in the\nUnited States as well as effluent deliberately discharged into\nthe environment, polluting the delta's ecology and killing\nfauna, fish species, and land animals and dramatically reduc-\ning the region's limited stock of arable land. This situation has\ndislocated millions of local peoples from the local industry\n(typically farming and fishing) and displaced millions more\nwho are forced to migrate to cities where they have limited\nskills and resources to survive. Thrust correspondingly into\nartificial dependent and unproductive relationships in urban\nshanties and hyperghettoized neighborhoods, millions of the\ndelta's people, who are some of the poorest people in the\nworld, have developed low self-worth and fatalistic attitudes\nthat lend themselves to the violent defiance of constituted\nauthority. On some occasions, the defiance has acted out as\nmanipulative violence against social objects, especially per-\nsons in identical conditions of miserable poverty. Thus, it is\nthe unremitting economic, political, social, and environmen-\ntal marginality of the people that is the veneer for the militia\nviolence in the Niger Delta. The fight, arguably over control\nof oil resources, lucrative oil contracts, illicit patronages, and\ncorrespondingly stupendous wealth, has come to replace the\ndelta's significance as an oil-bearing region in global head-\nlines and in discussions about the region.\nKeane (1996) calls a \"zone of violence,\" which describes a\ngradual but precipitous slide into what the U.S. State\nDepartment calls \"political chaos.\" M. Watts et al. (2004)\nargue that the chaos strikes at the heart of Nigeria's politi-\ncal future; a future blighted by unmitigated environmental\ndisaster, dilapidated infrastructure, unremitting poverty\nand disease, huge debt burden, and legacy of mismanage-\nment and corruption. The human costs of the conflict,\nincluding loss of life, socio-economic disparity, rising gen-\nder inequality, educational decline, high levels of poverty\nand disease, and many less tangible costs, have been very\nbarrels of crude oil out of the nation's daily supply of 2.2\n(or barrels per day) were deliberately discharged into the\nenvironment, further depleting the fragile eco-system of\nthe Niger Delta.\nIt was ostensibly to cut the oil losses and the corresponding\nsteep decline in revenue that the Nigerian government, under\nthe leadership of late President Shehu Musa Yar'Adua inaugu-\nrated the NDAP. The president's move may have been nothing\nmore than a pacifist strategy designed only to guarantee access\nto the delta oil wells, shore up oil revenues, and mitigate some\nof the human costs of the conflict, and not toward any mean-\ningful long-term solution to the violence. In exchange for a sur-\nrender of arms and a pledge to end the fighting, combatants\nwere to receive amnesty (or freedom from prosecution), reha-\nbilitation, and reintegration into civilian society. In addition,\nthe government was to institute an elaborate program of politi-\ncal and social reforms and economic reconstruction, a huge\ndeparture from its prior zero tolerance policy to all legitimate or\nillegitimate challenges to the authority of the political state.\nThe government's reversal of its policy of non-negotiation,\nwhich may have been informed by mounting evidence (Collier,\nAina, 2009) that traditional approaches and instruments for\ndealing with intra-state armed conflicts are inadequate or too\nill-suited to effectively address the multifaceted causes of these\nconflicts, especially in deeply divided states like Nigeria, is\ncertainly refreshing, but opens up debate about what specific\ninterventions may now be applied successfully to reverse the\ndelta violence.\n6 SAGE Open\nDDR Interventions and the Challenge of\nPeacebuilding\nAlthough many organizations, including multilateral and\nbilateral agencies, continue to prioritize democracy and gover-\nnance as key to long-term stability in Africa, many shorter\nterm mechanisms for conflict prevention and peacebuilding\nare assuming growing importance (Muggah, 2009). Selective\namnesties, smart sanctions, and interventions such as DDR are\nincreasingly being used to form terms for peace, to keep post-\nconflict societies from slipping back into conflict, and to stim-\nulate economic growth and development (Doyle & Sambanis,\n2000). Paradoxically, as investments in such conflict preven-\ntion and peacebuilding initiatives are growing, there are\nincreasing doubts about whether they are capable of achieving\nthe outcomes desired or the successes attributed to them. For\nexample, critics claim that DDR programs are too often nar-\nrowly conceived, inflexible, technocratic, bureaucratic, and\ndetached from the political transition or broader recovery and\nreconstruction strategies (Muggah, 2009). Because of these\nconcerns, scholars seek more evidence that DDR can achieve\nwhat is expected and often is ascribed to it. Although Collier\nargue that the chances for DDR success increase when they\nare undertaken in collaboration between national governments\nand national and international agencies, the reality is that\nmany interventions are planned and implemented locally or\nnationally without input from critical segments of society.\nFrom a political economy perspective, DDR encapsulates\nthe strategic and bureaucratic priorities of the security and\ndevelopment sectors of a state. Because of this, Nigeria's\nadoption of DDR to solve the perennial Niger Delta violence\nought to stimulate discourse about the policy priorities of the\nNigerian government and particularly its political class or\ngoverning elites toward genuinely addressing the structural\nchallenges of the delta. If according to Duffield (2007), DDR\nis at the heart of neo-liberal forms of power and governance,\nhow is the Nigerian government using the NDAP to alter the\nconflict dynamics of the delta, including providing visibility\nfor a government that is mostly absent except when extract-\ning rent or as part of a \"broader `Weberian' project of secur-\ning the legitimate control of force\" from combatants on\nContemporary DDR approaches typically consist of a\nseries of carefully designed and phased activities aimed at\ncreating a suitable environment that would encourage stabil-\nity and development. Advocates of DDR believe that the\nthree components of the program (disarmament, demobiliza-\ntion, and reintegration) interlock and are mutually reinforcing\nactivities. Disarmament has been defined as the collection of\nsmall arms, ammunition, explosives, and light and heavy\nweapons from combatants and at times from civilians with\nthe goal of reducing the number of weapons in circulation\nrelinquishing of weapons, which are typically tied to the\nidentity of the combatant is often traumatic for combatants,\nthe disarmament process is first and foremost a confidence-\nbuilding exercise (Hithcock, 2004). DDR advocates argue\nthat disarmament is a critically important component of\npeacebuilding, but emphasize the generation of visible and\ntangible evidence of success in terms of arms and munitions\ncollected. Yet, they recognize that this component alone is\nincapable of providing the desired outcomes and must be\ncomplemented with parallel activities such as demobilization,\nreintegration, economic reconstruction, confidence and secu-\nrity enhancing activities, and the promotion of democracy\ndisarmament when undertaken with concrete verification\nmechanisms and when arms are actually destroyed has the\npotential for building confidence in the peace process among\nbelligerents, it is more beneficial for ex-combatants due to\nimproved socio-economic and political conditions to abandon\ntheir desire to acquire weapons to press their demands.\nDemobilization on its own, like disarmament, can poten-\ntially generate unintentional security dilemmas (Collier &\nHoeffler, 2004). Demobilization is seen as the process of dis-\nconnecting combatants from their armed groups or units or\nsignificantly reducing the number of combatants serving in\nwith the objective of giving back to the state its monopoly of\nviolence. Governments emerging from war frequently demo-\nbilize ex-combatants from their militias before reintegrating\nthem into the military or civilian communities. Yet, demobi-\nlization is often misunderstood and implemented as a substi-\ntute for disarmament. Thus, when governments have\ndisarmed ex-combatants, they have construed this as demo-\nbilizing them when, in fact, the ex-combatant remained\nfirmly imbedded in their organizations and the structures\nused by these organizations to create violence. In this sense,\nit becomes even more challenging for the state to achieve full\nreintegration of ex-combatants because reintegration may\nonly occur after ex-combatants have been disarmed and\ndemobilized from their prior militias or from the individuals\nthat were part of those militias. There is high possibility that\nex-combatants who remained partially organized within their\nexisting command structures can play the role of peace spoil-\ners as happened in Sierra Leone in 2000. In some cases,\nKnight and Ozerdam (2004) suggested that ex-combatants\nunintentionally reinforced latent command structures, espe-\ncially when precautions to prevent this from happening were\nnot adopted in advance. In contrast, if ex-combatants were\ntoo hastily demobilized especially when the process failed to\nadequately dismantle command and control structures as\nhappened in Angola, they could trigger insecurity in the\nReintegration, which is defined as the political, economic,\nand social integration of ex-combatants, their families, and pri-\nmary support network into civil society (Nillson, 2005), is a\ncritically important component of DDR interventions and takes\nseveral forms: political integration (in which ex-combatants,\nOkonofua 7\ntheir families, and support structure become part of the deci-\nsion-making process of their communities); economic integra-\ntion (in which ex-combatants, their families, and support\nsystem are enabled to develop their livelihoods); social integra-\ntion (in which local communities accept ex-combatants, their\nfamilies, and primary support system as members of the com-\nmunity). Muggah (2009) argues that the challenges accompa-\nnying reintegration into either category are immense.\nDepending on the context, the process is often heavily politi-\ncized and the absorptive capacities of communities for civilian\nreintegration are often greatly limited (Azam, Bevan, & Collier,\n1994). Conventional DDR, therefore, envisions a continuum\nthat extends from a narrow minimalist (establishing security) to\na broad maximalist (incorporating development) perspective\n(Jennings, 2008). The minimalist approach, according to\nMuggah (2009), is \"focused on expedience, where the program\naspires less to creating a lasting impact on the lives of ex-com-\nbatants and more to time-limited gains\" (p. 23) such as remov-\ning weapons, cantoning ex-combatants, and generally fulfilling\nthe terms of peace agreements. Although the broad strategic\ngoals of the minimalist approach includes reducing the likeli-\nhood that war will occur, the micro objectives focus on de-link-\ning the command and control of armed groups. In contrast, the\nmaximalist approach \"implies a more ambitious, transforma-\nmore ambitious interventions. They seek not only to rehabili-\ntate ex-combatants but also to reinforce public institutions and\ntheir legitimacy by promoting markets, property rights, and\nsocio-economic and political infrastructures. Maximalist\napproaches are able to achieve the goals partly by redressing\ndistortions in state spending and promoting policies and activi-\nties that stimulate economic growth and enhance human capac-\nities and endowments.\nBut despite the great enthusiasm about DDR, especially\nits utility in conflict prevention or post-conflict intervention,\na body of critical literature that questions and challenges core\nDDR assumptions is emerging (Jennings, 2008; Pouligny,\n2004). A major concern is that DDR glosses over the com-\nplexity of conflict and programs or interventions are artifi-\ncially grafted onto volatile conflict and post-conflict\nsocieties. Case studies (Humphreys & Weinstein, 2009;\nPugel, 2009), for example, demonstrate the genuine risks\nthat accompany the imposition of DDR interventions from\nthe top, especially if they are divorced from the political,\nsocial, and economic context in which violence or conflict is\nimbedded. Muggah (2009) suggests that DDR is \"too often\nresorted to in a knee-jerk fashion and launched in such a way\nthat it is isolated from the broader clutch of processes associ-\nated with governance, state consolidation and economic\nrecovery\" (p. 3). Apart from this, critics also quarrel with the\nconceptual dimensions of certain aspects of DDR, especially\nthe aspect that concerns the reintegration of former combat-\ncontend that generic approaches to reintegration are inade-\nquate for dealing with the heterogeneous and differentiated\nmotivations of armed groups, which is why combatant-cen-\ntric approaches to reintegration, like the NDAP, misfire com-\npletely. Thus, these critics who specifically target the rational\nchoice models and monetary incentives, such as payments to\ncombatants that dominate the field, argue that DDR invest-\nments should be directed, instead, to more inclusive or area-\nbased programs that focus on employment, infrastructural\ndevelopment, and economic growth.\nFinally, critics and practitioners worry that DDR lacks\nclear benchmarks or metrics to determine success. Muggah\n(2009) argues that while this is also true of other develop-\nment interventions initiated by multilateral and bilateral con-\ntributors in complex environments, the \"fact that DDR deals\nspecifically with weapons and armed groups suggests an\nextra layer of caution is warranted\" (p. 3). This extra layer of\ncaution is warranted more so in the Nigerian context, where\nthe intervention was imposed from the top with little or no\ncontribution from below and considering the multiple ambi-\nguities associated with its conceptualization, implementa-\ntion, and management.\nThe Challenge of DDR in Nigeria\nAlthough the Nigerian government has been commended for\nreversing the obtuse policy of non-engagement with insur-\ngents that stood for more than five decades and through 11\nadministrations, there is great circumspection that the\nNigerian government's DDR program is capable of engaging\nthe wider context of the conflict. In fact, there are strong\nindications that the government's conceptualization and\nimplementation of the DDR program is on all fours with his-\ntorical criticisms of DDR interventions broadly speaking\nthe government's framing and conceptualization of DDR and\neconomic reconstruction is ambiguous and contradicts theo-\nof conceptual clarity about program goals or processes has\nthe potential to confuse program implementers, ultimately\nproducing negative outcomes (Reychler, 2008). Because of\nthis, the NDAP may be incapable of delivering peace beyond\nthe short term.\nFor example, the government's framework for disarma-\nment and demobilization was inadequately specified. It was\narticulated as the return of arms and the dissolution of armed\ngroups. One problem with this simplistic conceptualization\nis that it did not properly anticipate or articulate potential\nrisks with disarming and demobilizing ex-militants. As\nscholars observe, it is common for ex-combatants to rearm\nthemselves to take advantage of expanding political opportu-\nSpear, 2006) and fighters who did not enter DDR may recruit\nrearmed former fighters to cause trouble (Mehlum & Ragner,\n8 SAGE Open\n2002). This was the case in the Republic of Congo where a\nNinja splinter group led by Frederic Bitsangou Ntumi refused\nto demobilize, going on to recruit many ex-Ninjas who had\nearlier been demobilized and using them to attack Brazzaville\n(\"Rebels Cut Train Service to Coast,\" 2004). Ex-combatants\nmay also recreate disbanded armed groups and commence\nthe case in Nicaragua in the 1990s where demobilized Contra\nrebels and the Sandinistas (government soldiers) recreated\nparallel armed groups (Recontras and Recompas) from the\nashes of their old organizations to, first force the government\nto give them reintegration assistance, and then to fight each\nother (Spencer, 1997). There is also the potential for ex-com-\nbatants to sell their military skills to armed actors involved in\narmed conflicts in foreign countries. This was the case in\nAngola and Sierra Leone where demobilized soldiers of the\nSouth African Defense Force (SADF) fought as mercenaries\nin civil wars in Angola and Sierra Leone (Kingma, 1999).\nSimilarly, ex-fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)\nhave fought in Macedonia. Apart from these, there is the\npotential for ex-combatants to demobilize and reintegrate\ninto organized criminality (Alden, 2002; Call & Stanley,\nMozambique where after the signing of the 1992 Rome\nAgreement, ex-combatants transformed their clandestine\nmilitary structures into dynamic criminal organizations\n(Alden, 2002). Because of these shortcomings, it is likely\nthat the disarmament and demobilization of ex-combatants\nin the Niger Delta may be incapable of contributing anything\nof value to the peace process, unless disarmament and demo-\nbilization are adequately conceptualized.\nSimilarly, the government's conceptualization of reinte-\ngration was problematic as there was much ambiguity about\nwhat reintegration would entail as with the proposed stages or\nphases of the implementation. For example, should reintegra-\ntion stop at economic reintegration or should it include social\nand political reintegration? Economic reintegration, which\nwas the main focus of the government is important because\nunemployment and poverty are central to the Niger Delta\nconflict. More than 75% of Niger Delta youths are unem-\nployed and almost half of these youths are unemployable\nbecause they lack skills applicable to modern industry\n(Okonta & Douglas, 2003; Osaghae, Ikelegbe, Olarinmoye,\nWatts, 2009). Therefore, the economic reintegration of ex-\nmilitants through vocational training and job creation schemes\nis important to the peace process. Also very important is their\nsocial and political integration, but this aspect appeared to\nhave been deprioritized by the government. Yet, because of\ntheir tendency toward violence such as rape, physical abuse,\nmutilation, kidnapping, murder, and so on, the return of ex-\ncombatants is capable of triggering anxiety and insecurity in\ntheir communities of return (Knight & Ozerdam, 2004;\nbeen shown to display difficulties in reconciling with their\ncommunities especially in cases where such communities\nwere intensely victimized during the conflict. This was the\ncase in Angola where ex-combatants belonging to the Jonas\nSavimbi National Union for the Total Independence ofAngola\n(UNITA) engaged host communities in violence following\nthe implementation of DDR (Nillson, 2005).\nAlso, after being disarmed and demobilized, some catego-\nries of ex-combatants (especially women, children, and dis-\nabled ex-combatants) constitute a weak and marginalized\ngroup in need of economic, psychological, and social assis-\ntance (Nillson, 2005). This situation is often exacerbated by\nwartime illnesses that continue to plague ex-combatants in\npost-conflict periods. This was the case in Uganda and Ethiopia\nwhere a large portion of the demobilized combatants were\nHIV/AIDS positive (King, 2000). Similarly, the war between\nEthiopia and Eritrea produced about 18,000 disabled ex-com-\nbatants in Ethiopia alone (Colletta, Kostner, & Wiederhofer,\npay serious attention to political reintegration as the failure to\nincorporate ex-combatants into the political mainstream can\nprovoke violence. This was the case in Mozambique where\ndemobilized guerrilla fighters from the Mozambican National\nResistance (RENAMO) were shut out of the political process\nand reacted with violence (Nillson, 2005). These reintegration\nchallenges provide the rationale for understanding how reinte-\ngration is conceptualized and implemented in this DDR pro-\ngram and whether these have any impact in altering the conflict\nlandscape of the Niger Delta. This study has the potential to\ndevelop a useful definition of reintegration that encapsulates\nthe entire complex of economic, social, and political reintegra-\ntion and that potentially roadmaps the effective reintegration of\nex-combatants in the Niger Delta.\nFinally, studies of the Niger Delta conflict implicate eco-\nnomic cleavages (i.e., poverty, unemployment, etc.) for the\n2004). Yet, the government's economic reconstruction plan\nis expressed fully as activities for ex-militants rather than as\ntargeted macro outcomes. This minimalist approach\n(Muggah, 2009) that ignores the wider context of the conflict\nmay have little impact in reducing the conflict related risks\nor in positively altering the conflict dynamics. Moreover, the\nparlous economic conditions of Niger Delta people are\ncaused and exacerbated by the indiscriminate oil excavation\nprocedures by oil companies that pollute the Niger Delta\necology, killing animal and fish species and rendering the\nsoil infertile. Yet, the conceptualization of economic recon-\nstruction was ominously silent on how economic reconstruc-\ntion will be performed, what specific projects will be\nundertaken, and how the revenues bases of communities and\npeople which were disrupted both by oil production and the\nresulting violence will be regenerated.\nConsidering the above and in the light of suggestions by\nHoward Wolpe and Steve McDonald in their 2008 article\n\"Democracy and Peace-Building: Rethinking the Conventional\nOkonofua 9\nWisdom\" that imposing peace settlements and democratic\ninstitutions by themselves cannot prevent conflict; instead,\n\"interest-based negotiation\" in which parties to the conflict\ndevelop a common understanding of shared interests and vision\nis the safest guarantee to building solid personal and institu-\ntional relationships and lasting peace, this study examines the\nNDAP to determine whether it has succeeded in altering the\ndelta's conflict dynamics and established long-term peace.\nMethod\nThe peacebuilding literature generally asserts the influence\nof DDR programs in ending conflicts and entrenching peace.\nYet, the literature appears to be silent about the specific\naspect(s) of DDR that contributes peace. This study attempts\nto fill this gap. The prospective study began in the fall of\n2010 and focused on two categories of principal actors: com-\nbatants who entered the NDAP and those who did not. A\nbaseline sample of 346 combatants was drawn from combat-\nants who entered the NDAP (n = 224) and combatants who\ndid not enter the NDAP (n = 122) through face-to-face com-\nputer-assisted interviews. In-depth interviews with important\nstakeholders, including government officials, community\nleaders, academics, activists, and non-governmental organi-\nzations (NGOs), as well as secondary open source data com-\nprising interviews conducted with managers of the NDAP,\noil executives, and combatants complemented the surveys.\nOnly the survey data acquired at baseline of combatants who\nentered the NDAP (n = 224) are analyzed in this study. This\nsample comprises of 224 adults from the delta region who\nself-identify as former combatants and entered the NDAP\nadult females, out of which 86 were married, 75 have chil-\ndren younger than age 17, and 166 were ethnic Ijaws.\nDependent variables. The dependent variables for this study are\n\"DISARMED\" uses the question \"Do you anticipate a future\nneed to acquire more weapons to pursue your objectives?\" to\nmeasure the success of the disarmament program. The measure\ntakes a value of 1 = \"disarmed\" for all those who say they will\nnot need to acquire more weapons to pursue their objectives,\nand 0 = \"not disarmed\" for all other responses. DEMOBI-\nLIZED measures links among militants or between militants\nand their organizations. The question asked, \"Who do you\nspend most of your time with?\" Responses of \"family mem-\nber,\" \"friend,\" \"neighbor,\" and \"no one/keep to myself\" were\ncoded 1 = demobilized, and response of \"member of militant\norganization\" was coded 0 = not demobilized. The measure\nalso measures the degree of social reintegration among former\ncombatants. If they spend most of their time with erstwhile\nmembers of their group compared with non-members, includ-\ning family, non-combatant friends, neighbors, and so on, they\nwill be considered socially reintegrated. REINTEGRATED\nmeasures whether respondents had reintegrated economically\nby looking at their post-NDAP employment status. The mea-\nsure is coded 1 = reintegrated if the respondent is employed\n\"full-time,\" \"part-time,\" or is \"self-employed\" and 0 = not rein-\ntegrated if she or he is \"unemployed.\" FUTVIOL measures\nwhether respondents will use violence in the future to protest\ngrievances. Specifically, the question asked, \"Considering the\nongoing amnesty program, how likely are you to continue to\nuse violence to pursue your objectives?\" Responses of \"very\nlikely\" and \"likely\" were coded 0 = not transformed, and\nresponses of \"unlikely\" and \"very unlikely\" were coded as 1 =\ntransformed. LONGTERM measures respondents' perception\nthat the NDAP will entrench peace in the long term (10+ years)\nas against the short term and midterm (1-9 years) or that the\nprogram will fail. Responses were dichotomously coded as 1 =\nsucceed and 0 = fail. TRANSFORMED measures the degree of\ntransformation in individual fighters. The question asked, \"In\nyour opinion, what is the most effective way to deal with oil-\nrelated community problems?\" Responses of \"approaching\ngovernment officials,\" \"approaching traditional rulers,\"\n\"approaching oil company officials,\" \"dialogue and negotia-\ntion,\" \"peaceful protests,\" and \"litigation\" were coded 0 =\ntransformed, and 1 = not transformed for responses of \"taking\nup arms to fight,\" \"destroying government property,\" and\n\"destroying oil infrastructure.\"\nIndependent variables. Several indicator variables were used\nin the regressions, including whether respondents entered the\nNDAP, ethnicity, community exposure to pollution, length of\ninvolvement in militancy (TIMEINV), benefits enjoyed as\nmembers of militant groups (INGROUP), and state of resi-\ndence. Additional independent control variables included\ndichotomous measures for gender and marital status.\nAnalysis. For this study, SPSS v22 logistic regression analysis\nestimating a linear trend from the observations for each person\nand then modeling the intercepts and, particularly, the slopes\nin a regression on individual- and community-level character-\nistics was used to test the main hypotheses. The operations are\nperformed hierarchically and framed in terms of the effect of\nadding predictor variables to a base equation. The base equa-\ntion regresses the outcome variables on several predictor vari-\nables in phases or steps and then evaluates the amount of the\nincremental explained variance by subtracting the squared\nmultiple correlation in the base equation from the squared\nmultiple correlation in the expanded equations. The difference\nin the squared multiple correlations is the amount of incremen-\ntal explained variance due to the additional predictors.\nResults\nTables 1 and 2 present the results of this study. Due to con-\ncerns with space and brevity, only the final models are pre-\nsented, but it should be understood that the hierarchical\noperations for each outcome variable generated three results\ncorresponding to the variables included in each phase of the\noperation. For all outcome variables, the final models, which\ninclude outputs for all of the independent variables are the best\nmodels based on the simultaneous measure of sensitivity (true\npositive) and specificity (true negative) for all possible cutoff\npoints. In addition, I present both the Beta values, which are in\nlog odds and predict the outcome variable from the predictor\nvariable and their exponential values , which are in brackets\nand are the odd ratios for the predictors. Although Beta tells\nthe amount of the increase (or decrease if the sign of the coef-\nficient is negative) in the predicted log odds of the outcome\nvariables, the  reports the odds ratio for the predictors.\nTable 1 presents results for the first 3 outcome variables\nfor the study: DISARMED (which measures disarmament),\nDEMOBILIZED (which measures both demobilization and\nsocial reintegration), and REINTEGRATED (which mea-\nsures economic reintegration). All outcome variables are\npredicted from seven independent variables: STATE (state\nof residence), MARRIED (marital status), COMEXPO\n(community exposure to oil pollution), INGROUP (com-\nparing conditions outside to militias), TIMEINV (time\nspent in militias), ETHNICITY, and GENDER. The results\nfor disarmament shows that MARRIED, INGROUP, and\nTIMEINV are significant predictors of successful disarma-\nment. Thus, married ex-combatants and ex-combatants\nwho had spent more than 5 years (compared with those who\nhad spent less than 5 years) in their militias have signifi-\ncantly lower odds of rearming themselves in pursuit of their\nobjectives, controlling for all other variables. Conversely,\nex-combatants who feel they are worse off outside the mili-\ntias than inside have significantly higher odds of rearming\nthemselves to pursue their objectives. State of residence,\ncommunity exposure to pollution, ethnicity, and gender do\nnot contribute anything of significance to the model.\nTable 1. Estimated Odds Ratios From Logistic Regression Analyses of Self-reported Outcomes of the NDAP's Disarmament,\nDemobilization, and Reintegration Program.\nDisarmament Demobilization Reintegration\nVariables\nNote. NDAP = Niger Delta Amnesty Program.\nTable 2.

NDAP = Niger Delta Amnesty Program.\nIn terms of demobilization, married ex-combatants as\nwell as ex-combatants who spent more than 5 years in mili-\ntias have significantly higher odds than unmarried ex-com-\nbatants and those who have spent less than 5 years in militias\nto demobilize and reintegrate into civilian society.\nConversely, ex-combatants who feel worse off outside than\ninside the militias and females have significantly lower odds\nof demobilizing and reintegrating into civilian society, con-\ntrolling for all other factors. Finally, married ex-combatants\nhave significantly higher odds of reintegrating economically\n(i.e., getting a job) than unmarried ex-combatants, control-\nling for all other variables. All other variables in the model\nare not significant and contribute nothing to the model.\nTable 2 above presents the results of the last set of outcome\nall a function of participating in the NDAP. The results, which\nare presented below are very illuminating. In terms of ex-com-\nbatants potential future resort to violence, the results show that\nmarried ex-combatants had significantly lower odds than\nunmarried ex-combatants to revert to violence, controlling for\nall other variables. Similarly, ex-combatants who had spent\nmore than 5 years in their militias had significantly lower odds\nof reverting to violence in the future than ex-combatants who\nhad spent less than 5 years in militias, controlling for all other\nvariables. All other variables were not significant and, there-\nfore, cannot contribute to toward the prediction of ex-combat-\nants future recourse to violence.\nThe result for the outcome variable LONGTERM, which\nmeasures ex-combatants conviction that the NDAP will be\nable to achieve long-term peace for the region, is also illumi-\nnating. Of all seven predictor variables, only INGROUP,\nTIMEINV, and ETHNICITY are significant predictors. Thus,\nex-combatants who feel they are worse off outside the militias\nthan inside them and non-Ijaw ethnicities in the delta have\nsignificantly higher odds of believing that the NDAP will not\nbe able to achieve long-term peace for the delta, controlling\nfor all other variables in the model. Conversely, ex-combat-\nants who had spent more than 5 years in their militias have\nsignificantly lower odds of believing that the NDAP will fail\nto achieve long-term peace in the delta compared with ex-\ncombatant who had spent less than 5 years in militias prior to\nentering the NDAP.\nThe survey results also have very interesting findings in\nterms of the overall transformative character of the NDAP.\nThe odds that ex-combatants will continue to espouse violence\nfor the settlement or resolution of disputes with the state/oil\ncompanies are significantly lower for married ex-combatant\nthan singles, for ex-combatants who had spent more than 5\nyears in militancy than those who had spent less than 5 years,\nand for ex-combatants who are ethnic Ijaw than other Niger\nDelta ethnic nationalities, controlling for all other variables.\nConversely, ex-combatants who feel they are worse off out-\nside the militias than inside them have significantly higher\nodds of continuing to espouse violence for conflict/dispute\nresolution, controlling for all other variables in the model.\nDiscussion\nThe primary purpose of this study is to examine the NDAP to\ndetermine whether or how well it contributes to establishing\nlong-lasting peace in the Niger Delta. My interest in the\nNiger Delta peace process stems from the observed negative\neffects of prolonged violence on Niger Delta communities as\nwell as earlier interest by researchers in the program and\nnon-program effects of DDR on protracted conflicts. For\nexample, Humphreys and Weinstein (2009) focused on the\nindividual-level determinants of demobilization and reinte-\ngration in Sierra Leone, showing that wealth, education, age,\ngender, and ideology were significant determinants of suc-\ncessful demobilization and reintegration in that country.\nSimilarly, Pugel (2009) assessed the impact of DDR on post-\nconflict reintegration and demobilization in Liberia and\nfound significant empirical evidence to support the conclu-\nsion that former combatants who entered the Liberian DDR\nprogram and completed a course of reintegration training,\nreintegrated more successfully than former combatants who\nchose not to enter the program but reintegrated on their own.\nAlthough these studies yielded useful results, they both\nfocused on demobilization and reintegration. DDR as con-\nceptualized by the UN and acknowledged by scholars,\nincluding Humphreys and Weinstein (2009) and Pugel\n(2009) involves three related activities: disarmament, demo-\nbilization, and reintegration. Understanding DDR outcomes\ncan only be complete if all aspects are examined.\nThe literature depicts DDR as an important effective strat-\negy for ending protracted armed conflicts or for preventing a\nreturn to conflict in post-conflict societies (Doyle & Sambanis,\n2000). Studies of post-conflict demobilization and reintegra-\ntion show that ex-combatants who enter DDR programs are\nmore likely to remain non-violent than ex-combatants who dis-\narmed, demobilized, and reintegrated on their own (Humphreys\nDDR achieves what is increasingly been ascribed to it. Critics\nargue that DDR programs are too often narrowly conceived,\ninflexible, technocratic, bureaucratic, and detached from the\npolitical transition or broader recovery and reconstruction strat-\negies (Muggah, 2009). As a result of concerns such as these,\npolicy planners seek more evidence that DDR programs are\neffective at ending protracted conflict and establishing peace in\nthe long term. More importantly, policy makers seek informa-\ntion about what aspects of DDR, either alone or acting in con-\ncert with other program and non-program factors, account for\nDDR outcomes. This study is one response to that quest.\nThe results of the study are consistent with widespread\nviews about the status of the Niger Delta violence and schol-\narly views about the NDAP. Without doubt, the NDAP within\nrelatively short time affected the violence in many positive\nways and its achievements have continued to be asserted by\nformer and present managers of the program and by academ-\nics (Ajibola, 2015). But, if it is considered that as much as\n60.7% of this study's respondents believe that the NDAP will\nbe unable to entrench long-standing peace, 90.6% are unem-\nployed, and 82.6% believe that the current unemployment\nsituation in the delta is worse than before the NDAP was\ninstituted, then, program managers and the government must\nexercise caution in touting the success of the NDAP.\nMoreover, 99% of this study's respondents admitted that\ntheir organizations only submitted a fraction of their arms,\nwhich means that the militias continue to maintain the ability\nto engage in armed violence despite participating in the\nNDAP and receiving all of the benefits of participation,\nincluding monthly reintegration stipends and huge oil pipe-\nline security contracts from the state. If this is analyzed in\nrelation to the fact that the NDAP deliberately routes the pay-\nment of reintegration allowances or stipends through the\ndemobilization aspects of the program defective from the\nstart, then, the weakness of the NDAP in terms of its ability\nto entrench long-term peace should become glaring.\nThe result of the logistic regression is consistent with the\nabove but goes a step further to illuminate certain aspects of\nthe NDAP, especially revealing the type of combatants that\nare more likely to disarm, demobilize, and reintegrate than\nothers. It also shows the type of ex-combatants that are more\nor less likely to view the NDAP as potentially a long-term\nsuccess and capable of transforming ex-combatants from\npurveyors of violence to individuals vested in peace settle-\nments and peace processes. Perhaps, this is the main contri-\nbution of this research, which will enable scholars, policy\nmakers, program managers, and DDR intervention analysts\nto target intervention to particular vulnerable groups. The\nresults particularly suggests that DDR participants should\nnot be considered as symmetric but asymmetric, in which\ncase certain individuals, cohorts, or groups may have more\ncapacity than others to internalize DDR processes and have\ntheir behavior modified accordingly.\nMore specifically, the results for disarmament or the likeli-\nhood that participants will acquire more weapons in future to\npursue their objectives show strongly that married ex-combat-\nants as well as ex-combatants who had more than 5 years'\nexperience in militancy are more likely to disarm than others.\nThis is not surprising; many ex-combatants have detailed the\nvery treacherous conditions under which combatants lived in\nthe swamps of the Niger Delta during the peak stages of the\nviolence (Okonofua, 2013). The mean conditions of the camps\nand the uncertainties involved in their violent campaigns\nagainst a brutal Nigerian Army must exert a huge toll on com-\nbatants and their families. The tolls are heavier, however, for\nmarried combatants who are alienated from their wives (or hus-\nbands) and children. Thus, this category of former fighters is\nmore likely to seize opportunities for peaceful settlements and\nto not desire to rearm in pursuit of some future objectives. It is\nalso not surprising that the people who are more likely to rearm\nthemselves are ex-combatants who enjoyed better conditions\nas militants than they are getting from the NDAP. For instance,\nafter John Togo, the leader of the Niger Delta Liberation Front\n(NDLF) entered the NDAP, he discovered that he was better off\n(economically) as a fighter than as an ex-combatant. Because\nhe lacked direct contact with the leadership of the political\nstate, he was deprioritized from the intricate patronage coali-\ntion that had been formed to strengthen relations between cer-\ntain influential ex-combatants and top Nigerian officials. He\npromptly left the program, rearmed his group, and began to\nengage security forces in hostilities. This is consistent with the\nliterature where ex-combatants have rearmed themselves and\nbroken the terms of peace accords due to their desire for mate-\nThe observed disarmament pattern is similar to the\nobserved pattern for demobilization. The study finds that\nmarried ex-combatants and combatants who had spent more\nthan 5 years in militias are more likely to disarm than unmar-\nried ex-combatants and ex-combatants who joined militias\nless than 5 years before entering the NDAP. Also, ex-combat-\nants who feel that conditions within their militias (where they\nhad considerable opportunities to make huge sums of money\nthrough kidnapping for ransom, crude oil theft, and other\ncriminal enterprises) were better than the post-NDAP condi-\ntions as well as female ex-combatants are less likely to demo-\nbilize and reintegrate into civilian society than others.As with\nJohn Togo, many ex-combatants, particularly those in the\nsmaller organizations, were deprioritized in the patron\u00adclient\nsystem of the NDAP. The NDAP privileged relations with the\nmore influential insurgents such as Mujahid Asari-Dokubo,\nAteke Tom, and Government Ekpemupolo (Tom Polo) over\nrelations with some less influential militia commanders. The\nmore influential militia commanders became beneficiaries of\nhuge security contracts and made more money from engaging\nthe peace than from continuing to fight. Thus, unless ex-com-\nbatants are able to replace the war incomes that they lose from\nembracing peace, they are more likely to maintain their for-\nmer command structures and to resume fighting at the slight-\nest provocation. Moreover, because the NDAP did not\nexplicitly seek to delink or disconnect former fighters from\ntheir erstwhile groups as scholars recommend (Berdala, 1996;\ngroups, it unwittingly created conditions unfavorable to the\neffective demobilization of ex-combatants.\nEven more worrisome than the above is the fact that the\nNDAP, from the very beginning, appeared to deprioritize\nwomen in the scheme of things. In the first phase, the NDAP\nbatants who entered the program. The small number of\nwomen admitted into the program is certainly not reflective\nof the rate of participation of women in militancy in the\nregion or of women's involvement in civil wars generally\nthe Sandinista army in Nicaragua and between 25% and 30%\nof the guerillas in El Salvador were women. Thus, the find-\ning that female ex-combatants are less likely to demobilize\nand reintegrate into Niger Delta communities may be\nsuggestive of the fact that the NDAP deprioritizes women\nwho are also likely to receive less reintegration support than\nmales. There are several likely reasons for this. First, female\ncombatants are not considered to pose the same level of\nthreats as male combatants. As a result, men have always\nbeen given priority in terms of reintegration assistance\nfemale combatants in the Niger Delta live in masculinized\nsocieties with gendered institutions and symbolic systems.\nAs a result, female ex-combatants are often alienated for\nbreaching \"societal norms,\" which do not glorify women\nwarriors. Because of this, many female ex-combatants are\nreluctant to disclose their status and fail to reintegrate through\nDDR. Instead, they often reintegrate into prostitution and\ndrug addiction, or reemerge as mercenaries in another con-\nflict (Bernard et al., 2003). Third, female ex-combatants may\nbe constrained by gender-specific obstacles in the post-con-\nflict period because they tend to have less access to knowl-\nedge, skills, information, resources, work opportunities, and\nsupport structures than males (Nillson, 2005). Because of\nthese gender-specific discriminations, female ex-combatants\noften feel empowered by war and may not want to return to\ntheir traditional roles, which in most instances affirms men's\ngender power over women. Yet, the failure to accommodate\nwomen in DDR programs and to effectively demobilize and\nreintegrate them into society may create unanticipated con-\nsequences as was the case in Eritrea where the divorce rate\nChad, Namibia, and Nicaragua where domestic violence rate\ninvolving female ex-combatants spiked significantly.\nFor economic reintegration, the study finds that married\nex-combatants are more likely to gain employment than\nunmarried ex-combatants. Perhaps this is so because they\nbenefit from scale, which in this case means that married for-\nmer fighters are likely to have much larger social networks\n(when their spouses' networks are factored) for getting a job.\nThis expanded network may open doors that unmarried ex-\ncombatants are unable to access and with such economic\naccess, married ex-combatants are less likely to want to\nreturn to insurgency. The reintegration challenges of Niger\nDelta ex-combatants are not novel in themselves. Azam et al.\n(1994) showed that reintegration programs are often heavily\npoliticized leading to the marginalization of groups crucial to\nthe peace process. For example, the failure to accommodate\nthe interests of RENAMO dissidents in Mozambique spurred\nanother round of fighting even after the peace agreement had\nbeen signed (Nillson, 2005). Not only has this program\ndefect prevented the proper absorption of potential spoilers\ninto the program but has also given ex-combatants the oppor-\ntunity to reorganize latent command structures as happened\nhave argued, even where ex-combatants did not intentionally\nset out to reorganize latent command structures, the fact that\nprogram managers and influential politicians were deliber-\nately creating bottlenecks for would-be repentant combatants\nwas an incentive to reorganize and reactivate violence.\nIn terms of ex-combatants' overall assessment of the\nNDAP, the results also show some interesting dynamics.\nFor instance, ex-combatants who identified as ethnic Ijaw\nare more likely to hold favorable views of the NDAP, spe-\ncifically believing that the NDAP will succeed in establish-\ning long-term peace in the delta, although they are less\nlikely to be transformed by the NDAP than members of\nother ethnicities. This finding suggests that Ijaw former\nfighters, because they share ethnicity with ex-President\nGoodluck Jonathan, have been the main beneficiaries of the\nNDAP. The top managers of the program, from Timi Alaibe\n(the pioneer coordinator of the program) to Kingsley Kuku\n(the immediate past program coordinator) are mainly Ijaw\nwho are also the dominant ethnic group in the region and in\nthe NDAP. Thus, they are more likely to view the program\nas a success. However, because Ijaw communities continue\nto experience the negative effects of oil production, includ-\ning poverty and unemployment disproportionate to their\nrole in generating much of the nation's wealth, Ijaw former\nfighters are less likely to be transformed by the NDAP.\nThus, if the program is discontinued, Ijaw former fighters\nare more likely than other groups to revert to violence to\npursue their goals.\nFinally, like the first set of variables tested, marital status,\ntime invested in militias, and ex-combatants perception of their\nsituation outside of their militias compared with situations\nwithin their militias are important factors to consider in assess-\ning the overall performance of the NDAP. In context, this would\nsuggest as, indeed, Lederach (1997) has urged that a more holis-\ntic approach that accounts for conditions in the community (i.e.,\npoverty, pollution, disenfranchisement, etc.) must be adopted to\ngain any credible, long-term benefit from the NDAP.\nConclusion\nThe NDAP was instituted at a time of great social, political,\nand economic ferment and trepidation. Since its inception, the\nprogram has had measured impact on the violence, helping to\nbring about the fragile peace existing in the region today. The\npeace is fragile because while the NDAP drastically reduced\nthe onshore violence in the delta, the violence shifted to the\noffshore where oil assets are daily being sabotaged by former\nfighters and fighters who refused to enter the program includ-\ning new parties that entered the violence after the adoption of\nthe NDAP, particularly after the 2015 presidential election.\nThis study validates the little success achieved by the NDAP\nbut shows that the potential for violence to return is high. If\nviolence returns, many former fighters who are presently par-\nticipating in the NDAP will get involved, especially the more\ninexperienced former fighters, women, unemployed former\nfighters, and those who benefitted more from waging than\nengaging the NDAP-induced peace.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAjibola, I.
