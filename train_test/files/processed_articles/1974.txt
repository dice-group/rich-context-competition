Sedentary time during waking hours was measured by an accelerometer\n(,100 counts per minute). A sedentary bout was defined as a period of time .5 min. A sedentary\nbreak was defined as an interruption in sedentary time ($100 counts per minute). Metabolic\nsyndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria.\nRESULTS--On average, people spent 9.5 h (65% of wear time) as sedentary. Compared with\npeople without metabolic syndrome, people with metabolic syndrome spent a greater percentage\nhad lower intensity during sedentary time (14.8 vs. 15.8 average counts per minute), and had\nfewer sedentary breaks (82.3 vs. 86.7), adjusted for age and sex (all P , 0.01). A higher per-\ncentage of time sedentary and fewer sedentary breaks were associated with a significantly greater\nlikelihood of metabolic syndrome after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, alcohol\nconsumption, smoking, BMI, diabetes, heart disease, and physical activity. The association between\nintensity during sedentary time and metabolic syndrome was borderline significant.\nCONCLUSIONS--The proportion of sedentary time was strongly related to metabolic risk,\nindependent of physical activity. Current results suggest older people may benefit from reducing\ntotal sedentary time and avoiding prolonged periods of sedentary time by increasing the number\nof breaks during sedentary time.\nMetabolic syndrome has been es-\ntablished as a public health con-\ncern in the U.S. Thirty-four\npercent of adults in the U.S. meet the\ncriteria for metabolic syndrome, with\nmen and women over 60 years of age\neven more likely to have metabolic syn-\ndrome (1). Metabolic syndrome is most\ncommonly defined according to the Na-\ntional Cholesterol Education Program's\nAdult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP) III\ncriteria as three or more of the following\nconditions: abdominal obesity, high tri-\nglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, hyper-\ntension, and hyperglycemia (2). People\nwith metabolic syndrome have an in-\ncreased risk to develop health problems\nsuch as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke\n(3\u00ad5). Because of its high prevalence and\nsignificant health consequences, it is im-\nportant to understand the risk factors of\nmetabolic syndrome.\nPhysical inactivity (6,7), often de-\nfined as the lack of moderate-to-vigorous\nphysical activity, and sedentary behavior\n(8,9) have been shown to be important\nrisk factors of metabolic syndrome. These\nstudies, however, are limited by the use of\nself-reported physical activity data. Previ-\nous studies with objective physical activ-\nity data by accelerometry have shown that\nphysical inactivity is associated with met-\nabolic risk factors in adults (10). However\nmost studies focused on risk associated\nwith lack of physical activity rather than\nsedentary time. Sedentary behavior is de-\nfined as engaging in activities at the rest-\ning level of energy expenditure and\nincludes activities such as sleeping, sit-\nting, lying down, playing on the com-\nputer, and watching television (11).\nSince sedentary behavior is not defined\nas the lack of moderate-to-vigorous phys-\nical activity, it is important to study it sep-\narately from light, moderate, or vigorous\nactivity. Further, sedentary behavior is in-\ndependently associated with health out-\nFew studies have used accelerometry\nto examine the role of sedentary activities\non metabolic risk (13,14). These studies\nhave shown that an increase in the dura-\ntion and percentage of time spent in sed-\nentary behavior are associated with an\nincrease in metabolic risk in adults\n(13,14), while an increase in breaks taken\nfrom sedentary behavior is associated\nwith a decrease in metabolic risk (13). It\nseems, therefore, that in addition to total\ntime spent in sedentary behavior, the pro-\nportion and distribution of sedentary\ntime within the day are independently\nassociated with health outcomes. To our\nknowledge, there are no studies specifi-\ncally among older adults that examined\nthe association between objectively mea-\nsured sedentary activity and metabolic\nsyndrome. This is a particularly impor-\ntant research question as the prevalence\nof metabolic alterations is higher in older\npersons (1), and the amount of sedentary\ntime increases with age; people aged 60\nyears and older spend more than 8 h per\nday in sedentary behaviors (15).\nThe aim of this study was to examine\nthe associations of specific sedentary activ-\nity parameters with metabolic syndrome\nc c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c\nFrom the 1Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography, and Biometry, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda,\nMaryland; the 2Global and Community Health Department, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia; the\n3Cancer Prevention Fellowship Program, Office of Preventive Oncology, National Cancer Institute,\nBethesda, Maryland; the 4National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Metabolic\nResearch Core, Bethesda, Maryland; the 5National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland; and the 6School for\nPublic Health and Primary Care, Department of Internal Medicine, Maastricht University Medical Centre,\nMaastricht, the Netherlands.\nCorresponding author: Annemarie Koster, kostera@mail.nih.gov.\nC a r d i o v a s c u l a r a n d M e t a b o l i c R i s k\nusing nationally representative National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) data (16) of adults 60 years of\nage and older living in the U.S.\nMETHODS--This study used cross-\nsectional data from participants of the\nstudy conducted in the U.S. NHANES\nprovides a nationally representative sam-\nple with a stratified, multistage design.\nThe three main aspects to the survey are\nan interview given by a trained in-\nterviewer in the participants' home, a\nmedical exam completed at a mobile ex-\namination center, and laboratory tests.\nThe National Center for Health Statistics\nEthics Review Board approved the survey\nprotocols, and informed consent was ob-\ntained for all subjects.\nyears and older who participated in the\naccelerometer study in NHANES. The\nday of accelerometry data, which was\ndefined as 10 or more hours of wear\ntime (17). For the current study, we in-\ncluded participants 60 years of age and\nmore valid days of accelerometer wear\ntime (n = 2,401). Only participants sched-\nuled for a morning blood draw had\ntriglyceride and plasma glucose data be-\ncause these samples were obtained after\nan overnight fast, bringing the final sam-\nwomen).\nMeasures\nAccelerometry. Activity was assessed\nometer (ActiGraph, Fort Walton Beach,\nFL). The monitor was attached to a belt\nthat strapped around the waist. Each par-\nticipant was instructed to wear the acceler-\nometer over their right hip. Participants\nwere instructed to wear the monitor for\nseven consecutive days and to remove the\nmonitor before going to bed and during\nshowers, bathing, swimming, or other\nwater activities. The monitors were re-\nturned by mail to the NHANES contractor\nwhere the data were downloaded, and the\nmonitors were checked for calibration.\nThe uniaxial ActiGraph measures and\nrecords vertical acceleration as \"counts\"\nper minute, an arbitrary intensity indica-\ntor of the movements of each minute.\nNonwear time was defined as intervals\nof at least 60 consecutive minutes of\n0 counts with allowance for up to 2 min\nof counts between 0 and 100. Active min-\nutes were defined as $100 counts per\nminute and sedentary minutes as counts\nbout was defined as a period of time .5\nmin when count values fell into the\nsedentary range with only 1 allowable\nminute outside the sedentary range. A\nsedentary break was defined as an inter-\nruption in sedentary time when the count\nvalue exceeded 99 per minute. To identify\nspecific sedentary activity parameters,\nfive variables of interest were included\nin this study: 1) duration of valid seden-\ntary time (hours); 2) proportion of total\nvalid wear time that was sedentary time;\n3) average duration of a sedentary bout;\n4) average intensity during sedentary\ntime, which is used as a quantitative in-\ndicator of stillness during sedentary time\nand is defined by the average count value\nduring sedentary time; and 5) number of\nbreaks in sedentary time. These five sed-\nentary variables were averaged for one day\nand used as continuous variables. Sex-\nspecific quartiles were also created for\neach variable.\nMetabolic syndrome. Metabolic syn-\ndrome was defined according to the ATP\nIII guidelines as meeting three or more of\nthe following criteria: 1) waist circumfer-\nwomen; 2) serum triglyceride level of\nfor women; 4) fasting glucose level\n$100 mg/dL or use of antidiabetic med-\nications (insulin or oral agents); or 5) sys-\ntolic blood pressure $85 mmHg and/or\ndiastolic blood pressure $130 mmHg, or\nuse of antihypertensive medications (2).\nUp to four blood pressure reading were\ntaken on participants. To determine\nblood pressure status, the last two blood\npressure readings were averaged for par-\nticipants that had three or four measure-\nments. If participants only had two blood\npressure readings, the last reading was\nused in the analysis. If participants had\nonly one blood pressure reading, that\nreading was used in the analysis. Mea-\nsurements with a systolic reading of zero\nwere considered missing. According to\nthe guidelines, medications for elevated\ntriglycerides and reduced HDL choles-\nterol (fibrates and nicotinic acid) should\nbe taken into account (2). This specific\ninformation, however, was not available\nin NHANES. People with one or two\nmissing metabolic syndrome criteria\nwho had three positive metabolic syn-\ndrome criteria were grouped in the\nmetabolic syndrome group. Similarly,\npeople with one or two missing metabolic\nsyndrome criteria who had three negative\nmetabolic syndrome criteria were grouped\nin the nonmetabolic syndrome group.\nCovariates. Covariates included age, sex,\nself-reported race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nwhite, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,\nother), education (less than high school,\nhigh school or general equivalency di-\nploma, more than high school), alcohol\nconsumption (never, former, current\ndrinker, missing), smoking (never, for-\nmer, current), BMI (kg/m2), self-reported\ndiabetes and heart disease, and physical\nactivity (moderate-to-vigorous physical\nactivity [minutes .2,020 counts] and av-\nerage accelerometer count during active\nminutes).\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using SAS 9.2 Software\n(SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Sudaan 10.0\n(RTI International, Research Triangle Park,\nNC) to account for the complex survey\ndesign and incorporate the sample\nweights. Sample weights were recalculated\nfrom the NHANES mobile examination\ncenter weights to reflect the \"nonresponse\"\nrelated to not having complete accelerom-\neter data. Reweighting was conducted\nand 80+ years), race/ethnicity (non-\nHispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,\nand Mexican Americans), and gender\nstrata. Resulting sample weights were\nused for all analyses. The t tests for con-\ntinuous variables and x2 tests for categor-\nical variables were used to examine the\ndifferences in characteristics between\npeople with and without metabolic syn-\ndrome. Analysis of variance was con-\nducted to examine the association between\nsedentary variables and the metabolic\nsyndrome components. Adjusted means\nand standard errors adjusted for sex and\nage are presented. Logistic regression anal-\nyses were performed to examine the asso-\nciations between the sedentary variables\n(in quartiles) and metabolic syndrome.\nFour models were fitted; model 1 adjusted\nfor sex and age. Model 2 was additionally\nadjusted for education, race/ethnicity, al-\ncohol consumption, smoking status, and\nBMI. Model 3 additionally adjusted for\ndiabetes, heart disease, and physical\nactivity by the average counts during ac-\ntive time was added to model 4. Interac-\ntions between sex, age, race/ethnicity,\nand all sedentary variables were tested\nbut were found to be nonsignificant at\nSedentary activity and metabolic syndrome\nparticipants met the criteria for having\nmetabolic syndrome. As shown in Table 1,\nparticipants with metabolic syndrome were\nmore often women (P , 0.01), had a lower\neducational level (P , 0.01), were more\noften nondrinkers (P , 0.01), had a higher\nBMI (P , 0.001), had a higher prevalence\nof diabetes and heart disease, spent less\ntime in the moderate-to-vigorous activity\nrange, and had a lower average accelerom-\netry count during active minutes in the\nof wear time) as sedentary. The correla-\ntion between total sedentary time and\npercent sedentary time was high (corre-\nlation coefficient 0.75); the correlation\nbetween total sedentary time with average\nlength of a sedentary bout, intensity\nduring sedentary time, and number of\nsedentary breaks was lower (correlation\nspectively). Table 2 shows the age- and\nsex-adjusted means of the five sedentary\nvariables according to each metabolic\nsyndrome component and metabolic syn-\ndrome. Participants with a large waist cir-\ncumference, low HDL cholesterol, high\ntriglycerides, and metabolic syndrome\nhad a higher percentage of sedentary\ntime out of total wear time, a longer aver-\nage sedentary bout, a lower average in-\ntensity during sedentary time (not\nstatistically significant for HDL), and\nfewer breaks in sedentary time (all P ,\n0.05) after adjusting for age and sex.\nFigure 1 shows the age- and sex-\nadjusted mean values of the five sedentary\nvariables according to the number of met-\nabolic syndrome criteria. A significant\npositive trend with the number of meta-\nbolic syndrome criteria was found for the\nduration and percentage of sedentary\ntime and the average length of a sedentary\nbout (all P , 0.01). The intensity during\nsedentary time and the number of breaks\nin sedentary time had a significant nega-\ntive trend with the number of metabolic\nsyndrome criteria (all P , 0.01).\nThe relationship between each sed-\nentary variable and metabolic syndrome\nis presented in Table 3. Model 1, adjusted\nfor age and sex, shows the greater likeli-\nhood of having metabolic syndrome in\nhighest quartiles of sedentary time dura-\ntion, percent sedentary time, and average\nlength of a sedentary bout. Further, com-\npared with the highest quartile, the lowest\nquartile of the intensity during sedentary\ntime and the number of sedentary breaks\nwas associated with an increased likeli-\nhood of metabolic syndrome. Model 2\nwas additionally adjusted for ethnicity, al-\ncohol consumption, smoking, and BMI,\nand model 3 was additionally adjusted\nfor diabetes and heart disease. In model\n3, a higher percentage of sedentary time\nout of total wear time (quartile 2: odds\nwere related to a significantly increased\nlikelihood of metabolic syndrome. Per-\ncentage sedentary time and sedentary\nbreaks remained statistically significant\nafter additional adjustment for physical\nactivity in model 4.

In addi-\ntional analysis we adjusted for minutes\nof moderate-to-vigorous physical activity\nin model 4 instead of average counts per\nminute during active time, which did not\nchange our results. Further, the relation\nbetween the intensity during sedentary\ntime and sedentary breaks with metabolic\nsyndrome did not change after adjust-\nment for total sedentary time (data not\nshown).\ndata, the relationship between objectively\nmeasured sedentary time and metabolic\nsyndrome was examined in a representa-\ntive sample of older adults living in the\nU.S. Compared with people without met-\nabolic syndrome, people with metabolic\nsyndrome spent more hours and a greater\npercentage of their wear time as seden-\ntary. Further, people with metabolic syn-\ndrome had a longer average sedentary\nbout, a lower intensity during sedentary\ntime, and fewer breaks in sedentary time. A\nhigher percentage of total wear time spent\nas sedentary time was associated with a\nsignificantly greater likelihood of metabolic\nsyndrome even after adjustment for phys-\nical activity. Additionally, fewer sedentary\nbreaks were associated with a higher likeli-\nhood of metabolic syndrome, and a signif-\nicant trend was found for intensity during\nsedentary time where the likelihood of\nmetabolic syndrome increased with a de-\ncrease in intensity.\nPrevious research with self-reported\ndata is consistent with the findings in this\nstudy on the association between time\nspent in sedentary behaviors and meta-\nbolic syndrome.

One previous study of\nadults (mean age 53.4 years) has been\nconducted on breaks in sedentary time\nand metabolic syndrome and corrobo-\nrates our findings that fewer breaks in\nsedentary time were significantly associ-\nated with a larger waist, higher triglycer-\nide levels, and higher 2-h glucose levels\n(13). The results of our study suggest that\nnot only is total sedentary time an impor-\ntant health risk factor, but patterns (i.e.,\nthe way sedentary time is accumulated) of\nsedentary behaviors might be important\nrisk factors as well.\nAn important strength of our study\nis that sedentary behavior was measured\nobjectively by accelerometry, but accel-\nerometers are not sensitive to detect\nall activities such as biking, standing,\nand upper-body movement. The cross-\nsectional design of this study limits\ninference about the direction of causal-\nity between the sedentary variables and\nmetabolic risk.
