    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe analyze whether Pakistan has become one domestically integrated rice market and whether Pakistan's rice markets are\nintegrated with the international markets, using monthly data from 1994 to 2011. During this period, major policy shifts took\na minimum export price policy was adopted. We compare the degree of integration before and after 2002. We find that\nmost of the regional rice markets in Pakistan are integrated domestically. Pakistan's rice markets are also integrated with\nthe international markets, using prices in Thailand and Vietnam as benchmarks. The price support policy abolition seems to\nhave contributed to greater domestic integration, while the subsequent export policies seem to have decreased the extent\nof Pakistan's integration with the international markets. However, although Pakistan's rice markets generally are domestically\nintegrated as well as integrated with the international market, price adjustments are quite slow. Thus, only 3% to 11% of\ndeviations from long-run equilibrium are adjusted on a monthly basis, indicating that a shock in international markets takes\nseveral months to be fully transferred to prices in Pakistan.\n",

Slow and imperfect\nprice transmissions leave producers and consumers to make\ndecisions based on prices that do not reflect their real social\ncosts and benefits, leading to slow economic growth (World\nBank, 2012b). An understanding of spatial market integration\nis important to formulate good economic policies (Dutoit,\nVarela,Aldaz-Carroll, & Iacovone, 2012). Spatial market inte-\ngration refers to both short-term comovements and long-run\nrelationships among prices. It is defined as the smooth trans-\nmission of price signals and information across geographically\nseparated markets (Goletti, Ahmed, & Farid, 1995). Market\nintegration can also be defined as a measure of the extent to\nwhich demand and supply in one location are transmitted to\nanother (Negassa, Meyers, & Maldhin, 2003). Price differ-\nences beyond what can be explained by transportation and\ntransaction costs indicate inefficient arbitrage and possibly the\nexistence of market power. If markets are not well integrated,\nthis often reflects the presence of infrastructural and institu-\ntional bottlenecks that interfere with the efficient flow of\ngoods and prices between markets (Goletti & Babu, 1994).\nInvestigating price transmission from the international to\nthe domestic market, and integration among domestic mar-\nkets within a country helps governments in formulating\neffective polices regarding investments in infrastructure and\ndecisions aimed at improved food security and reduced pov-\nerty. Regional and international price differences and spatial\nprice dynamics provide important information for public\nmarket regulation and intervention, as well as information to\nproducers and consumers when making decisions regarding\nresource allocation. Weak market integration may convey\nincorrect signals to both producers and consumers (Alexander\nRice is the basic staple food for about half of the world's\npopulation.

Paddy rice contributes\n1.3% to world production, and exports of milled rice account\nfor 10.9% of total world rice exports (United Nations, Food\nand Agriculture Organization [UNFAO], 2010). Two main\nvarieties of rice, International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)\nand Basmati, are produced. In this study, we use monthly\nprices in the major IRRI rice markets in Pakistan, whereas\nthe free on Board (FOB) price of Thai 5% broken rice (a\nclose substitute for IRRI rice) is used as an international\nbenchmark price1 to test the level of market integration\nbetween domestic and international markets. In addition to\nexport prices for Pakistan, export prices from Thailand and\nVietnam are used to analyze international market integration.\nBoth Thai and Vietnam rice prices have been major interna-\ntional benchmarks. Earlier studies such as Mushtaq, Abbas,\nAbedullah, and Ghafoor (2006) and Ghafoor and Aslam\n(2012) focused mainly on the market for Basmati rice in\nPunjab province. The present study uses the price of IRRI\nrice--a species with higher yields, production, and exports--\nto analyze the effects of the support price policy that was\na comparison of market integration before and after 2002.\nAn Overview of the Rice Sector in\nPakistan\nPakistan being a developing country with an agro-based\neconomy has 42% of its labor force working in agriculture,\nwhich accounts for 23% of its gross domestic product (GDP).\nRice production covers about 20% of the total cropped area\nfor food grain production in the country.2 It accounts for\nalmost 6% of the value added in agriculture and contributes\nPakistan is exported because of the relatively low annual per\nGoP, 2011). This also explains higher exports of IRRI rice\ncompared with Basmati rice, as consumption of Basmati rice\nis higher than that of IRRI rice. The marketing chain is com-\nposed of domestic producers, village dealers, commission\nagents, wholesalers, retailers, processors, and exporters\nbefore reaching domestic and international consumers.\nPunjab province is a major producer of Basmati rice,\nwhereas Sindh province is a major producer of IRRI rice.\nThere was no Basmati production in Sindh province until\n2008, and only a very small area was allocated subsequently.\nAlthough the area under total rice cultivation has varied by\ntons. The area under basmati rice cultivation varied between\n1.3 and 1.7 million hectares, while production of Basmati\nrice fluctuated between 1.2 and 3.1 million tons. The area\nunder cultivation and the production of IRRI rice ranged\n3.0 million tons, respectively. Despite the lower area under\nIRRI rice cultivation, its production remained higher than\nBasmati because of its high yield per hectare. The average\n4.18 million tons, with Basmati and non-Basmati (mainly\nmillion tons and 1.01 and 3.15 million tons, respectively. In\nthe latter period, exports of non-Basmati rice varieties were\ngreater than that of Basmati rice, which reflects the increas-\ning importance of IRRI rice for export. During the crisis\nsibly because of the minimum export price policy during this\nperiod. However; after the crisis period and the withdrawal\nof the policy, exports of both varieties increased, with a\nlarger increase seen for non-Basmati rice exports, indicating\na greater responsiveness of non-Basmati rice exports to\nincreased prices during the crisis period. As a result of the\nA wide range of government policies and regulations influ-\nencing the rice markets have been enacted in Pakistan.

Hyderabad is located close to Karachi, the provin-\ncial capital of Sindh and a port city. Sukhar is located in Sindh\nprovince close to Hyderabad and also to Multan, close to the\nborder between Sindh and Punjab provinces. Hyderabad and\nSukhar are located closer to the major production regions,\nwith populations of about 10.4 and 0.40 million, respectively.\nMultan is close to Sukhar and has a population of about 1.55\nmillion. Quetta and Peshawar are more remote from the pro-\nduction regions, with populations of about 0.84 and 1.3 mil-\nlion, respectively; however, Peshawar is situated close to the\nborder of Afghanistan, while Quetta is located close to the\nborders of Iran and Afghanistan. Both countries are among\nthe largest markets for rice exports from Pakistan. Rawalpindi\nhas about 1.83 million inhabitants and lies between Multan\nand Peshawar but is closer to Peshawar.\nThe monthly prices of rice in the international market are\nrepresented by Thai (FOB) 5% broken long grain white rice.\nJust like IRRI, this is a coarse grain, and the two are close\nsubstitutes. The Thai price and an average price of six domes-\ntic regions of Pakistan are plotted in Figure 1. Price fluctua-\ntions are evident, along with a declining price trend during\nincrease in price during the international food crisis in 2007-\n2008. Domestic prices are lower than international prices as\ntransportation costs are not included in domestic prices.\nQuality differences can be another reason as they are close\nbut not perfect substitutes. Low domestic prices represent an\nincentive and potential to export. However, our main con-\ncern is to study the comovement of prices in the domestic\nand international markets and to examine whether the\nchanges in the international markets are being transmitted to\nthe domestic markets.\nData and Method\nThe data for Thai 5% broken white rice in U.S. dollars for the\nBank pink sheet (World Bank, 2012a), while the data for\nprices of IRRI rice in Pakistan's domestic markets are taken\nfrom agricultural statistics of Pakistan (GoP, 2012). Domestic\nprices are converted to U.S. dollars using monthly exchange\nThailand\nPakistan\nFigure 1. Rice prices in the international and domestic markets of Pakistan (USD per ton).\n4 SAGE Open\nrates from Oanda (2012). Prices of IRRI rice and Thai 5%\nare taken to test the market integration between domestic and\ninternational markets as both are coarse varieties and are\nclose substitutes. The data for FOB prices of Pakistan,\nThailand and Vietnam 25% broken rice are taken from vari-\nous monthly issues of Rice Market Monitor published by the\ntaken to test the integration among the international markets\nas they are all coarse varieties with 25% broken contents and\nare close substitute.\nCointegration analysis is a standard approach in studies of\nmarket integration. Following the approach of many studies\nof spatial integration, we apply theAugmented Dickey\u00adFuller\n(ADF) and Phillips\u00adPerron (PP) unit-root tests to test the sta-\ntionary of the data. All the price series are found to be non-\nstationary in levels in log form and stationary in first\ndifferences, allowing for the testing of cointegration among\nthe price series. We apply the Johansen methodology\n(Johansen & Juselius, 1990) estimating the trace and maxi-\nmum eigenvalues to test for cointegration among the prices\nseries. The Engle and Granger (1987) two-step procedure\n(hereafter EG) is also used to test for cointegration. As men-\ntioned above, there was a fundamental change in Pakistan's\nagricultural and trade policy after 2002 when the support\npolicy was terminated and a minimum export price policy\nwas implemented in 2008. Such policy shifts may represent\nstructural breaks in the time series and as such, generate sub-\nstantial econometric challenges when conducting cointegra-\ntion analysis. Specifically, a structural break may affect the\npower of cointegration tests (see, for example, Campos,\nEricsson, & Hendry, 1996). A number of econometric\napproaches have been presented to handle structural breaks in\nthe times series (e.g., Franses, 2001; Johansen, Moscow, &\nNilesen, 2000). Instead of applying such rather complicated\nmethods, we have taken a more simplistic approach. Thus, to\nanalyze the effects of the support policy that was ended in\nsample is divided into two sub-periods, before and after 2002.\nThis approach enables us to study directly whether the policy\nchange had an effect on market integration.\nVector error correction models (VECMs) are estimated if\nthe series are cointegrated. The general form of the VECM is\nas follows:\n  \nt i t i\ni\nk\nt k t\nk\n= + + +\n-\n=\n-\n-\n \n\u00b5 \nwhere Pt denotes n \u00d7 1 vector of prices;  is a first differ-\nence operator, such that P P P\nt t t\n= - -1 , i with\ni k\n= -\n, ,\n as the short-run coefficient; \n \n\n\n= ' is a long-\nrun impact matrix summarizing all the long-run information\nin Pt process, in which \n and \n are n r\n\u00d7 matrices of full\ncolumn rank; the matrix \n contains cointegrating vectors\nand the matrix \n is the matrix of the adjustment coefficients\nto the long-run disequilibrium errors represented by the coin-\ntegrating relations; t represents an i.i.d error term; and \u00b5 is\nan intercept.\nPrevious Studies on Market Integration\nThere is a large body of literature on commodity market\nintegration, including a number of studies focusing on\nmarkets in developing countries. Silvapulle and Jayasuriya\n(1994) found integration among domestic rice markets in\nthe Philippines, while Dawson and Dey (2002) found\nhighly integrated rice markets in Bangladesh. Van Tilburg,\nKuiper, and Swinkels (2008) tested law of one price for\npotato markets in Bhutan using three auction prices. They\nSureshwaran, Selassie, and Nyankori (1997) found market\nintegration among all the selected markets of vegetables\nin Indonesia. Kaur, Arshad, and Tan (2010) found market\nintegration in the broiler sector in Malaysia although\nstructural rigidities were present. Nga (2009) found inte-\ngration among 9 out of 34 rice markets in Vietnam, while\nGhosh (2010) found integration of grain markets within\nand across different states in India. Acharya, Ramesh,\nBirthal, Kumar, and Negi (2012) found integration among\nmost domestic rice and wheat markets in India. Mushtaq\nand Dawson (2002) applied Johansen's test and the VECM\nmethodology to measure the acreage response of agricul-\ntural commodities in Pakistan. Asche, Gj\u00f8lberg, and\nGuttormsen (2012) used Johansen's test to test the central\nmarket hypothesis in the Sorghum markets of Tanzania.\nAcharya et al. (2012) applied cointegration and VECM\ntechniques to measure market integration in the rice and\nwheat markets of India. Silvapulle and Jayasuriya (1994)\nused Johansen's methodology to test the market integra-\ntion of rice in the domestic markets of the Philippines.\nMinot (2011) applied cointegration and error correction\ntechniques to investigate the effects of changes in the\nworld food markets on the staple foods of Sub-Saharan\nAfrica using the small-country assumption. Greb, Jamora,\nMengel, von Cramon-Taubadel, and W\u00fcrriehausen (2012)\nstudied colinks among domestic markets of agricultural\ncommodities in developing countries with those among\ninternational markets, using cointegration and error cor-\nrection techniques.\nAmong the studies on integration of domestic markets\nwith international markets, Conforti (2004) investigated\nprice transmission for a number of agricultural commodities\nfor 16 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America using\nautoregressive distributed lag models and cointegration tests.\nHe found relatively incomplete transmission in African mar-\nkets relative to that in Asian and Latin American markets.\nFor Pakistan, he used annual data for some of the major crops\nand animal products such as meat. He found a long-run rela-\ntionship between the domestic price and the world reference\nAhmad and Gj\u00f8lberg 5\nprice for wheat, rice, maize, and bovine meat; however, coin-\ntegration tests did not confirm the results for the latter. He\nalso found a long-run relationship between export prices of\nBasmati rice and domestic wholesale prices of IRRI rice.\nSanogo and Amadou (2010) found that prices of coarse rice\nin Nepal responded to shocks originating in India. Minot\n(2011) found long-run relationships with the world food\nprices for only 13 out of 62 domestic markets in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica. Rice prices are more closely related to international\nmarket prices than are maize prices. John (2013) found that\nThai rice export price shocks are transmitted into the domes-\ntic markets of Thailand, although the causality tests between\nexport and domestic prices were not clear possibly because\ndomestic pricing policies were in place.\nMarket integration studies were also conducted to ana-\nlyze the policy effects. Among others, Ghosh (2011) inves-\ntigated the effects of agricultural policy reforms on spatial\nmarket integration of food grain markets in India. He found\nthat policy reforms contributed to improvement of spatial\nmarket integration in the post-reform period as segmented\nor poorly integrated markets in the pre-reforms period\nwere strongly integrated in the post-reform period. Sekhar\n(2012) found market integration among those agricultural\nmarkets of India that did not face restrictions on interstate\nor interregional trade such as chick-peas and edible oils.\nHe added that rice markets were not integrated at the\nnational level because of restrictions on interstate trade.\nnot transmitted to the domestic markets of India because of\npolicy intervention by the Indian government (Acharya\namong the rice export prices in Vietnam and Thailand, and\nthat removal of export quotas did not have a significant\neffect on the relationship between prices in these two\ncountries. Dorosh and Rashid (2013) found that before the\ncrisis in 2007, domestic prices in Bangladesh were cointe-\ngrated with subsidized import parity prices; however, after\nmid-2007, prices in Bangladesh increased because of the\nrestrictive export policies of India, which is one of the big-\ngest import markets for Bangladesh. John (2013) con-\ncluded that Thailand's domestic price policies are not\ncreating large distorting effects on world rice markets.\nEconometric Results\nThe results for the ADF and PP unit-root tests are presented\nin Table 1. The hypothesis that the log prices contain a unit\nroot could not be rejected at the 5% level of significance,\nindicating that all the prices are non-stationary except the\nVietnam 25% price, which is stationary at the 5% level of\nsignificance according to ADF test, but non-stationary\naccording to the PP test. The ADF test statistic of -2.91 is\nvery close to the 5% critical value of -2.89. However, taking\nthe first differences of the logs of prices, the unit-root hypoth-\nesis is clearly rejected. These tests were also applied by\nincluding a trend term, but the stationarity results remain\nunchanged. So, all the prices series are I (1), permitting an\nanalysis of cointegration among the prices obtained in the\ndifferent markets.\nIn this study, pairwise market integration among\nPakistan's domestic markets is tested using the Johansen\nand EG methodologies. Lag selection was made using the\nAkaike information criterion (AIC), Schwarz Bayesian\ninformation criteria (SBIC), and/or Hannen\u00adQuim infor-\nmation criteria (HQIC) selection criteria for Johansen tests\nwhile four lags were selected for EG tests.

Moreover, marketing mar-\ngins are likely to be higher than in other markets as the\nabsence of cointegration can be exploited by traders. The\npossible absence of cointegration and inefficient flow of\ninformation between Hyderabad and Peshawar/Quetta may\nreflect the distance between these markets, situated in\nthree different provinces and having the greatest distance\namong the sample markets. The result may also reflect low\nlevels of trade and poor infrastructure. Government invest-\nment, particularly in infrastructure and transportation, in\nmarkets that are not integrated might help to integrate\nthese markets.\nThe results from our Johansen cointegration and EG tests\nare presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The results\nMarkets Null Alternative Trace 5% CV Maximum eigenvalues 5% CV\nAll International Rice\nResearch Institute\nrice markets\nMarkets Null Alternative Trace Maximum eigenvalues \nNote. CV = Critical Values\nAhmad and Gj\u00f8lberg 7\nindicate that a long-run cointegration relationship exists\nbetween the prices. The trace and maximum eigenvalue statis-\ntics are greater than their respective critical values, suggesting\nthat all six domestic markets are integrated with the interna-\ntional market and that there is one cointegrating vector in\neach pair of domestic markets and the international market.\nThe results also show that the average prices of rice in the\ndomestic markets of Pakistan and the price of Thai 5% bro-\nken rice are also cointegrated. The ADF results for the EG\ntests show that all domestic prices including their average are\nintegrated with the Thai 5% prices except for prices in\nHyderabad and Sukhar markets.\nThe trace and maximum eigenvalue statistics for Thai and\nViet 25% broken rice show that these export prices are inte-\ngrated, while the results of the EG test indicate that these mar-\nkets are not integrated. Both the Johansen and EG tests find that\nPak andViet 25% export prices are cointegrated, whereas results\nfor Pak and Thai 25% are mixed. According to the trace statis-\ntics, these markets are integrated, whereas the maximum eigen-\nvalue statistics and EG tests show that they are not integrated.\nAs described in \"An Overview of the Rice Sector in\nPakistan\" section of this article, there was a policy change in\nMoreover, after 2002, export subsidies were granted to rice\nminimum export price policy was adopted on account of the\nAfter 2002, the government's role was limited to the occa-\nsional and irregular announcement of an indicative support\nprice (Salam, 2009).

The ADF stationarity test results (Table 8) for\nthe EG test reveal that 10 market pairs were not integrated\nuntil 2002, whereas the number of non-integrated market pairs\ncointegration among the domestic markets increased after the\ntermination of the support price policy. However, before 2002,\nthis policy did not seem to influence the degree of cointegra-\ntion of Pakistan's domestic markets with the international\nmarket as almost all the markets were integrated with the\ninternational market. The results suggest a positive influence\nof the policy change on the functioning and degree of cointe-\ngration within the domestic markets, which supports the cessa-\ntion of the costly support price policy and government\nprocurement. Mushtaq and Dawson (2002) recommended\nending the support price policy for rice in Pakistan.\nBoth the Johansen and EG test results show that all the\ndomestic rice markets were integrated with the international\nmarket before 2002 except for Hyderabad, which was not inte-\ngrated according to Johansen's test but integrated according to\nthe EG test results. Using the average domestic price as a proxy\nfor Pakistan's rice market, we also find Pakistan to be integrated\nwith the international market before 2002. However, both tests\nshow that the degree of market integration with the international\nmarket decreased after 2002 as Sukhar and Multan were no lon-\nger integrated according to the Johansen test results (Table 9),\nwhereas all the markets were no longer integrated according to\nEG results (Table 10). Moreover, both of the test results show\nthat average domestic prices were not cointegrated with the\ninternational reference price after 2002. The export subsidy\nthe minimum export price policy in 2008 may have caused this\ndecrease in the degree of integration.\nAhmad and Gj\u00f8lberg 9\nThe pairwise VECM estimates using the maximum\nlikelihood method for those domestic markets found to be\ncointegrated are reported in Table 11. Lag selection was\nmade using the AIC, SBIC, and/or HQIC selection crite-\nria, which suggested the lag order of two. Langrangian\u00ad\nMultiplier (LM) test was applied to test autocorrelation\nbetween the VECM residuals. The results accept the\nhypothesis of no autocorrelation at 5% level of signifi-\ncance in most of the market pairs except Quetta\u00ad\nRawalpindi, Quetta\u00adSukhar, and Quetta\u00adPeshawar;\nhowever, autocorrelation does not exist at Lag 1. As the\nestimations for all other market pairs are conducted at\nLag Level 2, we did the same for these market pairs for\ngetting short-run elasticities and better comparisons.\nHowever, there is no change in the level of significance\nof the coefficients, while their magnitude varies a little.\nThe coefficients for the long-run relationships are statis-\ntically significant and negative at the 1% level of signifi-\ncance in all pairs. The long-run elasticity of price\ntransmission ranges from 0.89 to 1.0 indicating a high\ndegree of transmission of price changes from one market\nto the other in the long run. The Johansen test results for\ncointegration show that a long-run relationship exists\namong these markets. However, the degree and statistical\nsignificance of the coefficients on the speed of adjust-\nment vary across the pairs. For most of the pairs, the\ncoefficients on the speed of adjustment are statistically\nsignificant at the 1% or 5% level of significance, except\nfor Multan\u00adQuetta, which is significant only at the 10%\nlevel of significance. These coefficients have the expected\nsigns, indicating that prices converge. However, there are\ntwo exceptions, Rawalpindi\u00adQuetta and Peshawar\u00adQuetta,\nwhose coefficients are not statistically significant. In con-\ntrast, the coefficients of Quetta\u00adRawalpindi and Quetta\u00ad\nPeshawar are statistically significant, implying that prices\nin the Quetta markets adjust to correct any disequilibrium\nbetween these pairs. The values of the coefficients of\nshort-run adjustment are all small, varying from 0.02 to\n0.22. The pairs including Hyderabad have the lowest\nspeed of adjustment. The pairs including Rawalpindi, the\nneighboring city of Pakistan's capital Islamabad, move\nquickly toward equilibrium with a speed of adjustment\nfrom 11% to 22%, except for Rawalpindi\u00adQuetta, which\nhas an insignificant coefficient as described earlier. A\npossible reason is the large distance between the two\nmarkets, resulting in low volumes of trade. The actual\ndata on trade between these markets are not available;\nhowever, it can be approximated on the basis of the distance\nbetween the cities and from the location of the production\nregions. For instance, Quetta and Rawalpindi are both non/\nvery small producers and very far from each other, being\nsituated on two different sides of the producing regions and\nin two different provinces.\nIn general, the process of adjustment toward long-run\nequilibrium appears to be slow. The estimated correction\nparameters are in the range 0.03 to 0.22 across the different\nmarket pairs, implying that 3% to 22% of any divergence\nfrom long-run equilibrium is corrected monthly. Possible\nreasons for this slow adjustment are the low level of\ndomestic consumption, low volume of trade in distant mar-\nket pairs, poor infrastructure, and market power of traders.\nThe coefficients on the short-run elasticity of price trans-\nmission are statistically significant and have the expected\nsigns in many cases, suggesting that price changes in\nrecent months significantly affect current and future\nchanges in the prices among these market pairs. These\nresults are helpful for forming expectations of future prices\nand accordingly, decisions regarding storage and resource\nallocation. However, there are market pairs where the\nshort-run price transmission elasticity coefficients are not\nsignificant, suggesting that past changes in prices are not\ntransmitted in the short run, although there exist signifi-\ncant long-run equilibrium relationships. This might be due\nto the direction of causality, distance, and infrastructure\nbetween them resulting in weak market integration or a\nlow speed of adjustment.\nThe VECM's results for the Pakistan's domestic and\ninternational markets are reported in Table 12. Lag selec-\ntion was made using the AIC, SBIC, and/or HQIC selec-\ntion criteria, which suggested the lag order of two. LM\ntest was applied to test autocorrelation between the VECM\nresiduals. The results accept the hypothesis of no autocor-\nrelation at 5% level of significance. The coefficients on\nthe speed of adjustment in domestic as well as interna-\ntional markets are statistically significant at 1% or 5%\nTable 8.

This suggests\nthat both the prices adjust to deviations from the long-run\nequilibrium; however, coefficient values are very small\nadjustment is very slow. About 3% to 11% of deviation\nfrom the long-run equilibrium is adjusted every month.\nThe possible reasons can be the infrastructure deficien-\ncies, slow transportation, and trade rigidities. Our objec-\ntive in this article is to examine the price transmission\nfrom the international markets to the domestic markets of\nPakistan. Hence, interpretation of the results focuses on\nthe results of domestic market equations in the VECM.\nThe VECM estimates for each of the individual domestic\nmarkets paired with the international market show that the coef-\nficients of the speed of adjustment in all markets are statistically\nsignificant at the 1% level of significance, except for the\nHyderabad market, which is significant at the 5% level of sig-\nnificance. This coefficient is not significant for Peshawar. This\nimplies that prices in all individual markets except Peshawar\nmove toward a long-run equilibrium with the international\nmarket. The coefficient value in Rawalpindi, Multan, and\nQuetta markets is about 0.10. The values of these coefficients\nfor Sukhar and Hyderabad, the closest markets geographically,\nHyderabad market is quite low despite the fact that the\nHyderabad is not far away from Karachi from where it is easy\nto ship rice to the international markets. This reflects that\ndirect trade from Sukhar to Karachi is taking place. Sukhar is\nlocated relatively closer to the production areas, and it makes\na little difference to travel to Karachi or Hyderabad. The coef-\nficients on the long-run equilibrium in all the markets are sta-\ntistically significant at the 1% level of significance. The\ncoefficient values ranges from 0.68 to 0.98, showing that in\nthe long run, about 68% to 98% of changes in the international\nmarket are transmitted to the domestic markets of Pakistan.\nThe short-run elasticity of price transmission with\nrespect to own lagged differenced market price and lagged\ndifferenced international price presents a mixed picture.\nAll the short-run elasticity coefficients are statistically\nsignificant at the 1% or 5% level of significance except\nfor Sukhar and Quetta. In Sukhar, its own price short-run\ncoefficient is not significant, whereas in Quetta, short-run\ncoefficient with respect to world's price is not significant.\nThe Hyderabad market captures more of the effect of past\nchanges in its own price, 32%, compared with the interna-\ntional price. Only 3% of changes in the international market\nTable 9. Johansen's Test for Cointegration.\nMarkets Null Alternative\nTrace Maximum eigenvalues Trace Maximum eigenvalues\nNote.

The values for the Peshawar market are\n19% and 18% in 1 month, respectively. The coefficients\non the short-run elasticities with respect to the interna-\ntional price in the Quetta market are not significant,\nwhereas with respect to its own market, it is significant.\nThis shows a low responsiveness of the Quetta market to\nthe international market, although it is integrated with the\ninternational market, and its long-run coefficient is statis-\ntically significant. Low responsiveness may be due to its\ngeographical location, which is far from most of the other\nmajor markets, small size of the market, and poor law and\norder condition. Greb et al. (2012) found that rice market\npairs are less cointegrated than maize markets. They also\nfound that domestic prices adjust to international prices\nfor most agricultural commodities except rice. Contrary to\nGreb et al. (2012), we find that Pakistan's domestic prices\nfor rice adjust to the international market; however, the\nlevel of the adjustment is low.\nThe above results can be helpful in decision making\nregarding allocation of resources by producers and inven-\ntory holders as well as consumers. Producers and traders\ncan form forecasts of future price changes based on changes\nin prices in the current and recent past period, and can\nmake their production and storage decisions accordingly.\nProducers can allocate more resources to increase produc-\ntion if they expect increases in prices, and vice versa, based\non the long-run price adjustment coefficient. Inventory\nholders can form expectations based on the short-run coef-\nficients. They will store if they expect prices to increase in\nthe coming months, and vice versa. These production and\nstorage decisions can affect food security.\nSummary and Conclusion\nIn this study, we have reported econometric results on whether\nPakistan's rice markets are integrated domestically and with\ninternational markets, focusing on cointegration and the speed\nof price adjustments. We investigate the effects of the change\nin policy that took place in 2002; when Pakistan terminated its\nsupport price policy and subsequently introduced export poli-\ncies, export subsidy, and minimum export price policy.\nThe results from the EG and Johansen tests strongly\nindicate that all the domestic markets are integrated, pos-\nsibly excepting Hyderabad\u00adPeshawar, Hyderabad\u00ad\nRawalpindi, Hyderabad\u00adMultan, and Hyderabad\u00adQuetta.\nThe VECM estimates of the domestic markets reveal that\nAhmad and Gj\u00f8lberg 13\nprices converge in the long run; however, the speed of\nadjustment toward long-run equilibrium is generally low.\nvarious pairs of markets, indicating that about 2% to 22%\nof the divergence from the long-run equilibrium is being\ncorrected monthly. The long-run coefficient varies from\nchanges are transmitted across different pairs of the mar-\nkets in the long run. The ending of the support price policy\nseems to have resulted in an improvement in the integra-\ntion of domestic markets as the number of non-integrated\nAll the domestic markets in Pakistan appear to be integrated\nwith the international market possibly excepting Hyderabad\nand Sukhar, although the speed of adjustment is rather slow.\nThe estimated coefficients of adjustments indicate that the\ndomestic markets tend to converge with the international mar-\nket in the long run, and about 3% to 11% of the divergence\nfrom long-run equilibrium due to shocks in the international\nmarket is corrected within a month. Slow adjustment may be\ndue to the existence of infrastructure deficiencies, slow\ntransportation, and trade rigidities. Government should\ninvest on infrastructure to improve the extend of market inte-\ngration and speed up the process of adjustment toward long-\nrun equilibrium particularly in the province of Sindh, which is\nthe main production region and possesses low quality of infra-\nstructure with greater room for infrastructure development.\nGovernment should act as watch dog and keep an eye on the\nmarketing system particularly on the role of market intermedi-\naries to avoid any malpractices that can affect the smooth func-\ntioning and integration of markets, which can convey the\nwrong signals to producers and can result in inefficient alloca-\ntion of resources. The long-run elasticity of price transmission\nto 98% of changes in the international price are transmitted to\ndomestic prices in the long run. Among the export markets for\nrice, Pakistan's rice markets seem to be integrated with the\nmarkets of Thailand and Vietnam.\nThe cointegration and VECM results suggest that while\ndomestic markets are integrated with, and responsive to,\nchanges in the international market and domestic markets,\nresponsiveness to own (local) shocks is higher although\nexceptions exist. Producers and traders can form expecta-\ntions of future changes in prices based on changes in\nprices in the current and last period, and can make their\nproduction and storage decisions accordingly.\nSupport price policy reforms have improved market\nintegration within Pakistan; however, they do not seem to\nhave affected the integration of Pakistan with the interna-\ntional market, while export policies have reduced the extent\nof market integration of Pakistan with the international\nmarket. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that reduc-\ning government intervention in price determination would\nincrease international market integration further.\nAppendix\nMap of Pakistan showing provinces and their capitals and selected\nmarkets in this study.\n"
