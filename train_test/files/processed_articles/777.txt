This study examines the relationship between the lack of private supplemental health insurance cover-\nage and the development of disability among adults aged 65 and older.\nMethods. Data are from the baseline and six follow-up waves of the Duke Established Populations for Epidemio-\nlogic Studies of the Elderly survey (N = 4,000). Discrete-time hazard models were used to estimate the impact of insur-\nance coverage and other risk factors on the incidence of disability among those unimpaired at baseline.\nResults. Controlling for education, income, and other potential confounders, the odds of developing disability were\n35-49% higher among those without private coverage. Insurance coverage also statistically explained part of the in-\ncreased risk of disability among low-income persons.\nDiscussion. The results indicate that changes in health insurance coverage as well as in individual behaviors may be\nneeded to reduce disability generally and disability among the socioeconomically disadvantaged, in particular.\n'T'HIS article examines the lack of supplemental health\nA insurance as a risk factor for disability among older\nAmericans covered by Medicare. As insurance coverage is\na risk factor amenable to intervention, research into its im-\npact on illness and disability has important implications for\npolicies and programs designed to improve the nation's\nhealth. Despite this, health insurance coverage has received\nconsiderably less attention than other risk factors in studies\nof disability among elderly persons. In reviewing prior re-\nsearch, we found numerous studies where demographic\ncharacteristics, health behaviors (smoking, drinking, obe-\nsity), and/or acute and chronic stress were included as risk\nfactors for disability. Insurance coverage was a risk factor\nin only one study (Wolinsky, Stump, Callahan, & Johnson,\n1996), and there it was a proxy for socioeconomic status.\nIn part, the lack of attention given to insurance coverage\nreflects the belief that Medicare has minimized differences\nin access to care among adults aged 65 and older (House\nler, Boyce, Chesney, Folkman, & Syme, 1993; Bunker &\nportance of insurance coverage generally as a risk factor\nfor health status. The evidence they cite is mostly indirect\nrather than based on studies where insurance coverage is\nincluded as a risk factor for health outcomes. Findings that\nthe relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and\nhealth is linear (with each higher level of SES associated\nwith improved health) are taken as indicating that inade-\nquate access to health care is not an important risk factor. A\nnonlinear pattern, with the economically disadvanged who\ncannot afford insurance coverage at increased risk, is con-\nsidered more consistent with insurance effects. Findings\nfrom the Black report (Department of Health and Social\nSecurity, 1980) showing that socioeconomic inequalities in\nhealth have persisted in Great Britain, even after the Na-\ntional Health Service was established in 1948, are also\ncited to argue that universal coverage would not have a sig-\nnificant impact on these inequalities.\nNot all reviewers agree with this assessment of the evi-\ndence. Williams and Collins (1995) point out that some\nU.S. studies find a nonlinear relationship between SES and\nhealth, with health gains diminishing as income increases,\nand that medical care may have a greater impact on health\namong disadvantaged groups who are already at increased\nrisk (Williams, 1990). They conclude that although more\nthan increased access is needed to improve the health of the\neconomically disadvantaged, access remains a crucial fac-\ntor. There is also considerable evidence that Medicare has\nnot equalized access to health care among older persons.\nAmong Medicare recipients, low-income enrollees receive\nless care (Friedman, 1991), are in poorer health when they\nreceive care (Feinstein, 1993), and receive poorer quality\nThere is reason to believe that differences in insurance\ncoverage may account, at least in part, for the continued\nimpact of income on health among older persons. Out-of-\npocket expenses associated with the use of Medicare-reim-\nbursed services can be substantial (Blustein, 1995; Morrow,\n1996). For the very poor, these expenses are covered by\nMedicaid. Some others have supplemental employer-spon-\nsored or individually purchased (\"Medigap\") policies. Typi-\ncally, these policies cover copayments, deductibles, and\nother expenses associated with the use of Medicare-reim-\nbursed services, as well as some services (e.g., prescription\ndrugs and some types of home care) not covered by Medi-\ncare. Compared to those with supplemental insurance,\nMedicare enrollees without private insurance are less likely\nto receive preventive care (Blustein, 1995). They are also\nless likely to have at least one physician visit per year\n(Mentnech, Ross, Park, & Brenner, 1995) and are more\nlikely to wait longer when they do visit a doctor's office\n(Hogan, Eppig, & Waldo, 1995). Such differences in the\nquantity and quality of care may put older adults without\nprivate insurance at increased risk of health problems, in-\ncluding disability.\nWe used a community sample to examine the impact of\nprivate health insurance coverage on disability, controlling\nfor demographic characteristics, baseline health, and a vari-\nety of other risk factors (health behaviors and measures of\nstress) that may be related to both insurance coverage and\ndisability. Using hierarchical regression techniques (Alwin\n& Hauser, 1981), we also estimate the degree to which in-\nsurance coverage mediates the relationship between income\nand disability. Six annual waves of follow-up data enable\nus to use proportional hazards models to estimate the ef-\nfects of our independent variables over a longer period of\ntime than has been possible in most prior studies of disabil-\nity among older people.\nMETHODS\nSample\nfollow-up waves of the Duke Established Populations for\nEpidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE), which were\ncarried out in one urban and four rural counties of North\nCarolina (Comoni-Huntley, Blazer, Brock, & Farmer, 1990).\nOf a stratified random household sample of community resi-\nAfrican Americans. Data from the first, fourth, and seventh\nwaves were collected using personal interviews, while tele-\nphone interviews were used for Waves 2, 3, 5, and 6. Details\nof the sampling design and methods are published elsewhere\n(Blazer, Burchett, Service, & George, 1991). In the analy-\nses, sampling weights were used to adjust for the oversam-\nple, differential sampling probabilities by household size,\nand nonrandom nonresponse. Measures of several risk fac-\ntors were not available for 162 respondents requiring inter-\nviews with proxies, reducing the sample to 4,000 nonproxy\nrespondents. Compared with others, the respondents who\nrequired proxies were older, in poorer health, and more\nlikely to be disabled at baselipe.\nMeasures\nDependent variables.--Based on prior factor-analytic re-\nmeasures were coded using items from the modified Katz\nactivities of daily living (ADL) scale (Branch, Katz, Kniep-\nmann, & Papsidero, 1984) and the Older Americans Re-\nsources and Services (OARS) instrumental activities of\ndaily living (IADL) scale (Fillenbaum, 1988): (a) basic\nADL activities (bathing, dressing, transferring, using the\ntoilet) and (b) household ADLs (meal preparation, shop-\nping, housework). A third disability measure discussed by\nJohnson and Wolinsky (1993)--the \"advanced\" ADLs--\nwas not used due to poor measurement properties. We also\nused a measure of impaired mobility (climbing stairs, walk-\ning half a mile) developed by Guralnik and colleagues\n(1993) from the Rosow-Breslau scale (Rosow & Breslau,\ndicates these different dimensions of disability relate differ-\nently to risk factors considered in this article. Each disabil-\nity measure is dichotomous and coded 1 if a respondent is\ncompletely unable to perform one or more constituent tasks\nor (for Katz) without help from another person or device.\nContinuous outcome measures (the number of tasks the re-\nspondent cannot perform) were not used due to consider-\nable skew.\nTable 1 gives descriptive statistics on the disability mea-\nsures. Respondents disabled on a particular disability mea-\nsure at baseline were excluded when the development of\nthat disability was the dependent variable. Impaired mobil-\nity, which has the highest prevalence at baseline (1 - .72 =\n.28), also has the highest incidence rate (.46) over 6 years.\nImpaired basic ADL had the lowest prevalence rate. The\nbasic ADL and mobility items were asked at all six follow-\nup waves, while the household ADL items were asked at\nonly the two in-person follow-ups (Waves 4 and 7).\nIndependent variables.--In Figure 1, the independent\nvariables are arranged in a causal model consistent with\nPincus & Callahan, 1994). Controlling for other demograph-\nics, SES may affect disability via the risk factors included at\nStage 2. Smoking (Guralnik & Kaplan, 1989), being over-\nweight or underweight (Galanos, Pieper, Cornoni-Huntley,\nBales, & Fillenbaum, 1994), poor diet (Pincus & Callahan,\nrisk factors for disability, while moderate alcohol consump-\ntion has been shown to be protective (Guralnik & Kaplan,\n1989). In this study, we add private health insurance to the\nmodel in order to determine whether it is a significant and\nTable 1.

Detailed information on specific measures is given in Table 2.\nHealth-related behaviors include smoking, alcohol consumption, body weight, and diet. Stress includes inadequate housing and living in an unsafe neigh-\nborhood. Baseline health includes chronic conditions, hip fracture, cognitive problems, depression, and self-rated health. Health care utilization includes\nthe amount of care received, site of care, continuity of care, satisfaction with care, and whether respondent put off care due to cost.\noverlooked risk factor for disability among older persons.\nMedicaid coverage is also included as a control at Stage 2.\nBecause the Stage 2 risk factors may be correlated, it is im-\nportant to estimate their effects controlling for one another.\nBaseline health and patterns of health care utilization are in-\ncluded in Stages 3 and 4 to enable us to determine whether\nthey mediate any effects of insurance coverage on disability.\nPrivate coverage is measured by a single dummy variable\n(coded 1 for those who report they are covered by any health\ninsurance plan other than Medicare or Medicaid). This single\nself-report item was the only measure of private coverage\navailable to us. Although it is consistent with other studies\n(e.g., Blustein, 1995), our measure of private coverage con-\ntains more measurement error than would be present if ob-\njective, verifiable data were available. Because estimates of\nan independent variable's regression effect are biased down-\nward when measurement error is present (Bollen, 1989), the\ndirection of bias in our analyses will be toward underestimat-\ning the impact of insurance coverage on disability.\nThe specific measures used for the independent variables\nare described in Table 2. Socioeconomic status is assessed\nby education and by total family income at baseline. As\nnoted above, some reviewers interpret findings of a linear\nrelationship between SES and health as evidence that the\npoorer health of the poor is due primarily to factors other\nthan inadequate access to health care. In preliminary analy-\nses, we tested whether the effects of education and income\non disability were linear or nonlinear. Disability was re-\ngressed on education in years, family income in dollars, the\ndemographic controls in Figure 1, and quadratic (squared)\nterms for education and income. For each type of disability,\nthe quadratic term was significant (indicating significant\nnonlinearity) for income but not for education. Additional\nanalyses (using dummy variables to contrast low-, middle-,\nand upper-income respondents on disability) indicated that\nthe relationship between income and disability could be\nmodeled with a single dummy variable coded 1 for those\nrespondents with less than $5,000 in annual income.\nQuadratic terms were also used to test for nonlinearities\nin the effects of the other continuous independent variables.\nBased on preliminary findings of nonlinear effects that\ncould not be modeled adequately with dichotomous vari-\nables, squared as well as linear terms for body mass and al-\ncohol consumption were included in the regression models.\nBody mass was based on self-reported height and weight.\nSmoking was linearly related to disability. About 80% of\nrespondents were nondrinkers and most others drank in\nmoderation. This will limit our statistical power to detect\nthe effects of problem drinking. The measures of access to\nhealth care are based on the Andersen and Newman (1973)\nhealth care utilization model. Housing conditions and\nneighborhood safety are based on respondent self-report.\nThe health index is based on the physician-assessed (dif-\nferential) health impact of five chronic conditions and their\nsymptoms: myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes\nmellitus, stroke, and any cancer (Fillenbaum et al., 1993).\nThirty-six physicians rated health impact based on ques-\ntionnaire items about the presence of specific conditions\nand symptoms. The ratings were used to create an overall\nhealth scale, and respondents were divided into 3 groups of\nroughly equal size based on their scale scores. The CES-D\nitems (Radloff, 1977) in the Duke EPESE were dichoto-\nmous. A score of 9 or more on this scale has been shown to\nbe equivalent to a score of 16 or more on the original CES-\nD scale (Blazer et al., 1991). The health measures refer to\nhealth at baseline, while the health care utilization mea-\nsures refer to utilization during the year prior to the base-\nline interview.\nThe correlation between the income dummy variable and\neducation (-.37) was not so high as to indicate problems\nwith collinearity. Additional collinearity diagnostics (vari-\nance inflation factors) indicated no collinearity problems\nfor these two measures of SES or for the other independent\nvariables entered into the multiple regression models.\nMissing data.--The mean was imputed for independent\nvariables with less than 2% missing data. For items with\n2-5% missing data, we imputed a regression-predicted score\nbased on the other independent variables in the regression\nmodel (Dixon, 1983). For variables with 5% or more missing\ndata, we used the \"predictive mean matching\" method (Little,\n1986), a stochastic regression technique for imputing missing\ndata. Stochastic imputation (the imputation of an error term\nalong with a predicted score) is designed to estimate the vari-\nance as well as the mean of the imputed variable with accu-\nracy and, therefore, minimize bias in relevant tests of signifi-\ncance (David, Little, Samuhel, & Triest, 1986; Kalton &\nKasprzyk, 1986). Significance tests were adjusted to reflect\nthe number of nonmissing cases prior to imputation.\nIncome had more missing data (18.8%) than any other\nindependent variable. As reported elsewhere (Landerman,\nLand, & Pieper, 1997), the predictive mean matching\nmethod for imputing missing data on income has been ex-\ntensively tested in the EPESE data. Results for the imputa-\ntion model used here (which explained over 50% of the\nvariance in income) indicate that bias and distortion are\nsufficiently minimal as to be nonproblematic with up to\n20% missing data. As an additional check, we reestimated\nour regression models without imputation but with missing\nincome values coded 1 on a missing data (dummy) indica-\ntor variable. We also repeated our analyses replacing family\nincome with a subjective measure of income adequacy (in-\nTable 2.

The results of\nboth reanalyses were consistent with those reported in the\nnext section of this article.\nStatistical Analysis\nused for the longitudinal analysis of the first occurrence of\ndisability among those who were not disabled at baseline.\nRespondents contribute an observation for each \"interval\"\n(period between waves) at risk until an event (disability),\ndeath, or censoring at the end of the study period (Allison,\n1995). These intervals become the units of analysis in a\nproportional odds model (Cox, 1972), and logistic regres-\nsion is used to estimate the effects of predictors on the odds\nof a future event among those who remain at risk. Because\nrespondents who died during the course of the study are re-\nmoved from the group at risk of disability, death is treated\nas a \"competing risk\" (Allison, 1984) in the analyses. Sen-\nsitivity analyses (described in the Results section) were em-\nployed to assess potential bias due to a positive association\nbetween disability and attrition due to death.\nFor each type of disability, we estimated the four hierar-\nchical logistic regression equations corresponding to the\nstages in Figure 1:\n(1) Disability = Education + Income + Demographic Controls\n+ Health Related Behaviors + Stress\n(2) Disability = Education + Income + Demographic Controls\n+ Health Related Behaviors + Stress\n+ Lacks Private Health Insurance\n(3) Disability = Education + Income + Demographic Controls\n+ Health Related Behaviors + Stress\n+ Lacks Private Health Insurance + Baseline Health\n(4) Disability = Education + Income + Demographic Controls\n+ Health Related Behaviors + Stress\n+ Lacks Private Health Insurance + Baseline Health\n+ Health Care Utilization\nEquation 2 estimates the impact of health insurance cover-\nage on disability controlling for SES, other demographics,\nhealth related behaviors, and stress. Equation 1 is included\nto enable us to determine the degree to which the effects of\neducation and income on disability are mediated by insur-\nance coverage. As shown by Alwin and Hauser (1981),\nchanges in the regression coefficients across hierarchical\nequations indicate the degree to which effects in an initial\nequation are mediated by predictors added in a subsequent\nequation. In Equations 3 and 4, we add baseline health and\nhealth care utilization to the model to determine the degree\nto which the effects of insurance coverage are mediated by\nbaseline health and then by patterns of health care utiliza-\ntion. Significance tests were performed using SUDAAN\n(1989), a specialized software program that adjusts for\nclustering and stratification in the sampling design.\nRESULTS\nTable 3 presents correlations between health insurance\ncoverage and the other independent variables in the design.\nCompared with other respondents, those who lack private\ninsurance coverage are older and less educated; they are\nalso more likely to be African American, to earn less than\n$5,000 per year, and to reside in a rural area. When these\ndemographics were entered together in a regression model\npredicting coverage, each year of education increased the\nodds of having coverage by about 13% (p < .01), while low\nincome respondents were four times as likely as others to\nlack coverage (p < .01). Contrary to our expectation, those\nrespondents without insurance coverage are not consis-\ntently more likely to engage in risky behavior: They are\nmore likely to be overweight and to cook with fat, but they\nare less likely to smoke or drink. They are also more likely\nto be on Medicaid and to live in inadequate housing or in\nan unsafe neighborhood. On all measures except hip frac-\nture, those without private coverage were in poorer health\nat baseline.\nPatterns of health care utilization differ according to\nTable 3.

The lack of pri-\nvate coverage is associated with putting off care due to\ncosts, receiving care in a hospital rather than a doctor's of-\nfice or clinic, and in a public rather than a private health\ncare facility. Individuals who lack private coverage report\nlower levels of satisfaction with the care they receive; they\nalso report more outpatient visits and more visits to an\nemergency room, and they are less likely to see the same\nprovider each time.\nTable 4 presents the effects of the independent variables\non the odds of an initial disability among those who were\nnot disabled at baseline. Coefficients are estimated control-\nling for the other predictors in each equation. Equation 2\ngives the effects of insurance coverage controlling for de-\nmographics, health related behaviors, and stress. Insurance\ncoverage is a significant predictor for each outcome, with\nthe odds of disability from 35% to 48% higher among those\nwithout supplemental coverage. On the basic ADLs, the im-\npact of (no) insurance coverage (1.48) is equivalent to the\neffect of being 4 years older (1.104). Effects of similar mag-\nnitude (relative to age) are present for the household ADLs\nand mobility.\nChanges in the coefficients for income from Equation 1\nof its effect on the basic ADLs is mediated by (indirect via)\ninsurance coverage. The effect of income on mobility de-\nclines by 37% from Equation 1 to Equation 2. For the\nhousehold ADLs, the (nonsignificant) coefficient for in-\ncome decreases by half across equations. Although the ef-\nfects of education also decline from Equation 1 to Equation\n2, decreases are smaller (< = 20%) than those for income.\nIn Equation 3, the effect of insurance coverage is reduced\nbaseline health, which is strongly related to subsequent dis-\nability. Insurance remains significant on two outcomes con-\ntrolling for baseline health, and a trend in the expected di-\nrection is present for the household ADLs.\nOther risk factors in Equation 3 are related to disability\nas expected. For body mass, coefficients between 0 and 1,\ntogether with coefficients greater than 1 for body mass\nsquared, reflect a U-shaped relationship where the odds of\neach type of disability are elevated among underweight and\noverweight respondents. Smoking is associated with im-\npaired mobility only. Alcohol consumption is also related to\nmobility, with nondrinkers and heavier drinkers at increased\nrisk. Inadequate housing is a risk factor for mobility. Mea-\nsures of whether a respondent added salt to food, cooked\nwith fat, received Medicaid benefits, and suffered from de-\npression were not significant on any outcome and were\ndropped from the final models.\nMeasures of health care utilization are added to the\nmodel in Equation 4.

Coefficients for insurance\ncoverage remain virtually unchanged from Equation 3 to\nEquation 4, indicating that these measures of utilization do\nnot mediate the effects of insurance coverage on disability.\nInitial disability versus subsequent disabilities.--For the\nbasic ADLs and mobility, we estimated models (results\navailable upon request) for second and third instances of\ndisability among those who suffered an initial disability, re-\ncovered, and reentered the risk set. (With only two follow-\nup waves, the household ADLs did not provide sufficient\nrecovered cases for analysis.) Only age had statistically sig-\nnificant effects that were similar (in direction and magni-\ntude) to its effects in the model for initial disability. The\nfailure of our model to replicate for second and third dis-\nabilities may be due to the small numbers (492 for the basic\nADLs) who became impaired, recovered, and reentered the\nrisk set. For mobility, where 894 respondents recovered and\nreentered the risk set, the effect of insurance coverage was\nin the expected direction, but did not reach significance. Or\nit may be that the degree of recovery is more important\nthan social factors after an initial disability. Because our re-\nsults were different for second and third disabilities, we do\nnot present \"repeated events\" models (Allison, 1995),\nwhich combine initial and subsequent disabilities, and we\ndo not attempt to generalize our findings from initial to sub-\nsequent disabilities.\nDisability and mortality.--Survival models can produce\nbiased results when censoring is substantial and related to\nthe event of interest (Allison, 1995; Gelman, Gelber, Hen-\nderson, Coleman, & Harris, 1990; Mor, Wilcox, Rakowski,\n& Hiris, 1994). Thirty percent of our baseline sample died\nby the sixth follow-up wave, and additional analyses (avail-\nable upon request) showed that mortality was positively re-\nlated to each type of disability. Although the biasing effects\nof censoring due to death cannot be modeled explicitly and\ncorrected, Allison (1995) describes a sensitivity analysis\nthat can be used to assess the severity of the problem. Mod-\nels for disability are first reestimated; cases censored due to\ndeath are treated as if they became disabled at the time of\ncensoring. The models are reestimated again; those who\ndied are treated as if they did not experience disability and\nare assigned a time of censoring equal to the longest cen-\nsoring time in the sample (here, censoring after six follow-\nup waves). If parameter estimates from the original analysis\nresemble parameter estimates when mortality is treated in\nthese two extreme ways, one can conclude that bias due to\nthe association between disability and death is negligible.\nFor all predictors except gender and smoking, parameter\nestimates from the sensitivity analyses were very close (in\ndirection, magnitude, and statistical significance) to those\nin Table 4, indicating that bias due to the association be-\ntween disability and mortality is minimal. Because being\nfemale was strongly protective for mortality but not for dis-\nability, its effects on disability were biased in a protective\ndirection when mortality was coded as an event. Because\nsmoking was related to death but not to basic or household\nADL disability, it became a risk factor for these outcomes\n(and the positive relationship between smoking and im-\npaired mobility was inflated) when death was coded as an\nevent.\nDISCUSSION\nOn the basic and household ADLs and mobility, those\nwithout private health insurance were at increased risk of\ndisability. Controlling for demographic characteristics and\na variety of risk factors (smoking, drinking, diet, body\nmass, stress) that have attracted considerably more atten-\ntion than insurance coverage in prior studies, the odds of\ndisability were from 35% to 48% higher among those re-\nspondents without private coverage. Private insurance cov-\nerage, which was positively related to income, also medi-\nated the effects of income on disability. Across dependent\nvariables, the regression effects of income declined by 29%\nor more when insurance coverage was added to the regres-\nsion models.\nSeveral observers have cited a linear relationship be-\ntween socioeconomic status and health as evidence that the\npoorer health of the socioeconomically disadvantaged is the\nresult of factors other than inadequate access to care (Adler,\nBoyce, Chesney, Folkman, & Syme, 1993; Bunker &\ninadequate access would result in a nonlinear income ef-\nfect, with the poor at increased risk. The effects of income\non disability here were nonlinear, as they were in House et\nal. (1990). Those in the bottom third of the income distribu-\ntion, who were four times as likely as others to lack private\ncoverage, were at increased risk of disability.\nThe effects of other risk factors on disability were mostly\nas expected. Being underweight or overweight increased\nthe odds of disability on all three outcomes. The effects of\nsmoking and alcohol consumption were limited to mobility,\nbut sensitivity analyses indicated that increased mortality\namong smokers had probably attenuated its effects on the\ndependent variables. Living in inadequate housing was also\nassociated with increased odds of disability.\nRespondents without private coverage were more likely\nto put off care due to costs, were more likely to receive care\nin a hospital setting rather than a doctor's office or clinic\nand in a public rather than a private facility, and were less\nsatisfied with the health care they received. However, these\ndifferences were unrelated to disability and, therefore, did\nnot explain statistically the relationship of disability to in-\nsurance coverage; neither did measures of the amount of\noutpatient and inpatient care received.\nFindings from other studies suggest a variety of other\nways that the lack of insurance coverage may affect disabil-\nity by restricting access to appropriate care; however, the\nabsence of appropriate measures prevented us from investi-\ngating these. Medicare recipients without private coverage\nare less likely to receive preventive care, such as cancer\nscreening (Blustein, 1995). A randomized group of Medi-\ncare recipients given free preventive visits (not covered by\nMedicare) made more preventive visits and showed im-\nproved health compared to controls (German et al., 1995).\nAmong Medicare recipients, the lack of private coverage\nadversely affects care for arthritis (Grana & Stuart, 1997),\nlung cancer (Greenberg et al., 1988), and dental care (Man-\nski, 1994), and those without private insurance are in\npoorer health when they go for care (Mentnech et al.,\n1995). Prescription drugs are not covered by Medicare, and\nrates of prescription drug use are lower among older adults\nwithout private health insurance (Fillenbaum et al., 1993).\nIt is also possible that the relationship between insurance\ncoverage and disability in our data is the result of their\ncommon association with some unmodeled factor related to\naccess to care. Because the insurance effect remained sub-\nstantial when baseline health was added to the models, it is\nunlikely that differences in commitment to health and\nhealth practices prior to age 65 will account for it the ef-\nfects of insurance coverage. On the other hand, measure-\nment error may have limited our ability to fully control for\nbaseline health; also, a model that included measures of\nhealth practices prior to age 65 might yield smaller insur-\nance effects.\nRegular exercise, which is protective for disability (La-\nCroix, Guralnik, Berkman, Wallace, & Satterfield, 1993),\nmay be positively related to insurance status, but was not\ncontrolled due to the lack of an available measure. As dis-\ncussed by Williams and Collins (1995), permanent wealth\nin the form of assets may be a better indicator of financial\nwell-being than current income after age 65. No measure of\nassets was available as a control, however, and the effect\nof insurance on disability may reflect differences in finan-\ncial assets. The fact that the insurance effect remained\nunchanged when we substituted a subjective measure of\nfinancial well-being for income (to test our imputation\nmethod) provides some contrary evidence but does not re-\nsolve this issue.\nSome other limitations of this study were mentioned ear-\nlier. Measurement error in our self-report measure of pri-\nvate health insurance coverage has likely attenuated the\nmeasure's effects in our analyses. Respondents in the poor-\nest health were excluded because relevant measures were\nnot collected in proxy interviews. For the basic ADLs and\nmobility, the model for initial disability did not hold for\nsubsequent disabilities among those who recovered. For the\nhousehold ADLs, there was insufficient data to address this\nissue. In this regard, it should also be noted that some re-\nspondents may have experienced an episode of disability\nand recovered prior to baseline. To the extent that this is the\ncase (and we are including subsequent disabilities in our\nmodel for initial disabilities), the direction of bias would\nbe toward finding no significant effects except age. In ad-\ndition, our findings are based on a regional rather than a\nnational sample. As noted earlier, low rates of alcohol con-\nsumption in North Carolina may have attenuated our esti-\nmates of its effects on the development of disability. The\nimpact of private insurance on health might also vary by\nregion, based on the characteristics of local health care\nsystems.\nThe relationship between private insurance and disability\nmerits particular attention with respect to public policy. If\nthis relationship reflects differences in access to care, it\nsuggests that providing additional coverage to those with-\nout private insurance (37% of our sample) would reduce\nthe odds of disability by up to 48% among those aged 65\nand older. Alternatively, the relationship between private\nhealth insurance and disability might be due to their com-\nmon association with some unmodeled third factor, such as\nexercise or financial assets. The evidence we were able to\nbring to bear on this issue does not resolve the issue. Nev-\nertheless, we have found substantial differences in the rate\nof disability between respondents with and respondents\nwithout supplemental insurance coverage. Other studies\nprovide considerable evidence that older adults without pri-\nvate coverage do not have equal access to health care.\nTaken together, these findings are evidence that the impact\nof insurance coverage on the health of older persons de-\nserves a great deal more attention than it has received in\nprior studies dealing with risk factors for disability and\ntheir policy implications.\n"
