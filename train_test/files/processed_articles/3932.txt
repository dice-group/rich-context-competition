    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nDistal symmetrical sensory neuropathy in diabetes involves\nthe dying back of axons, and the pathology equates with\naxonal dystrophy generated under conditions of aberrant\nCa2+ signalling. Previous work has described abnormalities\nin Ca2+ homoeostasis in sensory and dorsal horn neurons\nacutely isolated from diabetic rodents. We extended this\nwork by testing the hypothesis that sensory neurons exposed\nto long-term Type 1 diabetes in vivo would exhibit abnormal\naxonal Ca2+ homoeostasis and focused on the role of SERCA\n(sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase). DRG\n(dorsal root ganglia) sensory neurons from age-matched\nnormal and 3\u00ad5-month-old STZ (streptozotocin)-diabetic\nrats (an experimental model of Type 1 diabetes) were cul-\ntured. At 1\u00ad2 days in vitro an array of parameters were\nmeasured to investigate Ca2+ homoeostasis including (i)\naxonal levels of intracellular Ca2+, (ii) Ca2+ uptake by the ER\n(endoplasmic reticulum), (iii) assessment of Ca2+ signalling\nfollowing a long-term thapsigargin-induced blockade of\nSERCA and (iv) determination of expression of ER mass and\nstress markers using immunocytochemistry and Western\nblotting. KCl- and caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients in axons\nwere 2-fold lower in cultures of diabetic neurons compared\nwith normal neurons indicative of reduced ER calcium\nloading. The rate of uptake of Ca2+ into the ER was reduced\nby 2-fold (P,0.05) in diabetic neurons, while markers for ER\nmass and ER stress were unchanged. Abnormalities in Ca2+\nhomoeostasis in diabetic neurons could be mimicked via\nlong-term inhibition of SERCA in normal neurons. In\nsummary, axons of neurons from diabetic rats exhibited\naberrant Ca2+ homoeostasis possibly triggered by sub-\noptimal SERCA activity that could contribute to the distal\naxonopathy observed in diabetes.\n",

Free [Ca2+] in the ER lumen ([Ca2+]ER\nis ER calcium concentration) is three to four orders of\nmagnitude greater than the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration\nis intracellular calcium concentration). This results in a\nsteep concentration gradient and constant leakage of Ca2+\nions from the ER into the cytoplasm, which is counteracted by\nER Ca2+ uptake driven by SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum\ncalcium ATPase) pumps on the ER membrane. The ability of the\nER to release Ca2+ in response to physiological stimulation is\ndetermined by three major types of channels: RyR (ryano-\ndine receptor) and InsP3\nR (inositol triphosphate receptor) and\nreceptors activated by NAADP (nicotinic acid\u00adadenine dinu-\ncleotide phosphate) (Sitsapesan et al., 1995; Sutko and Airey,\nis\nmaintained at ,100 nM by plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases\nand the SERCA pumps of the ER. Inhibition of ER Ca2+ uptake\nby blockade of SERCA or excessive Ca2+ release from ER by\nactivation of ER-resident Ca2+ channels would alter this\nbalance of Ca2+ such that [Ca2+]ER\nwould decrease and [Ca2+]i\nwould be elevated.

Animal models of diabetic neuropathy reveal similar\npathology and, in common with humans, exhibit sensory\nhypoalgesia and tactile allodynia (Christianson et al., 2003,\naxonopathy observed in diabetes is also seen in cultured\nneurons isolated from diabetic rats (Zherebitskaya et al., 2009;\nAkude et al., 2010). We and others have demonstrated that\nexperimental diabetes induces significant changes in Ca2+\nhomoeostasis in DRG (dorsal root ganglia) sensory neurons\n2004). This includes a steady-state increase in [Ca2+]i\n, increased\nhigh threshold Ca2+ currents and a decrease in the amplitude\nof depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i\nsignals.

This insert makes culturing suitable for growing\nthe cell body and axon compartments of neurons on different\nsites of the membrane and to then separately collect these\ncompartments in lysates for Western blotting (Zheng et al.,\n2001). Neurons were cultured on inserts for 2 days in defined\nHams F12 medium in the presence of modified Bottensteins\nN2 supplement without insulin as described above.

Dye was reconstituted\nin 1 ml of distilled water (PMPI stock) and was used at 1:3000\ndilution. Cultured lumber DRG neurons were incubated with\nPMPI at 37\u00b0C for 1 h.

Changes in\nfluorescence in axons were assessed with a Carl Zeiss LSM510\nconfocal inverted microscope as described above.\nMag-Fura patch-clamp\nThe intraluminal ER Ca2+ concentration was measured in\nneuronal cell bodies as described previously (Solovyova and\n) measurements cells were loaded with AM deriva-\ntives of Mag-Fura 2. The AM form of the indicator can\npassively diffuse across cell membranes. Once inside the cell,\ncytosolic and organelle esterases cleave the ester group off\nthe probe, restoring the active Ca2+-binding form of the\nindicator, and confining the indicator within different\nintracellular compartments. Loading at 37\u00b0C is favoured due\nto entrapment into intracellular organelles. In the patch-\nclamp configuration, the cytosolic dye was washed out into\nthe pipette allowing selective imaging of the fluorescence\nof the dye trapped within the ER lumen.

Quantification of\ncalnexin expression in axons, a marker of ER mass, revealed no\nmajor difference between control and diabetic cultures,\nindicating no changes in overall ER presence in the cells.\nAxonal expression of ER stress protein GRP78 also was not\naltered by a history of diabetes. Patch-clamp and pharmaco-\nlogical studies on cell bodies of sensory neurons showed that\nthe function of SERCA pumps was depressed in diabetic cul-\ntures, as was expression of SERCA2a protein (confirmed in a\nprevious in vivo study with intact lumbar DRG; Verkhratsky and\nFernyhough, 2008), and could be responsible for impaired\nloading of Ca2+ into the ER. The results support previous work\non acutely isolated neurons from diabetic rodents (Voitenko\net al., 2004) and enforce the notion that early abnormalities in\nCa2+ homoeostasis mediated by impaired SERCA functioning\nmay trigger axonal degeneration seen in diabetes.\nThe [Ca2+]ER\nimaging studies presented in Figure 5 reveal\nthat Ca2+ uptake into the ER lumen was suppressed by at\nleast 2-fold in diabetic cultures. Figure 6 shows that specific\ninhibition of SERCA activity using TG was able to closely\nmimic abnormalities in Ca2+ homoeostasis seen in diabetes,\ne.g. raised resting [Ca2+]i\nand impaired ER Ca2+ release. The\nimmunocytochemistry results in Figure 3 suggested a general\nloss of ER mass in axons in diabetic culture; however, this\nfinding was not supported by the Western blotting approach\nusing culture inserts (Figure 4). The Western blot data were\ngenerated relative to total protein and in diabetes a general\ndown-regulation of protein occurs and so specific changes in\ncalnexin may have been under-estimated. There is previous\nevidence of reduced expression of SERCA2a, and these data\nsupport the hypothesis that diabetes-induced SERCA deac-\ntivation underlies reduced Ca2+ loading in the ER. Diminished\nactivity of SERCA could be solely due to loss of expression,\nand there is evidence that insulin can regulate SERCA activity\nin non-neuronal cells (Borge and Wolf, 2003; Abdallah et al.,\n2006). However, it is also feasible that impaired cellular\nbioenergetics may result in suboptimal ATP delivery for\nSERCA function since the respiratory chain activity and\nexpression in DRG neurons is down-regulated in STZ-induced\ncause of the latter feature of diabetes-induced impairment in\nneuronal function is complex and could also be the result of\ndysfunctional Ca2+ homoeostasis. Figure 6 demonstrates that\nTG-induced decrease in resting [Ca2+]ER\nand a subsequent rise\nin resting [Ca2+]i\n, as seen in sensory neurons acutely isolated\nfrom diabetic rats and mice (Voitenko et al., 2000; Kostyuk\naccompanied by mitochondrial inner membrane depolariza-\ntion. Impaired Ca2+ homoeostasis leading to a rise in resting\nmay result in Ca2+ entry into the mitochondrion,\nprimarily through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, raised\nintramitochondrial calcium concentration ([Ca2+]m\n) and\nmitochondrial membrane depolarization and altered bioener-\ngetics (Verkhratsky and Toescu, 1998; Verkhratsky and\nOur observations show that ER membrane dysfunction in\nthe form of aberrant SERCA activity was present, but in the\nabsence of overt ER stress. The marker of ER stress, GRP78, did\nnot undergo an elevation in expression in cell body or axons\nof cultured diabetic neurons. This confirmed preliminary\nwork from our laboratory showing a lack of effect of diabetes\non GRP78 expression in lumbar DRG or sciatic nerve of 2\u00ad3\nmonth-old STZ-induced diabetic rats. While the loss of Ca2+\nloading in the ER was not significant enough to trigger a\nmeasurable ER stress response in our system the possibility of\ninduction of SOCE [SOC (store-operated calcium) entry]\ncannot be dismissed. Neurons have recently been demon-\nstrated to exhibit SOCE and express the ER proteins STIM1\n(stromal interaction molecule 1) and STIM2 that detect Ca2+\nloading in the ER and link to SOC channel activity in the plasma\nmembrane (Gruszczynska-Biegala et al., 2011). The permanent\ndepletion of ER Ca2+ in diabetic neurons could be sensed by\nthe STIM proteins and lead to an activation of SOCE and\ncontribute to the rise in resting [Ca2+]i\n. In fact, in an HIV-\ninduced model of sensory neuron degeneration blockade of\nSOCE was protective (Hoke et al., 2009).\nThe impact of a long-term rise in resting [Ca2+]i\non axonal\nfunction and association with axon degeneration has been\nVerkhratsky and Fernyhough, 2008). Examples of Ca2+-induced\naberrant axon behaviour include fragmentation of micro-\ntubules due to activation of proteases of the proteasome or\ncalpain and have been associated with the expression of the\nautophagy marker LC3 (Knoferle et al., 2010). In the optic\nnerve preparation, lesion-dependent LC3 expression has been\nlinked to an initial axotomy-induced increase of [Ca2+]i\nand to\na secondary elevation in autophagy (Knoferle et al., 2010). This\nis of importance, since in lumbar DRG in STZ-induced diabetic\nrats there is preliminary evidence for markers of autophagy\nbeing enhanced (Towns et al., 2005). The Ca2+-dependent\nactivation of calpain in the axoplasm is also of particular\ninterest, since this event has been directly linked to mito-\nchondrial biology in axons and generation of axonal swellings\n(Kilinc et al., 2009). Other consequences of Ca2+ influx are of\nnote: there is a general alteration in the phosphorylation\nbalance, mediated for example by Ca2+/CaM (calmodulin)\nbinding to the phosphatase calcineurin or to CaM kinases\nE.

This array of\nCa2+-induced events could lead to cytoskeletal dissolution,\nmitochondrial dysfunction and eventually axonal degeneration.\nIn conclusion, axons of diabetic neurons exhibit impaired\ncalcium homoeostasis with dysfunction primarily the result of\nsub-optimal SERCA activity and/or expression. The diminished\nability of the ER to accumulate Ca2+ could lead to the rise in\nresting [Ca2+]i\nobserved in neurons from diabetic rats. The sub-\noptimal levels of Ca2+ within the ER lumen could also initiate\nSOCE that could contribute to a rise in resting [Ca2+]i\n. The two\nmajor consequences of the rise in resting [Ca2+]i\ncould be\nmitochondrial dysfunction, mediated though enhanced Ca2+\nuptake and inner membrane depolarization, and a general\neffect of raised Ca2+ on an array of enzymes important for\nhomoeostatic control of protein function in the axoplasm. The\noutcome is axonal degeneration through dissolution of\nthe cytoarchitecture and/or loss of cellular bioenergetics.\n"
