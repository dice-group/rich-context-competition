Previous evidence\nsuggests that obesity, which has reached epidemic\nproportions in the United States (1), may be inversely\nassociated with PSA (2-7), likely due to lower testos-\nterone concentrations that influence PSA production\n(8-10) and/or the hemodilution of PSA among obese\nmen (11). However, there is little evidence whether\nlifestyle and physiologic factors related to obesity,\nincluding energy, fat, and carbohydrate intake, physical\nactivity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome,\ninfluence PSA concentrations. One previous large clinical\ntrial (N = 3,341) evaluated energy, fat, and carbohydrate\nintake in relation with PSA concentrations and found no\nassociations (12). Another study that examined physical\nactivity in relation to PSA reported null findings (13).\nTo our knowledge, the associations of PSA with insulin\nresistance and metabolic syndrome have not been\nexamined previously. Although one study, making use\nof national data, has reported inverse associations\nbetween diabetes and PSA (14), it must be noted that\nnot all diabetics are insulin resistant or have metabolic\nsyndrome.\nBecause the relationships of PSA, obesity, physical\nactivity, diet, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome\nare complex and not well defined, there is a need to\nunderstand these further. Investigating this area may aid\nin the more accurate interpretation of PSA and has\npotential implications on prostate cancer screening and\ndetection in the population.

Figure 1 presents our\nhypothetical framework for asking these questions.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Population. We combined data from the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\ntwo nationally representative cross-sectional surveys\nof the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the\nUnited States. The details of the procedures involved\nin sampling and data collection have been published\nelsewhere (15). All procedures were approved by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review\nBoard; a written, informed consent was obtained from\nall participants.\nrectal digital examination in the past week, prostate\nbiopsy in the past 30 d, cytoscopy in the past 30 d, or\nhad a history of prostate cancer or current prostate\ninflammation (n = 203) were ineligible for PSA testing in\nthe NHANES and were excluded from this study (16)\nbecause these conditions cause PSA levels to be elevated.\nWe also excluded those participants for whom there were\nno data available for the PSA eligibility criteria (n = 359) or\nmen in the analyses data set. These exclusion criteria are\nconsistent with previously published data from the\nExposure Variables. Diet was estimated from the\n24-h dietary recall during an in-person interview for both\nNHANES study populations. For the study participants\ndone over the phone as a follow-up. However, to ensure\nconsistency across the two surveys, we assessed the\nenergy intake for these participants from the in-person\n24-h recall. We determined the level of leisure-time\nphysical activity from the responses to a series of\nquestions asked in the interview about physical activity\ndone during the past 30 d. The participants were\nconsidered to be physically active if they mentioned\nany leisure-time physical activity. To ascertain whether\nthe men were vigorously active, they were queried\nwhether they did any activity that caused heavy\nsweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate\n(e.g., swimming, aerobics, or fast cycling). For moderate\nphysical activity, the participants were queried whether\nthey did any activities that caused light sweating or a\nmoderate increase in the heart rate, such as playing\ngolf, dancing, bicycling for pleasure, or walking. The\nindividuals who did not report participating in either\nmoderate or vigorous physical activity were considered\nto be sedentary.\nParticipant age, race/ethnicity, smoking history, years\nof education, and history of doctor-diagnosed medical\nconditions, including hypertension, were self-reported\nin a structured personal interview (15). Serum PSA,\ntriglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein concentra-\ntions were estimated from blood samples collected in the\nMobile Examination Center exam. Fasting plasma glu-\ncose and insulin concentrations, measured in a subpop-\nulation of participants >12 y examined in the morning\nsession after an overnight fast of at least 8 h, were used to\ncompute insulin resistance through the homeostasis\nmodel assessment algorithm, in which a value of 2.4 or\nhigher was considered insulin resistant (17). Insulin\nconcentrations were assayed with different laboratory\nrespectively. Therefore, we used the regression coeffi-\nrecommended by the NHANES to make the values\ncomparable when combining the data from the two\nsurveys. Weight, height, and waist circumference were\nmeasured in the Mobile Examination Center with the\nuse of standardized procedures. Based on the Adult\nFigure 1.

For this study, BMI [weight (kg)/height2 (m)] was\nStatistical Analyses. The serum PSA concentrations\nwere not normally distributed; therefore, we log-\ntransformed the PSA. We calculated the percent of total\nenergy consumed from dietary fats and carbohydrate.\nThe total energy, percent fat, and carbohydrate intakes\nwere divided into tertiles, and physical activity was\ndefined as a dichotomous variable (sedentary/moderate\nto intense activity). We computed the geometric mean\nPSA by the intake levels of energy, fat, and carbohydrate\nand the level of physical activity. We then computed the\ngeometric mean PSA concentration for two physiologic\nfactors associated with obesity: status of insulin resis-\ntance (dichotomous; yes/no) and metabolic syndrome\n(dichotomous; yes/no). We adjusted the geometric mean\nPSA concentrations for age, race, and BMI because these\nvariables were associated with PSA in this sample (7, 20).\nAdditionally, we included a variable for the survey year\nmodels. P values comparing the PSA for the highest and\nlowest tertiles of energy, carbohydrate, and fat intake,\nlevel of physical activity, and PSA among men with\nversus without insulin resistance and metabolic syn-\ndrome were calculated based on two-sample, unequal-\nvariance t tests with Satterthwaite approximation of\ndegrees of freedom. Further, for metabolic syndrome, we\nexplored the association of PSA with the number of\nmetabolic abnormalities as a continuous variable (with\nvalues ranging from 0 to 5) to investigate whether the\ncumulative effect of the biochemical derangements that\nare components of metabolic syndrome influence PSA\nconcentrations. In separate models, we repeated all\nanalyses for the three racial subgroups (non-Hispanic\nwhites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans).\nAdditionally, we explored the effect of the joint exposure\nphysiologic factor on PSA. Because the results were in a\nsimilar direction for the obese (BMI = 30-35) and very\nobese men (BMI = >35), we combined the two groups to\nwere applied in all the analyses to account for individual\nselection probabilities, nonresponse, and poststratifica-\ntion that resulted from the complex survey design.

Nearly 80% of the study\npopulation was non-Hispanic white, with a median age\nof 52 years (Table 1). Three fourths of the population was\neither obese or overweight (BMI >25), with the median\nBMI being 28. At least half of the participants had PSA\nand reported being either moderately or intensely active.\nFurther, in the subpopulation in which we were able to\nevaluate metabolic syndrome, 41% of the participants\nhad metabolic syndrome, and about half the population\nhad insulin resistance.\nAssociations between PSA and Lifestyle Factors.\nHigher energy intake was inversely associated with\nPSA concentrations after adjustment for age, race,\nand BMI (P = 0.0002).

Werny et al. (7)\nreported that PSA concentrations were lower among men\nWe now extend these investigations in the same\nnationally representative population to evaluate the\nassociation of PSA concentrations with obesity-related\nlifestyle factors (diet and physical activity) and physio-\nlogic factors (metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance).\nThe data from this large sample of American men who\nhad not undergone a recent digital rectal examination,\nprostate biopsy, or cytoscopy, or had a history of prostate\ncancer or prostatic inflammation suggest that higher\nenergy intake was inversely associated with PSA\nconcentrations. Furthermore, when we explored the joint\nexposure of higher body weight and higher energy\nintake, we noted that the PSA concentrations were lower\namong men with a BMI of 25 to 30 who reported higher\nthat energy and PSA are associated independently of\nBMI. A similar association that was not statistically\nsignificant was observed among men with BMI >30\n(n = 746; P = 0.09). This specific result, implying that the\nPSA levels of obese or overweight men consuming\nhigher energy may be lower than the actual value, has\npotential public health significance because the majority\nof American men are overweight or obese (1), as reflected\nin this present study sample (median BMI = 28 and waist\nsize is 102 cm). However, we cannot rule out the\npossibility that the inverse association between energy\nand PSA among overweight men may be obtained due\nto chance. It must be noted that, in this data set, energy\nintake was measured through a 24-hour recall and, like\nany other dietary assessment tool, this may contribute to\nmeasurement error in the estimation of energy intake.\nTherefore, the inverse associations that we note between\nenergy and PSA concentration in this population may be\nattenuated due to the misclassification of energy intake.\nOur finding of an inverse association between PSA\nand self-reported energy intake differs from the results\nof the large Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, a volunteer-\nbased trial that noted no associations between PSA and\nquintile of energy intake estimated from a food frequen-\ncy questionnaire in the past year (12).\nA plausible explanation for the lower PSA concen-\ntrations among men with higher energy intakes in this\nsample may be due to inverse associations of energy\nand testosterone concentrations, which modulate PSA\nproduction in the prostate gland. In laboratory animals,\nlong-term energy restriction enhanced the production of\nserum testosterone compared with rats fed ad libitum,\nthereby suggesting that higher energy intake may lower\ntestosterone concentrations (21). In a small study (n =\n36), Fontana et al. (22) reported a nonsignificant\nsuggestion of lower serum testosterone in men on\ntypical high-caloric western diets. Further, it has been\nshown that PSA gene expression is closely linked with\nfree testosterone concentrations (23). However, there\nmay be unidentified alternate biochemical mechanisms\nthrough which higher energy intakes may relate to PSA\nconcentration.\nWe also note that men with insulin resistance had\nsignificantly lower PSA concentrations compared with\nmen without insulin resistance after adjusting for age,\nrace, and BMI. The underlying mechanisms are unclear\nat this time; however, insulin resistance may also be\nassociated with lower testosterone concentrations (24),\nwhich, in turn, may relate to lower PSA production as\noutlined in Fig. 1. When we investigated the PSA\nconcentrations and insulin resistance within BMI catego-\nries, PSA was not related to insulin resistance. This could\npossibly be due to reduced power because insulin\nresistance was only estimated in a subsample of the\nNHANES participants (n = 1,200). Differently from the\nassociations observed between insulin resistance and\nPSA, we did not find any difference in the PSA\nconcentrations among men with or without metabolic\nsyndrome, or the number of metabolic abnormalities\npresent among these men.\nWe also observed no associations between PSA and\npercent energy from fat or carbohydrate intake and level\nof physical activity in this data set. These observations\nwere consistent with the lack of association between fat\nand carbohydrate intake and PSA in the Prostate Cancer\nPrevention Trial (12). Similarly, data from two other\nprospective dietary intervention trials (25, 26) among\nmen who were randomized to low-fat, high-fruit, and\nhigh-vegetable diets showed no effect of such diets on\nPSA concentrations compared with control diets higher\nin fats. Furthermore, consistent with other studies, the\nPSA concentrations did not differ with level of physical\nSome limitations need to be considered when inter-\nis a cross-sectional survey that ascertained PSA concen-\ntrations at the same time as diet, physical activity, and\nblood levels. As in all dietary assessment tools used in\nnutritional epidemiology studies, there is likely to be the\nunavoidable measurement error of dietary energy, fat,\nand carbohydrate intake. However, we minimize this\nbias in our analyses by drawing conclusions based on the\ncomparison of extreme groups of energy, fat, and carbo-\nhydrate intakes. Despite our analytic strategy, residual\nconfounding relating to measuring diet imperfectly\nor over only short periods of time (24 hours) is likely\nto remain so that the associations of dietary intake to\nPSA concentrations are likely to reflect this fact, at least\nin part.\nAlthough the NHANES anthropometric measure-\nments were standardized and field tested, the BMI may\nbe subject to random measurement error, biasing results\ntoward the null. The levels of physical activity in this\ndata set were self-reported. The lack of association\nbetween physical activity levels and PSA may be due\nto the misclassification of physical activity levels.\nFurther, the level of physical activity was queried for\nthe past 30 days; therefore, we were unable to determine\nthe longer-term physical activity level among these\nparticipants. Another limitation of this study is that\nthere might be about 24% men with undiagnosed\nprostate cancer, as suggested by the Prostate Cancer\nPrevention Trial study, a large clinical trial (27). Lastly,\nthere may also be undetected prostate infection and\ninflammation in this population. The inability to exclude\nmen with these conditions might cause the PSA concen-\ntrations to be higher in our study population.\nCancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention\nResearch.\ncebp.aacrjournals.org\nDownloaded from\nIn conclusion, our findings of inverse associations\nbetween two factors associated with obesity, energy\nintake and insulin resistance, and PSA concentrations are\nprovocative and may have important implications on\nprostate cancer detection among American men. PSA is a\ncommon test used to screen for prostate cancer, and\nobesity is a public health concern in the United States,\nbeing either overweight or obese (1). These results\nsuggest that insulin-resistant men and men who are on\nhigher energy intakes are less likely to have elevated PSA\nand may not reach the biopsy threshold. Accordingly,\nPSA velocity may be more valuable in identifying\nprogressive prostate cancer among these men. The\nbiochemical mechanisms of how higher energy intake\nmodulates a decrease in PSA production is unclear at this\ntime, and further studies are required to investigate this\nissue. The interrelationships of PSA, obesity, diet, insulin\nresistance, and metabolic syndrome require clarity in\nother populations, specifically in studies making use of a\nprospective design with better measures of diet and\nphysical activity. The confirmation of these relationships\nin additional studies may lead to a more accurate\ninterpretation of this important screening analyte.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\n"
