    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Previous literature has shown a divergence by age in the relationship between socioeconomic status\n(SES) and substance use: adolescents with low SES are more likely to engage in substance use, as are adults with\nhigh SES. However, there is growing evidence that adolescents with high SES are also at high risk for substance\nabuse. The objective of this study is to examine this relationship longitudinally, that is, whether wealthier\nadolescents are more likely than those with lower SES to engage in substance use in early adulthood.\nMethods: The study analyzed data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth), a\nlongitudinal, nationally-representative survey of secondary school students in the United States. Logistic regression\nmodels were analyzed examining the relationship between adolescent SES (measured by parental education and\nincome) and substance use in adulthood, controlling for substance use in adolescence and other covariates.\nResults: Higher parental education is associated with higher rates of binge drinking, marijuana and cocaine use in\nearly adulthood. Higher parental income is associated with higher rates of binge drinking and marijuana use. No\nstatistically significant results are found for crystal methamphetamine or other drug use. Results are not sensitive to\nthe inclusion of college attendance by young adulthood as a sensitivity analysis. However, when stratifying by race,\nresults are consistent for white non-Hispanics, but no statistically significant results are found for non-whites. This\nmay be a reflection of the smaller sample size of non-whites, but may also reflect that these trends are driven\nprimarily by white non-Hispanics.\nConclusions: Previous research shows numerous problems associated with substance use in young adults,\nincluding problems in school, decreased employment, increases in convictions of driving under the influence (DUI)\nand accidental deaths. Much of the previous literature is focused on lower SES populations. Therefore, it is possible\nthat teachers, parents and school administrators in wealthier schools may not perceive as great to address\nsubstance abuse treatment in their schools. This study can inform teachers, parents, school administrators and\nprogram officials of the need for addressing drug abuse prevention activities to this population of students.\nBackground\nThe relationship between childhood socioeconomic sta-\ntus (SES) and behavioral health in adulthood has long\nbeen of interest to researchers and policymakers. A few\nstudies have found that adolescents with low SES have a\ngreater propensity toward substance use during adoles-\ncence. Goodman and Huang [1], studying the first wave\nof AddHealth data cross-sectionally, found that having\nlow SES was associated with greater alcohol use and\nwith greater cigarette and cocaine use among white\nteenagers. Goodman and colleagues [2] found that lower\nhousehold income and parental education were asso-\nciated with greater adolescent depression. Friestad and\ncolleagues [3] found that low parental education and\nmoderate household income was associated with greater\nrates of smoking in adolescents. Reinherz and colleagues\n2000, found that low family SES and larger family size\nwere associated with increased probability of substance\nabuse disorders in early adulthood.

There is evidence that substance\nuse in adults, particularly alcohol use, may be sensitive\nto price, as some studies have shown that consumption\ndecreases as price increases [6-9]. For adolescents with\nhigher SES, having greater financial resources may indi-\ncate that the relative cost of substance use, that is the\nopportunity cost of substance use relative to other con-\nsumption, may be lower than for adolescents with lower\nSES. This is consistent with the usual demand model for\ngoods and services, and could indicate a higher demand\namong wealthier adolescents. This was found in a 2007\nstudy of British adolescents by Bellis and colleagues,\nwhich found that adolescents with more spending\nmoney were more likely to drink frequently, binge drink\nand to drink in public [10], as well as in a study of col-\nlege students in the United States, which found that col-\nlege students with lower levels of spending money had\nlower levels of drinking and getting drunk [11],\nEngagement in substance use can have negative impli-\ncations for young adults. Previous research has shown\nthat substance use at young ages is associated with\ndecreased educational attainment [12,13] and labor mar-\nket productivity [14,15]. Binge drinking in particular has\nbeen linked to driving under the influence of alcohol\n(DUI) and accidental deaths in college-age students [16].\nAs illicit drugs are illegal in the United States, the use\nof these substances places young adults at risk of invol-\nvement in the criminal justice system. Thus, substance\nuse can have substantial negative consequences for\nyoung adults. However, as much previous literature has\nfocused on the substance use of lower income adoles-\ncents [1-5], it is possible that parents, teachers, policy-\nmakers and program administrators may be less focused\non the possible long-term implications of substance use\nThe purpose of this study is to examine whether ado-\nlescents with high SES, as measured by parental educa-\ntion and income, are more likely to engage in alcohol\nand illicit drug use in early adulthood, using a prospec-\ntive, nationally-representative sample of secondary\nschool students in the United States. This expands upon\nthe work of Bellis and colleagues [10], who examined\ncross-sectional data on alcoholism in the United King-\ndom and Martin and colleagues [11], who examined\nprevalence of alcohol use among college students in the\nUnited States. As much of the previous literature has\nfocused on adolescents with lower SES, the findings of\nthis study could help parents, teachers and practitioners\nto identify students who may be at risk for future sub-\nstance use and educational problems.\nMethods\nData\nThe data comes from the National Longitudinal Survey\nof Adolescent Health (AddHealth). The first wave of\nof a nationally representative sample of school students\nin grades 7-12 in the United States. The sample was a\nschool-based cluster design, which was selected to\nensure a nationally representative population, by region,\nurbanicity, racial and ethnic composition, school type,\nand school size [20].\ninterview. Parents of students who were selected for the\nin-home interview were also interviewed. The third\nwave of the study, which followed-up respondents from\nrespondents were 18-27 years old. A few respondents\n(72 students) with mental retardation were excluded\nfrom the sample, as their educational trajectories are\nlikely to differ from those of their peers.\nEstimation Models\nThe estimation models examine the relationship between\nadolescent SES and subsequent use of alcohol and illicit\ndrugs, controlling for baseline use of alcohol and illicit\ndrugs and mental health (depressive symptoms, delin-\nquency and suicidality) and a set of other individual,\nfamily school and neighborhood characteristics.\nThe outcome variables of interest are binge drinking\nand illicit drug use in early adulthood. AddHealth asks\nrespondents separately about their use of alcohol, mari-\njuana, cocaine, crystal methamphetamine and any other\ndrug use. As the use of these substances is measured\nseparately in AddHealth, they are analyzed separately in\nthese analyses. Substance use was measured as a binary\nindicator of use, as previous research has found that\nresponders tend to report accurately whether they con-\nsume substances, but tend to under-report the amount\nconsumed [6]. Sensitivity analyses found that results\nwere qualitatively similar when examining a continuous\nmeasure of use (not shown).\nThe key independent variable was socioeconomic status\nat baseline, as measured by parental education and\nincome. As these were assessed separately in AddHealth,\nthey are analyzed separately in these analyses as well. The\nparents' socioeconomic status reflects the economic status\nof the family in which the adolescent resides at baseline.\nPrevious research has shown that parental socioeconomic\nstatus reflects the child's socioeconomic status [21]. The\nhighest educated parent was used rather than the educa-\ntion level of the mother and father to avoid losing\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/5/1/19\nrespondents living in single parent families [22]. House-\nhold income was also included as a separate measure of\nSES, as household income captures smaller gradations in\nfamily well-being than parental income [23].\nA number of the adolescent's baseline personal char-\nacteristics were also included in the model. The adoles-\ncent's baseline binge drinking and illicit drug use was\nincluded in the model in order that these models mea-\nsure change in substance use from baseline to follow-up\nin early adulthood. In addition, other behavioral health\nfactors at baseline were controlled for, including delin-\nquency, suicidality and depressive symptoms, due to the\nhigh rates of comorbidity of mental health diagnoses\namong persons with substance abuse [24].\nA number of demographic variables were also\nincluded in the model, including age, gender, and race/\nethnicity. Additional individual characteristics that have\nbeen shown to be correlated with educational attain-\nment were included, such the Peabody Picture Vocabu-\nlary (PPVT) score, which measures cognitive ability [25],\nand general health, which measures physical health and\nmay account for endogeneity between mental health and\nA number of family background variables were also\nincluded in the model. An indicator of whether the\nrespondent was the first child born in the family was\nincluded, as previous research has shown that children\nborn first in the family tend to have better educational\noutcomes [28]. Family structure (single parent household,\nstepfamily and foster/other) is included, as children from\nnon-traditional families often face barriers to schooling\n[29]. An indicator for whether the respondent's biological\nmother and father have alcoholism is included as alcohol-\nism has a high genetic component [30].\nThe estimation model is of the form:\nLogit p SES BH X\n, +\n( ) = + + + +\n    \nWhere:\n= Probability of substance use at Wave III, as\nmeasured by binge drinking, marijuana use, cocaine use,\ncrystal methamphetamine use and other drug use, esti-\nmated separately. Binge drinking was measured as a bin-\nary variable with a positive value indicating 5 or more\ndrinks in one setting more than once a month in the\npast year. Marijuana, cocaine, crystal methamphetamine\nand other drug use was measured as a binary variable\nwith a positive value indicating any use in the past 30\ndays.\n= Socioeconomic status at baseline, as measured\nby parental education and household income. Parental\neducation was measured by the education level of the\nhighest educated parent living with the adolescent, and\nwas categorized by the highest educated parent having\nnot completed high school, having completed high\nschool only, having education beyond high school but\nless than a college degree, or having a college degree.\nHousehold income was measured continuously and was\n= A number of behavioral health (mental health\nand substance use) characteristics at baseline in adoles-\ncence (Wave I interview) were included in the model:\nbinge drinking, marijuana, cocaine, inhalant and other\ndrug use at baseline, as well as depressive symptoms,\ndelinquency and suicidality. Each of these components\nwas included separately in the model. As with the out-\ncome variables, binge drinking in adolescence was mea-\nsured as a binary variable with a positive value\nindicating 5 or more drinks in one setting more than\nonce a month in the past year. Marijuana, cocaine, inha-\nlant and other drug use was measured as a binary vari-\nable with a positive value indicating any use of these\nsubstances in the past 30 days. Depressive symptoms are\nmeasured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies\nDepression scale (CES-D) [31,32]. Delinquency is a scale\nof 0-12 of criminal behaviors in the past year [33]. Sui-\ncidality is measured by a binary variable with a positive\nvalue indicating a suicide attempt in the past year.\nXi\n= A number of individual and family characteristics\nincluded as control variables. These include demo-\ngraphic variables such as gender, age, age squared\n(to account for non-linearities in age), and race/ethnicity\n[34]. Race/ethnicity categories are defined as Hispanic\nor white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Asian non-\nHispanic, or other race, non-Hispanic. The Peabody Pic-\nture vocabulary test score is measured on a continuous\nscale, and is standardized so that the mean is approxi-\nmately 100. General health is categorized as excellent,\nvery good, good, or fair/poor. Family structure is cate-\ngorized as two biological parents, single parent house-\nhold, stepfamily or foster/other family. A binary\nindicator indicates whether the adolescent is the first\nborn in the family, and whether the adolescent has a\nbiological mother or father with alcoholism.\nThese equations were analyzed using Stata 10.0. Logit\nmodels were analyzed because the outcome variables of\ninterest were dichotomized, and odds ratios are reported\nin the tables. The research protocol was approved by\nthe University of Chicago Social and Behavioral Sciences\nMissing Observations\nA total of 20,745 students completed the AddHealth in-\nhome interview, and of these, 15,170 followed up at\nWave III. There is thus attrition as well as item non-\nresponse. Item non-response is particularly problematic\nfor the items asked of parents, parental income and\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/5/1/19\nalcoholism. The final sample, with no missing observa-\ntions, was 9,872. Therefore, sample loss is a concern.\nThis was addressed using re-weighting and imputation\nmeasures. Results were qualitatively similar under re-\nweighting and imputation, and so the results presented\nhere use the AddHealth's weights and original sample to\nallow for greater replicability. The full detail is provided\nin Additional file 1.\nResults\nDescriptive Statistics\nTable 1 shows descriptive statistics. In adolescence, the\npercent of households, the highest educated resident\nparent did not complete high school. In about 34 per-\ncent of households, the highest educated resident parent\nhad a college education.\nAbout 25 percent engaged in binge drinking in early\nadulthood (Wave III), about 24 percent engaged in mar-\nijuana use, about 4 percent engaged in cocaine use, one\npercent in crystal methamphetamine use, and about 5\npercent in other drug use.\nRegression Results\nTable 2 shows the regression results examining the\nassociation between SES in adolescence and subsequent\nsubstance use in early adulthood. Higher parental edu-\ncation is associated with higher odds of binge drinking,\nmarijuana use and cocaine use. For an individual with a\ncollege-educated parent, the odds of binge drinking in\nearly adulthood are 1.458 times as large as the odds for\nan individual with a high school-educated parent once\nall controls are included in the model (AOR = 1.458,\ncollege-educated parent, the odds of engaging in mari-\njuana use in early adulthood are 1.265 times as large as\nthe odds for an individual with a high school-educated\nof engaging in cocaine use in early adulthood are 1.614\ntimes as large for an individual with a college-educated\nparent versus a high school-educated parent (AOR =\neffects are found for crystal methamphetamine and\nother drug use.\nTable 3 shows the regression results examining the\nassociation between SES as measured by household\nincome in adolescence and substance use in early adult-\nhood. Higher household income is associated with\nhigher probability of binge drinking and marijuana use.\nAn additional $1000 in annual household income in\nadolescence is associated with an increase of 1.003 in\nthe odds of binge drinking in early adulthood (AOR =\nthis result, while statistically significant, is quite small.\nLikewise, an additional $1000 in annual income in ado-\nlescence is associated with an increase of 1.002 in the\nodds of marijuana use in early adulthood (AOR = 1.002,\nodds of cocaine use, though the results for cocaine use\nlose statistical significance once controls are added\nresults are found for crystal methamphetamine or other\ndrug use.\nSensitivity Analyses\nTables 4 and 5 show sensitivity analyses. Table 4 shows\nthe results when college attendance in young adulthood\n(by Wave III) is included in the model. It should be\nnoted that the prospective nature of the model is vio-\nlated in this sensitivity analysis, as an independent vari-\nable, college attendance, is measured at Wave III, as is\nthe outcome variable. Still, this analysis is useful in\nexamining whether the relationships seen in Tables 2\nand 3 are simply functions of college attendance. It is\npossible that wealthier young adults are more likely to\nattend college, and thus to be living near peers who are\nengaging in substance use, particularly alcohol and mari-\njuana use. College attendance by Wave III is measured\nby enrollment or graduation from a two or four year\ncollege at the Wave III interview.\nThe results show that the relationships seen above are\nrobust to the inclusion of college attendance. Persons\nwith higher parental education (as measured in adoles-\ncence) have a higher probability of binge drinking (joint\nuse (joint test approaching significance at p < 0.10), when\ncontrolling for college attendance. In addition, higher\nhousehold income in adolescence is associated with a\ndance is controlled for. No statistically significant results\nwere found for crystal methamphetamine or other drug\nuse. The results of this sensitivity analysis indicate that\nthe higher rates of binge drinking, marijuana and cocaine\nuse are not solely the result of greater college attendance.\nTable 5 stratifies results by race, white non-Hispanic\nversus non-whites. Although results for white non-His-\npanics are qualitatively similar to the results in Table 2\nfor the whole population, none of the results for the\nnon-whites are statistically significant. This may be a\nfunction of the smaller sample size (n = 5580 for whites\nand n = 4292 for non-whites). It may also be that the\nresults found are being driven primarily by white\nadolescents.\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/5/1/19\nDiscussion\nThe results from this study indicate that higher SES in\nadolescence, as measured by parental education and\nhousehold income in adolescence, is associated with\nhigher rates of substance use, particularly binge drink-\ning, marijuana use and cocaine use, in early adulthood.\nNo statistically significant results were found for crystal\nmethamphetamine or other drug use. Results were\nconsistent when controlling for college attendance by\nyoung adulthood as a sensitivity analysis. When stratify-\ning by race, results were consistent for white non-Hispa-\nnics, but no significant results were found for non-\nwhites. This may be a function of a smaller sample size\nof the non-white sample, or it may be that the results\nare driven primarily by white non-Hispanic respondents.\nIn addition, sensitivity analyses were performed while\nVariable Mean St. Error\nBaseline Variables, Wave I\nHighest educated resident parent has less than high school education 9.40% 1.05%\nOutcome Variables, Wave III\nDescriptive statistics are weighted, cluster and strata corrected.\nhttp://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/5/1/19\nnot controlling for adolescent substance use, and results\nwere qualitatively similar (not shown).\nPrevious literature has shown that the relationships\nbetween SES and substance use vary by age.

This therefore indicates\nthat the behavior of young adults more closely reflects that\nTable 2 The Relationship between Parental Education in Adolescence and Substance Use in Early Adulthood.

The results are also\nconsistent with Bellis and colleagues [10], who found that\nadolescents with more spending money reported greater\nsubstance use and with Martin and colleagues [11], who\nfound that college students with more spending money\nengaged in greater alcohol use. This study provides addi-\ntional evidence for these earlier findings in a longitudinal,\nnationally-representative sample of adolescents in the Uni-\nted States, and in illicit substances in addition to alcohol\nuse. In addition, it is possible that parental education may\nhave a distinct influence on subsequent college attendance\nby the adolescent, distinct from general socioeconomic sta-\ntus. Parents with higher education may have a greater\ninfluence on their adolescent's choice to attend college, as\nthe inter-generational transfer of education has been well-\nestablished in previous literature [34]. It is possible that\nthis college attendance could in turn provide greater\nopportunities for substance use [35]. However, the rela-\ntionships observed in this study were found for both mea-\nsures of SES, parental education and household income,\nindicating that these relationships were consistent across\nmeasures and not limited to parental education.\nSeveral limitations to this study must be noted.\nAddHealth is an observational study, not a randomized\ncontrol trial, thus causality is difficult to establish with cer-\ntainty. However, the longitudinal nature of this analysis\nhelps somewhat to address this issue. Sample loss due to\nattrition and item non-response is also problematic.\nDetails of how this was addressed were discussed in the\nMethods section and in Additional file 1. Additionally, the\noutcome variables measure self-reported substance use,\nrather than clinically-diagnosed substance abuse or depen-\ndence. It should be noted that AddHealth is a nationally-\nrepresentative sample of US secondary school students at\nthe time of data collection, and thus does not capture ado-\nlescents who are not enrolled in school. It also does not\noffer extensive data on early childhood, as data collection\nbegins when participants are in grades 7-12 at Wave I.\nDespite its limitations, the AddHealth data allows for a\nlongitudinal analysis of the relationship between SES in\nadolescence and subsequent substance use in early adult-\nhood. The richness of the AddHealth data allows for the\nconsideration of a number of facets of SES and use of a\nwide range of substances. It also includes a large set of\nindividual, family, school and community characteristics\nassessed at baseline, including substance use and mental\nhealth at baseline. This paper contributes to the under-\nstanding of the relationship between adolescent SES and\nsubsequent substance use, which can help educators, par-\nents and policymakers to identify adolescents who may be\nat risk of substance abuse contemporaneously and in the\nfuture.\nConclusions\nThis study examines the relationship between adolescent\nSES and subsequent substance use in early adulthood.\nThe association varies somewhat by the type of sub-\nstance used. Higher adolescent SES, as measured by\nTable 4 Sensitivity Analysis: The Relationship between Parental Education and Income in Adolescence and Substance\nUse in Early Adulthood, controlling for College Attendance by Wave III (n = 9872)\nBinge Drinking Marijuana Use Cocaine Use Crystal Meth.

No statis-\ntically significant results were found for crystal metham-\nphetamine or other drug use.\nPrevious research has shown that substance use can lead\nto numerous problems for young adults, including difficul-\nties in school, in the labor market, and in the criminal jus-\ntice system. As much of the previous scientific literature\noften focuses on substance abuse in lower SES populations\n[1-5,17-19], it is possible that teachers and school adminis-\ntrators in wealthier schools may be less likely to recognize\nthe need for substance abuse treatment programs, if the\ncurrent policy focus is on lower SES populations. Likewise,\nadministrators of drug abuse prevention programs may be\nless likely to focus their efforts in higher-income areas.\nThis study offers evidence that wealthier students may be\nat risk for substance use problems in the future, particu-\nlarly for binge drinking, marijuana and cocaine use. As pre-\nvious evidence shows that students with more spending\nmoney might be more likely to engage in substance use\ninto adulthood, access to allowances and other forms of\nspending money may be issues that parents can address if\nthey are concerned with the possibility of substance abuse\namong their children. School administrators seeking to\nidentify substance use education policies in their schools\ncan find a listing of programs shown to be effective on the\nwebsite for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)\n[36]. Examining the substance abuse problems facing stu-\ndents with higher SES can help teachers, school adminis-\ntrators, and parents recognize the needs that may be\npresent in their schools and communities, and the need for\nprograms to effectively address substance use.\nAdditional material\nAdditional file 1: Missing Observations Analysis.
