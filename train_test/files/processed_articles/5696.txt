However,\nPTBD is associated with complications such as\nbleeding, cholangitis, and pneumothorax.6,7 The\ncommon practice of temporary external drainage\nalso has an adverse impact on the quality of life\n(QOL) of patients who are already treated for an\nincurable disease. Recently, interventions using\nendoscopic ultrasound (EUS) have been devel-\noped, not only to obtain histopathologic proof of\nmalignancy, but also to achieve biliary drainage.\nEUS-guided biliary drainage (EU-BD), first\nreported by Giovannini et al.,8 broadly includes\nthree different access routes, namely EUS-guided\ntranspapillary rendez-vous,9,10 EUS-guided\ncholedochoduodenostomy11 and EUS-guided\nhepaticogastrostomy [from hereinafter abbrevi-\nated as endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepati-\ncogastrostomy (EU-HGS) in this paper].12\nBecause of guidewire manipulation difficulties,\nthe rendez-vous manoeuver was reported to have\nwith prolonged procedure time and fluoroscopic\ndenostomy is also indicated in case of failed\nERCP, however, this technique cannot always be\nperformed in case of surgically altered anatomy or\nduodenal bulb obstruction. Transduodenal and\ntranshepatogastric access routes are reported to\nhave similar feasibility, but EU-HGS has cur-\nrently the broadest range of indications among\nEU-BD procedures, with a good feasibility in a\nrecent prospective study.19 To date, many case\nreports, small series, retrospective and prospec-\ntive comparisons between the different EU-BD\nmethods have been reported.20 Despite this litera-\nture, no study has specifically compared EU-HGS\nand PTBD in case of failed ERCP for malignant\nobstructive jaundice.\nSince both EU-BD and PTDB are technically\navailable alternatives in case of failed ERCP, it is\nimportant to compare their outcomes in order to\nselect the best option for those patients. Until\nnow, only four small studies21\u00ad24 have compared\nEU-BD and PTBD but studied mostly the trans-\nduodenal route.\nWe thus conducted a retrospective analysis from\ntwo prospectively maintained databases to com-\npare EU-HGS and PTDB after failed ERCP for\nmalignant obstructive jaundice.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nAll therapeutic EU-BD procedures were per-\nformed in Cochin Hospital (Paris, France),\nwhereas all PTBD procedures were performed in\nthe University hospital of Strasbourg. All proce-\ndures and data collection were done after obtain-\ning the patients' informed consent. Information\non patients were retrieved from two similarly con-\nstructed databases prospectively implemented in\neach center.\nWe included all consecutive patients presenting\nwith malignant obstructive jaundice not exceed-\ning Bismuth stage I (i.e. involving only the dis-\ntal bile duct or the upper part of the common\nhepatic duct with no involvement of the main\nconfluence), who underwent EU-HGS or\nPTBD with stent placement after one (or sev-\neral) failed ERCP, as well as patients with pre-\nvious surgery precluding ERCP. All patients\nhad histologically proven malignancy deemed\nunresectable after radiologic assessment (com-\nputerized tomography, EUS, or magnetic reso-\nnance imaging) and multidisciplinary staff\nagreement. Exclusion criteria were resectable,\nborderline or potentially resectable tumors,\nhilar obstruction involving the main conflu-\nence, large-volume ascites, and blood coagula-\ntion disorders. We obtained specific informed\nconsent from each patient in both groups. The\nstudy received IRB approval in both centers.\nStudy endpoints\nData: Patient history, biochemical data at the\ntime of intervention and during follow up, the\nradiological database, procedural records, and\npathological and clinical follow up were reviewed.\nA patient's demographics, histological diagnosis,\nWHO status, procedure details, characteristics\nand reasons for failed ERCP, clinical success,\nA Sportes, M Camus et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tag 485\ntechnical success, adverse events, inpatient length\nof stay, number of reinterventions during follow\nup and survival were recorded. Follow up was\ncontinued until death or date of transfer to a pal-\nliative care center. QOL was not analyzed due to\ninsufficient data.\nOutcomes were defined as follows: Clinical success\nwas defined as a drop in the plasma bilirubin level\nof >50% at 1 week. Technical success was\ndefined as a successful hepatic bile duct puncture\nwith guidewire insertion and stent or drain place-\nment in the desired location as determined endo-\nscopically and/or radiographically. Procedural\nmortality was defined as death occurring within 7\ndays of the procedure. Reinterventions were split\nbetween scheduled reinterventions (for tube\nupsizing/exchange) and unscheduled reinterven-\ntions (for adverse-event management).\nEndpoints: The primary endpoint of the study was\nthe clinical success rate. Secondary endpoints\nwere technical success of the intervention, overall\nsurvival, procedure-related adverse events within\n30 days, number of reinterventions until death\nand length of hospital stay (from the date of pro-\ncedure to discharge).\nProcedures\nAll procedures were performed with monitored\nanesthesia and general anesthesia. Prophylactic\nantibiotics (generally second- or third-generation\ncephalosporin) were administered perioperatively\nin all patients.\nEndoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastros-\ntomy. By using a curved linear array echoendo-\nJapan), access to the left hepatic ducts was identi-\nfied from the proximal gastric body/cardia and\npunctured with a 19-gauge needle (EUSN-19A,\nCook Endoscopy, Winston-Salem, North Caro-\nlina, USA). Color Doppler was used to detect any\nintervening vessel. After suction sampling for bile\nbacteriology analysis, contrast was injected to\nobtain a cholangiogram and a 0.035-inch guide-\nwire (Jagwire, Boston Scientific, Natick, Ma,\nUSA) was advanced into the intrahepatic biliary\nducts. The needle shaft was exchanged over\nthe wire for a 6-French (6 Fr) cystostome (Endo-\nFlex\u00ae, GmbH, Voerde D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany)\nand the needle tract was coagulated using Endo-\nT\u00fcbingen, Germany) before inserting a fully cov-\nered self-expandable metal stent in the left hepatic\nduct (Wallflex RX Permalume\u00ae, Boston Scien-\ntific, Natick, Ma, USA). Usually, at least 2 cm\nfrom the proximal stent end were left in the stom-\nach (Figure 1).When the stent was released in the\ndistal esophagus, it was gently pushed down in\nthe gastric cavity. No additional antegrade trans-\npapillary stent was placed. A Hemostatic clip\n(Instinct, Cook Medical or Resolution, Boston\nScientific, Natick, Ma, USA) was most often used\nin order to secure the stent position and reduce\nthe risk of stent migration. All procedures were\nperformed by one interventional endoscopist\n(FP) with expertise in ERCP and interventional\nEUS (FP: 5-years' experience with EU-BD before\nthe first inclusion in the study, >300 therapeutic\nEUS procedure/years and >1000 ERCPs/year).\nPercutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage.The\nbiliary tree was punctured under ultrasound guid-\nance. Contrast injection was performed to obtain\na cholangiogram. The biliary tree was then cath-\neterized with a guide wire under fluoroscopic\nguidance and a 7 Fr introducer placed at entry of\nthe intrahepatic bile duct. After crossing the\ntumor obstruction, a self-expandable metallic\nstent (Bard E. Luminex Stent 10 mm diameter,\nAngiomed GmbH & Co., Karlsruhe, Germany)\nwas inserted in a one-step procedure. In case of\nimpassable obstruction or poor condition of the\npatient due to infection, an 8 Fr externally locked\ndrain was placed. After 1 week, or if the patient\nimproved, a second attempt of metallic stent\nplacement was performed. In case of lower bile\nduct obstruction, the distal end of the stent was\nplaced across the ampulla in order to ensure max-\nimal biliary drainage and reduce the risk of post-\nprocedure cholangitis. An 8 Fr external drain was\nleft along the PTB track following stent place-\nment and removed 2\u00ad7 days later if the drainage\nfrom the metallic stent was effective. All cases\nwere performed by one interventional radiologist\nwith expertise in interventional radiology (MG:\ndures/year).\nFollow up\nThe patients were followed up after the proce-\ndure, with scheduled visits for clinical assessment\nand laboratory tests. The date of death or date of\ntransfer to the palliative care unit was prospec-\ntively recorded. In case of missing data, medical\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(6)\n486 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nrecords were reviewed and eventually, referring\nphysicians were called on.\nStatistical analysis\nPatient characteristics are expressed as propor-\ntions and median \u00b1 interquartile range.\nAssociation between outcomes (clinical success,\ntechnical success, adverse event) and qualitative\nvariables was determined using Fisher's exact\ntest. Comparison between continuous variables\nwas performed using the Kruskal\u00adWallis test.\nMedian survival times were estimated with their\n95% confidence interval using the Kaplan\u00ad\nMeier's method, and compared between proce-\ndure groups using the log-rank test. A p value <\n0.05 (two sided) was considered significant.\nResults\nCharacteristics\nOut of 3159 ERCP procedures for obstructive\njaundice performed at Cochin Hospital during\nthe study period, 51 (1.6%) had EU-BD per-\nformed for malignant obstructive jaundice after a\nunderwent EU-HGS, 15 (30%) underwent EUS\nrendez-vous and 5 (9%) patients underwent\nEUS-guided choledocoduodenostomy. Only\npatients with EU-HGS were included.\nA total of 214 PTB procedures were performed at\nUniversity Hospital, Strasbourg, for malignant\nbiliary obstruction during the same period. Out of\nthose, 20 patients underwent PTBD after a failed\nERCP. Three patients only had an external drain\nfor poor tumor prognosis (Figure 2).\nfemale 24) with malignant CBD biliary obstruc-\ntion were thus included after either EU-HGS (n\n= 31) or PTBD (n = 20). Patient demographics,\nclinical information and reason for ERCP failure\nwere similar in both groups.

The exact date of death\nwas known in 43 (84%) patients. The date of\ntransfer to a palliative care unit was known for five\n(10%) patients, and only the date of the last visit to\nthe clinic for three patients (6%), in whom it was\napproximated as the presumed date of death (two\nin the EU-HGS group, one in the PTBD group).\nThe overall rate of adverse events was 16% (five\nadverse events) in the EUS-HGS group and 10%\n(two adverse events) in the PTBD group, with no\nstatistical difference between groups as shown in\nMortality at day 7, deemed potentially procedure\nrelated, was 6% (two patients) in the EU-HGS\ngroup (including one severe sepsis at day 1 and a\nmajor bleeding at day 5 from the puncture site)\nand 10% (two patients) in the PTBD group (two\nwith severe sepsis at day 1 and day 3) (Table 2).\nPatients with bile leak required percutaneous\nbiloma drainage.

Interventional\nEUS techniques have only very recently gained\nsome momentum, because devices designed to\ncreate a transparietal tract, manipulate guidewires\nand secure stent positioning have been made\navailable during the last 5\u00ad8 years.\nBoth EU-BD and PTBD are associated with a\nrisk of injury to intervening vessels and additional\nhazards in case of ascites.\nBeside EUS-based techniques, endoscopic\napproaches for pancreatobiliary diseases in\npatients with surgically altered gastrointestinal\nanatomy also include the use of enteroscopy-\nassisted ERCP.

The study concluded\nthat EU-BD offers multiple advantages over ent-\neroscopy-assisted ERCP in patients with surgi-\ncally altered upper gastrointestinal anatomy,\nincluding not only success rates, but also reduced\nprocedural times.\nFour previous studies have compared EU-BD\nand PTBD. Their main results are summarized in\nTable 3. Artifon et al. randomized 25 patients to\nreceive either EUS-guided choledocoduodenos-\ntomy or PTBD21 with clinical and technical suc-\ncess in all patients of both groups. There were no\ndifferences in terms of adverse events between\ngroups.\nTwo retrospective studies by Bapaye22 and\nKhashab23 compared PTBD and EU-BD and\nfound significantly more adverse events after\nPTBD, although clinical success rates were simi-\nlar. Finally, a recently published study by Lee\net al24 compared in a randomized fashion a mix-\nture of EU-CD and EU-HGS procedures versus\nPTBD and found similar clinical results but more\nadverse events after PTBD.\nWe decided to compare only EU-HGS and\nPTBD cases for two reasons: first, EU-HGS is\nthe only technique that allows biliary drainage\nafter surgical bile duct resection or disconnec-\ntion, as long as left hepatic ducts are dilated; sec-\nond, and above all, because EU-HGS shares\nwith PTBD the use of an antegrade transhepatic\nroute, allowing a rather peripheral puncture of\nthe bile ducts.\nIt is generally considered that a randomized con-\ntrolled trial with inclusions for all arms in the same\ncenter is the best methodology when interventions\ncan be achieved with the same level of quality (i.e.\nwhen comparing two drugs or two endoscopic\nprocedures for which endoscopists have the same\nlevel of expertise). However, when comparing\nEUS-guided and percutaneous techniques, it is\nuncommon to find the same level of expertise in\none center for both techniques, since most diffi-\ncult cases are referred to the specialist with the\nbest available expertise (i.e. the radiologist or the\nendoscopist), which can be seen as discouraging\nthe development of the alternative technique.27\nA valid method to avoid skewing a study in favor\nof one technique (arguably in favor of EUS in pre-\nviously published studies) may be the retrospec-\ntive expertise-based study, which may minimize\nbias resulting from differences in technical compe-\ntency and endoscopist's preference, and decrease\ncrossover from one intervention to the other.28\nTable 3.

This study is\ntherefore the first comparing EUS using exclu-\nsively the transgastric approach to the standard\ntechnique of PTBD, both performed by experts,\nwhen ERCP has failed to gain access to the\nobstructed bile duct. No differences were seen in\npreprocedure patient characteristics between the\ntwo study groups and all the patients had unre-\nsectable malignant biliary obstruction. Technical\nsuccess with stent placement in the desired loca-\ntion was successful in all the patients in both\ngroups. A similarly high clinical success rate\nwas achieved in both PTBD and EU-HGS\ngroups, and survival was similar. Furthermore,\nno significant difference was noted with regard\nto procedure-related adverse events. The overall\nPTBD rate of adverse events, lower than in some\nother reports,21,23 can be biased by the perfor-\nmance of all procedures by the same operator with\nexpertise in interventional radiology, but the same\nis true of the EU-HGS group.\nThe only significant difference between EU-HGS\nand PTBD was found to be the overall number of\nreinterventions, which was 10 times lower in the\nEU-HGS group. Our data suggest that EU-HGS\nmay be as effective and safe as the regular PTBD\napproach, with the key advantage of EU-HGS that\nthe procedure can be done during the same session\nas the failed ERCP without the pain and inconven-\nience of an external catheter. EU-HGS also main-\ntains bile within the gastrointestinal tract to ensure\nproper digestion and absorption of nutrients and\navoid compensation for the loss of alkali during\nexternal bile drainage. A major disadvantage of\nPTBD compared with EU-HGS is the need for\nreinterventions, especially when an external drain\nis inserted in the first place. It was a standard oper-\nating procedure for radiologists in our study to\nplace an external or internal\u00adexternal plastic drain\nfor at least 5 days before, and 3 days after metal\nstenting. Single-step PTBD, with immediate self-\nexpanding metal stents (SEMS) stenting and no\nexternal drainage has been reported7 but has also\nbeen associated with significantly more iatrogenic\nevents in septic cases, such as biloma, hemorrhage\nand cholangitis than the three-step procedure\n(prestenting drainage, stent insertion, poststent-\ning drain removal). QOL has not been thor-\noughly assessed in this study, but World Health\nOrganization status was at least equal or better\nshortly after the procedure in all patients with suc-\ncessful EUS-HGS. However, due to the advanced\ncourse of the disease in most patients and their\npoor prognosis, QOL tended to decline in both\ngroups after a few weeks. It seems reasonable to\nestimate that the external biliary drainage, even for\na limited period of time, is a significant hindrance\nto the rapid QOL improvement that is expected\nafter those palliative procedures. A limitation of\nEU-HGS procedure is the left lobar access route,\nwhich can be inadequate or insufficient in patients\nwith advanced hilar obstruction.29 Complex hilar\nobstruction was excluded from the present study,\nand we are now investigating the value of EU-HGS\nin such patients.\nAnother impediment to the development of\nEU-HGS procedure is that expertise in interven-\ntional EUS is not widespread, whereas PTBD\ncan be performed by most interventional radiol-\nogists and is routinely available in more centers\nthan interventional EUS. The overall rate of\nadverse events in the EUS-HGS group is con-\nsistent with recent studies and illustrates the\nrelatively good safety profile of EU-BD com-\npared with ERCP, as shown by one recent study\ncomparing the clinical efficacy and safety of\nEU-BD and ERCP for patients with distal malig-\nnant biliary obstruction.30\nFinally, despite these limitations and a relatively\nsmall sample size, the strengths of this study, sim-\nilar patients in both groups, homogeneity of tech-\nniques with only one expert involved in each\ngroup, full survival follow up, suggest that\nEU-HGS is an effective and safe technique and\nmay provide endoscopists with an additional\nalternative biliary drainage method when ERCP\nis precluded or unsuccessful. Larger multicenter,\nrandomized trials would be welcome to establish\nthe therapeutic and safety profiles of the EU-HGS\nprocedure before this technique is accepted as a\nstandard option.\nConclusion\nEU-HGS is an effective and safe minimally\ninvasive procedure alternative to PTBD with\nsimilar success and adverse event rates.\nHowever, EU-HGS is associated with a lower\nnumber of reinterventions and a shorter hospital\nstay. Our results suggest that EU-HGS can be a\ntechnique of choice after unsuccessful ERCP at\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(6)\n492 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\ninstitutions with experienced interventional\nendosonographers.\nAuthor's contributions\nA.
