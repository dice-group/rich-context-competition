    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe aim of this research was to analyze the inconsistency in responses to survey questions within the Health and Retirement\nStudy (HRS) regarding insurance coverage of dental services. Self-reports of dental coverage in the dental services section\nwere compared with those in the insurance section of the 2002 HRS to identify inconsistent responses. Logistic regression\nidentified characteristics of persons reporting discrepancies and assessed the effect of measurement error on dental coverage\ncoefficient estimates in dental utilization models. In 18% of cases, data reported in the insurance section contradicted data\nreported in the dental use section of the HRS by those who said insurance at least partially covered (or would have covered)\ntheir (hypothetical) dental use. Additional findings included distinct characteristics of persons with potential reporting errors\nand a downward bias to the regression coefficient for coverage in a dental use model without controls for inconsistent self-\nreports of coverage. This study offers evidence for the need to validate self-reports of dental insurance coverage among a\nsurvey population of older Americans to obtain more accurate estimates of coverage and its impact on dental utilization.\n",

Response\nvariance is only one example of measurement errors in sur-\nveys.1 The presence of measurement error from inconsistent\nor unreliable reporting of the explanatory variables in a\nregression model poses estimation problems that may cause\npotentially downward biased, inconsistent estimates of the\nregression coefficients.2,3\nPrevious studies have addressed disagreements between\nsurvey measurements of public and private health insurance\ncoverage from alternate sources for nonelderly populations.\nBlack et al estimated a 34% downward bias in a wage growth\nmodel for the health insurance coefficient from using\nemployee reports of group health insurance coverage instead\nof the 79% of employee responses that agreed with the\nemployer verification of coverage status.4 Hill used up to\nfour sources of data including insurance cards, policy book-\nlets, medical providers, and employers and insurance compa-\nnies, to verify self-reports of health insurance coverage status\nExpenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).5 Call et al estimated\nfrom the 2004 Medicaid Undercounts Experiments (MUE)\ndata that between 13% and 20% of surveyed known Medicaid\nbeneficiaries across three states reported no Medicaid cover-\nage at all while 3% to 13% of them in these states reported no\ncoverage from any source.6\nCafferata verified 70.9% of self-reports of dental service\ncoverage by elderly household members 65 and older\nagainst policy documentation collected from employers\nand insurance providers in the 1977 National Medical Care\nExpenditure Survey (NMCES). Of the 8.8% self-reporting\ndental coverage in the household survey, 40% lacked vali-\ndated coverage. Correct household survey responses were\n(1) correlated positively with household income and nega-\ntively with a person's age, and (2) were more prevalent\namong whites than non-whites and among those with\nMedicare and private insurance than other medical insurance\ncoverage.7\n1University of Maryland School of Dentistry, Baltimore, USA\n2University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, USA\n3RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA, USA\n4University of Virginia, Charlottesville, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nA longitudinal survey of older Americans over 50 years of\nage was used in our study to identify response inconsistency\nto survey questions regarding insurance coverage of dental\nservices. In each of four recent waves of the survey adminis-\nwere asked about dental coverage associated with their use\nof dental services. Those who did not use dental services\nwere queried as to whether services would have been cov-\nered by insurance. In Wave 6 covering the survey period\ntion of the survey if they had any dental insurance. Recent\nstudies of dental use and coverage using these data relied\nsolely on questions regarding dental coverage available only\nin the dental use section of the survey.8-14 Our preliminary\nestimates showed disproportionately higher rates of cover-\nage than expected among certain population subgroups of\nnon-users of dental services in the data used for these studies.\nThis suggested that certain groups of older Americans might\nmistakenly believe that Medicare covered dental services.\nHowever, Medicare does not routinely cover dental care with\nthe exception of a small but growing percentage of beneficia-\nries in Medicare Advantage programs who may or may not\nIn our study, persons with response inconsistencies and\ntheir personal characteristics are identified, and the impact of\nestimates of dental coverage on the likelihood of dental use\nwith and without controls for potential errors in measuring\ndental coverage is analyzed. Response errors in reporting\ndental coverage are hypothesized as follows: (1) to not be\nequally distributed across population groups, (2) to be higher\namong non-users of dental services, and (3) to deflate esti-\nmates of dental coverage in dental use regression models.\nMethods\nThe Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a nationally rep-\nresentative longitudinal household survey in the United\nStates that collects self-reported data from interviews with\nindividuals over age 50 and their spouses every 2 years. We\nuse the 2002 (Wave 6) installment of the HRS for our study\ncontaining 18 469 sampled individuals. Administered by the\nInstitute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of\nMichigan and sponsored by the National Institute on Aging,\nthe HRS is useful for the study of aging, retirement, and\nhealth among older populations in the United States.19,20\nEach respondent is asked a large battery of questions includ-\ning information about demographics; income and assets;\nphysical and mental health; cognition, family structure, and\nsocial supports; health care utilization and costs; health\ninsurance coverage; labor force status and job history; and\nretirement planning and expectations. Because of the breadth\nof data available across health and labor force measures and\nthe large sample of older Americans, the HRS is an excellent\ndata source for assessing the association between dental cov-\nerage, use, and retirement among an older population.\nThis analysis focuses on the consistency of self-reported\ndental insurance coverage in the HRS. In 2002, dental cover-\nage was determined in the survey three possible ways: (1)\nPersons who visited the dentist for dental care at least once\nduring the 2-year period prior to the survey were classified as\ncovered if they reported that their expenses were covered\ncompletely, mostly, or partially by insurance; (2) persons not\nvisiting the dentist were considered to have dental coverage\nif they reported that insurance would have covered any of\ntheir expenses had they visited the dentist; and (3) finally, in\nthe insurance section of the questionnaire, all persons were\nasked directly whether they had any insurance covering den-\ntal bills. Those answering yes were asked if they had cover-\nage from one of the plans previously described or a different\nplan. If using a previous plan, they were asked to identify\nwhich plan.\nWe identify persons with inconsistent reports of dental\ncoverage in Wave 6 as those who reported having coverage\nin (1) or (2) above but not having coverage in (3) above.\nPersons reporting coverage in (1) or (2) but reporting dental\ncoverage from Medicare in (3) are also classified as inconsis-\ntent cases, although any persons in Medicare Advantage\nplans offering dental coverage could potentially be misclas-\nsified as inconsistent cases. Persons reporting coverage in (2)\nbut who were unable to answer the direct insurance question\nin (3) or questions regarding the plan or type of plan offering\nthem coverage are also classified as inconsistent cases.\nPersons reporting no dental coverage by either (1) or (2) who\nreported dental coverage in (3) from a private plan, Medicaid,\nChampus, a previous plan not on the list, or a different plan\nnot previously mentioned are also classified as inconsistent\ncases.\nSurvey respondents are designated as fully retired if at the\ntime of the survey interview they were not working for pay\nor self-employed and either (1) said that they were com-\npletely retired or (2) reported their sole employment status as\nretired. Individuals are classified as partially retired if they\nwere not fully retired but report retirement and either work-\ning or looking for work. Individuals not classified as fully or\npartly retired are designated as in the labor force if they\nreport working for pay or report their labor force status as\nworking full-time, part-time, or unemployed. Persons are\nclassified as not retired and out of the labor force if they\nreport being disabled, not in the labor force or never in the\nlabor force.\nThe wealth measure we use is the total net value of wealth\nincluding the net value of any secondary residence owned by\nthe household. The HRS collects data on separate compo-\nnents of wealth and debt and then sums them to produce a\ntotal net value of wealth. Responses are bracketed for cases\nin which respondents cannot provide exact data to improve\nWe calculate Z tests for the differences between mean per-\ncentages reporting consistent and inconsistent dental cover-\nage for specific population subgroups defined by selected\nMoeller et al 3\nindividual and household characteristics. We also estimate a\nlogistic regression model of the likelihood of inconsistently\nreporting dental coverage as a function of these same person-\nlevel and household characteristics. Finally, we estimate\nseparate logistic models of dental service use with and with-\nout controls for inconsistent reporting of dental coverage and\nwith controls for other potentially confounding variables\nincluding age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status,\nhousehold size, health status, body mass index, household\nincome, household wealth, Census region, and retirement/\nlabor force status.\nThe HRS core sample design is a multistage area proba-\nbility sample of households, so all estimates and statistics\nreported were computed taking into account this design with\nthe use of the software packages SUDAAN and STATA.23,24\nUnless otherwise stated, all reported results are significant at\nResults\nInconsistent Cases\nIn Table 1, we show for Wave 6 how we classified persons\nreporting their dental coverage status in the dental use sec-\ntion of the survey as consistent or inconsistent reporting\nbased on their responses in the insurance section of the\nsurvey.\nreporting coverage in the dental use section were classified\nas inconsistent cases. The inconsistent rates for those report-\ning coverage were higher for those non-users answering\npositively to the hypothetical coverage question (30%) com-\npared with users saying that dental insurance at least partially\ncovered their dental services (14%). One-fifth of all incon-\nsistently reported dental coverage cases reported Medicare\nas their coverage source with a slightly higher rate reported\namong non-users (23%) than users (17%) of dental services.\nOf the 10 013 reporting no dental coverage in the dental use\nsection of the survey, only 241 or 2.4% reported contradic-\ntory responses in the insurance section.\nPersonal Characteristics\nTables 2 and 3 highlight the personal and household attri-\nbutes distinguishing persons reporting dental coverage con-\nsistently in each section of the survey from those who report\ncontradictory information in the two sections of the survey.\nIn Table 2, comparisons are made between consistent and\ninconsistent reporters of dental coverage across covariates,\nwhereas in Table 3, logistic regression estimates of charac-\nteristics of inconsistent reporters are provided that were\nadjusted by controls for other covariates.\nUnadjusted results. In Table 2, persons reporting dental cover-\nage inconsistently can be generally characterized as aged 65\nto 69; Hispanic or black, non-Hispanic; not a high school\ngraduate; not married; in fair or poor health; living in poor,\nlow income, lowest wealth households not of size 2; and fully\nretired with a relatively high number of chronic conditions.\nThey are also characterized as persons with a relatively high\nnumber of difficulties with activities of daily living (ADLs).\nAdjusted results.The logistic regression results in Table 3\nconfirm that persons reporting dental coverage inconsis-\ntently are more likely to be black, non-Hispanic than white,\nnon-Hispanic; fully retired, partly retired, or not retired and\nnot in the labor force than not retired and in the labor force;\nliving in households not in the highest wealth decile; and\nhaving more rather than fewer difficulties with ADLs. We\nalso found them more likely to be aged 65 to 69 than under\nage 65; other, non-Hispanic than white, non-Hispanic;\ndivorced, separated, or never married than married; and liv-\ning in the northeast Census region rather than in the southern\nregion. Influences of education, household size and income,\nand health status and number of chronic conditions from the\nunadjusted results were not found after controls were intro-\nduced in the logistic regressions.\nDental Use\nIn Table 4, we show the influence of controlling for inconsis-\ntent reporting of dental coverage on coefficient estimates of\ndental coverage in logistic regressions of the likelihood of\ndental use.\nBaseline estimates without controls.We first ran the model\nwith no controls for quality of reporting coverage. Coverage\nis based on responses to the dental use questions in the sur-\nvey as defined in (1) and (2) in the Methods section. Next we\nran the same model only dropping the 1352 persons we clas-\nsified as having potential measurement error in reporting\ncoverage. Not unexpectedly, the logistic coefficient and the\npoint estimate of the adjusted odds ratio for dental coverage\nboth increased after dropping sample observations with\npotential measurement error.\nWith controls for quality of reporting.We next estimated the\ndental use model with the full sample and including controls\nfor the potential measurement error in reporting coverage or\nno coverage in the dental use section of the survey. We ran\nthe model twice. In the first case, the reference group con-\ntained persons reporting coverage in the dental use section\ncontradicted by their responses in the insurance section. In\nthis model, those reporting dental coverage without error are\nmore likely to use dental care than those reporting coverage\nwith error. Those reporting no coverage without error are less\nlikely to use dental care than those reporting coverage with\nerror. Those persons reporting no dental coverage in the den-\ntal use section and conflicting data in the insurance section\nare no more likely to use dental care than the reference group.\nIn the second case, we ran the same model and we speci-\nfied only persons reporting lack of dental coverage without\nevidence of measurement error as the reference group.\nNotably in this model, the estimated impact of dental cover-\nage on the likelihood of dental use for those reporting with-\nout potential measurement error is similar in magnitude to\nthat of the baseline case with potential measurement error\ncases removed from the regression. Both cases show over a\n10% downward bias from response error (ie, a coefficient of\n.83 in the error-prone models as compared with .95 or .93 in\nthe models that control for inconsistent responses). We also\nfind that persons reporting dental coverage in one section of\nthe survey but not the other are also more likely to use dental\ncare than those reporting lack of dental coverage in both\nsections. This positive effect of \"half-reported\" dental cov-\nerage on dental use from above is less than the impact of\nTable 1.

The latter result was confirmed in a separate regression\nnot shown in Table 4 with persons reporting no coverage in\nthe use section and coverage in the insurance section as the\nreference group.\nDiscussion\nIn summary, our study estimated an 18% rate of inconsistent\nreporting by persons reporting dental coverage in the dental\nuse section of the Wave 6 2002 HRS. The rate was consider-\nably higher among non-users of dental services (30%) in\nresponse to a hypothetical question regarding coverage if\nservices had been used compared with users of dental ser-\nvices who said that dental insurance had at least partially\ncovered their dental care (14%). We also found distinct char-\nacteristics of persons more likely to provide potentially erro-\nneous coverage status based on their retirement, wealth,\nhealth, and marital status as well as their race/ethnicity.\nThese individuals are characterized as black or other non-\nHispanics; not in the labor force; aged 65 to 69; never mar-\nried, divorced, or separated; with higher numbers of\ndifficulties with ADLs, living in households in the Northeast\nMoeller et al 9\nCensus region, and with relatively low levels of household\nwealth. Finally, estimates of the effect of dental coverage on\nthe likelihood of dental use were deflated by as much as 13%\nwithout controlling for potential response errors.\nAlthough not reported in our study, we also analyzed\ninconsistent reporting of dental coverage in Wave 10 of the\ninsurance data were collected in the insurance section the\nsame as was done in Wave 6.25,26 However, the hypothetical\nquestion regarding coverage for non-users was no longer\nasked in the dental use section of Wave 10. Therefore, we\nwere unable to estimate dental use models as in Table 4\nbecause we only had inconsistent reports by dental users. We\ndid find that the inconsistent reporting rate for dental users\nfrom Wave 10 (16%) was comparable with our finding from\nOur study is limited because we did not have a validation\nmeasure of dental coverage. Instead we relied solely on self-\nreports to measure response errors (ie, reliability) rather than\nverified proof from policy booklets or follow-back surveys\nof insurance providers (ie, the validity of the responses). As\nsuch, our 14% to 16% inconsistent rate for self-reports of\ndental coverage by 2002 HRS dental users is not strictly\ncomparable with the 40% invalidation rate from the afore-\nmentioned 1977 NMCES study and could be even higher\nwith similar validation.7 Apart from the considerably lower\nrate of self-reported dental coverage by the elderly in the\nNMCES sample (8.8%) compared with our HRS sample\n(38%), our studies also differed by the inclusion of near-\nelderly persons aged 55 to 64 in our study.\nWe note that our measure of inconsistent reporting is not\nwithout error. We may have misclassified cases in which a\nperson may have coverage for a subset of procedures but not\nfor the dental services provided during the survey period (ie,\nreported no coverage associated with use but dental coverage\nin the insurance section of the survey and therefore was iden-\ntified as a false \"no coverage\"). We assumed that those\nreporting Medicare as their dental coverage source did not\nrealize that their coverage does not include dental benefits,\nyet some of them may in fact have been in a Medicare\nAdvantage plan that does cover dental services (resulting in\nfalsely labeling some portion of the 20% of individuals\nreporting Medicare as their dental insurance source as incon-\nof Medicare beneficiaries were in these plans.15\nThe findings suggest that, as in the previous literature,2\nthe presence of measurement error among right-hand side\nvariables results in the attenuation of coefficients in regres-\nsion models. While we can only speculate on which responses\nare correct among those who are inconsistent, we suspect\nthat the question wording related to coverage associated with\ndental use may inflate the assertion of coverage. The ques-\ntion wording asks, \"Were your dental expenses completely\ncovered by health insurance, mostly covered, only partially\ncovered, or not covered at all by insurance?\" Although the\nwording includes \"not covered at all\" as a response choice,\nTable 4.
