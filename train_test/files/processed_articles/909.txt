Wilmoth, PhD1\nThe Relationship Between Living\nArrangements and Age\nDuring the last 20 years a considerable amount of\nresearch on living arrangements among older adults\nhas been presented in journals that address aging\nissues. A variety of studies in this area use cross-\nsectional data to document trends in the distribution\nof living arrangements among the older population\nand to identify the factors that determine living ar-\nrangements (Avery, Speare, & Lawton, 1989; Burr &\n& Angel, 1990a). With the increased availability of\nnationally representative longitudinal data sets, re-\nsearch has begun to describe changes in living arrange-\nments over time (Mutchler & Burr, 1991; Speare, Avery,\nStudies demonstrate that the relationship between\nage and living arrangements at one point in time is\ndistinct from the relationship between age and living\narrangement transitions that occur over time. For ex-\nample, even though there is a positive relationship be-\ntween age and living alone among unmarried women,\nthe probability of experiencing a transition into living\nSupport for this research was provided by a National Institute on Aging\nPredoctoral Fellowship in Adult Development and Aging awarded to the\nauthor through the Gerontology Center, The Pennsylvania State Univer-\nAnthropology at Purdue University.

Despite\nthis distinction, our understanding of the relationship\nbetween living arrangement transitions and age is not\ncomplete due to data limitations.\nPrevious studies that used longitudinal data often\nemployed a restrictive analysis strategy because of data\nlimitations (e.g., Jackson, Longino, Zimmerman, & Brad-\nstrategy involves coding individuals who are in differ-\nent living arrangements at subsequent interviews as\nexperiencing an event and then using logistic re-\ngression to model the influence of various respondent\ncharacteristics on the likelihood of living arrangement\nchange. This approach, while providing some insight\ninto the determinants of living arrangement changes,\nhas some important limitations.\nFirst, a respondent could have experienced a living\narrangement change between the two interview dates\nthat is not included in the analysis because the re-\nspondent moved back into his or her original state\nprior to the end of the observation period. Another\nproblem is the respondent could have experienced\nseveral transitions during the period but only the dif-\nference between the beginning state and the end-\ning state is modeled. This is problematic because the\nchanges being modeled are not an accurate represen-\ntation of the transition process. Finally, little informa-\ntion is gained about the transition process itself from\nthis methodological approach. We still do not know\nhow long it tates respondents to experience living\narrangement transitions or how this process varies with\nage-\nFurthermore, many of these studies focus only on\nunmarried women (e.g., Mutchler, 1992; Soldo et al.,\nreasons. While the majority of the older population\nlives with a spouse, married couple households are\noften excluded because there is little variation in the\nbaseline living arrangements of this group--the ma-\njority of married individuals live with a spouse. Simi-\nlarly, men tend to be excluded from living arrange-\nment research because they are more likely to be mar-\nried and living with a spouse due to sex differences in\nmortality. In contrast to married individuals and men,\nthe living arrangements of unmarried women have\ngreater variability. Older women are more likely than\nmen to be living alone, with relatives, or in an institu-\ntion (Siegel, 1993). In addition, unmarried women, par-\nticularly those living alone, are of concern in terms of\npolicy because they are at risk of needing more in-\nformal and formal assistance. Although focusing on un-\nmarried women is justified, excluding married couples\nand men has curbed our understanding of living\narrangement transitions for the entire older adult\npopulation and limited our ability to provide the gen-\neralizations that may inform policy.\nThis research addresses the methodological and\nsample limitations of previous research by examining\nliving arrangements from a dynamic perspective that\nuses event history methods to describe the transition\nprocess among the entire older adult population. The\npurpose of this study is to expand upon our current\nknowledge concerning living arrangements among\nolder adults by providing more detailed information\nabout the living arrangement transition process and\nhow that process varies over the latter part of the life\ncourse. The goal is to provide a more complete de-\nscription of living arrangement changes in later life that\ncan inform individual and policy decision making.\nUsing data from the National Survey of Families\nand Households (NSFH) this research specifies the\nstochastic nature of living arrangements by tracking\nindividual changes in living arrangements on a month-\nto-month basis. The monthly information is used to\ncreate event history files that document the first tran-\nsition from a living arrangement by age and to calcu-\nlate age-specific transition rates. The transition rates\nare then used to construct multiple-decrement life\ntables for four living arrangement categories: living\nalone, living with a spouse, living with a child, and\nliving with a spouse and child.\nThe multiple-decrement life tables provide answers\nto research questions concerning living arrangement\ntransitions that, until this point, have not been ad-\ndressed. More specifically, this research addresses the\nfollowing questions:\n1. How likely is it that an older person in a par-\nticular living arrangement will make a transition to\nanother type of living arrangement?\n2. How are living arrangement transitions related\nto age and distributed over the latter part of the life\ncourse? Similarly, what is the pace of these transitions?\n3. How long can an individual expect to live in a\nparticular living arrangement before experiencing a liv-\ning arrangement change?\nProviding answers to these questions can inform\nindividual and policy decision making by providing\ninsight into the stability of particular later life living\narrangements and the predictability of specific living\narrangement transitions. In this study, stability depends\nupon the overall likelihood of a living arrangement\ntransition at a given age. A living arrangement is stable\nwhen the chance of a transition is low and an indi-\nvidual can expect to remain in that current living\narrangement for several years before experiencing a\nchange. Predictability, on the other hand, refers to the\ndegree to which an individual can expect a specific\ntype of living arrangement transition, given his or her\ncurrent living arrangement and age. If an individual\ncan expect to experience a specific type of living\narrangement change at a given age (e.g., moving from\nliving with a spouse to living alone, or from living alone\nto an institution), then that transition is predictable.\nKnow-ing the stability of a living arrangement, as well\nas the most likely type of transition to be experienced\nat a given age, enables individuals to prepare for the\nevents that are likely to occur during later life and\nassists policy makers, as well as service providers, in\ndeveloping and implementing programs that are tai-\nlored to meet older adults' needs.\nMethods\nData Source and Living Arrangement\nTransition Measures\nThis analysis uses data from the first and second\nwaves of the National Survey of Families and House-\ntionally representative sample of 13,017 respondents\naged 19 and older living in U.S. households. The ini-\npresent analysis is based upon the 3,339 reinter-\nviewed respondents who were age 55 or older dur-\ning the first interview, as well as the respondents who\nand second interviews. While most studies of older\nadults' living arrangements use subjects that are age\n65 and older, expanding the age range to 55 and\nolder enables this research to address transition issues\namong the pre- and early retirement age population.\nIt should be noted that there are 630 subjects who\nwere not reinterviewed and therefore are not included\nin this analysis. This attrition is a cause for concern\nbecause of the potential for dependency between the\nattrition mechanism and changes in living arrange-\nments. To account for this potential dependency, an\nattrition variable was created by first estimating a\nlogistic regression model predicting attrition (0 = rein-\nterviewed respondents, 1 = respondents not reinter-\nviewed). Then the coefficients for sex, race, educa-\ntion, and self-rated health from this model were used\nto create an attrition control variable that is included\nin all of the models used in this analysis (Heckman,\nA unique feature of the NSFH data is that dates of\nchanges in marital status, living with children, institu-\ntionalization, and death are coded in century months.\nThe household composition items from the initial\nsurvey are used to determine baseline living arrange-\nments and then the items that measure changes in\nmarital status and living with children in the follow-up\nsurvey are used to determine monthly changes in liv-\ning arrangements. Together these items are used to\nconstruct an event history file that tracks first transi-\ntions out of the following living arrangement cate-\ngories: living alone, living with a spouse, living with a\nchild, and living with a spouse and child. Overall, 1,038\nrespondents are coded as experiencing a change\nin living arrangements at age 55 and older. The num-\nber of respondents experiencing destination-specific\ntransitions is shown in Table 1. It is the experience\nof these respondents that is modeled in the hazard\nanalysis and multiple-decrement life tables, which are\ndiscussed below.\nFor the majority (97%) of the participants that ex-\nperience a transition to living with a child, it is impos-\nsible to determine whether the respondent moved\ninto a child's household or a child moved into the\nrespondent's household. This is primarily due to the\nway the follow-up data were collected. The only spe-\ncific questions about a respondent moving into a\nchild's household are on the proxy interview. No dis-\ntinction is made between a child moving into the\nrespondent's household and the respondent moving\ninto a child's household during the respondent rein-\nterview. The question wording implies that the child\nis moving into the respondent's household, but it is\nnot possible to verify this information. Similarly, it cannot\nbe determined whether transitions from living with a\nchild to living alone involved the child or the respon-\ndent moving. Given these data limitations the results\nonly discuss transitions involving children in terms of\ncoresidence.\nAnalysis\nThe analysis uses a Markov-based approach in which\nliving arrangement transitions are conceptualized as\na process in which individuals are in one of several\nmutually exclusive and exhaustive states at any given\npoint in time. Over time individuals move between\nthese four different living arrangement states in addi-\ntion to experiencing institutionalization or death. This\nmovement between states creates a history of living\narrangement transitions (or nontransitions for cases in\nwhich no change in living arrangements occurs). Al-\nthough individuals potentially can make multiple tran-\nsitions, this analysis focuses on the first transition out\nof the baseline living arrangement. The analysis fo-\ncuses on first transitions because the primary goal\nof this article is to explore the relationship between\nliving arrangement changes and age, as well as to iden-\ntify the length of time an individual can expect to live\nin a particular living arrangement before experiencing\na transition.\nLiving arrangement transitions are modeled by\nconstructing multiple-decrement life tables that are\nbased upon age-specific hazard rates. These estimated\nhazard rates are a function of the baseline hazard\nrate, age, and a vector of control variables where\n= Bo\n+ B^Age B,Xr\nIn this equation the constant Bo\nrepresents the baseline\nhazard function, B, represents the effect of age, and\nB. represents several control variables including gen-\nder (female vs male), race (White vs non-White), edu-\ncation (some college or more vs high school or less),\nfunctional limitations (scale of 0 to 1 that measures six\ntasks including conditions that limit the ability to care\nfor personal needs, move around the house, perform\nday-to-day tasks, climb a flight of stairs, and walk six\nblocks), and number of children. These control vari-\nables are included in the hazard model because each\nof these factors has been shown to be significantly\nrelated to living arrangements in previous research\n& Angel, 1990b). Although this article does not pre-\nsent the coefficients for these control variables, includ-\ning the controls in the hazard models is essential for\nmodel specification; it ensures that the age-specific\nhazard rates obtained from the models are not affected\nby other individual characteristics that are related to\nchanges in living arrangements. For this analysis the\nage-specific hazard rates are estimated using the Proc\nLifereg procedure in SAS.\nAlthough Equation 1 only allows for age to have a\nlinear effect, other functional forms of time can be\nTable 1.

Models (not shown) were tested that in-\ncluded various functional forms of time (i.e., age, age2).\nThe appropriate functional form for the relationship\nbetween the unobserved hazard rate and time was\ndetermined by comparing the Wald chi-square sta-\ntistics across the models. The best fitting models were\nused to calculate the age-specific transition rates that\nare the basis of the multiple-decrement life tables.\nUsing the hazard model with the most appropriate\nfunctional form for time, age-specific hazards rates are\nobtained by the following formula:\nh(x) = EXP{-[B0\n. \u00b7 . + Bi\n(Controli\nThese age-specific hazards rates are then applied to\na synthetic life table cohort, which identifies the ex-\npected living arrangement transitions across the latter\npart of the life course given current age-specific tran-\nsition rates. Multiple-decrement life tables are con-\nstructed for each of the following baseline living\narrangements: living alone, with spouse, with child, with\nspouse and child (see Schoen, 1988, for a discussion\nof multiple-decrement life tables). In addition to mod-\neling transitions between these living arrangements,\nthe life tables also model transitions into an institution\nor death.\nThe results in the following section use graphs and\ntables to summarize the detailed information pro-\nvided by the multiple-decrement life tables. The dis-\ncussion focuses on the life table survivor functions, the\noverall transition probabilities, the expected number\nPercent\nSurviving\nof years until a living arrangement transition, the age-\nspecific transitions rates, and the percent distribution\nof decrements at selected ages.\nResults\nGeneral Patterns in Living\nArrangement Transitions\nThe life table models subject a hypothetical cohort\narrangement transitions rates. Figure 1 is based on the\nsurvivorship function, or l(x) column, in each life table.\nThis function provides information on the number of\npeople in the hypothetical cohort who have not ex-\nperienced a transition out of the designated living\narrangement by a given age. In other words, these\npeople have \"survived\" to a particular age without\nexperiencing a living arrangement change. Mathe-\nmatically, the number of people who \"survived\" to\nagex\nwithout a living arrangement change is equal to\nthe number of people at age*-i minus the number of\npeople who experience a living arrangement change\nwhile age*-i.\nTo facilitate the interpretation, Figure 1 graphically\npresents the percentage of the synthetic cohort that\nhas not experienced a living arrangement transition at\neach successive age. In other words, it indicates the\npercentage of the initial population that continues to\nbe in that living arrangement at a given age. As the\ncurve of the lines indicates, there is a steady decline\nAlone\nWith Spouse\nWith Child\nWith Spouse and Child\nAge\nNote: Controlling for gender, race, education, functional limitations, self-rated health, number of children, and attrition.\nFigure 1.

The decline in the percentage of\nindividuals living with a child is more rapid, and indi-\nviduals living with a spouse and child experience the\nmost rapid pace of living arrangement change.\nAdditional insight into the transition process can be\ngained from examining the age-specific transition prob-\nabilities for each living arrangement category shown\nin Figure 2. These transition probabilities are derived\nfrom the age-specific hazard rates that were used to\nconstruct each life table. Although there are some\ndifferences across the living arrangement categories,\nthe most striking characteristic of Figure 2 is that the\nprobability of experiencing a transition is relatively low\nfor all groups until age 75, when it begins to steadily\nincrease. Prior to age 65 the probability of making a\ntransition is slightly higher for those living with a child\nor with a spouse and child. At these oldest ages, the\nprobability of experiencing a transition is highest for\nindividuals living with a spouse and child, followed by\nthose living alone, with a spouse, and with a child\nrespectively.\nTable 2 presents additional information concerning\nthe pace at which living arrangement changes occur\nduring later life. These values are based on the e(x)\ncolumn in each life table, which is derived from the\ntotal number of years spent in a particular living ar-\nrangement at and above a given age (i.e., the T{x)\nfunction) and the survivorship function (i.e., /(x)). The\ne(x) function provides information on the number of\nyears, on average, an individual can expect to live in\nTable 2.

For example, at age 55\nindividuals living alone can expect, on average, twenty\nyears before a change in living arrangements.\nThe expected number of years of living alone de-\nclines steadily with age. The pattern of expected num-\nber of years before the first living arrangement transi-\ntion for individuals living with a spouse is very similar\nto the pattern for those living alone, although the ini-\ntial expectancy is lower. This similarity between indi-\nviduals living alone and living with a spouse is due to\nthe fact that exits from both living arrangements are\nusually driven by mortality and institutionalization.\nAlthough a large proportion of individuals living with\na child experience a relatively rapid exit from that\nProbability\nAlone\nWith Spouse\nWith Child\nWith Spouse and Child\nNote: Controlling for gender, race, education, functional limitations, self-rated health, number of children, and attrition.\nFigure 2.

In fact,\nat age 65 and older individuals living with a child\nremain in that living arrangement a longer period\nof time, on average, than individuals in other living\narrangements. In contrast, individuals living with a\nspouse and child change living arrangements the quick-\nest, therefore the expected number of years until a\ntransition is relatively low.\nWhile Figures 1 and 2, as well as Table 2, summa-\nrize the overall transition trends for each living ar-\nrangement category, they do not provide any infor-\nmation regarding the distribution of specific transition\ntypes within each living arrangement category. The\nfollowing analysis will examine transitions from each\nliving arrangement separately and discuss the similari-\nties across the living arrangement categories.\nDestination-Specific Transition Patterns\nWithin Each Living Arrangement Category\nLiving Alone.--There are four paths through which\nan individual living alone can change living arrange-\nments: by getting married, coresiding with a child,\nmoving into an institution, or dying. As the curve of\nthe line in Figure 3 indicates, the destination-specific\ntransition rates for movements from living alone to liv-\ning with a spouse are concentrated at the younger\nages and decline with age, although the overall rates\nare relatively low. The first panel of Table 3, which\npresents the percent distribution of transitions, shows\nthat at age 55 only 6% of the transitions from living\nalone are to living with a spouse and that this per-\ncentage declines steadily with age. Transition rates for\nmovement to coresidence with a child also decline\nwith age. At age 55 almost two thirds (65%) of the\ntransitions from living alone are to living with a child.\nAfter age 80 it is unlikely that an individual will exit\nliving alone by getting married, although there is a\nslight chance that an individual will coreside with a\nchild. Less than 6% of the transitions at age 85 are\naccounted for by coresidential moves. It is only at the\nyoungest ages (prior to age 65) that individuals living\nalone are most likely to start living with a child.\nAs anticipated, there is a positive relationship be-\ntween age and transitions due to institutionalization\nand death for individuals living alone. Institutionaliza-\ntion and death are the predominate paths through\nwhich individuals exit living alone after age 62. Only\n29% of the transitions at age 55 are due to death or\ninstitutionalization, but by age 85 almost all of the tran-\nsitions out of living alone are for these reasons.\nLiving With a Spouse.--Individuals living with a\nspouse experience a change in living arrangement\nwhen a child moves into the household (or the couple\nmoves in with a child), a spouse dies or the marriage\ndissolves, or the individual is institutionalized or dies.\nIt is also possible for a spouse to be institutionalized\nbut this process cannot be modeled with these data.\nRate\n-Alone to With Spouse\n\u00b7Alone to With Child\n\u00b7Alone to Institutionalization or Death\nAge\nNote: Controlling for gender, race, education, functional limitations, self-rated health, number of children, and attrition.\nFigure 3.

The\nd'(x) represents the number of destination-specific living arrange-\nment transitions that occur in a given age interval. It is the prod-\nuct of the number of people surviving to agex\nand the probability\nthat a specific type of living arrangement change will occur be-\ntween agex\nand agex+1\n. The d(x) function, which represents the\ntotal number of transitions that occur during a given age interval,\nis equal to the sum of the destination-specific decrements during\na given age interval (i.e., d(x) = I d'(x)). The percentages in this\ntable were obtained by dividing c/'(x) by d(x) then multiplying by\nFigure 4 shows that the destination-specific rates for\nmovements from living with a spouse to living with a\nspouse and child decline steadily with age, but the\nrates of exits due to individual death or institutional-\nization increase exponentially with age. The second\npanel of Table 3 indicates that at age 55 the predomi-\nnant way individuals exit living with a spouse is by\ncoresiding with a child. Death and institutionalization\nbecome the most common pathways of exiting this\ntype of living arrangement after age 65.\nLiving With a Child.--Individuals living with a child\nexperience a change in living arrangements when the\nrespondent gets married, the child or the respondent\nmoves out, or the individual is institutionalized or dies.\nIn this analysis, transitions to living with a spouse only\nor with a spouse and child are not shown because\nthese transitions are fairly rare events. There were not\nenough cases in the sample that experienced these\ntransitions to support a hazard analysis.\nThe third panel of Table 3 indicates that over three\nfourths of transitions out of this living arrangement\nare to living alone while less than one fourth are\nto death or institutionalization. Yet the paths through\nwhich one is likely to exit living with a child vary with\nage. As shown in Figure 5, individuals living with a\nchild have a high risk of changing living arrangements\ndue to the movement of the child (or the respondent)\nout of the household. At age 55 the percentage of\ntransitions attributed to living alone is 98%. By age 75\nonly 39% of the transitions are to living alone, and by\nage 85 this percentage declines to only 22%.\nThe transition rates for movements from living with\na child to institutionalization or death slowly increase\nwith age. Exits due to these events account for less\nthan 2% of the transitions at age 55, but by age 85,\n78% of the transitions from living with a child are due\nto institutionalization or death.\nLiving With a Spouse and Child.--Changes in\nliving arrangements that involve both a spouse and\na child occur when the individual is institutionalized\nor dies, the child (or the couple) moves out of the\nhousehold, or the marriage is dissolved through a\nspouse's death or divorce. As shown in the last panel\nof Table 3, the risk of experiencing a change in living\narrangements due to the movement of a child (or the\nrespondent) out of the household is greatest prior to\nage 70. Eighty-two percent of the transitions at age\n55 are through the exit of a child (or the respondent)\nfrom the household. After age 70 very few of the\ntransitions are due to this cause.\nFigure 6 presents the destination-specific transition\nrates for individuals living with both a spouse and a\nchild. As the slope of the line indicates, the risk of\nexiting due to the movement of a child (or the re-\nspondent) from the household increases slightly from\nage 55 to 60 then decreases rapidly. In contrast, the\ntransition rates due to death or institutionalization in-\ncrease dramatically after age 70. Whereas death or\ninstitutionalization account for 14% of the transitions\nat age 55, by age 85 virtually all of the exits are due\nto these events.\nThere is not a significant relationship between age\nand transitions from living with a spouse and a child\nto living with a child only. Yet, the percentage of transi-\ntions to living with a child varies by age because of\nthe competing risk nature of the living arrangement\nprocess. As the percentage of transitions to living with\na spouse declines with age and the percentage of transi-\ntions due to death or institutionalization increases, the\npercentage of transitions to living with a child gradu-\nally decreases.\nDiscussion\nThis study uses event history methods to model\nliving arrangement transitions in later life.

Destination-specific transition rates from living with a spouse and child, by age.\nfindings of previous research that suggest living arrange-\nments in later life are relatively stable (e.g., Mutchler,\nresearch demonstrates tnat the degree of stability de-\npends upon the particular living arrangement under\nconsideration and the age of the individual.\nAmong all of the living arrangement categories in\nthis analysis, the most stable living arrangements be-\ntween the ages of 55 and 65 are living alone or with\na spouse, yet after age 70 the most stable living\narrangement is with a child. Even though individuals\nliving with a child tend to experience a relatively rapid\ntransition out of these living arrangements during the\npre- and early retirement years, individuals who con-\ntinue to live with a child into their 70s tend to remain\nin this living arrangement longer than those who are\nin other living arrangements. On the other hand, de-\nspite the relative stability of living alone at younger\nages, after age 70 this living arrangement becomes\nfairly unstable due to the high probability of death\nand institutionalization. Given that the transition rates\nfor living alone are relatively low during the young-\nold ages and that the majority of transitions out of\nthis living arrangement are through death or institu-\ntionalization, these results support Mutchler's (1992)\nassertion that living alone is \"a (nearly) absorbing\nstate.\" However, even living alone has a varying de-\ngree of stability across later life. Thus, the degree of\nstability in a particular living arrangement varies with\nage.\nWhile at particular ages certain living arrangements\nare more stable than others, the results do not dem-\nonstrate that living arrangements in later life are static:\ntransitions occur throughout later life regardless of\nthe living arrangement category. Although the likeli-\nhood of a transition tends to increase with age, transi-\ntions do occur during the pre- and early retirement\nyears. Transitions during these younger ages are par-\nticularly likely for individuals living with a child or with\na spouse and child. Yet even for individuals in the\nmore \"stable\" living arrangements for those ages--\nliving alone or witn a spouse--transitions are not\nuncommon. Thus, although particular living arrange-\nments are more stable than others at different points\nin later life, none are immutable.\nDespite the unique characteristics of each living ar-\nrangement category, a comparison of the destination-\nspecific hazard rates in Figures 3 through 6 indicates\nthere are predictable transition patterns across the\nlatter part of the life course. Similar to living arrange-\nment transitions that occur during young adulthood,\nthere are limited options that are most likely to occur\nat particular ages. The following discussion describes\nthe predictable relationships between each destination-\nspecific transition and age.\nUnlike previous living arrangement research that fo-\ncused only on unmarried respondents, this research\nwas able to identify the relationship between age and\ntransitions involving a spouse. Transitions involving a\nmarital union, which are relatively rare, are concen-\ntrated among the young-old ana decline with age.\nTransitions due to marital dissolution were positively\nrelated to age for individuals living with a spouse and\nunrelated to age for individuals living with a spouse\nand child. These specific transitions may be relatively\nlow and stable for two related reasons. First, these transi-\ntions are due to two competing events--separation\nor divorce and death of a spouse--each of which has\na different relationship with age. Secondly, transitions\ndue to the institutionalization of a spouse are not cap-\ntured by this analysis because of data limitations. As\na result, the marital dissolution transition rates in this\nanalysis are most likely conservative estimates of the\nmarital dissolution process among the oldest-old.\nTransitions involving coresidence with a child are\nnegatively related to age. This result was expected for\nindividuals living with a spouse but not for those liv-\ning alone. This finding provides limited support to pre-\nvious research that suggests coresidence is often due\nto the needs of the adult child and not the needs\nof the aging parent (Aquilino, 1990; Ward, Logan, &\nSpitze, 1993). If coresidence is driven by parental\nneed then the transition rate for moves to living with\na child should increase with age, especially for indi-\nviduals living alone.\nOverall, these results suggest that transition rates be-\ntween living arrangements within the community (i.e.,\nalone, with spouse, with child, or with spouse and\nchild) are relatively low and are concentrated prima-\nrily among the relatively young who are living with a\nchild or a spouse and child. Consistent with the find-\nings of previous research (e.g., Mutchler & Burr, 1991;\nSpitze et al., 1992), the results indicate that the risk\nof exiting due to death or institutionalization increases\nwith age regardless of initial living arrangement state.\nThe highest transition rates, regardless of living ar-\nrangement category, are for transitions into an institu-\ntion or death. After age 75 the most likely path through\nwhich older individuals exit any community-based liv-\ning arrangement is through these two transitions.\nGiven that the transition rates are highest after age\n75 and transitions after age 75 are overwhelming due\nto institutionalization or death, one might conclude\nthat most transitions in later life will be to an institu-\ntion or death. This conclusion, however, does not ac-\nknowledge the diversity of experience that is docu-\nmented in this analysis. For example, Table 3 indi-\ncates that despite the high transition rates into institu-\ntionalization or death at older ages, the predominate\npathway through which individuals living with a child\nor with a spouse and child exit those living arrange-\nments is via the dissolution of a coresidential living\narrangement. Furthermore, even at the oldest ages there\nis still a chance, albeit relatively small, that a commu-\nnity-based transition will occur. For instance, at age\n75, 39% of the transitions from living with a child are\nto living alone. Therefore, generalizations should not\nbe made concerning the most likely transition type\nfor all older adults regardless of living arrangement\ncategory. The most likely transition type depends first\nupon the age and second upon the living arrange-\nment category under consideration.\nThese results suggest individual decision making re-\ngarding living arrangements has to take into account\nthe conditional nature of later life living arrangements.\nRelatively young older adults, in the pre- or early re-\ntirement years, who are living alone or with a spouse\ncan expect that their living arrangements will not\nchange. If a transition is experienced, it will most likely\nbe due to coresidence with a child or a change in\nmarital status. Individuals living with a child or spouse\nand child during these early years of later life should\nexpect their living arrangements to change, primarily\ndue to the dissolution of coresidence with a chila.\nWith increased age, living arrangements become more\nunstable, so individuals should plan for impending\nchanges. As previously mentioned, during these later\nyears individuals living with a child are at the lowest\nrisk of changing living arrangements, but regardless\nof living arrangements all older adults should be pre-\npared for a living arrangement change. Although tran-\nsitions involving institutionalization and death are most\nlikely, it is still possible for transitions within the com-\nmunity to occur.\nService providers and policy makers should realize\nthat the needs of the older population depend upon\nthe stability of particular living arrangements and the\ntypes of changes that are likely to occur. For example,\nindividuals in more unstable living arrangements, par-\nticularly the oldest-old living alone or with a spouse\nand child, will need assistance maintaining their cur-\nrent living arrangement and planning for future transi-\ntions. Programs that educate older adults about the\nadvantages and disadvantages of reverse mortgages,\nas well as long-term care insurance, can assist these\nhigh-risk groups by providing insight into different\noptions for financially managing current and future\nliving arrangements. In addition, given that living with\na child is the most stable living arrangement among\nthe oldest-old, programs that provide caregiving assis-\ntance to older adults, such as respite and day care,\nshould be particularly important to families who are\nliving with an older adult. Instead of implementing\ngeneral policies for the older population, these find-\nings suggest particular programs will be of use to\ncertain living arrangement groups.\nWhile this analysis has provided insight into how\nfirst living arrangement transitions are distributed\nover the later life course, there is more to be learned\nabout the transition process. Future research should\nfocus on transitions involving others, including grand-\nchildren and nonrelatives, as well as transitions out of\ninstitutions. In addition, subsequent transitions should\nbe examined with increment-decrement life table\nmethods that model the complexity of transitions into\nand out of various living arrangement states. Although\nexamining subsequent transitions would provide a\nmore detailed picture of the living arrangement tran-\nsition process, it would not change the results re-\nported in this analysis regarding the timing of first\ntransitions or provide additional information about\nthe pace of first transitions. It would simply provide a\nmore complete understanding of the entire transition\nprocess.\nAs the previous discussion implies, there are sev-\neral dimensions of living arrangements in later life\nthat are not understood fully. The increasing availabil-\nity of data that include transition information will\nenable researchers to explore the living arrangement\nprocess in more detail. Explaining the living arrange-\nment transition process will clarify the changing house-\nhold context in which older adults live and identify\nthe factors that prompt changes in household struc-\nture. This information will enable individuals and\nservice providers to plan more effectively for the con-\ntingencies of later life living arrangements.\nReferences\nAquilino, W. S. (1990).
