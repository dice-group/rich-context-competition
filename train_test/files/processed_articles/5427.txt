Intra-specific competition\nfor resources provides the main selective pressure for the evolution of violent aggression\ntoward conspecifics, and variation in the fitness benefits and costs of aggression can\naccount for inter-specific and inter-individual differences in aggressiveness. When\naggression reflects competition for resources, its benefits vary in relation to the\ncharacteristics of the resources (their intrinsic value, abundance, spatial distribution, and\ncontrollability) while its costs vary in relation to the characteristics of organisms and how\nthey fight (which, in turn, affects the extent to which aggression entails risk of physical\ninjury or death, energetic depletion, exposure to predation, psychological and physiological\nstress, or damage to social relationships). Humans are a highly aggressive species in\ncomparison to other animals, probably as a result of an unusually high benefit-to-cost ratio\nfor intra-specific aggression. This conclusion is supported by frequent and widespread\noccurrence of male-male coalitionary killing and by male-female sexual coercion. Sex\ndifferences in violent aggression in humans and other species probably evolved by sexual\nselection and reflect different optimal competitive strategies for males and females.\n",

Examples of this\napproach include the documentation of cross-cultural similarities in facial expressions of\nemotions (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1972) and the study of sex differences in mate preferences\nacross cultures (Buss, 1989). At the same time, parallels were increasingly being made\nbetween human behavior and the behavior of other animals, particularly other primates\n(Morris, 1967). These two approaches were aimed at establishing the existence of human\nnature and thus legitimizing studies of human behavior grounded in evolutionary biology\nand animal behavioral ecology.\nSubsequent research in evolutionary psychology shifted its focus to empirical\ntesting of hypotheses derived chiefly from the theories of sexual selection, life history and\nparental investment (Barrett, Dunbar, and Lycett, 2002; Buss, 2005; Dunbar and Barrett,\n2007). There was also a parallel shift in interest from \"normative\" aspects of human nature\nto inter-individual variation (e.g., Belsky, Steinberg, and Draper, 1991; Gangestad and\nAlthough many evolutionary psychologists focus their attention exclusively on\nhuman mind and behavior, the comparative study of adaptations in other organisms has\nmade an important historical contribution to evolutionary psychology through the\ndevelopment of evolutionary theories and hypotheses, which are now being tested with\nhuman psychological and behavioral data (Daly and Wilson, 1999; Smith, Borgerhoff\nMulder, and Hill, 2000, 2001). Studies of nonhuman animals continue to be a source of\nideas, inspiration, and guidance for evolutionary psychologists, and in some cases human\nstudies are specifically designed to assess whether the findings from animal research can be\nextrapolated to humans. For these reasons, it is important to be familiar with the historical\nfindings of comparative research that led to the development of evolutionary theories\n(beginning with Darwin's own studies of many different living organisms) as well as to\nkeep up with advances in comparative research.\nIt may be argued that evolutionary psychologists should not only know about\ncomparative research but also actively engage in it. Although much evolutionary\npsychology research has moved away from the investigation of \"normative\" behaviors,\nmany aspects of human nature are not yet well characterized, some old questions about\nhuman nature have not yet been answered, and many new questions can be raised. The\nissue of whether human nature exists has been effectively investigated with cross-cultural\nstudies and could be further addressed with the investigation of genetic or neurobiological\nsubstrates of psychological and behavioral traits that are common across all human\ncultures. More importantly, the question of how human nature evolved is far from being\nsettled and this question can be addressed only with a comparative approach.\nThere are two main approaches to comparative research on the evolution of human\nWhen violence pays\nnature: phylogenetic analyses and functional \"optimization\" analyses. Comparative\nphylogenetic analyses aim to document the phylogenetic history of a trait and to test\nhypotheses about the trait's functional significance across taxa (Nunn, 2011). These\nanalyses cannot be applied effectively to traits that have a recent evolutionary history and\nhave evolved within the Homo lineage, such as language. Many human psychological and\nbehavioral traits, however, particularly those associated with cooperation, competition,\nmating, or parenting, are also present in other species (Kappeler and Silk, 2009). In some\ncases, the presence of similar traits in different species is the product of inheritance from a\ncommon ancestor (i.e., the traits are homologous). Homologous traits are more likely to\noccur in closely-related than in distantly-related species. Traits that have an ancient\nphylogenetic history and are observed in many different organisms are unlikely to be\nneutral or deleterious; rather, they likely represent adaptations that are so valuable as to be\nhighly conserved (Roney and Maestripieri, 2002). Thus, phylogenetic \"mapping\" of human\npsychological and behavioral traits can be an important contribution toward understanding\nthe evolution of many adaptive aspects of human nature.\nA comparative approach can also be used to investigate traits that are similar in\ndifferent species due to the process of convergent evolution. When different species\nconfront similar problems in their environment, they often come up with similar optimal\nsolutions to these problems. An optimal strategy to solve a problem is one that results in\nmaximal benefits at a minimal cost (Clutton-Brock and Harvey, 1984). Analyzing the\nfitness benefits and costs of psychological and behavioral traits, along with knowledge of\nthe relevant environmental selective pressures and constraints, allows evolutionary\npsychologists to obtain evidence that these traits are adaptations. Cost-benefit analyses of\nhuman adaptive traits, when conducted from a comparative perspective, can shed light on\nthe evolution of these adaptations and on the evolution of human nature more generally.\nLet us take aggressiveness as an example of an aspect of human nature for which\nthere are still many unanswered questions (Buss and Duntley, 2006; Buss and Shackelford,\n1997; Liddle, Shackelford, and Weeks-Shackelford, 2012). Two such questions are: Why is\nit that humans seem to have a high potential for violent aggression toward their\nconspecifics? And why is it that this potential for violent aggression seems to be much\nhigher in men than in women? In this article we will attempt to answer these questions by\ntaking a comparative approach and examining aggression in humans and other animals\nfrom a functional perspective (i.e., examining the fitness benefits and costs of this\nbehavior). In our discussion of intra-specific aggression, we assume that the general\npotential for aggression of a species and the average levels of aggression of males and\nfemales are the product of natural selection and not of aberrant environmental\ncircumstances (for example, dramatic alterations of the habitat of wild animal populations\ninduced by human activity), cultural forces, or selection on other traits that are associated\nwith aggression.\nWhat Makes an Animal Species More or Less Aggressive?\nFrom a functional perspective, aggression can be viewed as an expression of\ncompetition (Darwin, 1859, 1871). Competition for resources between individuals of the\nWhen violence pays\nsame species is widespread in nature, and to some extent, inter-specific variation in\naggressiveness reflects species differences in the overall intensity of competition. There are\ndifferent ways in which organisms can compete for resources, however, and competitive\nstrategies do not necessarily involve aggression. From an optimization perspective,\norganisms in any given species will use a particular competitive strategy only when its\nbenefits outweigh the costs. If different competitive strategies are available, organisms will\ntend to use the strategy with the highest benefit/cost ratio.\nIn animal species that are relatively less aggressive, the benefits of aggressive\ncompetition are probably lower than its costs. It is also possible that less aggressive species\ncan pursue alternative competitive strategies with higher benefit/cost ratios than\ncompetitive aggression. Finally, regardless of benefits and costs, there may be physical,\nsocial, ecological, or behavioral constraints that make it difficult or impossible for\naggression to be expressed in these species (e.g., in sessile marine invertebrates, highly\nsolitary animals, or small nocturnal animals under heavy predation pressure). The opposite\nis true for highly aggressive species. Here the benefits of aggression are presumably higher\nthan its costs, making aggression the preferred competitive strategy. In addition, there may\nbe few or no constraints on the expression of aggressive behavior.\nTo understand inter-specific variation in the benefit/cost ratios for aggression, it\nmay be useful to examine separately variation in the benefits and in the costs. Whenever\naggression reflects competition for resources, the benefit of aggression is obtaining those\nresources. Variation in the potential benefits of aggression generally depends on the\ncharacteristics of the resources. Aggression can entail many different types of costs\nincluding risk of injury or death, physiological or psychological stress, energy expenditure,\nincreased risk of attracting predators, and damage to social relationships, as well as time-\nallocation trade-offs with other survival- or reproduction-related activities such as feeding\nor mating. Variation in the potential costs of aggression generally depends on the\ncharacteristics of the organisms and the kind of aggressive behavior they use. In a nutshell,\nthe benefits of aggression depend on what animals fight about, while the costs depend on\nhow they fight.\nInter-specific Variation in the Benefits of Aggression\nThe benefits of aggression vary in relation to the characteristics of the resource\nbeing contested: its value, abundance, spatial distribution, and the extent to which it can be\neffectively monopolized by individuals or groups. As examples, we will briefly discuss\nhow the characteristics of resources such as food, mates, or space influence the probability\nthat competition will be aggressive.\nCompetition for food\nWhen organisms compete for food that has high nutritional value, is generally\nscarce, and is distributed in small patches that can be effectively monopolized, the potential\nbenefits of aggressive competition are high (Isbell, 1991; Koenig and Borries, 2009;\nWrangham, 1980). The most clear example of a food type that is patchily distributed, is\ndifficult to obtain, and can be monopolized effectively is meat. Intense aggressive\nWhen violence pays\n(\"contest\") competition over meat is typical of social carnivores such as lions or hyenas\nAt the other extreme is low-quality food that is widely distributed and cannot be\nmonopolized, such as grass or leaves. Herbivorous and folivorous organisms still compete\nwith their conspecifics over food but competition is indirect (\"scramble\"), which means\nthat individuals try to consume as much as possible of the resource without attacking or\ndisplacing others from it (Isbell, 1991; van Schaik, 1989). Note that the prediction here\nrefers to the quality of the food rather than to the specific type of food. Thus, if some\nfolivores show selectivity and feed only on high-quality leaves that are less common in\ntheir environment and therefore worth fighting for, aggressive contest competition is\nexpected to occur, as has been shown for between-group feeding competition in black-and-\nIn-between the two extremes of species that feed on meat and grass or leaves are the\nspecies that feed on fruit. Fruit is a highly nutritious food that is usually distributed in\ndiscrete patches that can be monopolized by one individual or, more often, by a group. The\nbenefits of aggressive competition for access to fruit are high, so that frugivores are\ngenerally more aggressive than folivores or herbivores, and in some cases as aggressive as\ncarnivores (for nonhuman primates, see Van Schaik, 1989).\nCompetition for mates\nIn most species of vertebrates, fertile males are an abundant, \"low-value\" resource\nthat cannot and need not be monopolized by females. As a result, if females were to use\naggression to compete with other females over access to males, or to sexually coerce males\nto have exclusive access to them, the benefits of such aggression would be low. In contrast,\nfertile females are a relatively scarce, high-value resource. In many mammals, most adult\nfemales are either pregnant or lactating most of the time; when they are neither pregnant\nnor lactating, they are fertile only a few days every month. The distribution of females in\nspace and time generally affects whether or not they can be effectively monopolized by\nmales for reproductive purposes (Clutton-Brock, 1989; Emlen and Oring, 1977). This, in\nturn, determines the potential benefits of male-male aggressive competition. When fertile\nfemales forage alone and are widely dispersed in space (usually due to ecological needs or\nconstraints), many of them cannot be effectively monopolized by a single male or a group\nof males; social and sexual monogamy tends to evolve, which in some cases is\naccompanied by high male parental investment (e.g., Clutton-Brock, 1991). In this situation\nthe benefits of male aggression are low. Accordingly, in socially or sexually monogamous\nspecies, there is little male-male aggressive competition for mates, at least after the initial\nestablishment of pairs, and little male-female sexual coercion. These low levels of male-\nmale aggressive competition and the low potential for sexually coercive tactics are reflected\nin the lower sexual dimorphism in body size among monogamous species both in mammals\nand in birds (Clutton-Brock and Harvey, 1977; Dunn, Whittingham, and Pitcher, 2001;\nIn contrast, when females are clumped in space because they live and forage in\ngroups, groups of females can be monopolized either by a single male (one-male groups\nwith a harem mating system) or by multiple males (multi-male multi-female groups with a\nWhen violence pays\npromiscuous mating system). Such species typically have higher levels of sexual\ndimorphism than monogamous species. This is indicative of intense intra-sexual selection\nand also suggests potential for sexual coercion of females. In such polygynous and\npromiscuously mating species, the benefits of male-male aggressive competition (Fabiani,\nGalimberti, Sanvito, and Hoelzel, 2004) and male-female sexual coercion can be high\n(Muller, Emery Thompson, Kahlenberg, and Wrangham, 2011).\nCompetition for space\nCompetition for space (e.g., territories) is a special case of competition because\ninstead of competing directly for food or mates, animals may compete for the space in\nwhich they are found. Aggressive competition also occurs over nesting sites (Semel and\nSherman, 2001), shelter (Holbrook and Schmitt, 2002), and access to drinking water\n(Wrangham, 1981). Territorial aggression can be intense when the benefits are high. This is\nillustrated by the territorial behavior of chimpanzees, which have been reported to seek out\nand kill rival males one at a time, progressively expanding their own territory into what had\npreviously been their neighbors' land (Goodall et al., 1979; Mitani, Watts, and Amsler,\n2010). Males benefit from expanding their own home range in two ways. First, range-\nexpansion increases the number of fruit trees to which their community has access.\nChimpanzees are ripe-fruit specialists and the quality of the females' diet determines\nimportant parameters of their reproductive function and success (Emery Thompson and\nWrangham, 2008). Expanding the range of the community and thereby increasing both the\nquantity and the quality of foods available to females leads to higher reproduction rates\n(Williams, Oehlert, Carlis, and Pusey, 2004). Moreover, by eliminating the males of\nneighboring communities, the resident males may also gain additional mating\nopportunities: Neighboring females are likely to join the territorially aggressive community\nand thus provide new sexual opportunities for the winning males (Emery Thompson,\nNewton-Fisher, and Reynolds, 2006; Nishida, Hiraiwa-Hasegawa, Hasegawa, and\nTakahata, 1985). Such events, in turn, set in motion another cycle of violence: Any new\nfemale chimpanzees arriving into a community will be subject to aggressive harassment\nfrom the resident females (Kahlenberg, Emery Thompson, Muller, and Wrangham, 2007),\nbehavior that is related to female-female competition over good foraging areas within the\ncommunity's territory (Kahlenberg, Emery Thompson, and Wrangham, 2008).\nMany primate, and also human, inter-group interactions are related to competition\nover food or mates, and aggression plays a key role in all of them (Crofoot and Wrangham,\n2009). However, to explain the variation in the intensity of such aggressive interactions\n(e.g., why in some species but not others individuals seek out and kill their rivals as\nopposed to just repelling them temporarily from their territory) we also need to consider the\ncosts of aggression.\nInter-specific Variation in the Costs of Aggression\nPhysical costs: Injury or death\nFighting between conspecifics entails risk of injury or even death due to irreparable\ndamage to vulnerable body parts, massive bleeding from open wounds, or bacterial\nWhen violence pays\ninfections of wounds. Such costs of aggression are potentially higher in animal species\nequipped with weapons such as horns or antlers, or large and sharp canine teeth or claws,\nand lower in species that do not possess these or other natural weapons.\nMost horn-like weapons among ungulates probably evolved through sexual\nselection for fighting ability (Geist, 1966). Even though in some species antler development\nmay signal male fertility to potential mates (Malo, Roldan, Garde, Soler, and Gomendio,\n2005), they are primarily used in male-male contests and only secondarily as a defense\nagainst predators (Clutton-Brock, 1982). Intense fighting in species with antlers and horns\nis usually restricted to the breeding season, when the potential benefits of risky aggression\nare high. This leads to a concomitant increase in the rate of injuries and deaths among male\ncompetitors during such periods (Clutton-Brock, Albon, Gibson, and Guinness, 1979;\nIndividuals in species that do not have antlers or horns can still kill each other given\nthe opportunity. Deaths from intra-specific aggression typically result from infection of bite\nwounds and overall exhaustion from fighting (Baker and McCann, 1989; Knott, 1999;\nKnott and Laman, 1998; Palombit, 1993) rather than from direct blows and punctures of\nvital organs. Among wild baboons, wounding is more common among males and occurs\nmore frequently during periods when individuals of either sex compete most intensely for\ndominance (MacCormick et al., 2012). In rhesus macaques, adult male mortality is\nsignificantly higher during the mating season than during the birth season, presumably as a\nresult of increased male-male fighting during periods of time in which many females are\nLethal killing is relatively rare in animals, in part because many organisms have\nevolved mechanisms to reduce the risk of serious injury or death associated with fighting.\nSome of these mechanisms include ritualized fighting, in which two opponents barely\ntouch each other or direct their attacks to non-vulnerable body parts, dominance, in which\ncontests are settled by an exchange of signals rather than fighting, and coalition formation,\nin which two or more individuals can simultaneously attack a target and incur little or no\nrisk of injury (see below).\nPhysiological and psychological costs\nEven in the absence of physical injury, fighting can entail significant physiological\nand psychological costs. Chronically elevated testosterone associated with aggressive\ncompetition may suppress the immune system and thus have deleterious consequences for\nhealth and fitness (Folstad and Karter, 1992; Muehlenbein and Bribiescas, 2005; but see:\nFuxjager, Foufopoulos, Diaz-Uriarte, and Marler, 2011; Nunn, Lindenfors, Pursall, and\nRolff, 2009; Roberts, Buchanan, and Evans, 2004). High testosterone levels have also been\nimplicated in higher susceptibility to oxidative stress (Alonso-Alvarez, Bertrand, Faivre,\nChastel, and Sorci, 2007), another factor that can affect survivorship and fitness.\nFrequent fighting can also be associated with chronically elevated cortisol levels\n(Sapolsky, 2004). In species that form dominance hierarchies, cortisol can be elevated in\nhigh-ranking individuals (who must use aggression to maintain their status and repel\nchallenges from lower-ranking individuals) or in low-ranking individuals (who receive\nfrequent attacks), or both, depending on the species (Abbott et al., 2003; Creel, 2001; Creel\nWhen violence pays\nand Sands, 2003). Regardless of the species-typical relationship between dominance and\nglucocorticoid production, however, chronically elevated cortisol can result in damage to\nbody organs and tissues, including the brain (Sapolsky, 2004). Finally, aggression and\nfighting, via their effect on dominance rank, can result in psychological alterations such as\nchronic anxiety or depression (e.g., Shively et al., 2005), which can negatively impact\nsurvival or reproduction.\nEnergetic costs\nAggressive behavior can affect the energy budget of an individual via two\npathways: by increasing energy expenditure and by reducing energy intake. Aggressive\ncontests tend to be physically taxing and, depending on the relative competitive ability of\nthe contestants, prolonged. African elephant bulls may fight up to 6 hours when\ncompetitors are similarly matched in size and motivation (Poole, 1989). Aggressive\ninteractions increase oxygen consumption (Hack, 1997) and animal contests are therefore\nconstrained by the physiological costs of fighting (Briffa and Sneddon, 2007). Aggression\nalso tends to constrain feeding behavior. Escalated rates of aggression among male lizards\nthat mate-guard fertile females are frequently associated with a significant reduction in\nforaging (Ancona, Drummond, and Zalvidar-Rae, 2010). A similar cost of aggressive\nbehavior exists among chimpanzee males, as a male's daily rate of aggression is negatively\nassociated with his feeding time (Georgiev, 2012). Combining the increases in energy\nexpenditure with the decreases of energy intake, many males suffer significant reductions\nin their energy reserves during periods of intense male-male aggressive competition\n(Clutton-Brock, Guiness, and Albon, 1982; Galimberti, Sanvito, Braschi, and Boitani,\nWalsberg, White, and Moore, 1995; Pelletier, Hogg, and Festa-Bianchet, 2006; Rovero,\nHughes, Whiteley, and Chelazzi, 2000). Additional evidence for the significant energetic\ncosts of aggression also comes from studies demonstrating increases in aggressive behavior\nduring periods of high food availability (Georgiev, 2012; Golabek, Ridley, and Radford,\ndiverting more resources to agonistic competition. The energetic costs of aggression are\ntherefore expected to vary between species in relation to (1) type of aggressive behavior\n(i.e., more or less exertive; longer or shorter confrontations); (2) ability of individuals to\nstore energy (e.g., in the form of fat) that can be used during periods of aggressive\ncompetition; and (3) ecological circumstances, particularly with regards to variation in food\nabundance.\nIncreased risk of predation\nAggressive behavior can affect an individual's risk of being killed by a predator in\nthree different ways. First, aggressive interactions interfere with vigilance behaviors;\nsecond, aggressive challenges may make individuals temporarily less risk-sensitive in their\nchoices of habitat and behavior (i.e., becoming more exposed); and third, aggressive\ninteractions may attract the attention of predators due to their conspicuous nature. For\nexample, fighting reduces vigilance and increases the risk of predation in fish, birds and\nlizards (Diaz-Uriarte, 1999; Jakobsson, Brick, and Kullberg, 1995). In species that avoid\nWhen violence pays\ndetection by hiding, such as small solitary nocturnal animals, the noise associated with\nfighting can increase the risk of attracting predators. In gregarious species that avoid\npredators by escaping quickly when the predator has been spotted, fighting may interfere\nwith the ability to escape effectively. Thus, overall, species that are less vulnerable to\npredation (e.g., those living in predator-free environments, those with larger body size,\nthose that live in social groups, and in particular those that employ a cooperative system to\nmonitor threats from predators), all other things being equal, are expected to be more\naggressive than species that are more susceptible to predation.\nDamage to social relationships\nIn group-living species in which individuals depend on cooperation with\nconspecifics for defense of resources from other groups, or in which cooperation is needed\nfor friendships and alliances, fighting can damage social relationships with friends and\nallies, including relatives. Social bonds have important fitness benefits (Silk, Alberts, and\nAltmann, 2003) and thus alienating friends can be disadvantageous. The importance of\nsocial relationships is supported by evidence that, among primates, individuals sharing a\n\"valuable relationship\" tend to reconcile their conflicts more often than other, less-strongly\naffiliated, individuals (Aureli, Cords, and van Schaik, 2002; de Waal, 2000; Palagi,\nAntonacci, and Norscia, 2008; Watts, 2006). Aggression would thus be expected to be\nmore intense and its escalation more frequent in species where little social affiliation,\nbonding and cooperation exist among group members. Similarly, in species where males\nare not able to dominate females, behaving aggressively toward a female may damage a\nmale's chances of mating and thus male-female aggression would be selected against\nSex Differences in Aggression across Different Animal Species\nIn many species of vertebrates there are important differences in the resources\nmales and females compete for, as well as in the strategies they use to obtain these\nresources. Because of sex differences in parental investment, females compete primarily\nover access to food, whereas males compete primarily over access to mates (Trivers, 1972).\nFor example, wild adult female chimpanzees in Kanyawara, Kibale National Park (Uganda)\nfight most often over plant food, whereas males are most commonly aggressive in the\ncontext of sexual competition (Muller, 2002). Males are almost 14 times more aggressive\nthan females, with the female rate of aggression probably being an overestimate (Muller,\nInter-specific variation in sex differences in aggressiveness can result from\ndifferences in the benefits or the costs (or both) of aggression to males and females.\nBecause of the greater benefits of male-male aggressive competition (see above), sexual\nselection has favored larger body size among males in many mammals (in >45% of species\nmales are10% larger than females; Lindenfors, Gittleman, and Jones, 2007). Although\nrecent comparative work challenges the notion that the male-bias in body size dimorphism\nis consistently associated with male social dominance over females (Hemelrijk, Wantia,\nand Isler, 2008), a moderate to high degree of dimorphism seems to be a prerequisite for\nWhen violence pays\nthe evolution of one particular form of aggression: sexual coercion. Sexually coercive\nbehavior occurs mostly in species in which males are both larger than and socially\ndominant to females, i.e., when the costs of male-female aggression are low for males\nWrangham, 2009; Smuts and Smuts, 1993). Conversely, because the benefits of sexual\ncoercion by females rarely outweigh its costs, this is not a reproductive strategy that has\nbeen documented among female animals, even in species in which females are socially\ndominant over males.\nAlthough females in many species engage in intense competitive aggression for\nMontgomerie, and Lyon, 2012), a situation of complete sex-role reversal, in which females\ncompete for mates more intensely than males, is rare in animals and occurs mostly among\nbirds and fish (Eens and Pinxten, 2000). In these cases females have a higher potential\nreproductive rate and a higher benefit/cost ratio for aggression than males (Clutton-Brock\nand Vincent, 1991). In spotted hyenas, females are larger than males and dominate them in\nsocial interactions. Compared to males, they exhibit both higher overall rates of aggression\nand higher rates of inter-sexual aggression (Szykman et al., 2003; Van Meter, 2009).\nFemale aggression in spotted hyenas is adaptive in the context of intense feeding\ncompetition and has also been explained as an extreme form of maternal investment due to\nthe exceptionally long time that the specialized bone-crushing feeding apparatus takes to\ndevelop in this species, and thus the need of maternal aggressive support during feeding\n(Watts, Tanner, Lundrigan, and Holekamp, 2009).\nLike spotted hyenas, females in many lemur species tend to be dominant over males\nand, at least in some cases, this dominance is achieved through or associated with higher\nrates of female aggression (Kappeler, 1990; Meredith, 2012). Female dominance in lemurs\nmay be associated with a high benefit/cost ratio for aggression relative to males: Females\nmay gain more from competitive aggression over food than males because of low food\navailability in Madagascar and the constraints it poses on female reproduction (Dunham,\n2008); in addition, the costs of female aggression may be lower in lemurs than in other\nprimates because most lemurs are sexually monomorphic.\nIn polygynous or promiscuous mammalian species, the need to aggressively defend\noffspring from infanticidal conspecifics may also select for high female aggressiveness\n(Maestripieri, 1992); given that the certainty of parenthood in these species is higher for\nfemales than for males, the benefits of offspring defense are higher in females than in males\nand under certain conditions may outweigh the risks associated with aggressing against\nlarger males.\nInter-specific variation in sex differences in the costs of aggression can be the result\nof sex differences in body size, strength, and weaponry. In species in which males are\nlarger, stronger, and have more weapons than females, the costs of inter-sex aggression are\nhigher for females than for males due to an increased risk of injury or death (Maestripieri\nand Carroll, 1999). Differences between males and females can also occur in the energetic,\npsychological or social costs of aggression. In mammals, the energetic and psychological\ncosts of aggression could be high for females because aggression-related energy\nexpenditure and stress can interfere with fertility, pregnancy, or motherhood and lactation\nWhen violence pays\n(Campbell, 1999). The social costs of aggression are expected to be higher in the sex that\nshows higher levels of bonding and alliance formation. In mammals, dispersal is more\ncommon in males, and philopatry is common in females. In all mammalian species in\nwhich females are philopatric and form strong bonds with female relatives (Wrangham,\n1980), the social costs of aggression may be higher in females than in males.\nIn some socially and sexually monogamous species, the benefit/cost ratios of\naggression may be similar for males and females because they are similar in body size,\nstrength and weaponry, in ecological characteristics and dietary needs, and in social styles\nand mating strategies, including confidence of parenthood. In other species, males and\nfemales may be equally aggressive because competition for resources is mediated by\ncompetition for social status, and such competition is equally intense for males and\nfemales. For example, in rhesus macaques and many other cercopithecine monkeys, both\nmales and females have rigid dominance hierarchies that regulate access to resources.\nAggressive competition for high status is highly beneficial to males in terms of higher\naccess to fertile females during the mating season and to females in terms of greater access\nto food and better protection of the offspring during the birth season (Maestripieri, 2007).\nSince sexual dimorphism in body size, physical strength, and weaponry is limited in rhesus\nmacaques, the physical costs of aggression are probably similar for males and females.\nOverall, the benefit/cost ratio of aggression is high for both male and female rhesus\nmacaques, and in this species, there are no observable differences in male and female\naggressiveness.\nBenefits and Costs of Violent Aggression in Humans\nHuman beings clearly have the ability to live peacefully in close proximity to\nmillions of other people, as it happens in many cities around the world. Yet, violent crimes\nhave been reported in every human society, and wars and genocide have occurred\nrepeatedly throughout human history (Pinker, 2011). Human beings seem to have a high\npotential for violent aggression, and since virtually all wars have been fought by men and\nmost murders and other violent crimes are committed by men, this aggressive potential\nseems to be much higher in men than in women. Women, however, are not necessarily\npeaceful; they also engage in many forms of aggression--physical, verbal, and\npsychological. Relative to other animals, humans should probably be categorized as one of\nthe most aggressive species, and one in which there is a relatively large sex difference in\naggression. To explain the characteristics of human aggression from a comparative\nperspective, we will first examine the benefits and costs of aggression for the species as a\nwhole, and then for males and females separately.\nAs with other animals, the benefits of aggression in humans depend on the\ncharacteristics of the resources being fought over. From an evolutionary perspective, it is\nlikely that competition for food, mates, and territories played a key role in shaping our\naggressive nature. Modern humans are omnivorous and there are large geographic, cultural,\nand individual differences in the extent to which our diet includes meat, fish, dairy\nproducts, or vegetables. For much of human evolutionary history, however, our diet was\nprobably more similar to that of chimpanzees than to that of herbivorous or folivorous\nWhen violence pays\nanimals. Meat, fruit, and other highly caloric foods have probably always been a central\ncomponent of the human diet. The benefits of aggressive competition over valuable food\nthat can be effectively monopolized by individuals or groups were probably high\nthroughout the early history of Homo sapiens and that of our most recent hominid and\nnonhuman primate ancestors. Insofar as valuable food was localized in areas that could be\neffectively defended, aggressive competition for space was also highly beneficial. Human\nbeings are a highly territorial species, both at the individual and at the group level.\nTrespassing into another individual's territory can elicit highly aggressive responses,\nparticularly by men. At the group level, territorial disputes between countries or ethnic\ngroups have precipitated many wars, not to mention the colonization of other continents\nand the extermination of local people (Diamond, 1997).\nAggressive competition for access to mates is much more beneficial for human\nmales than for females, as will be discussed below. Whether aggressive competition is over\nfood, territories, mates, or the social status that enhances the access to these valuable\nresources, it is safe to conclude that ours is a species in which inter-individual competition\ncan be very intense and in which aggressive competitive strategies can be highly beneficial,\nespecially for males.\nRelative to some other mammals, humans are not particularly large and strong, or\nequipped with dangerous weapons such as large and sharp canine teeth or claws, or horns\nor antlers. Before humans started using objects and tools as weapons, physical combat\ndepended on hits inflicted with hands or feet, and scratches or bites. The risk of injury or\ndeath from this type of fighting is relatively low, when compared with the potential costs of\nfighting for larger and more dangerous animals such as elephants or rhinos, lions or tigers,\nbears or crocodiles, deer or goats. Therefore, the physical costs of aggression in humans are\nrelatively low compared to some other species. An additional factor that reduces the cost of\naggression in humans is the ability of men to form coalitions (Wrangham, 1999). Similar to\nthe pattern typical of inter-group coalitionary aggression in male chimpanzees, hunter-\ngatherer men kill rivals from neighboring groups when opportunities for low-cost\naggression (\"safe killing\") are present, i.e., when the attacking group has a numerical\nadvantage and the victims are unprepared to retaliate (Wrangham and Glowacki, 2012).\nThe energetic costs of aggression are probably lower for humans than for other,\nlarger-bodied animals. However, muscle mass is energetically expensive to build and\nmaintain; an adult man's muscle tissue can consume up to one-fifth of his energy\n(Muehlenbein and Bribiescas, 2005). Sexual dimorphism in body composition--especially\nin the upper body, where it is most useful in aggressive contexts--suggests that the costs of\nfighting in human populations are not insignificant (Sell, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2009);\nhuman females cannot afford to develop such costly weaponry given the energetic demands\nof pregnancy and lactation. That human males allocate so much energy to musculature\ndevelopment despite the fact that it is a substantial caloric investment further evinces the\nbenefits of being aggressive.\nThe psychological and hormonal costs of aggression in humans are probably\ncomparable to those in other social species or possibly higher, given that humans have\ngreater ability for thinking about the self and greater ability to feel empathy for others'\npain. However, these stress-related costs of aggression are expected to be significant\nWhen violence pays\nmainly with regard to aggression between family members, or friends and allies. These\ncosts may be much lower if aggression is directed toward enemies from other groups.\nFinally, the social costs of human aggression are expected to be high when fighting\noccurs between relatives, friends and allies, or members of one's group, and low when\naggression is directed toward unrelated individuals belonging to other groups. Although\nviolent aggression is quite common between related individuals or unrelated but highly\nfamiliar individuals, such rates of aggression are actually low, controlling for the amount of\ntime that these individuals spend together. Human beings have opportunities to interact\nwith many unrelated individuals from other groups to a much greater extent than other\nanimals. If damage to valuable social relationships is considered one of the main social\ncosts of aggression, then aggression toward individuals in other groups has low social costs\nbecause relationships with them are nonexistent. Similarly, large-scale aggression toward\nother groups, such as in wars, has low social costs.\nThe invention and elaboration of projectile weapons, from hand-held spears to\nremotely controlled drones, and the consequent ability to hit, injure, and kill other\nindividuals from a distance has brought about a significant reduction of all the costs of\naggression. Killing someone from a distance by launching a spear or firing a gun has\nvirtually eliminated the risk of physical injury for the aggressor. The energy expenditure\ninvolved in the use of various types of weapons is minimal as well. Finally, the\npsychological, physiological, and social costs of aggression through projectile weapons are\nalso low, because this type of aggression allows one to attack individuals (or groups) that\nare not seen or known, with whom there are no social relationships of any kind, and\nwithout being exposed to the direct consequences of the violence.\nWith some exceptions, competition through violent aggression generally has a high\nbenefit/cost ratio for humans. Consider, for example, the situation of the European colonial\narmies that first encountered the local populations in America, Africa, Asia, or Australia.\nThe benefits of using violent aggression against the indigenous populations were\nenormous: taking away their land, their possessions, and even their people to use as slaves.\nThe costs of the colonists' aggression were minimal: Armed with rifles, they could quickly\nkill large numbers of indigenous individuals at little or no physical risk to themselves.\nMoreover, the indigenous populations looked different and spoke a different language; it\nmust have been quite easy for the colonists to find a psychological, political, historical, or\nreligious justification for their violence, without suffering any consequences. These\nunusually high benefit/cost ratios for violent aggression against people from other countries\nare rare or nonexistent in animals, which may explain why large-scale aggression toward\nconspecifics is absent in animals, with the possible exception of chimpanzees and some\nspecies of ants and termites that stage wars against other colonies, destroying or taking\naway their resources and enslaving the workers.\nWhen the benefit/cost ratio of violent aggression is lowered, for example, by\npunishing aggressive individuals or imposing sanctions on belligerent countries, humans do\nbecome less aggressive. A historical trend for a general reduction in human violent\naggression (Pinker, 2011) suggests that human behavior is sensitive to current selective\npressures and any changes in the environment that might affect its adaptive value. The\nbenefits and costs of human violent aggression may vary and be differentially weighted not\nWhen violence pays\nonly over historical time but also in relation to geographic location, culture, education,\nintelligence, religion, availability of resources, and many other factors. To give just one\nexample of this variation, consider two human populations such as the Moriori of the\nChatham Islands and the Maori of New Zealand (Diamond, 1997). Although both\npopulations had descended from the same group of Polynesian farmers, the Maori had\ndeveloped a culture of violence and war, whereas the Moriori had developed a culture of\npeaceful resolution. This disparity was likely due to a complex combination of\nenvironmental and technological factors that calibrated the costs and benefits of violence\ndifferently for each population. The Maori lived in a climate stable enough to permit\nagriculture, which allowed for the development of more advanced weaponry and for\nincreased population growth, leading to the emergence of tribes and coalitions. A culture of\nviolent aggression would have been advantageous for the Maori, as a system of agriculture\nwould have increased the benefit of fighting over monopolizable food and territory, while\nthe use of weapons and the formation of coalitions would have minimized costs. In\ncontrast, the harsh environmental conditions on the Chatham Islands impeded technological\nadvancement and population growth and forced the Moriori to revert back to the hunter-\ngatherer lifestyle. The Moriori could not effectively monopolize food resources, had very\nsimple weaponry, and remained a small population with few or no subgroups. Violent\naggression may have been more costly than beneficial for the Moriori, and so a culture of\npeaceful resolution to conflict emerged on the Chatham Islands. Not surprisingly, when\nthese populations came into contact in 1835, the aggressive Maori exterminated the\nSex Differences in Human Aggression\nSexual selection theory provides the most convincing evolutionary explanation for\nthe marked difference in aggressiveness between men and women (Archer, 2009;\nLindenfors and Tullberg, 2011; Puts, 2010). The benefits of both intra- and inter-sexual\naggression are higher for men than women, and they are all related to reproductive effort\n(competition for mates and sexual coercion). Among our ancestors, males who were\nsuccessful in aggressively keeping their competitors away from fertile females, who could\nmonopolize these females during their fertile periods and mate exclusively with them, and\nwho could overcome any female reticence to mate through aggressive coercion presumably\ngained a great deal in terms of reproductive success. In contrast, the advantage gained by\nfemales who aggressively competed against other females to mate with superior males may\nhave been relatively small, given that many females managed to reproduce regardless of\ntheir competitive ability, superior males may have been difficult to find, and monopolizing\nmating with these superior males would have little benefit. For these reasons, attempting to\naggressively coerce and monopolize superior males was probably ineffective and did not\nbring females significant reproductive benefits.\nRisk of injury or death, and energetic, stress-related, and social costs of intra-sexual\naggression may be generally equal in males and females. Being pregnant or having to\nbreastfeed a child, however, poses a significant energetic constraint on a human female's\nability to engage in violent aggressive behavior--and indeed even on her ability to build\nWhen violence pays\nthe muscle necessary to win confrontations. Although relative to other primates humans are\nnot highly sexually dimorphic (Plavcan, 2012), differences in male and female stature,\nmusculature development and strength are not insignificant. Thus, sexual selection\npressures favoring the increase in body size and aggressiveness in males presumably\nincreased the costs of female aggression. Human females likely developed alternative, non-\nphysical competitive strategies such as verbal social/relational aggression toward other\nwomen and social manipulation tactics involving sex and investment with men.\nConclusions\nThe use of aggression in the context of intra-specific competition for resources can\nbe viewed as an optimization problem and investigated with the fitness cost/benefit\nanalyses typically used in behavioral ecology. Aggressive competitive strategies evolve\nwhen the benefits of aggression outweigh its costs and when its benefit/cost ratio is higher\nthan that of alternative, non-aggressive strategies. The benefits and costs of aggressive\ncompetition depend on organisms' physical characteristics, their diet, their mating system\nand reproduction, and their anti-predator and social strategies, as well as their environment.\nHumans--males more than females--have a propensity to compete for resources\nwith others, especially non-group members, via violent aggression, when compared to other\nanimal species. This characteristic of human nature likely evolved because ancestral\nhumans could fight with rivals or rival bands at relatively low cost (low risk of lethal\ninjury, or extreme energetic depletion or social stigmatization) but with significant benefit\n(access to valuable resources such as meat and fertile females). Sexual dimorphism in body\nsize, muscle mass, and physical strength also favors male sexual coercion of females.\nLower physical aggressiveness in human females is likely accounted for by lower benefits\nand higher costs of aggression, in addition to constraints imposed by reproduction.\nA high potential for aggression appears to be a relatively stable characteristic of\nhuman nature that is best understood from a comparative perspective, by examining animal\nspecies that are subjected to similar selective pressures and/or are phylogenetically close to\nus. Predicting, however, the extent to which violent aggression is actually exhibited in\nhuman social interactions at the individual or the group level requires a consideration of\nhistorical, geographical, and cultural factors because these factors can impact the benefits\nand costs of aggression as much as other biological or environmental variables.\nReferences\nAbbott, D., Keverne, E., Bercovitch, F., Shively, C., Mendoza, S., Saltzman, W., . . .\nSapolsky, R.
