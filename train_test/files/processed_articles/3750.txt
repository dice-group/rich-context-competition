There\nare three competing theories regarding the influence of age on child facial cues: younger\ncues have the strongest influence, older cues have the strongest influence, and age cues do\nnot influence adults. There are empirical findings that provide support for each of these\nhypotheses. Because previous studies have not focused on measures of adults' desire to\nprovide parental care and have used limited stimulus sets and/or statistics, we conducted\ntwo studies to determine how age-related changes in child faces influenced adults'\nperceptions and ratings in the Hypothetical Adoption Paradigm. We presented\napproximately 200 adults with images of 12 different children at eight different ages (from\nsix months to six years). Adults' ratings of adoption preference and cuteness were strongly\nand negatively related to the age of the child facial stimuli, while there was no consistent\nrelationship between child age and adults' ratings of health. Our results support the\nhypothesis that facial cues associated with younger ages are most effective at eliciting adult\nresponses associated with parental care.\n",

John Bowlby (1982) further suggested that\nfeatures of infant faces might have evolved through natural selection to facilitate the\ndevelopment of appropriate attachment. Both of these researchers hypothesized that youth\nwas a critical component to the facial cues. But how critical a component is it, and at what\nage are the cues most effective?\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\nThere are currently three conflicting hypotheses concerning the influence of age-\nrelated changes in infant and child facial characteristics on adults' perceptions (for brevity,\nhereafter, child faces will be used to refer to child and/or infant faces). The first hypothesis\nis that younger cues are more effective at eliciting feelings of parental care. Lorenz's and\nBowlby's \"traditional\" hypotheses assume that the need and demand for parental care\ndecreases as the child matures, leading to the prediction that infantile (i.e., younger) faces\nwould be most effective at eliciting parental care such that adults would increase their\nrelative investment of parental resources in younger infants. For example, Hadza mothers\nspend significantly more time tending holding and nursing their infants as compared to\nThe second hypothesis is based on Trivers's biological theory of parental\ninvestment (Trivers, 1972; 1974) that suggests that parents should seek to invest their\nlimited resources in the best possible fashion with regards to maximizing their biological\nfitness. According to this theory, adults may prefer to invest their resources in older\nchildren because they represent a more secure investment than do younger children. Across\nsocieties and historic times, infancy has typically been the period of greatest mortality in\nhumans (e.g., Hewlett, 2005) it may therefore (from biological or economic viewpoints) be\nless risky to invest resources in an older child that is more likely to survive to maturity and\nprovide return upon the investment. In a study of parental infanticide, Daly and Wilson\n(1988) found that younger children were much more likely to be killed than older children.\nThe third hypothesis is that age-related changes do not significantly influence how\nadults perceive and respond to child facial cues. This null hypothesis could be the case if\neither child facial cues were unimportant to adults, if there were no relative differences\nbetween the information provided by child faces of different ages, or if the tendencies\nidentified in the other theories cancelled each other out.\nTable 1. Empirical support for theories of younger, older, or null age preferences for child facial cues.\nReference Hypoth. Faces # Stimuli # of Children Age Range\nHildebrandt and\nRitter, Casey, and\nHorvath, Smigelsky,\nPittenger, Mark, and\nNull/\nYounger\nSussman, Mueser, Grau,\nWhile there is disagreement between the theoretical hypotheses, there is also\nconflicting empirical data regarding the relationship between the age of child facial cues\nand adults' responses to them. Table 1 outlines the various studies conducted on child\nfacial cues and age, including the study, which hypothesis the data from that study\nsupports, whether the study used photographs or line drawings, the total number of stimuli,\nthe number of children used to get the stimuli, and the age range of the stimuli. These\nempirical studies are each limited by a restricted age range, the use of line drawings as\nstimuli, a limited number of stimuli, and/or the use of simplistic univariate statistics. To\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\naddress these limitations, we conducted an empirical examination of how facial cues\nchange over a wide range of child ages, and how those changes influence adults'\nperceptions and reactions. Using a multivariate approach, we sought to test the three\ncompeting hypotheses regarding the influence of age on child facial cues.\nWe chose the Hypothetical Adoption Paradigm to address the two aforementioned\nquestions. In the Hypothetical Adoption Paradigm a series of child stimuli are presented to\nadult participants who are asked to pretend that they are interested in adopting a child.\nParticipants then rate their desire to adopt each child based on its photograph. The\nHypothetical Adoption Paradigm has been used previously to examine child facial cues of:\nattractiveness (Chin, Wade, and French, 2006), resemblance (DeBruine, 2004; Platek,\nBurch, Panyavin, Wasserman, and Gallup, 2002; Platek et al. 2004; Volk and Quinsey,\n2007), general health and happiness (Volk and Quinsey, 2002), fetal alcohol syndrome\n(Waller, Volk, and Quinsey, 2004), and body weight (Volk and Quinsey, 2006). The\nparadigm is based on the hypothesis that adults may have evolved cognitive mechanisms\nthat allow them to detect important infant or child facial cues and respond to them in ways\nthat would maximize their own evolutionary fitness in an ancestral environment (see Volk\nand Quinsey, 2002, for more detail). While this approach emphasizes the importance of\nbiological adaptation, it does not preclude or exclude learned and/or cultural influences.\nWe presented adults with photographic images of the faces of five children at eight\ndifferent ages ranging from infancy to early childhood. To obtain a measure related to\nparental care, we asked adults to rate their desire to hypothetically adopt the child in each\nimage. To obtain a second measure related to the desire to provide parental care we asked\nadults to rate the cuteness of the faces (Langlois, Ritter, Casey, and Sawin, 1995). Finally,\nwe asked adults to rate the health of the faces in order to get a direct measure of perceived\nhealthiness (all ratings used a seven point Likert scale). Given that childhood mortality has\nhistorically been greatest during infancy (Cunningham, 2005; Hewlett, 2005), it may be\nthat infants either are, or are perceived by adults as being, more fragile and less healthy\nthan older children. We predicted that the age of the children would significantly influence\nadult's perceptions and ratings. We did not have a specific a priori prediction regarding the\ndirection of the influence caused by changes in child age.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nWe recruited participants from the undergraduate population and from the local\nKingston, Ontario community. Undergraduate students from the Psychology 100 Subject\nPool received credit towards their course grade, while community members and non-\npsychology students received $5 for their participation. We contacted the community\nmembers and non-psychology students through word of mouth, e-mail, and posters. We\nrecruited a total of 129 participants. Of these, we excluded six because they failed to follow\ninstructions. The final sample consisted of 73 women and 50 men. There were 67\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\nundergraduates had significantly fewer children (M = 0.04, SD = 0.3 vs. M = 1.9, SD = 1.2;\nstudents and community members reported household/family incomes in excess of\nMaterials\nThe stimuli consisted of pictures from each of five different Caucasian children\nmonths. The children faced the camera in all pictures, and all but one were in color. We\nobtained two of the children's pictures (both female) through a modeling agency (Quest\nWorldwide Productions, Virginia, www.questmodels.com). We obtained the other three\nchildren's pictures (two male and one female) from private collections. All children were of\naverage body weight and had no obvious facial dysmorphisms. We cropped the pictures to\nobtain a standard size and resolution (640 x 680 pixels) using Corel Photo-House 5.\nThese 35 images were included with 20 other images used in a concurrent study\n(the other 20 images were of the same children at different ages but were digitally warped\nto represent conditions of facial asymmetry or low body weight). The images were\npresented on a black background using Microsoft PowerPoint 2000 software. We used\nMicrosoft Office Excel 2000's random numbering function to generate ten different\npresentation orders to minimize any order effects. The only restriction for image order\nselection was that a manipulated picture could not be placed immediately prior to or after\nits unaltered counterpart (i.e., there were never two pictures of the same child, at the same\nage, together). Randomized number tables assigned each participant one of the ten fixed\npresentation orders. Within each presentation, each image of a child's face was followed by\nfour separate slides on which four separate questions were posed.\nProcedure\nParticipants received an information sheet prior to commencing the study.\nParticipants then signed a consent form, after which they received appropriate\ncompensation. Participants sat by themselves at a desk with a computer where they\nreceived oral instructions on how to control the PowerPoint presentation, and how to record\ntheir answers on the table provided. Participants were told that they should rate each image\ncritically and independently. They were also asked not revisit any previously viewed slides.\nA series of four questions followed each stimulus presentation (i.e., after each face). \"How\nwilling would you be to adopt the previous child?\", \"How healthy do you think the previous\nchild is?\", \"How much do you think the previous child resembles you?\", and \"How cute do\nyou think the previous child is?\" Participants answered these questions using a Likert-scale\nof one to seven, where a value of one represented the lowest possible score, \"very\nunwilling/unhealthy/no resemblance/not cute\", and a value of seven represented the highest\npossible score, \"very willing/healthy/high resemblance/very cute\". The participants\nrecorded their ratings on a prepared printout. Given that health and cuteness ratings may be\nhighly correlated (e.g., Volk and Quinsey, 2002; Waller et al., 2004), we attempted to\nreduce method variance by separating their rating with the resemblance question in order to\npromote a relatively independent consideration (Volk and Quinsey, 2002). Following the\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\nslide presentation, participants completed a demographic questionnaire and then received a\ndebriefing form and thanks for their participation.\nResults\nBecause we did not have photos for all children at all eight ages, we were unable to\nconduct inferential analyses on the entire data set. We therefore conducted analyses on\nthree of the five stimulus sets that were complete. All of the results were conducted using\nExcel 2000 and SPSS v.8. To preserve power, resemblance was not included in the\nMANOVA and ANOVA analyses. We chose a general alpha level of .05 for all analyses.\nEffect sizes of small, medium/modest, and large/strong were defined using Cohen's (1992)\nconventions. We analyzed the three stimulus sets that contained exemplars of all eight ages\nwith a MANOVA. However, preliminary data screening revealed that sphericity was\nviolated for most of the tests. Therefore, we chose to examine the multivariate output from\nSPSS using the conservative but robust Pillai's criterion for all appropriate analyses as a\ngeneral precaution against any violations of assumptions (Tabachnik and Fidell, 1996).\nTable 2.

The results of these tests are also presented in Table 2.\nFor adoption preference, Sex (higher scores for women), Stimulus, Age, and Stimulus x\nrelationship between age and adoption preference ratings for these data is presented in\nFigure 1.

Again there was a strong negative\nrelationship between age and cuteness ratings with the student participants having given\nlower ratings than the community participants.\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\nFigure 2.

The relationship between age and health ratings is presented in Figure 3.\nThe negative relationship between age and health ratings is not easily discernible from this\nfigure, illustrating the relatively small effect of age on health ratings. Furthermore, there\nwas no clear difference between the ratings of the community versus student participants.\nFigure 3. Influence of age on average health ratings for overall, community, and student groups in Study 1.\nThe correlations between adoption preference, health, resemblance, and cuteness\nare presented in Table 3. Average correlations are presented for the stimuli ages of six\nmonths and six years. To calculate the average correlations, each individual infant face\n(stimulus) was treated in much the same way as a separate trial in a repeated-measures\ndesign. These individual correlations would then be then transformed into z' scores using\nFisher's z' transformation, averaged as z' scores, then transformed back into correlations\nyears (see Volk et al., 2005, for specific details regarding calculating average correlations).\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\nAll of the average correlations were significant. The correlations between adoption,\ncuteness, and health were all large, while the correlations with resemblance were small to\nmedium in effect size.\nTable 3.

At the mulitivariate and univariate levels, stimulus age was negatively related\nto adoption preference, cuteness, and health. The effect sizes were medium to large for\nadoption preference and cuteness, but were small for health. The plots of age versus\nadoption preference and cuteness suggest that there is an initial peak of adoption preference\nand cuteness during infancy that declines to a slight plateau in toddler years, and then\ndeclines again at the end of the toddler years. Interestingly, the figures appear to correspond\nwith the amount of time that children typically spend with their caregivers in many cultures\n- a high level during infancy, reduced but still high level during the toddler years, and then\nfurther drop once the child becomes relatively independent in early childhood (Eibl-\nEibelsefeldt, 1989). These data best fit the \"traditional\" hypothesis that child facial cues are\nmost effective during early childhood and that these effects diminish with time. The\naverage correlations between adoption preference, cuteness, and health were similar in size\nand direction as in previous studies (e.g., Volk and Quinsey, 2002).\nHowever, two findings complicate the support of the traditional hypothesis. First,\nthe small but significant negative relationship between stimulus health and stimulus age\nmakes it possible that the observed relationships between stimulus age and the\nadoption/cuteness ratings are mediated by the increased apparent health of younger\nchildren. Second, the three individual stimulus sets significantly influenced the results at all\nlevels of analysis, and interacted significantly with stimulus age. This suggests that\ndifferent children's faces may undergo different developmental trajectories and/or that their\nfacial cues differentially influence adults at different ages.\nOverall then, the findings of this first study strongly suggest that stimulus age\nsignificantly and negatively influenced adults' perceptions and ratings of adoption\npreference and cuteness. The ambiguity of the negative relationship with health, along with\nthe apparent importance of stimuli (the individual children) as a variable led us to conduct a\nsecond study in an effort to replicate and expand the results of the initial study.\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\nStudy 2 (Replication)\nStudy 2 was designed to confirm and elaborate upon our initial findings. In this\nsecond study we used new participants, expanded the number of different children used as\nstimuli, and included an independent measure of stimulus quality. The other aspects of the\nstudy remained the same.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nWe again recruited participants from both the undergraduate population and from\nthe local community using the Psychology 100 Subject Pool, word of mouth, email, and\nposters. Undergraduate students from the Psychology 100 Subject Pool received credit\ntowards their course grade, while community members and non-psychology students\nreceived $5 for their participation. We recruited a total of 76 participants. Of these, we\nexcluded one because of a failure to follow instructions. The final sample consisted of 48\nwomen and 23 men. There were 47 undergraduates, 13 men and 34 women, (mean age =\n36.4 years, SD = 12.6). The undergraduates had significantly fewer children (M = 0.0 vs. M\n-8.69, p < .001). Approximately 75% of both students and community members reported\nhousehold incomes in excess of $40,000 (students' household income was based on their\nparents' income). The majority of participants (96%) were Caucasian.\nMaterials\nThe stimuli consisted of pictures from each of seven different Caucasian children, at\n(two male and five female) from private collections. One of the female stimulus sets was\nmissing a picture for age 48 months, leaving a total of 55 facial images. The photos were\nsimilar in nature to, and present in the same way, as the photos in Study 1.\nProcedure\nThe procedure in the second study was the same as the procedure in first study.\nResults\nWe analyzed the data using the same methods as in the previous study. Of the seven\nsets of stimuli, only six had all eight ages required for inclusion in the MANOVA.\nHowever, preliminary data screening led us to again employ the more conservative but\nmore robust Pillai's criterion for all appropriate significance tests. We identified two\noutliers using Cook's distances of 1.36 (stimulus 4, age 1, adoption scores) and 1.72\n(stimulus 1, age 1, cuteness scores). Given that these were relatively modest Cook's\ndistances, we left them unaltered. There were also two missing data points that we replaced\nwith the mean value between an average value for the particular participant and the\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\nWe performed a 2 x 2 x 6 x 8 x 3 MANOVA analysis on three dependent variables:\nadoption preference, cuteness, and health. As in the previous study, the independent\nvariables were Sex (of participants), Group (community vs. undergraduates), Stimulus\n(set), and Age (of stimuli). The multivariate tests results are presented in Table 4.\nTable 4.

Adoption preference\nand cuteness were negatively correlated with age, but in contrast to the original study, there\nwas a significant positive relationship between health and age.\nThe Study 2 correlations between adoption preference, health, resemblance, and\ncuteness did not differ significantly from the Study 1 correlations presented in Table 3. In\nboth Study 1 and 2, child sex did not significantly influence any of the correlations\n(including those with age).\nGeneral Discussion\nThe large multivariate effects of Age found in both studies (with partial 2 values in\nexcess of .7) strongly support the hypothesis that the influence of child facial cues on adults\nchanges with child age. In both studies the individual stimulus sets also played a significant\nrole in the multivariate analysis (i.e., not all children were rated equally). There was also a\nstrong effect of Stimulus x Age that may reflect developmental differences in how the\ninfluence of individual children's facial cues changes with age. Indeed, some of the\nchildren underwent significant changes in their physical appearance (e.g., a common\nchange being darkening of their hair), while other children remained quite similar (e.g., a\nuniformly red haired child was especially noted in participant debriefing reports).\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\nDifferences in adults' individual traits may have influenced the perceptions and\nratings of the child faces, as suggested by the significant main effects for sex and group in\nthe first study. There were similar, but non-significant trends, in the second study. These\nnon-significant findings are likely due to the reduced power of the second study and/or the\nyounger average age and fewer number of children in the second community sample. The\nsex and group differences between the adults are consistent with previous studies of child\nAt the univariate level, age was significantly and negatively related to adoption\npreference and cuteness in both studies. The effect sizes were not as large as in the\nmultivariate model, but were substantial nonetheless. One might argue that the negative\nrelationship between adoption preference and age is related to factors that are not related to\nfacial cues (e.g., increased probability of fostering an emotional bond/attachment or lower\nprobability of established behavioral problems). However, these factors do not explain why\nthere is a parallel drop in cuteness with age. Taken together, we believe that the reduction\nin adults' ratings of adoption preference and cuteness with stimulus age reflects a reduction\nin the elicitation of feelings related to parental care by older child faces.\nPut differently, it appears that adults may posses an evolved psychological\nmechanism that mobilizes parental investment during the developmental period when\nchildren would be most helpless and parent dependent. This mobilization would be\nimportant not just for parents of infants, but also \"allo-parents\" (Hrdy, 1999). Indeed, if\nyounger is cuter, infantile facial cues could facilitate the adoption of abandoned or\norphaned children by allo-parents. A parallel benefit in adopting younger children is that\nthe younger the adoption, the greater the opportunity for maternal- and familial-kinship\nimprinting (Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2007).\nThe relationship between age and health differed between the two studies. In the\nfirst study, there was a small negative relationship between age and health, while in the\nsecond study there was a small positive relationship. Combined, these two results suggest\nthat there is not a stable relationship in either direction between age and apparent health in\nchild and infant faces.\nOverall then, our results best fit the hypothesis that infantile (i.e., younger) faces are\ncuter and that adults prefer to care for younger children. The significant, large effect sizes\nargue strongly against the hypothesis that child facial cues either do not change\nsignificantly with age, or that the changes that do occur are not important to adults'\nperceptions and ratings. The hypothesis that adults prefer to older facial cues is also\nunlikely given the strong negative relationships between age and adoption preference/\ncuteness. Furthermore, the replication in the second study of these negative relationships in\nspite of the positive relationship between age and ratings of health argues against any adult\ntendency to prefer \"safer/healthier\" cues over cues of youth. Thus, our findings concur with\nHow then do we account for the disparate findings in support of the other theories?\nThe theory that age-related changes do not significantly influence how adults perceive and\nrespond to child facial cues was supported by findings from Sussman et al. (1983) and\nPittenger et al. (1989). All of these studies relied primarily on child stimuli from children\naged 6-12. There are likely fewer significant changes in physical appearance from ages 6-\n12 years than during the ages 6-72 months used in the current studies. The support of the\nhypothesis that adults would prefer to invest their resources in older children may also be\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\ndue to differences in the stimuli used. The findings of Horvath, Szmigelsky, and Fenton's\nresearch (1987) were based on facial illustrations that may represent not ecologically valid\nstimuli. Other findings of parenting that support increased investment in older children\n(e.g., Daly and Wilson's 1988 infanticide data) may reflect other parenting variables.\nIndeed, parenting is a complex task that typically involves a variety of concurrent\nmechanisms that influence parental care (Belsky, 1984). Child facial cues are likely to be\nonly one of many variables that influence parental investment. Other child traits, parental\ntraits, and environmental factors can all independently influence parenting in ways that are\ncontrary to the influence of facial cues (Belsky, 1984).\nThe average correlations between the independent variables corroborate the\nanalytical conclusions regarding age. The general similarities between the correlations at 6\nmonths and 6 years suggest that the age-related differences in adults' ratings are due to\nunderlying changes in the relationships between the variables. Of particular interest are the\nlarge correlations between adoption-health and cuteness-health. These correlations are of\nthe same order as the correlation between adoption-cuteness, yet health did not show the\nsame age-related changes as did the other two variables. This suggests the absence of a\ngeneral age mechanism that influences all the variables equally. This conclusion is\nstrengthened by the positive correlation between health ratings and age in Study 2.\nLimitations\nA potential limitation of our stimuli was the lack of very early infant photos. Infant\nfaces can undergo a dramatic change in appearance during the first weeks of life, and it\nwould be interesting to examine whether the negative relationship with age and adoption\npreference/cuteness also existed during these early weeks. A more general limitation of the\nstudy is the correlational nature of the Hypothetical Adoption Paradigm. Given that it is a\nproxy for feelings associated with parental care, one must be cautious about extending the\nfindings directly to actual parental behavior. All of the average ratings of adoption,\ncuteness, and health were greater than 3, with most greater than 4, meaning that there were\nno strongly negative ratings for any age group on any of the measures.\nConclusions\nWe found that adults' ratings of adoption preference and cuteness were strongly\nand negatively related to the age of the child, while there was no consistent relationship\nbetween age and adults' ratings of health. These changes do not appear to be due to\nchanges in the underlying relationships between the dependent variables. We believe that\nour use of a large number of photographic-quality stimuli from a dozen different children at\neight different ages offers substantial validity for the current results. Our results most\nstrongly support the hypothesis that facial cues associated with infancy or youth are most\neffective at eliciting adult responses related to parental care.\nThese results may have important theoretical and practical implications. From a\ntheoretical perspective, our results reinforce the theory that evolution operated to energize\nparental investment during developmental periods when children would be most helpless\nand parent dependent. From a practical perspective our results may be especially relevant\nfor adoption and foster care, especially when adults are first introduced to \"candidate\"\nchildren through photographs. Indeed, the increasing reliance on photographs by adoption\nagencies, including the use of online \"photo-catalogues\" (e.g., the Canadian province of\nPerceptions of Child Facial Cues\nAlberta or AdoptUSKids.com in the United States), illustrates the potential for facial cues\nto potentially influence critical parental decisions such as whether or not to adopt a child.\n"
