    "abstract": "Abstract\nWhether L1 (first language) rhetorical transfer affects L2 (second language) writing remains a controversial issue. Based\non Hyland's move theory, this article focuses on the moves and the quality of wrap-up sentences in essay conclusions,\nexploring the impact of L1 rhetorical transfer. One hundred eighty-four expository essays written by Chinese college\nstudents were analyzed, as well as 20 English and 20 Chinese model essays. Besides, sentence-initial discourse markers in 100\nChinese model essays were collected and categorized to investigate why Chinese teachers and students favor certain English\nlinking adverbials. The research results show that the Chinese students displayed their strategy use in Discourse Marker,\nConsolidation and Close, but the preference to certain sets of linking adverbials and Affirmation move can be attributed to\nthe L1 rhetorical transfer at lexical level and text level. In this study, L1 rhetorical transfer has been found to go hand in hand\nwith strategy use. For the students at tertiary level, strategy use might overweigh L1 rhetorical transfer.\n",

Rosenwasser and Stephen (2011) asserted\nthat the concluding part has social function of escorting the\nreaders to go out of the essay. Conclusion is invariably\nstressed in writing instruction and examinations. For exam-\nple, in the Test for English Majors Band 4 (TEM-4) and\nTEM-8 in China, a composition without a conclusion is\nregarded as incomplete and gets a lower score. Much research\nhas been conducted on the moves and discourse markers in\nthe conclusions of academic papers (Brunton, 2005; Dong,\nlack of published research on the conclusions of English as\nForeign Language (EFL) essays. And, fewer studies in EFL\nargumentative essays have addressed such aspects as moves,\nL1 rhetorical transfer, and proficiency level. Thus, the goal\nof this study is to fill the gap.\nConclusions of English Argumentative\nEssays\nSome studies analyze the concluding part in terms of moves.\nBhatia (1993) contended that a move is designed for the real-\nization of a specific goal and intention although the ultimate\ngoal of this move is to fulfill discourse communication.\nRosenwasser and Stephen (2011) proposed three moves in a\nconcluding part: accomplishing a full circle by revisiting the\nway an essay begins, pursuing implications by reasoning\nfrom the focus of the essay to broader issues, and identifying\nlimitations by acknowledging restrictions of method. Krusel\n(1992)dividedconclusionintotwomoves:InternalOutcomes\nand External Outcomes. The former summarizes discourse\ncontent whereas the latter is an extension of the central idea.\nAnalyzing 40 essays from newspapers, magazines, encyclo-\npedia, travel books and atlases, management textbooks, and\nacademic essays, Henry and Roseberry (1997) also proposed\ntwo moves in conclusion: Commitment to the Central Idea\nand Expansion.\nAll of those divisions can be dated back to Hyland (1990)\nwho divided Conclusion into four moves: Discourse Marker,\nConsolidation, Affirmation, and Close. The first three moves\ncorrespond to \"Commitment to the Central Idea\" (Henry &\nRosenwasser and Stephen's (2011) first move. Close is simi-\nlar to Rosenwasser and Stephen's last two moves, Krusel's\n1Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China\nCorresponding Author:\nDonghong Liu, English Department, School of Foreign Languages, Central\nEmail: liudonghong19@sina.com\nMoves and Wrap-Up Sentences in\nChinese Students' Essay Conclusions\nDonghong Liu1\n Keywords\nL1 rhetorical transfer, moves, wrap-up sentences, essay conclusions\n2 SAGE Open\n\"External Outcomes\" and Henry and Roseberry's \"Expan-\nsion.\" Hyland's classification is easier for researchers to\nidentify the moves.\n1. Discourse Marker is optional and the number of the\nexpressions serving as discourse markers is limited.\nThe frequently used expressions, such as in a word,\nin short, all in all, in conclusion, and in sum, signal\nthe closing of an essay.\n2. Consolidation is obligatory with its major function as\nreferring \"back to the content of the argument section\nto relate the themes of the argument stage with the\nthesis, the arguments, and the conclusion together.\nFor example,\n\nThus the quality of the graduates is improved and\nthe various sectors of the community are satisfied.\n3. Affirmation restates the thesis of an essay and\nechoes the introduction. This move is also optional\nand flexible because it may appear before or after the\nConsolidation move. For example,\n\nTo sum up, I strongly advise that more money\nshould be spent on the primary sector.\n4. Close move provides a prospective focus, in contrast\nto the retrospective function of Affirmation and\nConsolidation. It looks forward to unstated aspects of\nthe discussion by expanding the context, comment-\ning on the problem under discussion, and provoking\nthe readers to think. For example,\n\nThe future of the country will be jeopardized if\nnothing is done to improve this sector.\nIn this study, Hyland's classification is adopted, with\nConsolidation and Affirmation regarded as wrap-up sen-\ntences that summarize the whole essay. Rosenwasser and\nStephen (2011) also emphasized this part and they called it\n\"culmination\" (p. 187), to put it mundanely, bringing together\nthings already said and ascending to one final statement.\nAlthough much has been discussed about the conclusion of\nan academic paper, related empirical studies on the conclu-\nsion of an EFL argumentative essay is scarce. As Hyland\n(2009) put it, \"the essay is regarded as a key acculturation\npractice\" (p. 132) for the EFL learners. In view of the impor-\ntance of the conclusion of EFL argumentative essay, much\nresearch on this genre is needed.\nL1 Rhetorical Transfer\nTransfer occurs when learning in one context or with one set\nof materials influences performance in another context or\ntransfer as the influence resulting from the similarities and\ndifferences between the target language and any other lan-\nguage that has been previously acquired. The transfer can be\nmanifested as facilitation, avoidance, and overuse. L1 knowl-\nedge across all layers of language can influence L2 solutions\ntransfer is more conspicuous at lexical and text levels than at\ngrammatical level. Accordingly, this article focuses on the\ntwo levels.\nRhetorical mode may also be reflected at lexical level,\nsyntactic level, and text level. Kaplan (2001) first pointed out\nthe transfer of L1 text organization into L2 English composi-\ntions. Subsequently, many studies have analyzed English\narticles written by native English speakers and the ESL\nlearners. They have found that native English speakers are\nmore direct and take a linear style in discourse composing\nwhereas non-native English speakers such as Chinese,\nJapanese, Korean, and Indonesian students use a more indi-\nrect and circular style because of their L1 rhetorical modes\nMore studies have been carried out at the lexical level,\nespecially linking adverbials. Mohamed-Sayidina (2010)\nanalyzed 50 academic papers and stated that EFL Arab stu-\ndents transfer Arabic rhetorical modes of propositional\ndevelopment (realized by additive transition words) into\ntheir English compositions. The number of additive transi-\ntion words is significantly greater than the number of adver-\nsative, temporal, or causative transitions. At the sentential\nlevel, the number of additive transitions is significantly\ngreater than the number of adversative or causative transi-\ninvestigated the effect of L1 Chinese on the use of English\ndiscourse markers. The results showed that the L1 Chinese\nspeakers using I think in medial or final position may have\ntransferred from their L1 wo juede, that the use of yeah/yes\nmay be transferred from the corresponding Chinese expres-\nsion dui, and that ah was found to perform a clause-medial\nfunction.\nHowever, other studies that focused on the rhetorical\ndifferences between L1 and L2 writings do not treat L1 rhe-\ntorical transfer as one of the causes. For example, Lei\n(2012) investigated the use of linking adverbials in the\nChinese doctoral students'academic writing. By comparing\n20 applied linguistic doctoral dissertations and 120 pub-\nlished articles written by professionals, he reported that 33\nlinking adverbials were overused by the doctoral students,\namong which were the summative adverbials such as\n\"therefore,\" \"to sum up,\" \"in a word,\" \"in summary,\" and\n\"so.\" Meanwhile, 25 adverbials, especially adversative\nones, were underused. The doctoral students relied more\nheavily on a limited set of linking adverbials than the pro-\nfessional writers. Leedham and Cai (2014) compared the\nChinese and British students' writing in U.K. universities\nand confirmed that a key area of difference was the Chinese\nstudents' higher use of informal sentence-initial linking\nadverbials (e.g., besides, on the other hand). The research-\ners argued that the Chinese students were primed to use\ncertain linking adverbials by the secondary school teaching\nmaterials and book-focused teaching approach (Milton &\nuse instead of L1 rhetorical transfer that caused the Chinese\nstudent writers to use more linking adverbials. Whether L1\nrhetorical transfer affects L2 writing remains a controver-\nsial issue and more studies are needed. In addition, up to\ndate few studies have analyzed further why Chinese teachers\nand book writers select certain linking adverbials and why\nChinese students prefer the limited set of linking adverbials\nto other forms. This article intends to address the gap, with\nthe focus narrowed to essay conclusions.\nResearch Method\nResearch Questions\nThe impact of transfer might involve \"efficacy (e.g., the\nquality of a student's work), efficiency (e.g., the speed of a\nstudent's work), or approach (e.g., the procedure a student\nuses)\" (James, 2014, p. 2). In view of the significance of con-\nclusion and the questions unanswered in previous studies,\nthis article focuses on moves and quality of wrap-up sen-\ntences, exploring \"approach\" and \"efficacy.\" The following\nquestions are raised:\nResearch Question 1: Does L1 rhetorical mode influence\nthe use of moves in the L2 essay conclusions?\nResearch Question 2: Does L1 rhetorical mode affect the\nquality of wrap-up sentences?\nParticipants and Writing Task\nNinety-four undergraduates at three year levels participated in\nthis study. All of them majored in English Language and\nLiterature in the English department of a university in central\nChina. \"English Writing\" was a compulsory course for English\nmajors in the first 2 years in all the universities in China. In\nthis study, both the first-year group (30 students) and the sec-\nond-year group (31 students) were taking this course. Both the\ngroups were the students of two classes taught by the same\nteacher, the author of this article. The third-year group (33 stu-\ndents) had already finished the writing course (once taught by\nthe same teacher) when they participated in this study. They\nwere the students of a Comprehensive English class, another\ncompulsory course. All the participants had at least learned\nabout English exposition. The participants of the same group\nhad similar learning experience as they all entered the univer-\nsity right from high school.\nIn this study, they were asked to write two essays with\nprompts within 40 min. The essay prompts were modeled\non such standardized tests as the TEM-4 and TEM-8 for the\npurpose of eliciting essays in the rhetorical mode of exposi-\ntion. One essay had a restricted topic and the other had an\nopen topic. Prompts of the two essays are as follows:\nEssay 1: Recently, a survey carried out by a consulting\ncompany reveals that by the end of 2007, the percentage\nof the netizens shopping online has reached 50.4% and\n45.1% respectively in Shanghai and Beijing.\nWrite a composition of about 200 words on the following\ntopic: Advantages of Shopping Online\nEssay 2: It's quite popular in colleges in China that stu-\ndents give evaluation to teachers when finishing certain\ncourses. Some say it is good to both teachers' work and\nstudents' academic study, while others believe it does\nharm to the teacher-student relationship. What's your\nopinion?\nWrite a composition of about 200 words on the following\ntopic: Students'Evaluation of Teachers\nThe first-year group and the second-year group were asked\nto finish the two writing tasks in class as their course work.\nThey would get feedback from the teacher later about the\nadvantages and weak points of their essays and some sugges-\ntions for revision. The third-year group did the essay writing\nin their Comprehensive English class because they had no\nEnglish Writing course and Comprehensive English also\ninvolved writing. The third-year students were preparing for\nTEM-8, and they were eager to get some feedback and sug-\ngestions for essay writing. So they were cooperative in this\nstudy. However, two students failed to hand in both the essays,\nthus excluding the them; the third-year group consisted of 31\nstudents. Altogether 184 essays were collected.\nData Collection and Analysis\nData collection of the participants' essays includes three\naspects: presence of concluding paragraph, moves, and\nwrap-up sentences. Specific criteria have been established.\nA. Presence of concluding paragraph\nB. Moves (presence of a move gets 1 point; absence gets 0)\n1.Discourse Marker:\nDiscourse markers may be of various types and there is no\nagreement as to how to identify them. But in this study only\nsentence-initial linking adverbials called \"lexical teddy\nreason that those words are listed in the textbooks and refer-\nence materials and the impact of the teaching materials leads\nto the Chinese students' high use of those linking adverbials\nup, in conclusion, in a word.\n4 SAGE Open\n2.Affirmation:\nIt is the restatement of thesis. In the following example, the\nfirst sentence is Affirmation, which emphasizes the benefits\nof traveling abroad and echoes the thesis in the introduction.\nAll of this being said, traveling abroad, without doubt, is\nbeneficial and helpful. Whether you want to have a rest or you\nintend to broaden your horizon, traveling abroad is a good\nchoice. What are you waiting for, if both time and money\npermitting? I wager that you can gain a lot from it and will\nnever regret making this decision.\n3.Consolidation:\nThis move summarizes all the claims that support the thesis\nstatement. In the above example, the sentence \"Whether you\nwant to have a rest or you intend to broaden your horizon,\nobviously,travelingabroadisagoodchoice\"isConsolidation,\nwhich summarizes two claims in the essay. If Affirmation\nand Consolidation appear in the same sentence, both of the\nmoves are counted in.\nIn this study, the sentences that cannot be categorized into\nthe previous three moves are counted as Close.\nC. Quality of wrap-up sentences\nWrap-up sentences consist ofAffirmation and Consolidation,\nwhich summarize the whole essay. The quality of wrap-up\nsentences is investigated in terms of the two moves. The\nhighest score of the quality is 5 and the lowest is 0. The\nfollowing shows the specific criteria:\ni. The presence of Affirmation wins 1 point. If there is\nany variation in words or syntactic structures differ-\nent from the thesis statement, another 0.5 is added.\nii. The presence of Consolidation wins 1 point. If there\nis any variation in words or syntactic structures dif-\nferent from the topic sentences, another 0.5 is added.\niii. If either Affirmation or Consolidation can summarize\nthe essay, 1 point is added. If both of the two moves\ncan summarize the essay, still only 1 point is added.\nBut if the sentences are only repetition of the thesis\nstatement or the topic sentences, 0 point is added.\niv. If Affirmation or Consolidation can not only summa-\nrize the essay but also bears no serious error at gram-\nmatical or lexical level, another 0.5 is added. Here\nserious errors mean those that hinder reading and\ncomprehension. Spelling mistakes are neglected.\nv. If Affirmation or Consolidation bears no errors and\nsummarizes the essay at a higher level such as using\nmetaphor and superordinates, another 0.5 is added.\nTo identify the impact of L1 rhetorical transfer, the con-\nclusions of Chinese model essays were compared with\nthose of the English counterparts. The English model essays\nwere selected from two English writing textbooks pub-\nlished in China and available in many bookstores. They\nwere College Writing Skills With Readings (Langan, 2011)\nand The College Writer (Kanar, 2011). In the former\ntextbook, 14 expositions written by the English speaking\nstudents were selected, and in the latter 6 were included. To\nget the same number of Chinese model essays of the same\ngenre written by Chinese counterparts, a Chinese essay\nbook comprising 500 expository model essays was used,\ncompiled by Jiangping Xiong (2011) for high school stu-\ndents to prepare for the National Matriculation Entrance\nTests (NMET). The Chinese model essays were selected at\nrandom from the very beginning of the book, with every\nfifth essay used as the target essay for analysis. In addition,\nfor the purpose of investigating, the Chinese frequently\nused discourse markers, the first 100 essays written on 24\ntopics were selected from Xiong's book. In this study, only\nthe sentence-initial discourse markers in the concluding\nparts were collected and categorized.\nThe author of this article identified the moves and eval-\nuated the quality of wrap-up sentences for two times, with\nan interval of 2 months. The final score of each wrap-up\nsentence is the average of the two scores. Qualitative and\nquantitative analyses were used in data analysis. In quanti-\ntative analyses, non-parametric statistical comparisons\nwere used because the move numbers and the scores of the\nwrap-up sentence quality were not normally distributed.\nKruskal-Wallis tests were used as a measure of the differ-\nences among the three groups of participants. Wilcoxon\nSigned Rank tests were used for topic effect of the two\nessays. Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the\nmoves of English and Chinese model essays.\nResearch Results\nMoves\nIn this study, nearly all the essays had concluding paragraphs,\nwith an exception of one in the third-year group, one in the\nsecond-year group, and another one in the first-year group.\nThe three groups displayed differences in the number of\nmoves in Table 1. The total moves of the first-year group\n(158) reached the highest as well as their number of Discourse\nMarker (49). As for Affirmation, the three groups approxi-\nmate in number. But it is a different case in Consolidation\nwhere the first-year group produced far less frequency than\nthe other two groups. The last move Close was also charac-\nterized by the gap between the first-year group and the other\ntwo groups; however, the first-year group predominated in\nnumber. The frequencies of the moves can be sequenced as\nfollows:\nTotal: Affirmation > Discourse Marker > Close >\nConsolidation\nThird-year group: Affirmation > Discourse Marker >\nConsolidation > Close\nSecond-year group: Affirmation > Discourse Marker >\nClose = Consolidation\nFirst-year group: Discourse Marker >Affirmation > Close\n> Consolidation\nTable 1 also provides the percentages of moves in each\ngroup, and Figure 1 demonstrates the development tendency\nof each move. Close presents a clear tendency of decline,\nwhereas Consolidation displays a rising tendency. However,\nAffirmation almost keeps a horizontal line. Discourse Marker\nhas a V-shaped curved line. The three groups were compared\nin the mean frequency of each kind of moves and submitted\nto Kruskal-Wallis tests (k independent samples). All the\nmoves except Affirmation had significant difference among\nthe three groups. The results corroborate the tendencies in\nFigure 1 and provide an explanation for the even and smooth\nline of Affirmation.\nTable 2 shows the result of comparison of the total move\nnumbers between the two essays. Each group demonstrates\nquite approximate mean move numbers in the two essays.\nThe Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests show no significant differ-\nence between the two essays.\nThree kinds of Close--appealing, solution, and prediction\nor expectation--are found in this study. Example 1 has a typi-\ncal prediction Close. In Example 2, the second clause that is\nsupposed to be a separate sentence is a typical pattern of\nappealing Close. The Close in Example 3 displays solution.\nExample 1: In conclusion, I believe that shopping online\nis a general trend. With the development of economic and\ntechnology, more and more people will use shopping\nonline in future.\nExample 2: Briefly, students' evaluation is good for both,\nwhy don't we keep and develop it?\nExample 3: So, the starting point of Student Evaluation of\nTeachers is good, but it's very hard to implement. Students\nand teachers should strengthen communication in the\nusual teaching to improve the quality of teaching.\nAll the discourse markers used in the student essays\nexcept \"above all\" can be categorized into three groups:\nGroup 1 summarizing ideas: in a word, all in all, to sum\nup, in short, in summary, generally speaking, summarily\nGroup 2 expressing ideas: as far as I am concerned, in my\nview, in my opinion\nGroup 3 inferring results: in conclusion, to draw a\nconclusion, therefore, so\nEach group has corresponding Chinese expressions that\nare common in Chinese essays, although in most cases,\nChinese discourse markers are scarcely used. It is supported\nby the result of the analysis of the Chinese model essays. By\nanalyzing the concluding parts, we found 21 essays carrying\nsentence-initial discourse markers in their concluding parts.\nThree Chinese discourse markers in five conclusions--\"zong\nzhi (all in all, to sum up, in summary),\" \"zui hou yi ju hua (in\na word),\" and \"zong de lai shuo (in a word)\"--fall into the\nfirst group summarizing ideas. Another three discourse\nmarkers in five conclusions belong to the second group\nexpressing ideas: \"wo ren wei (I think),\" \"wo xiang xin\n(I believe),\" and \"wo xiang (I think).\" The third group infer-\nring results include four discourse markers appearing in 11\nTable 1.

Percentage means\nthe portion of each move against the 20 essays. Neither the\nEnglish nor the Chinese essays carry many discourse mark-\ners in the conclusions. However, there's great disparity in\nAffirmation and Consolidation between the two kinds of\nessays. But Close is lavishly used in both kinds of essays,\nespecially in the Chinese model ones. Mann-Whitney tests\n(two independent samples) only show significant differences\nin Affirmation and Consolidation.\nWrap-Up Sentences\nThe wrap-up sentence quality of each group was compared\nbetween the two essays to test topic effect. None of the\nresults of Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests was statistically sig-\nnificant (see Table 5). It can also be seen from Table 5 that\nthe third-year group could write much better wrap-up sen-\ntences than the first-year group, with the second-year group\nin between. Kruskal-Wallis test (k independent samples)\nshowed significant difference in both essays. No significant\ndifference between the two essays was found by Wilcoxon\nSigned Rank tests. Displaying the developmental process of\nthe Chinese EFL learners, the result corroborates and justi-\nfies our classification of the groups.\nExamples 4, 5, and 6 manifest the wrap-up sentences of\ndifferent quality and the difference of developmental stages.\n\"TS\" in the examples means Topic Sentence. Example 4 has\nboth Affirmation (1 point) and Consolidation (1 point). The\nwords in the two moves differ from the three topic sentences\n(1 point). The moves, especially Consolidation can summa-\nrize the ideas in the essay (1 point). The writer used \"go\nshopping both effectively and efficiently\" to encapsulate the\nabove three paragraphs. In fact, the summarization is at a\nhigher level (0.5 point). There's no syntactic or lexical error\nExample 4: (TS1) Firstly, the price of the goods is reason-\nable and acceptable . . .\n(TS2) Secondly, shopping online is a time-saving\nalternative . . .\n(TS3) Thirdly, it is convenient to us to shop online . . .\nAll in all, shopping online is a practical way for us to do\nour purchase (Affirmation). We can go shopping both\neffectively and efficiently (Consolidation; 5 points, third-\nyear group).\nExample (5) has only Consolidation (1 point) as wrap-up\nsentence, which can cover the ideas in the essay (0.5\npoint) with the wording totally different from the topic\nTable 3.

But\nthere is much lexical repetition and an error--convenience.\nThe whole conclusion is too simple in idea.\nExample (6) (TS1) As the internet fast developing, the\nelectronic commerce had already walk into everyone's\nroutine, especially for our young people, who always\nfollows the fashion . . .\n(TS2) Shopping is no more than convenience, it can help\nyou save a lot of money as well . . .\nSo, as far as I am concerned, shopping online is not only\nconvenience, fashionable, but also save you a lot of\nmoney (Consolidation; 1.5 points, first-year group).\nDiscussion\nDiscourse markers are not encouraged or widely used in\nChinese model essays or in English model essays (see\nTable 4). However, more than half of the essays written by\nthe participants in this study have this move. That cannot be\nattributed to L1 transfer. Instead, strategy use may be a caus-\ning factor. Because all the participants had learned English\nexpository writing, the teachers' instruction to help them\npass the exams might impress them greatly. They tend to use\nsuch strategies to connect the paragraphs and add more\nwords to their essays. Moreover, in Figure 1, Discourse\nMarker displays a V-shaped curved line. The second-year\ngroup displayed a decrease in this move. It is speculated that\nthese participants might be tired of those \"lexical teddy\nbears\" and tried to reject them in writing. The third-year\ngroup was preparing for the TEM-8 test and was ready to\ntake the strategy for examination, hence more Discourse\nMarker moves appeared in their writing.\nIn Discourse Marker move, linking adverbials are over-\nused by the first-year group, which contributes to the highest\ntotal number of the moves (81.67%). The English linking\nadverbials used by the Chinese student writers have counter-\nparts in the Chinese essays (see Table 3), and once the\nChinese writers choose to use discourse markers in their\nChinese conclusions, they almost always use those three-\ngroup sentence-initial adverbials. Many researchers attribute\nthe high use of particular linking adverbials to the English\nteaching materials and book-focused teaching approach\n2010). However, theirs might be a surficial reason. As must\nbe emphasized, those Chinese equivalent adverbials are\nmuch more formal in style than the English adverbials. Even\nthe teachers may not be fully aware of the difference. To\nillustrate, whereas \"in a word\" is viewed as an informal link-\ning adverbial (Leedham & Cai, 2014), its Chinese equivalent\njian yan zhi or zong zhi in many dictionaries (e.g., You Dao,\none of the most popular web dictionaries with Chinese col-\nlege students) is fairly formal due to its ancient style. The L1\nrhetorical mode is so deeply rooted in the L1 writing that the\nthree-group linking adverbials are recommended and empha-\nsized by the teachers and preferred by the students. The con-\ncepts of the Chinese linking adverbials and their usage may\nbe transferred into English. It can be followed that the L1\nrhetorical mode \"primed\" the teachers and the students to\nselect those three-group sentence-initial adverbials. For the\nless proficient student writers, it is much easier to transfer\nfrom L1 the concepts of those linking adverbials and memo-\nrize the English counterparts than to create ideas and to\nproduce English sentences. Moreover, they prefer to clutter\nthe text with too many linking adverbials so as to achieve\nAlthough the high use of certain sets of linking adverbials\nis possibly L1 rhetorical transfer revealed at lexical level, at\ntextual level, the reason why Affirmation is greatly embraced\nby the three groups may also be attributed to the Chinese\nconsidered it as optional. Affirmation move corresponds to\nargumentation, which is usually required of the concluding\npart but optional in the introduction. The comparison between\nthe English and the Chinese model essays shows the great\ndisparity in the use of Affirmation move. The Chinese model\nessay writers prefer this typical Chinese rhetorical mode.\nAccording to L1 transfer theory, \"L1 knowledge can inhibit\ncertain L2 choices and prime others, thus resulting in the\nunderuse or overuse of certain L2 forms in spoken and written\nlearner production\" (Ortega, 2009, p. 41). The research result\nof the participants' essays reveals that Affirmation is the\nobvious transfer of L1 rhetorical mode at all proficiency levels,\nbecause the participants' knowledge about Affirmation in\nChinese writing primed the high frequency in their English\nwriting. Moreover, for the less proficient writers,Affirmation\nis easier to produce than Consolidation and Close, for they\ncan at least repeat their thesis statements (if any in the intro-\nduction) to create final paragraphs and make their essays\nlonger.\nConsolidation was considered by Hyland (1990) as an\nobligatory move that is supported by the investigation of\n8 SAGE Open\nEnglish model essays in this study (see Table 4). Ninety per-\ncent of the English model essays have such a move. However,\nConsolidation is rare in Chinese essays. Consolidation finds\nno position in Chinese writing. Any words referring back to\nthe previous arguments are regarded as redundant and too\nexplicit for the readers to explore the implication. What is\nabsent in L1 possibly leads to underuse in L2 writing or\nspeaking. It is not strange to find that the first-year group\nused much fewer Consolidation moves. Contrarily, as more\nproficient writers, the second-year group and especially\nthe third-year group used more Consolidation moves. They\nwere fully aware of the importance of Consolidation and\nwere more skillful at using this move as a strategy to deal\nwith examinations. The increase of the number indicated the\nrising awareness and practice of the writing strategy leading\nto typical English writing.\nClose is another instance of strategy use. The typical types\nof Close such as appealing, solution, and expectation or pre-\ndiction are greatly encouraged to utilize in Chinese essays\nand much importance is attached to florid, ornamental, and\nshows that not only the Chinese model essays but also the\nEnglish ones favor this move. L2 learners tend to use a lin-\nguistic phenomenon existing in both L1 and L2 (Ortega,\n2009). The first-year group found no difficulty applying\nClose in their English essays. Nevertheless, the L1 rhetorical\ntransfer seemed mitigated in the second-year and the third-\nyear groups. The number of Close was inversely proportional\nto the proficiency level. The more proficient the students\nwere, the more they want to abandon it and find other chal-\nlenging ways to end their essays. They might concentrate on\nimproving the quality of Consolidation and Affirmation, thus\nthe efficacy of their work may be their major concern.\nTherefore, strategy use played a more important role, which\noverweighed the transfer of L1 rhetorical mode.\nOur speculation is supported by the result of comparison of\nwrap-up sentence quality among the three groups in Table 5.\nOn one hand, the quality of wrap-up sentences requires reca-\npitulating ability. The three groups displayed significant dif-\nference in the quality of wrap-up sentences, which increased\nwith the proficiency level. The first-year group in this study\nhad difficulty in substituting superordinate words for specific\nideas and in using synonyms to avoid monotonous lexical rep-\netition. Apart from that, their lack of ability to clearly convey\nideas might be another cause of the inefficacy of recapitula-\ntion, as can be seen in Example 5.The causes of the first-year\ngroup's poor ability of summarizing texts were different from\nthose of the young native speakers of English who could not\nidentify important text information (Brown & Day, 1983;\nWinograd, 1984). On the other hand, the more important cause\nmay be strategy use. The second-year group and the third-\nyear group allocated more attention to Affirmation and\nConsolidation so as to improve the unity and coherence of\ntheir essays. The third-year group, especially, had higher\nawareness of Consolidation and quality of the move.\nConclusion\nWith moves and wrap-up sentences as the major concern,\nthis study has explored the developmental process of the\nChinese EFL learners in terms of L1 rhetorical transfer at\nlexical level and text level. L1 rhetorical transfer is a compli-\ncated issue that cannot be studied regardless of other factors.\nL1 rhetorical transfer has been found to go hand in hand with\nstrategy use in this study. The findings may be summarized\nas follows:\n1. The Chinese students displayed their strategy use in\nDiscourse Marker move because they used a far\ngreater number of linking adverbials than the\nChinese model essay writers. But the preference to\ncertain sets of linking adverbials can be attributed\nto the L1 rhetorical transfer at lexical level. The\nstudents at all proficiency levels preferred to\nuse Affirmation, which may be ascribed to L1\nrhetorical transfer at text level. Consolidation, a\ntypical English move, demonstrated an increasing\ntendency with the proficiency level improving,\nwhereas Close displayed a decline although this\nmove is encouraged in both English and Chinese\nessays. The two phenomena have little to do with\nL1 rhetorical transfer. Strategy use can be a major\ncause.\n2. Strategy use can also be seen in the quality of wrap-\nup sentences. Consolidation move, which played a\nkey role in the efficacy evaluation, was superior not\nonly in quantity but also in quality in the essays of\nmore proficient students. These students allocated\nmore time and attention to the quality of wrap-up\nsentences at the cost of Close move. It can be seen\nthat for the students at tertiary level, strategy use\nmight overweigh L1 rhetorical transfer.\nAlthough the current data cannot be conclusive about\nperformance of all L1 Chinese EFL learners, the study is\naimed at providing a suggestive picture of how Chinese\nrhetorical mode influences English expository writing.\nHowever, this study has some limitations. It can be noted\nthat the line of Discourse Marker in Figure 1 is not smooth\nbecause the second-year group produced fewer linking\nadverbials in Discourse Marker move than the other two\ngroups. Although there's slight difference between the sec-\nond-year and the third-year groups, yet some reasons might\nlie behind. Confined to text analysis, this study failed to\nidentify the specific reasons. Text-based interviews would\nbe useful in qualitative study and would be used in future\nstudies in this area.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBhatia, V.
