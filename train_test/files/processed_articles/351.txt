Dishman (rdishman@uga.edu)\nThe brain controls behavior in widely varying environmental\ncircumstances. This control includes conscious decisions and\nless conscious drives or urges that are influenced by inherent\nand acquired traits, each of which are shaped by learning and\nmemories of reinforcement history, by genes and by devel-\nopmental, social, and environmental factors that alter gene\nexpression. Brain neural circuits that regulate feeding, mood,\npleasure, pain, memories about the reward and punishment of\nbehavior, and cognitions such as liking, wanting, and decision\nmaking for appetitive behaviors have been elaborated (1\u00ad4).\nIn contrast, little is known about how genes, the environ-\nment, and their interactions influence the brain's regulation of\n\nphysical activity behavior.\nFamily and twin studies have reported that 30\u00ad70% of the\nvariation in human physical activity is inherited (5\u00ad8), and a\nfew association and linkage studies have implicated candidate\ngenes that might explain small, but significant, portions of that\nvariation (9). Features of this small literature suggest that four\nkey issues be addressed during the search for gene\u00adenviron-\nment interactions that affect physical activity behavior: (i) the\nneed to exploit and elaborate current understanding of puta-\ntive mediators and moderators of voluntary physical activity,\n(ii) selection of candidate genes, (iii) measurement of physi-\ncal activity, and (iv) multilevel statistical modeling of personal,\nenvironmental, and genetic influences on physical activity\nchange across time.\nMediators and Moderators of Physical Activity\nAlthough emerging animal and human studies suggest that\ngenetic variation explains a substantial amount of physical\nactivity, most of the variation in physical activity will be ulti-\nmately determined by personal choices and environmental\nopportunities or their interactions. Studies have not yet exam-\nined whether genetic variation in physical activity (i) occurs\nindependently of putative mediators and moderators of physi-\ncal activity, (ii) modifies (i.e., interacts with) the association\nof physical activity with those factors, or (iii) is explainable by\ncommon genetic variation in physical activity and select medi-\nators or moderators (e.g., pleiotropic effects).\nAbout 50 different behavioral correlates of physical activ-\nity have been reported among youths and adults (10,11).\nPutative moderators and mediators of interventions designed\nto increase physical activity include personal factors that influ-\nence decisions to be active, such as self-efficacy, perceived\nbehavioral control, attitude, enjoyment, social norms, and\nperceptions of social support and access to physical activ-\nity settings. Personality appears to be weakly associated with\nphysical activity (12,13), but it plausibly could influence spon-\ntaneous physical activity or moderate and help explain gene\u00ad\nenvironment influences on exercise behavior. In addition, real\nand perceived features of social and physical environments\noperate at the levels of families, schools, places of employment,\nand neighborhoods, which are all located within communities,\nto influence physical activity. Figure 1 illustrates these theo-\nrized relations and interactions.\nSocial-cognitive variables (i.e., beliefs that are formed by\nsocial learning and reinforcement history) are influences\non self-initiated change in health behaviors such as physical\nactivity (14). Self-efficacy is a belief in personal capabilities to\norganize and execute the courses of action required to attain a\nGene\u00adPhysical Activity Interactions in the\nEtiology of Obesity: Behavioral Considerations\nRod K. Dishman1\nUnderstanding how genes, environment, and personal motivation operate to influence physical activity will require\n(i) inclusion of properly validated measures of putative mediators (e.g., cultural values, efficacy and control beliefs,\ngoals, intentions, enjoyment, and self-management skills) and moderators (e.g., age or maturation, personality, race/\nethnicity, fitness, fatness, skill, and competing behaviors) of physical activity, (ii) a search for candidate genes involved\nwith motivational systems of energy expenditure in addition to energy intake pathways, (iii) assessment of specific\nfeatures physical activity exposure (i.e., type, intensity, timing, and context), (iv) manipulation of physical activity or\nprospective observation of change in physical activity at multiple times, rather than cross-sectional association and\nlinkage studies, and (v) use of statistical procedures that permit multilevel modeling (i.e., personal and group-level\nvariables) of direct, indirect (i.e., mediated), and moderated (i.e., interactions of mediators with external factors)\nrelations with physical activity within theoretical gene\u00adenvironment networks.\narticles\nperceived access and actual proximity to physical activity set-\ntings have direct relations with physical activity and/or indirect\nrelations moderated or mediated by social-cognitive factors\nsuch as social support and efficacy beliefs about overcoming\nbarriers to physical activity has not been determined. Although\nsocial networks may link physical activity habits in ways simi-\nlar to those hypothesized for obesity (19), it is also possible that\nsocial affiliations have, to some extent, a genetic basis. Hence,\ngenes might commonly influence features of both social affili-\nation and physical activity.\nCandidate Genes\nLike obesity, physical activity surely represents a complex,\nmultifactorial trait influenced mainly by polygenes that each\nexplain small portions (~1%) of the variance in physical activ-\nity. However, in contrast to the literature on obesity in which\nat least 22 genes have been supported by at least five studies\n(20), less than 10 association studies (9) and two linkage stud-\nies (21,22) have examined candidate genes for physical activity,\nwithout much replication of results.\nMost candidate genes for physical activity suggested by link-\nage or association studies have been selected for study based\non understanding of energy intake pathways that influence\nenergy balance (e.g., LEPR, AGRP, MC4R) (9,22) more so than\nmodels of otherwise motivated behavior (21,23). However,\nsome genes that have been studied (e.g., DRD2, DRD4, SERT,\n5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, Orexin A) might be involved in regulation\nof motivation systems for both feeding and physical activity.\nEvidence has been mixed as to whether alleles of SERT and\nDRD4 genes explain variations in personality (e.g., novelty\nseeking and extraversion) (e.g., 24\u00ad26), which plausibly could\nexplain a portion of leisure or spontaneous physical activity.\nNeurobiological regulation of physical activity by the cen-\ntral nervous system is poorly understood and has been mainly\nstudied in order to model opioid regulation of anorexigenic\nrunning (27) and to understand central fatigue (i.e., a pro-\ngressive decline in supraspinal motor drive to motor neurons)\nduring exhaustive exercise (28,29) and prolonged, strenu-\nous exercise under conditions of hypoxia, hyperthermia, and\nincreased brain serotonin activity, elevated ammonia levels,\nbrain glycogen depletion, decreased striatal dopamine (DA),\nand inhibitory feedback from the exercising muscles.\nIn contrast to the study of factors that limit skeletal muscle\ncontrol of locomotion under conditions of impairment, the\nneurobiological regulation of voluntary, nonstrenuous physical\nbehavioral goal. Like self-efficacy, perceived behavioral control\nincludes efficacy beliefs about internal factors (e.g., skills, abili-\nties, and self-motivation or willpower) and external factors\n(e.g., time, opportunity, obstacles, and dependence on other\npeople) that are imposed on behavior. Each construct is dis-\ntinguishable from outcome expectancy, which is the perceived\nlikelihood that performing a behavior will result in a specific\noutcome. Although people are more likely to form an inten-\ntion to behave when they value an expected outcome of the\nbehavior (i.e., they have a positive attitude), that likelihood is\nincreased when a goal is set. People who set goals about being\nmore active and who are dissatisfied with their current activity\nlevel will be more likely to adopt physical activity, especially if\nthey possess high self-efficacy about their ability to be physi-\ncally active (15). Like perceived behavioral control, self-effi-\ncacy affects behavior directly and also indirectly by influencing\nintentions. Efficacy beliefs can affect physical activity both\ndirectly by fostering self-management (16) and indirectly by\ninfluencing perceptions about sociocultural environments that\nprovide assistance for physical activity which in turn directly\ninfluence physical activity (17). Self-efficacy can also moderate\nthe relation between perceptions of social facilitators and phys-\nical activity change. Thus, beliefs in personal ability to over-\ncome barriers to physical activity can sustain physical activity\ndespite perceptions of declining social support of physical\nactivity (18). Although beliefs are learned, genes might influ-\nence historical adaptations to exercise or success in physical\nactivity settings so that contemporary relations between genes\nand physical activity might plausibly be explained by an inter-\naction between genes, biological adaptability to exercise, and\nbeliefs. Figure 2 shows a hypothetical gene\u00adphysical activity\ninteraction whereby genes and people's exercise goals, or their\ninteraction, might explain exercise adherence directly, or indi-\nrectly by influencing adaptability to exercise training.\nCross-sectional studies have found that self-reports and\nobjective measures from geographic information systems of\nthe social and built environments (e.g., neighborhood safety\nand facility accessibility) are weak correlates of physical activ-\nity and overweight among population-based samples.

Neurons that contain orexin A project\nfrom caudal hypothalamic areas throughout the neuroaxis and\nappear to enhance spontaneous physical activity, in part by\ninhibiting hypothalamic GABA release and stimulating or syn-\nergizing with DA signaling in the striatum (49) or by possibly\nmodulating GABA\nA\ninhibition of the accumbens (50). Orexin-\ncontaining neurons in the VTA appear directly involved in opi-\noid-dependent appetitive behavior and increased locomotion\nby activation of the meso-limbic dopamine pathway between\nthe VTA and the accumbens (51), possibly by potentiation of\nglutamate-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor\u00admediated\nneurotransmission(52).Chronicactivitywheelrunningappears\nto downregulate the striatal GABA\nA\nresponse after open-field\nlocomotion (53) and has a neurotrophic effect in the VTA (54).\nWheel and treadmill running (55,56) also increase gene expres-\nsion for brain galanin which helps regulate feeding and may\nalso play a role in modulation of the dopaminergic meso-limbic\nsystem. Galanin expression is not sensitive to other forms of\nstress, which can permanently upregulate expression of some\nHPA axis genes (57), but possible epigenetic effects of physical\nactivity have not received much study.\nMeasurement of Physical Activity\nPhysical activity is bodily movement produced by contrac-\ntion of skeletal muscles that results in varying amounts and\nrates of energy expenditure that are positively related to physi-\ncal fitness and health depending upon the stimulus features\nof physical activity such as its type, intensity, regularity and\ntiming. Among humans, physical activity can be spontaneous\nand sporadic (e.g., leisure play or fidgeting) or purposeful and\nrepetitive (e.g., jobs, chores, organized sports, or exercise per-\nformed with the goal of improving or maintaining physical fit-\nness, function or health).\nMost studies have used self-reports of physical activity.\nFewer, more recent studies have used standardized obser-\nvational systems or objective monitoring by accelerometry\n(e.g., 21). Although some self-report measures have been vali-\ndated by demonstrating correlations with objective measures,\nthose correlations are typically modest, accounting for <30%\nshared variance. Self-report measures of physical activity used\nin observational, population-based association studies gener-\nally were designed to categorize or rank people according to\nfrequency of physical activity or total energy expenditure esti-\nmated crudely by metabolic equivalents (i.e., METh) rather\nthan to assess specific features of physical activity such as type,\nintensity, and timing that are important for understanding the\ndirection, effort, and persistence of human motivation. Self-\nreport measures of physical activity used in studies of human\ngene cohorts have been too crude to distinguish spontaneous\nphysical activity (e.g., fidgeting or pacing about) from other lei-\nsure or purposeful physical activities. Likewise, commonly used\nobjective measures of physical activity or energy expenditure do\nnot assess the type or setting of physical activity (e.g., acceler-\nometry) or any specific features of physical activity (e.g., energy\nactivity by healthy animals has received little study. The tight\nrelationship between increased body mass and decreased spon-\ntaneous activity levels among rats and mice, irrespective of fat\nmass, has led to a hypothesis that a reduction in spontaneous\nactivity is a symptom of obesity (33), but how body mass might\nbe sensed to regulate voluntary physical activity is not known.\nReduced DA release or loss of DA receptors in brain appears\nrelated to the age-related decline in physical activity observed\namong many species (34). The meso-limbic (i.e., ventral teg-\nmentum-nucleus accumbens) DA system is a critical com-\nponent of the forebrain circuitry that regulates activational\naspects of motivation (4) (Figure 3). Antagonists of DA and\ndepletion of DA in the accumbens cause rats to reallocate their\ninstrumental behavior away from food-reinforced tasks that\nhave high work requirements and toward the selection of less-\neffortful types of food seeking (35), implicating DA brain cir-\ncuitry in energy-related decision making.\nActivation of neuronal activity in hypothalamic reward\nregions during spontaneous locomotion by rats was estab-\nlished 40 years ago (36,37), and electrical self-stimulation of\nthe ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been used to artificially\nmotivate treadmill running (38) and weight lifting (39) in rats.\nHowever, little is known about the role of the meso-limbic DA\nsystem in the motivation of voluntary physical activity such as\nwheel running or other types of spontaneous physical activity\nin home cages or novel open fields. Treadmill running acutely\nincreases DA release (40) and turnover (41) and chronically\nupregulates D2 receptors (42) in the striatum of rats, but forced\ntreadmill running by rats and mice likely confounds exertion\nwith emotional stress and is thus a poor model of voluntary\nphysical activity.\nRats and mice have been selectively bred for running (43,44),\nbut genes that might help explain motivated running or other\nspontaneous physical activity in rodents have yet to be identi-\nfied (45). Nonetheless, early gene expression has been impli-\ncated in voluntary wheel running. A recent study found that\nc-fos and delta fosB in the nucleus accumbens were activated\nduring wheel running in rats, and mice that overexpress delta\nfosB selectively in striatal dynorphin-containing neurons\nincreased their daily running compared with control litter\nmates (46). Delta fosB could plausibly facilitate wheel run-\nning by inhibiting the release of dynorphin by GABA neurons,\nwhich otherwise binds with kappa opioid receptors to inhibit\nDA release in the VTA or accumbens (46).

Common statistical techniques\nsuch as ANOVA and ordinary regression cannot fully address\nthese complexities. Advanced techniques such as structural\nequation modeling and latent growth modeling provide preci-\nsion for multilevel, theoretically derived analysis of mediated\nchange (66) in physical activity, as illustrated by Figure 5.\nSummary\nUnderstanding how genes, the environment, and personal moti-\nvation operate to influence physical activity will be hindered by\na search for candidate genes predominantly restricted to energy\nintake pathways, continued use of cross-sectional, univariate\nassociation studies, failure to include measures of personality or\nputative social-cognitive mediators and moderators of physical\nactivity, use of physical activity measures that are poorly vali-\ndated or improperly applied according to context, and by scarce\nuse of statistical procedures that permit simultaneous estimates\nofdirectandindirectrelations/effectsbetweengenes,motivation,\nthe environment, and physical activity.

Studies of\nphysical activity should compare results using both subjective\nand objective measures to enhance convergence of methods\nand exploit their unique assessment features.\nSimilarly, physical activity studies of mice and rats have used\nvarious types of physical activity that are uncorrelated and\nhave widely different behavioral interpretations depending\nupon the setting. For example, voluntary wheel running seems\nto represent a unique motivational system in rodents (58).\nMice selectively bred for higher velocity wheel running (42),\nand rats selectively bred for higher treadmill running endur-\nance (59) each have high aerobic capacities, but the treadmill\nrunning trait is unrelated to voluntary wheel running (60) and\nneither running trait is associated with other types of sponta-\nneous physical activity such as locomotion in the home-cage or\nin a novel open field (61\u00ad63). Moreover, commonly used meas-\nures of spontaneous physical activity by rodents (e.g., home-\ncage locomotion) used to mimic human nonexercise energy\nexpenditure (e.g., reference (64)) do not seem well suited for\nunderstanding human motivation for either leisure play or pur-\nposeful physical activities of daily living. Spontaneous physical\nactivity in cages or in an open field can be selectively bred as\na trait (65) and can model fear, anxiety, agitation, depression,\naggression, social dominance, or exploration, depending upon\nthe social and environmental conditions of observation.\nMultiLevel Models of Physical Activity Change\nConceptual models of physical activity should include variables\nmeasured at the level of the person, including family and home\nenvironment,butalsomeasuredatthelevelofcommunitycatch-\nment areas (e.g., neighborhoods, churches, work sites, schools)\n(Figure 4).
