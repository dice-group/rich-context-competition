    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe irrefutable consequence of Scottish excessive alcohol consumption has prompted implementation and proposal of\nalcohol policy measures. The purpose of this study is to explore with heavy drinkers their awareness of and identify potential\nimplications of policy introducing alcohol minimum unit pricing (MUP). Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were\nconducted with drinkers with alcohol-related harm (n = 20; 15 males, five females; aged 34 to 67 years old) in Scotland's two\nlargest cities (drinkers were participants within a larger quantitative study, through attendance for treatment for alcohol-\nrelated harms at National Health Service [NHS] centers). Median weekly consumption among participants was 130.7 units\n(range: 28-256.3 U.K. units). Views regarding the impact of increased alcohol prices, through MUP, were mixed. While some\ndrinkers indicated potential reduction in intake, thus possibly reducing alcohol harms in the long term, the expected, or even\ndesired, from a public health perspective, effects on consumption and associated harms might not be fully realized in this\ngroup. To mitigate possible unintended short-term detrimental effects of MUP on the most vulnerable, careful planning and\nappropriate resourcing may be required prior to implementation.\n",

In an attempt to mitigate the effects of low cost and\neasily accessible alcohol, acknowledged by the Health First\nevidence-based alcohol strategy (University of Stirling,\nAlcohol Health Alliance, British Liver Trust, 2013) to be two\nkey drivers facilitating excessive alcohol consumption, the\nAlcohol etc. (Scotland) Act 2010 was implemented in October\nquantity discounts plus other alcohol promotions in off-sales\npremises (outlets licensed to sell alcohol for consumption off\nthe premises). A subsequent reduction in off-trade wine sales\nwas reported, but with little evidence of impact on sales of\nother drink types (Robinson et al., 2013). However, Nakamura\net al. (2013) found that banning alcohol multi-buy promotions\n(primarily for beer, cider, and wine) in Scotland did not reduce\nalcohol purchasing in the short term, and suggested that wider\nregulation of price promotion and price would be required.\nThe Alcohol (Minimum Pricing; Scotland) Act 2012\n(Scottish Parliament, 2012) will set a minimum price at\nwhich a unit of alcohol may be sold (1 U.K. unit equals\nU.S.$0.8) per U.K. unit (50ppu). However, the legality of\nthis Act in terms of international trade agreements was chal-\nlenged by the trade bodies representing alcohol producers,\n1Queen Margaret University, Musselburgh, UK\n2Edinburgh Napier University, UK\n3The University of Edinburgh, UK\n4University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nFiona O'May, School of Health Sciences, Queen Margaret University,\nQueen Margaret University Drive, Musselburgh, East Lothian,\nEmail: fomay@qmu.ac.uk\nHeavy Drinkers' Perspectives on\nMinimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol in\nScotland: A Qualitative Interview Study\nFiona O'May1, Jan Gill2, Heather Black2, Cheryl Rees3,\nJonathan Chick2, and Barbara McPake4\n Keywords\nalcohol policy, alcohol consumption, minimum unit pricing, heavy drinkers, Scotland\n2 SAGE Open\nand it was referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\nThe ECJ ruled that the Act was in breach of European Union\n(EU) free-trade laws, but returned the case to Scotland civil\ncourts for a final ruling. At the time of writing, this process is\nongoing, and the outcome, and therefore any implementation\ndate for the Act, remain uncertain. An account of the Act's\ndevelopment and the policy context can be found in\nKatikireddi, Hilton, Bonell, and Bond (2014) and Katikireddi,\nEvidence in support of increasing the price of alcohol to\nreduce alcohol-related morbidity and mortality derived from\nsystematic reviews emerging from the United Kingdom,\nAustralia, the United States, and Europe is persuasive (e.g.,\nWagenaar, Tobler, & Komro, 2010). Scottish Minimum Unit\nPricing (MUP) legislation was also critically informed by a\nmodel proposed by Sheffield University (Meng, Purshouse,\nBrennan, & Meier, 2010; Purshouse, Meng, Rafia, Brennan,\n& Meier, 2009). The Sheffield alcohol policy model version\n2 was adapted to a Scottish context by incorporating\nScotland-specific data on levels of alcohol consumption, the\nprices paid by population sub-groups for different categories\nof alcohol, and the preferences for off-licensed trade versus\non-licensed trade purchasing (Purshouse et al., 2009).\nUpdated versions of the model (Meng, Hill-McManus,\nof a 50ppu minimum price combined with a discount ban,\npredict figures for extra spending per annum for moderate,\nrespectively, which equates to an additional spend per week\ndrinkers as men/women who consume no more than 21/14\nU.K. units per week, hazardous drinkers as consuming\ners as consuming more than 50/35 units per week,\nrespectively.\nIn British Columbia, Canada, where alcohol minimum\npricing (not minimum unit price) has been introduced, sig-\nnificant health benefits have been observed, including a 32%\nreduction in wholly alcohol attributable deaths following a\n10% increase in average minimum price for all alcoholic\ndrinks (Zhao et al., 2013). An important assertion is that,\ndespite popular opinion, even the heaviest drinkers reduced\ntheir consumption when minimum alcohol prices increased\nThe Scottish Government believes that MUP is the most\neffective of a range of policy options to tackle price, and help\nreduce alcohol consumption and related harm (Scottish\nGovernment, n.d.). MUP would set a floor price for one unit\nof alcohol, below which it could not be sold. For example,\none 440 ml can of 5% cider contains 2.2 units, therefore, the\nminimum price for which it could be legally sold would be\n\u00a31.10, so there would be no financial benefit in buying in\nbulk (as is currently the case). Certainly, current Scottish\nsales data (Robinson et al., 2015) would predict the greatest\nimpact on the price of spirits (particularly vodka) and strong\nwhite cider. Those defined as moderate drinkers would be\nmarginally affected as they consume a small amount of alco-\nhol. Alcohol purchasing in licensed premises (e.g., pubs, res-\ntaurants) is likely to be unaffected by MUP as prices already\ngreatly exceed the minimum proposed.\nThe developers of the Sheffield model acknowledge that\nas it is based on general population data, it cannot predict the\nimpact on heavy drinkers. Byrnes, Shakeshaft, Petrie, and\nDoran (2013), using Australian survey data, reported that\nwhen faced with price increases, \"high intensity\" drinkers\ncontinued to binge by reducing their alcohol consumption\nbetween episodes of binging. The reduced drinking in itself\nmay afford some health benefits, but the episodic binging\nrepresents a harmful drinking pattern. As the price of indi-\nvidual, cheap drinks will increase, a likely effect of MUP\nmay be surmised from the findings of the following studies.\nRecent work from New Zealand (Casswell, Huckle, Wall, &\nYeh, 2014) revealed that heavy drinkers paid more for alco-\nhol overall than the general population because they con-\nsumed more, but they paid less for individual drinks as they\nbought disproportionate quantities of cheap, typically strong,\nalcohol. They tended to buy their alcohol from off-trade\nsources. Similar conclusions were reached in two separate\nstudies involving drinkers harmed by their alcohol consump-\ntion in Scotland (Black, Gill, & Chick, 2011; Black et al.,\n2014), where participants tended to purchase cheap alcohol,\nwith around 95% of purchases being from off-sale outlets\n(i.e., supermarkets and corner shops, etc.).\nA common criticism of increasing the price of alcohol is\nthat, if people with alcohol dependence can no longer afford\ntheir drink of choice, they will need to find a substitute,\nwhether that be cheaper alcohol, counterfeit or illicit alcohol,\nor other substances. Alternatively, they might resort to theft.\nOn balance, the evidence suggests that increases in alcohol\npricing tend to be associated with reductions in crime (Home\nOffice, 2011), but there is currently insufficient evidence to\ndetermine the impact of alcohol prices and purchase of other\nlicit and illicit substances (Hunt, Rabinovich, & Baumberg,\nThus, it appears that further data relating to the drinking\npatterns of the heaviest drinkers in society would be valuable\nand informative. These drinkers rarely take part in routine\npopulation surveys documenting consumption (Livingston\n& Callinan, 2015), and factors, other than price, that restrict\nor facilitate their consumption are poorly described. As sug-\ngested by Chalmers (2014), the Sheffield alcohol policy\nmodel would ideally be built on a dataset including people's\nalcohol purchases, consumption, location of purchase, and\nprice.\nOur participants comprised both dependent drinkers, and\nthose whose health was at least harmed in some way by their\ndrinking, as they were all recruited in hospital or clinic set-\ntings for treatment relating to their alcohol consumption. To\nour knowledge, this is the first report exploring the current,\nO'May et al. 3\nand self-predictions of future, purchasing behavior of a\ngroup of heavy (as we refer to them throughout the article)\ndrinkers explicitly in relation to proposed alcohol policy.\nAims and Objectives\nIn light of the recent policy measures proposed by the\nScottish Government, this study interviewed heavy drinkers\nto elicit their views regarding the cost of alcohol in Scotland,\nexplore their awareness of increases in alcohol price, and\nopinions regarding implications of MUP should it be imple-\nmented, at a personal and wider level.\nMethod\nThe findings reported here are in accordance with the\nConsolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research\nThis study sits within a 2-year prospective study of 639 patients\nattending alcohol treatment services as outpatients or admitted\nas hospital inpatients with an alcohol-related problem (which\nhas resulted in physiological and/or psychosocial harm), who\nwere interviewed about their drinking and purchasing habits\napproximately every 6 months over a period of 24 to 30 months.\nParticipants were asked at their third quantitative inter-\n18 months after recruitment), whether they would be willing\nto take part in an additional semi-structured face-to-face\ninterview (see the appendix) to explore their experiences and\nviews about recent alcohol policy and the governmental pro-\nposal to legislate a \"minimum unit price\" for alcohol. The\ninterview was scheduled for a date as soon after the T3 inter-\nview as mutually convenient, mostly between 1 and 4 weeks.\nFrom those who indicated willingness, 20 participants were\nrecruited, 10 from each of the two Scottish cities in the study\n(Glasgow and Edinburgh). Participants were purposively\nselected on the basis that they had been drinking at hazard-\nous or harmful levels at T3, and that the average price they\nwere paying at that time was less than 50ppu. Care was taken\nto ensure that they were approximately representative of the\ntotal sample by gender, social deprivation quintile, and age\n(see Table 1). Participants were contacted by telephone, and\ninterview dates and times arranged. If participants failed to\nkeep their appointment, they were contacted to confirm\nwhether or not they were still willing to take part, if not, the\ninterviewer then selected another potential participant from\nthose meeting the inclusion criteria, until the target quota of\n10 participants from each city was achieved.\nOf the 28 participants contacted, three failed to respond,\ntwo declined to participate, and three did not attend the\narranged interview. Of the 20 interviewed, five were not\ndrinking at the time of the qualitative interview, but reported\nTable 1.

It was emphasized\nthat the questions were designed to obtain their views and\nopinions, and that there were no right or wrong answers.\nInterviews took place in a health service site. Consent for\nbeing interviewed and for audio recording was taken at inter-\nview. During each interview, the interviewer gave a brief\nexplanation of the Alcohol Minimum Pricing Act, followed\nby an example, using white cider, and their preferred drink\n(if that was different), to demonstrate how the existing price\nwould be affected by an MUP of 50ppu.\nInterviews were arranged and conducted by the research-\ners who had administered the earlier quantitative interviews\n(H.B., C.R.), to capitalize on the degree of trust already\nestablished. Interviews were recorded using an encrypted\ndigital recorder, and were between 20 and 50 min in length.\nAn additional member of the research team (F.O'M.) was\nalso in attendance (once the participant had given permis-\nsion) to observe the interview and make notes, subsequently\ntranscribe the recordings, and analyze the data. Interviews\nbetween 1 and 6 weeks after T3 interview. Handwritten field-\nwork notes were kept during the data collection and analysis\nprocess. Upon completion of the interview, participants were\ngiven a \u00a310 voucher for a high street pharmacy-led health\nand beauty store, and reimbursed for any travel expenses.\nData Analysis\nThe interviews were transcribed verbatim by the first\nauthor, and during this process, initial thoughts and ideas\nwere noted down, as an essential part of the analytic pro-\ncess (Riessman, 1993). Thematic analysis was conducted,\nas described by Braun and Clarke (2006). All the tran-\nscripts were read multiple times, to identify categories of\nrelevance to the research aims; emerging themes and com-\nmonalities were noted. These categories were then grouped\naccording to consistency in topic, as well as in relation to\nthe research aims, and themes were thereby constructed,\nrepresenting recurring topics. Verification of coding was\nconfirmed by a second research team member, and all\nauthors had iterative discussions regarding the construc-\ntion of themes and their interpretation. The constant com-\nparative method was used to help identify reasons for\npatterns and contradictions in the data.\nEthical approval was provided by National Health Service\n(NHS) Lothian Research Ethics Committee and was\nreviewed by the respective Caldicott Guardians.\nResults\nWhen asked about proposed alcohol policy, specifically\nMUP, participants gave wide ranging responses, sometimes\nrelating it to their own personal experiences, and at other\ntimes projecting, referring to other drinkers, known or\nunknown to them, or the general public.\nContextually, public houses and bars played a minimal role\nin participants' lives, with only one or two reporting drinking\nin pubs, and then only occasionally, or when friends took them\nout. Pubs were generally considered to be far too expensive for\nalcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks alike, the latter reducing\nany incentive to supplement or replace alcoholic beverages,\nand actually encouraging individuals to drink at home. Other\ncomments indicated that pubs were where social drinking took\nplace, which was no longer possible for these individuals; that\nthey were not safe places because people could become vio-\nlent and aggressive; and that drinking soft drinks in a pub\nmade you feel silly as pubs were for drinking alcohol.\nDrinkers' Anticipated Personal Strategies to Cope\nWith an Increase in Drink Prices Through MUP\nImplementation\nWhen asked what would happen if the price of their preferred\ndrinks were to increase, various tactical ways to manage were\nproffered. One participant reported she would switch from\nlager to spirits, as they were higher strength and she would get\nmore units for her money, and could make her drink last longer\nby adding mixers. Alternatively switching to cheaper alcohol,\nsuch as white cider or supermarket own brand, was mentioned,\n\". . . it's only when I'm down to my last pennies, and what can\nI buy for this, and my option is, I can get cheap cider for it\"\n(P4, female), and \"I would probably change what I was drink-\ning . . . cider, or something cheap and nasty . . . [brand of white\ncider]\" (P18, male); or reducing consumption, in some cases\ndramatically, \"Phhhh . . . there's no way I could address it . . .\nI would actually just need to cut right back or stop\" (P5, male)\nand \". . . I would really struggle to actually maintain the drink-\ning level . . . I would have to dramatically reduce my alcohol\nintake . . . well, I'd have to try\" (P15, male).\nSome would be prepared to cut back on drink, to keep food\nintake constant, \"I have to buy all the food, I haven't got any\nchoice, it's the drinking that has to be cut back on\" (P9, male),\nwhereas others would cut back on food, \"I'd still be able to\nbuy it [alcohol], I'd just do without food\" (P16, female), or\nnot pay bills, borrow money, and get into debt or increase\ndebt to maintain alcohol consumption, \"I'd probably borrow\nmoney off my family members, especially my oldest daugh-\nter . . . that would be my only way round about it\" (P13,\nfemale), and \". . . I would just do without heating and I'd have\nto rely on my family more . . . or friends\" (P17, male).\nOther tactics included shopping elsewhere and seeking out\noffers. One candidly stated he did not know how he would\nprocure his alcohol, but \"I think it will be drastic, what I would\ngo to, to get what I need\" (P1, male).\nO'May et al. 5\nThose respondents who were either not drinking at the time\nof interview, or had cut down, spoke of \"others,\" saying perhaps\n\"they\" might resort to stealing alcohol, or switch drink type,\n. . . if they're that advanced . . . they'll go and get something else.\nI don't know what I think about it, but I don't think it would\nstop. People will just go onto something cheaper and nastier, if\nthey really wanted. (P3, male)\nUnsurprisingly, the three participants who stated that they\nwere not short of money were less concerned about any\npotential impact of MUP, \". . . it would be a while before I\ndid that [change brands], because I've got enough money to\npay for it\" (P2, male);\n. . . we have a bottle of wine amongst 3, every day . . . Pinot noir,\nit's good quality wine. So we're not buying the \u00a32 or \u00a33 bottle of\nwine. Money is not the issue with us. (P8, male);\nand \"that doesn't bother me at all, the price of alcohol. I was\nbuying it anyway. Eh, I don't look at price\" (P14, male).\nSome participants perceived adverse health consequences\nof stopping or suddenly reducing alcohol intake in response\nto increased prices, in particular, a fear of seizures by those\nwho had themselves experienced them, as tolerance/depen-\ndence can vary widely, making seizure prediction difficult,\n\". . . [it] could harm people, especially if you're a right alco-\nholic, it could destroy them, it could kill them--just totally\ncutting down\" (P16, female).\nOne participant, who had already reduced her alcohol\nconsumption by approximately two thirds owing to financial\nconstraints following a bereavement, said she would have to\ntry to cut down further if prices continued to rise, but this\ncaused her concern:\nIf it was to go up quite suddenly, I think my intake would be\nreduced again, because of the cost . . . which really worries me,\nbecause at the moment, I'm comfortable in my own wee zone,\nbecause I've turned into a recluse, kind of, since my\n[bereavements] . . . it's going to send me into a state of depression\nI think, because I'm out of my comfort zone. (P6, female)\nAnumber of participants stated that if MUPwere introduced,\nthey would just have to stop drinking, but could not expand on\nhow they might do that, other than one who said she would seek\nmedical treatment, \"I would just get myself in somewhere, like\nhere [detox centre] . . . there would be no way around it for me,\nI would just have to ride it out, or get help\" (P4, female).\nAwareness of MUP and Perceptions of Its\nPotential Wider Impact\nAll participants had been informed about the proposed intro-\nduction of an MUP at first, and subsequent, interviews. Some\nwere aware that the legislation was currently being chal-\nlenged, however, several claimed ignorance or did not know\nany details. Many expressed resistance to MUP, both from a\npersonal perspective, as well as on behalf of others. One\nview was that people already paid enough tax, and claims\nthat drinkers and smokers were \"clogging up the health ser-\nvice\" should be counteracted by saying that the government\ngained a lot in tax from them, and that MUP ultimately would\nhurt people \"at the bottom.\" Another said,\nI don't believe MUP will work . . . to me, it's one step away from\nprohibition. Alcohol is still going to be available, and it's just\ngoing to be a lot more expensive, and all that will happen is that\npeople that can afford it anyway, they'll pay it . . . whether or not\nthey've got an alcohol problem, and people that can't afford it,\nand who do have an alcohol problem . . . it's going to lead to a\nburgeoning of a black market, which already exists with vodka,\nand whisky. (P5, male)\nA participant said that while he agreed with MUP in prin-\nciple, because he was drinking heavily again, he would not\nwelcome it in practice,\nMy opinion is, if they [drink prices] can put someone like me\ninto this state, and they can achieve it so easily, then it's a\ndisgrace . . . I would agree with that [MUP], unfortunately at the\nmoment I wouldn't. (P1, male)\nAnother felt that \". . . if it's [MUP] going to help people\nand alcoholics, good, but if it's not going to make any differ-\nence, I don't see why they don't just leave it alone\" (P7,\nmale).\nWith regard to white cider specifically, there was a sug-\ngestion that MUP could be beneficial:\n. . . I reckon if they kept 50 pence a unit, I think that would be\nbetter, because a lot of people would stop drinking [brand of\nwhite] cider, because I think that's a big, big problem . . . But \u00a34\nfor 22 units--that's how much a bottle of [brand] is . . . so if they\nput it at 50 pence a unit, I think that would work out better. (P12,\nmale)\nIt was also suggested that some people might even be per-\nsuaded to change from white cider to a \"nicer drink\" or\n\"trade up\" when they compared the prices post-MUP. One\nrespondent calculated that his current 3-liter bottle of white\ncider would virtually triple in price at 50ppu, which he would\nno longer be able to afford,\nA bottle of [brand of white cider] is going to be almost \u00a310,\nthat's 3 liters. Currently I could get that or, the cheapest is \u00a33.79,\nI think, so you're looking at almost tripling the price.And there's\njust no way I could afford that. (P5, male)\nA participant who was currently not drinking thought that\nthe effect of MUP on cheap ciders would \"probably be a\ngood thing\" but went on to say that, in his opinion,\nif somebody wants to drink, they'll drink. They won't be happy\nabout the extra price, but if they're an alcoholic or whatever,\nthey will find a way to pay the money . . . (P7, male)\n6 SAGE Open\nOne participant, for whom money was not an issue, was\npositive regarding the proposition of MUP and felt that\npence. That's my view\" (P8, male). Another, similarly with-\nout financial problems, thought MUP would serve as a\nwakeup call, and that any disincentive would be positive,\nI suppose it would make me realize just how much money I was\nwasting on it, when I could use the money for other things. It\nwould be a big [sigh] reason to drink less, or stop drinking. It\nmight not be enough to completely stop me, but it would be a\nvery big consideration. (P2, male)\nSeveral respondents indicated that they did not feel they\nwould be personally affected, as they were already paying\nmore than 50ppu. A retailer's point of view was provided by\na participant whose employment had involved the sale of\nalcohol. He was receptive to the prospect of MUP, as a means\nof removing the financial advantage perceived to be cur-\nrently enjoyed by bulk-buying supermarkets:\n. . . if I was still in business, I would have loved minimum\npricing to come in, if I was selling alcohol . . . levelled the\nplaying field. They couldn't sell stuff cheaper than a certain\namount, and I could probably sell for that price as well. (P14,\nmale)\nOne participant suggested that MUP could reduce drink-\ning by younger people, who tend to drink the cheapest drinks,\nparticularly white cider and vodka, and that a dramatic price\nrise might make them think about spending their money on\nother items or activities:\n. . . it is relatively cheap to go and get blasted for the weekend,\nyou know, but for somebody to go to the cinema, it's a tenner . . .\nor to go swimming, they'd have the bus fare there, the bus fare\nback, that's \u00a31.40 . . . plus the price of \u00a33.50 to get into the\nswimming pool, that's a fiver. You know, get somebody else to\ngive us a pound, that's two big bottles of cider! Way hay! . . . it's\ntoo accessible, you know, and everything else is too expensive.\nHowever, she did not think that MUP would influence\nthose who were addicted, as \"they'll obtain alcohol wherever\nand however\" (P20), which included driving to England to\nobtain cheaper alcohol, buying illicit alcohol, and home brew-\ning. Others similarly predicted the likely failure of MUP,\nI don't think there's anything else the politicians can do. If they\nintroduce minimum pricing, then, they'll just, they'll still drink\nthe alcohol, em, or they'll be . . . pooling their money to get the\nstronger stuff, if that's what they want . . . they'll still get the\nalcohol . . . regardless of the price. (P14, male)\nNone of our participants indicated that they would resort\nto drinking illicit alcohol, following the proposed introduc-\ntion of MUP; indeed, some stated they were very fearful of\nthe damage such drink could potentially inflict and would\nnot touch it, \"It might not be ethanol, it might be methanol\nthat's in it, and you wake up blind or something. I just\nwouldn't touch that\" (P5, male). Only one participant men-\ntioned potentially switching from alcohol to drugs, saying he\nwould \"just buy a bit of dope!\" (P3, male).\nDiscussion\nMUP is a whole-population intervention, and the partici-\npants in our study are members of a small but noteworthy\nsection of the population, many of whom would be dispro-\nportionately affected by an increase in alcohol prices, such\nas through MUP, owing to the large volume and cheaper\ntype of alcohol they purchased. Our findings show a range\nof views and awareness regarding MUP, and a varied per-\nception of its hypothesized impact consistent with the\ndemographic spread across Scottish Index of Multiple\nDeprivation (SIMD) quintiles, age, and levels of consump-\ntion. Participants who were already abstaining, and those\nwho were considering abstention or reducing their con-\nsumption to \"safe\" levels, were more receptive to MUP\nthan those who were not. Two participants reported that\nthey would have to reduce their alcohol purchasing and\nconsumption if MUP were introduced, owing to financial\nconstraints, thus supporting the purpose of MUP.\nSeveral respondents struggled to understand the concept of\nMUP; they still talked of trading down, using white cider as a\nfall back, or making more of an effort to track down special\noffers (which would no longer exist). They had not understood\nthat they would be paying a minimum of 50 pence for each unit\nof alcohol (8g ethanol) contained in a drink, with no option to\nbenefit financially from, for example, bulk buying or purchas-\ning an alternative beverage type. Our quantitative data show\nthat the mean unit price paid for beer was slightly above 50ppu\n(Gill et al., 2015), but, we propose, high alcohol consumption\nlevels of beer drinkers are supported through the availability of\ncheaper drinks such as cider (Black et al., 2014).\nIt is important that discussion of the potential impact of\nMUP does not disregard the addictive nature of alcohol and\nits impact on purchasing. Many participants were generally\nnot able to plan ahead, let alone take account of legislation\nthat might not be implemented for years, if at all. To them,\nMUP was a vague and obscure concept, their attitude was that\nthey would deal with any issues if, and when, it was in place.\nThis absence of personal anticipatory preparation for MUP\nimplementation could have implications for health services,\nsuch as increased emergency hospital admissions and\ndemands on detox services.\nReducing alcohol harm is a complex problem, requiring\ncomplex solutions. From their global systematic review and\nnarrative synthesis of 42 studies that focused on alcohol pol-\nicy interventions, Diepeveen, Ling, Suhrcke, Roland, and\nMarteau (2013) concluded that public acceptability of gov-\nernment interventions to change behavior is greatest for the\nO'May et al. 7\nleast intrusive interventions, which are often the least effec-\ntive, and for interventions targeting the behavior of others,\nrather than the respondents themselves. They recommend\nfurther research to assess how the presentation of the prob-\nlem and the benefits of the intervention might increase\nacceptability for those interventions that are more effective\nbut less acceptable. Results from recent Scottish and English\nresearch (Alcohol Policy Interventions in Scotland and\nEngland [APISE] study) showed that harmful and hazardous\ndrinkers were less likely to support alcohol policies than\nmoderate drinkers, but that the majority of respondents\nbelieved that the government has a responsibility and should\nbe doing more to tackle harms caused by alcohol. Opinion on\nhow they should be doing this, and who they should be tar-\ngeting, however, was not clear (Li, 2014).\nLonsdale, Hardcastle, and Hagger (2012) reported skepti-\ncism regarding effectiveness of MUP as a means to reduce\nalcohol consumption from a sample of 218 members of differ-\nent community groups in England, of whom 10 were hazard-\nous drinkers, but none was a dependent drinker. In our study,\nmany participants did not feel that any proposed alcohol policy\nwas going to help them, but that the introduction of, for exam-\nple, MUP, might reduce the likelihood of younger people\ndeveloping the same drinking patterns and harms that they had.\nInstead of perpetuating the perception that alcohol misuse\nis largely an individual problem best avoided and managed\nthrough education, counseling, and medical treatment, Groves\n(2010), among others, has suggested that for the United\nKingdom, the health and societal costs of alcohol misuse are\nbest prevented through legislation on pricing and marketing.\nIn this vein, portraying alcohol policy as a broad, multi-sec-\ntoral, public health issue that requires a whole-population\napproach has been crucial to policy development in Scotland\n(Katikireddi, Bond, & Hilton, 2014). However, certain indi-\nviduals and/or groups of people, such as those with alcohol-\nrelated harm interviewed in this study, may be affected more\nthan others, perhaps by some unintended consequences. If\nMUP were introduced, the population effect (Meng, Hill-\nMcManus, Brennan, & Meier, 2012) might be delayed. The\nlower-risk drinkers in Scotland could either over time reduce\ntheir consumption, decide to pay a bit more to maintain it, or\neven stockpile some cheaper pre-MUP alcohol. However, for\nthe people we interviewed, who have a high frequency of pur-\nchasing and high expenditure owing to the high volumes pur-\nchased, the impact of MUP would be immediate, particularly\nso for white cider and cheap vodka drinkers.\nCertainly, evidence shows that increasing the price of alco-\nhol reduces harms of various types, and indicates that depen-\ndent drinkers are no exception to the rule that alcohol\nconsumers respond to changes in alcohol prices (Babor et al.,\n2010). While a reduction in hospital admissions over time\nwould be one anticipated effect of MUP, in the shorter term,\nthe impact may be an increase and, if imposed during the win-\nter months, an exacerbation of the general season-associated\nincrease due to respiratory conditions and influenza (Scottish\nGovernment, 2015). The timing of its introduction should be\ncarefully considered, in addition to the potential impact on\nquality of life, as many of our participants mentioned the com-\npeting financial demands of purchasing alcohol, buying food,\nand paying household bills.\nConsequential changes in demands on treatment facilities\nalso merit consideration. A recent survey of specialist alcohol\ntreatment services in Scotland identified ongoing issues relat-\ning to service gaps, service planning, staffing, demand, and\nStockwell, Williams, and Pauly (2012) found that in British\nColumbia, when heavy drinkers were asked what they did if\nmoney was short, many said they applied for treatment.\nSudden alcohol withdrawal is dangerous for dependent drink-\ners, in the most serious cases causing seizures. At the last esti-\nmate for Scotland, only one in four alcohol dependent drinkers\nwas accessing alcohol services (Beeston et al., 2014), and\nWallhed-Finn, Bakshi, and Andreasson (2014) reported that a\nminority of those with alcohol dependence seek and undergo\ntreatment. All participants in our study have received treat-\nment relating to their drinking at least once (their recruitment\nsite), but there are likely many more (whose numbers we do\nnot know) who have not engaged with services, or received\nsupport. If MUP is introduced, trading down to cheaper alco-\nhol will no longer be an option, impacting on those already\nusing services, but also potentially on an unknown number of\npeople with alcohol dependence who are not.\nAny unintended increases in the numbers contacting health\nand/or social care would likely be short term, following the\nimplementation of an MUP, and could well be counterbalanced\nby falls in service use over a longer time period, due to reduced\nconsumption within a much larger section of the population.\nWithin the heavy drinking population, arguably there might be\na greater demand for treatment services (e.g., detox, counsel-\ning, etc.) but a subsequent fall in emergency admissions due to\naccidents, bleeds, or myocardial infarction, for example,\nbecause of medically significant reductions in consumption.\nMUP is not a tax and any increased revenue from an\nincreased unit in price is proposed to be returned to the\nretailer, who will also be at liberty to increase the price of\nany drink, not just those that are currently sold under the\n50ppu (Sheffield Alcohol Research Group, n.d.). One poten-\ntial measure would be to annex part of the retailers' antici-\npated profits and ring-fence for treatment services, in the\nform of a hypothecated tax, which would likely prove to be\nhighly controversial (see, for example, Keable-Elliott, 2014).\nOne criticism of MUP is the potential for an increase in\nsales of illicit alcohol (Hilton, Wood, Patterson, & Katikireddi,\nreferred to its availability, while many stated they would\nactively avoid illicit alcohol due to safety concerns. Whether\nthey would reconsider this view when finances are extremely\nstretched--with a choice between more expensive (legal)\ndrinks and much cheaper (illegal) alcohol of unknown prove-\nnance and potential safety hazards--is not known.\n8 SAGE Open\nStrengths and Limitations\nOur study has a number of strengths. To our knowledge, this\nis the first published study that explores the perceptions and\nbehaviors of heavy drinkers with regard to alcohol policy in\nScotland, both extant and proposed, and provides insight into\nhow members of a certain minority group felt they might be\nimpacted by a population-level policy. Opinions and atti-\ntudes do not, of course, necessarily predict behavior, and are\nlikely colored by current drinking status. Data were collected\nat an interesting time in the policy debate and complement\nexisting research, which has, thus far, primarily focused on\nstakeholders' perspectives, such as those in the public and\nvoluntary sector, as well as industry representatives (Carrell,\nHilton, et al., 2014; Meng, Hill-McManus, Brennan, &\nA key limitation was the attrition rate of the study, which\nmeant that at time of interview, the number of potential\nrecruits available to sample had reduced from 639 to 165. In\naddition, as more than 100 of the attritions were attributed to\ndeath, we may not have been able to recruit those who were\ndrinking the most (although we have presented their con-\nsumption figures at baseline, see Table 1). Certainly, evidence\nshows that increasing the price of alcohol reduces harms of\nvarious types, and indicates that dependent drinkers are no\nexception to the rule that alcohol consumers respond to\nchanges in alcohol prices (Babor et al., 2010). While a reduc-\ntion in hospital admissions over time would be one antici-\npated effect of MUP, in the shorter term, the impact may be an\nincrease, and, if imposed during the winter months, an exac-\nerbation of the general season-associated increase due to\nrespiratory conditions and influenza (Scottish Government,\n2015). The timing of its introduction should be carefully con-\nsidered. Some participants were not drinking at the time of\nthe interview, and so they were describing actions in the past,\nor hypothesizing with regard to how they might purchase\nalcohol, now, or in the future, so we have no way of knowing\nwhether or how their purchasing habits would be affected.\nHowever, on average, from our data, each participant would\nbe required to increase expenditure by 21% to obtain the\nequivalent number of units should MUP at 50ppu be intro-\nduced. Put another way, the potential reduction in unit con-\nsumption induced by MUP if participants did, or could, not\nincrease their expenditure, would be 24% (total sample), but\nfor the sub-group drinking exclusively white cider, their con-\nConclusion\nOur findings provide important and relevant insights into the\nviews and drinking practices of the heaviest consumers of alco-\nhol. MUP has the potential to reduce alcohol-related harms on\nmultiple levels, impacting on drinkers across the spectrum. The\nunique pattern of drinking described by this group underscores\nthe need for a more accurate modeling, such as with the\nSheffield model, of the potential ramifications of MUP. There\nare challenges associated with securing relevant informing\ndata, and population surveys have significant shortcomings in\nthis regard. MUP is likely to impact positively on a large pro-\nportion of drinkers, including some heavy drinkers, but it may\nhave some short-term implications for a small group of depen-\ndent drinkers, some of whom may be unable to cut down on\ntheir alcohol consumption, and others who would need to sud-\ndenly cut down drastically. Both of these scenarios may have\nunintendeddetrimentalconsequences,whichshouldbeplanned\nfor and resourced appropriately. From our small study, we sug-\ngest that preventive and anticipatory approaches, targeted at\nthose whose consumption causes them harm, could go a long\nway to making life better for all those who suffer from alcohol-\nrelated harm. In addition, further qualitative investigation\nregarding barriers and facilitators to reducing alcohol con-\nsumption among heavy drinkers, in response to increased alco-\nhol prices, would be welcome.\nAppendix\nInterview Topics\nChanges to purchasing\nHave there been any changes with respect to the shops/super-\nmarkets where you usually buy alcohol?
