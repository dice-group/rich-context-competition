The American\nDiabetes Association recommends\nscreening adults 45 years of age, espe-\ncially those with a BMI 25 kg/m2, at\n3-year intervals with a fasting plasma glu-\ncose (FPG) measurement (3). However,\nphysicians infrequently use an FPG for\nscreening. For example, in a large health\nmaintenance organization within the Uni-\nversity of Michigan health system, 184 phy-\nsicians at 22 separate locations screened\nbetes over a 3-year period. Ninety-five per-\ncent of the screening tests were random\nglucose measurements, 3% were FPGs, and\n2% were A1Cs (4). Random glucose levels\ndepend on the length of time after the pre-\nvious meal and the carbohydrate content of\nthat meal. There is no agreement on what\nrandom glucose values should lead to fur-\nther investigations.\nBecause A1C levels reflect average\nglycemia during the preceding 3\u00ad 4\nmonths, meal issues are not a factor. To\ndetermine what A1C level should lead to\nfurther tests to diagnose diabetes, we ex-\nand Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) population of those not\nknown to have diabetes to determine the\nsensitivity and specificity with which var-\nious A1C levels identified people with\ndiabetes.\nMETHODS -- NHANES oversampled\nAfrican-American and Hispanic individu-\nals to obtain enough data for analysis in\nthis minority subset. Accordingly, results\nwere weighted to reflect the U.S. popula-\ntion. SUDAAN statistical software was\nused to obtain weighted estimates that ac-\ncount for the complex survey design of\na 6-year weighting variable identified,\nGlycated hemoglobin levels were mea-\nsured by a boronate affinity high-\nperformance liquid chromatography\n(HPLC) system and converted to A1C lev-\n(personal communication, Randie Little,\nPhD, University of Missouri School of\nMedicine, Columbia, MO). Subjects were\nqueried by questionnaire, and 532 were\nexcluded because of a previous diagnosis\nof diabetes. An additional 535 subjects\nwere excluded due to missing question-\nnaire data and 10 for missing laboratory\ndata. The final dataset included 4,935 in-\ndividuals. Those whose FPG concentra-\ntions were 126 mg/dl were diagnosed\nwith diabetes. The results were analyzed\nby a receiver operating characteristic\n(ROC) curve.\nRESULTS -- Of the final cohort of\nhad previously undiagnosed diabetes\n(FPG 126 mg/dl). The relationship be-\ntween A1C level and diagnosis of diabetes\nis shown in Fig. 1. An A1C level of 5.8%\nyielded the highest combination of sensi-\ntivity (86%) and specificity (92%) in the\ntotal population. Analyses of subsets of\nthese NHANES subjects revealed sensitiv-\nwhites, 874 African Americans, and\n1,295 Hispanics, respectively. Specifici-\ntively. The 135 subjects who listed their\nrace as \"other\" were not analyzed sepa-\nrately because of their small number.\nCONCLUSIONS -- The American\nDiabetes Association recommends confir-\nmation of an FPG level to diagnose dia-\nbetes (3). Requiring confirmation (not\navailable in NHANES data) would de-\ncrease sensitivity and increase specificity.\nHowever, an A1C level of 5.8% is consis-\ntent with the results of a previous ROC\npopulation utilizing an ion exchange\n[SD]) with diabetes also diagnosed by an\nFPG 126 mg/dl. They concluded that\nthe best screening value lay between 1\nand 2 SDs above the mean (7). The two\nNHANES studies relate A1C levels to the\nprevalence of diabetes. Two studies have\nrelated A1C levels to the incidence of di-\nyears, the 3-year incidence of diabetes (by\nyears whose baseline A1C levels were split\ninto deciles, the 6-year incidence of dia-\nbetes (diabetes drugs or FPG 126 mg/\nBased on the results of these studies\nrelating A1C levels to both prevalent and\nincident diabetes, an A1C value in a\nDCCT (Diabetes Control and Complica-\ntions Trial)-standardized assay (10) of\n5.8% could effectively serve to identify\nindividuals in whom further investiga-\n                                                \nFrom 1Charles R.

Since fasting is not\nnecessary for A1C measurements, this ap-\nproach would markedly reduce the num-\nber of people required to return for a\nfasting test. Given the A1C result, both\nphysicians and their patients might be\nmore motivated to further explore the po-\ntential diagnosis of diabetes.\nAlternatively, an argument can be\nmade to utilize only A1C levels for the\ndiagnosis of pre-diabetes/diabetes. The\nlevels of glycemia that are associated with\nthe microvascular complications of diabe-\ntes are generally agreed upon as appropri-\nate diagnostic criteria (11). In both type 1\ntients, these complications did not de-\nvelop or progress for 6\u00ad9 years when the\naverage A1C level was kept at 7.0%.\nSupporting this relationship, when A1C\nlevels in three large diabetic populations\nwere divided into deciles, the mean value\nin the first decile, in which retinopathy\nRegarding A1C levels and pre-diabetes,\npeople in the DPP (Diabetes Prevention\nwere twice as likely to progress to diabetes\nas those with lower values (19).\nThus, we propose that individuals\nwith A1C levels measured in a DCCT-\nstandardized assay of 6.0% are normal,\nhave diabetes. Since metformin is recom-\nmended for those with type 2 diabetes\n(20) and in younger obese people with\npre-diabetes (19), A1C levels should be\nconfirmed in these patients. Alternatively,\nan A1C level of 5.8% could lead to a\nglucose measurement (an FPG or even an\noral glucose tolerance test). In either ap-\nproach, diabetes will be diagnosed in\nthose at clear risk for microvascular com-\nplications. Those with pre-diabetes will\nbe identified so that appropriate measures\ncan be adopted to reduce their chances of\ndeveloping diabetes.\n"
