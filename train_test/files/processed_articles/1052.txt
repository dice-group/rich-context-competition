    "reduced_content": "The effects of health changes on projections of health service\nneeds for the elderly population of the United States\n \nSurveys indicate an accelerating decline in disability among\nthe U.S. elderly population, suggesting that a 1.5% annual\ndecline in chronic disability for elderly persons is achievable.\nFurthermore, many risk factors for chronic diseases show\nimprovements, many linked to education, from 1910 to the\npresent. Projections indicate the proportion of persons aged\ntrends are not directly represented in Medicare Trust Fund\nand Social Security Administration beneficiary projections.\nThus, they may have different economic implications from\nprojections directly accounting for health trends. A 1.5%\nannual disability decline keeps the support ratio (ratio of\neconomically active persons aged 20\u00ad64 to the number of\n22:1, when the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund was in fiscal\nbalance, to 2070. With no changes in disability, projections\nbalance.\nThe changing health status of the U.S. elderly population is\nlikely to, and should, have a substantial impact on the future\ndemand for health services. This, in turn, has major implica-\ntions for the formulation of both public and private health\ninsurance programs, generally, and the future dynamics of\nMedicare policy and legislation, in particular. Indeed, the\nongoing controversy and uncertainty about the long-term\nsolvency of the Medicare Trust Fund and total Medicare costs\ncan be linked directly to the variation among projections about\nthe future distributions of chronic diseases and disability in a\nrapidly growing U.S. elderly population.\nCurrent Medicare Trust Fund and Social Security Admin-\nistration (SSA) projections--despite their broad utiliza-\ntion--do not explicitly incorporate population health trends\nor, as a consequence, the possibility of cost savings accruing to\nthem. Furthermore, ongoing and likely future biotechnology\ninnovations, together with a wide range of primary prevention\nand health-promoting programs (many of which are designed\nusing data and statistical information from biomedical and\nepidemiological research) are playing, and will likely continue\nto play, a major role in determining the number of disability-\nfree life years experienced by future U.S. elderly populations\n(1\u00ad3). The efficacy of these technologically based curative and\npreventive health strategies, and of an increasing number of\nformal and informal behaviorallifestyle health maintenance\nprograms, is a result of the cumulation of products of a long\nhistory of basic biomedical and epidemiological research of\nchronic health problems in the U.S. (refs. 4\u00ad6; K.G.M. and\nK. C. Land, unpublished results). Nevertheless, these features,\nwhich are core ingredients in determining the future demand\nfor health services, and correlatively the fiscal basis and\nactuarial soundness of public and private health insurance and\npension programs lie outside of the forecasting methodology\nthat currently is used to help formulate Medicare legislation\nand financing.\nThe purpose of this paper is to present alternative projec-\ntions to those currently put forth by SSA and the Medicare\nTrustees--these alternate projections that directly reflect the\neffects of specific monitored health trends--and to identify the\npopulation-level interventions that would be needed to con-\ntinue those positive health trends in the future. These alternate\nhealth-based projections imply a substantial downward revi-\nsion in estimates of the size of the elderly population with\nchronic disability and, thus, with high, long-term, cumulating\nhealth costs. There necessarily also is implied a corresponding\nrevision in the level and structure of projected health service\ndemand. We also present evidence supporting the roles of a\nrange of primary prevention and curative medical interven-\ntions in promoting extant declines in disability among the\nelderly. We are interested, in particular, in prevention and\ncurative strategies and medical treatments that will transform\nchronic disease processes requiring chronic care into acute\ndisease events by medically truncating the disease process (e.g.,\nref. 7). Finally, we will delineate the future longitudinal data\nsources that will be needed to monitor, and make more\ninformed assessments of, U.S. health status dynamics. These\ndata, and better forecasting models, will make possible more\ndetailed and defensible projections of the complete long-term\neconomic consequences of U.S. health status dynamics.\nLong-Term Care Surveys (NLTCS). These are nationally\nrepresentative longitudinal surveys of the U.S. population\n(both community and institutional residents) aged 65 at each\ndate. The survey instruments used in all four waves concen-\ntrate on chronic impairments and morbidities. Those sets of\nquestions were unchanged across the four survey waves.\nTo be defined as chronically disabled when initially selected\nfor a detailed interview, a sample person had to have at least\none disability in an activity of daily living (ADL; ref. 8) or\ninstrumental activity of daily living (IADL; ref. 9), and such\ndisability had to have lasted, or was expected to last, at least\n90 days. Chronic disability was grouped into five categories,\ni.e., those with one or more IADLs impaired (but no ADL\nor without IADL impairments), or persons residing in chronic\ncare institutions who report being chronically disabled. All\nother persons were defined as not being chronically disabled.\nThe publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge\npayment.

Mortality follow-up is virtually 100% because report-\ning of deaths is required by the Health Care Financing\nAdministration (HCFA) and is computerized in Medicare data\nsystems. Samples of approximately 20,000 persons were drawn\nin each survey year from Medicare enrollment lists of persons\nto 1996. To track both positive and negative changes in\ndisability, in each year persons who were chronically disabled\nor institutionalized in prior survey years were automatically\nselected for detailed community or institutional interviews. In\naddition, roughly 14,000 persons in each survey year were\nscreened for incident disability. Longitudinal samples were\nsupplemented to ensure representation of all persons in the\nU.S. aged 65 and older by drawing new Medicare list samples\nof roughly 5,000 beneficiaries who passed age 65 between any\ntwo interview dates.\nEstimates of the range of potential effects of early inter-\nventions on risk factor processes (10) on disability were based\non multivariate analyses of longitudinal risk factor, morbidity,\nand mortality data from the Framingham Heart Study (11).\n29\u00ad62, the Framingham Study included biennial assessments\nof the following risk factors for chronic diseases, which we\nanalyzed by using a multivariate, stochastic process model of\nstate variable dynamics: diastolic blood pressure, pulse pres-\nsure, serum cholesterol, vital capacity index, hemoglobin,\nhematocrit, smoking, body mass index, blood sugar, ventricular\n(heart) rate, and left ventricular hypertrophy. The fundamen-\ntal relation of risk factors to chronic morbidity, disability, and\nmortality was estimated from the 34-year follow-up data from\nFramingham by using a stochastic process model of risk factor\ndynamics coupled to a hazard function for morbiditymortality\nthat was an age-dependent quadratic form in the risk factor\nvariables. For details about the parametric structure of this\nmodel and details of its estimation, see ref. 12. Although risk\nfactor mean levels and their variances and covariances will vary\nacross populations, it is assumed that the basic model param-\neters estimated from the longitudinally followed Framingham\nstudy population represent physiological mechanisms intrinsic\nto the temporally evolving relation of risk factors to chronic\ndisease risks in humans.\nAge-specific disability rates for persons in 5-year categories\nrates were direct-age-standardized to U.S. population projec-\ngraphic application of the age standardization of populations\nin which two or more sets of age-specific rates are compared\nusing one select population as a standard. Here we have only\ntwo sets of age-specific rates but 76 different standard popu-\nrates. The years for which the detailed calculations are re-\n(two dates near the end of the projection to see which effects\nthe later non-WWII baby boom cohorts have on Medicare\nexpenditures). Furthermore, the 1994 disability rates were\nreduced by 1.5% for each year since 1994--consistent with the\nThe 1982 disability rates were held constant. Thus, both sets of\nage-standardized chronic disability rates changed because of\nprojected changes in the age distribution of the elderly pop-\nulation.\nProjections of the number of chronically disabled elderly\npersons were produced by applying the age-specific disability\nalternate population projections produced in 1996 by the U.S.\nSSA (14) and an approximation of the ``low-cost'' projection\ndeveloped in 1996 for the Federal Hospital Insurance (Medi-\ncare Part A) Trust Fund (17). Life tables (18) were, in a\nseparate set of calculations, combined with age-specific dis-\nability rate estimates to show the changes in the period-specific\nage relation of disability and mortality in 1994 and as it is\nAn alternative life expectancy scenario was based on pop-\nconstrained by estimates based on alternative risk factor\ndistributions (means and variances) and altered risk factor\ndynamics (both deterministic and stochastic process compo-\nnents) from the Framingham Heart Study. To assess the upper\nrange of life expectancy that was biologically feasible, it was\nassumed that, beginning in 2010, major risk factor interven-\ntions were possible. We assumed that risk factor means could\nbe set to ``optimal'' levels (12) and that risk factor variances\nwere reduced by 75% initially, with the variance reduction\nincreasing to 100% 20 years after initiation of the interven-\ntions. Not surprisingly, this produced much higher life expect-\nancy projections than the official series of projections put forth\nby the SSA and HCFA. Details of the analytical and statistical\nstrategy used to generate the risk factor-related mortality\nchanges and life expectancy forecasts are reported in ref. 4.\nRESULTS\nTo understand what the changes in the chronically disabled\npopulation aged 65 meant in terms of the payroll tax burden\non the U.S. population aged 20\u00ad64, we calculated a health-\nadjusted support ratio--i.e., the ratio of the number of persons\nin the U.S. population aged 20\u00ad64 to the number of chronically\ndisabled persons aged 65. This differs from standard eco-\nnomic ``support ratio'' calculations made for SSA by being\nadjusted for changes in the prevalence of chronic disability in\nthe elderly population--an important determinant of health\ncosts. A non-health-adjusted support ratio may be more ap-\npropriate for Social Security Trust Fund calculations in which\nall survivors aged 65, regardless of health, receive a pension.\nThe health-adjusted support ratio assumes that the average\nhealth care costs for persons aged 65 are a function of the\npopulation prevalence of chronic disability. Chronic disability\nis a good predictor of health care costs because chronically\ndisabled persons generally have much higher medical expenses\nthan nondisabled persons and have them for more prolonged\nperiods of time (17).\nThe prevalence of chronic disability also can be viewed as a\n``leading'' indicator of health changes in the elderly population.\nThis is supported by the fact that the observed declines in the\nproportion of the U.S. elderly population chronically disabled\nover time make it plausible that the proportion of the popu-\nlation aged 65 with chronic morbidity, before the onset of\ndisability, also has been declining (as discussed in ref. 5 and\nK.G.M. and K. C. Land, unpublished results). Thus, the\nproportion of the elderly population chronically disabled is a\ngood index of the population ill-health burden. It foreshadows\nmost shifts in the total distribution of acute and chronic health\ncare costs among the U.S. elderly population. It is of interest\nthat the differentials in certain major health cost components\n(e.g., home health care use) because of disability have in-\nDisability-adjusted support ratios, calculated for each of\neight population growth scenarios, are shown in Fig. 1. Six\nscenarios are based on population forecasts (I*, II*, and III*)\nmade by SSA in 1996. I* assumes high mortality, fertility, and\nimmigration; III* assumes low mortality, fertility, and immi-\ngration; and II* assumes intermediate levels on all three\ncomponents (14). These projections provide the demographic\nbasis for the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund projections.\nTwo more alternatives, A and A*, are an interpretation of the\n``low-cost'' projections used in the HI Trust Fund report where\nlife expectancy is assumed to peak at the values (73.0 years for\nmales; 79.3 years for females) projected by SSA (12) for their\nalternate projection I for the year 2000.\nThree of the four projections with the 1.5% per annum\ndisability decline keep the support ratio above its 1994 value\nchronically disabled person aged 65) in all years for which the\nratio is calculated. In contrast, when no changes in disability\nare assumed, the support ratio rapidly drops below the 22:1\nratio observed in 1994, when the HI Trust Fund was in\napproximate cash flow balance. The support ratio of 8:1\nprojected for the intermediate SSA assumptions with no\nchanges in disability is, in 2070, 63% below the observed ratio\nfor 1994. The calculations assume that the unemployment- and\ndisability-dependent proportions of the population aged\nincome and costs were roughly in balance.\nIn addition to these scenarios it is important to consider that\nthere is more uncertainty about future projections of U.S.\npopulation size than SSA recognizes (15, 16). Projections\nimplying longer life expectancy than in SSA scenarios could\nlead to problems with HI Trust Fund balances even with the\ncontinuation of 1.5% annual disability declines. Achieving a\nbalance between program income and costs then might require\na somewhat higher rate of disability decline andor longer\nactive working life for the aged 65 population.\nTo indicate what plausibly might be accomplished by early-\nin-life major interventions on multiple risk factors, Fig. 2\ndisplays the probabilities of not being disabled and survival\nprobabilities for specific ages under different forecasting sce-\nnarios.\nCurve A represents the age-specific survival probabilities in\n1994. As an alternative, curve C represents age-specific sur-\nvival probabilities in 2070, projected by using the stochastic\nprocess model of risk factor dynamics (12) calibrated on\nFramingham data and assuming major interventions in mul-\ntiple risk factors as of 2010. The total area under this curve is\nthe risk factor-adjusted projected life expectancy in 2070, i.e.,\n98 years, far exceeding any of the current SSA or HCFA life\nexpectancy projections. Curve B represents the age-specific\nprobabilities of being free of chronic disability in 1994. Curve\nD represents the age curves corresponding to the probabilities\ndecline after 1994. The area between curves A and B (compare\nwith the relation of C and D) represents the expected number\nof years spent chronically disabled under the respective sce-\nnarios. The key point is that the area between C and D in 2070\nindicates that about 3 years is expected to be lived in a\nchronically impaired state. This is less than the difference\nbetween A and B, which suggests about 6 years of chronically\nimpaired life expectancy. That is, even with the much greater\noverall life expectancy forecast for 2070, there are fewer years\nexpected to be lived by individuals, absolutely and relatively, in\nchronically disabled states.\nSince health costs are a function of both the duration and\nintensity of medical problems, this suggests that the projected\ndeclines in chronic disability could have a large effect on future\nhealth costs. Although disability is assumed to decline to ages\n95, the largest absolute number of persons with disability\nAdditional calculations done for the above scenarios indi-\ncate that the differences in 2070 in the number of persons\nchronically disabled who are older than 65, assuming a 1.5%\nper annum reduction in disability, vs. an assumption of no\ndisability change is about 20 million persons. Furthermore,\ndisability projected to be avoided in 2070 if disability rates\ndeclined 1.5% per annum are in the age range of 65\u00ad89. Thus,\nmost of the projected disability decline would occur at rela-\ntively young old ages for which we already have significant\nclinical experience in reducing disability (20, 21) or in treating\nDISCUSSION\nOur calculations assumed that chronic disability could, with\nthe appropriate public health programs and sufficient biomed-\nical research investments, decline by 1.5% per annum for each\nof this magnitude would require large-scale adoption of pre-\nventive strategies, broad dissemination of the existing ``best''\nand new medical technologies to the U.S. elderly population,\nand significant new investment in biomedical research to\ncontinue, and increase, the current rate of biotechnology\ninnovations. Several lines of evidence suggest that this rate of\nimprovement (i.e., 1.5% per annum) with the appropriate\ninterventions is a plausible average rate of decline to maintain\nfor a prolonged period of time with a well developed multi-\ndimensional national strategic health program.\ndecline in chronic disability above age 65 is achievable, and\nother data even suggest that the rate of disability decline may\nbe further accelerating. Furthermore, other evidence suggests\nthat sizable declines in chronic disease prevalence and related\ndisabilities have been occurring in the U.S. for more than 75\nyears without the benefit of major health research programs.\nFogel (23) found that chronic disease prevalence in males\nFIG. 1. 1996 SSA projections with and without disability decline.\nFIG. 2. Comparisons of overall survival and disability-free survival\nper annum decline in chronic disease risks for the 75-year\nperiod. These declines were achieved largely because of un-\nplanned interventions, with relatively primitive medical and\npublic health technologies, when relatively little was known\nabout the mechanisms of chronic disease processes occurring\nat relatively advanced ages. For example, one major source of\nthe decline was a reduction in congestive heart failure appar-\nently due to declines in rheumatic heart disease at younger ages\nover time.\nNew data suggest that nutritional factors affecting maternal\nhealth and fetal development help explain why chronic disease\ndeficiencies (e.g., for the 1910 elderly Civil War veteran\nhave such nutritional deficiencies up to 30 years earlier) could\nhave affected maternal pelvic development and increased\nsubsequent late-age risks for cerebrovascular disease in the\nchild (24). Maternal nutritional deficiency during pregnancy\nmay impact the development of the pancreas and liver in the\nfetus, which may alter risks of diabetes and heart disease in the\nchild as he or she ages (24).\nIn addition, environmental factors almost certainly altered\npreparation, and storage that affected microbial food contam-\ninants, salt intake, and changes in water quality (e.g., reducing\nthe prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infections) could have\naffected a wide range of chronic diseases including stroke,\nhypertension, gastric and other cancer, and gastric ulcers (25,\n26). Thus, it is of further interest that Perutz (27) recently\nfound a similar temporal pattern implied by the time rate of\ngrowth of the British centenarian population. Up until the\nborn after the 1840s) the growth rate was nearer 6%. Thus, in\nBritain, as well as the U.S., there appeared to be major\nsocioeconomic and nutritional changes affecting the health\nand survival of the post-1840 birth cohorts.\nIf unplanned nutritional and environmental changes with\nprimitive medical technologies produced a 0.62% per annum\nthe 1.5% per annum decrease in chronic disability observed in\nrecent years might be maintained in a cost-effective fashion by\nappropriate investment in biomedical and epidemiological\nresearch, rapid promulgation of new biotechnologies, more\naggressive efforts at public health intervention (e.g., smoking\ncessation, promotion of physical activity, behavioral changes in\ndietary consumption), and, in the more complete population,\ndissemination of the highest-quality health care.\nThere are currently many diseases for which known inter-\nventions have been proved cost-effective but for which, for a\nvariety of reasons, the full-population health benefit of the\nintervention has not been experienced. For example, coronary\nrevascularization procedures in U.S. African Americans ap-\npear underutilized. In patients for whom the procedure was\nmost likely to be effective (i.e., for whom the extension of life\nwas expected to be greater than 1 year), there were signifi-\ncantly fewer Blacks (42%) than Whites (61%) being treated\n(28). It has been estimated that adjunctive drug therapy after\nacute myocardial infarction may reduce mortality by 5\u00ad30%.\nSuch therapies, if fully utilized, thus could prevent large\nnumbers of premature deaths (29).\nConcerning prevention per se, there is a substantial and\ngrowing body of literature documenting the protective effects\nof regular, vigorous physical exercise (30, 31), appropriate\ndietary supplementation of vitamins B6\n, E, and folate (32),\nand reductions in fat intake. For example, supplementation\nwith B vitamins could reduce circulatory disease deaths by\na nationwide reduction in fat intake could defer approximately\n2% of deaths in U.S. adults each year and increase total U.S.\nlife expectancy by 3\u00ad4 months. A recent study (33) showed that\npersons with lower health risks (defined in terms of smoking,\nbody-mass index, and exercise) have less incident disability at\nolder ages and lower levels of cumulative disability and dis-\nability at any given age than do persons with higher health risks\nfrom the above set. They showed that, while life expectancy\nincreased because of health interventions, the years lived in an\nactive state also increased. A recent longitudinal study (34)\nshowed that better risk-factor profiles were associated with\nreduced Medicare Part A spending.\nAdoption of protective behavioral and lifestyle practices\noften depends on a person's level of education and consequent\ncompliance. Changes in the educational level of the elderly\npopulation could help sustain a decline of 1.5% per annum in\nchronic disability for at least another 35 years. Preston (3)\nprojected that the proportion of persons aged 85\u00ad89 with less\nthan 8 years of education would decline from about 65% in\n36)--nearly 40% faster than the rates assumed in the projec-\ntions presented above.\nMore informed assessments of health status dynamics and\ndefensible projections of their economic consequences would\nbe greatly facilitated by relatively modest amendments to the\ndesign and conduct of future NLTCS. It would be important\nto enroll younger cohorts with lifestyle, behavioral, and phys-\niologic risk-factor assessments to allow for prospective evalu-\nation of the population adoption of preventive interventions\nand later-life incident disability in individuals. More extensive\nassessment of the range of daily physical and social activities\nof the elderly would allow for documentation of leisure\nactivities and expenditures for them. We view this latter\naddendum to current data collection efforts to be particularly\nimportant to accurately assess national health trends at the\nindividual level, for developing a more comprehensive eco-\nnomic analysis of the impact of high-technology preventive and\ncurative interventions (e.g., which chronic diseases are cured\nor truncated to acute events; ref. 38), and to assess the\nlong-term economic returns to basic biomedical research\ninvestment.\nMuch of the extant health economics literature (38, 39)\nviews the future availability of such high-technology interven-\ntions as directly linked to an increase in demand for them and,\nhence, substantial increases in health insurance costs. One of\nthe elements neglected in such analyses is the simultaneous\nconsideration of the positive economic benefit of a vastly\nexpanded leisuresportsvacationhealth-fitness industry con-\nsequential to significantly increased disability-free life years\n(40). Another factor possibly not given sufficient weight is the\neffect of ``postinnovation innovation'' (41), or the maturation\nof a therapy or technology after its introduction (e.g., CAT\nscanners), where efficacy and indication for use can greatly\nexpand. Furthermore, with the extant fertility declines leading\nto relatively smaller future cohorts of working-age people--an\nadditional 5 years of productive disability-free working life for\npersons aged 65 could have a very positive benefit in terms\nof SSA and Medicare Trust Fund balances. The 1.5% per\nannum reduction in chronic disability would provide 3 of those\n5 years without any changes in U.S. life expectancy. To the\nextent that such disability reduction extends active life expect-\nancy the benefit could be far more than 5 years. A compre-\nhensive economic analysis incorporating these various eco-\nnomic, health, and technological dynamics lies in the future.\nK.G.M.'s efforts in this research were supported by grants from the\nNational Institute on Aging.
