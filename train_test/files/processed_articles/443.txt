Methods: The data of the North American NHANES study (n = 9254) and the French National\nHealth Survey (n = 25 559) were used. FL was measured by the ADL and IADL scales. We constructed a logistic regression model with SRH as\nthe outcome and included variables for education, FL and the interaction between education and FL. All results were adjusted for age.\nResults: Poor SRH was more frequently reported in France than in the USA (24.1% vs. 18.4% for men, 29.0% vs. 19.7% for women). The most\nhighly educated persons in the USA had similar FL (25.4% for men, 32.9% for women) to the least educated French persons (22.8% for men,\n31.8% for women). In the USA, FL was associated more strongly with poor SRH in the most educated men than in the least educated. In\nFrance, the same interaction was observed although the link was weaker than in the USA. FL was more strongly associated with poor SRH in\nthe most educated women than in the least educated in both countries. Conclusion: Functional limitation had a greater impact on the most\nhighly educated persons in both France and the USA. Using SRH as a measure of health for evaluating social inequalities could lead to\nunderestimation of the true magnitude of functional health inequalities existing within and between countries.\n.................................................................................................................................\nIntroduction\nSince the original study by Mossey and Shapiro in 19821, many studies\nhave shown that self-rated health (SRH), based on a single item asking\nhow people rate their health, is associated with mortality even after\nadjusting for a variety of factors.2,3 SRH is thus an attractive measure\nof health because it is easy to use, refers to a multi-dimensional definition\nof health and is a good predictor of mortality. Therefore, some studies\naimed at analysing health inequalities have used this indicator as a\nmeasure of health. However, recent results have shown that the\npredictive value of SRH on subsequent mortality differs according to\nlevel of educational attainment.4\u00ad6 Other studies have reported that edu-\ncational attainment directly influences the relationship between objective\nhealth status and SRH, with objectively measured chronic conditions\nhaving less of an impact on SRH among the least educated group.7,8\nOne possible explanation for this phenomenon is differences in the\nexpectations and aspirations people may have regarding their health\naccording to educational attainment. In this case, the impact of a same\nhealth condition on SRH could be higher for those who have the highest\nexpectations, such as socially advantaged groups or those with a high level\nof education.9 The fact that for a same health condition people with a\nhigh socio-economic position may experience a greater negative impact\non their perceived health than people with lower socio-economic position\ncould lead to an underestimation of health inequalities between\nsocio-economic groups when using SRH as an indicator of health.\nIf we consider that this phenomenon is true, in the aim of using SRH as\na measure of health for analysing social inequalities across countries, a\nlogical question is to ask if the influence of socio-economic position on\nthe relationship between health status and SRH is stable and the same in\ndifferent social and cultural contexts. Studies have shown that the\nproportion of poor SRH varies across countries.10,11 Such cross-country\ncomparisons may be most useful. However, they need to be made with\ncaution, since many factors have been suggested to influence SRH:\npopulation structure in terms of individual characteristics (social\nposition, lifestyle, health status), differences in social capital,12,13\nculture, health-care systems14 and/or linguistic factors.14 When\ncomparing social inequalities in health across countries using SRH,\nanother pitfall may arise if the influence of socio-economic position on\nthe relationship between health status and SRH also differs from country\nto country. Little attention has been given to this possibility, although it\ncould shed light on the results from international comparative studies.\nExploring the possibility that socio-economic position has an influence\nFunctional limitations and SRH between France and USA 317\non the link between health conditions and SRH is thus of main interest\nand constitutes the purpose of this study.\nAs an example of an overall measure of health, functional limitation\n(FL), defined here as an individual's report of limitations or an inability\nto conduct basic daily activities due to health problems, has been shown\nto lead to poorer SRH.15\u00ad17 It has been suggested that the relationship\nbetween functional health and SRH may differ according to social\nstatus.8,18 FL could, therefore, be used as a relevant measure of health\ncondition to study the role of socio-economic position on the relation-\nship between health status and SRH. If socio-economic position has a\ndifferent impact on this relationship in different countries, then\nintercultural comparisons using SRH as a marker of functional status\nwould be meaningless, or would require stratification according to\nsocial status. We, therefore, aimed to compare the influence of educa-\ntional attainment on the link between FL and SRH in two countries,\nFrance and the USA.\nMethods\nTwo sets of data were used for the current study. The first set of data,\nNHANES, is a representative sample of the US population. The second\nset, the National Health Survey (NHS) (http://www.insee.\nfr/fr/methodes/default.asp?page=sources/ope-enq-sante.htm) is a repre-\nsentative sample of the French population.\nFrench sample\nThe French data were those of the NHS, the only source of systematic\nstatistical data about the health, health-care consumption\nand socio-economic characteristics of French households. This study\nhas been described in detail elsewhere.19 Briefly, data were collected\nthrough a multilevel, stratified, random survey of households that, on\nthe basis of data from the 1999 national population census, are represen-\ntative of the French population. People who live in institutions (e.g.\nretirement homes, religious communities, prisons and hospitals), in\nmobile homes or who are homeless are not included, therefore $98%\nof the entire population is covered by the survey.19 Using a combination\nof face-to-face interviews and self-administered questionnaires, the NHS\ncollects data at both individual and household levels, including informa-\ntion about demographic characteristics, socio-economic and health\nstatus, complementary insurance coverage and medical care\nconsumption.\nA new data collection was carried out between October 2002\nand September 2003 and constitutes our sample. People were interviewed\nin five waves, throughout the year to account for seasonal variability.\nThree face-to-face interviews were conducted at 1-month intervals. The\noverall response rate during the 2003 NHS survey was >85%. The global\nuals. We restricted our analyses to participants who completed\nself-administered questionnaires on their health. We excluded partici-\nUS sample\nNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), described in detail\nelsewhere.20 In brief, NHANES is a cross-sectional, nationally\nrepresentative survey of the civilian non-institutionalized population of\nthe USA. The NHANES uses a stratified, multistage, probability sample.\nThis multi-stage sample is based on a selection of counties, blocks,\nhouseholds and persons within households. Data are collected through\nan in-person home interview and a physical examination, conducted by\nphysicians, at mobile examination centres.\nly completed a physical interview/examination. We restricted our analyses\nto respondents who completed both the home interview and the physical\ninterview/examination. We excluded participants aged <20 years\nSelf-rated health\nIn the French sample, SRH was measured using the WHO definition, by\nasking participants to rate their health as very good, good, fair, poor or\nvery poor. The responses were dichotomized in our analyses: individuals\nreporting very good or good health were classified as having good SRH\nand those reporting fair or poor or very poor health as having poor SRH.\nIn the US sample, SRH was measured using the US definition, by asking\nparticipants to rate their health as excellent, very good, good, fair or poor.\nThose reporting excellent, very good or good health were classified as\nhaving good SRH and those reporting fair or poor health as having poor\nSRH. It has been shown that associations of SRH with socio-economic\nstatus were similar for the two self-rated item versions, and that com-\nparisons of how these factors relate to SRH across surveys using a\ndifferent 5-point self-rated scale were unlikely to be biased.21\nSocio-economic position\nTo assess socio-economic position in the two studies, we used level of\neducation categorized according to the number of years of education:\nHealth status\nWe assessed the relation between SRH and FL, which was defined in the\nsame way in both studies. FL was assessed using the scale of activities of\ndaily living (ADLs),22 instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs),\nmobility and upper/lower body strength and social participation.23\nParticipants who reported some difficulty, much difficulty or who were\nunable to do one of the activities were considered as having FL.\nStatistical analysis\nEducation may affect SRH and the relationship between FL and SRH\ndifferently according to gender,24\u00ad26 so all our analyses were conducted\nseparately for men and for women. Age-adjusted prevalence of poor\nhealth and FL were compared between France and the USA. To test if\neducational level modifies the relationship between FL and SRH, we con-\nstructed a logistic regression model with SRH as the outcome and\nincluded variables for education, FL and the interaction between\neducation and FL in the model. We then compared results observed in\nFrance and in the USA. As educational level can be influenced by age, all\nthese analyses were adjusted for age both in the USA and the French\nsamples.\nSampling weights were used to account for the sampling structure and\nto correct for systematic non-response bias for both samples. This\nprocedure allows data to be weighted in an inversely proportional rela-\ntionship to the non-response probabilities of individuals, in order to\nrepresent the true population.\nStatistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC, USA).\nResults\nEducational level\ndistribution by age according to educational level differed between the\ntwo countries (table 1). Among US men aged over 60 years, 48.8% had\n>12 years of education, compared with 13.5% of their French counter-\nparts. Among US women, 39.1% had >12 years of education compared\nwith 7.9% of their French counterparts.\n318 European Journal of Public Health\nSelf-rated health\nAfter adjustment for age, the proportion of people reporting poor SRH\nwas higher in France than in the USA, for both men (24.1% in France vs.\nLower educational level was associated with poorer SRH in both\ncountries, regardless of gender (table 2). The gradient according to edu-\ncational level was steeper in the USA than in France.

This was also the case for US men, those\nwith a lower level of education being more likely to report FL than those\nwith the highest level.

As shown in a previous study,8 our\nresults confirm that the impact of certain self-reported physical health\nconditions, such as FL, on SRH is different according to level of\neducation. But our results suggest, for the first time, that this effect\nmay be observed across countries, at least in France and in the USA. In\nboth countries, FL has relatively greater repercussions on SRH in people\nwith a higher education level. They may have higher expectations\nregarding health, and so in the event of disease the impact on SRH\nmay be greater. This explanation is supported by other findings\nshowing the influence of education on the relationship between SRH\nand morbidity7 and between SRH and mortality.4\u00ad6 It is noteworthy\nthat the gradient seems similar in France and in the USA, with the\nmost highly educated Americans reporting comparable rates of FL to\nthose of the least educated French people.\nAn important limitation of our study is that health conditions were\nself-reported, so may be influenced in the same way as SRH and be\nsusceptible to misreporting.27 However, information on health\nconditions is a subjective report of factual matters.11 As showed by\nHaapanen et al.,28 the agreement between questionnaire data and\nmedical records may be good for chronic diseases that have a clear\ndefinition. Therefore, the results are unlikely to be biased with regard\nto FL, which is measured and defined in the same way in the French and\nthe US samples. Moreover, in a previous study using NHANES data,7 we\nshowed that education influenced the relationship between health\nconditions (measured using clinical variables) and SRH, reinforcing the\nresults that we found using variables based on self-reported information.8\nBanks et al.29 also showed that a socio-economic status gradient appears\nwhether self-reports or biological measures of health are used.\nThe French NHS and NHANES were not designed to enable interna-\ntional comparisons. However, the US and French samples are very similar\nin their construction and are representative of the general population,\nreinforcing the validity of this comparison. Health conditions are not\nmeasured in the same way in the French and the US samples, with the\nexception of FL, which is why it was selected for the comparison between\nthe two countries.\nThe measure of SRH was different in the two countries and could\npartly explain the lower proportion of poor health observed in the\nUSA compared with France: the US definition (excellent, very good,\ngood, fair and poor) vs. the WHO definition (very good, good, fair,\nbad and very bad) used in France. Jurges et al.21 showed that people\nseem to be in better health using the US definition, and that the WHO\nvariable could lead to a higher prevalence of poor SRH.30 However, Jurges\net al.21 have shown that `associations of SRH with demographic factors\nsuch as socio-economic status were similar for the two self-rated item\nversions. Thus comparisons of how demographic and other factors relate\nto SRH across surveys using a different 5-point self-rated scale are unlikely\nto be biased'. Thus, using two differing definitions for SRH may not limit\nour analysis of the impact of education on the link between health\nconditions and SRH in France and the USA.\nThe way SRH is translated could also influence the proportion of\npeople reporting poor health. Bzostek et al.31 showed that translation\nissues between Spanish and English language versions of the SRH\nquestion may give rise to some of the differences between Hispanic and\nnon-Hispanic US respondents. This may also be relevant for differences\nobserved between French and English language versions, particularly\nregarding the use of the word `fair', which is translated by `moyen' in\nFrench, a word that could connote a more negative meaning than `fair'\ndoes in English.\nThe proportion of people reporting FL increased as level of education\ndecreased in both countries. This gradient was similar in France and the\nUSA, suggesting that strong social health inequalities exist for FL in both\ncountries. However, the most highly educated Americans reported similar\nFL rates to French people with the lowest education level. Banks et al.29\nhave also shown that Americans with the highest levels of education have\ncomparable rates of diabetes and heart disease to those in the bottom\neducational stratum in England. Reasons for health differences between\ncountries are complex, and are likely to be affected by differences between\nhealth systems and access to care. Health insurance coverage is not\nuniversal in the USA and is much more dependent on socio-economic\nresources than in France. Some Americans have no health insurance, even\namong people with the highest level of education. However, the\nproportion of those with no health insurance in the top income tertile\nis low,29 suggesting that access to care is not likely to be the main ex-\nplanation for health differences between the USA and France. Differences\nbetween France and the USA in the prevalence of risk factors such as\nobesity or income inequality as well as differences in social capital32 may\nalso be relevant in explaining this phenomenon. However, Banks et al.29\nshowed that differences in the distribution of risk factors were not the\nmain explanation for the poorer health of Americans compared with the\nequivalent English population. Why highly educated Americans present\nrates of disease comparable to poorly educated people living in countries\nlike France or England is worthy of future investigation.\nTable 3 Proportion of people reporting poor SRH, according to educational level and presence or absence of FL, in France and the USA\nYears of education\nUS men French men\nFL (%)\nUS women French women\nFL (%)\na: Results from logistic regression models adjusted for age, reference group = No.\nb: Interaction between FL and SRH according to educational level.

As we said before, US\nand French categories for SRH were different and could partly explain\nthis paradox. However, regardless of the indicator used, cultural differ-\nences in the understanding and meaning of health could also play a role.\nThe reference point or normative category in the scale may be different in\ndifferent cultural environments.10 As Idler and Benyamini suggest,2 the\nresponse scale measuring SRH may be used differently depending on\ncultural and linguistic conventions in describing normal health. This is\nin accordance with Jurges11 who showed that the French tend to under-\nestimate their health, as do the Germans. Desesquelles et al.30 also showed\nthat French people with IADLs rated their health as being worse than\nItalians in the same situation, highlighting the influence of cultural en-\nvironments on perceptions of health status.\nOur results show that the relationship between health conditions and\nSRH is modified by educational level and that this phenomenon exists in\nboth France and the USA. The impact of FL on SRH was greater for the\nhighest educational level compared with the lowest, in France and in the\nUSA. Therefore the use of SRH as a measure of health for evaluating\nsocial inequalities could lead to underestimation of the real magnitude of\nhealth inequalities existing within and between countries. Future studies\nusing social indicators other than education are needed, as are interna-\ntional studies evaluating how people from different cultures understand\nand evaluate the notion of health, how they understand SRH and select\ntheir specific health category. These are important considerations that\nneed to be taken into account in attempting to understand health differ-\nences between socio-economic groups or populations.\n"
