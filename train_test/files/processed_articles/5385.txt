Peripheral nerve block techniques have been proposed in cats undergoing onychectomy but\nevidence of efficacy is lacking. Preliminary tests of the described technique using cadavers resulted in incomplete\nstaining of nerves. The aim of this study was to develop nerve block methods based on cadaveric dissections and\ntest these methods with cadaveric dye injections.\nMethods Ten pairs of feline thoracic limbs (n = 20) were dissected and superficial branches of the radial nerve\n(RSbr nn.), median nerve (M n.), dorsal branch of ulnar nerve (UDbr n.), superficial branch of palmar branch of\nulnar nerve (UPbrS n.) and deep branch of palmar branch of ulnar nerve (UPbrDp n.) were identified. Based on\nthese dissections, a four-point block was developed and tested using dye injections in another six pairs of feline\nthoracic limbs (n = 12). Using a 25 G \u00d7 5/8 inch needle and 1 ml syringe, 0.07 ml/kg methylene blue was injected\nat the site of the RSbr nn., 0.04 ml/kg at the injection site of the UDbr n., 0.08 ml/kg at the injection site of the M n.\nand UPbrS n., and 0.01 ml/kg at the injection site of the UPbrDp n. The length and circumference of each nerve that\nwas stained was measured.\nResults Positive staining of all nerves was observed in 12/12 limbs.

Another reason for the controversy is a\nbelief that onychectomized cats are more likely to\ndevelop behavioral problems.2 Regardless, in North\nAmerica it is still a commonly performed procedure,2\u00ad5\nwith an estimated 15.5 million cats undergoing onychec-\ntomy every year.4 Owner satisfaction with this proce-\ndure is reported to be high.3 However, it is generally\nagreed that onychectomy is associated with pain.6 Many\ncats display overt lameness at the time of discharge from\nthe hospital,2 and objective gait analysis has shown that\nlimb function does not return to preoperative values\n12 days after onychectomy.6 Furthermore, chronic pain/\nneuropathic pain following surgical onychectomy has\nbeen described.2\nThe best way to avoid pain associated with onychec-\ntomy is to not perform the procedure, but when it is per-\nformed, it is incumbent on veterinarians to use the most\neffective means of providing comprehensive analgesia.\nMultiple methods for the alleviation of perioperative\npain associated with this procedure have been described,\nincluding irrigation of surgical incisions with bupiv-\nacaine before closure.6,7 Local analgesics are commonly\nutilized preoperatively in an attempt to block nocicep-\ntive input, avoid central sensitization, reduce the amount\nof systemic analgesic required and decrease hospitaliza-\ntion time.8\u00ad10 In the case of onychectomy and indeed any\nother anticipated painful procedure of the distal thoracic\nlimb, this would involve effective blockade of the nerves\nthat innervate the manus, including the superficial\nbranches of the radial nerve (RSbr nn.), the median nerve\n(M n.), the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve (UDbr n.),\nthe superficial branch of the palmar branch of the ulnar\nnerve (UPbrS n.) and the deep branch of the palmar\nbranch of the ulnar nerve (UPbrDp n.). Use of bupiv-\nacaine administered as a four-point regional nerve block\nprior to onychectomy in cats has been proposed.11\nHowever, in one study, no additional benefit from this\nblock over systemic buprenorphine administration was\nfound in cats undergoing forelimb onychectomy.7\nThe most commonly used technique for local anes-\nthetic block in cats undergoing onychectomy appears to\nstem from a single case report.11 Preliminary data that\nwe obtained from critically testing this technique using\ncadaver limbs and injections of dye indicated frequent\nincomplete staining of targeted nerves (see\nsupplementary material). Given that a successfully per-\nformed nerve block is one of the most effective means to\nmanage pain,12 we re-evaluated the injection techniques.\nThe aims of this study were to review the anatomical\nlocation of the RSbr nn., M n., UDbr n., UPbrS n. and\nUPbrDp n. in relation to palpable anatomical landmarks\nand identify clearly defined injection sites that may pro-\nvide a comprehensive blockade of the distal thoracic\nlimb. An additional aim of this study was to test the\ndefined sites using volumetrically relevant injections of\ndye in cadaver limbs. Our ultimate goal was to establish\na peripheral nerve block technique that may provide\neffective analgesia for cats undergoing distal thoracic\nlimb surgery.\nMaterial and methods\nCadaver dissections\nTen pairs of cadaveric thoracic limbs were obtained from\ndomestic shorthair cats (nine castrated males and one\nspayed female) that had been euthanized with an intrave-\nnous overdose of pentobarbital (Fatal Plus solution;\nVortech Pharmaceuticals) for reasons unrelated to this\nstudy. Mean \u00b1 SD body weight was 4.0 \u00b1 0.9 kg. The\nlimbs were disarticulated at their muscular attachment to\nthe thoracic wall and stored immediately at -18 \u00b0C, then\nthawed at room temperature overnight prior to use.\nAnatomic dissection of the RSbr nn., M n., UDbr n., UPbrS\nn. and UPbrDp n. from the level of the mid-antebrachium\ndistally was conducted to determine palpable landmarks,\nanatomic variations, fascial planes and associated struc-\ntures. During dissection, potential injection points and\nlandmarks that would guide injection were recorded.\nThe accessory carpal bone (ACb) was established as a\nreference landmark because it is relatively fixed, and an\neasily palpable landmark in the live animal. The location of\neach putative injection point was recorded using measure-\nments taken relative to the ACb in the transverse and sagit-\ntal planes by the same person (ME) (see `Measurements'\nand Figure 1), and simultaneously the descriptive relation-\nship to anatomical landmarks was recorded. Based on\nthese findings, a subcutaneous, perineural injection tech-\nnique using four injection sites was developed for the RSbr\nnn., M n., UDbr n., UPbrS n. and UPbrDp n.\nDye studies\nBased on the results of the cadaver dissection study, a peri-\nneural four-point injection technique was used for `block-\nade' of the RSbr nn., M n., UDbr n., UPbrS n. and UPbrDp\nn. Twelve additional thoracic limbs from six cats (three\nintact male and three intact females) that were euthanized\nfor reasons unrelated to this study were used. Mean \u00b1 SD\nbody weight was 4.0 \u00b1 0.9 kg, and individual body\nweights were used to calculate the volume for a 0.5% bupi-\nvacaine dose of 1 mg/kg per limb. Using a 25 G \u00d7 5/8 inch\nneedle and a 1 ml syringe, an equivalent volume\n(0.2 ml/kg per limb) of new methylene blue (NMB [New\nMethylene Blue Stain; Jorgensen Laboratories])\ndistributed as 0.07 ml/kg was administered at the injec-\nfor M n. and UPbrS n., and 0.01 ml/kg for UPbrDP n.\nApproximately 10 mins after the injections, dissection was\nperformed to expose each nerve. The length and circum-\nference of the stained portion of nerves were measured as\npreviously described.13 The proximity of dye to unstained\nor poorly stained nerves was noted.\nMeasurements\nAll measurements were made using Dial Calipers (Dial\nlimb positioning, all measurements were made with the\ncarpus extended to 180\u00ba and the elbow at an angle of\napproximately 45\u00ba. The measurements made are detailed\nin Figure 1. The confluence point of the cephalic vein\nand accessory cephalic vein was established as the tar-\nget injection point of the RSbr nn. in order to block these\nFigure 1 Description of the measured parameters used to evaluate the proposed injection sites for distal limb nerves.\n(Right) Craniocaudal view.

(a) Superficial branches of radial nerve (RSbr nn.). A 25 G \u00d7 5/8 inch needle is\ninserted subcutaneously (SC) from a point at the center of the limb at the level of the antebrachiocarpal joint. The needle is advanced approximately 10 mm SC at a 10\u00ad20\u00b0 angle\nto the long axis of the limb with the bevel facing up. Once the tip of the needle is 3\u00ad5 mm from the confluence point of the accessory cephalic and cephalic veins, the injection\nis made (0.07 ml/kg). (b) Dorsal branch of ulnar nerve (UDbr n.). A point is located lateral to and at the same level as the accessory carpal bone (ACb), positioned between the\nACb and the styloid process of the ulna (SpU). A 25 G \u00d7 5/8 inch needle is inserted SC distal to proximal so the tip lies at the midpoint of the groove formed between ACb and\nthe SpU, and then the injection is made (0.04 ml/kg). (c) Median nerve (M n.) and superficial branch of palmar branch of ulnar nerve (UPbrS n.): a 25 G \u00d7 5/8 inch needle is\ninserted SC at the distal border of the carpal pad and approximately 5 mm lateral to it, perpendicular to the long axis of the metacarpus, with the bevel facing up. The needle is\ninserted SC until the point is located two-thirds of the distance from the lateral aspect of the limb to the medial aspect. Two-thirds of the injectate volume is deposited at this point\nand the remaining volume is injected while the needle is withdrawn (0.08 ml/kg total). Gentle massage is applied to the injected volume under the skin for 5 s. Deep branch of\npalmar branch of ulnar nerve (UPbrDp n.): a 25 G \u00d7 5/8 inch needle is inserted almost perpendicular to the ACb in a mediolateral direction such that the needle contacts the\nmedial palmar aspect of the midpoint of the ACb with the bevel facing up. The needle is then redirected dorsally and advanced on the medial side of the ACb 2\u00ad3 mm until it\npenetrates the flexor retinaculum. At this point the injection is performed (0.01 ml/kg of injectate). Red dots indicate the site of needle insertion. The blue arrows represent the\ndirection of needle insertion to reach the desired injection site\nnerves before they branched distally into the digits. The\ndistance from the lateral aspect of the limb to the RSbr\nnn. (A), the width of the limb at the level of the injection\npoint of the RSbr nn. (B) and the distance proximally\nfrom the ACb to the RSbr nn. (C) were measured. The\ndistance from the ACb to the lateral epicondyle of the\nhumerus (D) was also measured. The ratios of A/B (E)\nand C/D (F) were calculated. The optimal injection\npoint for the UDbr n. was determined to be at the level\nof the ACb, on the lateral aspect, because at this point\nthe nerve is not covered with fascia. The distance from\nthe ACb to the UDbr n. (dorsal view) (G) and the width\nof the carpus at the level of the ACb (palmar view) (H)\nwere measured. The ratio of G/H (I) was calculated.\nThe area distal to the flexor retinaculum where the M n.\nand UPbrS n. descend, parallel to each other, was deter-\nmined to be an optimal injection point. The distance\nfrom the lateral aspect of the limb to the M n. (J), the\nwidth of the limb at the level of the injection point of the\nM n. and UPbrS n. (K), and the proximodistal distance\nfrom the ACb to the level of the M n. and UPbrS n. (L)\nwere measured. The ratio of J/K (M) was calculated.\nThe distance from the lateral aspect of the limb to the\nUPbrS n. (N) was measured and J-N (O) and the ratio of\nN/K (P) were calculated. The distance from the ACb to\nthe point where the UPbrDp n. turns deeply was meas-\nured (Q). For all measurements, the measurement point\non the ACb was defined as the center of the attachment\nof the flexor carpi ulnaris, humeral head. Measurements\nof nerve location were made using the center of the\nnerve.\nInjection technique\nEach limb was shaved on the dorsal aspect from the distal\nthird of the antebrachium to just distal to the carpus; on the\nlateral aspect at the level of the ACb; and on the palmar\naspect between the metacarpal pad and the carpal pad.\nThe blocks were performed as described below and the\ntechnique is described and illustrated in Figure 2(a\u00adc).\nRSbr nn. The limb was positioned with the dorsal aspect\nfacing upwards and the carpus in 180\u00ba of extension. A\npoint on the cranial antebrachium was identified that\nwas about 80% of the distance from lateral to medial\nand about 18 mm proximal to the level of the ACb\n(approximately the point of confluence of the accessory\ncephalic and cephalic veins). A 25 G \u00d7 5/8 inch needle\nwas inserted subcutaneously (SC) from a point at the\ncenter of the limb at the level of the antebrachiocarpal\njoint. The needle was advanced approximately 10 mm\nSC at a 10\u00b0\u00ad20\u00b0angle to the long axis of the limb with the\nbevel facing up. Once the tip of the needle was 3\u00ad5 mm\nfrom the confluence point of the accessory cephalic and\ncephalic veins, 0.07 ml/kg NMB was injected.\nUDbr n. The limb was positioned with the lateral aspect\nfacing upwards. A point was located lateral to and at\nthe same level as the ACb, positioned between the ACb\nand the styloid process of the ulna. A 25 G \u00d7 5/8 inch\nneedle was inserted SC from distal to proximal so that\nthe tip lay at the midpoint of the groove formed\nbetween the ACb and the styloid process of the ulna,\nand then injection of 0.04 ml/kg NMB was\nperformed.\nM n.and UPbrS n. The limb was positioned with the pal-\nmar aspect facing upwards. A point was identified\n11 mm distal to the ACb, approximately level with the\ndistal extent of the carpal pad. A 25 G \u00d7 5/8 inch needle\nwas inserted SC at the distal border of the carpal pad and\napproximately 5 mm lateral to it, perpendicular to the\nlong axis of the metacarpus, with the bevel facing up.\nThe needle was inserted SC until the tip was located\ntwo-thirds of the distance from the lateral aspect of the\nlimb to the medial aspect. Two-thirds of the injectate vol-\nume was deposited at this point and the remaining vol-\nume was injected while the needle was being withdrawn.\nA total volume of 0.08 ml/kg was deposited. Gentle\nmassage was applied to the injected volume under the\nskin for 5 s.\nUPbrDp n.The limb was positioned with the palmar\naspect facing upwards. A 25 G \u00d7 5/8 inch needle was\ninserted with the bevel facing up, almost perpendicular\nto the ACb in a mediolateral direction such that the nee-\ndle contacted the medial palmar aspect of the midpoint\nof the ACb. The needle was then redirected dorsally and\nadvanced on the medial side of the ACb 2\u00ad3 mm until it\npenetrated the flexor retinaculum. At this point 0.01 ml/\nkg NMB was injected.\nStatistics\nStatistical analyses were performed using JMP software\n(JMP Pro 11; SAS). Wilcoxon's signed rank tests were\nused to evaluate pairwise difference in measurements A\nthrough Q between left and right limbs and to compare\nbody weights between cadaver dissection and dye injec-\ntion parts of the study. Correlations between body\nweight and measurements A through Q were deter-\nmined using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.\nDifferences were considered significant at P <0.05.\nResults\nCadaver dissections\nThere were no significant differences between right limb\nand left limb for any measurements (A\u00adQ). The mean,\nSD, median, minimum and maximum of the measured\nand calculated parameters for the 20 limbs are shown in\nTable 1. The correlation coefficient of the measured or\ncalculated parameter with body weight is given for each\nparameter. There were significant positive correlations\nbetween body weights and A, B, C, D, H, I, K, L, M and\nQ. There was no significant relationship between body\nweight and the measurements E, F, G, J, N, O and P.\nDye test\nThere was no significant difference in body weight\nbetween cats in the dissection study and cats in the dye\nstudy. All the cats were of an unknown immature or\nearly mature adult age.\nPositive dye staining of all nerves was observed in\n12/12 limbs (Table 2). When targeting the RSbr nn., the\ndye was deposited too laterally in 1/12 limbs, resulting\nin patchy staining of the nerve. When targeting the\nUDbr n., the dye was located in the groove between the\nstyloid process of the ulna and the ACb, and stained the\nnerve well in all cases. For the M n. and UPbrS n., the\ndye appeared to spread under the superficial digital\nflexor tendon in 2/12 limbs owing to the injection being\nmade too deeply. This resulted in the injection being\ndeposited dorsal to the M n. in one case, and therefore\nonly the dorsal aspects of that nerve were stained well.\nThe nerves were stained well in the other case. The\ninjection was deposited intramuscularly (into the\nmedial edge of the ulnar head of the deep digital flexor\nimmediately proximal to the continuing deep digital\nflexor tendon) when targeting the UPbrDp n. in 1/12\nlimbs owing to the injection being made too medially,\nand not directly adjacent the ACb. This resulted in\npatchy staining of the nerve in this case. The dye stained\nthe nerve well in the other case. Overall, it was deter-\nmined that all nerves targeted were stained well and\nconsistently with this developed four-point injection\nmethod (Figure 2).\nDiscussion\nPreoperatively administered local anesthetics affect\npostoperative pain relief by blocking the transmission\nof nociceptive signals, thereby intercepting the nocice-\nptive message.14 This should help avoid cellular wind\nup and subsequent central sensitization that appears to\ncontribute to postoperative pain in clinical cases.15 A\nlocal nerve block together with systemic analgesia is\nrecommended for cats undergoing onychectomy.16\nHowever, neither the described techniques of nerve\nblockade nor irrigation of the wound with bupivacaine\nbefore skin closure have been shown to be associated\nTable 1 Measured and calculated parameters for the location of proposed injection sites for distal limb nerves\nMean Maximum Minimum Median SD CC\nSuperficial branches of radial nerve\n\n(D) Distance from the accessory carpal bone to lateral\nepicondyle of the humerus (cm)\nDorsal branch of ulnar nerve \n\n(H) Width of the carpus at the level of accessory\ncarpal bone (mm)\nMedian nerve \n\n(L) Proximodistal distance from the accessory\ncarpal bone (mm)\nSuperficial and deep branch of palmar branch\nof ulnar nerve\n\n*Significant correlation to body weight (P <0.05)\nCC = correlation coefficient\nwith beneficial analgesic effects, using subjective or\nobjective outcome measures.6,7 In our preliminary test-\ning, NMB dye injection using the currently described\nfour-point block technique resulted in incomplete\nnerve staining.11 The currently accepted injection tech-\nnique has not been described in depth,11 and this lack\nof a detailed description might be partially responsible\nfor the inaccuracy of the injections performed. The\nmost obvious deficit of the original technique is that\nthe injectate is likely to be deposited more medially\nthan the optimal injection point when targeting the M\nn., and this could result in intramuscular injection and\npoor blockade of the M n. In this report, we describe in\ndetail both the anatomical location of nerves in relation\nto palpable landmarks and a proposed nerve block\ntechnique. In our dye injection study using our pro-\nposed injection technique, all branches of nerves\nresponsible for innervating the feline thoracic limb\ndigits were successfully stained with NMB. This\ndetailed description and associated diagrams, we\nbelieve, will allow veterinarians to perform a more\nsuccessful nerve blockade. However, whether this\ndescribed technique results in a more successful nerve\nblockade needs to be clinically tested. We included cal-\nculations of ratios when developing the technique,\nassuming that the ratios we calculated would not be\naffected by body weight. However, several were, and\nso the described technique uses descriptions based on\nanatomical landmarks instead of calculated ratios. A\nshortcoming of this study was the lack of knowledge of\nthe specific age of the feline cadavers. However, we\nknow the cadavers were young animals that had\nalmost completed their maturity or were young adults\nand it is most typical for onychectomy to be performed\nin young cats.17 We therefore believe our results are\ngeneralizable to the target population of cats undergo-\ning declawing procedures. Furthermore, we also\nbelieve this nerve block technique is potentially useful\nfor cats undergoing other distal thoracic limb surgeries\nsuch as complete digit amputation, biopsy and fracture\nrepair.\nBupivacaine is known to cause cardiac and neurological\nside effects, and doses of bupivacaine recommended for\nperineural administration in dogs and cats are 1\u00ad2 mg/kg.18\nBupivacaine should not be administered intravascularly to\ncats.18 Although we did not detect any vascular trauma or\nintravascularinjection,precautionsshouldbetakentoavoid\nthis, including syringe aspiration to confirm an absence of\nintravascular needle position before injection is performed.\nFrom our observations during dissections, we believe that\nthe highest risk for intravascular injection is into the median\nartery, which courses in association with the M n. When tar-\ngeting the M n., keeping the needle as superficial as possible\nmay help to avoid the median artery, because the vessel lies\ndeep to the nerve. Our observations suggest that keeping\nthe injection superficial will also minimize the chance of a\npoor block of the M n.\nLimitations of this study include the use of cadavers\nand the use of NMB dye for injections. Because of the\npossible uptake of the local anesthetic solution by the\nlymph and blood vessels the distribution of injectate in a\nclinical patient may be different than that in cadavers.19\nWe used NMB as a substitute for local anesthetic solu-\ntion, but NMB distribution might not reflect the action of\nlocal anesthetics in vivo, where the action on the nerve\nfiber depends on several factors, including drug lipid\nsolubility, tissue pH and molecular weight.20\nAdditionally, although we estimated the circumference\nof the nerve that was stained, this is not easily assessed\naccurately, as previously reported.13\nTable 2 Degree of new methylene blue distribution on the surface (length and circumference stained) of each nerve\nMean Maximum Minimum Median SD\nSuperficial branches of radial nerve\nDorsal branch of ulnar nerve \nMedian nerve \nSuperficial branch of palmar branch of ulnar nerve \nDeep branch of palmar branch of ulnar nerve \nConclusions\nAll branches of nerves responsible for innervation of the\nfeline thoracic limb digits were successfully stained with\nNMB using the described four-point injection technique.\nTo assess the utility and effectiveness of this distal limb\nnerve block injection technique it should be evaluated in\nclinical patients.\nSupplementary material Degree of new methylene blue dis-\ntribution on the surface of each nerve using a four-point block.\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Alice Harvey for\nthe medical illustrations and to Wendy Savage for the photog-\nraphy.
