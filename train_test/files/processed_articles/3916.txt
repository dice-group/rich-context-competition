In the discipline of\nfinance, the decision of dividend payment is considered as\none of the financial management decisions (Brealey, Mayers,\n& Allen, 2012), which mainly reflects corporate dividend\npolicy. Theoretically, the behavior of paying dividend actu-\nally signals the profitability of the business, and it is distrib-\nuted among U.S. shareholders after it is taxed first at the\ncorporate level and then at the personal level (Hines, 1996).\nRegular payouts of dividends are generally valuable to indi-\nvidual shareholders who possess intermittent irrational\nbehavior (Shefrin & Statman, 1984). In other words, the\ndividend process represents the remaining disposition of\norganizational reserves after the lucrative investment oppor-\ntunities are capitalized; therefore, dividend tax rate (if it\nremains constant over a period of time) should not affect the\ndividend payment behavior (Auerbach, 1979; Bradford,\nIndeed, firms adjust their dividend policies in accordance\nwith the amount of earnings they hold (Al-Ajmi & Hussain,\n2011). Dividend payment behavior has been analyzed by dif-\nferent authors, for example, while studying dividend pay-\nment behavior of 25 common and civil law countries firms,\nFerris, Sen, and Unlu (2009) revealed a diminishing trend\ndividend paying firms. The academic and professional litera-\ntures have concluded that the dividend payment patterns\nhave been decreasing significantly for more than two\ndecades. This is mainly because of the structural composi-\ntion of different firms in the United States as well as their\ninability to generate enough profits to be distributed among\nshareholders. In fact, these business organizations tend to\nretain the total earnings to capitalize on various profitable\ngrowth opportunities. Moreover, according to Doyle (1994),\nthe companies tend to strengthen their marketing plans\n(called right-handed organizations) to put major emphasis\non customer orientation besides incorporating measures to\nsubstantially improve their financial plans (called left-\nhanded organizations). It is, therefore, important to note that\nalthough firms tend to distribute dividends among sharehold-\ners but often in the form of inconsistent or irregular pattern.\nThis dividend payment policy is usually exerted by the com-\npanies that observe significant variations in their level of\n1Iqra University, Karachi, Pakistan\nCorresponding Author:\nMuhammad Nadeem Khan, Assistant Professor, Department of\nManagement Sciences, Iqra University, Karachi 75300, Pakistan.\nEmail: khan.n@iuk.edu.pk\nA Sectoral Analysis of Dividend Payment\nBehavior: Evidence From Karachi Stock\nExchange\nMuhammad Nadeem Khan1 and Moona Shamim1\n Keywords\nsectoral, dividend, payment behavior, panel data, KSE\n2 SAGE Open\nFurthermore, the relationship of dividends has been stud-\nied with other variables too. For instance, Basse and\nReddemann (2011) noted a positive relationship between the\ndividends and inflation and hence argued that companies\ntend to increase their dividend payments mainly during the\ninflationary period. Notably, in the context of Pakistan, it has\nbeen observed that both ownership structure and cash flows\nare the main determinants of corporate dividend policy (Afza\n& Mirza, 2010), which, in turn, may be used to determine\nstock price volatility (PV; Nazir, Nawaz, Anwar, & Ahmed,\nPreviously, authors have also emphasized financial man-\nagers to look into the significant pattern of dividend pay-\nments (Cheng, Cullinan, & Zhang, 2014). The traditional\nnotion that the dividend policy may be used to determine the\nmarket value of the company has been criticized by Miller\nand Modigliani (1961). In contrast, it is also believed that\nearning is the main factor, which sets the mode of dividend\npayment behavior (Baker, Sasdi, Dutta, & Gahndi, 2007;\nStatement of the Problem\nEquity market is considered as the backbone in mounting\nfunds to build a national economy, whereas a capital market\nplays an integral role in mobilizing domestic and foreign\nresources so that it could assist stakeholders in making better\nfinancial decisions. It not only serves as the most productive\nmedium for long-term usage of funds but also eases the pro-\ncess of the efficient allocation of resources.\nIn the context of emerging markets, such as Vietnamese\nstock market, the findings of Tran and Nguyen (2014)\nrevealed the utilizations of the stable dividend policy using\nfixed-effect model in the country. Similarly, a few scholars\nstudied dividend payment behavior in Karachi Stock\nExchange (KSE), which is the largest capital market of\nPakistan. The equity market of the country was considered\nas one of the emerging markets by International Finance\nCorporation (IFC) in 1991 whose pace was initially very\nslow; however, it was reemerged following the new millen-\nnium. Notably, the performance of the equity market was\nIn addition, the history of dividend payments could be the\ninfluencing factor for the investors, who intend to initiate\ntheir savings for the mobilization of economic growth. The\ndeterminants that influence dividend payments have been dis-\ncussed by different authors (e.g.,Afza & Mirza, 2010;Ahmed\nJohn & Muthusamy, 2010; Ramachandran & Packkirisamy,\n2010). In fact, the nature, characteristics, and efficiency of\ndividend policies of emerging markets differ from developed\nTran & Nguyen, 2014).Although researchers have the similar\nviews about the nature, characteristics, and efficiency of divi-\ndend policies in the developing markets, very little is known\nregarding these three facets in the context of emerging mar-\nkets. Therefore, it forms the basis of this study to analyze the\ndeterminants of dividend policy behavior in Pakistan.\nThe contributions of this article are twofold. First, this\nstudy provides a sector-wise analysis of the payment behav-\nthrough 2013. Second, it also identifies the relationship\namong different dividend payment variables of 15 non-\nfinancial sectors during the aforementioned time period. The\nresults of this study will help investors visualize the ongoing\ntrends amid these sectors. Besides, it would also contribute\nto the ongoing discussion of factors that influence dividend\npayments behavior particularly in the context of an emerging\nmarket. More specifically, the study will help those investors\nwho mainly plan to rotate their portfolio of investment\nopportunities with review to achieve optimum profits.\nReview of Empirical Studies\nIt is observed that dividends are disappearing mostly in the\nU.S. market because there is a decreasing trend in the num-\nber of firms paying dividends. Two very common reasons for\nthis phenomenon include characteristics and tendency of\nfirms to pay dividends (Fama & French, 2001). According to\ncatering theory, managers accommodate investors for pay-\nment of dividends when premium on stock price is available\nand do not pay when an investor does not have a desire of\ndividends (Baker & Wurgler, 2004). Consequently, propen-\nsity to pay high dividend depends on dividend premium;\nhence, it will be low when negative dividend premium exists.\nOn the same lines, Abdulkadir, Abdullah, and Wong\n(2016) investigated the dividend payment behavior in\nNigeria by taking the data of 126 non-financial firms cover-\nior has been investigated by incorporating clientele, catering,\nand life cycle theories using the variables such as dividend\npayment (as outcome variable) and foreign, premium,\nretained earnings, firm size, return on assets (ROA), invest-\nments (INV), cash flows (CF), leverage (LEV), precious\nyear dividend, financial crises, stock market performance,\nand interest rates (as explanatory variables). Results of panel\nlogistic regression revealed a decreasing trend of dividend\npayment due to an increase in the foreign investments. They\nnoted that foreign investors have less preferences on receiv-\ning dividends due to the involvement of tax.\nSimilarly, Duscha et al. (2016) pointed out renewable\nenergy sources (RES) development, which can show an\nimportant part in European economy up to 2030. The objec-\ntive was to increase security, job, and growth opportunities\nby reducing the low carbon in the economy. The idea of triple\ndividend was used by development of RES in Europe up to\n2030. They used detailed techno-economic model and two\nmacroeconomic models. Results support the expected triple\nKhan and Shamim 3\ndividend up to 2030 despite a decrease in role of European\neconomy as a technology provider to the rest of the world.\nIn addition, Bremberger, Cambini, Gugler, and Rondi (2016)\nexplained the impact on dividend policy by focusing on differ-\nent regulatory and government-controlled environment. The\npanel data were used to check the relationship of dividend pay-\nout with cost-based versus incentive-based and state-owned\nversus privately owned regulated firms in the European listed\ncompanies. The findings were consistent with the cost-based\nregulated firms, which smoothly maintain their dividend policy\nas compared with the incentive-based firms. It is also found that\nalthough the government-regulated firms are weak in efficiency,\nthe shareholders are given an increased amount of importance\nwhile devising the dividend policy.\nBesides, Manneh and Naser (2015) studied dividend of\nnon-financial companies of Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange\n(ADX), which is one of the emerging market in Asia. The\nstudy mainly concentrated on manufacturing, services, food,\nenergy, telecommunications, and property and real estates.\nThey found a significant and positive relationship between\ndividend policy and earnings in ADX. The findings of this\nstudy have been found consistent with agency theory, which\nholds that dividend is negatively associated with the leverage.\nFurthermore, Sikes and Verrecchia (2015) pointed out the\nrelationship between dividend tax capitalization and liquidity.\nTheoretical analysis showed a positive impact of liquidity mod-\nerates dividend taxes on expected rates of return, whereas\nempirical analysis was adjusted on Jobs and Growth Tax Relief\nand Reconciliation Act of 2003, which minimizes the gap\nbetween maximum statutory dividend and capital gain taxes.\nResults also provide evidence to institutional ownerships, which\nmitigates the repercussion of taxes on dividend capitalization.\nIn addition, Javakhadze, Ferris, and Sen (2014) examined\nthe dividend smoothing globally based on agency model and\nthe theories that explain the irregular dividend information.\ncountries was drawn, which have less market-to-book ratio\nand less cash involvement in larger dividend smoothing. The\nanalysis of initial outcome emphasized that the firms with\nless amount of cash reserves tend to maintain dividend\nsmoothing. The findings also suggested that ownership con-\ncentration has a negative impact on dividend smoothing.\nMoreover, the governance has shown a negative effect on\ndividend payment behavior.\nBesides, Sharma and Pandey (2014) constructed a non-\nparametric model, which shows dividend payment behavior\nof Indian Stock Market. There are no signaling effects of\neither increased or decreased dividend found in their study.\nHowever, it is also revealed that due to inefficiencies in the\nstock market, adjustments in prices are made once any rele-\nvant information is provided to the market.\nSimilarly, Cheng et al. (2014) provided the evidence of divi-\ndend payment behavior of cross-listed companies operating in\nFree cash flow plays a vital role in the case of cross-listed\ncompanies for distribution of dividend. Results concluded that\ncross-listed companies'dividend are normally lower than other\nlisted companies. It is also found that more responsive dividend\npolicies of cross-listed companies and the relationship of divi-\ndend behavior are considered more volatile with the free cash\nflow and development breaks.\nIn addition, Musiega, Alala, Douglas, Christopher, and\nRobert (2013) analyzed the determinants of dividend policy\nDividend payout was the dependent variable, whereas profit-\nability, growth, earning, and liquidity were taken as indepen-\ndent variables. Moreover, size and risk were used as\nmoderators. Results showed that return on equity, size, and\ngrowth have a positive impact on dividend payout.\nLikewise, Nnadi, Wogboroma, and Kabel (2013) investi-\ngated determinants of dividend policy of 29 listed firms in\ntheAfrican Stock Exchange. By using unit root test and Tobit\nregression, the study revealed that government, age, market\ncapitalization, and earning per share have positive influence\non dividend policy in African listed firms.\nSimilarly, Al-Ajmi and Hussain (2011) reviewed the corpo-\nrate dividend decisions in SaudiArabia by using a sample of 54\nthat most of the Saudi firms pay small amount of dividends out\nof their earnings. It is further reported that fixed dividend policy\nare not used by these firms and they tend to change or adjust\ntheir dividend policies according to the amount of earnings they\nobserve. The authors determined that four factors actually influ-\nenced the dividend policy decision in the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia: (a) more profitability, (b) large firms, (c) firms that paid\ndividends in previous period, and (d) the firms occupying rela-\ntively fewer investment opportunities.\nMoreover, Basse and Reddemann (2011) explained the\ninflation and the dividend policy of U.S. firms by using the\nof long-run relationship was applied on variables including\ndividends, corporate earnings, real growth, and inflation.\nThe results showed that there is a stable long-run relationship\nbetween all these variables and there is also a positive rela-\ntionship between the dividends and inflation. The study also\nrevealed that companies mostly increase their dividend pay-\nments during inflationary environment.\nBesides, Abor and Bokpin (2010) evaluated the effect of\ncorporate finance and investments on dividend policy in 34\neffect panel model was used in the analysis using the vari-\nables such as profitability, leverage, debt, external financing,\nand stock market capitalization representing corporate\nfinance. The results showed that stock market capitalization\nand profitability were more significant determinants of divi-\ndend policy; however, non-significant impact of leverage,\ndebt, external financing was recorded on dividend policy.\nBesides, the results also revealed that there is a significant\nassociation between investment opportunities and dividend\npolicy. They concluded that firms that belong to developed\n4 SAGE Open\nmarkets are more focused toward paying least possible divi-\ndends to their shareholders.\nIn addition, Nazir et al. (2010) evaluated the role of corpo-\nrate dividend policy in determining the stock PV in Pakistan by\ntechniques used were fixed-effect and random-effect regres-\nsion, with the test involving PV as dependent variable and divi-\ndend yield as independent variable. It is suggested that the\ndividend policy have effect of stock PV in Pakistan.\nLikewise, John and Muthusamy (2010) investigated the\nrelationship between leverage, growth, and profitability on\npayout ratio in Indian paper industry by using the data of top\n10 paper firms listed on Bombay Stock Exchange based on\nsales. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression was used and\nsecondary data were collected from Center of Monitoring\nIndian Economy. Growth in sales, earning per share, price\nearnings ratio, market-to-book value, cash flow, leverage,\nliquidity, and ROA were used as independent variables to\npredict dividend payout. Results showed that there is a nega-\ntive relationship between leverage and dividend payout.\nSimilarly, Ramachandran and Packkirisamy (2010) ascer-\ntained the impact of firm size on dividend payment behavior\nwith reference to corporate firms across industrial estates in\nSectors were selected including cement, chemical, and fertil-\nizer, information technology, oil and gas, pharmaceutical,\nshipping, and textile. The variables used were capital struc-\nture, dividend payout, and dividend per share. It is reported\nthat dividend per share of different sizes of firms in India is\ndependent on the level of debt and capital structure.\nIn addition, Afza and Mirza (2010) pointed out the owner-\nship structure and cash flows as determinants of corporate\ndividend policy in Pakistan by using the data of 100 listed\nused to assess the impact of firm size, management, lever-\nage, and profitability on dividend payout and its intensity.\nThe results showed that a negative relationship between the\nmanagerial ownership, cash flow sensitivity, firm size, and\nleverage; however, a positive relationship exists between\noperating cash flow and profitability with the cash dividend.\nLikewise, Al-Kuwari (2010) determined different factors\nthat influenced the corporate dividend payout decision of firms\nlisted on Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states by using the\nRadom effects Probit model was used to analyze the impact of\ngovernment ownership, free cash flow, market capitalization,\ngrowth rate, firm leverage, business risk, and firm profitability\non dividend payout ratio. The results revealed that the govern-\nment ownership, company profitability, and company size\ncould be significant predictors of paying dividends.The authors\nalso concluded that payment of dividend may help reduce\nagency conflicts, save the minority interests, and increase the\ngood reputation of firms in the market.\nBesides, Fargher and Weigand (2009) compared the\ncross-sectional differences between profits, risk of volatile\nmarket-to-book value ratio, and returns before and after the\ninitiating regular cash dividend payments for the period\nin the study. It included different variables such as return on\nequity, ROA, market-to-book value, market capitalization,\ndebt to asset and profit margin. The results suggested that the\npayment of dividends is mainly distributed by those firms\nthat are at their maturity stage of life cycle.\nSimilarly, Ferris et al. (2009) carried out an international\nanalysis of dividend payment behavior by using the sample of\n2007. The methodology used a logistic regression model. The\nresults of both common and civil law regimes showed a\ndecreasing trend; however, there was an increasing trend in\npercentage of non-dividend paying firms. It was, therefore,\nsuggested that a decline in the payment of dividend can affect\nshareholders'primacy and initial faith on governance.\nIn addition, Ahmed and Javid (2009) investigated the\ndeterminants of dividend policy in Pakistan by using a sam-\n2006. Two parameters Lintner model was used to assess the\ndividend policy. The results showed that majority of the\nlisted non-financial firms set their dividend policy on the\nbasis of current earnings and dividend per share because both\ninvestment opportunity and leverage have inverse relation-\nship on firms' dividend policy.\nFinally,Al-Malkawi (2008) examined the factors influencing\ncorporate dividend policy decision of publicly quoted companies\nin Jordan.AProbit model was used to investigate a sample of 15\nconcluded that the firm size, profitability, and the age of the firm\nare the major factors in making dividend policy decisions.\nNotably, the study also revealed a negative impact of financial\nleverage in making dividend policy decisions.\nVariable Characteristic in the Expectant of\nObserved Literature\nDividend payout (DP). It is a ratio that measures the relation-\nship between the earnings belonging to the ordinary share-\nholders and the dividend paid to them. It is calculated as\ndividend paid to shareholders divided by net profit after tax\navailable to equity holders. Dividend payout ratio is used in\nmost of the studies to determine the dividend payment per-\nGrowth in sales (GS). It is the amount of increased sales as com-\npared with the previous year. When firms need to increase their\nsales in future, more funds are needed to finance the level of\ninventory and cost of goods sold. Therefore, firms have to retain\ntheir earnings and cut down the dividend payment (Holder, Lan-\nrelationship with the payment of dividends.As the sales increase\nin future, payout may also increase.\nKhan and Shamim 5\nHypothesis 1: Growth in sales has a significant impact on\nthe dividend payout on the companies listed in KSE.\nEarnings per share (EPS). It measures the profit available to\nthe equity shareholders on a per share basis, or the amount\nthat they can get on every share held. It is calculated by\ndividing the profits available to the equity shareholders by\nthe number of the outstanding shares. The financial literature\nprovides evidence that there is an increase in dividend pay-\nout when earnings per share increase (Ahmed & Javid, 2009;\nHypothesis 2: Earning per share has a significant impact\non the dividend payout on the companies listed in KSE.\nLeverage (LEV). It is the employment of an asset or source of\nfinance for which a firm pays fixed cost or fixed return.\nThere are many studies available that identify a negative\nrelationship between dividend payout and leverage (Ahmed\nPackkirisamy, 2010). When firms have to pay fixed amount\nof cost, then it is seen that dividend payout declines as a\nresult of interest cost payment.\nHypothesis 3: Leverage has a significant impact on the\ndividend payout on the companies listed in KSE.\nFree cash flow (FCF). It represents the cash available for payment\nof dividend and other future business expansion, and is calcu-\nlated from operating cash flow after subtracting capital expendi-\nture. It represents the cash that a company is able to generate\nafter laying out the money required to maintain or expand its\nasset base. For payment of dividend, it is very important for the\nfirm to hold free cash flow and it has a significant relationship\nHypothesis 4: Free cash flow has a significant impact on\nthe dividend payout on the companies listed in KSE.\nReturn on equity (ROE). Return on equity is the measure of\nthe profitability and an important explanatory variable\naccording to many previous studies (Fama & French, 2001;\nratio of net profit and shareholders' equity. It is used as the\nproxy of profitability in most of the situations.\nHypothesis 5: Return on equity has a significant impact\non the dividend payout on the companies listed in KSE.\nData and Method\nFerris et al. (2009) conducted an international analysis of\ndividend payment behavior by using the sample of 25\ncountries (nine common law and 16 civil law) data from\nanalyze the sector-wise dividend payment behavior of\nKSE-listed companies. The sample period of this analysis\ntaken from KSE website and State Bank library/website.\nFor achieving the objectives, this study is divided into two\nparts. In the first part of the study, data have been taken\nfrom all the 32 sectors (financial and non-financial) listed\ndividend payment behavior among all the 32 sectors. The\nability of complete data set.\nIn the second part of analysis, data of 21 non-financial\nsectors were used to find correlation between dependent\nand independent variables. The reason of elimination of\nfinancial firms is the regulation of these firms is very dif-\nferent from non-financial firms, which may affect our\nresults. Then, we exclude six sectors from the sample\nbecause some of the sectors have too few firms with the\navailability of data to allow the statistical technique.\nFinally, pooled ordinary lest square (POLS) is used for\n2013. Model and variables used in this research were divi-\ndend payout (DP) as depended variable and growth in sale\n(GS), earning per share (EPS), leverage (LEV), free cash\nflow (FCF), and return of equity (ROE) as independent\nvariables.\n= + + +\n+ + +\n  \n  \nVariables Description\nDividend payout (DP) Ratio measures the relationship\nbetween the earnings available to\nthe ordinary shareholders and the\ndividend paid to them.

In the first\npart, descriptive analysis provides behavior of all sectors\nof KSE for the analysis of sector-wise behavior after the\nond part, a complete explanatory research is carried out by\nusing the POLS applied on 15 sectors on 5 years' data\nvariables.\nDescriptive Analysis\nIn first part of this study of sectoral analysis, initially all 33\nsectors of KSE had been selected, but one sector data were\nnot available; therefore, it was excluded from our list. The\nselected sectors were oil and gas, chemicals, forestry and\npaper, industrial metal and mining, construction and materi-\nals, general industrial, electronics and electrical equipment,\nindustrial engineering, industrial transportation, support ser-\nvices, automobile and parts, beverages, food producers,\nhouseholds goods, leisure goods, personal goods, tobacco,\nhealth care equipment and services, pharma and biotech,\nmedia, travel and leisure, fixed-line telecommunication,\nelectricity, gas water and multiutilities, banks, non-life insur-\nance, life insurance, real estate investment and services,\nfinancial services, equity investment instruments, software\nand computer services, and, finally, technology hardware\nTable 1 shows sectoral analysis for all 32 sectors in terms\nof dividend paid or not paid. In 2009, the numbers of dividend\nSimilarly, in 2010, numbers of dividend payers were increased\noccurred mainly in personal goods sector, which in 2009 had\npanies out of total 122 companies. Personal goods sector rep-\nresents textile base companies, which is one of the major\nsectors of Pakistan in terms of number of firms. It is the sec-\nond largest manufacturing industry that contributes 8.5% of\nGDP. Therefore, an increasing trend has been observed in\ninstruments, the same tendency was seen and it was increased\nfrom 11 to 31 companies. In the third column, we analyze the\npercentage changes of dividend payers in 2010. Increasing\ntrend is observed in nine sectors: 33% in industrial metals and\nmining, 20% in general industries, 82% in personal goods,\n12% in food producers, 33% in fixed-line telecommunica-\ntion, 18% in banks, 55% in non-life insurance, 75% in finan-\ncial services, and 182% in equity investment instruments.\nPakistan is a developing economy and an increasing trend in\nindustrial metals and mining provides sustainable future\ngrowth. An increase in general industries is the continuous\nneed of industrial metals for manufacturing support of the\ncountry. Increasing demand of technology and cable facility\nduring the last decade was quite remarkable, which boasted\nthis sector, and as a result, the investment amount increased\nand the payment of dividend has also increased. Expend of\neconomic services has boasted the financial sector of Pakistan,\nas compared with the past several years. Increasing the num-\nber of banks in private sector is the root cause of increase in\ninvestment in this sector, which increased dividend payment.\nIncrease in equity instrument shows the investor behavior of\nindividuals and firms toward the maximization of their long-\nterm wealth. The main implications of increase in nine sectors\nare inter-linked with one and another. This would bring it\ncloser to the investors for making investment decisions.\nThere is also a decreasing trend in five sectors, which\ninclude 20% in construction and materials, 29% in industrial\nengineering, 100% in support services, 10% in automobiles\nand parts, and 20% in household goods. In the last column,\nthe total percentage of dividend payers is given on the basis\nof total number of companies in each sector, and then the\nsector. Table 2 shows that in 2010, the number of dividend\n2011, the number of dividend payers remained almost the\nwere multiple factors of this result. Oil and gas sector\n2011. The construction and materials increased from four to\numn, the percentage changes of dividend payers in 2011\nhave been given. There is no major difference in the overall\npercentage change. Increasing trend is observed in eight sec-\ntors, which include 33% in oil and gas, 6% in chemicals,\n150% in construction and material, 29% in Pharma and bio-\n12% in non-life insurance. There is also a decreasing trend in\n10 sectors, including 20% in industrial engineering, 7% in\nfood producers, 13% in personal goods, 50% in tobacco,\n25% in fixed-line telecommunication, 33% in life insurance,\n14% in financial services, 3% in equity investment instru-\nment, 100% in software and computers services, and 25% in\nhousehold goods. In the last column, the total percentage of\ndividend payers on the basis of total number of companies in\neach sector has been described, and then the changes in 2010\nmainly due to personal goods sector. Dividend paying com-\npanies were 211, which was fairly due to decreased in almost\nall sectors including oil and gas, 25%; chemical, 28%; indus-\ntrial material and mining, 25%; construction and material,\nTable 1.

This procedure emphasizes the development of\ncombined information from the time-series dimension with\nthat obtained from the cross-sectional dimension, in the hope\nof making inferences about the existence of unit roots.\nIn analysis of all sectors, results of Table 3 clearly show\nall the variables are stationary at first difference, which sug-\ngests there is a long-term relationship in the series of\nvariables.\nAfter applying stationary test, now data can be analyzed\nby applying pooled ordinary lest square (POLS) test to check\nthe significance of the model that is developed in the \"Data\nand Method\" section.\nEstimation for POLS\nResults are shown in Table 4. Variables are used to find the\nrelationship among all the sectors with EPS, ROE, GS, LEV,\nand FCF as independent variables and DP as a dependent\nvariable.\nEarnings per share. The results of Table 4 show the EPS has\na positive significant impact on DP in beverages, travel and\nleisure, fixed-line telecommunication, food processors,\nhousehold goods, personal goods, automobiles, and electric-\nity. This happens when the earnings are increasing and com-\npanies want to distribute these earnings to shareholders,\nwhereas forestry (paper and based) has a negative significant\nrelationship with the dividend payout ratio. Earnings per\nshare are generally considered to be the single most impor-\ntant variable in determining a share's price. This happens due\nto retention of earnings. It happens, when companies are in\ngrowing face, and the procedure of residual dividend policy\nis a very common phenomenon, in which first companies\ncover their capital expenditure and then remaining amount\nwould be paid as dividend.\nReturn on equity. The results of Table 4 show that ROE has\nsignificant positive relationship with DP in chemical, for-\nestry, and tobacco sectors (Afza & Mirza, 2010). ROE is the\nmeasure of profit; therefore, an increase in the return will\ncause result to increase in dividend payment. ROE has a neg-\native significant relationship with the DP in oil and gas, con-\nstruction and materials, engineering, beverages, travel and\nleisure, fixed-line telecommunication, household goods, per-\nsonal goods, pharma and biotech, and electricity. ROE is the\nmeasure of profit and growth. Benefits of profit come from\nre-investment in the company, which will give high growth\nrate in future to investors.\nGrowth sales. The results of Table 4 show that GS has posi-\ntive significant impact on DP in oil and gas, construction and\nmaterials, engineering, and household goods. Increase in the\nsales as compared with previous year causes the result to\nincrease in profitability and, as a consequence, would ulti-\nmately increase dividend payment, but chemical, forestry,\nand food producer have a negative significant relationship\nwith the dividend payout ratio. This result shows that com-\npany has not been distributing their earnings even if sales are\ngrowing. A company's market share has a big force on its\nfuture growth in sales. Sometimes companies want to\nincrease market share, and for this purpose, retaining of earn-\nings is very important.\nLeverage.The results of Table 4 show that leverage have a\npositive significant relationship with DP in forestry, tobacco,\ntravel and leisure, fixed-line telecommunication, food pro-\ncessor, and personal goods. This result is also apparent when\ncompanies obtain debt to purchase fixed assets or sometimes\ntotal business to increase or diversify in the market. This\nleads to an increase in stock prices, and in such a situation,\ncompanies have to pay dividend, but oil and gas, household\ngoods, and pharma and biotech have a negative significant\nrelationship with the dividend payout ratio (Afza & Mirza,\nMuthusamy, 2010). It shows as the level of debt or total debt\nincreases in the firm's capital structure, it may cause deceas-\ning trend in the dividend payment. This phenomenon occurs\ndue to an increase in the amount of interest payment; there-\nfore, leverage may cause a decrease in DP.\nFree cash flow. The results of Table 4 show free cash flow has\na positive significant relationship with DP in fixed line. The\npresence of free cash flow is a healthy sign, which indicates\nthat a company has cash for payment of dividends. If a com-\npany has a large amount of earnings, but does not have cash,\nthen it will not be able to pay dividends to shareholders.\nLikewise, chemical, forestry, construction and material,\nengineering, beverages, tobacco, travel and leisure, food pro-\ncessor, household goods, pharma and biotech, and automo-\nbiles have a negative significant relationship with the\ndividend payout ratio. A negative relationship of free cash\nflow shows that companies put most of their cash into invest-\nment opportunities. This happens when a firm is in liquidity\ncrunch, and needs to purchase inventory and additional\nworking capital for expending credit to customers.\nTable 3.

In the second part of analysis, Augmented\nDickey Fuller (ADF) conventional panel unit root test and\npanel OLS techniques were used. DP was used as a depen-\ndent variable and EPS, FCF, GS, LEV, and ROE were used\nas independent variables.\nResults show that EPS has a positive impact on DP in\neight sectors (beverages, travel and leisure, fixed-line tele-\ncommunication, food processors, household goods, personal\ngoods, automobiles, and electricity), whereas forestry (paper\nand board) has a negative significant relationship with the\ndividend payout ratio. Besides, FCF has positive impact on\nDP in only one sector (fixed-line telecommunication),\nwhereas chemical, forestry, construction and material, engi-\nneering, beverages, tobacco, travel and leisure, food proces-\nsor, household goods, pharma and biotech, and automobiles\nhave a negative impact on DP.\nSimilarly, GS in sales has a positive impact on DP in four\nsectors (oil and gas, construction and material, engineering,\nhousehold goods); however, chemical, forestry, and food\nprocessor have negative impact on DP. In addition, LEV has\na positive impact on DP in six sectors (forestry, tobacco,\ntravel and leisure, fixed-line telecommunication, food pro-\ncessor, and personal goods), whereas oil and gas, household\ngoods, and pharma and biotech have a negative impact on\nDP. Moreover, ROE also has a positive impact on DP in three\nsectors (chemical, forestry, and tobacco); however, oil and\ngas, construction and material, engineering, beverages, travel\nand leisure, fixed-line telecommunication, household goods,\npersonal goods, pharma and biotech, and electricity have a\nnegative impact on DP.\nIt is observed that dividend payment behavior has impor-\ntant connections and transformations among the sectors.\nMostly, once a company starts paying dividend, it looks\nforward to continue this practice. Results document a few\ncharacteristics related to the ability to pay dividends among\nfirms based on the profitability, riskiness, and life cycle.\nThe differences that do occur are related to size and growth\nopportunities.\nIt can be recommended that firms should focus on its\ninternal policies as all factors that are part of the study relate\nto the internal financial strength of the firm and most of them\nare found to be more or less effective. It is also recommended\nto the managers of the firms to consider external factors\nwhen they decide dividend policy. Without considering\nexternal factors and characteristics of the firms, making a\ndividend decision will be imprudent. Investors who desire\ndividend but not high dividend may focus on either paying or\nnon-paying dividend firms. In contrast, those who desire\nhigh dividend should focus on factors that affect payment of\ndividend. It is also suggested to the policy makers that corpo-\nrate-level policies have an important impact on liberalization\nof the stock market. Decreasing the trend of dividend pay-\nment may attract the other type of investment opportunities,\nsuch as an increase of the foreign investors to channeling of\nextra funds. At the same time, local investors may be irate\nwith non-payment of the desired level of dividend. Therefore,\nit is suggested to the policy makers to protect the interest of\nthe domestic investors. A higher level of cash flow is desired,\nso its maintenance should also be done by taking all neces-\nsary measures. Net income is the core reason of all business\nactivities, and it should be given importance because it\nincreases earning per share of the firms. Effective internal\nmanagement that can help in increasing sales growth should\nbe hired, which will make firms more rewarding for the\ninvestors who mostly take their decisions after considering\ndividend payouts of previous years.\nEven though the objective of this study more or less has\nbeen achieved, there are certain limitations that need to be\naddressed. First, due to unavailability of data, sample size is\ncult to generalize the results completely. Second, as it is an\nempirical research, this study is limited to measure and use\nbecause environmental properties may affect the results.\nFurther research can be done by considering financial sec-\ntors, which are also being considered by investors while tak-\ning their investment decisions. Dividend payouts has been\nused as dependent variable and it is considered as one of the\nmost dependable factors by the investors, but there are other\nfactors that would have been considered by the investors,\nwhich can be used for future research, such as corporate gov-\nernance and internal management.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbdulkadir, R.
