Few national estimates exist of the hospitalizations attributable to RSV, and re-\ncent advances in prophylaxis warrant an update of these estimates.\nObjectives To describe rates of bronchiolitis-associated hospitalizations and to es-\ntimate current hospitalizations associated with RSV infection.\nDesign and Setting Descriptive analysis of US National Hospital Discharge Survey\nParticipants Children younger than 5 years who were hospitalized in short-stay, non-\nfederal hospitals for bronchiolitis.\nMain Outcome Measure Bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization rates by age and\nyear.\nResults During the 17-year study period, an estimated 1.65 million hospitalizations\nfor bronchiolitis occurred among children younger than 5 years, accounting for 7.0\nmillion inpatient days. Fifty-seven percent of these hospitalizations occurred among\nchildren younger than 6 months and 81% among those younger than 1 year. Among\nchildren younger than 1 year, annual bronchiolitis hospitalization rates increased 2.4-\nhospitalization rates for bronchiolitis increased significantly (P for trend .001), while\nhospitalization rates for lower respiratory tract diseases excluding bronchiolitis did not\nvary significantly (P for trend = .20). The proportion of hospitalizations for lower res-\npiratory tract illnesses among children younger than 1 year associated with bronchi-\nthis proportion increased from 5.4% to 16.4%. Averaging bronchiolitis hospitaliza-\nnual bronchiolitis hospitalizations among children younger than 1 year were related\nto RSV infection.\nConclusions During 1980-1996, rates of hospitalization of infants with bronchiol-\nitis increased substantially, as did the proportion of total and lower respiratory tract\nhospitalizations associated with bronchiolitis. Annual bronchiolitis hospitalizations as-\nsociated with RSV infection among infants may be greater than previous estimates for\nRSV bronchiolitis and pneumonia hospitalizations combined.\nSee also Patient Page.\nthrough 4 years were hospitalized an-\nnually for bronchiolitis or pneumonia\nassociated with RSV.\nRecent progress in 2 areas warrants\nupdating national RSV-associated hos-\npitalization estimates. First, the Food\nand Drug Administration recently li-\ncensed palivizumab, a humanized mu-\nrine RSV monoclonal antibody for\nmonthly intramuscular administra-\ntion among high-risk children during\nRSV seasons to prevent lower respira-\ntory tract disease hospitalizations.15\nPalivizumab is easier to deliver and less\nexpensive than the previously avail-\nable prophylactic antibody prepara-\ntion, RSV-enriched human immuno-\nglobulin, which must be intravenously\nadministered. Recommendations from\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics re-\ngarding use of both products among\nhigh-risk infants are available.16 Sec-\nond, advances in the development of\nsafe subunit and live attenuated RSV\nvaccine candidates have been re-\ntalization estimates, we examined tem-\nporal trends in hospitalizations among\nUS children associated with bronchi-\nolitis, the most specific RSV-associ-\nated illness. We estimated recent RSV-\nassociated hospitalizations by using\ndischarge data for bronchiolitis and\nused bronchiolitis and pneumonia\nhospitalizations to estimate RSV-\nassociated morbidity among infants.\nMETHODS\nNational Hospital Discharge Survey\n(NHDS) through the National Center\nfor Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).20 The NHDS is a representative\nsampleofpatientdischargerecordsfrom\nshort-stay,nonfederal,generalandchil-\ndren's hospitals in the United States.21\nHospitalizations were weighted using\nNCHSprocedurestoobtainnationales-\ntimates.22 NHDSrecordsdonotcontain\nindividualidentifiers;therefore,theunit\nof analysis was a hospitalization.\nAll discharge records from children\nyounger than 5 years with an Interna-\ntional Classification of Diseases, Ninth\nRevision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-\nCM) code for any respiratory illness\nas 7 discharge diagnoses listed were\nselected for study.
