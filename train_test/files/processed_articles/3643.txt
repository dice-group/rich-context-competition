    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is one of the most studied candidate genes related to essential hypertension\n(EH) and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Some studies have focused on the relationship between -344C/T polymorphism\n(rs1799998) in the CYP11B2 gene and LVH, but the results are controversial. This meta-analysis is purposed to reveal the\nrelationship between the -344C/T and the left ventricular structure and function, including left ventricular end diastolic\ndimension (LVEDD), left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD), left ventricular mass/left ventricular mass index (LVM/\nLVMI), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT), and interventricular septal wall thickness (IVS).\nMethods: A literature search of PubMed and Embase databases was conducted on articles published before January 27,\n2014. The odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Heterogeneity analyses were performed using meta-\nregression. Tests for publication bias were also performed and biased studies should be removed from subsequent analyses.\nResults: There were 20 studies with a total of 6780 subjects meeting the inclusion criteria. The main finding was that\nconcentration levels of LVEDD and LVESD were higher in CC homozygous individuals than in TT homozygous individuals\nin the whole group. In the Asian subgroup, TT homozygous individuals had larger IVS than CC homozygous individuals.\nIn the Caucasian normotension subgroup, CC homozygous individuals had larger LVM/LVMI than TT homozygous\nindividuals. In the Asian essential hypertension subgroup, TT homozygous individuals had larger LVPWT values than CC\nhomozygous individuals.\nConclusions: The present findings support the hypothesis that CC homozygous individuals may have greater left\nventricular diameters (LVEDD and LVESD) regardless of their ethnicities or physical conditions.\n",

Over the years, electro-\ncardiography has become the first choice for the definite\ndiagnosis of LVH, particularly in hypertensives.2 LVH was\ndiagnosed mainly by left ventricular mass (LVM) or left\nventricular mass index (LVMI) in ultrasonic cardiography.3\nBetween 30% and 70% of the population variability in\nLVH appears to be genetically determined.4\u00ad6 In this way,\nfocusing on the specific genes that influence quantitative\nAssociation of echocardiographic left\nventricular structure and -344C/T\naldosterone synthase gene variant:\nA meta-analysis\nLijuan Wang1, Jiapeng Zhou2,3, Bei Zhang1, Hao Wang1, Mei Li1,\nQiuli Niu1, Yubao Chen2, Runsheng Chen3 and Shaojun Wen1\n Keywords\nCardiovascular disease, left ventricular structure, CYP11B2 -344C/T, echocardiography, meta-analysis\n1Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University and Beijing\nInstitute of Heart Lung and Blood Vessel Diseases, China\n2Beijing Computing Center, Beijing Academy of Science and\nTechnology, China\n3Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China\nCorresponding author:\nShaojun Wen, Capital Medical University and Beijing Institute of Heart\nLung and Blood Vessel Diseases, Anzhen Road 2, Beijing, 100029, China.\nEmail: wenshaojun@aliyun.com\nL.W. and J.Z. contributed equally to this work\nOriginal Article\nvariation in left ventricular structure is merited, and the\nfindings may generate insights into the pathogenesis of\ncardiac hypertrophy. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone\nsystem (RAAS) has been shown to influence myocardial\ngrowth independently of hypertension, and it has been\nspeculated that the polymorphisms of genes coding this\nsystem may explain the heritability of LVH.\nAldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is a key enzyme in\nRASS. In 1998, Kupari et al. originally reported the\nassociated with left ventricular size and LVM.7 Then a\nlarge number of studies seeking to link the -344C/T poly-\nmorphism to LVH were conducted in individuals of differ-\nent races and ethnic groups using different statistical\nmodels in various left ventricular structure and function\nindicators, but the results have often been unreproduci-\nble.8\u00ad13 A meta-analysis regarding the relationship between\nThis meta-analysis covered 14 studies that were performed\nmainly on Europeans, but in recent years, many studies\ncovering other ethnic groups, especially Asians, have been\npublished.14 In recent studies, sample size is much greater\nthan previously. Here, all available data were collected and\nthe influence of the -344C/T polymorphism on the left\nventricular structure and function, such as LVM, left ven-\ntricular end diastolic dimension (LVEDD), and left ven-\ntricular end systolic diameter (LVESD), was systematically\nevaluated.\nMethods\nLiterature search\nTo identify all the studies that addressed the association\ntricular structure and function, a systematic computerized\nliterature search of PubMed and Embase databases (up to\nMarch 5, 2014) was conducted using the following key-\nwords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms:\n(aldosterone synthase or CYP11B2) and (gene(s) or\nvariant(s) or polymorphism(s) or allele(s)) and (left ven-\ntricular). Search results were limited to studies on human\nsubjects. We searched the articles without language limita-\ntion. The full text of the retrieved studies was scrutinized,\nand all of the references cited in the articles were searched\nto identify potentially relevant studies. All the articles\nwere organized by year of publication and first author.\nThey were entered into a dedicated literature database.\nSelection criteria. The studies had to meet all the following\ncriteria. Inclusion criteria: (1) The articles had to include at\nleast one of the following echocardiographically measured\ntraits: LVM, LVMI, left ventricular end diastolic volume\nindex (LVEDVI), LVEDD, left ventricular end systolic vol-\nume index (LVESVI), LVESD, left ventricular posterior\nwall thickness (LVPWT), and interventricular septal wall\nthickness (IVS). (2) Only research articles and clinical tri-\nals were included. (3) Eligible articles had to provide suf-\nficient information to extract or calculate for the CYP11B2\n-344C/T genotype number of subjects and the mean and\nstandard deviation (SD) of continuous left ventricular\nstructure/function indicators. (4) If the eligible article was a\ncase-control study, both case and control groups had to be\ninvolved and the genotype distribution of control popula-\ntion had to obey the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE).\nDuplicates were removed. Exclusion criteria: Studies\ninvolving non-echocardiographically measured phenotypes\nand studies assessed by magnetic resonance imaging were\nexcluded. Studies in patients with specific disorders, such\nas renovascular diseases and renal dysfunction, were\nignored. Data based on follow-up studies involving phar-\nmacological interventions according to -344C/T were also\nexcluded.\nData extraction. Two investigators (LW, JZ) read through\nall the research articles and extracted and calculated the\nrequired statistics and relevant information independently.\nInconsistencies were discussed between the two investiga-\ntors until a consensus was reached on all items. For all\nstudies included, the following information was collected:\nyear of publication, first author, country, journal, racial\nmakeup of the study population, demographics, sex, age,\nsources of recruitment, character of participants (e.g. kinds\nof diseases or healthy), allelic and genotypic frequencies\nof the -344C/T, left ventricular phenotypes corresponding\nto -344C/T, and confirmation of diagnosis. If allele fre-\nquencies were not given, they were calculated from the\ncorresponding genotype frequencies of the case and the\ncontrol groups.

These values were found to be equal to\nthose of an additive genetic model with selective and\nextreme genotypes. Empirically, the studies were\nregrouped into subsets by ethnicity and physical condi-\ntion and the meta-regression analyses were repeated for\nthe new subsets.\nSensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the\nreliability of meta-regression results and to detect any\nuncertainty.17 Sensitivity analyses were conducted by\nsequentially deleting a single study each time in an attempt\nto identify the influence of the individual data sets on\npooled effect sizes. If the point estimate of the combined\neffect size with one study omitted lay outside the 95% con-\nfidence intervals (CIs) of the estimate with all available\nstudies, then the study in question was considered to have\nexcessive influence and was omitted. In addition, a regres-\nsion with confounding factors as covariates was also con-\nducted, and p values < 0.1 were considered statistically\nsignificant.4\nPublication bias was assessed using visual inspection of\nfunnel plots and the Egger regression intercept method. P\nvalues < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nAsymmetrical funnel plots and p values < 0.05 of the cor-\nresponding Egger's test suggested obvious publication\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nFigure 1 shows the process of literature searching and fil-\ntering.

SF-1 is necessary for the develop-\nment of adrenal glands and other steroidogenic tissues and\nfor expression of most of the enzymes involved in adrenal\nsteroid biosynthesis;7 -344C/T is located in the promoter of\nthe CYP11B2 gene and might influence the gene expression\nby affecting the binding of the SF-1 transcription factor. A\nprevious study showed that the -344C allele binds to the\nSF-1 binding site more strongly than the T allele does in\nvitro.43 Several studies have shown that BP is higher in CC\nand TC than in TT individuals. Some studies have also\nshown the -344C allele to be associated with increased left\nventricular size and decreased baroreflex sensitivity in\nhealthy people.44 This supports the results of the present\nmeta-analysis with respect to the NM Caucasian subgroup\nwith n < 200 (CC had larger LVM/LVMI than TT, pheterogene-\nity\nKupair et al. observed that LVM increased with the\nnumber of copies of -344C in young adults.7 Delles et al.\nalso found that CCs had greater LVEDD than those with\nthe TTs in arterial hypertension, suggesting that CC geno-\ntype might be associated with early LVH.8 A recent, large,\ngenome-wide association study of BP traits also supported\nT.45 Those results showed that the -344C allele may be\nmore strongly associated with large left ventricular size.\nIn the present study, differences were found only during\ncomparisons of homozygotes (additive genetic model with\nselective/extreme genotypes) in LVM, IVS, LVEDD,\nLVESD, and LVPWT. Under the dominant model, no sig-\nnificant association was detected between the CYP11B2\n-344C/T polymorphism and left ventricular structure.\nHomozygote/extreme genotypes showed extreme pheno-\ntypes, and additive genetic models with selective/extreme\ngenotypes may have more power. The present meta-\nanalysis was also performed using the recessive model\n(TT+TC vs CC). No significant differences were found\neven in subset analyses.\nThe present results have to be interpreted within the\ncontext of their limitations. First, there was detectable het-\nerogeneity among studies. To reduce the effect of hetero-\ngeneity, studies were regrouped according to covariate\nregression analyses. An association was found between all\nin some sub-group analyses without heterogeneity (phetero-\ngeneity\n> 0.05). The results of subgroup heterogeneity may\nbe more reliable than the results of the total group with\nheterogeneity. Second, there was publication bias for stud-\nies reported on the association of LVEDD or LVESD with\nmation of pooled association between these two traits and\nof pooled association on LVM, IVS, and LVPWT were\ncredible. Last, we searched PubMed and Embase data-\nbases. Some studies could not be searched in these two\ndatabases, including some in local languages, and could\nnot be included in our study. Because of this, the recall\nratio of literature retrieval might be affected.\nThrough covariate regression analyses under homozy-\ngote comparison, sample size, age, sex, patient character-\nistics, design, DBP, and SBP were found to influence the\nleft ventricular echocardiographic variables in addition to\nethnicity. In the table of covariate regression analyses\n(Table 3), number of participants, age, sex, participant\ncharacteristics, year of publication, DBP, and SBP showed\nsignificant differences (p < 0.05) in at least two left ven-\ntricular structure traits out of the five, which indicated that\nmany factors besides ethnicity could also affect the left\nventricular structure, and different traits may be affected\nby different factors.\nIn conclusion, the present findings support the hypoth-\nventricular diameter (LVEDD, LVESD) regardless of eth-\nnicity or physical conditions. The same allele (e.g. the C\npopulations, but this merits deeper study. Confounding\nfactors, such as the sample number, age bracket, sex ratio,\ncharacteristics of the participants, year of publication, and\nBP were found influence to the results of the association\nList of abbreviations\nAF: atrial fibrillation; CVD: cardiovascular diseases;\nDCM: dilated Cardiomyopathy; EH: essential hyperten-\nsion; HCM: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; HF: heart fail-\nure; IVS: interventricular septal wall thickness; LVEDD:\nleft ventricular end-diastolic diameter; LVESD: left ven-\ntricular end-systolic diameter; LVM: left ventricular mass;\nLVMI: left ventricular mass index; LVPWT: left ventricu-\nlar posterior wall thickness; MI: myocardial infarction;\nNM: normotension; No.: the number of participants in the\nstudy; pe\n: Egger's statistic for publication bias; pheterogeneity\n:\nthe Q statistic for heterogeneity; pvalue\n: the statistical sig-\nnificance of the pooled estimate.\nAuthors' contributions\nLW and JZ researched, designed and read through all the research\narticles.
