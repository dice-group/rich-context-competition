The growing importance of search engines and social media is changing this.\nIncreasingly, people find news via digital intermediaries, in particular the dominant\nsearch engine Google and the dominant social networking site Facebook, and advertisers\ngo to them for cheap, targeted, online advertising. A growing number of news organiza-\ntions across the world report that only about half their online traffic comes direct to their\nwebsite and app, with the rest coming from search and social referrals (Bell, 2014; Bell\net al., 2016). The audience analytics company Parse.ly estimates that Google and\nFacebook in 2015 each accounted for about 40% of all referral traffic to publishers (with\nYahoo and Twitter a distant third and fourth at less than 5% each).1 Survey data support\nthe idea that search and social is becoming increasingly important for how people get\nnews online--in some countries, digital intermediaries are by now more widely used\nways of accessing and finding news than the websites and apps of news organizations\nThe largest digital intermediaries not only have literally billions of users across the\nworld but also account for a large part of the time people spend with digital media, and are\nintegral to more and more of the things we do online (Pasquale, 2015; Plantin et al., 2017;\nVan Dijck, 2013). Their general rise also makes them ever more important for news spe-\ncifically. Their role in driving traffic and referrals to sites is increasingly supplemented by\nnew formats enabling off-site publishing, where news media organizations publish direct\nto formats such as Facebook's Instant Articles (launched in May 2015), Snapchat's\nDiscover (launched in January 2015), or use products such as Google Accelerated Mobile\nPages (AMP; launched in October 2015). These products mean people can increasingly\nuse news content without going to the website or app of the publisher who produced it.\nSearch engines and social media thus not only drive traffic through referrals (the rise of\ndistributed discovery). They also present snippets of news in search results and social\nfeeds, and host content that can be consumed completely off-site on a third-party plat-\nform, whether as articles or videos (the rise of distributed content; Cornia et al., 2016).\nMany media organizations have embraced the opportunities afforded by the rise of\nsearch and social media, and newsrooms increasingly work systematically with search\nengine optimization and social media optimization as part of wider audience engagement\nor growth teams (e.g. Dick, 2011). Search engines and social media empower news\nmedia organizations by offering them new opportunities for reaching people. But they\nalso challenge the privileged position news media organizations have historically occu-\npied (Ganter and Maurer, 2015) because working with them involves losing control over\nchannels of communication and raise the risk of becoming dependent on new intermedi-\naries. As one social media editor we spoke to as part of our research put it with remark-\nable clarity, \"my job is to think about how we survive in a world dominated by Google\nand Facebook.\"\nIn this article, we analyze how news media organizations deal with digital intermedi-\naries. We focus on a strategic case study of a large, digitally strong, European legacy\nnews media organization with a relatively solid revenue base and analyze how editorial\nand strategic leaders handle relationships with the two currently most important digital\nintermediaries, Google and Facebook. On the basis of interviews with 13 people with\ndifferent roles within the case organization, most of them in senior positions, we provide\nan in-depth case study and show that the relationship in this case is characterized by a\ntension between (1) short-term, operational, often editorially led pursuit of the opportu-\nnities offered by both search and social to reach people and (2) more long-term strategic\nworries about whether the organization will become too dependent on these intermediar-\nies, including worries over whether it will lose control over its editorial identity, access\nto user data, and central parts of its revenue model. We argue that the way the case\norganization handles the relationship is shaped by a fear of missing out, by the difficul-\nties of evaluating the risk/reward ratio of engaging with different initiatives developed\nby the intermediaries, and by a sense of a profound asymmetry as a large news media\norganization finds itself dealing with far larger digital intermediaries. We suggest that\nwhen a strategic case study like ours--which is in a more privileged position than many\nother news media organizations--sees itself as losing control even as it actively pursues\nopportunities offered by digital intermediaries, less privileged news media organizations\nare even more likely to do so.\nThe implication is that news media, seen by media scholars and historians as having\ndeveloped into an increasingly independent institution in the course of the 20th century\n(Thompson, 1995), are becoming dependent upon increasingly powerful digital interme-\ndiaries that structure the media environment in ways not only we as individual citizens\n(Van Dijck, 2013) but also large, resource-rich, powerful organizations have to adapt to.\nIf this is the case for news media organizations, the implications for actors and organiza-\ntions occupying a less privileged position in the media environment--such as political\ncampaigns, social movements, and many other organizations--is likely to be at least as\nprofound. If large media organizations are losing control over the most important chan-\nnels of communication as these are increasingly shaped by digital intermediaries, others\nare likely to become even more dependent on these for their communications.\nIn the first part of the article, we outline the growing importance of digital intermedi-\naries for news media organizations. In the second, we position our case study in relation\nto the two main academic fields of research we draw on, digital journalism studies and\nplatform studies. In the third part, we lay out the rationale behind the strategic case study\nchosen and describe the data and methods our argument is based on. In the findings sec-\ntion, we first analyze the tension between short-term operational and long-term strategic\nconsiderations in how the case organization deals with intermediaries and then turn to the\ncombination of a fear of missing out, difficulties of evaluating risk/reward, and sense of\nasymmetry that we argue shape the relationships analyzed. In the final, concluding part,\nwe discuss the wider implications and identify questions for further research.\nThe rise of digital intermediaries\nWe use the term digital intermediaries to refer to companies such as Google and\nFacebook that have come to occupy central positions in the media environment in large\npart by intermediating between ordinary users and a wide variety of other parties--in\nthe case of Google by providing by far the most popular search engine for people navi-\ngating the open Web and selling advertising around search results and other services, in\nthe case of Facebook by developing by far the most popular social networking site and\nselling advertising around users' newsfeed. By mid-2016, Google attracted more than\n2billion monthly users and accounted for an estimated 31% of digital advertising glob-\nally across its various activities, Facebook 1.6billion monthly users and 12% of digital\nadvertising.2\nThere are other important digital intermediaries, including companies such as Apple\nandAmazon and some regionally important players, but none rival Google and Facebook\nin terms of their importance for how people find and access news (see, for example,\nNewman et al., 2016). These companies are sometimes referred to, and sometimes refer\nto themselves, as \"platforms,\" a term that suggests an element of openness and neutrality\nthat captures aspects of how they enable action and transactions between different parties\nbut rests awkwardly with their dominance and the fact that while they provide public\nservices and constitute public spaces, they do so for private gain as for-profit companies\n(Gillespie, 2010). Digital intermediaries are different in important ways--Google deeply\ninvested in the open Web and Facebook in building its own proprietary ecosystem--but\nshare a similarly important position and ability to shape the overall media environment.\nThey can exercise structural forms of what David Grewal (2008) has called \"network\npower\" because they can shape key parts of the environment by changing standards that\nmany others rely on and because they bring together so many different users on one\nplatform.\nThe degree to which people say they get news via search engines and social media\nversus directly via news websites and apps varies from country to country, but in many\nhigh-income democracies, search engines and social media are now more widely used\nways of finding and accessing news online than going direct to news media (Newman\net al., 2016). A growing number of scholars argue that we as a consequence are moving\ntoward a more complex information environment where conventional forms of editorial\ngatekeeping are being supplemented in important ways by new forms of filtering\nThe development to a point where, according to Emily Bell (2014), \"the public sphere\nis now operated by a small number of private companies, based in Silicon Valley\" has\nbeen a rapid one, starting in the 2000s, but accelerating significantly since 2010. News\nmedia organizations have reacted in different ways. Details vary by country and by\norganization, and more research is needed to systematically map them, but three basic\nreactions can be identified at this stage. First, most simply coexist with platforms, and\nreactively adapt to the ways in which the dominant digital intermediaries develop new\nproducts and services that sometimes restructure and reconstitute how information is\nshared, accessed, and used. The basic position is, \"They are huge. We are tiny. What do\nyou expect us to do?\" A few have confronted the digital intermediaries over what they\nperceive to be unfair or even illegitimate use of their content as aggregated, displayed in\nsearch results, or shown within social networking sites. One high-profile example is the\nUS-based News Corp. Their Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch has publicly warned\nthat \"[people's] ability to access information, independently and meaningfully, is put at\nrisk by the overwhelming power\" of the dominant digital intermediaries.3 Finally, some\nnews media organizations are offered opportunities to collaborate with the dominant\ndigital intermediaries and have seized them. Given the American origins of companies\nsuch as Google and Facebook, this opportunity has been offered primarily to a limited\nnumber of prominent, English-language, primarily US-based media, that have been\ninvited to discuss new features and products, offer feedback and suggestions, have had\nearly/privileged access to features or products, and so on. But more and more news\nmedia elsewhere are invited to collaborate. Our case organization is one of them. As one\nsenior social media editor told us, \"We have good relationships with these companies, we\ntalk to them regularly, they talk to us, we share products.\"\nDigital journalism studies and platform studies\nThe rise of digital intermediaries, and the way in which they are restructuring the\nmedia environment in part by enabling and shaping new information flows, in part by\ncapturing large shares of advertising, and in part through other organizations adapting\nto their growing importance, has largely escaped the focus of existing work on techno-\nlogical change and digital journalism. A rich vein of work has examined how the jour-\nnalistic profession and existing news media organizations appropriate new technologies\nand develop them for their own purposes. Scholars have examined phenomena ranging\nfocused on how different organizational structures, work practices, conceptions of the\naudience, and structural contexts influence how \"old\" professions and organizations\nfocus has been on how professional values and organizational inertia led news media\nto \"domesticate\" or \"normalize\" new technologies and privilege defensive, reaction-\nary, and pragmatic responses (e.g. Boczkowski, 2004; Singer, 2005). This line of work\nrecognizes how technological developments can contribute to change but tends to\nhighlight the importance of how journalists and news media themselves shape the\ntechnologies they use.\nWhile full of insights when it comes to why journalists and news media develop web-\nsites and ways of using digital, social, and mobile media in specific ways, this line of\nresearch has less to say about how news media adapt to the wider, ongoing, transforma-\ntion of the environment in which they operate. A growing number of researchers have\nrecognized this and called for a broader approach to understanding how news media not\nonly shape but are also shaped by broader technological developments (Braun, 2016;\nTo capture this, we turn to inspiration from the diverse emerging field of \"platform\nstudies\" in media and communication research (Gillespie, 2016; Just and Latzer, 2017;\nMontfort and Bogost, 2009; Plantin et al., 2017). Where the journalism studies scholars\ndiscussed above have tended to focus on individuals and organizations, and on contin-\ngent and incremental processes of change, researchers working in the broader field of\nplatform studies have focused on how the affordances of digital technologies affect\nactivities--ranging from game design (Montfort and Bogost, 2009) over video sharing\nThe key idea we take from platforms studies is the shift from focusing, like digital\njournalism research has done, on the appropriation of digital technology through spe-\ncific combinations of artifacts (websites, apps), practices (professional norms and rou-\ntines), and arrangements (newsroom structures), to instead focusing on how news media\norganizations adapt to the rise of platforms that restructure the media environment by\ndeveloping widely shared systems and services. We thus move beyond looking at how\nnews media appropriate specific technologies as tools for their own purposes\n(Boczkowski, 2004) to examine how they adapt to the development of broader techno-\nlogical systems with infrastructural aspects (robust, widely accessible, used by many\ndifferent actors, and increasingly integral to the media environment; Just and Latzer,\n2017; Plantin et al., 2017). The difference is between an approach interested in how spe-\ncific combinations of artifacts, practices, and arrangements shape the development of\nspecific discrete technological tools (such as a website or app), to how a combination of\nartifacts, practices, and arrangements shape how actors engage with a widely shared\ntechnological platforms (such as those offered by Google and Facebook).\nPlatform studies researchers push back against earlier optimism around the suppos-\nedly inherently democratizing, decentralizing, and indeed emancipatory potentials of\ndigital technologies. A range of scholars have begun to suggest we need to pay attention\nto the development of an environment of connected media with a few large and many\nsmall players and dominated by digital intermediaries that enable actions (and transac-\ntions between different third parties) at scale, but do so in self-interested ways (Gillespie,\n2016). The platforms provided by companies such as Google and Facebook host, organ-\nize, and enable public expression in ways that, as Jos\u00e9 van Dijck (2013) suggests, not\nonly shape social, political, and economic interactions by making some things much\neasier but also do so in ways that, while often claiming neutrality (as suggested by the\nterm \"platform\"), are developed primarily by private companies with their own interests\nThe point here is that search engines and social media can appear to simply be part of\nthe arena in which other organizations act--and have been treated by digital journalism\nstudies as such--but that platform studies remind us that these platform-builders are of\ncourse also actors with interests of their own, who engage directly with other actors. We\ndraw on this line of work here in focusing our analysis on how our strategic case is adapt-\ning in a situation where even large, resourceful, and powerful news media that till\nrecently occupied the commanding heights of our communication systems find them-\nselves having to contend with far larger and potentially more powerful digital intermedi-\naries with billions of users and billions in revenue continually restructuring the digital\nour study in turn brings to platform studies is a focus specifically on the relations between\ncompanies such as Google and Facebook and news media as an example of a previously\ndominant industry coming to terms with increasingly important digital intermediaries.\nMost research on digital platforms has focused on the platforms themselves and their\nrelations with ordinary, individual users and examined what Jos\u00e9 van Dijck (2013: 20)\ndescribes as \"the ongoing clash between user tactics and platform strategies.\" We build\non this and a longer tradition of work on how system-builders, ordinary users, and other\ndevelopers together shape the development of infrastructures (Plantin et al, 2017) by\nhighlighting the importance of analyzing the tactics used by news media organizations as\nthey face the rise of platforms, and provide a strategic case study examining this.\nCase selection, data, and methods\nThe news media organization we focus on is a strategic case study selected to enable\nlogical generalization (Luker, 2008). We arrived at the case inductively as part of a larger\nresearch project on relationships between different digital intermediaries and different\nnews media organizations across four countries. Not only has the case organization been\ninvited to collaborate with a range of digital intermediaries, and chosen to engage with\nthem. It also enters into these relations from a more privileged position than most other\nnews media, in the following four ways. First, it is a large organization with considerable\neditorial, technological, and strategic resources, as well as high audience reach and brand\nawareness. Second, it is recognized as a digital leader, and hence its engagement with\nintermediaries is less likely to be defined by conservatism, denial about the increasing\ncentrality of digital media, or a reactionary rearguard action to defend established ways\nof doing things. Third, it is a European organization and hence operates in a political\nenvironment where, broadly speaking, news media have relatively more political clout,\nand (US-based) digital intermediaries relatively less. Fourth, it is an organization that has\nin recent years maintained a more solid revenue base with less dramatic declines than\nmany other news media, and it thus has more autonomy in its strategic decision-making.\nThe case is not representative, but it is strategic, and though we cannot generalize from\na single case study in a statistical sense, our case study allows for logical generalization\nin that most news media organizations are likely to be less privileged in their dealings\nwith digital intermediaries than the case organization we analyze here.\nOur analysis is based on interviews with people working across editorial, product\ndevelopment, and strategic/management parts of the organization supplemented by off-\nthe-record background conversations as well as primary and secondary sources. Most of\nthe interviewees have senior roles in the organization, and our purposive sample is part of\na limited number of people who are involved in high-level negotiations and day-to-day\ndealings with different platforms. Together with colleagues, we have conducted 13 formal\ninterviews in the course of 2016. In addition, we have had off-the-record background\nconversations with several additional informants as part of newsroom visits, at industry\nevents, and so on. Because the relationship with digital intermediaries is sensitive, some-\ntimes fraught, and subject to some internal disagreement between different people within\nthe organization, we have anonymized both the case organization itself as well as the\ninterviewees, who we will simply identify with a broad description of their position. It has\nbeen difficult to get people to talk, let alone talk relatively openly, under these terms. It\nwould have been even more so without individual and organizational anonymity. The\ninterviews were semi-structured from 30minutes to more than 1hour. One interview was\nconducted over the phone, the rest in person. The interviews were transcribed and subject\nto an open coding guided by our analytical interest. We identified the features analyzed in\nthe findings section below inductively on the basis of our primary interview data, second-\nary sources including industry publications, and discussed our preliminary interpretations\nwith some of our later interviewees to test their reaction and improve our understanding\nof their thinking. In the interests of validity and reliability, we combined investigator tri-\nangulation (the two authors read and coded the interviews separately before discussing\nthem jointly and then re-read the material in an iterative process) and, where possible, data\ntriangulation (checking our interviews and analysis with primary sources from the organi-\nzation itself as well as secondary sources--these are not quoted, to maintain the anonym-\nity of both case organization and interviewees).\nFindings\nOperational versus strategic considerations\nAt the most basic level, our case organization's relationship with digital intermediaries\nsuch as Google and Facebook is characterized by a tension between (1) short-term, oper-\national, and often editorially led considerations and (2) more long-term strategic consid-\nerations focused on whether the organization will become too dependent on these\nintermediaries for reaching audiences and in the process will control over its editorial\nidentity, access to user data, and central parts of its revenue model. The two ways of\napproaching the relationship do not map perfectly on to occupational groups within the\norganization, as both short-term operational and long-term strategic work involve jour-\nnalists, technologists, and managers. But the editorial side generally drives the daily\noperations, whereas technologists and managers play a more prominent role in strategic\nthinking.\nIn operational terms, the case organization, led by the newsroom, has an eager and\nexperimental approach to the opportunities offered by various digital intermediaries. The\ncentral motivation is the desire to reach a wider audience. One senior online editor says,\nWe generally have a \"let's try and see\" approach. ... there are absolutely people in the newsroom\nand in the teams who just want to get on and make use of these, in some cases, great new tools,\nnew platforms to get more of their journalism out. And they're not really too fussy about how\nor where and the more the merrier really. And credit to them for spotting those opportunities\nand thinking creatively about how to get their material out.\nSimilarly, a senior strategy person from management underlines the importance of\nexperimenting with the opportunities offered by digital intermediaries: \"We start from\nthe premise that we need to be on the platforms where our audiences are and that we need\nto be available in the ways that our audiences want our news to be available.\" This very\nactive and more aggressive pursuit of the opportunities offered by tools and services\ndeveloped by digital intermediaries is very different from the defensive, reactionary, and\npragmatic approach to digital media that characterized many news media organizations\nin the past (Boczkowski, 2004). It has not always been the primary approach. One senior\neditor says,\nA few years ago, we were much more reticent and cautious. So it took a long time, and it was\nsort of, \"Do we do this? Do we not do this? What's the right strategic approach?\" ... It could be\nquite late in the day before we really got the hang of it.\nSeveral editorial and strategy people interviewed underline that the move toward a\n\"let's try and see\" approach has involved a long period of cultural and organizational\nchange. Editorial discussions around how the organization should respond to various\ninitiatives from different digital intermediaries are no longer focused primarily on\nwhether one should engage, but on how one should engage, and on the allocation of\nultimately scarce editorial resources across many channels (Facebook, Instagram,\nTwitter, YouTube, Snapchat, etc.) and new forms of news work (search engine optimiza-\ntion, social media optimization, editorial analytics, etc.).\nAt a strategic level, people are less eager, and more worried. Strategic considerations\ninclude internal deliberations in terms of the relative emphasis that should be put on vari-\nous communication channels (legacy/digital, onsite/offsite) but most importantly the\nlonger-term implications of investing in channels--and socializing users into accessing\ncontent via these channels--that are controlled by digital intermediaries with their own\ninterests and objectives. The strategic discussions in the case organization involve senior\neditorial people, product people, and people from management. They play out between\nthe desire to reach people where they are (and the recognition that this increasingly\ninvolves working with intermediaries, both search engines and social media) and worries\nover long-term dependence and loss of control. These worries are expressed by people\nfrom different groups in the organization. The same senior online editor who spoke of the\nnewsroom's \"let's try and see\" approach (quoted above) added, \"I think at a more strate-\ngic level, yes, there is a lot more deliberation about how much effort should we expend\non that kind of activity.\" Technologists and managers too spell out these worries in inter-\nviews. One senior product manager says,\nI think [the rise of digital intermediaries is] a massive risk for us. We have to fish where the\nusers are [and] take full advantage of using the platforms, these platform capabilities that are\nbeing offered to us, for free, at the moment, to reach audiences that we currently under-serve.\nOur goal, however, should not be just reach but converting those users into having an engaged\nrelationship with us as a publisher.\nA senior strategy person from management expresses the same sentiment:\nYou are being asked to sign up to a platform potentially not only as a short term additional route\nto market, but in the long term as a competitor to what you're doing yourself. And equally,\nagain it's an obvious point to make, but you are signing up with a competitor who has control\nover their own road map.\nThere is thus a clear tension between the operational side, where, as one senior social\nmedia editor says, \"there is always a reason to engage\" and the strategic side, where, as a\nsenior strategy person points out, engagement \"creates this sort of existential question for\nany large organization, that isn't just about getting involved with trials. It's fundamentally\nabout your long-term routes to market strategy over the next five to 10years.\" This differ-\nence is in part about the case organization dealing with a development that is not about\ndeveloping discrete technological tools (what kind of website do we build?), but about\nreacting to the rise of technological platforms (how do we handle the challenges and\nopportunities that come with trying to reach people where they already are, on terms set\nby others?). It represents an organization-to-organization, publisher-to-platform parallel\nto what Gillespie (2014) has called \"entanglement with practice\" (p. 168), the way actors\nreshape their practices to suit the algorithms they depend on (even as they in our case also\nworry over that very dependence).\nThe fear of missing out\nDespite the tension and the longer-term strategic worries, our case organization has gen-\nerally engaged with digital intermediaries and their news-related initiatives at every\ngiven opportunity. Consider this exchange, which is significant especially because it\ncomes from an interview with one of the senior strategy people who expressed the most\nreservations about the long-term implications of engaging with digital intermediaries:\nInterviewer: Have any of the major platforms come to you with suggestions or proposals of\nwhere you have said no? Thanks, but no thanks.\nInterviewee: That's a good question. Um. [Pause.] I don't think so. [Pause.] Not major ones.\nAt a very basic level, editorial, product, and strategy people in the case organization\nstart from the basic premises that (1) digital intermediaries, especially Google and\nFacebook, have grown popular with very large numbers of people because they offer\nattractive products and are increasingly integral to our daily digital habits; (2) that news\nis among the things people search for and that they come across on social media, as\nshown by the significant amounts of traffic driven by Google and Facebook; and that (3)\neven a large, resourceful, and prominent news organization will be working against some\ncentral evolving trends in how people use digital media and how the digital media envi-\nronment is structured by powerful, centrally placed technology companies if it does not\nrecognize this and act accordingly. As one senior product person says, \"Facebook is the\nbig beast in the social media jungle and we recognize that a large proportion of our audi-\nence will want to read news on Facebook. ... There are opportunities for us within that\nspace.\" Similarly, a senior social media editor says that leveraging search engines is the\nbiggest driver of traffic from outside the case organization's core, loyal audience and\nhence a major priority.\nThe central opportunity digital intermediaries offer is reach, especially to younger\naudiences and casual users that many news organizations struggle to connect with. All\nthe major digital intermediaries feed this perception. Fear of missing out is an important\npart of not only the business-to-consumer side of digital media but also of the business-\nto-business side. Importantly, this fear is not only fanned through the kinds of self-pro-\nmotion oriented toward individual users, analyzed by, for example, Gillespie (2010) or\nVan Dijck (2013), but also by platforms aggressively promoting their products and ser-\nvices specifically toward other organized actors, including news media. When new ini-\ntiatives are launched around news, they are promoted both publicly and in private\nconversations with those publishers that the digital intermediaries want to get on board\nfrom the outset, often playing very explicitly on the idea that news media have in the past\nmissed out on opportunities like this. (The past failures such as Google Living Stories or\nFacebook's Social Reader are rarely brought up on these occasions.) Take this exchange\nfrom one of our interviews with a senior strategy person in the case organization:\nInterviewer: One sense I have from our interviews is that the way the platforms approach major\npublishers is that they come and say we have this thing, it's gonna be amazing, we can't tell you\nexactly how or why. You want to be part of it and it would be very bad for you to not be part of\nit. Is this broadly ...\nInterviewee: Yeah it is exactly that. But if I was there that's what I'd do too. It's exactly that\npush.\nWhile there is no clear evidence that this is the case, several interviewees also express\nthe view that not embracing new initiatives championed by the dominant digital interme-\ndiaries may undermine the benefit derived from existing services, for example, the fear\nthat not using Google AMP will reduce search traffic, that not using Facebook Instant\nArticles will reduce reach and referrals from Facebook, and so on. Whether or not this\nfear is justified, the fact that people act on it means it has real consequences.\nThe fear of missing out on the opportunities presented by digital intermediaries is\naccentuated by the fact that some other news media organizations--both digitally born\nones such as BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post and legacy ones such as CNN and the\nMail Online--are seen as having delivered proof of the concept that search and social\nmedia can help reach very large audiences. The same product manager quoted above\ncontinues, \"People have demonstrated successfully, new entrants have demonstrated it is\na way to build very rapidly, very large scalable engaged audiences with your brand.\" The\nunderlying logic is clear. If they can do it, so can we. And the case organization fears\nmissing out on the opportunities offered (and actively promoted) by digital intermediar-\nies, especially given the risk that other competitors seize them successfully.\nDifficulties in evaluating the relationship\nEvaluating whether engagement with the various opportunities offered by digital inter-\nmediaries is working out is, however, difficult, in part because of limited data on perfor-\nmance, lack of benchmarks, and problems of comparing various metrics across channels.\nAt a basic level, there is no question both search and social help our case organization\nincrease its online reach. But how much, to whom, and with what further potential is very\nhard to ascertain due to the dearth of detailed data. The opacity of many of the opportuni-\nties offered by digital intermediaries is in stark contrast to the general impression in\njournalism studies that digital media provides detailed and accurate audience data\n(Anderson, 2012). It shows how the very same digital technologies, which some early\ncommentators associated with transparency, also produce a series of opaque black boxes\ncontrolled by individual, self-interested actors (Pasquale, 2015). Specifically, it demon-\nstrates how the divide between those who have and those who do not have access to\ndetailed data goes not only between individual users and large technology companies but\nalso between, for example, platforms and publishers. People from all parts of the case\norganization express great frustration with the data provided by most digital intermediar-\nies, especially because the assumption is that the intermediaries themselves have far\nbetter data. A senior social media editor says,\nYou might see a very large number and you might think this is extraordinary, but when you\nactually look at it and break it down, what you're actually seeing is what the social media\ncompany might want you to see rather than what is actually a value to you as a publisher.\nA senior strategy person expresses the same concern: \"As an absolute minimal posi-\ntion we expect to be getting sufficient amounts of data back to be able to inform our\nbusiness decisions. I think it's fair to say we're not getting that today.\"\nThis means that the \"see\" part of the \"let's try and see\" operational approach adopted\nby the newsroom can be difficult in practice. A senior social media editor lays out the\nproblem:\nMeasuring is one thing, but how much do you trust in the measure that you have taken? Well\nthat's a good question. I think there is a lot of smoke and mirrors. ... I think all news or all social\nmedia organizations and other media, digital media organization will reveal what they want to\nreveal and there will be some analytics that are publically available and some that are not.\nA senior audience engagement editor echoes the point saying it is \"virtually impossi-\nble\" to get a consistent overview across channels due to incompatible metrics, lack of\nindividual-level data, and the absence of third-party validation of numbers. A senior\nproduct person reinforces the point and elaborates on the issues involved:\nWe don't have at present, an aggregated view of engagement across those platforms in terms of\nwhat content works on which platforms. ... [The issue] is we have measurement at content\nlevel but we don't have any user data. For example, Facebook will give us aggregate\ndemographic data, but we get no data at an individual level. So one of the things we're trying\nto create is a single customer view that allows us to see what every individual user, what they\nconsume across out various channels. We're interested to develop personal relationships with\nusers where we have personalized recommendations, where a user is able to follow topics,\nexpress favorites, receive personalized notifications. But we can't.\nThe limited data, lack of benchmarks, and problems of comparing various metrics\nacross channels make it very hard to evaluate whether relationships that in the short run\nmay help deliver reach but in the long run are seen by senior editors, product people, and\nmanagers as risky are actually working out. As long as there are opportunities, and the\neditorial side favors a \"let's try and see\" approach, spurred on in part by the fear of miss-\ning out, news media organizations can engage. But evaluating the results is difficult. We\nare, as individual, ordinary users, increasingly transparent to and monitored by large\ntechnology companies that we rely on (Van Dijck, 2013). Importantly, these platforms\nare in turn opaque not only to us as individual users (Pasquale, 2015) but also to other\npowerful institutions, like publishers, that increasingly depend upon them. It is, says one\nsenior strategy person, \"incredibly hard to evaluate. ... [We are] punching in the dark\nfrom a strategy point of view.\"\nAsymmetrical relationships\nFundamentally, the relationship between our case organization--a large, digitally devel-\noped, European news media organization with a relatively solid revenue base--and digi-\ntal intermediaries such as Google and Facebook is seen as very asymmetrical. This is a\ncentral difference between dealing with technological tools (the development of a new\nwebsite or app) and technological platforms (dealing with digital intermediaries) that\nplatform studies help us capture. How precisely news media respond is then an empirical\nquestion and dependent on the kinds of specific combinations of artifacts, practices, and\narrangements digital journalism studies have focused on (e.g. Boczkowski, 2004). As\nnoted from the outset, our case organization is very engaged with all the digital interme-\ndiaries and most interviewees generally describe the relationships as relatively good,\ncontacts as frequent, and discussions are open. Google and Facebook are both very\nimportant, and the case organization has close relations with both. But relations with dif-\nferent digital intermediaries are different. One senior product person who has worked\nwith both Google and Facebook describes the relation with Facebook as follows:\nThe engagement has been pretty arms-length. It's been through business development people\nrather than technical architects and product managers talking to one another. ... They've been\nvery inflexible. It's been difficult to get direct access to the people actually building their\nproducts directly. And they have tended to engage with publishers on a bilateral basis rather\nthan a multilateral basis. So they engage in direct one-to-one discussions with publishers rather\nthan bringing groups of publishers together at the same time. And there doesn't seem to be\nmuch flexibility in the approach, right? But having said that, the product clearly seems to work\nfor people and I think it will become a very major force in driving online journalism in the next\nfew years.\nThe same interviewee describes the relationship with Google in very different terms:\nIt has been truly collaborative in terms of the way in which Google have worked with the\nindustry. They opened up the discussions early around the aims of the [AMP] project, and they\ngot publishers involved defining how it would work before they had actually built the\nmechanism and before they had defined the solution.And so I don't think it was just lip-service,\nI think that they genuinely invested significant amounts of resource and effort and time to bring\npublishers together to talk about the problem space they were trying to address. ... And they\nthen said, \"If we want to achieve that, how does this process need to work for you as publishers?\"\nAnd, as a result, I think what's come out is pretty sophisticated process.\nThe senior product person talks about a \"fairly stark contrast\" between working\nwith Facebook and working with Google but also underlines that these things change\nover time as digital intermediaries evolve and rethink their relationship with outside\npartners:\nIf you look at how Google behaved with Google Newsstand when it first came out [in 2013],\nthey were operating in the same way as Apple and Facebook are now. It was not open. They\nwere very much concerned around revenue shares and around service-level agreements and\naround complying to certain standards. I think it's a very fascinating fundamental shift.\nThe case organization's relationship with Google is particularly revealing because it\nis seen as more collaborative and open than the relationship with Facebook but is still\nseen as very asymmetrical. A senior strategy person explains, \"What we have found is\nthat the bigger the organization that you're dealing with the harder obviously it is to\ninfluence those terms.\" After going through a range of the past and current examples of\nengagements with a range of different digital intermediaries, the interview continued:\nInterviewer: What kind of hand do you feel you have to play with these people?\nInterviewee: Honestly very limited is the absolute truth of it. ... It feels to me they have\nsufficient money, scale, scope and a global reach that if they're gonna do this, they're gonna do\nthis, and then the question becomes more of at what point and on what terms do we engage. So\nit's wonderful to have a window where we feel we can influence things a bit more but I wouldn't\nwant to overstate what sort of hand we have. And more broadly, and this speaks to some of the\nexistential threats and concerns that people have about the success of their own destinations,\ntheir own websites, their own apps.\nAt a basic level, the relationship between the case organization and the biggest digital\nintermediaries does contain an element of what a senior social media editor calls \"sym-\nbiosis\"--ultimately both search engines and social media benefit from the fact that pub-\nlishers produce news--but the relationship is very asymmetrical, with even large,\ndigitally developed news media organizations feeling they have very little leverage with\ndigital intermediaries, even those they have a good relationship with. Digital intermedi-\naries may need news in a broad sense, or at least benefit from it. But it is not at all clear\nthat they need any one individual news media organization, even large ones. Thus, our\nanalysis goes beyond the usual focus in platform studies, the relation between ordinary\nusers and large technology companies (e.g. Van Dijck, 2013; Gillespie, 2014), to identify\ncomparable relations between companies such as Google and Facebook and large, digi-\ntally, strong, and historically powerful news media like our case organization.\nThe asymmetry is not simply about leverage in negotiations but also about who acts\nand who reacts. Major recent news-related initiatives such as Facebook's Instant Articles\nor Google's AMP Project have involved collaboration with select, invited partners before\nbeing opened up to other news media. But it is important to keep in mind that even in the\nmost open and collaborative cases, it is still the case that digital intermediaries act, leav-\ning news media organizations to react.\nConclusion\nThe rise of digital intermediaries such as search engines and social media is in the pro-\ncess of changing our media environment. This development offers new challenges and\nopportunities for media users and media organizations alike. In this article, we have\nfocused on how news media organizations handle their relationships with increasingly\nimportant players such as Google and Facebook, analyzing a strategic case study--a\nlarge, digitally strong, European legacy news media organization with a relatively solid\nrevenue base and a collaborative approach to the dominant intermediaries. On the basis\nof interviews with editors, product developers, and senior strategy and management peo-\nple, we have shown how the relationship is characterized by a tension between short-\nterm operational considerations and longer-term strategic worries, and argued that it is\nshaped by the combination of a fear of missing out, the difficulties of evaluating risks\nand rewards, and a deep sense of asymmetry. Driven by a \"let's try and see\" approach,\nchampioned especially by parts of the editorial staff, the case organization has engaged\nvery actively with a range of new opportunities offered by digital intermediaries, increas-\ning its current digital reach even as many in the organization worry about the longer-term\nstrategic risk of becoming dependent on digital intermediaries. Here, the defensive, reac-\ntionary, and pragmatic approach to digital technologies that characterized many news\nmedia organizations in the past (Boczkowski, 2004) has been superseded by an approach\nthat is still reactive and pragmatic, but far more aggressive in terms of seizing opportuni-\nties as they present themselves. This is very different from our established understanding\nof how legacy media engage with digital media.\nOur analysis shows how digital intermediaries offer news media organizations impor-\ntant new opportunities for reaching wider audiences. But it remains unclear how the\nself-interest of digital intermediaries and news media organizations are aligned longer-\nterm. Interviewees in our strategically selected case organization see their collaboration\nwith platforms such as Google and Facebook as accompanied by significant strategic\nrisk of losing control over editorial identity (as the ways in which people come across\ncontent is increasingly shaped by search and social media algorithms and interests),\naccess to data (as far more detailed individual-level data is available on direct traffic and\non-site audiences than referrals and off-site audiences), and revenue (as digital interme-\ndiaries account for larger and larger parts of the online advertising market). Interviewees\nfrequently mention examples of how the intermediaries are in control and can and will\nchange their product and strategy in line with what serves their own interests--as when\nGoogle's \"Panda\" updates from 2011 drastically reduced traffic to sites operated by\nDemand Media (while benefiting other publishers) and when changes to the algorithms\nbehind Facebook's NewsFeed allegedly cut Upworthy's audience reach in half in just\nThese examples illustrate how decisions made by dominant digital intermediaries can\nrestructure the environment in which other media organizations operate, and our analysis\nshows how even a large and resourceful news media organization struggles to adapt to its\ngrowing dependence on players such as Google and Facebook. To capture this, we have\ngone beyond digital journalism studies and its focus on the appropriation and develop-\nment of specific, discrete technological tools and drawn on theoretical inspiration from\nplatform studies and its interest in how various actors engage with the development of\nmore widely shared and used technological platforms, owned and operated by individual\ncompanies such as Google and Facebook. Developing a discrete website or app is one\nthing. Dealing with the products and services developed and disseminated by large tech-\nnology companies already used by billions of people is something else. Our case shows\nhow even large, digitally strong news media who aggressively try to engage with these\ncompanies frequently find themselves reacting to moves made by far larger actors and\ndrawn in by the fear of missing out on the reach that they offer.\nGiven the privileged position occupied by our strategically chosen case organization,\nthe issue is even more acute for most other news media organizations, which do not have\nthe same size, digital reach, political clout, or resources. The continuation of this develop-\nment, with a small number of dominant digital intermediaries increasingly restructuring\nthe media environment in part through their product development, in part through their\npopularity with audiences and advertisers, in part through the entrenched advantages that\ncome with the accumulation of data, money, and technology talent, and in part through\nother actors growing increasingly reliant upon them, represents a fundamental change in\nthe position occupied by news media organizations. This is an important extension of the\nempirical research done in platform studies, and contribution to how we understand the\n\"network power\" of entities that define standards others in turn rely on and connect large\nnumbers of different users (Grewal, 2008). It is important, as previous research has shown\npanies such as Google and Facebook define standards that (billions of) individual ordi-\nnary users in turn more or less have to simply accept. It is also important to go beyond\nthat, as we have done here, and show that they have similar forms of network power over\notherwise independent and powerful institutions such as the news media.\nIn the course of the 20th century, news media increased their institutional independ-\nence in part because of their control over the most important means of mass communica-\ntion (Thompson, 1995). Today, they have far less control over the distribution of news\nthan they had in the past. They may reach wider audiences than they can through their\nown websites and apps, but they do it by publishing to platforms defined by coding tech-\nnologies, business models, and cultural conventions over which they have little influence\nand are increasingly dependent (Bell, 2014; Bell et al., 2016). They used to control both\ncontent and channels. Increasingly, they control only their own content and rely more\nand more on others' channels.\nThis development is important for understanding how journalism and news media\nevolve in our changing media environment, but also beyond. It shows how not only ordi-\nnary users but also previously powerful and relatively independent institutions such as\nthe news media are becoming simultaneously increasingly empowered by and dependent\nupon a small number of centrally placed and powerful digital intermediaries beyond their\ncontrol. This is an extension of a broader set of trends variously characterized as the rise\nof \"platformed sociality\" (Van Dijck, 2013), a \"black box society\" (Pasquale, 2015), and\nthe \"infrastructuralization\" of the most important platforms (even as they remain private,\nfor-profit companies; Just and Latzer, 2017; Plantin et al., 2017). It is a development that\nraises fundamental questions that go beyond how individual citizens and important insti-\ntutions such as news media, political campaigns, and social movements use digital tech-\nnologies. It concerns how they handle their increasing dependence on these technologies\nand the few, large, and powerful technology companies that by empowering large num-\nbers of other actors also develop and shape key parts of our media environment. We\ntherefore hope further research will analyze how other news organizations--as well as\nother organizations deeply dependent on their ability to communicate publicly, such as,\nfor example, political campaigns and social movements--handle their relationships with\ndigital intermediaries, how these relationships operate in different national and institu-\ntional contexts, and examine how the different intermediaries themselves handle these\nrelations with those who are increasingly dependent upon them, and think about the\nresponsibilities that come with the power they have.\n"
