During all\nstages, an individual needs to reach his or her full athletic\npotential to maximize the benefits of participating in sports\nwhile dealing with other aspects of his or her life. This is espe-\ncially significant as an athlete enters adolescence, when they\nneed to be educated in school and participate in sports at the\nsame time. Therefore, the concept of dual career concerns the\nintegration of an athletic career with education or work to\nattain a balance during multiyear sports activities. The notion\nof dual career provides a suitable solution for elite athletes to\nbalance their sport with education or work, and prepare for\ntheir future after sport. This can reduce the risk of unintended\nathletic termination or dropout (Conzelmann & Nagel, 2003;\nBalancing an athletic career and education or work can be a\nchallenging task for elite athletes due to the increasing high\npressure and continuous demands for elite performances.\nRegarding the different phases of elite athletes' career\ndevelopment and transition, researchers have proposed differ-\nent conceptual \"transition models,\" such as Sussman's (1972)\nanalytical model, which stressed the role of personal, social,\nand environmental factors; Schlossberg's (1981) model of\nhuman adaptation to transition, which emphasized the ath-\nlete's perception, attributes, and environmental characteristics;\n1The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong\n2National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan\n3National Taiwan Normal University, Taipei, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nRaymond Kim Wai Sum, Department of Sports Science and Physical\nEducation, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, G07, Kwok Sports\nBuilding, Shatin, Hong Kong.\nEmail: kwsum@cuhk.edu.hk\nSocial-Ecological Determinants of\nElite Student Athletes' Dual Career\nDevelopment in Hong Kong and Taiwan\nRaymond Kim Wai Sum1, Hsiu-Hua Tsai2, Amy Sau Ching Ha1,\nChih-fu Cheng3, Fong-jia Wang1, and Minghui Li1\n Keywords\nsocial-ecological determinants, career development, elite student athletes, Hong Kong, Taiwan\n2 SAGE Open\nmodels described the stages and emotional implications\nof retirement (Wylleman, Alfermann, & Lavallee, 2004).\nStambulova (1994) developed the athlete career transition\nmodel through her investigation of Russian athletes. She sug-\ngested that the transition was a process of coping with demands\nand challenges that resulted in either a successful or crisis tran-\nsition. Stambulova's transition model emphasized the impor-\ntance of adaptation in a successful transition process.\nWylleman et al. (2004) pointed out that the interventions sug-\ngested were developed in parallel with the transition concept,\nsuch as strategies using projective techniques (Bardaxoglou,\ninformation processing approach (Lavallee, Nesti, Borkoles,\nCockerill, & Edge, 2000). Based on these approaches, there\nhave been athlete life-skills programs or career development\nprograms managed by different sports governing bodies,\nOlympic Committees, sports federations, and nongovernmen-\ntal organizations, which have drawn on the transition approach,\nto help athletes develop postsporting careers. In addition,\nCabrita, Rosado, Leite, Serpa, and Sousa (2014) reported that\nelite athletes with higher athletic identity have a higher level of\ncareer decision-making self-efficacy and higher levels of opti-\nmism for the future, and are particularly more likely to choose\na sports-related profession.\nAlthough there have been extensive researches published\nabout sports career development and transition (Lavallee\n2004), these studies have been mainly carried out in the\nUnited States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Since the\n1990s, researchers have been exploring the perceived social\nand psychological conditions of adjustment during turning\nphases in the career development of elite athletes (Swain &\nBallard, 1991). These studies concluded that preparation,\nestablishment of coping strategies, and goal-setting are\nneeded to succeed at different transition stages. In addition,\nStambulova, Alfermann, Statler, and C\u00f4t\u00e9 (2009) and\nStambulova and Ryba (2013) also encouraged the develop-\nment of cultural specific frameworks through research in\nAsian countries, such as China, to internationalize these\nstudies and help athletes adapt within their own society and\nculture. Particularly, it is important that in the study of the\ncareer development of ESAs in Hong Kong and Taiwan,\nChinese culture, social, political, and historical factors\nshould be taken into account.\nCareer Development of ESAs in the Greater\nChina Region\nThe Greater China Region comprises four cross-straits\nplaces. These are Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and\nMacau. Studies related to elite athletes' career development\nconducted in Mainland China and Taiwan are mainly in the\nChinese language. No research study has been found in\nMacau. As to the Hong Kong context, a recent study con-\nducted by Zhang, Chung, Si, and Gucciardi (2016) reported\nthat experiential avoidance mediated an inverse association\nbetween mindfulness and ESAs' burnout in their career\ndevelopment. Another study (Sum & Ma, 2014) examined\nthe support given to ESAs in Hong Kong secondary schools.\nThe results suggested that further study is required to under-\nstand the current situation of ESAs and to explore how key\ndeterminants affect the ways in which ESAs manage their\ndual (academic and athletic) careers. Chow (2001) used the\nlife history approach to examine the ways in which female\nESAs feel and think about the career transition from compe-\ntition to retirement. The study revealed that female ESAs\nexperienced their career development in sport together with\npursuing an education, which affected their transition to\nretirement and lifestyle after their sports career.\nThere are limited studies relating to career development\nin the Greater China Region. Moreover, because of funding\npaid by taxpayers allocated to elite athletic development, this\nshould be used to maximum effect so that elite athletes per-\nform to their best ability and bring good repute to their coun-\ntries.Asaresult,thereisaneedtounderstandthedeterminants\nof ESAs'dual career development, particularly at the univer-\nsity level, as they approach the mastery stage (Wylleman &\nReints, 2010). In particular, the multiple, interrelated social\nand contextual determinants that affect ESAs' career devel-\nopment should be considered.\nA Social-Ecological Perspective\nLi and Sum (in press) employed a qualitative metasynthesis\nmethod to review the literature on dual career experiences\nelite athletes underwent some individual issues (involving\npsychological, physical, and emotional impact on the ath-\nletes), interpersonal issues (concerning elite athletes' inter-\nactions or relationships within their families, schools, or\ntraining), and external issues (involving practical support,\nconditions, and environment) in their career development\n(Li & Sum, in press). In the context of ecological systems\nthesis review study disclosed some substantial determi-\nnants of elite athletes' dual career development, which are\nexplicitly social-ecological in nature.\nLikewise, Golden and Earp (2012) drew upon the social-\necological model on five levels, namely: (a) intrapersonal\n(individual), (b) interpersonal, (c) institutional, (d) commu-\nnity, and (e) public policy in their health education study.\nWhen applied to ESAs' career development, such a social-\necological model locates the individual ESAat the center and\nclassifies the overlapping and interrelating systems that\ninfluence the individual ESAs. This model is helpful for\nexploring individual ESAs'career development by recogniz-\ning that the ESAs are situated in a complex social context.\nSum et al. 3\nWe, thus, conceive that ESAs' career development is\nsocially situated and affected by multiple social and individ-\nual factors. ESAs' career development is not merely due to\nthe individual input alone, but also due to aspects of their\nsocial contexts, such as schools, families, training places,\npolicy, and environment.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this study was, therefore, to provide an initial\ninvestigation of the social-ecological determinants that help\nto explain how ESAs experience dual career development,\nusing ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1977,\nMethod of the Research\nThe main research question of this study was, \"How do\nsocial-ecological determinants affect ESAs' lives and career\ndevelopment?\" The following specific research questions\nwere addressed:\nResearch Question 1: What are the career aims of ESAs?\nResearch Question 2: How do ESAs describe their ath-\nletic and academic experiences?\nResearch Question 3: How do ESAs describe and con-\nceptualize their career development?\nResearch Question 4: What are the individual, interper-\nsonal, and external determinants, and how do these deter-\nminants affect ESAs' career development?\nWith more than 15 years of qualitative research experi-\nence, the research team employed individual and focus group\ninterviews to collect relevant data. The grounded theory\ntechniques and procedures outlined by Strauss and Corbin\n(1998) were used to explore the exuberance and multiplicity\nof experiences of ESAs conveyed in their own words. Details\nof the research plan and data collection procedures are shown\nin what follows.\nParticipants\nUsing the snowball or chain sampling method (Patton,\n2002), the researchers identified suitable participants for the\nstudy. ESAs were requested to help identify other individu-\nals from whom the researchers could extract or generate\ndata. Selection of the next interviewee was based on what\nwas found during the previous round of data collection and\nanalysis.\nESAs selected for this study were from a variety of\nbackgrounds. Eight ESAs (four males, four females; four\nfrom Hong Kong, four from Taiwan) between the ages of\n19 and 25 years were purposively recruited from a variety\nof backgrounds to enrich the contextual analysis. Their\nyears of experience as ESAs were between 5 and 12 years\n(see Table 1).\nData Collection\nTo build up mutual trust and rapport between participants\nand researchers, the researchers contacted the participants\ndirectly to explain the aims of the study. The informants were\ncontacted by telephone and followed up by e-mail, whereby\nthe researchers sent a written consent form to participants to\nexplain how data were to be collected, processed, and used.\nInterviews were conducted in participants' universities at\ntheir available time slots.\nThe researchers used one-on-one semistructured inter-\nviews (Wragg, 2002) followed by focus group interviews\n(Krueger & Casey, 2000). Interview questions were devel-\noped from previous literature on the dual career development\nof elite athletes. One ESA was invited for interview as a pilot\nstudy to check whether the interview questions were appro-\npriate to answer the specific research questions.\nTable 1.

The aim of the focus group inter-\nviews was to summarize the one-on-one interview data to\nparticipants so that they could reflect on them and make com-\nparisons between themselves and their counterparts. The\nresearchers conducted two focus group interviews in each\nregion wherein each group comprised four ESAs.\nBoth the one-on-one and focus group interviews were\naudiotaped and transcribed by the researchers. Interview\nmaterial was transcribed verbatim as soon as it was collected.\nWith regard to the quality, consistency, and accuracy of data\ncollection and analysis, the researchers were responsible for\ndata collection, transcription, and interpretation. Examples\nof raw data and themes are shown in Table 2.\nData Analysis\nFollowing grounded theory techniques and procedures out-\nlined by Strauss and Corbin (1998), the transcribed inter-\nviews were analyzed by using coding procedures. Transcripts\nwere fractured sentence by sentence in the opening coding\nstage. During the coding process, we frequently discussed\nthe code list and added codes that emerged through the\nprocess. The codes were then sorted to generate categories\nand subcategories. Analysis focused on the relationships\nbetween categories and their subcategories. Constant com-\nparison analysis and categorization aimed to categorize\ncodes into higher-order themes.\nProtection of Human Rights and Establishing\nTrustworthiness\nWritten consent forms were signed by the respondents before\nthe interviews. ESAs' participation was strictly voluntary.\nConfidentiality of information was affirmed. ESA partici-\npants were identified only by a pseudonym in all records.\nCredibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability\n(Lincoln & Guba, 1985) were implemented through provid-\ning a summary of the participant's responses immediately\nafter each interview to enable member check. Systematic\nrecord-keeping and continuing evaluation of theories and\nfindings was an essential part of the process. Approval for\nuse on human subjects was obtained from the University\nSurvey and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee.\nResults and Discussion\nThis study on the social-ecological determinants of ESAs'\ndual career development revealed that the participants were\nTable 2.

Throughout their\ndual career development, ESAs experienced time-consuming\nathletic and academic lives and had to strike a balance between\nsports and studies. Frustration from both academic and athletic\naspects was dealt with regardless of its source, and ESAs'dual\ncareer development was prevailed over by several individual,\nmicro-level, meso-level, exo-level, and macro-level determi-\nnants per se (see Figure 1). All the different levels of determi-\nnants are interrelated and together affect the ESAs'dual career\ndevelopment (Table 2).\nIndividual Determinants\nIndividual determinants were comprised of ESAs' career\naims, identities, roles, characters, self-efficacy, and motiva-\ntion. The career aims of ESAs varied from having a clear\nathletic goal to having a loss of direction in their future career\ndevelopment. Young (R3) had clear short- and long-term\ncareer plans:\nIn the next few years, I want to compete in the Enterprise\nVolleyball League in Taiwan. As for long term, I want to acquire\na teaching qualification or to become a professional coach. (R3)\nIn comparison, Henri (R2) had shifted his focus to his\nstudies:\nWhen I became a university student, I began to realise the\nprospects of a korfball player were relatively limited. As such, I\nthought of pursuing other alternatives, like studying. I want\nmore time to do other things in university. (R2)\nSalena (R4) demonstrated somewhat different career plan-\nning experiences in her dual career development:\nI want to focus more on my studies. However, if I cannot excel\nin my academic results and get a good job, I don't know what I\ncan do in the future. I know I can't earn a living playing tug-of-\nwar, but I am presently training full-time and have no time to\ncarefully plan my future. (R4)\nIn connection with ESAs' career aims, their identities and\nroles shift according to their experience at different stages of\ntheir dual career development. Athletic identity was dis-\ncussed by Brewer, Van Raalte, and Linder (1993). They\nstated that this related to the degree to which an individual\nidentifies with their athletic role. In this regard, Bel (R6)\nexpressed that her personal identity shifted more toward her\nstudent identity when she was in her first year of university:\nBack then, I would try my best to maintain my role as a student.\nDespite the fact that I needed to spend a great deal of time on\nswimming, I still saw myself as a student. In fact, I still see\nmyself as a student, as I tend to put even more effort in my\nstudies. (R6)\nBel (R6) added that her roles had clashed when she was in\nsecondary school:\nThe class might not be able to accommodate you, and some\nmight even label you as \"those who are falling behind.\" In fact,\nmy secondary school would sort students into different classes\naccording to their abilities. Some classes were packed with top\nathletes, for example. So the sense of being labeled was quite\nstrong. I did not face much difficulty with swimming in and of\nitself, but I did feel the clash between my two roles as student\nand as athlete. This included a clash in the social aspect. (R6)\nEchoing Bel (R6), Yvonne (R1) shared that her athletic and\nacademic roles conflicted:\nI led a routine and repetitive life when I was training in the\nnational team. I did not like their way of training. I preferred my\nFigure 1. Different levels of social-ecological determinants.\n6 SAGE Open\nschool life because I had more freedom. However, I needed to\nobey the routines of the national team. Otherwise, I would be\nkicked out from the national team. (R1)\nIn terms of character, self-efficacy, and motivation,\nYvonne (R1) claimed that with her sports skills, she was able\nto demonstrate proper form during physical education (PE)\nlessons in front of her classmates:\nYes . . . I do a better job at PE lessons than others and I am able\nto learn new sports faster than others. This makes me confident\nof myself. (R1)\nAs one of the Hong Kong team members who broke the 4 \u00d7\n100 m relay Asian record, Hardy (R7) affirmed his capabilities\nin his track training compared positively over his counterparts:\nI think I am much stronger and have greatly improved my\nperformance in exercises like dumbbell lifting in the gym. When\nI checked out some videos online, however, I found that some\npeople in the West can effortlessly achieve what I strove very\nhard to do. I do think they enjoy some natural advantages over\nus.As a runner, however, I firmly believe that I can make a name\nfor myself, at least in Asia, if I go for it. (R7)\nThe ESAs had a strong personal motivation to strive for\nperfection. This could be a prominent determinant in their\ndual career development (Aghdasi, 2014). The ESAs' char-\nacter also included commitment, dedication, being hard-\nworking and driven, versatility, and ability (Miller, Homan,\n& Miniutti, 2006). Moreover, to motivate ESAs to persevere\nin their dual career, ESAs' problem-solving abilities and\nachievement can motivate them to continue in their challeng-\ning dual career lives. Snow (R5) contended,\nFrom being a nobody to getting into a national team and competing\nin five competitions a year, this then all went back to zero when I\nhad to concentrate on my studies. I am the kind of athlete who\nneeds to train a lot to gain progress. So I did think of quitting\nswimming after secondary school. I had repeated my F5 year and\nattempted the public examination twice. I had left the national\nteam and then rejoined it. However, I still find it rewarding. The\nmedals that I have earned are not just pieces of silverware, but\nthey also give me a sense of accomplishment. (R5)\nDespite the fact that diligent elite athletes were more\nlikely to plan for their future career because they set higher\ngoals and are more confident (Demulier, Le Scanff, &\nstated that elite athletes prioritized different activities while\nstriving to maintain a balance between themselves and the\ndifferent social worlds in which they interact.\nMicro-Level Determinants\nMicro-level determinants include a multitude of professionals\nand stakeholders (Bronfenbrenner, 1994), such as ESAs'\ncoaches, teammates, parents, siblings, PE teachers, other teach-\ners, alumni, seniors, and classmates that ESAs interact with.\nOver the course of ESAs' dual career, coaches were not\nonly the \"significant others\" who reinforced athletes' psy-\nchological and physical investment in the sports role (Stephan\n& Brewer, 2007), but they also influenced them at every\nstage of their career decision.\nYoung (R3) vividly remembered that\n. . . my coach in junior high school taught me everything from\nthe very beginning and helped me to lay the foundation for my\nfuture career. He not only taught me volleyball but also lessons\nabout life. (R3)\nIn contrast, Bel (R6) had a different experience with her\ncoaches:\nAs to time allocation for studies and sports, they [coaches]\nwould not comment much. Back in secondary school, my then\ncoach would not even care about my attendance at training.\nHowever, I did have a coach who was dictatorial and would tell\nme to swim more. (R6)\nWhen Snow (R5) identified influential figures in her\ncareer development, she expressed that her coach was quite\ndemocratic:\nMy foreign coach was my influential figure. He was rather laid-\nback. If I did not feel like swimming, he would not push me to\ndo so. However, the decision to join the national team was\nactually made by both of us. (R5)\nThis reflects findings from previous research, which\nclaimed that ESAs began their careers during their adoles-\ncent years and through the encouragement of others, such as\ncoaches and parents (Allison & Meyer, 1988).\nTeammates were also an important determinant for ESAs'\ndecision to stay with the team. Henri (R2) and Salena (R4)\nconfirmed this, stating,\nMy teammates gave me guidance on future career planning, the\nbenefit of korfball, and how to better perform in my studies.\nMy teammates--they make me stay in this team. (R4)\nIn addition, parental influence on competitive youth\nsports socialization has received considerable attention\n(Holt, Tamminen, Black, Sehn, & Wall, 2008; Wuerth, Lee,\n& Alfermann, 2004). ESAs' parents may be agents to assist\nor resist their dual career development. Based on the devel-\nopmental model (Wylleman & Lavallee, 2004), parents may\nlikely be the most influential group for ESAs. One typical\nexperience was shared by Henri (R2):\nAt the start, they (my parents) did not support me in pursuing\nkorfball. They did not think that playing korfball can be a career.\nSum et al. 7\nLater on, when I went to Holland, they began to realise that\nkorfball could be a springboard for better development. Now,\nthey give me verbal encouragement, but I do feel that, in their\nheart, they do not really support my decision. (R2)\nWith the full support of parents, ESAs can extract their\npotential both in athletics and academics. Young (R3)\nstressed that his parents had done a lot to support him:\nMy biggest supporters are my parents . . . they are not athletes.\nThey will always stand by me because volleyball is what I am\ninterested in. My parents will come to watch every game I play.\nThey take photos at my games to keep a record of my growth at\nevery stage. When I suffer an injury, they take care of me. I share\nall the happenings in school with them. (R3)\nConversely, Kennard (R8) received no support from his\nparents:\nI have often been frustrated. My parents did not like that I played\nbasketball. They thought that basketball was a waste of time and\nthat it affected my studies. Actually, I did not study well before\nI played basketball. Before I began to do well at basketball\ncompetitions, I often felt upset because I had to bear the pressure\nfrom both my studies and training. I was at a loss. (R8)\nParental involvement substantially contributes to ESAs'\naffective experience of sport participation both positively and\nnegatively (Knight, Neely, & Holt, 2011). In particular, parents\ncan affect their children's enjoyment or anxiety about their\nsport participation (Anderson, Funk, Elliott, & Smith, 2003).\nStudies on siblings'influence on elite athletes'dual career\ndevelopment is lacking. This study revealed that siblings'\nsupport can be a determinant that affects ESAs' dual career\ndevelopment. Hardy (R7) demonstrated this claim:\nI did not get much financial support from my parents. I was in\ngreat need of money from Form 2 to Form 6 for both my studies\nand training. It was my elder brother who sponsored me during\nthat period. (R7)\nSeparately, Hardy (R7) had experienced negative feed-\nback from other subject teachers. He disclosed,\nA teacher at my school once told me that I should give up\nrunning and concentrate on my studies because I would never\nachieve remarkable results like one of my seniors did. I turned a\ndeaf ear to the teacher and kept on practicing. We met again\nwhen I became a successful athlete a few years later. The teacher\nadmitted that he was wrong. (R7)\nPhysical education teachers were significant in positively\ninfluencing ESAs' dual career development. Salena (R4)\nstated that\nMy teacher in junior high school made me realise that my\nabilities in tug-of-war can get me admitted into a good senior\nhigh school. He was a PE teacher, not a coach for a specific\nsport. However, he was interested in tug-of-war as a sport, so he\ntraveled around to learn about it and came back to teach us. (R4)\nIn addition, PE teachers can also play crucial roles in\nhelping ESAs' dual career development in terms of counsel-\ning them to achieve excellence in their chosen sport and pro-\nvide additional support, such as injury prevention and\nphysical training and conditioning (Sum & Ma, 2014).\nMeso-Level Determinants\nMeso-level determinants refer to two or more micro-level\ninterrelated determinants that influence ESAs at the meso-\nlevel (Bronfenbrenner, 1994; Figure 1). In most cases, there\nwere two determinants that interacted together. Indeed,\nYvonne (R1) stated,\nIn my high school, I was allowed to take a \"make-up\" exam with\na consensus reached between my coach and my subject teachers\n. . . My teacher set another paper for me to have an exam . . .\nOther student athletes were also allowed to take \"make-up\"\nexams if they had to compete during the exam season. Teachers\nwould give necessary assistance in our studies after training. We\nwere free to join these after-class study sections. (R1)\nCoaches and subject teachers can facilitate ESAs' dual\ncareer development. A typical case of this was expressed by\nYoung (R3):\nAn arrangement was made by the coach and other subject\nteachers of the school. They planned for us to study together for\nabout an hour a day. (R3)\nThis positive interaction between parents and coaches is\ncrucial for ESAs' athletic and academic achievement. Hardy\n(R7) asserted that\nMy coach once advised me that I should assure my parents that\nI can work hard at both my studies and sports. I followed what\nhe said and let my parents know my coach's expectations,\nsharing with them my progress in my studies and my sport.\nLater on, when I won prizes at competitions, my parents began\nto feel proud of me. They started to talk about my achievements\nin running. (R7)\nVella, Oades, and Crowe (2010) commented that a posi-\ntive relationship and good communication between coach\nand parents can provide ESAs with a healthy environment to\ndevelop their dual career. In particular, parents' attitudes and\nbehavior are associated with ESAs' perceptions of their abil-\nity, positive and negative effect, motivation orientation, atti-\ntudes toward and attraction to sport participation (Brustad\nBecause all the ESAs had studied in high schools and uni-\nversities while simultaneously training as elite athletes, PE\n8 SAGE Open\nteachers, alumni, seniors, and classmates play significant\nroles in assisting them in their career growth in the school\nenvironment. Henri (R2) stated,\nMy PE teacher led me into this field. My classmates also played\na part and I was influenced by them. Seniors and alumni of the\nteam were always very supportive of my studies and sport. They\nalways meet together with a mission to improve the sports\nculture of the school. (R2)\nDeliberately finding a workable balance among meso-\nlevel determinants such as coaches, subject teachers, parents,\nPE teachers, alumni, seniors, and classmates may lead ESAs\nto excel academically (such as graduating with a degree) as\nwell as achieve highly in athletic performance (Simiyu,\nExo-Level Determinants\nThe exo-level comprises social structure, activities, and pro-\ncesses in two or more settings (Bronfenbrenner, 1994), such\nas government, financial, policy, academic, medical, and\nparent-teacher association (Figure 1), which affect ESAs in\ntheir immediate environment. Yvonne (R1) stressed how the\ngovernment, policies, and financial support affected her dual\ncareer development:\nThe school waives the miscellaneous fee for student athletes,\nwhich means that we only have to pay the tuition fee. XXX is a\nprivate school and is much more expensive than the public ones.\nIn addition, we can apply to the government for scholarships\nwhen we win titles in games. The government offers big\nincentives to native Taiwanese athletes like me. (R1)\nSpecial academic admission schemes tailor-made for\nESAs were evident in Yvonne's (R1) case:\nThere are also favorable offers in admission tests. After gaining\nsome certificates, athletes can be admitted into high school or\nuniversity with scores lower than the common standard. Some\nuniversities also have a specific track for athlete admission. Student\nathletes have to pass theTaiwan college entrance exam as well as an\nathletic performance exam such as a Taekwondo test. (R1)\nIn terms of medical determinants, Henri (R2) stated that\nI would find the athletic trainers in the infirmary first. If it is a\nserious injury, they would send me to the hospital at once. There\nis a collaborating Orthopaedic Hospital right beside my school.\nIn Hong Kong, as a Special Administration Region (SAR)\nin China, there is a parent\u00adteacher association in almost\nevery secondary school. In the focus group interview, ESAs\nexpressed that the parent\u00adteacher association gave them a\nnegative impression because they always appeared to push\nstudents to study. However, Bel (R6) expressed a different\nview:\nUnlike other parent-teacher associations, meetings are held\nperiodically for the development of students, particularly\nschools with a long tradition of sports development. The\nassociation arranges training and sponsors some sport equipment\nfor ESAs. (R6)\nSnow (R5) echoed that\nMy school does not have enough budget to operate its parent-\nteacher association. The activities are low-cost ones, like book\nrecycling and selling of second-hand school uniforms to ESAs\nin need of them. (R5)\nThere is no official parent\u00adteacher association in Taiwan.\nRegarding full tuition waiver in private schools in Taiwan,\nHenri (R2) disclosed that\nThe parents of private schools are usually very wealthy and\nmore generous with donations to the school. The principal finds\nsponsorship from parents. A Parent Fund is formed accordingly\nfor ESAs who are not as wealthy to apply. (R2)\nConsistent with the holistic athletic career model\n(Wylleman, Reints, & De Knop, 2013), ESAs experienced a\ncombination of elite sports and higher education academic\nchallenges, as well as financial development with family and\ngovernment determinants in their dual career development,\nat the exo-level.\nMacro-Level Determinants\nThe macro-level forms the social structure and activities in\nthe micro-, meso-, and exo-levels (Bronfenbrenner, 1994).\nThe macro-level determinants comprise the relationship\nbetween attitudes, norms, values, beliefs, resources, and cul-\nture (Figure 1). These determinants influence ESAs within\nthe different levels to make decisions on their dual career\ndevelopment. We sought the ESAs' perspectives on how\nmacro-level determinants influence their attitudes, norms,\nvalues, and beliefs. In this regard, Snow (R5) shared her\nexperience:\nI find that XXXX University respects my decisions. XXXX\nUniversity would expect athletes to perform well, and that is\nalso my goal. XXXX University shares my values, as they\nwould want me to represent Hong Kong to take part in games\nlike Universiade Games and do well there. That is also what I\nam aiming for. (R5)\nBel (R6) shared further,\nMy school places an all-rounded development as their core\nvalue. This is a great source of motivation to me. I therefore try\nSum et al. 9\nhard to do well in both sports and academics. My values are\naligned with that of my school. (R6)\nIn contrast, Henri (R2) shared his experience in partici-\npating in a nonfocus sport identified by the university. He\nexpressed that\nThe dean and the teachers of the faculty wanted to cut the\nnumber of recommended korfball players in the university as\nkorfball was not a focus sport in the university. I felt a bit\nembarrassed when they talked with us about this. (R2)\nUneven funding allocated to focus and nonfocus sports\nseemed a normal practice that affects the support of ESAs'\nfor training and competition. Young (R3) studied at the same\nuniversity as Henri (R2). He had the following claims:\nIt is normal that a larger part of the subsidy is given to players of\npopular sports. It is the university's responsibility to help those less\npopular sports teams to raise funds using its social connections. (R3)\nRegarding how institutions value ESAs in athletic and\nacademic performance, and in return to benefit the institu-\ntions, Hardy (R7) expressed that\nFor me, I felt that I was protected and cared for. In return, I\nwould like to contribute to the good of my school. For example,\nI would see if I can do anything to help with the school track and\nfield team, and with other students. (R7)\nKennard (R8) echoed that\nXXX College value my contribution. I am glad that the principal\nknows me, and I was given a chance when I failed in the public\nexamination. I think they [the college] appreciate me. I can feel\nthat they have high expectations of both my academic studies\nand my performance at competitions. I think they have a good\nimpression of me. (R8)\nMorgan (2001) affirmed that student athletes will be more\ncontent when there is congruence between an individual and\ntheir learning environment. As such, when student athletes\nperceived their learning environment to be more supportive\nof their academic and social needs, they tended to have an\nabove-average academic performance compared with the\nnormal student population (Kuh, Cruce, Shoup, Kinzie, &\nIn accordance with the above, ESAs enjoy sufficient\nresources both from their athletic and academic institutions.\nHardy (R7) stressed that the government has increased its\nsupport a lot after some national level medals were won in\nsome focus sports:\nThe support can only be given to athletes with existing\nachievements. An example can be found in the East Asian Games.\nAt the time, basketball and football enjoyed great support from the\ngovernment because they won medals in the Games. Afterwards,\nthey were given very good venues and other resources, which\nsignificantly helped progress their performance. (R7)\nIn academic institutions, Snow (R5) and Hardy (R7) con-\ntended that\nXXXX University has a lot of decent resources to support\nathletes. But most of their scholarships take your family's\nfinancial situation into account. (R5)\nXXX [school] did invest a lot in sports facilities. XXX is very\nwell-equipped. It invested a lot in sports resources. (R7)\nIn terms of academic support, Salena (R4) expressed that\nWe had extra English tutoring sections after training in high\nschool. Our school sent an experienced English teacher to help\nus improve our English. Our school also emphasised Maths\neducation. In XXXX, we have foreign teachers to teach us\nEnglish. (R4)\nESAs may be deeply influenced by the institutions where\nthey are being socialized. Hardy (R7) remarked that\nSelf-confidence is part of the XXX [school] culture. A XXX\nstudent always knows what he wants. We dedicate ourselves to\nspecific fields, academic studies or other areas, to manifest our\nvalue. In XXX, many students have been brought up for specific\nlife goals from a very young age. Thanks to their goal-based\ntrajectory, many of them succeed in realising their goals. This is\npossibly a justifiable reason behind the self-confidence of the\nXXX people. (R7)\nAs culture is generally shared distinctive attitudes,\nnorms, beliefs, values, and resources of members among\n\"culture specific approaches should be encouraged to make\ncareer development and transition studies more socio-\nculturally informed.\"\nChrono-Level Determinants\nChrono-level denotes that ESAs' dual career development\nchanges over time (Bronfenbrenner, 1994), which affects\ntheir access to athletic and/or academic careers. From the\nresults of this study, some \"significant others\" at the micro-\nlevel played important roles at the beginning of ESAs' dual\ncareer development. However, as time goes by, they seemed\nto have less of an influence on ESAs' lives.\nBel (R6) recalled that her parents' roles were diminishing:\nMy parents' roles are less important nowadays. That could be\ncaused by the fact that I am swimming less now that I am in\nuniversity. We were closer when I was in secondary school, and\nthey have been respectful of my opinions since I was young.\nWhen it comes to decision making, I did successfully convince\nthem to let me go my way on a few occasions. However, for\nmost of the time, I would simply follow my parents' directions.\nI am after all quite an obedient child, and would respect their\nopinions, too. (R6)\nSimilar to this is the perception of coaches' roles. Salena\n(R4) reflected that\nNormally, we follow what our coaches say.We seldom challenged\nour coaches when we were younger. After we entered university,\nhowever, we were more likely to retort. (R4)\nApart from the above, Wylleman and Lavallee (2004)\nstated that to remain at an elite level during a long career\ndevelopment period until termination, ESAs not only invest\nat different levels of physical, social, and financial determi-\nnants, but also in their close environment with parents,\ncoaches, peers, and teachers. Student athletes are required to\ncope with changes within the social environment at the ter-\ntiary level, which strongly differ from those at the secondary\nConclusion\nFindings concerning the social-ecological determinants of\nathletes' dual career development are revealed at different\nlevels of the ecological system (Bronfenbrenner, 1977,\n1994). Concerning the main research question--How do\nsocial-ecological determinants affect ESAs' lives and career\ndevelopment?--in spite of the fact that career aims, identi-\nties, roles, characters, self-efficacy, and motivation are indi-\nvidual determinants, ESAs' coaches and parents play a\nsignificant role (Sheridan, Coffee, & Lavallee, 2014) at\nmicro- and meso-levels. Also, available resources, such as\ngovernment support, financial assistance, academic, and\nmedical care, can be found at an exo-level. However, how\nESAs develop their dual career is highly dependent on their\ninstitutional culture at a macro-level. Finally, the chrono-\nlevel, encompassing the interrelationship of different levels\nof determinants including critical incidents that emerge in an\nESA's life, emphasizes that career development of each tran-\nsitional stage may be varied.\nThrough employing ecological systems theory\nstudy has explored how social-ecological determinants affect\nESAs'lives and career development. The explorations under-\ntaken in this study have contributed to understanding of the\nculturally specific experiences of ESAs in the context of\nTaiwan and Hong Kong.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nstudy was funded by the Direct Grant for Research of CUHK (proj-\nReferences\nAghdasi, M.
