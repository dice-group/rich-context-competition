    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe propose an algorithm to model contagion in the interbank market via what we term\nthe credit quality channel. In existing models on contagion via interbank credit, external\nshocks to banks often spread to other banks only in case of a default. In contrast, shocks\nare transmitted via asset devaluations and deteriorations in the credit quality in our algo-\nrithm: First, the probability of default (PD) of those banks directly affected by some shock\nincreases. This increases the expected loss of the credit portfolios of the initially affected\nbanks' counterparties, thereby reducing the counterparties' regulatory capital ratio. From\na logistic regression, we estimate the increase in the counterparties' PD due to a reduced\ncapital ratio. Their increased PDs in turn affect the counterparties' counterparties, and so\non. This coherent and flexible framework is applied to bilateral interbank credit exposure\nof the entire German banking system in order to examine policy questions. For that pur-\npose, we propose to measure the potential cost of contagion of a given shock scenario by\nthe aggregated regulatory capital loss computed in our algorithm.\n",

Existing models on how external shocks to banks spread to other banks often assume that\nsome banks in the network actually default and do not consider less severe forms of distress such as asset\ndevaluations and deterioration in the credit quality of certain exposure classes. We establish a framework\nwhich quantifies the impact of contagion and develop a measure of systemic risk which is associated\nwith the interbank lending channel.\nContribution\nThe proposed framework computes the aggregate Tier 1 capital loss to the banking system as a unit\nto measure the costs of interconnectedness. An initial shock propagates through the network of banks\nby increasing the expected losses of the credit portfolios of all directly and indirectly connected banks.\nThe mechanism relies on the empirically observed relationship between banks' capital ratios and their\nprobabilities of default. In combination with regulatory requirements and accounting standards we do\nnot only simulate the propagation of big shocks such as bank failures, but also of smaller shocks such as\na decrease in the credit quality of mortgages. The algorithm is put to the test using the bilateral interbank\ncredit exposure of the entire German banking system.\nResults\nWe find that the contagion risk in the German interbank network is concentrated around four of the\n1,710 banks. When analyzing the effectiveness of additional capital buffers of up to 2.5pp (buffer for\nsystemically important financial institutions, SIFIs), we conclude that their buffers are not high enough\nto absorb the costs of the failure of any other SIFI. Moreover, we find that the losses from indirect credit\nexposure is much higher than from direct exposure in case a SIFI defaults. From this we conclude that\nit is crucial to account not only for direct exposure but rather the entire network when evaluating the\ninterconnectedness of banks. In a different policy application we find that a shock to the mortgage sector\nhits the banking system twice: once in the form of write-downs to their own portfolio and also, in equal\nmeasure, in the form of the losses of their counterparties in the financial system. Properly calibrated\ncapital buffers can effectively reduce the losses from contagion.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nFragestellung\nWie k\u00f6nnen Ansteckungskosten im Bankensystem auf Grund von exogenen Schocks, die nur einzel-\nne Banken betreffen und durch Verkn\u00fcpfungen am Interbankmarkt an andere Banken weitergegeben\nwerden, in \u00f6konomisch sinnvoller Weise gemessen werden?

The impact of interbank lending on financial\nstability is twofold. On the one hand, interconnected banks may improve risk sharing and diversification,\nthereby alleviating their exposure to idiosyncratic shocks, as noted by Allen and Gale (2000) and Freixas,\nParigi, and Rochet (2000). On the other hand, the network exposes all banks to the risk of contagion,\nthat is, of an adverse shock to one bank or a group of banks spreading to other interconnected banks,\nresulting in distress, or \u00ad in the worst case \u00ad in default. In this spirit, BCBS (2013) classifies the level of\ninterconnectedness as one main driver of systemic risk in the banking system.1 In the light of the recent\nfinancial crisis, the risk of contagion has increasingly become a matter of importance to regulators.\nTherefore, this paper focuses on the adverse effect of interbank credits as a source of contagion.\nTo simulate contagion in the interbank market, we analyze the impact of an increase in the debtor\nbank's probability of default (PD) on its creditor banks' PD, its creditor banks' creditor banks' PD, and\nso on. First, we follow regulatory and accounting requirements to compute the reduction of the cred-\nitor bank's Tier 1 capital ratio (Tier 1 capital over risk-weighted assets) induced by the debtor bank's\nlower PD. In essence, we aim to mimic banks' risk management practices based on external reporting\nrequirements. An increase in the debtor bank's PD results in a deterioration of the credit quality of the\nportfolio of its creditor banks because the creditor banks are exposed to higher expected and unexpected\ncredit losses. This will ultimately reduce the creditor banks' Tier 1 capital ratios. Then, we estimate the\nimpact of a decrease in a bank's Tier 1 capital ratio on its own PD using a logistic regression. Given\nthe relationship between the debtor banks' PD and the creditor banks' PD, our algorithm then simulates\na multiple-round contagion process where the PD of all the creditor banks deteriorates, which are con-\nnected (directly and indirectly via their counterparties) with those debtor banks subject to an exogenous\nshock. The increase in banks' PDs results in higher expected credit losses in the banking system. The\ncorresponding reduction in regulatory Tier 1 capital is proposed as a measure of the adverse effects of\ninterconnectedness caused by contagion via interbank credits.\nThe paper contributes to the academic literature and policy toolkit in several ways. Firstly, we are\nthe first to use banks' PD in combination with regulatory requirements and accounting standards as a\ncontagion mechanism in the interbank market, which we term the credit quality channel. In so doing,\nwe are able to simulate the propagation not only of big shocks such as bank failures, but even of small\nshocks such as a deterioration in the credit quality of mortgages.\nSecondly, we propose an economically meaningful metric to summarize the cost of interconnected-\nness: the reduction in regulatory Tier 1 capital of all banks in the network. This metric, called BSLoss\nfor short, also allows for an alternative interpretation. By construction it equals the balance sheet loss\ndue to an increase in loan loss allowances. Thirdly, we test our algorithm on the bilateral interbank credit\nexposure of the entire German banking system. We quantify the contagion cost of single bank failures\nand compute the benefit of a capital buffer for systemically important banks. Moreover, we compute the\nBSLoss which results from a shock to house prices and study the effectiveness of sectoral risk buffers in\nreducing this loss. The proposed model allows policy makers to monitor the build up of vulnerabilities\nover time and gives them a better understanding of the effectiveness of policy actions in response to\ndifferent types of shocks.\nIn our policy application, we find that the contagion risk in the German interbank network is con-\ncentrated around four or five of the 1,710 banks. Moreover, losses from indirect credit exposure can be\nmuch higher than from direct exposure. In the case of a failure of one of the five most interconnected\nbanks, the costs from indirect exposure exceed the costs from direct exposure by a factor up to 15. From\n1Systemic risk, as defined by BIS, IMF, and OECD (2001), is a risk that an event will trigger a loss of confidence\nin a substantial portion of the financial system that is serious enough to have adverse consequences for the real\neconomy.\nthis we conclude that it is crucial to account not only for direct exposure but rather the entire network\nwhen evaluating the interconnectedness of banks. When analyzing the effectiveness of additional capital\nbuffers of up to 2.5pp (buffer for systemically important financial institutions, SIFIs), we conclude that\ntheir buffers are not high enough to absorb the costs of the failure of any other SIFI. In a different policy\napplication, we find that a shock to the mortgage sector hits the banking system twice: once in the form\nof write-downs to their own portfolio and also, in equal measure, in the form of the losses incurred by\ntheir counterparties in the financial system. An additional capital buffer which is proportional to each\nbank's exposure to the mortgage sector (systemic risk buffer) can effectively reduce the losses from con-\ntagion if they are calibrated well. Given a certain stress scenario, our framework can be used for such\ncalibration.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the relevant literature with a focus\non the DebtRank. In Section 3 we introduce the algorithm of the BSLoss. Section 4 presents the results\nof two policy experiments. Section 5 concludes.\n2 Literature\nMost of the studies on the adverse effects of interbank credits on the stability of the banking system\nfollow two strands of literature. The first one refers to default cascade models: A bank default triggers a\nloss on interbank lending for its creditor banks. This, in turn, may trigger a default of the creditor banks\nand a corresponding loss to the creditors' creditor banks, and so forth. In this spirit, Eisenberg and Noe\n(2001) propose a static model in which a clearing payment vector describes a fair allocation of losses\nthat result from an external shock. This vector represents a function of the operating cash flows of the\nmembers of the financial network and satisfies the requirements of limited liability, debt priority and pro-\nrata reimbursements. Rogers and Veraart (2012) extend the modeling framework of Eisenberg and Noe\n(2001) by introducing default costs in the system. They analyze situations in which solvent banks have an\nincentive to rescue failing banks and conclude how such a rescue consortium might be constructed. More\nrecently, Acemoglu, Ozdaglar, and Tahbaz-Salehi (2015) have generalized the results of Eisenberg and\nNoe (2001) by showing that, regardless of the structure of the financial network, a payment equilibrium\n\u00ad consisting of a mutually consistent collection of asset liquidations and repayments of interbank loans \u00ad\nalways exists and is generically unique. They provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis between the\nstructure of the financial network and the likelihood of systemic failure due to contagion of counterparty\nrisk. As long as negative shocks imposed on banks are sufficiently small a dense interconnected financial\nnetwork enhances financial stability. In contrast, beyond a certain threshold, dense interconnections serve\nas a mechanism for the propagation of shocks and thus threatens financial stability. Focusing more on\nempirical findings, Mistrulli (2011) explores how banks' defaults propagate within the Italian interbank\nmarket. He finds that contagion based on actual exposure patterns tends to exceed contagion based on\nhypothetical exposure patterns (eg entropy maximization method) which previous works often had to\nrely on due to the lack of actual bilateral exposure information. Memmel and Sachs (2011) develop\na default cascade model with stochastic losses given default (LGDs) which follow approximately a u-\nshaped Beta distribution and is calibrated on realized recovery rates from defaulted interbank exposures.\nThey conclude that contagion in the German interbank market can occur and that the number of bank\ndefaults increases on average if a stochastic LGD is assumed instead of a constant one.\nThe second strand of literature refers to centrality measures, which are used to identify the most\nimportant node in a network. Different centrality measures exist which reflect different interpretations\nof importance. Landherr, Friedl, and Heidemann (2010) provide a critical review of different central-\nity measures. One of the most simplistic measures is the degree centrality which counts the number of\nconnections one node has to other nodes. More complex measures are recursive centrality measures.\nAccording to this concept, the centrality of one node in the network depends not only on the amount of\nits direct connections, but also on the centrality of the nodes it is connected to. As a result, the centralities\nof all (connected) nodes influence each other recursively. Recursive centrality can also be described as a\nweighted sum of all direct and indirect connections of any length. This concept is formalized mathemat-\nically in the standard eigenvector centrality by Bonacich (1972). Another version of recursive centrality\nmeasures is the PageRank, developed by Google's co-founder Larry Page, to assess the importance of\nwebsites. In the wake of the recent financial crisis the concept of recursive centrality measures has\ngained popularity as an indicator of interconnectedness in the banking system. To name a few, ECB\n(2012) and Brunnermeier, Clerc, and Scheicher (2013) applied recursive centrality measures to assess\nstructural vulnerabilities and the level of interconnection of banks. Alter, Craig, and Raupach (2015)\napply different centrality concepts to capital rules on the banking system. They find that capital rules\nbased on eigenvector centrality dominate traditional capital requirements and capital rules based on any\nother centrality measure. Martinez-Jaramillo, Alexandrova-Kabadjova, Bravo-Benitez, and Solorzano-\nMargain (2014) propose a unified measure of centrality. Conducting a principal component analysis,\nthey suggest a unique index of centrality which incorporates information of several centrality measures.\nDefault cascade models and centrality measures have their merits and limitations, as outlined by Bat-\ntiston, Puliga, Kaushik, Tasca, and Caldarelli (2012). Default cascade models provide an easy economic\ninterpretation of contagion. Their measure, which is the loss occurring in the banking system conse-\nquently to a bank's default, allows comparisons to be made between different banking systems and for\none banking system at various points in time. However, default cascade models are typically restricted\nto the case that only a default of a bank can result in adverse spill-over effects. Once no further bank\nfails, the contagion usually stops. This ignores the fact that a relatively small deterioration in the credit\nrating of an asset class or bank could already have negative consequences for the creditor banks' sol-\nvency, because their portfolio is exposed to a higher expected loss from an ex-ante perspective. Default\ncascade models are therefore indifferent to small changes in risk. By contrast, centrality measures are\nsensitive to all links in the system; vulnerabilities due to an increased level of interconnectedness can be\ncaptured before losses have materialized. While centrality measures are useful for rankings, the numbers\nare hard to interpret in economic terms. Thus, centrality measures can be used neither to quantify adverse\neffects from interconnectedness nor to assess the benefit of macroprudential action. Finally, they are not\ncomparable between different banking systems and for one banking system at various points in time.\nAgainst this background, Battiston et al. (2012) develop the DebtRank, which combines the benefits\nof recursive centrality measures and default cascade models to overcome the above-mentioned limita-\ntions. The DebtRank aims at measuring the economic loss caused by contagion after some predefined\nshock has hit one bank or a group of banks. In essence, the transmission of a shock results in an increase\nin the level of distress of the connected banks. Battiston et al. (2012) describe the level of distress for\nbanks by a continuous variable ranging between zero and one, where the lower boundary means \"undis-\ntressed\" and the upper boundary means \"default\". They construct an algorithm which postulates how\nbanks' levels of distress depend on each other. Accordingly, the level of distress of a bank, say bank A,\nis influenced by the level of distress of its debtor banks weighted by the relative exposure. The relative\nexposure describes a debtor-specific ratio and equals the loans between bank A and its debtors over Tier 1\ncapital of bank A. It reflects the relative portion of the Tier 1 capital of bank A which would be lost if the\ndebtor banks default and a recovery value of zero. To prevent reverberations, it is assumed that each bank\ncan propagate its distress only once. To measure the economic loss the difference between the banks'\ntotal assets weighted by the levels of distress after contagion and before contagion is calculated.\nThe DebtRank provides plenty of interesting insights into the adverse effects of interconnectedness.\nWe add to this measure a refined propagation mechanism and an enhanced interpretation and policy appli-\ncation. While the level of distress, one key variable of the DebtRank, remains abstract and unobservable,\nwe propose a model which defines the banks' level of distress as their PD. Further, the contagion and\nmutual interference process of banks' distress postulated by the DebtRank is proportional to banks' rel-\native exposure. While intuitive, there is no verification that distress just spreads in this way. To address\nthis issue, our model derives the contagion effect from the empiric relationship between a bank's Tier 1\ncapital ratio and its PD.\n3 Methodology\nTo simulate the contagion process we focus on assessing the impact a change in the debtor bank's PD has\non the creditor bank's PD. In this respect, we choose a two-step approach: First, we analyze the impact\na bank's Tier 1 capital ratio has on its own PD. In a second step, we investigate the impact the debtor\nbank's PD has on the creditor bank's Tier 1 capital ratio.\nIn the first step, we use a logistic regression to estimate the effect in a change of a bank's Tier 1\ncapital ratio on its PD. According to Packer and Tarashev (2011) high-quality capital measures, such\nas the Tier 1 capital ratio, are one important factor to assess a bank's credit quality. We use a logistic\nregression in order to estimate the effect of the Tier 1 capital ratio has on PD. In the second step, we\ncompute the influence the debtor bank's PD has on the creditor bank's Tier 1 capital ratio following\nregulatory and accounting requirements. In essence, we aim to mimic banks' risk management practices\nbased on external reporting requirements. An increase in the debtor bank's PD results in a deterioration\nof the credit quality of the portfolio of its creditor banks because the creditor banks may be exposed to\nhigher expected credit losses and to higher unexpected credit losses. The former is captured by an asset\ndevaluation on the creditor banks' balance sheet according to the applicable accounting standards, eg\nin the form of loan loss allowances (LLA) which are deducted from their Tier 1 capital.2 The latter is\nreflected by higher regulatory charges according to the Basel Accords, eg in the form of risk-weighted\nassets (RWA). Both effects drive down their Tier 1 capital ratios \u00ad defined as Tier 1 capital over RWA.\nWe then develop an algorithm which iteratively computes the change in each bank's PD after an\nexogenous shock has hit one bank or several banks. Exogenous shocks lead to a sudden deterioration in\nthe credit quality of the directly affected banks resulting in their distress or default. Given the relationship\nbetween the debtor bank's PD and the creditor bank's PD, default or distress of one bank or a group\nof banks may result in a subsequent increase of PDs of its creditor banks, and the creditors' creditor\nbanks, and so on. In order to capture this mechanism, the algorithm models a multiple-round contagion\nprocess where the PDs of all the creditor banks deteriorate, which are connected (directly and indirectly)\nwith those debtor banks subject to the exogenous shock. The increase in banks' PDs results in higher\nexpected credit losses in the banking system. The corresponding reduction in Tier 1 capital is proposed as\na measure for the adverse effects of interconnectedness caused by contagion through interbank lending.\n3.1 Contagion algorithm\nAfter having explained the conceptual idea of our algorithm in a narrative way, we will now put it into\na mathematical format. Before doing so we need to introduce some notation. Let us denote by Wij the\ninterbank loan by bank i to bank j. The variable PD0(i) describes bank i's initial PD at iteration step\nk = 0, before the shock occurs. The PD reflects the bank's probability of failing within the next year.\nFurthermore, let PDk(i|A) be the PD of bank i at iteration step k conditional on the exogenous shock\nevent A that takes place at k = 1. Each PDk(i|A) is a continuous variable with PDk(i|A)  [0, 1],\nwhere PDk(i|A) = 1 means that bank i is in default status at iteration step k.3 The leverage ratio of\nbank i at iteration step k, defined by Tier 1 capital divided by total assets (net of LLA), is denoted by\nLevi,k = Tier1i,k/TAi,k. Similarly, the capital ratio is a risk-based measure under supervisory capital\n2Our approach, which refers to the 1-year expected credit losses with 1-year PDs, follows common risk man-\nagement practices and is compatible with LLA under the currently applicable International Accounting Standard\n(i|A) = PD0\n(i).\nstandards and is denoted by CapRati,k = Tier1i,k/RWAi,k. In order to compute the risk weights,\ndenoted by RWij, and ultimately the risk-weighted assets for bank i at iteration step k, RWAi,k, we\nfollow the methodology adopted for the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approach of the Basel supervisory\ncapital frameworks. In this context, LGD denotes loss given default and M the residual maturity.\nAn exogenous shock is introduced in the banking system. Denote by S the set of banks subject to\nthe exogenous shock. There are two different ways by which the shock can affect the Tier 1 capital ratios\nof those banks which belong to the set S. The first is an abrupt reduction in Tier 1 capital. The second is\na sudden increase in risk-weighted assets. Consequently, the changes in the relevant variables due to the\nshock event A at iteration step k = 1 can be expressed by\n=\nTier1i,0 for all i /\n S\nRWAA\n=\nRWAi,0 + 2i for all i  S\nRWAi,0 for all i /\n S\n,\nwhere 1i, 2i  0 reflect the level of stress imposed on the banks which belong to S. Then CapRatA\n=\n.\nWe compute the effect of the change in the banks' capital ratio on their PDs using a logistic regres-\nsion:\nPDi,t = F( + caprat \u00b7 ln(CapRati,t-1)), (1)\nwhere F(z) = ez/(1 + ez) is the cumulative logistic distribution and PDi,t is the probability that the\nbank will fail in time (t - 1, t].4 From Equation (1) we obtain\nln(\nPDi,t\n) - ln(\n) = ^\n \u00b7 (CapRati,t-1 - CapRati,t-2). (2)\nBefore returning to our algorithm a remark on terminology is necessary. Since we empirically es-\ntimate the relationship between the capital ratio and the PD, the logistic regression described above\nobviously includes a time aspect. However, it is important to highlight that the iteration below is not\nnecessarily related to time. Most of the adjustments in the balance-sheet variables do not occur within a\npre-specified time-horizon. In order to clearly emphasize this important fact we use index k rather than\nt as a reference to a specific iteration step in the contagion process.\nRearranging terms and using the algorithm rather than the regression notation, Equation (2) can be\nrewritten as:\nPDk(i|A) =\nPDk-1(i|A)\nCapRati,k\nCapRati,k-1\n^\n\nCapRati,k\nCapRati,k-1\n^\n\nFormula (3) enables us to compute a new PD (conditional on event A) as a function of banks' previous\nPD, its current and previous Tier 1 capital ratio, as well as the estimated coefficient ^\n in an iterative\nprocedure. For simplicity we use (CapRati,k, CapRati,k-1, PDk-1(i|A), ^\n) as an abbreviation for\nthe right side of formula (3).\n4Indeed, we will later add time-invariant control variables which we omit in this section for ease of notation as\nthey do not affect the derivation of the formulas. Moreover, one might also want to add some time-varying control\nvariables in order to isolate the impact of the Tier 1 capital ratio on the PD from other variables. However, the\nestimated relation between the capital ratio and the PD would then only be correct if all other explanatory variables\nremained constant. This is however not the case, neither in our algorithm nor in reality. Therefore, we will use ^\n\nfrom (1) as our base case. Nevertheless, as a robustness check in our empirical aplication, we will also present the\nmain results for the case that time-variant control variables are used.\nWe consider a bank as defaulted and set its PD to one, if some pre-defined default criteria are met.\nThe default criteria may reflect insolvency in the strict sense, ie Tier1 < 0. More sensitive default\ncriteria may reflect minimum regulatory requirements, or other boundaries which are not set by the\nsupervisor, but implicitly set by the market. We denote the default criteria by CapRatcrit and Levcrit\nwhich reflect critical values for the capital ratio and the leverage ratio.\nAfter the initial shock, for k  2, the algorithm updates the banks' balance sheet variables with\nrespect to the changed counterparties' PDs of round k - 1:\nTAi,k = TAi,k-1 -\nj\nWij \u00b7 LGD \u00b7 (PDk-1(j|A) - PDk-2(j|A))\nj\nWij \u00b7 LGD \u00b7 (PDk-1(j|A) - PDk-2(j|A))\nkRWj = RW(PDk-1(j|A), LGD, M) - RW(PDk-2(j|A), LGD, M)\nRWAi,k = RWAi,k-1 +\nj\nkRWj \u00b7 Wij.\nIn these formulae the index j runs through all counterparties of bank i. For more details on the computa-\ntion of Tier 1i,k, TAi,k and RWAi,k we refer to Appendix A1. The algorithm then updates the banks'\ncurrent PD using Equation (3) if the bank has not defaulted in an earlier step of the iteration and sets it\nequal to 1 otherwise.\nThe algorithm stops after a finite number of steps, in round K, once the change in the PD for each\nbank is smaller than some small, positive value . We may assume that the algorithm terminates because\nthe sequence PD0(A), PD1(A),..., PDk(A),... of vectors of the PDs has a monotonic limit for the\nfollowing two reasons: By construction it has the vector 1 (each component equals 1) as an upper bound;\nand furthermore, it is monotonically increasing if ^\ncaprat > 0. Then PDk-1(i|A) - PDk-1(i|A)2 \n0 and CapRati,k+1  CapRati,k imply that the slope of the PD curve expressed as a function of\nln(CapRat) is negative. This reasoning refers to formulae (1) and (2) above as well as (5) and (6) in\nAppendix A2.\nFinally, we define the banking system loss as\nA\n=\nj\n(TAj,1 - TAj,K) =\nj\nwhere K is the last round before the algorithm stops, ie it is the number of iterations carried out by the\ncontagion algorithm and the index j runs through all banks of the network. The metric BSLoss measures\nthe accumulated loss of Tier 1 capital, or equivalently the balance sheet loss due to a devaluation of\nassets, to the banking system induced by the contagion effect following the event A.5\nNote that we chose to not capture the initial shock, as BSLoss is meant to be a measure of conta-\ngion. Nevertheless, we could easily include the initial loss using the following measure: BSLoss0,K\nA\n=\nj\n(Tier 1j,0 - Tier 1j,K). Further, policy makers could be interested in the costs borne solely by the\ndirect counterparties of the initially shocked institutions. This cost can be measured by: BSLoss1,2\nA\n=\nj\n(Tier 1j,1 - Tier 1j,2). Similarly, policy makers could be interested in the costs from indirect con-\ntagion effects from round 2 onwards. This cost can be measured by: BSLoss2,K\nA\n= j\nTier 1j,K). On a different note, policy makers might want to know how many institutions failed during\nthe contagion process: DF1,K\nA\n= j\nx(j), where x(j) = 1 if PDK(j|A) = 1 and x(j) = 0 else. More\nso, they could be interested by how much the average PD in the system has decreased as a consequence\nof event A: PDA = j\n(PDK (j|A)-PD0(j|A))\nN\n.\n5For notational ease, we will drop the subscript A and the superscript 1, K in most instances.\nIn addition, it may be of interest not only to quantify the BSLoss given one bank or a group of\nbanks are hit by a shock, but also how likely the shock and the resulting BSLoss will occur. A practical\napproach to consider the expected BSLoss is to multiply the BSLoss with the initial PD of the bank\nsubject to the initial shock A.6 This expected BSLoss would be suited to benchmark certain policy\ninterventions, such as the introduction of a SIFI-buffer (see Section 4.2).\n3.2 Properties of the algorithm\nIn this section we want to show that the sequence of PDs and the corresponding losses that are generated\nby the algorithm described in the previous section converge and are unique if the network of banks is\nspecified by an initial state of capital ratios, ie both the numerator and denominator of the Tier 1 capital\nratios are given for each bank, and by the matrix W of the interbank network of bilateral exposures.\nBy construction BSLoss is a function of both the vector PD0 of initial PDs of the banks in the\nnetwork and the size of the shock  which is imposed on the banks in the set S, ie\nBSLoss : {[0, 1]n , R+\n} - R+\n,\nwith n describing the number of banks and R+\nthe set of non-negative real numbers.7 The iterative\nprocedure which generates BSLoss may be interpreted as a limit\nBSLoss = lim\nk\nBSLossk(PDk),\nwith BSLossk being the cumulated loss until the iteration step k and with PDk = (PDk(1, A), . . . ,\nPDk(n, A)) for each k  1. An operator  : [0, 1]n - [0, 1]n assigns a new vector of PDs to an\ninitial vector of PDs in each step of the iteration, ie PDk+1 = (PDk). Since a PD is a real number in\nthe interval [0, 1] the domain of  is the cube [0, 1]n. Therefore, the sequence of the PD vectors has a\nmonotonic limit\nPD = lim\nk\nPDk.\nBy construction, the operator  which generates the sequence of PDs is continuous from the left.\nThe reason for this property is that a jump in the operator  can only occur if a bank is assigned to the\ndefault state in a certain step of the iteration. This happens if one of the values of the capital ratio or the\nleverage ratio falls below the critical values. In the event a bank reaches the critical values for one of\nthese ratios, but does not fall below it, this bank is still considered to be compliant with the regulatory\nstandards.\nMore formally, the property of being continuous from the left reads as follows: For each sequence\nPDk such that limk PDk = PD and PDk < PD for all k the order of limit and operator can be\ninterchanged, ie limk (PDk) = (limk PDk). Consequently, monotonicity of the sequence\nof the PD vectors PDi in combination with the property that  is continuous from the left ensures that\nthe iterative procedure converges and has the limit (PD). Hence, the contagion algorithm can be\ninterpreted as a fixed point iteration. It generates a unique fixed point PD (ie a vector of PDs) and the\ncorresponding BSLoss under the assumptions described above. This fixed point describes a steady state\nafter the network of banks has reacted to an external shock.\n6In case a group of banks are hit by the shock, one would need to specify the initial joint PD for the respective\ngroup of banks.\n7To keep the presentation in this subsection and the academic example simple we assume here that the size of\nthe shock is the same for each bank and applies to Tier 1 capital, ie the numerator of the capital ratio. However,\nall the statements hold true for more general shocks 1i, 2i, which may apply to both the numerator and the\ndenominator and are not necessarily equal in size for each bank.\nDue to the fact that the matrix W describes a very complex network, it turns out to be difficult\nto describe properties of each sequence PDk(i|A) or for BSLossk that go beyond the fact that these\nquantities converge. For this reason, we rely on a simple academic example to develop some intuition for\nthe algorithm and the sequences it generates and some of their basic properties. The academic example\ncan be found in Appendix A4.\nIt can be seen in this example that\n\u00b7 BSLoss(PD0, ) is monotonic in the size of the shock , ie a, b with a  b imply\nBSLoss(PD0, a)  BSLoss(PD0, b),\n\u00b7 BSLoss(PD0, ) is not continuous in its second argument  because the function may jump for\n\u00b7 the function BSLoss(PD0, ) is not continuous in the vector of initial PDs because small changes\nof PD0 may cause a jump in BSLoss (in the example, the function jumps if the initial PD of\n3.3 Benefit of policy intervention\nNext to quantifying the cost of contagion, policy makers are interested in determining the benefit of a\npolicy intervention. Our framework can easily accommodate this need by simulating the effect on the\nBSLoss if the Tier 1 capital of a group of banks SR is raised before the shock occurs, at k = 0:\n=\nTier1i,0 +  for all i  SR\n,\nwhere  is some positive number which denotes the magnitude of the regulatory intervention. In line\nwith Subsection 3.1,\nCapRatR\n/RWAi,0 and PDR\n(i) = (CapRatR\n, CapRati,0, PD0(i), ^\n).\nWe then use Tier1R\ninstead of Tier1i,0 and PDR\n(i) instead of PD0(i) in the general algorithm to\ncompute BSLossA,R, the banking system loss due to event A and regulation R where SR = . In order\nto compute the benefit of the regulation, we compute by how much the intervention was able to reduce\ncontagion of the shock event A: BA = BSLossA - BSLossA,R, where BSLossA is the banking\nsystem loss for the case in which no regulatory buffer is imposed, SR = .\nImplementation of the framework: policy intervention and contagion\nThroughout this box we use\n(CapRati,k, CapRati,k-1, PDi,k-1, ^\n) :=\nPDk-1(i|A)\nCapRati,k\nCapRati,k-1\n^\n\nCapRati,k\nCapRati,k-1\n^\n\nas an abbreviation.\nk = 0, regulatory intervention possible\n=\nTier1i,0 +  for all i  SR\nCapRatR\nPDR\n(i) = (CapRatR\n, CapRati,0, PD0(i), ^\n)\nk = 1, shock occurs\n- 1i for all i  S\notherwise\nRWAi,0 + 2i for all i  S\nRWAi,0 otherwise\nPD1(i|A) =\n1 if CapRati,k < CapRatcrit or Levi,k < Levcrit\nmin 1, (CapRati,1, CapRatR\n(i), ^\n) else\nk = 2, iterate\nTAi,k = TAi,k-1 -\nj\nWij \u00b7 LGD \u00b7 (PDk-1(j|A) - PDk-2(j|A))\nj\nWij \u00b7 LGD \u00b7 (PDk-1(j|A) - PDk-2(j|A))\nkRWj = max{0, RW(PDk-1(j|A), LGD, M) - RW(PDk-2(j|A), LGD, M)}\nRWAi,k = RWAi,k-1 +\nj\nkRWj \u00b7 Wij\nCapRati,k = Tier1i,k/RWAi,k\nPDk(i|A) =\n1 if CapRati,k < CapRatcrit or Levi,k < Levcrit\nmin 1, (CapRati,k, CapRati,k-1, PDi,k-1, ^\n) else\nk = k + 1, until PDK(i|A) - PDK-1(i|A) < .\nBSLoss = j\n4 Policy applications\nOur algorithm can be applied to various kinds of analyses related to macroprudential policy. It can be\nused to analyze the level of banking system loss for different types of shocks, such as idiosyncratic bank\nfailures or macroeconomic shocks. Furthermore, it allows us to compute by how much the banking\nsystem loss will be absorbed if we increase the Tier 1 capital for certain banks or in proportion to certain\nasset holdings. This makes our algorithm a useful tool to estimate the contagion cost of a forecast shock\nscenario and to determine the benefit of different types of capital surcharges that aim to curb potential\ncontagion.\nIn this section, we will first compute the BSLoss that results from the failure of each individual bank.\nSubsequently, we will analyze by how much BSLoss is reduced if a capital buffer for the most important\nbanks (SIFI-buffer) is introduced. Then, we will compute the BSLoss that results from an adverse shock\nto mortgages. Lastly, we will impose banks to hold more capital proportional to their investment in\nmortgages (sectoral risk buffer). We then compute by how much this policy intervention reduces the\nBSLoss that results from the adverse shock to mortgages.\n4.1 Data and parameter specification\nFor our analysis, we use end-of-year 2013 data on interbank loans obtained from the Deutsche Bun-\ndesbank's credit register of large exposures and loans of A\nC1.5 million or more. The interbank lending\nnetwork has the following properties. It is a directed graph (or \"digraph\") with 1, 710 nodes (banks) and\n20, 425 arcs (single loans from one bank to another). The average in-degree, ie the average number of\nloans a bank receives, is 12, ranging from 0 to 1, 357 loans. The number of loans a bank gives, ranges\nfrom 0 to 997. The average path length in the network is 2 with a diameter, ie the largest path between\nany two nodes in the network, of 5. The average clustering coefficient, which is a measure of cliquishness\nin a network ranging from 0 (very loose network) to 1 (very dense network), amounts to 0.71. Figure 1\nshows an extract of the network we use.8\n8In the network literature a path is defined as a sequence of links connecting two nodes such that no node is hit\ntwice. This fact distinguishes a path from a walk, since in the course of a walk every node in the network can be\nhit several times. The intuition behind the clustering coefficient can be illustrated by a simple example: imagine\nthree nodes of a network a,b and c with arcs ab and ac. The clustering coefficient gives the probability that there\nalso exists an arc bc.\nFigure 1: Extract of bank network\nNote: For illustrative purposes the graph only shows the top 6 banks whose default generates the largest BSLoss;\nsee Subsection 4.2. The graph contains 46 nodes and 1, 188 edges. Label, size and color of the nodes depend on\ntheir importance measured as the BSLoss their default generates. The thickness and the color of the edges represent\nthe size of the respective loan.\nThe end-of-year 2013 balance sheet data used in the algorithm stems from various sources: Tier 1\ncapital, total assets and RWAs are taken from German banks' reports to the Deutsche Bundesbank, the\nCommon Reporting Framework and the Banking Statistics. The unconditional PDs for the start of the\niteration k = 0 for German banks are derived from their credit ratings assigned by the three major rating\nagencies, namely Fitch Ratings, Moody's, and Standard & Poor's. In order to combine the information\nobtained from the three rating agencies, the average of the historically observed default rates per credit\nranking is calculated. If a bank is not rated by one of the three major rating agencies, then a standard\nrating investment grade range is assumed. For our application to the house price bubble, we use the\nabsolute amount of loans every bank holds in the real estate sector, which we obtain from the German\nbanks' reports to the Deutsche Bundesbank. Furthermore, the PD for mortgage loans is set to PDMg =\n1.5%, the average value for mortgage loans reported by a representative selection of German banks,\nbased on supervisory reports.\nFor the estimation of the elasticity parameter  which we need for Equation (3) we use a logistic\nregression as in Equation (1). Our unbalanced panel consists of 8, 288 observations over six years. The\ndependent variable equals one if a bank defaults as recorded by the Deutsche Bundesbank and zero oth-\nerwise. The independent variable is Tier 1 capital over RWA. We use lagged dependent variables in order\nto avoid endogeneity. Further, we include banking group dummies and regional dummies. The estimated\ncoefficients show the expected signs and can be found in Table 3 in Appendix A2. Most importantly, the\nTier 1 capital ratio is significant at the 1% significance level and ^\n = -1.25. Consequently, a higher\ncapital ratio significantly reduces a bank's PD. Figure 2 illustrates the estimated relationship between\ncapital ratio and the PD based on Equation (3).\nFigure 2: Estimated effect of capital ratio on probability of default\nNote: Assuming that a capital ratio of 11% is associated with a PD of 4%, we exemplarily compute the PD for\ndifferent values of the capital ratio based on Equation (3).\nFor the BSLoss algorithm, we choose the following parameters. The propagation of the exogenous\nshock stops when the changes in the PDs of all counterparties are smaller than a threshold value =\n10-6. We apply the following default criteria: A bank is considered as defaulted if its Tier 1 capital ratio\nfalls below 6%, reflecting the minimum capital requirements of the Basel 3 framework. To comply with\nthe rules of the Foundation IRB approach we apply a loss given default, or LGD, of 45%. This value\nreflects a conservative approach by assuming all interbank loans are unsecured. Furthermore, we assume\na residual maturity, M, of 2.5 years for exposures to the banking sector.\n4.2 Systemic importance of single institutions\nIn our first application, we compute the BSLoss of each institution's failure in turn. This exercise provides\na ranking of banks according to the danger their interconnectedness poses to the banking system and gives\npolicy makers an indication of the relative importance of each bank in the system. Supervisory resources\nmight be assigned according to this relative importance.\nTable 1 displays an excerpt of the results for the top 20 banks in the network whose default causes\nthe largest banking system loss. To accommodate confidentiality requirements, banks' identities are not\nrevealed and BSLoss is normalized, assigning a value of 1 to the bank with the greatest BSLoss. We can\ndeduce from column 2 of Table 1 that the contagion risk in the German interbank market is concentrated\naround four banks. In particular, the top three banks stand out. Based on the BSLoss the top three banks\nare almost equally important for the German banking system with regard to interconnectedness. In fact,\na default of one of these three banks results in a subsequent default of the remaining two banks due to\ntheir high level of interconnectedness.9 On the contrary, the failure of the sixth most interconnected bank\n9This fact explains why the BSLoss nearly equals for this group of banks. Note that the BSLoss measures the\nwould cause less than a tenth of the loss that the failure of one of the three most dangerous institutions\nwould cause. In the same vein, the failure of the 20nd most dangerous bank is estimated to lead to less\nthan one percent of the loss induced by one of the three most dangerous banks. From this we conclude\nthat the contagion risk in the German interbank network is rather concentrated.\nTable 1: Ranking according to BSLoss in descending order\nTotal effect Indirect effect Unconditional effect\nRank\nBSLoss\ni\nBSLoss\nK\nDF\ni\nDF\nBSLoss\ni\nj Wji\nBSLoss\ni\nBSLoss\ni\nDF\ni\nDF\ni\nPD0(i)\u00b7BSLoss\ni\nNote: The first column displays the rank of the bank according to the BSLoss in descending order. Column 2\nshows BSLoss for the respective bank as a fraction of the BSLoss of the highest ranked bank (bank 1). The third\ncolumn lists the round at which the contagion algorithm stopped (ie the number of iterations). Column 4 indicates\nhow many institutions failed during the contagion process following the failure of the relevant bank as a fraction of\nthe number of failures caused by the default of bank 1. Column 5 expresses BSLoss in relation to the total amount\nof loans which the respective bank received from other banks. Column 6 displays the BSLoss from rounds two to\nK (that is the second and later round effects) as proportion of the total BSLoss. Column 7 gives the percentage\nof defaulting banks in rounds two to K with respect to the total number of defaulting banks. Column 8 displays\nthe unconditional effect (BSLoss weighted with the respective bank's PD) as fraction of the bank with the largest\nvalue (bank 2 in this scenario).\nAnother noteworthy observation which can be deduced from column 6 of Table 1 is that the losses\nare borne mostly by counterparties' counterparties, rather than the first round direct counterparties, in\ncase one of the more \"interconnected\" banks fails. That is, the indirect effect of contagion for rounds\nk  2 is much bigger than the direct contagion effect of round k = 1. From this we conclude that\nit is crucial to account not only for direct exposure but rather the entire network when evaluating the\ninterconnectedness of banks. So far, the indicator-based methodology of the Basel Committee to deter-\nmine the interconnectedness of domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) only accounts for direct\nreduction in Tier1 of the creditor banks due to a credit deterioration of their debtor banks. In case the creditor\nbanks default, they still have to account for additional Tier1 loses due to a subsequent credit deterioration of their\ndebtor banks, ie we allow for negative Tier1 levels.\nexposure.\nColumn 8 of Table 1 shows the unconditional contagion effect, which reflects the BSLoss weighted\nby the initial PD of the bank subject to shock A. According to this measure the ranking of the top 20\nbanks does not materially change compared to the ranking based on the unweighted BSLoss. Following\nthe expected BSLoss the contagion risk in the German interbank market is concentrated around the top\nfive banks. This group of top five banks includes the same banks as the group of top five banks according\nto the BSLoss (see column 2).\nAs a plausibility check, we compare the ranking derived from BSLoss to rankings obtained from\nother, established measures of interconnectedness. To this end, Table 2 displays the Spearman's rank\ncorrelation coefficient  between our ranking derived from BSLoss and the following rankings: First,\nthe total score of the indicator-based methodology of the Basel Committee to determine D-SIBs. This\nmethod comprises four different dimensions: size, interconnectedness, complexity and substitutability.\nSecond, the sub-score for interconnectedness of the D-SIBs score, which is mainly based on the volume\nof interbank loans. Third, the rank correlation with the Bonacich centrality measure. This eigenvector-\nbased measure takes into account the entire network structure of the interbank market. Following\nNacaskul (2010), we weight the adjacency matrix with the corresponding interbank matrix. Fourth,\nthe number of loans to each bank. The results in Table 2 show that the more established rankings are\n(highly) correlated with ours derived from BSLoss.\nThe relatively low positive correlation between the D-SIBs' interconnectedness ranking and ours can\nbe explained by its broader scope, as it takes into account not only interbank exposure but also exposure\nto the non-bank financial sector. It might, however, also point to the importance of counterparties'\ncounterparties, which is captured in our ranking. The high correlation with the Bonacich eigenvector-\nbased centrality measure emphasizes that the BSLoss shares the same merits in terms of using the\ninformation of the whole network. In addition, BSLoss also takes into account the interbank loan\nquality and the inherent relationship between the PD of the debtor bank and the PD of the creditor bank.\nMost importantly, in contrast to the more established rankings, BSLoss provides policy makers with an\neconomic interpretation.\nTable 2: Rank correlation between BSLoss and other measures of interconnectedness\nD-SIBs D-SIBs Bonacich In-Degree\n(Total score) (Intercon.) centrality measure\nThe table displays the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient  between BSLoss and the following four mea-\nsures: 1) ranking based on the methodology of the Basel Committee to determine domestic systemically important\nbanks; 2) the part of the former measure which captures interconnectedness; 3) the -centrality measure developed\nby Bonacich and Lloyd (2001) and 4) the in-degree.\nAs a robustness check for the specification of our logit regression, we now estimate the relationship\nbetween PD and capital ratio with additional control variables. Following Craig, K\u00f6tter, and Kr\u00fcger\n(2014), we add Tier 1 capital over RWA, depreciation and adjustments over equity, administration ex-\npenses over total assets, return on equity, cash and overnight interbank loans over total assets and the\nlog of total assets. These variables follow the CAMEL approach and reflect capital adequacy, asset\nquality, quality of management, profitability, and liquidity as well as size. Further, we include banking\ngroup dummies and regional dummies. The estimated coefficients show the expected signs and can be\nfound in Table 3. Most importantly, the Tier 1 capital ratio is significant at the 1% significance level and\n^\n = -2.01. Consequently, a higher capital ratio significantly reduces a bank's PD.\nTable 4 in the Appendix 6 is the equivalent to Table 1 and displays an excerpt of the results for the\ntop 20 banks whose default cause the largest BSLoss. While BSLoss of most banks are very similar using\neither one of the beta coefficients, most importantly, the BSLoss ranked as bank 1 and 2 are 14 and 12\ntimes higher using the beta of the multivariate regression. This sharp increase is due to the cliff effect\ninherent in our algorithm whenever a bank fails and stresses the importance of robustness checks in a\npolicy context. Excluding those two banks, the BSLoss for the remaining top 20 banks is only 0.2%\nhigher when using the alternative beta coefficient. Further, almost the same group of banks forms the top\n20 banks in the two tables, except for the identities of bank 14 and 18 in Table 4 and for the the identities\nof bank 17 and 18 in Table 1, which are not included in the other tables. Similar to the results in Table 1\nwe can observe from column 6 of Table 4 that the indirect effect of contagion for rounds k  2 is much\nbigger than the direct contagion effect of round k = 1.\nHaving determined the importance of banks in terms of their interconnectedness, we will now sim-\nulate the benefits of a policy intervention. We found that the risk of contagion is rather concentrated\non five banks in the network. Therefore, we analyze by how much the BSLoss is reduced if a capital\nbuffer for the most important banks (SIFI-buffer) is introduced. To do so, we follow the methodology\noutlined in Subsection 3.3. To each of the five most interconnected institutions we assign more capital\nsuch that the new capital ratio is 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 or 3 percentage points higher than the initial one. We\nthen repeat the previous analysis and let each of the SIFIs fail in turn. We find the buffers to be largely\nineffective in curbing contagion among SIFIs. The BSLoss is reduced significantly only if the buffers\nexceed 2.5pp. In the case the buffers amount to 3.0pp, the BSLoss of two of the five most interconnected\nbanks is substantially reduced in each case by 21% and their expected BSLoss is reduced by 42% and\n45% respectively. However, the BSLoss of any of the other three banks is not considerably reduced by\nthe policy intervention, although their expected BSLoss is reduced by 8%, 17% and 18% respectively.\nThe aim of the SIFI-buffers is to increase the shock-absorbing capacity of the identified SIFIs, so that\nthey are less likely to default if they are hit by a shock. We conclude that the buffers are not high enough\nto prevent the other SIFIs from failing in case that one of the SIFIs fails, if the buffers are capped at\n4.3 Shock to the real estate sector\nThe burst of a house price bubble was at the center of the last financial crises and others before. Therefore,\nour second application of the algorithm is a scenario analysis of the consequences of a decline in real\nestate prices. Using our algorithm, we determine how this shock is propagated and amplified by interbank\nlending. In a first step, we calculate the banking system loss caused by such a decline in real estate prices.\nIn a second step we assess the benefit of a policy intervention.\nWe proxy a decline in house prices by an increase in the loss that banks incur if a mortgage is not\nrepaid, ie the loss given mortgage default. We argue that if a mortgage defaults and house prices have\ndropped, banks are left with a house whose value has declined. In that way, a decrease in house prices\ntranslates into higher LGDs of mortgages, LGDMg. The increase in the loss given mortgage default then\ninfluences the values of Tier 1 capital and the RWAs due to accounting rules and risk management prac-\ntices and, consequently, decreases the capital ratio of each bank which has an exposure to the mortgage\nsector. Bank i's exposure to the mortgage sector is denoted by Mgi. Each institution exposed to the real\nestate sector will then also experience a rise in its PD as a consequence of the decline in its capital ratio.\nThe rise in bank's PDs triggers the credit quality contagion spiral in the interbank market. We use our\nalgorithm to compute the banking system loss from contagion caused by a real estate shock modeled as\nfollows:\nThe shocked balance sheet items at k = 1 are given by\nTAi,1 = TAi,0 - LGDMg \u00b7 PDMg \u00b7 Mgi\nTier1i,1 = Tier1i,0 - LGDMg \u00b7 PDMg \u00b7 Mgi\nRWi,1 = RWMgi(PDMg, LGDMgi, 1)\nCapRati,1 =\nNote that LGDMg \u00b7 PDMg \u00b7 Mgi = 1i and RWi,1 \u00b7 Mgi\n= 2i in our algorithm and S contains all\nbanks for which Mgi > 0. In these formulae the linearity of risk weights in the LGD is exploited. The\nformula for the computation of risk weights for exposures to retail costumers can be found in Appendix\n6. As a relevant aspect of this computation it has to be noted that the residual maturities for residential\nmortgage loans are assumed to be 1 year, ie M = 1, in the Basel capital framework. Based on supervisory\nreports for a representative selection of German banks, the probability of default for mortgage loans is\nFigure 3: Initial shock, direct and indirect contagion for different LGDMg\nThe figure shows different specifications of the banking system loss for different changes in the loss given mortgage\ndefault. It shows the loss from the total effect including the initial shock and contagion (BSLoss0,K\nMg\n), the loss\nfrom direct and indirect contagion (BSLoss1,K\nMg\n) and the loss from indirect contagion only (BSLoss2,K\nMg\n).\nFigure 3 illustrates the banking system loss for different loss given mortgage defaults. The evolution\nof BSLoss as a function of LGD is not smooth, but follows a pattern with alternating sharp and\nmoderate increases. This shape of the function results from the dynamic of the defaults. A small increase\nin LGD may result in an abrupt increase in BSLoss in the event that higher losses cause bank failures.\nThe figure is quite revealing for policy makers. Comparing BSLoss1,K\nMg\n(the gray and dark gray\narea) with BSLoss0,1\nMg\n(the light gray area), we find that across the different scenarios for LGDMg\n(aggregated) contagion effects from interconnectedness are nearly as high as the (aggregated) initial loss\ndue to the macroeconomic shock. In other words, the losses to banks' counterparties (and counterpar-\nties' counterparties) are nearly as high as the losses realized by banks on their own mortgage portfolio.\n10Another interesting application would be to shock the PDMg instead of the LGDMg.\nMoreover, we find that the direct contagion losses (gray shaded area) are almost always higher than the\nlosses from indirect contagion (dark gray area). Obviously, the costs of the shock triggered by the real\nestate sector depend on its size. For a 15pp change in the loss given mortgage default, the initial loss to\nthe banking system is A\nC2.02 billion and the loss due to contagion is A\nC2.04 billion. This amounts to both\naround 0.50% of the accumulated banking system capital.\nSubsequently, we assess the effectiveness of capital surcharges, the so-called systemic risk buffer, to\ncurb contagion from the mortgage sector to the interbank market. Before any shock hits the system, all\ninstitutions are forced to increase their capital ratio by the variable  relative to their exposure to the real\nestate sector. Banks have to comply with this requirement by increasing their Tier 1 capital accordingly:\n=\nMgi\n,\nwhere Tier1R\ndenotes the Tier 1 capital that banks hold after the regulatory intervention. As a result,\nthe new Tier 1 capital ratio translates into a decrease in a bank's own PD which we use as the starting\nPD in the algorithm; see Subsection 3.3 for more detail. To evaluate the effectiveness of the systemic\nrisk buffer, we compare the banking system loss for   {1, 2, 3} to the banking system loss without\nregulatory intervention,  = 0.\nFigure 4: Illustration of different scales of policy intervention for several shock scenarios\nThe figure illustrates the level of BSLoss1,K\nMg\nfor different changes in loss given default. The different shaded areas\nindicate the BSLoss for different degrees of regulatory intervention, ranging from no regulatory intervention,\n = 0, to an increase in the capital ratio of  = 3 relative to banks' exposure to the real estate sector. Note that\nMg\nmeasures loss due to contagion within the banking system, excluding the direct adjustments due to\nthe initial real estate shock.\nFigure 4 illustrates the level of BSLoss for different changes in loss given default and different de-\ngrees of regulatory intervention. The buffers effectively absorb the macroeconomic shock and reduce\ncontagion if they are set adequately. Consider, for example, a rise in the loss given default of 15pp.\nGiven an intervention of  = 1, the banking system loss can be reduced by roughly C0.99 billion and\nfor an intervention of  = 2 by an additional C0.85 billion. In relative terms, a policy intervention of\n = 1 will mitigate the consequences of the exogenous shock in the system by almost 50% compared\nto the situation without regulatory intervention. A stronger intervention of  = 2 reduces the scale of\nconsequences for the system by a total of 91%. In contrast, a systemic risk buffer of 3pp barely adds any\nadditional benefit. The banking system loss can be reduced only by C3 million compared to the level\nreached by a risk buffer of 2pp. We conclude that the systemic risk buffers can effectively reduce the\nlosses from contagion if they are chosen well. Given a certain stress scenario, our framework leads itself\nto such calibration.\n4.4 Discussion of the model and the results\nWhen working with a complex, non-linear network system, we have to make simplifying assumptions\nand make some choices on our parameters. In this section, we briefly discuss these choices and possible\nconsequences or extensions.\nIn our model, we assume that banks know when their counterparties are hit directly or indirectly by\nan adverse shock and, as a result, account for the increased credit risk in their credit portfolio instantly.\nThis does not imply that each bank has complete information about the entire network structure, but that\neach bank has complete information about the credit quality of its direct counterparties, and accounts\nany credit deterioration immediately. However, in reality, this adjustment process tends to occur with\nsome time lag \u00ad it might be the case that shocks are covered up and adjustments in the balance sheet take\nlonger in the beginning. But sooner or later the bank's credit portfolio will be reassessed and changes in\nexpected credit losses will be crystallized.\nWe take the simplifying assumption of a static network structure. In reality, network structures may\nchange while a shock propagates through the banking system. While this certainly leaves room for future\nresearch, we argue that lending relationships, at least in the German banking system, are usually long\nlasting and are likely to be stable in the short run. It is more likely that banks will change their (long-\nrun) lending and borrowing habits in response to a policy intervention, exposing our policy evaluation\nto the Lucas critique. In order to assess the usefulness of additional capital buffers to reduce contagion,\none could take into account the cost of capital surcharges in terms of reduced lending, as was done by\nKashyap and Stein (2004). If a SIFI-buffer is imposed, banks might try to reduce their centrality or\nimportance as lender and borrower in the network in order to reduce their surcharge. If systemic risk\nbuffers for the mortgage sector are imposed, banks might reduce their exposure to the real estate sectors.\nIn both cases, contagion to the analyzed shock is reduced. In that way, the benefit of regulation that we\ncompute is a lower bound and might be bigger once we account for a change in banks' behavior.\nOur algorithm is very flexible in the way a shock can be introduced. It is possible to shock one single\nbank, a set of banks or all banks at once. Variables which might introduce the shock range from banks'\nTier 1 capital over risk weights up to LGDs and banks' PDs. Therefore, a sophisticated risk analysis can\nbe used in order to identify relevant shock scenarios and feed them into the proposed algorithm. Besides\nthe chosen shock scenario, the results of the model also depend on other parameter choices which affect\nthe persistence and severity of the contagion process. For example, changes in LGDs or the critical values\nof the default criteria (CapRatcrit or Levcrit) may result in jumps in BSLoss if these changes alter the\nnumber of defaulting banks (\"cliff effect\"). In order to take this into account, a sensitivity analysis with\nrespect to the chosen parameters is important in a policy context.\nDue to data availability restrictions, we use data on the German banking system only. In order\nto get a more complete view, it is certainly desirable to include cross-border lending and borrowing\nrelationships. On a similar note, the framework can be extended to assess the interconnectedness within\nor across financial networks, such as the insurance sector or the shadow banking system. In this case,\nhowever, the propagation mechanism needs to be modified since the Basel framework does not apply\nto non-bank financial institutions, accounting rules vary and the relationship between other types of\nfinancial intermediaries may be substantially different. Nevertheless, the Macroeconomic Assessment\nGroup on Derivatives (2013) led by the BIS has applied a comparable methodology to identify changes\nin the probability of a crisis in the OTC-Derivatives market. Finally, the model is restricted to one\ncontagion channel (interbank lending). One extension could be to combine other contagion channels (eg\nthe liquidity channel) into the model to better measure systemic risk.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper we develop an analytical framework to quantify the cost of contagion in the interbank mar-\nket. Our contagion process which we term the credit quality channel has several merits. It is modeled in\na more realistic fashion because it does not rely on \"true\" defaults, as does a domino default mechanism.\nRather, it is responsive to small changes in credit risk brought about by an increase in the likelihood of\nbank defaults in the future (over a 1-year time horizon). In addition, we propose a metric termed BSLoss\nwhich estimates the potential regulatory capital loss to the banking system due to contagion via interbank\nloans. This measure is expressed in a monetary unit and is therefore easy to interpret. This framework\nis useful in the context of macroprudential surveillance, instrument calibration and policy evaluation.\nWe demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm in two examples: we compute the contagion costs\nassociated with a single bank failure as well as with a shock to the real estate sector.\nWhen working with a complex, non-linear network system, we have to make simplifying assump-\ntions. For example, we take the simplifying assumption of a static network structure. While this certainly\nleaves room for future research, we argue that lending relationships are usually long-lasting and are likely\nto be stable in the short run. It is more likely that banks will change their (long-run) lending and bor-\nrowing habits in response to a policy intervention, exposing our policy evaluation to the Lucas critique.\nWe argue that the resulting change in the network is likely to reduce contagion even further, causing the\nestimated benefit of the policy intervention to possibly underestimate the real benefit.\nOur model can easily be refined, adjusted and extended to different policy questions and different\nregulatory environments. For example, one could analyze the effect of a capital buffer which is propor-\ntional to each bank's exposure to the most contagious banks. Apart from a reduction in BSLoss, this\nwould also give an incentive to be less connected to the most contagious banks, transforming the net-\nwork and making it less prone to contagion. Further, policy makers could use their stress tests to identify\nrelevant macro shocks and feed them into our algorithm to analyze contagion in the interbank network.\nWe see this flexibility as a virtue of our algorithm.\n6 Appendix\nA1: Calculation of risk weights, Tier 1 capital and total assets\nRisk weights are calculated using the IRB formula\n)\n- PD\n\u00b7\n(PD) =\nThis formula applies to risk weight for the Banks, Sovereigns and Corporates exposure classes.\nFor exposures to retail borrowers a slightly different formula applies. Instead of a PD-dependent asset\ncorrelation a constant asset correlation of  = 0.15 is used.\nExpected losses are deducted from the Tier 1 capital. The expected loss of bank i on the interbank\nloan W granted to bank j in round k equals\nELi,k = Wij \u00b7 PDk(i|A) \u00b7 LGD.\nAccordingly, the Tier 1 capital in k + 1 which has changed due a change in the PD of the debtor bank j\nin the previous round amounts to\nj\n(ELi,k - ELi,k-1)\n= Tier1i,k -\nj\nWij \u00b7 LGD \u00b7 (PDk-1(j|A) - PDk-2(j|A)).\nTotal assets are calculated net of LLAs. Under IAS 39 LLAs reflect incurred losses. That means\nLLAs can only be recognized if there is objective evidence that a loss event has been incurred (eg 90\ndays past due). A PD of one is assigned to loans which are subject to a loss event. That means in the\ncontext of the expected loss approach the LLAs under IAS 39 would be calculated only for defaulted\nloans (PD = 1) and simply reflect LGD times EAD. However, two types of LLAs exist: specific\nLLAs, where the loss event has been incurred and identified (and consequently a PD of one has been\nassigned to the defaulted loan), and general LLAs, where the loss event has been incurred, but has not\nbeen identified yet (and consequently a PD of one has not yet been assigned to the loan). Against this\nbackground a common practice among banks is to calculate the general LLAs for all the loans where\na loss event has not been identified using the 1-year expected loan loss, ie LGD times exposure times\n(1-year) PD.\nWe follow this approach and assume LLAs can be described approximately by the 1-year expected\nloan loss based on regulatory risk parameters.11 Hence, the loan loss allowance charged to bank i on the\n11Under the new International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 9, banks will have to calculate LLAs for\nexpected loan losses instead of actual loan losses. The new standard will come into effect on 1 January 2018\n(with early application permitted). According to this standard, depending on whether there has been a significant\nincrease in the credit risk, the lifetime expected loan loss or the 1-year expected loan loss is taken into account\nto measure LLAs. Hence, factoring IFRS 9 into our model would require a modification by taking into account\ninterbank loan W granted to bank j in round t equals to\nLLAi,k = Wij \u00b7 PDk(i|A) \u00b7 LGD.\nAs a result, the total assets in k + 1 which have changed due to a change in probability of default of the\ndebtor banks j amounts to\nTAi,k+1 = TAi,k -\nj\n(LLAi,k - LLAi,k-1)\n= TAi,k -\nj\nWij \u00b7 LGD \u00b7 (PDk-1(j|A) - PDk-2(j|A)).\nA2: Logistic regression\nIn order to estimate the effect of a change in a bank's capital ratio on its probability of default, we run\nthe following logistic regression:\nPDi,t =\ne+\u00b7ln(CapRati,t-1)+Xi,t-1\n.\nwhere PD is the probability of default, CapRat is the capital ratio and X is the matrix of control\nvariables. In order to know by how much the probability of default changes if the capital ratio changes,\nwe take the derivative:\ndPDi,t\ndln(CapRati,t-1)\n= \ne+\u00b7ln(CapRati,t-1)+Xi,t-1\n=  \u00b7 (PDi,t - PD2\ni,t\n).\nRearranging terms gives\ndPDi,t =  \u00b7 (PDi,t - PD2\ni,t\n) \u00b7 dln(CapRati,t-1) (5)\nor, equivalently,\ndPDi,t\nPDi,t - PD2\ni,t\n=  \u00b7 dln(CapRati,t-1).\nFormula (5) is referred to in the main text because it reveals monotonicity properties of the PD as\na dependent function of the capital ratio of the previous period. Eg the PD is monotone decreasing for\nnegative .\nTaking into account that dPDi,t\nPDi,t(PDi,t-1)\n= ln PDi,t\n+c, with a constant c, and applying simple\nrules for the logarithm, we obtain\nln\nPDi,t\n=  \u00b7 (ln(CapRati,t) - ln(CapRati,t-1)) + ln\n.\nPutting both sides of this equality into the exponent of the ex-function, rearranging terms and applying\nlifetime PDs or 1-year PDs on a case-by-case basis.\nrules for the logarithm once more gives\nPDi,t =\nCapRati,t\nCapRati,t-1\n1 + CapRati,t\nCapRati,t-1\nIn the table below, we present the estimated coefficients of the logistic regression which we use in\nour policy application.\nTable 3: Regression results\nunivariate multivariate\nPDi,t\n= F( + caprat\n\u00b7 ln(CapRati,t-1\n\u00b7 Zi\n)\ndepreciation & adjustments/equity -0.001\ncash & overnight interbank loans/TA 0.031***\nNotes: F(z) = ez/(1 + ez) is the cumulative logistic distribution. Our unbalanced panel consists of 10, 159\nequals one if the bank defaults and zero otherwise. Distress events are systematically recorded by the German\ncentral bank, Deutsche Bundesbank. There are six different types of distress events that are drawn from the German\nBanking Act (\"Kreditwesengesetz, KWG\"), see also Kick and Koetter (2007). The first three are early indications\nof potential future problems: annual operating profit contractions in excess of 25 percent, losses of 25 percent\nof regulatory capital or above requiring a notification of the regulator according to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd24(1) KWG, and general\nnotifications by banks that the existence of the bank might be at risk in line with \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd29(3) KWG. Additional distress\ncategories are capital injections received by banks from sector-specific insurance funds, restructuring mergers and\nrevocations of a charter by a moratorium. We control for banking group as well as regional effects. Standard errors\nare given in parentheses and the 1% and 5% significance levels are indicated by *** and **, respectively.\nA3: Robustness check for the specification of our logit regression\nTable 4: Ranking according to BSLoss in descending order\nTotal effect Indirect effect Unconditional effect\nRank\nBSLoss\ni\nBSLoss\nK\nDF\ni\nDF\nBSLoss\ni\nj Wji\nBSLoss\ni\nBSLoss\ni\nDF\ni\nDF\ni\nPD0(i)\u00b7BSLoss\ni\nNote: The first column displays the rank of the bank according to the BSLoss in descending order. Column 2\nshows BSLoss for the respective bank as a fraction of the BSLoss of the highest ranked bank (bank 1). The third\ncolumn lists the round at which the contagion algorithm stopped (ie the number of iterations). Column 4 indicates\nhow many institutions failed during the contagion process following the failure of the relevant bank as a fraction of\nthe number of failures caused by the default of bank 1. Column 5 expresses BSLoss in relation to the total amount\nof loans which the respective bank received from other banks. Column 6 displays the BSLoss from rounds two to\nK (that is the second and later round effects) as proportion of the total BSLoss. Column 7 gives the percentage\nof defaulting banks in rounds two to K with respect to the total number of defaulting banks. Column 8 displays\nthe unconditional effect (BSLoss weighted with the respective bank's PD) as fraction of the bank with the largest\nvalue (bank 2 in this scenario).\nA4: Academic example\nWe assume an interbank lending market where each bank is connected to all other banks. Three banks\nbilateral exposures are given by the following matrix\n\n\n\n.\nTable 5 displays the BSLoss metric for different levels of shocks and over various rounds. From\nthe results it can be seen that BSLoss is monotonically increasing in . BSLoss has a discontinuity in\nthe interval between  = 670 bp and  = 671 bp. Above this threshold the default of banks leads to\na jump in the PDs and in BSLoss. Any additional increment exceeding that shock level does not lead\nto a further increase in BSLoss. Notably, an additional increase in the initial shock would only imply\nthat these banks default in an earlier step of the iteration, leaving the overall BSLoss unchanged. The\nsequences of the PDs for different levels of the shock  are shown in Figure 5.\nTable 6 displays BSLoss for different initial PD vectors and over various rounds if a shock ( = 500\nbp) has hit one bank. From the simulation results it can be seen that, for low levels, an increase in\ninitial PDs results in higher BSLoss due to the logarithmic relationship between CapRat and PD.\nHowever, BSLoss jumps in the interval (750bp, 751bp). The default of one bank implies the default\nof the two other banks in the system and results in an abrupt increase BSLoss. Interestingly, any\nadditional increment exceeding that level of the initial PD vector does not lead to a further increase\nin BSLoss, but actually a decrease. Given that the PDs are bounded by 1, any additional increase in\ninitial PDs (ie PD0  751 bp) results ceteris paribus in a smaller jump in stressed PDs and hence a\ncorresponding reduction in BSLoss. The development of stressed PDs depending on the level of initial\nPDs is illustrated in Figure 6.\nTable 5: Development of BSLoss for different shocks over the rounds of the algorithm\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFigure 5: Development of the banks' PDs for different shock sizes\nTable 6: Development of BSLoss for different values of the initial PD vectors\nRound PD0 =\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nFigure 6: Development of the banks' PDs for different values of the initial PD vectors\nReferences\nAcemoglu, D., A.
