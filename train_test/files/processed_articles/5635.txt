Despite\nperceptively synthesizing and diagnosing a host of issues and assumptions that plague the leadership industry, Kellerman's\nargument is flawed in two substantial, overlapping ways. First, the argument is decidedly grounded in modernity, despite\nthe obvious evidences of a postmodern critique. Second, although the impact of technology and culture are likely correctly\nidentified as significant, analysis explicating why these altered views about leaders facilitated a redistribution of power is\nunattended to. Therefore, the current work argues that The End of Leadership compellingly diagnoses the condition of the\nleadership industry via an incomplete lens. Therefore, three counterthemes are offered to compliment and nuance Kellerman's\nargument: first, an understanding that technologies alter epistemologies; second, an analysis of the assumptions tethered to\nthe epistemologies of modernity; and third, that individual and collective worldviews have changed as a consequence of the\nepistemological shift of postmodernity.\n",

This disenchantment, coupled with the all\ntoo frequent news reports concerning unscrupulous leaders\nand their actions, appear to have set the stage for a turning\npoint in the study, reflection, and development of leaders.\nIn The End of Leadership, Kellerman (2012) attempts to\nidentify and analyze the status of the leadership industry,\nwhich Kellerman identifies as a \"catchall term for the now\ncountless leadership centers, institutes, programs, courses,\nseminars, workshops, experiences, trainers, books, blogs,\narticles, websites, webinars, videos, conferences, consul-\ntants, and coaches\" (p. xiii). This is necessary because\nwhile the leadership industry has been thriving--growing and\nprospering beyond anyone's early imaginings--leaders by and\nlarge are preforming poorly, worse in many ways than before,\nmiserably disappointing in any case to those among us who once\nbelieved the experts held the keys to the kingdom.

The finished product serves as a call to reevalu-\nate and critically appraise many of the assumptions that\nobfuscate the contemporary study of leadership and the\ndevelopment of effective leaders by reorienting and engag-\ning the changes that have occurred. Kellerman astutely\nobserves that cultural changes, shifts in power from leaders\nto followers, and technology have been the precipitating\ncauses for the recent changes in leadership. These observa-\ntions and the overarching concepts, varied contexts, and his-\ntoricity of consequential leadership theories provide a\nmeta-analysis that should prove useful for scholars and prac-\ntitioners as they engage and encounter the realities so clearly\ndescribed. And yet the causes identified and the lens utilized\nin this lucid narrative warrants further discussion.\nEven though it appears Kellerman (2012) has fittingly\nsynthesized and diagnosed the climate and effects influenc-\ning the leadership industry, it would seem that this analysis\nand the subsequent discussion are flawed in two substantial,\noverlapping ways. First, the lens utilized is decidedly\ngrounded in the epistemological and ontological assump-\ntions of modernity, despite the obvious evidences and glaring\nrealities of postmodern influences. Second, although the\nimpact of technology and culture are correctly identified as\nfactors, the discussion fails to interact with and discuss the\nreasons these changes have influenced and continue to influ-\nence views about leaders and the redistribution of power.\nEssentially, Kellerman analyzes and isolates present day\nrealities for leaders and their organizations correctly via an\nincomplete or, at the very least, an underdeveloped lens.\nThis incomplete lens does not constitute a wrong analysis,\nfar from it; rather, it reveals and highlights underdeveloped\ncausal identifications. For example, technology itself did not\ncause power to shift from leaders to followers; rather, tech-\nnology, in this instance, transformed and transforms individ-\nual and collective worldviews, which has altered and\ncontinues to alter conceptions of leadership and power.\nLikewise, the epistemological and ontological assumptions of\nmodernity, which are the assumptions undergirding Western\nuniversities, function as the presuppositions that color and\ninform a majority of scholars and academic inquiries, includ-\ning, but certainly not limited to, Kellerman's (2012) critique\nand analysis. What is missing from Kellerman's work is\nthreefold: first, an understanding of the epistemological shift\nthat was caused by a growing awareness of the other via tech-\nnology; second, that individual and collective worldviews\ninform the perceptions of both leaders and followers and that\nsuch views have changed as a result of this epistemological\nshift; and third, an analysis that acknowledges, at the very\nleast, its own tethering to the epistemologies of modernity.\nTherefore, the theory of postmodernity as an epistemological\nshift will be applied to Kellerman's analysis, assumptions,\nand conclusions. To accomplish this, we first turn to the over-\narching narrative of Kellerman's synthesis and argument and\nbriefly discuss Kellerman's explicit assumptions and the\nchanges prescribed to right the leadership crisis. We then turn\nour attention to postmodernity as an epistemological shift and\ndiscuss in detail epistemological shifts and the effects on indi-\nvidual and collective worldviews. From this framework,\nimplicit assumptions inherent to Kellerman's work are dis-\ncussed in light of postmodern epistemology and a critique is\noffered based upon the framework and suggestions set out as\nremedies for the study of leadership. But first, let us begin\nwith an overview of The End of Leadership.\nOverarching Narrative of Kellerman's\nArgument\nThe End of Leadership tells \"two tales,\" the first is about lead-\nership and change and the second is about the leadership\nindustry itself (Kellerman, 2012, p. xx). Both tales are rela-\ntively well developed; however, for our purposes, we will\nconcentrate primarily on the former. A fairly insightful intro-\nduction sets the stage for the book's relevance to the study of\nleadership and assists the reader in conceptualizing the piece's\noverall argument and organization. The introduction begins\nwith an identification of many of the issues that plague lead-\nership studies and the leadership industry, of which each are\nquickly refuted and discussed in detail as her argument pro-\ngresses. Primarily, the issues are mistaken assumptions, such\nas conceptualizing leadership as static, that leadership can be\ntaught and taught to anyone quickly and easily, that context is\nof secondary importance, and that leaders should be the cen-\ntral focus as they are more crucial than followers. These\nassumptions are refuted via the organization and development\nof Kellerman's argument, which is grounded in her historiog-\nraphy of leadership as trajectory. This trajectory presupposes\nthat \"since the time of the Enlightenment, because of the\nEnlightenment, the weak increasingly challenged the strong\"\n(p. xvii). And yet this assumption is held in tension with, and\nnot clearly delineated from, the identification that the 1960s\nand 1970s accelerated such challenges and resulted in a far-\nreaching, global redistribution of power in which the power\nof leaders waned while the power of followers increased.\nAlthough we will discuss these assumptions later, at this junc-\nture, it is essential to note that this forms the backbone of\nKellerman's argument. This historical trajectory identifies\ntwo additional assumptions unattended to by the leadership\nindustry, namely, followers and cultural context.\nKellerman's (2012) historicity concerning the develop-\nment of leadership forms a foundation in which to build upon\nthe cultural and technological changes that significantly\naffected leadership and perceptions concerning leadership.\nThese changes, although not fully explicated or carefully dis-\ncussed in light of the wider academic literature available out-\nside of the study of organizational leadership, suggest that\nthe leadership industry has been and is neglectfully compla-\ncent concerning these changes and, in particular, the ways in\nwhich culture and context have altered the balance of power\nbetween leaders and followers.\nWhat, then, can we conclude about the historical trajectory? We\ncan say what we have seen: that over the course of human\nhistory, power and influence generally have devolved from the\ntop down. Still, for whatever reasons, the leadership industry\nignores this critical history nearly entirely, as if it were irrelevant,\nor unimportant, or maybe both. One of the several inevitable\nresults is that leaders continue to be overvalued and followers\nundervalued. The same can be said of the contemporary\ncontext--which remains similarly underappreciated and poorly\nunderstood. This deprivation serves no one, least of all those\nlearning how to lead. (p. 23)\nA trenchant critique justifying an assertion posited in the\nintroduction that leaders, followers, and context should each\nbe conceived of as equally important. This reorientation\naway from a leader-centric focus is a reoccurring theme\nthroughout The End of Leadership and is further bolstered\nvia discussions concerning the increased interconnectedness\nof people globally and a shift in the social contract between\nleaders and followers.\nKellerman (2012) utilizes the lens of evolutionary leader-\nship theory to demonstrate that the social contract between\nleaders and followers has changed from self-interest to merit.\nAgain, according to Kellerman, this change occurred because\nthe assumptions on which the contract is based have changed,\nfirst, because the old justifications for having power, authority,\nand influence are no longer so persuasive, and second, because\npeople in the present think of themselves as more important,\nmore entitled, than did people in the past. (p. 70)\nThe consequence of which rendered followers more likely to\njudge leaders upon two criteria: effectiveness and ethics.\nThese criteria and this change in social contract were has-\ntened by technology, which further solidifies her argument\nthat the interconnectedness of a globally related world iden-\ntifies another example of the leadership industry's failure to\nadopt to this \"new and changed social contract\" (p. 149).\nQuite simply, Kellerman's analysis is that the leadership\nindustry has failed to account for, interact with, and engage\nthese issues, which form the assumptions that \"underpin the\nleadership industry\" (p. 190).\nThe Changes Prescribed to Right the Leadership\nCrisis\nDespite the failure of the leadership industry to recognize its\nown myopic self-justification, Kellerman (2012) provides\nseveral general correctives: developing a greater expertise as\nit pertains to contextual intelligence, developing a global\nfocus with attention to global and local complexities,\nemploying a far more critical analysis of leadership studies\nand leader development, and broadening education for both\nleaders and followers that incorporates interdisciplinary\nstudy. Certainly, these remedies would address the assump-\ntions identified by Kellerman. A greater understanding and\nengagement with contextualization would greatly lessen the\nmyopia of a field of study that fails to incorporate the numer-\nous overlaps in the humanities and may serve to guard\nagainst self-serving study and application, including, but not\nlimited to, cultural influences. Expanding one's purview to a\nglobal focus in the midst of the obvious sociological and\npolitical changes that have occurred since the 1960s and\n1970s should ensure, at the very least, a more effective\nengagement with the issues and complexities that global\ninterconnectedness have spawned in the wake of an ever-\nclosing global village. Developing a willingness and tools to\ncritically analyze the leadership industry through contextual-\nization and a broader focus should enable useful analysis that\nlimits or, at the very least, challenges myopic tendencies.\nAnd finally, providing interdisciplinary education that con-\nsiders the complexities and interactions of both leaders and\nfollowers, as well as nuanced understandings of power and\ncontext, would likely address many of the observations that\nare identified as contributing to the leadership crisis.\nThese remedies, although seemingly appropriate and well\narticulated, fail to adequately account for or identify the fac-\ntors that precipitated the leadership crisis. Without identify-\ning and discussing the reasons for these effects, remedies\nsuch as these remain untethered to the actual phenomena that\ninstigated the crisis. Certainly, Kellerman (2012) identifies\ngeneralities, but her analysis and remedies fail to adequately\nwrestle with and incorporate a framework that explicates the\ncultural and technological changes that have spurned indi-\nviduals toward a general distrust of their leaders and the rea-\nsons why power has shifted from leaders to followers. It is to\nthis neglect that we now turn; to accomplish this, a momen-\ntary diversion is needed to provide a foundational under-\nstanding of postmodernity, epistemology, and worldviews to\nelucidate this study's interpretation and critique of\nKellerman's analysis and remedies.\nThe End of Leadership Through a\nPostmodern Lens\nas a significant watershed in the cultural and historical devel-\nopment of the West. Cultural theorists from a plethora of dis-\nciplines attribute a variety of explanations for these changes,\nbut most frequently, postmodernity is conceptualized as the\nconsequence of the widespread disillusionment of the 1960s\nS\u00f8rensen, 2007). The effects of this disillusionment are all\nencompassing as postmodernity \"is no marginal phenome-\nnon, not something happening on the fringe[s] of society;\nrather, it is penetrating whole cultures, a paradigm shift con-\nsciously and subconsciously transforming commonly\naccepted habits, notions, and patterns of thoughts in its wake\"\nconsciously and subconsciously penetrates whole cultures is\n4 SAGE Open\nbecause postmodernity is best understood as an epistemologi-\ncal shift affecting individual and collective worldviews\nPostmodernity as an Epistemological Shift\nPostmodernityisnotoriouslydifficulttodefine.Postmodernity\nis often narrowly defined based exclusively upon postmodern\nphilosophers and theorists such as Jacques Derrida (decon-\nstruction), Michel Foucault (discourse analysis), Richard\nRorty (neopragmatism), Thomas Kuhn (paradigm theory),\nand others who have attempted to \"uncover the historical and\ncultural relatively of knowledge, the hidden agendas of power\nbehind scientific discourses and tried to replace metaphysics\nand ontology with linguistics and constructivism\" (Walldorf,\n2010, p. 6). Certainly, postcolonial criticism and postmodern\nphilosophies and theories have affected both the academy and\nthe wider public; however, it is unlikely that these are the sole\ndriving force of a paradigm shift that is consciously and sub-\nconsciously penetrating whole cultures. Rather, the wide-\nspread disenchantment in response to the failed promises of\nmodernity more readily defines postmodernity as a reaction\nagainst the assumptions and presuppositions inherent to\nIyadurai, 2010). To understand postmodernity then, one must\nwrestle with this pervasive disillusionment concerning the\nassumptions and presuppositions of modernity, that is,\nepistemology.\nEpistemology.Epistemology, generally, is \"an account of\nmology as the theory of knowledge, which is driven by two\nmain questions: \"What is knowledge and how can we know,\"\nand \"if we think we can know something, as nearly everyone\ndoes, then a third main question arises: how do we know what\nwe know?\" (p. 1). Epistemology is therefore a dynamic con-\ncept because human beings have understood knowledge--\nhow it is identified, communicated, and justified--in different\nways at different times in history. Three eras of epistemology\nare typically identified: premodern, modern, and postmodern\n(Corfield, 2010). However, using the term \"eras\" requires\nclarification. First, the following depictions are not without\nbias. The author of this work has been shaped by many of the\nexplicit and implicit philosophic, historic, religious, and cul-\ntural assumptions of the West. Therefore, the following dis-\ncussion should not be conceived of as comprehensive\nmetanarrative of global history but rather as a narrative\nshaped by Western, Eurocentric influence(s). Second, eras of\nepistemology are not neatly divided epochs in which one era\nends and the next begins; rather, significant overlaps occur\n(Corfield, 2010). The current work will therefore avoid estab-\nlishing neatly divided epochs as there is little agreement con-\ncerning the symbolic moments that mark the transition\nbetween epistemological eras and assumes that premodern,\nmodern, and postmodern epistemologies informed and inform\nindividual and collective worldviews and that these influ-\nences are not uniform but affect individuals differently, in a\nvariety of ways, and continue to do so today.\nThe premodern era is often characterized as the time\nbefore modernity in which the authority of rituals under-\ngirded the ways in which knowledge was identified, com-\nmunicated, and justified.\nMost people in the human past knew who and what they were,\nnot by precept or as a conclusion to an analytical discussion, but\nby constant, daily experience and reinforcement. Social stability\nand immobility combined (mostly) with relative geographical\nrootedness to place to produce stable and, above all, unreflective\nsense of selfhood. Indeed it was this which traditional religions\nboth celebrated and reinforced. Religious ritual tells you . . . who\nyou are and what it is that you are a part of, whilst investing the\nwhole with significance by rooting it in the transcendent.\nThe stability of one's identity through religious ritual would\nbe significantly challenged by the epistemological influences\nThe modern era is often identified as beginning with the\nEnlightenment, the industrial revolution, and European colo-\nnialism and is characterized by \"the belief in the power of\nreason, progress, and the potential of the scientific method to\nsolve hitherto intractable human dilemmas\" (Balia & Kim,\nthrough reason, observation, and experiment,\" and once\nknown, it is applicable to all people as a metanarrative\nTypical for modernity is the grand narrative, a project designed\nto convince everyone of the truth of a particular vision or theory\nabout historical development, as for example the cases of the\nSocial Darwinist belief in the superiority of the white race [or]\nthe nation state as the sole legitimate foundation for a political\nframework, Liberalism, Communism or Nazism as superior\npolitical ideologies, Deism or Atheism as the most rational\nworldview, or perhaps even the assumptions of some variations\nof Christian mission that the Christian faith is the most advanced\ncreed and has produced the highest civilization so it needs to be\nspread throughout the whole world.

This transformation \"from theocentrism to human-\nism is a Copernican revolution that radically changes the\nway modern humans view the world\" (p. 149). From this\nCopernican revolution emerged the doctrines of liberty and\nequality and the elevation of science as the sole arbiter of\ntruth. Education, therefore, is also elevated and serves as the\n\"most important legitimating agency of modernity\" (p. 194),\nin which utopia was attainable simply by \"illuminating igno-\nrance, removing errors and increasing knowledge\" (p. 203).\nScientific domination of nature promised freedom from scarcity,\nwant, and the arbitrariness of calamities. The development of\nrational forms of social organization and rational modes of\nthought promised liberation from the irrationalities of myth,\nreligion, superstition, release from the arbitrary use of power as\nwell as the dark side of our natures. Only through such a project\ncould the universal, immutable qualities of all of humanity be\nIn the beginning of the 1960s, there was an optimism that\ndevelopment would right the wrongs of the world and that\nscience would prevail in making life better for all people.\nAccording to Nash (1975), \"the widespread trust in scientific\nhumanism\" was \"one of the striking features of the opening\nyears of the decade\" (p. 16). Yet despite this widespread\ntrust, as the 1960s progressed, a crisis emerged.\nThe social, intellectual, religious crisis of the 1960s was specific\nto no one particular religious tradition, nor to any one part of the\nworld. More widely still, it was not even a specifically religious\ncrisis, it was rather one of total culture, affecting many secular\ninstitutions in a way comparable to its effect on the churches. It\nwas a crisis of the relevance (or capability for sheer survival) of\nlong-standing patterns of thought and institution of all sorts in a\ntime of intense, and rather self-conscious, modernization.\nThis crisis of relevance of longstanding patterns of thought\nand institution of all sorts is a crisis of epistemology, which\nis demonstrated by developments within technology, travel,\nand communications, the growing recognition of global plu-\nrality and diversity, and the failure of science to solve human-\nity's problems.\nTechnology incited the social, intellectual, and religious\ncrisis of the 1960s. Advances in technology, communication,\nand travel challenged epistemological frameworks in a vari-\nety of contexts. Brown (2000) identifies the wide-reaching\nimpact that technological and communicative changes had in\nInternational telecommunications, pioneered by the Telstar\nthe hippie \"summer of love\" in California. Between March and\nAugust of the following year, it provided coverage of the major\npolitical touchstones of the decade: the Prague Spring, the\nCultural Revolution in China, the May revolution in Paris and\nother cities, and, from America, the Civil Rights movement, the\nanti-Vietnam war movement and the Democratic Convention\nNumerous radio stations and \"the vinyl record . . . displaced the\nprinted word as the key method by which young people formed\n\"technology and the knowledge explosion [which] produced\nfacilities for communication which are among the most influ-\nential factors in the contemporary world\" that caused \"vast\ndevelopments in the organization, expression, and transmission\nresulted in changes in the ways in which human beings orga-\nnize, express, and transmit knowledge, which is, quite simply,\na shift of epistemology. Just as the printing press reinforced the\nepistemological presuppositions of modernity, so did advances\nin technology, travel, and communications reinforce the episte-\nmological presuppositions of postmodernity.\nPostman (1987), in his book Amusing Ourselves to Death,\nidentifies that technological developments change human\ndiscourse and therefore alter epistemology. Postman\nattempted \"to show that definitions of truth are derived, at\nleast in part, from the character of the media of communica-\ntion through which information is conveyed . . . [and] how\nmedia are implicated in our epistemologies\" (p. 17). Postman\nconvincingly argues that \"most of our modern ideas about\nthe uses of the intellect were formed by the printed word, as\nwere our ideas about education, knowledge, truth, and infor-\nmation\" (p. 29). Surely, television, international telecommu-\nnications sustained by satellites, the global availability of\ntransistor radios, and vinyl records corroborate Postman's\nattempt to \"show that in the twentieth century, our notions of\ntruth and our ideas of intelligence have changed as a result of\nnew media displacing the old\" (p. 26).\nVast improvements in travel and communication further\nchallenged the epistemological boundaries of modernity by\nfacilitating opportunities for relationships and interactions\nover vast distances. Individuals who traveled by jet airplane\nor received information from radio and television were chal-\nlenged by the sheer magnitude of global diversity. Up until\nthe 1960s, many intellectuals in the West, who were undoubt-\nedly heavily influenced by modernity, advocated science as a\nidentifies \"science as the most dynamic cultural force in the\nworld\" (p. 19). But people became disenfranchised, for a\nvariety of reasons, with the failures of the scientific world-\nview, that is, modern epistemology. Before the end of the\nThe triumphalism of the scientific worldview has been badly\nshaken in our time by unexpected ecological backlash, by the\ndestructive effects on traditional cultures, by awareness of the\nfood and resource shortages and their consequences for\ndevelopment; and many people are newly aware that the sciences\ndo not by themselves provide a coherent picture of the human\nThis new awareness that the sciences do not provide a coher-\nent picture of the human future is also evident in Bosch's\n6 SAGE Open\n(1991) observation that \"since the `secular sixties' more and\nmore scholars have been writing on the resurgence of a tran-\nscendent longing that is both open to spiritual insight and\ncritical of science as an adequate means of knowing\"\n(p. 476). The gross injustices of power and its use throughout\nthe world would also serve as \"a great disillusionment\" and\nthis distrust of authority and power becomes one of the defin-\nmodern epistemology that undergirded the emphasis on sci-\nentific development would, in the end, prove untenable. It\nwas because of this disillusionment, the growing awareness\nof global diversity, and the developments within technology\nthat postmodernity emerges in the 1960s.\nThe postmodern era is often associated with the 1960s\nand is characterized by diversity and plurality. Bloom (1987),\nin The Closing of the American Mind, identifies the emer-\ngence of this challenge by simply stating that \"Enlightenment\nin America came close to breathing its last during the sixties\"\nSome modern cultural theorists . . . argue that the 1960s was a\nkey decade in ending \"the Enlightenment project\" and modernity.\nIn its place, the era of postmodernity started to mature. Structural\n\"realities\" of social class eroded, and there was a repudiation of\nself-evident \"truths\" . . . a new skepticism about the science-\nderived nature of \"progress,\" and the disappearance of an agreed\n\"reality.\" Science, social science and Christianity were equally\nThe reason that all were equally victims is because all faced\nthe new, and developing, epistemological challenge of post-\nmodernity. Unlike the boundaries and dichotomies prevalent\nin modernity, postmodernity recognizes diversity and plural-\nity as normative and finds claims of universal truths, such as\nmetanarratives, unlikely. Metanarratives are associated with\ntheir use in modernity as facets of power and control; there-\nfore, postmodernity is often described by its rejection of the\n2007). Knowledge for the postmodern can come from a vari-\nety of sources, yetall sources are viewed with skepticism.\nThis is exacerbated by the recognition of and interaction with\nglobal diversity, is reinforced by technology, and, as has\nalready been suggested, is indicative of an epistemological\nshift that has been and is affecting individual and collective\nworldviews.\nWorldviews.Worldview is a particularly troublesome term\nbecause of the liberty with which it is used in mass media,\npopular culture, and various disciplines within the academy.\nThe origin of the term stems from the anthropological study of\ndiverse people groups globally. Hiebert (2008) observes that\n\"anthropologists empirically studied peoples around the world\nand found deep but radically differing worldviews underlying\ntheir cultures\" (p. 14). Consequently, worldviews represent the\nfoundational presuppositions that inform individual and\ncollective understandings about reality and the ways in which\npeople see the world they live in. Sire (2004) clearly illustrates\nthe complexities and nuances of the term by defining world-\nviews as \"a set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be\ntrue, partially true or entirely false) which we hold (con-\nsciously or subconsciously, consistently or inconsistently)\nabout the basic makeup of our world\" (p. 19). Worldviews,\ntherefore, provide the plausibility structures to the ultimate\nquestions of life, validate cultural norms, help to integrate cul-\ntural change, and provide reassurance that the world is as one\nbelieves it to be (Hiebert, 2008). Although some disagreement\nsurrounds which worldview presuppositions are the most fun-\ndamental, scholars generally identify epistemology as particu-\nsurprising, then, that shifts of epistemology substantially affect\nindividual and collective worldviews and, consequently,\nculture.\nThe three epistemological eras defined above, premodern,\nmodern, and postmodern, all demonstrate two substantial\nshifts within individual and collective worldviews. The shift\nfrom premodernity to modernity is widely regarded as \"one\nof the great worldview shifts in history\" (Hiebert, 2008,\np. 17). Premodern worldviews are generally conceived of as\nbeing geographically oriented to the local village in which\nrituals and oral communication are justified by the religious\nleader via the authority of the god(s). Modernity challenged\nthese assumptions via an epistemological shift, in large part,\ndue to the printing press, the reorientation of individuals to\nthe nation-state, the invention and use of caravel ships (ca.\n1450), which were used by the Portuguese and Spanish to\ntravel to the west coast of Africa and the Americas, and a\nreconceptualization of the social contract, based in no small\npart to the \"sea change\" brought about by the work of Thomas\nHobbes in his reorientation \"from those with power, to those\nwithout, particularly regarding their right, our right, to life\"\n(Kellerman, 2012, p. 9). Modern worldviews are generally\nconceived of as being geographically oriented to the nation-\nstate in which written and printed communication are justi-\nfied by state officials, leaders, and/or scholars via the\nauthority of \"facts\" as identified by science, the university,\nthe nation-state, and/or an organization.\nPostmodernity further challenged these assumptions via\nanother epistemological shift brought about by vast changes\nin communication, including telephones, transistor radios,\ntelevision, satellite communication, and the Internet; a reori-\nentation of individuals away from individualism and the insu-\nlarity of the nation-state to the interconnectedness of a global\ncommunity; advances in travel, most notably the jet aircraft\nand the ever-increasing accessibility of air travel; and a fur-\nther reconceptualization of authority, based in no small part to\nthe failed promises of modernity (French & Ehrman, 2016).\nPostmodern worldviews should be generally conceived of as\nbeing geographically oriented to a myriad of diverse commu-\nnities globally and locally, in which a plethora of electronic\nand nonelectronic mediums are available and in which the\nindividuals, and often their communities, justify knowledge\nthrough a variability of authorities (e.g., state officials, lead-\ners, and scholars; but also relationships in community, social\nmedia, personal feelings, experience, and spiritual experi-\nence). The epistemology informing a postmodern worldview\nassumes that knowledge is subjective, that it may or may not\napply to all people, and that knowledge and the nature of its\ncommunication and justification are a mechanism of power\nand are generally distrustful of authorities and the sources\nthat modernity recognized as authoritative, that is, state offi-\ncials, leaders of all types, and scholars. This epistemological\nshift from modernity to postmodernity is all encompassing\nand has influenced and informed individual and collective\nworldviews in varying degrees globally (French & Ehrman,\n2016). It is this shift that the technological and cultural\nconceptualizing postmodernity as an epistemological shift\nthat Kellerman's assumptions and remedies are found to be\ninsightful but incomplete.\nKellerman's Assumptions, Critiques, and\nPostmodernity\nKellerman (2012), to her credit, correctly identifies aspects\nof these changes. First, technology is identified as monu-\nmentally important in the crisis of leadership via a brief dis-\ncussion concerning the printing press, the disillusionment of\nthis time period. Second, there is recognition that cultural\nchanges and technology have affected cultures globally,\nwhich is closely related to a third identification that these\neffects are related and therefore demonstrate a multicultural\nhistorical and sociopolitical development. And finally, that\neducation is the answer to the issues that face both the leader-\nship industry and the study of organizational leadership.\nAssumption 1--Technology caused the disempowerment of\nleaders. There is little doubt that changes in individual and\ncollective worldviews reconceptualized the authority in\nthe epistemological presuppositions of modernity elevated\nstate officials, leaders, and scholars as the authorities of\nknowledge. Certainly, technology challenged and provided a\nframework for an epistemological shift. However, it was the\nmultiplicity of changes, cultural shifts, increased global\ninteractions and recognition of interconnectedness, and the\ngeneral disillusionment with the promises of modernity that\naltered worldviews globally. The totality of these influences\ncreated significant skepticism concerning the communica-\ntion and justification of knowledge via a new awareness of\nthe power inherent to knowledge. This shift reconstituted\nepistemological justification from state officials, leaders, and\nscholars, again in large measure because of failed promises,\nto the individual. Therefore, failing to identify these\ninfluences, the epistemological shift that resulted, and the\neffect it has and is having on individual and collective world-\nviews worldwide wrongly associates movements and\nchanges in various contexts globally as a linear trajectory\nwithin the purview of development and progress from the\nWest.\nAssumption 2--Evolutionary development.Kellerman (2012)\nunabashedly conceives of the changes globally through the\ntheories of evolution, development, and progress both in the\nhistorical trajectory of leadership and in her estimation of\nglobal events as demonstrative of the leadership crisis. Such\nan assumption is particularly evident throughout Kellerman's\ndiscussion in Chapter 6 concerning the impact of global\nchange. Kellerman presupposes that \"the trajectory of history\nmoves generally in a single direction: toward democratiza-\ntion\" (p. 147). This underlying assumption explains Keller-\nman's uniform treatment of Russia and China in which both\nare described as having \"scant knowledge of democratic the-\nory and no experience with democratic practice\" but, never-\ntheless, having \"come very far very fast\" (p. 128). Treatments\nsuch as these fail to see the cultural nuances and complexities\nthat Kellerman herself later advocates as necessary for the\nstudy of leadership and the development of leaders. Further-\nmore, this discussion, as well as Kellerman's general interac-\ntion with many of the cultural contexts identified in Chapter\n6, fails to adequately address a plethora of presuppositions\nand intricacies that inform individual and collective world-\nviews and their unique historical and sociopolitical realities.\nKellerman (2012) fails to incorporate, interact with, or\ndiscuss a variety of influences that likely influenced, if not\ncaused, the various movements and events occurring in a\nvariety of global contexts. Exemplifying this, Kellerman\nsuggests that the events of Europe in 1989 and of the Middle\nEast in 2011 constitute a pattern, a pattern demonstrating \"a\nlink between past and present and between what happens in\none place and what happens in another\" (p. 149). Certainly,\nthere is an interconnectedness to such events. But were the\ncauses and complexities of the upheavals in Europe similar\nenough to the widespread protests in the Middle East to jus-\ntify the idea of a historical trajectory in which development\nis encompassed by the \"arc of history?\" (p. 149). Certainly\nnot. Rather, the events in the Middle East are complex and\nunique as compared with the events occurring in many other\ncontexts. Certainly, religious presuppositions, such as the\nIslamic belief of Dar-al-Islam, should be discussed as well\nas the effects of decolonization (Shenk, 2003).\nNash (1975) clearly encapsulates the global effects of\ndecolonization, \"in 1946 well over a third of the world's pop-\nulation was living in colonies ruled by western powers; but\nbetween then and the end of the 1960s almost all of these\npeople attained political independence\" (p. 236). These\nchanges had far-reaching consequences that substantially\ninfluenced and influence the realities for leaders and\n8 SAGE Open\nfollowers as well as contextually nuanced understandings of\npower and authority.\nPatterns of authority were being upsetalike in the intellectual\nrealm, in the familial-communal and in the political.\nAchievement of national if not of economic independence by\nsome six hundred million people in Asia, Africa and the\nCaribbean brought to an end the old imperial-colonial era.\nDecolonization is but one example of the complexities and\nnuances required when discussing leadership and follower-\nship,sociopoliticalrealities,andpowerglobally.Furthermore,\nawareness of such realities should cast significant doubt on\nthe explicit or implicit claims that the world continues to\ndevelop in a linear trajectory.\nAssumption\n3--These global changesconstitute moderniz-\ning. Modernity assumes a linear trajectory of development,\nprogress, and evolution. For example, despite recognizing\nthat Russia has not and most likely will not develop along the\nsame lines as the West, Kellerman (2012) suggests that \"Rus-\nsia's leaders are caught between modernity on the one\nhand--including rising expectations and growing demands--\nand chaos and repression on the other\" (p. 130). Such a\ndichotomous assumption fails to account for the vast reac-\ntions against the assumptions of modernity and the emic per-\nspectives by scholars in non-Western contexts who identify\nthe presence of premodern and postmodern assumptions and\nthe absence of modernity (Li, 2010). Simply, the assump-\ntions inherent to modernity fail to adequately interact with\nthe numerous complexities and histories that a diverse,\nglobal account necessitates. Postmodernity, however, refuses\nto conceive of either past or present realities as stemming\nfrom one center; rather, postmodernity is polycentric, recog-\nnizing a multiplicity of origins and the variability of direc-\ntions in both local and global contexts (Olsen & Ahlstrand,\nAssumption 4--Education is the answer.Wrestling with the\ninnumerable nuances and complexities of a globally inter-\nconnected world necessitates a multidisciplinary incorpora-\ntion of emic and etic perspectives from scholars from a\nvariety of contexts and specialties. As noted earlier, the uni-\nversity is the primary legitimizing agency of modernity, and\nit, like the leadership industry, is experiencing, or at the very\nleast being challenged by, the epistemological shift from\nmodernity to postmodernity. The assumptions of modernity\nhave led to an \"epistemological diminution that reduces\nknowledge to scientific knowledge, in this way forgetting\nthat at the core of knowledge we do not find the `experiment'\nbut the totality of human experience\" (Kim & Anderson,\nchallenged as the additions of qualitative and mixed-method\nresearch methodologies demonstrate. Furthermore, as our\nprevious quotations suggest, the sciences, social sciences,\nand humanities all have been challenged by this epistemo-\nlogical shift. This change of epistemology has challenged the\nfragmentary nature of the academy and its long-held empha-\nsis of specialization while neglecting, either intentionally or\nunintentionally, collaboration with other disciplines. As a\nresult, calls for interdisciplinary collaboration have increased\nglobally throughout the academy. Educators, not unlike those\nwithin the leadership industry, must examine, confront, and\ncritically appraise their own assumptions and biases, as they\nseek to engage the growing complexities of an intercon-\nnected world.\nCritique 1--Unexamined biases and assumptions.Kellerman's\n(2012) work is thoroughly grounded in the assumptions and\npresuppositions of modernity. Clearly, the historical devel-\nopment and trajectory of leadership and political thought is\nbased upon and grounded in the evolutionary and develop-\nmental assumptions of modernity, namely that human prog-\nress should alleviate unethical practices and ineffective\nleaders. Modernity is notoriously ineffective at setting or\nrighting moral and ethical agendas. Hiebert (2008) discusses\nthis at length and suggests that one of the reasons for the cur-\nrent crisis or disillusionment \"is that modernity said little\nabout ethics and the purposes for which knowledge, scien-\ntific or other, should and would be used\" (p. 215). Further-\nmore, the assumption that leaders and experts warrant\nauthority is legitimized upon the epistemological assump-\ntions of modernity and may help explain Kellerman's ten-\ndency to seemingly lament the shift in power from leaders to\nfollowers. And finally, Kellerman's interaction with and\nexplanation concerning multiple contexts globally is inher-\nently biased. To suggest that the democratizing trajectory of\nhuman history or that contexts as unique as Russia are con-\nfronted with modernity on one hand and chaos on the other is\nnothing less than a reductionistic logic informed by the epis-\ntemological presuppositions and homogenizing metanarra-\ntive of modernity.\nCritique 2--Incorporating interdisciplinary sources.Kellerman's\nwork is filled with topics and areas of study that other aca-\ndemic disciplines have and continue to study extensively. In\nfact, as may be observed from our discussion, the overarching\ntopic of disillusionment toward leaders can be examined\nthrough a variety of disciplines. Incorporating academic works\nfrom disciplines such as philosophy, religious studies, sociol-\nogy, and history in the areas of culture, cultural shifts, global-\nization, power, postcolonial studies, postmodernity, and\nworldviews would have provided a more robust and reflective\npicture of the many diverse sociopolitical and cultural realities\nattempted by Kellerman. Much of the current work is there-\nfore suspect from the first chapter to the conclusion as it lacks\nthe nuance and expertise in establishing the historical, cultural,\nand global arguments that provide the framework for Keller-\nman's overarching argument. Nevertheless, despite these\ncriticisms, The End of Leadership succeeds in its goal--the\ncall to overhaul the leadership industry and leadership\nstudies.\nConclusion\nKellerman (2012) should be commended for the extensive\nscope The End of Leadership attempts to encapsulate into a\ncall for the leadership industry to change with the changing\ntimes. It seems quite evident that this work is intended for an\naudience beyond the academy, and yet, the presentation for\nthe causes of the changes needed falls short of adequately\ndescribing the realities facing leaders, followers, and organi-\nzations. The work's most admirable quality, the width and\nbreadth in the attempt to interact with 2,000 years of leader-\nship thought and global contexts to explain the last 30 to 40\nyears, is overshadowed by a lack of specificity and question-\nable explanations concerning the global complexities and the\nways in which culture and technology influence leaders, fol-\nlowers, and organizations. Finally, the unexamined assump-\ntions and homogenizing application of theory neither\naccounts for nor explains the polycentric and varied direc-\ntionality the last 30 to 40 years warrant. Such a critique,\nstrangely enough, actually serves to validate a vast majority\nof Kellerman's observations and call.\nIndeed, a shift has occurred, and this paradigm shift is\npervasive, all encompassing and is affecting a myriad of cul-\ntures in a multiplicity of ways. Furthermore, technology and\ncultural shifts have played a role in the transfer of power\nfrom leaders to followers, but this occurred in conjunction\nwith disillusionment and global awareness, which deeply\naffected and affects individual and collective worldviews via\nepistemology. Individuals may or may not think of them-\nselves as more important: What is clear is that the individual,\nby himself or herself or within the bounds of the community\nidentified by the individual, serves as the epistemological\nauthority. This identifies and reinforces Kellerman's clear\nappraisal that recognition of and interaction with local,\nregional, national, and international complexities are neces-\nsary for the leadership industry to wrestle with and account\nfor. Education must include a multidisciplinary approach in\nwhich leaders and followers learn from and incorporate\ninsights and knowledge outside of the leadership industry\nwith a special focus toward contextualization and culture.All\nof this must be undergirded by a new willingness for critical\nassessment, especially, but not limited to, potential assump-\ntions that inhibit leaders, followers, and their organizations\nfrom effective leadership.\nAlthough The End of Leadership, in many respects, cor-\nrectly identifies the path forward for the leadership indus-\ntry, Kellerman essentially fails to apply these observations\nto her own work, in large part neglecting interdisciplinary\ncollaboration and critical analysis of her own biases and\nassumptions. Furthermore, the issues, assumptions, and\nremedies supplied to right the leadership industry are\nessentially an identification of the effects of the epistemo-\nlogical shift of postmodernity. An understanding of this\nepistemological shift, the growing awareness of the other\nvia technology, and disillusionment combined with the\nrecognition that individual and collective worldviews\ninform and reinforce conceptions of power and identity\naccentuate the necessity to understand and wrestle with the\ncomplexities of 21st-century realities. These realities dem-\nonstrate that the leadership industry must change with the\nchanging times, and to do so, it must examine its own\nbiases and assumptions; must learn and educate followers,\nleaders, and organizations to critically analyze the com-\nplexities of cultures and contexts globally and locally; and\nmust understand individual and collective worldviews to\nengage the multifariousness of the epistemological shift of\npostmodernity.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAhonen, R.
