The aim of this study was to investigate the association between MCI status and both performance-based and\nself-report measures of mobility in community-dwelling older adults.\nMethods. An analysis was conducted on baseline data from the Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study in the Elderly\nstudy, a cohort study of 430 primary care patients aged 65 or older. Neuropsychological tests identified participants with\nMCI and further subclassified those with impairment in memory domains (aMCI), nonmemory domains (naMCI), and\nmultiple domains (mdMCI). Linear regression models were used to assess the association between MCI status and mobil-\nity performance in the Habitual Gait Speed, Figure of 8 Walk, Short Physical Performance Battery, and self-reported\nLate Life Function and Disability Instrument's Basic Lower Extremity and Advanced Lower Extremity function scales.\nResults. Participants had a mean age of 76.6 years, and 42% were characterized with MCI. Participants with MCI\nperformed significantly worse than participants without MCI (No-MCI) on all performance and self-report measures (p <\n.01). All MCI subtypes performed significantly worse than No-MCI on all mobility measures (p < .05) except for aMCI\nversus No-MCI on the Figure of 8 Walk (p = .054) and Basic Lower Extremity (p = .11). Moreover, compared with aMCI,\nmdMCI manifested worse performance on the Figure of 8 Walk and Short Physical Performance Battery, and naMCI\nmanifested worse performance on Short Physical Performance Battery and Basic Lower Extremity.\nConclusions.Among older community-dwelling primary care patients, performance on a broad range of mobility\nmeasures was worse among those with MCI, appearing poorest among those with nonmemory MCI.\nKey Words: Cognition--Functional performance--Successful aging.\nDecision Editor: Stephen Kritchevsky, PhD\nFor community-dwelling older adults, both cognitive\nimpairments and mobility limitations are highly preva-\nlent and can interfere with the ability to maintain independ-\nent living (1\u00ad3). It is estimated that among adults aged 65 or\nolder, the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\nis between 10% and 20%, and the prevalence of mobility\nproblems is equally as high (4,5).\nMCI is defined as cognitive decline greater than that\nexpected for one's age and education level, but which\ndoes not interfere appreciably with daily function (5,6).\nMCI is a well-known risk factor for dementia (7,8), with\nan annual conversion rate from MCI to dementia around\n15% (8). Moreover, people with MCI are at increased\nrisk of mobility decline, falls, and institutionalization\nStudies evaluating gait parameters indicate that cognitive\nfunction and mobility are linked. In a review, Monterro-\nOdasso and coworkers (9) highlighted that many of the brain\nregions (eg, hippocampus) affected by cognitive impair-\nment also mediate aspects of mobility. It is also recognized\nthat altered mobility performance precedes the behavioral\nmanifestation of MCI (10). Therefore, mobility tests may\nserve as assessment tools for patients who either manifest,\nor are at risk for, developing cognitive impairment. A wide\nvariety of clinical tests evaluates mobility by physical\nperformance or self-report measures. However, few stud-\nies have contrasted how performance on these different\nmobility tests varies with MCI status and with specific\nMCI subtypes. One study that evaluated differences in gait\nanalysis findings among different subtypes of MCI found\nthat different gait parameters were associated with amnestic\nMCI compared with nonamnestic MCI (11). Also, among\nolder adults with MCI, executive function deficits are asso-\nciated with poorer mobility performance and future risk for\nfalls (12,13). By definition, nonamnestic MCI is largely\ninfluenced by executive function impairments, which sug-\ngests that these individuals may be at a heightened risk for\npoor mobility status and fall risk. Lastly, recent studies sug-\ngest that specific cognitive domains may be preferentially\ninfluential to specific mobility tests (14,15). However, these\nfindings did not account for MCI status.\nMCI is considered a subclinical state, which may remain\nunreported or undetected for a period of time. The first cli-\nnician to address these concerns is commonly the primary\ncare practitioner (8). If mobility tests are to be considered\nas screening tools for incipient cognitive impairment (eg,\nMCI), then it will be essential to better understand the asso-\nciation between cognitive status and mobility performance.\nAlso, it will be clinically important to evaluate these asso-\nciations within primary care settings. Thus, based on the\ncurrent evidence and the importance of screening for MCI\nwithin primary care settings, we investigated the associa-\ntion between cognitive function and mobility among older\nprimary care patients, and more specifically the association\nbetween mobility and both MCI and MCI subtypes. We\nhypothesized (1) that participants with cognitive impair-\nment, consistent with a diagnosis of MCI, would manifest\ngreater limitation in performance-based and self-report\nmeasures of mobility than participants who did not meet\ndiagnostic criteria for MCI (ie, cognitively intact); (2) that\nthese associations would be maintained for all MCI sub-\ntypes; and (3) lastly that participants with nonamnestic\nMCI would manifest worse performance than those with\namnestic MCI.\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nA cross-sectional analysis was conducted using base-\nline data collected as part of the Boston Rehabilitative\nImpairment Study in the Elderly (Boston RISE), a cohort\nstudy of 430 community-dwelling and independent ambu-\nlating primary care patients aged 65 or older. The Boston\nRISE methods have been described in detail elsewhere (16).\nBriefly, participants were recruited through primary care\npractices at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham\nand Women's Hospital, two large academic medical cent-\ners located in Boston, Massachusetts. Eligible participants\nwere identified through a Partners HealthCare patient data-\nbase and telephone screening interviews and were invited to\nan initial screening and assessment visit. Potential subject\nwere subsequently invited to undergo supplementary screen-\ning tests. Inclusion criteria were community-dwelling older\nadults, aged 65 or older, ability to understand and commu-\nnicate in English, and self-reported difficulty with walking\nhalf a mile (6 blocks) or climbing one flight of stairs (10\nsteps). Patients were excluded for the presence of a terminal\ndisease, significant visual impairment, uncontrolled hyper-\ntension, amputation of a lower extremity, use of supplemen-\ntal oxygen, myocardial infarction or major surgery in the\nprevious 6 months, planned major surgery, planned move\nfrom the Boston area within 2 years, cognitive impairment\nof significant severity as to likely reflect dementia (defined\nas Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] score <18)\n(17), and Short Physical Performance Battery [SPPB] score\nless than 4 (18). Recruitment was based upon U.S. Census\ndata 2000, to ensure an inclusion representing the ethnic,\nracial, and gender distribution of older adults residing\nwithin a 10-mile radius of our center. All of the methods of\nthe Boston RISE study were approved by the Institutional\nReview Board of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital.\nParticipants gave written informed consent before participa-\ntion, and study procedures were approved by the Spaulding\nRehabilitation Hospital Institutional Review Board.\nMeasures\nThe baseline assessments included a physical examina-\ntion, a medical history questionnaire, the Self-Administered\nComorbidity Questionnaire that assesses 13 comorbidities\nand has been validated for epidemiological trials among\nolder adults (19), demographics, neuropsychological test-\ning, physical performance testing, and questionnaires on\nfunctional ability.\nNeuropsychological tests were used to evaluate cogni-\ntive performance and to characterize participants with MCI.\nMoreover, MCI was further subclassified as impairment in\nmemory domains versus nonmemory domains using the\ncurrent framework on MCI (20). Both self-report and per-\nformance-based mobility measures were used to investigate\nthe association between MCI domains and mobility.\nCognitive measures.--Trail Making test.--The Trail\nMaking test is a well established reliable and valid assess-\nment of executive function that measures cognitive abilities\nof sequencing, visual scanning, processing speed, shift-\ning attention, and cognitive flexibility (21,22). The test is\nadministered in two parts, A and B, in which the participant\nis asked to connect circled numbers and letters. Both tests\nare sensitive to cognitive decline (21,22). Time to complete\neach test was recorded, and faster completion times indicate\nDigit Symbol Substitution test.--The Digit Symbol\nSubstitution test is a subtest of the Wechsler Adult\nIntelligence scale (23). The test is a measure of process-\ning speed and visual\u00adspatial skills, has an executive func-\ntion component assessing sustained attention, and has good\ntest\u00adretest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient =\n0.80) (21). The test consists of a series of numbers and\nMild Cognitive Impairment and Mobility 1513\ncorresponding symbols. The participant was asked to fill in\na response form with as many corresponding symbols to\nnumbers as possible in 90 seconds. The number of correct\nnumber\u00adsymbol matches was recorded with a higher score\nindicating better performance.\nHopkins Verbal Learning Test, Revised.--The Hopkins\nVerbal Learning Test, Revised (HVLT-R) is a valid test\nof verbal memory and learning (24). The test includes a\nlist of 12 words of concrete objects that are read aloud by\nthe examiner across three learning trials (25). The scores\nderived from the test are (a) total recall, the total number\nof words correctly recalled on trials 1\u00ad3; (b) delayed recall,\nthe number of words correctly recalled after 20\u00ad25 min-\nutes; and (c) recognition discrimination, the number of true\nresponses minus the number of false responses on a subse-\nquent recognition task (25). The HVLT-R is a valid instru-\nment for clinical and research-based neuropsychological\nassessment with elderly patients (24).\nMild cognitive impairment.--The identification of par-\nticipants meeting the diagnostic criteria for MCI was based\non performance on the neuropsychological tests. The raw\nscores of each test were converted into age-adjusted stand-\nardized scores (z scores) based on published normative\nstandardized scores allowed for comparisons across cogni-\ntive measures, cognitive domains, and across age groups.\nConsistent with previous studies, we used a cutoff of 1.5\nSD below the age-adjusted means to identify impaired\nperformance on a given cognitive measure (7,29). MCI\nwas defined as an impairment (ie, z < -1.5) on two sub-\ntests within the neuropsychological test battery (HVLT-R\ntotal recall, HVLT-R delayed recall, HVLT-R recogni-\ntion discrimination, Digit Symbol Substitution test, Trails\nA, and Trails B) (30). All participants were identified as\neither cognitively intact (No-MCI) or as having cognitive\nimpairment (MCI).\nMCI has been classified into two subtypes, amnestic\nand nonamnestic MCI, and further into single or multi-\nple domain categories (5,30,31). Amnestic MCI denotes\nimpairment within the cognitive domain of memory but\nnot of sufficient severity to meet the diagnostic criteria for\ndementia, accompanied by preserved executive function,\nattention, language, and visual\u00adspatial skills. In contrast,\nnonamnestic MCI denotes intact performance within the\ndomain of memory but with impairment in at least one of\nthe other cognitive domains (5).\nThe subtest scores of the HVLT-R (total recall, delayed\nrecall, recognition discrimination) were used to define mem-\nory impairment, and the subtest scores of the Trail Making\ntest and the Digit Symbol Substitution test (Trails A, Trails B,\nand Digit Symbol Substitution test) were used to define non-\nmemory impairment. Participants identified as having MCI\nwere classified into one of three groups as follows: (a) single\ndomain amnestic MCI (aMCI) if at least two tests within the\nmemory domain were impaired (ie, z < -1.5) and no other\ncognitive impairments were identified, (b) multiple domain\namnestic MCI (mdMCI) if memory and nonmemory domains\nwere impaired, or (c) nonamnestic MCI (naMCI) if two tests\nwithin the nonmemory domain were impaired (6,30).\nMeasures of mobility.--Habitual Gait Speed.--Habitual\nGait Speed (HGS) tested straight path walking and was meas-\nured by asking participants to walk a 4-m straight walk at their\nusual pace starting from a standing position (18,32). HGS is\na valid and reliable measure in community-dwelling older\nadults (33,34) and is predictive of disability and adverse out-\nm/s (substantial difference) (37).\nFigure of 8 Walk.--The Figure of 8 Walk (F8W) tested\ncurved path walking (38). Participants were timed while\nwalking in a figure of 8 pattern at their usual pace around two\ncones 1.5 m (5 feet) apart (39). The F8W has good test\u00adretest\nreliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84) and inter-\nrater reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.90) and\nis a valid measure of walking skills among older adults (39).\nShort Physical Performance Battery.--The SPPB is\na reliable and valid measure of lower extremity perfor-\nmance and predictive for subsequent disability, mortality,\nand institutionalization among community-dwelling older\nadults (18,32). The SPPB is a composite score of standing\nbalance, walking speed and the ability to rise from a chair.\nEach test is scored between 0 to 4 points with a maximum\ntotal score of 12. Clinically meaningful differences for the\nSPPB have been reported as 0.3\u00ad0.8 points (minimal differ-\nLate Life Function and Disability Index.--The Late Life\nFunction and Disability Index assesses functioning in a vari-\nety of daily activities (40) and is associated with performance-\nbased measures of function (41). The function component\nof the Late Life Function and Disability Index assesses self-\nreported difficulty in performing 32 physical activities. Scores\non the Late Life Function and Disability Index are transformed\nto scaled scores (0\u00ad100) with higher scores indicating better\nlevels of functioning (40). The subdomains of basic lower\nextremity (BLE) function and advanced lower extremity func-\ntion were used in this study. BLE consists of 14 items includ-\ning the ability to walk around the home, and advanced lower\nextremity consists of 11 items including abilities such as hik-\ning a few miles. The Late Life Function and Disability Index\nhas been validated in different cohorts of older adults (40\u00ad42).\nStatistics\nDescriptive analyses are presented as means with stand-\nard deviations for continuous variables and as frequencies\nand percentages for categorical variables. For determining\ndifferences between two groups (MCI vs No-MCI), the\nStudent's t test was used for normally distributed continu-\nous variables, the Mann\u00adWhitney U test for nonnormally\ndistributed continuous variables, and the 2 test for categori-\ncal variables. Associations between each mobility measure\nand cognitive status were examined by analysis of variance\nand analysis of covariance comparing MCI versus No-MCI.\nFirst, we adjusted for gender, race, and education. Second,\ncognitive status was entered into similar models as a cat-\negorical variable (aMCI, mdMCI, naMCI, and No-MCI),\nand estimates for differences in physical performance meas-\nures between all MCI categories were calculated. Goodness\nof fit was investigated and physical performance measures\nwere log-transformed where necessary. The F8W was\ntransformed, and transformation was successful in achiev-\ning a normal distribution. Coefficients from these models\nare given as back-transformed 2-coefficients. As part of a\npost hoc analysis, we also adjusted for current health sta-\ntus and chronic conditions. Also, in an additional analysis,\nwe included baseline MMSE status as a categorical variable\nto explore whether the distribution of low MMSE (MMSE\n< 24) significantly modified the association between the\nrespective MCI subtypes and mobility. An alpha value of\n0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Data\nwere analyzed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\nResults\nBaseline Characteristics\n7 years), two thirds were women, 16% had aMCI, 23% had\nmdMCI, and 4% had naMCI. Participants with MCI did\nnot differ from those without MCI according to age, gen-\nder, and body mass index (p > .05), but a significant differ-\nence was seen in race, education, and current health status,\nwhereby MCI was associated with poorer self-rated health\nMCI Versus No-MCI\nParticipants with MCI performed significantly worse in\ntests of mobility performance than participants without MCI\nand these relationships were unchanged after adjusting for\nsex, race, and education (p < .01; Table 2). Similar results\nwere observed in the associations of MCI with self-reported\nfunctional performance. Goodness of fit was acceptable for\nall measures except the F8W, which was log-transformed\nresulting in normally, distributed residuals.\nMCI Subtypes Versus No-MCI\nAll MCI subtypes performed significantly worse than\nNo-MCI on all mobility measures (p < .05), after adjusting\nfor gender, race, and education, except for aMCI, which did\nnot differ from No-MCI on F8W and BLE (Table 3).\nComparisons Between MCI Subtypes\nCompared with patients with amnestic MCI, those with\nnonamnestic MCI performed more poorly on a number of\nmobility tests, for example, the SPPB (p = .01) and BLE (p\n= .04), and borderline significance was seen in both walk-\ning tests, for HGS (p = .08) and F8W (p = .08). Similarly,\ncompared with patients with aMCI, those with mdMCI per-\nstatistically significant differences were observed between\nmdMCI and naMCI.\nAll multiple models were evaluated with the addition\nof current health status as an adjustment variable. The\nmajor findings were not materially altered; however, the\n-estimates were diminished, and the difference in BLE\nbetween aMCI and naMCI was no longer statistically sig-\nSimilar findings were observed after adjusting for chronic\nconditions instead of health status. Also, adjustment for\nMMSE categories did not materially alter our findings.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first investigation to com-\npare primary care patients with and without MCI across a\nbroad range of mobility measures. The major findings of\nour study are (a) patients with MCI manifested consistently\nworse mobility performance compared with those without\nMCI across both performance-based and self-report meas-\nures of mobility and (b) when evaluating patients by MCI\nsubtypes in relation to no MCI, these same associations\nheld, though important differences were observed with\nuse of certain mobility outcomes and among comparisons\nbetween certain MCI subtypes.\nOur findings are consistent with prior studies reporting\nassociations between MCI and gait speed (10,11) and add\nto the existing literature by showing associations between\nMCI and a broader range of mobility measures, including\nboth performance-based and self-report measures. The fact\nthat these relationships held within both performance-based\nand self-reported mobility outcomes is important as perfor-\nmance-based and self-reported functional measures have\nbeen demonstrated to assess different aspects of an individ-\nual's functioning (43). Interestingly, in differentiating MCI\nfrom No-MCI (Table 2), differences in HGS (0.12 m/s)\nand SPPB (1.35 points) surpassed clinically meaningful\nthresholds (37), which emphasizes the possible suitability\nof these measures as supplemental screening tools in MCI.\nClinically meaningful differences have not yet been defined\nfor F8W, BLE, and advanced lower extremity.\nIn general, subtypes of MCI performed worse than\nNo-MCI on most mobility measures. Moreover, consistent\nMild Cognitive Impairment and Mobility 1515\nwith the findings seen between those with and without\npoints) surpassed the threshold of clinical meaningfulness\nwhen comparing each of the subtypes of MCI to those\nwithout MCI. In addition, some of the mobility meas-\nures differed between specific MCI subtypes. Participants\nwith nonamnestic MCI performed significantly worse\non SPPB and BLE than participants with amnestic MCI.\nTable 1.

Results are given as 2\u00adcoefficients.\nFurther, participants with multiple MCI performed worse\non F8W and SPPB than those with amnestic MCI alone.\nThus, older persons with nonamnestic impairments, char-\nacterized by problems with processing speed and execu-\ntive function, performed worse on mobility measures\nincluding performance-based tests and self-report meas-\nures. These findings are consistent both with a study by\nBombin and coworkers (44), indicating that people with\nmultiple domain MCI are more impaired than those with\namnestic MCI and with prior studies linking executive\ndysfunction to disability (11,12,45). Also, in prior studies,\nF8W has been linked to visual scanning and set-shifting\nabilities (14) and HGS performance to executive function\n(9,12). These findings suggest that HGS and F8W may be\nlinked to distinct patterns of cognitive impairment. Also,\npoorer mobility among different MCI subtypes may be due\nto greater severity or different patterns of peripheral neu-\nromuscular impairments that underlie mobility. This was\ndemonstrated in an analysis of gait analysis parameters\nconducted by Verghese and coworkers (11). They found\nthat nonamnestic MCI was more related to gait parameters\nassociated with pace of walking, whereas amnestic MCI\nwas more associated with rhythm and variability param-\neters. Our study adds to this evidence by including a vari-\nety of both performance-based and self-reported mobility\ntests compared with a clinical assessment of one aspect\nof mobility, that being gait. An investigation of the sever-\nity and pattern of peripheral neuromuscular attributes, like\nthat performed by Verghese and coworkers, was beyond\nthe scope of this investigation but can be evaluated within\nfuture analyses of the Boston RISE cohort.\nOf note, those with naMCI reported poorer health sta-\ntus and manifested more chronic conditions than other\nsubtypes, which may explain their poorer performance.\nHowever, after adjusting for current health status, naMCI\nstill performed significantly worse than aMCI on the more\ncomplex performance-based mobility measure, SPPB, sug-\ngesting that part of the difference in performance between\nthe two groups is likely due to different cognitive deficits.\nOur results have important clinical implications. Within\na population-based study of community-dwelling older\nadults (26), the prevalence of coexisting cognitive impair-\nment and slow gait was 7%. Our findings suggest that the\nrate of cognitive impairment is much higher among primary\ncare patients undergoing screening for mobility problems.\nGiven the likely progression from MCI to dementia (8) and\nthe knowledge that coexisting cognitive impairment and\nmobility limitations increases the risk of institutionaliza-\ntion(3), early detection of these patients is critical for ini-\ntiating preventative and ameliorative therapies. One mode\nof therapy that can improve mobility is exercise and reha-\nbilitative care (46,47). However, patients with cognitive dis-\nabilities have commonly been excluded from large clinical\ntrials evaluating exercise or rehabilitative care as therapies\nfor preventing functional decline (47,48). Rehabilitative\nTable 3.

Therefore, rehabilitative care\nparadigms for older adults with mobility problems should\nbe developed that account for common types of MCI and\nthe specific cognitive deficits indicated.\nLimitations\nOur study is cross-sectional and therefore we cannot infer a\ncausal association between cognitive impairment and mobil-\nity limitations. Furthermore, the study was observational and\ntherefore we might have missed some confounders. However,\nthe estimates did not change meaningfully when adjusting\nfor known confounders. The standardized scores used in the\ndetermination of MCI were not adjusted for education, which\ncould influence the association between MCI and function.\nHowever, we did adjust for education in the multiple regres-\nsion analyses. Our sample size was small for some MCI\nsubtypes and corresponding analyses may not have been suf-\nficiently powered to observe true differences between these\ngroups. However, even given these small sample sizes, the\ndifferences between subgroups were statistically significant,\nand our hypotheses were predefined. Our study sample is rep-\nresentative of older adults, who had at least some evidence of\nmobility problems and were living within a 10-mile radius\nof our center, and may not generalize to older adults residing\nin other regions. It is possible that our sample included some\nindividuals with mild dementia. However, we attempted to\nscreen out those with moderate to severe dementia by using a\nMMSE cut point of 18 and our entry criteria required partici-\npants to have the ability to live and function independently\nin the community. Moreover, when adjusting for MMSE as\npart of a post hoc analysis, the findings were not materially\naltered, suggesting the burden of cognitive impairment had a\nminimal influence on the findings. Lastly, the neuropsycho-\nlogical battery utilized was circumscribed and did not evalu-\nate other aspects of cognition that may be relevant to mobility\n(ie, visuoconstructional skills). Thus, there is the possibility\nthat some individuals were misclassified with regard to MCI\nsubtype. Despite these potential limitations, our study pro-\nvides a unique contribution to the literature because of its\ndesign within primary care and use of a broad range of clini-\ncally feasible mobility measures.\nConclusions\nAmong older primary care patients, performance on a\nbroad range of mobility measures is associated with MCI\nstatus.
