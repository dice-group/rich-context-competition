Hammill:\nThe potential for grandparents to have frequent,\nface-to-face contact with their young grandchildren\nis probably greater today than at any previous time\nin history (Uhlenberg & Kirby, in press). Moreover,\nnational studies of intergenerational relationships\nrepeatedly find that most grandparents do have fre-\nquent contact with at least some of their grand-\nchildren (Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1986; Gravenish &\ntheless, these studies also reveal substantial varia-\nbility among grandparents in level of involvement\nwith their grandchildren. At the extremes, some see\ngrandchildren daily whereas others have no contact.\nThis article uses data from a large, national survey to\nexamine several critical variables predicting whether\ngrandparents have either frequent or infrequent con-\ntact with various sets of their grandchildren.\nA new study is not needed to establish that geo-\ngraphic distance is a strong predictor of frequency of\nintergenerational contact. Every study that includes\na measure of distance finds that the closer grandpar-\nents live to grandchildren, the more likely they are to\nvisit frequently (Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1986; Hodgson,\nsame studies have established that the quality of the\nrelationship between grandparents and their chil-\ndren (G1-G2) is related to the frequency of contact\nbetween grandparents and their grandchildren (GI-\nGS). Past research has not, however, provided clear\nand/or consistent findings regarding the role of a\nAddress correspondence to Peter Uhlenberg, PhD, Department of\nSociology, CB #3210, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel\ndepartment of Sociology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.\nnumber of other potentially interesting variables. The\nlack of clear findings is because most studies are based\non small and/or nonrepresentative samples (Aldous,\ntative sample of more than 4,600 grandparent-grand-\nchild set dyads, we are able to more carefully assess\nthe impact of factors that potentially make a differ-\nence in frequency of contact.\nBackground\nOn the basis of previous theoretical and empirical\nstudies of intergenerational relationships, there are a\nnumber of variables that might be expected to influ-\nence the frequency of contact between grandparents\nand grandchildren. We will group these variables in\nseveral categories: opportunity variables; gender/family\nvariables; and sociodemographic variables.\nOpportunity Variables.--Geographic distance is\nthe most obvious factor influencing opportunity for fre-\nquency contact. Both the time and expense of main-\ntaining frequent face-to-face contact increase as dis-\ntance between grandparents and grandchildren\nincreases. As already noted, studies routinely find dis-\ntance to be by far the strongest of all predictors of\ncontact.\nA second variable affecting opportunity for fre-\nquent interaction is the number of grandchildren an\nolder person has. Given that time and resources are\nlimited, one might expect that as the number of\ngrandchildren increases, the opportunity for grand-\nparents to have frequent contact with any particular\ngrandchild would decrease. Although this is a plausible\nhypothesis, little empirical attention has been given\nto the effects of number of grandchildren. In this study,\nwe focus not on individual grandchildren but on\ngrandchild sets. A grandchild set is defined as the\ngroup of children (G3) living in the household of a\ngrandparent's (G1) child (C2). Thus, the number of\ngrandchild sets will vary depending on how many\nchildren (C2) with children (G3) in their households a\ngrandparent has. Each grandparent-grandchild set\ndyad is examined separately, and the effect of num-\nber of grandchild sets on frequency of visiting with a\nparticular grandchild set is determined. This focus on\ngrandchild sets provides a useful approach to study-\ning involvement of grandparents with their grand-\nchildren, although it cannot be used to explore some\ninteresting facets of the relationship. For example,\nusing this approach, the role of such individual grand-\nchild characteristics as age and gender cannot be\nexamined directly.\nTwo additional variables may affect opportunity\nfor frequent contact, although previous research has\nnot found them to be significant (Cherlin & Fursten-\nberg, 1986). Grandparents' health status could plau-\nsibly be a factor if poor health limits mobility. How-\never, because the most impaired grandparents, those\nliving in nursing homes, are excluded from our sample,\nthis is not expected to be an important variable. The\nother variable, labor force status of the grandparent,\nalso could have an effect on frequency of contact,\nassuming that those in the labor force have less time\navailable for visiting.\nGender/Family Variables.--No discussion of grand-\nparenthood in America should omit consideration\nof the role of gender. The importance of gender in\nkinship relationships was stressed by Alice Rossi\nwhen she wrote, \"As childrearers, caregivers, and kin\nkeepers, women provide the glue that holds family\nHagestad (1986) made a similar point when she\ndiscussed the kin-keeping role of women and the in-\ncreasing \"female axis\" of intergenerational rela-\ntionships. In considering how gender might affect\nfrequency of contact between grandparents and sets\nof grandchildren, both the grandparents' sex and the\nlineage of the grandchildren may be important.\nGiven the kin-keeping role of grandmothers, we ex-\npect they will have more frequent contact with\ngrandchildren than do grandfathers. And if the female\naxis of intergenerational linkages is most important,\nwe would expect greater contact between maternal\ngrandparents and grandchildren than between pater-\nnal ones. Several studies have supported this hypoth-\nesis (Gravenish & Thomson, 1996; Roberto & Stroes,\nthat several other studies report that frequency of\ncontact was not associated with gender of the grand-\nparent and that there was no significant difference\nbetween maternal and paternal grandparents (Cherlin\nIt is expected that marital status will be a significant\npredictor of frequency of contact with grandchildren\nfor grandfathers. It is clear that divorced older men\nhave far less contact with their adult children than\nmarried ones (Cooney & Uhlenberg, 1990). Further,\nwidowed grandfathers may have less contact with\ntheir grandchildren than married ones because they\nlack a wife to facilitate the maintenance of close kin-\nship ties. Marital status of grandmothers also may\nbe significant in some cases, either because lack of a\nspouse may weaken ties to children or reduce re-\nsources needed for traveling to a child's house. We\nanticipate, however, that marital status will have\ngreater consequences for contact with grandchildren\namong men than women.\nOne additional aspect of kinship relationships is\nconsidered in this study: the quality of the relation-\nship between the parent and the grandparent of\nthe grandchild set. The middle generation has been\ncharacterized as the \"bridge\" or \"gatekeeper\" for\nthe G1-G3 relationship, with the ability to facilitate\nor impede the frequency of interactions. When par-\nents have an emotionally close relationship with the\ngrandparents it is reasonable to expect that the\ngrandparents will see that set of grandchildren more\nfrequently than when the parent-grandparent rela-\ntionship is strained. Several studies, in addition to\nthose cited above, provide support for the hypothesis\nthat positive affect between the first and second gen-\nerations promotes closeness and contact between\nthe first and third generations (Johnson, 1985; King &\nSociodemographic Variables.--Several standard\ncontrol variables are included in the cluster of socio-\ndemographic factors, although no firm hypotheses\nregarding their effects are suggested by previous re-\nsearch. The three variables included in this cluster are\ngrandparents' age, race, and education. Although age\nis not expected to have much effect, it is possible\nthat older grandparents will tend to have less stamina\nthan younger ones (even after controlling for health\nstatus), and hence will be less likely to visit frequently\nwith their children and grandchildren. Possible racial\ndifferences in kinship ties have been of interest to\nresearchers, and it is clear that African American\ngrandparents are more likely than Whites to function\nas surrogate parents (Hernandez, 1993; Szinovacz,\n1998). Among grandparents who do not coreside\nwith grandchildren, however there is little empirical\nevidence suggesting that African Americans are\nmore likely to have frequent contact with grandchil-\ndren (Cherlin & Furstenberg, 1986). Finally, possible\neffects of educational attainment are examined. Some\nsuggest that with increasing education there is a\ntendency for individuals to rely less on kin for social\nrelationships (Fischer, 1982). On the other hand,\nhigher socioeconomic status may be associated with\nmore resources, which could facilitate more frequent\nvisiting.\nOn the basis of results of previous empirical studies\nand/or theoretical discussions of kinship and gender,\nwe expect to find a number of significant predictors\nof frequent or infrequent contact between grandpar-\nents and their sets of grandchildren:\n1. Geographic proximity is expected to be a strong\npredictor of frequency of face-to-face contact.\n2. Number of grandchild sets is expected to be\nnegatively associated with frequent contact.\n3. Grandmothers are expected to have more fre-\nquent contact than grandfathers with grandchild sets.\n4. Maternal grandparents are expected to have\nmore frequent contact than paternal grandparents. Fur-\nther, the effect of lineage is expected to be greater\nfor grandmothers than grandfathers, given the saliency\nof the mother-daughter link.\n5. Higher emotional affect between grandparents\nand their children is expected to be a predictor of\nmore frequent contact between grandparents and grand-\nchildren.\n6. Married grandparents are expected to have\nmore frequent contact with grandchildren than wid-\nowed or divorced ones. The effect of marital status is\nexpected to be larger for grandfathers than grand-\nmothers.\nData and Methods\nThe data analyzed in this study are from the sec-\nond wave of the National Survey of Families and\ninterviews with a national sample of 10,008 adults.\nFrom these adults, we selected all grandparents (G1)\nwho had at least one child (G2) who had one or more\nchildren (G3) living in his/her household. We are in-\nterested not in individual grandchildren, but in each\nset of grandchildren that a grandparent has. A set\nincludes all of the grandchildren living with a particu-\nlar adult child of the grandparent. Thus, a grandpar-\nent will have as many sets of grandchildren as she/\nhe has adult children who have children living at\nhome. Excluding those who coreside, the NSFH2 con-\ntains complete information for 4,629 grandparent-\ngrandchild set dyads.\nThe outcome variable of interest in this study is fre-\nquency of face-to-face contact between a grand-\nparent and a particular set of grandchildren. The\nmeasure of frequency of contact comes from a ques-\ntion asking about frequency of contact between the\ngrandparent and the parent of the grandchild set (who\nis the son or daughter of the grandparent). Although\nthis is not an ideal measure, it provides a reasonable\nindicator of how frequently grandparents have con-\ntact with a particular set of their grandchildren. Grand-\nparents in NSFH2 were asked how frequently they\nhad contact with grandchildren (on a 6-point scale),\nas well as how frequently they had contact with each\nchild (using the same scale). In most cases where the\ngrandparent had just one child who had children in\nhis/her household, the contact reported with grand-\nchildren provides a direct measure of contact with the\ngrandchild set of the child with children. (This is not\ntrue in all cases, however. See Appendix.) The corre-\nlation between reported contact with the child and\nwith the grandchild set is 0.72, and in 86% of the\ncases the reported frequency of contact with the child\nand the grandchildren is either identical or in an\nadjacent category. (In cases where there is greater\ndiscrepancy, 5% of the grandparents report more\nfrequent contact with their child; 10% report more\nfrequent contact with their grandchildren.) For grand-\nparents with one set of grandchildren, we compared\nmultivariate analyses where the dependent variable\n(contact with grandchild set) is measured in these two\nways. The results are quite similar (see Appendix).\nTwo dependent variables are constructed from the\n6-point scale of frequency of visiting with the parent\nof each grandchild set: 1 = no visiting in the last year,\n2 = once a year, 3 = several times a year, 4 = 1 to\n3 times a month, 5 = once a week, 6 = more than\nonce a week. \"Frequent\" contact is defined as visit-\ning weekly or more often (5 or 6 on the scale); \"infre-\nquent\" contact is defined as visiting once a year or\nless (1 or 2 on the scale). The decision to use these\ntwo dependent variables developed after we ran\nan ordered logistic regression and found that the\nproportional odds assumption was violated, x2 (52,\nindependent variables are operating differently at\ndifferent levels of the dependent variable. We re-\njected the alternative of using multinomial logistic\nregression because results for such an analysis are\ninordinately complicated to discuss with a six-level\nvariable. By creating two variables--one for each\nend of the distribution--we are able to discuss results\nclearly and simply. Also, by using simple logistic re-\ngression we are able to use all of the data, correcting\nfor family clustering by using Huber standard errors.\nAs indicated in the preceding section, a number of\nrelatively straightforward independent variables are\nincluded in this study. Grandparents' age, race (White,\nBlack, Other), education (years of schooling com-\npleted), work status (in the labor force, not in the\nlabor force), and health (5-point scale, from \"excel-\nlent\" to \"very poor\") are included primarily as control\nvariables, with no strong expectations regarding their\neffects. Grandparents' gender (female, male), kin-\nship link to the grandchild set (maternal, paternal),\nquality of relationship with the G2 parent (10-point\nscale, from \"very poor\" to \"excellent\"), and marital\nstatus are critical variables in the family/gender cat-\negory. The four categories of marital status used in\nthe multivariate analysis are married (meaning mar-\nried to the other parent of the son or daughter who\nis parent of the grandchild set), remarried (meaning\ncurrent spouse is not the parent of the relevant child),\nwidowed, and divorce/separated (which also includes\nthe 37 grandparents who were never married). Dis-\ntance is measured in miles between the grandparent\nand grandchild set, and log of distance is used in the\nregression analysis. Finally, number of grandchild sets\n(1, 2, 3, 4+) is included as a predictor variable. In a\npreliminary analysis we also included several charac-\nteristics of G2 (marital status, labor force participation)\nas independent variables. Because none of these was\na significant predictor, and to keep the focus on\ngrandparents, we dropped these variables in subse-\nquent analysis. The distribution of the sample by the\nvarious independent variables is shown in Table 1.\nWe examine logistic regression equations for two\ndifferent dichotomous outcome variables: frequent\nversus not-frequent contact and infrequent versus\nnot-infrequent contact. We initially ran these regres-\nTable 1.

However, a likelihood ratio test be-\ntween the original model and a fully interactive model\nby grandparents' sex confirmed our expectation that\nthe analysis should be done separately by gender. A\nsimilar test by race did not indicate that different\nprocesses were operating for Whites, Blacks, or other\nraces. Therefore, we present four regression models\npredicting frequent contact for grandmothers, fre-\nquent contact for grandfathers, infrequent contact\nfor grandmothers, and infrequent contact for grand-\nfathers. Because a number of grandparents are in-\ncluded in more than one grandparent-grandchild set\ndyad, we correct for family clustering by using Huber\nstandard errors. With this correction it is possible to\nuse each eligible dyad in the regression analysis.\nFindings\nCross-Tabulation Analysis\nBefore considering results from a multivariate\nanalysis, it is useful to note several interesting findings\nfrom simple cross tabulations. First, as expected, the\nmore sets of grandchildren that a grandparent has,\nthe less likely the grandparent is to have frequent\ncontact with any particular set of grandchildren and\nthe more likely he/she is to have infrequent contact\nwith any particular set (see Table 1). Several additional\nrelationships between number of sets and frequency\nof contact are shown in Figures 1 and 2. (Note that\nthe unit of analysis in Figures 1 and 2 is the individual\ngrandparent, n = 2,723. This differs from Tables 1\nand 2 and Figure 3, where the unit of analysis is the\ngrandparent-grandchild set dyad, n = 4,629.) As the\nnumber of sets increases, the likelihood that a grand-\nparent has frequent contact with at least one set goes\nup. For example, the proportion reporting frequent\ncontact with at least one set of grandchildren in-\ncreases from 50% of grandparents with one set to 78%\nof those with four or more sets. Similarly, the frequency\nof having infrequent contact with all sets of grandchil-\ndren declines from 13% of those with one set to only\n2% of those with four or more sets. Clearly grand-\nparents who have multiple sets of grandchildren\nnave much greater total contact with grandchildren\nthan do grandparents with only one set. On the other\nhand, having multiple sets of grandchildren increases\nthe chances that some sets will be seen on an infre-\nquent basis. When a grandparent has four or more\nsets of grandchildren, it is more than three times as\nlikely that there is infrequent contact with at least\none set than if the grandparent has only one set\n(47% vs 13%). Also, the probability of frequent con-\ntact with all sets drops from 50% when there is one\nset to only 6% when there are four or more. From the\nperspective of an older person, having a large\nnumber of grandchild sets implies a high level of total\ninteraction with grandchildren. From the perspective\nof grandchildren, however, having multiple sets of\ncousins reduces the likelihood of frequent contact\nwith grandparents. Although these findings are not\nunexpected, they point out a serious limitation of\nNumber of Sets\nFigure 1. Variations in percent of grandparents visiting sets of grandchildren frequently by number of grandchild sets. The difference\nbetween having one set and four sets is statistically significant at the .05 level in all comparisons.\nNumber of Sets\nFigure 2. Variations in percent of grandparents visiting sets of grandchildren infrequently by number of grandchild sets. The differ-\nence between having one set and four sets is statistically significant at the .05 level in all comparisons.\nMaternal GM Paternal GM Maternal GF Paternal GF Maternal GM Paternal GM Maternal GF Paternal GF\nGander and Lineage\nFigure 3. Variations in percent of grandparents visiting a particular set of grandchildren frequently or infrequently by gender and\nlineage of grandparent. Comparisons between maternal grandmother (GM)/paternal grandfather (CF) and paternal CM/maternal CF are\nnot particularly interesting. For the remaining eight comparisons, differences are statistically significant at .05, except between maternal/\npaternal grandfather for frequent contact.\nstudies based on samples that include only the rela-\ntionship between a grandparent and a focal child.\nA second noteworthy finding from cross-tabulation\nanalysis concerns differences by gender and lineage.\nAs discussed above, previous studies have produced\ninconsistent findings regarding differences between\ngrandmothers and grandfathers and differences be-\ntween maternal and paternal grandparents. Results\nfrom analyzing this large, national sample indicate that\nboth the grandparent's gender and lineage do mat-\nter, although not all of the differences are Targe (Table\n1, Figure 3). The grandparent most likely to have\nfrequent contact with any particular set of grandchil-\ndren is, as expected, the maternal grandmother. About\n52% of maternal grandmothers have frequent contact\nwith any particular set of grandchildren, compared to\n41% of maternal grandfathers. Further, maternal grand-\nmothers are more likely to have frequent contact with\ngrandchildren than are paternal grandmothers (52%\nvs 38%). On the other hand, there is no significant\ndifference between maternal and paternal grand-\nfathers in frequent visiting, and the difference be-\ntween paternal grandmothers and grandfathers is\nsmall. It appears tnat having a daughter as the link to\nthe grandchildren is a salient factor for grandmothers\nbut not grandfathers. The same general pattern exists\nwhen the focus is on infrequent visiting--maternal\ngrandmothers are least likely to visit infrequently\nwith a set of grandchildren, paternal grandfathers are\nmost likely to visit infrequently. A reasonable conclu-\nsion is that the role of gender and lineage in pre-\ndicting grandparent--grandchild interaction should be\nneither neglected nor exaggerated.\nMultivariate Analysis\nTo explore the effects of the independent variables\non frequency of grandparent-grandchild set contact\nin a multivariate analysis, we ran separate logistic\nregressions to predict frequent and infrequent con-\ntact for grandfathers and grandmothers. The results of\nthese four analyses are shown in Table 2, where odds\nratios are presented. All of the odds ratios shown in\nthe table are statistically significant at .05. These re-\nsults confirm most of our expectations regarding the\neffect of various factors or frequency of grandparent\ncontact with a particular set of grandchildren.\nThe two key variables related to opportunity for\nfrequent contact come through strongly. Geographic\nproximity is the most powerful predictor of either fre-\nquent or infrequent contact, as every previous study\nalso has reported. Number of grandchild sets is also\nsignificant in each analysis shown in Table 2. Living\nfurther away and having multiple sets of grand-\nchildren both predict that grandparents are less\nlikely to have frequent contact and are more likely\nto have infrequent contact with their grandchildren.\nConsistent with findings reported by Cherlin and\nFurstenberg (1986), the other two indicators of op-\nportunity do not have any significant effects. Having\nTable 2.

All of the odds ratios reported in this\ntable are significant at the .05 level.\nbFrequent means once per week or more; infrequent means\nonce per year or less.\npoor health or being in the labor force do not appear\nto interfere with the ability of grandparents to visit\nwith grandchildren. (Note, however, that grandparents\nliving in institutions are not included in this sample.)\nThe sociodemographic variables of age, race, and\neducation are included in the analyses, although no\nparticular expectations regarding tneir effects were\nanticipated. An effect of age (net of health, marital\nstatus, and other factors) is observed only for frequent\ncontact by grandmothers. In this one case there is evi-\ndence of advanced age being associated with a lower\nlikelihood of frequent contact. Perhaps in this case age\nis associated with greater difficulty in transportation,\nbut the total effect is not very great. The absence of\nracial difference in frequency of contact suggests that\ncultural difference in grandparenthood between Whites\nand Blacks may not be significant. This conclusion,\nhowever, needs to be qualified by the fact that Black\ngrandmothers are much more likely than White ones\nto be coresiding with one set of grandchildren. (Cases\nof coresidence between generations were excluded\nfrom the analysis.) In the NSFH2 sample, 30% of Black\ngrandmothers lived in a household that contained one\nor more sets of grandchildren, compared to 9% of\nWhite grandmothers. Educational level was not a\nsignificant predictor of frequent contact but was sig-\nnificant for infrequent contact. Other things being\nequal, grandparents with higher education are less\nlikely to have infrequent contact with their grandchil-\ndren. The most straightforward interpretation of this\nfinding is that those with higher socioeconomic status\nare more likely to have the necessary resources to over-\ncome obstacles to visiting with children and grand-\nchildren.\nA central interest of this study concerns the effects\nof marital status, lineage, and affect on contact be-\ntween grandparents and grandchild sets. In general,\neach of these variables operates in the expected di-\nrection. Consistent with previous studies, a more posi-\ntive relationship between the grandparent and his/her\nchild is related to greater likelihood of frequent con-\ntact with the grandchild set (and less likely infrequent\ncontact). Married grandparents tend to have more\nfreauent contact than their nonmarried counterparts.\nAna maternal grandparents are more likely to have\nfrequent contact than paternal ones. In addition, the\nexpectation that these variables differ by grandparents'\ngender is confirmed.\nMarital status is consistently of greater importance\nin predicting contact with grandchildren for grand-\nfathers than it is for grandmothers. In fact, widowed\ngrandmothers are not significantly less likely than mar-\nried ones to have frequent contact. Grandfathers who\nare divorced, separated, or remarried are especially\nunlikely, compared to their married counterparts, to\nmaintain frequent visiting patterns with their grand-\nchildren. The importance of lineage, on the other hand,\nis greater for grandmothers than grandfathers. Al-\nthough maternal grandmothers are much more likely\nthan paternal grandmothers to have frequent contact\nwith their grandchildren, maternal and paternal\ngrandfathers are not significantly different from each\nother. Also, the quality of the relationship with a child\nis a stronger predictor of frequent contact with a\ngrandchild for grandmothers than grandfathers. The\nmagnitude of the combined effect of gender, marital\nstatus, and lineage on frequency of contact can be\nmade clearer by comparing predicted probabilities\nthat grandparents who differ on selected combinations\nof these variables have frequent (or infrequent) con-\ntact with any particular grandchild set. Using the\nlogistic regression equations, we predict the probabil-\nity of frequent (or infrequent) contact when all vari-\nables except marital status and lineage are set at\nbaseline values (baseline values, except for distance,\nreflect sample means or modes). Specifically, we pre-\ndict the probability of frequent contact for grand-\nmothers and grandfathers with different combina-\ntions of lineage and marital status when they have\nthe following characteristics: age = 62 years; race =\nWhite; education = 12 years; health = good; rela-\ntionship with child = excellent; distance = 30 miles;\nnumber of grandchild sets = 2; and grandparent is\nnot in the labor force. The baseline values for predict-\ning infrequent contact are identical, except that dis-\ntance is set at 500 miles. Results of this exercise are\nshown in Table 3.\nTable 3.

Other things\nbeing equal, married grandfathers are twice as likely\nas widowed ones to see their grandchildren frequently\nand about half as likely to see them on an infrequent\nbasis. Divorced, separated and remarried grandfathers\nare even less likely to have frequent contact with grand-\nchildren. When grandfathers do not have a spouse to\nassist them in maintaining kinship ties, they are much\nless likely to experience high levels of interaction with\ntheir grandchildren. A considerably smaller effect of\nmarital status is observed for grandmothers: divorced\nand separated grandmothers are about 75% as likely\nto visit frequently with grandchildren as married ones.\nThe stronger bond typical between a mother and\ndaughter than between a mother and daughter-in-\nlaw is reflected in lineage differences in predicted fre-\nquency of contact between grandmothers and their\ngrandchild sets. Under the conditions specified above,\n53% of maternal married grandmothers are predicted\nto have frequent contact, compared to 40% of paternal\nones. Among grandfathers, it makes much less differ-\nence whether the link to their grandchildren is through\na son or a daughter. In combination, gender, marital\nstatus, and lineage are found to sharply differentiate the\nexperience of grandparents. Comparing the extreme\ncategories in Table 3, one sees that maternal married\ngrandmothers are 3.5 times as likely to have frequent\ncontact with their grandchildren as paternal, separated,\nbetween these two categories in likelihood of having\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we first note that, based on a large\nnational sample of grandparent-grandchild set dyads,\nsix factors stand out as important predictors or fre-\nquent or infrequent contact:\n1. Geographic distance is the strongest predictor\nof frequent or infrequent contact. All relevant studies\nhave found this result, and it is evident that most grand-\nparents maintain frequent contact with their grand-\nchildren when it is feasible to do so.\n2. The quality of the relationship between a grand-\nparent and his/ner child affects the quantity of con-\ntact between the grandparent and that set of grand-\nchildren. As reported by other studies, the middle gen-\neration may act as a gatekeeper for the grandparent-\ngrandchild relationship.\n3. The number of grandchild sets makes a differ-\nence. As the number of sets increases, the likelihood\nof frequent contact with any particular set decreases\nand the likelihood of infrequent contact increases.\nNevertheless, the probability of having frequent con-\ntact with at least one set of grandchildren is greater\nfor grandparents with multiple sets than for those with\nonly one set.\n4. Gender of the grandparent is relevant. Grand-\nmothers are more likely than grandfathers to have fre-\nquent contact and are less likely to have infrequent\ncontact.\n5. It makes a difference if grandparents are linked\nto a set of grandchildren through a daughter or a son.\nMaternal grandparents are more likely than paternal\ngrandparents to have frequent contact with sets of\ngrandchildren and less likely to have infrequent con-\ntact. The effect of lineage is greater for grandmothers\nthan grandfathers.\n6. Grandparents' marital status has a significant\neffect on the likelihood of frequent or infrequent con-\ntact with grandchildren. This effect is especially strong\nfor grandfathers. For both grandmothers and grand-\nfathers, the ordering from most to least likely to have\nfrequent contact is married, widowed, remarried, di-\nvorced.\nThe most important conclusion to draw from this\nanalysis is that grandparenting needs to be examined\nwithin a complete kinship framework where gender\nmatters. Starting with G1, it makes a difference whether\nthe grandparent is a grandmother or a grandfather. It\nmakes a difference whether or not the grandparent\nhas experienced marital disruption. It makes a dif-\nference how many grandchild sets the grandparent\nhas. And it makes a difference whether the grand-\nparent is linked to grandchildren through a son or a\ndaughter. In other words, general discussions of grand-\nparenting are of limited usefulness. The relationship\nbetween a grandparent and a grandchild is always\nlocated within a particular kinship network. Differences\nin kinship networks help to explain differences in\ngrandparenting behaviors.\nThis study overcomes a limitation of most previous\ngrandparenting studies by having a large, nationally\nrepresentative sample of grandparents. There are,\nnevertheless, three significant limitations related to\nusing these data from NSFH2. The first, apparent to\na perceptive reader, is that contact between grand-\nparents and grandchild sets is not measured directly.\nAs discussed in the Appendix, there is good evidence\nthat frequency of contact between G1 and G2 is a\nreasonable proxy for frequency of contact for the cor-\nresponding G1-G3 relationship, but it would be much\nbetter to measure this directly. A second limitation is\nthat information on characteristics of the individual\ngrandchildren is not available. The third limitation is\nthat consequences of contact frequency cannot ad-\nequately be assessed. Hopefully more complete infor-\nmation on the grandparent-grandchild relationship\nwill be collected in future surveys so that the findings\nsuggested by this analysis can be examined more rig-\norously and their significance explored more fully.\nAs the literature on intergenerational relationships,\nincluding grandparent-grandchild relationships, grows,\nwe are gaining new insights into the role of kin ties in\nthe aging experience. It is not surprising that these\nnew insights stimulate new questions that require\nadditional research. To deepen our understanding of\ngrandparenting, future studies might explore the fol-\nlowing questions: What are the implications of chang-\ning family gender roles for relationships between\ngenerations? Although grandfathers in aggregate have\ndifferent relationships with grandchildren than grand-\nmothers, it is obvious that there is great diversity among\nboth grandfathers and grandmothers. Some grand-\nfathers are highly involved with their grandchildren;\nsome grandmothers are marginally involved with their\ngrandchildren. Do fathers who play a more active role\nin caring for their young children later develop into\ngrandfathers who are more engaged with their grand-\nchildren? Do mothers who turn over much of the par-\nenting role to others develop into less engaged grand-\nmothers?\nGreater attention needs to be given to how grand-\nparents relate to different sets of grandchildren and\nto different grandchildren within a set. The first step,\nof course, is to directly measure grandparent contact\nand relationship with each set of grandchildren and\nwith each grandchild in each set. Then the question\nof what leads to differential involvement can be ex-\nplored. In addition to factors suggested by findings of\nthis study, attention should be given to the relation-\nship between the grandparent and the spouse of\nthe child who links him or her to the grandchildren.\nIt will be important to examine how the needs of vari-\nous grandchild sets affect the relative share of the\ngrandparents' attention that they receive. And char-\nacteristics that differentiate grandparental attention\namong siblings in a set could be explored.\nAs the study of intergenerational relationships pro-\ngresses, it becomes increasingly clear that relation-\nships develop over time. Cross-sectional studies that\nattempt to explain grandparent-grandchild relationships\nby focusing on characteristics at one point in time are\nsimply inadequate. New efforts should be made to\ninclude information on the process through which\nrelationships develop and change. Well designed lon-\ngitudinal studies are ideal for this purpose, but it also\nis possible to collect retrospective life course histories\nthat shed light on the development of relationships.\nThe G1-G2 relationship, which plays such an im-\nportant role in the G1-G3 relationship, has a history.\nAre there critical events in the parent-child relation-\nship that later pull grandparents and grandchildren\ntogether, or which drive them apart? Exploration of\nthese issues must await the collection of appropriate\ndata.\nFinally, the consequences of differing levels of mu-\ntual engagement of grandparent and grandchildren\nneed to be examined more carefully. Are there direct\nbenefits to both generations that come from maintain-\ning frequent contact and high emotional attachment?\nBeyond the individual level, it also is worth asking how\ngrandparent-grandchild connections might benefit\nthe larger society. A number of social changes over\nthe past century have tended to increase age segrega-\ntion in our society: changes in schools, work, churches,\nage-graded organizations, retirement, and extended\nfamily living arrangements. The most significant link-\nages across age groups probably occur because of kin-\nship ties. How important are grandparent-grandchild\nconnections in preserving age integration? And what\nare the factors that enhance the quantity and quality\nof these intergenerational relationships?\nReferences\nAldous, I. (1995).

Journal of Marriage and the Family,\nAppendix\nTo assess how well frequency of G1-G2 contact serves\nas a proxy for frequency of C1-G3 contact, we examine\ncases where C1 reports only one child with children in\nhis/her household. The respondents (G1) report how fre-\nquently they have contact with each child and with their\ngrandchildren (both on a scale from 1 to 6). When there\nis only one set of grandchildren, we expect that in most\ncases the contact reported with grandchildren will be the\nfrequency of contact they have with the grandchild set\nof the child who has children in his/her household. (The\nexceptions would be when grandparents have other grand-\nchildren not living in their parents' household. Thus some\ngrandparents might be reporting frequency of contact\nwith a grandchild who is not in the set of interest. We\nexpect the results would be even stronger if there were a\nway to exclude these cases.) As reported in the text, in\n86% of the cases the frequency of contact with the child\nand with grandchildren is either identical or in an adja-\ncent category.\nTo examine how robust the results of Table 2 are, we\nran the logistic regressions restricted to cases where there\nis just one set of grandchildren (n = 1,243). We com-\npare the results of this regression model when the de-\npendent variable is frequent (or infrequent) contact be-\ntween G1-G2 (as in Table 2) with the results when the\ndependent variable is frequent (or infrequent) contact\nbetween G1-G3. In this analysis we must, of course, drop\nnumber of grandchild sets as an independent variable.\nIn addition, we have made marital status of the grand-\nparent a dichotomous variable (married to other parent\nof G2 vs other), and we have included gender of the\ngrandparent as an independent variable. The results are\nshown in Table 4 for the variables of interest.\nOverall, the results presented in Table 4 suggest that\nusing G1-G2 contact as a proxy for G1-G3 is not prob-\nlematic. The only exception might be with the effect of\nmaternal lineage. It is plausible, however, that lineage is\nnot significant in the special case where grandparents have\nonly one set of grandchildren. Paternal grandparents with\nonly one set of grandchildren will not see any grandchil-\ndren if they do not see their son's grandchildren.\nTable 4.
