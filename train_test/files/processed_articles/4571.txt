Reasons for not receiving ED treatment were categorized\naccording to whether the decision was made by the patient against medical advice or if the decision\nwas based on a physician's evaluation and their recommendations.\nResults: There were 212 patients reviewed; 120 in the non-intoxicated group and 92 in the\nintoxicated group. The intoxicated group had a higher proportion of males than the non-\nintoxicated group. The most common cause of non-disease symptoms in the intoxicated group was\nassault. In the non-intoxicated group, the most common reason for the lack of ED treatment was\nthat treatment could take place on an outpatient basis, while in the intoxicated group, the reason\nwas lack of patient cooperation.\nConclusions: The intoxicated group was older, male and more likely to present with symptoms\nnot related to a disease process than those in the non-intoxicated group when using unnecessary\nEMS transport.\n",

Therefore, the objective\nof this preliminary study was to investigate\nmedically unnecessary EMS transports by\ncomparing the differences between patients\nwho on arrival were found to be non-\nintoxicated versus intoxicated. The study\nfocused on individuals who did not receive\ntreatment at the ED although they utilized\nEMS transport.\nPatients and methods\nPatient population\nA retrospective review was conducted for\npatients who were transported to the ED via\nEMS, yet did not subsequently receive treat-\nment at the ED. Data were collected for 6\n2015 at a single academic university hospital\nin Ulsan (Department of Emergency\nMedicine, University of Ulsan College of\nMedicine, Ulsan University Hospital,\nUlsan, Republic of Korea), which is located\non the southeast coast of South Korea.\nIn this region of South Korea, the local fire\ndepartments are responsible for 119 (emer-\ngency contact number in South Korea)\nresponses and transportation from each\nscene to hospital. As an alternative to seeking\nan ED, some outpatient clinics are operating\nduring the weekday night-times and the\nafternoons at the weekends. However, most\npatients using EMS transport in South Korea\nare transported to the ED and not to the\noutpatient clinics.\nThis study was approved by the relevant\ninstitutional review board (no. UUH-IRB-\nUlsan, South Korea. Written or verbal\ninformed consent were exempted due to\nthe retrospective nature of the study.\nData collection\nThe EMS run sheets that were submitted to\nthe hospital after transportation were retro-\nspectively reviewed. Data were excluded\nif the run sheet was not submitted to the\nhospital, the run sheet was unreadable, or\nthe patient was treated at the ED after\ntransportation. All the EMS run sheets had\nthe same format. Data were collected and\nseveral different categories were analysed:\ngeneral demographics, clinical demograph-\nics, prehospital treatment and reason for\nlack of treatment in the ED. The general\ndemographics that were collected included:\nagency who performed the prehospital treat-\nment and transport, age, sex, time, day of\nEMS use, elapsed time from EMS call to\nscene and EMS call to hospital ED, occu-\npation of patient, location from which the\ncall was placed. Age and time of EMS use\nwere classified later into subgroups. Clinical\ndemographics that were recorded included:\npast medical history, list of symptoms (later\ncategorized as disease or non-disease related),\nvital signs, level of consciousness, pupil light\nreflex and glucose level. Symptoms were\nrecorded as disease or non-disease on the\nrun sheet by the fire fighters, so the study\nused the classification of symptoms based on\nthe information on the run sheet. Prehospital\ntreatment data that were collected included\nairway intervention, oxygen, electrocardio-\ngram cardiac monitor, intravenous line, drug\nuse, immobilization, wound care, adjuvants\nto keep a patient warm or cool, automated\nexternal defibrillator monitor, direct medical\n34 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)\ncontrol contact, number and qualifications of\nthe riding fire fighters.\nReasons for no ED treatment\nReasons for not receiving ED treatment were\nfurther divided into two groups: (i) those\npatients who made this decision against\nmedical advice; and (ii) patients who did\nnot receive treatment based on a physician's\nevaluation and their recommendations.\nDetails of those patients that went against\nmedical advice were classified into: (i) refusal\nto receive treatment; (ii) uncooperative; (iii)\nwanted to transfer to another hospital; (iv)\nreceived outpatient treatment. Details of the\nrecommendations made after a physician's\nevaluation were classified into: (i) no symp-\ntoms at ED arrival; (ii) intoxication without\ntrauma or medical problems; (iii) can be\ntreated by a primary care physician or at\nanother hospital; (iv) repeated visits with the\nsame symptoms. Patients were separated into\nthose who were under the influence of alcohol\nversus those who were not.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe IBM SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. To investigate whether alcohol\nintoxication affected the unnecessary EMS\ntransport or not, comparison of general,\nclinical demographics, prehospital treat-\nment and reasons for lack of ED treatment\nwere performed between the non-intoxi-\ncated and intoxicated group using 2-test,\nFisher's exact test and Student's t-test.

One study\nshowed that the ED diagnosis was inappro-\npriate as a criterion for evaluating the med-\nical necessity of EMS transport.12 By using\nan ED diagnosis to identify patients for a\nstudy of medically appropriate EMS use you\nmay be missing a significant amount of\nimportant data. For example, some patients\nleave prior to being seen by a physician and\ntherefore do not receive a diagnosis, while\nothers do not receive treatment due to their\npersonal choice to leave against medical\nadvice prior to full evaluation and testing.\nThis present study demonstrated that the\nproportion of the patients who did not\nreceive ED treatment against medical\ncomparing those who were not intoxicated\nwith those who were intoxicated, it was 26%\nversus 71%, respectively. In South Korea,\nall intoxicated patients must not be dis-\ncharged if the attending physician believes\nthat the patient needs to be treated urgently.\nHowever, if a patient appears to present\nwith intoxication alone or they have a minor\ncomplaint that does not necessitate immedi-\nate treatment, then medical providers do not\nneed to enforce this rule. In South Korea, the\ndecision as to whether or not an intoxicated\npatient needs to be treated in the ED is not\nbased on obtaining a blood alcohol level, but\non the physician's judgement. It should be\nnoted that when reviewing patients who did\nnot receive ED treatment due to a decision\nthey made against medical advice, in South\nKorea, there is a general policy that they\nwould not be discharged if the physician feels\nthat the patient has an urgent need to be\ntreated. Therefore, all of the causes of no ED\ntreatment that were classified into the `against\nmedical advice' category in this study can be\ndefined as unnecessary EMS transport.\nDrinking alcohol can cause medical prob-\nlems as well as many socioeconomic\ntend to use EMS transport and visit the ED\nmore frequently than the general\npopulation.20,21 Many people utilized the\nEMS resources unnecessarily in an intoxi-\ncated state, with the intoxicated group\nin this study. Intoxicated patients who have\nbeen assaulted have an even higher utiliza-\ntion of EMS resources overall.22 Among\nthose patients considered to have symptoms\nnot associated with a disease process, 40%\nin the intoxicated-group and 5% in the non-\nintoxicated group presented as a result of\nassault in the present study. This previous\nevidence, along with the current findings,\nlead us to believe that alcohol intoxication\nand assault play a key role in the overuse of\nIndividual patients are not charged for\nEMS transportation and prehospital treat-\nment provided by the local fire departments\nin South Korea, as is the case in many other\ncountries.23,24 This may lead to excessive use\nof EMS and unnecessary EMS transporta-\ntion. In South Korea, the 119 dispatcher or\nthe emergency medical technician has the\nright to refuse to transport a patient if they\nbelieve that the patient does not need EMS\ntransportation, but in reality many pro-\nviders are afraid to make the wrong decision\nand EMS transportation is deployed. This is\none of the many obstacles in the attempt to\nreduce unnecessary EMS transportation, as\nwell as the large proportion of the popula-\ntion who consume alcohol in excess. Ideally\nin the future, prehospital patients found to\nbe intoxicated alone without any medical or\ntraumatic problems may be considered not\nsuitable for EMS transportation if guide-\nlines can be clearly outlined and EMS\nproviders are given appropriate training.\nThis present study had several limita-\ntions. First, it was conducted retrospectively\nin a single university academic hospital.\nTherefore, the findings might not be gener-\nalizable to a larger population. Secondly, the\ndata collected were based on fire fighters'\nrun sheets alone and not from a direct\ninterview with the patient in the ED. Also,\nVan Dillen and Kim 41\nthe reasons for the lack of ED treatment was\ninvestigated only by analysing the informa-\ntion on the run sheets, therefore data may\nhave been misclassified. However, the study\nattempted to decrease this error based\non prior experience of treating patients\nin the study hospital. Direct follow-up inter-\nviews with the EMS provider who wrote\nthe report would have improved the accur-\nacy of the data, but was not performed.\nThirdly, a review of all of the run sheets was\nnot performed, so the study was not able to\ncompare the characteristics of patients who\ndid receive ED treatment with those who did\nnot receive ED treatment. Larger prospect-\nive multi-centre studies that complement the\nabove findings will be helpful to evaluate the\naccuracy of this present description of\nunnecessary EMS transport.\nIn conclusion, this is the first study\nto investigate the unnecessary utilization\nof EMS transport based on patients who\ndid not receive treatment in the ED. The\nintoxicated group was typically older males\nwho presented with symptoms not related to\na disease process when compared with those\nin the non-intoxicated group. The most\nfrequent cause for not receiving ED treat-\nment in patients transported by EMS was\nthe physician's recommendation in the non-\nintoxicated group and the patient's decision\nto leave against medical advice in the\nintoxicated group. This present study has\nidentified a need for education of the com-\nmunity surrounding Ulsan, South Korea.\nTwo programmes will need to be created\nand delivered: (i) one should include educa-\ntion surrounding alcohol abuse, covering\nthe dangers, and recognition and identifica-\ntion of avenues for assistance in alcohol\ncontrol; and (ii) a second that is targeted at\nthe general population regarding the appro-\npriate use of EMS and ED for medical care.\nApplying a charge for EMS transportation\nmight need to be considered as a way to\nreduce unnecessary EMS transportation in\nSouth Korea. EMS systems outside of South\nKorea might also be able to reduce unneces-\nsary EMS transportation by adopting com-\nprehensive guidelines for EMS transport\nand having well-trained EMS personnel, as\nwell as by providing the aforementioned\npublic educational initiatives.\n"
