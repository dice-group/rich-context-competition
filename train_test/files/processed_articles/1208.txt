Design and Methods: We constructed a stat-\nic-component projection model using age, function,\nand other covariates. We obtained enrollee projec-\ntions from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA)\nand combined these with nursing home and commu-\nnity long-term-care service use rates from the 1999\nNational Long-Term Care Survey and the 2000\nNational Health Interview Survey. Results: Over\nthe next decade, the number of oldest veterans\n(aged 85\u00fe) will double, and VHA-enrolled veterans\naged 85 and older will increase sevenfold. This will\nresult in a 20\u00ad25% increase in use for both nursing\nhome and home- and community-based services.\nVHA currently concentrates 90% of its long-term-\ncare resources on nursing home care. However,\namong those who receive long-term care from all\nformal sources, 56% receive care in the community.\nAge and marital status are significant predictors of\nuse of either type of formal long-term-care service for\nany given level of disability. VHA's experience with\nthe mandatory nursing home benefit suggests that\neven when the cost to the veteran is near zero, only\n60\u00ad65% of eligibles will choose VHA-provided care.\nAssisted living represents nearly 15% of care pro-\nvided during the past decade to individuals in nursing\nhomes, and approximately 19% of veterans using\nnursing homes have disability levels comparable to\nthose of men supported in assisted living. Implica-\ntions: As most of the increased projected use for long-\nterm care will be for home- and community-based\nservices, VHA will need to expand those resources.\nUse of VHA resources to leverage community services\nmay offer new opportunities to enhance community-\nbased long-term care.\nKey Words: Projection models, Nursing home\nutilization, Home- and community-based service\nutilization, Veterans Health Administration,\nNational Long-Term Care Survey\nDuring the past decade, there have been attempts\nto change the locus of long-term-care services, to\nexpand their scope and delivery, and to create new\nservices better suited to the specific needs of frail\nelders, while limiting their total cost. In 1992, the\nVeterans Health Administration (VHA) offered\nlong-term-care services heavily weighted toward\nprovision of nursing home care (approximately\n95% of all long-term-care expenditures). In contrast,\nabout 85% of Medicare and Medicaid long-term-\ncare funding went to nursing homes. By 2002, VHA\nhad expanded community services somewhat, but\nnursing homes still captured 89% of long-term-care\nexpenditures. At the same time, Medicare and\nMedicaid policy changes and state program expan-\nsion reduced nursing home expenditures to 70\u00ad75%\nof the total long-term-care funding in those pro-\ngrams. These changes included greater use of nursing\nhome preadmission screening, expansion of the role\nof Medicaid home- and community-based (HCBS)\nwaivers, development of assisted living, expansion of\nnew programs such as the Programs of All-Inclusive\nCare for the Elderly, and changes in medical care\nThis article was commissioned for the September 2003 U.S.\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Office of Research and Development,\nHealth Services Research and Development (HSR&D) Service State of\nthe Art conference ``Leading the Way to Quality Long-Term Care:\nLessons From the Past, Strategies for the Future.''

The Act also required\nthe VHA to maintain the nursing home bed capacity\nthat was available in 1998. Thus, the Act had the\npotential to expand community-based long-term-\ncare services (HCBS) but also to expand nursing\nhome use. In this article, we characterize the enrolled\nveteran population in 2002 by measures of factors\nbelieved to influence projected use for long-term-care\nservices and, using VHA's population projections\nand the current LTC [long-term care] Policy Model\n(Version 3.1), present the projected future use for\nnursing home and HCBS services for the next\ndecade. We do not address nonpaid, informal help\nin HCBS. The primary goal of these projections is to\nidentify the types of qualitative changes required for\nVHA long-term-care programs, as they currently\nfunction, to meet likely use. By their nature, these\nprojections are based on current patterns of supply\nof services and demands for care given specific needs,\nwhich makes the precise numerical estimates some-\nwhat uncertain.\nMethods\nPopulation Definition\nThe level of long-term-care use generally follows\nthe distribution of disabilities in a population. For\nour purposes, we included both persons who report\nreceiving human assistance (hands on, supervision,\nor standby help) with activities of daily living (ADLs;\nKatz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, & Jaffe, 1963)\nor instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs;\nLawton & Brody, 1969) because of a health problem,\nand those who report requiring mechanical or non-\nhuman help with an ADL (low-level ADL disability).\nWe included the latter because requiring mechanical\nhelp provides an objective mark of difficulty in\naccomplishing an activity, but we consider individ-\nuals with low-level ADL disabilities to be similar to\nthose who have disability only with IADLs with\nrespect to their need for nursing home and HCBS\nservices (Spector, Fleishman, Pezzin, & Spillman,\n1999). ADLs represent the primary activities neces-\nsary to carry out basic functions, such as eating,\ndressing, and bathing; IADLs include tasks necessary\nfor independent community living, such as shopping,\nmanaging finances, and cooking.\nAlthough the long-term-care population over-\nwhelmingly has one or more chronic IADL/ADL\ndisabilities, not all users of long-term-care services\nhave such disabilities, nor do all who have disabil-\nities have them for an extended period. For example,\nafter an acute exacerbation of congestive heart fail-\nure, a veteran may have no disabilities, or may have\ndifficulty only with mobility related to in-hospital\ndeconditioning, but still receive short-term home\ncare services. Similarly, changes in medical practice\nhave shifted a portion of traditionally acute care\ninto the nursing home or home care setting. Thus,\nthe long-term-care population includes some people\nwith no ADL or IADL disability.\nData Sources\nAlthough VHA has extensive data on veterans\nwho receive medical care through VHA, only limited\ndata are available on the functional status of those\nveterans. What is available is recorded for specific\npopulations (e.g., VHA Nursing Home Care Unit\nresidents, Home Based Primary Care patients). For\nthose who do not receive medical care, data are\neven sparser, for example, with regard to marital\nstatus. Although part of the evaluation effort of\nthe Millennium Act was to incorporate routine\nassessment of functional status, this is only now\nbeing implemented system wide. Therefore, we com-\nbined data from VHA surveys of the enrolled vet-\neran population, the National Long-Term Care\nSurvey (NLTCS), the National Nursing Home\nSurvey (NNHS), and the National Health Inter-\nview Survey (NHIS). We discuss our use of each of\nthese sources below.\nVHA (through the Office of the Assistant Deputy\nUnder-Secretary for Health) conducted two exten-\nsurvey, conducted in 2004, was not available for this\nanalysis. A fourth survey, conducted in 2005, was\ncoordinated with the 2004 NLTCS screener and will\nbe used for the 2007 model update. These surveys\nassess areas of projected use for VHA services,\ninsurance availability, and functional status (self-\nreported IADLs and ADLs). All were telephone\nSeveral national surveys address long-term-care\nneeds, and we used them in this study. Perhaps the\nbest primary data source available is the NLTCS\nlongitudinal and cross-sectional data on a nationally\nrepresentative sample of about 42,000 U.S. residents\non Medicare, aged 65 years or older at some point\nsurvivors at each of the five waves of whom about\n1,500 in institutional residence. At the time of each\nnew survey, a cohort sample of about 5,000 adults\npassing their 65th birthday in the prior 5 years is\nadded to the surviving sample to replace the deaths\nthat occurred since the prior survey and to ensure\nthat the new sample is representative of the entire\nelderly (aged 65 and older) Medicare population.\nThe NLTCS covers both institutionalized and non-\ninstitutionalized individuals, and response rates are\nexcellent for all five waves of the survey (95% and\ngreater; Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1997). All\ninstitutionalized individuals received a detailed in-\nterview, except in 1982. A screener interview targets\nnoninstitutionalized disabled individuals for further\nstudy using a detailed community interview. The\nscreening interview is initially administered via\ntelephone, but slightly more than 20% of those\nscreened require an in-person interview to complete\nthe screening survey. These 20% are a nonrandom\nrepresentation of the screened population. Thus, the\nNLTCS employs a nationally representative longitu-\ndinal design with cross-sectional replenishment at\nThe NLTCS questionnaire items used to assess\nADL limitations identify activities in which the re-\nspondent receives active physical help from another\nperson during the prior week. This provides an\nobjective anchor against which one can compare the\nuse of standby help or special equipment to cope\nwith lower levels of limitation. The questionnaire\nalso probes for activities in which help is needed but\nnot received, so that the entire spectrum of ADL\nlimitations is represented. The assessment of IADL\nlimitations is based on questionnaire items that\nestablish that the respondent cannot perform an\nactivity due to a disability or health problem. This\nremoves socially defined roles as reasons for not\nperforming activities such as cooking, doing house-\nwork, or managing bills. All NLTCS records are\nongoing periodic updating to allow tracking of\nmortality, Medicare claims, and enrollment or\ndisenrollment in a health maintenance organization\nor managed care organization.\nA strength of the NLTCS is the large sample size\nat ages 85 and older--a population for whom it is\noften difficult to get estimates because of its rela-\ntively small size. The NLTCS includes more than\npeople aged 90 and older in each survey, and the\nsampling of the population aged 95 and older (n =\nComparison of the NLTCS and the VHA\nenrolled veterans in the NLTCS panel, of whom\nnumber of enrolled veterans based on the age/gender\ndistribution in the population was 1,459.

This method estimated the proportion of the\n1999 U.S. population in nursing homes exclusive of\nresidents in other institutional settings (dormitories,\nprisons, military barracks, etc.).\nThe NNHS current nursing home resident sample\nconsists of a two-stage stratified random sample of\nU.S. nursing home residents. The first stage of the\nsample consists of 1,423 nursing homes selected from\na population of 18,000 nursing homes via a stratified\nrandom sample. The second stage obtained data\nfrom 8,215 current nursing home residents from a\nsample of up to six residents per home. Data on res-\nidents were obtained via a combination of personal\ninterviews and review of residents' medical records.\nThe NHIS is a multistage random sample of indi-\nviduals from noninstitutionalized dwelling units in\nthe United States. It includes an oversampling of\nHispanics and African Americans.

We categorized marital status as married\nversus other, with age- and gender-specific propor-\ntions imputed from the 2002 Survey of Enrolled\nVeterans. Both the NHIS and NNHS defined the\nfollowing five daily limitations: (a) bathing/shower-\ning, (b) getting in and out of bed/chairs (trans-\nferring), (c) dressing, (d) toileting, and (e) eating.\nIn subsequent data presentations, these five ADLs\nrepresent the core activities for disability classifica-\ntion. The common IADLs as measured in the 2000\nwalking, (b) doing light housework, (c) managing\nmoney, (d) shopping, (e) using the telephone, and\n(f) preparing meals. These represented the core\nIADLs. We described persons in the enrolled\nveteran population as being in one of six disability\nclasses: Class 0 (no disability), Class 1 (IADL\ndisability or ADL deficits that do not require the\nassistance of others, which we classified as low-level\ndisability), Class 2 (one ADL deficit requiring the\nassistance of others), Class 3 (two ADL deficits),\nClass 4 (three ADL deficits), Class 5 (four ADL\ndeficits), and Class 6 (five or more ADL deficits).\nFor veterans older than 65, we compared nursing\nhome use rates from the NLTCS and the NNHS/\nNHIS, although we ultimately used the NLTCS\nbecause of problems with the NHIS estimates\namong those with significant disability and those\naged 85 and older due to small numbers. For\nveterans younger than 65, we used the NNHS/\nNHIS and NHHCS/NHIS as the sources for\nservice-use rates.\nAlthough people often associate both long-term-\ncare service use and disability with elderly adults,\na substantial number of nonelderly veterans have\neither an IADL or ADL disability. The rates are\nsimilar to those in the non-veteran population,\nalthough the level of disability among veterans\nyounger than 65 is greater than that among their\nnon-veteran counterparts. However, service use\nvaries significantly. Nearly 40% of persons 65 and\nolder, but only 14% of those younger than 65,\nreceived formal services (paid help provided by\nsomeone other than a relative). So, whereas most\nyounger disabled veterans (86%) rely primarily on\ninformal assistance, just more than 60% of elderly\ndisabled veterans rely exclusively on informal assis-\ntance. As both disability prevalence and particularly\nuse of long-term-care services increases with age,\nwe begin with a description of the demographics of\nthe enrolled veteran population.\nEnrolled Veteran Population\nThe total veteran population is projected to de-\ncline by 5 million over the next decade, and the\nHowever, the number of veterans aged 85 and older\npercentage of all veterans will increase from 3% in\nthe Actuary). The proportion of all veterans who\nare enrolled in the VA is expected to increase, and\namong those aged 65 and older, VHA expects its\nenrolled in\nVHA (%)\nNotes: Projections are to September 30 of each year.

Although there is an expected increase in the\nnumber of enrolled veterans aged 65 or older in the\nnext decade, nearly 60% of the increase is projected\nto be among veterans aged 85 or older (Table 1;\nVHA Office of the Undersecretary of Health Policy\nand Planning, 2003). The relative immediate impact\nis greater over the next 5 years, as the number of\nenrolled veterans aged 85 and older will increase\nfourfold. This is the group with the highest prev-\nalence of ADL and IADL disability and the highest\nrates of formal long-term-care service use, as well as\nthe group for which the estimates are least precise.\nAmong other factors, the availability of the Part D\nMedicare drug benefit may affect the currently ob-\nserved enrollment rates among aged veterans.\nService Use by the Enrolled Veteran Population,\nFor predicting service use, the LTC Policy Model\nprojects use for institutional (i.e., inpatient) pro-\ngrams and HCBS (i.e., outpatient) programs, ex-\ncluding geriatric clinics but including homemaker/\nhome health aide and hospice services. Contract care\nis allocated to its institutional (i.e., contract nursing\nhome) and HCBS (e.g., skilled home health) com-\nponents. Thus, for example, in fiscal year 2001, the\nVHA long-term-care budget spent $1.6 billion\nHCBS programs.\nA significant aspect of the Millennium Act was the\ncreation of a mandatory benefit for nursing home\ncare for P1A veterans (70% service-connected\ndisability). By removing cost, which was significant\nfor nursing home care, it was assumed (and feared)\nthat a deluge of P1A veterans would exhaust all VA\nnursing home capacity. (This is, in part, because\na nursing home benefit is worth between $39,000 and\n$89,000/year, depending on the area of the country,\na substantial value for those requiring nursing home\ncare.) Thus, the nursing home use of the P1As\nrepresents the observed projected use for a long-\nterm-care service VHA must provide, without\nsignificant monetary costs to the user. By 2002, the\naverage daily census (ADC) of P1As was 6,820, with\nnity nursing homes, and 605 in state homes. With\nVHA-provided nursing home beds by P1As repre-\nsented just 2.1% of the total P1A population (the\nnational average of nursing home residence among\nthe male population is 3.7%), suggesting that factors\nother than cost affect the choice of VHA as a\nprovider of nursing home care (and the large finan-\ncial benefit it represents). Using geocoding of P1A\nveterans with respect to their nearest nursing home\ncare units, analysis suggested that propinquity may\nbe a significant predictor, as slightly more than half\nof all P1As in VHA nursing home beds lived within\n30 min of those facilities (Kinosian, Martingdale,\nRipley, & Stallard 2004). Nursing home use appears\nto decline significantly somewhere between 60 and\n120 min of drive time from a VA nursing home care\nAlthough P1As represent 26% of nursing home care\nunit ADC, they use more than 70% of the com-\nmunity nursing home beds (Table 2). The other\nsignificant factor, for which data do not exist, is the\nnumber of P1A veterans who have already spent\ndown and are currently receiving Medicaid-funded\nnursing home care. However, the impact of this\nfactor should decline over time as new eligible\nveterans have access to the benefit. A significant\ndifference between the VHA-provided nursing home\nbenefit and Medicaid-funded nursing home care is\nthe absence of estate recovery provisions for VHA-\nprovided nursing home care.\nResults\nDisability Estimate of Enrolled Veteran\nDespite declining age-specific disability prevalence\nrates, the number of veterans with high levels of\nADL disability is projected to increase, especially\namong those aged 85 and older.

Among that\ndeficits. Despite the overall decline in disability\namong the population, the absolute growth among\nthose with five or more ADL deficits will be as large\na share of the total enrolled veteran growth as any\nother category of ADL disability (see Figure 1).\nThe distribution of disability in the enrolled\nveteran population is similar to the distribution in\nthe general U.S. male population aged 65 and older\n(of which about 60% are veterans). The only\ndisability level for which enrolled veterans appear\nto differ from the general male population is low-\nlevel disability (Disability Class 1), for which there is\nslightly greater low-level disability among veterans\nThere is controversy over whether disability rates\nare declining among elders, at what level of dis-\nability, and at what rate. A recent meta-analysis\n(Freedman, Martin, & Schoeni, 2002) concluded that\nboth ADL and IADL disability are declining, al-\nthough there was uncertainty as to the rate. The\nabove projection assumes that the decline in disabil-\nity from the 2002 level is at the same rate as the\nobserved mortality decline--approximately 0.6%\nper year. Manton and Gu (2001) suggested higher\nrates of disability decline (up to 2.4% for IADL\ndeficits). If disability were to decline at this observed\nrate (i.e., greater than the mortality decline), the\nthose with two or more ADL disabilities, or 17,000\nmore ADL disabilities). Even among those with\nIADL disabilities, the decline is only 8.3% of the\nProjecting Long-Term-Care Service Use,\nTo describe current long-term-care service use and\nproject it forward, VHA developed a LTC Planning\nModel (Version 2.2) that used the age- and disability-\nspecific nursing home use rates from the 1996 MEPS-\nNHC. For the current projections, we modified that\nmodel to (a) stratify the population by gender, (b)\nstratify the population by marital status, (c) use\na uniform disability definition across data sources\nand between population definition and use-rate\ndefinition, (d) update service-use rates, and (e)\nincorporate disability decline. The following projec-\ntions are based on the age/gender/marital status/\ndisability class service-use rates. The rates are based\non the NLTCS for those aged 65 and older, on the\nNNHS/NHIS for nursing home use, and on the\nNHHCS/NHIS for HCBS use for those younger than\nThese current model projections do not explicitly\ninclude cognitive status but incorporate it indirectly\nas it impacts functional disability. A more complex\nrevision of the LTC Planning Model (in preparation)\nwill explicitly incorporate cognitive impairment. Pre-\nliminary analyses of the veteran subsample in the\nNLTCS suggest rates of cognitive impairment some-\nwhat higher than those in the general male population\n(6.16% for those with mild\u00admoderate cognitive\nimpairment [Mini-Mental State Examination score\n21] compared to 5.9% in the general population;\n4.36% for those with moderate\u00adsevere cognitive\nimpairment [Mini-Mental State Examination score\nAlthough there is an increase in cognitive impairment\nwith disability class, even among those with five and\nsix ADL dependencies, there is a substantial portion\nwithout significant cognitive impairment (30\u00ad50%).\nBecause of the incomplete mapping of cognitive\nimpairment and disability level, readers must use\ncaution when comparing individuals with similar\ndisability levels in settings with different levels of\nsupervision. For example, institutionalized individuals\nin Disability Class 1 (low-level ADL disability) are\nvery likely cognitively impaired, requiring 24-hr\nsupervision. Although HCBS could be a potential\nsubstitute for those with significant ADL dependen-\ncies who do not have significant cognitive impair-\nments, more direct substitutes would be services that\nprovide supervision in noninstitutional settings (e.g.,\nadult foster care, group homes, community assisted\nliving) for those with cognitive impairment.\nIn comparing the same stratified rates for those\naged 65 and older using the two sources (NLTCS vs\nNNHS/NHIS [for nursing home] or NHHS/NHIS\n[for HCBS]), we noted that whereas the projected\nFigure 1.

Most of this\ncare has been funded by other payers. Even among\nthose with high levels of disability, most care that is\nprovided is informal. This is more marked among\nthose younger than 65, which may reflect access\ndifficulties due to poorer coverage for HCBS and\nrepresent a target area for VHA-funded services. A\nsignificant portion (approximately 10%) of commu-\nnity care is in assisted living facilities that provide\npersonal care and supervision.\nHCBS includes skilled services (nursing, physical\ntherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy), pri-\nmary medical care (provided through VHA Home\nBased Primary Care programs), adult day health\ncare, homemaker services (performing IADL tasks\nsuch as cooking, cleaning, and shopping), home\nhealth aide services (performing ADL tasks such as\nbathing, dressing, transferring, and toileting), in-\nhome respite, and care coordination. Estimates based\nonly on the NHHCS, which includes only skilled\nservices and aide services limited to the period of\nneed for skilled care, are lower than those based on\nthe NLTCS linked with Medicare home health files,\nwhich include formal aide services provided without\nconcurrent skilled treatment needs.\nSupportive housing services--in which supervi-\nsion and hands-on support are available--are di-\nvided between those settings that provide 24-hr\nmedical care (usually onsite nursing) and those that\ndo not. In the housing supplement to the NLTCS,\nthose facilities that had 24-hr medical care were\nclassified as institutions, whereas those that did not\nwere considered community assisted living. The\nestimates for HCBS include community assisted\nliving, although that is not currently part of the\nVHA benefit package. We included it because those\nindividuals receive support for their IADL/ADL\ndeficits, which would need to be met somewhere.\nSuch community assisted living facilities and smaller\ntypes of settings, such as group homes, offer the\npersonal care and supervision of nursing homes\nwithout the onsite integration of medical care\nprovided in institutional settings. Thus, they are\ndistinct from other HCBS, which provide care for\nspecified portions of the day to individuals in their\nown residences.\nThere is a substantial amount of HCBS used by\nVHA enrollees. Again, comparing the growth in\nservice use by those aged 85 and older and the\ngeneral growth in service use, most of the growth\nover the next decade will be among those aged 85\nand older. As with disability, VHA enrollees appear\nto be similar to all men in the NLTCS in terms of\ntheir use of HCBS (Table 3). Note that, unlike in the\ncase of nursing home care, there is substantial service\nuse among individuals with no IADL/ADL deficits.\nThese are possibly individuals receiving post-acute\nhome care services focused on medical, rather than\nfunctional, issues. Again, there are significant differ-\nences in service use between those who are married\nand those who are not married. Among older un-\nmarried individuals with higher levels of disability,\nformal service use approaches 80\u00ad90%. However,\nthe lower use rates among persons younger than 65\nmay reflect access difficulties. As these projections\nare based on actual use, and most care is paid for\noutside of VHA, where coverage for individuals\nyounger than 65 is erratic, low use is not equivalent\nto low need. Thus, the increase in use by disability\nlevel for those aged 65 and older may well reflect\nbetter coverage through the Medicare home health\nbenefit as well as community waiver programs. The\nobserved difference may be made up by informal\ncommunity supports for persons younger than 65.\nThese data combine Medicare and NLTCS\nreports of formal (i.e., paid) home care services.\nThere is some overlap, but the NLTCS reports 30%\nof home care not covered through skilled sources.\nBecause the number of enrolled veterans using HCBS\nin the 1999 survey was small, and their similarity to\ngeneral men in the NLTCS, we used the male rates\nfor estimating the overlap of HCBS and the use of\ncommunity assisted living.\nAlthough overall 20% of individuals use both\nskilled home health and other personal care services,\nthe proportion rises to more than 40% among indi-\nviduals in higher disability classes. Although there is\nnot a large share of any disability class receiving\nservices in assisted living, 80% of those individuals in\ncommunity assisted living have zero to two ADL\nliving), overlapping 19% of the nursing home popu-\nlation. Again, as these individuals likely have signif-\nicant cognitive impairments, community settings that\nmay be an alternative to institutions (such as group\nhomes or assisted living facilities) would need to\nprovide a similar level of nonmedical supervision.\nUsing the breakdown of services observed among\nmen in the NLTCS, HCBS use breaks down as\nfollows: skilled nursing (home health agency;\n46%), an overlap group using formal skilled and\nnon-skilled services (20.6%), and community assis-\nBecause the VHA-supplied ADC for these services\nyear 2004), the vast majority of HCBS are provided\nby other payers, primarily the Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services and state governments,\nthrough both Medicaid and non-Medicaid state\nfunding. At the 2002 VA budget-estimated average\nper diem cost of all HCBS programs ($41/day),\nproviding all projected HCBS in 2002 would have\nhome/skilled nursing facility budget line was nearly\nDiscussion\nProjected use for long-term-care services will grow\nsubstantially over the next decade, by 22% and 24%\nfor nursing home and HCBS services, respectively.\nAlmost all of this growth will be driven by the\nincreasing share of frail, enrolled veterans older than\nage 85. Although much of this growth is dependent\non enrollment projections (transitioning of elderly\nveterans into VHA), the total population of veterans\naged 85 and older will double. As found with\npharmaceutical coverage, where VHA provided\naccess to services difficult or costly to obtain through\nMedicare, enrollments may increase faster than\nprojections. Long-term care, like pharmaceuticals\nprior to the Medicare Modernization Act of 2004, is\na significant area poorly covered and poorly co-\nordinated under Medicare.\nAlthough enrolled veterans tend to be somewhat\nmore disabled than non-enrolled veterans, those\nyounger than 65 have more disability, but those aged\n65 and older are only slightly more disabled than\ntheir non-enrolled counterparts. Similarly, when\ncompared in terms of service use employing the\n1999 NLTCS cohort, they tend to use long-term-care\nservices at rates similar to those of their counterparts\nmatched on age/gender/marital status/disability\nlevel. For HCBS, this may represent access difficul-\nties for those younger than 65 due to limited\ncoverage outside of Medicaid.\nFactors other than cost drive the use of long-term\nnursing home care. The creation of a mandatory\nnursing home benefit for one priority group in the\nMillennium Act was associated with use of that\nbenefit by nearly 63% of the estimated eligible\nveterans using nursing home care. Although less than\nexpected, this shows a substantial response to low-\ncost long-term care but also indicates that other\nfactors are important in the choice of long-term-care\nprovider.\nGrowth in assisted living facilities has been\ndramatic in the community but not available in\nVHA. Currently, assisted living represents nearly\n15% of what was previously the nursing home\npopulation, suggesting that if VHA relies on de-\nclining nursing home use rates in planning supply of\nnursing home beds, it must consider the expanding\nshare of assisted living as offsetting that decline.\nThe amount of HCBS used by enrolled veterans,\nincluding skilled and nonskilled formal care, is\nsubstantial. Currently, those HCBS programs are\nbeing supported by a number of other payers,\nalthough community long-term-care services have\nproblems with gaps, continuity, and coordination\namong providers. This large projected use, and\npresent patchwork of programs may provide oppor-\ntunities for VHA to leverage its funding to organize\nindividual patches into an all-inclusive quilt (Kino-\nReferences\nFreedman, V.
