Up to now the focus has mainly been\non the quantitative dimension of motivation (Silva et al.,\n2008). Deci and Ryan with the self-determination theory\n(SDT) emphasize the importance of motivation quality\ntheory proposes that the regulation of a behavior may take\nmany forms that correspond to different behavioral regula-\ntory styles according to motivation differing by their self-\ndetermination level, and which can be differentiated along\na continuum. Moreover, according to the SDT, different\nself-determined regulatory styles are associated with vari-\nous consequences. In fact, self-determined forms of moti-\nvation are associated with positive consequences and least\nself-determined forms of motivation with more negative\nconsequences. Another key postulate from the SDT\naddresses the processes that facilitate internalization of\nnon-self-determined regulatory styles toward more self-\ndetermined regulatory styles (Deci and Ryan, 1985; Ryan\nand Deci, 2000) if supportive conditions are in place, that\nis, a context that fosters satisfaction of three basic psycho-\nlogical needs which are autonomy, competence, and relat-\nedness. In regard to the regulation of eating behaviors,\nprevious studies showed that behaviors regulated by self-\ndetermined motivation promote adoption of healthy eating\nbehaviors and long-term maintenance of healthy eating\ncould also be a protective factor against social pressures\nunfavorable to healthy eating behaviors (Mask and\nEvidence suggests that a person will be more likely to\ndevelop and maintain more self-determined motivation in a\ncontext that is autonomy-supportive (Deci et al., 1994;\nEffects of a nutritional intervention\nprogram based on the self-determination\ntheory and promoting the Mediterranean\ndiet\nVicky Leblanc, Catherine B\u00e9gin, Anne-Marie Hudon,\nMarie-Michelle Royer, Louise Corneau, Sylvie Dodin\nand Simone Lemieux\n Keywords\neating, eating behavior, education, gender, health promotion, theory\nLaval University, Canada\nCorresponding author:\nSimone Lemieux, Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods, Laval\nEmail: Simone.Lemieux@fsaa.ulaval.ca\nIntervention Study\n2 Health Psychology Open \nWilliams et al., 2006). Autonomy support refers to eliciting\nand acknowledging a person's perspectives and values, sup-\nporting initiatives, offering options, and providing relevant\ninformation while minimizing persuasion and control\n(Resnicow and McMaster, 2012). Development of autonomy-\nsupportive nutritional approaches aimed to promote self-\ndetermined motivation seems promising in the context of\nprevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) since sustained\nhealthy dietary changes can improve many risk factors.\nBenefits of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on health\nis well established in the literature, and the MedDiet is now\nrecognized as one of the best models of food patterns pro-\nviding protection against chronic diseases, such as CVD\nto adopt the MedDiet principles among non-Mediterranean\npopulation has been previously reported, maintenance of\ndietary changes remains a challenge on the long term\nimproved by considering motivational factors related to\neating regulation.\nIt has been reported that differences between men and\nwomen exist with respect to eating habits (Arganini et al.,\nmotivational factors related to eating regulation need to be\nexamined and considered within nutritional approaches to\nimprove their efficacy. In this sense, gender differences in\nthe level of eating-related self-determined motivation were\npreviously reported, with women reporting higher level of\nself-determined motivation than men (Leblanc et al., 2015a).\nHowever, potential differences between men and women\nrelated to changes in self-determined motivation in response\nto a nutritional intervention based on the SDT remain\nunknown.\nOnly few studies examined self-determined motivation\nin a dietary context. More importantly, none has focused on\ngender differences in the impact of a nutritional interven-\ntion aimed at increasing self-determined motivation. The\nobjective of this study was therefore to determine gender\ndifferences in short- and long-term effects of a 12-week\nnutritional intervention program based on the SDT and pro-\nmoting the adoption of the MedDiet on changes in eating-\nrelated self-determined motivation and in adherence to the\nMedDiet.\nMethodology\nParticipants\nThis study was conducted among a sample of 64 men and\nyears\nand recruited through different media advertisements in the\nQu\u00e9bec City Metropolitan area, Canada. In women, a folli-\ncle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurement was per-\nformed if needed (e.g. when women presented periods\nirregularities) to confirm the premenopausal status\nhad to present slightly elevated low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, that is, between 3.0\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio 5, and at\nleast one of the four following criteria of the metabolic syn-\ndrome (NCEP ATP III, 2002): (1) triglyceride concentra-\nmmol/L, (2) fasting glycemia between 6.1 and\nmmol/L, (3) blood pressure measurements\nmm\nHg, and (4) waist circumference 80cm in\ncm in men (International Diabetes\nFederation, 2006). Participants also had to have a stable\nbody weight (\u00b12.5kg) for a minimum of 3months prior to\nthe beginning of the study and to be involved in food pur-\nchases and/or preparation at home. Men and women who\nhad cardiovascular events and used medication that could\naffect dependent variables under study, that is, hyperten-\nsion, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, were excluded. Pregnant\nwomen, smokers, participants with an alcoholism history,\nor with a high Mediterranean score (Medscore>29, that is,\nfood pattern already highly concordant with the MedDiet)\n(Goulet et al., 2003) were also excluded. All participants\nvoluntarily agreed to participate in the research project and\nwritten informed consent was obtained from all men and\nwomen prior to their participation in the study. This study\nwas approved by the \"Laval University\" Research Ethics\nCommittee. Previous publications using data from those\nparticipants examined gender differences in dietary, anthro-\npometric, and metabolic changes (Leblanc et al., 2014;\nLeblanc et al., 2015b), but did not assess motivational\nmechanism through which those changes occurred follow-\ning a nutritional intervention based on SDT within a gender\nperspective.\nStudy design\nThe 12-week nutritional program was based on the SDT.\nThis theory relies on the quality of the motivation that regu-\nlates behaviors and lies on a continuum from lower to\nhigher self-determined motivation forms (extending from\namotivation to intrinsic motivation) (Ryan and Deci, 2000)\n(Figure 1). Dietitians who provided the intervention used a\nmotivational interviewing (MI) approach. MI is a practical\nset of intervention strategies well-developed and field-\ntested in the context of clinical interventions (Resnicow\nand McMaster, 2012) and is largely consistent with SDT\npremises on motivation and lasting behavior change. MI\nhas been used to test SDT constructs (Patrick and Williams,\nconducted into small groups (from January 2010 to\nNovember 2012), and the nutritional intervention included\nthree group sessions, three individual sessions, and four\nfollow-up phone calls with a registered dietitian (Figure 2).\nThree registered dietitians were trained to provide a stand-\nardized intervention, and participants always met with the\nLeblanc et al. 3\nsame dietitian during individual sessions. The first group\nsession was a lecture, always provided by the same dietitian\nand aiming at explaining principles of the traditional\nMedDiet (length: 2.5\nAt week 4, men and women actively participated in a\n3-hour Mediterranean cooking lesson during which they\nhad to cook a Mediterranean meal (n=8\u00ad14 participants/\ngroup). At week 8, they shared a 3-hour Mediterranean pot-\nluck dinner aimed at discussing barriers met in adopting\ndietary recommendations since the beginning of the inter-\nvention (n\n=\n5\u00ad12 participants/group). Face-to-face indi-\nvidual counseling took place at weeks 1, 5, and 10 and\nlasted between 45minutes and 1hour for each appointment.\nIndividual follow-up phone calls took place at weeks 3, 6,\nminutes. The\nmain objective of face-to-face individual counseling and\nfollow-up phone calls was to assess dietary changes and to\ndetermine progressive personal goals with potential and\nFigure 1.

Description of the 12-week nutritional intervention program and measurements performed at baseline (t=0), after\nthe end of the intervention (t=3months), and then at 3-month and 6-month after the end of the intervention (t=6months and\nt=9months, respectively).\n4 Health Psychology Open \nrealistic strategies aimed at improving the adherence to\nMedDiet principles. In accordance with the SDT (Ryan and\nDeci, 2000), basic psychological needs (i.e. autonomy,\ncompetence, and relatedness) were supported during the\nnutritional intervention in order to increase self-determined\nmotivation. More specifically, competence was promoted\nduring the lecture aimed at increasing nutritional and health\nknowledge of individuals by presenting key principles of\nthe traditional MedDiet (group session 1), and during the\nMediterranean cooking lesson by actively involving indi-\nviduals in the preparation of different Mediterranean foods\nand exploring with them different tastes and ways to\nincrease variety in cooking methods, foods seasoning, and\nso on (group sessions 2 and 3). Autonomy of men and\nwomen was promoted as they had to choose their own die-\ntary objectives during individual counseling sessions, the\nbest strategies to reach their objectives, as well as to iden-\ntify actions to overcome potential barriers related to dietary\nchanges. Men and women were also responsible to choose\ntheir own progress speed toward dietary changes during the\nintervention. Relatedness was fostered by the dietitian dur-\ning all individual counseling sessions and follow-up phone\ncalls by considering individual's social and family contexts\nin facilitating factors and barriers toward dietary changes,\nand also in group sessions by promoting sharing about dif-\nficulties and strategies among participants. Different tools\ncongruent with the SDT tenets were used during these ses-\nsions to formulate dietary objectives while increasing self-\ndetermined motivation. More precisely, the decisional\nbalance allowed assessment of pros and cons of keeping\ndietary habits stable as well as pros and cons of changing\ndietary habits. The action plan was used to determine con-\ncrete dietary objectives, that is, the starting point for the\nchange, frequency of adoption of the behavior, perceived\nbenefits from the behavior change, main strategies consid-\nered to achieve the change, actions planned to overcome\nbarriers, and potential people who would support them into\ntheir process of dietary changes. The dietitian had a client-\ncentered approach and put no pressure on participants about\nthe type of dietary objectives to be chosen. In addition, no\nemphasis was put on body weight control. Men and women\nwere encouraged to maintain dietary changes in an autono-\nmous way at the end of the nutritional program, and there\nwas no additional contact with the dietitian after the end of\nthe 12-week intervention.\nMeasurements of dependent variables\nAll measurements were performed before (t=0) and after\nthe 12-week nutritional intervention program (t=3months),\nmonths after the end of the nutritional\nintervention (t=6months and t=9months, respectively).\nMotivational variables.The regulation of eating behaviors\nquestionnaire that assesses self-determined motivation for\nthe regulation of eating behaviors. Items included in this\nquestionnaire (four items per self-determined regulatory\nstyles) assess intrinsic motivation (e.g. \"I like to find new\nways to create meals that are good for my health\"), differ-\nent self-determined regulatory styles which are integrated\n(e.g. \"Eating healthy is an integral part of my life\"), identi-\nfied (e.g. \"I believe it will eventually allow me to feel bet-\nter\"), introjected (e.g. \"I feel I must absolutely be thin\"),\nexternal (e.g. \"Other people close to me insist that I do\"),\nand amotivation (e.g. \"I don't know why I bother\"). Evalu-\nation of the internal consistency of the subscales revealed\nto be adequate (Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.79 to\n7-point Likert scale, which allows calculation of the self-\ndetermination index (SDI) (Vallerand, 1997), specific to\neating regulation.\nHealth care climate.The Health Care Climate Question-\nnaire is a 15-item validated questionnaire (Williams and\nDeci, 2001) which assesses clients'perception of the degree\nto which their practitioner is autonomy-supportive. In our\nstudy, the word \"practitioner\" was replaced by the word\n\"dietitian.\" Cronbach's alpha reliability for the 15 items of\nthis questionnaire has consistently been above 0.90 (Wil-\nliams and Deci, 2001). This scale includes three dimen-\nsions considered essential for an optimally supportive\nhealth care context, which reflect autonomy support (e.g. \"I\nfeel that the dietitian has provided me choices and options\"),\ninvolvement (e.g. \"The dietitian handles peoples' emotions\nvery well\"), and structure (e.g. \"The dietitian has made sure\nI understand the links between foods and health and which\ndietary changes I can do to improve my diet\"). Each item is\nmeasured on a 7-point scale (from disagree to strongly\nagree) and allows calculation of a global score (range=15\u00ad\n105), with a higher average score representing a higher\nlevel of perceived autonomy support.\nDietary variables. A validated food frequency questionnaire\n(FFQ) (Goulet et al., 2004) was administered by a regis-\ntered dietitian. The FFQ is based on typical foods available\nin Qu\u00e9bec and contains 91 items and 33 subquestions. Par-\nticipants were questioned about the frequency of intake of\ndifferent foods and drinks during the last month and could\nreport the frequency of these intakes in terms of day, week,\nor month. As previously described (Goulet et al., 2003), the\nMedscore was calculated based on the FFQ and allowed to\nassess the level of adherence to the Mediterranean food pat-\ntern, which could vary between 0 and 44 points. Compo-\nnents of the Medscore are as follows: grains (whole and\nrefined); fruits (whole and juices); vegetables (whole and\njuices); legumes, nuts, and seeds; olive oil (including\nolives); dairy products; fish (including seafoods); poultry;\neggs; sweets; and red meat/processed meat. Briefly, a high\nconsumption of food groups promoted by the MedDiet\nLeblanc et al. 5\n(bottom of the pyramid) (e.g. legumes) contributed to\nincrease the Medscore, whereas a high consumption of\nfood groups at the top of the Mediterranean pyramid (e.g.\nred meat) contributed to decrease the Medscore, as previ-\nAnthropometric and metabolic profile. According to standard-\nized procedures (Lohman et al., 1988), height was meas-\nured to the nearest millimeter with a stadiometer (Seca 222\nMechanical Telescopic Stadiometer), body weight was\nmeasured to the nearest 0.1\nkg on a calibrated balance\n(BWB-800S Digital scale, Tanita), and body mass index\n(BMI) was then calculated. Waist circumference measure\nwas also taken to the nearest millimeter according to stand-\nardized procedures (Lohman et al., 1988). Blood lipids and\nglucose level were measured after a 12-hour overnight fast.\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were performed using SAS statistical software\n(version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). The Student's\nt-test allowed comparisons of baseline characteristics, and\nalso the health care climate, between men and women.\nMotivational variables measured are presented as\nmeans\u00b1standard deviations for the baseline value but oth-\nerwise as changes\u00b1standard deviations. Mixed models for\nrepeated measurements, which allow the inclusion of par-\nticipants with missing data at some time points (Beunckens\net al., 2005), were performed to determine gender, time,\nand gender by time interaction effects on changes in\ndependent variables measured (delta values). Delta values\nwere calculated as post-nutritional intervention values\n(post-nutritional intervention minus pre-nutritional inter-\nvention values) and as follow-up values at t=6months\n(6months minus pre-nutritional intervention values) and at\nt=9months (9months minus pre-nutritional intervention\nvalues), respectively. Using this approach, a significant\ntime effect means that the magnitude of the change is vary-\ning with time, while a non-significant time effect means\nthat changes are maintained with time. Moreover, a signifi-\ncant gender by time interaction means that the trajectory of\nchanges with time is not the same in men and women. The\nLsmean procedure, which can be defined as a linear combi-\nnation (sum) of the estimated effects, for example, means,\nfrom a linear model and based on the model used, allowed\ndetermining significant changes in outcomes over time\nwithin each gender. Pairwise differences between and\nwithin gender were further tested with the Tukey\u00adKramer\nadjustment. Pearson's correlation analyses were performed\nto examine associations between eating-related SDI, adher-\nence to the Medscore and BMI, in men and women sepa-\nrately.Afterwards, covariance analyses (Lsmean procedure)\nwere performed to determine whether an interaction\nbetween gender and changes in eating-related SDI explains\nchanges in the Medscore, and whether or not this relation\nremains the same after controlling for baseline eating-\nrelated SDI. For variables not normally distributed, a trans-\nformation was performed, but these variables are presented\nas raw data in the tables. For determination of sample size,\nwe considered a difference of 35\npercent in the change in\nMedscore as being clinically significant, based on previous\nresults (Goulet et al., 2003). Therefore, a final sample size\nof 45 men and 45 women was needed to detect a difference\nof 35percent in the change in Medscore between men and\nthat standard deviation corresponds to 55\npercent of the\nmean of the change in Medscore. The probability level for\nsignificance used for the interpretation of all statistical\nanalyses was set at an alpha level of p0.05.\nResults\nTable 1 shows characteristics of men and women at base-\nline.

Similarly, a\ntrend for larger changes was observed in integrated regulatory\nstyle in men than in women in response to the intervention\nand at follow-up (gender effect, p=0.08). However, for these\nvariables, the magnitude of change decreased with time (time\neffects, p\n=\nintegrated regulation). Significant changes in intrinsic moti-\nvation were observed in both men and women in response to\nthe intervention, but no gender difference was observed.\nMoreover, this variable tended to return toward baseline val-\nues during follow-up (time effect, p=0.08). Although signifi-\ncant decreases in amotivation were observed in response to\nthe nutritional intervention in men only, no gender difference\nwas observed, and this variable progressively returned toward\nbaseline values during follow-up in both men and women\n(time effect, p\n=\n0.002). No gender by time interaction was\nobserved for changes in eating-related SDI nor its different\nsubscales, meaning that trajectories of changes during the\nfollow-up were not significantly different between men and\nwomen. When changes in eating-related SDI and its sub-\nscales of regulatory styles were adjusted for the baseline\nvalue of the response variable, significant gender differences\nand trend for gender differences initially observed all became\nnon-significant.\nAs for changes in adherence to the MedDiet, a significant\nincrease was observed in the Medscore in men and women in\nresponse to the nutritional intervention and at follow-up\nbaseline, after the 12-week nutritional intervention, at\nt=6months and t=9months, respectively), but without gen-\nder differences (gender effect, p=0.25). However, the\nMedscore progressively returned toward baseline values\nduring the follow-up in men and women with a significant\ntime effect (time effect, p<0.0001). Moreover, no gender by\ntime interaction was observed for the Medscore, meaning\nthat trajectories of changes during the follow-up were the\nsame in men and women (gender by time interaction,\np\n=\n0.42). Regarding changes in BMI, significant decreases\nwere observed in both men and women after the end of the\nnutritional intervention and at follow-up (30.8\n\u00b1\nt=3months, t=6months, and t=9months, respectively), but\nno gender differences were found (gender effect, p=0.18).\nPattern of associations between eating-related\nSDI and adherence to the MedDiet according to\ngender, in response to the 12-week intervention\nand at follow-up\nIn men, a significant and positive association was found\nbetween changes in eating-related SDI and changes in the\nMedscore in response to the intervention (r=0.41,\np\n=\n0.002), as well as between changes observed in these\na trend for a negative association between changes in eat-\nwas observed in response to the intervention in men, and\nthis negative association was significant for changes meas-\n=\nassociation was observed between changes in eating-related\nSDI and changes in the Medscore measured either at the\nciation was found between changes in eating-related SDI\nand changes in BMI in response to the intervention in\nwomen, a significant and negative association was observed\nbetween changes in these variables measured at t=9months\nAdditional analyses were performed to further docu-\nment the differences observed between men and women in\nthe association between changes in SDI and changes in the\nMedscore. Accordingly, a significant interaction was\nobserved between gender and changes in eating-related\nSDI in the determination of changes in the Medscore in\nresponse to the intervention (interaction, p=0.02). In order\nto verify if higher baseline level of eating-related SDI found\nin women would contribute to explain this interaction (i.e.\nLeblanc et al. 7\ndifferences between men and women in the association\nbetween changes in SDI and changes in the Medscore),\nbaseline level of eating-related SDI was added to the model\nof covariance. It was found that the interaction between\ngender and changes in eating-related SDI in the determina-\ntion of changes in the Medscore remains significant despite\nTable 2.

Results indicate\nthat men and women perceived the motivational approach\nas autonomy-supportive in a similar manner although it led\nto larger increases in self-determined motivation in men\nthan in women. Moreover, increases in eating-related self-\ndetermined motivation were associated with increases in\nadherence to the MedDiet in men only.\nChanges observed in eating-related self-determined\nmotivation evolved in a similar direction in men and women\nas no gender by time interaction was observed. However,\nlarger increases in eating-related self-determined motiva-\ntion were observed in men than in women in response to the\n12-week intervention and at follow-up. The SDT posits that\na context fostering satisfaction of autonomy, competence,\nand relatedness is essential in promoting self-determined\nAccordingly, different aspects of our nutritional interven-\ntion aimed at promoting satisfaction of these psychological\nneeds. More precisely, competence of men and women was\npromoted by the Mediterranean cooking lesson, the\nMediterranean potluck dinner, and by nutritional informa-\ntion and practical tools discussed during individual and\ngroup sessions. The need for relatedness was fostered by\nthe development of a relationship based on trust, considera-\ntion, and collaboration between the dietitian and the partici-\npant, by the group cohesion promoted between participants\nduring group sessions and also by the consideration of\nimportant others in the action plan for dietary changes.\nThen, autonomy was supported when individuals had to\ndetermine their personal dietary objectives, the best strate-\ngies regarding the objectives, and the key factors to over-\ncome barriers. Moreover, recipes and nutritional tools were\nnot automatically provided to individuals but rather given\naccording to individuals' needs.\nIn regard to the impact of our intervention in men and\nwomen, factors that can explain why women did not\nincrease their level of eating-related self-determined moti-\nvation as much as men, such as level of eating-related self-\ndetermined motivation at baseline, need to be considered.\nIndeed, as women reported higher level of eating-related\nself-determined motivation than men at baseline, room for\nimprovement in motivation could have been more limited\nfor women than men. In this regard, the adjustment for the\nbaseline value of the response variable indicated that if a\nsimilar level of eating-related self-determined motivation\nat baseline had been observed in men and women, no sig-\nnificant gender difference would have been found in\nchanges in eating-related self-determined motivation. In\naddition, despite the fact that men and women perceived\nthe intervention as similarly autonomy-supportive, it can be\nhypothesized that gender differences exist in the level of\nneed satisfaction for autonomy, competence, and related-\nness specific to the dietary context. However, to our knowl-\nedge, no validated questionnaire allows assessment of the\nsatisfaction of the psychological needs specific to the die-\ntary context. Moreover, a better understanding of the impact\nof the health care climate in men and women on changes in\neating-related self-determined motivation could be\nachieved in future studies by assessing perceived level of\nsatisfaction of the psychological needs at different time\npoints of an intervention. Indeed, data from a recent quali-\ntative study in the field of physical activity reported that\nsatisfaction of the needs for competence and relatedness\nwere essential during the phase of adoption of the exercise\nbehavior, while satisfaction of autonomy had more impact\nTable 3.

Those\nresults suggest that stages of development of these needs\nmight differ and should be considered in order to facilitate\ninternalization of non-self-determined regulatory styles\ntoward more self-determined regulatory styles. In addition,\nthe idea of monitoring people on a daily basis using an\necological momentary assessment technique could be\ninteresting as previous studies reported within-person fluc-\ntuations in psychological need satisfaction (Verstuyf et al.,\nThe fact that eating-related self-determined motivation\nreturned toward baseline values in both men and women\nunderlines the difficulty to maintain motivation changes.\nweeks of intervention aimed to internalize\nmotivational factors related to the adoption of a diet of\nbetter quality, the transition between the end of the inter-\nvention program and the follow-up period and the com-\nplete absence of support during the follow-up seem to\nrepresent critical points to consider. Moreover, intrinsic\nmotivation, that is, highest level of eating-related self-\ndetermined motivation and which refers to undertaking an\nactivity for its inherent interest and enjoyment, might be\nmore difficult to maintain than other types of motivation\nThis can partly be explained by the fact that the delay to\ninternalize intrinsic motivation might have been insuffi-\ncient. It is also possible that attempts to maintain dietary\nintakes were directed more to other outcomes such as to\nimprove health condition or decrease body weight, which\ncould have thwarted the intrinsic motivation toward\nchanging dietary habits per se (e.g. for the interest and\npleasure of eating or preparing food according to the\nMedDiet) (Verstuyf et al., 2012). Although the magnitude\nof the changes in eating-related self-determined motiva-\ntion also decreased with time among men, level of moti-\nvation remained significantly higher than at baseline,\nsuggesting a non-negligible impact from the nutritional\nintervention program on motivational factors. In addition,\nprevious results demonstrate that our intervention based\non a motivational approach had a beneficial impact on the\nadoption of healthy dietary intakes and risk factors for\nCVD such as waist circumference and lipid profile, more\nparticularly in men (Leblanc et al., 2014).\nTo our knowledge, assessment of the influence of\nchanges in motivation on changes in the adherence to the\nMedDiet according to gender is a novelty in the literature.\nWe found that an increase in eating-related self-determined\nmotivation was associated with an increase in the adher-\nence to the MedDiet in response to the 12-week interven-\ntion as well as at follow-up, in men but not in women.\nMoreover, additional analyses revealed that differences\nfound between men and women in the association between\nchanges in motivation and changes in adherence to the\nMedDiet may not be explained by gender differences in\nthe level of eating-related self-determined motivation at\nbaseline. This suggests that other gender-related factors are\ninvolved to explain these differences in the pattern of asso-\nciations between eating-related self-determined motivation\nand adherence to the MedDiet. Those factors may be related\nto eating-related attitudes, behaviors and norms, societal\nrole, and responsibilities attributed to men and women\n(Institute of Gender and Health, 2012; Wang and Worsley,\n2014).Although these factors were not specifically assessed\nin our study, some components of the nutritional interven-\ntion program may have better suited men than women.\nPrevious studies indicate that men are more ambivalent\nthan women toward healthy eating choices (Povey et al.,\nesis that tools used in our intervention and aimed at increas-\ning eating-related self-determined motivation such as the\ndecisional balance might have been more beneficial for\nmen than women.\nAs no previous study assessed gender differences in\nchanges in eating-related self-determined motivation, sev-\neral hypotheses remain to be verified in the future regard-\ning basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence,\nand relatedness in the dietary context and potential modera-\ntors in the association between changes in motivation and\nchanges in dietary intakes to allow a better understanding\nof the influence of the quality of the motivation in the con-\ntext of healthy eating in both men and women. The fact that\nmen and women recruited in our study were middle-aged\nadults and presented specific characteristics regarding\nCVD risk limits the generalization of our results to the\nwhole population. Moreover, although missing data could\ncontribute to overestimate changes found at follow-up in\nself-determined motivation in men and women, gender dif-\nferences observed are unlikely to be influenced by this pos-\nsible bias since the attrition rate was the same in men and\nwomen. Nevertheless, this study has important strengths\nand clinical implications that need to be mentioned. Our\nnutritional education program was developed based on the\nSDT, which facilitated and guided our methods of interven-\ntion. Moreover, this study design allowed the assessment of\nlong-term impact of a nutritional intervention, during which\nindividuals were actively involved in the process of dietary\nchanges followed by a 6-month period with no additional\nsupport provided which can be more representative of a\nreal-life setting. Our results showed that a nutritional inter-\nvention program promoting active involvement of individ-\nuals in the determination of dietary changes and strategies\nhad a positive impact on eating-related self-determined\nmotivation, which in turn contributed to improve the level\nof adherence to the MedDiet in men only. As a matter of\nfact, motivational factors seem to be an important target of\nintervention in the context of dietary changes in men. As\nfor women, our results suggest that other factors may have\npossibly interfered in the association between motivational\nchanges and changes in adherence to the MedDiet, and thus\nindicate that health professionals should explore factors\n10 Health Psychology Open \nbesides motivation to properly support women in the con-\ntext of dietary changes.\nOverall, although both men and women increased their\nadherence to the MedDiet in response to the nutritional\nintervention, results indicate that the nutritional interven-\ntion program aimed at promoting eating-related self-deter-\nmined motivation in order to improve the quality of the diet\nseems to fit better men than women as changes in eating-\nrelated self-determined motivation were associated with\nincreases in adherence to the MedDiet in men only.\n"
