Why do some studies report a negative relationship between religious service attendance and functional\nlimitations? Two possible mechanisms, the health benefit mechanism and the functional barrier mechanism, were sys-\ntematically examined.\nMethods. With 2 waves of a national probability sample of adults aged 60 years and older, this research used struc-\ntural equation models to estimate the influence of these 2 mechanisms.\nResults. Results indicated that functional limitations were associated with less frequent religious service attendance\nat the same wave, largely because of the barrier mechanism; no support was found for the benefit mechanism. Neither\nmechanism was significant over time.\nDiscussion. Findings suggest that there is a temporal and salient decline in social activities such as religious service\nattendance when lower body functional limitations are highest. However, long-term engagement in religious service at-\ntendance is not predicted by baseline functional limitations, indicating that there are not long-term declines in attendance\nbecause of higher levels of functional limitations.\nHE role that religion plays in health, long neglected in\nscholarly research, has drawn considerable attention in\nthe past decade. A good portion of the research has revealed\na positive relationship between religion and health among\nolder people, but the precise mechanisms that explain this\nrelationship remain to be clarified.\nParticipation in a religious group has been shown to have\nhealth benefits. For instance, older adults who attend regu-\nHowever, some scholars have argued that experiencing seri-\nous health problems can actually be a barrier to religious\nparticipation (Ainlay, Singleton, & Swigert, 1992; Barusch,\n1999). Thus, adults with greater physical limitations may be\nunable or less willing to attend religious services, leaving\nthe more healthy adults in the religious group. As Levin and\nhealth and religious attendance may, in reality, represent\ncorrelations between health and functional health (i.e., the\ncapability to get out of bed and go to services).\"\nThere may be two processes at work: the benefit mecha-\nnism and the barrier mechanism. Persons who are active in\nreligious groups may receive health benefits through that\nparticipation, which is considered the benefit mechanism.\nHowever, functional limitations may be a barrier to frequent\nor even regular activity within the religious group. It is pos-\nsible that both processes occur simultaneously. Participation\nin religious groups may spur better functional health, but\nthis may only occur for those who are healthy enough to\nparticipate in the first place. Most empirical research to date\nhas focused only on the benefit mechanism and has been de-\nrived from a cross-sectional research design.\nOur purpose in the present research was to consider the\nlink between religious service attendance and functional\nlimitations by systematically examining whether both bene-\nfit and barrier mechanisms are at work--and if so, which is\nstronger. We used longitudinal data from a national proba-\nbility community sample to examine the competing influ-\nences of functional limitations and religious service atten-\ndance among older adults. We used structural equation\nmodels to test simultaneously the effects of religious service\nattendance as a benefit mechanism and functional limita-\ntions as a barrier mechanism across time.\nFunctional Limitations and Religious Attendance\nMany researchers have reported that the practice of reli-\ngion has salutary effects on health for individuals (Ainlay et\nStrock, Okun, & Haring, 1985), especially older persons\ngroup can have health benefits including lower risk of mor-\ntality (Strawbridge, Cohen, Shema, & Kaplan, 1997), less\ndepression (Koenig et al., 1997), and better overall mental\nMost of the research on the effect of religious participa-\ntion on physical health has focused on subjective health\nJensen, 1991). The relationship between religious service\nattendance and subjective health has been well documented\nin both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses (Ellison,\nT\nlarly attend religious services are more likely to rate their\nhealth better.\nA much smaller body of research on religion and physical\nhealth has demonstrated that religious service attendance in-\nfluences functional limitations, with attendance providing a\nprotective effect (Idler & Kasl, 1997b). Using the New Ha-\nven sample of the multiwave Established Populations for\nEpidemiologic Studies of the Elderly, Idler and Kasl exam-\nined the effect of religious service attendance on functional\ndisability over time. The effect may be temporary for those\nexperiencing health decline, but religious service attendance\nand functional disability are negatively correlated. This\nmeans that those who attend religious services more fre-\nquently tend to have fewer functional limitations. This study\nused a sample of a single community, however, and no at-\ntention was given to the simultaneous effect of physical\nfunction on service attendance.\nIn considering this negative association between func-\ntional limitations and religious service attendance, the liter-\nature suggests two separate mechanisms for the relation-\nship. The first is the benefit mechanism, described by Idler\nhave argued that the experience of religious participation,\nmanifested in fellowship, ritual, and ideology, is beneficial\nto health, thereby decreasing the risk of functional limita-\nThe exact reasons why religion positively affects physi-\ncal health have been systematically studied and, despite dif-\nferences in samples and measurement, have produced\nStrawbridge et al., 2001). Activity within a religious group\nmay provide social support from other group members,\nwhich has been demonstrated to buffer the effect of stres-\nsors on health, including functional limitations (Newsom &\ngious ideology may offer positive coping mechanisms,\nwhich would help provide meaning for existing pain (Ko-\ntarba, 1983). Research has shown that individuals who use\npositive religious coping tend to have better health or are\nbetter able to control pain from chronic conditions (Keefe et\nsome religious groups have proscriptive behavior norms, in-\ncluding abstention from alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and\nmeat. Active, committed members may be more likely to\nfollow these norms as a demonstration of their faith, simul-\ntaneously avoiding many potentially disabling health prob-\nlems such as heart disease, stroke, and diabetes (Levin &\nFor the benefit mechanism, the causal ordering places\nservice attendance before functional limitations, positing\nthat religion has a salutary effect on health. This interpreta-\ntion has been offered repeatedly, but some have argued that\nconclusions about the salutary effects of religious atten-\ndance on health may be overstated because the second mech-\nanism has not been considered (Levin & Vanderpool, 1987).\nThe second mechanism posits that functional limitations\nhinder participation in religious social life; disabled persons\nmay have a difficult time getting to and sitting through reli-\ngious services. Functional limitations may not hamper par-\nticipation in meditative and mystical dimensions of religios-\nity, but especially for older people, functional limitations\nmay make attendance at religious services a difficult experi-\nence (e.g., rituals requiring kneeling or standing for long pe-\nriods of time, inability to dress oneself to go to services).\nWhether functional limitations impede social participation\nin religious activities has been studied by several research-\ners, but only cross-sectionally (Ainlay et al., 1992; Barusch,\n1999). However, they found that higher levels of functional\nlimitations were associated with lower religious participation.\nPersons with moderate to severe levels of functional limi-\ntations may face a variety of obstacles such as stairs, manual\ndoors, or standard-sized parking spaces, which may be\nphysical barriers to social engagement. Even before arriving\nat the place of worship, functional limitations may prevent\nan older adult from buttoning a shirt or brushing hair. Older\nadults often experience an increase in functional limitations\nbecause of chronic illness. Even among older adults who\nbelieve they do not have a disability, 21% can be classified\nas disabled according to activities of daily living measure-\nments--and another 40% have mild or moderate disability\n(Langlois et al., 1996). Often these persons who believe\nthey do not have a disability attribute their limited mobility\nand inability to perform daily functions to \"old age\" or \"get-\nNevertheless, older adults tend to have stronger religious\nbeliefs and higher levels of participation in religious activities\ncompared with younger adults (Moberg, 1997). At a time\nwhen functional limitations may be steadily limiting mobil-\nity, there are still markedly higher rates of public and private\nreligious behaviors among older adults, even those with se-\nvere functional limitations (Idler, 1987). However, other re-\nsearch has demonstrated that attendance at religious services\nwanes as functional limitations increase (Barusch, 1999).\nAlthough both the physical barrier and the health benefit\nmechanisms have been examined in previous research, we\nare unaware of any study that considered the two mecha-\nnisms simultaneously with longitudinal data. Thus, our pur-\npose in this research was to examine the two mechanisms\nsimultaneously by addressing two overarching research\nquestions. First, do functional limitations curb attendance at\nreligious services for older adults? Second, if both the bene-\nfit and the barrier mechanisms are at work, which is the\nstronger of the two? Although religious service attendance\nis only a single indicator of overall religiosity, it was the pri-\nmary outcome in this analysis because it captures the physi-\ncal act of going to a religious service. Private religious be-\nhaviors and beliefs may not vary among older adults by\nhealth status, but functional limitations could create a bar-\nrier to active social engagement at the place of worship\n(Hays et al., 1998). On the basis of previous literature, we\nexpected that the health benefits received from religious\nservice attendance would outweigh the negative effect of\nfunctional limitations on attendance.\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe data used in this study were from Americans' Chang-\ning Lives (ACL), a national multistage probability sample\nin the continental United States, directed by House (1990).\nwith an oversample of African Americans and persons aged\n60 years and older. In this study we used a subsample of\nadults who were aged 60 years and older and were not insti-\ntutionalized or living in group quarters (N  1,617). The\nbaseline data were collected in 1986 and the respondents\n1 (W1) and Wave 2 (W2), respectively. These data were\nideal for this analysis because they provided a nationally\nrepresentative sample of adults aged 60 and older who were\nfollowed up almost 3 years later. The survey also included\nrepeated measures of both religious service attendance and\nfunctional limitations.\nBoth waves of the ACL occurred before the 1990 Ameri-\ncans with Disabilities Act, which required facilities to be ac-\ncessible for those who have physical limitations. Religious\norganizations were among the many institutions targeted for\ntheir facilities that were disability \"unfriendly.\" The results\nfrom this study are still applicable in that religious rituals\nwith repeated standing and kneeling may not have changed,\neven if the physical plant did. Thus, even though group\nmembers may be sympathetic to older adults who have dif-\nficulty or cannot perform the activity or ritual, older individ-\nuals may still feel social embarrassment or stigma.\nMeasures\nReligious service attendance, measured at both waves,\nwas one of the endogenous variables in the analysis. It was\nmeasured by the question, \"How often do you usually attend\nreligious services?\" The six response categories at each\nwave were scored \"never\" (1), \"less than once a month\" (2),\n\"once a month\" (3), \"2\u00ad3 times a month\" (4), \"once a week\"\n(5), and \"more than once a week\" (6).\nWe included binary variables indicating religious prefer-\nence in the analysis to control for differences in religious\nservice attendance norms (these were not available at the\nfollow-up survey). Respondents were asked at baseline,\n\"What is your religious preference?\" Five response catego-\nries were available: Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Other, or\nNone. Immediately following, respondents were asked to\nidentify their specific religious group within the broad cate-\ngory. From these responses, we created several binary vari-\nables to highlight specific religious preferences, including\nJewish, conservative Protestant, Catholic, Southern Baptist,\nother Protestant, and no religious preference. Preliminary\nanalyses of these variables on both functional limitations\nand religious service attendance revealed that only two reli-\ngious preferences were significant: conservative Protestant\nand no religious preference. Conservative Protestants (27%\nof total sample) including Fundamentalist denominations\n(e.g., Church of God, Pentecostal, Assembly of God, and\nChurch of Christ) and Southern Baptists, generally had\nhigher rates of attendance. No religious preference (7% of\ntotal sample) was for all those who responded \"none\" when\nasked to specify a religion.\nThree other religion indicators were used: religious belief\nsalience, how often the respondent read religious materials,\nand how often the respondent watched or listened to reli-\ngious programming. For belief salience, respondents were\nasked, \"In general, how important are religious or spiritual\nbeliefs in your day-to-day life?\" Four response categories\nwere used: \"very important\" (4), \"fairly important\" (3), \"not\ntoo important\" (2), and \"not at all important\" (1). For the\nother two religion variables, the possible answer choices\nranged from \"never\" (1) to \"more than once a week\" (6).\nAttendance at religious services was measured with one\nitem at each wave; functional limitations, the other endoge-\nnous variable in the analysis, was a latent variable with four\nindicators at each wave. The first indicator was self-rated\nactivity limitation: \"How much are your daily activities lim-\nited in any way by your health or health-related problems?\"\nFive categories followed ranging from \"not at all\" (1) to \"a\ngreat deal\" (5). The second indicator of functional limita-\ntions was a dichotomous self-report of whether the respon-\ndent was restricted to a bed or chair all day (all others were\nzero). The final two indicators were the amount of difficulty\nthe respondent had walking blocks and the amount of diffi-\nculty the respondent had climbing stairs. The categories\nranged from \"none\" (1) to \"cannot do\" (5).\nBaseline morbidity was included as an exogenous vari-\nable. It was a sum of 10 possible health conditions, asked of\neach respondent: \"We would like to know if you have expe-\nrienced any of the following health problems during the last\n12 months. Have you had (specific condition)?\" The condi-\ntions were arthritis, stroke, foot problems, heart attack or\ntrouble, incontinence, diabetes, lung problems, hyperten-\nsion, broken bones, and cancer.\nThree indicators of social integration were included as\nexogenous variables. Research has indicated that social net-\nworks have positive effects on the availability of resources\nfor those with disabilities (Idler & Kasl, 1997a). Therefore,\nthose who are active in the community or live with another\nperson may engage in social groups differently than those\nwho are less integrated.\nThe first social integration variable was whether the re-\nspondent received help from another person or agency to\nget around the community. Although it is not explicitly\nstated in the question, this may include rides to religious\nservices. It was a binary variable, coded 1 for \"yes\" and 0\nfor \"no.\" Second, frequency of attendance at voluntary as-\nsociation meetings was measured with the question: \"How\noften do you attend meetings or programs of groups, clubs,\nor organizations that you belong to?\" Answer categories\nranged from \"never\" (1) to \"more than once a week\" (6).\nThird, respondents who lived alone were identified with a\nbinary variable.\nDepression was included as a control variable in the anal-\nysis because persons who have functional limitations may\nbe more likely to be depressed than nondisabled persons,\nand depression may also be associated with more negative\nratings of physical limitations (Ainlay et al., 1992; Frerichs,\nTurner & Noh, 1988). Depression was measured with the\nCenter for Epidemiologic Studies\u00adDepression (CES-D) short\nAdditional variables were included in the analysis as co-\nvariates. Age was measured in years (60\u00ad97). Education\nranged from \"0\u00ad8 years\" (1) to \"17 years or more\" (6). Total\nfamily income was measured with 10 categories ranging\n(Respondents were asked to point to the letter beside the\ncorrect income range.) Two status characteristics were mea-\nsured with dummy variables: Black and female, each coded\n1 for \"yes\" and 0 for \"no.\"\nTable 1 provides a list of all variables used in the analysis\nwith the coding, means, and standard deviations of the sam-\nple. Endogenous indicators are listed first, followed by the\ncovariates or exogenous indicators. A number of additional\nvariables were tested in preliminary analyses based on ordi-\nnary least squares but were deleted from further analyses\nbecause they were not significantly related to either func-\ntional limitations or religious service attendance. These\nvariables included being married, living in a southern re-\ngion, and living in a rural region.\nMethod of Analyses\nWe used structural equation models estimated with LIS-\nsquares were used as the estimation procedure because the en-\ndogenous variables were not normally distributed (Bentler &\nbased on an asymptotic covariance matrix generated from\npolychoric and polyserial correlations calculated in Prelis 2.30\nThe hypothesized model in this research was a nonrecur-\nsive model testing both the barrier and the benefit mecha-\nnisms.

No causal relationship was specified between atten-\ndance and functional limitations at W2; however, the errors\nbetween the two endogenous variables () were allowed to\ncorrelate. We first tested this simple model without the co-\nvariates to avoid interpretational confounding (Burt, 1976).\nFinally, the entire model was tested, including all of the co-\nvariates listed in Table 1.\nThe proposed model specified the barrier mechanism by\nfunctional limitations affecting attendance at baseline and\nacross time. The benefit mechanism alternatively tested the\neffect of attendance on functional limitations at baseline and\nat W2 (Idler & Kasl, 1997b). Paths across time were mea-\nsured for both functional limitations and attendance.

Table 2 shows the comparison of three\nof these models with the hypothesized model (Model 1). Al-\nternative models included a recursive system where func-\ntional limitations were specified as predicting attendance at\neach wave, but with a lagged effect of attendance (W1) on\nfunctional limitations at W2 (Model 2). The second alterna-\ntive (Model 3) specified only the lagged effects of func-\ntional limitations and religious service attendance on the\nW2 endogenous variables. The errors were correlated in the\nW1 equations and in the W2 equations. The final model was\none in which functional limitations and attendance pre-\ndicted the other at each wave and attendance (W1) was\nlagged on functional limitations at W2 (Model 4).

In addition, the\nnormed fit index was above the .90 threshold, and the com-\nway, 1998). Thus, the results from Model 1 are presented in\nthe following section. None of the alternative specifications\nprovided a better fit than Model 1.\nThe estimates for the measurement structure (\ny\n) are pre-\nsented in Table 1. The \ny\nvalue for each of the indicators\nwas greater than .80, and we placed equality constraints on\nthe functional limitations indicators across time to ensure\nconsistent measurement for change analysis (Hayduk,\n1987). We estimated elements of the off-diagonal of the\ntheta-epsilon in previous models to correlate the measure-\nment errors among the variables measured at both waves.\nOnly one correlation was significant: between activity limi-\ntations at baseline and at W2.\nParameter estimates for Model 1 are presented in Table 3.\nBecause the hypothesized baseline relationship between\nfunctional limitations and attendance was nonrecursive,\neach of the baseline endogenous variables required at least\none instrumental variable (Bollen, 1996).\nThe first equation (column 1 of Table 3) reveals that\ngreater levels of functional limitations were more common\namong those who were older and more depressed. Higher\nmorbidity was also associated with more functional limita-\ntions. As anticipated, socioeconomic status was also signifi-\ncantly related to functional limitations; lower education and\nlower income were associated with higher levels of func-\ntional limitations. Those who needed help to get around the\ncommunity were likely to have greater functional limita-\nFigure 1.

In the nonrecursive model, there was a weak\npositive relationship between baseline attendance and func-\ntional limitations--the opposite of what one would expect\nwith the benefit mechanism.\nThe second equation in Table 3 shows that stronger reli-\ngious beliefs, reading religious materials, and watching or\nlistening to religious media were associated with higher fre-\nquency of attendance at religious services. Those who vol-\nunteered frequently were also more likely to attend religious\nservices. In other words, those who engaged in religious and\nsocial activities were also likely to attend the services of a\nreligious group.\nAt baseline, the path from functional limitations to atten-\ndance was negative and significant (p  .01). As specified\nin the barrier mechanism, this meant that those who had\nhigher functional limitations were less likely to attend reli-\ngious services. Comparing the standardized slopes (not\nshown) for the two mechanisms at baseline, functional limi-\ntations had a stronger influence on attendance (.19) than\nattendance had on functional limitations (.10). This pro-\nvided clearer evidence in support of the barrier mechanism.\nThe third equation in Table 3 was for functional limita-\ntions at W2. Results showed that those who were older and\nhad higher morbidity were more likely to be disabled. Per-\nsons with more functional impairment at W1 were very\nlikely to have higher impairment at W2. The lagged effect\nof W1 attendance on W2 functional limitations was nonsig-\nnificant.\nFinally, the fourth column in Table 3 shows the equation\nfor religious service attendance at W2. Just as for atten-\ndance at W1, reading religious materials and volunteering\nfrequently were associated with higher religious service at-\ntendance. Those who attended frequently at baseline were\nmore likely to attend frequently at W2.\nAlthough the barrier mechanism was observed for the\nbaseline equation, it did not hold across time. Functional\nlimitations at W1 did not significantly affect religious ser-\nvice attendance at W2 (although the slope was in the antici-\npated direction and close to significance). The correlated er-\nror () between functional limitations and attendance at W2\nwas also nonsignificant, indicating that there was little re-\nsidual variation in the two constructs once their association\nat baseline and their W1 values were considered. The over-\nall model provided support only for functional limitations as\na barrier mechanism; no support was found for the religious\nservice attendance as a benefit mechanism among respon-\ndents of ACL.\nDISCUSSION\nTwo separate mechanisms for the relationship between\nfunctional limitations and religious service attendance have\nbeen proposed in the literature. The first is the benefit mech-\nanism. Its proponents argue that religion, and specifically\nreligious service attendance, prevents or limits the conse-\nquences of functional limitations (Idler & Kasl, 1992,\n1997b). The second mechanism views functional limitations\nas a barrier to effective social engagement, including atten-\ndance at religious services. This process identifies the influ-\nence of functional limitations on the experience of religion,\nespecially religious activity (Ainlay et al., 1992; Levin &\nWhereas much of the previous research used ordinary\nleast squares on cross-sectional data to investigate one or\nthe other of these mechanisms, this is the first study of\nTable 3.

Model estimates: \nof approximation  .00; adjusted goodness-of-fit index  .98; normed fit index  .91; comparative fit index  1.00.\nwhich we are aware to use longitudinal data to test both\nmechanisms. An advantage of this analysis is that both the\nbenefit and the barrier mechanisms were tested simulta-\nneously with structural equation models.\nTests of several recursive and nonrecursive models do\nnot offer support for the benefit mechanism. Even when at-\ntendance significantly affects functional limitations, the re-\nlationship is weak and positive rather than negative. Those\nwho attend services frequently are more likely to have\nslightly higher functional limitations. Although some may\nargue that religious service attendance is deleterious to\nfunctional ability, we think that the more reasonable inter-\npretation is that of a convergence of persons with physical\nlimitations--perhaps permanent ones--to religious settings.\nMoreover, this effect is uncovered only when the nonrecur-\nsive model is specified.\nThe conclusion is that many people with modest forms of\nfunctional limitations continue to attend religious services.\nOlder adults, who are more likely to be disabled than\nyounger adults, tend to be more religiously active and attend\nreligious services more frequently (Moberg, 1997). Reli-\ngion may be providing inspiration and meaning to those\nwith less severe forms of functional limitations.\nIn considering the lack of support for the benefit mecha-\nnism in this study, it is important to recall that these models\ndo not measure whether religious service attendance affects\nsubjective health. It is entirely possible that going to reli-\ngious services and activities has many health benefits in-\ncluding lower depression and better subjective health--but\nthat attendance has no effect on whether a respondent can\nwalk up a flight of stairs. In addition, one of the four indica-\ntors of functional limitations in this study is whether the re-\nspondent is confined to a bed or chair all day. Respondents\nwhose health has deteriorated to the point that they are no\nlonger able to get out of bed are most likely not going to be\nattending services. The significant barrier mechanism may\nbe capturing this effect.\nA second possibility for why the benefit mechanism is\nnot supported is the uniqueness of the ACL sample. The\nsurvey manifests a fairly high level of religiosity. For in-\nstance, the modal response for religious belief salience was\n\"very important,\" and the modal response for frequency of\nservice attendance was \"once a week.\" Idler and Kasl's\na generally lower level of religious participation. Although\nwe tested for southern and rural residence in preliminary\nmodels, one wonders if differences in sampling may ac-\ncount for our inability to replicate their findings.\nNo significant differences by gender or race are found in\nthese models. These findings are unexpected in light of the\nempirically consistent health differences and religious ser-\nvice attendance norms. White adults and men are less likely\nto attend religious services or be privately religious (Levin,\nTaylor, & Chatters, 1994). Women are more likely to be\ndisabled than men. In addition, there is a consistent health\ndifferential between Whites and African Americans, includ-\ning physical function (Guralnik, Land, Blazer, Fillenbaum,\nservice attendance significantly predicted self-rated health\nfor all Whites, as well as Black and Latino women, but it\nwas not a significant predictor for Black and Latino men.\nThe author concluded that if the sample sizes for Black and\nLatino adults had been comparable to the White sample,\nsome of the relationships might have been significant. ACL\nhas an oversample of African Americans, providing the nec-\nessary statistical power for the analyses in this study. The\nlack of significant differences may indicate that the impact\nof functional limitations on religious service attendance is a\nuniversal experience of managing pain and physical limita-\ntions regardless of gender or race. Future studies should ex-\namine the barrier and benefit mechanisms with multidimen-\nsional measures of religiosity, especially public practice, to\ndetermine if the relationship holds.\nAlthough we find no support for the health benefit mech-\nanism, the physical barrier mechanism is consistently sig-\nnificant. The barrier mechanism is significant in both recur-\nsive and nonrecursive models of cross-sectional relations,\nbut there is no longitudinal barrier effect. In other words,\nmuch of the effect of functional limitations on religious ser-\nvice attendance is immediate, reflecting the temporal sa-\nlience of pain or incapacity on social engagement. This is\nconsistent with previous research on functional limitations,\nwhich has argued that social withdrawal happens almost si-\nmultaneously with the functional limitations experienced\nSeveral features of the measure of functional limitations\nconstructed from the ACL should be considered in inter-\npreting results supporting the barrier mechanism. First, the\nACL measures include both objective and subjective ele-\nments. Decisions about whether to attend religious services\nor engage in any social activity are based on the respon-\ndent's perceived level of ability rather than actual level. The\nmeasure of functional limitations used here combines the\nobjective and subjective responses to capture both func-\ntional ability and perceptions of function.\nSecond, the measure of functional limitations focuses on\nmobility or lower body function (whether the respondent is\nin a bed or chair all day, the level of difficulty walking\nblocks, and the level of difficulty climbing stairs). The expe-\nrience of physical limitations varies from person to person\non the basis of the type of health condition and how much\nhelp is needed to maneuver. In addition, persons with lower\nbody functional limitations tend to be much less mobile than\npersons with exclusively upper body limitations (Clark, Mun-\nmeasurement model developed from the ACL targets those\nwho have trouble walking, driving, or sitting for long periods\nof time--all of which are often needed for full participation\nin a religious group. This is a claim for data strength when\nsome may argue that it is a weakness. The negative relation-\nship between functional limitations and religious service at-\ntendance, at baseline and over time, demonstrates how those\nwith lower body limitations may be more likely to disengage\nfrom social activities because of pain, incapacity, or the awk-\nwardness associated with reduced mobility. At the same\ntime, it is possible that the measures available in ACL make\nit more difficult to uncover the benefit mechanism. Perhaps\nthe benefit effect found in other studies is a result of physical\nfunction measures that combine upper and lower body dis-\nability. Many researchers have used scales originally devel-\noped by Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jackson, and Jaffee (1963),\nsigned to encompass both upper and lower body mobility\n1997b). Unfortunately, ACL does not have measures of up-\nper body function. Future research should examine the rela-\ntionship between religious service attendance and domain-\nspecific functional limitations.\nAnother limitation of the present study is the limited reli-\ngion variables available in the ACL. The demonstration of a\nnegative relationship between functional limitations and at-\ntendance reflects the level of social engagement in the reli-\ngious group. This outcome is of primary interest because it\ncaptures the physical act of getting to the religious service.\nWe make no inferences about the private religious behav-\niors of persons who have functional limitations. Physical\nhealth problems may not necessarily act as a barrier to\nprayer or personal faith. Respondents were never asked\nabout their frequency of prayer and were only asked about\nconsuming religious media (watching/listening to religious\nprograms, reading religious materials) at W1. Religious ser-\nvice attendance was the only religious behavior measure\nasked about again at W2. Other religious practices could be\nsubstituted for declining attendance, but we cannot test\nthese effects with ACL.\nThe literature offering support for the benefit mechanism\nhas a preponderance of studies that rely on more subjective\nhealth measures such as self-rated health or well-being\naddition, there clearly are some studies that support the ben-\nefit thesis on other outcomes such as morbidity and mortal-\nthe benefit thesis may apply to certain types of functional\nlimitations, there is no evidence in the ACL survey that it\nexists once one considers both mechanisms simultaneously.\nWithout entertaining the possibility of a barrier process, it is\npossible that one may overestimate the benefit mechanism.\nPersons with disabilities may find it difficult to partici-\npate in social settings, including religious groups, that are\nnot conducive to their needs. Repeated standing and sitting,\nand sometimes kneeling, during a religious service can be\nmuch more difficult for those who have physical limita-\ntions. The findings from this research demonstrate that\nfunctional limitations are associated with lower levels of re-\nligious service attendance and offer no support for the hy-\npothesis that attendance reduces functional limitations. Re-\nligious service attendance may benefit various dimensions\nof health, but such benefits can only accrue if the person is\nfunctionally capable of attending. The present research\nshows the importance of the barrier mechanism and the util-\nity of simultaneously considering both the barrier and bene-\nfit mechanisms.\n"
