Based on\nthe event-time approach, the 3-year stock returns of the IPOs are investigated using cumulative abnormal return (CAR) and\nbuy-and-hold abnormal return (BHAR). As a robustness check, the calendar-time approach, related to the market model as\nwell as Fama-French and Carhart models, was applied for verifying long-run abnormal returns. We found evidence that the\nhealth care IPOs overperform in the long-run, irrespective of the alternative benchmarks and methods. In addition, when we\ndivide our sample into 5 groups by listing countries, our results show that the health care stock prices of the Singaporean\nfirms behaved differently from those of most of the other firms in ASEAN. The Singaporean IPOs are characterized by a\nworse post-offering performance, whereas the IPOs of Malaysian and Thai health care companies performed better in the\nlong-run.\n",

World\nHealth Organization (WHO) data estimate the average total\nhealth care spending per capita in Association of Southeast\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) to be US$544. Interestingly, not too\nmany investors realize that the ASEAN region (ie, Brunei,\nCambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) provides\ngood access to a wealth of innovation in the health care ser-\nvice sector; much of this innovation has been derived from\nother sectors. In addition, there is an increasing demand for\nhealth care services, spurred on by the growth in middle-\nclass households, better education, and greater health aware-\nness. Singapore and Brunei top the list with expenditure per\nism steadily contributes to the increasing number of foreign\npatients using some of ASEAN's world-class medical facili-\nties. Thailand's health tourism is now worth about US$2 bil-\nlion and receives 40% of the medical tourist arrivals in Asia.\nMalaysia's foreign patients, meanwhile, reached over\nASEAN is expected to boost health spending to provide bet-\nter health care services and catch up with the average spend-\ning rate in fully developed countries.\nRapidly aging populations, especially in Singapore and\nThailand; the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases; and\ngovernment initiatives improving access to health care ser-\nvices are the key significant factors for overall public health\ncare spending in the South East Asia region. Recently, the\nmedical tourism market in Malaysia, Singapore, andThailand\nfirms are eager for growth through developing and expand-\ning their products and services, with entry into the public\nmarket typically receiving funding from multiple sources.\n1Rangsit University, Pathum Thani, Thailand\n2RSU International Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand\n3The Stock Exchange of Thailand, Huai Khwang, Thailand\nCorresponding Author:\nKulabutr Komenkul, Department of Finance and Investment, Rangsit\nInternational College, Rangsit Business School, Rangsit University, Pathum\nEmail: kbkomenkul@gmail.com\nAnother well-known source of funding for several heath care\ncompanies is through the issue of their own initial public\nofferings (IPOs). An IPO is defined as the first offer of stock\nby a private company to the public. IPOs are generally issued\nby companies seeking or raising capital to create a public\nmarket in which founders and other shareholders can convert\nsome of their wealth into cash at a future date and the IPO\nissuers will obtain the assistance of underwriters or invest-\nment banks.1\nThere are several reasons for health care, biotechnology,\nand pharmaceutical firms seeking to sell their stocks to the\npublic; they are the internal growth of existing or potential\nproducts and product lines, diversification into related and\nunrelated areas, an exit mechanism for owners, and for sur-\nvival.2 However, IPO anomalies have been closely examined\nover the last few decades. A well-known study was of \"IPO\nunderperformance in the long-run.\"3 Most prior empirical\nstudies suggest that IPOs have negative abnormal returns\nover different holding periods after going public.4-6 Thus,\ninvestors could not gain any returns if they bought the IPOs\non the first trading day and held them for the long-horizon\nperiod. However, health care IPO performance has not been\nexamined by itself. To the best of our knowledge, the perfor-\nmance of health care IPOs has only received limited atten-\ntion in the literature. Existing studies focus only on the US\nmarket.7-9 Firms doing business related to a medical program\nor to pharmaceutical and biotechnology must deal with rev-\nenue flows that are not driven by market forces; the demand\nfor health care services is instead determined by government\npolicies. This may lead health care and biopharmaceutical\nIPOs to perform differently in the long-run when compared\nwith IPOs from other industries. In this article, we aimed to\nstudy the long-term performance of health care and biophar-\nmaceutical IPOs for companies listed on the Indonesian,\nMalaysian, Singaporean, and Thai stock markets and to\nexamine the robustness of existing empirical evidence, using\na variety of different methods to calculate abnormal returns\nby applying different market benchmarks and by using more\nrobust statistical tests.\nIn terms of the value of investigating the ASEAN case\nand the contribution of our study, the health care IPO stock\nmarket is particularly interesting to analyze for a number of\nreasons. First, compared with other countries that already\nhave established markets, such as the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom, the stock markets in the Southeast Asia\nregion are relatively new stock exchanges. As a result, there\nare not yet many public companies from the health care\nindustry listed on these stock exchanges. Such health care\nIPOs have consequently not been closely studied in the\nASEAN market in the same way as they have been in estab-\nlished markets. Second, the size of firms in Southeast Asia is\nmoderately small, and thus, the exchange requirements to list\nIPOs differ from those in developed countries. This may\ncause different patterns in ASEAN health care IPOs' pricing\nand thus lead to different price dynamics over time. This is\nalso of significant interest because the existence of any long-\nterm return patterns in the IPO market can affect investment\nstrategies. Third, the ASEAN exchange is a moderate trading\nmarket, but it is nevertheless well integrated into the global\nfinancial system. Hence, the results presented in our study\nmay have broader implications for many emerging markets\nthat are also trying to go global by implementing economic,\ntrade, and financial reforms. Our findings may therefore\nindeed be useful and provoke expressions of interest in health\ncare IPOs from investors in many other emerging markets.\nFinally, we also present more results for robustness purposes,\nusing a calendar-time approach based on the market model\nand on the Fama and French 3-factor and the Carhart 4-factor\nmodels. The calendar-time approach is applied in this study\nto address contemporaneous cross-correlation, which may be\na concern, given some financial turmoil (eg, the Asian\nFinancial Crisis in 1997, and also the Global Financial Crisis\nin 2007) affecting all IPO stocks in the market at certain\npoints in time during the sample period.\nOur findings suggest that health care and biopharmaceuti-\ncal IPOs in ASEAN outperform in the long-run, irrespective\nof the alternative benchmarks and methods used. Based on\nthe event-time and the calendar-time approaches, our find-\nings support the results of studies by Palkon10 and Williams\nand Young,9 which concluded that health care IPOs overper-\nform in the long-horizon. Interestingly, when we consider the\nlisted countries individually, the Malaysian and Thai IPOs\nperform better in the long-run than the Indonesian and\nSingaporean IPOs.\nRelated Literature\nThe behavior of IPO returns in the long-run has attracted\nconsiderable attention in the literature in recent years. Ritter3\nshowed evidence of substantial negative returns from IPOs\nin the long-horizon. He suggested that IPO firms intend to go\npublic when investors are overoptimistic about the firm's\nfuture growth potential. Thus, one reason for the long-term\nperformance of IPOs is a possible overvaluation in the early\naftermarket trading. Ritter11 attributed such long-term under-\nperformance to the fact that IPO investors are overoptimistic\nabout IPO valuations, whereas there is much uncertainty\nconcerning the value and growth of the IPO companies. In\nconsequence, investors overpay for IPOs in the initial period\nof listing. However, when more information becomes avail-\nable in the subsequent period, the difference in opinions\nbetween optimistic and pessimistic investors is reduced. As a\nresult, the IPO price declines after going public, or when the\ninvestors receive more information about the company.\nShiller12 introduces the \"fads hypothesis\" from an investor's\nviewpoint. This maintains that, contrary to the rational expecta-\ntion models, there are fads in the stock market, and the IPO\nmarket overpricing is due to the presence of such fads. For a\nsimilar hypothesis, Ritter3,11 proposes an \"impresario hypothe-\nsis\" to explain the phenomenon of IPO underperformance in\nKomenkul and Kiranand 3\nthe long-run. Investment bankers (the impresarios) underprice\nIPOs to stimulate an excess in IPO demand. Broadly speaking,\nthe impresario hypothesis or fads hypothesis demonstrates that\nthe market for IPOs is subject to fads and that IPOs are deliber-\nately underpriced by investment bankers to create the appear-\nance of excess demand, much in the same way as the promoter\nof a rock concert attempts to make it an event. These hypothe-\nses suggest that the lowest subsequent returns should follow\nthe initial returns.\nMost of the prior empirical studies have supported IPO\nfindings of Jelic et al,16 Ahmad-Zaluki et al,17 and Moshirian\net al18 have all demonstrated IPOs' long-run overperfor-\nmance using market index benchmarks in certain countries,\nsuch as Malaysia, China, and Korea. This somewhat mixed\npicture regarding IPOs' long-term performance may be\nrelated to the application of different methods and approaches\nto measure the abnormal returns. Companies doing business\nwithin the health care service must deal with revenue flows\nthat are not mainly driven by market forces. Therefore, the\ndemand for health care services is substantially determined\nby government policy, as opposed to consumers' prefer-\nences, as is the case for most other goods and services.8\nTherefore, some specific features of health care and biophar-\nmaceutical shares should be taken into account. The value of\nhealth care and biopharmaceutical IPOs may be adversely\naffected if financial markets react to the presence of nonmar-\nket revenue flows. As a result, investors may believe that\nfirms in the health care sector are less able to enhance reve-\nnues through traditional marketing and promotion tech-\nniques, compared with their counterparts in other industries.\nWe would therefore expect IPO underperformance in the\nlong-run to be as documented by several IPO studies, if the\nmarket treated health care IPOs similarly.\nIn the health care and biopharmaceutical context, Guirguis\net al8 specifically investigated the postoffering performance\nindustry. Their results showed that the IPOs'3-year buy-and-\nhold abnormal return (BHAR) underperformed the returns of\nthe market index by 15% and the matching health care index\nby 85%. Similarly, Brau and Holloway7 examined the after-\nmarket performance of 345 US health care IPOs going public\nlisting. They reported that the IPOs underperformed the\nbenchmark in the long-run by an average of \u00ad0.22%,\nrespectively. In contrast to recent studies, William and\nYoung9 used 133 biopharmaceutical IPOs listed in the US\naftermarket return of 14.1%. However, they calculated the\nlong-run return of IPOs by using the offer price. This may\nhave produced such a biased result because they considered\nthe initial return (or IPO underpricing) to calculate the long-\nrun abnormal return. This was similar to the study by Palkon10\nof 81 health care IPOs going public in 1997. He also used the\noffer price to calculate aftermarket return and thus found\n65.4% of the IPOs had a positive return. There are a few\nimportant similarities between the previous event studies of\nthe long-term performance of health care and biopharmaceu-\ntical IPOs.7,8,10 First, they used only BHAR when measuring\nthe long-run IPO performance and, furthermore, they consid-\nered an equally weighted (EW) portfolio of IPOs.\nHowever, Fama19 suggested that BHAR has more statisti-\ncal problems than cumulative abnormal return (CAR) due to\na positive skewness bias. This leads to the negative bias of\nthe standard t statistics. To address this inference problem,\nLyon et al20 developed new techniques, such as a skewness-\nadjusted t test. Unfortunately, previous studies of the health\ncare performance of IPOs were unaware of the skewness bias\nissue. This article addresses these issues in the research anal-\nysis, and in contrast to existing previous studies, the health\ncare IPO performance in ASEAN countries in the long-run\nwas examined, using a wide range of alternative benchmarks\nand models that had been designed to adjust for size effects.\nIn addition to this, as a further robustness check, we exam-\nined the cross-section average of the calendar regression\nresults of the long-run returns.\nResearch Methodology\nPrevious studies used several different methods to investi-\ngate the long-term performance of IPOs. In general, either\nraw returns or abnormal returns (measuring price dynamics\nrelative to some benchmark) are used to assess the long-run\nperformance. The studies of Ritter,3 Carter et al,21 Jelic\n\u00c1lvarez and Gonz\u00e1lez,24 and Su and Bangassa15 employed\ncumulative average returns (CAR) and buy-and-hold returns\n(BHAR). In our article, we follow this event-time approach\nby exploiting abnormal return measures, CAR and BHAR, to\ninvestigate the performance of health care IPOs in the long-\nrun. We also selected the appropriate market indices as\nbenchmarks for each IPO firm depending on their stock\nexchange listing and the size of the IPO firms. The abnormal\nreturns of the IPOs were considered in horizons of up to 36\nmonths after the first day of trading. This was done to be able\nto make comparisons with the findings presented in previous\nIPO studies, which typically followed Ritter3 and other\npapers that had adopted similar methodology.\nCumulative Abnormal Return\nThe market-adjusted abnormal returns of company i in event\nmonth t (ARi,t\n) were calculated for each event month t as\nfollows:\ni t i t m t\n, , , ,\n= -\nwhere Ri,t\nis the monthly raw return of the company i in event\nmonth t excluding the initial return. This article excludes IPO\nunderpricing because of the effect that stabilizing activities\nby underwriters may exert on stock prices.\ni t i t i t i t\n, , , ,\n( ) / ,\n= - - -\n, is the last traded price\nof the company in event month t and Pi t\n, -1 is the last traded\nprice of the company in the event month t \u00ad 1.

Rm t\n, is calcu-\nlated as R P P P\nm t m t m t m t\n, , , ,\n( ) / ,\n= - - -\n, is the last\nclosing value of the stock market index in event month t and\nPm t\n, -1 is the last closing value of the market index in event\nmonth t \u00ad 1. We use the adjusted closing stock price and mar-\nket index from Thomson Reuters Datastream. Also, it\naccounts for all corporate actions such as stock splits, stock\nrepurchased, and dividends.\nThe average market-adjusted return for a sample of n\ncompanies in event month t is then defined as follows:\nAR\nn\nAR\ni t i t\ni\nn\n, , .\n=\n=\n\nIn the case of the value-weighted (VW) arithmetic mean\nof the market-adjusted returns, the abnormal return was com-\nputed as follows:\ni t i i t\ni\nn\n, , ,\n=\n=\n\nwhere i\nis the weight of market value calculated as MVi\n/\ni\n(and MVi\nis the market value of the IPO firms on the\nfirst day of trading) and ARi,t\nis the market-adjusted return.\nThe cumulative average abnormal return (CARi,t\n) of com-\npany i from event month 1 to event month t was defined as\nfollows:\ni t i t\ni\nT\n, , .\n=\n=\n\nBuy-and-Hold Abnormal Return\nThe abnormal return of company i in event month t defined\nas buy-and-hold abnormal return (BHARi,t\n) was calculated as\nfollows:\ni t i t\nt\nT\nt\nt\nT\n, , , ,\n= +\n( )-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- +\n( )-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= =\n \nm\nwhere Ri,t\nand Rm,t\nare the monthly returns on the stock i and\nthe market index in event month t, respectively. The mean\nbuy-and-hold returns were calculated as follows:\ni t i i t\ni\nn\n, , .\n=\n=\n\nFor the EW variant: i\n= 1 / n, and for the VW variant:\ni\n= MVi\n/ \ni\nis the IPO firm's stock market value on\nthe first trading day. Previous empirical studies have\ndocumented that long-run abnormal returns are positively\nnegatively biased. To eliminate the skewness bias and to be\nable to perform tests that the CARs and BHARs are signifi-\ncantly different from 0, the skewness-adjusted t statistic\nneeds to be applied:\nt n s s\nn\nsa = + +\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n ,\nwhere\nS\nBHAR\n=\n( )\n\n,\nand\n\n\n =\n-\n( )\n( )\n=\n\ni\nn\ni t t\nt\n,\n.\nData and Sample\nThe sample adopted in this study includes all 76 health\ncare and biopharmaceutical IPO stocks in the ASEAN\nregion, listed on the Indonesian, Malaysian, Singaporean,\nThai, Philippines, Vietnamese, Myanmar, and Lao stock\nthere is no Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code\nsystem in ASEAN countries. However, they do have their\nown particular industry classification, which differs from\nexchange to exchange. In our sample, health care services,\nhospitals, and pharmaceutical and biotechnological com-\npanies are therefore grouped into a single industry, namely,\nthe health care and biopharmaceutical sector. The stock\nprice data for individual IPO companies were collected\nfrom the Thomson Reuters DataStream. In particular, the\ndata comprised each IPO's closing price on the first day of\ntrading and the 36 monthly stock returns following going\npublic. The monthly stock returns for each IPO were com-\npared with monthly returns of stock market indices such as\nthe Jakarta Composite Index (JSX), the FTSE Straits Times\nIndex (STI), the FTSE Bursa Malaysia, the Stock Exchange\nof Thailand (SET), the Philippines Stock Exchange (PSE),\nthe Hanoi Stock Exchange (HSE), the Yangon Stock\nExchange (YSE), and the Lao Securities Exchange (LSX)\nindices.\nTable 1 reports the main characteristics of the data divided\naccording to IPO year across the entire sample and split by\nlisted country samples. However, for the Philippines,\nVietnam, Myanmar and Laos, the number of health care\nIPOs was not large enough for meaningful statistical analy-\nsis. We therefore grouped them under one heading, namely,\n\"Other.\" Approximately 66% of health care IPOs went pub-\nlic after the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 and the Internet\nBubble period. Most of the IPOs in our sample are from the\nsample belong to the Thai and Singaporean stock markets,\nrespectively.\nKomenkul and Kiranand 5\nEmpirical Findings\nIn this section, the main results, including a robustness analysis,\nare presented and an extensive discussion of our findings is pro-\nvided. Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for the excess\nreturns of Thai IPOs over the 36-month period after going pub-\nlic. In relatively finite samples, the abnormal return may suffer\nfrom the problem that the excess returns are not normally dis-\ntributed. Therefore, the Jarque-Bera test was used to verify the\nnull hypothesis about normal distribution. We rejected the null\nhypothesis. This indicates that the average market-adjusted\nreturns between months 1 and 36 are not normally distributed,\nwhich may cause statistical inference problems. To check for a\npossible bias in the calculation of long-run abnormal returns, we\napplied a bootstrapped skewness-adjusted t statistic and the\nnonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test.\nLong-Run Performance Results in the Portfolios of\nHealth Care and Biopharmaceutical IPOs\nTables 3 and 4 present the EW and VW abnormal returns of\nhealth care IPO firms for up to 3 years after listing. These are\ncalculated using CAR and BHAR measures. The EW and\nVW abnormal returns for the first month are 5.67% and\nThis implies that the initial return continues to the early\naftermarket trading. For the ASEAN market (entire sample),\nthe results indicate that health care IPOs are overperforming\nCARs and BHARs at the end of year 3. This finding of an\nunderperformance is in contrast with Guirguis et al8 and\nBrau and Holloway,7 who showed that the US health care\nIPOs underperform relative to the benchmarks in the long-\nrun. Notably, the aftermarket returns of the ASEAN health\ncare and biopharmaceutical IPOs, measured by BHAR, dis-\nplay a much greater overperformance than those using CAR.\nHowever, when we divided the entire sample into 5 subsam-\nples according to listing exchange, we found a wide variation\nin the health care IPOs' performance in the long-horizon\nacross countries. For Malaysian and Thai stock markets, the\nresults indicate that the health care and biopharmaceutical\nTable 1.

In contrast, for the Singaporean health care\nIPOs, it was found that there were negative returns and that\nthey were statistically significant at the end of year 3 using\nabnormal returns at year 3 were also obtained using the non-\nparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. This finding of under-\nperformance in the Singapore market is consistent with the\nresults of existing studies in the US health care market.7,8\nSeveral possible reasons which could explain the underper-\nformance of the Singaporean health care IPOs and support\nthe findings of the US market are that the economic growth\nand system differ from those in ASEAN countries and the\nsize of the capital market is considerably larger than the oth-\ners. Furthermore, Singapore is only one developing country\nin the same region.\nIn attempts to measure the performance of IPOs in the\nlong-run, one can apply either an EW portfolio of IPOs or a\nVW market portfolio to calculate CAR and BHAR. Fama19\nsuggested that EW returns may produce different inferences\nfrom those derived from VW returns. We therefore consid-\nered both EW and VW portfolios, which provided an impor-\ntant robustness check for the findings. The results of a\ncross-sectional analysis and a country-specific value-\nweighted cumulative abnormal return (VWCAR) and value-\nweighted buy-and-hold abnormal return (VWBHAR) over a\n36-month horizon are presented in Tables 3 and 4, Panel B.\nUsing the market VW portfolio of IPOs, the findings show a\nsimilar pattern of results, where the health care and\nbiopharmaceutical IPOs for the entire Malaysian and Thai\nsamples have positive abnormal returns after going public\nand show poor performance for the Singaporean health care\nThe CAR and BHAR figures for the health care IPO sam-\nples in Tables 3 and 4 are plotted in Figures 1 to 4. The CAR\nand BHAR show an outperformance throughout the whole\nlong-horizon period for all the Malaysian and Thai IPOs,\nwhereas the aftermarket returns of the Indonesian health care\nIPOs display similar patterns between the event months 1 and\n22, after which period the CAR and BHAR drop instanta-\nneously. However, the CAR and BHAR, as EW and VW mea-\nsures,fortheSingaporeanIPOsmovejustunderthezero-return\nline (exhibiting underperformance) until the end of year 3.\nCalendar-Time Abnormal Return Regression\nResults\nFama19 also suggested that the event-time approach over-\nstates the statistical inferences, once it no longer controls for\ncorrelation among individual firms. Therefore, as a final\nrobustness check of the results, the calendar-time portfolio\napproach using Fama and French's26 3-factor and Carhart's27\n4-factor models was used to eliminate the potential problems\nof cross-sectional correlations among ASEAN health care\nstocks in the event-time approach and also to obtain more\nrobust t statistics. First, the average monthly abnormal\nreturns on a diversified portfolio, composed of firms going\npublic within the last 36 months in each calendar month\nFigure 1. Long-run performance of heath care IPOs in ASEAN countries using EWCAR.\nNote. IPO = initial public offering; ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations; EWCAR = equally weighted cumulative abnormal return.\nFigure 2. Long-run performance of heath care IPOs in ASEAN countries using VWCAR.\nNote. IPO = initial public offering; ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations; VWCAR = value-weighted cumulative abnormal return.\nKomenkul and Kiranand 9\nSecond, Fama and French's26 and Carhart's27 models were\nestimated to test the significance in the pattern of long-term\nreturns. If IPOs overperform on a risk-adjusted basis, a port-\nfolio of IPOs should consistently overperform relative to the\nFama-French and the Carhart models. The monthly excess\nreturns on EW and VW portfolios of IPOs were regressed on\nthe market premium, the size premium, and the value pre-\nmium, using the following model:\npt ft mt ft t t t\n- = + - + + +\n( )\n    \nand\npt ft mt ft t\nt t t\n- = + - +\n+ + +\n( )\n  \n  \nwhere Rpt\nis the return of the IPO portfolio in month t, Rft\nis\n1-month T-bill rate, observed at the beginning of month t, Rmt\nis the VW return on the market index in month t, SMBt\n(small\nminus big) is the monthly return on the zero-investment port-\nfolio for the size factor in the stock returns or the difference\nbetween the EW average of the returns on a portfolio of\nsmall stocks and a portfolio of big stocks, and HMLt\n(high\nminus low) is the monthly return on the zero-investment\nportfolio for the book-to-market equity factor in stock\nreturns, or the difference between the return on a portfolio of\nhigh book-to-market ratio stocks and a portfolio of low book-\nto-market ratio stocks, constructed independently from the\nsize portfolio. The MOMt\nvariable is therefore defined as:\nMOM = 1/2 (Small High + Big High) \u00ad 1/2 (Small Low +\nBig Low). It is the monthly return on a zero-investment port-\nfolio for a momentum factor constructed as the difference in\nreturns between a portfolio of past winner stocks and a port-\nfolio of loser stocks, defined as described above.\nThe calendar-time approach method weights each month\nequally. This leads to a reduction of any underperformance\nwhen it is correlated with the number of IPOs in the portfo-\nlios.28 As a result, the intercepts, the estimates of which are\nbased on the weighted least squares (WLS) method, weighted\nby the square root of the number of IPOs in the IPO portfo-\nlios in each calendar month, provide a test of the null hypoth-\nesis that the mean monthly abnormal return on the\ncalendar-time portfolio is zero.\nTable 5 presents the estimated intercepts from the regres-\nsions as indicators of the risk-adjusted performance of the\nASEAN health care IPOs. Considering first the long-run per-\nformance of the EW portfolio, the mean intercept for the\nFama-French 3-factor model is 0.48% per month (see Table\n5, Panel A). This value implies a 3-year abnormal return of\nof 3.01 indicates that the average monthly return is statisti-\ncally significant at a 1% level. The same table in Panel B\npresents the results when the health care IPO portfolios were\nFigure 3. Long-run performance of heath care IPOs in ASEAN countries using EWBHAR.\nNote.

In this case, they still overperformed by\nexcess return of 22.27%. The results of similar regressions\nfor the CAPM and Carhart's model are also reported in the\nsame table. Notably, the t statistics indicate that the intercept\nis positively and strongly significant for the Fama-French\nand Carhart's regression models. This article can therefore\nconclude that, based on the calendar-time approach, the\nASEAN health care and biopharmaceutical IPO companies\nduring the 3-year period after going public underperformed\ntheir benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis using either EW or\nVW portfolios. These findings are thus consistent with the\nlong-run health Care and biopharmaceutical IPOs' perfor-\nmance using the event-time approach.\nConclusions\nOverall, this article shows that health care and biopharma-\nceutical IPOs in ASEAN overperformed in the long-run after\ngoing public. We find a different long-term health care IPO\nprice pattern in the ASEAN market data when compared\nwith the long-term IPO underperformance in other indus-\ntries. Moreover, our findings mostly contrast with the exist-\ning US heath care studies. The results show that the fads\nhypothesis partially explains the underperformance of\nASEAN health care IPOs in the long-run. For Singaporean\nIPOs, the result is similar to the US IPOs in terms of a nega-\ntive relation between initial returns and 3-year aftermarket\nabnormal returns. However, when the entire sample was seg-\nmented into 5 subgroups, we posit that investors who buy\nand hold Malaysian and Thai IPOs in the health care and\nbiopharmaceutical sector can gain positive returns in the\nlong-run. It can be seen that this study does not support the\nimpresario hypothesis, if we consider the health care IPOs'\nlisting in the Thai and Malaysian stock markets. Therefore,\nour findings concerning the performance of health care IPOs\nover a long-horizon period may depend on the listed country.\nFor instance, the results from the Singaporean stock market\nsuggest that investors cannot earn any abnormal returns, irre-\nspective of the alternative benchmarks and weighting meth-\nods used. In addition, a possible reason for the Thai and\nMalaysian health care IPOs performing better in the long-run\nis the longer lock-up (silent) period. The average silent\nperiod for strategic shareholders in Thailand and Malaysia is\nabout 1 to 1.5 years, whereas it is 3 to 6 months in the United\nStates and Singapore. The authors expect that investors will\nsell their IPOs or reduce their share proportion immediately\nafter the lock-up period. Interestingly, once we consider EW\nand VW returns of health care IPOs separately, we find that\nsmall- and medium-sized firms perform better than big-sized\nfirms in the long-run.\nThe findings from this article may also assist investors in\ndevising active trading strategies, aiming to generate supe-\nrior returns by investing in new health care IPOs in ASEAN\n(eg, by buying Malaysian and Thai health care IPOs in the\ninitial aftermarket period and holding them for a long-term\nperiod, instead of short-selling Singaporean health care IPOs\nwhen they are already listed on the market). In addition, the\nfindings imply that any new issuers may benefit from our\nfindings about IPO underperformance being due to the lower\nTable 5.
