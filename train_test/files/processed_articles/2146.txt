The objective of this analysis was to estimate the prevalence of comorbidity in\nCOPD using nationally-representative data.\nMethods: This study draws from a multi-year analytic sample of 14,828 subjects aged 45+, including 995 with\nCOPD, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999\u00ad2008. COPD was defined by\nself-reported physician diagnosis of chronic bronchitis or emphysema; patients who reported a diagnosis of asthma\nwere excluded. Using population weights, we estimated the age-and-gender-stratified prevalence of 22 comorbid\nconditions that may influence COPD and its treatment.\nResults: Subjects 45+ with physician-diagnosed COPD were more likely than subjects without physician-diagnosed\n(8.9% vs. 4.6%). Subjects with COPD were also more likely to report mobility difficulty (55.6% vs. 32.5%), use of >4\nConclusions: Our study indicates that COPD management may need to take into account a complex spectrum of\ncomorbidities. This work identifies which conditions are most common in a nationally-representative set of COPD\npatients (physician-diagnosed), a necessary step for setting research priorities and developing clinical practice\nguidelines that address COPD within the context of comorbidity.\nBackground\nChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the\n4th most common cause of death in the United States,\nwith projections that it will move into 3rd place by 2020.\nCurrently, COPD is the attributable cause of death for\nstroke and heart disease decreased between 1970 and\n2002, death rates for COPD nearly doubled [1]. COPD is\nalso a leading cause of hospitalizations in older adults\n[2], as well as of other morbidity.\nCOPD does not simply contribute to mortality. It may\ncontribute substantially to difficulties with activities of\ndaily living and disrupt social functioning [3]. A study in\n2003, for example, found the presence of either moder-\nate or severe COPD to be associated with a higher odds\nratio of functional limitations [4].\nThe majority of patients with COPD have more than\njust COPD - comorbidities in COPD are the rule, ra-\nther than the exception. A study of 200 COPD patients\nfrom a managed care organization, for example, found\nthat 94% of patients had at least one other chronic\n* Correspondence: kschnel1@jhmi.edu\nUSA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2012 Schnell et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

This is significant because\ncomorbidities in COPD are associated with poorer out-\ncomes, both for COPD and the other conditions [6,7].\nPrevious studies have shown an association between a\nvariety of chronic conditions and COPD, including\nhypertension, diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery\ndisease, and malignancy [6-9].\nPrevious studies on comorbidities in COPD have typ-\nically focused on selected chronic medical conditions,\nsuch as heart failure and diabetes. These studies have\nlargely failed to look comprehensively at many other\nhigh-priority conditions, such as arthritis and obesity,\nand important functional limitations, like cognitive im-\npairment and limited mobility. Functional limitations\ncan have a significant impact on the treatment of\nchronic conditions, as patients may have difficulty ad-\nhering to treatment regimens [10]. These conditions\nmay also modify the effectiveness of COPD therapy,\ncause potentially dangerous therapeutic interactions, and\nmake COPD therapies less feasible.\nDespite these potential interactions and the complex-\nities of clinical decision-making for people with COPD,\nlittle population\u00adbased data on the prevalence of comor-\nbidities in COPD is available. To date, there have been\nno nationally-representative studies of the prevalence of\ncomorbidities in COPD. Moreover, COPD clinical prac-\ntice guidelines do not provide specific recommendations\nfor older patients with multiple comorbid diseases [11].\nThus, in this study, we aim to describe the prevalence of\nclinically-relevant comorbid conditions that add to the\ncomplexity of clinical decision-making or self-\nmanagement of COPD in a nationally-representative\npopulation of people with physician-diagnosed COPD.\nWe also compare these prevalence estimates to those\nseen in subjects without COPD, to gain a better under-\nstanding of which conditions in particular are more\ncommon in people with COPD.\nMethods\nStudy population\nNHANES is a nationally-representative study designed\nto assess the health and nutritional status of non-\ninstitutionalized civilians in the US. Collection of infor-\nmation occurs through home interviews and exams in\nmobile centers. Study details, including operations man-\nuals, are publicly available [12]. To ensure adequate\nsample size in age and gender strata, we joined five sur-\nCOPD. Using the sampling weights described below,\nthis sample represents around 100 million people, 10\nNHANES interview response rates ranged from 78% to\nphysical exam.\nDefinition of conditions\nCOPD and comorbid disease status were ascertained\nlargely through NHANES questions asking \"has a doctor\nor other health professional ever told you that you have\n[disease]?\" Physician-diagnosed COPD was defined as a\npositive response to either chronic bronchitis or emphy-\nsema with a negative response to current asthma. Sub-\njects were defined as having a history of smoking if they\nreported having smoked >100 cigarettes total in their\nlife.\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) was defined by an af-\nfirmative response to at least one of CHD, angina, or\nheart attack. For diabetes (DM), subjects were able to re-\nor borderline diabetes, individuals were counted as hav-\ning DM if they took insulin or a pill for diabetes, suf-\nlower extremity ulcer that took more than 4 weeks to\nheal, or had numbness or tingling in their hands or feet\ndue to diabetes.\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using\nthe Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equa-\ntion based on serum creatinine, age, race, and gender.\nLow GFR was defined as an estimated GFR < 60 mm/L\n[13]. Low hemoglobin was defined as <12 g/dL in\nwomen and < 13 g/dL in men [13]. Urinary incontinence\nwas ascertained by self-report of leaking urine at least a\nfew times a month. Polypharmacy was defined as self-\nreported regular use of >4 prescription medications, fol-\nlowing a previously established cut point [13]. Prescrip-\ntion dietary supplements were not counted as\nused on a chronic basis were not included in the count.\nPrescription analgesics were included in the drug count\nHypertension (HTN) was defined as mean systolic\nblood pressure 140 mmHg on exam, mean diastolic\nblood pressure  90 mmHg, and/or current use of an\nantihypertensive [9,14]. The mean blood pressures were\ncalculated following NHANES protocol [12]. If there\nwas more than one reading, the first reading was\nexcluded from the mean; otherwise, the sole reading was\nconsidered the \"mean.\" Hypercholesterolemia was simi-\nlarly defined by a total serum cholesterol >6.21 mmol/L\nor current use of a hyperlipidemia drug. Depression and\nanxiety were defined as self-reported current use of an\nantidepressant or anxiolytic, respectively.\nMemory problems were defined as an affirmative re-\nsponse or \"don't know\" to the question \"are you limited\nin any way because of difficulty remembering or because\nyou experience periods of confusion?\" Mobility difficulty\nwas considered present if the individual reported diffi-\nculty walking 0.25 miles or up to 10 steps without equip-\nment. Visual impairment was ascertained through self-\nreported extreme difficulty reading newsprint or seeing\nup close, or, an examined visual acuity score of <20/50\nin the better eye. Hearing impairment was defined\naccording to self-report of \"a lot\" of trouble hearing or\nuse of a hearing aid.\nIndividuals who reported dizziness or imbalance last-\ning at least 2 weeks or for an unknown duration, or, dif-\nficulty with balance in the last year, were counted as\nhaving problems with dizziness or balance. This variable\nhistory of cancer was defined by self-report of having\nbeen diagnosed with cancer, excluding non-melanoma\nand unknown skin cancers. Subjects were considered\nobese if their body mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/m2.\nFrailty was defined according to four of the five cri-\nteria developed in the Cardiovascular Health Study [15]\nand Women's Health and Aging Studies [16], modified\n2006 were defined as \"frail\" if they had 3 of the four\nfollowing characteristics: low BMI, weakness, exhaus-\ntion, and low physical activity. Low BMI was defined as\na BMI  18.5 kg/m2. Weakness was defined as a re-\nsponse of \"some difficulty,\" \"much difficulty,\" or \"unable\nto do\" when asked how difficult they find it to lift 10\npounds. Exhaustion was defined using these same\nresponses when asked how difficult they find it to walk\nfrom one room to another on the same level. Low phys-\nical activity was defined as reporting less activity than\nother people of the same age. Physical activity relative to\nfrail if they had a low BMI and reported both weakness\nand exhaustion.\nCondition groupings\nWe grouped the conditions into three domains \u00ad dis-\neases, clinical factors, and health status factors. As out-\nlined in Boyd et al., the disease domain encompasses\ntraditional chronic diseases that are considered of major\nimportance because they are established as leading\ncauses of death or morbidity [13]. The clinical domain\nconsists of physiological conditions and factors that\nshould be weighed when prescribing therapies (e.g.,\npolypharmacy). The health status domain was reserved\nfor conditions that affect function and quality of life,\nare likely to affect a person's ability to adhere to ther-\napy, and are often caused by several processes in older\nAnalytic plan\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) pro-\nvides sampling weights that account for sampling strat-\negy and survey non-response. Using methods provided\nby NCHS, we modified the original weights in our com-\nbined sample to maintain national representation [18].\nWe performed analyses with statistical software designed\nto conduct subpopulation analyses using masked vari-\nance units to estimate appropriate standard errors. We\nsummarize baseline characteristics using means and 95%\nconfidence intervals. Differences in these variables be-\ntween subjects with and without COPD were compared\nusing a 2 test.\nWe ran the analysis stratified by age group. The ana-\nlyses were rerun in the subset of COPD subjects with a\nhistory of smoking to test the sensitivity of the COPD\ndefinition. To address multiple testing, we reported both\nthe STATA-generated p-value and a Bonferroni-\ncorrected significance level () [19].\nAll analyses were carried out in STATA version 11.1.\nThe study protocol was approved by the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity School of Medicine Institutional Review\nBoard.\nResults\nThe prevalence of comorbid chronic disease among sub-\njects with physician-diagnosed COPD was: congestive heart\nfailure (12.1%), coronary heart disease (12.7%),hypertension\nClinical factors potentially complicating the treatment\nof COPD were: dizziness or balance problems (41.1%),\ntions (51.8%), and frailty (9.5%). Subjects with COPD\nwere also found to have the following \"health status\"\nfactors: memory problems (18.5%), mobility difficulty\nleastone comorbidity.\nTable 1 describes the basic demographic features of\nthose with and without COPD. Those with COPD\ntended to be older and female.\nFigures 1, 2 and 3 depict the prevalence rates of condi-\ntions in the three domains (diseases, clinical factors, and\nhealth status factors) in subjects with COPD. These fig-\nures provide a visual illustration of the high prevalence of\ncomorbidities in patients with physician-diagnosed\nCOPD; they do not statistically compare groups. The ma-\njority of the conditions are markedly more common in\nthe 65 age group than in the younger age groups. While\nsome conditions are more common in one gender than\nthe other (depression, CHD, osteoporosis, and hearing\nimpairment), others, such as polypharmacy, obesity, diz-\nziness or balance problems, and memory problems are\nequally common among the two genders. Missing bars\non the graph represent conditions for which the sample\nsize was small in a given gender and age group.\nTable 2 compares the prevalence rates of the condi-\ntions in subjects with COPD to those without COPD.\nMost of the conditions are significantly more prevalent\nin the subjects with COPD than in the subjects without\nCOPD. While not shown in the table, some portion of\nthese differences can be accounted for by differences in\nage and gender distribution in the COPD and non-\nCOPD groups. While not shown here, we found little dif-\nference in the prevalence of comorbid conditions\nbetween COPD subjects with and without a history of\nsmoking,\nTable 3 compares the prevalence of conditions in sub-\njects with COPD to those prevalence values found in pre-\nvious publications. The table also notes the country of\nstudy, the sample size, and the sampling method. We\nfound that, in most cases, the population-based preva-\nlence of comorbid conditions is at least as high, if not\nhigher, as the prevalence found in these less-generalizable\nCOPD populations.\nDiscussion\nIn this paper, we describe the prevalence of clinically-\nrelevantcomorbidconditionsinanationally-representative\nsample of people with physician-diagnosed COPD. We\nfound that 96.4% of adults with physician-diagnosed\nCOPD have at least one condition that may complicate\nthe treatment of COPD. Most notably, 51.8% of people\nwith COPD 45 and older are taking more than 4 medi-\ncations (polypharmacy), 55.6% report mobility difficulty,\nThese prevalence values are relatively consistent with\nthose found in previous studies of comorbidities in COPD.\nHowever, there is a large range of previously reported\nprevalence values. For example, estimates of arthritis in\nstudies, nor any other recent studies investigating comor-\nbidity in COPD, have examined nationally-representative\ndata. This both limits the applicability of these prevalence\nestimates and helps account for the large ranges in\nthese estimates. In fact, several papers have cited lack\nof national representation or specific population bias as\na weakness [5,8,24]. As such, our study both confirms\nthe high prevalence of comorbidities in patients with\nTable 1 Demographics and smoking history: adults 45\nyears, with and without physician-diagnosed COPD:\nDemographic Variables Without COPD With COPD\nGender\nRace\nSmoking History\na Represents ~100 million noninstitutionalized US civilians.\nb Represents ~10 million noninstitutionalized US civilians.\nFigure 1 Prevalence of comorbidities stratified by age and gender among subjects with physician-diagnosed COPD: Disease Domain.\nCOPD and provides specific prevalence values that are\nrelevant on a national scale.\nAnother strength of our study is the range of\nclinically-relevant conditions assessed. While there is a\nlot of data on, for example, cardiovascular disease in\nCOPD [8], there are few studies that look at the wide\nvariety of medical conditions and functional limitations\nwe have assessed. This is important partially because\ncomorbidity has been found to be an important aspect\nof quality of life in COPD [25-27], as well as an inde-\npendent risk factor for hospitalization [28]. In addition,\ncomorbidities increase the risk of hospitalization and\nmortality in patients with COPD [8], and significantly in-\ncrease the costs of treating COPD [29]. These conditions\nare also highly relevant for clinical decision-making and\nself-management.\nThe classification of the conditions into disease, clin-\nical factor, and health status factor domains highlights\nthat a wide range of conditions relevant to the clinical\nmanagement of people with COPD are quite prevalent,\nand that these relevant conditions extend beyond\ntraditionally-defined diseases.\nPhysicians must be judicious when caring for patients\nwith COPD. The high prevalence of comorbidity and\npolypharmacy means physicians must be cognizant of\npotential adverse drug events and nonadherence. People\nwith COPD are often complex, and, thus, we will need\nto improve our ability to prioritize treatment recommen-\ndations based on relative benefits and harms and patient\npreferences. Current guidelines, and our evidence base,\ndo not yet adequately inform this critical clinical\ndecision-making [13].\nFigure 2 Prevalence of comorbidities stratified by age and gender among subjects with physician-diagnosed COPD: Clinical Factors.\nFigure 3 Prevalence of comorbidities stratified by age and gender among subjects with physician-diagnosed COPD: Health Status\nFactors.\nClinical practice guidelines generally do not address\nhow to treat COPD in the context of comorbid condi-\ntions [11]. As such, these guidelines may be of little help\nwhen dealing with the majority of COPD patients\n[30,31]. For example, -blockers, which are indicated for\ncardiovascular disease, may worsen lung function in\nsome patients with COPD; some studies, however, have\nshown that this is not a contraindication to the initiation\nof -blockers [32]. Conversely, bronchodilators, which\nare believed to be beneficial for pulmonary function, may\nworsen tachyarrhythmias [9]. Guidance about these po-\ntential interactions, and the quality of evidence support-\ning any recommendations about them, would be very\nuseful to clinicians. Our results can inform clinical prac-\ntice guideline priority-setting processes to determine\nwhich comorbidities should be addressed in future\nCOPD guidelines.\nIt is imperative that therapeutic trials be designed to\nreflect the true population of people with COPD. Many\nstudies exclude patients with significant comorbid condi-\ntions [33]. Herland et al. found that only 17% of a group\nof COPD patients would be eligible for a \"typical\" clinical\ntrial. 65.9% of COPD patients in this study were\n\"excluded\" due to significant comorbidities, including\ndiabetes, depression, and ischemic heart disease [34].\nThese exclusions may be troublesome given the high\nprevalence of these diseases in people with COPD, and\nthe potential for interactions between the diseases and\ntheir treatments. Our study highlights the need for future\nclinical trials to evaluate safety and effectiveness in\nCOPD patients with multiple comorbidities.\nThere is evidence that treating COPD may benefit the\ncourse of comorbid conditions, and, visa-versa [35]. For\nexample, several observational studies have shown\nConditions Without COPD With COPD P-\nvaluec\nDiseases\nClinical Factors\nHealth Status Factors\nAll Conditions\na Represents ~100 million noninstitutionalized US civilians.\nb Represents ~10 million noninstitutionalized US civilians.\nc The Bonferroni-corrected significance level, , is 0.0011.\nimproved outcomes in COPD patients treated with sta-\ntins [36,37], independent of whether patients have a\ncomorbid diagnosis of ischemic heart disease [38]. While\na randomized controlled trial has shown an improve-\nment in exercise tolerance in COPD patients treated\nwith statins [39], more prospective intervention trials are\nneeded to look at the use of statins in COPD [40].\nGiven these potential complications of treatment and\nthe interactions between comorbid conditions and\nCOPD, some researchers have started to advocate for an\nintegrated-care approach to the management of patients\nwith COPD. Sonetti et al. in a recent review advocate for\na chronic care model approach to COPD management,\nwith an approach that includes automatic screening for\ncommon comorbidities [41,42]. In order to truly move\nto such a system, however, it is necessary to have a good\nunderstanding of how best to treat COPD in the context\nof comorbid conditions. First steps to accomplishing this\nare (a) determining common \"patterns\" of co-existing\nconditions (b) including patients with comorbid condi-\ntions in clinical trials with appropriate analytic strategies\nto understand heterogeneity of treatment effect [43] (c)\nevaluating current treatment regimens in patients with\ndifferent patterns of comorbid conditions and (d) con-\ntinuing to study possible pathophysiologic connections\nbetween COPD and comorbidities. Further research\nshould also continue to explore the effects comorbid\nconditions have on outcomes (health-related and other)\nin COPD.\nLimitations\nAs spirometry data is not available in NHANES 1999\u00ad\n2006, we were not able to look at comorbidities in the\ncontext of the severity of COPD. This is significant be-\ncause a recent study showed that increased respiratory\nimpairment was associated with a higher risk of having\ncomorbid hypertension, CVD, and diabetes [8].\nAlso due to the absence of spirometry data, we defined\nCOPD via self-report. While this does not meet the gold\nstandard definition for COPD (which is spirometric) [5],\nwe are aware of no other applicable datasets that are\nnationally-representative and as comprehensive and\npants; but, given the changing demographics of the US,\nit is unlikely this data is entirely representative of the\ncurrent US population.\nWe acknowledge that the prevalence of comorbidities\nin physician-diagnosed COPD may be different than\nthat in spirometrically-defined COPD; for example,\npatients with a higher burden of disease and lower\nhealth status may be more likely to receive a physician\ndiagnosis of COPD. There is also likely misclassification\nof some subjects - subjects with spirometrically-defined\nCOPD in the group without physician-diagnosed COPD,\nand subjects who reported a physician-diagnosis of\nCOPD, but who would not meet spirometric criteria.\nGiven the available data, and the desire to assess comor-\nbidities in a larger sample of adults across multiple waves\nof NHANES, we believe physician-diagnosed COPD is a\nrelevant outcome.\nA study by Barr et al. found that self-report-based sur-\nveys are an appropriate way to study respiratory disease\nin healthcare professionals [44], and many studies of\ncomorbidities in COPD have used self-report [20]. We\nfound little difference in the prevalence of comorbid\nconditions between COPD subjects with and without a\nhistory of smoking, which helps validate our definition\nof COPD. Our definitions of many of the comorbidities\nwere similarly limited by the need to, in some cases, de-\nfine conditions by self-report.\nWe were also limited by factors included in the\nNHANES data set. We would have liked to assess war-\nfarin use in COPD patients (our sample size was too\nTable 3 Comparison: the prevalence of comorbidities in subjects with COPD from previous studies\nSource n Study location Age\nrange\nMethod of\ncomorbidity\nascertainment\nArthritis HTN Diabetes Depression Cancer Osteoporosis\n(%) (%) (%) (%) (%) (%)\nvan Manen\nwritten survey\nfrom GPRD*\nMembers\ncodes\nWalsh and\ninternet surveys\n*General Practice Research Database.

While 96.4%\nof adults 45 and older with COPD have at least one con-\ndition that may complicate the treatment of COPD, few\ntrials or practice guidelines take these conditions into\nconsideration. Describing the nationally-representative\nprevalence of comorbid conditions in patients with\nphysician-diagnosed COPD is the first step towards\ndeveloping an evidence base, and clinical practice guide-\nlines, that better represent the true population of patients\nwith COPD.\nCompeting interests\nDr. Bruce Leff has served on a strategic advisory board to Amedisys Inc and\nhas consulted with Intersection LLC via a consulting agreement between\nIntersection LLC and Johns Hopkins Medicine.
