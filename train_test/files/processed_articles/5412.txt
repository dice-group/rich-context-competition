Smoking increases the risk of death from cancers, heart disease, stroke, or chronic\nrespiratory disease (WHO, 2009). Even low nicotine intake is risky. Smoking 1\u00ad4\nRecreational drug use and fluctuating asymmetry\ncigarettes per day correlates positively with the risk of death from ischaemic heart disease\n(Bjartveit and Tverdal, 2005); also, even occasional smokers have a higher risk of\ndeveloping smoking-related cancers (Bjerregaard et al., 2006). Alcohol causes oesophageal\ncancer, liver disease, epilepsy, and motor vehicle accidents (WHO, 2002). Using cannabis\ncauses an epithelial injury of the trachea and major bronchi and increases the risk of\nchronic bronchitis, acute bronchitis, and possibly schizophrenia (WHO, 1997). New\npsychoactive substances--so-called designer drugs--may also pose serious public health\nproblem, and they are difficult to monitor (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and\nPeople use recreational drugs for a variety of reasons (Boys et al., 2001; Labouvie\nand Bates, 2002; Meyer et al., 2002), but since all drugs pose some health risk, it can be\nsupposed that those who decide to use are more prone to take risks.\nFor young people (particularly boys or young men), drug use is often related to\nshowing off and making an impression on others (Abolfotouh et al., 1998; Al-Naggar, Al-\nHusseini, 2010; Percy, Wilson, McCartan, and McCrystal, 2011). The problem is that any\ndrug may produce unpleasant side effects. However, the intensity of such effects may differ\nbetween individuals, and it is therefore likely that some people can more easily bear these\nside effects or can otherwise afford to engage in such risky behavior. According to the\nhandicap principle (HP) of Zahavi (1975), the ability to risk one's health in this way can be\nclassified as a handicap that might impress peers or potential mates. It has already been\npostulated that drug use might be related to sexual selection. It has been shown, for\ninstance, that smoking by 13\u00ad15 years boys (but not girls) might increase their\nattractiveness (The Global Youth Tobacco Survey Collaborative Group, 2002). Smoking\nalso lowers voice pitch, and studies show that lower voices are perceived as more attractive\nin men (Collins, 2000; Feinberg, Jones, Little, Burt, and Perrett, 2005) but not in women\n(Borkowska and Pawlowski, 2011; Collins and Missing, 2003). It is therefore possible that\nin the case of men, one might expect a trade-off between health-risking behavior and the\npotential increase of attractiveness. Might cigarette smoking or binge drinking have an\nadvertising purpose? It has been proposed that by using these toxic substances, individuals\nshow that they are genetically well equipped to be able to overcome the harmful effects of\ndrugs (Diamond, 1996). However, if such sexual selection still takes place, regular smoking\nor drinking should be an honest signal of biological quality. It is possible that those\nindividuals who use drugs can better cope with metabolizing different stimulants and/or\nhave less painful discomfort in the case of overdosing. As it is postulated in the HP, only\nthose individuals who have good genetic quality can afford either the costly morphological\nstructures (Zahavi and Zahavi, 1999), high level of immunosuppressive sex steroid\nhormones that influence sexual dimorphic traits (Folstad and Karter, 1992), or risky\nbehavior. It is then possible that those people who use recreational drugs can biologically\nafford such health risks; in other words, they have a better biological condition (or better\ngenetic quality) on average.\nThe widely accepted and often used method of measuring biological condition is\nmeasuring bodily fluctuating asymmetry (FA) (Tomkins and Kotiaho, 2001, but see Van\nDongen and Gangestad, 2011). FA is a random deviation from the ideal bilateral symmetry.\nRecreational drug use and fluctuating asymmetry\nIt is supposed that despite possible factors affecting development and growth, organisms\nwith good genes are able to secure enough energy that can be spent on body symmetry\n(M\u00f8ller and Swaddle, 1997). This means that more symmetrical individuals (with lower\nFA) might have better genetic quality. This presumption has been confirmed in the\nmorbidity of men (e.g., mentally disabled men have higher FA) (see Kowner, 2001) or by\nthe frequency of male health problems (men with higher FA get ill more frequently than\nmen with lower FA) (Waynforth, 1998). A meta-analysis of the relationship between FA\nand health and genetic quality (Van Dongen and Gangestad, 2011) has confirmed a robust\nassociation, although it has also demonstrated unexplained large variation across studies\nand overestimations of the strength of association, which is driven by publication bias.\nApart from drug use, there are other behaviors that are related to health risk, such as\ntattooing and piercing. A considerable percentage of people who have had body\nscarification have suffered health complications as a result: bacterial and viral infections,\nallergic reactions, and transmission of blood borne diseases (see Huxley and Grogan,\n2005). In this case, Koziel, Kretschmer, and Pawlowski (2010) showed that in comparison\nto the control group, men who had tattoos or non conventional piercings were more\nsymmetrical (had lower FA).\nTo our knowledge, drug use in the context of biological quality--assessed as\ndevelopmental stability measured by FA--has not been studied in the context of the\nhandicap principle.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThe subjects were Polish students of the University of Wroclaw and students of the\nwere from the same ethnic group, had the same education, and were similar in age.\nFluctuating asymmetry measurements\nSix bilaterally symmetrical traits were measured: length of II \u00ad V digits (from the\ntip of the finger to the ventral proximal crease), wrist breadth, and ear height (from the\nanterior to the posterior tip of the pinna). This combination of traits has been used in\nprevious studies of (Martin, Manning, and Dowrick, 1999; Manning, Gage, Diver, Scutt,\nMeasures were taken using digital calipers of 0.01 mm accuracy and recorded onto\na dictaphone. Each trait was measured three times and averaged. The reliability of the\nmeasurements was calculated using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) (M\u00fcller and\nIn order to check for directional asymmetry (DA), for each trait we calculated the\ndifference between the right and left (Palmer and Strobeck, 1992) and then conducted one-\nsample t-tests with the mean set at zero. Three traits showed DA: III digit (left longer), IV\nRecreational drug use and fluctuating asymmetry\ndigit (right longer) and the wrist (right wider) (see Table 1). Although according to Palmer\nand Strobeck (1992) directional asymmetry is genetically programmed and does not reflect\ndevelopmental noise, Leamy (1999) suggested that directional asymmetry can also be used\nas an indicator of developmental stability. Lalumi\u00e8re, Harris, and Rice (1999) made use of\ntwo versions of FA indices--the first one with all measured traits and the second one\nwithout the traits showing DA--and they obtained comparable results.\nTable 1. Results of one-sample t-tests for the difference between the right and left side of\neach trait\nTrait Mean R-L t p\nFor each trait, the distribution of signed asymmetry was tested for skewness and\nkurtosis (Palmer and Strobeck 1992). No value departed from normality (skewness: range\nWe calculated the absolute value of each difference between the right and left side\nand divided it by the mean size of a given trait; relative asymmetry obtained in this way\n)\nL\nR\n(\n|\nL\nR\n|\n\n\n\nSince the combined FA of several traits is a better indicator of developmental\ninstability than the FA of a single trait (Dufour and Weatherhead, 1996; Gangestad and\nThornhill, 1999), we calculated the arithmetic mean of relative FA for all the traits. In this\nway we obtained a total fluctuating asymmetry (tFA) for each person. In a similar way to\nLalumiere et al. (1999), we used two versions of tFA: the first one included all six traits,\nand the second one excluded the traits that showed directional asymmetry. The results did\nnot differ between these measures, so we present only the results obtained for the second\ntype of tFA (without directionally asymmetrical traits). In some cases we obtained\nmeasures of five bilateral traits instead of six. This was the case for 19 women and 30 men\nwho either declared injuries, had deformed ears by piercing, or the proximal crease of a\ndigit was reduced. Similar methods have been used by Milne et al. (2003).\nIntra-class correlation coefficients for FA amounted to the following: II digit: 0.87;\nRecreational drug use and fluctuating asymmetry\nQuestionnaires\nQuestionnaires included questions about birth date, height and weight, smoking,\nalcohol drinking frequency, and use of other drugs (e.g., cannabis, amphetamine, or\ndesigner drugs). Current and former regular smokers were asked about age and reason of\nsmoking initiation, and current regular smokers also declared the number of cigarettes\nsmoked per day.\nSelf-reported data on height and weight were included in order to control for BMI,\nwhich may correlate with FA, at least in females (Milne et al., 2003). There is good\nevidence that younger adults report their height and weight accurately (e.g., Gro\u00dfsch\u00e4dl,\nHaditsch, and Stronegger, 2012; Kuczmarski, Kuczmarski, and Najjar, 2001). Participants\nwere given the opportunity to weigh themselves on a digital scale if they did not know their\nown weight. We used values with accuracy to 1 cm (height) and 1 kg (weight).\nTo analyze smoking, we divided participants into the groups non-smokers,\noccasional smokers, and regular smokers (see Table 2). Only participants who had never\nsmoked were treated as non-smokers, former smokers (13 women, 23 men) were not\ncompared with the other groups, but they were included in the analyses of age and reason\nof smoking initiation.\nThe question about number of cigarettes smoked per day was open-ended, and we\ncreated three categories on the basis of the answers provided: 1\u00ad5, 6\u00ad10 and more than 10\ncigarettes per day (a similar classification was used by Jones, Kann, and Pechacek [2011])\n(see Table 2). Regarding the age of smoking initiation, we also created three categories (see\nTable 2) related to the likely peer context (secondary school, high school, and university).\nParticipants who smoked regularly and used to smoke in the past were also asked to\nindicate the main reason for smoking initiation (because of stress, to not stand out, and to\nshow off in order to be perceived as an adult) or wrote their own answers. The responses to\nthis question that suggested the influence of the other people were collected into the\ncategory under social pressure or stress (SP; n = 8 women, 13 men), whereas responses\nsuch as out of curiosity, for pleasure, or for fun were classified as non-related to social\nmen either did not remember the specific reason for smoking initiation or it was difficult to\ndistinguish between SP and NSP reasons. We assumed that susceptibility to interpersonal\ninfluence as an aspect of social conformity may not reflect high biological quality\ncompared to someone's own decision-making about smoking. We also presumed that\nsmoking because of stress is a sign of weakness rather than strength; therefore we\nconnected this option together with interpersonal influence as a combined group of the\nfactors unrelated with potential high biological quality.\nAlcohol drinking frequency was studied using the same five categories as in Babor,\nHigging-Biddle, Saunders, and Monteiro (2001): never, monthly or less, 2-4 times a month,\n2-3 times a week, and 4 or more times a week. Because of the small number of participants\nin the extreme groups, we combined the first two categories (not more than once a month),\nand we did the same with the two categories of the most frequent alcohol consumption\n(more often than 4 times a month). In this way we obtained 3 categories (see Table 2).\nSimilarly, we distinguished three answers about drug or designer drug use: never,\noccasionally, and regularly, but since no woman declared regular intake, we compared\nRecreational drug use and fluctuating asymmetry\nonly two categories: not taking and taking any drugs (see Table 2).\nTable 2.

Parentheses indicate numbers of participants who smoked occasionally at the time of study but\nregularly earlier.\nRecreational drug use and fluctuating asymmetry\nWe also calculated the total amount of substance use. In order to obtain equal\nimportance for each kind of substance (cigarettes, alcohol, and drug or designer drug), we\ndivided every group into the three categories: cigarettes: non-smokers (1 point), occasional\nsmokers (2 points), and regular smokers (3 points); alcohol: no more than one time a month\n(1 pt.), 2-4 times a month (2 pts.), and more often than 4 times a month (3 pts.); drug or\ndesigner drug: not taking (1 pt.), taking occasionally (2 pts.), and taking regularly (3 pts.).\nScores were summed for each participant, and we obtained seven ranks from 3 to 9 points.\nSince no woman obtained 9 points and only four women scored 8 points, the last three\ncategories were combined into one category: at least 7 points (see Table 2).\nStatistical methods\nIntra-class correlation coefficients were calculated using the two-way random\neffects mode (M\u00fcller and B\u00fcttner, 1994, as cited in Kornhuber et al., 2011), which was\nperformed in SPSS Statistics 17.0.0. The other analyses were carried out in Statistica 9.\nDifferences in tFA between groups and sexes were tested by two-way analysis of variance.\nResults\nBMI did not differ between all compared subgroups of recreational drug users (p >\n0.07); therefore, we did not control for this factor in further analyses. We compared tFA\nindices in all categories of the studied addiction habits (i.e., smoking frequency, alcohol\ndrinking frequency, drug or designer drug use, and total substance use) (see Table 2). We\ndid not find any significant relationship, nor was there any significant interaction between\ntFA in these groups and sex (see Table 3). There was also no relationship between smoking\ninitiation age or the cause of this initiation and FA (see Table 3). Men and women did not\nTable 3. Results of two-way ANOVA with sex and group as independent factors and\nrecreational drug use as dependent variable\nn\nSex Group Interaction\nF p F p F p\nRecreational drug use and fluctuating asymmetry\nDiscussion\nOur results do not confirm that drug use can be a good indicator of biological\nquality measured by fluctuating asymmetry. This also means that we found no support for\ndrug use as an example of Zahavi's (1975) handicap principle. We also did not find any\nsignificant relationship with the age of smoking initiation and the causes of this initiation.\nIn this case, however, the results should be treated very cautiously, because many\nparticipants could not remember the circumstances and the causes of smoking initiation,\nand those who specified the cause of smoking initiation were very often not precise enough\nin this respect. Even when specified, given the time lag, such self-reported, subjective\ninformation should be also treated cautiously.\nWe should also take into account that fluctuating asymmetry is a result of two\nopposing influences: developmental noise and developmental stability (see Lens, Van\nDongen, Kark, and Matthysen, 2002). Thus, FA in our study is not an ideal measure of\ngenetic quality. An example of environmental stressors during prenatal development may\nbe exposure to alcohol and nicotine. There is evidence that alcohol consumption by a\npregnant woman increases the asymmetry of children's heads (dziska, 2003), faces\n(Klingenberg et al., 2010), and dentition (Kieser, 1992), and tobacco smoking by a father\nalso disturbs the head symmetry of a child (dziska, 2003). Furthermore, alcohol use\n(Hayes, Smart, Toumbourou, and Sanson, 2004; Hung, Yen, and Wu, 2009) and smoking\n(Eaton, 2008; Gilman et al., 2009) are influenced by parental drinking and smoking habits.\nHypothetically, subjects who use recreational drugs relatively often might have been\nexposed to alcohol and nicotine during intrauterine growth, and such a stressful\nenvironment would reduce their bodily symmetry. The fact that we did not control for\nparental drinking and smoking habits is a limitation of our study.\nThe other potential limitation of our study is related to the data on alcohol\nconsumption. Our subjects responded to the question of how many occasions they\nconsumed alcohol and did not indicate what amount of alcohol they consumed in each\nepisode. Consuming small quantities of alcohol (particularly by older people) is not\nnecessarily harmful to one's health (Abramson, Williams, and Krumholz, 2001; Rimm,\nWilliams, Fosher, Criqui, and Stampfer, 1999). Although we do not have data regarding the\nquantity of alcohol consumed, considering the cultural habits of alcohol consumption by\nyoung people (mainly students) in the studied population, we may reasonably presume that\ndrinking sessions (usually in the social contexts) mentioned by our subjects were related\nwith at least moderate (if not heavy) alcohol consumption and, therefore, posed some\nhealth risk. Nevertheless, due to the lack of precise information about the amount of\nalcohol consumed, our results on alcohol drinking and FA should be treated cautiously.\nSince even occasional smoking and small amounts of drugs are harmful, there is no doubt\nthat our results for smoking and drugs consumption are related to health-risk behavior.\nThe obtained results indicate that genes related to biological quality are not a better\npredictor of substance use than already well-known predicting factors, such as genes not\ndirectly related to biological condition (Kendler and Prescott, 1998; Madden, Bucholz,\nMartin, and Heath, 2000) and environmental or psychological factors: e.g., life stress\nRecreational drug use and fluctuating asymmetry\nSchmid, Gabhainn, Fotiou, and Volleberg, 2006). However, it is possible that in the\nmodern western society, easy access to different substances and a more stressful lifestyle\nprecludes detecting a relationship between biological quality (measured with FA) and\nproneness to substance use. It would be interesting to study this relationship in traditional\nsocieties where the handicap hypothesis related to drug use may be detected, at least in\nyoung men. The possibility that in our evolutionary past \"recreational substances\" may not\nhave been used at all or were different from those used in modern western countries does\nnot necessarily undermine our evolutionary reasoning, because we focus on risk-taking\nbehavior and not on the mental mechanisms related to specific types of recreational\nsubstances. It is well known that the recreational substances mentioned here are usually\nunhealthy and, therefore, using them poses some health risk. Furthermore, studies indicate\nthat there is a moderate positive correlation (rs between 0.4 and 0.5) between health and\nproneness to recreational risk-taking behavior (Johnson, Wilke, and Weber, 2004; Weber,\nBlais, and Betz, 2002). This means that health risk itself can be studied as an estimation of\nproneness to risk-taking in all situations that are related to health and, therefore, fitness\nproblems.\nThere are studies showing that taking health risks is more likely by young men in\nthe context of sexual selection, e.g., attracting short-term partners (Burriss, Rowland, and\nLittle, 2009). Men, for instance, disdain health risks more than women (Wilson, Daly,\nGordon, and Pratt, 1996). The potential example of showing off a readiness to take health\nrisks by men is tattooing and non-conventional piercing (Koziel et al., 2010). On the other\nhand, drug taking (Farthing, 2005) and health\u00adrisk taking in general appeared to be\nunattractive in potential partners by both sexes (Wilke, Hutchinson, Todd, and Kruger,\n2006). This, however, does not mean that health risk cannot be considered a potential\nattractor in intersexual selection. Firstly, it has been shown that the attractiveness of taking\na physical risk may depend on sexual strategy. Although both men and women prefer risk-\navoiding partners for long-term relationships, they seem to accept risk-takers in short-term\nrelationships (Sylwester and Pawlowski, 2011). It has also been shown that women under\nthe influence of alcohol and drugs engage in short-term liaisons more often than sober\nwomen (Grello, Welsh, and Harper, 2006). Furthermore, the amount of money spent on\nalcohol is a good predictor of unrestrictiveness in sexual behavior (Clark, 2004). Using\nhealth-risking drugs might play some role in intra-male competition and hierarchy, which\nto our knowledge has not been studied. It can be hypothesized that stronger and more\ndominant young men are more prone to take health risks and start using stimulants earlier.\nIn summary, we did not find support for the hypothesis that smoking, drinking, or\nusing drugs serve as a signal of biological quality or are related to the handicap principle\nhypothesis.\n"
