    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn two studies, participants completed measures of trait empathy and social dominance orientation, read a summary of a hit\nand run trial, and provided reactions to the case. In Study 1, the three randomly assigned conditions included a prompt to\nempathize with the victims, the empathy prompt with a mortality salience manipulation, and a control condition. Participants\nhigh in trait empathy were harsher in their judgments of the defendant than were low empathy participants, particularly after\nhaving read the mortality salience prompt. The results indicated that mortality salience had triggered personality differences.\nParticipants high in social dominance assigned harsher sentences across conditions. Study 2 involved the same paradigm, but\nthe prompts were presented on behalf of the defendant. Despite the pro-defendant slant, the pattern of results was similar\nto Study 1. Differences by trait empathy were more apparent among participants experiencing mortality salience, and social\ndominance was related to sentence choices. There were no indications in either study of mortality salience increasing bias\nagainst defendants in general or increasing racial bias.\n",

Anxiety ensues at\nthe thought of death, and people feel a need to buffer against\nthat existential anxiety. One response is to cling to beliefs\nthat give meaning to life and provide a sense of security.\nReaffirming personal belief systems, including political and\nreligious beliefs, provides some anxiety relief (Solomon,\nPeople with death anxiety, therefore, value their own cul-\ntural worldview; they value the set of beliefs that give them\na sense of belonging and worth as a way of transcending\nexistential angst. In turn, people tend to value others with\nsimilar beliefs when dealing with death anxiety. Ingroup\nmembership provides a feeling of belonging and validates\nthe shared worldview; as such, ingroup evaluation rises with\ndeath anxiety. \"Across different countries more than 350\nstudies have found that reminders of mortality increase such\nresponses as positive evaluations of those who validate the\nparticipants' belief system and negative evaluation of those\nTerror Management Theory therefore posits that people\ntend to be more discriminatory toward those they perceive as\ndifferent from themselves, or as violating the values of their\nworldview, when death is salient. When faced with the idea of\ntheir own mortality, people seek to solidify their own cultural\nworldview as a form of protection against feelings of anxiety\nand terror. Individuals reward those who validate their own\nbelief system and reject those whom they deem to hold an\nopposing worldview (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon,\npeople of different races or religions as well as people who\nhave violated the law. For example, mortality salience has been\nlinked to legal judgments about prostitutes (Jonas et al., 2008;\nRosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, & Lyon, 1989),\njail sentencing (Greenberg, Schimel, Martens, Solomon, &\nPyszczynski, 2001), hate crimes (Lieberman,Arndt, Personius,\nerty crimes, fraud, and negligence cases (Dechesne et al., 2003;\nFlorian & Mikulincer, 1997), among others.\n1Ramapo College of New Jersey, Mahwah, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDonna Crawley, School of Social Science and Human Services, Ramapo\nEmail: dcrawley@ramapo.edu\nEmpathy, Social Dominance Orientation,\nMortality Salience, and Perceptions of a\nCriminal Defendant\nDonna Crawley1 and Richard Suarez1\n Keywords\nmortality salience, empathy, social dominance orientation, criminal justice, gender\n2 SAGE Open\nHowever, the exact effects of mortality salience regarding\nlegal decisions differ from study to study, as a function of the\nnature of the case and experimental paradigm, the values and\npersonality traits of the perceivers, and the type of dependent\nmeasure examined. For example,Arndt, Lieberman, Cook, and\nSolomon (2005) reviewed a series of terror management stud-\nies involving legal judgments; an analysis of those 25 studies\nindicated that in approximately 70%, participants experiencing\nmortality salience were harsher in their judgments of criminal\nor civil defendants. However, those effects were sometimes\nmitigated by personality factors. Furthermore, in approxi-\nmately 20% of the studies reviewed, mortality salience had no\neffect or increased leniency. Finally, 10% of the studies exam-\nined racial effects, and judgments were harsher against defen-\ndants of a different racial group as compared with ingroup\nmembers. Thus, although most of the research found greater\nbias against those who had violated the law in mortality salience\nconditions, especially if they were of another racial group, that\nfinding was not true in all situations.\nJonas et al. (2008) argued that mortality salience increases\npeople's desires and proclivities to cling to their cultural\nworldviews and values, but that the specific values salient in a\ngiven situation differ based on what is primed in that situation.\nFor example, Jonas, Schimel, Greenberg, and Pyszczynski\n(2002) found greater generosity toward personally valued\ncharities over neutral charities among participants in a mortal-\nity salience condition. In later research, Jonas et al. (2008)\ndemonstrated that mortality salience sometimes leads to\ngreater altruism toward others, even outgroup members, when\nprosocial values are primed and the target is relevant to the\nprime. For example, when a prosocial norm was experimen-\ntally primed in participants, mortality salience resulted in a\ngreater tendency to help others, especially when the altruistic\ntargets were children (Jonas et al., 2008). Prosocial norms are\nparticularly strong when children are involved (cf. Penner,\nDovidio, Piliavin, & Schroeder, 2005). Thus, there appears to\nbe an interaction among factors that can result in greater help-\ning rather than greater discrimination under mortality salience\nconditions.\nConsistent with the findings of Jonas et al. (2008), there\nmay be cultural differences in reactions to mortality salience.\nFor people from Western cultures, mortality salience\nincreases adherence to an individualistic worldview, and a\npersonal defensive stance. Thus, unless primed with proso-\ncial norms, those from Western cultures tend to value similar\nothers, and to show greater prejudice against different others\nwhile in a death aware state. However, people from eastern\ncultures hold a different type of worldview featuring a more\ncollectivist perspective. Ma-Kellams and Blascovich (2011)\ndemonstrated that mortality salience increased the tendency\nof participants from eastern cultures to defend others and to\nreaffirm a collective mentality.\nThus, although there are hundreds of studies supporting\nthe role of mortality salience in increasing adherence to per-\nsonal and cultural values, the outcomes of specific mortality\nsalience conditions depends on many factors: The cultural\nworldview held, the specific values within that worldview\nthat are primed at the time of response, and the relevance of\nthe attitudinal target to the primed values.\nTerror Management and Justice\nDisparities by Race\nRacial disparities in treatment by the justice system are well-\ndocumented. \"African-Americans make up 13% of the gen-\neral US population, yet they constitute 28% of all arrests,\n40% of all inmates held in prisons and jails, and 42% of the\npopulation on death row\" (Hartney & Vuong, 2009, p. 2).\nRacial disparities have been documented with respect to\npolice contacts (Crutchfield, Skinner, Haggerty, McGlynn, &\nof sanctions across decision points within the criminal jus-\ntice system (Stolzenberg, D'Alessio, & Eitle, 2013). See\nKansal and Mauer (2005) and the report by the American\nCivil Liberties Union (ACLU, 2014) on Racial Disparities in\nSentencing, submitted to the Inter-American Commission on\nHuman Rights for reviews of the literature on race and\nsentencing.\nFactors affecting racial disparities in treatment are numer-\nous, complex, and involve both overt and subtle forms of\ndiscrimination. Under certain circumstances, mortality\nsalience may be one of the subtle contributing factors to\nracial disparities in treatment within the criminal justice sys-\ntem. As discussed above, when manipulated in research stud-\nies, mortality salience has been shown to increase bias\nagainst criminal defendants, particularly outgroup defen-\ndants. In actual criminal proceedings, the types of cases\nlikely to \"naturally\" invoke mortality salience within jurors,\nattorneys, and the public are cases involving death, some of\nwhich would be capital cases. Thus, cases in which death has\noccurred could trigger mortality salience, adding to potential\nracial biases in treatment.\nIf it were true that mortality salience increases the ten-\ndency for individuals to judge criminal defendants harshly,\nespecially defendants from a racial group different than the\nperceiver, then there are some specific patterns of racial dis-\nparity that should appear. First, there should be greater racial\ndisparity within the criminal justice system in regions where\nthe racial composition of a jury is likely to be different than\na minority defendant. There is statistical evidence that this is\ntrue. Within the United States, the states with the highest lev-\nels of racial disparity in incarceration are among those with\nthe lowest levels of diversity within the state population. For\nexample, we compared the 10 states with the highest levels\nof racial diversity and the 10 least diverse states, based on the\npercentage of non-White, foreign-born, and mixed race pop-\nulations (Emerson, 2011). Racial disparity in incarceration in\n2011 for the most diverse states was significantly less than\nthe disparity for the homogeneous states, based on data from\nCrawley and Suarez 3\nincarceration ratio for the 10 most diverse states was 5.87:1\n(SD = 2.17) and the mean ratio for the homogeneous states\nthe mean Black:White population ratio in the diverse states\nneous states was .05:1, based on U.S. census data. Thus, the\nhomogeneous states have proportionally more Black indi-\nviduals incarcerated even though the proportion of Blacks in\nthe state population is lower. Furthermore, the relatively high\nracial disparity in prison in these homogeneous states does\nnot appear to be due to overt racism in general within those\nregions. For instance, we note that most diverse states in this\nsample have more hate groups (M = 22.78) listed by the\nSouthern Poverty Law Center (2014) than the least diverse\nSecond, there should be significant racial disparity in\ntreatment in cases involving death. An examination of mur-\nder cases and racial disparities in the death penalty would be\ninformative. Sorensen and Wallace (1999) found that Black\nindividuals accused of killing Whites were more likely to be\ncharged with first-degree murder by prosecutors, with the\npossibility of the death penalty, than any other racial combi-\nnation in murder cases. Furthermore, 97.5% of the chief\nDistrict Attorneys making decisions about whether or not to\npursue the death penalty in this time period were White in the\nUnited States; only 1.2% were African American (Pokorak,\n1998). This pattern of racial disparity in charging was sub-\nstantiated more recently by Baldus, Grosso, Woodworth, and\nNewell (2011) in their examination of military death penalty\ncases.\nWith respect to sentencing, in 2002, the Supreme Court\nruled that within jurisdictions that have capital punishment,\ndefendants have the right to have a jury decide on eligibility\nfor a death sentence, rather than a judge alone (Ring v.\nArizona). Therefore, in death penalty cases, unlike other types\nof cases, the jury plays a significant role in the sentencing.And\nin death penalty cases, the jury is likely to be in a state of mor-\ntality salience. Research indicates that racial disparity in sen-\ntencing does increase as the severity of sentences increases.\nBlack defendants are more likely to receive the death penalty\nin murder cases than are White defendants, controlling for\nother relevant legal factors (ACLU, 2014; Baldus &\nWoodworth, 2004; Baldus, Woodworth, Zuckerman, Weiner,\nWhat of cases involving death that are not death penalty\ncases? In these cases, judges decide the sentences rather than\nthe jury, often with state guidelines informing their deci-\nsions. In her study of over 1,000 homicide cases in\nPhiladelphia, 98.8% of which did not involve the death pen-\nalty, Auerhahn (2007) found that while race alone did not\npredict sentences, it did interact with age and other charac-\nteristics to increase sentence severity.\nIn contrast, the literature on racial disparities in sentenc-\ning across nonhomicide cases is mixed (Mitchell, Haw,\nfound race to be a small factor in sentencing across cases in\ntheir review of the Pennsylvania courts. Auerhahn's (2007)\nreview of the literature indicates that most, but not all, stud-\nies of race and sentencing find harsher sentences for minority\ndefendants across crime categories. Yet, data on weapons\noffenses do not show racial disparities in sentencing (Hartney\nHartney and Vuong (2009) indicate that racial disparities in\nsentencing appear to be the greatest for drug offenses.\nBased on the pattern of findings cited above, mortality\nsalience may be one of the factors affecting judgments by\nprosecutors, judges, and juries in death related cases, and\nthus merits study. Racial bias in death penalty cases is clear,\nfor example, and racial disparity in incarceration is more\ncommon in regions which are overwhelmingly White.\nHowever, racial disparities within the criminal justice system\nappear to be prevalent in a wide variety of cases, not just\nthose involving death. Thus, mortality salience is but one of\nmany factors leading to potential biases in criminal justice\ncases.\nFurthermore, past research has documented that the effects\nof mortality salience depend on situational primes and indi-\nvidual differences in personal values (cf. Arndt et al., 2005).\nIf indeed mortality salience leads to a reaffirmation of per-\nsonal belief systems as a way of relieving anxiety (Solomon\net al., 2004), then individual value systems moderate the\neffect of mortality salience on judgments of others, including\ncriminal defendants. For example, two personality traits that\nhave been linked to judgments of criminal defendants, and\nwhich may interact with mortality salience, are empathy and\nsocial dominance orientation.\nIndividual Differences Affecting\nPerceptions of Criminal Defendants\nEmpathy\nEmpathy has been defined in various ways by different\nresearchers. Mehrabian and Epstein (1972) discussed two\ntypes of empathy: cognitive empathy and emotional empathy.\nCognitive empathy involves understanding another's reac-\ntions and feelings, while emotional empathy is a shared emo-\ntional response to what another is experiencing. Mehrabian\nand Epstein designed a measure of emotional empathy, and\nduring validation found that this measure correlated nega-\ntively with aggression toward another, and positively with\naltruistic behavior. People scoring high in empathy tended to\nbe less aggressive and more helpful to others.\nSimilar to the definition of emotional empathy above,\nHoffman (1987) has defined empathy as \"an affective\nresponse more appropriate to someone else's situation than to\none's own\" (p. 48). He also discussed the role of empathy in\nthe perception of justice. Empathy toward the victim of a per-\nceived offense is particularly strong if a person can readily\nidentify with the victim and the victim's actions at the time of\n4 SAGE Open\nthe crime (cf. Sundby, 2003). In addition to expressed support\nfor such a victim, Hoffman described the development of\nempathic anger, a process by which environmental cues divert\na perceiver's empathic attention from a victim, and turn that\nattention into empathic anger at the culprit responsible for\nharm to the victim. Rather than focus emotion on the victim,\nthe emotional reaction becomes focused on the offender in\nthe situation. Within a legal case involving victim harm,\ntherefore, empathy with the victim may be exhibited in terms\nof harsh judgments against a defendant.\nIn contrast, it is also possible to induce empathy for a\ndefendant, depending on the type of offense and characteris-\ntics of the defendant. Such empathy should result in more\nlenient judgments against the defendant. These effects have\nbeen demonstrated in research by Plumm and Terrance\n(2009) with a simulated domestic violence trial, and with a\npatricide mock trial in research by Haegerich and Bottoms\n(2000). In both cases, manipulations of mock juror empathy\naffected perceptions of the defendant.\nIn addition, empathy has been found to interact with mor-\ntality salience in affecting perceptions of offenders. Schimel,\nWohl, and Williams (2006) demonstrated that overall people\nare more likely to forgive an ingroup member for an aggres-\nsive act than an outgroup member when in a mortality\nsalience condition. However, people high in trait empathy\nwere equally likely to forgive an outgroup offender as an\ningroup offender. Those low in empathy were only forgiving\nof the ingroup offender. Thus, there was an interaction\nbetween empathy and mortality salience in perceptions of an\noutgroup offender. Schimel et al. argued that to people high\nin empathy, exhibiting a sympathetic reaction is a value\nwithin their worldview and thus the tendency to be forgiving\nwas heightened by mortality salience with respect to both\ningroup and outgroup offenders. It is important to note that in\ntheir study, the empathic focus was on a male adult offender,\nthe same gender and age as the person injured.\nSocial Dominance Orientation\nPratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, and Malle (1994) have defined\nsocial dominance orientation as \"one's degree of preference\nfor inequality among social groups\" (p. 741). Past research-\ners have found respondents scoring high in social dominance\norientation to endorse conservative and nationalistic political\nexisting status hierarchies and stereotypes (Tausch &\nHewstone, 2010), military actions (Cohrs, Moschner, Maes,\n& Kielmann, 2005; Dunwoody, Plane, Trescher, & Rice,\n(B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m & Bj\u00f6rklund, 2007; Cohrs, K\u00e4mpfe-Hargrave,\ndominance was negatively related to support for women's\nrights, social programs, and gay and lesbian rights. In addi-\ntion, social dominance was found to be negatively related to\nempathy and tolerance (B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m & Bj\u00f6rklund, 2007;\nIn examining the interplay between social dominance ori-\nentation and mortality salience, Bassett (2010) found that\nparticipants who were high in social dominance were more\nnegative toward illegal immigrants in a mortality salience\ncondition, but not in a control condition. There was no main\neffect for mortality salience on attitudes toward illegal immi-\ngrants in Bassett's findings, only an interaction between\nsocial dominance orientation and mortality salience on atti-\ntudes. Similarly, Crawley, Bacs, Nascimento, and Pavon\n(2014) found that social dominance orientation was related\nto racial bias in the perceived guilt of a suspect in a fictional\nstabbing case in a mortality salience condition, but not in a\ncontrol condition.\nBased on all of the research described above, it appears\nthat mortality salience elicits anxiety and people attempt to\nalleviate that distress via adherence to their personal values\nand by embracing beliefs and others that are familiar.\nIndividual personality traits, such as empathy and social\ndominance orientation, reflect those personal values and thus\nshape the specific effects of mortality salience. Finally, situ-\national prompts also play a role in the form and strength with\nwhich those personal values are manifested. We designed the\npresent research to further investigate these relationships.\nThe focus of the present studies was on the impact of mortal-\nity salience, empathy, social dominance orientation, and race\non reactions toward a criminal defendant, specifically in a hit\nand run case.\nThe target of the dependent measures in these studies was\nthe defendant; the victims of the crime were children.\nTherefore, attitudes toward the defendant may be shaped in\npart by values evoked by reading about injured children. The\ncase presented to participants in a trial summary was based\non a real incident and part of the trial description was taken\nfrom an online news account of the actual trial to increase the\nrealism of the experimental materials. Although some details\nwere changed, including the names, ages, ethnicities, and\nlocation of the incident, the summary was very similar to\nwhat a person reading the news might encounter.\nWe designed this research to examine mortality salience in\nthe context of an ambiguous criminal case, rather than a case\nin which the evidence was overwhelming. Past research has\nindicated that the strength of presented evidence is a signifi-\ncant predictor of case judgments (cf. Devine, Clayton,\nDunford, Seying, & Pryce, 2001) such that biases tend to show\nup more in ambiguous cases. The hit and run case selected was\nnot clear cut; the evidence was open to interpretation.\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Mortality salience increases percep-\ntions of culpability for criminal suspects because, for\nmany people, criminals disrupt an ordered worldview.\nThis is particularly true when the victims of a crime are\nchildren because the normative value of protecting chil-\ndren is also salient.\nCrawley and Suarez 5\nHypothesis 2 (H2): Mortality salience increases bias\nagainst criminal suspects from different racial groups, at\nleast among participants from Western cultures.\nHypothesis 3 (H3): Empathy impacts judgments of crim-\ninal suspects alone and in interaction with mortality\nsalience.\nHypothesis 4 (H4): Social dominance impacts judgments\nof criminal suspects alone and in interaction with mortal-\nity salience.\nStudy 1 Method\nParticipants\nFour hundred and thirty-three adults completed an online\nThe racial diversity in the sample by self-identification was\nLatino/Hispanic, and 5.54% as either another racial group or\nwith a range from 18 to 75. Participants were solicited via\nmturk and a participant pool at a public college in the north-\neastern United States.\nMaterials and Procedure\nAn online survey included the following components: a\nconsent statement with a warning not to participate if the\nparticipant was at all depressed or would be discomforted\nby reading about a violent crime, a 33-item Empathy Scale\nOrientation Scale (Pratto et al., 1994), 11 items about expe-\nriences with the criminal justice system, and the presenta-\ntion of a trial summary for an alleged felony hit and run\ncase. Four dependent measures followed the trial summary,\nincluding a 6-point rating scale for defendant's probable\nguilt, a 6-point scale for confidence in that verdict, six sen-\ntence choices if the defendant were found guilty ranging\nfrom 200 hours of community service, no jail time to 10\nyears in prison per victim (max sentence allowed), and a\n6-point scale of the likelihood that the participant would\nforgive such a defendant. See Appendix A for a copy of the\ndependent measures. Finally, demographic items, a mortal-\nity salience manipulation check, and a debriefing com-\npleted the survey. The debriefing included an item asking if\nthe participant had been familiar with the case before the\nstudy began. The study used was based on an actual case\nthat had been adjudicated earlier in the year in the north-\nwest, although identifying details of the case were changed.\nAn additional change to the case was the outcome for the\nvictims. The victims in the actual case died; however, we\ndid not want all of our participants to be in a state of mortal-\nity salience; thus, we described the victims as injured rather\nthan killed. In total, 35 (11.33%) of the participants answer-\ning the question had heard of the case before.\nThe case presented involved a 22-year-old male named\nMichael who had driven through a pile of leaves, not know-\ning that there were two children playing in the leaves. The\nchildren, one male and one female, were described as \"seri-\nously injured.\" The driver heard a bump going through the\nleaves, but did not stop. He discovered later in the day that\nthe children had been hit by a car, but he did not contact the\npolice, nor did he return to the site of the crime (as required\nby law). The male was randomly described as an African\nAmerican, Asian, Hispanic, or White, and was given one of\nthe statistically most common surnames associated with each\nracial group in the United States (Washington, Wong,\nRodriguez, or Anderson). The neighborhood in which this\nincident took place was described as having a population of\nthe same racial identity as the defendant so that each case\ninvolved an intraracial incident.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of three ver-\nsions of the prosecutor's closing statement within the trial\nsummary. The prosecutor ended with a request that the jury\nthink about the fact that they themselves could be victims\nof a hit and run driver like the defendant (empathy condi-\ntion), that they themselves could be victims of a hit and run\ndriver like the defendant and could be killed (mortality\nsalience condition), or no such request was included (con-\ntrol condition).\nDesign\nThe study was a 3 (mortality salience, empathy, or control) \u00d7\n4 (race of defendant) factorial design, with the additional\npersonality variables of empathy and social dominance ori-\nentation. Participant race and gender were also included in\nanalyses. The dependent variables included rating of guilt,\nconfidence in verdict rating, sentence choice, and rating of\nlikely forgiveness.\nStudy 1 Results\nCorrelations Among Measures\nThere were significant correlations among the personality\nscores and dependent measures. For example, social domi-\nnance orientation was negatively correlated with empathy,\naddition, participant age correlated with guilt rating, forgive-\nness, and confidence as presented in Table 1.\nManipulation Check\nAt the end of the survey, participants were asked whether or\nnot they thought about their own possible deaths while com-\npleting the dependent measures. The response options were\n\"yes,\" \"slightly but not much,\" or \"not at all.\" These three\n6 SAGE Open\nresponses were not significantly correlated with the manipu-\nlation of mortality salience within the trial summary, 2(4, N\nthinking of death in the mortality salience condition than in\nthe other two conditions, the difference did not reach signifi-\ncance, even when combining the \"slightly but not much\" and\np = .07. Therefore, the analyses involving mortality salience\nwere done using self-reported thoughts of death as an indica-\ntion of the presence of mortality salience.\nFamiliarity With the Case\nThe dependent variables were analyzed to determine whether\nfamiliarity with the actual case before the study affected out-\ncomes for those participants who answered this question.\nAlthough the sample sizes are very different, there were no\nsignificant differences between those who had heard of the\ncase (n = 35) and those who reported they had not (n = 274)\nin the ratings of guilt (p = .41), confidence (p = .83), or sen-\ntence (p = .45). However, those familiar with the case were\nin the real case did forgive the defendant.\nGender Differences\nGender differences appeared for empathy scores, t(428) = 6.29,\nin social dominance orientation (M = 2.62, SD = 1.24) than did\nfemales (M = 2.15, SD = 1.01). We found no significant gender\ndifferences for the dependent variables.\nRace of the defendant. There were no main effects by the race\nof the defendant on any of the dependent variables (p = .61\nfor guilt, p = .99 for confidence, p = .30 for type of sentence,\nand p = .33 for forgiveness).\nHypotheses\nGiven the correlations among the dependent measures, we\nperformed a principal components analysis for the evaluative\ndependent variables of guilt, forgiveness, and sentence sever-\nity. This analysis resulted in a single component with an\nTherefore, we created a composite dependent variable as a\nmeasure of overall harshness toward the defendant consist-\ning of the sum of the guilt rating, the forgiveness rating, and\na rating (1-6) for the severity of the specific sentence chosen.\nFor each variable, the higher score indicated the harshest\njudgment of the defendant. The lowest possible score on the\ncomposite was a 3, indicating leniency toward the defendant,\nand the highest was an 18, indicating a very harsh reaction to\nthe defendant. This composite score was the primary depen-\ndent variable used in the analyses.\nFor most of the following analyses, we used a MANOVA\nto examine the effects of self-reported mortality salience,\ndefendant race, empathy, and social dominance orientation\non the composite measure and the rating of confidence. The\nself-reported responses of mortality salience of \"slightly, but\nnot much\" and \"no\" were combined for the analyses.\nH1 and H2: Mortality salience.There were no significant\nmain effects of mortality salience on the composite measure\nof harshness (p = .84) or on ratings of confidence in judg-\nment (p = .30). These results indicated no bias against the\ndefendant due to mortality salience.\nIn addition, there were no interactions between defendant\nrace and mortality salience for the composite score (p = .84)\nor confidence (p = .46). We also did these analyses using only\nthe White participants to examine same race/other race judg-\nments with a sufficient sample size and found no significant\neffects by mortality salience and defendant race. The first two\nhypotheses were not supported by these data.\nH3: Empathy and mortality salience. The mean empathy score\nwas 4.64 (SD = .60); participants with scores below the mean\nwere categorized as low in empathy (n = 227) and those\nTable 1. Correlations Among Personality Scores and Dependent Variables in Study 1.\nEmpathy SDO Guilt Confidence Forgiveness Age\nNote. SDO = Social Dominance Orientation.\nCrawley and Suarez 7\nabove the mean as high in empathy (n = 205). Respondents\nhigh in empathy had higher composite scores (M = 11.30,\nSD = 2.73), indicating harsher overall judgment of the defen-\ndant, than did participants low in empathy (M = 10.59,\nparticipants appeared to empathize with the victims more\nthan did low empathy participants, supporting H3. There was\nno significant two-way interaction between trait empathy\nand self-reported mortality salience on the composite mea-\nsure (p = .28). However, there was an interaction between\ntrait empathy and mortality salience experience for confi-\nexamination of the simple effects in post hoc comparisons\nindicated that high empathy participants experiencing mor-\ntality salience were significantly more confident (M = 4.88,\nSD = 1.03) than low empathy participants experiencing mor-\nlevel. There was no difference between high empathy\nSD = 1.03) participants without mortality salience. Differ-\nences in confidence by empathy category only appeared\nwhen mortality salience was also present.\nIn a separate analysis, we also examined the effect of\ntrait empathy on each of the individual dependent mea-\nsures as a function of the empathy prompts embedded in\nthe experimental texts. The three experimental conditions\ninvolved trial descriptions with no-prompt, an empathy-\nonly prompt, or an empathy with mortality salience prompt.\nIn this analysis, similar to the results above, respondents\nhigh in trait empathy were slightly more likely to find guilt\nas a main effect. However, the difference in guilt ratings by\ntrait empathy level occurred primarily in interaction with\np = .05, 2 = .01. An examination of the simple effects in\npost hoc comparisons indicated that high empathy partici-\npants in the mortality salience prompt condition were sig-\nnificantly more likely to rate the defendant guilty\n.002. There were no difference between high empathy and\nlow empathy participants in the other conditions (see\nFigure 1). Thus, neither the control condition nor the\nempathy-only prompt condition seemed to cause a differ-\nence in judgment by trait empathy. Only the mortality\nsalience prompt yielded such a result.\nH4: Social dominance orientation.Participants were catego-\nrized as high in social dominance orientation (n = 193) if\nand low in social dominance orientation (n = 240) if below\nthe mean. Although there were no significant main effects of\nsocial dominance orientation on the composite measure\n(p = .87) or confidence (p = .07), high social dominance\nparticipants were more likely to select a jail sentence for the\nlow in social dominance (see Figure 2).\nFinally, a significant three-way interaction was found\nbetween self-reported mortality salience, social dominance,\np = .002, 2 = .03.

These results support H3 and H4.\nDiscussion\nThere was no indication of mortality salience increasing bias\nagainst defendants in general or increasing bias against\ndefendants of a different racial group as some past research\non terror management theory might suggest. However,\nresults did indicate that mortality salience, empathy and\nsocial dominance orientation were all related in some way to\nthe participants' reactions to the events described in this hit\nand run trial summary.\nSchimel et al. (2006) also found an interaction between\nempathy and mortality salience in their research, with dif-\nferences by trait empathy appearing in the mortality salience\ncondition. In their research, the ingroup and outgroup\noffenders and victims were all adults, and high empathy par-\nticipants did not exhibit bias against outgroup offenders\nunder mortality salience conditions. Low empathy partici-\npants showed such bias in all conditions. In the present\nstudy, empathy was directed toward the child victims by\nhigh empathy participants, not for the offender. If anything,\nhigh empathy participants exhibited empathic anger against\nthe defendant in this case. Overall, children as victims\nappeared to prime prosocial values for high empathy partici-\npants, consistent with the findings of Jonas et al. (2008).\nHowever, the effects were moderated by social dominance\nand mortality salience experience. In effect, mortality\nsalience triggered personality differences in reactions to the\nvictims and defendant.\nIn Study 1, the wording and presentation of the empathy\nprompt and mortality salience prompt pushed for empathy\ntoward the child victims. In addition, the prompts appeared\ntoward the end of the trial descriptions and thus were among\nthe last things the participants in those conditions read before\ncompleting the dependent measures. It was not entirely clear,\ntherefore, whether the child victims would have primed proso-\ncial values in high empathy participants absent those specific\nprompts. We also were concerned that the results involving\ntrait empathy, social dominance, and mortality salience might\nbe due in part to the specific wording and placement of the\nprompts because most of the participants self-reporting mor-\ntality salience (73.74%) were in one of the prompt conditions.\nTherefore, we designed Study 2 to investigate whether mortal-\nity salience, empathy, and social dominance would affect per-\nceptions of a hit and run case in similar patterns if the prompts\nappeared earlier and were in favor of the defendant, rather than\non behalf of the victims.\nStudy 2 Method\nParticipants\nAt total of 159 adults completed an online study, 75 female\nidentifying as another racial group or multiracial. The mean\nParticipants were solicited via mturk.\nMaterials and Procedure\nThe same design and materials from Study 1 were used.\nHowever, there were only two levels of defendant racial\nidentity, Hispanic or White. Moreover, the three experimen-\ntal conditions involved versions of the defense attorney's\nsummation, rather than the prosecution. The defense ended\nthe closing statement with a request that the jury think about\nFigure 3. Mean composite scores by personal empathy level\nand social dominance among participants experiencing mortality\nsalience in Study 1. Higher scores indicate harsher judgments of\nthe defendant. A significant interaction between the personality\nvariables was present for participants who reported mortality\nFigure 4. Mean composite scores by personal empathy level\nand social dominance among participants who did not report\nexperiencing mortality salience in Study 1. There were no\ndifferences in judgments of the defendant by personality for\nparticipants not experiencing mortality salience.\nCrawley and Suarez 9\nthe fact that they themselves make mistakes as drivers\n(empathy condition), that they themselves make mistakes as\ndrivers and possibly could even be killed in an accident while\ndriving (mortality salience condition), or no such request\nwas included (control condition). The additional statements\nin the defense summation were approximately equal in\nlength to the comparable statements in the prosecutor's sum-\npants had heard of the case before (see Appendix B).\nDesign\nThe study was a 3 (mortality salience, empathy, or control) \u00d7\n2 (race of defendant) factorial design, with the additional\npersonality variables of empathy and social dominance ori-\nentation. The dependent variables included ratings of guilt,\nconfidence in verdict, sentence choice, and ratings of for-\ngiveness. Sentence choice was measured in two ways. In\naddition to selecting one of the six specific sentence choices\nas in Study 1, respondents also selected a general category of\nsentence from a 3-choice item: \"no jail,\" \"a brief jail term,\"\nor \"a long jail term.\"\nStudy 2 Results\nCorrelations Among Measures\nSimilar to the results of Study 1, social dominance orientation\nwas negatively correlated with empathy scores, r(157) =\ntion, guilt ratings were related to confidence, r(157) = .35,\nparticipant age was related to empathy, social dominance ori-\nentation, guilt rating, and confidence as presented in Table 2.\nManipulation Check\nAt the end of the survey, participants were asked whether or\nnot they thought of their own possible death while completing\nthe dependent measures. The four response options were\n\"yes, thought of death a lot\"; \"yes, slightly\"; \"no, not much\";\n\"no, not at all.\" These responses were correlated with the\nexperimental mortality salience manipulation. There was no\nrelationship at all between the manipulation check responses\nThe mortality salience prompt in the defense attorney's clos-\ning statement in this study did not increase participants'likeli-\nhood of reporting a focus on their own death. Given the\napparent failure of the manipulation, we used the self-reported\nmortality salience in the analyses rather than the manipulated\nconditions.\nGender Differences\nGender differences appeared for empathy scores, t(157) =\nSD = .61); males scored higher in social dominance orienta-\nSD = 1.43). We found no significant gender differences for\nthe dependent variables (see Table 3).\nRace of the defendant. There were no main effects by the race\nof the defendant on any of the individual dependent variables\n(p = .84 for guilt, p = .65 for sentence category, p = .81 for\nconfidence, p = .57 for forgiveness).\nHypotheses\nWe again created a composite variable, consisting of the sum\nof the guilt rating, the forgiveness rating, and a rating (1-6)\nfor the severity of the specific sentence chosen, to measure\nthe harshness of judgment against the defendant. For most of\nthe following analyses, we used a MANOVA to examine the\neffects of self-reported mortality salience, defendant race,\nempathy, and social dominance orientation on the composite\nmeasure and the rating of confidence. The \"yes\" choices on\nthe self-reported responses of mortality salience were com-\nbined, as were the \"no\" choices, to produce two levels of this\nvariable. We note that the overall sample size for this study\nwas too small to reliably interpret three- or four-way\nTable 2.

Higher composite scores indicate greater harshness of\njudgment toward the defendant, p = .08.\ninteractions. Thus, the main effects and two-way interactions\nwere analyzed for the composite measure and confidence.\nH1 and H2: Mortality salience.Mortality salience was not\nrelated to the composite measure of harshness toward the\ndefendant (p = .40) or confidence (p = .28). Similarly, a sepa-\nrate analysis on the general sentence category indicated no\neffect of mortality salience (p = .56). Thus, there was no over-\nall bias shown by participants based on their experience of\nmortality salience.An analysis of the interaction between mor-\ntality salience and defendant race also indicated no significant\neffects for the composite (p = .25) or for confidence (p = .56).\nIn addition, using White participants only to examine\nsame race/other race effects, there were no racial biases by\nreported mortality salience (p = .86 for the composite\nmeasure).\nH3: Empathy and mortality salience. Participants were catego-\nrized as high in empathy (n = 73) if their scores were above\nbelow the mean. Although there was no main effect of empa-\nthy on the composite score (p = .44), there was an interaction\nbetween empathy and mortality salience, although\ndifferences in the composite score were exhibited when in a\nstate of self-reported mortality salience; such differences\nwere absent without mortality salience. For the composite,\nparticipants high in empathy were harsher on the defendant\nwhen experiencing mortality salience; those low in empathy\nwere more lenient toward the defendant in a mortality\nsalience state. See Figure 5 for the composite measure data.\nThese results are similar to those in Study 1; mortality\nsalience appeared to trigger differences in reactions to the\ndefendant by empathy. Once again, there was greater appar-\nent empathy with the child victims for high empathy partici-\npants experiencing mortality salience, leading to harsher\nperceptions of the defendant. No such personality differ-\nences appeared among participants not experiencing mortal-\nity salience.\nH4:Social dominance. Participants were categorized as high in\nsocial dominance orientation (n = 67) if their score was above\norientation (n = 92) if below the mean. There was no main\neffects of social dominance on the composite measure (p =\np = .05, 2 = .03. Participants low in social dominance were\nmore confident in their judgments (M = 4.78, SD = 1.11) than\nthose high in social dominance (M = 4.44, SD = .96).\nIn addition, there was a main effect of social dominance\norientation on choice of sentence category. Participants\nlow in social dominance were equally likely to give no jail,\na brief jail term, or a long term, whereas those high in\nsocial dominance were more likely to selected at least\n(see Figure 6).\nGeneral Discussion\nThe most strikingly findings in these studies is the relation-\nship between mortality salience and personality differences\nin reactions to the defendant. When mortality salience was\nabsent, personality differences were minimal. When mortal-\nity salience was experienced, differences by personality,\nnotably by empathy, were present. This pattern of results\nTable 3. Gender Differences in Empathy and Social Dominance Orientation Scores.\n\nEmpathy Social dominance Empathy Social dominance\nFemale\nMale\nCrawley and Suarez 11\nmakes sense in light of the theory that people deal with exis-\ntential anxiety by clinging to their values (cf. Solomon et al.,\n2004) and that those values are reflected by personality traits.\nIn some sense, people become more true to themselves when\nexperiencing mortality salience. In support of this theory,\nparticipants' values regarding care for others or empathy in\nthe present studies was evidenced most when they were\nexperiencing mortality salience.\nThere were two common results across these two studies.\nFirst, differences by empathy were more likely to be exhib-\nited when people were experiencing mortality salience,\nregardless of whether there was also a prompt to empathize\nwith the victims or the defendant (see Figure 7). Furthermore,\nthe pattern of differences by empathy level was the same\nregardless of the type of mortality salience prompt: High\nempathy participants were harsher on the defendant and the\nlow empathy participants were more lenient regardless of the\ntype of mortality salience statements included in the trial\nsummary.\nIn the case presented to participants in these two studies,\nthe injured victims were children. Results indicate that high\nempathy participants empathized with the children and their\nfamilies, especially when experiencing mortality salience.\nLow empathy participants did not show particular empathy\nwith the victims and were more lenient on the defendant\nunder mortality salience conditions. This consistency in\nresults by empathy level and mortality salience suggests sup-\nport for the position presented by Jonas et al. (2008) and the\nliterature on altruism presented by Penner et al. (2005) that\nchildren in need evoke or prime a prosocial norm in people\nfor whom benevolence is a personal value.\nEvidence for the unique position of children as victims of\ncrime is presented by Sundby (2003) in his research on capi-\ntal juries and empathy. Sundby studied jurors' perceptions of\n\"worthy\" and \"unworthy\" victims and found that jurors were\nsignificantly affected by the age of the victim. No other vic-\ntim characteristic affected jurors as much as whether or not\nthe victim was a child. Although not all jurors indicated that\nthey would judge a defendant more harshly with a child vic-\ntim, 53% of Sundby's respondents did indicate they would\nbe \"much more likely\" to select the harshest sentence, the\ndeath penalty, for defendants who had killed children. This\npattern of response indicated greater empathy with child vic-\ntims and their families than with any other type of victim\nThe second common finding was that participants high in\nsocial dominance orientation selected harsher sentences\nacross conditions. This finding is consistent with past\nresearch on social dominance orientation (cf. Pratto et al.,\n1994). Social dominance orientation is related to conserva-\ntive values, and the finding that people with a high social\ndominance orientation were more likely to select a jail sen-\ntence for the hit and run driver is consistent with a \"law and\norder\" conservative political stance.\nThe results of these studies do not support the idea that\nmortality salience may significantly contribute to differ-\nences in perceptions of cases based on defendant race\nwithin the criminal justice system, however. There were no\nsignificant findings regarding the interaction between the\nrace of the defendant and race of the participants for this\ncase and this research design. As discussed above, it is pos-\nsible that having children as the injured parties evoked\nnorms strong enough to erase other types of bias. Past\nresearch with adult defendants and adult victims has found\neffects of mortality salience on both overall and racialized\nviews of criminal defendants (cf. Arndt et al., 2005;\nIn addition, the findings of the two present studies do not\nnecessarily reveal factors that would appear among jurors in\nan actual courtroom. The lack of racial disparity in the treat-\nment of the defendant in these studies does not negate the\npossibility of racial effects by personality and mortality\nsalience within the criminal justice system. Given the design,\nwe have studied perceptions and judgments when reading\nabout a case, as if in a news report. We did not ask partici-\npants to engage in a mock trial, nor did we study\nFigure 6. Frequency of sentences with and without a jail term\nselected as a function of participants' social dominance level in\nFigure 7. Differences in mean composite scores based on\nparticipant empathy level and mortality salience experience.\nPositive scores indicate that participants high in empathy were\nharsher on the defendant than those low in empathy. Significant\ndifferences by personality were found under mortality salience\nconditions, but not for those absent mortality salience.\ndecision-making processes by police, attorneys, judges, and\njuries in cases carrying real consequences.\nThe findings of this research do inform an understanding\nof public perceptions of criminal cases, however. When\ncases appear in electronic or print media, people react as to\nthe perceived fairness of trial outcomes. In turn, perceptions\nof the criminal justice system are affected by such percep-\ntions. Based on our research, more conservative members of\nthe public who are high in social dominance orientation are\nlikely to expect harsher sentences and may therefore be criti-\ncal of leniency by judges. Similarly, people high in empathy\nmay expect harsher treatment of defendants in cases that\nprompt victim empathy for them.\nLimitations\nBased on the discussion above, the general limitations of\nthese two studies include the following. First, participants\nread about cases via a written summary presented online;\nthey did not participate in any deliberations or view a live-\naction trial. The victims in the case were children, which\nmay evoke a different pattern of normative reactions from\nparticipants than evoked by adult victims. In addition, the\ncase involved an ambiguous unintentional criminal inci-\ndent. Judgments about cases with offenders who engaged\nin intentional crimes, violent or nonviolent, may be quite\ndifferent.\nThere are also limitations due to the nature of the samples.\nUsing both a college participant pool and mturk increased\nthe diversity of the sample in term of age and racial identity.\nHowever, the sample is still not representative of adults in\nthe United States who might serve on juries or who might\nread about criminal cases in a news source. For example, the\npresent samples were younger in age (median = 29) than the\ngeneral population in the United States (median = 37.70;\nU.S. Census Bureau, 2015a). Furthermore, the samples\nunderrepresent the percentage of Hispanic (17.40%) and\nBlack or African American (13.20%) individuals, and over-\nrepresent Asians (5.40%) in the United States (U.S. Census\nBureau, 2015b). Finally, the samples are not random; the stu-\ndents and adults on mturk are self-selected; their views may\ndiffer from the general adult population. Therefore, further\nresearch is needed to determine whether the current findings\ngeneralize.\nAppendix A\nDesign Summary and Dependent Measures for Study 1\nExperimental conditions randomly assigned:\n1.
