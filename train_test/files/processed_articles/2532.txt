Verbal serial recall is improved when the\ninformation is arranged in a familiar spatially distributed pattern, such as a telephone keypad. This pattern, termed\nvisuospatial bootstrapping, is consistent with the existence within working memory of an episodic buffer (Baddeley, 2000).\nThe present experiment aimed to investigate whether similar results would be obtained in a sample of older adults. Older\n(55\u00ad76) and younger (19\u00ad35) adults carried out visual serial recall in 3 visual display conditions that have previously been\nused to demonstrate visuospatial bootstrapping. Results demonstrated better performance when digits were presented in a\ntypical telephone keypad display. Although digit serial recall declined with age, there was no evidence that this visuospatial\nbootstrapping effect differed in size between older and younger adults. Theoretical and practical implications of these\nresults are described.\nKeywords: working memory, binding, aging, episodic buffer, visuospatial bootstrapping\nThis article was published June 9, 2015.

These include\nso-called \"slave systems,\" broadly passive stores that maintain infor-\nmation over short periods. Other processes can manipulate informa-\ntion held in the slave systems; many such processes are considered\npart of a central executive, a limited set of control resources that are\nrecruited for tasks such as planning, sequencing, and inhibition (Bad-\nThere is good evidence of a clear distinction between verbal and\nvisuospatial temporary memory systems (Smith, Jonides, & Koeppe,\nDespite this, memory often needs to maintain links between attributes\nthat fall into supposedly separate domains; for example, in tasks\nwhere participants must remember the location and content of a verbal\nstimulus (e.g., Prabhakaran, Narayanan, Zhao, & Gabrieli, 2000). To\naccommodate this, Baddeley (2000) proposed a further component of\nworking memory, the episodic buffer. This limited capacity store is\nassumed to be recruited when domain specific information, such as\nthat held in working memory slave systems and in long-term memory\n(LTM), has to be linked together and the link needs to be temporarily\nretained; for example, remembering what item went where, or remem-\nbering that a word was presented in red ink.\nRepresentations composed of conjunctions of visual stimulus ele-\nments are evidently formed and retained in memory (e.g., Allen,\nBaddeley, & Hitch, 2010). Binding of this type can proceed automat-\nically without the intervention of executive attentional processes\n(Allen, Baddeley, & Hitch, 2014; Allen, Hitch, Mate, & Baddeley,\n2012), leading to the conclusion that binding processes in the episodic\nbuffer can operate broadly independently of the central executive\n(Baddeley et al., 2011). Such patterns of binding are not limited to\nattributes that broadly share the same perceptual domain: There is\nevidence of binding between materials in verbal and visuospatial\nthat information stored in different modalities can interact or compete\nBinding between verbal and visuospatial working memory has been\nobserved repeatedly in a series of studies using a task that avoids\nexplicitly asking participants to \"bind\" information at all, hence\ndemonstrating implicit cross-modality feature binding, an effect\ntermed visuospatial bootstrapping (Darling & Havelka, 2010; Dar-\nling, Allen, Havelka, Campbell, & Rattray, 2012; Darling, Parker,\nGoodall, Havelka, & Allen, 2014; Allen, Havelka, Falcon, Evans, &\nDarling, 2014). In this task, information presented visually for verbal\nserial recall is recalled better when the visual display is arranged in a\nfamiliar spatially distributed pattern, a telephone keypad, than when\nto-be-remembered numbers are presented one after another in a single\nlocation. For such patterns to be observed, memory performance must\nhave been improved (i.e., bootstrapped) by the integration of visu-\nospatial information when it was available in the display. This obser-\nvation was assumed (Darling & Havelka, 2010) to reflect the retention\nof bindings of visuospatial information (locations), and verbal infor-\nmation (digits), facilitating performance. Visuospatial bootstrapping\nis consistent with the episodic buffer addition to the working memory\nmodel described previously.\nProcesses underlying visuospatial bootstrapping require the exis-\ntence of a familiar representation in LTM because only well-known\ndisplays (phone keypads) elicit the effect, whereas unfamiliar displays\npattern exists when spatial material is to be remembered: long-term\nspatial memory influences working memory for spatial configurations\n(Brown & Wesley, 2013). Taken together, it seems that that arrays in\nLTM can facilitate more effective recall in working memory. How-\never, the visuospatial bootstrapping pattern also requires the operation\nof visuospatial working memory components: It is completely atten-\nuated under a random tapping task assumed to load visuospatial\nworking memory whereas it is slightly exaggerated under verbal\nworking memory load (Allen et al., 2014).\nVisuospatial bootstrapping appears to develop along a characteris-\ntic trajectory (Darling et al., 2014): Although a clear bootstrapping\neffect is observed in adults and 9-year-olds, there is no evidence of a\nsimilar effect at 6 years of age. Based on this, visuospatial bootstrap-\nping seems to attain a magnitude comparable to that of adults between\nages of 6 and 9. This apparent maturation of bootstrapping precedes\nthe maturation of memory capacity in both visual and verbal domains\nwhich continues to increase through adolescence (Siegel, 1994), a\ntype of pattern that suggests the involvement of different cognitive\nAlthough the pattern of visuospatial bootstrapping in young adults\nand children has been investigated, it is unclear what the effects of\naging on visuospatial bootstrapping might be. The current research is\nspecifically targeted at investigating the visuospatial bootstrapping\neffect in typically aging older adults. Hence, we report an assessment\nof visuospatial bootstrapping that was carried out in a sample of\nyounger and older adults.\nWorking Memory in Aging\nNormal aging is associated with a decline in several cognitive\nfunctions (Manan, Franz, Yusoff, & Mukari, 2013) including working\nmemory, auditory processing, (Anderson, Parbery-Clark, Yi, &\n(Smith et al., 2001) and LTM (Park, Lautenschlager, Hedden, David-\nson, Smith, & Smith, 2002). Many researchers consider working\nmemory to be a key factor in age-related cognitive decline (Borella,\nCarretti, & De Beni, 2008), as it has been repeatedly observed that\nworking memory declines with aging (Jost, Bryck, Vogel, & Mayr,\na review, see Rajah & D'Esposito, 2005).\nWorking memory decline might explain the difficulties faced by\nolder adults in a wide variety of tests of fluid cognition (Baddeley,\ncontrast to a minimal decline in crystallized intelligence performance\n(Schaie, 2005). Visual working memory is more strongly correlated\nwith general fluid intelligence, whereas verbal working memory is\nmore strongly associated with crystallized intelligence (Bergman &\nConway, Cowan, Bunting, Therriault, & Minkoff, 2002; Verguts &\nDe Boeck, 2001), possibly reflecting increased executive demands of\ncommon visuospatial working memory tasks (e.g., Vandierendonck,\nKemps, Fastame, & Szmalec, 2004). In line with this, research has\ndemonstrated that visuospatial working memory is particularly age-\nsensitive, compared to the verbal component of working memory (Bo,\nMyerson, Joerding, & Hale, 2000; Jenkins, Myerson, Hale, & Fry,\nBopp & Verhaeghen, 2007). Thus, separable subcomponents may\nhave different age-related trajectories (Dang et al., 2012). It should be\nnoted, however, that findings are somewhat mixed on this point, with\nsome studies reporting older adults' superior performance in the\nvisual-spatial domain than in the verbal (Fastenau, Denburg, & Abe-\nThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\nences in age-related decline between visuospatial and verbal memory\nacross the life span (e.g., Borella, Ghisletta, & de Ribaupierre, 2011;\nNevertheless, if visuospatial working memory is indeed subject to\ndecline in typical aging we might expect to see an attenuation of the\nvisuospatial bootstrapping effect in older adults, in reflection of the\nimportant role of visuospatial processing in visuospatial bootstrapping\nIn addition to declines in verbal and visuospatial working memory,\nit has been suggested that memory for the bindings between elements\nin memory may be particularly impaired with healthy aging. For\nexample, studies have shown that older adults are less accurate on\ntests of shape-location binding, relative to memory for the individual\nelements (Borg, Leroy, Favre, Laurent, & Thomas-Anterion, 2011;\nChalfonte & Johnson, 1996; Mitchell, Johnson, Raye, & D'Esposito,\ncific to tasks requiring binding to location, as other forms of binding\n(e.g., between shape and color) do not consistently produce age-\nrelated declines (see Allen, Brown, & Niven, 2013, for a review). As\nvisuospatial bootstrapping may be based on binding between digit and\nlocation, we might therefore expect to see the bootstrapping effect\nreduced or abolished with age.\nAge-related decline has been observed to be more impactful in\ncomplex (storage and processing) compared to simple (storage only)\nspan tasks (Mammarella, Borella, Pastore, & Pazzaglia, 2013), and in\nthose that require a high level of executive control, independently of\ntype of material presented (De Ribaupierre & Lecerf, 2006; De\nhas not been universally observed: using carefully matched stimuli,\nHale et al. (2011) observed that the rate of age-related performance\ndecline was the same for both simple and complex tasks within the\nrespective verbal and visuospatial domains, though decline in the\nvisuospatial domain was greater than in the verbal.\nOne possible reason for such patterns may relate to the HAROLD\nmodel of cerebral aging (Cabeza, 2001; Cabeza, Anderson, Locantore,\n& McIntosh, 2002), which argues for a more bilateral recruitment of\nthe prefrontal cortex in older age. In typical young adults, brain\nactivation is predominantly left lateralized for verbal and right later-\nalized for visuospatial working memory, whereas older adults show\nmore bilateral activation patterns for both types of memory (Reuter-\nLorenz, Jonides, Smith, Hartley, Miller, Marshuetz, & Koeppe, 2000).\nThe implications of this for bootstrapping are unclear; however, one\npossible interpretation is that the specialized visuospatial systems\nassociated with strong cerebral lateralization might also decline with\nage leading to decreased bootstrapping. Alternatively, as specialized\nverbal memory systems become less effective, older adults may gain\na greater relative benefit of bootstrapping--in much the same way that\nparticipants carrying out articulatory suppression tasks showed greater\nbootstrapping (Allen et al., 2014) in which case bootstrapping would\nincrease with age.\nAnother relevant perspective is the scaffolding theory of aging and\ncognition (STAC: Park & Reuter-Lorenz, 2009). This suggests that\none of the outcomes of an adaptive brain that engages in compensa-\ntory scaffolding in response to the challenges posed by declining\nneural structures and function is the increase of frontal activation with\nage. According to the authors, STAC is a process that involves use\nand development of complementary and alternative neural circuits to\nachieve a cognitive goal and it is present across the life span. As\nbootstrapping is by definition an alternate route toward achieving a\ngoal, then it would seem logical to suggest that the STAC framework\nwould predict the persistence of bootstrapping into old age.\nTo address these contrasting predictions, the current study was\ndesigned to investigate visuospatial bootstrapping in an older adult\nsample. As in previous work, a single-digit condition was contrasted\nwith a typical keypad condition and a random keypad condition, with\nthe latter condition included to estimate the degree to which a familiar\nrepresentation of a particular spatial array is necessary for the obser-\nvation of visuospatial bootstrapping-based facilitation.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA total of 110 participants entered into this study. Samples of 55\nadults were recruited from students and staff of the Hospital and\nUniversity of Bari and wider Bari community, whereas older partic-\nipants were recruited from cultural associations in Bari (Italy).\nEach participant was assessed with a brief neuropsychological\nbattery of tests and a visuospatial bootstrapping task (described be-\nlow). This battery measured cognitive function with the Mini Mental\nStatus examination (MMSE: Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975),\nintellectual capacity with Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices\n(RCPM: Raven, Raven, & Court, 1993), verbal memory span with\nDigit Span forward & backward test (Wechsler, 1997), visual memory\nspan with the Visual Patterns Test (VPT: Della Sala, Gray, Baddeley,\n& Wilson, 1997) and spatial memory span with the Corsi Block\nTapping Test (Spinnler & Tognoni, 1987). These tasks were used to\ncheck that participants were aging in a typical (rather than atypical)\npattern.\nParticipants were given a brief interview to exclude those with\nserious health problems or those on medication that can cause drows-\niness or affect cognitive functioning. All participants were asked to\nprovide informed consent for research participation. This project\nreceived approval from the Research Ethics Committee at Queen\nMargaret University.\nDesign\nParticipants were tested at their own span, assessed in a pretest.\nDisplay type (single digit [SD], typical keypad [TKP], and random\nkeypad [RKP]) was a within-subjects factor manipulated in blocks\nand age group was between-subjects factor. There were 30 trials in\neach block. The dependent variable was the number of completely\ncorrectly recalled sequences (out of a total of 30).\nMaterials and Procedure\nFigure 1 shows the displays used in the three display conditions. A\nlaptop PC with a 15-in display was used to present the stimuli, which\nwere compiled using e-Prime 2 (Psychology Software Tools, 2013).\nIn each trial of every display condition participants tried to remem-\nber a random sequence of digits (no digit was repeated in a sequence).\nThe sequence length was set at the single-item capacity measured in\nthe pretest.

In the TKP condition, the digits 0\u00ad9 were pre-\nsented in the same array used in a traditional telephone keypad,\naligned centrally on the screen (see Figure 1) and within outline boxes\nof similar dimensions to the box described in the SD condition above.\nThere was a horizontal and vertical spacing of 20 px between the 120\npx outlines surrounding each digit. The sequences were indicated by\nsuccessively highlighting the background of the digits in the to-be-\nremembered sequence, in green, for 1,000 ms, at which point the\nbackground reverted to clear. Between items, the entire array was\nRKP. The RKP keyboard condition was similar to the TKP\ncondition, except that the locations of the digits were randomized and\nhence unfamiliar to participants--they did not appear in their typical\nlocations. Following the first trial, however, digit locations remained\nconsistent throughout remaining trials in this condition.\nPretest. Prior to the three experimental conditions, participants\ntook part in a pretest to ascertain their baseline span. The SD display\n(described above) was used for this pretest. Participants were asked to\ncarry out two trials at a given sequence length, beginning with just one\nitem. If they remembered at least one trial, they would then progress\nto the next sequence length. However, if they failed to recall either\nsequence the procedure stopped. Span was then determined to be the\nmaximum sequence length at which participants recalled at least one\nsequence correctly.\nResults\nTwo participants did not complete the full test session, and hence\ntheir data is excluded from all reporting. With regard to overall\nmemory capacity in the single-item span pretest, mean span was 4.76\nitems (SD  1.16, min  3, max  8) for the group of older adults,\nwhereas it was significantly higher for the younger adult participants\n 1.02, p  .001.

Neither a significant main effect of display,\nwas also not significant.\nDiscussion\nThe present study is the first to demonstrate visuospatial bootstrap-\nping in a sample of older adults, and the principal conclusion is that\nboth older and younger adults displayed a visuospatial bootstrapping\neffect. Older and younger adults also did not differ significantly in\nterms of the size of the bootstrapping benefit obtained by presenting\ndigits in a familiar keypad array. In addition, when simple main\neffects of display were assessed independently for each age group,\nthere was a significant benefit for typical keypads in both groups.\nHence we can conclude that visuospatial bootstrapping in visually\npresented immediate serial recall of digits is indeed a phenomenon\nthat persists across the course of typical aging.\nThis is both the first time that bootstrapping has been observed in\nan older adult sample and also the first time that it has been observed\nin a non-English speaking sample (Italian), thus it is noteworthy that\nin the younger adult condition the pattern of bootstrapping replicates\nexactly that seen on several occasions in groups of English-speaking\nmances on the neuropsychological battery were in no way atypical.\nConsequently we have no grounds to suspect limits on the generaliz-\nability of these findings, at least to samples that would be expected to\nbe familiar with numeric keypads.\nPerformance in both age groups was significantly better in the\n(familiar) TKP condition compared to the SD condition, whereas\nunfamiliar (RKP) keypads offered no benefit to performance. Hence\nit is clear that the visuospatial bootstrapping effect requires the avail-\nability of a familiar visuospatial representation in LTM, an observa-\ntion that is entirely consistent with previous results in younger adults\nand older children (Darling et al., 2014).\nTaking into account the evidence from previous studies (Darling et\nseems to develop around 9 years of age and remains relatively stable\nacross the life span, into old age. This pattern is in contrast with other\nchanges that occur with the progression of age. For example, there is\nclear evidence of declines in several cognitive functions and particu-\net al., 2003), including visuospatial working memory (Thomas et al.,\nsuggested that identity-location binding in working memory is subject\nto particular age-related declines (see Allen et al., 2013). In contrast,\nvisuospatial bootstrapping appears to be relatively robust to cognitive\ndecline.\nAlthough there was no significant interaction between age and\ndisplay type, it would be incorrect to assume equivalence between the\nmagnitude of bootstrapping in older and younger participants. There\nare two reasons for this: the pattern of means appears to suggest that\nthe benefit of TKP displays was slightly greater for younger partici-\npants and, in addition, asserting the absence of an effect statistically is\ndifficult. However, it is to be noted that this study was powered to\ndetect small to medium effects (minimum p\n.95), and yet no significant interaction was observed, so it is likely that\nany unobserved effect would at most be relatively small.\nConsequently, although full equivalence of bootstrapping in the two\ncohorts was not demonstrated beyond doubt, it is appropriate to claim\nthat we have found no evidence that bootstrapping changes over\nnormal aging. Therefore we assert that visuospatial bootstrapping is\nrelatively robust to aging, and certainly that it is preserved to some\nextent in aging, with the caveat that further research is merited to\nestablish whether effect sizes in older and younger adults are equal.\nIt is important to note that these effects are observed in a paradigm\nwhereby difficulty is set on a per-individual basis and therefore that\nthe underlying visuospatial and verbal memory systems may not be so\nrobust to age. Indeed, the significant difference in performance be-\ntween age groups on the pretest span assessment and on the VPT and\nCorsi blocks tasks indicate declines in both visuospatial and verbal\nworking memory capacity with age. Fluid cognition (e.g., logical\nproblem solving; Horn & Cattell, 1967), declines over the course of\nWithin this context it is possible that visuospatial bootstrapping\nreflects an important contribution from visuospatial long-term knowl-\nedge that can sustain the function of an otherwise declining visuospa-\ntial working memory, though it is now clear that LTM is necessary,\nbut not sufficient, to produce visuospatial bootstrapping (Allen et al.,\n2014). Overall, the present study suggests that although both verbal\nand visuospatial working memory did decline with age, the necessary\nworking memory resources were still available to support visuospatial\nbootstrapping. Given that visuospatial bootstrapping seems reason-\nably robust against aging, this makes it a potentially fruitful candidate\nfor further research into interventions that may assist individuals with\nage-related memory difficulties. It may also indicate that the form of\nimplicit identity-location binding possibly underlying the visuospatial\nbootstrapping effect differs from those tapped by explicit tests of\nbinding that have previously shown age-related decline (e.g., Mitchell\nCurrent theories aimed at addressing the cognitive difficulties faced\npredict that visuospatial bootstrapping would decline over age (though\nsome theories are hard to specify clear predictions from, e.g., Cabeza,\ntent with this. A full understanding of this will require future research,\nbut it is possible that visuospatial bootstrapping can exploit compen-\nsatory mechanisms through a plastic reorganization of neurocognitive\nnetworks as described by Cabeza et al. (2002) in their HAROLD\nmodel and by Park and Reuter-Lorenz (2009) in their STAC frame-\nwork. The STAC framework considers the engagement of scaffolding\nan adaptive neural response that is used in the face of cognitive\nchallenge throughout the life span, rather than a process specific to old\nage. The observation of visuospatial bootstrapping in young adults\nunder certain types of cognitive load (Allen et al., 2014) may also\nrepresent a manifestation of scaffolding under cognitive challenge.\nHowever, it is also possible that visuospatial bootstrapping reflects a\ncognitive component such as the episodic buffer (Baddeley et al.,\n2011) that is itself fairly resistant to aging.\nAs in any study of typical aging, it is unclear to what extent patterns\nobserved in this study can inform our understanding of age-related\nAccuracy Across Age Groups and Display Type (Standard Error in\nParentheses)\nNote.

Future research might focus on un-\nderstanding the mechanisms involved in the transition from normal to\npathological aging. This would have the potential to provide a theo-\nretical basis for developing techniques to support older people in\nremaining independent for longer and inform best practices when\nworking with such populations. Moreover, the use of spatially dis-\ntributed displays to facilitate learning and memory of complex infor-\nmation has a range of potentially useful applications especially in an\naging society with the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases on the\nrise (Hort et al., 2010).
