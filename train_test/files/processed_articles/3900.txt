    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: This study investigated the relationship between potential prognostic parameters that\nmay be associated with increased inflammation and survival in patients with malignant mesotheli-\noma (MM).\nMethods: This retrospective study assessed potential prognostic parameters measured at the\ntime of MM diagnosis. Data on asbestos exposure, histopathological subtype of MM and laboratory\nparameters were collected.\nResults: In 155 patients with MM (90 male), mean survival time was 13.9 months. In univariate\nanalysis, age !60 years and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) !3 were associated with\nsignificantly shortened median survival times. In multivariate analysis, nonepithelial subtype, red cell\ndistribution width (RDW) !20% and NLR !3 were associated with significantly shortened median\nNLR !3 and nonepithelial subtype, respectively. Nonepithelial subtype, white blood cell count !11\n200 ml and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio !300 at baseline were associated with a heightened NLR\nvalue.\nConclusions: The NLR and RDW were significant predictive factors for MM prognosis.\n",

For example,\nin one cohort of 30 patients with MM, NLR\n!5 was associated with poor MM progno-\nsis.20 In contrast, in 44 patients with MM\ntreated with surgical procedures, NLR !5\nwas not found to be associated with MM\nOther potentially prognostic inflamma-\ntory markers are red cell distribution width\n(RDW) and mean platelet volume (MPV).\nRDW is a measure of the variability in the\nsize of circulating erythrocytes,22 and is\nroutinely reported with complete blood\ncount. Studies have suggested that RDW is\nincreased in patients with cardiovascular\nand pulmonary diseases, with inflammation\nplaying a key role.23\u00ad25 MPV reflects platelet\nsize, which is correlated with platelet func-\ntion and activation: elevated MPV predicts\nhigh platelet activity and intensity of inflam-\nmation.26 MPV values have been investi-\ngated in chronic inflammatory diseases, and\nincreased values have been associated with\nconditions such as familial Mediterranean\nfever.27,28 To our knowledge, no previous\nstudy has investigated the relationships\nbetween RDW or MPV and prognosis, in\npatients with MM.\nThe aim of the present study was to\ninvestigate the relationship between poten-\ntial prognostic indicators (including NLR,\nPLR, MPV, RDW and other variables) and\nsurvival, in patients with MM.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis was a retrospective study conducted\n2012, using data obtained prior to treat-\nment and held in patients' files. Local\nethical approval was obtained from\nthe Dicle University Medical Faculty\nEthics Committee for Noninterventional\nStudies.\nPatients\nEligible patients had MM that was diag-\npathologically. Pathological diagnosis was\nobtained on biopsies, in line with recent\ninternational guidelines.29 Asbestos expos-\nure type and time, location of MM, histo-\npathological subtype of MM and basic\nlaboratory parameters were obtained from\npatients' files held at the Research Hospital\nat Dicle University. Patients (or their next of\nkin) provided written informed consent for\nthe data to be published.\nPotential prognostic parameters\nDetails on the following potential prognos-\ntic parameters, measured at the time of\ndiagnosis, were obtained from patients'\nlogical subtype of MM (epithelial or none-\npithelial); haemoglobin level <10 g/l or\nserum using heparin and citrate and an\nLaboratories, Irving, TX, USA). LDH\nlevel was measured in tubes with K2 ethy-\nlenediaminetetra-acetic acid. Haemogram\nparameters (including WBC, haemoglobin,\nplatelet count, neutrophil and lymphocyte\ncounts) were measured using Cell-Dyn\nAssays were performed within 1 h of\ncollection, after centrifugation of the\nroom temperature).The NLR was deter-\nmined by dividing the absolute neutrophil\ncount by the absolute lymphocyte count. An\nNLR !3 was defined as a potential prog-\nnostic parameter, as described previ-\nperformed to derive the PLR, with !300\nbeing the cut-off level for positivity, in\naccordance with other literature.18 MPV\nand RDW were calculated within the com-\nconsidered as a potential prognostic param-\neter, as described previously.24 It was not\npossible to identify any publications on the\nprognosis of MM in relation to MPV, but\nthe median MPV value was 7.81 fl.\nConsequently, we considered MPV !8 fl as\na potential prognostic parameter.\nAssessment of the value of potential\nprognostic parameters\nUnivariate and multivariate analyses were\nused to investigate the relationship between\nMM prognosis and the following 11 poten-\ntial factors: age; sex; histopathological sub-\ntype; platelet count; WBC count; serum\nLDH level; NLR; PLR; MPV; haemoglobin\nlevel; RDW.\nStatistical analyses\nThe mean \u00c6 SD values were obtained for\ncontinuous variables and 2-test was used to\nexamine categorical variables. Duration of\nsurvival and median and mean event times,\nwith 95% confidence intervals (CI), were\nestimated according to the Kaplan\u00adMeier\nmethod. Median values were used in our\ndefinition of the cut-off limits. Duration of\nsurvival was defined as the period between\ntime of diagnosis and time of death. If\npatients were still alive, survival was defined\nas the period between time of diagnosis and\nCox proportional hazards regression\nmodel, with stratification for the clinical\ntrial, was used for both the univariate and\nmultivariate analyses. The univariate ana-\nlysis examined the prognostic importance of\nall the aforementioned factors and the\nmodel was used to examine the variables.\nA two-sided test was used, with a 0.05 level\nof significance. Comparisons of overall sur-\nvival were made using two-tailed log-rank\ntests. Only variables with P-values <0.10 in\nthe univariate analysis were included in the\nfinal model for the multivariate analysis.\nIn the Cox regression analysis, the back-\nward conditional method was used.\nSignificance was taken as P < 0.05.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5, version 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nResults\nPatients\nInformation on basic laboratory parameters\nwas available for 198 patients with MM. Of\nthese, 36 patients were excluded from the\nstudy due to lack of sufficient data, and a\nfurther seven patients were excluded due to\nthe presence of active infection and other\ncomorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmon-\nary disease, lung cancer, interstitial lung\ndisease, pneumoconiosis).

In the present univariate\nanalysis there was a significant association\nbetween age >60 years and poor prognosis\nfor MM. The patient cohort in the present\nstudy was stratified at 60 years, given the low\nmean age of our study group (58 years) and\nthe short survival duration; few of our\npatients reached 75 years of age, despite\nthis being considered as the threshold for\npoor prognosis in the international\nInexpensive and easily detected prognos-\ntic parameters have not yet been developed\nfor MM. Therefore, the present retrospect-\nive study investigated the relationship\nbetween potential prognostic indicators\nand survival in 155 patients with MM.\nIn countries where people are exposed to\nasbestos through industrial practices, rates\nof MM are generally higher in men than in\nwomen. This is because men are more likely\nto work for longer time periods in such\nindustries and are therefore more likely to\nhave higher lifetime asbestos exposure rates.\nHowever, in our region, asbestos exposure is\nmostly environmental and begins at birth; it\naffects both sexes almost equally, because it\nis processed with water and people are\nFigure 2.

Some studies in our region have\nfound male : female ratios of MM as\nIn our region MM is probably detected at\nlower ages than those observed elsewhere as\na consequence of the high rate of environ-\nmental exposure described above. In one\nstudy performed in our region, the mean age\nof patients was 56 years.30 The mean age of\nMM patients in our study is also relatively\nlow, probably as a result of the regional\nenvironmental asbestos exposure.\nThe mean survival time was 13.9 months.\nOf 11 potential prognostic factors assessed,\nthe inflammatory markers NLR !3 and\nRDW !20% (in addition to the nonepithe-\nlial subtype), were effective indicators of\nMM prognosis in the multivariate analysis.\nOther markers (such as age, sex, LDH level,\nplatelet count and WBC count) were not\nfound to be prognostic indicators of MM.\nStudies have reported that the rate of\npatients with MM with NLR !3 versus\n<3, and that this difference was statistically\nsignificant.17,19 Unal et al. found that pre-\ntreatment NLR measurements provided\nimportant prognostic results in patients\nwith nonsmall cell lung cancer.31 In other\nstudies, the rate of mortality in patients with\nNLR !5 versus <5; this difference was\nalso statistically significant.16,18 Cedre\n\u00b4 s\net al.20 found that NLR !5 was an inde-\npendent prognostic factor in patients with\nMM. In the present study, the rate of\nmortality increased 1.67-fold in patients\nwith MM who had an NLR of !3 compared\nwith NLR <3; mean duration of survival\nwas 10.5 months in those with an NLR ! 3\nand 14.9 months in those with an NLR <3.\nThe NLR may, therefore, be viewed as an\ninexpensive predictor of MM prognosis at\nthe time of diagnosis, and we postulate that\nthe NLR level could be a factor to use as\npart of the decision making process, when\nconsidering aggressive or palliative treat-\nment regimens for patients with MM. It is\nreasonable to assume that patients with MM\nwith more advanced disease at the time of\ndiagnosis may have a more excessive sys-\ntemic inflammatory response and, therefore,\na higher NLR.\nThe histological subtype is well estab-\nlished in predicting prognosis in MM and\nmany studies have found that the none-\npithelial histological subtype is associated\nate analysis in the present study also con-\nfirmed this finding: the mortality rate\nincreased 1.52-fold in patients with a none-\npithelial subtype of MM.\nIn complete blood count data, the RDW\nhas been found to be increased in several\nFigure 3.

This result may be due to the\nassociation between RDW and increased\ninflammation, and to chronic inflammation\nTable 2.

Where possible,\nhowever, we had applied other recommen-\ndations of the REMARK initiative.\nIn conclusion, the pathological role of\nchronic inflammation in the development of\nMM is well established.13 Based on our\nresults, inflammatory-based biomarkers\nmay be predictive of survival. NLR, as an\nindex of systemic inflammation, may be\nindependently associated with survival in\npatients with MM. Both the NLR and the\nRDW may be useful prognostic markers:\nthey are easily obtainable and were signifi-\ncant predictive factors for MM prognosis.\nThe inexpensive nature and reproducibility\nof the complete blood count, which includes\nboth NLR and RDW, should encourage\ntheir use in the clinical management of\npatients with MM. Both parameters may\nhelp in making the decision between aggres-\nsive or palliative treatment regimens.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
