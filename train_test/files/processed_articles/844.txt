    "reduced_content": "With Various Sources on Depressive Symptoms\ninYounger and Older Adults\n \n \nAddressing a previous gap in the gerontological literature, the present study examined the effects of both positive and nega-\ntive social exchanges within key relationships (spouse, children, and other relatives/friends) on the depressive symptoms of\nyounger (28 to 59 years old) and older (60 to 92 years old) men and women. Separate analyses were carried out on younger\nadults (N = 452) and older adults (N = 849) who were respondents in the Americans' Changing Lives study. In both age\ngroups, positive and negative social exchanges with the same source were significantly (p < .001), inversely related (rs\nrangefrom -.23 to -.43); and positive social exchanges exerted stronger net effects on depressive symptoms than negative\nsocial exchanges. For older adults, some buffering effects werefound when negative andpositive social exchanges were as-\nsociated with different sources; for younger adults, buffering effects were found when negative and positive social ex-\nchanges were associated with the same source. These buffering effects were not conditioned by gender. The findings of the\npresent study highlight the importance of taking into account the age of the recipient and the provider-recipient relation-\nship when studying thejoint influence of negative andpositive social exchanges on adults'depressive symptoms.\nSINCE Rook (1984) demonstrated that social relationships\ncan adversely influence the psychological well-being of\nolder adults, several investigators have examined the effects of\nboth positive and negative social ties in later life (e.g., Finch,\nOkun, Barrera, Zautra, & Reich, 1989; Fiore, Becker, &\nand positive social exchanges are unrelated to each other, and\n(b) the detrimental effects of negative social exchanges are\nmore potent than the beneficial effects of positive social ex-\nchanges. Krause (1995) called for additional research on this\ntopic because he postulated that elderly people were especially\nlikely to be adversely affected by negative social interaction.\nPrevious gerontological research on the effects of both pos-\nitive and negative social exchanges has suffered from several\nlimitations. First, these studies have tended to focus\non older adults facing major stressors and have used small,\nnonrepresentative samples (Okun, Melichar, & Hill, 1990;\nStephens, Kinney, Norris, & Ritchie, 1987). In the present\nstudy, we analyzed data collected from a national probability\nsample. Second, the effects of various sources of positive and\nnegative social exchanges on depressive symptoms were not\naddressed in these studies. There is a growing consensus in\nthe literature on social ties and depression that it is important\nto consider characteristics of the provider (Barrera, Chassin,\nwe were able to take into account three different sources of\nsupport (spouse, children, and other relatives/friends).\nThird, few gerontological studies of the effects of both pos-\nitive and negative social exchanges have investigated the pos-\nsibility that these variables exert joint effects on depressive\nMoreover, gerontological studies investigating interaction ef-\nfects have not distinguished among the various sources of\nsupport. In the present study, we were able to test for interac-\ntion effects between positive and negative social exchanges\nwhen the source was the same (e.g., positive and negative so-\ncial exchanges with spouse) and when the sources were dif-\nferent (e.g., positive social exchanges with spouse and nega-\ntive social exchanges with children). Fourth, gerontological\nstudies of both positive and negative social exchanges have\nnot explored whether the effects of these variables are condi-\ntioned by gender and age. Because adults' social networks\nhave been shown to vary by gender (Antonucci & Akiyama,\npresent study we investigated gender differences in the joint\neffects of positive and negative social exchanges and disag-\ngregated our analyses by age.\nThe purpose of the present study was to address four re-\nsearch questions: (1) What is the relation between positive and\nnegative exchanges for each source among younger and older\nadults? (2) What are the relative contributions of positive and\nnegative social exchanges to predicting depressive symptoms\namong younger and older adults? (3) Do positive social ex-\nchanges buffer the effects of negative social exchanges among\nyounger and older adults? and (4) Does gender moderate the\njoint effects of positive and negative social exchanges on the\ndepressive symptoms of younger and older adults?\nOur literature review is divided into five sections. In the first\nsection, we define social support and negative social exchanges.\nSecond, we summarize the relation between positive and nega-\ntive social exchanges. Third, we review studies that have investi-\ngated the additive effects of positive and negative social ex-\nchanges on depressive symptoms. In the fourth section, research\non interaction effects between positive and negative social ex-\nchanges is considered. Finally, we discuss how gender may in-\nfluence the joint effects of positive and negative social ex-\nchanges with various sources on depressive symptoms.\nDefinitions of Positive and Negative Social Exchanges\nOver the past two decades, researchers have found it useful\nto distinguish among three aspects of social relationships\n(Rook, 1994). One aspect, social embeddedness, focuses on\nthe extensiveness or structure of the individual's support net-\nwork. A second aspect emphasizes the relational content of\nsocial exchanges, both positive and negative. Positive social\nexchanges include various types of enacted support such as\naid, affect, and affirmation (Kahn & Antonucci, 1980), com-\npanionship, and \"positive\" social control. Negative social ex-\nchanges include interference/demands, insensitivity, criti-\ncism/ridicule, and hostility/impatience (Ruehlman & Karoly,\n1991) as well as \"negative\" social control. The third aspect,\nperceived support, refers to perceptions of the availability of\nsupport and satisfaction with the network.\nRelation Between Positive and Negative Social Exchanges\nThe dual focus on. positive and negative social exchanges\nrests on the assumption that they are not strongly related to\neach other. Otherwise, it is not possible to investigate the addi-\ntive and joint effects of positive and negative social exchanges.\nThe prevailing view among researchers who study social ties\nis that positive and negative social exchanges are unrelated\n(Rook, 1990). On the one hand, several factor analyses pro-\nvide support for this view (Finch et al., 1989; Pagel et al.,\npositive and negative social exchange scores were not com-\nputed for specific sources. On the other hand, a different con-\nclusion can be drawn from the results of Vinokur and van\nRyn's (1993) factor analysis. They examined enacted support\nfrom, and negative social exchanges with, spouse (or signifi-\ncant other) among unemployed adults. Although Vinokur and\nvan Ryn (1993) found evidence to support a two-factor model,\nthe correlation between positive and negative social exchanges\nwas over -.70. Thus, it is possible that the magnitude of the re-\nlation between positive and negative social exchanges depends\non whether the measures are source-specific.\nTo examine this possibility, we created a table for 59 arti-\nvides information about: (a) the age and type of sample, (b)\nthe source-specificity of the exchange measures, (c) whether\ngender and age were used as moderator variables, (d) the rela-\ntion between exchange measures, (e) additive effects of ex-\nchange measures on depressive symptoms, and (f) interaction\neffects of negative and positive social exchanges on depres-\nsive symptoms. The entries in the table were organized by the\nage composition of the sample (Table 1).\nWe classified the relation between positive and negative so-\ncial exchanges as: (a) strong, if measures shared at least 25%\nof the variance; (b) moderate, if measures shared 4-24% of\nthe variance; and (c) weak, if measures shared less than 4% of\nthe variance. We ended up with 53 observations because 15\nstudies did not yield any estimates and 9 studies yielded two\nestimates due to multiple measures, samples, or designs.\nFifty-five percent of the observations were weak, 30%\nwere moderate, and 15% were strong. The majority of the ob-\nservations were derived from nonsource-specific measures\n(58%). Interestingly, six of the eight strong inverse relations\nwere associated with measures targeted at specific types of\nproviders. When we classified the observations by age com-\nposition of the sample, we found that 75% of the strong in-\nverse observations were associated with the mean age of 30-\n49 years old. Our first research question addresses the issue of\nwhether in the younger and older adult samples there are in-\nverse relations between positive and negative social ex-\nchanges when the type of provider is the same (e.g., positive\nand negative social exchanges with other relatives/friends).\nAdditive  \nOne pathway by which positive and negative social ex-\nchanges may influence emotional health is by exerting a di-\nrect effect. According to the direct or additive effects model,\nas positive social exchanges increase and as negative social\nexchanges decrease, emotional health increases (Antonucci,\nSherman, & Akiyama, 1996). With respect to the additive ef-\nfects of positive and negative social exchanges on depressive\nsymptoms, we classified the results of the studies listed in\nTable 1 in terms of whether (a) the variables exerted equal ef-\nfects, (b) positive social exchanges exerted larger effects than\nnegative social exchanges, or (c) negative social exchanges\nexerted larger effects than positive social exchanges. The re-\nsults of studies were coded based upon a subjective judgment\nof the relative magnitude of the regression coefficients or cor-\nrelation coefficients for positive and negative social ex-\nchanges. We ended up with 63 observations because 8 studies\ndid not yield any estimates and 12 studies yielded two esti-\nmates due to multiple measures, samples, or designs.\nThe prevailing view among researchers who study social\nties is that negative social exchanges are more potent than\npositive social exchanges (Hobfoll & Stephens, 1990). In con-\ntrast, Ingersoll-Dayton, Morgan, and Antonucci (1997) re-\ncently found in a nationally representative sample of adults 50\nyears of age and older that positive social exchanges exert an\neffect on positive affect that is comparable to the magnitude\nof the effect of negative social exchanges on negative affect.\nFrom Table 1, we calculated that 41% of our observations\nsupported the view that negative, as opposed to positive, ex-\nchanges were more potent predictors of depressive symp-\ntoms. However, another 38% of the observations supported\nan equal-effects interpretation, and 21% of the observations\nsupported the view that positive social exchanges are more\npotent predictors of depressive symptoms than negative social\nexchanges. When we disaggregated the observations by the\nage composition of the sample, we found that for 88% of the\nobservations associated with older adult samples, negative so-\ncial exchanges were more potent than positive social ex-\nchanges. Thus, our second research question addresses the\nissue of whether negative and positive social exchanges exert\ncomparable net effects in younger and older adult samples.\nInteraction Effects Between Negative and Positive Social\nExchanges\nA second pathway by which positive and negative social\nexchanges may influence emotional health is by exerting an\ninteraction effect. According to the buffering effects model,\nsocial support cushions the adverse effect of stressors on\nemotional health (Antonucci et al., 1996). Researchers ex-\nploring the joint effects of negative and positive social\ntypically have conceptualized negative social exchanges as a\ntype of stressor (Lepore, 1992) and have examined whether\nTable 1.

Some studies have not found any evidence of stress\nbuffering (Davis, Brickman, & Baker, 1991; Rhodes, Ebert, &\nFischer, 1992). Similarly, in a study of older widows, Rook\n(1984) did not observe a significant interaction between prob-\nlematic social interaction and social support. In the other study\nthat investigated the joint effects of positive and negative social\nexchanges among older adults, Pagel et al. (1987) reported that\nthe interaction effect approached statistical significance. Using\nmeasures of \"upset\" and \"helpfulness,\" which were aggregated\nacross providers, they observed that upsetting behaviors were\nmore predictive of spousal caregivers' depressive symptoms as\nthe helpfulness of the network increased. Rook (1990) inter-\npreted this \"reverse\" buffering interaction effect as indicating\nthat negative social interactions are especially salient when the\nsource is someone providing frequent support.\nIn two studies using nonsource-specific measures, social\nsupport has been found to buffer negative social exchanges.\nRevenson, Schiaffino, Majerovitz, and Gibofsky (1991) found\nthat positive support dampened the positive relation between\nproblematic support and depressive symptoms among rheu-\nmatoid arthritis patients. Rhodes and Woods (1995) observed\nthat the adverse effect of social strain on depressive symp-\ntoms among pregnant minority adolescents was cushioned by\ncognitive guidance support.\nIn the remaining four studies which reported significant inter-\naction effects, source-specific measures of negative and positive\nsocial exchanges were used. Abbey, Abramis, and Caplan\n(1985) examined whether positive and negative social ex-\nchanges had joint effects on depressive symptoms for \"some\none person\" and for \"people in general.\" A buffering effect was\nfound for \"some one person\" but not for \"people in general.\"\nSchuster, Kessler, and Aseltine (1990) observed buffering effects\nfor men and women when the source was a relative but not\nwhen the source was either a spouse or a friend. Barrera et al.\n(1993) examined interaction effects for four sources of social\nexchanges (mother, father, closest sibling, and best same-sex\nfriend) among adolescents with and without alcoholic fathers.\nTwo interaction effects were observed when closest sibling was\nthe source. For respondents with an alcoholic father, a support-\nneutralization effect was found; conflict undermined the benefi-\ncial effect of social support on self-esteem. For respondents with\nnonalcoholic fathers, a support-amplification effect was found;\nconflict enhanced the beneficial effect of social support on self-\nesteem. Note that in all three of these studies, interaction effects\nwere examined only for the same source. For instance, in the\nBarrera et al. study (1993), whereas the support from closest sib-\nling by conflict with closest sibling interaction effect was tested,\nthe researchers did not test the support from closest sibling by\nconflict with mother interaction effect.\nIn the most thorough study done to date, Lepore (1992) con-\nducted a longitudinal study of support and conflict from room-\nmates and friends (two distinct sources). This was the only study\nwe identified that examined buffering effects both from the\nsame source as well as from different sources. Four interaction\neffects were tested (roommates negative-roommates positive;\nroommates negative-friends positive; friends negative-room-\nmates positive; and friends negative-friends positive). Evidence\nfor buffering effects was obtained only for the interaction effects\ninvolving different sources (roommates negative-friends posi-\ntive and friends negative-roommates positive).\nLepore's (1992) interpretation of this effect was that when\ninterpersonal stressors arise in one sector of a social network,\nthe most effective support is likely to emanate from other sec-\ntors of the social network. In the face of interpersonal stres-\nsors, individuals may turn to others for advice, a sympathetic\near, and pleasant experiences. In the present study, our third\nresearch question addresses whether negative and positive so-\ncial exchanges with certain combinations of sources produce\nbuffering effects. More specifically, we investigate in our\nyounger and older adult samples whether: (a) negative social\nexchanges with spouse are buffered by positive social interac-\ntion with children, other relatives/friends, and spouse; (b) neg-\native social exchanges with children are buffered by positive\nsocial interaction with other relatives/friends, spouse, and\nchildren; and (c) negative social exchanges with other rela-\ntives/friends are buffered by positive social interaction with\nchildren, spouse, and other relatives/friends.\nGender as a Moderator of Buffering Effects\nRelative to men, women have larger social networks, re-\nceive more support, and provide more support (Antonucci &\nAkiyama, 1987a). Whereas men receive more support than\nwomen from spouses (Schuster et al., 1990), women receive\nmore support than men from friends and other relatives\nferences in the effects of social support on psychological dis-\ntress suggests that different sources vary in their impact on\nmen and women. On the one hand, spouses seem to be more\nimportant sources of support for men than women (Belle,\n1987). On the other hand, other family members and friends\nappear to contribute more to the emotional well-being of\nwomen than men (Gore & Colten, 1991). However, these\ngender differences in the effects of various sources of support\non psychological distress have not always been observed (see\nAs shown in Table 1, six studies investigated whether there\nwere gender differences in the impact of positive social ex-\nchanges on emotional health. In the only study of older\nadults, positive social exchanges exerted a comparable influ-\nence on the emotional health of women and men (Turner,\n1994). In three other studies, gender did not moderate the re-\nlation between positive social exchanges and emotional health\n(Henderson, Bryne, Duncan-Jones, Scott, & Adcock, 1980;\nmaining two studies, positive social exchanges had a greater\neffect on the emotional health of women than men (Schuster\nWe located seven studies that examined whether gender mod-\nerated the effects of negative social exchanges on emotional\nhealth. Negative social exchanges exerted comparable effects on\nthe emotional health of older women and older men (Turner,\n1994). In three other studies, no evidence of gender by negative\nsocial exchange interaction effects were observed (Lepore,\ning three studies, women were affected more than men by nega-\ntive social exchanges (Henderson et al., 1980; Schuster et al.,\nmore affected than women by negative social exchanges.\nGender differences in the influence of negative social ex-\nchanges may depend on the source (Rook, 1994). Bolger,\nDeLongis, Kessler, and Schilling (1989) found that women\nwere more adversely affected than men by negative social\nexchanges with their spouses, but Schuster et al. (1990)\nfound that women and men were equally affected by nega-\ntive social exchanges with their spouses. Negative social ex-\nchanges with relatives appear to exert a greater influence on\nthe depressive symptoms of women as compared to men\nIf social exchanges with different sources vary in their im-\npact on the psychological distress of men and women (with\nmen being more affected than women by the spousal relation-\nship and women being more affected than men by relation-\nships with other family members and friends), then the joint\neffect of positive and negative social exchanges may be con-\nditioned by gender. Our fourth research question addresses\nthe issue of whether gender interacts with negative and posi-\ntive social exchanges with various sources to influence de-\npressive symptoms in younger and older adults.\nMETHOD\nSample\nThe data for this study are taken from the first wave of the\nAmericans' Changing Lives (ACL) Survey. The data were col-\nlected in 1986 using face-to-face interviews of a national proba-\nbility sample. A total of 3,617 respondents residing in the conti-\nnental United States were interviewed. Blacks and persons over\nthe age of 60 were sampled at twice the rate of Whites and peo-\nple between the ages of 40 and 59. Thus, the sample was\nweighted according to the following sample selection ratios: (a)\nWhite men younger than 60 = 1; (b) White women younger\n60 and older = 2; (e) Black men younger than 60 = 2; (f) Black\nand (h) Black women 60 and over = 4. The overall response rate\nfor this survey was 67%. The interviews lasted an average of 86\nminutes. For the analyses presented within this article, the sam-\nple was divided into two age groups (younger adults = younger\nthan 60 years old; older adults = 60 years old and older) and\nthen weighted to take into account the oversampling for Blacks.\nTo be included in the present analyses, survey participants\nhad to meet four criteria: (a) have a living spouse; (b) have at\nleast one child aged 16 or over residing outside the home; (c)\nhave at least one other relative or friend; and (d) have no\nmissing data on any of the study variables. These criteria\nWe decided to disaggregate our sample by age rather than\nexamine age as a moderator variable because the latter ap-\nproach potentially could have resulted in significant fourth-\norder interaction effects (positive social exchanges by nega-\ntive social exchanges by gender by age) which would have\nbeen difficult to interpret. In addition, we did not pursue race\ndifferences in the effects of positive and negative social ex-\nchanges because, after weighting within age groups, there\nwere less than 45 Black men and women within each age\ngroup. We also considered weighting within racial groups in-\nstead of age groups. However, this approach still resulted in\nless than 50 Black men and women 60 and over.\nMeasures\nInformation on the central tendency and variability of the\nmeasures for each age group is provided in Table 2.\nDepressive symptoms. -- During the ACL interview, respon-\ndents were asked 11 of the 20 items that comprise the Center for\nEpidemiological Studies Depression Scale CES-D (Radloff,\n1977). These items were: (1) felt depressed, (2) everything was\nan effort, (3) sleep restless, (4) happy (reverse coded), (5) lonely,\n(6) people were unfriendly, (7) enjoyed life (reverse coded), (8)\nappetite was poor, (9) felt sad, (10) felt people disliked me, and\n(11) could not get going. Respondents were asked to indicate\nhow often during the past week they had experienced the symp-\ntoms on a 3-point, rather than a 4-point, scale. The response op-\ntions were: 1 = hardly ever; 2 = some of the time; 3 = most of\nthe time. Scores were summed over the 11 items with higher\nscores indicating more depressive symptoms. The 11-item ver-\nsion of the CES-D has been shown to correlate .95 with the\nunabridged version of the scale (see Umberson, Wortman, &\nKessler, 1992). In the present study, the internal consistency reli-\nability estimate of the 11-item version of the CES-D scale was\n.83 for younger adults and .77 for older adults.\nPositive and negative social exchanges. -- Positive social\nexchanges were measured using two items that ask respon-\ndents to indicate how much each of three sources (1) makes\nthem feel loved and cared for and (2) is willing to listen when\nthey need to talk about their worries or problems. These items\ntap the affect and affirmation dimensions of enacted social\nsupport. Negative social exchanges were measured using two\nitems that ask respondents to indicate how often each of three\nsources (1) makes too many demands and (2) is critical of\nthem or what they do. These items tap the interference/\nTable 2. Means and Standard Deviations for All Study Variables\nand Age Differences\nVariable\nAGE\nBLACK\nGENDER\nEDUC\nCONTACT\nCCONTACT\nADLT\nOld(n\nM\nSD\nM\nt\n--\ndemands and criticism/ridicule dimensions of negative social\nexchanges. Responses to each social exchange item were\ncoded according to a 5-point scale (1 = not at all, 2 = a little, 3\n= some, 4 = quite a bit, and 5 = a great deal).\nThe three sources of positive and negative social ex-\nchanges were spouse, children, and other relatives/friends.\nRespondents were not asked to identify a particular individal\nwhen the source was children or other relatives/friends. Thus,\nwhen the source was one's spouse, the social exchange items\nreferred to a single provider, whereas when the source was ei-\nther one's children or one's other relatives/friends, the social\nexchange items may have referred to multiple providers.\nA total of six scores were derived from the social exchange\nitems: positive social exchanges with spouse (SPSE), positive\nsocial exchanges with children (CPSE), positive social ex-\nchanges with other relatives/friends (OPSE), negative social ex-\nchanges with spouse (SNSE), negative social exchanges with\nchildren (CNSE), and negative social exchanges with other rel-\natives/friends (ONSE). Each score was computed by summing\nthe responses to the two items. Among the younger respon-\ndents, the internal consistency reliability estimates for these\nscales ranged from .51 (ONSE) to .70 (CPSE). Among the\nolder respondents, the internal consistency reliability estimates\nfor the social exchange measures ranged from .47 (ONSE) to\n.66 (OPSE). As can be seen in Table 2, for younger and older\nadults alike, positive social exchange scores are substantially\nhigher than negative social exchange scores for each source.\nControl variables. -- To control for spurious effects, sev-\neral additional variables were included in the multiple regres-\nsion analyses. Age was measured in years; Black indicates\nthat the respondent's race is BlackVAfrican American and is\ncoded 1. Gender was coded as a contrast effect with men = -1\nand women = +1. Education was measured as years of\nschooling completed.\nSince it is reasonable to expect that positive and negative so-\ncial exchanges will vary by the amount of communication be-\ntween respondents and their social network, two measures of\nopportunities for social interaction were included in the analy-\nses. Contact (CONTACT) was assessed by summing re-\nsponses to three items regarding frequency of interaction dur-\ning a typical week with relatives, friends, and neighbors: (a)\nhow often respondents talk on the telephone, (b) how often re-\nspondents go out or get together in others' homes, and (c) how\noften they attend meetings or programs of groups, clubs, or or-\nganizations. Responses range from 1 (never) to 6 (more than\nonce a week). Child contact (CCONTACT) was measured by\na single item asking respondents how often they have contact\nwith children 16 years and older not residing in the home.\nResponses range from 1 (never) to 6 (more than once a week).\nFunctional health status (ADLT) was included because it is\nstrongly correlated with depressive symptoms (Newsom &\nSchulz, 1996). In addition, an extensive body of literature\ndemonstrates that dependency and the need for care can create\nburdens that may lead to conflict among patients, their families,\nand their friends (DiMatteo & Hays, 1981). Functional health\nstatus was measured using a Gutman-type scale with four\nlevels of impairment: (a) most severe category consists of\nrespondents who were confined to bed or chair and/or who\nexperienced a lot of difficulty bathing or could not bathe;\n(b) moderately severe category consists of respondents who\nexperienced a lot of difficulty climbing stairs or could not do it\nand/or had a lot of difficulty walking or could not do it, but\nwere not in the highest severity category; (c) least severe cate-\ngory consists of respondents who experienced a lot of difficulty\ndoing heavy housework or could not do it, but were not in the\ntwo highest severity categories; and (4) no functional impair-\nment category consists of respondents who answered no to all\nfour of the functional impairment questions. The levels were\nreverse coded so that higher scores indicate greater impairment.\nRESULTS\nCorrelational Analysis\nAge differences. -- Table 2 presents the results of bivariate\ntests of age differences in the study variables. There, it can\nbe seen that Blacks were more prevalent in the younger\ngroup than in the older group and women were more preva-\nlent in the younger group (56%) than in the older group\n(48%). This reversal of the trend for the ratio of women to\nmen to increase with age is probably due to using marital sta-\ntus as a selection criterion.\nRelative to younger respondents, older respondents had fewer\nyears of education. Older respondents had more contact with\nolder children living outside of the home than younger respon-\ndents. The level of functional impairment was higher among\nolder respondents. Compared to younger respondents, older re-\nspondents reported fewer negative social exchanges with all\nthree sources and more positive social exchanges with children.\nOlder and younger respondents did not differ in their frequency\nof positive social exchanges with their spouses and other rela-\ntives/friends and in their level of depressive symptoms.\nRelations among sets of variables. -- The correlations\namong the variables included in the present study, disaggre-\ngated by age group, are presented in Table 3. First, we in-\nspected the correlations between the control variables and the\nsocial exchange variables. Within the older group, the strongest\nrelation was between social contact and positive social ex-\nchanges with other relatives/friends (r = .22). The second\nlargest relation was between gender and positive social ex-\nchange with one's spouse, with women reporting fewer posi-\ntive social exchanges with their spouses than men (r = -.20).\nWithin the younger group, contact with older children living\noutside of the home and positive social exchange with children\nexhibited the strongest association (r = .41). The second largest\nrelation was between gender and positive social exchange with\nother relatives/friends, with women reporting more positive so-\ncial exchanges with other relatives/friends than men (r = .34).\nSecond, we observed which control variables and social\nexchange variables had the highest correlation with depres-\nsive symptoms. Among older respondents, functional impair-\nment was the strongest correlate of depressive symptoms (r =\n.42). Among younger respondents, positive social exchanges\nwith one's spouse (r = -.31), and functional impairment (r =\n.30), were related most strongly to depressive symptoms.\nRelations among social exchange variables. -- Our first re-\nsearch question pertained to the correlations between negative\nO\n-a\no\n<\nUJ\nUJ\nTf -- ON CO <N VO\n(N (N -- -- CN --\n(N -- CO (NI\nX r~ ON VO\nO C N t N\n( N O O\n--\noo\no\nO -- O\nr- -- t^\no -- o\n>/>\no\nOO\nO\nC N C N --\nfN -- CN\nr- oo vo\nIs\n\u00bb d\no n S\nIk'\nand positive social exchanges with the same source. All six\ncorrelations relevant to this research question were negative\nand significant at/? < .001 (see Table 3). For older adults, the\ncorrelations between negative and positive social exchanges\nwith the same source ranged from -.24 for relationship with\nother relatives/friends (ONSE with OPSE) to -.43 for rela-\ntionship with spouse (SNSE with SPSE). For younger adults,\nthe correlations between negative and positive social ex-\nchanges with the same source ranged from -.23 for relation-\nship with other relatives/friends (ONSE with OPSE) to -.33\nfor relationship with spouse (SNSE with SPSE).\nMultiple Regression Analyses\nMain effects model. -- Our second research question per-\ntained to the relative contribution of positive and negative so-\ncial exchanges with different sources to the depressive symp-\ntoms of younger and older adults. To address this question,\nwe carried out two hierarchical regression analyses within\neach age group. In one analysis, the seven control variables\nwere entered in the first step, the three positive social ex-\nchange variables were entered in the second step, and the\nthree negative social exchange variables were entered last. In\nthe other analysis, the order of entry for the positive and nega-\ntive social exchange variables was reversed.\nIn the older adult sample, the control variables accounted\nables were entered in the second step, they accounted for\n8.6% of the variance in depressive symptoms, incremental\nthree negative social exchange predictors was .026, incremen-\nexchange variables were entered in the second step, they ex-\nplained 7.2% of the variance in depressive symptoms, incre-\nthe three positive social exchange predictors was .040, incre-\nFor younger adults, the control variables accounted for\n9.88, p < .001.

With all vari-\nables in the equation, the model for older adults accounted for\npositive social exchanges with children, other relatives/friends,\nand spouse (CPSE, OPSE, and SPSE) all exerted significant,\nnegative effects on depressive symptoms, and negative social\nexchanges with spouse and other relatives/friends (SNSE and\nONSE) were positive predictors of depressive symptoms.\nWith all variables in the equation, the model for younger\nadults explained 26.3% of the variance in depressive symp-\nSPSE was a significant negative predictor and SNSE was a\nsignificant positive predictor of depressive symptoms.\nWe did not make any predictions regarding whether individ-\nual social exchange predictors would vary in their influence\nacross age groups. On a post hoc basis, we tested whether the\nunstandardized regression coefficients associated with the six\nsocial exchange predictors were equal in the older and\nyounger age groups (Marascuilo & Levin, 1983). Alpha was\nset at .05 for the set of six comparisons. The results indicated\nthat positive social exchanges with one's spouse exerted a\ngreater influence in the younger (b = -.54) as compared to\nTwo-way interaction effects models. -- Our third research\nTable 4.

Following the recommendation\nof Aiken and West (1991), we centered the negative and posi-\ntive social exchange variables. For each variable within each\nage group, this was accomplished by subtracting the mean\nfrom each score in the distribution. To avoid problems associ-\nated with multicolinearity, we examined, in separate analyses,\nwhether the adverse effects of (a) negative social exchanges\nwith spouse; (b) negative social exchanges with children; and\n(c) negative social exchanges with other relatives/friends were\ncushioned by positive social exchanges with spouse, children,\nand other relatives/friends, respectively.\nModel I. SNSE by positive social exchange interaction ef-\nfects. -- The negative social exchanges with spouse by posi-\ntive social exchanges with (a) spouse; (b) children; and (c)\nother relatives/friends product terms were entered into the\nmodel after entering the seven control variables and the six\nsocial exchange variables. For older adults, the set of interac-\ntion terms approached significance, incremental F(3,832) =\nthe SNSE X CPSE interaction term was significant (/? < .05).\nFor younger adults, the three interaction terms collectively\nmade a significant contribution to the prediction of depressive\n.029. The only significant interaction term was negative social\nexchanges with spouse by positive social exchanges with\nspouse (SNSE by SPSE),/? < .01 (see Table 5).\nModel II. CNSE by positive social exchange interaction ef-\nfects. -- In a parallel analysis, we examined whether negative\nsocial exchanges with children by positive social exchanges\nwith (a) one's spouse; (b) children; and (c) other relatives/\nfriends interaction terms make a significant incremental con-\ntribution to the prediction of depressive symptoms among\nolder adults and younger adults above and beyond the control\nand main effects variables. For the older adults, the three in-\nteraction terms in concert approached significance, incremen-\nonly significant interaction term was CNSE X OPSE, p < .05.\nFor the younger adults, the three interaction terms collectively\n.09, net R2 = .011. The only significant interaction term in-\nvolved CNSE X CPSE, p < .05.\nModel III. ONSE by positive social exchange interaction\neffects. -- In this analysis, we examined whether the negative\nsocial exchanges with other relatives/friends by positive so-\ncial exchange with each of the three sources make a signifi-\ncant incremental contribution to the prediction of depressive\nsymptoms above and beyond the control and main effects\nvariables. For older adults, the three interaction terms together\n= .019. Individually, both the ONSE X CPSE and ONSE X\nOPSE interaction terms were unique predictors of depressive\nsymptoms (highest/? < .001). For younger adults, the three in-\nteraction terms as a set also made a significant contribution to\nthe prediction of depressive symptoms, incremental F(3,435)\nwasONSEXOPSE,/?<.05.\nModel IV. Gender by negative social exchange by positive\nsocial exchange interaction effects. -- Our final research\nquestion addressed whether gender moderated the joint ef-\nfects of negative and positive social exchanges. Within each\nage group, three models were constructed. In the first model,\nin the first step, the control variables and the main effect so-\ncial exchange variables were entered. In the second step, nine\ntwo-way interaction terms were entered (gender by each of\nthe six social exchange variables and negative social ex-\nchanges with spouse by the three positive social exchange\nvariables). In the last step, the Gender X SNSE X SPSE,\nGender X SNSE X CPSE, and Gender X SNSE X OPSE\nthree-way interaction effects were entered. In the second\nmodel, CNSE replaced SNSE in three of the two-way interac-\ntion terms and in the three three-way interaction terms. In the\nthird model, ONSE replaced CNSE in three of the two-way\ninteraction terms and in the three three-way interaction terms.\nThese models revealed no significant (p > .05) three-way in-\nteraction effects.\nProbes of the significant interaction effects. -- For each sig-\nnificant two-way interaction effect, we examined the simple\nslopes associated with the negative social exchange predictor\nvariable at particular values of the positive social exchange\nmoderator variable. These simple slopes were generated ac-\ncording to procedures described by Aiken and West (1991).\nWe computed the slope for the predictor variable at exemplar\nhigh, average, and low values (i.e., +1 SD, 0 SD, and -1 SD)\nof the moderator variable.\nTable 5.

For older adults, the results provide some sup-\nport for the nption that negative social exchanges with one\nsource are buffered by positive social exchanges with another\nsource. CPSE buffers the inimical effect of SNSE on depressive\nsymptoms. SNSE is significantly (p < .001), positively related to\ndepressive symptoms unless CPSE is high. We see evidence of\n\"quasi\" buffering for the CNSE X OPSE interaction effect.\nAlthough CNSE is not significantly related to depressive symp-\ntoms at low, average or high values of OPSE, the trend is for the\nslope of CNSE to be positive when OPSE is low and to be nega-\ntive when OPSE is high. Inspection of the simple slopes associ-\nated with the ONSE X CPSE interaction effect among older\nadults indicates that CPSE buffers the adverse influence of\nONSE on depressive symptoms. When CPSE is high, ONSE\ndoes not have a significant effect on depressive symptoms. The\nform of the ONSE X OPSE interaction effect indicates \"re-\nverse\" buffering. As can be seen in Figure 1, ONSE exhibits a\nsignificant (highest p < .01), positive relation with depressive\nsymptoms when OPSE is either average or high.\nFor younger adults, the results do not support the notion\nthat buffering is associated with negative and positive ex-\nchanges from different sources. Contrary to this notion, SPSE\nbuffers the adverse impact of SNSE on depressive symptoms.\nSNSE is significantly (p < .001), positively related to depres-\nsive symptoms only when SPSE is low. CPSE appears to be a\nquasi buffer of the influence of CNSE on depressive symp-\ntoms. Although CNSE is not significantly related to depres-\nsive symptoms at low, average, or high values of CPSE, the\ntrend is for the slope of CNSE to be positive when CPSE is\nlow and to be negative when CPSE is high.

Alpha was set at .05 for the set of six compar-\nisons. The results indicated that the unstandardized regression\ncoefficient associated with the interaction between SNSE and\nSPSE was significantly different in the older (b = .02) and\ntion, the unstandardized regression coefficient associated with\nthe interaction between ONSE and OPSE was significantly\ndifferent in the older (b = .15) and younger (b = -.14) groups,\nOur major findings are reviewed and discussed below.\nFirst, we examine our findings with respect to the association\nbetween measures of negative and positive social exchanges.\nSecond, we consider the relative contribution of negative and\npositive social exchange to the prediction of depressive symp-\ntoms. Third, we summarize our findings with respect to the\njoint effects of negative and positive social exchanges on de-\npressive symptoms within each age group. Fourth, we com-\nment on our findings with respect to gender as a moderator of\nthe joint effects of negative and positive social exchanges. We\nconclude with a discussion of limitations and some directions\nfor future research.\nIndependence ofNegative and Positive Social Exchanges\nThe findings from studies employing factor analysis (e.g.,\nFinch et al., 1989) and studies using correlational analyses on\naggregate measures of negative and positive social exchanges\n(e.g., Rook, 1984) have lead researchers to conclude that neg-\native and positive social exchanges are unrelated (Rook,\n1990). Contrary to this view, several studies found inverse as-\nsociations between negative and positive social exchanges\nwithin some sources (e.g., Vinokur & van Ryn, 1993).\nUsing source-specific measures, the median correlation be-\ntween negative and positive social exchanges with the same\nsource was -.27 and -.39 in the younger and older age\ngroups, respectively. By comparison, when different sources\nwere involved, the median correlation between negative and\npositive social exchanges was -.155 and -.15 in the younger\nand older age group, respectively. Thus, in both age groups,\nthere appears to be a stronger relation between negative and\npositive social exchanges when respondents are rating the\nsame source as compared to different sources.\nAmong younger and older respondents alike, the associa-\ntion between negative and positive social exchanges with the\nsame source was strongest when the source was one's spouse\nrather than children and other relatives/friends. One possibil-\nity is that the association between positive and negative social\nexchanges is stronger when a specific individual is rated as\nopposed to a category of people (e.g., spouse as opposed to\nchildren). Alternatively, the inverse relation between positive\nand negative social exchanges may be stronger when more, as\nopposed to less, intimate sources are rated. Unfortunately, in\nthe present study, source intimacy and category size cannot be\ndisentangled. The magnitude of the largest correlation (-.43)\nsuggests that in both age groups the absence of negative so-\ncial exchanges cannot be equated with an abundance of posi-\ntive social exchanges.\nRelative Contribution of Negative and Positive Social\nExchanges\nResearchers studying the additive effects of negative and\npositive social exchanges on depressive symptoms have\nsometimes found that negative social exchanges are more po-\ntent predictors of depressive symptoms than positive social\nexchanges (e.g., Ruehlman & Wolchik, 1988), whereas other\nresearchers have found that negative and positive social ex-\nchanges exert comparable effects on depressive symptoms\n(e.g., Manne & Zautra, 1989). From our literature review, we\nconcluded that the differential effect of negative relative to\npositive social exchanges on depressive symptoms might be\nstronger among older adults relative to younger adults.\nInstead, we found that positive social exchanges exerted a\nstronger unique effect on depressive symptoms than negative\nsocial exchanges in both the younger and older adult samples.\nIn the case of negative social exchanges, few individuals are\nnominated as providers and thus, aggregated and disaggre-\ngated measures may be equally predictive of depressive\nsymptoms. In contrast, many individuals are nominated as\nproviders of positive social exchanges. Consequently, aggre-\ngate measures that sum over ratings of support from diverse\nproviders may mask the effects of key network members\n(Barrera et al., 1993). Our findings with respect to younger\nadults are consistent with the notion that disaggregated mea-\nsures may be more predictive of depressive symptoms than\naggregated measures. Specifically, within the younger adult\ngroup, the key source of positive social exchanges was one's\nspouse (see House, Umberson, & Landis, 1988).\nFor older adults, however, positive social exchanges with\nvarious sources are all associated with having relatively few\ndepressive symptoms. With age, positive social interaction\nwith close friends and children, as well as one's spouse, may\nbe important for sustaining emotional health (Adams &\nBlieszner, 1995). It should be noted that the comparison of\nthe effects of the social exchange predictors in the older and\nyounger groups yielded only one significant difference: SPSE\nwas a stronger predictor of depressive symptoms in the\nyounger group than in the older group.\nJoint Effects of Negative and Positive Social Exchanges\nWith the exception of Lepore's (1992) study, researchers\nhave not examined whether positive social exchanges buffer\nnegative social exchanges when different sources are in-\nvolved in the negative and positive exchanges. Building upon\nthe theorizing and findings of Lepore (1992), we examined\nwhether buffering effects are more likely to occur when dif-\nferent sources as opposed to the same sources are involved in\nthe negative and positive social exchanges.\nOlder adults. -- The findings of the present study for older\nadults offer qualified support for the \"different source\" buffer-\ning hypothesis. Positive social exchanges with children cush-\nioned the adverse effects of negative social exchanges with\nboth spouse and other relatives/friends. Furthermore, when\nolder adults experienced negative social exchanges with chil-\ndren, positive social exchanges with other relatives/friends\nwere most helpful.\nChildren appear to be effective support providers to older\nadults when problematic social interaction occurs with other\nmembers of their social network. Approximately 80% of\nolder parents visit with one of their children on a biweekly\nbasis (Krout, 1988). Furthermore, children are likely to be\nwell acquainted with the source of the problematic social in-\nteraction, and may offer different and fresh perspectives from\none's spouse (Rossi & Rossi, 1990). When children are the\nsource of the negative social exchanges, friends and other rel-\natives may be best positioned to provide unique perspectives\non the problematic social tie.\nThe form of the same-source interaction effect for negative\nand positive social exchanges with other/relatives friends sug-\ngests \"reverse\" buffering (see Figure 1). ONSE exerted its\nlargest effect when OPSE was high. Barrera et al. (1993) sug-\ngest an explanation for this effect, which they refer to as conflict\nneutralization. According to this explanation, high conflict with\na network member neutralizes the potential benefits of support\nfrom that person. Therefore, when conflict is high, social sup-\nport does not influence depressive symptoms. In contrast, when\nconflict is low, as social support increases, depressive symptoms\ndecrease. Barrera et al. (1993) also suggested that conflict neu-\ntralization may be more likely to occur in the context of low-\nintimacy relationships. The category of support, \"other rela-\ntives/friends,\" may very well include network members with\nwhom the focal person has low-intimacy relationships.\nYounger adults. -- Tests of interaction effects among\nyounger adults did not confirm the different source buffering\nhypothesis. Instead, buffering effects were observed when\nnegative and positive exchanges occurred with the same\nsource. Buffering effects for the same source have been occa-\nsionally observed in previous research. In the Abbey et al.\n(1985) study, support buffered conflict for \"some one per-\nson.\" In the Barrera et al. (1993) study, support buffered con-\nflict for siblings in the nonalcoholic father sample. In the\nSchuster et al. (1990) study, support buffered conflict for rela-\ntives. At least two explanations for these effects can be pro-\nvided. First, Schuster et al. (1990) suggested that negative so-\ncial interactions with a network member are perceived as less\nserious when they occur in the context of a highly supportive\nrelationship. Second, it is possible that support is viewed as\nvery helpful when it comes from a network member who\nsometimes responds negatively to requests for assistance.\nThe comparison of the negative by positive social exchange\ninteraction effects in the older and younger groups yielded two\nsignificant differences. The SNSE X SPSE interaction effect\nwas a stronger predictor of depressive symptoms in the\nyounger than in the older group. The form of the ONSE X\nOPSE interaction effect was different in the younger and older\ngroups. In the younger group, OPSE buffered the adverse ef-\nfect of ONSE. In contrast, in the older group, OPSE amplified\nthe adverse effect of ONSE on depressive symptoms.\nThe configuration of findings discussed above raises an in-\ntriguing question: Why do same source buffering effects\noccur in the younger adult sample whereas different source\nbuffering effects occur in the older adult sample? One expla-\nnation can be derived from socioemotional selectivity theory\n(Carstensen, 1992). According to this theory, as people age,\nthey become more select in their social relationships, seeking\nto maintain relationships with people who enhance their emo-\ntional well-being. Our findings with respect to age differences\nin social exchanges are consistent with this notion. Relative to\nyounger respondents, older respondents reported fewer nega-\ntive social exchanges with spouse, children, and other rela-\ntives/friends. At the same time, older respondents, as com-\npared to younger respondents, reported more positive social\nexchanges with children and equivalent levels of positive so-\ncial exchanges with spouse and other relatives/friends.\nOne consequence of increasing social selectivity with age\nmay be that older people are more reliant than younger people\non fewer network members for their social support (Antonucci\net al., 1996). To avoid jeopardizing relationships with key sup-\nport providers, older people may be more likely than younger\npeople to seek support for interpersonal stress from sources\nnot linked to the stress. This notion is consistent with Hirsch's\n(1980) finding that women making life transitions fared better\nif they compartmentalized their social networks.\nGender as a Moderator Variable\nWe found no evidence that the joint effects of negative and\npositive social exchanges on depressive symptoms is condi-\ntioned by gender. In other studies that have looked at Gender\nX Negative Social Exchanges and Gender X Positive Social\nExchanges interaction effects, the results have been inconsis-\ntent. Whereas some researchers have found that negative so-\ncial exchanges exert a stronger influence on depressive symp-\ntoms among women than men (Henderson et al.> 1980;\nSchuster et al., 1990), other researchers have found no\nevidence that gender moderates the negative social ex-\nchange-depressive symptoms relation (Semple, 1992; Turner,\n1994). Similarly, positive social exchanges have been found\nto relate more strongly to depressive symptoms among\nwomen than men in some studies (Abbey et al., 1995;\nVinokur et al., 1996). Perhaps, research on gender differences\nin the effects of social exchanges would benefit by focusing\non gender-role identity (Hyde, Krajnik, & Skuldt-Nieder-\nLimitations\nThe present study has at least two major limitations. One lim-\nitation pertains to the measures of social exchanges. These mea-\nsures have limited reliability and variability. In addition, they do\nnot tap important dimensions of relational content, such as aid\nand hostility/impatience. Furthermore, although the measures\npertaining to children and other relatives/friends were source-\nspecific, they were not provider-specific. Therefore, it is not pos-\nsible in the present study to ascertain whether the same indi-\nviduals were the source of the negative and positive social\nexchanges with children and with other relatives/friends. The\nsecond limitation of the present study relates to its cross-sec-\ntional design. The relations between positive and negative social\nexchanges and depressive symptoms may well be reciprocal.\nFuture Directions\nThe present study suggests several topics for future re-\nsearch. One topic pertains to the meaning of positive and nega-\ntive social exchanges across adulthood. For example, adult\nchildren and their aging parents may interpret the demands\nmade on them in qualitatively distinct ways (Fingerman,\n1996). Similarly, tangible assistance may be perceived in a\nvery different manner by adult children and their aging parents\n(Antonucci et al., 1996). Thus, the equivalence of measures of\npositive and negative social exchanges with specific providers\nacross age groups should be investigated. A second issue per-\ntains to the relation between negative and positive social ex-\nchanges. It is important to determine whether this relation\nvaries with the intimacy of the recipient-provider relationship\nand/or the specificity of the recipient-provider relationship.\nIn the present study, older respondents reported fewer neg-\native social exchanges than younger respondents. Longi-\ntudinal analyses could be performed to determine whether\nnegative social exchanges decrease with age and, if so, why.\nOne possibility is that with age individuals become more\nadept at regulating their emotions (Lawton, Kleban,\nRajagopal, & Dean, 1992). Furthermore, it would be interest-\ning to ascertain the effects of positive and negative social ex-\nchanges with specific network members on adults' depressive\nsymptoms. For example, building on the work of Hirsch and\nRapkin (1986a), do positive social exchanges with one's best\nfriend mitigate the inimical effect of negative social ex-\nchanges with one's spouse? Future research is warranted to\nexamine why positive social exchanges tend to buffer nega-\ntive social exchanges among older adults when different\nsources are involved whereas buffering effects tend to occur\namong younger adults when the same source is involved.\nFinally, more work is needed that investigates the process(es)\nby which negative and positive social exchanges exert joint ef-\nfects on depressive symptoms. In the present study, we adopted\na stress-buffering perspective in which we assumed that follow-\ning interpersonal stress, the focal person turns to other network\nmembers for help. Alternatively, it is possible to conceptualize\nthe joint effects that were observed in the present study in terms\nof conflict enhancing the benefits of positive social exchanges.\nAccording to this view, the benefits of positive social exchanges\nbecome more potent in the context of negative social interac-\ntions. For example, positive social exchanges with a close friend\nmay evoke more positive affect when they are preceded by neg-\native, as opposed to positive, spousal interactions.\nIn conclusion, in the majority of studies of positive and neg-\native social exchanges, researchers have used measures in\nwhich either no provider was specified or responses were ag-\ngregated over diverse sources. These approaches appear to be\nproblematic for older adults because family members and\nfriends serve different functions (Larson, Mannell, & Zuzanek,\namong negative social ties, positive social ties, and psycholog-\nical outcomes are more complex than originally conceived.\nSpecifically, they highlight the importance of taking into ac-\ncount the age of the recipient and the provider-recipient rela-\ntionship when studying the joint influence of negative and pos-\nitive social exchanges on adults' depressive symptoms.\n"
