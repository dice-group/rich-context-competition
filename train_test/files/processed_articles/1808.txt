US\nadolescent girls tend to experience an earlier growth spurt than do the Dutch and the velocity of\ngrowth of US boys slows down faster after the adolescent growth spurt than does that of their Dutch\ncounterparts. The latter end up being approximately 5.6 cm taller and their median BMI values are\n1.9\u00ad2.0 less than that of US youth between the ages of 10 and 19. This implies that US boys of the\nsame height at age 19 are 8.8 kg heavier than their Dutch counterparts, and girls of age 13 are 7.2 kg\nheavier.\nDiscussion: Some studies link high BMI values in childhood to an earlier onset of adolescence, which in\nturn has been linked to less growth thereafter.\nConclusion: The fast tempo of growth of the US children may be associated with high energy balance,\nwhich leads to higher BMI values and which in turn may be associated with less growth during\nadolescence.\n",

It takes generations for immigrants to reach American height levels\naged 20\u00ad29 were 8.5 cm shorter than Non-Hispanic white Americans (McDowell et al.\n2005, p. 26). Furthermore, immigrants were also excluded from the Dutch sample. In the\nNetherlands, boys of Turkish origin at age 14 were 10.9 cm shorter than their Dutch\ncounterparts, and similarly Moroccan children were 8.5 cm shorter (Fredriks 2004, pp. 113,\n133). (Both Turkish and Moroccan children were either first or second generation\nimmigrants.) Differences in BMI values by ethnicity, however, are less blatant. Among\nmales, for example, the BMI values of non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Mexican-Americans\nThe US and Dutch data sets are comparable insofar as both are representative of the\nrespective domestic-born population. The Dutch sample pertains to those who had Dutch\nparents (both) or if not, at least one parent had to be Dutch and the other could be West\nEuropean. Insofar as we have excluded from the US sample those who were not born in the\nUS as well as Hispanics and Asians, the two samples are comparable. The weights given in\nthe sample were used to calculate all US statistics.\nMethods\nUsing the three most recent (biennial) surveys referred to jointly as NHANES 1999\u00ad2004\nwe calculate the weighted averages of US children's height by age stratified by gender.\nThe data are available from the Center of Disease Control (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/\nnhanes.htm). The weights, provided by the center, are designed to render the sample\nrepresentative of the US population. Because of the relatively small number of observations\nin some cells, we smooth the obtained result with a non-linear regression model using\nBayesX, a `freeware' program (Lang and Sunder 2003). BayesX enables us to smooth\nadjacent values of the coefficients using polynomial splines for non-linear effects. The values\nof the function provide the smoothed values of the height by age profile calculated from the\nraw data (Table I, column A). Furthermore, we reproduce Dutch reference values (1997) to\nwhich the US children are compared (Fredriks et al. 2000b) (Table I, columns B, F). The\nDutch data used for this comparison were kindly provided by Stef van Buuren of the\nNetherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research and are the same as those\npublished in Fredriks et al. (2000). The US data are averages over the year for a particular\nage while Dutch data pertain to the mid-year values estimated using the LMS method\n(Cole 1990). The Dutch BMI values and weights are also compared to current US values\n(Table I, columns G, H).\n594 J. Komlos & A. Breitfelder\nTable I.

The curves have not been smoothed for whites\notherwise the `all girls' and `white girls' lines would be hardly distinguishable.\nGrowth velocities are not accurately estimated in cross-sectional samples, but insofar as\nboth the US and Dutch samples are cross-sectional the biases should be similar and\ntherefore one might gain some insights by the comparison (Figures 4 and 5). Among girls\nthe Dutch and US growth increment curves would be very similar provided the Dutch values\nwere lagged by 1 year, except that among US girls the adolescent growth spurt is somewhat\nmore concentrated around the peak growth increment between ages 9.5 and 10.5. Among\nDutch girls the average growth increments are slightly smaller between the ages of 8 and 10,\nimplying that there are fewer precocious girls in the sample than among US girls, but there\nare more girls in the Dutch sample who experience their peak growth later, at age 12 and\ntherefore increase the average values (Figure 4). Because of the 1 year's worth of longer\ngrowth prior to adolescence the adult height of Dutch females is nearly 6 cm above that of\ntheir US counterparts (Figures 2 and 3).\nThe growth increment curves are quite similar among US and Dutch boys except that\nthere are few more precocious boys at ages 10.5\u00ad11.5 in the former. The greatest\ngrowth increments are at similar ages 12.5\u00ad14.5 in both samples (Figure 5). However, the\ndecrease in the growth increments is steeper among US boys between ages 15 and 17,\nindicating either that growth in late adolescence decelerated more rapidly or that a larger\nnumber of Dutch boys experience more growth in late adolescence than US boys. This\ndifference in growth at ages 16\u00ad20 accounts for nearly half of the difference in adult height.\nThe whites-only curves are not depicted in Figures 4 and 5 because the values coincide with\nthe `all' US graphs.\nsubstantially so after age 8 (Table I, column G and Figure 6).

Breitfelder\na difference in weight of some 8.8 kg for boys and 7.2 kg for girls at the mean US height at\nthose ages (Figure 7). The average difference in weight at ages 13\u00ad20 at the mean US heights\nis 6.5 kg among boys and 5.0 kg among girls. The US reference values are based on data\nincluded). They are not depicted here, but they are above the Dutch values particularly after\nage 9. The average difference between US reference values and the Dutch BMI values is 1.4\namong boys and 1.1 among girls between the ages of 11 and 20 even though the Dutch\nvalues have increased since the previous survey in 1980.\nDiscussion\nReference charts are useful insofar as they describe what is `normal' within the population in\nthe sense of being most frequently observed. In contrast, the Dutch reference charts are\nuseful for other populations from the perspective of being an example of `ideal' development\nconducive to a healthier life (Waaler 1984; Cole 2002). From that perspective Dutch\nreference values provide a complementary perspective on the height, BMI values, and\ndevelopment of US children and youth without arguing that the Dutch reference values\nare representative for the US population. This is a similar perspective to that of the\nWorld Health Organization insofar as it uses reference values of height for six healthy,\nwell-nourished populations as an `ideal standard' against which the world's children should\nIt is noteworthy in this regard that the CDC also constructed weight and BMI reference\ncharts in terms of an `ideal normal' and not as a normal in the sense of being most frequently\nobserved. It states: `. . . all charts with weight and BMI exclude data from NHANES III for\nchildren ages 6 years and older. This exclusion was made because of the higher prevalence of\noverweight in this sample as compared with data from previous surveys. NHANES III had\nan unduly high influence on the curves compared with the other surveys' (Ogden et al. 2002;\nOgden et al. 2004). In other words, the CDC did not use the recent values for weight\nbecause these values did not reflect outcomes obtained in a `best practice' environment,\ni.e. included values which reflect the current obesity epidemic and would give a biased view\nof healthy development. Arguably the use of Dutch reference values for height and BMI\nvalues has similar implications. Moreover, the use of Dutch height references gives US\nparents an opportunity to gauge their children's growth relative to a `world standard' in\na similar fashion as the World Health Organization uses reference values from six countries\nas an ideal standard for the world population (Garza and de Onis 2004). The Dutch are the\ntallest in the world today with a relatively low level of obesity and it should be useful for\nparents to know how their children compare not only to the rest of their US peers, but also\nto the world's best practice.\nThere are several obvious differences in the height and weight of US (1999\u00ad2004) and\nDutch (1997) children and adolescents: (a) US children are shorter than Dutch children\nthroughout their growth years although they are born longer. (b) More US girls experience\nthe onset of their adolescent growth spurt at an earlier age than Dutch girls: the latter lag the\nformer by about a year, but Dutch girls grow for a longer period of time during adolescence.\nThe rate of growth of Dutch girls exceeds that of their US counterparts between the ages of\n11 and 16. At age 11 years US girls are within 1 cm of their Dutch counterparts and boys are\nwithin 2 cm but fall behind thereafter (Figure 3). (c) The cross-sectional growth increments\nare quite similar between US and Dutch boys until reaching the peak adolescent growth\nspurt, but thereafter the velocity of growth decelerates at a faster pace among US boys.\nAre Americans shorter (partly) because they are fatter? 601\n(d) As a consequence of these growth patterns both male and female Dutch are more than\n5 cm taller by age 20 than US adults. (e) US children are consistently heavier, but\nparticularly so after age 8. The average difference among adolescents is some 5.0\u00ad6.5 kg.\nUS nationwide longitudinal studies do not exist on the growth velocities to corroborate\nthe cross-sectional ones depicted above, but scattered regional evidence does tend to do so.\nIn a longitudinal sample of six US cities average age of girls at peak growth velocity was 11.5\namong whites and 10.8 among blacks, that is to say, slightly later than one might infer from\nthe cross-sectional evidence above. Among boys in that same sample it was 13.6 among\ncross-sectional estimates presented here. In contrast, among the Dutch adolescents the\nmean age at the (longitudinal) peak height velocity was 12.6 years among girls and 14.0 years\namong boys, that is to say later than among their US counterparts (Kemper et al. 1985).\nAdmittedly, the Kemper et al. study pertains to a small sample and begins at age 12\u00fe so that\nit may not have captured the growth spurt of early maturers. While it is not strong\ncollaborative evidence of the above-described pattern, it is the only one available and hence\nworth mention to the extent that it at least does not contradict the cross-sectional growth\nincrements calculated above. Hence, both cross-sectional and longitudinal samples tend to\nindicate that the tempo of growth is greater in early adolescence among the US population\nthan among the Dutch.\nThe obesity epidemic in the US is clearly linked to the high energy balance of the\npopulation caused by the over-consumption of food coupled with the sedentary lifestyle,\nwhich leads to extraordinary BMI values particularly after age 8 (Figures 6 and 7). Insofar as\ndietary intake, particularly of animal protein, can affect the onset of adolescence (Berkey\net al. 2000), the high pre-puberty calorie intake in the US may well induce an earlier onset of\nthe adolescent growth spurt among females in the US. In turn, the early onset of the\nadolescent growth spurt may affect adult size: `several studies have clearly illustrated the\nBMI gain in childhood was related to an earlier onset of puberty' and a `reduced height gain\nin adolescence . . .' although adult height was not affected in their Swedish sample. Nutrition\nis one of the factors associated with the onset of puberty along with genetic and hormonal\nones: `puberty results from the awakening of a complex neuroendocrine machinery in which\nthe primary mechanism is still unclear . . . the molecular determinants are yet to be identified'\n(Parent et al. 2003). `The pace of pubertal development correlates with the levels of sex\nsteroid hormones during early puberty' (Rogol et al. 2002, p. 196). Overnutrition prior to\nadolescence may affect the hormonal system and may produce too much growth hormone\nprior to puberty so that sex steroids are produced earlier (Karlberg 2002, p. 27). In a\npersonal communication Rogol suggests that estradiol levels might well play a key role in the\nUS growth pattern: `The critical path is that these small but biologically relevant levels of\nestradiol begin to increase GH release and IGF-I levels and lead to the initiation of the\npubertal growth spurt which occurs at a younger age in girls than boys and perhaps more\nimportantly at an earlier stage of puberty in girls. For boys the issue is the same \u00ad it is\nestradiol that leads to the increase in GH and the pubertal growth spurt.' Indeed, the\npositive correlation between estradiol levels and peak growth velocity has been documented:\n`The estrogen level is closely related to testosterone concentration and to the time of peak\ngrowth velocity. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that estrogen at low\nlevels augments skeletal growth and maturation . . . They are also consistent with the\nhypothesis that continued exposure to estrogen leads to epiphyseal fusion' (Klein et al. 1996;\n602 J. Komlos & A. Breitfelder\nThe overload of carbohydrates and fats in a fast-food diet may also be inimical to\nthe consumption of micronutrients essential to growth. While the evidence is admittedly\ncircumstantial, the possibility arises that the high US BMI values may contribute to\nthe higher tempo of growth of the US population and also to the shorter adult heights.\nWhile such findings have not been consistently reported (Koziel 2001) this could depend on\nthe degree of obesity in the population as there are possible trigger or threshold effects.\nThere are other indications that adolescence begins earlier in the US. Generally girls\nwith higher BMI values also experience earlier menarche (Juul et al. 2006, p. 252).\nyears among blacks while in the Netherlands it is 13.2 years and in Denmark 13.4 years\n(Fredriks et al. 2000). Breast development was also significantly earlier in the USA than in\nEuropean countries, including the Netherlands (Juul et al. 2006, p. 251). The timing\nof sexual maturation among American boys is also earlier than among Europeans\n(Juul et al. 2006, p. 252). This set of evidence also indicates that adolescence is reached\nearlier in the USA than in the Netherlands.\nConclusions\nUS children and youth are both shorter and heavier than their Dutch counterparts\n(Figures 3 and 6). US adolescent girls tend to experience an earlier growth spurt than do the\nDutch and the velocity of growth of US boys slows down faster after the adolescent growth\nspurt than does that of their Dutch counterparts (Figures 4 and 5). In turn the latter end up\nbeing 5.6 cm taller and their median BMI values are 1.9\u00ad2.0 less than that of US youth\nbetween the ages of 10 and 19 (Figure 6). This implies that US boys of the same height at\nage 19 are 8.8 kg heavier than their Dutch counterparts and girls of age 13 are 7.2 kg heavier\n(Table I and Figure 7).\nResearch on the relationship between BMI and earlier onset of puberty on other\npopulations suggests that the somewhat speculative hypothesis might well be worthwhile to\nconsider, namely that such effects are at work in the US as well. In other words, in addition\nto the US medical system and dietary habits which would affect height directly (Komlos and\nLauderdale 2007), the positive energy balance itself might also lead to a higher tempo of\ngrowth in childhood and an earlier cessation of growth in adolescence. Thus, there might\nwell be a causal association between the high BMI values in the USA and the relatively\nshorter stature of the Americans.\nWe conjecture that US children would be capable of reaching Dutch reference values in\nboth height and BMI values. It is true that the US population is socially more heterogeneous\n\u00ad i.e. has more poverty \u00ad than the Dutch society, which also leads to inadequate medical care\nas well as sub-standard diets which contribute to the height\u00adweight differences of US and\nDutch children and youth (Komlos and Lauderdale 2007). Yet, that Americans could gauge\nthemselves by Dutch standards is supported by the fact that Americans were 6.5 cm taller\nthan the Dutch in the middle of the 19th century (Komlos and Baur 2004). Moreover, the\nWorld Health Organization believes that at least in early childhood `nearly all interethnic\nvariability is probably a result of environment assaults' (Garza and de Onis 2004). Hence,\nwe suggest that Dutch reference values should complement the ones currently in use for\nUS-born non-Hispanic, non-Asian children in order to gauge ideal height and weight in an\ninternational context (Figures 1, 2, 8 and 9).\nCole and Roede (1999) have advocated the use of 1980 Dutch BMI reference values as\na `suitable baseline to monitor international trends in obesity.' These were below the 1997\nAre Americans shorter (partly) because they are fatter? 603\nAge\n50th, 75th, 90th, and 97th percentiles.

Breitfelder\nvalues used here (Fredriks et al. 2000). Moreover, Dutch BMI values are by no means\natypical. They are similar to Danish ones (Juul et al. 2006). US BMI reference values\n(not shown here) are above those of the Dutch and are probably not appropriate to gauge\nhealthy development.\nChildren's biological welfare is clearly important. As a recent UNICEF (2007) report\nstates, `The true measure of a nation's standing is how well it attends to its children \u00ad their\nhealth and safety, their material security, their education and socialization, and their sense of\nbeing loved, valued, and included in the families and societies into which they are born.'\nAccording to an index of well-being calculated by UNICEF on the basis of 40 variables\nDutch children came out on top followed by the Swedes and Danes (UNICEF 2007).\nFurthermore, the US was near the bottom of the list of 21 countries examined. That the US\nhas almost twice the rate of infant mortality and has the lowest life expectancy compared to\nWestern European countries are other indications that health of US children is below that of\nWestern European levels (WHO 2007). A recent report found that `compared with five\nother nations . . . the US ranks last or next-to-last on five dimensions of a high performance\nhealth system: quality, access, efficiency, equity, and healthy lives' (Davis et al. 2007). These\nbiological outcomes correlate with the evidence on heights and weights. Thus, more\nattention needs to be paid to these anthropometric markers insofar as they reflect health in\ngeneral and conditions in childhood and youth have a long reach into adulthood.\n"
