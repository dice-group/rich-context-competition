Such networks--in which individuals\nknow and interact with each other frequently--make it eas-\nier to pool resources and coordinate caregiving duties when\nnecessary (Ashida & Heaney, 2008; Haines, Hurlbert, &\nBeggs, 1996; Kelley-Moore, Schumacher, Kahana, & Kahana,\n2006). Those who have network members who know each\nother have more access to social support, companionship,\nand emotional aid (Haines & Hurlbert, 1992). And embed-\ndedness in a dense network yields \"social capital\" which\nincreases network members' capacities to monitor and\nshare information about a person (Coleman, 1988).\nA key motivation behind this paper is the idea that these\naspects of dense social networks may not always benefit or\nappeal to older adults. Although dense networks are often\nbeneficial, they can present obstacles to privacy and auton-\nomy. They facilitate higher levels of monitoring by one's\nnetwork members, more stringent enforcement of norms,\nand greater pressure toward group conformity (Coleman,\npressive for the same reasons that they are effective at deliv-\nering support (Fischer, 1982). This side of social capital\nmay be more evident to older adults, whose networks tend\nto be relatively dense (Adams, 1987; Cornwell, Laumann,\nAs such, it might be important for older adults to main-\ntain some bridging potential in their networks--that is, ties\nto people who are otherwise poorly connected to each other.\nFor example, if Brenda talks to both Anne and Carroll fre-\nquently, but Anne does not know Carroll, then Brenda is a\nbridge between them. Chances are thatAnne and Carroll are\nin separate networks that do not overlap much. This gives\nrise to a different class of network structural benefits. For\none, it gives Brenda access to more diverse pools of resources\nthat may be suited to different purposes and activated under\nWellman & Wortley, 1990). Furthermore, Anne and Carroll\nmay constitute alternatives to each other, which bolsters\nBrenda's exchange power and insulates her from depen-\ndence on either one of the pair (Emerson, 1962). In some\ncircumstances, serving as a bridge between others can also\nyield brokerage potential or the ability to transfer resources\nbetween two parties (Burt, 1992; Gould & Fernandez,\nThis is an important issue in later life, as many older\nadults place a high value on independence--especially\nwhen faced with the prospect of being dependent on others\nfor support (Cohler, 1983; Silverstein, Chen, & Heller,\n1996). Evidence that older adults value independence is\navailable in research which demonstrates that being depen-\ndent on or receiving excessive support often leads to emo-\ntional distress, feelings of vulnerability, decreased self\nIndependence Through Social Networks: Bridging\nPotential Among Older Women and Men\nBenjamin Cornwell\nDepartment of Sociology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.\nObjectives. Most studies of older adults' social networks focus on their access to dense networks that yield access to\nsocial support. This paper documents gender differences in the extent to which older adults maintain a related, but dis-\ntinct, form of social capital--bridging potential, which involves serving as a tie between two unconnected parties and thus\nboosts independence and control of everyday social life.\nby the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project--to compare older men's and women's network bridging potential\nusing multivariate regression analysis.\nResults. Older women are more likely than older men to have bridging potential in their networks--between both kin\nand non-kin contacts. These gender differences increase with age. Older women are also more likely to have network\nmembers who are not connected to or monopolized by their spouse or partner. Some, but not all, of these gender differ-\nences are due to the fact that older women have larger social networks and maintain more ties to people outside of the\nhousehold.\nDiscussion. These findings raise important questions about the relational advantages older women have over older\nmen, including greater autonomy, and contradict stereotypes about women having more closely knit, kin-centered net-\nworks than men.\nKey Words: Aging--Gender--Social networks--Social capital--Marriage.\nesteem, and a feeling of being coerced (Coyne, Wortman, &\nStephens, Druley, & Wojno, 2002; Vinokur & Vinokur,\n1990). This represents a key tension in many older adults'\nsocial lives: Older adults cherish and benefit from their con-\nnections to tight-knit groups (e.g., their families), but they\nalso value autonomy. The work that has been done on this\nissue finds that network density increases (and bridging\npotential decreases) with age and that this is partly due to\nlater life-course experiences (Adams, 1987; Cornwell,\nbridging potential and still be embedded in a dense network\n(Burt, 2005). Unfortunately, we know relatively little about\nthe factors that affect older adults' bridging opportunities.\nGendered Social Resources\nThe concern over bridging potential in social networks\nmaps onto larger concerns regarding gendered access to\nindependence and power. Some scholars point to gender\ndifferences in network composition to explain men's more\nrapid advancement in the workplace, labor market out-\ncomes, and entrepreneurial success (e.g., Renzulli,Aldrich, &\nadults, bridging in social networks also has implications for\ngendered independence. A classic hypothesis holds that\ntight-knit, kin-centered networks serve to maintain more\nrigid, gender-segregated conjugal roles in which men are\ndominant within the household (Bott, 1957). This is partly\nbecause dense networks facilitate monitoring and thereby\nhelp to enforce strict adherence to local social norms (see\nThe dominant perception is that women have less bridg-\ning potential in their networks than men.Although women's\nnetworks are usually larger than men's, some work shows\nthat women maintain more strong, kin-based connections\nthat are less conducive to bridging than men's weaker\ninstrumental ties (see McLaughlin, Vagenas, Pachana,\nBegum, & Dobson, 2010; McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &\ngender differences in network structure that are evident\namong young and middle-aged adults persist in later life.\nResearch does find that older women have larger networks\nthan older men--which would increase women's bridging\npotential--but the evidence regarding gender differences\nin network composition is mixed (Ajrouch, Blandon, &\nBeyond this, men and women have different life-course\nexperiences, which could have major implications for gen-\nder differences in bridging potential in later life. For one,\nolder men are more likely to experience retirement, so they\nare more likely to experience a sudden drop in their access\nto weak and non-kin ties (e.g., Mor-Barak, Scharlach, Birba,\n& Sokolov, 1992). Beyond this, bridging is dependent on\nfunctional and cognitive health and is often compromised\nwhen one's network members increase communication and\ncoordination with each other to provide social support for\nClose friends and family members in particular often\n\"tighten\" an infirm person's network by rallying around and\ncoordinating caregiving duties (Stoller & Pugliesi, 1991).\nAnd because older men are more likely to (be able to) rely\non their partners for caregiver support than are older women\n(Antonucci & Akiyama, 1987; Schwarzer & Guti\u00e9rrez-\nDo\u00f1a, 2005), older men may face more constraints on\nbridging potential than older women.\nFinally, socioemotional selectivity theory holds that\npeople become increasingly oriented to strong, emotionally\nrewarding relationships as they age (Charles & Carstensen,\n2010), which leads to the loss of weaker (especially non-\nkin) contacts. This increased selectivity appears to be more\npronounced among men than women (Shaw, Krause, Liang, &\nBennett, 2007). Gendered life-course perspectives explain\nthat men adopt a more emotional approach to relationships\nas they age, focusing less on instrumental ties that facilitate\nindividual accomplishments and more on ties that provide\nemotional fulfillment (Adams & Ueno, 2006). The realities\nand challenges of later life--including retirement and health\ndecline--make traditionally masculine priorities on power\nand autonomy less appealing and more difficult to sustain.\nFurthermore, old age elicits more nurturance from men,\nwhich yields closer relationships with family (Mann, 2007;\nRibeiro, Pa\u00fal, & Nogueira, 2007). These ideas yield two\nrelated hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1a Older women have more potential to bridge\nbetween contacts--including non-kin--within their social\nnetworks than older men.\nHypothesis 1b Gender differences in bridging potential\nincrease with age.\nIndependence from Intimate Partners\nA key condition on many individuals' abilities to exercise\ninfluence and maintain independence in their everyday lives\nis their involvement in an intimate relationship. Partners in\nlong-term intimate relationships usually share joint con-\ntacts, which can help them forge stronger, more committed\npartnerships (e.g., see Kalmijn & Bernasco, 2001; Stein,\nBush, Ross, & Ward, 1992). Some scholars have shown that\nbecause of their extensive access to each other's network\ncontacts, partners inadvertently constrain each other's\nshare in more of each other's social experiences, they\nbecome more integrated in each other's networks as time\nincreasing overlap is attributable to later life experiences\nlike retirement and health problems that require partners\nto play a greater role in each other's lives. A recent study\nCORNWELL\n(Cornwell & Laumann, 2011) suggested that this can be so\nbothersome to some older men that it reduces their satisfac-\ntion with their partners and can lead to sexual problems in\ntheir relationships. Unfortunately, little is known about the\nextent to which older adults' partners \"constrain\" their\nbridging potential or whether such constraint is experienced\ndifferently by men and women. But the existing work on\njoint partner networks suggests the following:\nHypothesis 2 Having a spouse or partner reduces both\nmen's and women's bridging potential in later life.\nSeparation, divorce, and widowhood imply the loss of the\none social contact who is the most highly embedded within\none's network and poses the greatest (inadvertent) con-\nis important to acknowledge that the loss of one's spouse\nincreases loneliness and sense of isolation in older adults\n(e.g., Pa\u00fal & Ribeiro, 2009), but it is also crucial to recog-\nnize that such losses are an important part of the process\nthrough which many older adults' networks are trans-\nformed. Because women are more likely than men to\nbecome widowed (Waite & Das, 2010), this will increase\nwomen's bridging potential relative to men, not only\nbecause they are automatically left with fewer strong ties\nin their networks but also because widowhood tends to\nincrease community involvement and thus increases access to\nweak ties (see Cornwell et al., 2008; Donnelly & Hinterlong,\ncould also exacerbate gender differences in bridging poten-\ntial in later life.\nIn addition, there are several reasons to expect that older\nwomen are more likely than older men to maintain connec-\ntions to people to whom their spouses are not well con-\nnected. Social network research shows that, in general,\nwomen are more likely than men to have such people in\noffer one explanation for this, arguing that women's expec-\ntations of being embedded in their spouses' networks increase\nover time, whereas men are less likely to seek involvement\nin their spouses' external network ties. This effectively\npreserves women's independent network contacts. Fur-\nthermore, this gender difference in partner-independent ties\nmay increase with age. As discussed earlier, older men's\nweaker contacts are more likely than older women's to be\nlost to retirement or abandoned due to increasing prefer-\nences for emotionally fulfilling relationships (Shaw et al.,\n2007). For these reasons, I expect that:\nHypothesis 3 Older women are more likely to maintain ties\nthat are independent of their spouse/partner than older men.\nTo recap, positions within social networks that yield\nbridging potential can provide older adults with opportuni-\nties to exercise informal forms of power and independence.\nBut the experiences of later life may reduce some individ-\nuals' bridging potential. Older men are especially likely\nto experience life-course transitions that reduce bridging\npotential, especially retirement, health problems, and\nheightened socioemotional selectivity. Given the potential\nrelevance of this issue to older adults, I examine the struc-\nture of older adults' social networks using recent nationally\nrepresentative data.\nData and Methods\nI conduct my analysis using network data collected by\nthe National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP)\ntive sample of 3,005 community-dwelling adults between\nthe ages of 57\u00ad85. Interviews were conducted in respon-\ndents' homes by the National Opinion Research Center.\nNSHAP used a multistage area probability design that overs-\nampled by race and ethnicity, age, and gender. The final\nSocial Network Data\nNSHAP collected information about older adults' confi-\ndant networks. To develop the network data, NSHAP inter-\nviewers began by asking respondents the following:\nFrom time to time, most people discuss things that are\nimportant to them with others. For example, these may\ninclude good or bad things that happen to you, problems\nyou are having, or important concerns you may have. Looking\nback over the last 12 months, who are the people with whom\nyou most often discussed things that were important to you?\nRespondents could name up to five people, who were\nrecorded in Roster A. (In network research, the respondent\nis often referred to as \"ego,\" so self-reported network data\nsuch as this is often referred to as \"egocentric\" network\ndata.) Respondents were asked to describe the nature of\ntheir relationship to each network member (e.g., friend). If,\nafter these five network members (referred to as \"alters\")\nwere enumerated respondents had not yet named a partner,\nthey were asked if they had one. If so, the partner was\nrecorded in a Roster B. (I include a control in all models for\nwhether the respondent failed to list their partner in the\ninitial confidant roster.) Respondents were also asked if\nthere was any other person to whom they are especially\nclose. If so, this person was added in Roster C. Respondents\nreported both how often they interact with each of their\nnetwork members and how often each network member\n(including the spouse/partner) interacts with each of the\nother network members. This information is collected from\nall respondents, regardless of the respondent's age or other\ncharacteristics.\nNetwork Bridging Potential\nI use the data provided by respondents regarding their\nties to network members as well as their reports of how\nthese network members are connected to each other to mea-\nsure respondents' bridging potential within their networks.\nBridging potential refers to the extent to which an individual\nis tied to people who are not directly (or who are only\npoorly) connected to each other (Burt, 1992). The \"important\nthings\" question above elicits names of strong, frequently\naccessed, long-term contacts (Marin, 2004; Marsden,\n1987)--ties through which normative pressures and social\ninfluence are likely to operate and which are thought to be\nparticularly important to older adults. Therefore, overall\nbridging potential may be underestimated by these data.\nThere is no universally accepted measure of bridging\npotential. In his foundational work, Burt (1992) proposed a\ntechnical measure of bridging that he called \"effective size,\"\nwhich is the number of social contacts a person has, adjusted\ndownward to the extent that those network members are also\ntied to each other. Borgatti (1997) showed that this measure is\nequivalent to network density, scaled by a factor of k - 1,\nwhere k is the number of alters named by the respondent. I am\nmainly interested in individuals' capacities to connect people.\nTherefore, I simplify matters by measuring bridging potential\nas the number of pairs of alters in a respondent's network\nwho are not directly connected to each other. My first mea-\nsure of bridging therefore captures a respondent's overall op-\nportunity to serve as an intermediary between unconnected\nparties. This measure is distinct from Burt's (1992) measure\nof effective size because it does not take into account the\nextent to which the respondent is the only network member\nwho has access to unconnected pairs of alters within the\nnetwork. However, it does correlate with Burt's measure at\nr = .87, which yields similar results when used as the depen-\ndent variable in the multivariate regression analysis (see\nTable A2). Hypothesis 1a suggests that older women have\nmore overall bridging potential than older men and asserts\nthat this holds for non-kin ties as well. Therefore, I also\ncalculate a parallel count of the number of unconnected\nalter-pairs that involve at least one non-kin contact.\nPartner-related bridging.--I employ two additional mea-\nsures that are intended to capture respondents' autonomy\nfrom the spouse or partner. One can maintain independence\nfrom one's partner by having contacts who are not connect-\ned to that partner. One dichotomous measure of this is\nwhether a respondent has at least one confidant with whom\none's partner has little contact (only once or twice a year, or\nless often), which I refer to as a partner-independent tie.\nPerhaps the greatest threats to autonomy are instances in\nwhich one's partner has greater contact with one's confi-\ndants than oneself has. A final measure of bridging poten-\ntial, then, is a dichotomous indicator of whether the\nrespondent has more contact with all of his or her other\nconfidants than his or her partner does--that is, whether\nthe respondent's network is free of partner betweenness\n(Cornwell & Laumann, 2011). This allows respondents to\nretain control over resources to which their partners do not\nhave as much access. Although these last two indicators of\nbridging potential are significantly associated with each\n(r = .12), suggesting that they tap different but related\ndimensions of bridging. These and other key variables in\nthe analysis are described in Table A1.\nTo clarify the distinction between overall and partner-\nrelated bridging potential, Figure 1 illustrates three hypo-\nthetical networks as derived from an individual's (\"ego's\")\nreports of whom she/he is connected to and how those peo-\nple (\"alters\") are connected to each other. Each network\nrepresents a case where ego has a spouse and four other\nnetwork members. In the left panel, all of ego's network\nmembers are connected to each other. This network does\nnot afford ego any bridging potential. There are 10 possible\nconnections among the alters, and they are all realized (i.e.,\n0 out of 10 alter-pairs are unconnected). Ego's spouse is\nconnected to each of the four other alters as well, so ego has\nno partner-related bridging potential. In the center network\ndiagram, ego has considerable overall bridging potential, as\n6 of the 10 possible alter-pairs are unconnected. On the\nother hand, ego's spouse is equally connected to the other\nfour alters, so ego has no partner-related bridging potential\nin that case. In the right-most diagram, ego's bridging\npotential is maximized. None of ego's network members\nare connected to each other, including ego's spouse, thus\nyielding overall and partner-related bridging potential.\nAnalysis\nI begin by examining bivariate differences in bridging by\ngender. I then use multivariate regression analysis to predict\neach of the bridging measures using a variety of covariates.\nThe first set of models for each outcome includes gender as\nwell as race and education as sociodemographic controls.\nI am mainly interested in factors that help explain any gender\ndifferences in bridging potential. One possibility is that gen-\nder differences emerge as a result of men's and women's dif-\nferent life-course experiences. The second model for each\noutcome thus includes: (a) whether the respondent is sepa-\nrated/divorced with no current partner, whether she/he is wid-\nowed with no partner, and whether she/he has never been\nmarried--with \"has a current spouse/partner\" as the reference\ncategory. (When predicting the measures of partner-specific\nbridging potential, I instead use a single indicator of whether\nthe respondent is married to the partner.); (b) employment\nFigure 1. Three hypothetical egocentric networks that have different impli-\ncations for ego's overall and partner-related bridging potential.\nNote. The empty circle in the middle of each network represents the focal\nindividual (\"ego\"), black circles represent network members (\"alters\"), and\nlines are drawn where a relationship exists.\nCORNWELL\nstatus (i.e., retired); and (c) functional health and cognitive\nfunction. Functional health is measured using an index of\nnine questions about respondents' difficulty with activities\nof daily living, such as: \"How much difficulty do you have\nbathing or showering?\" I reverse-code and standardize\nthese responses, then average them together to create a\nfunctional health index (a = .86). Positive values indicate\nbetter function. Cognitive function is measured using the\nShort Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, which in-\ncludes ten questions like \"What day of the week is it?\" It is\nscored as the number of items answered correctly (Pfeiffer,\nThe third model for each outcome rotates out the life-\ncourse measures and enters measures of network structure.\nFactors that may affect bridging potential include: (a) close-\nness to network members because strong ties with alters\nincrease the likelihood that alters will be acquainted\n(Granovetter, 1973); (b) proportion of alters who are kin; (c)\nproportion of alters who live in R's household; and (d) net-\nwork size, which is included as a series of dummy variables\nthat represent different-sized networks (to allow for nonlin-\near associations between network size and bridging, which\nare evident in the data). This step is useful in determining\nwhether any gender differences in bridging result from the\ntypes of networks men and women have (Moore, 1990).\nA final model for each outcome includes both the life-\ncourse and network structure variables together.\nThe two measures of partner-related bridging potential\nare dichotomous indicators, so logistic regression is appro-\npriate in those cases (Cox & Snell, 1989). The measure of\noverall bridging potential--the count of the number of pairs\nof unconnected alter-pairs--and the measure of bridging\ninvolving non-kin contacts are predicted using negative\nbinomial regression. Negative binomial models are like\nPoisson models in that they predict counts, but negative\nbinomial models also include a parameter, s2, that accounts\nfor overdispersion (high variation) in the dependent variable\n(McCullagh & Nelder, 1989). I also take into account the fact\nthat some respondents have more bridging potential merely\nby virtue of the fact that they have larger networks. In net-\nworks like those collected by NSHAP, there are ( 1)\nk k -\npossible pairs of alters, where k is the number of network\nmembers. When predicting the counts of unconnected alter-\npairs, I include a count of the total number of possible\nunconnected alter-pairs as an \"exposure\" variable. This is\nan additional parameter by which the dependent variable is\ndivided, thus expressing it not as a count but as a rate or\nproportion. This means that the negative binomial model\nexpresses the coefficient for a given predictor in terms of its\nassociation, not with the number but with the prevalence of\nunconnected pairs of alters within one's network.\nAll models include person-level weights to account for\ndifferential probabilities of selection, as well as poststratifi-\ncation adjustments for nonresponse by age and urbanicity.\nAnalyses are conducted using Stata's survey (\"svy\") com-\nmands that, in addition to weighting, incorporate the clus-\nters and strata of NSHAP's sample design and employ\nTaylor linearized variance estimation.\nSelection Issues\nThe regression analyses pertain only to respondents who\nhave at least two network members. Analysis of the partner-\nrelated bridging measures is further restricted to those who\nhave a spouse/partner, yielding a sample of 1,889 for these\nanalyses. To adjust for selection that could result from these\nrestrictions, I first create a set of dichotomous measures that\nindicate whether a given respondent is present in a given\nmodel (e.g., the model predicting the presence of a partner-\nindependent tie). Next, I predict this indicator using a logis-\ntic regression model that includes gender, age, race,\neducation, marital status (except for models pertaining only\nto those with a partner), retirement, whether the respondent\nhas offspring, household size, and health as predictors.\nI then take the inverse of the predicted probability that is\nderived from this model (i.e., the probability that the\nrespondent did not make it into the presented models), mul-\ntiply it by the supplied NSHAP survey weight for that\nrespondent, and use the product as the person-weight in the\nsubsequent models predicting that particular bridging mea-\nsure (see Cornwell & Laumann, 2011; Morgan & Todd,\n2008). This procedure effectively gives greater weight to\ncases that were less likely to be included in the models, thus\nattenuating any potential selection effects that were intro-\nduced as a result of missing data or other sample restrictions.\nResults\nI begin by analyzing older adults' overall bridging poten-\ntial. The first measure of bridging potential is the total num-\nber of pairs of network members who are not connected to\neach other. On average, respondents report that 23.1% of\ntheir network members are not connected to each other,\nyielding an average of 2.35 unconnected pairs of network\nmembers per respondent.\nBivariate associations between gender and measures of\nbridging potential (Table 1) provide preliminary evidence\nthat older men's and women's networks are structurally dif-\nferent in ways that yield greater bridging potential for\nwomen. For one, women's networks are larger than men's.\nOlder women's networks are no more kin-centered than\nolder men's networks are. Women also have significantly\nfewer coresident network members. These particular trends\nare favorable to women's bridging prospects. Indeed, the\nnumber of unconnected pairs of network members is greater\nin women's networks (2.70 unconnected pairs) than in\nTable 2 presents results from negative binomial regres-\nsion analyses predicting overall bridging potential. Based\non the initial model in Table 2, older women have about\n51.5% more unconnected pairs of network members than\nmen, providing initial support for hypothesis 1a. This esti-\nmate is marginally smaller in the second model (F = 3.60,\np < .07), providing some evidence that a portion of older\nwomen's bridging potential derives from their life-course\nexperiences. For example, the older women in this sample\nare much less likely to be married than the older men (56.0%\nvs. 78.3%, respectively), lifting what is usually a\nmajor constraint on married individuals' bridging potential.\nA greater reduction in the gender coefficient (F = 31.08,\np < .001) occurs when network structural measures are con-\nsidered (model 3). People who are closer to their network\nmembers, whose networks are comprised of more kin\nand/or coresidents, and whose networks are larger tend to\nhave more bridging potential. The reduction in the gender\ncoefficient between models 1 and 3 is most closely tied to\nthe influence of network size and the presence of coresident\nalters. If I only include network size in model 3, the inci-\ndence rate ratio associated with gender is cut in half, from\nhave larger networks than men, which increases bridging\npotential automatically. Likewise, if I only include the pres-\nence of coresident network members in model 3, the inci-\ndence rate ratio associated with gender is cut from 1.44 to\nfewer of their network members from the household, which\ninevitably means that they have fewer network members\nwho see each other every day. In the end, when all variables\nare considered together (model 4), we find that older women\nhave 15.9% more bridging opportunities than older men.\nTable 1.

All models are survey\nadjusted. Models also control for race/ethnicity, education, and whether the respondent forgot to include the partner in the initial list of confidants.\nCORNWELL\nNot only do older women have more bridging potential\nbut also that potential extends beyond their family ties. As\nshown in Figure 2, although 50.1% of older women serve as\na bridge between kin and non-kin ties, only 37.6% of men\nthan older men to serve as a link between two non-kin con-\nmodel of Table 3 shows that older women have 53.8% more\nopportunities than older men to serve as a bridge between\npairs of alters in which at least one is a non-kin contact\n(providing further support for hypothesis 1a). Once all the\nlife-course and network structural determinants of bridging\nare included (model 4), we see that older women have\n18.6% more opportunities than men to serve as a bridge that\ninvolves non-kin contacts. As above, when I include net-\nwork size and the prevalence of coresident network mem-\nbers separately in model 3, I find that older women's\nbridging potential advantage derives especially from their\npropensity to be connected to non-coresidents (F = 85.06,\nIt is worth noting before I move onto tests of the other\nhypotheses that older women's greater bridging potential\ndoes not come to them at the cost of their having less access\nto other forms of social capital. For example, older women\nare just as likely as older men to have network members\nFigure 2. Percent of respondents who serve as bridges between different kinds of confidants, by gender.\nTable 3.

About 77.0% of older\nmen and 79.0% of older women have at least one pair of\nnetwork members who interact with each other on at least a\nweekly basis (F = 1.77, p = .19). Broken down by dyad\ntype, older women are actually more likely than older men\nto have at least two family members in their networks who\nrespectively; F = 6.57, p = .014). In this sense, older women\nhave the best of both worlds--bridging potential as well as\naccess to robust social capital.\nGender Interaction\nI also explore whether age conditions the association\nbetween gender and bridging potential. Hypothesis 1b\nstates that gender differences in bridging potential increase\nwith age. The final model of Table 2 includes an interaction\nbetween age and gender. The interaction is significant and\npositive. Interactions can be difficult to interpret, so I dis-\nplay the nature of this conditional relationship in Figure 3.\nAs shown in the figure, the gender difference in overall\nbridging potential is greatest among the oldest adults in the\nsample, with a slight upward trend for women by age and a\nslight downward trend for men.

There is also an interaction between gender and age in\nthe analysis of non-kin bridging potential (see the final\nmodel of Table 3), suggesting that gender differences in the\npotential to serve as a bridge between a non-kin contact and\nany other type of contact are greater in later life. These\nresults support hypothesis 1b.\nBridging and Intimate Partners\nI now consider the difference in bridging potential be-\ntween those who have a spouse/partner and those who\ndo not. First, the data show that an average of 20.6% of\npartnered respondents' alter-pairs are unconnected, com-\npared to 30.5% of non-partnered respondents' alter-pairs\nthan non-partners to be connected to the rest of one's network.\nFor example, the spouses/partners of partnered respondents\nknow an average of 92.5% of the other network members\nin those respondents' networks. The non-partner contacts of\nrespondents who have a spouse/partner know an average of\n76.8% of those respondents' other network members (unad-\namong partnered older adults, only 9.9% have a network\nmember who is not connected to anyone in the confidant net-\nwork aside from the respondent, compared with 30.5% among\nvides preliminary evidence that the presence of a partner\nconstrains bridging potential.\nModel 2 in Table 2 confirms that older adults who have a\nspouse or partner have less bridging potential than others\n(hypothesis 2). In particular, those who are separated/\ndivorced or who never married and do not have a current\npartner have significantly more bridging potential in their\nnetworks than those who are married or have a coresident\npartner. Model 2 in Table 3 shows that the same is true with\nrespect to bridging that involves non-kin contacts (also see\nTable A2). But the association between partner status and\nbridging potential is tied up with other aspects of network\nstructure. The fourth model in Table 2, for example, shows\nthat having a spouse or partner is not significantly associ-\nated with bridging potential once network structure is taken\ninto account. This suggests that individuals who are part-\nnered have less bridging potential in part because they have\ndifferent kinds of networks (e.g., more kin-centered) than\nindividuals who are not partnered.\nPartner-Independent Ties\nFinally, I turn to the analysis of partner-related bridging\npotential. Table 4 presents results from multivariate logistic\nregression analyses predicting whether partnered respon-\ndents have at least one network member to whom the part-\nner is not connected.About 42% of these respondents report\nhaving at least one such confidant. From model 1, older\nwomen are 21.7% more likely than older men to maintain\nsuch a contact, but this is not statistically significant. How-\never, it is necessary to control for health and life-course\nexperiences because they are related to both gender and\nnetwork structure. When I do this, the gender association\nbecomes significant (model 2), revealing that women are\n36.0% more likely than men to have an external network\nmember who is not in contact with the partner. This result\nholds when network structure is taken into account (model 4).\nThe increase in the gender estimate when life-course factors\nare taken into account is significant (F = 8.43, p < .01). It\nturns out that health is the main factor at work here. Older\nwomen have more functional health difficulties, which can\nPredicted Number of Bridging Ties\nAge\nWomen\nMen\nFigure 3.

This difference increases\nwith the inclusion of life-course and network structural\nmeasures. Model 3 demonstrates the particular importance\nof network size. The more confidants one has, the greater\nthe likelihood one's partner can monopolize contact with at\nleast one of them. In fact, the advantage older women pos-\nsess with respect to this partner-related form of bridging\npotential gets a significant boost--from an odds ratio of\nTable 4.

Older women are 2.8 times as likely as older men to\nmonopolize access to all their confidant relations. In combi-\nnation with the results from Table 4, these analyses provide\nstrong support for hypothesis 3 (that older women are more\nlikely to maintain ties that are independent of their spouse/\npartner than older men).\nNote that gender differences in access to partner-\nindependent network members are not conditional on age in\nthe same way that overall bridging potential is. The interac-\ntion between gender and age is not significant, in the final\nmodels in Tables 4 and 5. This tempers support for hypoth-\nesis 1b by showing that it is restricted to overall bridging\npotential.\nDiscussion\nThis study was motivated by the idea that bridging posi-\ntions in social networks provide older adults with opportu-\nnities to exercise autonomy and give them more control\nover their everyday social lives. Contrary to conventional\nwisdom, which suggests that women's networks are more\nkin-centered and communal than men's (see Ridgeway &\nSmith-Lovin, 1999), this study finds that older women have\nsignificantly more bridging potential in their networks. This\nholds for different types of ties, including those involving\nnon-kin contacts.\nThis gender difference is partly, but not entirely, attribut-\nable to the fact that older women have larger networks and\nmore ties to non-coresident confidants. And although com-\nmon later life experiences like retirement, widowhood, and\nhealth problems are generally negatively related to bridging\npotential, there is only modest evidence that older women's\nbridging advantage relative to men stems from gender dif-\nferences in the prevalence of these experiences. Indeed,\nolder men are more likely to be partnered (Waite & Das,\n2010), and because one's intimate partner is usually closely\ntied to one's other confidants (Kalmijn, 2003), this reduces\nolder men's bridging potential. But these life-course factors\nstill do not fully explain gender differences in bridging po-\ntential, nor do they explain why women's bridging advantage\nrelative to men increases with age.\nSeveral unmeasured factors may help to explain these\ndifferences. Perhaps most relevant to older adults, socio-\nemotional selectivity theory argues that people become in-\ncreasingly oriented to strong, emotionally rewarding\nrelationships as they age (Charles & Carstensen, 2010). If\npreferences for more emotionally close ties are acted upon,\nthis could lead to a disproportionate loss or abandonment of\nweak ties (see Ikkink & van Tilburg, 1999; Shaw et al.,\ning potential (Granovetter, 1973). And researchers have\nfound that this increased selectivity is more pronounced\nchange could reflect shifts in perceptions of masculinity\nthat often occur in later life, which compel men to adopt\nmore nurturing roles and to derive influence from the oppor-\ntunity to convey wisdom and experience (Mann, 2007).\nMore research is needed to determine whether this psycho-\nlogical shift contributes to men's decreasing bridging\nadvantage relative to women in later life.\nWhatever its cause, the gender difference in bridging\npotential is important because it reveals that women have a\nstructural advantage that is known to have instrumental\nvalue in some contexts (e.g., Burt, 1992; Gould & Fernandez,\n1989). However, more work is needed to understand the\nconsequences of bridging in personal networks for older\nadults. A motivating assumption of this paper is that bridg-\ning increases older adults' capacities to be independent and\naffords them some relational power and control in their\neveryday lives (e.g., Burt, 2005). If this is true, bridging\nmay have a positive effect on important psychological out-\ncomes like sense of control and self-esteem. It may also be\nprotective against feelings of helplessness and dependency.\nBridging potential that stems from having ties to people\nwho are not well connected to one's spouse or partner, spe-\ncifically, may have unique consequences for older adults'\nintimate partner relationships and for their interactions\nwithin the household. Recent work suggests that, for older\nmen, having network contacts who are too closely linked to\none's spouse can reduce partner satisfaction and lead to\nstrained sexual relations (Cornwell & Laumann, 2011).\nOther work suggested that, for women, maintaining exter-\nnal social contacts helps them to avoid stringent gender role\ndemands within the household (Burt, 1992). Though lim-\nited, this work suggests a provocative direction for under-\nstanding gender relations among older adults that shifts the\nfocus to network structural factors. Along these lines, the\nfact that partners' social networks overlap more as time\ngoes on (Kalmijn, 2003) deserves attention as a possible\nexplanation for shifts in gender roles that occur in later life\n(e.g., Ribeiro, Pa\u00fal, & Nogueira, 2007).\nIt is important to note that while bridging likely contrib-\nutes to older adults' independence, sense of control, and\ngender identity in later life, it is not a viable substitute for\nstrong ties in dense networks. A key issue is the extent to\nwhich older adults can maintain bridging potential while\nalso maintaining connections that yield dependable social\nsupport. It is possible that benefits of bridging are contin-\ngent on individuals' also maintaining other forms of social\ncapital that are associated with being embedded in dense\nnetworks (Coleman, 1988). Along these lines, it is interest-\ning that women are more likely than men to maintain both\nbridging potential and access to the strong types of ties that\nyield social support. Likewise, although partner-related\nbridging can be beneficial in some ways, it is important to\nbear in mind the benefits to partners of cultivating jointly\nshared contacts alongside any separate network ties. Highly\noverlapping social networks are advantageous to couples in\nCORNWELL\nlater life, in part because they increase access to mutual\ncontacts who are invested in both partners, which thereby\nmakes it easier to coordinate social support for one partner\nwhen it is needed (Ashida & Heaney, 2008).\nCollaboration between gender scholars, network re-\nsearchers, and social gerontologists will help shed light on\nthe relational causes and consequences of these forms of\nbridging potential in later life. Of course, future work should\navoid some of the limitations of this study. Longitudinal\ndata may be especially useful by making it possible to take\ninto account the reciprocal effects of network structure on\nhealth factors that may affect bridging potential (Cornwell,\n2009). This will also make it possible to identify some of the\nconsequences of network bridging potential for older adults\n(e.g., sense of control), which are assumed but not demon-\nstrated directly in this paper. Finally, this study cannot say\nanything about the structures of younger or middle-aged\nmen's and women's social networks or how they are shaped\nby earlier life-course experiences (e.g., widowhood in early\nadulthood). Much of the research that has addressed gender\ndifferences in network structure (e.g., Moore, 1990) and the\ntendency for intimate partners' social networks to converge\nover time (e.g., Kalmijn, 2003) has focused on the general\npopulation. It is unclear to what extent the findings reported\nhere apply to younger samples. But by exploring these is-\nsues in greater depth, social gerontologists will at least be\nbetter able to clarify the value of specific structural features\nof social networks to older adults.\nFunding\nSupported by a grant from the National Institutes of Health\n"
