We examined whether A1C was associated with age in\nnondiabetic subjects and in subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) in two population-\nbased cohorts.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We performed cross-sectional analyses of\nA1C across age categories in 2,473 nondiabetic participants of the Framingham Offspring Study\n(FOS) and in 3,270 nondiabetic participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES) 2001\u00ad2004. In FOS, we examined A1C by age in a subset with NGT, i.e.,\nafter excluding those with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance\n(IGT).

The prevalence of diabe-\ntes and impaired glucose homeosta-\nsis (impaired fasting glucose [IFG] and\nimpaired glucose tolerance [IGT]) is in-\ncreased among older individuals (1). Given\nthe large size of the elderly type 2 diabetic\npopulation (approximately 15.3% diag-\nnosed and 6.9% undiagnosed) (2), it is im-\nportant to consider the effects of aging on\nglycemic measures, particularly as targets\nare set for diabetes management.\nA1C levels are used globally as an in-\ndex of average glycemia over the preced-\ning 8\u00ad12 weeks (3), as a marker for risk of\ndevelopment of diabetes complications,\nand to guide therapy (4). Some reports\nhave demonstrated an association of A1C\nwith age (5\u00ad13), whereas others have not\nvanced age may be a function of a higher\nprevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in\nolder individuals. The nondiabetic range\nfor A1C, used worldwide and for all age-\ngroups, was established by the Diabetes\nControl and Complications Trial (DCCT)\nyears was drawn from local DCCT clinics\nto generate the A1C distribution. The vol-\nunteers did not have an oral glucose\ntolerance test (OGTT) to exclude undiag-\nnosed diabetes and were not representa-\ntive of individuals aged 40 years.\nCurrent A1C targets for diabetes\ntreatment set by the American Diabetes\nAmerican College of Endocrinology (A1C\ncentral role played by A1C in the manage-\nment of diabetes (4) and possibly in its\ndiagnosis (21) raises the question of\nwhether there are age-related differences\nin A1C.

Finally, in a subset of FOS par-\nticipants with longitudinal A1C data, we\ndetermined the annual rate of change in\nA1C as an alternate approach to test the\nhypothesis that A1C increases with age.\nMETHODS -- The FOS, a communi-\nty-based population study in Framing-\nham, Massachusetts, was described\npreviously (24). This predominantly\nwhite population has been studied every\nare obtained, and clinical examinations\nare performed.\nNHANES is a national population-\nbased study based on household sam-\npling with oversampling for minority\nused for this analysis. Detailed descrip-\ntions of the sample design, interviewing\nprocedures, and physical examinations\nWe performed a cross-sectional anal-\npants (aged 25 years) who attended\ntheir fifth examination between January\nfasting glucose and A1C were measured\nand a 75-g OGTT was performed. FOS\nsubjects with diabetes, determined on the\nbasis of previous treatment with antidia-\nbetic medications or fasting plasma glu-\ncose (FPG) 126 mg/dl, were excluded.\nThe nondiabetic cohort was classified as\nhaving IFG if FPG was between 100 and\npants with NGT had FPG 100 mg/dl\nFifty-nine subjects who had missing 2-h\npostload blood glucose measurements\nwere excluded from the NGT analyses.\nwe limited our eligible study population\nwho did not have diagnosed diabetes and\nhad an FPG 126 mg/dl (OGTT was not\nperformed). Two individuals were not in-\ncluded because they did not have an A1C\ntest available. Diagnosed diabetes was de-\nfined as a self-reported history of diabetes.\nAmerican Diabetes Association diagnostic\ncriteria were used to categorize individu-\nals with previously undiagnosed diabetes\nLaboratory measurements\nA1C was measured in FOS and NHANES\nstudy subjects using high-performance\nliquid chromatography (HPLC) assays\nstandardized to DCCT values by the Na-\ntional Glycohemoglobin Standardization\nProgram (27). The A1C assays used in\nboth studies have inter- and intra-assay\ncoefficients of variation (CVs) 3%. As-\nsay drift in the HPLC method used in FOS\nis prevented by the use of long-term\nstored reference samples. In NHANES,\nthe boronate affinity HPLC method was\nused.\nPlasma glucose levels were measured\nwith a hexokinase reagent kit (A-gent glu-\ncose test, Abbott Laboratories, South Pas-\nadena, CA) in FOS and with a hexokinase\nassay in NHANES (COBAS MIRA Chem-\nistry System; Roche Diagnostic Systems,\nMontclair, NJ). The intra-assay CV was\n3% for both assays.\nStatistical analysis\nFramingham offspring study. We cat-\negorized age into groups of 5 years (i.e.,\nage-groups collapsed for adequate sample\nsize in the youngest and oldest bins. A1C\nlevels were analyzed by age and by sex.\nDifferences in mean A1C by age-group\nwere examined by ANOVA. Tests for\ntrend were performed using linear regres-\nsion analysis. Secondary analyses consid-\nered sex-specific age-A1C associations.\nThe sex-by-age interaction on A1C levels\nwas tested with a first-order multiplica-\ntive interaction term. The effect of fasting\nand 2-h postload glucose values on the\nassociation of A1C and age was also ex-\namined. The 97.5th percentile of A1C was\nmeasured in the FOS nondiabetic sample\nto estimate the upper limit of A1C by age-\ngroup. A subset of FOS subjects with no\nevidence of IGT and IFG was analyzed to\nexamine whether the increase in A1C\nwith age was still evident. The effect of\nincreasing age on A1C was examined in\nhad A1C measured at examinations 5 and\nA1C differences by age observed in the\ncross-sectional analysis corresponded to\nchanges observed longitudinally. Change\nin weight between examinations 5 and 7\nwas included as a potential confounder in\nmultivariable regression analysis.\nNHANES. Age was categorized into\n5-year groups to match the age distribu-\ntion of the FOS and to provide reasonable\nsample size in each age bin. All analyses\ntook into account differential probabili-\nties of selection and the complex sample\ndesign. Sampling weights adjust for un-\nequal probabilities of selection resulting\nfrom nonresponse and planned oversam-\npling of certain subgroups.

Differ-\nences in mean A1C by age-group were\nexamined by ANOVA.\nAnalyses of FOS and NHANES data\nwere performed using SAS (version 9.1)\nfor complex surveys.\nRESULTS -- The FOS sample (n \nlation included 3,270 nondiabetic partic-\nboth IFG and IGT. Approximately 2%\n(n  44) of FOS subjects in the nondia-\nbetic group met the criteria for diabetes\non the basis of 2-h postload glucose 200\nmg/dl but were included so that FOS and\nNHANES cohorts would be comparable.\nticipants, 31.6% had IFG. (For the prev-\nalence of IFG and IGT by age, see\nsupplemental Table A1, available in an\nonline appendix at http://dx.doi.org/10.\nThere was a significant positive asso-\nciation between mean A1C and age-\ngroups in the nondiabetic FOS and\nNHANES populations (Ptrend\nfor both) (Figs. 1A and B). In the FOS\npopulation, a similar trend was observed\neven after subjects with IFG and IGT were\nexcluded (Fig. 1C) (Ptrend\nble 1). To exclude diabetes using a more\nstrict definition in the FOS cohort, we an-\nalyzed data from nondiabetic subjects\npostload glucose 200 mg/dl. We ob-\nserved mean A1C results that were not\ndifferent by 0.02 points in any age cat-\negory compared with results obtained\nwhen FPG 126 mg/dl alone was used to\ndefine diabetes. The trend remained sig-\nTo determine whether FPG and 2-h\npostload glucose contribute to the in-\ncrease in A1C observed with age, we an-\nalyzed FPG and 2-h postload glucose by\nage categories (supplemental Table A2,\navailable in the online appendix). In non-\ndiabetic subjects, we noted an 8 mg/dl\nA1C and aging in individuals without diabetes\nrise in FPG in both FOS and NHANES\nand a 35 mg/dl rise in 2-h postload glu-\ncose in FOS. In FOS subjects with NGT,\nFPG increased minimally and 2-h post-\nload glucose increased by 15 mg/dl with\nage.\nThere was no difference in BMI noted\nacross different age categories in either\nFOS or NHANES. In both the FOS and\nNHANES samples, there was a sex differ-\nence in the relationship between A1C and\nincreasing age. We performed multivari-\nate analyses to adjust for differences in\nsex, BMI, fasting glucose, and 2-h post-\nload glucose. In FOS nondiabetic and\nNGT populations, the relationship be-\ntween age and A1C remained unchanged\nin models adjusting for sex, BMI, fasting\nglucose, and 2-h postload glucose (sup-\nplemental Table A3a in the online appen-\ndix). Models adjusted for sex, BMI, and\nFPG in NHANES resulted in similar\nfindings (supplemental Table A3b in the\nonline appendix). From the above-\nmentioned multivariable linear regression\nmodels, every 1-year increase in age was\nassociated with a 0.012-unit increase in\nboth) nondiabetic sample. Analyses of the\nFOS NGT subgroup (IFG and/or IGT ex-\ncluded) showed a similar relationship be-\nThe longitudinal analysis in FOS in-\ncluded a mean follow-up period of 6.7\nyears.

The stud-\nies that have failed to demonstrate an as-\nsociation between age and A1C used\ndiagnostic criteria to exclude diabetes that\nour study we used the most recent criteria\nfor diabetes diagnosis and large popula-\ntion-based cohorts.\nWe found a consistent increase in\nA1C with age in the cross-sectional anal-\nlongitudinal analysis of FOS nondiabetic\nsubjects confirmed an increase in A1C\nwith aging. The 0.03-point increase per\nyear in subjects with no abnormality in\nglucose homeostasis was greater in mag-\nnitude than expected from FOS examina-\ntion 5 cross-sectional analysis, perhaps\nrelated to the relative increase in obesity\namong individuals of the FOS by the time\nof examination 7. An increase in BMI was\nnoted in all age-groups, except for the\n70 years age-group during that period\n(data not shown). It is also possible that\nsubjects who returned for visit 7 may have\nbeen different from subjects who did not\nreturn. Results of our longitudinal analy-\nsis are comparable with those for a previ-\nous analysis of the original Framingham\nHeart Study, comprising parents of the\nFOS population, in which a 0.28% point\nincrease in A1C over a 4- to 6-year period\nwas observed, with a greater increase ob-\nserved with increasing age (30). Even\nthough we found a small increase in FPG\nand a more significant increase in 2-h\npostload glucose values across age catego-\nries, we could not translate these into\nmean blood glucose values to estimate the\ncorresponding rise in A1C across age cat-\negories. However, we accounted for vari-\nation with age of FPG and 2-h postload\nglucose levels by performing multivariate\nanalyses. None of these adjustments ma-\nterially affected the association of age cat-\negory with change in A1C.\nIn the current study, the upper limit\nhigh as 6.83% in older nondiabetic sub-\njects and 6.60% in older subjects with no\ndetectable abnormality of glucose ho-\nmeostasis on standard testing. Despite us-\ning similar methodology to determine the\nNHANES nondiabetic populations, the\n97.5th percentile A1C was slightly higher\nin the FOS population than in the\nNHANES population, even though statis-\ntically significant increases with age were\nnoted in both populations. Differences in\nassays and in the study populations, in-\ncluding their different racial composi-\ntions, and differences in the proportion of\nsubjects with dysglycemic states (supple-\nmental Table A1) may have contributed to\nthe difference observed. The similar rela-\ntive increase with age in both cohorts\nstrengthens the conclusion that A1C lev-\nels increase with age. Moreover, the data\nfrom both the NHANES and the FOS en-\nhance the generalizability of our results.\nThe age-related increase in A1C ob-\nserved in our study is similar in magni-\ntude to that in two previous studies: one\nin Japan (8) and one in a very small (n \nOf the studies that have demonstrated an\nassociation between A1C and older age,\nmany have been performed in selected\ntently included subjects with diabetes by\nnot screening the populations for diabetes\nwith fasting or postchallenge glucose lev-\nels (6,8,10). Inclusion of subjects with\nIGT and/or IFG in previous studies may\nhave contributed to the rise in A1C ob-\nserved. In the current study, even after\nexcluding subjects with the categorical\ndysglycemic states of IGT and IFG and\ncontrolling for the rise in FPG and 2-h\npostload glucose with age, we still ob-\nserved an increase in A1C with age.\nA possible explanation for the ob-\nserved association of higher A1C with in-\ncreasing age in individuals with NGT is\nthat factors unrelated to glucose metabo-\nlism are affecting A1C levels. One such\nexplanation may be changes in the rate of\nglycation associated with aging (12,13).\nThere is no evidence for decreased red cell\nturnover owing to decreased clearance\nwith aging as a possible explanation. A\n2-h OGTT may not adequately capture\npostprandial glycemic excursions in el-\nderly individuals. It is possible that other\nfactors such as worsening kidney function\nwith aging or anemia could be playing a\nrole; however, these are less likely to play\na significant role in healthy aging adults.\nAs in other studies (9), sex differences\nwere noted in the relationship between\nA1C and age. It is possible that this find-\ning is related to lower hemoglobin levels\nin menstruating women with more rapid\nerythrocyte turnover, as suggested previ-\nously (9). Women in peri- and postmeno-\npausal age-groups had a steeper slope\nthan men.\nEven though the association of A1C\nwith complications is well established in\nindividuals with diabetes (31) and in non-\ndiabetic subjects (32,33), the clinical sig-\nnificance of increased A1C in the subset of\nolder individuals who have no evidence of\nglucose intolerance is unknown. Current\ntreatment targets for patients with diabe-\ntes are similar regardless of age. A study\ndesigned to address the question of age-\nspecific treatment targets would be neces-\nsary to determine whether treatment\ntargets should be different.\nThere are several limitations of this\nstudy. First, the differences in sampling\nstrategies for the two studies precluded\ncombining the data from both. Second,\nalthough both studies used an A1C assay\nthat was standardized by the National\nGlycohemoglobin Standardization Pro-\ngram (27), different laboratories per-\nformed the FOS and NHANES assays and\nTable 2--Change in A1C per year in FOS participants between examinations 7 and 5\nAge at\nexamination\nNondiabetic subjects NGT subjects\nn Mean  SE n Mean  SE\nMean duration between the two examinations was 6.7 years (range 4.3\u00ad9.4). Paired t test for the difference\nA1C and aging in individuals without diabetes\na comparison of the absolute A1C values\nmay be problematic. Furthermore, the\nage distribution and prevalence of dys-\nglycemic states in the two studies differed,\nand this may also have affected the abso-\nlute A1C levels in the two studies. Our\nsample size was smaller at the extremes of\nage, and we therefore combined all sub-\njects who were 70 years old to have an\nanalyzable sample size in all age catego-\nries. Finally, we did not account for the\nprevalence of other conditions that could\naffect A1C in either study population, in-\ncluding anemia and its treatment and kid-\nney dysfunction; however, their effect is\nlikely to be small overall. Despite these\nlimitations, the similar impact of increas-\ning age on A1C in both populations pro-\nvides confirmation of the relationship\nbetween age and A1C in the nondiabetic\npopulation.\nIn summary, in the current study, the\nuniform results between FOS and\nNHANES establish clearly that A1C in-\ncreases with age even after multivariate\nadjustments for sex, fasting, and 2-h post-\nload glucose. The finding of higher upper\nlimits of normal A1C in older individuals\nsuggests that nonglycemic factors may\ncontribute to the relationship of A1C with\nage. If we bear in mind the fact that elderly\nindividuals have an increased risk for hy-\npoglycemia and other medication side ef-\nthat are lower than age-appropriate non-\ndiabetic values may be associated with\nmore medication-associated complica-\ntions; however, a clinical study directly\naddressing the question of whether A1C\nshould be age adjusted is needed. We rec-\nommend that further studies be under-\ntaken to determine whether the increase\nin A1C associated with age in subjects\nwith normal glucose tolerance is of clini-\ncal significance and to clarify whether\nage-specific diagnostic and treatment cri-\nteria would be appropriate.\n"
