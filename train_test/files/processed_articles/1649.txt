Strickland, and Jacqueline Agnew\nDepartment of Environmental Health Sciences, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland\n Introduction\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), a group of\nmore than 100 different compounds, are widely distrib-\nuted in the environment as a result of incomplete\ncombustion of natural and man-made organic materials\n(1, 2). Listed by the United States Environmental\nProtection Agency as priority environmental pollutants\n(3), many PAHs are established human carcinogens,\nmutagens, and cocarcinogens (1, 4-9). Major sources of\nnonoccupational exposure include tobacco smoke, con-\ntaminated foods, and polluted air and water (10-13).\nTobacco smoke, a major source of indoor air pollution,\ncontains >60 known carcinogens, including PAHs, in\nboth mainstream and sidestream fractions (14-16).\nSufficient evidence has shown higher PAH exposure\nlevels among current smokers compared with non-\nsmokers (17-20). Although the health effects among\nnonsmokers who live with or spend time in the\nproximity of smokers are well established (8), few studies\nhave evaluated the contribution of involuntary tobacco\nsmoke exposure (also known as secondhand smoke,\npassive smoke, or environmental tobacco smoke) to PAH\nOur objective was to investigate the association\nbetween both active and involuntary tobacco smoke\nexposure with PAH as measured by urinary concen-\ntrations of monohydroxylated PAH metabolites in a\nrepresentative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized\nU.S. population using data from the National Health\n(23, 24).

Isotope\ndilution with 13C-labeled standards was used for\nquantification. Blanks, urine pools, and internal standard\nsamples were used in each analytic run for quality\ncontrol purposes. The ranges for the interassay coeffi-\ncients of variation for each metabolite are shown in\nTable 1. The limits of detection (LOD) varied by\nmetabolite and survey years, ranging from 2 ng/L for\nimputed a default value of LOD divided by the square\nroot of two for those subjects with metabolite levels\nbelow the LOD. Metabolites for which >20% of partic-\nipants were below the LOD were not considered further\nfor this study.\nSmoking Status and Tobacco Smoke Exposure.\nParticipants z20 y of age were classified as never,\nformer, or current smokers based on the household\ninterview items: ``Have you smoked at least 100\ncigarettes in your entire life?'' and ``Do you now smoke\ncigarettes?'' Smoking status among participants 12 to\n19 y of age was derived from audio-computer-assisted\ninterview items: ``Have you ever tried cigarette smoking,\neven 1 or 2 puffs?'' and ``During the past 30 days, on how\nmany days did you smoke cigarettes?''\nSerum cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, was deter-\nmined using isotope dilution high-performance liquid\nchromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ioniza-\ntion tandem mass spectrometry (23, 24). The LOD for\nserum cotinine was <0.05 ng/mL.\nSimilar to Weitzman et al. (27), we defined current\nactive smoking exposure, involuntary smoking exposure,\nand no exposure to tobacco smoke by combining cotinine\nlevels, living with a smoker in the household, and\nsmoking status as follows: (a) active smoking exposure\nwas defined as self-reported current smoking or cotinine\nlevels z10 ng/mL (28); (b) involuntary exposure to\ntobacco smoke was defined as parental report of any\nsmoker in the home or detectable but <10 ng/mL\nas self-report of any smoker living in the home in\nthe absence of self-reported smoking or detectable but\n<10 ng/mL cotinine levels in adolescents and adults;\nand (c) no exposure to tobacco smoke was defined as\ncotinine levels below the LOD, not living with a smoker,\nand not being a current smoker. Three children ages 6 to\n11 y with cotinine levels z10 ng/mL were dropped from\nour analyses; thus, no active smoking exposure category\nexisted for this age group.\nOther Variables. Potential determinants of PAH\nmetabolites evaluated in our analyses included age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity, education, poverty income ratio (PIR),\nconsumption of grilled/broiled meat and alcohol, body\nmass index (BMI), current occupation, physical activity\nlevel, and urinary creatinine. Age, sex, race/ethnicity,\neducation, current occupation, physical activity, and\nalcohol consumption were obtained during the interview\nbased on self-reported information. PIR is a ratio of\nself-reported family income to the family's poverty\nthreshold values, which were standardized by family\nsize and inflation rates based on tables published\nannually by the U.S. Bureau of Census (30). Self-reported\ngrilled/broiled meat intake was obtained from the\ndietary interview component of NHANES and recoded\nas ``yes'' or ``no'' according to whether participants\nreported having eaten any grilled or broiled red meat in\nthe past 24 h. Data on description of food and cooking\nmethod consumed by each participant were obtained\nfrom the U.S. Department of Agriculture food and\nnutrition database (31). Alcohol consumption in adults\nwas classified as never, former, and current. The level\nof physical activity was computed from the total\nmetabolic equivalent of task scores for all physical\nactivities done in the previous 30 d.\nBMI (kg/m2) in adults was computed from measured\nweight and height and categorized into normal (BMI,\n(BMI, z30 kg/m2). BMI in children and adolescents\n(<20 y old) was based on the age- and sex-specific BMI\ngrowth charts (32) as normal (BMI, <85th percentile),\nat risk for overweight (BMI, 85-95th percentile), and\noverweight (BMI, z95th percentile; ref. 33). Urinary\ncreatinine was measured in the same specimen as PAH\nmetabolites by using a photometric Boehringer Mannheim/\nStatistical Analysis. All statistical analyses were\nconducted with STATA version 9.2 statistical software\n(Stata Corp.) using appropriate sampling weights devel-\noped by NCHS for this random subsample to obtain\naccurate estimates representative of the noninstitution-\nalized U.S. population (34). The Taylor linearization\nmethod was used to obtain proper SEs of all estimates.\nPAH metabolites were right skewed and log10\ntrans-\nformed for the analyses. Geometric means and inter-\nquartile ranges were computed for all metabolites. To\nassess determinants of PAH exposure, the ratios and\n95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the geometric mean\nPAH metabolite levels were estimated using linear\nregression models on log10\n-transformed metabolite levels\nby main determinants including age, sex, race/ethnicity,\neducation, PIR, self-reported dietary grilled/broiled\nmeat, cotinine levels, smoking status (never/former/\ncurrent), and current exposure to tobacco smoke (none/\ninvoluntary/active).\nTo examine the association of each metabolite with\ncurrent exposure to tobacco smoke, linear regression\n-transformed PAH metabolite levels were\nfirst adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level,\nand PIR. We then further adjusted for self-reported\ndietary grilled/broiled meat, a known source of PAH\nexposure (2). Because urinary PAH metabolites were\nmeasured in a spot urine sample, and thus influenced by\nfactors such as fluid intake, perspiration, and glomerular\nfiltration rate (35), we added urinary creatinine to each\nfinal model to adjust for individual differences in urine\nconcentration (36). We also assessed other potential\nconfounding by current occupation, BMI, alcohol use,\nand levels of physical activity by adding them one at a\ntime to multivariable models. No noticeable changes\nwere observed (data not shown) and these additional\nvariables were not included in our final models.\nResults\nPAH Metabolite Concentrations in Urine.

PAH levels varied widely by\nmetabolite, with geometric means ranging from 2.3 ng/L\nbolites of phenanthrene (4-OHPhe), fluoranthene\n(3-OHFrt), benzo[a]pyrene (3-OHB[a]P), benz[a]anthra-\nacene (1-OHB[a]A and 3-OHB[a]A), benzo[c]phenan-\nnthrene (1-OHB[c]P, 2-OHB[c]P, and 3-OHB[c]P), and\nchrysene (1-OHChr, 2-OHChr, 3-OHChr, 4-OHChr, and\n6-OHChr), the levels were below the LOD in >20% of\nthe population. Therefore, these metabolites were not\nconsidered in further analyses. For the other 10 PAH\nmetabolites, the proportion of detectable values ranged\nSociodemographic Determinants of Urinary PAH\nConcentrations. Men had higher levels for all metabo-\nlites (Fig. 1). Urinary PAH concentrations for almost all\nmetabolites varied somewhat by age, with the highest\ngeometric means found in persons 20 to 39 years old.\nBy race/ethnicity, non-Hispanic Black participants had\nhigher levels of PAH exposure than non-Hispanic White\nand Mexican American participants for most metabolites.\nThe geometric means of most PAH metabolites were\nlower in participants with higher education level and\nwith higher PIRs (higher adjusted income).\nAfter multivariable adjustment, urinary concentrations\nof most PAH metabolites were comparable in men and\nwomen, although 1-OHPhe and 2-OHNap concentra-\ntions were significantly higher in women (Table 2). The\nadjusted ratios of geometric means for most metabolites\nwere lower in participants 12 to 39 years of age with\nrespect to the youngest age group (6-11 years of age) for\nmost metabolites, except 2-OHPhe. Except for 1-OHNap,\n3-OHFle, 1-OHPhe, 3-OHPhe, and 9-OHPhe, which were\nsignificantly lower in Mexican Americans, and 1-OHPhe\nand 9-OHPhe, which were lower in non-Hispanic Blacks\ncompared with non-Hispanic Whites, no major racial/\nethnic differences were observed. Inverse associations\nbetween income (as measured by PIR) and education\nlevels with PAH metabolite concentrations remained\npresent for most isomers.\nGrilled/Broiled Meat and Urinary PAH Concentra-\ntions. After multivariable adjustment, self-reported\ngrilled/broiled meat consumption was associated\nwith increased concentrations of most PAH metabolites\n(Table 2). For 3-OHPhe, 9-OHPhe, 1-OHNap, and\n2-OHNap, the adjusted ratios of the geometric means\nwere statistically significant and increased by 18% to\n37% compared with participants who did not report\neating grilled/broiled meat.\nExposure to Tobacco Smoke and Urinary PAH\nConcentrations. Current smokers had higher urinary\nPAH metabolite concentrations compared with non-\nsmokers for all metabolites (Fig. 1), but no substantial\ndifferences were observed between nonsmokers and\nformer smokers. Urinary concentrations of PAH meta-\nbolites also increased with increasing serum cotinine\nlevels. Levels of all isomers were highest in the active\ntobacco smoke exposure group and lowest in partici-\npants not exposed to tobacco smoke. Participants\ninvoluntarily exposed to tobacco smoke had intermediate\nconcentrations (Fig. 1).\nFigure 1.

For most subgroups,\nthe adjusted ratios of geometric means of 1-OHPyr\namong participants involuntarily exposed to tobacco\nsmoke were f1.5 times higher compared with unex-\nposed groups. The corresponding adjusted ratios for\nactive smokers compared with unexposed were 2.4 to\n3 times higher. Similar patterns were observed in\nsubgroups defined by sex, race/ethnicity, education,\npoverty level, and self-reported dietary grilled/broiled\nmeat. Similar findings by sociodemographic character-\nistics were observed for the association of tobacco smoke\nwith other PAH metabolites (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nSummary of Findings. In a representative sample of\nthe U.S. population, children and adults involuntarily\nand actively exposed to tobacco smoke had higher\nconcentrations of PAH metabolites in urine compared\nwith those not exposed. The association persisted after\nadjustment for other determinants of PAH exposure,\nincluding age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income,\nand broiled/grilled meat consumption. A consistent\ndose-response relationship was observed between recent\nlevels of tobacco smoke exposure (active/involuntary/\nunexposed) and by cotinine levels with almost every\nmetabolite. No differences in PAH levels were observed\nbetween never and former smokers, supporting the view\nthat urinary PAH metabolites reflect recent and ongoing\nexposure to tobacco smoke, including involuntary\nexposure, but not past or cumulative exposure.\nPAH Exposure--Comparison with Other Countries.\nUrinary monohydroxylated PAH metabolite concentra-\ntions obtained in our study were similar to those\ntion (37) but generally lower than concentrations in\nselected nonoccupationally exposed populations in\nNetherlands (11).

Whereas most studies have measured\nPAHs in selective occupationally exposed individuals\nor in individuals living in areas with significant\nenvironmental sources of PAH, NHANES is a nationally\nrepresentative sample of the U.S. general population. In\nthe United States, levels of PAH concentrations in the\nambient air are generally low and food and tobacco\nsmoke are likely to be the most significant sources of\nPAH exposure. Given important recent reductions in\nactive smoking (44) and in involuntary exposure to\ntobacco smoke at home and in public places in the United\nStates (45), it is possible that lower PAH metabolite\nconcentrations in the U.S. population also reflect lower\nexposure to tobacco smoke compared with other\ncountries. Because this was the first time that PAH\nmetabolites were measured in the general U.S. popula-\ntion, however, it is not possible to compare our findings\nwith previous times.\nTobacco Smoke Exposure. Urinary excretion of PAH\nmetabolites was increased in participants with involun-\ntary and active tobacco smoke exposure by a factor of\nunexposed participants. The contribution of active\ncigarette smoking to PAH exposure is well established.\nMultiple studies have consistently reported 1-OHPyr\nconcentrations in urine to be 1.5 to 3 times higher among\n46, 47). Although less frequently studied, similar trends\nhave been observed for other monohydroxylated PAH\nmetabolites, such as 2-OHFle (48), 1-OHPhe, 2-OHPhe,\nA limited number of studies have evaluated the effect\nof involuntary tobacco smoke exposure on PAH bio-\nassociation with urinary 1-OHPyr (52, 53) and with\nPAH-albumin adducts (22). Merlo et al. (52) estimated\nthat the contribution of involuntary tobacco smoke\nexposure to 1-OHPyr urinary excretion would be similar\nto exposure among police officers working in a traffic\nsetting. In addition, consistent with our findings in\nchildren, Tsai et al. (53) reported an average 9.6%\nincrease in urinary 1-OHPyr in preschool children per\none cigarette smoked by the child's father. The higher\nconcentrations of urinary PAH metabolites in non-\nsmokers who are involuntary exposed to tobacco smoke\ncompared with unexposed can be related to high PAH\nlevels in the sidestream fraction of tobacco smoke, the\nmain fraction to which nonsmokers are exposed (54-56).\nIn a controlled atmosphere experiment, high concen-\ntrations of several PAH compounds were measured in\naged and diluted sidestream tobacco smoke particles\n(57). Increased levels of multiple PAH compounds have\nalso been reported in field studies comparing smoking\nwith control environments (58). In the present study, the\nstatistically significant differences in PAH metabolites\nbetween involuntarily exposed and unexposed partic-\nipants were observed for 1-OHPyr, 2-OHFle, 3-OHFle,\n9-OHFle, 1-OHPhe, 2-OHPhe, and 3-OHPhe, but not for\n9-OHPhe or 1-OHNap and 2-OHNap isomers, suggest-\ning that involuntary tobacco smoke exposure could be\na relevant source for these PAH metabolites. Overall,\nthe higher concentrations of PAH metabolites in the\nurine of nonsmokers involuntarily exposed to tobacco\nsmoke compared with the urine of unexposed non-\nsmokers suggest that inhalation of tobacco smoke\u00ad\ncontaminated air contributes significantly to PAH excre-\ntions in urine.\nGrilled/Broiled Meat Consumption. Diets that are\nrich in PAHs are recognized as one of the most important\nsources of PAH exposure for nonoccupationally exposed\nnonsmokers (17, 59). Several studies have reported\nelevated urinary PAH biomarkers, particularly 1-OHPyr,\nwith consumption of foods that are rich in PAH, such\nas those cooked by open-flame methods. In a controlled\nexperimental study of 21 nonoccupationally PAH-\nexposed volunteers, urinary levels of 1-OHPyr increased\nafter consuming 170 g/d barbecued hamburgers for\n5 days compared with baseline (17). Similarly, urinary\nexcretion of 1-OHPyr glucuronide increased 10- to\n80-fold following the ingestion of broiled beef (60).\nCompared with a control group, exposure to dietary\nPAH from charcoal-grilled meat resulted in a 4- to 12-\nfold increase of 1-OHPyr level in urine (61). However,\nfew studies have evaluated the effect of dietary PAH\nexposure on other monohydroxylated metabolites,\nalthough Hoepfner et al. (49) did observe a 2-fold\nincrease in urinary excretion of OHPhe in subjects with\na PAH-rich diet.\nIn the present study, we found only a weak association\nbetween reported consumption of grilled/broiled meat\nin the past 24 hours and 1-OHPyr levels in urine,\npossibly related to incomplete assessment of all relevant\nfood items and cooking methods. It is important to note\nthat grilled/broiled meats contribute less than half\nthe PAHs consumed through dietary sources (12). The\nassociations, however, were stronger for 3-OHPhe,\n9-OHPhe, 1-OHNap, and 2-OHNap, even after adjusting\nfor smoking and other confounding factors, suggesting\nthat these metabolites, rather than 1-OHPyr, may be\nrelevant biomarkers for monitoring low-level PAH\nexposure related to intake of PAHs from foods.\nThe observed variability in the relationship of grilled/\nbroiled meat consumption across individual PAH\nmetabolites in urine may be explained by interindividual\nvariation in doses and bioavailability of ingested PAHs,\nand possibly by interindividual variation in genetic\npolymorphisms that encode enzymes involved in PAH\nAlternatively, the induction of metabolizing enzymes\nthrough chronic exposure could lead to differential\nmetabolism of individual PAHs. Active smokers may\nmetabolize ingested PAHs differently from unexposed\nOther Sociodemographic Determinants.

The influence of age and race/ethnicity on\nPAH metabolite levels has not been extensively studied.\nThe inverse association between low income and\neducation levels with urinary excretion for most PAH\nmetabolites after adjustment for tobacco exposure may\nreflect additional sources of PAH exposure, either inside\nor outside the home.\nStrengths and Limitations. Important strengths add to\nthe relevance of the study findings. First, this is a large\nstudy, multiethnic, and representative of the general\nU.S. population z6 years old. Second, we were able to\nevaluate multiple PAH metabolites in urine. Urine PAH\nlevels integrate several sources of exposure and are\nconsidered validated markers, even at low levels. Third,\ninvoluntary exposure to tobacco smoke was defined by\ncombining serum cotinine levels and self-reported\nmeasures of smoking status, thus reducing the likelihood\nof smoking status misclassification. Other strengths of\nthis study include the ability to control for several\nrelevant covariates, including dietary factors, the consis-\ntency of the findings by participant characteristics, and\nthe high quality measures and procedures used by\nSeveral limitations must be considered. First, although\nwe used a commonly used cutoff for cotinine (z10 ng/mL;\nrefs. 28, 45) to classify active versus involuntary smoke\nexposure, it is possible that some infrequent smokers\nwho denied smoking remained classified as involuntarily\nexposed. Conducting sensitivity analyses using 5 ng/mL\nas a cutoff, however, did not substantially affect the\nstudy findings. Second, although PAH concentrations in\nfood can vary depending on type of meat, method of\npreparation, cooking temperature, and fuel sources (67),\nNHANES dietary data were limited, thus restricting our\nability to estimate and control for those aspects related\nto PAH content in food items. This might have affected\nour analysis of the association between grilled or broiled\nmeat and PAH levels. It is unlikely to have confounded\nthe relationship between tobacco exposure and PAH\nmetabolites, however, because our findings were consis-\ntent according to participant characteristics such as\ndifferences in gender, ethnicity, education level, and\nage, including young children. Third, the possibility of\nreporting bias with regard to smoking status could not\nbe ruled out. Current smokers who had not recently\nsmoked a cigarette may have been classified as a\nnonsmoker if they incorrectly reported their smoking\nhistory. Similarly, nonsmokers with extreme levels of\nenvironmental tobacco exposure and consequent high\nlevels of cotinine, such as those working in smoky\nenvironments, may have been classified as smokers.\nAlthough our study included subjects as young as\n6 years, infants and preschool children were not\nevaluated because PAH measures were not available in\nNHANES data for children <6 years of age. Thus, we\nwere unable to address the implications of involuntary\nsmoke exposure for this important group. Other poten-\ntial limitations include the cross-sectional design of\nNHANES, uncontrolled confounding, and potential\nbiases resulting from nonparticipation and response\nerror.\nConclusions. This study supports the hypothesis that\ninvoluntary and active tobacco smoke exposure is\nassociated with urinary levels of several PAH metabo-\nlites. The clear dose-response relationship between levels\nof tobacco smoke exposure and elevated urinary concen-\ntrations of 1-OHPyr, 2-OHFle, 3-OHFle, 9-OHFle,\n1-OHPhe, 2-OHPhe, and 3-OHPhe suggests that envi-\nronmental tobacco smoke is a source of PAH exposure.\nThe finding of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke\nas a relevant source of mutagenic and carcinogenic PAH\ncompounds underscores the public health relevance of\nthis study and the need for public health and medical\nprofessionals to continue policy and educational efforts\nto minimize active and involuntary tobacco smoke\nexposure.\nDisclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest\nNo potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.\nReferences\n1.
