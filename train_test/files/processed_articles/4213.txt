    "abstract": "Abstract\nMany published studies have employed the Mini-K to measure a single fast\u00adslow life history dimension. However, the internal\nstructure of the Mini-K has not been determined and it is not clear that a single higher order K-factor fits the data. It is also not\nclear that the Mini-K is measurement invariant across groups such as the sexes. To establish the construct validity of K as well as\nthe broader usefulness of applying life history theory to humans, it is crucial that these psychometric issues are addressed as a part\nof measure validation efforts. Here we report on three studies that used latent variable modeling and data drawn from two college\nstudent samples (ns \u00bc 361 and 300) to elucidate the psychometrics of the Mini-K. We found that (a) the Mini-K had a six\ndimensional first-order structure, (b) the K-factor provided a parsimonious explanation of the associations among the lower\norder factors at no significant cost to fit, (c) the Mini-K measured the same K-factor across the sexes, (d) K-factor means did not\nhave the same meaning across the sexes and thus the first-order factors should be used in studies of mean sex differences, and\nfinally, (e) the K-factor was only associated with environment and aspects of mating competition in females. Implications and\nfuture directions for life history research are discussed.\n",

Richardson1, Ching-Chen Chen2, Chia-Liang Dai2,\nMichael D. Brubaker1, and Joseph L. Nedelec1\n Keywords\nMini-K, structural equation modeling, latent variables, psychometrics, life history strategy, life history theory\nSeveral concerns about psychometric research on human life\nhistory strategy (LHS) have been raised, most of which relate to\nconstruct validity (Copping, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014; Cop-\nping, Campbell, Muncer, & Richardson, 2016; Richardson,\nSanning, et al., 2016). One concern is that despite frequent\nreference to a single fast\u00adslow dimension (e.g., Super-K), rel-\natively little work has been done to confirm the unidimension-\nality of life history indicators and emerging evidence suggests\nthey may be multidimensional. For instance, Brumbach, Fig-\nson, Dai, et al. (2016) found that a single dimension did not\nsubsume all adolescent and young adult LHS indicators. More-\nover, Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016) found that a single\ndimension did not subsume all LHS indicators in a nationally\nrepresentative sample of middle-aged adults. Richardson, Dar-\niotis, and Lai (2016) extended these findings to a predomi-\nnantly urban sample of young adults. These two studies used\nbroad selections of life history indicators and found two dimen-\nsions--mating competition (subsuming, e.g., risk-taking,\naggression, and number of sex partners) and Super-K\n(subsuming, e.g., pair-bonding, social contact/support, agree-\nableness, and aspects of covitality). Taken together, these find-\nings imply there may not be a single LHS variable that can be\nused to assess life history speed, or in other words, scored to\nlocate people on a single fast\u00adslow dimension.\nCopping, Campbell, and Muncer (2014) recently drew\nattention to the validity of scales developed for the specific\npurpose of measuring human LHS (e.g., the Mini-K, Figueredo\nscales). High scores on these scales are interpreted as signaling\nslower LHS, whereas lower scores are taken as implying faster\nLHS. The authors factored the HKSS and found that a model\n1 School of Human Services, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA\n2 University of Nevada\u00adLas Vegas, Las Vegas, NV, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nGeorge B.

This suggests that when\nthe HKSS is summed, participants' scores do not correspond to\nany single variable or position on a single fast\u00adslow dimension.\nInstead, these scores should be interpreted as researcher con-\nstructed composites of the four HKSS factors.\nThe Copping et al. (2014) finding that the HKSS is multi-\ndimensional, combined with findings that two unique factors\nsubsumed LHS indicators, raises questions about psychometric\napplications of life history theory (LHT) to humans. Do these\nfindings of multidimensionality extend other scales designed to\nmeasure human LHS, such as the Mini-K and the Arizona Life\nHistory Battery (ALHB; see Figueredo et al., 2006)? These\nmeasures have been used to produce scores locating partici-\npants on a fast\u00adslow (r-K) dimension, but it is not yet clear that\ntheir items reflect a single factor. This is because to the best of\nour knowledge, no study has yet confirmed the dimensionality\nof the Mini-K, though it has been employed in at least 30\nstudies (Black, Figueredo, & Jacobs, 2016). Moreover, no stud-\nies that we are aware of have tested the Mini-K for measure-\nment invariance across the sexes, which is important, given the\ndocumented sex differences in reproductive strategies (for dis-\net al., 2016). Are sex differences limited to the means and\nvariances of LHS factors, or are the identities of LHS con-\nstructs themselves different across the sexes? If LHS factors\nare indeed sex invariant, do they have the same correlates\nwithin each sex? These questions have not been adequately\naddressed in psychometric studies of human LHS.\nCurrent Project\nThe current project helps to fill these gaps in the literature by\napplying exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM),\nconfirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and multigroup structural\nequation modeling (multigroup SEM) to the Mini-K (the 20-\nitem short form of the ALHB) in three studies of undergraduate\nstudents. Specifically, Study I applies ESEM to a sample of\nundergraduate students to examine the structure of the Mini-K;\nStudy II uses CFA to confirm the structure identified in Study\nII; and Study III uses multigroup SEM to test for (a) measure-\nment invariance between the samples (and pools them if invar-\niance is found), (b) a higher order K-factor, (c) measurement\ninvariance between the sexes, and (d) associations of the Mini-\nK with indicators of harshness and mating competition (e.g.,\nrisk-taking). Examining the associations between the Mini-K\nand indicators of mating competition allows us to assess\nwhether K (if indeed the scale is unidimensional) should be\nconceptualized as overall life history speed. We examine these\nassociations separately by sex, allowing for the possibility that\nany factors underlying the Mini-K have different correlates\nwithin each.\nFinally, across the confirmatory studies (II and III), we\nexamine the degree to which the assumption of local indepen-\ndence holds for the Mini-K items. Measurement invariance and\nlocal independence are two assumptions that can be tested to\nestablish the usefulness of latent variables (Brown, 2006;\nEdwards & Bagozzi, 2000). First, a latent variable must explain\nthe associations among its indicators, rendering them (locally)\nindependent conditional upon it. Second, the associations\nbetween the latent variable and its indicators must be stable\nacross the distribution of external variables. If these assump-\ntions are not at least partially met, a latent variable cannot be\nunderstood as the common cause of its indicators or as having a\nunique identity.\nGeneral Methods\nParticipants and Procedures\nThe studies reported here analyzed data from two samples of\ncollege students in a large Midwestern university. The project\nwas granted approval through a university-based institutional\nreview board, and participants were recruited through their\nclasses, both online and face-to-face, as well as through a sub-\nject pool. Participants did not receive any form of incentive for\ntheir participation. Students read an information form, pro-\nvided consent, and subsequently completed a questionnaire.\nOverall, the participants sampled were relatively diverse with\nrespect to socioeconomic status (SES). More than 20% of the\nstudents at the university we sampled from were first-\ngeneration college students, suggesting the institution served\nan economically diverse student body. Moreover, 58 (8.8%)\nhad primary childhood residence total household incomes\nwas *US$24,000, Federal Interagency Forum on Child and\nwere worse off financially than most, 244 (36.9%) reported that\ntheir father had a high school level education or less, and 199\n(30.1%) reported the same for mother's educational attainment\n(the U.S. percentage for both mothers and fathers in 2013 was\n30%, Kena et al., 2015). More detailed demographics for each\nsample are reported in Study I and Study II.\nInstruments\nMini-K. The Mini-K is a 20-item brief scale designed to measure\nthe domains captured by the ALHB (Figueredo et al., 2006).\nThese domains include (a) family social contact and support;\n(b) friends social contact and support; (c) altruism; (d) mother/\nfather relationship quality; (e) insight, planning, and control; (f)\nintentions toward infidelity; and (g) religiosity. Two to three\nitems reflect each of these constructs (e.g., item contents, see\nTable 1). For this study, we eliminated the third and fifth\nLikert-type points (disagree and agree slightly) from the\nMini-K to include it within a broader survey that used 5-\npoint scales and machine scoring. This was acceptable because\nthe psychometric properties of 5- and 6- or 7-point Likert-type\nscales do not differ substantively and can be easily rescaled for\nThe Mini-K has demonstrated adequate internal consistency\nin past research (i.e., coefficient as around .70; see Olderbak,\n2 Evolutionary Psychology\nGladden, Wolf, & Figueredo, 2014). However, decades of\nresearch have indicated that the usefulness of coefficient a is\nquite limited and its assumptions rarely hold in practice (for\nstudy, coefficient a does not provide any information about\ninternal structure and therefore cannot justify scoring proce-\ndures that assume scale unidimensionality (Sijtsma, 2009). In\nlight of this, we used factor analysis to assess dimensionality\nand observed the magnitude of the factor loadings for informa-\ntion about reliability and validity. Descriptive statistics and a\ncoefficients for the Mini-K are reported in Study I and Study II.\nMissing Data\nPrior to conducting our studies, we screened each data set for\noutliers, missing values, and violations of the assumptions of\nfactor analysis. No evidence of outliers or skew statistics larger\nthan two were observed. The percentage of data missing for the\nvariables in the studies ranged from 2.7% to 9.7%. We handled\neach set's missing data using full information maximum like-\nAnalyses\nAll studies reported here used MPlus 7.11 to test models, raw\ndata as input, and robust weighted least squares (WLSMV) as\nthe estimator because the Mini-K is comprised of ordinal\nLikert-type items (Muth\u00b4\nobserved that the ratio of cases to freely estimated parameters\nexceeded 10 to 1 for all hypothesized models, satisfying the\nminimum ratio often indicated for SEM studies (Bentler &\nChou, 1987). Following convention, we conducted all signifi-\ncance tests at the p < .05 level. We used b \u00bc .30 as the threshold\nfor retaining items and interpreting factor loadings (Kline,\nModel Fit\nAcross the studies, we used a variety of fit indices because they\nprovide different information about model fit. We considered\nthe substantive meaningfulness of the model, nonsignificance\nof the w2 likelihood ratio statistic (Bollen, 1989), Tucker\u00ad\nLewis index (TLI) and comparative fit index (CFI) greater than\nerror of approximation (RMSEA) values of less than .05\n(Browne & Cudeck, 1993) as evidence of acceptable fit to the\ndata. In this study, we needed to test differences in fit between\nmodels for statistical significance. Importantly, the w2 value for\nWLSMV cannot be used for difference testing in the usual way.\nIn this context, w2 difference testing is carried out via the\nDIFFTEST function in MPlus.\nStudy I\nSample\nStudy I analyzed data from 361 undergraduate students. Most\nwere seniors.\nESEM\nWe used ESEM to examine and test the structure of the Mini-K.\nESEM is especially useful for exploratory factor analysis\n(EFA) because unlike traditional procedures, it produces fit\nstatistics that can be used to assess model correspondence to\nthe data. For our ESEM analyses, we used delta parameteriza-\ntion and oblique rotations (Geomin). We began by specifying a\nsingle-factor model and then compared it to models with\nincreasing numbers of factors, ceasing when model fit was\nobserved as excellent (using the model fit statistics outlined\nabove).\nResults\nAs a reminder, these analyses examined data gathered with the\nMini-K short-form version of the ALHB. We used ESEM to\ntest a single-factor model and found that it fit the data poorly\nthree-factor models and these fit the data poorly as well (for fit\ninformation, see Table 1). Four- and five-factor models fit the\ndata better but only CFI met its commonly accepted threshold\nfor good fit (i.e., .95). A six-factor model fit the data even\nbetter, with CFI indicating a very good fit and TLI and RMSEA\nfalling just below their thresholds for good fit. We observed\nthat 3 items (1 \u00bc I can often tell how things will turn out, 9 \u00bc I\nhave a close and warm relationship with my sexual partner,\nand 10 \u00bc I have a close and warm relationship with my own\nchildren) did not load substantially on any factors (bs < .30).\nNo modification indices suggested that these items should be\nlinked with other items or Mini-K factors. Thus, we removed\nthese 3 items and the resulting model had an excellent fit to the\n\u00bc .03. Given the nonsignificant w2, we did not reject the\nTable 1.

Table 2 displays the items, their contents, and\nloadings that were b > .30. Factors 1 through 4 mapped onto the\nprespecified identities noted in Instruments. We did not find\naltruism, intentions toward infidelity, or religiousness factors.\nAlthough individual items tapping these domains are or seem\nto be included in the Mini-K, it does not appear to be the case\nthat the first-order structure underlying the items corresponds\nto these constructs. Instead, we found harm avoidance and\ncommunity involvement factors. Notably, Item 12 (I have to\nbe closely attached to someone before I am comfortable having\nsex with them) reflected harm avoidance and community invol-\nvement. This makes theoretical sense, given that harm avoid-\nance should correspond to lesser sexual risk-taking and sexual\nconstraint is also normative in many communities, especially\nreligious ones. Also, Item 19 (I am closely connected to and\ninvolved in my community) reflected both friend contact/sup-\nport and community involvement. This makes sense because\nfriends are found outside of the home environment or in the\ncommunity.\nNext, we interpreted the factor intercorrelations (see\nTable 3). We found that the overall pattern of relationships\namong the factors did not suggest a higher order common\nfactor subsumed them. The relational factors (i.e., 2, 3, and\n4) were significantly and moderately correlated, suggesting\nthey might share a higher order social support factor. Family\nsocial contact/support was significantly related to all the Mini-\nK factors. However, each of the other factors was not signifi-\ncantly related to at least two other factors, and community\ninvolvement was only significantly related to family social\ncontact/support.\nDiscussion\nIn Study I, we used ESEM to examine the structure of the\nMini-K and found that a six-factor solution best fit the data.\nWe found insight, planning, and control; mother/father rela-\ntionship quality; friend social contact/support; family social\ncontact/support; harm avoidance; and community involvement\nfactors. Importantly, these factors mapped onto constructs that\nhave been theoretically and empirically tied to human LHS in\nWe observed a pattern of factor intercorrelations that suggested\na social support factor likely subsumed the relational factors\n(e.g., mother/father relationship quality, friend social contact/\nsupport), but several other correlations were nonsignificant and\ncommunity involvement was only significantly related to fam-\nily social contact/support. This suggests that a general LHS\nfactor was unlikely to subsume all the factors, but we address\nthis issue directly in Study III. One possibility is that some\nTable 2.

Most\nCFA\nWe used CFA to test the Mini-K structure found in Study I. In\ncontrast to ESEM, CFA models encode specific assumptions\nabout associations between items and between items and fac-\ntors. The first is local independence, or the assumption that\nindicators are independent conditional on their factor. The con-\nfiguration of indicators or specific factors they reflect or load\nupon is also specified a priori. Model fit is examined to deter-\nmine whether assumptions hold.\nResults\nWe tested the six-factor model found in Study I using our\nsecond sample and CFA. Fit indices suggested this model fit\nTLI \u00bc .96; RMSEA \u00bc .06, though the w2 test was significant.\nWe observed that Item 6 (I avoid taking risks) did not load\nsignificantly on its factor (harm avoidance). No modifications\nindices suggested this item should be linked to other items or\nMini-K factors. Thus, we dropped it prior to further analysis.\nWe also observed that Item 12 (I have to be closely attached to\nsomeone before I am comfortable having sex with them) did not\nload substantially on community involvement (b \u00bc .16),\nthough it loaded acceptably on its other factor, harm avoidance\n(b \u00bc .68). We removed this item's first loading and the result-\nharm avoidance items concerned pairing off with one partner\nand getting to know them before having sex, we changed the\nfactor's name to pair-bonding. No relatively large modification\nindices were observed; suggesting no areas of strain existed for\nthis model. Thus, we accepted it as the best reproducer of the\nrelationships among our variables.\nNext, we interpreted the magnitude of the factor loadings\nand intercorrelations (see Tables 4 and 5). All loadings were\nlarger than b \u00bc .30 except for the Item 5 (I often make plans in\nadvance) loading on pair-bonding, suggesting they reflected\ntheir factors adequately. The Item 5 loading was near b \u00bc\n.30 and in Study I it was larger than b \u00bc .40. Thus, we retained\nit as an indicator of pair-bonding. In contrast to Study I, all\nfactor correlations were statistically significant (ps < .05), rang-\ning from small to large in size.\nDiscussion\nIn Study II, we replicated the Mini-K structure we found in\nStudy I, with the exceptions that Item 6 did not reflect its factor\nand Item 12 reflected only pair-bonding. We were thus able to\nconfirm that six factors subsumed the Mini-K items, including\ninsight, planning, and control; mother/father relationship qual-\nity; friend social contact/support; family social contact/support;\npair-bonding; and community involvement. Local indepen-\ndence held for all of the Mini-K items. Moreover, we found\nsome weak factor intercorrelations, suggesting a second-order\nK-factor might not subsume the six first-order factors, but we\nreturn to this possibility in Study III. Taken together, Studies I\nand II suggest that the Mini-K items reflect six life history\ndomains consistent with LHT, though not all were those pre-\nspecified in the literature.\nStudy III\nIn Study III, we (a) pooled our samples given evidence of\nmeasurement invariance and demographic similarity, (b) tested\nfor a higher order K-factor, (c) tested for measurement invar-\niance across the sexes, and (d) examined the Mini-K's nomo-\nlogical net. As a reminder, we examined the Mini-K's\nnomological net to assess whether the data seemed consistent\nwith a single LHS dimension.\nSample\nThis study pooled the Studies I and II samples. This was accep-\ntable because we observed evidence of measurement\nTable 4. Unstandardized and Standardized Effects--Study II Final\nCFA Model.\nParameter b SE p* b\nNote.

We did observe, however, that the Study II sample\nwith its larger proportion of freshman (55.3%) compared with\nStudy I (22.4%). Given that the age range was not large, along\nwith the other observed similarities between the samples, we\nproceeded with pooling them.\nInstruments\nStudy III used several additional scales to examine the\nMini-K's nomological net, including measures of risk-taking,\nimpulsivity, substance use, and SES. We included risk-taking\nand substance use because these variables have reflected\nmating competition in past research (e.g., Richardson, Sanning,\net al., 2016). We included impulsivity because it has been\nlinked to indicators of mating competition (e.g., sensation seek-\ning or reward sensitivity; Richardson, Freedlander, & Katz,\n2014). We included SES as an indicator of environmental\nharshness (see Ellis, Figueredo, Brumbach, & Schlomer,\n2009). To incorporate these scales into our model, we used\nEFA and maximum likelihood to examine them for unidimen-\nsionality and saved factor scores using Bartlett's method.\nRisk-taking. The Risk-Taking Scale included 3 items rated on 5-\npoint Likert scales (not at all true of me to very true of me). The\nitem contents were: I don't mind taking risks, I like doing scary\nthings, and I love exciting experiences. These items were uni-\ndimensional and loaded on their factor at b \u00bc .69, .59, and .48,\nrespectively.\nImpulsivity. The Impulsivity scale included 4 items adapted from\nthe impulsiveness subscale of the revised NEO personality\ninventory (NEO-PI\u00adR; Lord, 2007; Whiteside & Lynam,\n2001). These were rated on 5-point Likert-type scales (not at\nall true of me to very true of me) and their item contents were, I\nfrequently act on strong feelings, Sometimes my feelings lead\nme to do things I don't like, When I experience extreme emo-\ntions I tend to act before thinking, and Sometimes I can't stop\nwhat I'm doing because of intense feelings. These items were\nunidimensional and loaded on their factor at b \u00bc .47, .60, .71,\nand .64, respectively.\nSES. SES is in important indicator of environmental harshness\n(Ellis et al., 2009) and student SES is traditionally indexed\nusing parental income, educational attainment, and occupa-\ntional status (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES],\n2012). In this study, we used 3 items to measure SES. The first\n2 items asked participants to report the highest degree earned\nby their parents. Participants responded on 5-point scales that\nincluded none, general educational development test or high\nschool diploma, associate/junior college, bachelor's degree, or\nmaster's degree, PhD, or professional degree. The final item\nrequired participant estimation of the total household income\nfor their primary childhood residence using the points US$1\u00ad\nmost studies have not unpacked the effects of specific SES\ncomponents on dimensions of LHS, initially we did not form\ncomposite SES in this study, but instead included each SES\nvariable in our model. This allowed us to examine, for instance,\nwhether (a) income had different effects than education, (b)\nmother and father education level had different effects, and\n(c) SES effects on LHS might be attributable to particular\nvariables. We also repeated our analyses using a traditional\ncomposite SES variable for comparison.\nSubstance use. To assess substance use, we used the frequency\nof recent use items (i.e., past 3 months) from the Alcohol,\nSmoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test\n(ASSIST; WHO ASSIST Working Group, 2002). The ASSIST\nconsists of eight questions that measure lifetime substance use,\nrecent use frequency, use-related consequences, risk of harm,\ndependence, and intravenous drug use. Each question addresses\nnine substance categories including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis,\nTable 5.

The recent use items have 5 points--never,\nonce or twice, monthly, weekly, and daily or almost daily. In\npast research, the recent use subscale has demonstrated ade-\nquate internal consistency (i.e., as greater than .80) and con-\ncurrent validity (e.g., a large correlation with the Addiction\nSeverity Index [r \u00bc .84]; Humeniuk, 2006). In this study, the\nASSIST frequency of use items were two dimensional. Socially\naccepted substance use subsumed use of tobacco (b \u00bc .56),\nalcohol (b \u00bc .48), and cannabis (b \u00bc .61), whereas socially\nunacceptable substance use subsumed use of cocaine (b \u00bc .89),\namphetamines (b \u00bc .64), inhalants (b \u00bc .80), sedatives (b \u00bc\n.52), hallucinogens (b \u00bc .86), and opioids (b \u00bc .67). Cannabis\nuse also cross-loaded on the second factor (b \u00bc .42). The\nfactors were correlated at r \u00bc .41. We saved scores on both\nfactors for use in our SEM.\nMultigroup SEM. This study used multigroup SEM to test\nwhether the Study I and II samples were invariant with\nrespect to the Mini-K. Specifically, we tested the Mini-K\nfor metric (i.e., same factor loadings) and scalar (i.e., same\nintercepts) invariance across the samples. If found, metric\ninvariance implies that constructs measured by a set of\nitems have the same meaning across groups, whereas scalar\ninvariance implies that between-group differences in latent\nvariable means can be interpreted. Given evidence of mea-\nsurement invariance, we pooled the two samples to achieve\na larger sample size, which enabled us to test the Mini-K for\nmeasurement invariance across the sexes. Prior to invar-\niance testing by sex, however, we tested for a higher order\nK-factor in the pooled sample. If a higher order K-factor\nwas consistent with the data, we tested for first-order and\nhigher order metric and scalar invariance across the sexes.\nThis enabled us to determine whether the two sexes attrib-\nuted the same meaning to the K-factor and whether mean\nsex differences on this factor could be interpreted. Finally,\nwe examined the Mini-K's nomological net separately by\nsex, assessing for sex differences in the extent to which K\n(or whatever factors subsumed it) reflected SES and in the\nextent to which it (or they) appeared to subsume the indi-\ncators of mating competition.\nResults\nCross-Sample Invariance Testing\nWe used multigroup SEM to test our Study II model for con-\nfigural invariance (i.e., same items load on same factors)\nacross the two samples to produce baseline statistics for our\ntests of invariance. We found that the configural model fit the\n.97; RMSEA \u00bc .05, though the w2 test suggested it did not fit\nexactly. No modification indices were relatively large, sug-\ngesting no areas of strain existed. Thus, we then constrained\nall factor loadings and thresholds to equality across the sam-\nples, testing for metric and scalar invariance. This model did\nnot fit the data significantly worse than the configural (base-\nMini-K measured the same constructs across the two samples.\nTherefore, we pooled the samples to allow for invariance\ntesting by sex.\nHigher Order K-Factor\nBefore testing for measurement invariance by sex, we investi-\ngated the possibility that a higher order K-factor subsumed the\nfirst-order Mini-K factors in the pooled sample. To test this\npossibility, we first tested the Study II model with no higher\norder factors to attain baseline statistics for comparison. This\nsuggested the model did not fit the data exactly. Modification\nindices suggested no areas of strain existed for this model.\nThus, we then specified a higher order social support factor\nthat subsumed the relational factors (e.g., friend social con-\ntact/support) because their intercorrelations were larger than\nthe others. This resulting model did not fit the data significantly\ngesting that the higher order social support factor provided\nparsimony at no expense to fit. Next, we specified a higher\norder K-factor that subsumed the social support factor and\ninsight, planning, and control; pair-bonding; and community\ninvolvement. We tested this model and it also did not fit sig-\nnificantly worse than the baseline model, Dw2(8) \u00bc 14.14, p \u00bc\n.08, suggesting that the higher order K-factor provided addi-\ntional parsimony at no cost to model correspondence to the\ndata. Thus, we retained the model with the higher order\nK-factor (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Higher order structure of the Mini-K.\nRichardson et al. 7\nFinally, we interpreted the magnitudes of the second-order\nloadings on the K-factor and found that they were all large (see\nstatistics were higher order social support factor (.40); insight,\nplanning, and control (.29); pair-bonding (.47); and community\ninvolvement (.44). Thus, the higher order K-factor appeared to\nnot only provide a parsimonious explanation of the covariance\namong the lower order factors but also explained substantial\namounts of their variance.\nInvariance Testing by Sex\nWe next tested the six-factor (baseline) model for configural\ninvariance by sex and it fit the data for both sexes very well,\n.05, though the significant w2 test suggested it did not fit exactly.\nModification indices suggested no areas of strain existed for this\nmodel. Thus, we constrained all factor loadings and thresholds to\nequality across the sexes and the resulting model fit significantly\nworse than the configural model according to the w2 difference\nnot change by more than .01 except for TLI, which was actually\n.01 higher (i.e., TLI \u00bc .97) and implied a better fit. Taken\ntogether, we reasoned that the fit information could be inter-\npreted as signaling that the loadings and thresholds were invar-\niant across the sexes. That is, the Mini-K appeared to measure\nthe same first-order constructs in males and females.\nNext, we tested the higher order factor model for invariance\nby constraining the higher order loadings on social support and\nthe K-factor to equality across the sexes. Similar to the first-\norder scalar model, this model fit significantly worse than the\nbaseline model according to the w2 test difference test, Dw2(73)\nchange by more than .01 except for TLI, which was .01 higher\n(i.e., TLI \u00bc .97). We next constrained the first-order factor\nintercepts to equality across the groups and fit was significantly\ndecreasing by greater than .01. We found that although fit\nremained significantly poorer if we constrained all intercepts\nto equality except insight, planning, and control; mother/father\n.001, it was not substantively poorer in that CFI did not change\nby .01 and TLI was .01 higher (better). We observed that the\ninsight, planning, and control intercept and the intercept for\nmother/father relationship quality were significantly higher\namong males, whereas the pair-bonding intercept was signifi-\ncantly higher among females (ps < .05). Thus, we concluded\nthat the Mini-K appeared to measure the same higher order\nconstructs across the sexes but only the social support factors\nwere scalar invariant. Finally, we constrained the residuals for\nthe six first-order factors and the higher order social support\nfactor to equality across the groups and the discrepancy in fit,\ncompared to the baseline model, was very similar to that\np \u00bc .02. Thus, the first-order and higher order social support\nresiduals appeared to be invariant by sex. Moreover, the situ-\nation was the same for a model that also included an equality\nconstraint on the male and female K-factor variances, Dw2(83)\nresiduals, the K-factor's variance did not appear to be statisti-\ncally different across the sexes.\nAssessing the Mini-K's Nomological Net\nWe added scores on our measures of risk-taking, impulsivity,\nsubstance use, and aspects of SES as observed variables into\nTable 6.

We\nregressed the K-factor onto mother and father education, along\nwith family income. We regressed risk-taking, impulsivity, and\nsubstance use onto the K-factor. We tested this model and it fit\n.94; RMSEA \u00bc .05. We examined modification indices and\nseveral were relatively large (>20) and suggested that we\nshould regress socially acceptable substance use on friend\nsocial contact/support and pair-bonding for females only. We\nadded these additional specifications and the resulting model fit\n.95; RMSEA \u00bc .04. No remaining modification indices were\nrelatively large, suggesting areas of strain did not exist and this\nmodel was an acceptable reproducer of the relationships among\nthe variables.\nFor males, no SES variable had a statistically significant\neffect on the K-factor, though household income appeared to\nhave an effect that was nontrivial in size (b \u00bc .17, p \u00bc .08). The\neffects of K on risk-taking and impulsivity were nonsignificant,\nthough the effect on risk-taking also seemed to be nontrivial in\nsize (b \u00bc .13, p \u00bc .08). K had a small positive and significant\nnegative effect on socially acceptable substance use (b \u00bc \u00c0.26,\np < .001) as well as a moderate negative effect on socially\nunacceptable substance use (b \u00bc \u00c0.46, p < .001). For males,\nthe model explained 7% of the variance in socially acceptable\nsubstance use and 21% of the variance in socially unacceptable\nsubstance use.\nFor females, mother's education (b \u00bc .18, p < .05) and\nhousehold income (b \u00bc .21, p < .01) had statistically significant\neffects on K (for all parameter estimates, see Supplementary\nMaterials). The K-factor had a small significant and positive\neffect on risk-taking (b \u00bc .18, p < .01) and a small negative\neffect on impulsivity (b \u00bc \u00c0.13, p < .05). K had a small sig-\nnificant negative effect on socially acceptable substance use (b\n\u00bc \u00c0.26, p < .001) as well as a large negative effect on socially\nunacceptable substance use (b \u00bc \u00c0.53, p < .001). Finally,\nfriend social contact/support had a moderate positive effect\non socially acceptable substance use (b \u00bc .29, p < .001), while\npair-bonding had a moderate negative effect on this variable (b\n\u00bc \u00c0.37, p < .01). For females, the model explained 28% of the\nvariance in each type of substance use as well as 3% of the\nvariance in risk-taking and 2% in impulsivity. The pattern of\nresults was the same for a model that included an SES compo-\nsite instead of the individual mother/father education and\nincome variables. This model fit the data well, w2(405) \u00bc\nSES had a small and significant positive effect on K for females\nDiscussion\nOur results suggest that the Mini-K measures the same first-\norder constructs across the sexes (i.e., they have the same\nmeaning) and mean differences on the six first-order factors\nFigure 2. Final SEM models for males and females. The correlations among the external criterion variables are omitted for conceptual clarity.\nSEM \u00bc Structural equation modeling.\nRichardson et al. 9\ncan be interpreted because the item intercepts are invariant\nacross the groups. At the higher order level, the Mini-K appears\nto measure the same K-factor across the sexes, but mean group\ndifferences on K cannot be interpreted because the first-order\nlatent variable intercepts are not invariant. Specifically, we\nobserved that the insight, planning, and control intercept, along\nwith the intercept for mother/father relationship quality, were\nsignificantly higher among males, whereas the pair-bonding\nintercept was significantly higher among females. Thus, the\nK-factor appears to be more useful for examination of structure\nthan mean differences. This holds important implications for\nfuture research. If researchers compare K-factor means across\nthe sexes, they may draw erroneous inferences about sex dif-\nferences. On the other hand, inferences about effects on or\nemitted by the K-factor are less likely to be problematic.\nFinally, we found that the first-order and higher order factor\nresiduals and the K-factor variances were invariant by sex. This\nis surprising from an evolutionary perspective, as we would\nexpect larger variances in reproductive strategies among males\nIn our assessment of the Mini-K's associations with some\nexternal criteria, we found that aspects of SES (mother's edu-\ncation and income, specifically) only related to K among\nfemales. This is an interesting finding and suggests that future\nstudies should test for differential effects of environmental\ncomponents by sex. Perhaps female calibration of LHS is more\nsensitive to environment and characteristics of mothers in par-\nticular. K was only significantly related to risk-taking and\nimpulsivity among females, and the effect sizes were small.\nAlthough the available selection of mating competition indica-\ntors was quite limited, these findings are consistent with evi-\ndence that the K-factor is unique from mating competition and\ndoes not subsume indicators such as sensation seeking, risk-\ntaking, reward dependency, aggression, delinquency, and num-\nber of sexual partners (Richardson, Dariotis, & Lai, 2016;\nRichardson, Sanning, et al., 2016). K had significant effects\non both substance use factors in males and females. These\nfindings are consistent with evidence that substance use reflects\nmating competition (\u00fe) and also K (\u00c0) (Richardson, Dariotis,\nIn males and females, the assumption of local independence\nheld for the Mini-K items and the first-order factors. The items\nwere independent conditional on their first-order factors, and in\nturn, the first-order factors were independent conditional on\nSocial support and ultimately, the K-factor. For males, local\nhomogeneity (i.e., all relevant information about indicators is\nprovided by their factor) held for the items and factors, but\namong females, this was not the case for all of the first-order\nfactors. Friend social contact/support and pair-bonding had\nmoderate effects on socially acceptable substance use, holding\nK constant, suggesting that something unique (from K) about\nthe tendency to form close intimate relationships provided pro-\ntection from heightened substance use among females, whereas\nthe opposite was the case for the unique effect of greater sup-\nport from friends. Given that the selection of criterion indica-\ntors was limited in this study, more research is needed to\ndetermine how useful this factor is in terms of explaining asso-\nciations between the first-order factors and external constructs.\nFor now, our findings suggest K holds promise in that it\nexplains well the associations among its first-order factors and\ndemonstrates measurement invariance by sex as well as\nexplains some associations between its first-order factors and\nexternal variables.\nOverall Discussion\nMore than 30 studies have employed the Mini-K despite sev-\neral salient unknowns. First, the internal structure of the scale\nhad not been determined and it was not clear that a higher order\nK-factor fit the data. Stemming from this, no studies had estab-\nlished that Mini-K items were independent conditional on their\nfactors and that these factors themselves were independent\nconditional on the K-factor. Similarly, no studies had shown\nthat the K-factor explained first-order Mini-K factor associa-\ntions with external variables. It was also not clear that the Mini-\nK measured the same constructs across the sexes or other\ngroups, or that mean Mini-K differences across such groups\ncould be interpreted.\nThe first major contribution of these studies is evidence that\nthe Mini-K has a six-dimensional first-order structure including\ninsight, planning, and control; mother/father relationship qual-\nity; friend social contact/support; family social contact/support;\npair-bonding; and community involvement factors. The second\nmajor contribution is evidence that the K-factor provided a\nparsimonious explanation of the associations among the lower\norder factors at no significant cost to fit. Third, local indepen-\ndence held for the Mini-K items and their first-order factors, as\ndid metric invariance across the sexes. Fourth, the K-factor\nmeans did not have the same meaning across the sexes and\nthus the first-order factors should be used in studies of mean\nsex differences. The final major contribution is evidence that\nthe K-factor may be more sensitive to environment and more\nrelated to aspects of mating competition among females.\nThese findings suggest the K-factor may be scored to sum-\nmarize participants' locations on the Mini-K first-order factors\nand items. From a realist perspective, these findings are con-\nsistent with the notion that the K-factor is a real variable with a\nunique identity. From a descriptivist perspective, the K-factor\ncan be seen as a useful description of its indicators. These\nfindings also suggest that although mean sex differences in\ndimensions of LHS may be typical in humans, the structure\nof LHS may be invariant across the sexes. However, we note\nthat the variances on the Mini-K first-order and higher-order\nfactors did not differ by sex, which is surprising from an evolu-\ntionary perspective.\nThe K-factor did not appear to subsume our two indicators\nof mating competition (risk-taking and impulsivity). It did have\neffects on substance use, but this has reflected K and mating\ncompetition in other research (Richardson, Dariotis, & Lai,\nsome limited support to the body of recent evidence indicating\nthat the K-factor does not capture overall life history speed, but\n10 Evolutionary Psychology\nrather one dimension of a multidimensional human LHS.\nAnother unique dimension of LHS, which Richardson, San-\nning, et al. (2016) found to be statistically independent of\nSuper-K, is mating competition. Much more research is needed\nto confirm the existence of mating competition and K dimen-\nsions of human LHS as well as determine to what extent these\ndimensions are invariant by sex, race/ethnicity, developmental\nstage, and other groups. More research is also needed to exam-\nine whether our finding that K is related to SES only among\nfemales is robust.\nLimitations\nThis study is limited by the use of self-report data and it is\nwidely recognized that such data can be affected by error in\nthe retrieval processes associated with memory and self-\npresentation bias. This limitation applies most significantly to\nthe retrospective SES measures. Second, causal inferences\nbased on the results presented here should remain tentative.\nEnvironment cannot be understood as completely exogenous\nto young adult LHS due to genetic inheritance. Future research\nshould use genetic information and longitudinal data to address\nthis limitation. Such studies may provide important informa-\ntion about whether LHS development is conditional and/or\nalternative. Relatedly, in this study, we did not address the\nappropriateness of specifying childhood quality of relation-\nships with parents (Factor 2) as a reflective indicator of K.\nThis specification assumes K is time invariant and could have\ncaused aspects of childhood and young adulthood. This may\nnot be a realistic assumption and therefore researchers should\nuse longitudinal data to test it. In any case, researchers may\nelect to simply specify Factor 2 as a predictor of K to avoid\nthis issue.\nFuture studies should also test the structure and invar-\niance of the Mini-K using more representative samples,\ngiven that college students are unique in some ways. For\ninstance, it is possible that college students are restricted in\nrange on the K-factor indicators. Although other research\nsuggests this may not be a problem (Figueredo et al.,\n2014), perhaps it could explain our surprising finding that\nthe K-factor variances for males and females were not sig-\nnificantly different. It is also possible that the structure of\nthe Mini-K varies across development, as suggested above,\nand thus it will be important to test its structure and nomo-\nlogical net using data from other stages including middle\nadulthood. Finally, the data used in this study were col-\nlected as part of a larger parent study of perceptions of\nsubstance abusers and unfortunately, we were not able to\ncollect more information about environment or indicators of\nmating competition (e.g., sensation seeking, delinquency,\nnumber of sexual partners) that could have been very help-\nful in establishing the validity of the K-factor. We were also\nnot able to collect data on external validity criteria such as\npubertal timing, parental investment, and longevity. It will\nbe important for future studies to address the connection\nbetween the K-factor and traditional life history events.\nRecommendations\nGiven that the measurement invariance of the Mini-K has not\nyet been adequately confirmed, we recommend that researchers\nuse multigroups CFA to test for configural, metric, and scalar\ninvariance by sex or across other groups wherever sample sizes\npermit. Although it may not be appropriate to sum each of the\nMini-K domains and use the scores in subsequent analyses,\nevidence suggests that in the context of CFA, 2 or 3 items can\nbe sufficient to locate the correct construct (Little, Lindenber-\nger, & Nesselrhoade, 1999). Thus, in addition to using the\nMini-K to locate and perhaps score the K-factor, researchers\nmay use it in CFA models to study the behavior of its first-order\nfactors and test whether their correlates vary across groups.\nIf multigroups CFA is not feasible, we recommend that\nresearchers avoid drawing conclusions on the basis of mean\nsex differences in Mini-K scale scores. However, our findings\nsuggest that examination of sex by Mini-K scale score interac-\ntion effects (or sex by predictor interaction effects on Mini-K\nscores) should not be problematic, though more work is needed\nto replicate our findings. We also recommend that researchers\ninclude indicators of mating competition in their studies, so that\nthe broader dimensionality of human life history indicators can\nbe assessed. If human LHS is not unidimensional, this implies\nthat the Mini-K should not be used as the sole measure of LHS\nin studies testing hypotheses rooted in LHT. Finally, we hope\nthat future studies will also test for associations between\nMini-K scores and traditional life history events (e.g., pubertal\ntiming) to better establish construct validity.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nSupplemental Material\nThe online data supplements are available at http://journals.sagepub.\nNote\n1.
