    "reduced_content": "Gender Differences in Caregiver Stressors, Social\nResources, and Health: An Updated Meta-Analysis\nMartin Pinquart1 and Silvia So\n1Department of Developmental Psychology and Center for Applied Developmental Science,\nFriedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.\n2School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester, New York.\nThis meta-analysis integrates results from 229 studies on gender differences in caregiver psychological and\nphysical health, caregiving stressors, and social resources. Contrary to common perceptions, gender differences in\ncaregiving variables were small to very small. Women had higher levels of burden and depression, and lower\nlevels of subjective well-being and physical health. They reported that their care recipient had more behavioral\nproblems; they provided more caregiving hours, helped with more caregiving tasks, and assisted with more\npersonal care. Women and men did not differ in the use of informal and formal support. Statistically controlling\nfor gender differences in stressors and resources reduced the size of gender differences in depression and physical\nhealth to levels that have been observed in noncaregiving samples. The results support stress-and-coping theories\non gender differences in caregiving.\nCAREGIVING has been identified as a chronic stressor\nthat places caregivers at risk for physical and emotional\nproblems (Aneshensel, Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, & Whitlach,\n1995). According to the National Caregiver Survey, the major-\nity of caregivers (71.5%) are daughters and wives (Stone,\nSeveral theories have suggested that gender differences\nin caregivers' outcomes exist because, compared with male\ncaregivers, female caregivers face higher levels of caregiving\nstressors, have fewer social resources, and report lower levels\nof psychological and physical health. These suggestions have\nbeen made, for example, in the gender-role socialization frame-\nwork (Gilligan, 1982), the gender-role expectation framework\n(Barusch & Spaid, 1989), and in theories of labor marked\nsegregation and household labor (Ross, 1987). However, only\na portion of the available studies have found empirical support\nfor gender differences in caregiver variables (for qualitative\nreview, see Yee & Schulz, 2000). In contrast, it has been sug-\ngested that observed gender differences in caregiver health\nmerely reflect gender differences in general well-being rather\nthan caregiving-specific factors (e.g., Vitaliano, Zhang, &\nAvailable qualitative reviews have not addressed several\ncrucial questions, including whether gender differences in\nstressors, social resources, and health that were observed in\nindividual studies are statistically significant when averaged\nacross a large number of studies. Furthermore, these reviews\ndid not assess how large the observed gender differences are,\nand in particular, whether they are of practical significance. For\nexample, in the case of large sample sizes, even the smallest\ngender differences may be statistically significant but have no\npractical meaning. Although available results were heteroge-\nneous, sources of between-study heterogeneity could not be\ntested by these reviews. Finally, because it has been suggested\nthat gender differences in caregiver health may not be based on\ncaregiving-specific factors, it remains unclear whether the size\nof gender differences in caregiver health would be larger than\nthe size of gender differences observed in samples not selected\nfor caregiving, and whether gender differences in caregiver\nhealth would be explained by related differences in stressors\nand resources.\nMeta-analysis is ideally suited for answering these questions,\nbut two existing meta-analyses on gender differences in\ncaregiving variables were based on a low number of studies:\n(Vitaliano et al., 2003) used only 4. Therefore, the meta-\nanalyses could not address these questions. The present meta-\nanalysis is based on more than 200 studies and provides reliable\nanswers to these questions.\nThe Statistical and Practical Significance of Gender\nDifferences in Caregiver Stressors, Social Resources,\nPsychological Health, and Physical Health\nSeveral interrelated theoretical explanations for observed\ngender differences in caregivers' stressors, resources, and\nhealth have been put forward in recent reviews (Yee & Schulz,\nFirst, the gender-role socialization framework (Gilligan,\n1982), the gender-role expectation framework (Barusch &\nSpaid, 1989), and theories of labor marked segregation and\nhousehold labor (Barusch & Spaid; Ross, 1987) suggest that\nwomen provide more care (in hours as well as duration) than\ndo men. These theoretical frameworks also suggest that women\nmay be confronted with higher levels of care recipient (CR)\nimpairments, as reflected in the need for help with activities\nof daily living (ADLs), because they are less likely to\ninstitutionalize their ill relative. Empirical results, however,\nare inconsistent. For example, the narrative review by Yee and\nSchulz (2000) summarizes four studies in which women spend\nmore time providing care than men, but two studies in which\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\nthere was no significant gender difference and one study in\nwhich men provided more care.\nSecond, with regard to social resources, Stoller (1990) has\nproposed that male caregivers are more likely than female\ncaregivers to seek social support because they are less\ncomfortable with the caregiving role. However, gender differ-\nences in social support may be smaller than expected because\nwomen have larger social networks and more available sources\nof informal support (Antonucci, 1990). Thus, male caregivers\nmay be more motivated to use informal support than are female\ncaregivers, but they may have less access to it. Again, available\nresults are inconsistent: In their narrative review of caregiver\nstudies, Yee and Schulz (2000) found that men use more\ninformal support in four out of six studies and more formal\nsupport in three out of five studies than women.\nThird, based on stress-and-coping models of caregiving (e.g.,\nPearlin, Mullan, Semple, & Skaff, 1990), more stressors and\nfewer social resources for female caregivers are suggested to\nresult in lower levels of psychological and physical health in\nfemale than in male caregivers. However, empirical results are,\nagain, heterogeneous. For example, Yee and Schulz (2000)\nidentified seven studies in which female caregivers were more\ndepressed than male caregivers and two in which there were no\ndifferences. With regard to subjective well-being (SWB), three\nstudies showed gender differences, but other cited studies did\nnot replicate this finding. Physical health was poorer for female\nthan for male caregivers in a recent meta-analysis of four\nstudies (Vitaliano et al., 2003), but other studies did not find the\nsame result.\nA main reason for the observed inconsistency between\nstudies may be that gender differences in caregiving variables\nare often small and, therefore, only detected in studies with\nlarge sample sizes. Because a meta-analysis pools results across\nstudies, small gender differences can be reliably identified.\nThus, on the basis of the gender-role expectations framework,\ngender-role socialization framework, theories of household\nlabor, and stress-and-coping theories, we expect with regard to\nthe first research question that, compared with men, women\nwould (a) provide more care, (b) spend more hours providing\ncare, and care for individuals with greater (c) physical, (d)\ncognitive, and (e) behavioral symptoms. Women would (f)\nreport lower levels of social support, and they would show\nlower levels of (g) psychological and (h) physical health.\nInadditionto statistical significance, we evaluated thepractical\nsignificance of results. Although there are no generally accepted\ncriteria of practical significance, Cohen (1992) and Rosenthal\n(1991) suggest that a variable should explain at least 1% of\nvariance of the dependent variable, and at least 55% of women or\nmen, respectively, should be in the group with above-median\nlevels of the dependent variable. With regard to our second\nresearch question, we use Cohen's criteria and the binomial effect\nsize display (BESD; Rosenthal) for evaluating which gender\ndifferences in caregiving variables are practically significant.\nSources of Between-Study Heterogeneity\nAs the studies varied considerably in whether they found\ngender differences in caregiving variables (Yee & Schulz,\n2000), our third research question focuses on sources of\nbetween-study heterogeneity. We analyzed two groups of\nmoderator variables, namely the study quality and the sample\ncharacteristics that are theoretically linked to the size of gender\ndifferences.\nStudy quality. --Common criteria for high-quality studies are\nthe use of a probability sample, the use of theoretically sound\nmeasures, and the publication in a peer-reviewed journal\n(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). More reliable results are found in\nstudies using probability samples than convenience samples\nand in studies using well-established, validated measures.\nBecause convenience samples and studies with ``homemade''\nmeasures may overestimate or underestimate the size of gender\ndifferences, we stated no specific expectation on the effect of\nthese variables on the size of gender differences. As non-\nsignificant results are less likely to be published (the file-drawer\nproblem; see Rosenthal, 1991), we expected larger gender\ndifferences to appear in peer-reviewed articles than in other\npapers. Because file-drawer problems are more common for\nvariables that are the central focus of the study, we expected\nlarger gender differences in articles with a main focus on\ngender differences.\nPercentage of spouses. --We expected that gender differ-\nences in caregiving would be smaller in spouses than in adult\nchildren because distributing caregiving responsibilities be-\ntween daughters and sons can be based on gender-role and\nrelated expectations, whereas spouses have less choice to select\ngender-specific caregiving tasks (e.g., Stoller, 1992).\nCohort and age differences. --There is some evidence that\ngender roles have become more flexible over time (e.g.,\ndifferences in caregiving variables would be smaller in more\nrecent studies and in younger individuals who have received\na less traditional gender-typed socialization.\nAre Gender Differences in Caregiver Health\nSpecific to the Caregiving Experience?\nIn our final research question we asked whether larger gender\ndifferences in psychological and physical health would be\nfound in caregiver studies than in population-based studies not\nspecific to caregiving, and whether elevated gender differences\nin caregiver health could be explained by gender differences in\ncaregiving stressors and social resources.\nBecause there are gender differences in depression, SWB,\nand physical health in the general adult population, Vitaliano\nand colleagues (2003) have suggested that gender differences in\ncaregiver health may reflect factors not specific to caregiving.\nIn fact, a meta-analysis on depression among adults, who were\nnot identified as caregivers, found higher levels of depression\nin women than in men (Davis, Matthews, & Twamley, 1999).\nSimilarly, another meta-analysis on samples not specific to\ncaregiving found that women had significantly lower levels of\nSWB and of perceived physical health than did men (Pinquart\n& So\n\u00a8rensen, 2001). However, these gender differences were\nvery small.\nStress-and-coping models of caregiving suggest that gender\ndifferences in caregiver health can be explained by gender\ndifferences in caregiver stressors and resources (e.g., Lutzky &\nto our fourth research question that gender differences in\ncaregivers' mental and physical health would exceed those found\nin the general population, and that statistically controlling for\ngender differences in caregivers stressors and support use would\nreduce the size of gender differences in caregiver health.\nMETHODS\nSample\nWe identified studies from the literature through electronic\ndatabases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE; search terms caregiving or\ncaregivers or carer and elderly or old age) and cross-\nreferencing. Criteria for inclusion of studies in the present\nmeta-analysis were as follows:\n1. The studies were written in English.\n2. Informal caregivers of older adults (60\u00fe years) were\nassessed.\n3. Standardized gender differences in caregiving variables\ncould be computed.\nWe had to eliminate approximately 20% of the total number\nof studies surveyed, mainly because insufficient information\nabout the magnitude of relationship between variables had been\nreported. After exclusion of such studies, we were able to\ninclude 229 studies in the meta-analysis. The articles were from\nThe Gerontologist (29 articles), Psychology and Aging (13), the\nInternational Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry (10), the Journals\nof Gerontology (8), the International Journal of Aging and\nHuman Development (7), Research on Aging (7), and other\njournals (125). In addition, we included 23 unpublished studies\nand 7 book chapters. Studies used in the meta-analysis are listed\nin the Reference section. The individual studies included in the\nanalyses and the studies with probability samples are marked\nwith superscript symbols and letters.\nWe entered the number of female and male caregivers, the\ntype of illness of the CR, the sampling procedure (1 \u00bc\nprobability samples, 0 \u00bc convenience samples), year of data\ncollection, publication status (1 \u00bc peer-reviewed journal, 0 \u00bc\nother), the measurement of the variables, the quality of the\nmeasures (1 \u00bc widely used and theoretically sound measures,\n0 \u00bc other), the standardized size of gender differences in the\nvariables studied, and correlations of the study variables. If no\nexact information on the year of data collection was provided\nin the paper, we estimated a delay of 3 years between year of\ndata collection and year of publication, based on the studies\nthat had provided this information. If gender differences were\nprovided for several subgroups in the same publication (e.g.,\nfor children and spouses), we entered these separately into\nour analysis instead of entering the global association mea-\nsures. If papers reported results from one data set but for\ndifferent variables, we omitted duplicate results.\nMeasures\nWe found that caregiver burden was most often assessed\nwith the Caregiver Burden Interview (Zarit, Reever, & Bach-\nand depression was most often assessed with the Center for\nstudies), and other measures (38 studies). SWB was measured\nwith life-satisfaction scales (13 studies) and other scales\n(11 studies). Caregiver health was assessed with single-item\nindicators of perceived health (34 studies) and symptom\nchecklists (12 studies).\nWe found that the CR's physical limitations were measured\nwith indicators of ADLs and instrumental ADLs (IADLs; 34\nstudies). Cognitive deficits were assessed with the Mini-Mental\nstudies) and similar scales (13 studies). Behavior problems\nwere measured with the revised Memory and Behavior Problem\nstudies). The number of hours of care provision, the number of\ncaregiving tasks, and the number of months in the caregiving\nrole were assessed with single items.\nInformal support was most often assessed by the use of help\nfrom the informal network (29 studies) and by the availability\nof network members as potential support source (21 studies).\nFormal support use was assessed by the frequency of receipt of\nsupport from sources other than family, friends, and neighbors\nStatistical Integration of the Findings\n1. We used random-effects models (Hedges & Vevea, 1998).\nWe computed effect sizes, d, for each study. For example,\nd \u00bc 1.00 for burden would indicate a relatively stronger\nburden in women than in men by 1 SD. We recoded outliers\nthat were more than 2 SD from the mean of the effect sizes\n2. We tested the homogeneity of effect sizes by using the\nhomogeneity statistics, Q.\n3. We computed the weighted mean effect sizes, as suggested\n4. We tested the significance of the mean by dividing the\nweighted mean effect size by the estimated standard\ndeviation. Then we computed confidence intervals that\ninclude 95% of the effects for each effect size. We\ninterpreted differences between two conditions as significant\nwhen the 95% intervals did not overlap.\n5. As a tool for interpreting the practical significance of the\nresults, we used the BESD (Rosenthal, 1991). For example,\nif the same number of men and women is assessed and\ncaregivers with above-average and below-average burden\nare split at the median, then the percentage of women with\nabove-average burden is computed by 0.5 \u00fe r/2, and the\npercentage of above-average burden in men is 0.5 \u00ad r/2; r is\ncomputed by transforming mean effect size d.\n6. To test the simultaneous effect of more than one vari-\nable, we computed a weighted multiple linear regression\nanalysis.\nRESULTS\nSample Description\nThe studies we included were published or presented\ncaregiving wives and husbands, 29 studies compared daughters\nand sons, and 136 studies combined spouses, adult children,\nand other informal caregivers. About 46% of the studies\nfocused on dementia caregiving; 15% of the studies focused on\ncaregiving for physically frail older adults; and 39% of the\nstudies included both dementia caregivers and other caregivers.\nAbout 22% of the studies used probability samples. The\nnumber of participants of the studies ranged between 17 and\nexplicit focus on gender differences (as indicated by their title).\nThe caregivers had a mean age of 59.5 years (SD \u00bc 8.0\nmeta-analysis. The CRs were, on average, 75.8 years old (SD \u00bc\n5.2), and approximately 60% of them were women.\nGender Differences in Caregiver Health,\nStressors, and Resources\nIn support of our first expectation, caregiving women\nreported higher levels of CRs' behavior problems, more hours\nof care provision, more caregiving tasks, higher levels of\ncaregiver burden and depression, and lower levels of physical\nhealth and subjective well-being than did caregiving men\n(Table 1). Interestingly, when analyzing specific caregiving\ntasks, we found that significant gender differences emerged\nonly for personal care. Contrary to our expectation, we found\nno significant gender differences for the other stressors, formal\nsupport use, and use and availability of informal support.\nWith regard to practical significance, gender explained 2.8%\nof the variance of depression, 2.7% of the variance of burden,\nand 1% of the variance of the number of caregiving tasks\n(Table 1). According to Cohen's (1992) criteria, gender dif-\nferences in burden, depression, and number of caregiving tasks\nwere small (d , 0.50) and the other differences very small (d ,\n0.20). As another tool for interpreting the practical significance\nof gender differences, we computed BESDs. When an equal\nnumber of men and women are assessed, 58% of women are in\nthe group with above-average levels of burden and depression,\nas compared with 42% of men. In addition, 55% of women help\nwith an above-average number of caregiving tasks, as com-\npared with 45% of men. However, despite the fact that gender\ndifferences in SWB were statistically significant, the percen-\ntages differed only slightly for men and women: 52.5% of\nwomen as compared with 47.5% of men reported below-\naverage SWB.\nModerator Variables\nAll observed gender differences were heterogeneous (Table\n1). To test for variables that explain this heterogeneity, we\ncomputed weighted multiple linear regression analyses based on\nrandom effects models (Table 2). Positive regression coeffi-\ncients indicate that higher levels of the independent variables are\nassociated with larger levels of the outcome variable in women\nand lower levels of the outcome variable in men.\nWith regard to study quality, we found that women reported\nless depression in studies using well-established, theoretically\nsound measures. In addition, women reported lower levels of\ndepression and SWB, and more hours of care provision than men\nin convenience samples as compared with probability samples.\nThree effects of publication status appeared: In peer-reviewed\narticles, women reported more cognitive deficits in their CR,\nmore hours of care, and less use of informal support than men\ncompared with articles that were not peer reviewed. In studies\nwith an explicit gender focus, women showed lower levels of\nSWB than men, and they provided care for a longer time.\nIn samples with a lower percentage of spouses, women were\nmore likely to report cognitive deficits and behavior problems.\nFinally, gender differences varied by caregiver age and year of\npublication. In older samples, women reported lower levels of\nTable 1.

In addition, women reported more CR\ncognitive deficits in older than in more recent studies. Thus,\nstronger gender differences emerged in older samples and in\nolder studies.\nAre Gender Differences in Caregiver\nHealth Caregiving Specific?\nWith regard to our fourth research question, we had expected\nthat gender differences in depression, SWB, and physical health\nwould be larger in caregiver studies than in population-based\nstudies. Because no population-based studies were available\nthat compared the size of gender differences in caregivers\nversus noncaregivers, we compared the results of our meta-\nanalysis with those of previous meta-analyses with samples not\nselected for caregiving. In support of our expectation, gender\ndifferences in depression were larger for caregivers (d \u00bc 0.34,\nanalysis than they were in the meta-analysis by Davis and\ngender differences in caregiver physical health (d \u00bc\u00c00.17, CI \u00bc\nhave been reported in a previous meta-analysis (d\u00bc\u00c00.08, CI\u00bc\nof gender differences in the SWB of caregivers (d\u00bc\u00c00.09, CI\u00bc\n\u00c00.17 to \u00c00.01) did not differ significantly from the size of\ngender differences in adults in general (e.g., life satisfaction:\n\u00a8rensen).\nTable 2.

To investigate potential reasons for this\ndifference, we tested whether gender differences in psycholog-\nical and physical health of caregivers would be reduced after we\ncontrolled for gender differences in caregiver stressors and\nsocial support. We computed a correlation matrix of these\nvariables, based on the meta-analytic approach of Rosenthal\n(1991). We ran separate hierarchical regression analyses with\nburden, depression, SWB, and physical health as the dependent\nvariables, and gender (Step 1), stressors (Step 2), and social\nresources (Step 3) as the independent variables. In the first steps\nof the analysis, gender explained 1.7% of the variance of\nburden, 2.9% of the variance of depression, 0.4% of the\nvariance of SWB, and 0.3% of the variance of physical health\n(Table 3). After we included stressors, the variance explained\nspectively. Nonetheless, the effect of gender remained\nstatistically significant. Controlling for social support variables\nfurther reduced the amount of variance in caregiver burden\nexplained by gender. Still, gender differences for all caregiving\noutcomes remained significant. However, after converting the\neffect sizes of gender from the third step of the regression\nanalysis back to the metrics of standard deviation units (Lipsey\n& Wilson, 2001), we found that the remaining gender\n0.32) no longer differed from those observed in population-\nSo\n\u00a8rensen, 2001). Similarly, after controlling for caregiver\nstressors and social resources, we found that the remaining\ngender differences in physical health (d \u00bc \u00c00.08, CI \u00bc \u00c00.11\nto \u00c00.05) are similar to those in population-based samples\nDISCUSSION\nThe present meta-analysis expands our understanding of both\nthe extent of and reasons for gender differences by including\na broader range of indicators of caregiver stressors, social\nresources, and caregiver health in the analysis than is found\nin prior reports. We found that most gender differences in\nstressors, social resources, and health were very small. When\napplying Cohen's (1992) criteria, we found that only gender\ndifferences in burden, depression, and the number of caregiving\ntasks were of practical importance. We then identified study\ncharacteristics that moderate the observed effect size. Finally,\nwe showed that gender differences in caregiver depression and\nphysical health were larger than those observed in the general\nadult population, and, in part, they were explained by gender\ndifferences in caregiver stressors.\nGender Differences in Caregiving Variables\nConsistent with previous meta-analyses (Miller & Cafasso,\nfinding that gender differences in psychological health, physical\nhealth, and caregiving stressors are present, but that they are\nsmall or very small in magnitude. On the basis of 229 studies,\nwe found that statistically reliable gender differences appeared:\nCompared with male caregivers, female caregivers reported\nhigher levels of behavior problems, more hours of care\nprovided, higher number of caregiving tasks, more caregiver\nburden and depression, and lower SWB and physical health.\nAccording to Cohen's (1992) criteria, only gender differences\nin burden, depression, and amount of care were of practical\nsignificance. Gender differences in the provision of personal\ncare were at the threshold of being practically significant. Our\nresults suggest that there are more similarities than differences\nbetween female and male caregivers, and that most caregiving\nstressors, such as the number of caregiving hours, are probably\nmore strongly determined by actual needs of the CR and the\navailability of additional helpers than by gender differences in\nsocialization, identity, or caregiving motives, as has been\npreviously suggested.\nContrary to theoretical suggestions (e.g., Stoller, 1990),\nfemale and male caregivers did not differ in the use of informal\nand formal support. Women's more extensive formal support\nsystem (Okun & Keith, 1998) may have counterbalanced the\neffects of male caregivers' greater tendency to seek support. In\naddition, gender differences in formal support use may vary\nby the source of support (e.g., self-help group vs home care\nservices), thus reducing the chance of finding significant gender\ndifferences (e.g., Barusch & Spaid, 1989). Unfortunately, we\ndid not find enough studies addressing the effects of different\nforms of formal support to test for gender differences.\nImpact of Study Characteristics\nOn average, study characteristics explained 26% of the\nbetween-study heterogeneity of effect sizes. Less variance was\nexplained in analyses with larger numbers of studies, because\nthey include more study-specific sources of variance. Because\nonly sample means rather than the distribution of the variables\nwere available for analysis for age and percentage of spouses,\nthe amount of explained variance by these variables is reduced.\nStudy quality was related to gender differences in three\ninstances. Gender differences were larger in probability\nsamples. Because convenience samples are often biased toward\nhighly distressed caregivers and show restricted variance\n(Pinquart & So\n\u00a8rensen, 2003), gender differences were probably\nsmaller in these studies. We also found some evidence for file-\ndrawer problems: In studies with an explicit gender focus and\nin peer-reviewed articles, there were stronger (and more\nsignificant) gender differences, which confirmed common\ntheoretical frameworks on gender differences.\nWe found smaller gender differences in cognitive deficits\nand behavior problems for samples with high a percentage\nof spouses, probably reflecting the fact that spouses have\nless choice to select caregiving tasks and to avoid caregiv-\ning stressors. However, no other kinship effects appeared.\nStronger effects of spousal status may appear when comparing\ngender differences in homogeneous samples of spouses versus\nadult children.\nOn the basis of changing gender roles (e.g., Gerson, 2002),\nwe had expected smaller gender differences in more recently\npublished studies and in younger age groups (i.e., in more\nrecent cohorts). Our expectation was supported for 4 out of 24\ncomparisons. Effects of the year of data collection may even\nhave been underestimated in our study, as no exact informa-\ntion on that variable was available in many studies. Nonethe-\nless, we conclude that caregiving experiences of men and\nwomen have become more similar in recent cohorts. However,\nbecause gender roles are slow to change (Cafferata, Horn, &\nWells, 1997), only a few cohort effects were detected.\nGender Differences: Caregiving-Specific Versus\nCaregiving-Unspecific\nIt has been suggested that gender differences in caregiver\nhealth may merely reflect gender differences in population health\n(e.g., Vitaliano et al., 2003). Because previous reviews could not\ntest this hypothesis, the present study makes an important\ncontribution in stating rather unequivocally that gender differ-\nences in depression and physical health of caregivers are indeed\nlarger than those found in general populations.\nOur meta-analysis supports the explanation of gender\ndifferences in caregiver health by the stress-and-coping\nframework (e.g., Lutzky & Knight, 1994), in that statistically\ncontrolling for the level of stressors reduces gender differences\nin psychological and physical health. Because the gender\ndifferences in depression and physical health that remain after\nstress intensity and social support are controlled for are not\nlarger than those reported by people in the general population,\nwe conclude that higher levels of caregiving stressors and, in\npart, lower levels of social resources among female (vs male)\ncaregivers account for the elevated gender differences in these\nmeasures. This has implications for the design of interventions,\nbecause gender differences in caregiver health can be reduced\nby reducing women's levels of stressors. The remaining gender\ndifferences may be based on differences in resources and\nstressors that are not specific to caregiving (Pinquart &\nSo\ngreater readiness to disclose negative feelings and health\nLimitations and Conclusions\nThe present paper has several limitations. First, because\nmany bivariate effect sizes were heterogeneous, the multi-\nvariate analyses must be interpreted with caution. Second, too\nfew studies were available for some variables to be included\nin the present meta-analysis, such as caregiving\u00adwork con-\nflicts. Third, the size of gender differences in caregiving\nvariables may also be influenced by other sample charac-\nteristics, such as gender of the CR (Be\nUnfortunately, we did not find enough studies to meta-\nanalyze the interplay of gender of caregivers and CR. Finally,\nsearching for moderators for 12 variables increased the\nlikelihood that we would make a Type I error. We dealt with\nthis source of error by focusing our discussion on moderators\nthat were significant in more than one analysis.\nDespite these limitations, five conclusions can be drawn from\nour study. First, because gender differences in burden, de-\npression, amount of care provision, and quality of the relation-\nship with the CR were of practical significance according to\nCohen's criteria, interventions tailored at negative caregiver\noutcomes should include these aspects. For example, inter-\nventions may focus on actual and previous relational stressors\nand on getting help with ADL assistance. Gender differences\nare usually smaller than would be expected from gender-role\ntheories.\nSecond, we conclude that caregiving increases gender\ndifferences in depression and physical health, primarily because\nwomen experience more caregiving stressors. Third, the\nmagnitude of gender differences is somewhat overestimated\nin peer-reviewed studies and in studies with explicit gender\nfocus. This suggests that results that do not confirm common\nstereotypes about strong gender differences are more difficult to\nget published. Fourth, on the basis of the effects of caregiver age\nand year of data collection on the size of gender differences, we\nconclude that gender differences in caregiver variables are\nsubject to social change, because--at least for some variables--\nsmaller differences appear in more recent studies and for\nyounger caregivers. Finally, our results suggest that husbands'\nand wives' experience of caregiving is fairly similar, whereas\nsons' and daughters' experience may be somewhat different, but\nnot as much as one might expect. Though sons are less likely\nthan daughters to take over the caregiver role than husbands\ncompared with wives (Stone et al., 1987), once they have\nbecome caregivers, they both report similar behaviors and\nfeelings as do wives and daughters.\nWith regard to future research, we need, first, more differ-\nentiated research questions. For example, rather than asking for\ngender differences in formal support use in general, we must ask\nwhich sources of support are more likely to be used by female\nand male caregivers. Second, more research is needed that\ndirectly tests theories on gender differences in caregiving\nstressors (e.g., socialization experiences and time availability).\nThird, more research is also suggested regarding whether\ncaregiving stressors and resources affect women differently than\nthey do men. For example, it is possible that tensions in the\nrelationship with the CR may cause more stress for women than\nfor men. Finally, because there is some evidence that the size\nof gender differences in caregiving variables may change over\ntime (Schulz & Williamson, 1991), more longitudinal work is\nneeded as well.\n"
