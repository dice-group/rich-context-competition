Data were from the Hispanic Established Population for the\nEpidemiologic Study of the Elderly database and included Mexican Americans aged 65 years or more (1993\u00ad\n2000). Primary measures included a short physical performance battery, a test of walking speed, and mortality. The\naverage age of the sample was 72.0 years, and 58.3 percent were women. The observed hazard ratio of mortality\nrisk was similar for the full short physical performance battery and walking speed alone, in both unadjusted and\nadjusted baseline models. A time-dependent walking speed measure showed a more than twofold increased risk of\nmortality for individuals categorized with slower walking speed. The results also showed a linear association\nbetween continuous walking speed and mortality with and without adjustment for baseline covariates. This study\nprovides evidence that walking speed alone can provide similar information on mortality risk as does a more\ncomprehensive summary measure of physical performance. Because walking speed is a quick and easy-to-\nadminister test, findings have implications for clinical use, especially among underserved minority groups where\ncultural and language barriers may exist.\naged; health status indicators; Mexican Americans; mortality; walking\nAbbreviations: CI, confidence interval; SD, standard deviation; SPPB, short physical performance battery.\nThe belief that health care for older adults should include\nan assessment of functional ability is well recognized.

Community-\nbased studies further suggest that, of the three individual\nSPPB components, the short walk may contribute the most\nclinically relevant information about the older adult's cur-\nrent and future health (8\u00ad12).\nIn the analysis presented here, we examined whether\nwalking speed alone could provide information on mortality\nrisk comparable with the full SPPB in a sample of older\nMexican-American adults. We also examined whether a lin-\near gradient of mortality risk could be predicted by walking\nspeed.\nSetting and subjects\nThe details of the study design and methods have been\nreported elsewhere and are summarized here. Subjects were\nMexican-American adults aged 65 years or more from the\nHispanic Established Population for the Epidemiologic\nStudy of the Elderly (H-EPESE) database (13). Subjects\nwere selected from the five southwestern states of Texas,\nCalifornia, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The sam-\nple design was for a multistage area probability cluster sam-\nple that involved selection of counties, census tracts, and\nhouseholds. In the first stage, counties (a small census-based\ngeographic area) were selected if at least 6.6 percent of the\ncounty population was of Mexican-American ethnicity. In\nthe second stage, census tracts were selected with a proba-\nbility proportional to the size of their older (aged 65 years)\nMexican-American population, using counts from the 1990\nUS Census. In the third stage, census blocks (small area\nunits within census tracts) were selected at random to obtain\nat least 400 households within each census tract. These\nhouseholds were screened to identify persons who were\nolder Mexican Americans. The sampling procedure ensures\na sample that is generalizable to the more than 500,000 older\nMexican Americans living in the Southwest. The five states\nin the Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemi-\nologic Study of the Elderly sampling frame contain 85\npercent of the 65-and-older Mexican-American population\nliving in the United States. In-home interviews were\nconducted in Spanish or English on 3,050 older Mexican\nAmericans.\nThe eligibility criteria for the current study, in addition to\nnonproxy interview (n \u00bc 316), included older Mexican\nAmericans with no history of the following medical condi-\ntions: heart attack, stroke, diabetes, or hip fracture. As well,\nolder Mexican Americans had to report no limitations in\nbasic activities of daily living at the baseline interview in\n1993. Twenty-eight subjects were removed because of miss-\ning anthropometric data. No significant differences were\nfound between the older Mexican Americans included in\nthe study and those who reported at least one activities of\ndaily living limitation or medical condition (n \u00bc 1,076)\namong the following sociodemographic and health indica-\ntors: age, sex, marital status, education, smoking status, and\nbody mass index. Older Mexican Americans included in the\nstudy were less likely to be depressed (p \u00bc 0.0001) than\nthose excluded from the study.\nVital status information that included death data was col-\nlected on 1,630 older Mexican Americans. Deaths through\nformants and confirmed by a mortality search of the Social\nSecurity Administration's Death Master File. A total of 440\nstudy participants died over the 7-year follow-up.\nLower body performance-based tests\nLower body performance-based tests included a hierarchi-\ncal test of standing balance, a short walk, and five repetitive\nchair stands. For each test, a five-level summary scale from\n0 to 4 was created on the basis of previously established\nFor the hierarchical standing balance task, subjects were\nasked to place their feet in a side-by-side position, followed\nby a semitandem position (heel of one foot alongside the big\ntoe of the other foot) and a tandem position (heel of one foot\ndirectly in front of the other foot). There were five catego-\nries: 0 (unable); 1 (able to hold side-by-side position but\nunable to hold semitandem position for 10 seconds); 2 (able\nto hold semitandem position for 10 seconds but unable to\nhold full tandem position for more than 2 seconds); 3 (able\nto hold full tandem position for 3\u00ad9 seconds); and 4 (able to\nhold full tandem position for 10 seconds).\nTo test the ability to rise from a chair, we asked subjects to\ncomplete five repetitive chair stands as quickly as possible\nafter first demonstrating the ability to rise once from the\nchair with arms folded across their chests. Again, there were\nWalking speed was assessed to the nearest tenth of a second\nby asking subjects to walk 8 feet (2.4384 m) at their normal\npace. There were five categories: 0 (unable); 1 (9.0 sec-\nseconds).\nA short physical performance battery (SPPB) score was\ncreated for each subject (range: 0\u00ad12) by adding the scores\non each of the three tests, with higher scores indicating\nbetter lower body function. The SPPB was categorized in\nreliability and sensitivity to change (15). Intraclass correla-\nCovariates\nBaseline sociodemographic covariates included age, gen-\nder, marital status, and years of education. Indicators of\nbaseline health status included current smoking (yes or\nno), body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2), cognition,\nand depressive symptoms. Cognitive function was measured\nby the 30-item Mini-Mental State Examination (16). Scores\non this scale have a potential range of 0\u00ad30, with lower\nscores indicating poorer cognitive ability. Depressive symp-\ntoms were measured by the Center for Epidemiological\nStudies Depression Scale (17). The scale consists of 20 items\nin which subjects are asked whether they have experienced\ncertain feelings or symptoms in the past week (17). Re-\nsponse items are scored on a four-point scale of 0\u00ad3 with\na range of 0\u00ad60, where higher scores indicate increased\ndepressive symptoms. For the analysis, individuals with\na score of 16 or more were classified as having high levels\nof depressive symptoms (17).\nStatistical analysis\nSociodemographic characteristics and health-related in-\ndicators were compared across a two-level survival variable\n(alive vs. died), with significance tests by v2 analysis. Cox\nproportional hazard models using the PROC PHREG state-\nment (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) were used to\nestimate the hazard ratios of death over 7 years of follow-up.\nTo compare the relation between SPPB and walking speed\non risk of mortality, four sets of Cox proportional hazard\nmodels were computed. The first set of models examined\nunivariate associations for baseline SPPB and walking\nspeed on mortality risk. The second set of models added\nbaseline sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, marital\nstatus, and years of education) and health status covariates\n(current smoking status, body mass index, depression, and\ncognition). A third set of models further added time-dependent\ncovariates including a summary medical conditions index\n(heart attack, stroke, diabetes, and hip fracture), marital\nstatus, body mass index, cognition, and depressive symp-\ntoms. A final set of models that included time-dependent\nSPPB and walking speed variables, as well as the time-\ndependent covariates described above, estimated the hazard\nratios of death. Information on time-dependent covariates\nwas gathered by an in-home interview approximately every\n2-years after the baseline interview.\nApplying the LOESS smooth method (SAS Institute,\nInc.) to Martingale residuals, we also tested for a linear\nassociation between continuous walking speed and mortal-\nity risk with and without adjustment for baseline covariates.\nInflection points on the curves were estimated by nonlinear\nleast-square regression (``Marsh L''), which was then used\nto fit piecewise Cox proportional hazard models to estimate\nthe hazard ratio of mortality risk by walking speed (range:\n2\u00ad20 seconds). All analyses were performed using SAS\nstatistical software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc.), and\nall model assumptions were tested and met.\nRESULTS\nAt the baseline interview, the mean age was 72.0 (stan-\ndard deviation (SD): 6.1) years, and 58.3 percent were fe-\nmale. The mean number of years of education was 4.8 (SD:\nsmokers. The sample was, on average, overweight with\nSociodemographic characteristics and health indicators\nstratified by survival status are shown in table 1. Individuals\nalive at the end of the 7-year follow-up were more likely to\nbe younger, female, a nonsmoker, and with at least a high\nschool education. Frail individuals (i.e., body mass index\nof <22) were more likely to die over the follow-up period.\nHigh depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Stud-\nies Depression Scale: 16) were not significantly associated\nwith an increased risk of death.\nFigures 1 and 2 show unadjusted associations for the\ncategorical SPPB and walking speed measures with the\n7-year survival rate, respectively. Both figures indicate a sim-\nilar gradient of association between better lower body func-\ntion and increased survival. Figure 1 shows that 81 percent\nof older Mexican Americans who scored in the highest\nSPPB category (``SPPB - 3'') were alive at the end of 7 years\ncompared with 57 percent of those who scored in the lowest\nSPPB category (``SPPB - 0''). Approximately 82 percent of\nolder Mexican Americans who completed the 8-foot walk in\nless than or equal to 3.9 seconds (``Walk - 4'') survived over\nthe 7 years of follow-up compared with 57 percent of those\nwho were unable to perform the walk (``Walk - 0'') and\n67 percent who were in the slowest walking speed category\n(``Walk - 1'').\nTABLE 1.

The first set of models (I) tested univariate\nassociations for SPPB and walking speed, respectively, on\nrisk of death.

A final set of models (IV) examined associations for\ntime-dependent SPPB and walking speed variables on risk\nof death, with adjustment for the time-dependent covariates\nincluded in the third set of models. The results showed a\nstrong and significant association between the time-dependent\nwalking speed measure and increased risk of death. A signif-\nicant association was also found between the time-dependent\nSPPB measure and death.\nFigure 3 shows the relation between continuous walking\nspeed and death risk with and without adjustment for base-\nline covariates including sociodemographic characteristics\n(age, sex, marital status, and years of education) and health\nstatus covariates (current smoking status, body mass index,\ndepression, and cognition). Both the unadjusted and ad-\njusted models showed a linear gradient of increased risk\nof death with walking speeds between 2 and 15 seconds\nand a plateau effect thereafter. In the unadjusted and ad-\njusted models, each second of increase in walking speed\nwas associated with about a 9 percent and 6 percent increased\nrisk of death, respectively. On average, an individual's time to\ncomplete the walking speed task increased by 2.2 seconds\n(SD: 6.3) over the follow-up period. Over this same period of\ntime, the average decline in SPPB score was 1.1 points (SD:\n3.6). In unadjusted and adjusted models, each point decline in\nSPPB score corresponded with about a 6 percent and a 4\npercent increased risk of mortality, respectively.\nDISCUSSION\nThe current study provides evidence that walking speed\ncan provide a simple and objective way to assess declines in\nmobility over time in a minority population. The study also\nshowed an association between mobility decline and in-\ncreased mortality risk. To increase the clinical applicability\nof our findings, we used walking speed as both a categorical\nand a continuous measure, and results were compared with\nan established summary measure of lower-body function\n(SPPB). Also, all deaths included in the analysis were con-\nfirmed by a search of the Social Security Administration's\nDeath Master File.\nOur main finding can be summarized as follows. The\nassociation between a baseline measure of walking speed\nand risk of death was similar to the full SPPB with and\nwithout the addition of baseline and time-dependent covar-\niates. This result was not unexpected and complements\nother research on performance-based measures of lower\nbody function. For example, in an ethnically diverse sample\nof adults aged 65 years or more and living in the community,\nwalking speed alone performed almost as well as the full\nSPPB in predicting incident disability (18). More recent\ndata from a Veterans Affairs and a Medicare health man-\nagement organization database showed walking speed and\nSPPB to similarly predict risk of hospitalization (11). Other\nstudies have also shown a link between mobility and health\noutcomes including fall risk, mobility disability, hospitali-\nOur use of time-dependent SPPB and walking speed\nmeasures over 7 years of follow-up also highlights the dy-\nnamic nature of lower body function. The especially strong\nand significant association between the time-dependent mo-\nbility variable and mortality suggests the importance of on-\ngoing and regularly scheduled evaluation to identify older\nadults who show decrements in walking speed. Early iden-\ntification of change in walking speed may alert clinicians to\nrecommend medical or rehabilitative interventions that\ncould slow or reverse this trend and affect change in the\nunderlying cause of the decline.\nTaken together, the current study and previous research\non mobility (10\u00ad12) indicate the robustness of the walking\nspeed measure and support its use as a valid predictor of\nhealth risk in older adults. Moreover, because walking plays\na vital role in daily life and is little influenced by language or\ncultural differences, a number of researchers have suggested\nthat a standardized walking speed measure be incorporated\ninto the clinical setting as an instrument of health assess-\nment (10, 11, 20). Our finding of a linear gradient of asso-\nciation with mortality risk, ranging from 2 to 15 seconds,\nsupports the use of walking speed in the clinical setting. The\ncurrent study, however, does not address the question of\na standardized length of test. As a measure of clinical\nWalk speed (seconds)\nHazard ratio of mortality\nAdjusted\nUnadjusted\nFIGURE 3.

Therefore, understanding the po-\ntential advantages and disadvantages of a 2.44-m (8-foot)\nexample, would be useful.\nOther researchers have also suggested that walking speed\nbe used as a screening tool to identify and recruit older\nadults with specific levels of functioning into clinical trials\n(21). However, if walking speed is to be routinely collected\nand used in a clinical setting or in clinical trials, it then\nbecomes important to understand pathways that mediate\nchange in walking speed. From a biologic perspective, ev-\nidence suggests that inflammatory pathways such as inter-\nleukin 6 and D-dimer, independent of sociodemographic\ncharacteristics and health behaviors, are linked to mobility\nfunction (22\u00ad24). Change in these two inflammatory\nmarkers may be an early indication of impending functional\ndecline, even in otherwise healthy older adults.\nFrom an environmental perspective, pathways that medi-\nate change in mobility are less clear but may include socio-\neconomic status, access to social services, social isolation,\nand sedentary behavior (25\u00ad27). Research also suggests the\nimportance of neighborhoods in relation to mobility-related\nactivities (28). Neighborhoods with high levels of employ-\nment and green spaces for leisure have been linked to in-\ncreased walking activity. On the other hand, high poverty\nneighborhoods, which increase exposure to crime, vandal-\nism, noise pollution, and overcrowding, have been linked to\npoorer health and decreased walking activity (29, 30). Data\nolder Mexican Americans live at or below the poverty level,\nwhich suggests that the association between mobility and\nmortality risk for this group may be, in part, mediated by\nneighborhood disadvantage.\nThe current study has some limitations. First, the sample\nincluded physically healthy older Mexican Americans who\nreported no difficulty in performing basic activities of daily\nliving and who were free of comorbidities at baseline inter-\nview. By initially excluding individuals further along the\ndisabling pathway, we reduced the possibility of over-\nestimating the association between lower body function\nand mortality. However, because walking is critical to the\nindependence and well-being of the older adult, it would\nbe important and interesting to replicate these findings in\na more disabled and chronically ill sample of older adults,\nsuch as those hospitalized. A number of studies suggest that\ndeconditioning occurs rapidly in the older patient, and a fo-\ncus on understanding the factors that slow the progression of\nmobility decline in hospitals could provide useful informa-\ntion on recovery patterns. A second limitation of the study is\nthat the current findings may not generalize to other popula-\ntions and may be an area of future research. However, a study\nby Guralnik et al. (18) showed the SPPB to similarly predict\ndisability across three older ethnic populations including\nnon-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanics.\nOur study also has several strengths including its large\ncommunity-based sample, its prospective design, and use of\nan objective measure of lower body function (walking speed)\nin the largest minority population in the United States (31).\nIn summary, our findings indicate that walking speed is\nassociated with mortality and that this simple measure may\nplay an important role in the clinical setting as a complement\nto more traditional assessments of health status in older\nadults. Previous research has demonstrated that functional\ndeclines can be slowed or reversed with early detection (32\u00ad\n34). Walking speed, therefore, has the potential to identify\npersons at risk for frailty and disability who may be targeted\nfor appropriate prevention and intervention programs.\n"
