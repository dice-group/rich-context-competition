    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: A recent study examined the prevalence, clinical correlates, age trends, and stability of unhealthy\nweight control behaviors (UWCB; purging and diet pill use) in a nationally representative sample of Norwegian boys\nand girls. The purpose of this study was to provide similar, comparative analyses for a nationally representative\nsample of American youth.\nMethods: Data were extracted from the restricted use data files of survey Waves I, II, and III of the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), selecting all participants who at Wave I had provided\ninformation on age, sex, and UWCB. Using UWCB information, three groups were created (purging, diet pill use,\nand no recent UWCB \"controls\") and compared on indicators of adverse health or mental health.\nResults: Girls consistently were more likely than boys to report UWCB. UWCB were significantly associated with\nhigher body mass index, self-perception of being overweight, low self-esteem, depression, and delinquency. Prevalence\nestimates for purging remained relatively constant across the three survey waves; in contrast, diet pill use was especially\ncommon at Wave III.\nConclusions: Age trends, gender differences, and clinical correlates of change in the likelihood of UWCB between\nWaves I-III were all identified in analyses comparing purging and diet pill use in American adolescents. Females\nand older adolescents were specifically more likely to engage in pill use than purging, and individuals with increased\nweight dissatisfaction, a history of delinquent behaviors, more depression symptoms, or lower self-esteem were more\nlikely to engage in an unhealthy weight control behavior over time. While the Norwegian study found that prevalence\nof purging was lower among young adult participants, our results suggested that there were no significant differences\nin prevalence between age groups.\n",

Although disordered eating symptoms such as binge\neating, purging, or non-purging compensatory behaviors\n(for example fasting, excessive exercise, or diet pill use)\nhave often been studied in adolescence as early symptoms\nof or as proxy variables for full syndrome eating disorders\n(e.g., anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa) [4], investi-\ngators have more recently begun to examine disordered\neating as a clinically relevant phenomena even in the\nabsence of a diagnostic eating disorder, determined by\ncriteria in the DSM-5 (or DSM-IV).\nFor example, purging behaviors have received increasing\nscientific attention as symptoms of clinical relevance\nin their own right. Studies have shown that vomiting\nor misusing laxatives or diuretics to manage weight is\nassociated with low self-esteem, depressive symptoms,\nsubstance use, and impaired psychosocial adjustment\n[5-10] and also predict excess weight gain [11].

Moreover, several genetic\nstudies have found that, notwithstanding some overlap\nbetween latent risk factors for binge eating and purging,\nthere may be distinct risk factors for purging versus\nbinge eating, which warrants further investigation of\nNon-purging forms of weight control behavior have\nbeen studied less extensively, yet the limited available\nevidence indicates that these behaviors also are associ-\nated with measures of psychological distress such as\nanxiety or depressive symptoms [15]. Currently, there is\nsome inconsistency as to whether diet pill use should be\nclassified as a \"purging\" or \"non-purging\" weight control\nbehavior [1,15]. Furthermore, research has rarely exam-\nined diet pill use outside of these grouped categories, and\nconsequently little is known about the behavior itself.\nTwo longitudinal studies have reported on changes in\npurging and non-purging weight control behaviors from\nadolescence to young adulthood. Project EAT, a longitu-\ndinal study of high school students in Minneapolis/St.\nPaul (United States, US), found an age effect in that,\nover a 10-year period, the prevalence of diet pill use\nincreased in girls and boys, laxative use increased in\ngirls, and vomiting decreased in girls and boys [1]. New\ndata from Project EAT also suggest a cohort effect:\ncomparisons of two cohorts revealed that fewer stu-\ndents in a cohort recruited in 2010 reported extreme\nweight control behaviors than in the (original) 1999\nsample [16]. The second study (\"Young in Norway\") was\nconducted among a nationally representative sample of\nNorwegian school children (ages 12 to 20 years at study\nentry), contrasting purging and non-purging weight\ncontrol behaviors. In this study, diet pill use was classi-\nfied as a non-purging behavior. Age differences in rates\nof purging and non-purging weight control behaviors\nwere examined by grouping participants into four age\nwave. In both boys and girls, prevalence estimates of\npurging and non-purging weight control behaviors\ngradually declined with the transition from adolescence\nThe purpose of the present study was to determine\nwhether age trends and predictors of purging and non-\npurging weight control behaviors observed in Norwegian\nadolescents [15] could be replicated in a large, nationally\nrepresentative sample of US youth from the National\nLongitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)\nwhere non-purging behavior were limited to diet pill use.\nFirst, we tested age trends from adolescence into adult-\nhood in two types of extreme weight control behaviors in\nboys and girls: vomiting or laxative use as one group, and\ndiet pill use only as a separate group. Consistent with\ntrends observed in the Young in Norway study, we hy-\npothesized decreasing prevalence estimates with increas-\ning age. Second, we examined correlates of these extreme\nweight control behaviors in boys and girls by comparing\nthem to participants with no recent extreme weight con-\ntrol behaviors. Consistent with previous findings, we hy-\npothesized that more girls than boys would report these\nextreme weight control behaviors. We further hypothe-\nsized that students who reported purging (vomiting or\nlaxative use) or diet pill use for weight control would differ\nsignificantly (reflecting greater disturbance) from students\nwho did not engage in any UWCB on measures of body\nweight, self-esteem, and self-reported depression.\nMethods\nData source\nThe present study extracted data from the restricted-\nuse National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\nover 20,000 American adolescents over the course of\nfourteen years, with four waves of data collection since\nthe study's inception when participants were in grades\n7\u00ad12. (Wave IV did not collect data about purging and,\ntherefore, was not used for the present study).\nsampling from 132 schools in the United States, representa-\ntive for region, urbanicity, size, and ethnicity. Initially, 80\nhigh schools were recruited, and each participating school\nidentified a feeder middle school in the community, with\nthe requirement of the inclusion of 7th graders. A total of\nself-administered, in-school questionnaires given during a\nand included over 15,000 of the participants originally\ntested in Wave I. In-home interviews were conducted with\nwith participants now in early adulthood. Further details\nabout the study design can be found elsewhere [17].\nOnly participants, who provided consistent data across\nsurvey waves on birth date and gender, and completed\nquestions concerning vomiting or use of laxatives or diet\npills for weight control purposes in Wave I, were included\nin the present study. A total of 168 participants were\ndropped due to missing weight control behaviors at Wave\nI or inconsistent age and gender data across waves.\nInstruments and procedures\nAdd Health surveys included a wide range of questions\npertaining to psychological and physical health issues\nand behaviors. The variables used in this study are\ndescribed below.\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/16\nDemographic information was extracted from the Wave\nI dataset. Age was recorded in Waves II and III as age at\nlast birthday. Age at Wave I was calculated by subtracting\nbirth date from the date of interview.\nUnhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCB). A two-\npart question measured whether participants engaged in\na number of weight control behaviors. Participants were\nasked whether, in the past 7 days, they had been trying\nto lose or maintain weight (yes/no). Participants who\nanswered \"no\" were instructed to skip the follow-up\nitems; those answering \"yes\" were asked follow-up ques-\ntions regarding what specific behaviors were used to do so\n(response choices included: vomiting; laxative use; diet pill\nuse; dieting; exercising; other; none). Frequency of occur-\nrence was not measured in the Add Health surveys.\nClassification of participants based on unhealthy weight\ncontrol behaviors. At each wave, participants were classi-\nfied into one of three mutually exclusive groups. The\npurging group included those indicating vomiting or\nusing laxatives (regardless of whether they also reported\ndiet pill use) as their means of trying to lose or maintain\nweight; the diet pill only group included those reporting\ndiet pill use but not purging behaviors for weight control\npurposes. Purging and diet pill use were coded as mutually\nexclusive in order to analyze diet pill use as a unique be-\nhavior and compare pill use with more commonly studied\nUWCB. Finally, a third group (no recent UWCB) com-\nprised all remaining participants, i.e., participants who\nwere not trying to control their weight or participants\nwho reported that they had dieted or exercised (because\nthese behaviors, unless taken to an extreme, are recom-\nmended as healthy weight management strategies). Partici-\npants reporting \"other\" behaviors to manage their weight\nwere also classified into the comparison group.\nConsistent with the Center for Disease Control (CDC),\nBody Mass Index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight\n(in pounds) by the product of height (in inches) squared\ntimes the value 703 [18]. Weight Self-Perception was mea-\nsured using a single item (\"How do you think of yourself\nin terms of weight?\"). Five responses were available using\na Likert scale: \"overweight\", \"slightly overweight\", \"about\nthe right weight\", \"slightly underweight\", and \"very\nunderweight\".\nSelf-esteem was measured using four questions based\non Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale [19] that were asked at\neach wave (\"you have many good qualities\"; \"you have\nmuch to be proud of\"; \"you like yourself just the way\nyou are\"; and \"you feel you are doing things just right\").\nParticipants rated each item on a scale from 1 to 5, and\na total score was calculated by summing the items [20].\nDepressive symptoms. At each wave, participants com-\npleted a modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Participants rated\nsymptom frequency in the past week on a scale from 0\n(never or rarely) to 3 (most of the time). Using the 9\nitems that were asked at all three waves, we created a\ntotal score by adding across all items for each wave.\nand 0.80 at Wave III. Because of its skewed distribution in\nour sample, the scale was then natural log transformed.\nDelinquency. Consistent with other studies that have\nutilized Add Health data, [22] seven questions concern-\ning delinquent behavior available in all three study waves\nwere used to create a binary delinquency variable.\nSpecifically, participants were asked \"In the past 12 months,\nhow often did you: (1) Damage property that didn't\nbelong to you; (2) Steal something worth more than\n$50; (3) Go into a house or building to steal something;\n(4) Use or threaten to use a weapon to get something from\nsomeone; (5) sell marijuana or other drugs; (6) steal some-\nthing worth less than $50; (7) Take part in a fight where\na group of your friends was against another group\".\nResponses to each individual question were dichoto-\nmized by recoding the original 4-point Likert format\n(never, one or two times, three or four times, five times\nor more) into never versus one or more. The recoded\nitems were then summed. Because the delinquency sum-\nmary score was extremely skewed with most participants\nreporting no delinquent behaviors (greater than or equal\nto 59.0% at all waves), and the majority of the rest report-\ning just one delinquent behavior (greater than or equal to\n20.7% at all waves), we recoded it into a binary categorical\nvariable with a meaningful cut point (0 = no instances,\n1 = one or more instances of delinquent behavior).\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were performed using Stata 13.1. Chi-square\ntests were used first to analyze the differences in preva-\nlence for purging and diet pill use at each wave as well\nas between boys and girls. Mixed effects logistic regres-\nsion models were tested to identify changes in these\nbehaviors over the three waves for boys and girls. Mixed\neffects logistic regression analysis was next used to test\nfor age and gender trends in purging and diet pill use.\nFinally, mixed effects logistic regression models adjust-\ning for age and gender as covariates were performed to\nexamine differences in the UWCB groups on all mea-\nsures of psychosocial factors.\nResults\nSample description\nAt Wave I, data were available for 10,173 boys and\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/16\n55.99% participants included in our study had data for\nall three study waves. Efforts to change (gain or lose)\nweight or maintain weight were reported by a majority\nof participants. At each wave, about one-third of the par-\nticipants reported that they were trying to lose weight\nively). Trying to maintain weight also was reported by a\nsubstantial subset of participants at Wave I (34.28%) and\nWave II (33.11%) but was less common at wave III\n(15.10%). Fewer participants reported efforts to gain\nweight than trying to lose or maintain weight at each of\n15.62%). Only a minority of participants at Wave I\nnot trying to do anything to change or maintain their\ncurrent weight; at Wave III, about one-third of the sam-\nple (35.59%) reported that they made no efforts to\nchange or maintain their weight.\nIt should also be noted that some attrition bias was\nfound in this sample, such that men were more likely to\nat Wave III). However, neither purging nor laxative use\nat Wave I was associated with attrition at Wave II, and\nneither purging nor laxative use at Waves I or II was as-\nsociated with attrition at Wave III.\nGender and age trends for UWCB prevalence\nTable 1 summarizes the prevalence of purging and diet pill\nuse at each wave by gender. As shown in Table 1, signifi-\ncantly more girls than boys reported vomiting, laxative\nmisuse, or using diet pills to lose or maintain weight at\neach of the three waves. Additionally, because of the small\nnumbers of individuals reporting purging by means of\nvomiting or laxative misuse, the two groups were com-\nbined into one \"purging\" category, which similarly showed\nhigher rates of purging for girls than boys at all three\nwaves. Mixed effects logistic regression analyses were run\nto evaluate change in each outcome across the three\nwaves. The results indicated diet pill use increased sig-\nnificantly for men, and both diet pill and laxative use\nincreased significantly for women.\nFurthermore, because of the range of ages found in each\nstudy wave and the desire to analyze changes both over\ntime and across ages, mixed logistic regression models\nwere also tested with age as a predictor variable, broken\nabove) to ensure a sufficient sample size in each group.\nSimilar analyses were also performed to test for gender\neffects overall. Figure 1 illustrates the changes in preva-\nlence of purging and diet pill use from adolescence into\nearly adulthood, and Table 2 shows these age group and\ngender effects for both the purging (vomiting or laxative\nmisuse) and diet pill only groups against the current\nUWCB group. As shown in this table, significant gender\ndifferences were found for both purging and diet pill use.\nHowever, age effects were found only for diet pill use;\nthere was no significant difference for purging across age\ngroups. Further, Table 3 breaks down the prevalence of\npurging and pill use in each age group by wave, given the\npossibility for individuals to be classified in the same age\ngroup over multiple waves. Age-adjusted prevalence rates\nwere also calculated using population data from the 2000\nUnited States Census due to the higher number of obser-\nvations in older age groups [23]. In multivariate modeling,\nhowever, these repeat observations are also accounted for\nthrough the use of mixed models.\nTable 1 Prevalence and change in UWCB among male and female participants, Waves I-III\nWave I Wave II Wave III Mixed model\nN % N % N % Coefficient Standard error p\nMales\nFemales\naSignificant gender differences at T1 (p < 0.05), bSignificant gender differences at T2 (p < 0.05), cSignificant gender differences at T3 (p < 0.05).\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/16\nClinical correlates for UWCB\nMixed effects logistic regression analysis was then used\nto examine a range of clinical correlates separately for\npurging and diet pill use. In each model, age and gender\nwere used as control variables, and each variable of\ninterest was interacted with time in order to ascertain\nthe main effect of the variable as well as its effect over\ntime. Because of the high correlation between perceived\nweight image and BMI, these variables and their inter-\naction with time were tested together in a model to de-\ntermine whether they were independently associated\nwith purging and pill use. Results are shown in Table 4.\nSignificant overall group differences were found for\neach of the clinical correlates examined in this study,\nwith the exception of BMI. Participants who either\npurged or used diet pills as a form of UWCB perceived\nthemselves as more overweight, reported higher de-\npression symptom scores, reported lower self-esteem,\nand were more likely to have engaged in delinquent\nbehaviors. After adjusting for weight image, BMI was\nnot significantly associated with either the purging or\ndiet pill group. Significant interactions with time were\nfound in diet pill use for depression scores and self-\nesteem. Participants with higher levels of depression\nand lower self-esteem at Wave I showed a smaller\nincrease in diet pill use over time. None of the clinical\ncorrelates were associated with changes in the likeli-\nhood of purging over time.\nDiscussion\nThis study examined prevalence and correlates of\nUWCB as well as trends over time in these behaviors in a\nlarge, nationally representative sample of males and\nfemales. Consistent with prior research, UWCB were\nreported by far more female participants than male\nparticipants [1,15]. The prevalence estimates obtained\nin our sample for vomiting or laxative misuse for weight\ncontrol reasons are lower than estimates reported in other\nstudies [15], most likely due to the short time frame used\nin Add Health for measuring UWCB (past 7 days).\nRegardless of how many adolescents engage in pur-\nging, experts uniformly agree that vomiting or laxative\nabuse is a health risk behavior and should be addressed\nvia therapeutic or preventive interventions [15].\nIndividuals who acknowledged purging had greater\nweight dissatisfaction than those in the no recent UWCB\ngroup. These results are noteworthy because the no recent\nUWCB group included participants who reported using\nvarious behaviors to try and lose or maintain weight that\nwere not considered to be UWCB as defined in this study.\nThis makes our comparisons more conservative than had\nwe used a comparison group comprised of individuals\nwho did not report any efforts to manage their weight.\nPrior studies have shown that UWCB actually are\nassociated concurrently and prospectively with increased\nweight [1]. Moreover, also in keeping with prior studies,\ncompared to the no recent UWCB group, the purging\ngroup scored lower on self-esteem and higher on depres-\nsion [4]. At Wave I, the purging group was more likely\nFigure 1 Prevalence for purging and diet pill use from adolescence to young adulthood.\nTable 2 Mixed logistic regression model results for age\nand gender differences in UWCB groups\nPurging Pill use only\nCoefficient (95% CI) Coefficient (95% CI)\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/16\nthan the no recent UWCB group to report having engaged\nin delinquent behaviors; however, there was no significant\ndifference in the likelihood of purging or diet pill use over\ntime for those engaged in delinquent behavior compared\nto those who did not. Both purging and delinquent be-\nhaviors fall in the spectrum of disinhibited or impulsive\nbehavior. Reports of delinquent behavior declined with\neach successive wave in all three groups, possibly reflect-\ning increasing maturity and self-control, although rates\nof purging showed no evidence of declining over time.\nAdditional studies are needed to further explore the\nrelationship between delinquent behavior and purging.\nIt is important to note that the models testing both\nBMI and weight dissatisfaction showed significant asso-\nciations between weight dissatisfaction for both UWCB\noutcomes, but there were no significant associations for\nBMI. This may be due to the fact that a significant number\nof individuals in this sample who did not show any recent\nUWCB were also trying to lose or maintain weight. Future\nresearch may wish to investigate how these purging and\npill use groups differ specifically from those who were not\ntrying to lose or maintain weight as opposed to the no\nrecent UWCB group more broadly in order to more fully\nunderstand the differences between weight dissatisfaction\nand BMI as clinical correlates.\nOverall, our findings suggest that purging and diet pill\nuse are associated with a less favorable profile on the\nclinical correlates examined in this study. Among those\nwho reported purging or diet pill use only to manage\ntheir weight, these correlates suggest more pathology\ncompared to the no recent UWCB group, including\nhigher weight dissatisfaction, greater prevalence of delin-\nquent behaviors, lower self-esteem, and increased de-\npression. However, only depression and self-esteem were\nassociated with change in the likelihood of pill use over\ntime, and none of the clinical correlates were related to\nchanges in the likelihood of purging. Research is needed\nto determine whether educating individuals about the\nlack of efficacy of purging as a long-term weight man-\nagement strategy would reduce the prevalence or inci-\ndence of these behaviors.\nTo our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine\nthe prevalence of diet pill use in the absence of purging\nbehaviors [24]. Diet pill use was considerably more\nprevalent than purging, and unlike purging, showed a\nconsiderable increase with age. At Wave I, diet pill users\nwere significantly older than purgers. More importantly,\nthe diet pill group differed significantly from the no recent\nUWCB group on all clinical correlates with the exception\nof BMI. Diet pill use was associated with greater weight\nTable 3 Overall and age-adjusted prevalence of purging and pill use in each age group by Wave\nPurging Diet pill use\nAge\ngroup\nWave Cases (n) Population (N) Rate per\nAge-adjusted rate\nCases (n) Population (N) Rate per\nAge-adjusted rate\n3 \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\n3 \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\n1 \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\n2 \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad\nThose cells where there are no observations are indicated by \u00ad.

In\naddition, higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem\nwere associated with an increased likelihood of diet pill\nuse over time.\nIn contrast to findings from a Norwegian study where\nthe prevalence of purging was found to be lower among\nlate adolescent or young adult participants [15], our\nfindings from the Add Health sample suggest that pur-\nging prevalence remained relatively unchanged across\nthe age groups, and diet pill use was far more prevalent\namong participants in the age groups of 17 years and\nolder. Thus, the development of these behaviors may be\ndifferent for American youth, and more research on\npredictors of purging--particularly diet pill use in the\nabsence of purging--is warranted to further identify how\nthese behaviors develop in American youth.\nSeveral limitations need to be acknowledged. The Add\nHealth measures used in our analyses relied on self-\nreport, which is subject to recall errors or biased report-\ning. The time frame used for measuring presence of\nUWCB was shorter (past 7 days) than is typical in most\nepidemiological studies of disordered eating. Therefore,\nit is unclear the extent to which individuals in the com-\nparison group (no recent UWCB) may have also engaged\nin diet pill use, laxative misuse, or vomiting for weight\ncontrol purposes during the longer time frame covered\nin some of the psychosocial measures. For example, no\ntime frame was specified for measuring self-esteem,\nand delinquency was based on the past 12 months.\nInadvertent inclusion in the no recent UWCB group of\nindividuals who might have reported \"yes\" to the question\nabout purging or diet pill use had the time frame been\nbroader renders our group comparisons more conserva-\ntive. Similarly, those who reported \"other\" mechanisms\nwith which to lose or maintain weight were not asked\nabout what those mechanisms were, and therefore it is\npossible that these could be classified as UWCB.\nLimitations are also associated with several of the vari-\nables used in this study. For example, Add Health did\nnot collect information on the type of diet pills used.\nSimilarly, data on binge eating, a symptom often associ-\nated with purging or diet pill use, were not collected. In\naddition, because frequency information was not avail-\nable for UWCB, we were unable to study the severity of\nTable 4 Mixed logistic regression results for differences in clinical correlates for each UWCB group\nPurging Pill use\nCoefficient SE p 95% CI Coefficient SE p 95% CI\nNote: CESD = Center forEpidemiologic Studies Depression scale; SE = standard error; p = significance level; CI = confidence interval.\nhttp://www.jeatdisord.com/content/2/1/16\nthese behaviors. Finally, low frequency of engagement in\ndelinquent behaviors limited us to defining delinquency\nmore broadly as a binary yes/no for engagement in\ndelinquent behaviors and precluded an examination of\neach behavior separately.\nAnother potential limitation arises from our classifica-\ntion of purging and diet pill use. Specifically, despite the\nfact that this was a large, nationally representative,\nepidemiological study, the low prevalence of UWCB\nrequired that we group individuals who vomited and those\nwho abused laxatives into one group. Larger samples are\nneeded to determine whether these two types of purging\nbehavior should be classified into distinct groups. This\nmay require oversampling on these behaviors given their\nlow prevalence rate in the population. Moreover, we prior-\nitized purging over diet pill use, allowing into our purging\ngroup individuals who also used diet pills but not vice\nversa (i.e., the diet pill group only reported diet pill use\nand not purging).\nFinally, concerns arise regarding the analyses in Tables 2\nand 3 given that not every subject has an equal probability\nof contributing to the various age-specific prevalences.\nWhile the use of the mixed modeling helps to deal with\nthis issue, such unequal opportunities may present a prob-\nlem. This concern is also compounded by the fact that\nmen and individuals who were older were significantly\nmore likely to drop out of the study at a follow up point,\nand thus the results of this study must be interpreted with\ncaution.\nNonetheless, these limitations were offset by several\nstrengths. The study involved a nationally representative\nsample, and therefore did not contain the limitations\ninherent in studies of patient samples. Furthermore, the\nlarge sample size afforded us the opportunity to analyze\nboth men and women, and the longitudinal design allowed\nus to gain information on our sample over a considerable\nperiod of time (8 years) from adolescence into early\nadulthood. Finally, the classification system allowed an\nopportunity to study diet pill use, a previously under-\nstudied behavior, as a unique UWCB.\nConclusion\nThis study examined the prevalence of vomiting, laxative\nmisuse, and diet pill use among adolescents, as well as\nthe age trends of these behaviors from adolescence into\nadulthood and the clinical correlates that predict diet pill\nuse and purging UWCB. Results suggest that girls or\nwomen are more likely than boys or men to engage in\neach of these behaviors and that diet pill use, but not\nvomiting or laxative misuse, increases over time. Fur-\nthermore, results have shown significant differences\nbetween diet pill use, purging UWCB, and the control\ngroup for a variety of clinical correlates, supporting\nresearch indicating that it is important to prevent, identify,\nand treat nonclinical levels of disordered eating. Our\nresults differed from the Norwegian study in that we\ndid not find that purging prevalence was lower in\nyoung adults. Whether these differences between our\nand the Norwegian study reflect cultural differences or\nare a function of methodological differences awaits\nfurther investigation.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to report.\nAuthors' contributions\nEMS conducted all statistical analyses, contributed to Methods selection,\nprovided data interpretation, and wrote the Results and Discussion sections\nof the manuscript.
