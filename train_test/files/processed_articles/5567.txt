Citizens'nuanced under-\nstanding of the processes of teaching and learning, as well as\ntheir understanding of who schools have served, and how, is\nincreasingly important for their engagement with U.S.\nschools, especially given transformative economic and\ndemographic changes in the United States.\nInformation about teachers and the K-12 student population\nin the United States highlights a growing demographic mis-\nmatch between U.S. students and teachers: Students of color\nwill soon outnumber White students (Bureau, 2004; National\nCenter for Education Statistics, 2015), but the demographic\ndistribution of both U.S. teachers and teacher candidates\nremains largely unchanged, with the large majority of teachers\nbeing White, middle-class women (Feistritzer, 2011; Ju\u00e1rez &\nHayes, 2015; Ludwig, Kirshstein, Sidana, Ardila-Rey, & Bae,\n2010). This lack of diversity within the teaching force--where\n\"the future teachers are White, the teacher educators are White,\ntrasts with the growing diversity in the population of children\nenrolled in schools. This has been a central research consider-\nation as scholars have studied the \"continued under-preparation\nways to support the learning of effective ways to teach across\ndifference; for example, Milner and Laughter write that \"teach-\ners report their relative under-preparedness to work with chil-\ndren living around and below the poverty line,\" and, even\nmore, that \"these same teachers' concerns--most of whom are\nWhite--about teaching children who live in poverty pale in\ncomparison to their concerns about teaching Black and Brown\nIn this study, we explore how practice-based opportuni-\nties can allow undergraduate students to \"see\" the complex-\nity of teaching and to challenge assumptions about teaching\nand learning, which we argue are central to preparing an\ninformed citizenry in a multicultural society.1\nPaul Robeson, an iconic African American singer, activist, and athlete,\nfirst sang \"Ballad for Americans\" in 1943.

Even some prospective teachers believe\nteaching will be easy, only to quickly find that it is much more\ndifficult than originally imagined (Darling-Hammond, 2010).\nDan Lortie wrote that future teachers' and citizens'\nlengthy \"apprenticeship of observation\" in U.S. schools con-\nstrains their ability to analyze, learn about, and conceptualize\nteaching and learning in new ways (Lortie, 1975). Lortie\nwrote, \"the average student has spent 13,000 hours in direct\ncontact with classrooms by the time he graduates from high\nLortie, is that students'observations of teachers and teaching\nis not systematic or deliberative; instead, it \"is intuitive and\nimitative rather than explicit and analytical; it is based on\nindividual personalities rather than pedagogical principles\"\nteaching is not the complexity of pedagogical knowledge,\nteachers' assessment of student learning and adaptation of\ntheir practice, and the fluid and multiple dilemmas of teach-\ning that arise over time and across content (Lampert, 1985).\nThis study is in direct response to this problem, and seeks to\ndisrupt these normative views of teaching developed over\nthe lengthy apprenticeship of observation.\nLortie's argument is strongly related to what Tyack and Tobin\nreferred to as the enduring \"grammar of schooling,\" which pro-\nvides consistent rules and structures to schooling (Tyack &\nTobin, 1994). This grammar is conservative--it encourages stu-\ndents, teachers, and citizens to expect what they have experi-\nenced in schools; thus, it limits the potential for change, reform,\nand learning. Teachers, policy makers, and citizens believe that\nthey \"know\" how to teach because of their experiences in\nschools. But this is particularly problematic for issues of diver-\nsity; students and teachers expect others to learn as they have, to\ninteract with content in the same way, and to understand as they\nhave.This familiarity with schools, then, can complicate the abil-\nity to understand and analyze the many ways in which diverse\nmembers of our society experience schools in the United States.\nBuilding upon these arguments about the grammar of schooling\nand the apprenticeship of observation, we investigate how obser-\nvation, analysis, and teaching enable undergraduate students to\nexamine and question assumptions about teaching and learning,\nand how these prepare undergraduates to critically consider\nteaching in increasingly multicultural schools.\nPreparing citizens requires disrupting common conceptions\nof teaching and learning as universal processes, which remain\ninsensitive to the way that language, culture, and social loca-\ntion shape expectations, actions, and perception in the class-\nroom (Irvine, 1990). Researchers focused on the promise of\nmulticultural education advocate for the development of reflec-\ntive practitioners. Preparation for multicultural schools and\ncommunities necessitates being \"watchful,\" experiencing the\ndilemmas of teaching firsthand, and carefully examining those\nexperiences (Zeichner & Liston, 2013, p. xii). Reflective prac-\ntitioners use observational, empirical, and analytic abilities to\nexamine teaching and adapt to the diverse understandings that\nsurface in multicultural learning communities (Chisholm,\npreparation for diverse schools is an appreciation for and\nacceptance of \"both individual and cultural interpretations of\nreality and recognition of cultural and personal thinking and\nthe complexities of diverse spaces are not just personal, but\nstructural, requiring recognition that schools are \"socio-politi-\ncal contexts that are not neutral but are based on relations of\nUnderstanding Teaching as Intricate\nProfessional Practice\nScholars of teaching have argued that though teaching\nmight be viewed as \"natural\" work that one might be \"born\"\nto do, that it is anything but. Ball and Forzani, for example,\ndescribe the \"unnatural and intricate nature of instructional\npractice.\" Even more, they write that \"Despite the common\nview of good teaching as something that is mostly learned\nthrough experience, our argument rests on a conception of\nBall and Forzani--and others--have noted a number of\nways in which teaching is unnatural work. For example,\nthey write,\nconsider the role of questions . . . In everyday life, people ask\none another questions to which they do not know the answers.\nTeachers, on the other hand, must ask questions all the time to\nwhich they do know the answers: what is the number that lies\nIt is largely from this view of competent teaching as\nhighly skilled, professional work that the field of teacher\neducation has increasingly come to consider grounding the\nwork of learning to teach in what has been called practice-\nbased teacher education. Building out of the view that\nGoldin et al. 3\n\"making the transition to becoming a professional requires\nlearning to do things that are not common in daily life and\nthat most competent adults cannot do well\" (Ball & Forzani,\nteacher preparation, so that it can be more wholly focused on\npractice, where \"practice makes practice\" (Britzman, 2012;\nMcDonald et al., 2014). The value of practice derives from\nthrusting the student into complex, real-time dilemmas in a\nway that other forms of preparation do not.\nIn light of the widely held belief in the ease of teaching in\nthe United States and persistent inattention to the rich and\ncomplex possibilities of diverse classrooms, we designed a\nstudy aimed at surfacing undergraduate students' assump-\ntions about teaching and learning in a multicultural democ-\nracy. We reasoned that as citizens, voters, and potential\nfuture parents, these students have a substantial stake in the\nmaintenance and improvement of the United States's public\neducation system.2 We hypothesized the following:\nHypothesis 1: Engaging in a project focused closely on\nthe dynamics of teaching and learning would develop\nundergraduates' ability to analyze the complex and itera-\ntive interactions that make up learning opportunities.\nIn turn, this capacity for analysis might enable insights criti-\ncal for civic participation in schooling such as understanding\nmore deeply what goes into teaching students with diverse\nstrengths and experiences. Furthermore, all citizens, not just\nintending teachers, need more than a surface understanding\nof the dynamics of teaching and learning, given the increas-\ningly pivotal role of education as preparation for an increas-\ningly information-based economy.\nWe argue that citizens who are knowledgeable about,\neven connoisseurs of, teaching, are a critical component\nneeded to improve our current system of education. If we\nare to change broadly held conceptions of teaching as sim-\nple or easy work that is innate and prepare citizens to\nmake effective choices about education, then citizens\nneed to know more about the mechanisms of teaching and\nlearning than they might learn solely through their indi-\nvidual experiences in schools. Citizens' participation has\nbeen viewed as integral to public schooling from the\nfounding of the Common Schools in the early 1800s\n(Mann, 1846) through contemporary discussions of edu-\ncational reform (Chubb & Moe, 1990). We pick up these\nlong-held views, and argue that citizens' nuanced under-\nstanding of teaching and learning is increasingly impor-\ntant for their engagement with U.S. schools. Thus, we ask:\nHow do observation, analysis, and teaching enable under-\ngraduate students to examine and question assumptions\nabout teaching and learning?\nWe conclude this article with a consideration of the fol-\nlowing question: What do the findings suggest about ways to\nprepare undergraduates to critically consider teaching in\nincreasingly multicultural schools?\nMethod and Design\nIn this study, we examine the questions and tensions that\narise when undergraduate students analyze and examine\nfirsthand experiences learning, observing, and teaching. We\nuse constant comparative analysis (CCA; Glaser & Strauss,\n1967) to examine students' analysis of a three-part unit--the\nTeaching and Learning: Historical Investigation (TLHI).\nPositioned as learners, observers of another's learning, and\nteachers of the same unit, the students drafted, rewrote, and\nsubmitted a final paper on the nature of teaching and learn-\ning. These papers offer a window into how students grappled\nwith a \"backstage\" pass to the intellectual work of teaching\nand the diverse way that students learn (Grossman, 1991).\nTheoretical Framework\nThis study draws on the work of theorists such as Dewey\nand Piaget (Piaget, 1970). In addition, we draw upon the\nwork of Vygotski and other social constructivist theorists,\nwho emphasize the students' capacity to draw on existing\nknowledge and experience when encountering new informa-\ntion. Furthermore, social constructivism assumes that prob-\nlem solving in the context of an authentic task allows students\nto engage in an ongoing process of revising understandings\nand comprehending anew as students co-construct under-\nstandings in collaborative, social contexts (Vygotski & Cole,\n1978). Thus, the design of the TLHI unit deliberately posi-\ntioned students to engage in a moment of teaching practice\nfrom three different vantage points, working collaboratively\nwith others throughout, while engaging in ongoing written\nreflection as a way to surface and inform assumptions about\nthe nature of teaching and learning in contexts characterized\nby diversity.\nParticipants\nParticipants in this study were enrolled in a school of educa-\ntion course devoted to examining schooling in a multicul-\ntural society. Sixty-one undergraduate students participated\nin this study and 73 participated in the course. Eighty-five\npercent of the study sample identified as White; 8% identi-\nfied as African American, 5% as Asian American, and 2% as\nArab American. The sample consisted mainly of students\nwho attended suburban (77%) and public high schools (85%)\nprior to enrolling in the university. Students in this sample\ncharacterized their high school settings as serving a rela-\ntively homogeneous population of students in terms of race,\nethnicity, or economic status. Only 21% of the sample char-\nacterized the student population of their high schools as\n\"diverse\" or \"very diverse.\" Finally, 15% of the students\ndeclared education as their major at the time of the study.\nHowever, slightly more than half the students indicated they\nwere interested in teaching in some capacity (55%).\n4 SAGE Open\nCourse\nThe unit under study took place at a large public Midwestern\nuniversity in the United States in an undergraduate class that\nfulfills the university's race and ethnicity requirement. In this\ncourse, students investigated three questions:\n1. What are the purposes of schooling, and for whom?\n2. How do schools work, and for whom?\n3. What is involved in improving schools?\nAcross this set of questions, instructors and students attended\nto school's competing goals of assimilation and diversity,\nopportunity and competition. The course was designed to\nhelp students wrestle with the multiple aims and conceptions\nof schooling in a multicultural society (i.e., schools as a\nsocial and economic equalizer; Mann, cited in Cremin, 1957)\nor schools as a place centrally concerned with the learning of\nacademic content (Bestor, 1953). A central and unifying\ntheme of the course was the evolving, complicated, and often\nproblematic ways that differences have been understood and\nexperienced in U.S. schools. As such, the course traces the\nhistory of schooling from the anti-Catholic Bible Riots to the\nongoing saga of segregated schools to the movement for\nmultilingual rights. Students were supported to develop a\nperspective that is at once historically rooted, based on\nknowledge of teaching practice, and attentive to current edu-\ncational policy.\nThe instructor cultivated this perspective through three\nsuccessive units in the course. The first unit traced the foun-\ndations of public education in the United States with particu-\nlar attention to ongoing responses to differences in the\nschooling system (i.e., the advent of tracking). The second\nunit focused on developing an understanding of the practices\nof teaching and learning, moving from a macrolevel under-\nstanding of schooling to a more microlevel analysis of inter-\nactions in the classroom. The third unit asked students to\napply their developing knowledge of educational history and\nteaching practice to current policy debates, and to articulate\na stance on a critical issue facing today's schools.\nThe teaching and learning unit.In an effort to develop stu-\ndents' understanding of teaching practice, students partici-\npated in a unit of study devoted to teaching and learning.\nThis section of the course incorporated readings, lectures,\nvideos of teaching, small group discussions, and the TLHI.\nIn total, students spent 8 weeks reading, viewing, analyzing,\nand teaching during a deliberately scaffolded investigation\nof the interactive dynamics of teaching and learning. The\n8-week unit culminated with a final paper that asked students\nto develop a set of evidence-based claims about the nature of\nteaching and learning in U.S. classrooms.\nTLHI.Embedded within this 8-week teaching and learning\nunit, students participate in the TLHI, a three-part unit\ndesigned by the lead author to help students critically ana-\nlyze teaching and learning by holding the unit of study con-\nstant.3 The unit was designed so that the students could\nengage in a singular unit of learning as students, observers,\nand teachers. The content of the TLHI was purposefully con-\nstructed so that it could be used by students and teachers\nacross age levels and could be solved in multiple ways. The\nTLHI consisted of a study of the internment of Japanese\nAmericans during WWII. Twelve primary source documents\nthat consisted of images and quotations offered a range of\nperspectives on the internment of Japanese Americans in the\nUnited States. The document set included a copy of execu-\ntive order 9066, the presidential executive order that led to\nthe relocation of Japanese Americans; a map of the intern-\nment camps in the United States; and photographs and quotes\ndrawn from newspapers, interned Japanese Americans, and\nservicemen stationed at Pearl Harbor.\nThis piece of U.S. history was chosen purposefully\nbecause most students have only modest knowledge about\nthis moment in history. Of six key U.S. history textbooks,\nnone covers this more than briefly (see, for example,\nBragdon, McCutchen, & Ritchie, 1997; Cayton, Perry, Reed,\n& Winkler, 2003; Danzer, Klor de Alva, Krieger, Wilson, &\nment forefronts a key assertion of the course: Individuals of\ndifferent social positions experience and respond to events\ndifferently. So too, students interpret and respond to the same\ninformation differently, which is part of the dynamics of\nteaching and learning that this unit aimed to highlight for\nstudents unaccustomed to critically examining not only their\nown learning, but the learning of others.\nStudent as learner. The TLHI began by asking students to\nanswer two questions: (a) What is history? (b) How do you\ndo history? Next, students examined an image of the USS\nArizona, one of the ships sunk during Pearl Harbor, in flames\nand the video testimony of Akiko Kurose, a Japanese Ameri-\ncan, reflecting on her experience as a child the day after the\nattack on Pearl Harbor and her parents' and teachers' fear\nof reprisals and racism (\"Densho Visual History Collection,\"\n2011). Then, the instructor introduced students to a graphic\norganizer designed to elicit and to record ongoing thinking,\nand explained the purpose of each section.As a final prepara-\ntory measure, the instructor modeled how to use the graphic\norganizer using the map of internment camps in the United\nStates. Next, students were asked to respond to the questions:\n1. What are two likely stories--arguments or theses--\nthat these documents tell? Use evidence from the\ndocuments to support your evolving historical\ninquiry.\n2. What are some key questions that you can compose?\nAgain, use evidence from the documents to support\nyour questions.\nGoldin et al. 5\n3. Now that you have begun this study, what other docu-\nments would you need to deepen and enrich your\nstory?\nEach student chose at least three documents to analyze, and used\nthe graphic organizer to record their observations and developing\ntheories. After completing their own graphic organizer, students\ncompared arguments in small groups. Finally, some students\nshared their theses during a whole class discussion.\nStudent as observer.After experiencing the TLHI as stu-\ndents, the undergraduates observed the instructor teach the\nTLHI to a middle school student recruited from a local public\nschool. The instructor used the same resources--the graphic\norganizer, primary source documents, and content-based\nquestions, but the middle school student learned the TLHI\nin a one-on-one context. When the undergraduate students\ncompleted the TLHI, they alternately worked independently,\nin small groups, and as a whole class. This teaching session\nwas recorded and posted on a shared site so that students\ncould watch and study the episode, using it as a text for the\nanalysis of teaching and learning.\nStudent as teacher. In the final stage of the teaching and\nlearning unit, each student selected an individual from outside\nthe class to experience the TLHI. These individuals ranged\nfrom elementary school students to fellow college students\nto parents and grandparents. The undergraduate students had\naccess to an additional 12 documents and other resources for\ntheir own research on the internment of Japanese Americans.\nA class was devoted to helping students prepare for their\nteaching session. In this class, undergraduates worked with\npeers and instructors to select documents for their teaching\nsession, generate possible questions to guide their teaching,\nand complete a planning guide that asked students prepara-\ntory questions. Students prepared for and taught the TLHI,\ncollecting artifacts from their teaching such as notes used in\npreparation, their student's graphic organizer, video or audio\nrecording of the teaching session, and/or transcriptions of\nthe teaching sessions. Students used evidence collected as\na student, observer, and teacher as the foundation for their\nculminating paper on teaching and learning.\nData Sources\nThe teaching and learning unit culminated with a final paper\nthat asked students to describe their experience as both a stu-\ndent and a teacher of the TLHI as well as make three to five\nassertions about \"learning and teaching and about how these\nare affected by a host of different factors\" in the environment.\nAnalytic Approach\nTLHI paper analysis. We employed CCA (Glaser & Strauss,\n1967) to examine collegiate students' thinking about\nteaching and learning. CCA consists of a three-stage coding\nprocess in which researchers compare data with one another\nto further refine labels and establish relationships between\ndata. In the open-coding stage, each member of the research\nteam read and reread a single student's paper. We read and\nopen coded a full two thirds of the data together, discussing\npossible codes, relationships between codes, and resolving\noverlaps between our tentative labels. Our coding process\nwas guided by our interest in our main research questions.\nOnce we developed a shared understanding of the key codes,\nwe divided the 61 papers among the three research analysts\non the team. We coded the papers with 17 initial codes devel-\noped through the open-coding process. Throughout the cod-\ning process, we discussed ongoing analysis, challenging and\nrefining each other's interpretations to increase the validity\nof our findings.\nIn the second stage of analysis--axial coding--we used\ngroup discussion, memos, and more intensive analysis of\nindividual categories to establish properties of codes and\nexpand or collapse codes as needed. We collapsed our ini-\ntial set of labels into six codes--teacher actions (such as\nplanning, assessing, and adapting), differences, work of\nlearning, discovery, teaching and learning as related, and\nteaching as complex. Next, we divided the six categories\namong the data analysts and looked within each category\nfor common patterns and potential nuances in the data. For\nexample, within the category of differences, students char-\nacterized learners as bringing different learning styles, dif-\nferent prior knowledge, different perspectives, and different\nracial, ethnic, cultural, or economic backgrounds to the\nwork of the learning. Furthermore, the students suggest\nthese differences can serve as a challenge, a source of\nstrength, or simply a factor that teachers must attend to in\nthe classroom. This second level of analysis helped flesh\nout the categories, highlighting interactions between the\nconcepts. For example, in the category of student discov-\nery, students claim that discovering information on their\nown improves the quality of learning, but they also describe\nthe teacher's role in \"allowing\" such learning to take place\nas exemplified in this quote:\nIt is sometimes an effective strategy to let your students figure\nthings out for themselves instead of just giving them the answer.\nIn order to help students understand why something is true\ninstead of just how to find the answer, it is important to let them\nwork through the problems themselves and with other classmates\nbefore the teacher jumps in to give them the answer. By doing\nthis, the students will be able to reason through why certain\nanswers are right or wrong.\nIn this way, student discovery is not just about what students\ndo, but what teachers do as well. Throughout this stage of\nanalysis, members of the research team wrote weekly memos,\ndiscussed ongoing analysis, and tested and corroborated\ndeveloping theories. Table A1 briefly overviews the main\ncategories in the data.\n6 SAGE Open\nFinally, in the selective coding stage, we revisited the data\nlooking for confirming and contradicting evidence of our\ndeveloping hypotheses. We used this process to consistently\nchallenge the theories developed through the coding process.\nEach team member created a key linkage chart to show the\nrelationships between central codes in the data. We used the\ncharts to generate tentative assertions. All three initial asser-\ntions situated teacher actions and student discovery as two\npotential core categories of the data, around which the other\ncodes relate. After finding a high level of agreement among\nthe three analysts' assertions, we discussed and refined our\nthinking to create a provisional assertion.\nTo further corroborate our coding, we presented a subset\nof our data to seven colleagues with experience in qualitative\nmethods and research interests centered on the learning of\nprospective teachers. We asked these collaborators to open\ncode a subset of exemplars drawn from four of the six main\ncategories from our data. We also solicited feedback about\nany exemplars that did not seem to belong in the same cate-\ngory as other data. All seven respondents largely substanti-\nated our coding scheme with the exception of minor\ndifferences in choices of language. For example, two respon-\ndents suggested the label \"constructivist learning\" in lieu of\n\"student discovery.\" We chose to maintain the label \"discov-\nery\" because it reflected the students' own language in\ndescribing a facet of learning.\nResults\nThe TLHI created an opportunity for students to examine\ntheir understanding of teaching and learning. Our findings\nindicate that students in this study saw teaching and learning\nas highly related. They wrote that teaching is deliberate,\ninteractive work that not only involves a good deal of plan-\nning but also requires flexibility, in the moment decision\nmaking, and the ability to simultaneously meet a multitude\nof student needs. For these undergraduates, a fundamental\ntension of teaching and learning arises from the interactive\nnature of teaching. Because teaching is complex interac-\ntional work, it requires knowledge about the student, plan-\nning, and adaptation--all new insights for individuals who\nhad experienced classrooms as students, but not as teachers.\nWhat students bring to the work of learning--prior knowl-\nedge, learning styles, perspectives, and racial, ethnic, or eco-\nnomic backgrounds--is of tremendous consequence for\nwhat teachers do, and for what students learn.\nBelow we consider (a) TLHI students' understanding of\nteaching and learning as highly related, interactive work; (b)\nthe importance they placed on student differences in back-\nground and perspective; (c) their understanding of teachers'\nwork as planning and adapting instruction to meet student\nneeds; and (d) TLHI students' notion of students' learning,\nwhich they described as a dynamic process of \"discovery.\"\nThe sum of these understandings is that teaching is interac-\ntional, sophisticated work. For example, one student wrote,\nTeaching and learning are complex processes, which students\nand teachers actively engage in every time they enter a\nclassroom. On the surface, the goal of teaching seems obvious--\nto educate the students. However, a lot more careful planning\nand intricate evaluation of situations are involved when it comes\nto educating a group of students.\nThe TLHI students found that though teaching might appear,\non the \"surface\" to be straightforward, it is actually complex\nwork involving detailed planning and ongoing assessment of\nmultiple \"situations\" related to student learning. In this\nrespect, the TLHI helped students see beyond simplistic\nviews of teaching to the planning, assessing, decision mak-\ning, and adapting that makes classroom learning possible.\nTeaching and Learning as Interactive Work\nThe students in this study saw the student and the teacher as\nboth actively contributing to learning outcomes. More than\n40% of the TLHI students saw teachers and students in a\nkind of partnership that operates as \"a two-way street.\" As\none student noted,\nI have found that the most effective learning is accomplished\nthrough a process of give-and-take. The pursuit of knowledge is\nnot a one-sided effort, but a collective journey in which the\nclassroom must be seen as a forum, and teaching and learning\nmust be seen as two sides of the same coin.\nFor students in this study, teachers and students work\ntogether closely in what another student described as a\n\"complicated relationship that connects them.\" This rela-\ntionship is important because what teachers and students do\nin the classroom depends on one another. In a representa-\ntive comment, one TLHI student noted, \"Through the\ninvestigation of teaching and learning, I have been able to\nunderstand the importance of the relationship between\nteachers and students, and how each of their roles is directly\naffected by one another.\"\nOur students' understanding of teaching and learning\nhinged on the insight that teaching and learning are highly\ninteractive works. For example, students saw teaching as\ndependent upon students' engagement, and wrote that teach-\ners' reliance on students increases the complexity of the iter-\native enterprise:\nTeachers have a tough job--they are responsible for fostering\nthe learning and success of others and therefore must be able to\nchallenge students, be cognizant of student struggles and bias\ntendencies, and be able to alter their teaching to increase student\nlearning.\nThey saw teachers as \"responsible\" not only for their own\nwork, such as planning, but also for the actions of others--\nwhat students do with the opportunities and resources teach-\ners provide.\nGoldin et al. 7\nStudent Differences\nThe majority of these students (59%) were surprised to learn\nthat not everyone learns like they do, in classes like they did.\nFor example, one student wrote, \"Since every student\napproaches learning with his or her own perspective and\nexperiences, every student comes to understand knowledge\ndifferently.\" This suggests an important breakdown in\nassumptions about schooling. As another student com-\nmented, \"I was originally under the impression that there\nwas always an easier way to learn something, and that that\nwas the best way for everyone. But after observing my peers\nthis was easily not the case.\" Instead, TLHI students realized\nthat students learn differently. Because students learn differ-\nently, teachers must know their students to meet their needs.\nOn this, one student wrote, \"It is also important for teachers\nto know how their students learn, or at least to acknowledge\nthat different students learn in different ways.\"\nTeachers need to understand not only a student's learning\nstyle but also what students know, and what they bring to\ntheir work in classrooms. This point reflects a growing\nunderstanding of the importance of knowing students to be\nreceptive to their learning. This view was represented in stu-\ndents' writing. Students asserted that the social and motiva-\ntional aspects of learning are defining aspects of successful\nclassrooms. Forty-five percent of the TLHI students asserted\nthat teachers need to know them, relate to them, and make\nlearning experiences meaningful and relevant to their lives.\nTo this end, one student wrote,\nIt is important to give learning a purpose and a meaning while\nteaching so that your students are motivated to learn. If students\nbelieve that they have no reason to be learning the information\nthat you're teaching them, then they will most likely not pay\nattention or will not have any interest in the lesson at all.\nFor these students, learners not only interpret information\ndifferently based on their background and experiences, but\nthey are motivated and engaged by teachers who know them\nand connect content to their lives.\nExpanding on this point, just more than a quarter of our\nstudents (26%) acknowledged that a student's racial, ethnic,\neconomic, or cultural background was an important determi-\nnant in student engagement and learning in the classroom. In\na representative comment, one student wrote, \"When the\npedagogical content is culturally relevant to the students, they\nwill optimally learn.\" For this subset of TLHI students, what\nstudents know and bring to their classroom work is, in part,\nshaped by their social, economic, or cultural backgrounds,\nparticularly in terms of the extent to which instruction is rel-\nevant to their everyday lives. Notably, despite the emphasis of\nthe course on multiculturalism and the centrality of different\nsocial positions in shaping understanding in the TLHI unit of\nhistory, relatively few students noticed how social, economic,\nand cultural positioning might inform learning.\nA subset of students (25%) found that differences in per-\nspective, understanding, and background help students to\nlearn. As students experienced the TLHI as students, this\nportion of students wrote about the benefit of differences in\nclassrooms. For example, one student wrote, \"Some of my\nclassmates have commented that hearing the diverse opin-\nions of other students helps them to add new knowledge to\nwhat they already know.\" Another recalled,\nVery quickly my partner and I established we had very different\npolitical viewpoints. We disagreed about a few interpretations\nand our stories reflected very different concerns with the\nJapanese internment. Reflecting on this, I realize the many\nbenefits that come with a diverse classroom--diverse in terms\nof not only backgrounds, but also in cultures and in this particular\nexample, viewpoints.\nAlthough student differences pose challenges for teachers'\npractice, they can enrich student learning when teachers\nposition students to work with one another. In this way, TLHI\nstudents saw how students could be resources for one anoth-\ner's learning.\nThe Role of the Teacher: Planning and Adapting\nStudents experienced and wrote about \"difference\" in two\ncontexts: the impact difference has on students' learning and\non teacher's actions. One student wrote, \"Every student\ncomes to class with a unique learning style and perspective,\nand, it is the teacher's mission to teach the same information\nto every student despite those discrepancies.\" For these stu-\ndents, difference seemed to be a natural part of a classroom\nenvironment, and teachers must adapt to an array of under-\nstandings, viewpoints, strengths, weaknesses, and needs.\nAlthough these students acknowledged that teacher actions\nin response to student difference often contributed to the dif-\nficulty and complexity of teaching, they saw how teachers\nreact to difference is a vital component of effective instruc-\ntion. For the TLHI students, teachers respond to student dif-\nferences by preparing \"for variability,\" \"identify[ing] the\nlearners' strengths and weaknesses,\" \"mak[ing] the school-\nwork fit each student's style of learning,\" and \"explain[ing]\ndifferent concepts in different ways.\" One student wrote,\n\"Each student has a unique type of learning style as well as\ndifferent cultural backgrounds; therefore teachers must be\nflexible to match the needs of their students.\" TLHI students\nnot only viewed difference as a challenge to teachers but also\nargued that difference should inform and even determine a\nteacher's pedagogical choices and behavior. Students wrote\nthat teachers should constantly adapt to student understand-\nings and differences.\nSeeing teaching and learning as highly interactive, stu-\ndents felt teachers needed to be able to \"expect the unex-\npected\" and engage in detailed planning as well as\nin-the-moment adjustments. For instance, one student wrote,\n8 SAGE Open\nThe teacher needs to be prepared for the unexpected, the lesson\nplan may not go the way that they exactly planned, or the\nstudents may ask questions that the teacher doesn't expect or\ncover in the lesson plan. It is important for the teacher to be able\nto answer these questions or change the lesson plan on the fly;\notherwise the class won't run as smoothly.\nFor these students, teachers need to demonstrate a kind of\nnimbleness, flexibly altering plans in the moment. Although\nthe students recognized the value of planning, they noted,\n\"While a teacher can plan out a lesson, they cannot plan their\nstudents' reactions, forcing teachers to deal with reactions as\nthey come.\" As such, students wrote that teachers must both\nplan for the unexpected by preparing in an organized way\nand be able to alter their lesson plan fluidly, in the moment.\nAlthough students saw adapting to students as a challenging\nbut indispensable aspect of teaching, they also recognized\nthe benefits that stem from the interactive nature of teaching\nand learning. One student wrote,\nI learned to be prepared for things to possibly go in directions\nyou don't expect. Obviously it is still important to keep the goals\nin mind, but sometimes the most profound learning can be a\ncomplete surprise even to the teacher.\nTLHI students wrote that teachers' practice should be\nresponsive and iterative, and that they need to adapt their\nwork precisely because of the interactional nature of teach-\ning and learning. They asserted that teachers adapt to the\nunexpected by \"over-preparing,\" organizing, preparing for\nunexpected questions and preparing for the unforeseen. For\nexample, one student wrote,\nAnother large segment of what I learned is to prepare oneself for\nthe unforeseen. While this is a metaphor, the premise remains\nunchanged when you apply it to the instruction of a child; they\ncan ask surprising questions and construct strange truths of their\nown. A teacher must strive to allow his or her lesson plan to not\nbe diminished by an unknown question, but strengthened by the\nwant of students to explore a concept further.\nThe TLHI students wrote that the highly interactive nature of\nteacher necessitates that teachers plan for the unexpected in\nadvance of teaching, and that they adapt their practice while\nteaching to accommodate their students' needs and learning\ngoals.\nInterestingly, the TLHI unit occasioned students' under-\nstanding of the differences that students bring to the class-\nroom and how those differences bring about diverse\nresponses to learning opportunities in the classroom. For the\nTLHI students, diverse and unexpected understandings\nrequire a nimble teacher, capable of adapting instruction\naccording to in-the-moment interactions in the classroom.\nThis conception of classroom learning derives, at least in\npart, from the fact that the TLHI unit did not help the stu-\ndents, in this study, see how individual students wrestle with\nlearning challenges in patterned ways, which help teachers\nanticipate common problems and misconceptions during\nplanning and classroom instruction. Consequently, as first-\ntime instructors, the TLHI students could not see how some\nstudent responses might cease to be \"unexpected\" after\nincreased teaching experience.\nThe Role of Student Discovery\nJust above 60% of students wrote of the importance of stu-\ndent discovery. Students asserted that teacher adaptation and\nstudent discovery are highly related--that is, teachers must\nadapt to \"let\" students discover:\nFor teaching, I found that in order to be able to make sure that a\nstudent gets as much as he or she can out of a lesson a teacher\nmust be able to adapt to different situations, and that allowing\nstudents to work things out on their own, with only giving\nleading questions when needed, can be a great tool while\nteaching them because instead of spitting back out what they\nwere just told, the students form their own ideas.\nBecause teaching and learning are carried out in interaction\nwith others, teachers must continuously be responsive to\nwhat students bring to their work. One student described this\nrelationship by writing, \"Everyone brings a different per-\nspective to the classroom and it is important to cultivate that\nby letting their own ideas grow.\"\nTeachers are also, in this view, dependent upon students\nas much as students are dependent upon teachers. Thus, \"dis-\ncovery\" is not only what students do to learn but also what\nteachers enable. Describing how teachers enable student dis-\ncovery, one student wrote,\nI began to think about the value of the \"Ah-Ha\" moment. Like\nthe very first video we watched in class and the debate over if six\nwas odd or even, the teacher took the back seat and allowed self-\ndiscovery to occur. (Mathematics Teaching and Learning to\nA second student described teachers' work by saying,\n\"Teachers must help without doing.\" For the TLHI students,\nthe work of teaching involves letting students do the work--\nanalyzing, questioning, and discussing information. Teachers\nenable student work by providing resources and adapting to\nstudent understandings, but they cannot learn for students.\nAccording to our students, self-discovery is important\nbecause it makes learning more \"memorable,\" it enables stu-\ndents to \"learn deeply,\" and it is \"motivating.\" One student\nwrote, \"In learning, a student's direct discovery, or the pro-\ncess of finding knowledge and information for oneself, cre-\nates a more memorable and effective experience because\nthese connections are being made inside the student's head.\"\nEmphasizing the value of such learning, our students con-\ntrasted insights that their learners discovered on their own\nwith information that is \"regurgitated\" or \"spitting back out\nGoldin et al. 9\nwhat they [learners] were just told.\" For the TLHI students,\nstudent discovery created conceptual understanding, which\nthey recognized as more valuable than more superficial dem-\nonstrations of learning such as memorization.\nStudents wrote that adaptive teaching and self-discovery\ncan lead to sophisticated learning. For example, one student\nwrote, \"by fostering an environment of student self-discov-\nery, teachers of students of all grade-levels are capable of\neliciting high-level, analytical theory building.\" But, they\nascertained that enacting adaptive teaching and engaged\n\"discovery\" is challenging work. For example, one student\nwrote,\nIt is extremely important but difficult for educators not to simply\ntell students what they want to know. While it may seem easier,\nthis is a disservice to students because it inhibits them from\nformulating their own, unbiased ideas. It is both a challenge for\nthe student to come up with conclusions on their own and a\nchallenge for the teacher to let students come to conclusions on\ntheir own. But this challenge ultimately pays off.\nTLHI students concluded that teaching is challenging work\nthat necessitates time, skill, and effective teaching practices.\nThey also found that negotiating these challenges \"pays off\"\nby positioning students to come to their own conclusions.\nThe Complexity of Teaching and Learning\nThe TLHI students saw students as taking up or using the\nresources and opportunities that teachers make available.\nThey wrote that students must engage with content and each\nother if they are to learn. According a prominent role to indi-\nvidual student differences, students noted that teaching is\nchallenging precisely because classrooms consist of a multi-\nplicity of individuals. In a representative statement, one stu-\ndent wrote, \"trying to understand my single learner in\nteaching Japanese internment and cater to her needs was dif-\nficult enough, even while it lacked the complexities of a\nlarger classroom that is more typical of the American educa-\ntion system.\" Students wrote that classrooms are comprised\nof individual students who understand and take up work with\ntheir teachers and content in differential ways: \"As a teacher\nnext year, I am likely to be charged with negotiating students\nof all different backgrounds, aptitudes, abilities, and work\nethic.\" Because effective instruction necessitates adaptive\nteaching practice, individual student differences challenge\nteachers' work. One student wrote,\nHaving students with varied learning styles and differing\ninterpretations of information poses a challenge because the\nteacher must find a balance between teaching styles so that all\nstudents have a chance to learn in a way that suits them and how\nthey interpret the information.\nSchooling in a democratic, multicultural society necessitates\nthis careful balancing between the individual and the group;\n\"finding that balance\" contributes to the complexity of\nteaching.\nA key theme that emerged from the data has to do with the\ncomplexity of teaching; nearly three quarters of our students\nwrote about the complexity of the work of teaching. Students\nwrote that the interactional nature of teaching makes it a fun-\ndamentally complex endeavor. One student asserted,\nI used to view teaching as a simple task with few issues until I\nbegan researching only to find how many issues and dilemmas\nteachers are faced with on a daily basis--from large scale issues\nsuch as time management within the classroom to smaller scale\nissues, which need to be dealt with in the moment like not\nknowing the correct answer to a question.\nStudents wrote that teaching is complex because teachers\nneed to continually weigh the efficacy of different teacher\nmoves, because teachers are dependent upon student work\nfor learning outcomes, and because student differences sig-\nnificantly affect how and what students learn and understand.\nStudents wrote that the in-the-moment work of teaching\nmakes managing this work particularly complex: \"when\nteaching, teachers need to be alert the whole time and they\nneed to make decisions every minute.\"\nA subset of students--nearly a third--wrote that prior to\ntheir systematic study of the practices of teaching and learn-\ning, they had not seen teaching as complex:\nI have come to appreciate the complexity and richness behind\nboth the process of teaching and of learning. Before this, I\nviewed teaching as an easy task, and learning as a simple\nundertaking done in one way, with nothing from the past having\nan effect. However, I now realize how truly wrong I was in both\nof these views.\nThese students reported that they revised their views of\nteaching. They wrote that this unit helped them to perceive\nand appreciate aspects of the work of teaching that had been\ninvisible when they were students themselves. As one stu-\ndent noted, \"I honestly went in to the experience thinking\nthat it would be easy because I have been attending class and\nwatching how professors have taught throughout my entire\nlife.\" For this subset of students, their lengthy experience in\nschools as students led them to see teaching as relatively\nsimple work that they were prepared to do.\nIn this way, students challenged the previously held views\nof teaching and learning. The invisible became visible, as\none student wrote,\nSimply sitting back and watching Professor Author teach Sean\nand even while she was teaching our own class the lesson, I was\nunable to fully grasp how much preparation teaching a lesson\nwell, really takes, and this was until I had to begin to try to teach\nthe lesson myself. I think that there is a lot of outside work that\na teacher must do to make the lesson a success that the learner\noften does not see or may even overlook. Most importantly,\nthough, I think that it is this preparation work that really makes\na lesson a success or a failure.\nSimilarly, another student wrote, \"after being a student for so\nmany years, having the opportunity to teach allowed me to\nunderstand the difficulty that is teaching.\" Thus, studying\nteaching in the TLHI disrupted students' views of the cogni-\ntive and professional demands of teaching.\nDiscussion\nIn 1893, J. M. Rice decried the paucity of citizens' \"intelli-\ngent interest\" in schools:\nIn the large majority of instances the people take absolutely no\nactive interest in their schools. I do not here refer to that form of\ninterest which manifests itself on the part of the citizens of most\nlocalities in a certain pride in their own particular schools, which\nthey consider the best in the country, but which pride is founded\nneither on a knowledge of what is going on in other schools, or\neven in their own schools, nor upon the slightest knowledge of\nthe science of education; but I refer to an intelligent interest, an\ninterest sufficiently deep to lead one to follow closely the actions\nof the board of education, the superintendent, and the teachers,\nand to seek some knowledge of the scientific development of\nchildren. If but one parent in a hundred would be interested to\nthis extent, I believe that most of our flagrant educational evils\nTo Rice, citizens' knowledge about teaching and learning\nwould be so powerful as to eliminate the \"educational evils\"\nof his day. The research we report here takes up these very\npoints. We argue that recent educational reforms overlook a\ncritical component needed to improve our current system of\neducation--citizens who are knowledgeable about, even\nconnoisseurs of, teaching. Such a connoisseurship rests on\ntwo central understandings: teaching (a) is intricate profes-\nsional practice and (b) is informed by diversity in multicul-\ntural democracies.\nTo date, scholars have written about practice-based pro-\nfessional teacher education, and how \"making practice the\ncore of teachers' professional preparation\" is critical for\naddressing the \"common views of teaching as idiosyncratic\nWe extend scholars' interest in practice-based education, as\nwe design and research a practice-based unit and study its\nuse in an undergraduate course with students who are inter-\nested in education, but do not necessarily plan to pursue a\ndegree in education. This is critical, for many scholars have\nargued that teachers face a \"dilemma\" as they \"carry out their\nwork in the face of students who, guided by years of memo-\nries, filter and interpret teacher education coursework\naccording to their preconceived beliefs about how to teach\"\nate students to reenvision schooling as a preparation for\ncitizenship.\nWe investigated the following questions: How do obser-\nvation, analysis, and teaching experience enable undergradu-\nate students to examine and question assumptions about\nteaching and learning? What does this suggest about ways to\nprepare undergraduates to critically consider teaching in\nincreasingly multicultural schools? Leveraging the power of\npractice-based experience, students engaged in a three-part\nstudy, which positioned them as students, observers, and\nteachers of a unit on Japanese internment. The TLHI worked\nas a scaffold for generating insights about the nature of teach-\ning and learning not typically available to students, because\nstudents had access not only to their own learning but also to\npoints of comparison made possible by examining the learn-\ning of others. In structure and content, the TLHI aimed to\ndisrupt common conceptions about the ease of teaching as\nwell as restricted and homogenizing conceptions of learning\npreferences and processes.\nIn terms of students' developing understanding of teach-\ning as intricate professional practice, we report that students\nengaged in nuanced ways of thinking about teaching and\nlearning. Specifically, these undergraduates argued that stu-\ndents bring important differences to the classroom, that what\nteachers do depends on students and their developing under-\nstanding and sense making, that teaching consists of plan-\nning and adapting in the moment, and that teaching is\ncomplex interactional work. Each of these represents an\nincreasing connoisseurship of teaching developed by engag-\ning in the instructional planning, decision making, assess-\nment and other practices that are normally hidden from the\nview of students (Grossman, 1991). Even more, this cuts\nagainst the view of teaching as \"natural,\" and instead, privi-\nleges the view of \"teaching as a highly skilled practice, one\nRice wrote two centuries ago, without knowledge about and\nunderstanding of the work of the teaching, ordinary citizens'\nabilities to make important decisions--as voters, citizens,\nand parents--are constrained.\nLimitations\nThe TLHI offers a promising beginning for how to prepare\nundergraduate students for a lifetime of engagement with\npublic schooling. Recent reforms assume that individuals\nhave the necessary knowledge to make choices about school-\ning simply because as Kaestle notes, \"Everybody's been to\nfourth grade\" (Kaestle, 1992, p. 27). As research into every-\nday citizens' \"apprenticeship of observation\" in schools sug-\ngests, simply experiencing teaching as students offers a\nshallow preparation for understanding the complexity of\nteaching and learning. The TLHI made this complexity more\ntransparent for the TLHI students in this study. However, this\nstudy represents only one particular context. We need to\nknow more about how other individuals in other contexts\nmight take up such a \"backstage\" pass to teaching (Grossman,\n1991). By inviting a larger and more diverse number of\ncitizens to analyze the complex, iterative interactions that\noccur in teaching and learning, the value of initiating citizens\ninto the complexity of teaching can be better understood.\nEvidence from this study suggests that the TLHI offers\nsomething on which to build. Even over a short period, TLHI\nstudents demonstrated insight into teaching and learning that\nwent beyond what one might conclude from everyday expe-\nrience. The TLHI was designed to plant seeds--new insights\nand ways of thinking--that would continue to grow. Long-\nterm study is needed to determine to what extent this type of\nengagement influences future thinking and decision making\nabout education. Although it is clear that recent reform\nefforts overlook enhancing the knowledge of everyday citi-\nzens, further study is needed to determine the extent to which\nunits such as the TLHI substantively address this need over\nthe long term.\nImplications\nThis study's findings are important for efforts to enrich the\npractices and pedagogy of postsecondary education. As citi-\nzens who will make important decisions about schooling, all\nundergraduates need to understand the complex interactional\nwork of teaching and learning, not just intending teachers. At\nthe start of this article, we asked the following: What do the\nfindings suggest about ways to prepare undergraduates to\ncritically consider teaching in increasingly multicultural\nschools? In part, this study illuminates how practice-based\nopportunities can allow individuals to \"see\" the complexity\nof teaching and to challenge assumptions about teaching and\nlearning. We assert that a fundamental means to do this is to\nposition students to critically analyze teaching from multiple\nperspectives. Feiman-Nemser and Remillard wrote that\n\"deeply rooted . . . views of teaching and learning are unlikely\nto change unless alternative experiences challenge their\nvalidity\" (Feiman-Nemser & Remillard, 1995, p. 9). This\nunit provided students the opportunity to challenge existing\nviews and \"discover\" for themselves the complexity of\nteaching. This discovery is important because as U.S. school-\ning shifts toward a system in which citizens are consumers,\nparents are increasingly required to make informed choices\nbetween possible school placements for their children.\nPostsecondary education needs to play a role in preparing\ncitizens for this kind of civic engagement.\nOur research shows that this firsthand investigation of\nteaching and learning enabled undergraduates to understand\nthat teaching is a profoundly multifaceted practice. Students'\nemerging understanding of teaching allowed them to better\nunderstand how it is that education plays out in a multicul-\ntural society. Enabling students to see that \"we all learn dif-\nferently\" is important because it facilitates citizens' abilities\nto understand the multiple and complex demands of teaching\nin an increasingly diverse society. It also highlights the ben-\nefits derived from working closely with others with diverse\nbackgrounds and experiences. Schooling in a democratic,\nmulticultural society necessitates a careful balancing between\nthe individual and the group. Teaching can be challenging\nprecisely because classrooms consist of a multiplicity of\nindividuals, but it can be rewarding for teachers and students\nas well because both teachers and students learn from the\ninsights of others.\nAlthough the students in this study recognized that stu-\ndents bring differences to the classroom, which shape their\nunderstanding and necessitate a responsive teacher, the\nmajority of TLHI students did not see these differences as\narising from diverse experiences or perspectives shaped by\nracial, ethnic, economic, or cultural backgrounds. The course\nin which the TLHI took place focused on schooling as a\nsocially shaped enterprise through which society negotiated\ntensions over social, economic, and cultural differences. The\ntensions charted in the course ranged from the earliest years\nof public schools (i.e., sectarian violence between Catholics\nand Protestants over the reading of the Lord's Prayer) up to\nmore present-day concerns such as the struggle for bilingual\nresources in schools, powerfully dramatized by the student-\nled protests in Crystal City, Texas, in the early 1970s\n(Mondale & Patton, 2001). Yet, TLHI students, in their anal-\nysis of teaching and learning, did not attribute the unique\nperspectives of students that they saw as so pivotal to learn-\ning to the social, economic, and cultural differences that\nshape students' experiences and perspectives. Instead, they\nmade more general claims about the nature of each individu-\nal's unique life experience and perspective.\nFurthermore, the TLHI unit foregrounded the disparate\nperspectives of citizens who occupied different social posi-\ntions with regard to Japanese internment, showing how the\nsame event can be experienced and interpreted in vastly dif-\nferent ways by individuals in a diverse society. The varied\ninterpretations of events were reflected not only in the docu-\nments provided for study but also in the TLHI students'\ndeveloping theories that derived from analysis of these docu-\nments. Despite this heavy emphasis on the ways that race,\nethnicity, economic status, and cultural background inform\nand shape individuals' opportunities for learning and experi-\nence of those opportunities, the TLHI unit made the role of\nsocial, economic, and cultural backgrounds in learning trans-\nparent for some, but not all the students in this study. This\nfinding suggests that a single course is not sufficient to\nexpand undergraduate students' understanding of the role of\ndiversity in social life. As detailed here, the demographics of\nthe course under study reflect the lack of diversity in the\nteaching force, as 85% of the study sample identify as White.\nWe reflect again here on the demographics of the study,\nand the difficulty of changing minds around issues of diver-\nsity, and of the broad scholarship on White fragility\nongoing efforts may be needed to make racial, ethnic, eco-\nnomic, and cultural differences salient to students, especially\nthose who have attended largely homogeneous school con-\ntexts such as the students in this study. Indeed, this finding\nechoes calls for preparation for multicultural communities to\nnot reside in single classes, but to permeate the curriculum in\nmodal experience, whereby \"many white people have never\nbeen given direct or complex information about racism\nbefore, and often cannot explicitly see, feel or understand it\"\nThe students in this study recognized a multiplicity of dif-\nferences in the classroom, but were unable to see the pat-\nterned ways that students respond to particular content and\nlearning arrangements. Consequently, the TLHI students\nimagined classrooms in which teachers were left to respond\nin the moment to unknown and unpredictable challenges. In\nthis way, the TLHI unit enabled students to see the complex\ndemands of teaching, but offered less access to the ways that\nexperienced teachers learn to grapple with these challenges\nover time. The inability of students to see patterns in stu-\ndents' responses suggests the need for complementary expe-\nriences that provide the opportunity for students to see\ncommon responses and perspectives as well as differences in\nthe classroom.\nParticipation in the TLHI led students to write that they\ncould \"see\" teaching and learning as they had not seen\nbefore. As we, as a nation, continue to invest substantial\nresources to improving schools, \"seeing\" the complexity\nof teaching practice is important for the construction and\nsupport of policies, which will support what researchers\nhave called \"ambitious\" (Lampert, 2005; Lampert &\nminded\" teaching--teaching that encourages students to\nask, explain, and problem solve, and that positions all stu-\ndents as capable of learning sophisticated, challenging\nacademic content (Feiman-Nemser, 2001). Such teaching\nis possible when it is understood, valued, and protected\nfrom calls to diminish intellectual engagement for a focus\nsolely on basic skills. Recognizing that learning is a pro-\ncess of intellectual \"discovery\" is a seemingly simple\ninsight, which supports teaching that positions students as\ncapable, critical thinkers, rather than passive consumers of\ninformation. Preparing all undergraduate students to\nunderstand and appreciate the complexity of teaching in\nincreasingly diverse schooling contexts offers an impor-\ntant way to protect and advance ambitious teaching, a core\nresource for democratic societies.\nTable A1.
