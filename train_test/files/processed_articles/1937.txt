This growth is unlikely to be explained by changes in obesity rates.\nDiscussion: Weight/height discrimination is highly prevalent in American society and increasing at disturbing rates.\nIts prevalence is relatively close to reported rates of race and age discrimination, but virtually no legal or social\nsanctions against weight discrimination exist.\nOverweight and obese individuals are vulnerable to negative\nsocietal attitudes, stigma, and prejudice (1,2). Weight bias\nhas been documented in multiple settings including places of\nemployment (3,4), health-care facilities (4\u00ad6), educational insti-\ntutions (7\u00ad9), and close interpersonal relationships with friends\nand family -members (4). The consequences of weight bias are\nsignificant for overweight children and adults, with both imme-\ndiate and potentially long-term adverse outcomes for emotional\nDespite the accumulation of evidence on this topic, little is\nknown about the specific prevalence and patterns of weight\ndiscrimination in the United States. Discrimination is distinct\nfrom prejudice and negative attitudes in that it refers to unequal\ntreatment of people because of their membership to a particular\ngroup (15). To date, little work has documented the prevalence\nof discriminatory experiences perceived by obese individuals,\nand whether this has changed over time. One exception is the\nstudy examining the frequency of institutional and interpersonal\ndiscrimination in a nationally representative random sample\nDevelopment in the United States (MIDUS) (16). Its findings\nshowed that compared to normal weight peers, obese persons\nreported significantly more frequent daily \ndiscrimination,\nwork- and health-related discrimination. Individuals in the\nhighest obese categories were 40\u00ad50% more likely to report\ndiscrimination than normal-weight persons.\nTo our knowledge, no other published work has documented\nprevalence patterns of weight discrimination in the United\nStates, and important questions remain. First, no longitudi-\nnal investigations have been conducted to determine whether\nrates of weight discrimination have changed over time. Second,\nit is informative to understand the prevalence of weight dis-\ncrimination compared to other forms such as race and gender\ndiscrimination to place it in a social context for discussions of\nbias-prevention programs, possible legal remedies, and more.\nIn contrast to more widely recognized social stigmas such as\ngender or race that have legal sanctions in place to protect\nindividuals from discrimination, there are no federal laws to\nprohibit weight discrimination, and it is unknown how weight\ndiscrimination compares in strength or prevalence to discrimi-\nnation based on these attributes. Examining the vulnerabi\nlity of individuals to discrimination based on weight vs. other\nattributes will be important to determine the scope of inter-\nvention and legal remedies potentially needed to address this\nsocietal issue.

Data were drawn from a nationally\nrepresentative random sample of American adults in the MIDUS\ncore sample, comparing the first wave of data (from 1995 to\nMethods And Procedures\nSample\nThe MIDUS is an interdisciplinary study of behavioral, psychological,\nand social factors involved in midlife health and well-being.

We therefore excluded respondents who were 25\u00ad34\nincluded individuals with incomplete or inconsistent data on discrimi-\nnation-related questions (e.g., reporting a cause for discrimination but\nno discriminatory experiences, citing experiences of discrimination but\ngiving no reason for discrimination). As a result of all exclusions, our\nOur study objectives aimed to (i) determine how the prevalence of\nweight/height discrimination among US adults changed between the\ncontributors to the observed trends in weight/height discrimination),\nand (ii) compare changes over time across different forms of discrimi-\nnation. We treated the data from the two MIDUS waves as two cross-\nsections. We did not examine discrimination exposure among the same\nrespondents 10 years apart, because our aim was to capture patterns of\ndiscrimination over time for an average representative American adult.\nLimiting the trend analysis to participants who experienced discrimi-\nnation in the first wave of data collection and tracking their discrimina-\ntory experiences over a decade would provide only a partial snapshot of\ntrends in weight discrimination for adults in the United States.\nMeasure of discrimination\nThe MIDUS survey evaluates self-perceived discriminatory experi-\nences by asking participants to report occurrences of discrimination\nover their lifetime and on a day-to-day basis. The survey asks about\nthe primary reason for discrimination allowing participants to report\nmultiple reasons if applicable. Specifically, the survey asks \"What was\nthe main reason for the discrimination you experienced? If more than\none reason, circle all that apply\" with response choices including \"Your\nAge, Gender, Race, Height or weight, Ethnicity or nationality, Physical\ndisability, Some aspect of appearance other than weight or height, Sexual\norientation, Religion, and Other reason.\"\nThe key variable in our study is perceived discrimination due to the\nrespondent's weight or height. Because the survey used one category\nfor body size discrimination combining height and weight, we refer\nto this variable as weight/height discrimination throughout the paper.\nWe compared average body weight, height, and BMI (defined as weight\nin kilogram relative to height in meters squared) between the partici-\npants reporting weight/height discrimination and the rest of the sample\nto test whether weight was more likely to be a source of discrimination\nthan height. On average, body weight and BMI were significantly higher\namong people reporting weight/height discrimination relative to other\nthere was no difference in both samples in the average height of women\nby weight/height discrimination, so that a short body stature was unlikely\nto be a source of weight/height discrimination. Body height among men\nwas on average slightly higher in the group reporting weight/height dis-\ncrimination (P < 0.10), so that a short stature is an unlikely cause of\nweight/height discrimination among men. We therefore have reason-\nable evidence to believe that the reported experiences of discrimination\ndue to weight or height are reflective of higher body weight and obesity\nrather than height.\nWe examined lifetime experiences of discrimination in major settings\nsuch as employment, medical care, and education as well as interpersonal\ndiscrimination on a day-to-day basis. Lifetime experiences were self-\nreported in the question: \"How many times in your life have you been\ndiscriminated against in each of the following ways because of such things\nas your race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, physical appearance, sexual\norientation, or other characteristics? (If the experience happened to you,\nbut for some reason other than discrimination, enter \"0\").\" Eleven ways\nof lifetime discrimination were evaluated, including: \"discouraged by a\nteacher or advisor from seeking higher education,\" \"denied a scholarship,\"\n\"not hired for a job,\" \"not given a job promotion,\" \"fired,\" \"prevented from\nrenting or buying a home in the neighborhood you wanted,\" \"prevented from\nremaining in a neighborhood because neighbors made life uncomfortable,\"\n\"hassled by the police,\" \"denied a bank loan,\" \"denied or provided inferior\nmedical care,\" and \"denied or provided inferior service by a plumber, car\nmechanic, or another service provider.\" Discrimination in interpersonal\nexperiences on a day-to-day basis was evaluated with the question: \"How\noften on a day-to-day basis do you experience each of the following types\nof discrimination?\" with nine response items including: \"you are treated\nwith less courtesy than other people,\" \"you are treated with less respect than\nother people,\" \"you receive poorer service than other people at restaurants\nshort communications\nbehavior and psychology\nor stores,\" \"people act as if they are afraid of you,\" \"people act as if they\nthink you are dishonest,\" \"people act as if they think you are not as good as\nthey are,\" \"you are called names or insulted,\" and \"you are threatened or\nharassed.\" Participants indicated how often they had experienced these\nsituations using these categories: \"Often,\" \"Sometimes,\" \"Rarely,\" \"Never.\"\nIn both survey waves, we constructed a dichotomous variable of\nperceived discrimination indicating whether an individual reported\noccurrences of any types of discrimination (e.g., work-related dis-\ncrimination, personal insults). Multiple and single occurrences of dis-\ncrimination were weighted equally so that a person reporting a single\noccurrence of discrimination (e.g., in the form of \"denied or provided\ninferior medical care\") would be treated equally in our discrimination\nmeasure as someone who reported several discriminatory experiences\n(e.g., by \"not given a job promotion\"). We coded responses \"Often\" or\n\"Sometimes\" in the question about daily discrimination as an indicator\nof discrimination. We also constructed measures of lifetime discrimi-\nnation exposure and daily interpersonal discrimination indicating any\noccurrences of lifetime discrimination or discrimination in personal\nrelationships, respectively.\nStatistical analysis\nWe conducted comparative analyses of the prevalence of different\nforms of discrimination and forms of discrimination across population\ngroups in both waves of data. Stratifying by age, race, education, marital\nstatus, weight status, and occupation, we performed a t-test for each\ncharacteristic to evaluate the hypothesis that rates of discrimination\nin the group remained unchanged between the two waves (reporting\nP values). Similarly, we used a t-test to compare rates of discrimination\nbetween men and women across groups in each survey wave. We also\ncompared sociodemographic characteristics and weight distribution of\nthe samples in both waves and tested for differences in these attributes\nbetween the samples. To account for the complex sampling design and\nto obtain nationally representative estimates, we used individual sample\nweights in presenting sample statistics.\nResults\nThe prevalence of weight/height discrimination in US adults\nonstrating a significant increase of 66% (P < 0.01).

Also, we found no\nsignificant increase in rates of weight/height discrimination\n\nrespondents (see Table 1).\nTable 2 links trends in obesity and weight/height discrimina-\ntion by providing data from the two assessments on the pro-\nportion of specific BMI ranges, mean BMI, and the prevalence\nof weight/height discrimination in each BMI range. Similar to\nnational data presented elsewhere (19\u00ad22), obesity prevalence\namong the MIDUS participants increased notably since the mid\nwhere (23,24), growth rates were particularly high among the\nmore extreme BMI categories, increasing by 15% for individuals\nthan tripling for those with BMI 45.\nWe tested the hypothesis that the observed growth in weight/\nheight discrimination was driven by the increased spread of\nobesity comparing rates of weight/height discrimination in\nnarrowly defined BMI groups. Between BMI of 27 and 40,\nthe rate of weight/height discrimination increased notably\nfor people with similar BMI levels with a single exception of\nthe BMI range of 29\u00ad31. Although the average BMI in each\nBMI range remained stable (except for the extreme category\nof BMI  45), the prevalence of weight/height discrimination\nincreased over the past 10 years in each BMI range for people\ndents at the most extreme right tail of the BMI distribution\ndid the rates of discrimination go down despite an increase in\nthe group average BMI. However, the small sample size for the\nhighest BMI range (especially in the MIDUS II data set) makes\nit difficult to interpret the findings, and these estimates should\nbe read with caution.\nWe also ruled out the hypothesis that the aging of the sample\nand weight gain with age may explain increased rates of weight/\nheight discrimination. Discrimination rates due to weight/\nheight went up in all age groups but ages 65\u00ad74, with a particular\nincrease among people aged 35\u00ad40. Given that much of weight/\nheight discrimination occurs in younger population groups, it\nis unlikely that aging can explain much of the rising trend in\nweight-related discriminatory experiences.\nAmong 11 forms of discrimination that we examined, a sig-\nreported for gender discrimination (women only), any reason\nfor discrimination (men), some aspect of appearance other than\nweight or height (women), age discrimination, and other causes\nof discrimination.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first study to investigate the prevalence of weight/\nheight discrimination longitudinally in a national sample of\nAmerican adults. Findings showed that weight/height discrim-\ncrimination remained stable, whereas the prevalence of weight/\nheight discrimination increased to levels comparable with those\nreported for race and age discrimination.

We\naddressed this hypothesis by examining changes in discrimina-\ntion within BMI categories over the past decade and revealing\nincreases in weight-attributed discrimination at approximately\nthe same levels of weight. A second possible explanation is that\nperceived weight discrimination could reflect experiences that\nhave resulted from worsening societal attitudes and weight\nstigma. In this regard, our findings support experimental\nresearch assessing stigmatizing attitudes toward obese individu-\nals, which has documented an increase in the stigmatization of\nobesity over time (25).\nA third possibility is that the media may play a contributing\nrole in the observed increases in weight bias. A recent study that\nassessed framing of obesity in American news coverage from\nsage frames in this national news coverage was the emphasis of\nobesity as a problem of personal responsibility, pointing to indi-\nvidualistic solutions rather than larger environmental or soci-\netal changes. Although research has challenged this notion and\nillustrated the complex interaction of biology, genetics, and the\nenvironment as important contributors to weight gain (27,28),\nthe view that obesity stems from individual choice remains com-\nmon. Sociocultural messages reinforcing the notion of personal\nresponsibility for weight gain are also evident from the diet\nindustry, which relies on framing obesity as a problem requir-\ning individual solutions through various weight loss products.\nThe link between perceptions of personal responsibility for\nobesity and expressions of weight bias has been convincingly\ndemonstrated in experimental research, and may help to explain\nincreases in perceived weight discrimination. Providing people\nwith information that emphasizes personal responsibility for\nobesity worsens negative stereotypes and stigma toward obese\npersons (31). In addition, obese individuals are more likely to\nbe blamed and negatively stereotyped when they are perceived\nto be personally responsible for their weight gain, but receive\nmore favorable evaluations and less blame when obesity can\nbe attributed to a physical cause outside of personal control\n(32\u00ad37). Thus, attributions about personal responsibility for\nobesity, whether perpetuated by media coverage or by diet\nindustry marketing, could potentially contribute to higher lev-\nels of weight bias and perceived discrimination. Future work\nis needed to help clarify these and other potential reasons for\nincreasing rates of weight discrimination and to develop means\nfor reducing bias.\nThere are several limitations to this study. First, the\nMIDUS survey combined weight and height in one category\nof \ndiscrimination cause, preventing separation of these two\n\nvariables; however, given a significantly higher average weight\nand BMI, but not shorter height, among the MIDUS partici-\npants reporting weight/height discrimination, it is expected\nthat the category primarily reflected discrimination due to\nweight. Second, body weight and height in this sample were self-\nreported, and analyses were based on self-reported perceptions\nof weight/height discrimination rather than actual observed\nbehaviors of discrimination. Finally, we excluded a portion of\nthe MIDUS sample due to data limitations. However, the lack\nof systematic differences found in key characteristics of the\nexcluded and included participants suggests that such exclu-\nsions were unlikely to bias the results.\nThe results of this study highlight several new and important\nfindings about weight discrimination in the United States. This\nproblem appears to be worsening over time, and has become\ncomparable in prevalence to other forms of discrimination, such\nas race and age, which are protected under Federal legislation.\nGiven that no federal legislation (and only one state law) exists\nto prohibit weight discrimination, it is concerning that so many\noverweight and obese individuals are vulnerable to discrimina-\ntion and its harmful consequences and have no legal protection.\nNational actions are needed to protect this population and to\nreduce bias and stigma associated with obesity.\n"
