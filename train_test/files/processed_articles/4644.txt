For\nexample, the latest update from the 5th PAH\nWorld Symposium (held in Nice, France, in\n2013) outlined the multivariate predictors of\nsurvival as follows: male sex, age > 65 years,\nPAH secondary to connective tissue disease,\nhigh New York Heart Association func-\ntional class (NYHA FC), low 6-min walking\ndistance (6MWD), high levels of brain\nnatriuretic peptide (BNP) or the N-terminal\nof the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide,\nhigh creatinine levels, presence of pericardial\neffusion on echocardiography, low diffusing\ncapacity of the lung for carbon monoxide\n), high right atrial pressure (RAP),\nlow cardiac output (CO) and high pulmon-\nary vascular resistance (PVR).5 Research\nhas also identified several biomarkers to be\nprognostic predictors in PAH, including\nlevels of bilirubin, platelets, uric acid, tropo-\nnin or C-reactive protein (CRP, and red cell\ndistribution width.6\nInflammation has long been recognized as\nan important pathogenic element in PAH.7\nStacher et al.8 reported the accumulation of\ninflammatory cells in PAH for the first time\nin 2012. In this study, the amount of peri-\nvascular inflammatory infiltrate correlated\nwith parameters of pulmonary vascular\nremodelling and haemodynamics in PAH.8\nAmong several inflammatory markers, neu-\ntrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a\nsimple and popular marker, which has been\nshown to be correlated with the prognosis of\nseveral disease states in cardiology including\nheart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarc-\ntion (AMI), coronary artery disease (CAD),\ninfective endocarditis and acute pulmonary\nembolism.9\u00ad13 One study showed for the first\ntime that the NLR was significantly\nincreased in patients with PAH compared\nwith control subjects.14 To our knowledge,\nNLR has not been studied in terms of patient\nprognosis in PAH. This present study there-\nfore evaluated the prognostic value of base-\nline NLR in patients with PAH.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nConsecutive adult patients with definitive\nPAH who attended the PAH Clinic,\nDepartment of Cardiology, School of\nMedicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir,\n2014, were prospectively screened for inclu-\nsion in this prospective study. All patients\nmet the diagnostic criteria for the definitive\ndiagnosis of PAH.15 The Dokuz Eylul\nUniversity Ethics Committee approved the\ninformed consent was obtained from all of\nthe study participants. Patients with overt\ninfectious disease at the time of PAH diag-\nnosis (i.e. at the beginning of the screening\nprocess) were excluded from the study.\nData collection and patient survival\nBaseline evaluation of the patients included\nthe following: NYHA FC assessment,16\ntransthoracic echocardiography (TTE), rou-\ntine laboratory tests, BNP, 6MWD, echo-\ncardiogram, and right-heart catheterization\n(RHC). BNP was measured using a chemi-\nluminescence microparticle immunometric\nChemistry Analyser; Abbott Laboratories,\nAbbott Park, IL, USA). A Beckman Coulter\nLH 780 Haematology Analyser (Beckman\nCoulter, Brea, CA, USA) was used to under-\ntake the haematological analysis, which was\nused to determine the baseline NLR for each\npatient at hospital admission. For haemato-\nlogical analysis, a sample (3 ml) of venous\nblood was collected from each patient in\ntubes containing 6% ethylenediaminetetra-\nacetic acid; samples were stored at room\ntemperature for 20\u00ad25 min before analysis.\nBlood analyses undertaken during the diag-\nnostic RHC were recorded as baseline bio-\nchemical data. RHC was performed at rest,\nwithout sedation, by an experienced cardi-\nologist (B.A.). Measurements of pulmonary\nartery pressure (PAP), RAP and wedged\nPAP were taken at end-expiration. CO was\nmeasured by an indirect Fick method with an\nassumed O2\nconsumption of the patient.17\nCardiac index (CI) was calculated as CO\ndivided by body surface area. Pulmonary\nvascular resistance was calculated as mean\nPAP minus left atrial pressure divided by\nCO. The survival period was calculated as\nthe number of months from initial diagnosis\nfollow-up period in this study, or to patient\ndeath if that occurred first.\nTwo-dimensional Doppler\nechocardiography\nAll patients had a comprehensive two-\ndimensional Doppler echocardiography\nexamination with a special focus on\nright heart functions and pressures.\nEchocardiograms were performed by two\nexperienced cardiologists (B.A. and E.O\n\u00a8 .)\nusing a Philips HD11 XE ultrasound system\nwith a 3.2 MHz transducer (Philips\nHealthcare, Best, the Netherlands). The\nfollowing parameters were measured\nduring TTE: systolic PAP, right ventricular\n(RV) end-diastolic diameter, right atrial\narea, maximum systolic velocity of pulmon-\nary outflow jet, tricuspid plane annular\nsystolic excursion (TAPSE), RV tissue\nDoppler systolic velocity, RV fractional\narea change (RFAC) and RV Tei index.18\nRFAC was calculated as RV end diastolic\narea (RVEDA) minus RV end systolic area\ndivided by RVEDA, in which measurements\nwere obtained from the apical four-chamber\nview. At the apical four-chamber view,\nM-mode recording of the long axis was\ntaken from the lateral side of the tricuspid\nannulus. The maximal distance of endocar-\ndial motion during the systolic phase was\ndefined as TAPSE. The tissue Doppler\nimaging was used to obtain RV velocities\nin the apical four-chamber view with a 2-mm\nsample volume placed at the lateral segment\nof the tricuspid annulus during early diastole\nand systole. The isovolumetric contraction\ntime (IVCT) and isovolumetric relaxation\ntime (IVRT) were measured from the end of\nthe tricuspid annular velocity pattern to the\nonset of the systolic wave, and from the end\nof the systolic wave to the onset of the\ntricuspid annular velocity pattern, respect-\nively. The ejection time (ET) was defined as\nthe duration of the systolic wave. The RV\nTei index was calculated according to the\nformula: Tei index \u00bc (IVCT \u00fe IVRT)/ET.\nUsing the modified Bernoulli equation, an\nestimate of the RAP is added to the peak\nsystolic gradient of the tricuspid regurgitant\njet to approximate systolic PAP (sPAP) in\nthe absence of pulmonary valve stenosis.\nThe presence of pericardial effusion during\nTTE was also noted.\nPatients were followed-up periodically at\n3-month intervals. Follow-up visits included\nO\na physical examination, NYHA FC assess-\nment, BNP testing, 6MWD, routine labora-\ntory testing and comprehensive TTE. Based\non the NLR upon admission, patients were\nstratified into tertiles: 1st tertile: 2.2; 2nd\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nthe SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version 15.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. To test the distribution pattern,\nthe Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov method was\nused. Data are summarized as the\nmean \u00c6 SD, median (minimum, maximum),\nor n of patients (%). Analysis of variance\nwas used to compare data between the\ntertiles displaying normal distribution.\nKruskal\u00adWallis test was applied to compare\nthe data without normal distribution\nbetween the tertiles. Mann\u00adWhitney U-test\nwas used to compare the data without\nnormal distribution between patients who\nhad died and patients who had survived\nduring follow-up. Categorical parameters\nwere compared with 2-test. Spearman's\nrank correlation coefficient analysis was\nused to analyse the correlation between\nnumeric variables. The effects of different\nparameters on clinical outcomes were calcu-\nlated by univariate analysis for each.\nParameters for which the unadjusted\nP-value was <0.10 in the univariate analysis\nwere identified as potential risk markers,\nand were included in the multivariate Cox\nlogistic regression model.

Echocardiographic parameters\n(other than TAPSE), right-heart catheter-\nization parameters and 6MWD were not\ncorrelated with baseline NLR.\nDiscussion\nThis present study investigated the value of\nbaseline NLR in the prediction of mortality\nin patients with PAH. These present results\nshowed that although NLR was a significant\npredictor of long-term mortality in the\nunivariate analysis, the multivariate Cox\nlogistic regression analysis did not support\nits significance in the prediction of long-term\nmortality. Baseline NLR was significantly\ncorrelated with baseline NYHA FC, BNP\nand TAPSE of patients with PAH. In this\npresent study, independent predictors of\nlong-term mortality were baseline NYHA\nFC, TAPSE, BNP and presence of pericar-\ndial effusion on echocardiography.\nSignificant correlations between the baseline\nNLR and these well-known prognostic fac-\ntors limited its value as an independent\npredictor of death in patients with PAH.\nHowever, these results suggest that NLR\nmay be useful in the assessment of disease\nseverity in patients with PAH.\nThe prognostic value of NLR has been\nstudied in many disease states including\nAMI, CAD, HF, infective endocarditis,\nacute pulmonary embolism, type 2 diabetes\npresent study was the first to investigate the\nprognostic role of baseline NLR in patients\nwith PAH. Inflammation has been long\nrecognized as an important pathogenic\nelement in PAH.7 It has become increasingly\nclear that early and persistent inflammation\nis present and contributes to pulmonary\nvascular disease, as documented in tissue-\nbased studies and in studies of circulating\ninflammatory cells and chemical medi-\nators.23\u00ad25 A wide range of cytokines has\nbeen shown to be elevated and to correlate\nwith survival in PAH; such cytokines\ninclude interleukin-6, monocyte chemo-\nattractant protein-1, tumour necrosis\nfactor-a, transforming growth factor-b and\n5-hydroxytryptophan.26 At the tissue level,\ntraditional cellular components of inflam-\nmation are described in the hypertensive\npulmonary circulation.27 The cells involved\nhave been shown to be mostly T cells,\nmacrophages, and, to a lesser extent, B\ncells.27 Although T cell infiltrates are\nincreased in patients with IPAH, it appears\nthat there is a decrease in CD8\u00fe cytotoxic T\ncells and an increase in regulatory T cells.27\nRegulatory T cells are now believed to play a\npivotal role in the development of PAH.28\nAlthough T cells have been one of the major\npoints of focus in PAH pathophysiology,\nlittle is known about the role of neutrophils\nin PAH development.29 Neutrophils are the\nmost abundant white blood cells; they\nrelease various enzymes and cytokines, and\nactivate other cells of the immune system to\ntrigger and enhance inflammatory reac-\ntions.30 After an acute infection or tissue\ndestruction, the lymphocyte count declines\nand the neutrophil count rises, which\nleads to an increase in the NLR.31 Previous\nstudies reported that both lymphopenia and\nneutrophilia were independently associated\nO\nwith severity of infectious disease and degree\nof tissue damage.32 Recent evidence suggests\nthat the NLR provides a higher predictive\nvalue than the stand-alone leukocyte differ-\nential because by itself the NLR can reflect,\nin a synergistic manner, more about disease\nseverity than either of the former leukocyte\nsubgroups alone.32,33 Currently, the NLR\nhas also been proposed as a strong prog-\nnostic indicator for worse cardiovascular\noutcomes in a variety of settings. For\nexample, studies investigating the NLR in\npatients with cardiovascular disease showed\nthat a higher preprocedural NLR was an\nindependent predictor of adverse outcomes\nin patients undergoing coronary angiog-\nraphy, percutaneous coronary intervention,\nand coronary bypass grafting.34\u00ad36 A higher\nNLR predicts mortality in stable coronary\nheart disease, acute coronary syndromes,\nAmong the inflammatory mediators pro-\nduced by neutrophils, superoxide anions,\nelastase and 5-lipooxygenase products of\narachidonic acid potentially have important\neffects on lung vascular inflammatory and\nremodelling processes.37,38 To the authors'\nknowledge, only one study in the literature\nhas investigated the role of neutrophils in\nPAH.29 This study demonstrated that neu-\ntrophils isolated from patients with IPAH\nand patients with chronic thromboembolic\npulmonary hypertension showed an\nenhanced mediator release (superoxide\nanion, elastase, leukotriene A4, leukotriene\nB4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid)\ncompared with healthy control subjects\nwhen challenged with different stimulatory\nagents.29 The exact role played by neutro-\nphils in the PAH process remains unknown.\nResearch has demonstrated that hypoxia\ncauses a profound inhibition of neutrophil\napoptosis.39 Hence, the neutrophil appears\nto be remarkably well adapted to survive\nand function under oxygen-depleted envir-\nonments such as those experienced in PAH.\nRegarding the value of NLR and circulating\nleukocyte subtypes in PAH, there appears to\nbe only one study in the literature:14 this\nstudy showed that NLR was significantly\nhigher in patients with PAH compared with\nthe healthy control subjects.14 When exam-\nined separately, patients with PAH showed\nsimilar neutrophil counts but lower lympho-\ncyte counts compared with healthy control\nsubjects, but this study did not investigate\nthe prognostic value of NLR in PAH.14 The\npresent study is therefore the first to be\npublished in the literature investigating the\nrole of NLR in predicting survival in\npatients with PAH. The results from our\nstudy showed that the baseline NLR was\nsignificantly higher in patients who died\nduring the follow-up period compared with\nthose who survived, and that this higher\nNLR was due to a higher neutrophil count\nand a similar lymphocyte count compared\nwith the survivors. The NLR was signifi-\ncantly correlated with important prognostic\nfactors such as NYHA FC, BNP and\nTAPSE. Multivariate Cox logistic regres-\nsion analysis did not demonstrate the pre-\ndictive role of NLR in the long-term\nmortality of patients with PAH. This was\nmost likely due to the significant correlation\nbetween NLR and other significant pre-\ndictors of mortality in PAH (such as\nNYHA FC, BNP and TAPSE). In this\ncurrent study, the independent predictors\nof long-term mortality were baseline NYHA\nFC, TAPSE, BNP and the presence of\npericardial effusion on echocardiography.\nThese mortality predictors in PAH were\nconsistent with those previously reported in\nthe published literature.3 At the 5th PAH\nWorld Symposium held in 2013, prognostic\nmarkers in PAH were outlined according to\ndata from large registries and were reported\nas follows: male sex, age > 65 years, PAH\nsecondary to connective tissue disease,\nhigh NYHA FC, low 6MWD, high BNP\nor the N-terminal of the prohormone\nbrain natriuretic peptide, high creatinine\nlevels, presence of pericardial effusion in\nechocardiography, low DLCO\n, high RAP,\nlow CO and high PVR.5 As a consequence of\nthe limited size of the patient population in\nthe current study, the mortality predictors\ndid not include all of the above parameters,\nbut those that were evaluated were among\nthe most powerful predictors of mortality, as\ndemonstrated by many large studies and\nThis present study had a number of\nlimitations. First, it was a single-centre\nstudy, which meant that the study sample\ncomprised patients cared for by a single\ntertiary referral practice. In addition, the\nsample size was small and there was a\nlimited number of deaths during the\nfollow-up period. Secondly, the study was\ndesigned to assess the relationship between\nthe baseline NLR at the time of diagnosis\nand long-term mortality, so analyses were\nbased solely on blood-test results measured\non hospital admission, at the point of diag-\nnosis. Despite adjusting for multiple risk\nfactors, it is possible that there might have\nbeen residual confounding conditions and\nmedications.\nIn conclusion, the present study showed\nthat NLR, a promising marker of inflam-\nmation in other disease states, was corre-\nlated with important prognostic markers\n(such as NYHA FC, BNP and TAPSE) in\npatients with PAH. NLR was also signifi-\ncantly associated with long-term mortality,\nhowever it was not found to be an inde-\npendent predictor of long-term mortality in\nthis PAH population due to its correlation\nwith other prognostic factors. Significant\ncorrelations between baseline NLR and\nother prognostic factors suggests that this\nsimple marker may be useful in the assess-\nment of disease severity in patients with\nPAH; this would be an easy, widely avail-\nable and inexpensive test to undertake.\nThese current data suggest that the level of\ninflammation may be directly associated\nwith disease severity and prognosis in\nPAH, but this needs to be confirmed in\nlarger prospective studies. Understanding\nthe exact role of the inflammatory pathway\nin the PAH pathogenesis may lead to new\ntherapeutic approaches.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
