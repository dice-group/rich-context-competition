In the physical environment familiar size is an effective depth cue because the distance\nfrom the eye to an object equals the ratio of its physical size to its angular extent in the visual field.\nSuch simple geometrical relations do not apply to pictorial space, since the eye itself is not in pictorial\nspace, and consequently the notion \"distance from the eye\" is meaningless. Nevertheless, relative\nsize in the picture plane is often used by visual artists to suggest depth differences. The depth domain\nhas no natural origin, nor a natural unit; thus only ratios of depth differences could have an invariant\nsignificance. We investigate whether the pictorial relative size cue yields coherent depth structures\nin pictorial spaces. Specifically, we measure the depth differences for all pairs of points in a 20-\npoint configuration in pictorial space, and we account for these observations through 19 independent\nparameters (the depths of the points modulo an arbitrary offset), with no meaningful residuals. We\ndiscuss a simple formal framework that allows one to handle individual differences.

It is the basis of\nstadimetry,(1) which has been--and occasionally still is--of military importance in range\nestimates for gunnery. When the absolute size (as in the case of people) is not available,\none may still use the size cue whenever multiple instances of some kind of object are\nsimultaneously detected. In this case the size cue yields ratios of distances. It suffices that the\nobjects are merely statistically similar, common instances are trees or barns in a landscape.\nThis can be further generalized to certain cases of the \"texture gradient cue\"(2) and so forth.\nThe size cue is discussed in virtually any introductory textbook on vision (Gibson 1950;\nThe size cue is well understood for the case of vision in physical space. It depends\nimmediately on range--that is, distance reckoned from the eye.\nIt is rarely recognized that the size cue cannot pertain (at least not in an immediate way)\nto pictorial space. The eye is not in pictorial space (Koenderink and van Doornl 2008), thus\nthere is no such a thing as \"range\". Yet painters often use relative size as a cue to pictorial\ndepth (Gombrich 1960). Apparently the classical \"size cue\" of vision science (related to\nin the United States Navy. (From 1900 on, the stadimeter was standard equipment for navigation\nofficers on the US naval fleet.)\n(2) For flat \"textures\" on the ground plane, the stadimetric expression applies to the horizontal\ndimension, whereas the vertical dimension deviates because of additional \"foreshortening.\" For\nthree-dimensional textures (the typical case, eg, a pebbled beach), there are additional complications\ndue to occlusion. In almost any case the horizontal dimension will still be okay, though.\nstadimetry, etc), and the use of relative size as a pictorial depth cue (as evident from the\npainter's practice), are two distinct things. This paper, in contradistinction to the bulk of the\nvision literature, deals specifically with the latter case.\nThat human observers are sensitive to the size cue as a pictorial cue seems indeed likely\nfrom its frequent use by visual artists. The pictorial size cue often works even in the absence\nof perspective in the formal sense (Figure 1). Cases where it seems hardly used include such\npictures as Japanese woodcuts of interiors before the introduction of Western perspectivism\n(Lane 1978). An interesting example is Thebaid, attributed to Gherardo Starnina, painted\nin 1410. In such pictures things do not change in pictorial size as they recede, with castles\nin the foreground smaller than huts in the background, people larger than bridges, etc (see\nFigure 1a). Nevertheless, such pictures still have a well developed pictorial space due to other\ncues. The same holds for early Persian miniatures (Kianush 1998). In such renderings depth\nis mainly generated by mutual overlap (generating a depth order), and height in the picture\nplane (generating a continuous scale). These are instances where the size cue remains simply\nineffective.\n(\na\n)\n(\nc\n)\n(\nb\n) (\nd\n)\nFigure 1.

Pen and brown ink and\nCases where the size cue is intentionally confusing are common enough in Western art\n(see Figure 2). Examples include such diverse instances as Goya's Giant, and Mel Ramos' pop\nart pictures. The \"giant\" sits upon the horizon (as implied by overlap cues) and is thus miles\n994 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\naway. Its apparent size must thus be due to gigantic physical size. A similar case is Klinger's\ntiger in the mountains. Here we directly compare the pictorial size of the tiger and features of\nthe landscape, resulting in the impression of a gigantic animal. In Mel Ramos' Lola Cola (a\npicture in the intentionally doubtful taste that is typical of \"pop art\") the nude lady and the\ncoke bottle are evidently at about the same depths. Yet the familiar size cue puts the bottle\nfar in front of the pin up, yielding a stimulating tension. What makes such cases of artistic\ninterest (from a cognitive perspective these are merely poor jokes) is that the viewer's visual\nawareness is influenced directly, that is to say, before cognition proper kicks in.\naquatint, 1st state. (b) Klinger's First Future (Max Klinger (1857\u00ad1920), Erste Zukunft (From the series\nbottle is, of course, the famous 1916 design, reputedly modeled after the figure of Mae West.\nDifferent from the theory of the size cue in physical space, there is currently no theory\nof the size cue in pictorial space. Nor are there operational methods or quantitative studies.\nWe propose both theory and operational methods. Our aim is to investigate to what extent\nthe pictorial size cues lead to coherent results. (Coherency to be suitably defined in some\nspecific way elaborated below.) The research is necessarily of an exploratory, preliminary\nnature, given that we are charting unknown territory here.\nIt is perhaps not superfluous to remind the reader that there exist distinct concepts of\n\"picture\". In one (rather extreme) view a picture is much like a window (Alberti 1972; da Vinci\n1888; Gibson 1971). This implies that the viewer is related to the pictorial content in the sense\nthat the viewer is part of the pictorial space. In order for this to happen, the picture has to be\nin perfect linear perspective and the (single) eye has to be at the center of projection. This\ncase is often approximated in the laboratory (in many conventional setups,(3) as well as in\n\"virtual reality\" displays nowadays), or through the help of optical devices such as peephole\nshows or special viewers.(4) In the more common understanding of the term a picture is\n(3) We refer to virtually all setups where the observer sits in a darkened room, head fixed with a chin\nrest, looking through an artificial pupil, and so forth.\n(4) Examples include the classical peephole show box (Balzer 1998), the 19th-century panorama\n(Comment 1999), the \"zograscope\" (Chaldecott 1953), and more modern, the Zeiss Verant designed by\nsimply a planar surface covered with pigments in a certain simultaneous order.(5) In this\ncase the viewer is not likely to have the eye at the perspective center; nor is it of any interest\nto attempt to achieve this, since there not necessarily is a perspective center.(6) In modern\nWestern art, and most of non-Western art, the linear perspective of the European renaissance\nperiod (Alberti 1972) is not used at all.\nCases akin to virtual reality fit into the standard accounts of the size cue in physical space.\nTherefore these are not related to the current topic.\nIn the case of true \"pictorial\" perception the viewer is not geometrically related to the\npictorial content; the eye is not located in pictorial space at all. This has the immediate\nconsequence that pictorial objects have no distance to the eye; the concept remains\nundefined. In visual awareness, pictorial objects often have a quality known as depth, though.\nThis is the case regarded here.\nDepth and distance are categorically different entities (Figure 3). For instance, distance is\na non-negative quantity, with an obvious origin: distance zero is where the eye is. Thus the\nrange, or distance domain, is the real half-line. In contradistinction, depth has no obvious\norigin. The eye is not even in pictorial space; it is not at any particular depth at all. In fact,\nabsolute depth is a non-entity. Only depth differences can (perhaps) be ascribed some\nmeaning. Consequently, the depth domain is (at best) the full affine real line.(7) In many\ncases the depth domain may have even less structure.\nFigure 3. At top an example of a range scale. The upper and lower scale are equivalent, although the\nunits are different. This case can be arbitrarily prolonged towards the right, but it \"stops\" at the origin\nat left. The origin is at the black dot (a hole), which can be used to pin the ruler with a nail. If you\nare interested in range ratios, either scale will do; you are guaranteed to obtain the same result. At\nbottom an example of an affine scale. The upper and lower scale are again equivalent, although in\nthis case both the origins and the units are different. This scale can be arbitrarily prolonged in either\ndirection. There is no \"natural origin\". If you are interested in the bisection of line segments, or the\nratio of segment lengths, for line segments at any location, either scale will do. You are guaranteed to\nobtain the same result.\n(5) This was forcefully pushed by the French painter Maurice Denis in his symbolist manifesto (Denis\n1890, p 16): \"It should be remembered that a picture--before being a war horse, a nude, or an anecdote\nof some sort--is essentially a flat surface covered with colors assembled in a certain order.\"\n(6) Thus if you hang a painting on your wall, this does not force you to put your chair at a certain\nposition, nor to agree with your company to whom goes the honor of enjoying this singular location.\n(7) This is slightly technical. The \"real line\" is merely the sequence of real numbers. The range domain\nis a half-line composed of the non-negative real numbers. The origin is the number zero. Points are\nindicated by the corresponding number, the range. The \"affine line\" is the full real line in the absence\nof an origin and a unit of length. (See Figure 3.)\n996 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nIn typical cases of pictorial vision there cannot exist any causal or functional relation be-\ntween distance and depth, for the simple reason that distance (or range) remains undefined.\nIn Appendix A we consider speculative relations between range in physical space and depth\nin \"visual space\" (ie, the subjective equivalent of physical space). This might be useful in\ncases where the relative size cue would be used in real scenes, or calibrated pictures. The\ncase of pictorial space is categorically different from that of visual space because there is no\nimmediate relation to a physical space. Below we consider it using a few general arguments.\nFigure 4. (a) Two pictorial objects of different size. When superimposed over the picture, object 1 looks\nless distant than object 2. (b) Again, two pictorial objects of different size, object 1 looking less distant\nthan object 2. In this case picture (b) is a scaled version of picture (a). (c) Three pictorial objects, 1 the\nlargest, 3 the smallest. Object 1 looks closer than object 2, which again looks closer than object 3.\nIn Figure 4a we consider the very simple case of two visual objects that are identical\nexcept for location and size. The larger one (1) looks nearer than the smaller one (2). In\nFigure 4b we repeat configuration (a) but on an overall smaller scale. In order to construct a\nnumerical scale for depth, we evidently want to let the depth of (a)1 be smaller than that of\n(b)2, and likewise the depth of (b)1 be smaller than that of (b)2. As a desirable constraint we\nwant the depth difference to depend only upon the ratio of sizes (diameter of (a)1 relative\nto diameter of (a)2, and diameter of (b)1 relative to diameter of (b)2). Moreover, we want\nthe depth difference to be independent of the absolute size of the objects. Thus the depth\ndifferences (a)1 \u00ad (a)2 and (b)1 \u00ad (b)2 should be equal in the case of the example. Another\ndesirable objective is that the scale be additive. That is to say, one would like to impose the\nconstraint that the depth difference (c)1 \u00ad (c)3 be equal to the sum of the depth differences\n(c)1 \u00ad (c)2 and (c)2 \u00ad (c)3. It is immediate to show that this implies that the depth difference\nshould be defined as the logarithm of the ratio of the sizes.\nNotice that this relation reflects only the properties of the numerical depth scale that\nwe impose on the judgment of relative sizes and has nothing whatsoever to do with the\nelementary geometry of the size cue in physical space. This is indeed necessary, because\nthere exists no equivalence of \"range\" (that is distance reckoned from the eye), because the\neye is not in pictorial space. (The eye does not see itself.)\nTo impose the two constraints of independence of absolute size and additivity is natural.\nThe independence of absolute size is an obvious requirement, as seen in Figure 5. The depth\ndifference between the super-objects (a) and (b) should be the same as that between the\nsub-objects (a)1 and (b)1, even though (a) \u00ad (b) and (a)1 \u00ad (b)1 differ in scale by a factor of\ntwo. The additivity constraint is natural because the depth scale has neither a natural origin,\nnor a natural unit. The constraints make it into an affine line: We only assign depth differences\nthrough the log-ratio of sizes (a single item cannot be assigned a depth), and the base of\nthe logarithm remains arbitrary, the depth difference unit is determined only up to some\narbitrary (though positive) common factor.\nFigure 5. (a) an object composed of four smaller sub-objects; (b) the same configuration at smaller\nscale. The depth difference between the super-objects (a) and (b) should equal the depth difference\nbetween sub-objects such as (a)1 and (b)1.\nOne has to assume that different observers will yield depth scales that mutually differ by\narbitrary (though not depth reversing) affine transformations. They might use the upper and\nlower scales of the ruler shown in Figure 3, for instance.\nAs we will show in this paper, simple methods allow one to perform rather strong tests on\nthe consistency of the scale obtained for general point configurations in pictorial space for a\nsingle observer, as well as the consistency of the scales obtained for different observers of the\nsame picture.\nWe propose to put the relative size cue to good use as a depth probing tool, by showing\na pair of obviously identical objects at different locations (like those depicted in Figure 4)\nand requiring the viewer to adjust their relative pictorial sizes such as to look equal size in\npictorial space. Repeating this for many pairs should allow us to probe the space for depth.\nThe aim of the paper is to explore the viability of this method and to find its limits and\ngeneral characteristics. Since we have implemented a number of different methods to probe\npictorial space in the past, we are in a position to address the mutual coherence of such\nmethods. This goes some way towards the solution of the question as to whether the concept\nof pictorial space itself may be ascribed a useful meaning.\nIn this paper we propose to turn the relative size cue into an effective probe of the\nstructure of pictorial space. We concentrate on the generic case of pictorial perception,\nrather than the rather singular \"window\" mode in which the eye position has a relation to\nthe picture geometry.\nIn setting up the method, one encounters some generic problems involved with any\nprobing of pictorial space by means of localized probes. We have extensive experience with\nthese problems, and have discussed them on frequent occasions. In a nutshell, here is how\nto introduce any probe into pictorial space.\nTo start with, notice that pictorial space is a mental entity, whereas the picture plane is a\nphysical entity. A picture is a planar surface covered with pigments in some simultaneous\norder. When looking into, as opposed to at, a picture, visual awareness breaks through the\npicture plane so to speak, and conjures up a three-dimensional spatial organization to\nthe mind. This is a spontaneous, effortless process, the awareness simply happens to the\nobserver, much like sneezing. This \"presentation\" is proto-cognitive in that the observer\nhas little or no control over it. Prolonged looking, typically accompanied by voluntary and\n998 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\ninvoluntary fixations, is apt to lead to a series of mutually similar but distinct presentations.\nEach single presentation lasts only a moment (Brown 2002). In having such presentations, the\nobserver experiences the simultaneous order of pigments on the picture surface as pictorial\nspace. Putting a physical mark on the picture surface often results in the appearance of\nsomething novel in pictorial space. This is, of course, exactly what happens when a painter\nputs another touch on the surface.\nTwo things happen simultaneously when the painter touches the canvas with the loaded\nbrush. Some paint is added to the surface, and something changes in pictorial space.\nThe painter manipulates pictorial space at the same time as the physical surface is being\nmanipulated. Some painters feel they are primarily working on the canvas, others that they\nare working on the image. Both agree that they (cannot help but) work on both. Putting a\nspot of dark paint on the surface of a portrait thus may result in the appearance of a \"beauty\nspot\" or \"freckle\" on the pictorial skin. The mark travels into depth until it comes to a halt at\nthe nearest pictorial surface on which it adheres. In putting the mark on the canvas, one may\nfeel that one touches the cheek. Phenomenologically, the experience is not that different\nfrom feeling the head of a screw at the end of a screwdriver, or the paper surface at the tip of\none's pen.\nWe exploit this phenomenon to put probes into well defined locations in pictorial space.\nThe process is really simple, one just superimposes a physical mark on the picture surface.\nIf done right, this results in the appearance of a pictorial mark on some pictorial surface,\nor clinging to some pictorial object. In order to do this right, one should select a suitable\nlocation, and a suitable mark. For instance, a dark spot in the blue sky may appear as a\npictorial bird (with poorly defined depth) or will not \"cross the surface\" and merely appear as\na superficial smudge, not related to pictorial space at all. Again, a symbol from some font\nmay fail to adhere to a cheek, but may well adhere to a fronto-parallel wall, and so forth.\nIn practice, we localize suitable marks at well defined, smallish pictorial objects (Figure 6).\nTypically, a mark will \"attach\" and be at a well defined pictorial location.\nFigure 6. At left medieval wood print with two superimposed marks. The two marks are geometrically\nsimilar, but of different size. Notice that the lower one \"attaches\" to one of the persons sitting at front,\nwhereas the higher one looks attached to a swine head on the table. Are these objects of the same\nsize in pictorial space (as different from the picture plane)? It will depend upon the observer. The\nhigher one looks too small to us. Notice that the woodcut is an example where the artist did not use\nthe relative size cue for depth. In the painting at right the relative size cue is important. The two marks\nare equally large in the pictorial plane. The farther one looks too large to us.\nIn running the sessions, we make sure that the observers report to experience the marks\nin pictorial space. It is throughout conceivable to encounter observers for which this would\nfail to be the case. However, we still have yet to meet such a case. If we do, then we would\nhave to give up for that person. There is no way to force people to experience pictorial spaces;\nwe simply have to rely on their proto-awareness.\nIn our present implementation the marks are small semitransparent yellowish circular\nblobs of variable diameter, outlined with a dark hairline (much as in Figure 6 but more\ntransparent). Such marks appear either as fronto-parallel disks or spheres in pictorial space.\nEven if of a single physical size, they may appear of rather different pictorial sizes. This\nworks similarly to \"Emmert's Law\" (Emmert 1881): when introduced in the background, they\nwill appear larger than when introduced into the foreground. Given two of such marks, the\nquestion of whether these appear as pictorially identical objects (that is, of the same size)\nmakes solid visual sense.\nIn order to forge a method of depth difference measurement, we grant the observer\ncontrol over the relative size of the two marks, always keeping the geometrical mean of their\ndiameters constant. The task itself is a simple one: The observer has to adjust the relative\nsizes such that the two objects look the same size. We then cheerfully invoke the theory\ndiscussed in the introduction and interpret the logarithm of the size ratio accepted by the\nobserver as the depth difference. Of course, this should be interpreted only as our operational\ndefinition of the depth difference. From this perspective, such a definition in no way depends\nupon the theory, which was used only as a heuristic device to come up with the definition.\nWhether such a definition makes sense at all then becomes an empirical issue, and this is\nwhat the present paper centers upon.\nA strong test of the viability of the method requires one to study many pairs from some\nextended point configuration in pictorial space. There are many more pairs than points, since\nthe number of pairs grows quadratically with the number of points. Any point participates\nin many pairs. Thus the issue of mutual coherence of a set of depth differences is easily\naddressed empirically.\nThere are a number of limitations of any such a method that are already obvious a priori. A\nmajor one involves the depths of very distant points. For large depth differences (for instance,\nthose involving points on the horizon of a landscape) the size ratios are likely to become very\nlarge, and instead of a well-defined numerical value, one finds that the observer decides to\nbe satisfied with \"large enough.\" In the present experiment we include a (small) number of\ninstances in which the task becomes ill-defined for this reason. In the final analysis we have\ntaken account of the special nature of these cases.\nAnother problem is due to the fact that we do not consider well-calibrated, \"window-like\"\npictures. As the theory discussed in the introduction suggests, this means that the depth\ndifferences obtained in an experiment will suffer from unknown scaling factors and offsets.\nSince such scaling factors are not (ill-)specified by the pictorial cues, one has to assume that\nit will be idiosyncratic, with the result that the depths obtained for different observers will at\nbest be scaled copies of each other. This will affect the type of analysis that might sensibly be\napplied to the empirical results.\nWe address such problems in subsequent sections of the paper.\nParticipants were volunteers from the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology at the Univer-\nsity of Leuven and the authors. No observer, including the authors, had any prior experience\nwith the method. Only the authors had given it some thought before embarking on the trials.\nAll observers had seen the stimulus picture before, since they participated also in past (rather\ndifferent) experiments involving this figure.\nAges varied from early twenties to late sixties. Both genders were represented (three\nfemales, four males). Familiarity with the visual arts ranged from scant to extensive.\n1000 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nEach observer completed three full sessions. A full session included many trials, each\nordered pair of locations being presented once. The pairs were presented in random order\nfor each session.\nThe stimulus picture was a copy of a wash drawing by Francesco Guardi(8) by Anne-Sophie\nBonno.(9) The picture represents a \"capriccio,\" that is an imaginary landscape, based on the\ngeneric Veneto environment of the 18th century. Thus no such thing as \"the ground truth\" is\navailable. The landscape is of the standard type encountered in Guardi's time, with clearly\ndelineated foreground, middle ground, and background. Such constructions still work well\nfor present day observers, even those with little or no experience with the visual arts. Depth\ncues include height in the picture, local tonal value, local strength of line, overlap, increasing\ngeneralization of details with depth, and familiar size (persons, boats, houses). Of course,\nthese cues tend to correlate strongly with each other.\nand viewed from a distance of 78 cm. The room was semi-dark, all of the light being due to\nthe display. This was just enough for the observers to find their way around the keyboard.\nThis implies that the frame of the display was (dimly) visible and that the observers were\nfully aware of the fact that they were looking at a flat, rectangular screen.\nViewing was monocular with the dominant eye, the other eye being patched or closed.\nViewing was through a 4 cm circular aperture at fixed position, the head being stabilized by a\nchin and forehead rest. The picture measured 36.9 deg (width) by 27.4 deg of visual angle;\nthus the foreshortening factor at the left and right edges was 0.951, within 5% from unity,\nwhich was our design objective.\nAt this distance the available physiological depth cues are expected to be largely inactive.\nBinocular disparity is not available due to monocular viewing; thus only monocular parallax\nand accommodation might be expected to matter. The accommodation difference between\nthe center and the left or right edge of the picture is less than a tenth of a diopter, which is\nsubthreshold. The monocular parallax is 17 minutes of arc for an eye turn of 18 deg (half the\ndiameter of the stimulus). The difference in monocular parallax between center and edge\nof the picture is less than a minute of arc, which is subthreshold. Thus monocular parallax\nyields a uniform translation over about 17 minutes of arc for an eye movement subtending\nabout 18 deg, which is again subthreshold. Thus the physiological depth cues signal either a\nscene at large distance or a flattish surface. Since observers appear to localize the scene as\nnear to the picture surface (a bit like the view in an aquarium or terrarium), the physiological\ncues may be expected to contribute a weak tendency to flatness, something that has been\nverified in other settings (Koenderink et al 1994).\nA session consists of a series of similar trials, presented in random order. Each trial starts\nwith a view of the picture over which two yellowish, circular disks, both outlined with a black\nhairline had been superimposed. The observer uses a computer keyboard to control the\nrelative size of the disks in 1% intervals. The left and right arrow keys each change the relative\nsizes, though in opposite directions. Thus the observer has to rely on vision to know the\nrelative sizes, the interface yielding no cue. The observer takes arbitrary time to adjust the\nrelative size until the two disks appear as a pair of identical spherical objects in pictorial\nspace. When satisfied, the observer actuates the space bar, which initiates the next trial.\n(8) Franceso Guardi was an Italian painter that lived from 1712\u00ad1793. He is best known for his\nlandscapes and city scenes, nearly all of them located in the Veneto. In many cases the landscapes are\ninventions, rather than actual scenes.\n(9) http://www.atelier-bonno.fr/\nAt the close of the session results are sorted, and relative sizes converted to depth\ndifferences by taking the logarithm of the ratio. The set of all depth differences is then\nconverted into a much smaller set of relative depth values. These depth values are normalized\nby constraining their average to equal zero. Apart from the list of depth values, the root mean\nsquare deviation between the explained and the observed depth differences is collected as a\ndatum.\nObservers find the task intuitive, and generally fun to do. It is easily possible to handle\npoint configurations comprised of about 20 points in sessions of about an hour. Notice\nthat a point configuration of N = 20 points implies \u00bdN(N\u00ad1) = 190 ordered pairs, and thus\nas many trials. The size ratios are converted into 190 depth differences, and a standard\nprocedure (involving the pseudoinverse [Penrose and Todd 1956] of the matrix defined by\nthe least squares problem) is run to find the 20 depth values, always under the constraint\nthat the average depth equals zero. From the 20 depth values we find 190 \"explained\" depth\ndifferences, and the standard deviation of the mismatches from the actually observed depth\ndifference values is taken as a measure of the coherence of the result. We repeat this to obtain\nthree independent sessions from each observer. From this we attempt to determine the\nstandard deviation in the observed depth differences.\nThe fiducial locations are shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, with a typical result for\none session. Apparently the method \"works\" at least in principle in that it yields a three-\ndimensional point configuration. Such configurations turn out to be at least roughly\nsimilar for all observers and for the repeated sessions of a single observer. Moreover, the\nconfiguration makes sense in that one obtains a clear ordering of points in the foreground,\nthe middle ground, and the background.\nFigure 7. At left the stimulus picture with the 20 fiducial locations indicated. The points indicated\nwith square marks are in the far range. The points are labeled by hue. At right the depths from one\nsession of observer ML. In Figure 8 the same data are represented in three-dimensional pictorial space.\nAgain, the points are labeled by hue. For the sake of concise rendering the numerical values have been\nnormalized on the range of zero to one, and coarse-grained to two significant figures.\nA more precise study of such data can be based on scatter plots of depths for correspond-\ning fiducial locations. In Figure 9a we show such scatter plots for the three sessions of a single\nobserver (ML) over either the full or the near range, and in Figure 10a the means of the three\nsessions of each observer against the mean over all observers, again either over the full or the\nnear range. What is evident is that the correlations are very high, but that the slopes of the\nregression lines are rather variable. This complicates the analysis; for instance, one may not\nsimply calculate the standard deviations for repeated sessions because the results apparently\n1002 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nFigure 8. The same data as in Figure 7 right. The depth dimension has been arbitrarily scaled so as to\nrender the picture clear. The sloping plane is the ground-plane (water surface) estimated from the\ndata. The orange frame is the picture frame. It is as if observer ML were looking into a classical stage\nproscenium. The hues correspond to those defined in Figure 7 left.\nshow systematic variations. The reason for the variability of the slopes is no doubt the fact\nthat depth differences are only defined up to some unknown scaling factor. One has no reason\nto consider this scaling factor to be anything but fully idiosyncratic. Apparently, it varies\nbetween observers and even for the repeated sessions of a single observer. Since sessions\nwere completed in single sittings, one may perhaps expect the factors to be approximately\nconstant (though unknown) for given sessions. Such variations can be removed by suitable\nscalings (see next section, and Figure 9b and Figure 10b). After such scaling the remaining\nscatter is of interest.\nFigure 9. (a) A scatter plot of the three sessions of observer ML based on all data. Depths of each\nindividual session are plotted against the mean of the three sessions. The regression lines for the\nthree sessions are clearly distinct. (b) A scatterplot containing the same data, but after applying affine\ntransformations that align the regression lines. This removes the idiosyncratic scalings. (c) A scatter\nplot of the near field data alone. These are the same data as in the left plot, but because the far range\ndata are removed, the means are, of course, different.\nFor the single observer ML in the near range (results shown in Figure 9c) we find that\nthe remaining scatter is 0.017 (standard deviation of corrected depth differences), whereas\nthe total depth range is 0.904. Thus this observer might be said to resolve about 55 depth\nlayers.(10) For all observers one has the results shown in Table 1.The rank order correlation\nbetween the depth ranges and the number of resolved depth layers is not significant.\nApparently, depth range and resolution are largely independent. Both vary by as much\nas a factor of two over our observers. (More details can be found in the Analysis below.)\nTable 1.

These are the same data as in the left plot, but because the far\nrange data are removed, the means are of course different.\nThe scaling factors differ both over sessions of a single observer and over the mean data\nof all observers. The scaling factors for the observers differ by as much as a factor of 3.33 as\nevaluated over all data, 1.91 as evaluated over the near range, and 5.23 as evaluated over the\nfar data. An overview of the magnitudes is given in Figure 11.\nThe mutual correlations of the mean depths over three sessions for all observers are given\nin Table 2. The correlations are all very high; the lowest value for the full range is 0.873. For\nThe overall result is that observers show very similar results in the near range, whereas\nthey differ rather markedly in the far range. The differences involve idiosyncratic scalings, for\nthe correlations are high, both in the near and in the far range.\n(10) Of course, this approximate number depends upon the definition. We used depth range divided by\nstandard deviation. One might use interquartile range, or some other measure of spread. This makes\nno essential difference.\n1004 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nFigure 11. The scaling factors encountered in the experiment.

(c) The scaling factors for the far field data against the mean of all far field data. For each\nobserver we show the median and the extremes.\nTable 2. The mutual correlations of the mean depths (over three sessions) of all observers. The table at\ntop gives the correlations for the full data; the table at center, those for the near range; and the table at\nbottom, those for the far range.\n4 Analysis\nIn order to compare a number of sessions, we first find the mean over all sessions. Then\nwe perform a linear regression of each session against this mean. This yields a scaling factor\n(slope of the regression line) for each session. Next we perform the inverse scaling on the\nresults of each session. As a result the three sessions become immediately comparable\n(Figure 9b). Once the systematic deviations are removed, one is left with only the random\nscatter of the data. This allows one to estimate the standard deviation in individual depth\ndifferences. This standard deviation may be compared with the total depth range so as to\nyield a measure of the depth resolution--that is, the number of depth slices that the observer\ndistinguishes in the pictorial space (Table 1).\nAnother important measure involves the internal consistency of the three-dimensional\nconfiguration. For N fiducial points one observes \u00bdN(N \u00ad 1) depth differences, whereas\nthese observations are accounted for by N \u00ad 1 degrees of freedom, namely the N depth\nvalues under the constraint that the average depth is identically zero. These depth values\nimply depth differences, which will differ from the observed ones. The standard deviation\nof these mismatches is a measure for the internal consistency of the three-dimensional\nconfiguration. This standard deviation should be comparable to the scatter--that is, the\nstandard deviation for repeated settings (as discussed above) divided by the square root of\nN \u00ad 1 (because each point is involved in N \u00ad 1comparisons). In case it is, the method may\nbe declared to yield consistent results; in a sense it is a sign of the very existence of pictorial\nspace as operationalized by the method.\nIn Figure 12 we show overall results. From a Monte Carlo simulation we expect the\nmismatches (see previous paragraph) to be about 0.67 times the scatter. Our data are too\nnoisy to check this more precisely. The conclusion is that the mismatches are accounted for\nby the scatter in repeated sessions. Apparently, the method yields coherent geometrical data.\nWe consider this to be an important finding of the study.\nFigure 12. The standard deviation in the \"mismatches\" versus the \"scatter,\" which is the standard\ndeviation in the depth differences from the three repeated sessions divided by the square root of N \u00ad 1\nfor all observers. The lines show the total range, the dots the median values. The data have been split\ninto the near and the far ranges.\nAs a final point we consider the question of whether the presence of human figures in\nGuardi's capriccio might have rendered the task virtually trivial, that is to say, a straightfor-\nward application of stadimetry by the observers. We believe this objection to be pointless\nfor the following reasons. There are seven fiducial locations attached to human figures,\nmainly heads. This implies 21 trials, only 11.1% of the total number of trials (190). We\nchecked whether these trials were especially precise; this was not the case. We also measured\nthe heights of the figures (in pixels) and calculated the corresponding stadimetric depth\ndifferences. For one subject (we discuss observer ML here, but the result generalizes\nto all participants) the observed depth differences correlate only very weakly with the\nstadimetrically predicted depth differences. The correlations are very low as compared\nwith other levels reported in this study. In Figure 13a one notices an appreciable scatter. We\nconclude that there is no particular reason to assume that the stadimetric cue played an\nimportant role in the behavior of the observer. Other cues, for instance, height in the picture\nplane (Figure 13b) correlate just as well, if not better, with the observations.\n1006 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nFigure 13. (a) Scatterplot of the observed depth differences (by observer ML) plotted against the depth\ndifferences predicted from stadimetry. Only depth differences between locations at pictorial figures\nare considered. (b) Scatterplot of the depth of a session of observer ML against heights in the picture\nplane (heights expressed in pixels).\nIn Figure 13b we have treated the near and far ranges separately. Both evidently correlate\nstrongly with height in the picture plane, although the slopes of the regression lines are very\ndifferent. All observers correlate highly with the height cue, but the difference between near\nand far ranges appears to be idiosyncratic.\n5 Comparison with prior results\nThe data from these relative size measurements may be compared with results obtained\nby way of different methods to probe the geometrical structure of pictorial space. This is\npossible because the observers in the present task also participated in prior experiments\ninvolving the same stimulus picture (of course, this was the very reason for the choice of both\nobservers and stimulus picture) and because depth can be used as a \"common currency.\"\nWe consider two alternative probes, namely the method of pairwise depth comparison (van\nDoorn et al 2011) and a method of exocentric pointing in pictorial space (Wagemans et al\n2011). For both methods we use the final data per subject. Further details can be found in\nthe original papers.\nThe method of pairwise depth comparison yields only an ordinal depth scale. Of course,\none expects perceived depth order to correlate very well with the sign of the depth difference.\nOnly in the case of depth differences that are very small in an absolute sense would one expect\noccasional, random violations. Indeed, the depth scale established through size comparisons\nmay be expected to yield a metrical calibration of the ordinal scale obtained through pairwise\ncomparison. We check this in two ways, first we find the Kendall rank order correlation;\nthen we prepare a scatter plot of depth order against depth. This latter plot is expected to be\nmonotonic throughout. These expectations are fully borne out, as shown in Figure 14a. The\nKendall rank order correlations have been collected in Table 3.\ndeviations from monotonicity are rare.\nThe number of resolved depth slices as determined by the method of pairwise comparison\nis similar to that obtained from the present method. In this respect the methods completely\nagree.\nFigure 14. (a) Scatter plot of the ranking (depth order) from pairwise comparison against depth from\nrelative size for observer ML (session 1). Notice only incidental small deviations from monotonicity.\nThe rankings are for a greater number of fiducial points (about fifty) than used in the present\nexperiment, hence the scale. (b) Scatterplot of the depth from a pointing task (expressed in pixels)\nagainst depth from relative size for observer ML (session 1). The pointing depths are for a lesser\nnumber of fiducial points (five) than used in the present experiment. The correlation is very high.\nTable 3. The median Kendall rank order correlation of the depths from the relative size cue with the\nrank order determined from pairwise comparison, and the median of the correlation of the depths\nfrom the relative size cue with the depths from an exocentric pointing task.\nObserver\nPointing\ndepths\nRand\norder\nThe method of exocentric pointing in pictorial space is rather more interesting than a\nmere pairwise comparison because it yields a depth scale by means of a completely different\nparadigm, making the comparison a challenging one. In this method one sets the observer\nto the task of adjusting the spatial attitude of a pointer (rendered as a solid arrow) so as to\npoint to a target (rendered as a roughly spherical solid object). This (like the relative size task)\ninvolves a pair of fiducial locations for each trial. However, whereas we may use unordered\npairs in the relative size task, we have to use ordered pairs in the exocentric pointing task.\nThe reason is that observers \"point by arcs\"--that is to say, the pointing directions from A to B\nand from B to A turn out to fail to be collinear. This implies a doubling of the number of trials.\nIn practice, the pointing method allows one to use up to about 10 fiducial points if sessions\nare to be limited to about an hour. In a prior experiment we used 5 fiducial points, a subset of\nthe 20 fiducial points used in the present experiment. The exocentric pointing method yields\na set of depth values for the fiducial points, up to a common offset. In practice, we constrain\nthe average depth to be zero. The depths from pointing may be immediately compared with\nthose from the relative size task. Because they involve very different geometrical relations,\nthis yields a strong check on the internal consistency, or perhaps the very existence, of\npictorial space (Figure 15).\nWe find that depths from the relative size and the exocentric pointing method correlate\nvery well for all participants in the experiments (figure 14b and Table 3). Correlations are\n1008 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\nFigure 15. The mutual depth relation between two fiducial points from the perspective of exocentric\npointing (left) and the relative size cue (right). Because these methods involve very different geometri-\ncal relations, an agreement between results obtained with these methods goes some way to show that\npictorial space has an existence apart from any specific manner of prospecting it.

It is obviously\nof considerable interest to see whether these differences are essentially unpredictable or\nwhether they are specific to individuals. There is indeed some reason to expect the latter,\nbecause the factor varies rather less over the trials of any given individual than over the group\nof participants. This has been found for both methods. We explore this issue in the scatter\nplot presented in Figure 16.\nFigure 16. Combined scatterplot for all observers of mean depths from the relative size cue task and\nthe depths from an exocentric pointing task.\nThe magnitude of the depths in Figure 16 might appear surprising at first blush. The\ndepths for the exocentric pointing task are expressed in terms of pixels (as measured in the\npicture plane), for this task this is a natural measure. We may attempt to bring the present\ndepth values in the same format by noticing that the horizontal extent of the picture subtends\nthe two-dimensional model discussed in the introduction as a heuristic, we might scale the\nscaled range -795 to +795. This is indeed much closer to the depth range of the exocentric\npointing results. Apparently, the heuristic works quite well.\nThe slopes of the linear fits to the scatterplots in Figure 16 differ by a factor of almost five\n(4.97). Apparently, there is hardly any relation between the depth ranges obtained through\nthe two methods.\n6 Discussion\nIn this paper we considered the pictorial relative size cue. In the case of pictorial\nperception the eye is not related to the geometry of the pictorial content; thus there is\nno notion of a \"range\", that is, \"distance from the eye\". The conventional theory of the size\ncue, which is highly developed, does not apply; nor does the work relate strongly to the large\nbody of empirical studies involving the size cue in physical space. (See Gibson 1950; Palmer\nHere we introduced a novel operationalization of depth in pictorial space based upon the\nrelative size cue. We also compared the results to metrical or ordinal depth scales obtained\nfrom alternative operationalizations. Each of these methods allows for an independent\ncheck of the geometrical coherence of that method, and taken together, one obtains a\nnumber of independent checks on the mutual coherence of pictorial space as revealed\nby different methods of prospecting it. This is to be considered most important, as it\nbears on the basic issue of whether the concept of a \"pictorial space\" makes sense (or\nis useful) to begin with. If not, then pictorial space would be nothing but a collective term for\nvarious, mutually independent structures that arise from various methods to address the\nsimultaneous structure of certain aspects of visual awareness. It is much like the concept of\nEuclidean space (or just \"space\" to many people), a concept that derives its very meaning\nfrom the fact that it serves to understand many, mutually very different ways to prospect\nsimultaneous presence from a single, unifying perspective.(11) As regards pictorial space,\nwe are at far removed from such a convenient situation (see also Koenderink et al 2011).\nHowever, the present result, combined with previously published ones, serves to render the\ncase for a \"pictorial space\" at least worthy of a second glance.\nAlthough the notion of \"depth\" appears to lack any necessary connection to that of\nsize, it turns out to be the case that pictorial size ratios are quite naturally experienced\nas pictorial depth differences by many observers.(12) This result may appear surprising, since\nthe fundamental stadimetric relation only applies to range, that is to say, to situations in\nwhich the observer is part of the space. For pictorial spaces this does not hold; the observer\nis by no means part of the space. Thus the obvious interpretation of the relative size cue fails\nto apply. The relation cannot be a causal one in the sense of the exact sciences. It is the result\nof the nature of the microgenesis of pictorial presentations. Thus this phenomenology serves\nas a window on the machinery subserving the structure of mind, which is indeed why we\nembarked on this research.\nThe depth resolution found in this task is similar to that found in other tasks (exocentric\npointing, pairwise depth order), about several dozens of resolved levels. We find a remarkable\nmutual agreement between observers in that all our observers will certainly agree on the\n(11) For instance, in modern geodesy one measures both distances and angles, combining such\nobservations freely by way of Euclidean geometry and trigonometry.\n(12) Of course, we should remind the reader of the fact that all participants in this experiment were\nmature members of the Western (mainly continental European or Anglo-Saxon) cultural circle.\n1010 J Wagemans, A J van Doorn, J J Koenderink\ndepth order of about thirty levels. A common first reaction is that people are likely to see\nthe same thing because they all see \"veridically.\" We think that this is a misconception in\ngeneral, as it certainly has to be in this case: there does not exist any ground truth for Guardi's\ncapriccio; thus the very notion of veridicality fails to apply. This is an important finding. We\nmay apparently assume that people looking over a pile of photographs together (a bunch\nof holiday snapshots, say) are likely to have the same spatial impressions and are in a good\nposition to mutually discuss these.\nWe find that observers use the relative size cue quite naturally; thus it allows us to use\nit as a method to probe the depth relations in pictorial space. We have explored the limits\nof the method as well as the depth resolution that may be obtained. We have found that\nthe depth structure is coherent within the empirical spread as determined from repeated\nsessions. Moreover, we have shown that the depth scales obtained by way of very different\nmethods are mutually quite consistent. The major proviso is that one has to allow for certain\nobserver-specific scaling factors that apparently cannot be explained further on the basis\nof the available optical structure. Thus \"pictorial space\" is a useful concept in that it unifies\na variety of quite distinct manners to prospect the space. It is coherent both within single\nmethods as well as over a number of different methods. It appears that the main worries are\nconfined to the various limits at the end of the ranges and the aforementioned idiosyncratic\nscalings. Granted the required care, one may regard pictorial space as a true geometry that\n\"exists\" independent of the ways to probe it. Of course, this is a remarkable conclusion in\nview of the fact that pictorial space is a purely mental entity that has no obvious \"prototype\"\nin the physical world.\n"
