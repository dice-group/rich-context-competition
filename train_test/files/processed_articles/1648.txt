    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThis study investigates the relative contributions of socioeconomic status (SES), behavioral and clinical risk factors on mortality. The Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Survey Linked Mortality File was used to examine the association of SES (race, insurance, education, income), behavioral\n(smoking, obesity, physical activity), and clinical (elevated blood pressure, triglyceride level, lipid levels, C-reactive protein (CRP)) risk factors with\n6\u00ad12-year all-cause mortality. Respondents were stratified by known chronic diseases into one of the following categories: no chronic disease,\nnon-cardiovascular chronic disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The overall weighted mortality rate was 9.5% with the highest mortality\nrate among diabetics. Race, insurance coverage, income, smoking status, inadequate physical activity, elevated blood pressure and elevated CRP\nwere independently associated with mortality in the overall population. When stratified by chronic disease, SES factors remained associated with\nmortality, most strongly in the healthy population. Current smoking and inadequate physical activity were also associated with mortality across\ndisease groups while clinical risk factors were less consistent. SES factors, health behaviors and clinical risk factors were all associated with mor-\ntality even when baseline health status and chronic diseases are taken into account. Efforts to reduce mortality will require a multi-faceted\napproach incorporating healthy behaviors and accessible health care systems in addition to clinical advances\n",

Clinical risk factors can identify indi-\nviduals who should be targeted for personalized risk\nreduction strategies.3\u00ad5 At the same time, ongoing research\nsuggests that at least two other domains may be critical for\npredicting morbidity and mortality. First, mortality is strongly\nrelated to socioeconomic status (SES), as measured by\nincome, education or occupation, with lower SES associated\nwith higher mortality.1,6\u00ad8 Second, healthy behaviors have\nalso been shown to be modifiable risk factors for premature\nmortality. McGinnis and Foege9 and Mokdad et al.10 identified\nthe major non-genetic modifiable risk factors that contributed\nto mortality in the USA and this work was later updated with\n2000 data. They estimated that approximately half of all\ndeaths could be attributed to risky health behaviors; the most\nprevalent being smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity.\nDespite the wealth of research showing that SES, health\nbehaviors and clinical risk factors individually contribute\ntoward mortality, these three domains are almost always\nexamined separately. Whereas studies of biochemical\nmarkers and other clinical factors have predominantly\nfocused on high-risk populations who are receiving medical\ncare, research on SES and health behaviors have primarily\nexamined healthier, population-based samples. Few studies\nhave attempted to measure the relative contributions of each\nof these risk factors on all-cause mortality in the same\nsample.11 One study used county-level analyses in the USA\nto identify regions with excess mortality due to chronic dis-\neases and injuries.8 Another study used a population-based\nsurvey and registry to identify predictors of hospitalization.12\nBehavioral, biological and SES risk factors from a 1998\nsurvey were used to simultaneously predict time to first hos-\npitalization, demonstrating that risk factors from all three\nKimberly Rask, Professor of Health Policy and Management\nEmily O'Malley, Statistician\nBenjamin Druss, Professor of Health Policy and Management\n# The Author 2009, Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health.

The NHANES III was conducted by\nthe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) in two\ncluster national probability sample of 33 994 civilian non-\ninstitutionalized Americans that over sampled Hispanic,\nAfrican American and elderly populations, and consisted of\ninterviews, physical examinations and laboratory tests. The\nsampling methods for NHANES III have been described\npreviously.13,14 The NHANES III Linked Mortality File\nmatched NHANES III participants aged 17 and older with\ndeath records from the National Death Index (NDI)\nthrough 2000. Because of the staggered interviews, the mor-\ntality follow-up period ranges from 6 to 12 years post inter-\nview. The linking of NHANES III and NDI records was\nconducted by probabilistic matching and was completed in\nyears and older with valid follow-up mortality information.\nSampling weights were incorporated in all analyses to\nprovide estimates that are representative of the entire US\nadult population aged 18 years and older. Weights are also\nused to account for the unequal selection probabilities that\nresult from the clustered design. Persons with a cancer diag-\nnosis other than skin cancer were excluded from analysis.\nSummary statistics were generated for continuous\nmeasures as means (standard error) and for categorical or\ndichotomized variables as frequencies (weighted percentage).\nMultivariable logistic regression was used to measure the\nprimary outcome: all-cause mortality status as of 31\nDecember 2000. Parameter estimates and odds ratios model\nthe likelihood of mortality. Analyses were performed on the\nfull population controlling for age (continuous), gender and\nself-reported health status. Self-reported global health status\nmight be expected to be an important mediator or modera-\ntor for the association between each of the three categories\nof risk factors and mortality. The factors driving mortality\nmight also be different in respondents with particular clusters\nof conditions. Respondents were thus categorized into one\nof the four disease populations: diabetes, chronic cardiovas-\ncular disease (CVD) (high blood pressure, congestive heart\nfailure, previous heart attack, previous stroke), chronic\nnon-CVD (e.g. skin cancer, emphysema, bronchitis or lupus)\nor healthy (reported no chronic diseases). Persons with more\nthan one self-reported disease were placed in the most severe\nclassification in the following order: diabetes, CVD and then\nchronic non-CVD. SES risk factors selected for this study\nincluded characteristics that have been shown in longitudinal\nstudies to be associated with mortality: race, income relative\nto the federal poverty level and adjusted for household size,\nhealth insurance coverage within the previous 12 months,\nand level of education.2 Health behavior covariates included\ncharacteristics shown to contribute to preventable mortality:\ncurrent smoking status, physical activity level and waist cir-\ncumference as a measure of obesity.6,9 Waist circumference\nwas used because it has been shown to be a marker for\nincreased risk of diabetes, hypertension and CVD even in\nnormal weight participants.16 Separate models were run with\nBMI entered in place of waist circumference as a measure of\nobesity. There was no change in the main results, so only the\nwaist circumference findings are reported here. Clinical risk\nfactors included laboratory or physical findings available\nfrom the NHANES survey that have been associated with\nincreased mortality in clinical trials and population-based\nstudies: blood pressure, lipid levels (triglyceride, total choles-\nterol and HDL) and C-reactive protein (CRP), a measure of\nsystemic inflammation that has been associated with both\nCVD and cardiovascular events.17 Analyses were also done\nincluding calculated non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol \u00ad\nHDL cholesterol) and the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol\nratio without changes in the results reported here.\nCategory cut-off values and additional information on all\ncovariates included in our model are summarized in online\nSupplementary material Appendix S1.\nLogistic regression was used to determine P-values for\nindividual covariates, and odds ratios within the model\n(outcome: mortality) were obtained using SUDAAN PROC\nRLOGIST. The C-statistic was calculated for each model\nacross the disease states. The C-statistic is used to measure\nthe area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)\ncurve, measuring the ability of each model to discriminate\nmortality outcomes (death/no death) and to evaluate the\nmodel's practical ability for correctly discriminating a sub-\nject's outcome. Values vary between 0.5 and 1.0; an area of\n0.5 indicates that the model performs as well as a coin toss.\nAll analyses were performed using SAS-Callable SUDAAN,\nVersion 9.0.0. All analyses incorporated sampling weights\nand primary sampling units (PSUs) to yield population-\nbased estimates.\nResults\nLimiting our sample to NHANES III participants aged 18\nyears and more (n \u00bc 19 136) with valid strata, PSU, weight\nand mortality responses yielded a sample size of 17 413,\nwhich represented 91% of the eligible population. Our\ndisease subpopulation classifications showed 1241 (7.1%) sub-\npopulation, 708 (4.7%) in the chronic non-CVD disease\nhealthy population. Subjects' demographic characteristics are\nsummarized in Table 1. The population was 52.3% female\nwith a mean age, at survey, of 45.3 (0.43) years. Responders\nunder the age of 25 represented 10% of our population while\nanother 10% of the population was 70 years or older. The\nstudy sample was predominantly white and privately insured.\nOver half of the sample had a waist circumference that met\nthe criteria for obesity and just under one-third were active\nsmokers at the initial interview. Most did not meet the CDC\nrecommendations for physical activity. The overall weighted\nmortality rate was 9.5%. Self-reported global fair or poor\nhealth was associated with higher mortality (OR \u00bc 2.90; 95%\nCI 2.45\u00ad3.42) relative to those in good or excellent health.\nWhen stratified by self-reported diseases, the weighted mor-\n7.0% for those with no chronic diseases.\nThe results of individual analyses for each risk factor,\nadjusted for age, gender and self-reported health status are\nsummarized in the first column of Table 2. Since the SES\nvariables have multiple classification levels, the overall\nP-value for the variable, e.g. `race', is also shown. All of the\nindividual SES variables were significant predictors of mor-\ntality at the overall level, with black race and public insurance\n(either Medicare or Medicaid) associated with higher mor-\ntality. Higher education levels and higher family incomes\nwere associated with lower mortality. In terms of health\nbehaviors, being a smoker or physically inactive was associ-\nated with higher mortality but waist circumference was not.\nAmong the clinical factors, elevated blood pressure, high tri-\nglyceride levels and elevated CRP levels were associated with\nhigher mortality whereas total cholesterol and HDL levels\nwere not.\nWhen all of the covariates were entered simultaneously\ninto a multivariable logistic regression for the full study\npopulation, race, insurance coverage and income remained\nstatistically significant, but years of education did not\n(Table 2). The model was tested for collinearity and over-\nspecification without evidence of either in the specifications\npresented. Black race was not statistically associated with\nmortality after controlling for the other covariates while\nother race remained associated with lower mortality. Income\nshowed a graded response with higher incomes correlated\nwith lower mortality. Health behaviors remained significant\nTable 1 Demographics summary for 17 413 NHANES III participants\nGender (weighted %)\nRace\nInsurance coverage (weighted %)\nIncome relative to poverty level (weighted %)\nAbnormal waist circumference\nSmoking (weighted %)\nInadequate physical activity\nCRP\nTriglycerides (mg/dl)\nBlood pressure\nHDL\nSerum cholesterol\nSelf-reported health status (weighted %)\nSelf-reported chronic disease (weighted %)\npredictors of mortality with smoking and low levels of phys-\nical activity associated with higher mortality.

An interval that does not include the null value 1.0 is considered to be statistically significant at the\nknown chronic diseases (healthy). Stratifying the population\nby the four chronic disease groups led to somewhat differ-\nent results. Table 3 shows the impact of SES risk factor for\nrespondents in each of the four health categories. The\noverall P-values show the simultaneous impact of each indi-\nvidual risk factor in a model adjusting for all other covari-\nates including behavioral and clinical risk factors. P-values\nthat were not significant at the 5% level are not shown.\nRace is significant in two disease groups, driven by a lower\nmortality rate for other race in each population. The impact\nof insurance on mortality decreases across the populations,\nhaving its strongest association in the healthy population.\nThe protective effect of income is seen in three of the\npopulation groups but not in diabetics. Years of education\nconsistently do not predict subsequent mortality. For the\nSES variables in general, there is a somewhat graded\nresponse with the strongest effects seen in the healthy\ngroup, intermediate effects in the chronic disease groups\nand smallest effects in the diabetic group.\nTable 4 shows the multivariable associations for behavioral\nand clinical risk factors. As in Table 3, the values associated\nwith each risk factor are adjusted for all other covariates,\nincluding SES. Smoking was associated with higher mortality\nin all disease groups except diabetics. Waist circumference\nwas not significant except in the healthy population where it\nwas paradoxically associated with lower mortality. Low rates\nof physical activity were associated with higher mortality in\ndiabetics and in chronic non-CVD subjects. Clinical risk\nfactors had a variable pattern across disease states. Both elev-\nated blood pressure and high CRP were associated with\nhigher mortality in the healthy population. Only elevated tri-\nglycerides were associated with increased mortality in dia-\nbetics while elevated cholesterol was paradoxically associated\nwith lower mortality. High CRP was the only significant clini-\ncal risk factor in the CVD population.\nLogistic regression modeling was then used to evaluate the\nadditive impact of the three different categories (SES, beha-\nviors, clinical) on predicting mortality in each of the disease\nsubpopulations. All models included age (continuous),\ngender and self-reported health status and covariates were\nadded in a block by category, for example, SES variables. All\ncovariates within each category were added irrespective of\nwhether they had been shown to be statistically significant in\nthe bivariate or multivariable analysis. The models consist-\nently identified mortality more precisely in the healthy popu-\nlation (C-statistic \u00bc 0.862 for SES predictors) than in\ndiabetics (C-statistic \u00bc 0.713 for SES predictors). However,\neach of the three categories of risk factors correctly indicated\nsimilar proportions of mortality within each disease state.\nFor example, in the diabetic population, the respective\nTable 3 SES risk factor associations with mortality by self-reported disease state\nRisk factor Diabetes CVD Chronic non-CVD Healthy\nEducation\nValues reflect the association between the individual risk factor and mortality, simultaneously adjusted for age, gender, self-reported health status, and all\nother SES, behavioral, and clinical risk factors.\nOR, odds ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval.\naP-values reflect the overall significance of the multi-level covariates on mortality, adjusted for all other SES covariates, self-reported health status, clinical\nrisk factors, age, and gender.

The C-statistics for every model\nare shown in online Supplementary material Appendix S2.\nFinally, to address concerns that a portion of subjects who\nwere at high risk for mortality across all factors could be\ndriving the results, we investigated the degree of overlap\nbetween SES, behavioral and clinical high-risk groups. On\nthe basis of the individual risk factors that were statistically\nsignificant in the bivariate analysis, we considered `high-risk\nSES' to be subjects in both the lowest income and education\nlevel; `high-risk behavior' were subjects who were active\nsmokers with inadequate physical activity levels, and `high-\nrisk clinical' were subjects with abnormal triglycerides, CRP\nand blood pressure. Only 0.11% of the overall population\nfell simultaneously into all three high-risk groups. This pro-\nportion ranged from a high of 0.42% in diabetics to a low of\n0.06% in the healthy population. Using a less conservative\nassumption, only 0.39% of the overall population fell into\nthe high-risk SES and one other high-risk group. This pro-\nportion ranged from a low of 0.12% in the chronic disease\npopulation to a high of 2.16% in the diabetic population.\nDiscussion\nMain findings of this study\nSES, health behaviors and clinical risk factors were each sig-\nnificantly associated with mortality in the overall population\neven when simultaneously adjusting for all of the other risk\nfactors. Race, insurance coverage and income were associated\nwith mortality even when controlling for age, health status\nand behavioral and clinical risk factors. Smoking and low\nlevels of physical activity were also significantly associated\nwith mortality. Of the clinical risk factors, elevated blood\npressure and CRP were independently associated with mor-\ntality. In multivariable models stratified by disease state, the\neffect of SES and behavioral risk factors remained strong\nacross disease groups. SES risk factors (race, insurance and\nincome) were most strongly associated with mortality in the\nhealthy population but did affect mortality in populations with\nchronic disease. Smoking was the strongest behavioral risk\nfactor associated with mortality across the disease groups\nwhile inadequate physical activity was associated with mor-\ntality in chronic disease populations. Clinical risk factors had a\nless consistent pattern across disease groups. Elevated blood\npressure and CRP were associated with mortality in the\nhealthy population while only elevated triglycerides were\nassociated with higher mortality in the diabetic population.\nAlthough each group of individual risk factors (SES, beha-\nvioral, clinical) was statistically significantly associated with\nmortality, when added together, they improved little upon the\nability of each separate category to predict overall mortality.\nWhat is already known on this topic\nA wealth of research has shown that SES, health behaviors and\nclinical risk factors individually contribute toward mortality. In\nthe majority of the literature, however, these three domains\nhave been examined separately. Whereas studies of biochemical\nmarkers and other clinical factors have predominantly focused\nTable 4 Behavioral and clinical risk factors for mortality by self-reported disease state\nRisk factor Diabetes Cardiovascular disease Chronic non-CVD Healthy\nBehavior\nClinical\nValues reflect the association between the individual risk factor and mortality, simultaneously adjusted for age, gender, self-reported health status, and all\nother SES, behavioral and clinical risk factors.\nOR, odds ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval.\non high-risk populations receiving medical care, research on\nSES and health behaviors have primarily examined healthier,\npopulation-based samples. Few studies have attempted to\nmeasure the relative contributions of each of these risk factors\non all-cause mortality in the same sample.\nWhat this study adds\nThis study's findings corroborate previous longitudinal studies,\nshowing that SES is a powerful predictor of future mortality.\nThe relationship between SES factors and mortality is\ncomplex, with many studies showing a higher burden of\ndisease, impaired functional status and risky health behaviors\nin many low SES populations.6,18\u00ad20 However, in this study,\nthe relationship between measures of SES and mortality\nremained the same after controlling for self-reported global\nhealth, known clinical risk factors, pre-existing disease and\nhealth behaviors. Of note, controlling for other factors elimi-\nnated the higher mortality associated with black race in the\nbivariate analysis while a lower mortality rate for those of\nother ethnicity remained the same. Previous studies have\nfound that SES differences do explain some of the ethnic dis-\nparities in health outcomes. A study of stroke risk factors\nfound that ethnic disparities in stroke prevalence persisted\nafter accounting for clinical risk factors, but the disparity dis-\nappeared after controlling for income.21 A lower mortality rate\nfor Hispanics has been noted before and referred to by some\ninvestigators as the `Hispanic paradox' or the `healthy immi-\ngrant effect'.20 The protective effect of higher incomes on\nmortality was consistent across all population groups except\ndiabetics. This is consistent with previous studies showing that\nincome has a protective effect on mortality that is independent\nof educational attainment.22 Other studies have explored the\neducation\u00adhealth and income\u00adhealth interactions in the USA,\ndemonstrating that investments in education and poverty relief\nprograms could have profound impacts on the health of the\nnation.1,6 In diabetic respondents, the marginal effect of\nincome may be dwarfed by the impact of the disease itself on\nmortality. In terms of predictive ability, it is interesting that\nSES characteristics were at least as strong as the behavioral\nand clinical risk factors included in this study even among\nrespondents with known CVD or diabetes. This argues that\nSES factors remain powerful determinants of individual mor-\ntality and should not be ignored as scientific advances identify\nnew and promising biologic predictors of clinical disease. The\nability to realize the benefits of early detection and treatment\nare critically dependent upon knowledge about, access to and\nthe affordability of health care.\nDespite statistical significance, there was only modest\nimprovement in discriminative ability as measured by the\nC-statistic when additional risk factors were added to the\nmultivariable model. This is likely because a risk factor that\nperforms well as a prognostic test for an individual patient\nmust have a cutoff value that will discriminate between\nthose who will and those who will not develop the disease\nwith high sensitivity and specificity. One estimate is that a\nrisk factor must be so strongly associated with a disease that\nthe relative risk approaches 200 in order for it to be worth-\nwhile for use as a screening test.23 Few available biomarkers\nand none of the predictors included in this study perform at\nthat level.3,4 In cross-sectional population studies, the pro-\nportion of variance in mortality that can be explained is\nlikely to be limited, and the ability to predict mortality will\nquickly reach an asymptote.\nWaist circumference and cholesterol measures (HDL and\ntotal cholesterol) were generally not significantly associated\nwith mortality. This may be in part due to what is referred\nto as the `Obesity paradox',24 which suggests that obese\npatients tend to receive better medical treatment and man-\nagement because their health risks seem more obvious.\nPrevious studies have shown occasional inconsistencies in\nthe association of both obesity and cholesterol measures\nwith cardiovascular events or mortality.25 \u00ad 28\nLimitations of this study\nThese analyses have several limitations that must be noted.\nThe main outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. The\nlarge number of missing causes of death precluded sub-\ngroup analyses by cause of death. Second, only a limited\nnumber of SES, behavioral and clinical variables were avail-\nable for analysis in each of the domains. Simultaneous ana-\nlyses of variables across domains are a unique contribution\nof this project, but further studies with more detailed vari-\nables and specifications are needed to explore causality and\nthe mediating aspects of each of these domains on risk\nfactors and outcomes. Third, ascertainment of SES, clinical\nfactors and health behaviors was cross-sectional at the time\nof initial interview. These characteristics may change over\ntime and thus our results may underestimate the impact of\nany of these factors on mortality. Future studies should\naddress the impact of risk factor trajectories and their\nof mortality follow-up was available for this study. Longer\nfollow-up might offer additional insights.\nConclusions\nThe results suggest that SES factors, behaviors and known\nclinical risk factors all contribute significantly to subsequent\nmortality even when baseline health status and known chronic\ndiseases are taken into account. Despite accelerating scientific\nadvances, our ability to identify clinical risk factors and trans-\nlate that knowledge into improved health is likely to remain\ndependent in part on successful maintenance of healthy beha-\nviors as well as the accessibility of appropriate health care.\nSupplementary data\nSupplementary data are available at the Journal of Public\nHealth online.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by a grant from the Predictive\nHealth Initiative of the Emory University Woodruff Health\nSciences Center.\nReferences\n1 Woolf SH, Johnson RE, Phillips RL Jr et al.
