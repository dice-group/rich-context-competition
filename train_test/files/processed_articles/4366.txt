We analyzed the risk factors for digestive and urologic hemorrhage during rt-PA\ntherapy.\nMethods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with AIS who underwent intravenous thromb-\nolysis with rt-PA during a 5-year period in a Chinese stroke center. Data on the demographics,\nmedical history, laboratory test results, and clinical outcomes were collected.\nResults: 338 patients with AIS were eligible and included. Logistic regression multivariate analysis\nshowed that gastric catheter was significantly correlated with digestive hemorrhage, while age and\nurinary catheter were significantly correlated with urologic hemorrhage. Most hemorrhagic events\nwere associated with catheterization after 1 to 24 hours of rt-PA therapy.\nConclusions: In summary, gastric and urinary catheters were correlated with digestive and\nurologic hemorrhage in patients with AIS undergoing rt-PA therapy. Well-designed controlled\nstudies with large samples are required to confirm our findings.\n",

In addition to endovascular ther-\napy, intravenous thrombolysis with\nrecombinant tissue plasminogen activator\n(rt-PA) has been considered the most effect-\nive method against AIS,3 showing signifi-\ncant improvement in the survival rate and\nquality of life of patients with AIS.\nHowever, intravenous thrombolysis with\nrt-PA is associated with a risk of hemor-\nrhage. Patients with serious hemorrhage\nusually have a poor clinical prognosis with\na mortality rate of up to 90%.4 Most studies\nto date have focused on cerebral hemor-\nrhage as a complication of intravenous\nthrombolysis. For instance, one study\nshowed that the presence of leukoaraiosis\nmight increase the risk of intracerebral\nhemorrhage after intravenous thrombolysis\nin patients with AIS.5 However, the events\nassociated with peripheral hemorrhage have\nbeen rarely discussed despite the fact that\nthese events also affect the survival of\npatients with AIS who undergo intravenous\nthrombolysis with rt-PA.6 In the present\nstudy, we analyzed the risk factors for\ndigestive and urologic hemorrhage with the\naim of enabling more patients with AIS to\ngain benefits from rt-PA therapy.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy design\nWe retrospectively analyzed patients with\nAIS who underwent intravenous\nthrombolysis with rt-PA during a 5-year\nwell-known stroke center in China (Xuanwu\nHospital, Capital Medical University,\nBeijing). Data on the patients' demograph-\nics, medical history, laboratory test results,\nand clinical outcomes were collected.\nFor intravenous thrombolysis, rt-PA\n(Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH,\nIngelheim, Germany) was administered at\nPatient selection\nEligible patients were required to meet the\nfollowing criteria: age of !18 years, onset\nwithin 4.5 hours, !1-hour duration of clin-\nical signs related to stroke, no findings of\nintracranial hemorrhage or early large-area\ncerebral infarction on brain computed\ntomography, and provision of informed\nconsent. The exclusion criteria were absence\nof intact records during rt-PA therapy,\nperformance of arterial thrombolysis after\nfailure of intravenous thrombolysis, and\ncontraindications for rt-PA therapy.\nData collection\nWe used an electrocardiogram monitor\n(IntelliVue MP70; Philips Healthcare,\nUSA) to collect the patients' vital signs.\nThe registered clinical data included sex,\nage, vital signs, height, weight, body mass\nindex, thrombolysis time window, drug\nadministration, and history of hypertension,\ndiabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, drink-\ning, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrilla-\ntion, stroke, transient ischemic attack,\npeptic ulcer, surgery, and trauma/falls.\nTwenty-five laboratory parameters were\nmeasured from routine blood, biochemical,\nand coagulation tests, and brain computed\ntomography scans were performed. All\npatients were evaluated using the National\nInstitutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)\nand activities of daily living (ADL) scale.\nStudy outcomes\nPeripheral hemorrhage such as digestive and\nurologic hemorrhage occurring within 36\nhours of intravenous thrombolysis were the\nmain outcomes in the present study. The\ndiagnosis of digestive hemorrhage was\ndependent on gastric juice and feces test\nresults, while the presence of positive red\nblood cells on routine urinalysis was neces-\nsary for a diagnosis of urologic hemorrhage.\nStatistical analysis\nWe used EpiData 3.1 (EpiData, Odense,\nDenmark) to set up the database with\ndouble-personnel data entry and SPSS\nv.18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) to\nanalyze the data. For all tests, differences\nwere considered statistically significant at a\nEthical considerations\nThis study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee of Capital Medical University.\nPrior to entering the study, all patients were\ninformed of the study procedures.\nResults\nIn total, 338 patients with AIS were eligible\nand included in the study.

One study focused on 1044\npatients with AIS who underwent intraven-\nous thrombolysis with rt-PA and found that\nhypertension at baseline was closely\ncorrelated with hemorrhagic events.9\nBlood pressure control (systolic blood\npressure < 185 mmHg, diastolic blood\npressure < 185 mmHg) has been confirmed\nto be beneficial in preventing hemorrhagic\nevents after rt-PA therapy.10 The NIHSS\nscore is another important index for pre-\ndicting hemorrhagic events after rt-PA ther-\napy. An NIHSS score of >25 is generally\nthought to be a contraindication for rt-PA\ntherapy.11 Our analyses revealed the follow-\ning risk factors: the systolic blood pressure\nat baseline, the NIHSS and ADL scores\nbefore rt-PA therapy, and administration of\na single aspirin dose or aspirin combined\nwith clopidogrel within 24 hours after rt-PA\ntherapy. Various drugs such as cortisol,\naspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs are known to potentially result in\nstomach ulcers and bleeding.12\nWe identified the following risk factors\nfor urologic hemorrhage: age, the NIHSS\nand ADL scores before rt-PA therapy, use\nof low-molecular-weight heparin after rt-PA\nTable 8.

Male patients are usually\nmore vulnerable to hemorrhagic events.14\nPotential selection bias could be another\nreason. For instance, fewer older patients\nunderwent rt-PA therapy because of the\nhigher risk with age. The male:female ratio\nsample. Solutions to these problems might\ninclude expansion of the sample size, inclu-\nsion of multiple populations, and proper\nrandomization. The multivariate logistic\nregression analysis showed that catheteriza-\ntion was an independent risk factor for\npatients with AIS undergoing rt-PA ther-\napy. Impairments during catheterization\nmight give rise to hemorrhagic events.\nIn summary, gastric and urinary cath-\neterization were respectively correlated with\ndigestive and urologic hemorrhage in\npatients with AIS undergoing rt-PA ther-\napy.
