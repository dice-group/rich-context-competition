Specifically, an individual will behave altruistically toward\nanother when the cost of behaving altruistically (c) is less than the product of the\nreproductive benefits (b) and the degree of genetic relatedness (r) between the actor and\nrecipient (c < br). However, additional factors can influence the probability of behaving\naltruistically toward kin. For example, disorders that limit mating frequency or conception\nprobability reduce the likelihood of passing on genes. Hence, people may be less altruistic\ntoward kin with such reproductive limitations because of the decreased chances of passing\non the gene responsible for altruism.\nAltruism and reproductive limitations\nThe results of several studies on mothers and children suggest that this is the case.\nMann (1992) examined the behavior of human mothers with premature monozygotic twins;\none twin was physically healthy and the other possessed a disability. She found that these\nmothers displayed a behavioral preference for their healthy twin by the time the infants\nwere 4 months of age. Bereczkei (2001) observed that Hungarian mothers provided more\ncare (e.g., longer periods of breast feeding) to healthy than high risk (e.g., low birth weight)\ninfants. Scheper-Hughes (1985) found that economically disadvantaged Brazilian mothers\nwere emotionally detached from their sick or deformed children, perhaps because these\nmothers could not afford to invest limited resources on a child who would most likely die\nor require extensive resources to function adequately. The mothers would neglect the child,\nwho would usually then starve to death--suggesting that mothers may invest more in\nchildren who do not display signs of diminished reproductive value.\nBurnstein et al. (1994) discovered that people said they would act more\naltruistically toward a healthy sibling than a sibling whose visible or known disability\nsignals a decreased chance of reproducing. However, the reproductive limitations that\nBernstein et al. examined were global indicators: age and general health. We know\nrelatively little about how siblings might behave toward one another when they have more\nspecific types of reproductive limitations (e.g., specific types of illnesses). It is plausible\nthat altruism toward siblings may differ depending upon the type of reproductive limitation.\nTherefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine how genetic relatedness and\ndifferent types of reproductive limitations influence altruistic behavior at three levels of\naltruistic costliness.\nReproductive Limitations\nReproductive limitations can differ in severity, permanence, and the degree to\nwhich they are obvious to an observer. For example, a woman in her 50s is likely to exhibit\nobvious cues of being post-menopausal, a severe and permanent reproductive limitation (te\nVelde, Dorland, and Broekmans, 1998). On the other hand, a 25 year old homosexual male\nmay exhibit no obvious reproductive limitation; others may or may not know that he is\nhomosexual. Since homosexuals can (and many do) produce biological offspring,\nhomosexuality is not necessarily a severe or permanent reproductive limitation.\nWe know that people possess evolved psychological mechanisms that evaluate a\nperson's mate value, and that these mechanisms predispose people to prefer and seek out\nmates with characteristics indicative of high mate value (Miller, 2001). For example, men\nprefer youthful, healthy women with a .70 hip-to-waist ratio (Singh, 1993); women prefer\nmen who appear wealthy, dominant, prestigious, athletic, and socially competent (Betzig,\nWignarajah, and Andersen, 2003; Hughes and Gallup, 2003). Therefore, it is also likely\nthat similar mechanisms influence altruistic behavior towards kin. In other words, just as\npeople evaluate reproductive potential in choosing mating partners, they may also evaluate\nreproductive potential in assessing whether or not to behave altruistically toward an\nindividual. In this study, we manipulated functional, physical, and sexual limitations, each\ndiffering in level of severity.\nAltruism and reproductive limitations\nFunctional reproductive limitations.\nPsychological disorders that disrupt overall mental and behavioral functioning can\nalso decrease the probability of reproduction (Havercamp, Propping, and Hilger, 1982;\nLane, Byrne, Mulvany, Kinsella, Waddingtong, Walsh, Larkin, and O'Callaghan 1995;\nNanko and Moridaira, 1993). Havercamp et al. (1982), for example, found a significant\ndecrease in the marital rates and reproduction rates of schizophrenics compared to base\nrates from the national census. Less severe forms of mental illness may also impair\nreproductive success. For instance, schizoid personality disorder has been described as a\nprecursor to schizophrenia (Perez-Alvarez, 2003). People who suffer from schizoid\npersonality disorder tend to be solitary and have relatively little interest in `having sexual\nexperiences with another person' (American Psychiatric Association, 1994, p. 638).\nThere are at least two plausible reasons why people would exhibit less altruistic\nbehavior toward persons with mental illness. First, people may consider reproductive cues\nwhen making decisions about altruistic behavior because altruism is a means of indirectly\nenhancing one's own inclusive fitness (Hamilton, 1964). Given the lower marital and\nreproduction rates among schizophrenics (Havercamp et al., 1982; Lane et al., 1995; Nanko\nand Moridaira, 1993), helping schizophrenic kin would have a lower fitness payoff than\nhelping kin who are not mentally ill. Second, the mentally ill are less likely to be\ncooperative and to behave altruistically (McGuire, Fawzy, Spar, Weigel, and Troisi, 1994).\nAs Trivers' (1971) reciprocal altruism theory proposed, people are more likely to act\naltruistically to those who will reciprocate the favor in the future (Essock-Vitale and\nMcGuire, 1980; Stewart-Williams, 2007). People behave in ways that signal their traits and\ntemperament; similarly, people possess mechanisms for recognizing traits and\ntemperaments (Buss, 1991; McGuire et al., 1994). Thus, it is also likely that people may be\nless likely to behave altruistically toward the mentally ill because they believe that altruistic\nbehaviors toward them may go unreciprocated.\nPhysical reproductive limitations.\nNumerous studies have found that physical stature is related to attractiveness (Buss\n1993). For example, women prefer tall men as mates over short men (Buss and Schmitt,\nWeight is also a physical indicator of reproductive value. The female body must\ncontain at least 22% body fat in order to maintain reproductive ability (Frisch, 1987).\nWomen of reproductive age who do not meet this minimum level of body fat typically stop\novulating. Women who are obese also have greater difficulty conceiving than women of\nnormal weight (Norman, Noakes, Wu, Davies, Moran, and Wang, 2004). Men prefer\nmating partners who are of average weight over women who are excessively thin or\noverweight (Rozin and Fallon, 1988). Weight also affects men's reproductive capacity and\nattractiveness. Women tend to prefer men of moderate weight, with a slightly athletic build\nover excessively thin or overweight men (Dixon et al., 2003; Hughes and Gallup, 2003).\nWeight is also correlated with sperm count. Decreased sperm count and sperm\nconcentration has been found in underweight males (body mass index < 20 kg/m\u00b2) (Jenson,\nAndersen, Jorgenson, Andersen, Carlsen, Petersen, and Skakkebaek, 2004). In addition, an\nincrease in weight correlates negatively with testosterone level (Kley, Solbach, McKinnan,\nand Kruskemper, 1979). Low levels of testosterone decrease males' sex drive and therefore\nAltruism and reproductive limitations\ndecrease reproductive success. Thus, weight is an obvious reproductive limitation,\nsomewhat severe, and not necessarily permanent. Weight can fluctuate depending on\ncaloric intake and expenditure.\nSexual reproductive limitations.\nSexual reproductive limitations refer to a person's predisposition to engage in\nsexual activities that do not lead to reproduction. If a person is homosexual, for example, he\nor she is less likely to reproduce because the sexual behavior that he or she pursues will not\nlead to reproduction. This also holds true, to a lesser extent, for bisexuality. Although\nhomosexuals have substantially lower rates of reproducing than heterosexuals (Bell and\nWeinberg, 1978; Saghir and Robins, 1973), sexual orientation is certainly not as obvious\nas, say, schizophrenia or malnourishment. Although some homosexuals exhibit behavioral\nor sartorial cues that are associated with homosexuality, this is not the case for all, or\nperhaps most, homosexuals. Homosexuality, thus, is not an obvious reproductive\nlimitation. It is also not necessarily severe, in that homosexuals are physically capable of\nreproducing.\nThere is conflicting evidence regarding homosexuality and inclusive fitness. E. O.\nWilson (1975, 1978) theorized that homosexuals would have a greater willingness to aid\ntheir kin than heterosexuals because homosexuals are more likely to pass on their altruism\ngene through investing in kin members than through engaging in reproduction. Vasey,\nPocock, and VanderLaan (2007) found support for this among androphilic fa'afafine in\nIndependent Samoa. Other research has found that homosexuals are just as likely as\nheterosexuals to aid their heterosexual kin (Bobrow and Bailey, 2001; Rahman and Hull,\n2005), but no studies to date have examined whether heterosexual people would be just as\nlikely to help homosexual kin. However, because homosexuality and bisexuality are\nreproductive limitations, people may be less likely to aid homosexual or bisexual kin\nmembers.\nTypes of Altruism\nAltruistic decisions in the current study were categorized based on the costs to the\naltruist and the benefits to the recipient. We used three levels of altruism: everyday,\nextraordinary, and life-threatening. Following Burnstein et al. (1994), everyday altruism\nconsists of situations in which the cost to the altruist is minor, such as driving someone to\nwork. In everyday altruistic instances, the altruist still suffers some cost, but that cost is not\ndetrimental to his or her living situation (e.g., it is not financially harmful) nor is it life-\nthreatening. The example of everyday altruism used in this study describes buying a few\nminor items from the grocery store. Extraordinary altruistic acts include a greater cost and\nbenefit than everyday altruism. Extraordinary altruism consists of altruistic acts that benefit\nthe recipient at a large, but not dangerous, cost to the altruist. The altruist will not risk his\nor her life with this act, but the cost may bring great financial discomfort. The example of\nextraordinary altruism included in this study describes loaning someone $10,000. The final\nlevel of altruism is life-threatening altruism. This type of altruism is made up of life-or-\ndeath situations in which the altruist may save the recipient's life, but may lose his or her\nown life in the process. Rescuing someone from a burning house and donating a kidney are\nprime examples of life-threatening altruism (Burnstein et al., 1994; Stewart-Williams,\nAltruism and reproductive limitations\n2008). However, the burning house example represents the life-threatening altruism\nscenario used in this study.\nInclusive Fitness and Reproductive Limitations\nAlthough genetic relatedness may play a role in low-level altruism conditions, the\neffect is not very pronounced (Stewart-Williams, 2007). This is because the cost of the act\nis very small (e.g., running some errands or picking up a few groceries) (Burnstein et al.,\n1994). In this study, genetic relatedness is unlikely to influence low-level altruism because\nthe costs and benefits are not biologically significant. Thus, reproductive limitations should\nalso not influence everyday altruism.\nHypothesis 1: Genetic relatedness and reproductive limitations will not\nhave significant influences on participants' responses to hypothetical\neveryday altruism.\nWith extraordinary altruism, the altruist is making a considerable personal sacrifice\nbut not risking his or her life. Nevertheless, the benefit that the recipient receives is great\nenough to increase the quality of his or her life. Therefore, genetic relatedness should\ninfluence extraordinary altruism. However, previous research has not shown that\nreproductive limitations moderate the relationship between genetic relatedness and\nextraordinary altruism (Burnstein et al., 1994). This is probably due to the lack of\nbiological danger to the altruist. Helping this recipient (even with a reproductive limitation)\nwill not decrease the altruist's probability of survival and reproduction.\nHypothesis 2: As degree of genetic relatedness increases, extraordinary\naltruism ratings will increase as well, but reproductive limitations will not\nhave a significant influence on participants' responses.\nOnce the biological costs and benefits of an altruistic act reach the point of potential\nlife or death, genetic relatedness and reproductive limitations are both relevant. At this\nlevel of altruism, all factors that may influence the probability of one passing on the\naltruism gene are taken into account. As degree of genetic relatedness decreases, the\nprobability of that relative having the altruism gene decreases, and the likelihood of helping\nthat relative decreases as well. Also, if someone possesses a limitation that may inhibit the\nreproduction of the altruism gene, then the likelihood of helping that person decreases.\nHypothesis 3: As the degree of genetic relatedness increases, life-\nthreatening altruism ratings will increase; and as the degree of\nreproductive limitation increases (for each reproductive limitation),\naltruism ratings will decrease.\nIf, as we have argued, people will be less likely to aid kin with reproductive\nlimitations, the kin least likely to receive help would be those with the most obvious,\nsevere, and permanent limitation. Therefore, among the reproductive limitations that we are\nexamining, people with functional limitations (schizophrenia and schizoid personality\ndisorder) would receive less altruistic behavior than those with physical (underweight) or\nsexual (homosexuality and bisexuality) reproductive limitations.\nHypothesis 4: Altruism ratings toward recipients with functional reproductive\nlimitations will be significantly lower than altruism ratings toward all other\nrecipients.\nAltruism and reproductive limitations\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Design\nCentral Michigan University who volunteered to participate for extra course credit. Each\naltruism condition consisted of 104 participants (70 females and 34 males). The average\nReproductive limitations, degree of severity, and genetic relatedness were within-\nsubject variables whereas level of altruism was a between-subject variable. The study\ndesign crossed three levels of genetic relatedness (friend, half-sibling, and sibling) with\nthree types of reproductive limitations (functional, physical, and sexual) in three levels of\nhypothetical altruism (everyday, extraordinary, and life-threatening). Each reproductive\nlimitation contained two degrees of severity (mild and severe) and a no-limitation control.\nThe dependent variable was the participants' estimates of their likelihood to act\naltruistically toward each hypothetical person.\nStimulus Materials and Measures\nThe stimulus materials consisted of questionnaires containing 42 descriptions of\nfictional people - 21 male and 21 female - described as having different degrees of genetic\nrelatedness and reproductive limitations. Three levels of genetic relatedness were used:\nfriend (r = 0), half-sibling (r = .25), and sibling (r = .50). As described above, three types\nof reproductive limitations were used (functional, physical, and sexual), each with two\ndegrees of severity and a no-limitation control, resulting in six possible reproductive\nlimitations and a control. Therefore, each of the 42 descriptions was generated to focus on\none specific reproductive limitation for the hypothetical males and females of each degree\nof genetic relatedness (3 degrees of genetic relatedness x 2 sexes x 7 possible reproductive\nlimitations including the control).\nEvery description revealed five manipulated details of each hypothetical person:\ntheir sex, their genetic relation to the participant, and their reproductive value within each\nof the three types of reproductive limitations manipulated in this study. Each description\nrepresented one reproductive limitation while all other limitations were held constant at the\ncontrol level (e.g., if a person was described as being schizophrenic, then he was also\ndescribed as being heterosexual and maintaining a healthy weight). Example stimulus\nmaterials are presented in Table 4 in the Appendix.\nFor functional reproductive limitations, the target individuals were described as\nhaving either schizoid personality disorder (mild) or schizophrenia (severe). In the case of\nsexual limitations, we created scenarios in which the target persons were either bisexual\n(mild) or homosexual (severe). Finally, people evidencing physical reproductive limitations\nwere described as underweight (mild) or severely underweight (severe). These descriptions\nwere held in accordance with the body mass index (BMI). To limit variability within each\nweight level, a specific weight was assigned for each weight level. A healthy weight is\nclassified as a BMI  25 kg/m\u00b2 (Flegal, Carroll, Kuczmarski, and Johnson, 1998). A BMI \nmales in the healthy weight condition were described as weighing 170 lbs. Also, a BMI \n25 kg/m\u00b2 is equal to a person who is 5' 4\" weighing no more than 145 lbs., so the females\nin the healthy weight condition were described as weighing 140 lbs. The next two levels of\nAltruism and reproductive limitations\nthe physical limitation variable were categorized as such: underweight (BMI = 20 kg/m\u00b2)\nweighing 140 lbs. Therefore, all males in the underweight condition were described as\nlbs. As for the severely underweight condition, in accordance with a BMI = 15 kg/m\u00b2,\nmales were described as 5' 10\" weighing 105 lbs. and females were described as 5' 4\"\nweighing 88 lbs. The target individuals in the control condition were described as being\nheterosexual, maintaining a healthy weight (i.e., 140 lbs. for females and 170 lbs. for\nmales), and exhibiting no abnormal behavior.\nThree other details pertaining to the hypothetical people were held constant. In all\ndescriptions, the hypothetical individuals were depicted as having no children. Height of\neach person was rounded to the nearest inch from the average height for males (5' 10\") and\nfemales (5'4\") in the United States (Tanner and Davies, 1985). Age of the individuals was\nheld at 25-years-old.\nThe 42 descriptions were randomly placed within each of the altruism condition\nquestionnaires. Everyday altruism depicted a hypothetical scenario involving picking up a\nfew small items from the store for the hypothetical target person; extraordinary altruism\ninvolved a scenario in which the participant loans the target person $10,000; and life-\nthreatening altruism depicted theoretically rescuing the target person from a burning house.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of the three altruism conditions. In each\ncondition, participants were asked, \"What is the likelihood of you helping him/her?\"\nResponses were recorded using a 9-point bipolar scale in which 1 = highly unlikely and 9 =\nhighly likely.\nProcedure\nSessions began with the experimenter reading the consent form. Participants signed\ntwo consent forms, returned one to the researcher, and kept the second copy for themselves.\nNext, participants received a questionnaire in their randomly-assigned altruism condition.\nFor each description, participants indicated their likelihood of performing the altruistic act\nby circling a number on the 9-point bipolar scale that was located below every description.\nSessions ended when the researcher collected the stimulus materials and debriefed the\nparticipants.\nResults\nParticipants reported their likelihood of helping a male and a female in each cell of\nthe study design. Target sex did not elicit any significant effects, nor did it interact with any\nof the variables so target sex was collapsed and the average of these two ratings (male and\nfemale target) was the dependent measure entered into all analyses. Participant sex did not\nelicit any significant effects as well.\nAltruism ratings for each of the three types of reproductive limitations were entered\ninto separate 3 (degree of limitation: none, mild, and severe) X 3 (genetic relatedness:\nfriend, half-sibling, and sibling) repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) for\neach level of altruism, resulting in nine ANOVAs overall. Because there were three\nANOVAs conducted at each altruism level (one for each reproductive limitation) that\nAltruism and reproductive limitations\nshared common control groups (i.e., no limitation at each level of genetic relatedness), the\nalpha level for overall tests was set at .016.\nIn the everyday altruism condition, differences in genetic relatedness and in\nreproductive limitations had no effect on hypothetical altruistic behavior. However, within\nthe extraordinary altruism and life-threatening altruism conditions, greater genetic\nrelatedness resulted in higher altruism ratings. There was a main effect for genetic\nrelatedness in all but the everyday altruism condition, so in the reporting of results below\nwe will only focus on main effects of reproductive limitations and interactions between\nreproductive limitations and genetic relatedness. See Tables 1, 2, and 3 for the mean\naltruism ratings and ANOVA results pertaining to genetic relatedness.\nFunctional Reproductive Limitations\nIn the extraordinary altruism condition, functional reproductive limitations\nanalyses revealed simple main effects for degree of functional limitation at all levels of\nto hypothetically help siblings with no symptoms than siblings with schizoid symptoms and\nschizophrenic symptoms, but there were no differences in treatment directed toward\nsiblings with schizoid and schizophrenic symptoms. The same relationship was found with\nfriends. However, participants also indicated a greater likelihood to help half-siblings with\nno symptoms than those with schizoid symptoms, and a greater likelihood of help half-\nsiblings with schizoid symptoms than those with schizophrenic symptoms.\nFunctional limitations interacted with genetic relatedness in the life-threatening\naltruism condition as well. Further analyses found functional limitations to have significant\nindicated a greater likelihood of hypothetically helping siblings with no functional\nlimitation than both siblings with schizoid symptoms and siblings with schizophrenic\nsymptoms; the latter two groups did not differ significantly. The same relationship was\nfound with half-siblings. Participants' intentions to perform life-threatening altruism were\nhigher toward friends with no limitation than friends with schizoid symptoms, and more\nlikely to provide the same help to friends with schizoid symptoms than friends with\nschizophrenic symptoms.

We found, as expected, that genetic relatedness\nand reproductive limitations were unrelated to everyday altruism. That is, people indicated\nthey would be just as likely to give routine help to friends as kin, and to those with\nreproductive limitations as to those without such limitations. However, as the cost of\naltruism increased, genetic relatedness and reproductive limitations became more\ninfluential in decisions about altruistic behavior.\nFunctional limitations had the strongest influence on altruistic intentions. People in\nthe extraordinary and life-threatening altruism conditions indicated they would be least\nlikely to help siblings, half-siblings, and friends who exhibited these abnormal behaviors.\nThese decreased altruism ratings could be the product of at least three evolved cognitive\nmechanisms. One mechanism focuses on the recipients' reproductive potential. People are\nless likely to be altruistic if the recipients' future reproductive potential is decreased\nmechanisms that influence reciprocal altruism (Trivers, 1971) and stigma avoidance\n(Kurzban and Leary, 2001; Tybur, Lieberman, and Griskevicius, in press), may account for\nthese decreased altruism ratings as well, particularly among non-kin. People are more likely\nto be altruistic toward those who will reciprocate later. Therefore, people will be less\naltruistic toward kin and friends who exhibit abnormal social behavior because they will be\nless likely to help the altruist in the future. Finally, people also tend to avoid others who\nexhibit signs of carrying pathogens or who behave abnormally. They probably do so in\norder to avoid disease or physical or psychological harm (Kurzban and Leary, 2001; Tybur\net al., in press). Both of these two mechanisms may also account for the decreased altruism\nratings toward people with functional limitations.\nThe mechanisms described above may also influence altruistic decision-making\ntoward people with physical limitations. Being severely underweight indicates being\nmalnourished, and being malnourished is associated with decreased reproductive potential\n(Frisch, 1987; Jensen, et al., 2004). Thus, people may have indicated a lowered likelihood\nof helping severely underweight kin because of their decreased probability of reproducing\nand passing on the altruism gene. If a kin member's reproductive potential decreases, the\nlikelihood of altruism toward that person also decreases. Our results supported this\nreproduction argument, except for extraordinary altruism among half-siblings, which\nshowed no significant differences between the degrees of physical limitation. This could be\ndue to negative feelings associated with half-siblings. In order to have a half-sibling, one\nparent must have reproduced with a person other than the altruist's second parent. This\nimplies a number of unpleasant possibilities (e.g., divorce, death of a parent, or an affair).\nParticipants indicated significantly lower altruism ratings toward half-siblings when\ncompared to full siblings, and half-siblings received significantly higher altruism ratings\nwhen compared to friends; so genetic relatedness played a role in the altruistic intentions.\nHowever, participants may not want to loan money to their half-siblings because of these\nnegative associations, regardless of whether or not the half-sibling is healthy.\nLower altruism ratings towards severely underweight friends may also be due to\npathogen avoidance (Kurzban and Leary, 2001; Tybur et al., in press). Participants may\nAltruism and reproductive limitations\navoid severely underweight friends because malnourishment can be a sign of an infectious\ndisease. To avoid contracting the disease, people might be less likely to interact with an\nextremely thin person, thereby decreasing the probability of altruism. Additionally, an\nextremely malnourished person may also be too physically weak to reciprocate.\nAltruism ratings toward kin and friends with sexual limitations support an inclusive\nfitness explanation. When asked about providing hypothetical extraordinary altruism,\nparticipants revealed a lowered likelihood of helping siblings and half-siblings with sexual\nlimitations, but indicated no significant difference between heterosexual friends, bisexual\nfriends, and homosexual friends. Similar results were found in the life-threatening altruism\ncondition, but participants also indicated a decreased likelihood to help bisexual and\nhomosexual friends than heterosexual friends. Because we saw the same relationship with\nsiblings and half-siblings, the data suggest that altruists may generally favor those with a\ngreater reproductive value. However, a number of different social factors could have led to\nthe decreased altruism ratings toward bisexual and homosexual friends; therefore future\nstudy in this area would be helpful.\nThat people were more likely to hypothetically help those with no reproductive\nlimitation over those with a reproductive limitation, regardless of genetic relatedness, was a\nparticularly interesting finding and one that warrants additional research. It may be that it is\nin a person's own reproductive interests to aid non-kin of high reproductive value because\nthat may give him or her more chances to reproduce. It may also allow for the\nestablishment of future alliances that may improve his or her fitness (e.g., future reciprocal\nexchange) or improve the chances of his or her kin reproducing.\nLimitations and Conclusions\nBecause these descriptions did not represent any actual people, participants may not\nhave given their decisions very much in-depth reasoning before responding. For instance,\nfriends are generally the exception to the theory that people give higher levels of altruism\nto kin than non-kin (Stewart-Williams, 2007, 2008), which is mainly because people share\nhigher levels of emotional closeness with their friends than with their family (Kruger, 2003;\nStewart-Williams, 2007, 2008). Because this study focused on fictional people, no\nemotional closeness between the participants and recipients was shared which may have led\nto the lower altruism ratings toward friends when compared to half-siblings and full\nsiblings. Also, given that these descriptions were hypothetical, participants may not have\nfully grasped the risks described for each altruism condition. Also, because people are\nactually not \"at risk\" in hypothetical situations, this could have led to inflated scores in the\nlife-threatening altruism condition.\nAs is consistent with Hamilton's rule (c < br), participants may not be taking\nreproductive limitations into account until they reach a certain level of reproductive\ninhibition. However, different reproductive limitations may have different influential\nstrength, causing each limitation to influence altruism at different degrees of limitation. Our\nresults support the idea that altruism may be influenced by a recipient's potential health\nthroughout his or her lifetime. For instance, malnourished and underweight people are able\nto gain back weight (and reproductive status). People were significantly more likely to risk\ntheir lives to save a kin member with a physical limitation than a kin member with a\nfunctional limitation or a sexual limitation, possibly because the physical limitations can be\nseen as temporary. Similarly, people were more willing to help a kin member with a sexual\nAltruism and reproductive limitations\nlimitation over a kin member with a functional limitation, possibly because bisexual and\nhomosexual kin probably stand a better chance of reproducing.\nFinally, our results suggest that participants were intuitively aware of reproductive\nlimitations and (possibly) limits on the ability to reciprocate. Reproduction was never\nmentioned in this study until after the participants had completed the questionnaire and\nwere debriefed. Yet, the data indicate that participants were significantly less likely to help\nthose with a reproductive limitation or those who may have been less likely to reciprocate\n(i.e., those with schizophrenia). People thus seem to perceive different types of\nreproductive limitations which decrease their likelihood of altruism toward people who\npossess them.\n"
