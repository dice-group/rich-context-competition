Reynolds3\n'Andrus Gerontology Center, University of Southern California.\n2Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan.\n'Department of Gerontology, University of South Florida.\nThe Longitudinal Study on Aging (LSOA) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) are used to examine\nchange in the prevalence of disabilityfrom 1982 through 1993 for persons 70 years of age and over. Changes in the\nlikelihood of becoming disabled and the likelihood of recoveringfrom disability also are investigated with the LSOA.\nThere is some evidencefor improving disability status among the old. Theprevalence ofdisability is somewhat lower in\nmore recentyears in the NHIS; also, the incidence of disability is lower, and the rate of recovery higher during 1988-\nthe LSOA sample. In both datasets, there is fluctuation rather than a clear trend in the prevalence of disability.\nContinued steady improvement in rates of onset and recovery and a consistent trend toward improving prevalence is\nneeded before concluding that we are witnessing the beginning of an ongoing trend toward improving health among\nthe older population.\nDISABILITY among elderly persons is a major personal,\nfamilial, and social concern. Documenting trends in\ndisability and understanding their causes is important for\nhow individuals, families, and societies plan for providing\nhealth care and long-term care in the future. This is particu-\nlarly true for those planning for the provision of care to older\nage groups. Elderly persons will increasingly become the\nmajority of the United States population needing long-term\ncare because of chronic disability.\nAt any given time, the proportion of older persons dis-\nabled in a population is determined by past rates of incidence\nof disability, past rates of restoration in functioning, and the\nhistory of death rates of the disabled and nondisabled per-\nsons in the population. This study examines change from\nrates affecting this prevalence among the community-\ndwelling elderly population using data from the Longitudi-\nnal Study of Aging (LSOA) and the National Health Inter-\nview Survey (NHIS). Four questions are addressed: (1) is\nprevalence of disability, (2) in the likelihood of older per-\nsons becoming disabled, (3) in the likelihood of recovery\nfrom disability, or (4) in the likelihood of dying when\ndisabled or nondisabled? Thus, we are looking for evidence\nof change in the prevalence of disability in the older popula-\ntion and in the processes that affect this level of disability.\nBackground\nPrevious investigations of trends in the prevalence of\ndisability in the adult population have indicated that, for\nmost adult age groups, reported disability-prevalence in-\ncreased in the U.S. through the 1970s and into the early\nhowever, increases in disability were not observed among\nSchneider and Guralnik, 1987). While some have expressed\nskepticism about the validity of observed increases in the\nprevalence of disability (Waidmann, Bound, and Schoen-\nbaum, 1995), others have noted that with declining mortality\nfrom chronic conditions it is possible that the prevalence of\ndisability could increase (Crimmins, 1990; Crimmins, Hay-\nsuggested that the general increase in adult disability in the\n1970s may have been replaced by stability during the first\nof disability in the population aged 65 and over. Trends in\nthe incidence of disability are the most important determi-\nnant of trends in the prevalence of disability (Crimmins,\nHayward, and Saito, 1994); however, there have been fewer\nstudies of trends in the incidence of disability. Crimmins and\nIngegneri (1993) report that the period of increased disability\nprevalence during the 1970s also was a time of increased\nincidence among the age groups whose prevalence in-\ncreased. They also reported that for those 75 years of age and\nover there was no change in either prevalence or incidence\ntional Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS), Manton, Corder,\nand Stallard (1993) report a decrease in the incidence of\ndisability, as well as the prevalence of disability, among the\nBecause understanding the current state of disability is\nimperative for predicting our future needs for long-term\ncare, we use additional sources of information on disability\nin the older population to examine recent change. The annual\nprevalence of disability among those 70 years of age and\nis a source of reliable annual age-specific measures of the\nprevalence of disability. In addition, the LSOA -- more\nsimilar in design to the NLTCS -- is another source of\nand 1990); it allows examination of change over three\nperiods in the processes that determine prevalence. A pattern\nof systematic time change in prevalence as well as change in\nincidence and recovery rates from disability would provide\ngreater understanding of the current and future level of\ndisability among the older population.\nRecent Improvement in the Incidence and Prevalence\nof Disability\nBefore presenting our results, we will discuss in some\ngreater detail the findings of Manton, Corder, and Stallard\n(1993) from the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS).\nThis is a third data source that has been used to examine\nrecent change in prevalence of disability among the older\npopulation; it is the only source other than the LSOA of\ninformation on incidence change for the national population\nsamples are representative of the United States Medicare\npopulation, which provides the sampling frame for this\nsurvey. About 20,000 people are screened or interviewed at\neach wave, including a new sample of young respondents, to\nmaintain the sample as one representative of the population\n65 years of age and older. The screening is used to identify\ndisabled people, who then receive a detailed interview. With\nthree waves of data, the NLTCS allows the examination of\nthe prevalence of disability at three dates and the incidence\nin two intervals.\nDisability status in the NLTCS is defined using informa-\ntion on ability to perform 8 instrumental activities of daily\nliving (IADLs: light housework, laundry, meal preparation,\ngrocery shopping, getting around outside, getting to places\noutside of walking distance, money management, and using\nthe telephone) and 6 activities of daily living (ADLs: eating,\ngetting in or out of bed, getting around inside, dressing,\nbathing, getting to the bathroom, or using the toilet). For a\nperson to be ADL-disabled in the NLTCS, it was necessary\nthat the person report that the activity \"had not been per-\nformed, or was not expected to be performed, without the\naid of another person or the use of equipment for at least 90\ndays.\" A person was IADL-disabled if he or she \"could not\nperform one of the IADLs for 90 + days because of disabil-\nity or health problems\" (Manton, Corder, and Stallard,\n1993). In the Manton and colleagues' analysis, people are\ndivided into those with IADL disability only, 1-2 ADLs, 3 -\n4 ADLs, 5-6 ADLs, and the institutionalized population.\nThe findings of Manton, Corder, and Stallard indicate a\nvery small (1.7%) but statistically significant decrease in the\npercent of the population 65 years of age and over who were\nwere not consistent, however, across types and levels of\ndisability. The percentage with IADL disabilities who were\nnot in institutions declined significantly (1.4%), but there\nwas no change in the percentage with ADL disability among\nthe noninstitutionalized. Change in the percentage of the\npopulation with a given level of ADL deficits was mixed.\nThere was no significant change in the prevalence of 1-2\nADL disabilities; the percentage with ADL disabilities in-\ncreased significantly (0.7%); and the percentage with 5-6\nADL disabilities declined significantly (0.9%). The decrease\n1989 was just statistically significant, but there was no\nchange in the percent institutionalized between 1984 and\nManton, Corder, and Stallard (1993) also report decreases\nin the incidence of disability among the noninstitutionalized\nperiod. For the nondisabled, the probability of becoming\ndisabled decreased and that of remaining nondisabled in-\ncreased. Both changes were statistically significant although\nthe absolute values of these incidence changes were small,\ni.e., generally the likelihood of an outcome changed by 1 to\n2 percent.\nA more detailed look at some of the reported transition\nprobabilities for the disabled group suggests that the evi-\ndence for reduction in disability is inconsistent. If disability\nwere decreasing for all, transition probabilities for move-\nments to better functioning states should increase, and prob-\nabilities toward deteriorating functioning should decrease,\nbut this does not describe the findings from the NLTCS.\nBecause the NLTCS intervals between waves are 2 years\nand 5 years, the researchers make assumptions to translate 2-\nyear rates into 5-year rates and 5-year rates into 2-year rates,\nand present results for both interval lengths. While results\nare not identical, generalizations drawn from either set are\nsimilar and the following discussion is based on the 2-year\ntransitions.\nExamination of the change in the 2-year disability transi-\ntions among the 65-and-over population indicates an in-\ncrease in the likelihood of remaining in each of the four\ndisability categories. This finding, coupled with an increase\nin the likelihood of remaining nondisabled, means the likeli-\nhood of staying in any functioning state, nondisabled or\ndisabled, increased. On the other hand, the likelihood of\nmaking a shift to any other functioning state, either better or\nworse, decreased in almost all cases. In 75 reported compari-\nsons of the age-specific percent changing disability state for\ntwo periods among those who began the period noninstitu-\ntionalized, only in six cases does the percent changing\nfunctioning state increase in the later period. Four are\nchanges representing deteriorating functioning; the other\ntwo are change toward improving functioning (Manton,\nCorder, and Stallard, 1993). In general, in later years, the\nlikelihood of becoming nondisabled was lower for all cate-\ngories of the disabled; the likelihood of going from a more-\ndisabled to a less-disabled state was lower; and the likeli-\nhood of going from a less-disabled to a more-disabled state\nwas lower. Thus, the evidence from the NLTCS on reduced\ndisability for the older population in the 1980s is somewhat\nmixed. Given the lack of consistency in the pattern of change\nfrom the NLTCS, it seems appropriate to use other available\ndata to examine the trends in disability for the older popula-\ntion in recent years.\nData\nThis analysis will use two datasets: the NHIS, a repeated\ncross-sectional sample that provides annual data on preva-\nlence from large samples of older persons, and the LSOA, a\nlongitudinal sample that provides information on prevalence\nat four dates and incidence during three intervals. This\ncombination of data provides a maximal number of data\npoints for observation of trends in both prevalence and\nincidence.\nThe NHIS is a continuous household survey of the nonin-\nstitutionalized population of all ages in the United States,\nwhich has been ongoing since 1957 with the express purpose\nof monitoring population health and health-care usage. Over\nthe years, the survey has been periodically modified to take\nadvantage of new approaches toward the measurement of\nhealth and functioning. These modifications make analysis\nof time trends across years of major survey redesign dif-\nBecause the 1982 changes were particularly important in\nredefining disability for those 70 and older, we examine\ntrends in disability among the population 70 years of age and\nage and over averages almost 9,000, providing a large\nsample for relatively precise estimates for each year.\nFor older persons, disability in the NHIS is defined by\nresponses to general questions on needs for help with per-\nsonal care and other routine needs. They can be viewed as\nshorthand versions of questions eliciting (a) ADL disability\nand (b) IADL disability without ADL disability. Respon-\ndents indicate whether \"any impairment or health problem\nresults in the need for help from another person with per-\nsonal care needs, such as eating, bathing, dressing, or\ngetting around the house.\" If they have no personal care\nneeds, they are asked whether \"health or impairment results\nin a need for help from other persons in handling routine\nneeds, such as everyday household chores, doing necessary\nbusiness, shopping, or getting around for other purposes.\"\nOur other dataset, the LSOA, began in 1984 as a supple-\nment to the NHIS. Those 70 years of age and over who\nparticipated in the 1984 interview became the basis for a\nlongitudinal sample (N = 7,527). A subsample of the\nmembers of the original sample were eligible for follow-up\nLSOA are provided in Kovar, Fitti, and Chyba (1992). We\nuse the sample of 5,151 respondents for the LSOA preva-\nlence analysis and add the additional 2,376 for the transition\nanalysis.\nFor the LSOA analysis, disability in ADLs is defined as\nbeing unable, because of health, to perform by oneself at\nleast one of five ADL activities (bathing, dressing, eating,\ngetting in and out of bed, toileting). IADL disability is an\ninability to perform at least one of five activities: preparing a\nmeal, shopping for personal items, managing money, using\nthe telephone, doing light housework.\nIn the LSOA the classification of the disabled involves the\nanswers to two questions for each ADL and IADL function.\nRespondents first answer a question worded as follows:\n\"Because of a health or physical problem, do you have any\ndifficulty (specific ADL or IADL)?\" If the answer is \"yes,\"\nthe next question is, \"By yourself (and without using special\nequipment -- ADL only) how much difficulty do you have\n(specific ADL or IADL)?\" If the response is \"unable to do\"\nfor one ADL or IADL function, the person is classified as\ndisabled. In the analysis people are designated as having\nADL disability, IADL disability without ADL disability, or\nnot disabled.\nEach of the three surveys, the NLTCS, the LSOA, and the\nNHIS, measure disability in two conceptual domains: per-\nsonal care and independent living. The operationalization in\nindividual surveys differs in the list of tasks included in each\ndomain and whether disability is defined in terms of need or\nreceipt of help, an inability to do a task alone, and how the\nuse of assistive devices is included. In addition, the NLTCS\nincludes a time dimension that limits disability to that of\nthree-months duration. Differences in the operationalization\nof this measurement lead to different reported levels of\ndisability (Wiener et al., 1990); our expectation, however, is\nthat underlying trends should be evident with any of these\noperational definitions.\nTo use the LSOA data to examine change over time, we\nneed to assure comparability of the LSOA results across\ntime. Because the initial LSOA sample does not include the\ninstitutionalized population, we eliminate any institutional-\nized persons from the later prevalence figures and institu-\ntionalized persons at the beginning of the interval for the\nincidence comparisons. In the LSOA sample there is no\naddition of younger sample members after the initial inter-\nview; thus, the youngest sample members are age 76 in\n1990, and we limit our analysis of the LSOA to those aged\nAttrition in the LSOA, as in any longitudinal survey, must\nbe taken into account for any analysis of time change in\neither prevalence or incidence. The percentage of the origi-\ncombination of imputation and weighting procedures to\nadjust for sample attrition. We recognize that sample loss is\nrelated to health status, and not correcting for it could affect\nthe observed levels of disability prevalence and incidence at\nlater waves. Therefore, we adjust for sample loss using\ntechniques that should result in sample outcomes reflecting\nthe incidence and prevalence of disability among the survi-\nvors of the initial sample.\nWe begin treatment of missing cases by imputing disabil-\nity status for those assumed to be alive who had reported\ndisability status in two waves prior, two waves after, or two\nwaves surrounding the missing interview. Imputations of\ndisability state are made probabilistically based on observed\ndisability transition outcomes in datasets representing pat-\nterns of disability across waves. About three-quarters of the\ndisability is adjusted for in this manner. The rest of the\nattrition is adjusted for by using an adjustment to the original\nsample weight based on the estimated probability of nonre-\nsponse from a regression equation including age, race, sex,\neducation, living arrangements, and interval as the predic-\ntors of nonresponse. Because of the structure of the analyses,\nweights differ for the prevalence and incidence analysis.\nFurther details on the imputation and weighting procedures\nare provided in Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994.\nResults presented from the LSOA data were tested for\nsensitivity to the analytic choices described above: the use of\nweights adjusting for attrition, the age range of the included\n7,527 sample. Findings are very robust; none of these\nchoices significantly influences either the substantive or the\nstatistical conclusions. The findings are somewhat sensitive,\nhowever, to the imputation for missing data, and this is\ndescribed later.\nWhile the LSOA survey intervals are roughly two years in\nlength, corrections still need to be made for small differences\nin actual interval length for the analysis of incidence of\ndisability and restoration of functioning. This is accom-\nplished through the inclusion of exposure time in the hazard\nmodels used in the analysis.\nMETHODS\nPrevalence\nThe statistical significance of change over time in the\nprevalence of disability is tested by examining the regression\ncoefficients indicating the time since the first observation in\nanalyses in which observations are pooled for the 12 dates\nfor the NHIS and for 4 dates for the LSOA. For the LSOA,\nthe wave of the survey is indicated using dummy variables\nwith the earliest year omitted as the reference category; for\nthe NHIS, years since 1982 is entered as a continuous\nvariable. In order to control for any compositional differ-\nences in the groups over time, age and sex are entered as\ncontrols. For the LSOA, these regressions take the form:\nIn (P/(l-P)) = a0\n+ a, Age + a2\nFemale\nFor the NHIS, there is one time variable indicating the\nnumber of years since 1982. In these analyses, P equals the\nprobability of being either ADL- or IADL-disabled versus\nno disability. Age is the age at the beginning of the interval\nin two-year age groups (76-96) for the LSOA and single\nyear of age for the NHIS.\nIn addition, a multinomial logistic regression analysis is\nused to examine the prevalence of ADL and IADL disability\nseparately. For the LSOA, this equation takes the form\nln(P(Y=j)/P(Y = J)) = pjo\n+ft,Age + pj2\nFemale\nwhere Y is the outcome variable, J is the number of catego-\nries in the outcome variable (3 for this study, i.e., ADL\ndisability, IADL disability, and nondisabled), and j takes\nvalues from 1 to J-1. The natural log of the odds of being in a\ncertain category relative to being in the reference category is\nestimated in the analysis. In this study, the natural log of the\nodds of having an ADL disability (P[Y =1]) relative to being\nnondisabled (P[Y = 3]), and the natural log of the odds of\nhaving an IADL disability but no ADL disability (P[Y = 2])\nrelative to being nondisabled (P[Y = 3]) are estimated simul-\ntaneously. Once the model is estimated, the predicted proba-\nbility of being in a particular outcome state can be easily\ncomputed (Roncek, 1991). Again, for the NHIS, there is one\ntime variable indicating the years since 1982.\nIncidence of Disability and Transitions to Nondisability\nFollowing the prevalence analysis using both datasets,\ntransitions of the following types are examined using the\nLSOA: from \"nondisability to disability,\" from \"disability\nto nondisability,\" and from the states of disability and\nnondisability to death. Discrete-time hazards models assum-\ning mid-interval transitions which include age, sex, and\ninterval as the independent variables are employed to test the\nsignificance of change over time in incidence of disability\nand death and the restoration of ability to function. The\nhazard models take the following form in this analysis:\nInn,\nme luiiuwnig lunn in iiiia anaiy\nikl\n(Age) = Ykl0\n+ Ykll\nAge + Ykl2\nFemale\nwhere hkl\nis the transition rate from state k (e.g., nondisabled\nor disabled) to state 1 (e.g., nondisabled, disabled, or\ndeath). The interval of time to which the data refer is entered\nomitted as the reference category.\nRESULTS\nPrevalence\nThe NHIS. -- The prevalence of personal care and routine\nneed disability for men and women in each year is presented\nin Table 1. Graphs of the prevalence of both types of\ndisability for men and women in each of four age groups at\nA visual examination of the figures and table gives us an\nindication of the consistency of these data and the fact that\nthere is no dramatic trend. Visual examination of the data\ndoes not indicate any clear time trend in the need for personal\ncare or the percentage reporting a need for help with other\nroutine activities. In general, the percentage needing help\nwith routine needs is somewhat lower in the later years,\nalthough the percentages needing help in 1993 are considera-\nbly higher than in 1992. The percentage needing help with\nages would be virtually identical.\nStatistical analysis, however, does indicate some signi-\nficant reductions in disability over time. In interpreting the\nresults, the large sample must be considered as well as\nstatistical significance. When age and sex are controlled,\nthere is a significantly lower relative likelihood of disability\nin later years when the two types of disability are combined\n(Table 2). When the two types of disability are separated,\nthere is a lower relative likelihood of each type of disability\nin later years.\nUsing the results of the multinomial equations in Table 2,\nthe probability of needing help with personal care, needing\nhelp with routine care, and of being nondisabled can be\nestimated for each sample member based on age, sex, and\nyear of observation. In order to estimate the decrease in the\nprevalence of disability that would have occurred if there\nwere no change in the composition of the sample but a linear\nBoth Sexes\nMales\nFemales\nBoth Sexes\nMales\nFemales\nBoth Sexes\nMales\nFemales\nPercent Nondisabled\"\nPercent With Routine Need Disability But No Personal Care Disability1\"\nPercent With Personal Care Disability0\n\u00b7Nondisabled in either routine needs or personal care.\nThose with no personal care needs who have a health problem or impairment that results in a need for help from another person in handling routine needs,\nsuch as everyday household chores, doing necessary business, shopping, or getting around for other purposes.

While the decline in the relative\nlikelihood of personal care disability was statistically signi-\nficant, the predicted decline in the actual prevalence of this\ndisability was quite small.\nTheLSOA. --The sex-specific prevalences of nondisabil-\nity and IADL and ADL disability for the LSOA sample 76 +\nat each of the four dates are presented in Table 3.

Change in the components of\ndisability appears equally irregular. Age-specific curves of\nthe observed prevalence of IADL and ADL disability at the\nfour dates are shown in Figure 3. Again, visual analysis does\nnot indicate obvious consistent change over the period in the\nprevalence of disability in any age range.\nThe results of the logistic regression, however, indicate\nsignificantly different from that in 1984 (Table 4, left\ncolumn). The sign, however, is positive, indicating that\nonce age and sex are controlled the odds of being disabled\nrelative to nondisabled were significantly higher (by 20 and\n15%) at these two dates. There is no significant difference\nthe time of the interview.\nWhen the disabled are divided into two categories --\nthose with an ADL disability and those with only IADL\ndisability -- the results indicate that the increased likelihood\nof disability relative to nondisability described above for\ndisability. At each of the three dates after the first interview,\nthe likelihood of having an ADL disability relative to being\nnondisabled is significantly higher than in 1984. Using the\ncoefficients from Table 4 and the values of the independent\nvariables to predict the probability that any sample observa-\ntion is ADL disabled, the average probability of haying an\nADL disability for the 1984 sample would have increased\nThere are no significant differences between 1984 and the\nother years in the likelihood of IADL disability relative to\nbeing nondisabled. Clearly, the analysis of time differences\nis sensitive to the year used as the basis of comparison. If\n1990 IADL disability relative to nondisability is signifi-\ncantly lower.\nAs mentioned earlier, our results are somewhat sensitive\nto the imputation of missing data on disability status. This is\nnot surprising given that the primary reason for worrying\nabout sample attrition in this analysis is that unhealthy\npeople are lost to the sample more frequently than healthy\npeople; thus, attrition produces a healthier sample over time.\nIf we had not imputed disability status for missing cases, we\nin all disability; nor an increase in ADL disability between\nGO\np\nb\no o\n3 '-- P KJ ?\n\u00b7* en ro en c\nO\nm\nCD\n^j\nVO\n\u00b7X-\noo\no\ns\nt o\nCO\nI\nO\nMALES\nYEAR\nFEMALES\nYEAR\nTable 2.

This can be\ninterpreted to mean that the rate of becoming disabled as\nwell as the rate of overcoming disability changed in the\ndirection of improving functioning among the older popula-\ntion. The death rate from either state does not change\nsignificantly over time. This is not surprising given the lack\nof consistent change in national mortality rates among the\nvery old in the 1980s reported by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics (1991), and similar findings in the NLTCS\nThe meaning of the significant differences in the likeli-\nhood of disability change can perhaps be best grasped from\nage-specific disability transition schedules derived from the\nhazard models for the two significantly different periods\ntransition rates from \"nondisabled to disabled\" and from\n\"disabled back to nondisabled\" are shown in Figure 4.

However, the time pattern of differences in death\nrates is affected by imputation. If we did not impute, we\nwould observe higher death rates for the disabled in the\nDISCUSSION\nWhat evidence is there for a change in the prevalence of\ndisability during recent years?

In the NHIS, we could also find\nsomewhat different results by varying the base year. The\nrelationship of the significance of change to the base year\npoints out the importance of having multiple points of\nobservation over which to examine change. A more regular\ntime change in any of the datasets would provide stronger\nevidence of a trend.\nIs there evidence of changing incidence of disability and\nrestoration of functioning during the 1980s? Both the LSOA\nand the NLTCS datasets indicate significant declines in the\nlevel of onset of disability. We find evidence of significant\nThe size of the reported reduction appears to be of the same\norder of magnitude in the two datasets. In the NLTCS data\nthere was a 31 percent reduction in the two-year transition\nprobability from nondisabled to disabled for 75- to 84-year-\nolds (Manton, Corder, and Stallard, 1993, calculated from\nTable 3). In the LSOA we observe a reduction of 16 percent\nin the estimated one-year transition rate of the same type.\nNondisability to Disability\nDisability to Nondisability\nThe results from the LSOA provide stronger evidence of\nfavorable change in disability transitions over the 1980s.\nThere was an increased likelihood of recovering from dis-\ndecrease in this likelihood in the NLTCS. Precise compari-\nsons of the size of the change in the likelihood of going from\ndisabled to nondisabled cannot be made for the two datasets,\nbut both appear to be proportionately quite large.\nThe lack of immediate translation of incidence changes\ninto prevalence differences, as observed in the LSOA, is not\nunexpected (Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994). If the\nin the LSOA were sustained for some years, the prevalence\nof disability should decrease as well. The similarity of the\nrecent incident changes from \"nondisabled to disabled\"\nfrom the two surveys with incident information provides the\nfirst replicated evidence that we are potentially at the begin-\nning of a period of improvement in disability among the old.\nEvidence of sustained change beyond 1990 is needed before\nwe can confidently say that improvement has begun.\nDifferences in the findings across datasets collected to\nmonitor changes in disability in old age in the 1980s indicate\na need for further evidence before drawing conclusions\nabout clear trends toward improving health among the older\npopulation. The differences in results from the three studies\ncould reflect numerous design differences in the NHIS, the\nNLTCS, and the LSOA. We will not discuss these differ-\nences in detail because this has been done extensively by\npotential sources of varying results'include: coverage of the\ninstitutional and nondisabled populations, reinterview ver-\nsus new sample, sample size, age coverage, sampling com-\nplexity, survey interval, mode of interview on some waves,\nthe use of a sample screen, the frequency of proxy response,\nand the format and content of the questions used to define the\ndisabled.\nSome differences do not affect our comparisons because\nwe limit the comparisons to samples with similar character-\nistics (e.g., coverage of institutional population) or if we did\nlimit the analysis to comparative groups the results would\nnot change (e.g., age restricted to the 75 plus). Other\ndifferences could cause variable results. For instance, differ-\nent definitions of ADL and IADL disability could be a cause\nof differences in findings between the two surveys.\nThe most dramatic difference across surveys is in the\nfindings about trends in ADL disability prevalence. This\nmay also be the place where the difference in definition is\ngreatest. Both the NHIS and the NLTCS use \"needing\" or\n\"getting personal assistance\" in performing tasks as central\nto the definition of ADL disability. In the LSOA, if we were\nto include those among the \"ADL-disabled\" who receive\nassistance but report themselves physically able to perform\nfunctions, the prevalence of ADL disability would increase\nWhile the receipt of assistance is commonly used as an\nindicator of old age disability, we think that this is not a good\npractice. One of the major problems with these definitions is\nthat the receipt of assistance is highly related to living\narrangements. Those who live with others are more likely to\nget assistance. If we employed the use-of-assistance defini-\ntion with the LSOA sample, among those who live with\nothers, the increase in ADL disability would be 101 percent;\namong those who live alone, the increase would be only 27\npercent. We think that disability is better measured by\nfunctioning deficits due to health than by the use of assis-\ntance in the older population.\nAny explanation of the finding from the NHIS and the\nNLTCS of a decrease in IADL disability and not ADL\ndisability needs to be evaluated in light of what might affect\nIADL ability but not ADL ability. Verbrugge and Jette\n(1994) have cogently clarified the role that health and envi-\nronment potentially play in various types of disabilities.\nIADL disability which arises from difficulty doing house-\nwork, meal preparation, shopping, other household chores,\nand getting around outside the house can be affected by the\nability to drive, the provision of transportation services, the\navailability of prepared foods and microwave ovens, as well\nas other factors that are not related to the intrinsic health\nstatus of a population. ADL ability represents more basic\nability and is less likely to be affected by factors extrinsic to\nthe individual.\nWhile we have examined changes in the age-specific\nprevalence of disability, we have not discussed the burden of\ndisability on those who are preparing for the aging of the\npopulation in the next century. The dramatic increase in the\nnumbers of older persons results in a predicted increase in\nthe burden of disability in the population even when the most\noptimistic projections of current findings are employed.\nHowever, reducing the incidence of disability or raising the\nage at which people become disabled is the most effective\nmechanism for reducing the future numbers of disabled in\nthe population (Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994).\nBecause of this, public policies should be directed toward\nthe prevention and delay of onset of disabling diseases and\nconditions and in the provision of technology and services to\ncompensate for disability.\n"
