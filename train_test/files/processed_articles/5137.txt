Healthcare\nsystems in Western market-states under permanent financial pressures are sure to\nseize on any justificatory potential such differentiations might offer and refuse to\npay for what patients may `responsibly' take care of themselves \u00ad or may have\nprevented altogether.\nIn this article I look at how Luther, and to an extent Calvin and Melanchthon,\ndistribute the responsibility for disease through their soteriological anthropologies,\nbiblical hermeneutics and integration of other traditions. Medicine and theology are\nconnected in two ways here, but these need to be disentangled first. First, medical\nlanguage illuminates the nature of salvation. In that regard, the Reformers' theologia\nmedicinalis follows a long tradition. Second, this (medico-)theology determines the\nrelationship between sin, responsibility/forgiveness and the medicina corporalis.\nParticularly Luther, as we will see, engenders a distinction between medicine and\nthe moral\u00adpastoral task of the theologian. Calvin and Melanchthon then take the\nReformation in distinct different directions. Whereas Calvin adopts a social trans-\nformism that is more forward-looking, Melanchthon merges humanist medicine with\nthe exercises of faith and so moralizes medicine.\nLuther\nLuther's apocalyptic mindset, his existential All-or-Nothing between `God and the\ndevil',1 was not just one of the Anfechtungen (trials, contestations) terrorizing him\nas a young monk. It was quite in line with the late medieval spirit of the age. Before\nthis overall horizon Luther asked, `How can God be for me: by revelation or\nthrough a legal, even monastic regime of penitence, observance, and discipline?'\nHis watershed moment was of course the insight that human beings are freed from\nsin not by their own doing, but saved by God's grace alone. Precisely this existen-\ntial relief categorically breaks apart a clearly visible nexus of disease and sin, and\nhence medical healing and moral penitence.\nChristological readings of the Psalms\nThis development can be traced early in Luther's works, such as his first lectures on\nthe Psalms (Dictata super Psalterium, 1513\u00ad18), which are above all hermeneuti-\ncally significant.2 With a view to the Psalms as prayers, Luther emphasizes in the\npreface: `To sing with the spirit is to sing with spiritual devotion and emotion.\nThis is said in opposition to those who sing only with the flesh.'3 He then turns, for\nexample, to Psalm 38: `There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;\nneither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. / For mine iniquities are\ngone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me. / My wounds\nhave putrefied and festered because of my foolishness.' This is responsibilization at\nits extreme: disease is not only a divine punishment, it results in hostile social\nexclusion.4 But Luther glosses: `Since . . . Christ . . . bore himself our sins, this\npsalm speaks in the person of Christ. In it he recalls and confesses our sins for\nus before God the Father and asks for His release from them (that is, our release\nthrough Him and in Him). Therefore, whoever wants to pray this psalm profitably\nshould pray it not in his own person but in Christ's and, as it were, should hear Him\npray it and thus add his own wishes and say ``Amen''.'5 Similarly, Psalm 32.3\u00ad4:\n`When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. / For\nday and night your hand was heavy on me; my strength was sapped as in the heat\nof summer.' Luther emphasizes the spiritual sense: `The bones, which are the firm-\nness of faith and hope, are reduced in their capacity to trust in God by the fact that\nhe puts off confessing.'6\nThe Dictata's (not always consistent) christological reading of disease already\nemphasizes a loss of faith. Physical disease is primarily a parable of sin, even\nthough the two may or may not go hand in hand. Importantly, the speaker is\nstanding before God (coram Dei) in the presence of God.7\nLectures on Romans and after\nIn the Lectures on the Romans (1515/16) Luther drew on the theologia medicinalis\ntradition to explain what is effectively his central theological insight. For a start,\noriginal sin afflicts the human `. . . like a sick man whose mortal illness is not only\nthe loss of health in all his members'. It also includes `the weakness of all of his\nsense and power, culminating even in his disdain for those things which are health-\nful and in his desire for those things which make him sick'.8 It is therefore a\nmistake, Luther thinks, that the patient can somehow heal himself,9 a self-salvation\nimplied in present-day calls for `self-compassion'.10 In the face of a corrupt conditio\nhumana, one can only admit the futility of one's efforts and cry out for help in\nhumility.11 All one can `do' is passively listen, wait and hope for grace.\nIn Luther's medical-theological locus classicus, then, Christ for the sinner is\nanalogous to the doctor for the patient.12 The doctor has promised a sure recovery;\nhoping for it, the patient follows his prescriptions (the law), abstaining from harm-\nful things until the doctor can fulfil the promise. Luther asks: `Now is this sick man\nwell? The fact is that he is both sick and well at the same time. He is sick in fact, but\nhe is well because of the sure promise of the doctor, whom he trusts and who has\nreckoned him as already cured, because he is sure that he will cure him; for he has\nalready begun to cure him and no longer reckons to him a sickness unto death.'\nThe same goes for `Christ, our Samaritan', who begins to heal the half-dead man,\npromising the cure of eternal life. The man is not righteous, healed or justified, but\nsimul iustus et peccator, `a sinner in fact, but a righteous man by the sure imputa-\ntion and promise of God'.13 As Johann Anselm Steiger notes, `. . . medical practice\nand pharmacy emerge as spaces of experience into which something shines, or\nthrough which the divine method of healing can be somewhat perceived, eschato-\nlogically geared towards bringing about ultimate and complete healing and making\nthe medical art superfluous.'14\nThese themes are further developed in the Heidelberg Disputation (1518) and\nthe Freedom of a Christian (1520), where Luther clarifies the soteriological and\nhence epistemic \u00ad though not ontological \u00ad distinction between a person's inner\nfreedom and their external actions.15 Theologically, the living, `ensouled' person is\nsubject to a double analysis, `complementarily relating two perspectives that cannot\nmutually represent each other'.16 Ko\n\u00a8 rtner particularly underlines that `personhood,\nor rather being a human being. . . transcends every possibility of biological descrip-\ntion. It has the character of a secret. And precisely in this secretness Christian faith\ndiscerns the image of God's hiddenness.'17 This implies a significant imbalance of\ntransparency: on the one hand, absolute transparency and freedom before God and\nin Christ, reflected in the singing of the Psalms. On the other hand, coram mundi,\nthe possible transparency of acts is incomplete; knowledge fizzles out, disappears\nand is lost. In Luther's view, with God's grace given gratuitously, the social struc-\ntures of transgression, subsequent disciplining and ritual penitence are irreversibly\neroded.\nDisease and medicine\nPrecisely the distinctions between gospel and law, faith and work cohere with a\ndifferentiation between theologian and doctor. Disease is an `epiphenomenon' of\nthe human being suffering in their essence, his `original sin'.18 It sits within the\noverall critical, apocalyptic Either\u00adOr: `The sick person is a battlefield on which\nGod and the devil meet, he is the object of the dispute between them, and both\npowers vie for the rule over him.'19 Where not a divine trial of faith, as for Job, it\ncan be an instrumentum diaboli; either way, without free will, the human being has\nhis hands tied behind his back. However, in a later `table talk', Luther does insist\nall diseases such as blindness or gout are actually the result of sinful actions \u00ad if\nthey weren't, all children would be born blind or with gout.20\nDue to the simul iustus et peccator, Luther never systematically distinguishes\nbetween self-inflicted and randomly occurring diseases, i.e. between punishment\nand a trial of faith.21 Indeed, he regards the very search for the origins of evil\nand disease as a diabolic trial.22 What matters is the true healing achieved by the\nword of Christ, the `true doctor'. The spiritual pharmaka are the preached word,\njustification by faith, the Eucharist administered for the sick, words of consolation.\nAnd because the ensouled Word is music, Luther accorded `to music the first place\nafter theology',23 a `medicine against evil' and `nourishment to the soul'.\nThe visitation of the sick is then a separate pastoral duty. And in this context,\nLuther would `[ask] whether [the patient] wanted to bear his disease patiently, as\nGod had sent it to him out of His gracious fatherly will, and that he had deserved\nthis infliction with his sins'.24 With remarkable sensitivity he also recognized that a\nsuffering, sad heart leads to physical suffering. He regarded phenomena such as low\nmood (tristitia), identity disorders (tentationes) and depressions (maerores) as vere\nmorbi at a time when his contemporaries were still seeking to address them by\nmeans of astrology or rituals.\nWhen it came to his own ailments, Luther was notoriously sceptical of doctors,\nnot least retaining a monastic suspicion of the body, calling his own a `stinking sack\nof maggots'.25 Yet the primacy of the divine word, spoken and sung, neither\ngrounded an anti-medicalism, nor did it result in an amalgamation of medicine\nand theology. Luther particularly rejected, even scolded, the spiritualist Karlstadt\nfor his suggestion that, at the outbreak of the plague, those afflicted should be left\n`in the hands of God'. For Luther, this was `not to trust in God, but to tempt God,\nfor God has created medicine and reason, responsible to care for the body, so that\nit may be healthy and live'.26\nAs to the second possibility, Luther emphasized a clear division of labour: `A\ndoctor is our Lord God's kludger [unsers Herrn Gotts Flicker], [he] helps physically;\nwe theologians help spiritually, so that we make good what the devil has marred.\nThe devil gives poison to kill the human being; a doctor gives theriac or other\nmedicine, so as to help the creature.'27 Medicine is hardly a divine act of grace.\nRather, the medicina corporalis is rooted in God's providential care (creatio con-\ntinuata). It is a `creature, which comes not out of books, but God has revealed it,\nor, as Sirach says in Ch. 38: ``it comes from the Most High, and the Lord has\nbrought it forth from the ground''.' Medicine is on a par with law, `which flows out\nof nature and is created from it'.28 So the doctor preserves that which is always\nalready there, the human being as a given physical, bodily subject, a beseelter Leib,\nan ensouled body. Hence, medical healing is neither conditional nor consequent\nupon patients' existential healing.29 Theology and medicine apply to the distinct\n`perspectives' of the human being. Institutionally, this was solidified early on. In\n1520, keen to reform the university faculties, Luther left it to the doctors to reform\nCalvin and Melanchthon\nUnlike the partly medieval, transitional figure Luther, the second-generation\nReformer Jean Calvin saw himself as standing at the beginning of a new era,\npaving the way for a more rationalist approach to medicine. First, in his commen-\ntary on Romans (1540), Calvin drew much less of a sharp distinction between law\nand gospel.31 This conditioned a socially transformative understanding of faith\nreflected in Calvin's Geneva. In the Genevan Academy, founded in 1559, medical\nwork was an intrinsic part of `orienting oneself to the biblical social model'.\nThe potentially moralizing, even politicizing tendencies inherent in this view are\noffset by Calvin's notion of predestination: `. . . all things come to pass by the\ndispensation of God, and . . . nothing happens fortuitously'. The Christian `will\nhave no doubt that a special providence is awake for his preservation, and will\nnot suffer anything to happen that will not turn to his good and safety'.32 Disease\nitself is a medicine that `frees us from all passions of the world and etches away\nwhatever is superfluous. They are, moreover, messages of death and are to teach us\nto free our feet so that we are free to go out when God likes us to.'33 No longer a\ntemptation or instrument of the devil, disease has a cathartic, albeit forward-\nlooking, function. So while pushing Luther's de-magification of medicine further,\nCalvin encourages active transformation. But, contingent on that, his dogmatic\ndevelopment of predestination effectively ends the speculative enquiry into the\norigins of disease.\nEarly on, Luther's colleague Philip Melanchthon moved in yet another direc-\ntion, integrating Reformation and Renaissance. In his system, the newly edited\nworks of Galen, Hippocrates and Vesalius, but also astrology, became part of\nthe revealed knowledge of creation. In De arte medica Melanchthon equates the\nspiritus sanctus with the physical `spirits' animating the body. Made of clay, the\nbody was a `holy temple'; the spiritus animales and vitales were to be sanctified by\nthe spiritus sanctus. Paul's injunction to honour the body became a medical duty,\nexemplified by Melanchthon's dietetics, moral\u00admedical injunctions on behaviour,\nhygiene, dieting and sexual abstinence. If they are followed, `the knowledge of God\nbecomes clearer, agreement becomes stronger, and the movements toward God\nbecome more ardent'.34 Conversely, disease was caused by sin, preventing the pres-\nence of God in the body. As a result, in Melanchthon there is `a moralizing ten-\ndency, leading to a signficant strenghthening of the doctor before the patient,\nbecause the latter in principle had to present to the doctor with a bad conscience,\nas their disease hinted at sins they had committed'.35\nConclusion\nThe relationship between sin and disease in Reformation theology is far from\nunified, and the different strands of thought remain present options. Several dog-\nmatic questions come to the fore. First, the nature of freedom and hence soterio-\nlogical anthropology: in particular Luther's spiritual hermeneutics suggests that\nabsolute transparency is only available coram Deo. Presuming an attributability\nof causes for a disease would both profane the relationship the Psalmist seeks and\nparody an answer. Second, Luther's distinction between law and gospel, between\nword and creatio continuata, sustains a practical distinction between the medical\nand theological professions. In a pastoral context, however, Luther invites the\npatient to confessional reflections quite different from contemporary primacy of\npatients' `choice'. Similarly, Calvin's view implies that we don't know exhaustively\nwhy someone is sick: our knowledge fizzles out. Before the backdrop of divine\npredestination, patient and doctor are encouraged to be hopeful \u00ad either in accept-\nance of suffering as a task, or in remedying the effects of disease. Quite different,\nthen, is Melanchthon's systematic continuity of creation, natural sciences and\nmoral precepts. Perhaps ironically, this humanist heritage, in a secularized and\nupdated version, is most prominent in present-day tendencies towards responsibi-\nlization and discrimination on the grounds of particular diseases.\nFunding details\nThis work was supported by the University of Oxford Wellcome Trust ISSF\nThe author gratefully acknowledges this funding.\nNotes\n1.
