Guneri\net al.32 and Okumura et al.33 also confirmed the previ-\nous studies; however, Mart\u00ednez-R\u00edos et al.35 did not\nfind any association between ACE gene insertion/dele-\ntion (I/D) polymorphisms and coronary restenosis risk.\nTherefore, we collected all published case-control\nstudies related to the ACE I/D polymorphisms and cor-\nonary restenosis risk to perform a meta-analysis, to fur-\nther explore the relationship between ACE gene\npolymorphisms and coronary restenosis.\nMaterials and methods\nLiterature collection and screening\nWe identified all the articles that reported the association\nof ACE polymorphisms and coronary restenosis risk. We\nconducted a computerized literature search of PubMed,\nEMBase, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the\nChinese CNKI, and the Wanfang database; using the terms\n`coronary restenosis'and `angiotensin-converting enzyme'\nor `ACE', and `polymorphism' or single nucleotide poly-\nmorphism (`SNP'), or `genotype', or `insertion/deletion'\nor `I/D', or `D/I', `D/D' or `I/I'; without any restriction on\nlanguage or publication year. We expected that the included\nstudies must meet to the following criteria:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Case-control or cohort studies on the relation\nbetween ACE polymorphism and coronary\nrestenosis;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Similar themes and methods; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Sufficient data upon genotype and alleles counts.\nLiterature were excluded if relevant data were not availa-\nble or there was heterogeneity of gene polymorphisms in\nthe control population.\nQuality assessment and data extraction\nTwo reviewers (H-W Miao and H Gong) used a standard\napproach, according to the above-mentioned inclusion cri-\nteria, independently evaluating the studies and extracting\nthe data (Table 1). Discrepancies were resolved through\ndiscussion. The methodological quality of the included\nstudies was assessed by using the Cochrane Handbook\n5.236 quality evaluation criteria. We extracted the following\ninformation for each study: The first author's last name,\nyear of publication, ethnicity of the study participants,\nnumbers of cases and controls, and frequency of insertion\nor deletion genotypes. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was\nassessed, using the 2 test.\nFigure 1. Flow diagram of study identification.\nRAS: renin-angiotensin system.\n846 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nStatistical analysis\nWe used RevMan 5.2 software, provided by the Cochrane\nCollaboration, to perform the meta-analysis. We used\nQ-test and I2 test to examine the heterogeneity between\neach study. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI were uti-\nlized for efficacy analysis statistics. We selected either the\nfixed or random-effects model, to merge the OR according\nto the I2 value. Sensitivity analyses and publication bias\ntests were performed according to previous literature. We\nconsidered a P < 0.05 as a significant difference.\nResults\nStudy identification\nAs shown in Figure 1, we preliminarily detected 144 arti-\ncles in the literature: 104 were excluded, because of only\ngene expression analysis not relevant to coronary resteno-\nsis, and no ACE genotype data; and 24 studies were further\nexcluded because of being only a review paper, no control\ngroup, and/or being duplicate publications. Therefore, a\ntotal of 16 journal literature articles,20\u00ad35 with a total of\n3452 subjects without coronary restenosis), were included\nin this research.\nQuantitative synthesis\nAs shown in Figure 2, the heterogeneity test of the vari-\nous studies revealed there were heterogeneous results\neffects model in our analysis.

We found a significant association of\nACE gene polymorphisms with coronary restenosis.\nRestenosis after PCI is an important clinical problem.\nThe formation of restenosis may result from the following\nmechanisms:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A response to injury of the vessel wall;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A platelet aggregation;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A thrombus formation;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A liberation of growth factors;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Cellular hyperplasia involving predominantly\nsmooth muscle proliferation and migration; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Intercellular matrix formation.\nSo far, the etiological basis of restenosis is only partly\nunderstood. The genetic polymorphisms in the ACE gene\nare considered to be associated with coronary restenosis.\nACE is a core factor for the production of angiotensin II;\nand the degradation of bradykinin37 and angiotensin II\nplays a pivotal role in the restenosis process.38 Previous\nstudies indicate that high ACE levels may increase the\nrisk of coronary thrombosis.39 And ACE gene I/D poly-\nmorphisms have consistently been found associated with\ndifferential plasma ACE levels.40 Furthermore, serum\nplasma activity of ACE is thought to play a major role in\nthe development of restenosis after coronary stent implan-\ntation.41,42 Recently, a number of articles in the literature\nreported on the relationship between ACE I/D polymor-\nphisms and coronary restenosis risk20\u00ad35; however, the\nresults are inconsistent or even contradictory. This dis-\ncrepancy may result from the small sample size, ethnic\ndifference, false positive results, and/or study design in\neach study.\nIn the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to\nreveal the association of ACE I/D polymorphisms with\ncoronary restenosis. Our results showed thatACE gene I/D\npolymorphisms were associated with the susceptibility of\ncoronary restenosis, with the D allele carriers having a\n1.92-fold increase in risk for restenosis, compared to the I\nallele carriers; however, there is still a need for further\nresearch and screening of the etiological relationships\nbetween the functional polymorphism loci of the ACE\ngene and the susceptibility to coronary restenosis.\nThere are still several limitations, when interpreting\nthese results. On the one hand, all the subjects involved in\nour study are of different ethnicity. On the other hand, the\nheterogeneity found between each study may result from\nthe different research methods.\nIn conclusion, the present study suggested that there is\nan association between the ACE gene I/D polymorphisms\nand coronary restenosis.\nConflict of interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\nFunding statement\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
