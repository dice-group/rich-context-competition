    "abstract": "Abstract\nConcepts, theories, and findings of race and racial identity development were reviewed and conceptualized into a single\nmodel based on principles of complexity and chaos. This article proposes race can be understood as a complex adaptive\nsystem and conceptualized as an attractor landscape. In this model, trajectories represent racial identity development or\nprogression through an attractor landscape comprised of racial categories. Although this works well as a conceptual model,\nthe modeling of racial identity development within an attractor landscape is affected by practical constraints related to data\ncollection and many of the same limitations of existing racial identity development theories. The proposed model also creates\nadditional challenges because of its interdisciplinary nature.\n",

Although this is a straightforward\ndefinition, it is more useful to identify the conditions of a\ncomplex system. Page (2011) identified three basic condi-\ntions for a system to be considered complex: diversity, inter-\naction, and interdependence. Each of these conditions applies\nto racial phenomena. Diversity refers to differences within\ntype, between types, or in reference to composition. Racial\ncategorization is an example of typing. However, racial cat-\negorization, such as social categorization in general, is\nflawed because it is based on perspective and history, plagued\nby transcategorical movement, and the act of categorization\nitself affects the categories (Gillespie, Howarth, & Cornish,\n2012). Race is also sometimes treated as a natural or master\ncategory, which gives it a supervenient quality or projects\nWagner, Holtz, & Kashima, 2009). Interaction indicates enti-\nties or agents interact within a specific space or network\n(e.g., geographic location or shared computer network).\nInterdependence means actions taken by one entity affects\nother entities. It is in this sense that a racial first by someone\nin a racial minority group can alter the perception of indi-\nviduals in that racial category; or a single act of discrimina-\ntion or defiance can set off a nationwide protest (Torre &\nas a complex adaptive system, adaptation must occur based\non individuals or types (Page, 2011). Race is adaptive as per-\nceptions of self and what it means to be in a racial category\nchange over time and space (Masuoka, 2011; Omi & Winant,\nComplex relationships and dynamics can be presented\nusing landscape models (Miller & Page, 2007). In particular,\nattractor landscapes have been used to model brain function,\ncultural complexity, adolescent development, and schizo-\nphrenia (Lichtwarck-Aschoff & van Geert, 2004; Morris,\nWhitacre, Ross, & Ulieru, 2011; van Beveren & de Haan,\nWithin an attractor landscape,\nattractors are often represented topographically as valleys on a\ndynamic landscape. The deeper and wider the attractor, the more\nlikely it is that behavior falls into and remains there, and the\nmore resistant it is to small changes in the environment. (Granic\nAttractors intrinsically \"capture the interplay between struc-\nture and dynamics in a complex system and thus are useful\nfor framing the tension between stability and change in psy-\nchological processes\" (Nowak, Vallacher, & Zochowski,\nAttractors come in different forms--each possessing dif-\nferent patterns of behavior (Guastello & Liebovitch, 2009;\nThelen & Smith, 2006). There are four types of attractors:\nfixed point (or point), limit-cycle (or cyclic or periodic or\noscillating), toroidal (or quasiperiodic), and chaotic (or\nFigure 2). As the name indicates, a trajectory is attracted to a\nfixed point in a fixed-point attractor. Nowak et al. (2005)\nframed fixed-point attractors as the psychological equivalent\nof \"equilibrium or homeostasis\" (p. 354). An individual may\nhave a repertoire of fixed patterns of behavior that may be\nwanted or unwanted, or even contradictory (Nowak et al.,\n2005). These patterns invariably become an individual's \"go-\nto\" patterns of thinking and behaving across situations. If an\nindividual progresses through patterns in regular intervals, this\nrepresents a limit-cycle attractor. In a limit-cycle (or cyclical\nor periodic or oscillating) attractor, a trajectory displays cycli-\ncal, oscillating, or orbit-like patterns (Guastello & Liebovitch,\n2009). The movement of a pendulum is an example of a limit-\ncycle. \"A toroidal attractor is the result of a limit-cycle that is\ncycling along two axes rather than one\" (Guastello &\nfrom its shape as torus or bagel when shown as a visual model\n(Nowak & Lewenstein, 1994). Psychologically, this represents\nirregular oscillation between different goals, states, or atti-\ntudes (Nowak & Lewenstein, 1994). Toroidal attractors can\ndevelop because of bifurcations, which are unstable patterns\nobserved before a system changes (Nowak & Lewenstein,\n1994). The significance of bifurcations is they can push a sys-\ntem into chaos when they develop in succession (Guastello &\nLiebovitch, 2009). These peculiar characteristics are why\ntoroidal attractors are sometimes mistaken for chaotic attrac-\ntors (Guastello & Liebovitch, 2009). The most familiar attrac-\ntor may be the chaotic or strange attractor (Mackenzie, 2005).\nA physics-based definition of a strange attractor is \"a stable,\nnonperiodic state or behavior exhibited by some dynamic sys-\ntems, especially turbulent ones, that can be represented as a\nFigure 1. A hypothetical attractor landscape with trajectories.\nnonrepeating pattern in the system's phase space\" (Strange\nAttractor, n.d.). A chaotic attractor describes attitudes or\nbehavior that are within limits but become unpredictable and\nirregular over time because of differences in initial conditions,\nerrors in measurement, and constant changes in the system\nTransformations known as phase transitions occur\nbecause of altered parameters within attractors and attractor\nOtt, 2002). These transitions, which are varyingly referred to\nas crises, catastrophes, or bifurcations based on particular\ndynamics, result in changes to the shape, size, location, or\ntype of an attractor (Hollenstein, 2007). Transitions can also\nlead to the creation, destruction, merging, or splitting of an\ntion, systems are especially sensitive to perturbation as the\ntrajectory may move to a different area within an attractor or\nto a different attractor (Granic & Hollenstein, 2003). After a\nperiod of crisis or transition, a system may display even\ndeeper level erratic behavior, known as intermittencies or\ntransients. During this time, trajectories switch between new\nand old regions before settling into the new region or a toroi-\ndal attractor may temporarily appear (Grebogi, Ott, & Yorke,\nThe author proposes racial identity development theories\ncan be reframed using the properties and dynamics of chaotic\nattractors. Although these theories are employed within\nsocial, developmental, and counseling psychology, this arti-\ncle primarily utilizes theories from counseling psychology\n(Ponterotto & Park-Taylor, 2007). Racial identity develop-\nment theories are valued in counseling psychology because\nthey acknowledge the influence of racism on identity devel-\nopment and serve as diagnostic tools during counseling (Sue\n& Sue, 2013). Their theoretical focus on stages/statuses as an\nindividual progresses through the complexities of racial\nidentification parallels the various states observed as trajec-\ntories move through attractors in a complex system. On a\nmacro level, racism acts as the ideological foundation of this\ncomplex system through the institutionalization of racial dif-\nference (Markus, 2008). This process of institutionalization,\nincluding the creation of racial attractors, occurs through\nseveral different mechanisms. Although Nowak et al. (2005)\nprimarily focused on interpersonal synchronization and self-\norganization as forces in shaping personality, they clarified\nthese forces\nare [not] the only means by which experience engraves attractors\nin people's cognitive-affective systems. Theory and research in\npersonality science have identified a host of other plausible\nmechanisms of personality development and maintenance,\nincluding direct reinforcement, social learning and modeling,\nlabeling and self-fulfilling prophecies, identification, and guilt\nEach of these mechanisms aligns with Markus's (2008) con-\nceptualization of race as a social and relational process; and\ncontributes to the persistence of racial differences even as\nactions or events occur that run counter to the system.\nIn applying the language of attractors to racial identity\ndevelopment, unique trajectories (i.e., racial identity) in the\nperceived attractor basins (i.e., racial categories) represent\nhow an individual traverses the various characteristics,\nbehaviors, attitudes, and preferences associated with a given\nracial category or categories in correspondence with situa-\ntional and identity variables. Transitions in the proposed\nmodel result from changes in self-perception, environmental\ncues, and/or the perceived constitution of at least one racial\ncategory (and possibly the entire system). These transitions\nthen cause instability and variability in an individual's per-\nceived fit and trajectory within a racial category (or catego-\nries). Consistent with this conceptualization, the autopoietic\nnature of complex systems, and the prescriptive nature of\nracial\u00adethnic self-schemas, identity is not something that we\nhold or have, but more accurately something we continually\nperceive, reify, and modify through our behaviors in coordi-\nnation with the environment (Luhmann, 1995; Markus &\nresponds with agent fitness as a theme of complex adaptive\nlabeled agent fitness as \"not the same as a performance rat-\ning, but something closer to a person-job fit\" (p. 407). Race\nis related to agent fitness as one's name, appearance, behav-\niors, thoughts, location, status, and skill set affect how an\nindividual identifies with, and is perceived to be a member\nof, a particular racial group (AhnAllen, Suyemoto, & Carter,\n2006; Ben-Zeev, Dennehy, Goodrich, Kolarik, & Geisler,\nFigure 2. Types of attractors typically found in nonlinear\nsystems: (A) fixed-point (or point) attractor, (B) limit-cycle\n(or cyclic or periodic or oscillating) attractor, (C) toroidal (or\nquasiperiodic) attractor, and (D) chaotic (or strange) attractor.\nAmerican Psychological Association.\n4 SAGE Open\nPenner & Saperstein, 2008; Rockquemore, Brunsma, &\n& Markstrom-Adams, 1990). (Fit and the idea of attraction\nare both similarly addressed in Chao & Moon's, 2005, cul-\ntural mosaic.) Spencer and Markstrom-Adams's (1990) view\nof ethnic identity also supports the concept of fitness, which\nthey described as having \"the potential of providing a con-\nceptual framework for interpreting the ongoing experience\nor `fit' between self and the environment\" (p. 292).\nReframing Existing Theories and\nConstructs of Race and Racial Identity\nDevelopment With an Attractor\nLandscape\nCross (1971) developed one of the earliest theories of racial\nidentity development to describe the developmental patterns\nof African Americans. Since the publication of Cross's the-\nory, similar stage- and status-based models were developed\nto describe the identity development of individuals in other\nracial groups and social categories--with the newer theories\nbeing more explicitly ecological and nonlinear (Hardiman &\nthese theories position them as qualitatively close to chaotic\nas imbalances of positive and negative feedback can push an\necological system into chaos (Berryman & Millstein, 1989).\nIn a complex system based on racism, feedback comes in the\nform of behaviors and attitudes that support or contradict\nracism, such as racial socialization and racial discrimination\nposed model also aligns with other theories that focus on the\ndynamic, historical, recurring, social, situated, and restrain-\ning aspects of racial identity (see Cross, 2012; Omi & Winant,\nWijeyesinghe, 2012). Most notably, the metaphysical essence\nand language of attractors is seemingly imbued within Omi\nand Winant's (2015) definition of racial formation as \"the\nsociohistorical process by which racial categories are cre-\nated, lived out, transformed, and destroyed\" (p. 109).\nRacial identity development theories exhibit patterns that\ncorrespond with the framing of development as a progres-\nsion of states within a complex system (Smith & Thelen,\nthese theories parallel dynamics displayed by attractors in\ncrisis or transition (van Geert, 2009). This includes the gen-\neral stage-related trends found in the racial identity develop-\nment theories cited in the preceding paragraph: preawareness\nor preattraction to a racial identity, attraction toward a major-\nity identity, attraction toward a minority identity, fluctuating\nperiods of attraction to majority and minority identities,\ndevelopment of a new identity, rejection (or destruction) of a\nracial identity, merging of racial identities, and a dynamic\npattern that switches between all of the above identities.\nSimilar to connections and comparisons that are noted with\nChao and Moon's (2005) cultural mosaic, these patterns and\ntrends account for statuses described in Phinney's (1989)\nstages of ethnic identity development; Sodowsky, Kwan, and\nPannu's (1995) four ethnic identity orientations; and Roccas\nand Brewer's (2002) models of multiple in-group representa-\ntion. (The proposed model shares commonalities with Chao\n& Moon's, 2005, cultural mosaic. Both have an explicit\nfocus and usage of concepts in complexity and chaos.\nHowever, the model proposed here utilizes a deeper theoreti-\ncal examination and application of attractor types and prop-\nerties, a more narrow focus on race, and increased integration\nwith theories, concepts, and research on racial identity devel-\nopment. In addition, the cultural mosaic frames attractors as\ntiles, which relate to different aspects of identity.)\nAn understanding of the properties of chaotic attractors\nand complex adaptive systems also elucidates paradoxical\nviews on the cyclical and nonlinear nature of racial identity\ndevelopment. Racial identity development theories describe\nmoving into deeper or less explored facets of racial categories\nover the course of an individual's lifetime (Cross & Fhagen-\noscillating between categories and moving more deeply into\nthem over time is reminiscent of the Lorenz attractor with its\nlemniscate shape and entrancing pattern between two basins\nof attraction (Lorenz, 1963; see Figure 2D). Wing and Rifkin\n(2001) intuitively perceived and captured this dynamic in\nattractor-like detail in their discussion of Hardiman and\nJackson's (1997) social identity development theory. They\nproposed the theory can be viewed as\na series of different lenses through which people may view the\nworld. A person may tend to use a lens reflecting a particular\nstage and after a time may use the next lens in the developmental\nsequence most frequently. And while people may move from\none stage to another in what appears to be a linear fashion, as\nthey experience further oppression or develop a deeper\nunderstanding of oppression and/or identity, they may instead\nmove more deeply into what would appear to be an \"earlier\"\nstage. In effect, we can see this model as a spiral of movement,\nlike the peeling of an onion, rather than a solely linear process.\nAn example of this might occur when a person moves more\ndeeply into an \"earlier\" stage after experiencing identity-related\nA similar property is found in complex adaptive systems.\nDooley (1997) identified irreversibility as one of the key\nprinciples of complex adaptive systems. As described by\nGuastello (2009), even if previous states or conditions are\nreestablished, \"the effect is not the same because of the\nhistory that accumulated, events that occurred, and time that\nhas elapsed\" (p. 406). In combination, these properties inval-\nidate theoretical perspectives that support the absolute (re)\ncycling of attitudes or linear progression of racial identity\ndevelopment. These properties are also why normal racial\nidentity development should be described as chaotic. A racial\nidentity that progresses like a fixed, limit-cycle, or toroidal\nattractor could be considered pathological, indicative of\nidentity stagnation, or evidence of deeply entrenched and\nWachtel, 2014). Individuals should display some degree of\nidentity complexity and variability over time and in different\nsituations. (Reluctance to frame development as chaotic is in\npart because of the conflation of the colloquial understand-\ning of chaos with the scientific meaning of the term. Carver\nand Scheier, 1999, stated, \"using words such as turbulence,\nstatic, or chaos . . . is in a way very misleading. These peri-\nods may not feel subjectively like turbulence at all because\ntheir occurrence is quite familiar. The chaos may feel instead\nlike `implicit decision making,'\" p. 71, italics and quotations\nin original). Framing racial identity development within cha-\notic attractors also accounts for Cross's (2012) belief that\n\"what changes, from situation to situation, is not identity but\nthe manner in which identity is expressed\" (p. 194; see also\nHelms, 1996). Accordingly, a core racial identity would pro-\nvide some predictability and stability, whereas the expres-\nsion of the identity may be somewhat unpredictable based on\nincomplete information, interaction effects, and situational\nvariables.\nReinforcement, perturbation, stabilization, and reconfigu-\nration of racial identity (i.e., trajectories) and racial catego-\nries (i.e., attractors) are rooted in exposure to different types\nof racially associated phenomena or events. Among these\nphenomena are racial socialization, racial discrimination,\nracial firsts (or something that is considered atypical for\nsomeone in a particular racial group), racial realizations, and\nracially tinged environments, or anything that is perceived as\na threat to one's racial identity (Branscombe, Ellemers,\n& Rifkin, 2001). In addition, each of these phenomena inter-\nacts with the others and generates feedback loops resulting in\nnonlinear, correlational, or moderating effects. For example,\nthere are different outcomes based on the types of racial\nsocialization messages that are received and the identity of\nthe individual when racial discrimination is experienced.\nVariance in these factors contributed to differences in the\nperception and effects of racial discrimination, identity out-\ncomes, and the psychological tools an individual has to cope\nwith racial discrimination (Branscombe, Schmitt, & Harvey,\nis also apparent via reactions to behaviors that introduce nov-\nelty into the system, such as counterstereotypical or\nunexpected behavior (Holland, 1995). Individuals may\nbecome uncomfortable attempting or even observing actions\nor behaviors that are not typically associated with individu-\nals of a given racial background. Reactions to these \"inap-\npropriate\" actions included racial discrimination, threat\nresponses, and stereotypical behaviors (Mendes, Blascovich,\nfurther complicate the understanding of the interrelatedness\nof race-related phenomena, it should be noted that the dis-\ntinction between stabilization and perturbation may be\nimprecise. Although racial discrimination experiences would\ntypically be thought of as incidents that only perturb identity\ntoward a different state, both microaggressions and some\nracial socialization messages could be viewed as \"tiny per-\nturbations . . . to stabilize regular dynamics behaviours and to\ndirect chaotic trajectories rapidly to a desired state\" (Shinbrot,\nintention of both phenomena (at least from the perspective of\nthe agent or system) may be to reinforce a racial status quo or\nStabilization and moderation of racial identity also occurs\nthrough coping or buffering strategies to counter the effects\nof perspective-shifting stimuli or to (re-)establish a sense of\norder among racial categories (e.g., Blanz, Mummendey,\nMielke, & Klink, 1998; Brondolo, Brady, Pencille, Beatty, &\nOther dynamics and trends are also supported. In most\nracial identity development theories, an individual displays\nan initial preference toward the dominant racial category\nregardless of race (after the development of some awareness\nand understanding of race). However, an initial preference\ncould be focused on a nondominant racial category depend-\ning on the degree of exposure to the dominant racial category\nand an individual's immediate environmental racial influ-\nences. Either situation is consistent with Granic and\nHollenstein's (2003) claim that \"contextual constraints prob-\nabilistically guide behavior toward the dominant attractor at\nany given moment in time\" (p. 645). A single attractor may\nseparate in multiple attractors. For example, there are differ-\ning views and mental representations of the terms Black and\nAfrican American (Hall, Phillips, & Townsend, 2015;\ncovery of latent attractors (e.g., discovery of racial categories\nor options that were not noticed by an individual) is an alter-\nnate explanation for new categories (Vallacher & Nowak,\n2009). In many cases, so-called \"new\" attractors or catego-\nries are not newly created but simply newly discovered. For\nexample, a biracial identity may not have been perceived as\nan option in an individual's home neighborhood, but becomes\na new option when exposed to other individuals in a college\nsetting who identify as biracial (Renn, 2000). Changing from\nbeing drawn to a category to being repelled by it (i.e., effec-\ntively changing from an attractor to a repeller) is supported\nin theory and research, and applies to race (Cross & Fhagen-\n6 SAGE Open\nWay, Hern\u00e1ndez, Rogers, and Hughes (2013) found minority\nadolescents used racial stereotypes as both guides for behav-\niors to follow and avoid. An attractor-based model also sup-\nports multistabilities and multiple simultaneous crises\n(Nowak et al., 2005). Individuals can display concurrent\nattraction to multiple racial categories or experience multiple\nSanchez, Shih, & Garcia, 2009). This multiplicity extends to\nfeedback. Because of simultaneous attraction and crisis, con-\nflicting positions within identities, and competing situational\ncues, there is bipolar feedback. Sabelli (2005) referred to\nbipolar feedback as coexisting negative and positive feed-\nback, which results in \"synergistic and antagonistic interac-\ntion\" (p. vi). The combination of multiplicities forms a\ntheoretical foundation for the psychological equivalent of\nintermittencies and transients, as an individual who is the\nvictim of racial discrimination and/or develops race-related\ncognitive dissonance may experience psychological distress\nor a crisis of racial identity (Lee & Ahn, 2013; Rowe,\nfortable state then contributes to increased sensitivity to\nbipolar feedback and, ultimately, deeper level erratic think-\nmultiplicities, along with uncertainties about the strength,\nrelationships, and directionalities of these racially associated\nvariables, are why the author believes the proposed model\ncan alternatively be described as an interaction-dominant\ndynamical system (IDDS). In an IDDS, \"mutual and recipro-\ncal interactions . . . constitute a complex system of multidi-\nrectional constraint that operates at both fast and slow\ntimescales to dynamically order and reorder behavior during\nthe ongoing realization of behavioral goals\" (Eiler, Kallen,\nDiscussion\nAs an exercise in interdisciplinary research, the proposed\nmodel is an attempt to provide consilience to disparate theo-\nries and concepts of race and racial identity development,\nand to connect these theories to deeper level and more uni-\nversal scientific principles. Although interdisciplinary\nresearch can be valuable, the author acknowledges this type\nof research poses a unique set of challenges including the\npossibility of theoretical misunderstandings, problematic\nsyntheses, insignificant gains, and the need for shifts in\nthinking (Pedersen, 2016). In addition, there are conflicting\npositions on the metaphorical, analogical, and practical\nusage of complexity, chaos, and attractors (Ayers, 1997;\nVallacher & Nowak, 2007). Notwithstanding, the author\nbelieves this conceptualization of a unified understanding of\nrace and racial identity development is in agreement with\nVan Orden, Kello, and Holden's (2010) sentiment shared in\nthe first epigraph.\nRacial identification is only part of an individual's identity\nand experiences, so it can be said that the proposed conceptual-\nization is too simplistic. In addition, as identity is continuous\nand dynamic, an identity status (or stage) is a simplified\ndescription of an attractor state at a discrete moment (Brittian,\nstands there is an incomprehensibly high level of complexity to\nthe human and social experience. The author also understands\nthere are many places where language, ethnicity, and national-\nity are the primary means of categorizing people instead of race\ntions relate to racial identity, race becomes a more important\npart of one's identity, which justifies the existence of this and\nother theories that focus primarily on race (Benjamin, Choi, &\nIn addition to the disagreements on the relative impor-\ntance of race, there are competing definitions and constructs\nHelms and Talleyrand (1997) argued individuals receive dif-\nferential treatment based on physical appearance not culture.\nAlternately, Phinney (1996) believed race is the less clear\nconcept because of a lack of consensus on usage and mean-\ning, and that ethnicity includes race. Some researchers have\nproposed these concepts should be combined (especially\nwhen describing non-White groups) because of the conver-\ngence of race and ethnicity in lived experience (Casas, 1984;\nbined terms include racial/ethnic minority, ethnic and racial\nidentity (ERI), and visible racial/ethnic group (VREG). (The\nauthor acknowledges it may be more accurate to use the\nterms race/ethnicity and ethnic/racial identity development\nthroughout this article based on these perspectives.) There\nare also differing views on whether racial identity is primar-\nily driven by interracial or intraracial experiences (Ch\u00e1vez &\ncompounded by a collection of measures that focus on differ-\nsures generally focus on processes that contribute to identity\ndevelopment (e.g., attitudes about different racial groups and\none's relative place in them), the contents or characteristics\nof a developed identity (e.g., views on the importance of\nrace), or both (Schwartz et al., 2014). These narrowly defined\nperspectives of racial identity are then used to infer an indi-\nvidual's identity status. The measurement of racial identity is\nfurther obfuscated by an overreliance on survey data, limited\nand conflicting views of self and others, cross-cultural\ndifferences, the underreporting of racial information, reluc-\ntance to self-categorize, and social desirability effects\n(Abrams & Trusty, 2004; Burrell, Winston, & Freeman,\nThe proposed model could move us closer to modeling\nand predicting racial identity patterns and development,\nand understanding which types of situations can lead to\nidentity variability and crisis--even though the complete\nprediction of thoughts and behavior will remain out of\nreach. The paradox is summed up in Edward Lorenz's defi-\nnition of chaos (as cited in Danforth, 2013): \"when the\npresent determines the future, but the approximate present\ndoes not approximately determine the future.\" This para-\ndox, along with the questionable validity and ambivalence\nof categories such as race, is why racial identity develop-\nment theories and virtually any effort to reduce individuals\nto racial categories is of somewhat limited use and will dis-\nplay weak statistical power (Carter & Fenton, 2009;\nMarkus, 2008). Although there are statistical measures spe-\ncifically designed for analyzing systems influenced by non-\nlinear and attractor dynamics (e.g., Brittian, 2012; Granic\nthe initial challenges of modeling racial identity as attractor\nstates involves determining the best choices among various\nrace-related constructs and measures (and possibly frag-\nmenting them into subcategories for optimal coding). The\nnext harrowing task is deciding on (and fulfilling) the nec-\nessary frequency, conditions, and methods of measurement\nto accurately portray the multiplicity of states exhibited\nFogel, 2011). Put simply, if racial identity is truly continu-\nous, dynamic, situational, and often subtle, identity param-\neters should be measured continuously to understand racial\nidentity fully and completely--especially as memory is fal-\nlible and biased toward confirmatory information (Brittian,\n2007). As this deconstruction extends to the proposed\nmodel, an attractor landscape model of race and racial iden-\ntity development likely demonstrates the same limitations\nas the theories it attempts to build on and unify because of\nshared epistemological and ontological constraints, which\nalso affect the examination of culture and ethnicity\nThis is complicated by the difficulties associated with\nunderstanding and analyzing the macro\u00admicro reality and\nintersubjectivity of social phenomena such as race or eth-\nnicity (see Gillespie & Cornish, 2010; Jaspal & Cinnirella,\nnewer research techniques, such as agent-based modeling,\nare insufficient for gaining a complete understanding of\ncomplex racial dynamics because of innumerous percep-\ntions and countless interactions among personal character-\nistics and the environment (Abdelal, Herrera, Johnston, &\nSmaldino, Pickett, Sherman, & Schank, 2012; Spencer et\nal., 1997). These difficulties and limitations collectively\nlend credence to Tyson's (2017) aphorism in the second\nepigraph. Therefore, this model may, at best, be described\nas only a conceptual model that uses the laws of physics\nand nonlinear dynamics as a metaphor for the structure and\nprocess of race and racial identity development.\nThere is also some uncertainty on what would be consid-\nered an optimal racial identity dynamic. Low levels of self-\ncomplexity may be problematic because of excessive rigidity,\nand high levels of self-complexity may reflect disorder\n(Guastello, 2015). As noted earlier, a fixed or rigid racial\nidentity may be pathological or stagnant as one's internal\npositions should demonstrate flexibility (Blackman, 2005;\nParham, 1989). Conversely, although many racial identity\ntheories present a dynamic identity as an optimal outcome,\nSanchez et al. (2009) found malleable racial identity was\nassociated with decreased psychological health and well-\nbeing in multiracial individuals. Research should be com-\npleted to more clearly understand to what extent and how a\ndynamic identity is healthy and should be internally or exter-\nnally controlled, and to what extent and in what types of situ-\nations a fixed racial identity is a sign of strength versus being\nmaladaptive or a possible indication of psychopathology.\nFuture research could frame other identity categories,\nsuch as gender, sexuality, class, and sexual orientation, as\nattractor landscapes based on dynamics, rationales, and con-\nstructs similar to those identified in this article. However,\nthis research enterprise raises the same issues identified with\nthe modeling and measuring of racial identity across states\nand timescales. The final research goal then becomes model-\ning interactions between these various identity landscapes.\nPossible guides to this synthesis include theoretical models\ninformed by ecological, intersectional, cross-disciplinary,\nand complex systems approaches to social identities (e.g.,\nFinally, game theory, like chaos and complexity, has also\nunified and explained diverse fields (Gintis, 2009; Guastello,\ntion based on social identity (Rub\u00ed-Barcel\u00f3, 2013).\nCombining game theory, chaos, and complexity provides a\npotentially powerful statistical means of modeling and ana-\nlyzing social phenomena. Significant progress has been\nmade toward theoretical unification of these perspectives by\ndynamical systems game theory. Within dynamical systems\ngame theory, as is the case with race, \"the game itself can\nchange due to the influence of players' behaviors and states\"\ngame theory are also possible. Greenberg's (1990) theory of\nsocial situations is a game-theoretic approach that frames\nindividuals in a social environment where they understand\nrecommended behaviors, choose what is perceived to be the\nbest action, and consider the consequences. Similarly, in a\ngame-theoretic framework proposed by Bednar and Page\n(2007), culture emerges through an ensemble of games\nplayed by agents. Although it is impossible to determine\nevery conceivable action, it may be reasonable to model\n8 SAGE Open\nracial identification and categorical preferences in situations\nthat prime thinking and behavior associated with race.\n"
