The cardiovascular system of a pregnant woman develops adaptation to the increased load.\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is known to play an important role in the adaptation. The present study was\ndesigned to investigate whether the insertion-deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene is associated with the level\nof arterial blood pressure in women before and during pregnancy.\nMaterials and methods: The level of blood pressure was measured in 591 Russian women (Central Russia) before\nand during (37\u00ad40 weeks term) pregnancy. The women were divided into three groups which were hypertensive, hypo-\ntensive, and normotensive according to blood pressure level. Genotyping of the ACE I/D polymorphism was performed\nusing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism assay.\nResults: Women with genotype DD showed the highest blood pressure level both during and at the end of preg-\nnancy (p<0.05). The highest frequencies of allele D and genotype DD were found in pregnant women in the hyper-\ntensive group.\nConclusions: The deletion variant of the ACE gene is associated with high blood pressure level at the end of pregnancy.\n",

These functional changes may result in an increased\nloadonthecardiovascularsystemofawoman.3 Impairments\nof the cardiovascular system during pregnancy may cause\npreeclampsia4,5 and, thereby, lead to chronic intrauterine\nhypoxia and placental failure.6\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and, in par-\nticular, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is known to\nplay an important regulatory role in the function of the\nCVS. The enzyme hydrolyses angiotensin I into angioten-\nsin II, a powerful vasoconstrictor.7 Several polymorphisms\nof the ACE gene have been studied with respect to\nthe association with CVS functioning under normal and\ndiseased conditions.8\u00ad10 One of these polymorphisms is an\ninsertion-deletion (I/D) of the 287-bp Alu repetitive ele-\nment in intron 16 of the gene.11 The polymorphism does not\naffect the protein structure but apparently influences\nexpression of this gene.\nThe insertion-deletion polymorphism\nof the ACE gene is associated with\nincreased blood pressure in\nwomen at the end of pregnancy\nEvgeny A Reshetnikov1, Ludmila Y Akulova1, Irina S\nDobrodomova1, Volodymyr Y Dvornyk2, Alexey V Polonikov3 and\nMikhail I Churnosov1\n Keywords\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme, insertion-deletion polymorphism, blood pressure, arterial hypertension, pregnancy\nDepartment of Medical Biological Disciplines, Belgorod National\nResearch University, Russia\n2School of Biological Sciences, University of Hong Kong, China\nDepartment of Biology, Medical Genetics and Ecology, Kursk State\nMedical University, Russia\nCorresponding author:\nEvgeny A Reshetnikov, Department of Medical Biological Disciplines,\nBelgorod National Research University, 85 Pobeda St., Belgorod,\nEmail: reshetnikov@bsu.edu.ru\nOriginal Article\n624 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(3)\nSeveral studies reported that bloodACE levels in healthy\nindividuals with the DD genotype were twice as high as\nthose in the II homozygotes, with the heterozygotes having\nan intermediate value.11\u00ad13 The studies reporting the asso-\nciation of the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene with the\nblood pressure (BP) level in pregnant women are contradic-\ntory. This prompts further research on the role of the I/D\npolymorphism of ACE gene in the regulation of BP during\npregnancy.\nMaterials and methods\nStudy subjects\nThe study population included 591 unrelated women of\nRussian descent living in Central Russia (Belgorod region).\nThe age of the women varied from 20\u00ad43 years (mean age\nEthics Committee at Belgorod State University. All women\nsigned an informed consent form prior to the recruitment\nfor this study.\nClinical and laboratory examinations of women were\nconducted at the Perinatal Center (Division of Pathological\nPregnancy) of the Belgorod Regional Clinical Hospital.\nThe criteria for inclusion in the study group were (a)\nRussian nationality; (b) pregnancy at 37\u00ad40 weeks of ges-\ntation; and () signed informed consent for the study.\nPregnant women with diabetes mellitus, hepatic or renal\nfailure, and those at a gestation <37 weeks and >40 weeks\nwere excluded from the study. A general outline is shown in\nFigure 1. BP level was measured three times by experi-\nenced obstetricians according to the American Heart\nAssociation recommendations.14 The measurements were\nbefore pregnancy were obtained from the medical records\nof each woman. The mean arterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg)\nwas calculated as follows:\nMAP=(SBP+2DBP)/3 where SBP is systolic blood\npressure and DBP is diastolic blood pressure.15\nAll study participants were divided into three groups\ndepending on the BP level at the end of pregnancy. The\ngroups included normotensive women (SBP from 90\u00ad140\nmm Hg and/or DBP from 60\u00ad90 mm Hg), hypotensive\nwomen (SBP<90 mm Hg and/or DBP<60 mm Hg), and\nDNA extraction and genotyping\nVenous blood (8\u00ad9 ml) was drawn from the ulnar vein of\neach woman. Genomic DNA was isolated using the\nmethod proposed Miller and et al.17 Genotyping of the\ngene was performed using a polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism\n(AFLP) assay according to the protocol described\nStatistical analysis\nAllele frequencies of the ACE gene polymorphism were\nestimated by the gene counting method, and the chi-squire\ntest was used to identify significant departure from Hardy\u00ad\nWeinberg equilibrium (HWE). The distribution of allele\nand genotype frequencies between the study groups was\ncompared by the chi-squire test for 2\u00d72 contingency tables.\nThe p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the\nBonferroni correction (pcor\n). The distribution of the quanti-\ntative traits such as SBP, DBP, MAP and pulse pressure (the\npressure difference between the systolic and diastolic pres-\nsures) before and at the end of pregnancy were analyzed by\nthe Shapiro-Wilk's test.19 Because the values of the quanti-\ntative traits did not follow the normal distribution, median\n(Me) and interquartile range (Q25\u00adQ75) were used for their\ndescription and intergroup comparisons were done using\nthe Mann-Whitney test.20 Linear regression analysis was\nused to estimate the impact of age, weight, and ACE geno-\ntypes on the BP parameters in women. All statistical analy-\nses were performed using STATISTICA for Windows v. 6.0\n(StatSoft, USA).\nResults\nThe biomedical and clinical characteristics of the study\nwomen are shown in Table 1.As can be seen from Table 1, the\nprevalence of hypertension among women before and at the\nprevalence of hypotension dropped from 19.1% prior to preg-\nnancy to 4.1% at the end of pregnancy. Moreover the values\nof BP increased significantly in women to the end of preg-\nnancy in comparison with women prior to pregnancy. Obesity\nwomen had excessive body weight, whereas 8.1% of women\nhad decreased body weight. The study group also comprised\n7.8% of women who had other extragenital pathology.\nThe observed ACE genotype frequencies in the study par-\nticipants were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The frequency\nsistent with data reported in other European populations.21 No\nstatistically significant differences in the distribution of the\nACE genotypes prior to pregnancy were observed between\nthe three study groups (Table 2).\nFriedmans ANOVA test allowed us to reveal that the\nBP parameters increased significantly by the end of preg-\nnancy in comparison with those prior to pregnancy, with\nmost increased BP level in carriers of genotype DD.\nHowever, as can be seen from Table 2, the values of the\nsystolic and mean BP during pregnancy were the lowest in\nwomen with the II genotype and the highest in women\nwith the DD genotype. At 37\u00ad40 weeks of gestation,\nwomen with genotypes DD and ID had greater values of\nSBP, DBP and average BP as compared to those with\ngenotype II. Furthermore, the frequency of allele D was\nthe highest in the group of women with hypertension at the\nend of pregnancy (56.6%) followed by the subjects with\nare shown in Figure 2). Accordingly, the largest number of\nindividuals with genotype DD and the lowest one with\ngenotype II were observed in the hypertensive women\nFigure 1.The general outline of the investigation.\nACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme; I/D: insertion-deletion.\n626 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(3)\npattern of the genotype distribution was seen in the hypo-\n3). None of the study groups (normotensive, hypotensive\nor hypertensive women) showed statistically significant\ndifferences in the parameters of BP between the carriers of\nthe ACE genotypes among women before and during a\npregnancy (Table 3).\nLinear regression analysis observed the impact of cur-\nof pregnancy (R2=15.33%). In addition, the DBP depended\nseen with respect to the pulse pressure of pregnant women.\nDiscussion\nThe results of the present study suggest that the I/D poly-\nmorphism of the ACE gene is associated with the level of\narterial BP at the later stage of pregnancy (37\u00ad40 weeks) in\nwomen. Allele D confers higher BP, whereas allele I is\nassociated with lower BP. The observed association\nbetween the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene and level\nof BP in women at the end of pregnancy is supported by the\ndata about the physiological role of this enzyme. It has been\nrecently reported that healthy individuals possessing the D\nallele of the ACE gene had significantly higher levels of the\ncirculating enzyme in blood than those possessing the\nhomozygous II genotype, while the heterozygotes had the\nintermediate levels.11\u00ad13 The ACE enzyme participates in\nthe synthesis of angiotensin II, which has a strong vasocon-\nstrictor effect.22 Therefore, individuals with the highly\nexpressed DD genotype have a higher vascular tone and BP\nlevel.23 Furthermore, under normal conditions, concentra-\ntion of the ACE in plasma of pregnant women constantly\nincreases until the third trimester. Notably, women with\ngenotype DD ACE have the maximum concentration of the\nenzyme as compared to those with genotypes ID and II,11,12\nand in turn, this results in higher BP at the end of\npregnancy.\nAmple evidence exists about association of the I/D ACE\npolymorphism with various cardiovascular disorders such\nmyocardial infarction,28 and myocardial hypertrophy.29 It\nshould be noted that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone sys-\ntem may be involved in the development of both insulin\nresistance and gestational diabetes mellitus.30 The increased\nlevels of ACE in plasma accounted for by the DD geno-\ntype11 may be responsible for the increasing levels of aldos-\nterone and thereby lead to insulin resistance and gestational\ndiabetes.\nThe literature data on association between the I/D poly-\nmorphism of the ACE gene and hypertension during preg-\nnancy are contradictory. In Table 4, we summarize several\ngenetic studies which investigated the association of I/D\npolymorphism of the ACE gene and BP level during preg-\nnancy. In particular, a higher frequency of allele D and\ngenotype DD was reported among patients with pregnancy-\ninduced hypertension (PIH) in the Chinese population.31,32\nOne of the studies32 has found the association of genotype\nDD with higher concentrations of plasma angiotensin II in\npregnant women with hypertension, as compared to healthy\nwomen. Similar results were obtained in the Indian sample\nconsisting of 50 pregnant women with PIH and 50 pregnant\nwomen with normotension.33 The authors reported the\nassociation of genotype DD with PIH, although they did\nnot find any association of the I/D polymorphism with\neither plasma ACE levels or hypertension.33\nThe study conducted on the Arabian population has\nfound a relationship between the genotype DD and hyper-\ntension in pregnant women with preeclampsia.34 However,\ncontradictory results have been obtained in a number of\nstudies conducted in Chinese, Indian, African and Italian\nnant women from Northern India, no association of either\nTable 1.The biomedical and clinical characteristics of the study\nwomen.\nVariables Value\nBMI: body mass index; DBP: diastolic blood pressure DBP: change of\ndiastolic blood pressure; MAP: change of mean arterial pressure; SBP:\nchange of systolic blood pressure; MAP: mean arterial pressure; Me:\nmedian; PBP: pulse blood pressure; Q25\u00adQ75: interquartile range; SBP:\nsystolic blood pressure.\nTable 2.Associations of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion-deletion (I/D) polymorphism with the blood pressure parameters in the study women.\nValues of blood pressure Genotypes)\np (pcor)\nSBP, mm Hg\n\n\nweeks term)\nweeks term)\nweeks term)\nweeks term)\nANOVA: analysis of variance; DBP: diastolic blood pressure; MAP: mean arterial pressure; p: value for the Mann-Whitney test; pcor\n: p: value for the Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction; PBP: pulse\nblood pressure; SBP: systolic blood pressure.The values of blood pressure level are expressed as median (Me) and interquartile range (Q25\u00adQ75).\n628 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(3)\nTable 3.Association analysis of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion-deletion (I/D) polymorphism with blood\npressure parameters in hypotensive, normotensive and hypertensive groups of women.\nValues of blood\npressure\nGenotypes p\nHypotension\nSBP, mm Hg\n\n\nDuring pregnancy\nFigure 2.
