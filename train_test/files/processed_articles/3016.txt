    "reduced_content": "Background: High prevalence estimates in epidemio-\nlogical surveys have led to concerns that the DSM sys-\ntem is overly inclusive and that mild cases should be ex-\ncluded from future DSM editions.\nObjective: To demonstrate that the DSM-III-R disor-\nders in the baseline National Comorbidity Survey\n(NCS) can be placed on a severity gradient that has a\ndose-response relationship with outcomes assessed a\ndecade later in the NCS follow-up survey (NCS-2) and\nthat no inflection point exists at the mild severity\nlevel.\nMethods: The NCS was a nationally representative\nhousehold survey of DSM-III-R disorders in the 3-year\nThe NCS-2 outcomes include hospitalization for men-\ntal health or substance disorders, work disability due\nto these disorders, suicide attempts, and serious men-\ntal illness.\nResults: Twelve-month NCS/DSM-III-R disorders were\nerate, and 16.0% mild case categories. All 4 case catego-\nries were associated with statistically significantly (P.05,\n2-sided tests) elevated risk of the NCS-2 outcomes com-\npared with baseline noncases, with odds ratios of any out-\ncome ranging monotonically from 2.4 (95% confidence\n22.9) for mild to severe cases. Odds ratios comparing mild\nto moderate cases were generally nonsignificant.\nConclusions: There is a graded relationship between\nmental illness severity and later clinical outcomes. Re-\ntention of mild cases in the DSM is important to repre-\nsent the fact that mental disorders (like physical disor-\nders) vary in severity. Decisions about treating mild cases\nshould be based on cost-effectiveness not current sever-\nity. Cost-effectiveness analysis should include recogni-\ntion that treatment of mild cases might prevent a sub-\nstantial proportion of future serious cases.\nTWO MAJOR psychiatric epi-\ndemiological surveys have\nbeen carried out in the\nthe Epidemiologic Catch-\nment Area Study1 and the National Co-\nmorbidity Survey (NCS).2 Both surveys\nestimated that about 30% of the respon-\ndents in the 18- to 54-year age range met\ncriteria for 1 or more of the 12-month\nDSM-III (Epidemiologic Catchment Area)\nor DSM-III-R (NCS) psychiatric disor-\nders assessed in the surveys.3,4 These are\nlower-bound estimates, as neither of the\nsurveys included the full range of DSM dis-\norders in their assessments and even this\nrange of disorders is likely to be nonin-\nclusive.5,6 Nevertheless, these rates seemed\nhigh, leading to the suggestion that the lay\nadministered diagnostic interviews in these\nsurveys might be upwardly biased.7,8 How-\never, clinical calibration studies showed\nthat the prevalence estimates in these sur-\nveys were not upwardly biased,9,10 lead-\ning critics to conclude that the DSM sys-\nconclusion was instrumental in causing an\nAmerican Psychiatric Association Task\nForce to add a clinical significance crite-\nrion to many disorders in the DSM-IV to\nremind readers of the basic definition of\na mental disorder in the \"Introduction\" of\nthe manual. However, even when this ad-\nditional requirement was applied post hoc\nto the Epidemiologic Catchment Area and\nNCS data, the 12-month prevalence of a\nDSM disorder, equivalent to about 37 mil-\nlion adults in the United States, contin-\nued to exceed substantially the number\nwho could be helped with current treat-\nIn recognition of this problem, sev-\neral more restrictive definitions have been\nproposed that can be used to narrow the\nnumber of persons qualifying for treat-\nment.

Darryl Regier, MD, director of the Division of Re-\nsearch at the American Psychiatric Association, who is\nexpected to play a prominent role in the development of\nDSM-V, has supported similar restrictions using more\nelaborate requirements for clinically significant distress\nThe SPMI and SMI proposals are different from the\nRegier proposal for DSM-V. The definitions of SPMI and\nSMI are practical attempts to focus treatment resources on\nthe subset of cases with the greatest need. In comparison,\nthe Regier proposed restriction of cases in DSM-V is an at-\ntempt to declare that mild cases do not exist. This radical\napproachhasimplicationsnotonlyforthedefinitionofcur-\nrent unmet need for treatment but also for current re-\nsearch and consideration of future treatment needs. Re-\nsearch shows that many syndromes currently defined as\nmental disorders are extremes on continua that appear not\nto have meaningful thresholds.18,19 These results are im-\nportant in at least 2 ways. First, exploration of the full con-\ntinuaratherthanthecurrentlyestablisheddiagnosticthresh-\nolds might yield greater power in studies of genetic and\nenvironmental risk factors.20 Second, development of early\ninterventions to prevent progression along a given sever-\nity continuum might reduce the prevalence of serious\ncases.21 Removal of current mild cases from the DSM sys-\ntem would undercut both of these advantages as well as\ndistort the reality that mental disorders (like physical dis-\norders) vary widely in seriousness.22,23\nThe current article presents data designed to argue\nagainst using the deletion of mild cases from future edi-\ntions of the DSM as an approach to restrict the number\nof persons who are defined as being in need of treat-\nment. The argument is based on the expansion of an analy-\nsis of the NCS that was recently reported in the ARCHIVES\nby Narrow, Regier, and colleagues.13 These authors di-\nvided 12-month NCS/DSM-III-R cases into those consid-\nered either clinically significant mental illness (CSMI) or\nclinically nonsignificant mental illness(CNMI) based on\nrespondent reports about interference and treatment.\nComparison of these 2 subgroups showed, not surpris-\ningly, that various indicators of illness severity (eg, days\nout of role [ie, the number of days when a person is un-\nable to carry out their normal activities], history of sui-\ncide attempts) were higher in CSMI than CNMI. Nar-\nrow, Regier, and colleagues asserted, based on these\nresults, that mild cases should be excluded from DSM-V.\nWe build on this analysis in 2 ways. First, we use\ndata from the recently completed NCS-2,24 a survey that\nreinterviewed NCS respondents a decade after their base-\nline interviews, to examine the associations of baseline\nNCS 12-month illness severity with clinically signifi-\ncant outcomes assessed in NCS-2. Second, we expand the\nnumber of illness severity categories from 2 to 4 by di-\nviding the cases that Narrow, Regier, and colleagues de-\nfined as having CSMI into severe, serious, and moderate\ncases. We show that differences in the risk of clinically\nsignificant outcomes in NCS-2 across these severity cat-\negories are as large as, and in some cases larger than, those\nbetween moderate and mild (ie, CNMI) cases. We also\nshow that the elevated risk of the NCS-2 outcomes among\nmild cases vs noncases is consistently larger than the el-\nevated risk among moderate cases vs mild cases. These\nresults call into question the suggestion that the DSM-V\ncase threshold should be set above CNMI rather than at\nany other arbitrary point on the severity gradient.\nMETHODS\nSAMPLE\nThe baseline NCS was a nationally representative household\ndents were selected from a stratified, multistage area probabil-\nity sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian population in the\n48 coterminous states, with a supplemental sample of stu-\ndents living in campus housing. The survey response rate was\n82.4%. All NCS respondents were administered a part I diag-\nnostic interview (described in the \"Baseline Diagnostic Assess-\nment\" section), while a part II risk factor interview was ad-\nministered to a probability subsample of 5877 respondents who\nincluded all those in the age range of 15 to 24 years, all those\nwho screened positive for any of the DSM-III disorders as-\nsessed in part I, and a 1 in 6 random subsample of all remain-\ning part I respondents. The part II sample was weighted to ad-\njust for differential probabilities of selection as well as for\nThe NCS-2 attempted to trace and reinterview all 5877 part\nII NCS respondents a decade after the baseline NCS using an ex-\npanded version of the baseline interview that reconstructed in-\nformation on illness onset, course, and severity during the years\nbetween the 2 surveys. A total of 5463 target respondents were\ninterviewed for a conditional response rate of 76.6%. The uncon-\nditional response rate, which considers the baseline NCS re-\nspondentsdiffersignificantlyfromotherbaselineNCSrespondents\nin higher probabilities of being female, well educated, and resi-\ndents of rural areas (Table 1, part I). A propensity score adjust-\nment weight26 was used to correct the NCS-2 sample for these\ncompositional biases. There was remarkably little difference, in\ncomparison, between NCS-2 respondents and nonrespondents\neither in the prevalence of baseline NCS/DSM-III-R disorders or\nin the severity of these disorders (Table 1, part II).\nThe baseline NCS diagnostic interview was a modified version\nof the World Health Organization Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview (CIDI).27,28 Diagnoses were based on\nDSM-III-R criteria. The 12-month diagnoses available in the part\nII sample, which are the focus of this article, are mood disor-\nders (major depression, mania, dysthymia), anxiety disorders\n(panicdisorder,agoraphobiawithoutpanic,socialphobia,simple\nphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress dis-\norder), substance use disorders (alcohol or other drug abuse\nor dependence), and nonaffective psychosis (NAP) (schizo-\nphrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder,\ndelusional disorder, or psychosis not otherwise specified).

All rights reserved.\nthe baseline interview was met by 31.2% of the weighted part\nII NCS sample.\nA clinical calibration of all NCS/DSM-III-R diagnoses other\nthan NAP was carried out with blind follow-up interviews of\n356 NCS respondents using the lifetime version of the Struc-\ntured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID).29 The vast ma-\njority of CIDI prevalence estimates were lower than the SCID\nprevalence estimates.10 However, only 2 differences were sta-\ntistically significant--an overestimated prevalence of major de-\npression in the CIDI compared with the SCID and an under-\nestimated prevalence of simple phobia in the CIDI compared\nwith the SCID. A separate calibration study for NAP showed\nthat, although the CIDI could be used as a useful first-stage\nscreen for NAP, no calibration rule could generate valid diag-\nnoses of NAP from the CIDI data.30 Based on this result, an at-\ntempt was made to administer a clinical reappraisal interview\nfor NAP to all NCS respondents who screened positive for NAP\nin the baseline NCS. Clinician-diagnosed NAP was subse-\nquently used instead of CIDI-diagnosed NAP in all NCS re-\nports, including the current report.\nThe baseline illness severity scale was created by using 3 pre-\nviously published definitions: (1) The National Mental Health\nAdvisory Council definition of SPMI;14 (2) the Substance Abuse\nand Mental Health Services Administration definition of SMI15;\nand (3) the definition of CSMI recently made by Narrow, Reiger,\nand colleagues.13 The operational definitions of SPMI and SMI\nhave been described in detail elsewhere.31,32 Briefly, SPMI was\ndefined as either (1) meeting criteria for 12-month NAP or ma-\nnia or (2) having a 12-month anxiety or mood disorder that\nrequired hospitalization or treatment with antipsychotic medi-\ncations. Serious mental illness was defined as either (1) meet-\ning criteria for SPMI or (2) having a 12-month anxiety or mood\ndisorder that was associated with at least 1 indicator of serious\nrole impairment (suicidality, mental health-related work dis-\nability, marital violence, or extreme social isolation). Follow-\ning Narrow, Reiger, and colleagues,13 CSMI was defined as hav-\ning a 12-month NCS/DSM-III-R diagnosis that either (1) was\ndescribed by the respondent as interfering \"a lot\" with his or\nher life and activities or (2) was treated at some time in the 12\nmonths before the baseline NCS interview. Clinically nonsig-\nnificant mental illness, finally, was defined as any 12-month\nNCS/DSM-III-R disorder that did not meet the requirements for\nCSMI. Using these definitions and defining categories hierar-\nchically, 3.2% (SE, 0.3%) of part II NCS respondents met 12-\nmonth criteria at baseline for SPMI, an additional 3.2% (SE,\n0.2%) met criteria for SMI but not SPMI, an additional 8.7%\n(SE, 0.4%) met criteria for CSMI but neither SPMI nor SMI,\nand an additional 16.0% (SE, 0.5%) met criteria for CNMI but\nnot SPMI, SMI, or CSMI.\nThe 4 NCS-2 outcomes considered herein were defined as fol-\nlows: (1) Hospitalization was defined as being hospitalized for\nmental health or substance problems at any time in the decade\nbetween the NCS and NCS-2 interviews. This outcome was re-\nported by 2.5% (SE, 0.3%) of the NCS-2 respondents. (2) Work\ndisability was defined as being out of work on disability for a\nmental health or substance problem for a minimum of 4 con-\nsecutive weeks at any time between the 2 interviews. This out-\ncome was reported by 1.4% (SE, 0.2%) of the NCS-2 respon-\ndents. (3) Suicide attempt was defined as reporting an attempted\nsuicide at any time between the 2 interviews. This outcome was\nreported by 1.4% (SE, 0.2%) of the NCS-2 respondents. (4) Se-\nrious mental illness was defined as meeting the criteria de-\nscribed earlier for SMI in the 12 months before the NCS-2 in-\nterview. This outcome was reported by 5.6% (SE, 0.5) of the\nNCS-2 respondents. At least 1 of the 4 outcomes was reported\nControlling for respondent age and sex, logistic regression analy-\nsis was used to predict the NCS-2 outcomes from dummy vari-\nables that distinguished NCS respondents with baseline\n12-month severe, serious, moderate, and mild DSM-III-R/NCS\ndisorders compared with respondents who did not meet crite-\nria for any of these disorders at the time of the original NCS.\nParallel logistic regression equations were estimated to com-\nBetween NCS-2 Respondents and Nonrespondents*\nVariable\nRespondents\nNonrespondents\nPart I.

Logistic regression\ncoefficients were transformed to odds ratios (ORs) and are re-\nported with design-based 95% confidence intervals (CIs) esti-\nmated using the Taylor series linearization method,33 imple-\nmented in the SUDAAN software package.34 Wald 2 tests\ncorrecting for the clustering and weighting of the NCS-2 data\nwere used to evaluate overall model fit. Simulations using an\nSAS (SAS Inc, Cary, NC) macro estimated the population at-\ntributable risk proportion of each outcome associated with each\ncategory of the baseline clinical severity distinction. The popu-\nlation attributable risk proportion was operationalized in this\nmacro as the proportional reduction in the prevalence of the\noutcome estimated from the logistic regression equation when\nthe OR associated with a given category of severity was set to\n1.0. This ratio can be interpreted as the proportion of respon-\ndents with the outcome who would no longer have the out-\ncome in the absence of the elevated risk associated with the speci-\nfied disorder severity category. All analyses of statistical\nsignificance were based on P=.05, 2-sided tests.\nRESULTS\nA consistent monotonic relationship exists between the\nbaseline illness severity categories and the 4 NCS-2 out-\ncomes (Table 2), with only 1 inversion in monotonic-\nity (the OR for mild cases was larger than the OR for mod-\nerate cases in predicting work disability). The largest ORs\nassociated with severe cases are in the range of 5.60 to\n29.7, while the smallest ORs associated with mild cases\nare in the range of 1.3 to 2.7. Three of the 3 ORs asso-\nciated with mild cases are statistically significant at the\nA comparison of pairwise differences in outcomes\nacross contiguous categories of the baseline illness se-\nverity gradient (Table 3) finds 10 statistically signifi-\ncant differences (P.05, 2-sided tests) of 20 compari-\nsons. Importantly, the differences between moderate cases\nvs mild cases are consistently smaller than either the dif-\nferences between severe cases vs serious cases or seri-\nous cases vs moderate cases. The moderate vs mild dis-\ntinction is statistically significant in only 1 comparison\n(SMI in the year before the NCS-2 interview). The mild\nvs none distinction, in comparison, is significant in 3 com-\nparisons and consistently larger than the moderate vs mild\ndistinction.\nThe population attributable risk proportions asso-\nciated with each category of baseline illness severity\n(Table 4) vary less than the ORs.

No consistent inflec-\ntion point in the gradient of outcome risk can be found\nat the point on the distribution proposed by Narrow,\nRegier, and colleagues13 as distinguishing between CSMI\nand CNMI. The results also show that the elevated risk\nof NCS-2 outcomes among mild cases vs noncases is con-\nsistently larger than the elevated risk among moderate\ncases vs mild cases. These results call into question the\nsuggestion that the case threshold should exclude mild\ncases.\nThis is not to say that more principled consider-\nations, based either on future epidemiological, biologi-\ncal, or taxometric studies, might not lead to the conclu-\nsion that diagnostic thresholds for certain DSM disorders\nshould be changed. Nor is it to say that the problem that\nmotivated Narrow, Regier, and colleagues13 to propose\nnarrowing the DSM criteria (the number of persons who\nmeet current criteria is much larger than the number of\npersons who can be treated with available treatment re-\nsources) is unimportant. However, the solution to this\nproblem proposed by Narrow, Regier, and colleagues to\ndefine the problem out of existence is ill conceived. The\ndefinition of a case should not be considered synony-\nmous with need for treatment any more than with clini-\ncally significant distress or impairment.35\nThe problem of unmet need for treatment should\nbe addressed by developing comprehensive triage rules\nthat allocate available resources based on evidence-\nbased assessments of the cost-effectiveness of available\ntreatments across the severity threshold of the disorder.\nSeverity gradients are widely used in this way in other\nbranches of medicine.36 In the absence of such rules, which\ndo not exist, ad hoc decision making is inevitable.37 In\ndeveloping these rules for mental disorders, consider-\nation should be given not only to current distress and\nimpairment but also to the risk of progression from a mild\nto a more severe disorder. It is unclear whether these rules,\nonce they are developed, would define treatment of mild\ncases as cost-effective. Even if they did not, mild cases\nshould be retained in the definition of disorders both to\nacknowledge that mental disorders (like physical disor-\nders) vary in severity and to remind us that the devel-\nopment of cost-effective treatments for mild disorders\nmight prevent a substantial proportion of future serious\ndisorders.\ntal Health (NIMH), with supplemental support from grant\nNY.
