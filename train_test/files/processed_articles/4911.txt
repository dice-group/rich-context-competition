Recently, Nishio et al.23 reported 2 gene polymor-\nphisms of angiotensin-converting enzyme deletion/\ninsertion (ACE D/I) and bradykinin B2 receptor -58T/C\ncontribute to the risk ofACEI-related cough in EastAsians,\nbut a negative association between the ACE I/D polymor-\nphism and ACEI-related cough was observed in\nCaucasians. Thus, the effect of ARB should be clarified in\nJapanese CKD patients, which motivated us to explore the\neffect of ARBs in dialysis-requiring CHF in late-stage\nCKD patients in Japan.\nTo date, preventive effects of the medications used for\nCKD on patients with dialysis-requiring CHF is not well\nunderstood.24\u00ad26 In addition, few clinical reports focus on\npatients with Stage 5 CKD, which is defined by an esti-\nmated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of < 15 mL/\nmin/1.73m2. A recent study reports that ACEI or ARB use\nin non-dialysis patients with Stage 5 CKD is associated\nwith a reduced risk of long-term dialysis or death,27 but no\ninformation was provided regarding dialysis-requiring\nCHF patients.\nAmong the uremic symptoms that require renal replace-\nment therapy (RRT), CHF significantly predicts the inci-\ndence of cardiac events and mortality in end-stage kidney\ndisease.28,29 Unfortunately, no effective preventative treat-\nment for CHF has been definitively described for patients\nwith Stage 5 CKD. Furthermore, the ability of ARB to pre-\nvent CHF (a major reason for initiating RRT) has not been\nassessed in patients with Stage 5 CKD. Thus, we evaluated\nthe associations between various medications (including\nACEI and ARB) and the prevalence of dialysis-requiring\nCHF in non-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD.\nOur objective was to explore which CKD medication\nwould be associated with a reduced prevalence of dialysis-\nrequiring CHF, in non-dialysis Japanese patients with\nStage 5 CKD.\nMethods\nStudy design\nThis study used a cross-sectional, observational multicenter\ndesign, and included 3447 Japanese patients across nine\nJapanese institutions, whom had initiated RRT between 1\ntutions belonged to the Japanese Study Group forAssessing\nInitiation of Renal Replacement Therapy (J-START), and\nthese institutions served as the primary pre-dialysis source\nof information, for patients with end-stage kidney disease.\nAll the J-START members are nephrologists who have\nbeen certified by the Japanese Society of Nephrology and\nthe Japanese Society of Dialysis Therapy. We collected\nclinical information and hematological data at the institu-\ntional level, immediately before the patient's first hemodi-\nalysis session, according to the J-START database sheet\n(Microsoft Excel). Each patient's information was only\nlabeled with the institution and patient number, to protect\ntheir privacy. This study was performed in accordance with\nthe Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics committee for clini-\ncal research of Jikei University School of Medicine\nTo explore the association between CKD medications\nand dialysis-requiring CHF, the following inclusion crite-\nria were selected:\n1. Only Japanese Stage 5 CKD patients who were fol-\nlowed up over 3 months and received a stable pre-\nscription > 3 months by a nephrologist, to exclude\nemergent initiation of dialysis, for AKI; and\n2. Those with patient records with complete data,\nregarding the following factors: age, gender, pres-\nence of diabetic kidney disease, reasons (uremic\nsymptoms) for initiating RRT, history of ischemic\nheart disease (IHD), duration of nephrologist fol-\nlow-up, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and\nlaboratory data (hemoglobin, albumin, urea nitro-\ngen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, cor-\nrected calcium, phosphorus, C-reactive protein\n(CRP) and intact parathyroid hormone (PTH).\nAs a result, 1911 patients were excluded from the anal-\nysis, due to having Stage 1\u00ad4 CKD (45 patients), being \n19 years old (3 patients), having an uncertain history of\nIHD (164 patients) and comorbidity (29 patients), having a\nfollow-up period of < 3 months or of unknown length (819\npatients), lack of data regarding medication use\nin the previous 3 months (254 patients) and insufficient\npatients whom we evaluated, there were 1536 Japanese\npatients satisfying our inclusion criteria whom were\nincluded in our analysis (Figure 1). Compared to the\nincluded patients, the excluded patients whom had < 3\nmonths of nephrologist follow-up had a significantly\nhigher prevalence of dialysis-requiring CHF (35.8% ver-\nferences regarding age, gender, eGFR and history of IHD,\nwhen the included and excluded patients were compared.\nThe eGFR was calculated using the new Japanese equa-\nWe used a modified version of Framingham heart fail-\nure diagnostic criteria to confirm the diagnosis of CHF.31 A\ndiagnosis of CHF was made according to the presence of\northopnea, sudden weight gain and radiography findings\n(enlarged pulmonary vessels, alveolar edema and pleural\neffusion); and these findings were rapidly resolved after\nthe first hemodialysis session.\nWe also collected information regarding the patients'\nmedication use before starting dialysis. The specific medi-\ncations that we evaluated were erythropoietin receptor\nstimulating agents (ESAs), ACEIs, ARBs, calcium chan-\nnel blockers (CCBs), loop diuretics, other anti-hyperten-\nsive agents (alpha-blockers and/or beta-blockers, and/or\nother hypertensive drugs), Vitamin D receptor activators\n(VDRAs), calcium carbonate (CaCO3\n(Kureha Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) is an orally adminis-\ntered spherical carbon adsorbent that can adsorb various\nsmall molecule uremic toxins.32\nVariables.The primary outcome was the prevalence of\nCHF at dialysis initiation, and the predictor variable was\nthe CKD medications used before dialysis initiation. We\nalso selected the following explanatory variables: gender;\nage; comorbid diabetes mellitus; medical history of IHD;\nthe nephrology follow-up period; systolic and diastolic\nblood pressure; use of ARBs, ACEIs, CCBs, other antihy-\npertensive drugs, loop diuretics, ESAs, VDRAs, CaCO3\n,\nor AST-120; eGFR; serum uric acid; serum potassium;\nserum chloride; serum corrected calcium; serum phospho-\nrus; serum intact PTH; serum albumin; and hemoglobin\nconcentration.\nStatistics\nStatistical analyses were performed using JMP 9.0 (SAS\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

Therefore, we\nestimated that ARB use may prevent dialysis-requiring\nCHF in non-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD.\nIn the present study, ACEI use was not significantly\nassociated with dialysis-requiring CHF. The maximum\ndoses of ACEIs are permitted at a relatively lower range in\nJapan (enalapril, imidapril, lisinopril, trandolapril, cila-\nzapril and captopril are used at one-quarter to one-half\ndoses) than in Europe and USA, so ACEIs might not fully\nreduce CHF in Japan. For example, imidapril is used at\nlower doses, ranging from 2.5\u00ad10 mg in Japan, compared\nto relatively higher doses ranging from 5\u00ad20 mg in Europe;\nand ramipril, an effective ACEI for reduction of\ncardiovascular events, has not been used in Japan because\nof it giving persistent cough. Thus, different types and\nrelatively lower doses of ACEIs used in Japan may affect\nthe present consequence (no association between ACEI\nuse and CHF development). Therefore, additional studies\nare needed to clarify the effect of these drugs on CHF\ndevelopment, in patients with Stage 5 CKD in Japan.\nA recent meta-analysis revealed significant reduction of\nCHF by ACEIs in early-to-moderate CKD patients with\nincluded in this meta-analysis did not show a significant\nreduction by ACEIs, except for the HOPE study.41 This\nHOPE study evaluated ramipril efficacy on CVD, but ram-\nipril has not been approved in Japan. Thus, the results of\nthe present study (ACEIs have non-significant reduction\nof CHF) are not inconsistent with previous studies. Though\nTable 3.

The present study revealed the possible\nprevention of dialysis-requiring CHF by ARBs, in CKD\nStage 5 Japanese patients.\nUnfortunately, the molecular mechanisms responsible\nfor ARB-related prevention of CHF are poorly under-\nstood. In the context of tissue protection, blockade of the\nrenin-angiotensin system using ACEIs or ARBs can pre-\nvent or reverse endothelial dysfunction and atherosclero-\nsis, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular events.45\nOne possible explanation is that angiotensin-II may\nincrease the permeability of the lung vessels,46 while\nanother report suggests that angiotensin-II directly\ninduces heart failure in a mouse model of heart failure.47\nThus, it is possible that ARB use may reduce the risk of\nCHF via these mechanisms.\nRecently, a large clinical trial involving 20,854 patients\nrevealed the proportion of the patients with CHF at the ini-\ntiation of dialysis was 19.8%, in Japan.48 This prevalence\nrate was similar to our present data (20.1%); which is a rela-\ntively lower frequency, compared to both Canada (31%)49\nand USA (30.7% in the CKD without diabetes group and\nThere was a significant trend for a stepwise increase in\nthe prevalence of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to\n< 55%, corresponding to the advancement in the patients\nwith diabetes kidney disease from CKD Stage 3 to Stage\n5.51 The percentage of LVEF in CKD patients is reported as\ncompared with Stage 3),52 suggesting a stepwise increase in\nthe risk for CHF that corresponds to the stage of advance-\nment of CKD.\nOur present study also confirmed that loop diuretic users\ntended to start dialysis, due to CHF development.

Furthermore, there was no significant difference in\nthe use of loop diuretics between ARB users and non-users,\nsuggesting that ARB non-users did not contain the patients\nwith an edematous condition whom easily developed CHF.\nIn dialysis patients, CHF development is reported to be\nassociated with diabetes mellitus,33 a history of IHD,49\nanemia,49 hypoalbuminemia,49 and higher levels of\nthese factors are associated with CHF development in non-\ndialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD; however, we\ndid not observe any significant differences regarding the\nhistory of IHD, or hemoglobin, eGFR, albumin or CRP\nlevels, when comparing theARB user and non-user groups.\nThis absence of significant differences supports the con-\nclusion that these factors are independent risk factors for\nCHF development.\nThere are several limitations in this study:\n1. The present study used a cross-sectional design,\nand we do not have any information regarding the\ntypes, dosage and duration of each medication;\n2. We had no data from the echocardiography, such as\nleft ventricular ejection fraction;\n3. The low frequency of use for several medications\n(e.g. ACEI, VDRA, CaCO3\nhave decreased the sensitivity of our statistical\nanalysis; and\n4. Finally, we did not analyze the patients' lipid pro-\nfiles or use of statins and other lipid-lowering\ndrugs, as this information was not consistently\navailable.\nConclusion\nWe found that ARB use during the pre-dialysis period is\nassociated with a lower prevalence of CHF in non-dialysis\nJapanese patients with Stage 5 CKD, suggesting ARB may\nprovide a possible prevention of dialysis-requiring CHF in\nnon-dialysis Japanese patients with Stage 5 CKD; how-\never, well-controlled prospective studies are needed to\nconfirm our results, given the present study's cross-sec-\ntional design.\nFigure 3.
