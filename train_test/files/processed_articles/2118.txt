Design and\nmethods: Men and women aged 55\u00ad74 from the\nNational Study of Daily Experiences (N = 268;\nSurvey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), com-\npleted telephone interviews regarding their daily\nexperiences across 8 consecutive evenings. Results:\nWorking women spent more than double the amount\nof time on daily household chores than working\nmen. Unmarried retirees spent the most time on daily\nhousehold chores in comparison to their counterparts.\nThere was a trend toward significance for the associa-\ntion between home stressors from the previous day\nand time spent on daily household chores as a function\nof employment and marital status. Implications: These\nfindings highlight the importance of gender and marital\nstatus in the associations between employment status\nand time spent on daily household chores and the\nrole that daily stressors, in particular home stressful\nevents, have on daily household chore participation.\nThe transition from paid work to retirement\nmay represent the opportunity to be relieved of the\npsychological and physical stressors associated\nwith employment. Retirement has been linked to\nan improvement in well-being (e.g., increased pos-\nitive affect, lower levels of stress) and self-reported\nhealth behaviors (e.g., more regular exercise; Mein,\nMartikainen, Hemingway, Stansfeld, & Marmot,\n2003; Midanik, Soghikian, Ransom, & Tekawa,\n1995). At the same time, retirement may pres-\nent challenges (Butterworth et al., 2006; Buxton,\nSingleton, & Melzer, 2005). Importantly, the tran-\nsition from paid work to retirement may lead to a\nrecalibration of one's time use in daily activities.\nThis paper contributes to the study of retirement\nand time use by examining how employment sta-\ntus and life course influences are associated with\ntime spent on daily household chores in a sample\nof midlife and older adults. Furthermore, this study\nexamines the influences of daily stressors in the\nassociation between employment status and life\ncourse influences (i.e., age, gender) on time spent\non daily household chores.\nDaily Time Spent on Household Chores\nThe nature of retirement differs from paid work\nin terms of expectations, opportunities, and chal-\nlenges, and thus employment status is expected to\ninfluence how individuals spend time in their daily\nlives. In 2010, employed persons in the United\nStates worked an average of 7.5 hr on the days they\nworked for pay (United States Bureau of Labor\nThe Effects of Employment Status and Daily\nStressors on Time Spent on Daily Household\nChores in Middle-Aged and Older Adults\nJen D.

In contrast to work, retirement\nmay free up time for individuals to participate in\nother activities. Retirees, especially those in good\nhealth, now may have more time to explore per-\nsonal and social interests. Research has shown that\nindividuals out of the labor force, as compared to\nemployed individuals, reported spending signifi-\ncantly more time in passive and active leisure activ-\nities (Krantz-Kent & Stewart, 2007; Rosenkoetter,\nGarris, & Engdahl, 2001). A particular area of\ninterest to researchers has been how individuals\nspend their time on household chores.\nMost of the household time use studies have\nfocused on working families with children in the\nhousehold (e.g., Lee & Waite, 2005; Manke, Seery,\nCrouter, & McHale, 1994). Although there have\nbeen studies that examined the effects of retirement on\nhousework participation (e.g., Solomon, Acock, &\ntends to focus on married couples and the influ-\nences of gender roles and ideologies (e.g., Solomon\n1994); thereby limiting the generalizability of\nfindings. Overlooked in this area of research is how\nretirement is embedded in layers of temporal and\nsocial contexts that shape daily behaviors. By under-\nstanding how different temporal and social contexts\n(e.g., daily stress, age, gender, martial status) shape\ntime spent on daily household chores in a sample\nof workers and retirees in midlife and old age, we\nwill ultimately be able to better understand family\ndynamics and processes under a wider context.\nDaily Stress\nLacking in the retirement and household time\nuse literature is the influence of daily stress in the\nassociations between retirement and time spent on\ndaily household chores. The change in social role\nfrom worker to retiree may be advantageous in\nthat individuals no longer have to experience the\nchallenges associated with the work environment.\nFor others, the shift from work to retirement may\nbe negative. Because changes in one's social role\nmay entail possible transformations in identities,\nactivities, and environment (George, 1993), the\nshift from worker to retiree may increase or decrease\none's vulnerability to stressors and the stress\nresponses in their daily experiences.\nDaily stressors are the routine challenges of\nday-to-day living, such as having arguments with a\nfamily member, car breaking down, or experiencing\na broken dishwashing machine (Almeida, 2005).\nDaily stressors occur more frequently and unex-\npectedly than major life events and can disrupt\ndaily life (Almeida, 2005). These interruptions\nhave immediate negative impacts on psychological\nand physical functioning (Almeida, Wethington, &\nKessler, 2002; Bolger, DeLongis, Kessler, &\nSchilling, 1989). Consequently, daily stressors can\npile up over a series of days, which may result in\nmore detrimental stress reactions (e.g., anxiety,\ndaily stressors are likely to have immediate impacts\nthat disrupt day-to-day living, we expect that\ndaily stressors will deplete time spent on daily\nhousehold chores. In this study, we examine how\ndaily stressors shape the associations between\nemployment status and daily household chore\nparticipation.\nLife Course Daily Stress Perspective\nThe present paper views retirement as a transi-\ntion within the context of life course development\nby utilizing a Life Course Daily Stress perspective\n(LCDS; Almeida & Wong, 2009). According to\nthis perspective, daily stress processes may be pre-\ncipitated by life transitions. It is during the period\nof uncertainty that stress tends to be higher, and\ntransitions often involve a transformation of mul-\ntiple domains of responsibilities. Life transitions\nmay occupy an important role in daily stressor\nreactivity. Stressor reactivity is the likelihood that\nan individual will react emotionally or physically\nto daily stressors (Almeida, 2005). How an indi-\nvidual will react to daily stressors also depends on\nthe individual's resilience or vulnerability. The\nresources of an individual as well as his/her envi-\nronments (e.g., age, gender, marital status) can\nlimit or enhance the possibilities and opportunities\nfor coping with daily experiences (Lazarus, 1999).\nDepending on these resources, reactivity to stress-\nors, therefore, is likely to differ across people and\nsituations (Almeida, 2005). The emotional and\nphysical impacts of minor day-to-day stressors may\nbe magnified in the context of a major life transition\nsuch as retirement.\nThe goals for this paper are twofold. First, we\nare interested in how employment status (worker\nvs. retiree) and life course influences (age, gender,\nand marital status) are associated with time spent\non daily household chores (hypotheses are\ndescribed subsequently). Second, we build upon\nthe stressor reactivity concept to include behavioral\nreactivity to daily stressors by examining whether\nthe associations between daily stressors and time\nspent on daily household chores differ as a function\nof employment status and life course influences.\nWe predict that time spent on daily household\nchores will decrease on stressor days as compared\nto days without stressors, and these associations\nwill differ as a function of employment status and\nlife course influences. To better interpret the direc-\ntionality of the effects of daily stressors on time\nspent on daily household chores, we focused on\ndaily stressors from the previous day.\nLife Course Factors\nAge.--Depending on when a transition occurs,\nthe meaning of the transition varies and affects\nindividuals differently (Wheaton, 1990). The study\nof retirement and daily experiences must not ignore\nthe consideration of timing, as assessed by age. We\npredict that younger workers, in comparison to\ntheir counterparts, will spend the least amount of\ntime on daily household chores because of occupa-\ntion of more social roles (Lachman & James, 1997)\nand greater time restriction due to paid work.\nPast studies have shown that younger individuals\nare more emotionally and physically reactive\nto daily stressors than older individuals (Birditt,\nFingerman, & Almeida, 2005; Neupert, Almeida, &\nCharles, 2007), for younger individuals may have\nless effective cognitive resources to regulate their\nemotions and manage their physical reactions. In\nline with these findings, we predict that younger\nindividuals in our study will be more behaviorally\nreactive to daily stressors in their time spent on\ndaily household chores than older individuals. We\nalso predict that younger workers, who may be\nless cognitively mature than older individuals and\nface greater demands than retirees, will exhibit\ngreater behavioral reactions to daily stressors than\ntheir counterparts.\nGender.--Another important life course influ-\nence in shaping employment and daily household\nchore participation is gender. Despite that there\nare more women in the U.S. labor force than the\n1970s (United States Bureau of Labor Statistics,\n2011b; Institute for Women's Policy Research,\n2009), there continues to be evidence documenting\nthat women perform the majority of household\ntasks (Bianchi, Milkie, Sayer, & Robinson, 2000;\nColtrane, 2000). While men are carrying out\nhousehold tasks, the tasks tend to be less routine\nand frequent in nature (e.g., mowing the lawn)\nthan those performed by women (e.g., cooking;\nColtrane, 2000). Of the studies that examined the\neffects of retirement on housework participation\n(e.g.,Solomonetal.,2004),findingsgenerallyshowed\nthat women continue to carry out the majority of the\nresponsibilities. Based on previous literature, we\npredict that women, regardless of employment sta-\ntus, will report the greatest amount of time spent\non daily household chores. We also hypothesize that\nretired men, now with more time availability, will\nreport more time performing daily household chores\nthan workingmen. For our stress reactivity hypoth-\nesis, we predict that women, especially those working,\nwill exhibit the greatest reactivity than their coun-\nterparts because past studies have documented\nwomen experience stressors more negatively than\nMarital Status.--Marital status plays an impor-\ntant role in shaping retirement transition (Kim &\nsafeguard and buffer individuals, especially women,\nfrom financial insecurity by offering another ave-\nnue of access to financial resources (e.g., husband's\npension; Pienta, Hayward, & Jenkins, 2000),\nwhich can better prepare individuals for retirement\nand help ease the retirement experiences. The\nimportance of marital transitions on housework\nperformance has been documented in previous\nstudies (e.g., Gupta, 1999). In this study, we pre-\ndict that unmarried workers will spend the least\namount of time on daily household chores because\nof the absence of a spouse to share the daily house-\nhold responsibilities as well as the greater time\nrestriction associated with employment. Similarly,\nwe predict unmarried workers will be the most\nreactive to daily stressors with respect to time spent\non daily household chores.\nCurrent Study\nThe decision to retire or work is a self-sorting\nprocess based on push and pull factors, including\nhealth problems (Szinovacz & Davey, 2005) and\nfinances (Pienta & Hayward, 2002). Although the\ndata in this study does not allow for the examina-\ntion of reasons for work or retirement, this study\ntries to account for differences (e.g., functional\nlimitations, finances) that might exist between\nworkers and retirees. The data in this study was\ncollected during the mid- and late-1990s in the\nUnited States. Unlike the years before and after,\nthe mid- and late-1990s was free of recession and\n84 The Gerontologist\nThe Gerontologist\na period of economic growth. Data from this time\nperiod can provide insights to the daily retirement\nexperiences when the economic climate of the\nUnited States was relatively stable. In summary,\nthe current paper examines how employment sta-\ntus (worker vs. retiree) and life course influences\n(age, gender, and marital status) are associated\nwith time spent on daily household chores in a\nsample of midlife and older individuals. This study\nalso assesses whether the associations between\ndaily stressors from the previous day and time spent\non daily household chores differ as a function of\nemployment status and life course influences.\nDesign and Methods\nSample and Procedure\nThe current study utilized data from the first\nwave of National Study of Daily Experiences\n(NSDE), which is the daily diary portion of the\nNational Survey of Midlife in the United States\n(MIDUS). Respondents in the NSDE randomly\nwere selected from the MIDUS sample of 3,032\nrespondents completed telephone interviews\nabout daily time use, stressors, positive events,\nand physical symptoms over eight consecutive eve-\nnings. Data collection spanned from March 1996\nFor this study, respondents were selected based\non several criteria. Respondents must have valid\nemployment status response. Of the 1,031 respon-\ndents, 880 met this criterion. Age has been associ-\nated with the likelihood to work (i.e., younger\nindividuals are more likely to work; older individ-\nuals are more likely to retire); therefore, this study\nlimited the respondents to age 55\u00ad74. This age\nrange also reflected the most even distribution\nof workers and retirees. Of the 880 respondents,\n276 met the age criterion. Children in the house-\nhold may contribute to financial obligations and\nincrease opportunities for time spent on daily house-\nhold chores and stressor exposure. Eight respon-\ndents (all workers) with children under age 18 in\nthe household were excluded. Final sample size for\ndents, we started with an initial sample of 2,144 days.\nWe dropped days when respondents had missing\ndata for the time-varying predictors/covariates. Our\nfinal sample consisted of 268 respondents with\nPresented in Table 1 are the demographic charac-\nteristics of the respondents by employment status.\nWorkers were significantly younger than retirees.\nAmong the workers, there were more women\nthan men, whereas, the sample of retirees was\ncomprised of more men. Although this sample of\nworkers and retirees significantly did not vary\nby marital status, race or education, they dif-\nfered by functional limitations and total house-\nhold income with workers reporting fewer health\nlimits and higher household income (M = 1.65;\nMeasures\nTime Spent on Daily Household Chores.--On\neach study day, respondents reported the amount\nof time (in hours and minutes) that they spent on\nhousehold chores during the previous 24 hr.\nRespondents were instructed not to include time\nspent on paid work, volunteer work, or taking\ncare of children in their response. On average,\nhousehold chores.\nEmployment Status.--Respondents reported their\nemployment status using, \"What is your current\nTable 1. Demographic Characteristics by\nEmployment Status\nWorkers\nRetirees\nAge\nGender (%)\nRace (%)\nMarital status (%)\nEducation (%)\nFunctional limitations\nTotal household\nincome (logged)\nemployment situation?\". Instructed to select all\nthat applied, respondents indicated yes, no, or do\nnot know to the following options: working now,\nself-employed, unemployed, temporarily laid off,\nretired, homemaker, full-time student, and part-time\nstudent. Do not know responses were eliminated.\nIn an attempt to have a mutually exclusive concep-\ntualization of employment status, conflicting employ-\nment status responses (e.g., working now and\nretired) were excluded. This study comprised of\nAge and Gender.--Age was included as a\ncontinuous variable centered at the sample mean\nMarital Status.--Respondents reported their\nmarital status using the following options: married,\nseparated, divorced, widowed, or never married.\nThe small percentage of respondents in the non-\nmarried categories resulted in a contrast between\nmarried (1) and unmarried (0).\nDaily Stressors.--The Daily Inventory of Stress-\nful Events (DISE; Almeida et al., 2002) was used to\nassess daily stressors on each study day. The inven-\ntory consisted of a series of stem questions for\nidentifying whether seven types of stressful events\n(arguments or disagreements, avoided arguments\nand tensions, home, work, network, discrimina-\ntion, and other) had occurred in the past 24 hr. For\neach of the seven stressful events, respondents\nreceived a score of 1 if a stressor was reported and\na score of 0 if no stressor was reported. We\nexcluded work stressors from our analyses because\nwork stressors are incomparable for the two groups.\nFrom the six types of stressful events, we created an\n\"any stressor\" variable, which represented whether\na respondent experienced any of the six stressful\nevents on each study day (1 = at least one stressor,\n0 = no stressor). We focused on daily stressors\nfrom the previous day to better interpret the direc-\ntionality of the effects of daily stressors on time\nspent on daily household chores.\nControl Variables.--To account for potential\nhealth influences that may differ between workers\nand retirees, functional health was included.\nRespondents reported how much their health limits\nthem when performing the following six activities:\nlifting or carrying groceries; bathing or dressing\noneself; climbing several flights of stairs; bending,\nkneeling, or stooping; walking several blocks; and\nwalking one block (see Greenfield & Marks,\n2009). Respondents who rated that their health\nlimited them to any extent on a given activity were\ncoded 1, and those reported that their health did\nnot limit them were coded 0. The scores across the\nsix items were summed, and the Cronbach's alpha\nwas .84. Initial analysis demonstrated income dif-\nferences between workers and retirees; therefore,\ntotal household income (logged) was included as a\ncontrol. Differences in time spent on household\nchores also may differ as a function of day of the\nweek (e.g., Manke et al., 1994). In this study, day\nof the week was recoded into a contrast between\nweekday (0) and weekend (1). Approximately,\n76.11% of the telephone interviews occurred on a\nweekday.\nData Analyses Plan\nA set of two-level multilevel linear models (SAS\nProc Mixed), where days nested within persons,\nexamined the extent to which employment status\n(worker vs. retiree) predicted time spent on daily\nhousehold chores. In the first set of multilevel\nmodels, we assessed the main effects of employ-\nment status and life course influences (age, gender,\nand marital status) on time spent on daily house-\nhold chores. We then examined the two-way inter-\naction effect of employment status and life course\ninfluences (e.g., employment status and gender) on\ntime spent on daily household chores. In the sec-\nond set of analyses, we assessed the within-person\nresponse between daily stressors and time spent on\ndaily household chores, as a function of employ-\nment status and life course influences. For these\nanalyses, we focused on daily stressors from the\nprevious day to predict time spent on daily house-\nhold chores the following day. All continuous vari-\nables at Level 2 (between-person) were grand-mean\ncentered, and control variables were included in all\nmodels.\nResults\nTable 2 presents the descriptive characteristics\nof the stressful events by employment status.\nWorkers reported experiencing at least one daily\nstressor on 28% of the study days, which was\ncomparable to the 27% reported by retirees.\nAlthough workers and retirees did not differ in\ntheir reporting of arguments or disagreements,\navoided arguments or tensions, home stressors,\n86 The Gerontologist\nThe Gerontologist\nnetwork stressors, or other stressors, the two groups\ndiffered with respect to discrimination events (p <\n.05). Workers reported experiencing more discrim-\ninating events than retirees on greater percentage\nof the study days.\nPrior to conducting our multilevel linear models,\nwe examined the distribution of time spent on\ndaily household chores. In our sample, time spent\non daily household chores was positively skewed.\ndays), respondents reported time spent on daily\nhousehold chores two standard deviations (SD)\nabove the sample mean. In the effort to address\nthe positively skewed nature of chore estimates,\nwe utilized two methodological approaches. First,\nwe log-transformed time spent on daily household\nchores. We also performed sensitivity analyses using\nrobust standard error (SE) estimation (empirical\noption in SAS model statement). Results from our\nmultilevel linear models using log-transformed\nchore scores as well as robust SE estimation did\nnot differ from our findings using the raw chore\nscores. Thus, the results using raw chore scores are\npresented.\nIn the first set of multilevel linear models, the\neffects of employment status, age, gender, and\nmarital status on time spent on daily household\nchores were examined. As presented in Table 3\n(Model 1), there was a main effect of employment\nstatus on time spent on daily household chores\nwith workers spending 27 min less on daily house-\nhold chores than retirees (estimate = -0.446, SE =\nobserved with women spending 52 min more on\ndaily household chores than men (estimate = 0.861,\nWe then examined the two-way interaction effect\nof employment status and life course influences on\ntime spent on daily household chores (see Table 3,\nModel 2). There was a significant employment\nTable 2.

Working men spent the\nleast amount of time on daily household chores as\ncompared to working women and retirees, regard-\nless of gender. Working men spent approximately\n1 hr 13 min on daily household chores whereas\nworking women spent about 2 hr 37 min. In com-\nparison to workers, the difference in time spent on\ndaily household chores between retired men (2 hr\nThere also was an interaction effect of employ-\nment and marital status on time spent on daily\np  .01; see Figure 2). Unmarried workers reported\nfewer hours spent on daily household chores\nAmong the retirees, marital status had less of an\ninfluence on time spent on daily household chores.\nUnmarried retirees reported approximately 2 hr 41\nmin on daily household chores; whereas married\nretirees reported 2 hr 20 min.\nIn the second set of analyses, we examined\nwhether the associations between daily stressors\nfrom the previous day and time spent on daily\nhousehold chores differed as a function of employ-\nment status and life course influences. In these\nmodels, the dichotomous daily stressor effect\nreflected the extent to which one's time spent on\ndaily household chores changed as a function of\nwhether individuals reported experiencing any\ndaily stressors the previous day. Any daily stressors\nfrom the previous day, employment status, age,\ngender, marital status, and their interactions, were\nentered as predictors of time spent on daily house-\nhold chores (see Table 4, Model 1). There was a\ntrend toward significance (estimate = 0.847, SE =\ndaily stressors from the previous day and time\nspent on daily household chores as a function of\nemployment and marital status. Contrary to pre-\ndiction, results showed that time spent on daily\nhousehold chores increased on days when one\nreported experiencing at least one daily stressor as\ncompared to days when no stressors were reported.\nFindings also revealed that unmarried workers\nexhibited the least reactivity and unmarried retirees\nexhibited the greatest reactivity to daily stressors\nwith respect to time spent on daily household\nchores. In this set of analyses, daily stressor was an\nindex of any of the seven types of stressful events\n(e.g., arguments or disagreements, avoided argu-\nments and tensions, home-related, discrimination)\nexperienced on a study day. In line with the work\nof Clark-Plaskie, & Lachman (1999), who found\nthat the salience of stressor domains may vary\nacross adulthood, we were interested in whether a\nspecific stressor domain (e.g., arguments or dis-\nagreements, home) may better explain the observed\nassociation. We carried out a similar set of analyses\nas previously for each type of stressful event. Results\nshowed a trend toward significance (estimate =\nprevious day and time spent on daily household\nchores as a function of employment and marital\nstatus (see Table 4, Model 2). We observed that,\nfor all groups, time spent on daily household\nRetirees\nWorkers\nMen\nWomen\nFigure 1.

This study\nextended prior retirement and housework litera-\nture by examining the influences of daily stress in\nthe associations between retirement and time spent\non daily household chores.\nFindings from this study highlight the influence\nof age in the association between employment sta-\ntus and household chore participation. Especially\nfor younger workers, employment had a greater\ninfluence on time spent on daily household chores\nas compared to other groups. As hypothesized, our\nsample of younger workers reported the least\namount of time spent on daily household chores.\nWe also found that younger retirees reported per-\nforming the greatest amount of daily household\nchores of all groups. These findings resonate with\nthe time availability theory (Blood & Wolfe, 1960)\nsuch that younger workers may face greater time\ndemands; and therefore, must reduce their invest-\nment in daily household chores. In contrast, youn-\nger retirees, now with greater time flexibility and\navailability due to retirement, may contribute\nmore to daily household chores. For older workers\nand retirees, whose time spent on daily household\nchores was more similar; employment had less of\nan impact.\nResults from this study reinforce the importance\nof gender on household chore participation. In line\nwith past research that demonstrated women per-\nform more of the housework than men (Bianchi\nLachance-Grzela & Bouchard, 2010), findings\nfrom this study showed that working women spent\nmore than double the amount of time on daily\nhousehold chores than working men. Notably,\nretirement does not offer women a reprieve from\ndaily household chores because both working and\nTable 4. Multilevel Models of Employment Status and Stressor (Previous Day) Predicting Time Spent on Daily\nHousehold Chores\nAny stressor-previous day\nHome stressor-previous day\nFixed effects\nPerson-level predictors\nDay-level predictors\nCross-level interaction effects\nRandom effects (variance component)\nretired women reported spending a similar amount\nof time. Similar to past studies (e.g., Solomon et\nal., 2004) our findings revealed that retired men\npick up more daily household responsibilities, per-\nhaps due to greater time availability of no longer\nhaving to work. Although the retired women in\nour study still performed more of the daily house-\nhold chores, retired men were not far behind.\nThese findings suggest that gender disparity in\ntime spent on household chores may lessen in\nretirement.\nIn this study, social embeddedness, as assessed\nby marital status, was found to be an important\nfactor in shaping household chore participation.\nEspecially for unmarried workers, the combina-\ntion of not having a partner to share the division\nof labor and paid work may explain the least\namount of time allocated toward daily household\nchores. Retirement, however, appears to offer\nunmarried individuals more opportunities for\ndaily chore participation. In contrast, employ-\nment status seems to have less of an influence on\ndaily household chore participation for married\nindividuals because both married workers and\nretirees reported a similar amount of time. It\ncould be that the day-to-day household responsi-\nbilities of married individuals are more well\nestablished and less changeable even in the face of\na retirement transition.\nIn the second part of this paper, we built upon\nthe stressor reactivity concept to include behavioral\nreactivity to daily stressors by assessing whether\nthe associations between daily stressors and time\nspent on daily household chores differed as a func-\ntion of employment status and life course influences.\nContrary to expectation, workers and retirees'\ntime spent on daily household chores increased the\nday after experiencing a stressful event. This find-\ning highlights the impacts and disruptions that\ndaily stressors have on one's life (Almeida, 2005;\nBolger et al., 1989) and illustrates how daily stress-\nors can pile up and result in behavioral reactions\neven the day after experiencing the stressful events\nOur stressor reactivity findings also indicate\nthat the salience of stressor domains may operate\ndifferently depending on individuals' resources\n(Clark-Plaskie & Lachman, 1999). In our study,\nwe found that of the seven domains of stressful\nevents (e.g., arguments or disagreements, network\nstressors), only home stressful events were associ-\nated with daily household chore participation at a\ntrend level. These findings highlight the differen-\ntial effects that different types of stressors have\non daily experiences. For these analyses, we also\npredicted that unmarried workers will be the\nmost reactive to daily stressors in household chore\nparticipation; however, our prediction was not\nsupported. Instead, unmarried workers were the\nleast reactive. It could be that when faced with\nstressful events at home, unmarried workers, who\nmay not have someone to share the daily home\nresponsibilities and whose time is more restricted\nby employment, may be more likely to let next\nday's household responsibilities slide than other\nindividuals. However, caution must be taken when\ninterpreting the findings given that the results were\nat a trend level.\nCollectively, these findings highlight the impor-\ntance of life course influences in understanding the\nopportunities and vulnerabilities that middle-aged\nand older workers and retirees face in their daily\nlives. These findings further illustrate that life tran-\nsitions (e.g., retirement), and daily stressors are\nembedded in layers of temporal and social contexts\nthat shape individual's behaviors. Our findings\nalso highlight the opportunity for future studies to\nexamine how life course influences, daily stress,\nand daily household chore participation may shape,\nor are shaped by, family dynamics and processes at\ndifferent parts of the life course (e.g., employment,\nretirement). Through the better understanding of\nfamily dynamics and processes in middle and old\nage, we will be able to devise and advocate for\neffective strategies and programs that will help\nindividuals and families to better balance daily\nhousehold responsibilities as well as to enhance\nmeaningful use of time. Our findings also point to\nthe need to examine individuals' coping strategies\nin the face of stressful events. It also would be\nimportant in subsequent studies to assess how pro-\ntective factors (e.g., social support, psychological\nwell being) may influence individual's behavioral\nreactivity to daily stressors.\nLimitations and Strengths\nOne study limitation is that we did not have\ninformation on reasons for employment. Although\nwe tried to account for potential push and pull fac-\ntors that may differ between the workers and\nretirees, we cannot completely rule out the factors\nthat may have contributed to the current employ-\nment situation. This study utilized a self-definition\nof employment status, which is limited by the lack\nof objective criteria in identifying whether one is\n90 The Gerontologist\nThe Gerontologist\nworking or retired. However, perceptions often\ninfluence behaviors (e.g., Ferguson & Bargh,\n2004), and a self-assessment of employment status\nmay provide better insight to how individuals\nthink or behave. Future studies should consider\nwhether different conceptualization of retirement\nresults in similar findings. Spousal characteristics\n(e.g., employment, gender attitudes) have been\nlinked to household performance (Szinovacz,\n2000); however, the current study did not utilize\nspousal data due to sample size and missing data\nissues. This study focused on both married and\nunmarried respondents to better understand and\nrepresent the daily experiences of midlife and older\nworkers and retirees. Generalizability of the findings\nmust take into account that participants in this\nstudy predominately were white. Given the role\nof race and ethnicity in patterning employment\ntrajectories (Cummings & Jackson, 2008), we will\nhave the opportunity in subsequent studies to better\nunderstand the daily lives of African Americans, for\nthere was an oversample of African Americans at\nWave 2 of MIDUS.\nThis study has several strengths. Rather than\nasking respondents to recall the number of hours\nin the past week that they spent doing household\ndents in this study reported the amount of time\nspent on household chores in the past 24 hr over 8\nconsecutive days. This methodological approach\nhelps to reduce bias between an experience and the\nrecall of the experience (Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli,\n2003). The use of daily diary methodology enabled\nus to better capture the temporal order effects of\ndaily stressors on household chore participation\nthe following day. Although the DISE measure\nallows for the examination of different stressor\ndomains (e.g., arguments, avoided arguments,\nhome related) experienced by the respondents, it\ndoes not define the events that constitute each\ndomain of stressors. A limitation to this approach\nis that the stressful event may differ between and\nwithin (across days) individuals. However, this\napproach is advantageous in capturing the events\nthat the respondents, not the researchers, perceived\nas stressful. In contrast to other housework studies\nrent study does not define specific activities that\nconstitute household chores. Although this meth-\nodology may be less structured, this approach is\nmore informative in capturing the daily responsi-\nbilities and tasks carried out by workers and\nretirees.\nConclusion\nIn summary, the changing nature of work and\nretirement in the United States points to the need to\nexamine how employment shapes daily experiences.\nImportantly, findings from this study highlight the\nneed to pay greater attention to women, especially\nthose working, who are facing greater daily house-\nhold responsibilities than other individuals. Our\nstudy further contributes to the retirement and\ntime use literature by documenting the importance\nof life course influences as well as stressors on daily\nexperiences.\nFunding\nSupport was provided by the National Institute of Health Grants P01\nDevelopment of the John D. and Catherine T.
