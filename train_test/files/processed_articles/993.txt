In the present\n1995\u00ad1997 cross-sectional study, the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation, the relation of demographic\nand lifestyle factors to age at natural menopause was examined in seven US centers and five racial/ethnic\ngroups.

Age at the natural final men-\nstrual period may be an important risk indicator for subse-\nquent morbidity and mortality. The risks of cardiovascular\ndisease (2\u00ad4) and osteoporosis (5) tend to be higher for\nwomen with an earlier menopause, but women who experi-\nence an earlier menopause are protected against breast can-\ncer (6). One possible explanation for these effects is the\nduration of exposure to high circulating estrogen levels,\nwhich could produce distinct outcomes based on the relation\nbetween estrogen and the particular disease.\nAge at natural menopause has also been related to all-cause\nmortality. In one US population-based study, women who\nexperienced nonsurgical menopause prior to age 40 years had\na 50 percent higher mortality rate than those reporting\nmenopause at age 50 years or older (4). Women whose non-\nsurgical menopause occurred between ages 40 and 50 years\nhad no increased mortality compared with those whose\nmenopause occurred at an older age. Another community-\nbased cohort study reported a 95 percent increase in all-cause\nmortality associated with nonsurgical menopause occurring\nbefore age 40 years compared with menopause at age 50 years\nor older (2). However, women aged 40\u00ad49 years at menopause\nwere also at a 35 percent higher risk of mortality compared\nwith women aged 50 years or older at natural menopause.\nSeveral complex causes may underlie the observed relation\nbetween earlier age at menopause and mortality, including\ngenetic factors, behavioral and environmental exposures, hor-\nmonal mechanisms, and health-related factors. Understanding\nthe associations of these factors with age at natural menopause\nmay help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relation\nof age at menopause to morbidity and mortality.\nMost estimates of age at natural menopause are based on\nsamples of Caucasian women in western societies, although\nfound the median age at natural menopause to be 50 years\n(range, 49\u00ad52 years) (7). A few studies of non-Caucasian\nwomen, conducted primarily outside the United States, have\nreported younger ages at menopause than those for\nCaucasian women. The better-designed studies suggest that\nof Mexican descent (12) have an earlier age at menopause\nthan Caucasian women do, while Japanese (13) and\nMalaysian (14) women report a median age at menopause\nsimilar to that for women of European descent.\nThe most consistent finding regarding behavioral factors\nhas been that for smokers, menopause occurs 1\u00ad2 years ear-\ntency, studies have found that an earlier natural menopause\nis also associated with less education (20, 21), low social\nlow relative weight (18, 26). Being on a weight reduction\ndiet has also been associated with earlier menopause (10).\nMost of these factors may affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-\ngonadal axis and its regulation of gonadotropins and sex\nsteroid hormones.\nMany prior studies have not had sufficiently large sample\nsizes to provide stable estimates of age at menopause (10,\n27), did not control statistically for confounding variables,\nor used inappropriate statistical techniques. In the present\nstudy, we analyzed data from a large, multicenter study\n(Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN)) of a\nmultiracial/multiethnic sample of women to examine the\nindependent association of a number of factors with age at\nnatural menopause by using multivariate survival statistical\ntechniques to adjust simultaneously for the effects of multi-\nple factors.\nStudy participants\nThe design and sampling strategy of SWAN have been\ndescribed in detail elsewhere (28). Briefly, the study is being\nconducted at seven US sites, each of which has recruited a\nsample of Caucasian women and women of one racial/\nethnic minority. The study sites are located in Boston,\nMassachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; the Detroit, Michigan,\narea; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Los Angeles, California;\nNewark, New Jersey; and the Oakland, California, area.\nFive racial/ethnic groups were recruited: African American\n(Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh), Caucasian (all sites),\nChinese (Oakland), Hispanic (Newark), and Japanese (Los\nAngeles).\nA two-stage recruitment process was used. First, during\ntelephone at most sites and in person for about half of the\nwomen at two sites (with African Americans as their minor-\nity sample), to assess eligibility for enrollment into a cohort\nstudy and to collect health, reproductive, demographic, and\nlifestyle data. Eligibility criteria for the cross-sectional sur-\nvey were as follows: age 40\u00ad55 years, self-designated as one\nof the targeted racial/ethnic groups for the site, residence\nnear one of the seven clinic sites, speaker of English or one\nof the other selected languages (Spanish, Japanese,\nCantonese), and able to give verbal consent. Community-\nbased sampling from established lists of populations at five\nsites and random digit dialing, combined with a \"snowball\"\napproach at two sites (28) (those with the Hispanic and\nJapanese minority samples), were used. In the snowball\ntechnique, women first identified by using a list-based or\nrandom-digit-dialing technique were asked for the names\nand contact information of other women who met the eligi-\nbility criteria; these women in turn were contacted, were\nscreened for eligibility, and were asked for the names of\nother appropriate women. This process continued until a\nsufficient number of eligible women was identified. In the\nsecond stage of the study, a longitudinal cohort was\nrecruited from those women screened and found eligible in\nthe cross-sectional survey. A total of 16,065 women partici-\npated in the cross-sectional survey, 3,150 of whom enrolled\nin the cohort study.\nData collection\nAssessment of the outcome (age at menopause).\nNatural menopause was defined according to the World\nHealth Organization (29) as at least 12 consecutive months\nof amenorrhea not due to surgery or other obvious cause,\nsuch as extreme weight loss. Women who reported that they\nhad had a hysterectomy or oophorectomy (unilateral vs.\nbilateral was not specified, since in pretests women could\nnot distinguish between the two) were asked the year of\nsurgery; age at surgery was computed by subtracting birth\nyear from the year of surgery. Women not reporting such\nsurgery were asked whether they had menstruated in the past\n12 months. Among those with 12 or more months of amen-\norrhea, women whose periods had not stopped because of\nsurgery, medical treatment, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or\nsevere weight loss were defined as naturally post-\nmenopausal (29). These women were asked in what year\ntheir last menstrual period had occurred; their year of birth\nwas subtracted from this year to obtain age at menopause.\nMenopausal status was defined as surgical amenorrhea if\nmenses had stopped as a result of hysterectomy and/or\noophorectomy, naturally postmenopausal if menses had\nstopped for at least 12 months without surgery, late peri-\nmenopause if menses had occurred in the past 12 months but\nnot in the last 3 months, early perimenopause if menses had\noccurred in the past 3 months but had become less pre-\ndictable, and premenopause if menses had occurred in the\npast 3 months with no decreased predictability.\nIndependent variables. All independent variables of\ninterest were obtained by self-report during the interview.\nIncluded were demographic factors (age, race/ethnicity, edu-\ncational attainment, employment, marital status, number of\nchildren, and ability to pay for basics, i.e., food, shelter, cloth-\ning, and heat), lifestyle factors (smoking, physical activity),\nand health-related factors (height and weight (converted to\nbody mass index (BMI): weight in kilograms/height in\nmeters2), ever having been told by a health care provider that\nshe had heart disease, cancer, hypertension, or diabetes).\nPrimary race/ethnicity was self-defined as Black or\nAfrican American, non-Hispanic Caucasian, Chinese or\nChinese American, Japanese or Japanese American, or\nHispanic (Central American, Cuban or Cuban American,\nDominican, Mexican or Mexican American, Puerto Rican,\nSouth American, Spanish, or other Hispanic). Respondents\nCorrelates of Age at Menopause 867\ncould also specify \"other,\" \"mixed,\" or no primary ethnic\naffiliation. Since most extant literature regarding age at\nmenopause is based on non-Hispanic Caucasians, they were\nused as the reference group.\nCigarette smoking was categorized as never, former, or\ncurrent smoker and number of cigarettes currently smoked\nper day, based on modified American Thoracic Society\nquestions (30). Physical activity was assessed with one\nglobal question about activity level relative to other women\nof the respondent's age (31).\nData analyses\nApproach. Menstrual status groups were compared with\nrespect to key demographic, lifestyle, and health character-\nistics by using chi-square statistics. We performed bivariate\nKaplan-Meier survival analyses (32) and Cox proportional\nhazards regression analyses (33) to evaluate the relation of\ncategorical and of continuous variables, respectively, to age\nat menopause. Variables found in bivariate analyses to be\nrelated (p < 0.15), or suggested by previous literature to be\nrelated, to age at natural menopause were included in the\nmultivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses.\nExclusions. Women whose menstrual periods had\nstopped because of medication, radiotherapy, pregnancy or\nlactation, or extreme weight change (n  311) were\nexcluded from the present analyses. Also excluded were\nwomen whose data on current menstrual status (n  109) or\nwhose information on any covariate (n  1,141) was miss-\ning. Women who identified their primary race/ethnicity as\n\"mixed\" or \"other\" (n  1,694) constituted a heterogeneous\ngroup whose results could not be interpreted clearly and\nwere thus excluded. The remaining sample size used in this\nCox proportional hazards modeling. Cox proportional\nhazards models were estimated to assess associations of age\nat natural menopause with independent variables. Women\nnot currently using reproductive hormones who were not\nsurgically or naturally menopausal were censored at their\ncurrent age.\nWomen who had had a hysterectomy and/or oophorec-\ntomy (n  3,069) were censored at their age at surgery,\nsince surgery masks the age at which a woman would\nbecome menopausal in the absence of this surgery (34).\n(We did not have information on whether oophorectomy\nwas unilateral or bilateral.) We also conducted analyses by\nexcluding these women; the result was that overall age at\nmenopause was reduced by 0.4 years and all point esti-\nmates changed less than 10 percent (data not shown).\nIncluding these women and censoring them assumes that,\ngiven their covariate information, the distribution of their\n\"true\" age at natural menopause (which cannot be\nobserved) is the same as that for naturally menopausal\nwomen. Their inclusion is important because they are not\na random subsample of middle-aged women (35\u00ad40);\nexcluding them could lead to biased results. They also con-\nstitute a nonnegligible proportion of the population (41,\n42), and their data may be informative regarding the tim-\ning of natural menopause.\nWomen who had used hormones, including oral contra-\nceptives, in the past 3 months (\"current users,\" n  1,151)\nwere initially considered in two ways, first by excluding\nthem (10) and then by leaving them in the analysis and cen-\nsoring at the age computed by subtracting the total number\nof years of hormone use from their current age. The results\nof these two approaches did not differ, but the latter\napproach provided a slightly better model fit; thus, its results\nare presented in this paper. Data on women whose\nmenopause preceded hormone use were included as\nmenopausal events.\nContinuous variables (e.g., parity, BMI) were initially\nmaintained in multivariable models as continuous variables.\nFor ease of interpretation, this paper reports hazard ratios by\ncategories of these variables. For categorical variables, a\nconceptually logical referent level was selected for compar-\nison. All other levels of ordinal (e.g., educational level) vari-\nables were coded as dummy variables, rather than assuming\nrankings in the models.\nDummy indicator variables for field site were included in\nthe multivariable models (43). For each of the three\nracial/ethnic groups studied at a single site only (Chinese,\nHispanic, and Japanese), the coefficients reflect a direct\ncomparison with the Caucasians at the same site only.\nInteractions between site and race/ethnicity for these three\ngroups could not be estimated given the study design. Four\nsites interviewed African Americans and Caucasians,\nenabling us to examine interactions between race/ethnicity\nand site for these two racial/ethnic groups, that is, whether\nthe racial/ethnic difference in age at menopause varied\nacross these four sites. We also examined interaction terms\nfor smoking with race/ethnicity, BMI, history of use of oral\ncontraceptives, parity, education, employment, marital sta-\ntus, site, or history of heart disease. Goodness of fit of the\nmultivariate Cox models was assessed by using the link test\nRESULTS\nUnadjusted demographic, lifestyle, and health\ncharacteristics\nThe majority of women (57.7 percent) were still menstru-\nating. A much greater proportion of African Americans than\nall other racial/ethnic groups were surgically amenorrheic,\nthe highest proportion of women currently using hormones\nwere Caucasian, and the highest proportions of pre-\nmenopausal women were among Chinese and Japanese\nwomen (table 1). Higher educational level was associated\nwith being premenopausal and with current hormone use,\nwhile women with lower educational attainment were more\nlikely to have surgical amenorrhea. Women who had no dif-\nficulty paying for basics, were employed, were nonsmokers,\nor reported being more physically active than other women\nof their age were more likely to be premenopausal or to be\nusing hormones. Women who were single or married (or liv-\ning as married) were more likely to be premenopausal and\nless likely to be surgically amenorrheic, while widowed\nwomen were more likely to be post- or surgically meno-\npausal. Women with lower BMI were more likely to be pre-\nmenopausal, but women with higher BMI were more likely\nto be surgically amenorrheic. Women who had never used\noral contraceptives were more likely than ever users to be\npostmenopausal. A greater proportion of women who had\nhigh blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease were post- or\nsurgically menopausal than women without these condi-\ntions, although these data were difficult to interpret because\nof the cross-sectional design of this portion of the study.\nMultivariate associations of risk factors with age at\nnatural menopause\nThe overall multiply adjusted median age at natural\nmenopause was 51.4 years. Current smoking, lower educa-\ntional attainment, not being married, not being employed,\nand having a history of heart disease were all significantly,\nindependently associated with earlier natural menopause,\nwhile ever using oral contraceptives, being parous, and\nJapanese race/ethnicity were significantly, independently\nassociated with later age at natural menopause after adjust-\nment for site and each variable for all other important vari-\nables (table 2, figures 1\u00ad3). Hispanics had a significantly\nearlier menopause than Caucasians did (hazard ratio  1.16,\nnot included in the multivariate model. The effect of prior\nuse of oral contraceptives was also examined by duration of\nuse, and parity was examined by number of children; neither\nestimate changed (data not shown).\nInitial multivariate Cox proportional hazards models\nshowed no significant associations, after adjustment for\nother variables, of age at menopause with self-reported\nphysical activity, history of cancer (including breast cancer),\nTABLE 1.

Thus, these variables were excluded from\nthe final multivariate models. Age at menopause did not\nincrease with duration of prior use of oral contraceptives.\nClinic site was retained in the model, although not signifi-\ncantly associated with the outcome. Interaction terms for\nsmoking with other risk factors were not statistically signif-\nicant, nor were interactions between site and African-\nAmerican race/ethnicity (data not shown).\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, the overall median age at natural\nmenopause was found to be 51.4 years after adjustment for\nmultiple factors, which is comparable to previous reports\nour study demonstrated that Japanese women have a later\nnatural menopause than Caucasian, African-American,\nHispanic, or Chinese women do. Our results also confirm\nthose from previous studies showing that current smoking,\nlower educational attainment, and nonemployment were\nrelated to earlier age at natural menopause and that prior\nuse of oral contraceptives and parity were associated with\nlater age at menopause, as previously reported by some\nRace/ethnicity\nUnlike our study, prior studies have reported that age at\nmenopause for Japanese women was similar to that for\nwomen reported a median age at menopause of 50.4 years\n(13). Another study of 400 Malaysian women reported a\nsimilar median age at menopause of 50.7 years (14).\nsampled from Bangkok health centers in lower-middle\nsocioeconomic status areas, reported a median age at\nmenopause of 49.5 years (53). Filipino Malay women were\nreported to be an average age of 47\u00ad48 years at menopause\n(54), although the methods used in both of these latter stud-\nies may have biased their results toward lower estimates.\nTABLE 1.

For Mexican women, median ages at\nyears (22), although the latter study was based on only cur-\nrently menopausal women and was thus likely to underesti-\nmate median menopausal age. Peruvian and Mayan women,\ndespite their high parity, have also been reported to experi-\nence menopause earlier, ranging from age 45 to 47 years\nTwo previous studies also suggested that African-\nAmerican women experience menopause 6\u00ad12 months ear-\nlier than Caucasians, with a median age of 49.3 years for\nAfrican Americans in both studies (10, 11), in contrast to our\nstudy showing no difference between African Americans\nand Caucasians, possibly because of the age group of our\nsample or greater censoring of African Americans because\nof more surgical menopause. Studies in South Africa (8) and\nGhana (9) also reported an earlier age at menopause for\nAfrican compared with Caucasian women, but a small\nNigerian study reported the average age at menopause to be\nSmoking\nThe results of the present study add to a growing body of\nliterature showing that current, but not former, smoking is\nassociated with earlier age at natural menopause after\nadjustment for confounding factors. Women who smoke\nstop menstruating 1\u00ad2 years earlier than comparable non-\nshorter perimenopause (27). Some studies have reported\nthat heavy smokers have an earlier menopause than light\nresponse effect of smoking, consistent with at least one\nother study (19). Previous studies have shown that former\nsmokers have no or only a slightly earlier age at menopause\nthan never smokers (18, 19, 62), suggesting that the effect of\nsmoking may not be permanent, a finding inconsistent with\na toxic effect leading to atrophy of ovarian follicles.\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke are\ntoxic to ovarian follicles (63, 64) and could result in their\nloss and thus in earlier menopause in smokers. Greater\nprevalence of hysterectomy among premenopausal smokers\nthan nonsmokers (60, 65) does not account for the earlier\nmenopause in smokers (66).\nSocioeconomic status\nWe found that lower educational attainment and nonem-\nployment were significantly, independently associated with\nearlier age at menopause, although difficulty paying for\nbasics was not. Several previous studies indicate that lower\neducational attainment and/or socioeconomic status, often\ndetermined by occupational status of the woman or her hus-\nband, is associated with earlier age at menopause (15, 20,\n21, 50), although the findings are not wholly consistent (10).\nSocial and physical stress are also associated with amenor-\nrhea and reproductive dysfunction (67, 68), and low socio-\neconomic status or low educational level may be markers\nfor elevated stress.\nMarital status and parity\nIn our study, separated/divorced/widowed women had an\nearlier menopause than women who were married or were\nliving as married. For parous women, age at natural\nmenopause occurred significantly later than for nulliparous\nwomen, concurring with the results of most previous work\nTABLE 2.

Since onset of menopause is\ntheorized to be related to the rate of loss of oocytes and thus\nto the occurrence of ovulatory cycles (21, 23, 70), the pro-\nposed mechanism by which parity and use of oral contracep-\ntives may result in later age at natural menopause is by\nreducing ovulatory cycles earlier in life and thus preserving\noocytes longer, resulting in later menopause.\nOral contraceptive use\nWe found that prior use of oral contraceptives was asso-\nciated with earlier age at natural menopause, although no\nrelation with increasing duration of use was observed. This\nFIGURE 3. Adjusted proportional hazards of age at menopause, by educational attainment, for women in the Study of Women's Health Across\nthe Nation, United States, 1995\u00ad1997.

Although some studies\nhave observed that women with lower BMI had an earlier\nfirmed this finding (10). In primates and humans, caloric\nrestriction and nutritional deficiencies are associated with\namenorrhea (71\u00ad73). The production of estrone in adipose\ntissue, which is greater in more-obese women, may result in\nhigher levels of circulating estrogens that may contribute to\nlonger reproductive functioning. Obesity, however, has also\nbeen associated with inadequate ovarian function (74).\nHeart disease\nWe found that women who had heart disease were signif-\nicantly younger at natural menopause, consistent with prior\nreports showing a protective effect of later age at natural\nmenopause on heart disease morbidity and mortality (34,\n75). However, given the cross-sectional nature of our data,\nwe are uncertain whether natural menopause preceded a\ndiagnosis of heart disease. When we did not include this\nvariable in the multivariate model, none of the findings\nchanged more than 10 percent. Interestingly, 45 percent of\nthe women reporting heart disease had had a hysterectomy\nand/or oophorectomy, thus resulting in a high proportion of\ncensored women with this condition. Recent work (76)\nshows an estrogen receptor polymorphism to be associated\nwith earlier menopause and with surgical menopause.\nUnlike some (77, 78) but not all (79) studies, age at natural\nmenopause was not related to diabetes or to hypertension in\nour study.\nStrengths and limitations\nOur use of multivariate survival analyses (which included\nand censored women who were still menstruating, had sur-\ngical amenorrhea, or were currently using female hormones)\nenabled systematic examination of the relation of a number\nof independent variables to age at natural menopause.\nHowever, because of the limited time available for the cross-\nsectional interview, data were not collected on important\ndetails such as ages at which reproductive hormones were\nused and on other potentially important factors such as age\nat menarche, age at maternal or sibling menopause, history\nof long or short or irregular menstrual cycles, diet (such as\nconsumption of fat, cholesterol, meat, and phytoestrogens),\n81). All of these factors will be studied prospectively in the\nSWAN cohort, with results available within the next few\nyears. In addition, in the cross-sectional portion of SWAN,\nwe had recalled data on only the year of the final menstrual\nperiod and lacked knowledge regarding timing of the factors\nexamined relative to the final period. Furthermore, we had\ninformation on only the year of the final menstrual period\n(surgical or natural); thus, our estimates of age may have\nbeen inaccurate by up to 1 year, either older or younger, a\nsource of variability that will be reduced in the cohort por-\nCorrelates of Age at Menopause 873\ntion of SWAN. A final limitation is the varied sampling\nmethods used by the study sites, necessitated by difficulties\nin achieving the needed sample size of minority populations,\nmaking use of formal estimation procedures inappropriate.\nThus, the present confidence intervals should be interpreted\nwith caution.\nNonetheless, the present study is one of the largest, is\ncomprised of one of the most diverse study populations, and\nhas been analyzed by using the most comprehensive statis-\ntical methods. Thus, the findings regarding the relations\nwith race/ethnicity, current smoking, parity, use of oral con-\ntraceptives, educational attainment, and unemployment, and\nthe lack of association with BMI, are likely to be robust and\nsuggest that multifactorial host (possibly genetic) and envi-\nronmental factors are involved in a likely complex mecha-\nnism to determine onset of menopause.\n"
