However, the contributions of\nanthropometric, socioeconomic, nutritional, and environmental factors to this difference are unknown. From\nparticipants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988\u00ad1994), the authors selected\nAmerican children were taller and heavier but had lower lung function. African Americans were poorer and had\nlower levels of the antioxidant vitamins A and C and -carotene. The authors performed regression analyses\nusing data on anthropometric, socioeconomic, and nutritional factors and smoke exposure. Adjustment for sitting\nheight explained 42\u00ad53% of the racial difference. Socioeconomic factors and antioxidant vitamin levels\naccounted for an additional 7\u00ad10%. Overall, the authors could account for only 50\u00ad63% of the racial difference.\nExposure to tobacco in the home was weakly associated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second in girls,\naccounting for 1% of the difference. In children aged 8\u00ad12 years (n = 752), birth weight explained 3\u00ad5% of the\nracial difference, whereas in-utero exposure to maternal smoking had no significant effect. The authors conclude\nthat in healthy children, the major explanatory variable for the racial difference in lung function is body habitus;\nsocioeconomic, nutritional, and environmental confounders play a smaller role.\nanthropometry; antioxidants; continental population groups; reference values; respiratory function tests;\nsocioeconomic factors\nAbbreviations: FEV1\n, forced expiratory volume in 1 second; FVC, forced vital capacity; NHANES III, Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey.\nA difference in pulmonary function between Whites and\nAfrican Americans has been found in both children and\nadults (1\u00ad5). Hsi et al. (2) reported that the racial difference\nin spirometric lung volume between African-American and\nWhite children could be completely accounted for by the\nsmaller trunk:leg ratio of African Americans. However, race\nis confounded by other factors that are associated with lower\nlung function, including lower socioeconomic status (6, 7),\nobesity (8, 9), lower dietary intake of antioxidant vitamins\nRecently, we reported that the use of sitting height instead\nof standing height in adult data from the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)\nreduced the racial difference in lung volume between asymp-\ntomatic Whites and African Americans by 35\u00ad39 percent\n(19). Smaller proportions of the racial difference were\nexplained by differences in poverty, education, and body\nmass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2). Overall, we could\naccount for only half of the racial difference in forced expi-\nratory volume in 1 second (FEV1\n) and forced vital capacity\n(FVC).\nPoverty, nutrition, and exposure to tobacco smoke may\naffect lung development. Thus, these factors may be more\nproximate determinants of lung function in children than in\nadults. For this reason, we undertook to study factors that\nmight contribute to the racial difference in pulmonary func-\ntion in children. Using the same nationally representative\ndata set, we attempted to determine whether the racial differ-\nence between healthy asymptomatic African-American chil-\nCorrespondence to Dr. Robert A. Wise, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 5501 Hopkins Bayview Circle,\ndren and White children could be explained by\nanthropometric, socioeconomic, nutritional, and/or environ-\nmental factors.\nStudy group\nThe study subjects were children and teenage participants\nin NHANES III, a survey of the US noninstitutionalized\nNational Center for Health Statistics. The survey consisted\nof several questionnaires followed by physical examination\nand laboratory testing that included spirometry. Details on\nthe survey design and examination procedures have been\npublished by the National Center for Health Statistics (20,\n21). In this study, we applied the criteria of Hankinson et al.\n(5) to select asymptomatic, nonsmoking White or African-\nAmerican children ranging in age from 8 years to 17 years.\nand 839 African Americans met the Hankinson et al. (5)\ncriteria for healthy children and had complete records for the\nrelevant data (spirometric, anthropometric, and socioeco-\nnomic factors, smoking, and serum levels of antioxidant\nvitamins). To investigate the effect of low birth weight and\nmaternal smoking on lung function in general and on the\nracial difference in FEV1\nand FVC specifically, we analyzed\nwith available information on birth weight. The children in\nthese subsets ranged in age from 8 years to 12 years.\nSpirometry\nSpirometric measurements were obtained as previously\ndescribed (5, 21). In this study, we analyzed data from\nsessions in which at least two acceptable maneuvers had\nbeen performed. We used the reference equations derived by\nHankinson et al. (5) to calculate the predicted values for\nspirometric indices.\nStatistical analyses\nCross-sectional analysis of the data was conducted with\nSAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).\nMultivariable regression analysis was performed separately\nby gender, with FEV1\nor FVC as the dependent variable.\nIndependent variables included age, sitting or standing\nheight, race, educational level of the family head, and\npoverty index. The poverty index is defined as the ratio of\nfamily income in the past 12 months to the federal poverty\nline, such that a higher poverty index is indicative of a higher\nsocioeconomic status. To test the effects of environmental\ntobacco smoke exposure and serum antioxidant levels, we\nadded separately to the above regression model each of the\nfollowing variables: tobacco smoke exposure at home (1 =\nthe presence of at least one cigarette smoker in the house-\nhold; 0 = no smokers in the household) and serum concentra-\ntions of vitamins A, C, and E and - and -carotene. We also\nincluded terms for the interactions between education of the\nfamily head and race and between poverty index and race, in\norder to assess whether socioeconomic variables affected\nAfrican Americans differently from Whites. To explore the\neffect on lung function of birth weight and maternal smoking\nduring pregnancy, we performed regression analyses in the\nyounger subsets of the study population for children with\ncomplete information on these variables. We applied\nStudent's t test by gender to check the significance of the\nracial difference in potentially explanatory variables\nbetween African Americans and Whites. Regression coeffi-\ncients and the results of t tests were considered significant at\np = 0.05. Reduction in the racial difference was calculated as\n1 \u00ad (adjusted /SH-adjusted ), where \"adjusted \" is the\nadjusted racial difference obtained when the specified vari-\nables were included in the model and \"SH-adjusted \" is the\nadjusted racial difference obtained when standing height was\nused in the model.\nTo determine whether the residual racial difference was\nthe result of covariate selection, we performed regression\nanalyses using all candidate variables. The residual racial\ndifferences for the full model were compared with the differ-\nences for the parsimonious model.\nRESULTS\nStudy population\nThe numbers of children who were excluded from the\nstudy population for various reasons are shown in table 1.\nThe greatest number of exclusions from the combined set of\nAfrican Americans and Whites (n = 2,306) was due to\ndoctors' diagnoses of asthma (n = 238). This gave us a final\nlast three exclusions, the study group was similar to the\npopulation used by Hankinson et al. (5) to derive the race-\nand gender-specific spirometric reference equations. Table 2\npresents the subjects' characteristics by gender and race.\nGirls and boys of both races were similar in age (mean ages\nAmericans of both sexes were taller, had lower FEV1\nand\nFVC values, had more exposure to environmental tobacco\nsmoke at home, and came from families with heads that were\npoorer, less educated, and more likely to be unemployed.\nTable 2 shows that in comparison with Whites, serum levels\nof vitamin A, vitamin C, and -carotene were lower in\nAfrican Americans of both sexes. When compared with\nWhites, the African-American girls had a higher body mass\nindex, and the African-American boys had a higher FEV1\n:\nFVC ratio.\nEffect of anthropometric, socioeconomic, and\nnutritional factors\nIn regression analysis, terms for the interaction between\nfamily-head education and race and the interaction between\npoverty index and race were not significant in either girls or\nboys, indicating that these socioeconomic variables affected\nand FVC similarly in both racial groups. For this\nreason, we combined the White and African-American chil-\nRacial Difference in Lung Function 895\ndren by gender to study the main effects of socioeconomic\nstatus on the racial difference in lung function.\nTables 3 and 4 show the results of regression analyses\nperformed to determine the effect of including sitting height,\nsocioeconomic variables, and serum levels of antioxidant\nvitamins on the racial difference in lung function in girls and\nboys. When age, standing height, and race were entered into\nthe regression model, the racial difference in FEV1\nbetween\nWhite and African-American subjects was 356 ml in girls\nand 364 ml in boys (table 3). Adjusting for sitting height\ninstead of standing height reduced the racial difference to\npercent reduction) in boys. In girls, the most significant\nsocioeconomic variable that was found to affect lung func-\ntion was the educational level of the family head, whereas in\nboys it was poverty index. The addition of these socioeco-\nnomic variables to the respective models reduced the racial\ndifference further to 184 ml (48 percent reduction) in girls\nand 140 ml (61 percent reduction) in boys. Of the antioxi-\ndants listed in table 2, only serum -carotene in girls and\nvitamin A in boys were significantly associated with FEV1\n.\nThe subsequent inclusion of these antioxidants in the respec-\ntive models further reduced the racial difference to 178 ml\nreduction) for the boys.\nWe also performed similar regression analyses for FVC.\nWhen age, standing height, and race were entered into the\nregression model, the racial difference in FVC between\nml in boys (table 4). Adjusting for sitting height instead of\nstanding height reduced the racial difference to 240 ml (42\npercent reduction) in girls and 225 ml (51 percent reduction)\nin boys. The addition of socioeconomic variables reduced\nthe racial difference further to 224 ml (46 percent reduction)\nin girls and 200 ml (56 percent reduction) in boys. The\nsubsequent inclusion of serum antioxidants (vitamin A and\n-carotene for girls; vitamin A for boys) further reduced the\nracial difference to 208 ml (50 percent reduction) for the\ngirls and 195 ml (58 percent reduction) for the boys.\nTo determine whether other socioeconomic variables had\nany effect on FEV1\nand FVC, we added to the regression\nmodels the socioeconomic and nutritional variables listed in\ntable 1 for which data were available on all subjects (table 5).\nThese full models showed that including a larger set of\nsocioeconomic and nutritional variables accounted for only a\nslightly larger amount of the residual racial difference.\nEffect of environmental tobacco smoke exposure\nThe inverse association between exposure to tobacco\nsmoking at home and the educational attainment of the\nfamily head was observed in each of the four gender-race\nsubgroups in this study. The subjects were divided by expo-\nsure to tobacco smoke in the home. This yielded 450 girls\nand 400 boys who came from homes with no smokers and\none tobacco smoker. Values for measures of socioeconomic\nstatus, such as poverty index, years of education of the\nfamily head, and employment status of the family head, as\nwell as the proportion of Whites, were all higher in the\nnonexposed subgroups for both genders.\nTo evaluate the contribution of the greater home exposure\nto tobacco smoking in African Americans to the racial differ-\nence in lung function, we used gender-specific multivariate\nregression models that adjusted for age, race, and sitting\nheight. Results showed that exposure to tobacco smoke at\nhome, as measured by the presence of at least one smoker in\nthe household, was weakly associated with FEV1\nin the girls\nonly 4 ml (1 percent) of the FEV1\nracial difference.

There\nwas no effect of household smoke exposure on FVC or on the\nracial difference in FVC in this group of healthy girls (p = 0.8).\nUsing similar regression models, we could not detect a\nsignificant effect of home exposure to tobacco smoking on\n(p = 0.13) or FVC (p = 0.8) in this subset of asymptom-\natic healthy boys. All of the above findings led us to\nTABLE 1.

The magnitude of the effect of birth weight on\nlung function stayed essentially the same when education of\nthe household head was taken into account.\nIn this subgroup, the proportion of children exposed to\nmaternal smoking during pregnancy was 25 percent in\nWhites and 22 percent in African Americans. However, the\ndifference was not statistically significant (p = 0.7). Regres-\nsion analyses showed that the effects of maternal smoking\nduring pregnancy on FEV1\nwere not significant. The weak effect on FEV1\nbecame even\nweaker when birth weight was included in the model. Thus,\nit appears that in-utero exposure to maternal smoking does\nnot contribute to the racial difference in lung function in this\nhealthy subset of younger girls.\nSimilar analyses were conducted in the subset of 369 boys\nwith available information on birth weight. The 174 White\nboys and 195 African-American boys ranged in age from 8\nyears to 12 years (mean = 10.1). The mean birth weight of\nthe White boys was significantly higher than that of the\n3,214 g (standard error, 46)). In this group of boys, the inclu-\nsion of birth weight in regression models that adjusted for\nage, sitting height, and race showed that a decrease in birth\nweight of 100 g was accompanied by decreases of 5.3 ml and\nand FVC, respectively. Birth weight further\nreduced the racial difference in FEV1\nreduction) and reduced the racial difference in FVC by 16 ml\n(4.2 percent reduction). The overall reductions in the FEV1\nand FVC racial differences after the addition of birth weight\nand poverty index were 64 percent and 57 percent, respec-\ntively. The effect of birth weight was slightly reduced when\npoverty index was included in the model.\nMoreover, we found in this subset that the proportion of\nWhite boys who were exposed to maternal smoking during\npregnancy (28 percent) was significantly higher than the\nproportion of African-American boys (18 percent) (p =\n0.02). We did not observe any significant effect of maternal\nsmoking during pregnancy on FEV1\nor FVC. This indicates\nthat, as in the girls, maternal smoking during pregnancy does\nnot explain the racial difference in lung volume in this\nsubgroup of younger healthy boys.\nAdditional analyses carried out in the younger cohort\nusing the available socioeconomic, nutritional, and smoke-\nexposure variables did not reduce the racial difference in\ncomparison with the parsimonious model.\nTABLE 5.

After adjusting for\nanthropometric, socioeconomic, and nutritional variables,\nwe could account for only 50 percent of the racial differences\nand FVC among girls; we were able to account for\n63 percent of the racial difference in FEV1\nthe racial difference in FVC among boys. As in the adults\nfrom the same nationally representative study (19), the major\nsource of difference was anthropometric, namely the lower\ntrunk:leg ratio of African Americans as compared with\nWhites. Substituting sitting height for standing height\nreduced the racial difference in FEV1\nby 43 percent in girls\nand 53 percent in boys and reduced the racial difference in\nFVC by 42 percent in girls and 51 percent in boys. Although\nthis reduction was larger than that observed in NHANES III\nadults (19) and in a group of healthy nonsmoking African\nAmericans and Whites aged 6\u00ad24 years (3), it was smaller\nthan that reported by Hsi et al. (2), who found that the use of\nsitting height in children could account for most of the racial\ndifference in lung volume. Presumably, sitting height more\nclosely corresponds to the size of the thorax than standing\nheight.\nAs in our study of the NHANES III adults (19), socioeco-\nnomic variables explained smaller amounts of the racial\ndifference in lung volume between African-American and\nWhite children. Adjustment for education of the family head\nas a surrogate for socioeconomic status reduced FEV1\nand\nFVC by 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, in girls. In\nboys, poverty index but not education of the family head\ninfluenced lung function, reducing the racial difference in\nby 8 percent and reducing the racial difference in FVC\nby 5 percent.\nWe also considered the effect of the major antioxidant\nvitamins previously shown to influence lung function (12,\n13). Of these antioxidants, serum vitamin A and -carotene\nwere significantly associated with lung function and were\nalso lower in African Americans in this study group (table\n2). The latter finding is consistent with the report by\nPatterson et al. (22) that African Americans have lower\nconsumption of fruits and vegetables than Whites. However,\nthe addition of these antioxidants to the gender-specific\nmodels explained only 1\u00ad4 percent of the racial difference in\nlung function. It is notable that the association of the socio-\neconomic variables with lung function was reduced when the\nabove antioxidants were included in the model. This\nsuggests that low serum levels of antioxidant vitamins may\npartially explain the negative effect of low socioeconomic\nstatus on lung function.\nIn this group of healthy children, home exposure to\ntobacco smoking, as measured by the presence of at least one\nsmoker in the household, was more common in African\nAmericans and was weakly associated with FEV1\nonly in\ngirls. This is consistent with some other reports that females\nare more susceptible to tobacco smoke exposure than are\nmales (7, 23). However, this negative effect, which\nexplained very little of the racial difference in FEV1\npercent), became nonsignificant after education of the family\nhead was taken into account. Additionally, the lack of effect\nand FVC in boys indicates that home exposure to\ntobacco smoke cannot be evoked to explain the racial differ-\nence in lung function in this group of asymptomatic healthy\ngirls and boys. The minimal effect of home smoke exposure\nis different from other results obtained in general population\nsamples (17, 18). Our results should not be used to infer that\nthere is no effect of home tobacco smoke exposure in suscep-\ntible children. Our failure to find an effect of home tobacco\nsmoke exposure on lung function was probably due to our\nexclusion of children with asthma and other lung diseases,\nwho are more susceptible to environmental tobacco smoke.\nIn the younger subgroup of healthy girls and boys (mean\nage = 10 years), we also found that in-utero smoke exposure,\nthough more common in White children than in African-\nAmerican children, was significantly higher only in boys.\nThis finding and the lack of an effect on lung function indi-\ncate that maternal smoking during pregnancy does not\nexplain the racial difference in lung function in healthy boys\nand girls.\nUsing the same younger subset, we found that the African-\nAmerican children had lower birth weights than Whites.\nEven though birth weight was significantly associated with\nlung function, the birth-weight differential between the two\nracial groups explained 3\u00ad5 percent of the racial difference\nbetween African Americans and Whites. The report by\nBarker et al. (14) that lower birth weight was associated with\nlower lung function in men and that mean FEV1\nyears increased by 60 ml for each pound (0.45 kg) of birth\nweight suggests that racial differences in birth weight might\naffect the lung function racial difference in adults. The\nunavailability of birth weight information for the older chil-\ndren and the adults in NHANES III prevented us from esti-\nmating the contribution of birth weight to the observed racial\ndifference in these groups.\nThe reasons for the lung volume difference between\nWhites and African Americans are complex, because race is\na social as well as a biologic construct. In this study, the\nlargest component of the lung function difference was sitting\nheight. In addition to the socioeconomic variables listed in\ntables 3\u00ad5, we examined the effects of family head employ-\nment status, availability of sufficient food, gender of the\nfamily head, and household size. We also examined the\neffects of such environmental factors as home and in-utero\ntobacco smoke exposure and the effect of the racial differ-\nence in birth weight, all of which are associated with lower\nlung function. These variables explained only a small\nproportion of the racial difference in lung function.\nThe reason for the unexplained portion of the racial differ-\nence in lung function is not clear. It may be that we did not\nadequately adjust for confounding anthropometric and\nsocioeconomic factors. Sitting height is not a perfect\nmeasure of the size of the thorax and may not account for all\nof the anthropometric racial difference. Furthermore, there\nmay be biologic components of this difference that are not\nexplained by sitting height. It is also likely that the socioeco-\nnomic variables in NHANES III did not capture all of the\nenvironmental factors that affect lung function and that other\nfactors that account for this difference were not measured in\nWe also considered the possibility that the higher number\nof African-American children with undiagnosed asthma or\nother respiratory diseases might be responsible for the racial\ndifference in lung function. However, when we excluded\nsubjects whose FEV1\npercent-predicted value was less than\n80, we could account for only a slightly greater amount of\nthe adjusted racial difference than was observed for the\nwhole sample.\nIn conclusion, sitting height explains only 42\u00ad53 percent\nof the racial difference in lung function between White chil-\ndren and African-American children. Socioeconomic, nutri-\ntional, and environmental variables measured in NHANES\nIII explained relatively little (7\u00ad10 percent) of the lower lung\nvolume in African Americans. Thus, the remaining differ-\nence in lung function must be attributable to unmeasured\nvariables or other biologic, environmental, or socioeconomic\nfactors.\nREFERENCES\n1.
