Four of these cases (31% of the sample with diabetes) were considered to have type 2\ndiabetes. The estimated prevalence of diabetes (all types) per 100 adolescents ages 12\u00ad19 years\nmmol/l) among adolescents without diabetes who had fasted for at least 8 h was 1.76% (0.02\u00ad\nCONCLUSIONS -- National data reflect the presence of type 2 diabetes in U.S. adolescents,\nbut the survey sample size was not large enough to obtain precise prevalence estimates because\nof the relatively low prevalence.\nType 2 diabetes in adolescents may be\non the rise in North America, espe-\ncially among minority populations\n(1,2). Population-based studies have re-\nported high prevalence estimates of type 2\ndiabetes in American-Indian adolescents\n(3,4), but such estimates are not available\nfor other ethnic groups. Published data\ninclude clinical case series and therefore\nexclude undiagnosed cases and cases not\nreferred to large pediatric centers (2).\nCases have also been reported of adoles-\ncents with type 2 diabetes who were mis-\nclassified as having type 1 diabetes (2).\nStill, in large pediatric centers, diagnosed\ntype 2 diabetes was recently reported to\naccount for 8\u00ad45% of the new cases of\ndiabetes (2). Thus, the true prevalence of\ntype 2 diabetes (i.e., reported diagnosed\nand undiagnosed) might not lag far be-\nhind that of type 1 diabetes in adoles-\ncents. The reports of diagnosed cases of\ntype 2 diabetes might also represent the\ntip of the iceberg of insulin resistance in\nthe U.S. pediatric population.\nHealth and Nutrition  \n(NHANES III) recruited a representative\nyears who had serum glucose measured\n(5).

Adoles-\ncents were asked during a household\ninterview to show the interviewer all of\nthe medications they were taking. All\nmedications related to diabetes were later\ncoded as glucose regulators. At the subse-\nquent examination, adolescents were\nasked if they were currently using insulin.\nEach adolescent was randomly\nassigned to either a morning or an after-\nnoon/evening examination session. Ado-\nlescents scheduled for a morning exami-\nnation were instructed to fast at least 8 h,\nand those scheduled for an afternoon/\nevening examination session were in-\nstructed to fast at least 6 h. Adolescents\nknown to be taking insulin were in-\nstructed not to fast before the examina-\ntion. Serum glucose level was measured\nwith a Hitachi Model 737 multichannel\nanalyzer (Boehringer Mannheim, India-\nnapolis, IN) in participants 12 years of\nage as part of a standard battery of bio-\nchemical assessments (6).

We considered adolescents\non oral treatment only and adolescents\nwith undiagnosed diabetes as having type\n2 diabetes. Adolescents without diabetes\nmmol/l were classified as having impaired\nfasting glucose (8). Adolescents without\ndiabetes who had HbA1c\ncorresponds to the mean plus two stan-\ndard deviations in this population, were\nclassified as having elevated HbA1c\n.\nSAS (9) was used for data manage-\nment, and SUDAAN (10) was used to ac-\ncount for the complex sample design, to\ncompare groups, and to compute appro-\npriate standard errors for prevalence esti-\nmates. Separate weights were used for the\nentire examined sample and for the de-\nfined half-sample assigned to the morning\nexamination session to account for the\ncomplex survey design, differential non-\nresponse, and planned oversampling (5).\nThus, inferences may be made to the pop-\nulation of these ages in the U.S. in 1988\u00ad\nwas not mea-\nsured for 240.

Only 10\nadolescents with HbA1c\n6% had glucose\nmeasured in the morning sample and in\nthe fasting stage. Only 3 of these 10 had\nboth elevated HbA1c\nand impaired fasting\nglucose, all were from minority groups,\npercentile. Two adolescents had HbA1c\n7% but did not meet the criteria for di-\nabetes or impaired fasting glucose; one\nhad a glucose level of 7.4 mmol/l mea-\nsured in a nonmorning sample after fast-\ning for only 6 h (BMI at the 59th percen-\ntile), and the other had a morning fasting\npercentile).\nInferences to the U.S population were\nmade using sampling weights. We esti-\nmated that the prevalences of diabetes,\nimpaired fasting glucose (no diabetes),\nand elevated HbA1c\n(no diabetes) in the\nhad impaired fasting glucose, and\n.\nreflect the presence of type 2 diabetes in\nthe pediatric population. Of the four ad-\nolescents considered to have type 2 dia-\nbetes, none were on insulin treatment; all\nfour were members of minority groups,\nand all four had elevated BMI values. Two\nof these four cases were probably undiag-\nnosed. On the other hand, no case of mis-\nclassification between type 1 and type 2\ndiabetes was suspected. In this small sub-\nsample, type 2 diabetes accounted for\n31% of the cases of diabetes.\nThe numbers of cases of diabetes, im-\npaired fasting glucose, and elevated\nwere small; the prevalence esti-\nmates of diabetes and impaired fasting\nglucose were low; and the CIs were large.\nFor 2,867 adolescents tested for diabetes,\n11 already knew they had diabetes, and\nonly 2 had undiagnosed diabetes. For\nfasted for at least 8 h, 20 had impaired\nfasting glucose, a risk factor for type 2\ndiabetes. The age group 12\u00ad19 (during or\npast puberty years) probably includes the\npediatric age at highest risk for type 2 di-\nabetes (2), and the design oversampled\ntwo minority populations at high risk.\nHowever, the sample size was not large\nenough to provide stable estimates in a\ngeneral pediatric population with low\nprevalence. This contrasts with the use-\nfulness of other population-based studies\nconducted in high-risk pediatric popula-\ntions. Recent prevalence estimates for\ntype 2 diabetes were 3.6% for Cree and\nOjibway girls aged 10\u00ad19 living in Mani-\nprevalence increased fourfold for Pima\nsixfold for children aged 15 to 19 years.\nSimilarly, prevalence estimates for im-\npaired fasting glucose were 3% for girls\nOntario (12), and 2.7% for children aged\n4\u00ad19 years in Saint Theresa Point in\nManitoba (3).\nSeveral features of our analysis should\nbe underlined. First, NHANES III was un-\n1994, and the increase in diagnosed pedi-\natric type 2 diabetes reported in hospital\ncase series was particularly noticeable af-\nment were self-reported, and omissions\nor misclassifications may have occurred.\nThird, it is also possible that a few more\nadolescents may have undiagnosed diabe-\ntes, but they may not have fasted for the\ntime required for meeting the American\nDiabetes Association criteria (8). One ad-\nolescent had indeed a glucose level of 7.4\nmmol/l and an HbA1c\nwe considered her as nondiabetic be-\ncause she was scheduled for an afternoon/\nevening examination and only fasted for\n6 h. However, there was little difference in\nage, sex, ethnicity, and BMI between the\ngroups that did or did not fast or attend an\nexamination.\nThe low prevalence of diabetes and\nimpaired fasting glucose in U.S. adoles-\ncents whom we describe here by no\nmeans diminishes the public health im-\nportance of the emergence of type 2 dia-\nbetes in the pediatric population (2).\nBecause the complications of diabetes are\nlinked to duration, onset at an early age is\nlikely to lead to increasing health prob-\nlems early in adulthood. The disease has\nonly recently been recognized and has\nprobably recently increased in the general\npediatric population. Because of the in-\ncreasing prevalence of obesity, which has\nreached high levels in U.S. youth (13) and\nthe expected population growth of mi-\nnority groups (14), it is likely that the\nprevalence of type 2 diabetes in adoles-\ncents will also increase in the future, as it\nalready has among American-Indian\nThese data, despite their limitations,\nmay raise questions on the respective val-\nues of HbA1c\nand impaired fasting glucose\nto identify adolescents at risk for type 2 di-\nabetes. Adolescents with HbA1c\nsomewhat likely to be non-Hispanic blacks\nand to have high BMI, which are risk fac-\ntors for type 2 diabetes, and this was not\nas obvious for adolescents with impaired\nfasting glucose. Only three adolescents\nwho reported fasting for at least 8 h had\nboth elevated HbA1c\nand impaired fasting\nglucose. HbA1c\nhas indeed been reported\nto be a good predictor of the later develop-\nment of type 2 diabetes in Pima Indian\nchildren (M.M. Gabir and W.C. Knowler,\npersonal communication) and is discussed\nas a screening test in adults (15). Further\nstudies comparing HbA1c\nand random,\nfasting, or postload glucose levels in ado-\nlescents will be useful to develop strate-\ngies for screening or case findings for\nadolescents at risk for diabetes.\nIn conclusion, NHANES III data re-\nveal the presence of type 2 diabetes in the\nU.S. pediatric population, but the preva-\nlence of type 2 diabetes among U.S. ado-\nlescents appears to be quite low in 1988\u00ad\n1994. Because the prevalence is low, it is\ndifficult to arrive at precise estimates of\nprevalence from surveys of the general\npopulation. At a time when the disease\nis emerging, other population-based\napproaches to ascertain incidence and\nprevalence, e.g., within more defined\npopulations at higher risk of type 2 dia-\nbetes, may be required to identify trends\nin type 2 diabetes in adolescents. The\nCenters for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion recently embarked on a new research\nDiabetes in adolescents: NHANES III data\nprogram to address this issue. Because\ntype 2 diabetes may also represent the tip\nof the iceberg of insulin resistance in the\nU.S. pediatric population, studying im-\npaired fasting glucose and other predia-\nbetic conditions is also necessary.\nReferences\n1.
