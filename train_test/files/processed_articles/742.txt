This article uses data from the first wave of the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) to\nexamine how personal characteristics and health conditions influence expectations of nursing home use. Subjective\nexpectations of nursing home use are quite close to known probabilities of lifetime use. There are marked differ-\nences in the determinants of expectations for women and men that also conform to actual behavior. There is strong\nevidence that women and men incorporate what is known about nursing home risk into their own expectations,\neven many years prior to the time when they are most likely to need long-term care.\nTHERE is a growing body of literature on the incidence\nof nursing home use and on the health and economic\ndeterminants of nursing home entry. Persistent changes in\nliving arrangement patterns of elderly persons (Holden,\n1988) and predicted changes in longevity and health (Crim-\nmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994; Crimmins and Ingegneri,\n1992), suggest that the lifetime probabilities of nursing\nhome use will continue to rise for future cohorts of elderly\npersons. Although it is important to understand the deter-\nminants of nursing home entry among those currently at\nrisk of entering a nursing home, it is perhaps even more\nimportant to understand whether individuals are able to ac-\ncurately assess the relative risks of their entering a nursing\nhome sometime in the future and incorporate this informa-\ntion into their savings and insurance decisions. If individu-\nals who are more likely to enter a nursing home in the\nfuture can identify their own higher risk some years before\nnursing home entry, financial incentives may encourage\nthose most at risk to purchase nursing home insurance or to\ncover their higher risk through higher savings. On the other\nhand, if expectations of nursing home use do not conform\nto who is most likely to use nursing home care in the\nfuture, market incentives may not be sufficient to enable in-\ndividuals to insure against the costs of nursing home care.\nPrevious research on savings and insurance behavior has\nnot incorporated information on how expectations of nurs-\ning home care shaped behavior because information on\nthese expectations did not exist.\nIn this study we are interested in understanding the dis-\ntribution of perceived risk and the information that individ-\nuals consider when estimating their risk. To explore this,\ndata from the 1992 interview of the Health and Retirement\nStudy (HRS) are used to test the hypotheses that (a) the ex-\npectation of nursing home entry for respondents is consis-\ntent with observed frequencies of lifetime use of nursing\nhomes, and (b) respondents form expectations about future\nnursing home use in rational ways, that is, they use what is\nknown about observed risk factors to form expectations.\nBecause the primary respondents in the sample were only\n51-61 years of age, we expect that most individuals will\nhave a high degree of uncertainty about future nursing\nhome use. Our approach is to take from the literature vari-\nables that are known to influence actual nursing home entry\nand estimate their influence on the expectations for this co-\nhort of nursing home entry. Of particular interest are the\nvariables that influence the expectations of women and\nmen, because historically there have been striking differ-\nences in nursing home risk between women and men. The\nliterature on lifetime nursing home use has shown that\nwomen are much more likely to enter a nursing home than\nmen. This difference in nursing home use by gender is due\nin part to the higher nursing home risk faced by unmarried\nindividuals, and women are more likely to outlive their\nspouses. In constructing life cycle models, it is important to\nunderstand whether women, both those now married and\nthose who are not, perceive their lifetime risk of nursing\nhome use as relatively high.\nOver time it will be important to follow changes in\nexpectations as health and family characteristics change.\nAdditional waves of the HRS will enable us to examine\nthe relationship of early expectations of nursing home use\nto other behavior including actual rates of nursing home\nentry. However, only in the first HRS were questions asked\nin a one-time module about nursing home expectations.\nThis analysis demonstrates the value of gathering data on\nexpectations and of examining the effect on behavior of\nexpectations in general and of nursing home expectations\nin particular.\nPrevious Literature\nWe use the literature on actual nursing home use as a\nbenchmark against which to judge the meaning of the ex-\npectations data and as a guide for variable selection. While\nthere is a large literature that investigates the factors that in-\nfluence the risk of nursing home entry among elderly per-\nsons currently at risk of nursing home care, only a few stud-\nies attempt to measure lifetime nursing home use. Because\nindividuals in our sample are asked about nursing home use\nat some time in the future, lifetime risk measures are the\nmost appropriate comparison measure. Of the studies that\nattempt to measure lifetime risk, only one study (Kemper\nand Murtaugh, 1991) measures lifetime risk using a dataset\nwhere lifetime risk is uncensored, i.e., where the respon-\ndents had all died and lifetime nursing home use could be\nobserved. Using data from the National Mortality Follow-\nback Survey (NMFS), a sample of next-of-kin of persons\nwho died in 1986, this study finds that the lifetime nursing\nhome use of persons who died after age 65 was 37 percent.\nA consensus has emerged in the long-term care literature\nabout the most important characteristics that influence nurs-\ning home entry (see, for example, Coughlin, McBride, arid\ntherefore, may. be expected to shape expectations as well.\nThe conceptual model developed by Anderson and >New-\nman (1973), which distinguishes factors that affect,Health\nutilization as \"need\" factors, \"enabling\" factors, or \"predis-\nposing\" factors, provides a useful organizing model for our\nown variable selection.\nForemost on the list of risk factors for nursing home\nentry are \"need\" factors or those characteristics that indi-\ncate that a person is no longer able to live independently\nbecause of declines in their health status. Typically, these\nfactors include measures of functional impairment -- e.g.,\nactivities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities\nof daily living (IADLs) -- since the presence of these limi-\ntations likely suggests that a person cannot care for him-\nor herself.\nThe long-term care literature has identified factors that\n\"enable\" a person's nursing home decision (either enabling\nthem to stay out of a nursing home or enabling them to\nenter a nursing home). Foremost among these is the avail-\nability and use of close substitutes to nursing home care:\nforrnal and informal community-based services. Many\nstudies have identified the key role played by the availabil-\nity and use of informal caregivers, which will usually in-\nclude the person's spouse if he or she is present in the\nhousehold, but could also include other family members\n(primarily children but also siblings and grandchildren). Fi-\nnancial resources are hypothesized .to be \"enabling\" vari-\nables as well and surely should be closely linked to the de-\nvelopment of expectations. However, it is not always clear\nhow resources affect the decision. In particular, higher lev-\nels of income and assets improve the affordability of nurs-\ning homes, but also allow persons to afford formal commu-\nnity-based care to stay out of a nursing home. On the other\nhand, low levels of income and assets may show that a per-\nson is eligible for Medicaid, the public insurance program\nof last resort, improving the access of low-income persons\nto nursing homes. Economists have concentrated on the\npotential role of market conditions as an enabling factor in\nthe decision to enter nursing homes (Headen, 1992; Liu,\nScanlon, 1980). Key characteristics of markets that are im-\nportant are the price and supply of nursing home beds and\nthe price and supply of home health care. In addition, pub-\nlic policies that affect the conditions of the market, for\ninstance, controls on bed supply and Medicaid eligibility\nrules and reimbursement rates, will also affect a person's\nability to enter a nursing home.\nThe third set of risk factors, those that are thought to\n\"predispose\" a person toward nursing home care, include\nincreasing age but may also include education and race or\nethnicity. Increasing age may reduce the ability of individu-\nals to cope with specific disability conditions. To the extent\nthat educational attainment increases a person's knowledge\nof alternative long-term care options, this might also influ-\nence a person's choice of a nursing home as an option.\nWhile some share of the lower rate of nursing home use\namong Blacks may be explained by economic, health, and\ndisability differences, their nursing home use is consistently\nlower even after controlling for these and other factors\n(Headen, 1992). The nursing home utilization literature is\nconsistent in finding a higher risk of nursing home entry for\nfemales than men, for Whites as compared to non-Whites,\nand for never married as compared to married or previously\nmarried persons.\nIn discussing marginal effects on the lifetime probability\nof a nursing home entry, Liu, McBride, and Coughlin (1994)\npoint out that these probabilities are the net result of two im-\nportant risks: the risk of mortality and the risk of nursing\nhome entry, conditional on survival. Thus, a characteristic\nthat increases (decreases) nursing home risk will be rein-\nforced in its effect on the lifetime probability of nursing\nhome entry if it is also associated with a lower (greater)\nmortality risk. For instance, that women have a far greater\nchance of living to ages of highest nursing home entry risk\nmay explain an important part of the difference in lifetime\nprobabilities of nursing home entry between men and\nwomen. However, even controlling for individual differ-\nences in mortality, men are more likely to be married, thus\nensuring the presence of a primary caregiver should they\nneed long-term care. Women at all ages are more likely to\nbe left without a caregiving spouse. In addition, even when\nboth members of a couple are alive, it has been found that\nwomen are more likely to be the caregiver than are married\nmen. This could reflect differences in caregiving skills or\ndifferences in social expectations about the responsibilities\nof wives and husbands for care of a disabled spouse.\nHypotheses. -- The purpose of this study is to explore\nthe expectations of nursing home use among a cohort of re-\nspondents to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Be-\ncause the primary respondents in the sample were only\n51-61 years of age, we expect that most individuals will\nhave a high degree of uncertainty about future nursing\nhome use. Nevertheless, we explore several hypotheses:\n(a) The expectation of nursing home entry for respon-\ndents is consistent with observed frequency of life-\ntime use of nursing homes found in other studies;\n(b) Respondents form expectations about nursing home\ncare in rational ways, that is, they use the informa-\ntion available to them to form expectations, and this\ninformation is used in ways that are consistent with\nwhat has been found in the nursing home literature\nabout observed risk factors;\n(c) The nursing home expectations for men and women\nwill differ and the factors that influence these ex-\npected risks will differ as well.\nMETHODS\nData from Wave 1 of the Health and Retirement Study\n(HRS) are used to test the hypotheses explored here. The\nHRS is a nationally representative sample of persons aged\npartner (who could be any age) was also interviewed. The\nhouseholds. Current plans are for this cohort to be inter-\nviewed every two years. Several methodological modules\nin the first interview offered a set of experimental questions\nto subsamples. A \"Health Risk\" module (Module J) in-\ncludes the nursing home expectation question and was ad-\nministered in 754 different households.\nThe first question asked in Module J provides the focus\nof this analysis:\n\"On a scale where 0 equals absolutely no chance and 10\nequals absolutely certain, what do you think are the chances\nthat you will need long-term care in a nursing home at some\npoint during your lifetime?\" [Question MJ1]\nModule J was administered after the main questionnaire,\nwhich included other expectation questions (Hurd and Mc-\nGarry, 1995). Thus, when the module was administered, re-\nspondents (who could be either the sampled member or, if\nmarried, the spouse) had already been asked several expec-\ntation questions using the same format and scale. Respon-\ndents to the HRS were allowed to give responses ranging\nfrom 0 to 10 to the expectation question. There were no ex-\nplicit options for a \"don't know\" answer.\nA response of 0 or 10 indicates absolute certainty that the\nrespondent will not (or will) enter a nursing home, and a\nresponse of 5 suggests a high degree of uncertainty about\nfuture nursing home use. Responses that range from 1 to 4\n(6 to 9) suggest that while respondents recognize the uncer-\ntainty of their nursing home entry, they have assessed this\nprobability as somewhat less (more) certain than is indi-\ncated by a response of 5. To compare these responses with\nactual probabilities, we report them as probabilities, divid-\ning each response by 10.\nFor the purposes of the multivariate analysis, we separate\nthese responses into five distinct groups based on the sub-\njective probability of nursing home use: 0, 1-4, 5, 6-9, and\n10. We grouped the subjective probabilities in part to facili-\ntate an analysis that distinguished among these distinct but\nordered values and in part because of the nonlinearity of the\nresponses (the relatively small number of individuals who\nchose any of the single values 1-4 and 6-9 and the larger\nnumbers choosing 0, 5, or 10). Our ordered groupings re-\nquire a method that accounts for the categorical and or-\ndered dependent variable. An ordered logit model is\nappropriate for estimating the relationship between the\nprobability group and individual characteristics, especially\ngiven the bunching of respondents in certain categorical re-\nsponses (Greene, 1993). We tested other model specifica-\ntions, including a Tobit model, which treats the dependent\nvariable as a continuous but constrained variable. The un-\nderlying relationships between the explanatory variables\nand the categorical response were not sensitive to the\nmodel specification.\nPredictors of nursing home use. -- One purpose of our\nstudy is to discover whether personal characteristics associ-\nated with nursing home entry at older ages may also be as-\nsociated with expectations of nursing home use among the\nyounger cohort in the HRS. Thus, we select as predictors of\nnursing home expectations those found in previous studies\nof nursing home use. One problem with this reasoning is\nthat the formation of expectations by the HRS cohort must\nbe based on the information available to them at the time of\nthe interview. In providing a nursing home expectation,\nHRS respondents must also be predicting risk factors that\nmay develop as they age. While predicting future health\nconditions may be difficult for persons age 51-61, it may\nbe less difficult to predict caregiver availability and finan-\ncial resources at the age they will be most at risk of nursing\nhome entry. In addition, already evident are some health\nconditions that are predictive of future mortality or\nlong-term care needs. Without direct information on why\nrespondents assess their risk of nursing home entry as rela-\ntively high or low, we start with the assumption that the\nsame sets of predictors that determine nursing home entry\nare important in assessing future use. Taking account of the\nfact that HRS respondents were using information available\nto them in 1992 to assess probabilities, we supplement the\nlist of known risk factors with variables that we hypothe-\nsize reflect additional sources of information to respondents\nabout their likely risk of future nursing home entry. We\ndraw this list of risk factors from the literature on nursing\nhome utilization described above. Thus, we focus on need,\nenabling, and predisposing risk factors, following the\nmodel proposed by Anderson and Newman (1973). In addi-\ntion, we keep in mind that the lifetime probability of nurs-\ning home use, and therefore its expectation, is the net result\nof two important risks: the risk of mortality and the risk of\nnursing home entry, conditional on survival.\nAs described above, \"need\" factors include those charac-\nteristics that indicate a person is no longer able to live inde-\npendently because of declines in their health status. The ul-\ntimate effect on lifetime nursing home risk of the presence\nat younger ages of these same health conditions is ambigu-\nous and depends on the magnitude of the likely impacts on\nboth the risk of mortality and the risk of nursing home\nentry. This ambiguity is also present. To disentangle these\ndifferent health effects on expected probabilities of nursing\nhome use, we distinguish between \"early mortality\" and\n\"long-term disability\" health conditions: \"Early mortality\"\nhealth conditions lower the probability of future nursing\nhome use by increasing the probability of early death,\nwhereas \"long-term disability\" conditions increase the\nprobability of future nursing home use by increasing the\nlikelihood of functional impairment while having little ef-\nfect on mortality risk. Because not all health risks may be\nobserved in the HRS, we include an indicator of whether\nthe HRS respondent's parent ever used (including cur-\nrently) a nursing home. While this may also measure infor-\nmation and attitudinal effects, we hypothesize that it cap-\ntures unmeasured genetic factors and health expectations\nthat the survey did not ask about.\nAmong the \"enabling\" factors that might influence ex-\npectations, we concentrate on the availability and use of\nclose substitutes to nursing home care: formal and informal\ncommunity-based services. It is important to keep in mind\nthat when establishing expectations, respondents must as-\nsess not only the current availability of alternative sources\nof care but also the likelihood that they will be able to ac-\ncess that care in the future. Financial resources are also hy-\npothesized to be \"enabling\" variables and surely should be\nclosely linked to the development of expectations. How-\never, it is not always clear how resources affect the deci-\nsion: Medicaid coverage enables lower income persons to\ngain access to nursing homes, whereas higher income re-\nspondents use their own financial resources. The contrasts\nbetween these effects led us to categorize respondents into\nthree distinct wealth groups: those with less than $4500 in\nfinancial and property assets excluding the primary resi-\ndence; those with greater than $90,000 in assets; and the\ngroup between. The lower cut-off was selected to distin-\nguish those for whom nursing home costs were not a finan-\ncial constraint because they are probably now and are likely\nto remain eligible for Medicaid. The higher cut-off was se-\nlected to distinguish those whose assets were sufficient to\npay for the average stay for all but short-stay patients of\njust over 2.0 years. Those with assets above this amount\nhave sufficient resources to enable a nursing home stay\nThose who fall between these two asset thresholds are most\nlikely to have nursing home expectations shaped by their\nexpected financial constraints. Although we have insuffi-\ncient geographic detail on respondents' residences to iden-\ntify market conditions that might enable respondents to\nenter nursing homes, we do identify residence in a standard\nmetropolitan statistical area (SMSA) or in the South as a\ncrude aggregate indicator of these geographic (and perhaps\ndiscrimination) effects.\nAmong the risk factors thought to \"predispose\" a person\ntoward nursing home care, we include gender, age, educa-\ntion, and race or ethnicity. One main goal of this study is to\ncompare the nursing home expectations of men to the ex-\npectations of women. We will explore whether these\nexpectations differ even after controlling for other factors.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 provides descriptive data on expectations of\nnursing home use among the HRS respondents. The aver-\nage expected risk of nursing home use is .402 with very\nlittle difference in the expected rate between women and\nmen. Blacks report lower probabilities than Whites (com-\nlikely than non-married persons to expect to enter nursing\nAs noted above, we use the literature on actual nursing\nhome use as a benchmark against which to judge the mean-\ning of the expectations data and as a guide for variable se-\nlection. The overall expected nursing home risk of 40 per-\ncent is consistent with the 37 percent probability of any use\nestimated by Kemper and Murtaugh (1991) in the one study\nthat measures lifetime risk using a dataset where lifetime\nrisk is uncensored, i.e., where the respondents had all died\nand lifetime nursing home use could be observed (Table 2).\nTable 1.

HRS data are weighted responses from\nHRSWave 1.\nThe NMFS was drawn from a sample of deceased persons, so age of\ndeath is available; the HRS sample is a sample of live respondents, so age\nat death is not available.\ncn.a. = not applicable.\nThere are some important conceptual differences be-\ntween probabilities reported in Kemper and Murtaugh's\nstudy on actual use and the HRS reported expectation data.\nFirst, the HRS question does not specify the reason for\nnursing home entry, an age of entry, nor a time period ex-\npected to remain there. Thus, it is not clear how the respon-\ndent interpreted the meaning of the phrase, \"long-term care\nin a nursing home.\" Respondents may have focused on the\n\"nursing home\" part of the question, perhaps classifying all\nnursing home stays, including relatively short stays (e.g.,\nless than 3 months) as \"long-term care.\" Alternatively, re-\nspondents may have focused on the \"long-term care\" part\nof the question, perhaps reporting expectations only for rel-\natively long nursing home stays (e.g., more than 3 months).\nAs shown in Table 2, Kemper and Murtaugh report that\nwhile 26 percent of elderly persons used nursing homes for\n3 months or more, another 11 percent used nursing homes\nfor at least a day, but for less than 3 months.\nSecond, to interpret the HRS expectations variables, we\nmake the assumption that people understand how to trans-\nlate their expectations about the future into a 0-10 scale.\nHowever, this assumption may not be valid for some re-\nspondents. In particular, a response of \"5\" may indicate that\nthe respondent does not understand probabilities and has\nchosen the midpoint of the scale as a focal response. If this\nwere true, one would expect these individuals to choose 5\nin response to all other probability questions that preceded\nthe nursing home expectations question in the survey. To\ntest whether the 5s are informed responses, we examined\nthe answers to the identically phrased questions about the\nuals who responded 5 to the nursing home risk question,\nonly 24 of them answered 5 or did not answer both the\nmortality expectations questions. Although this is only a\ncrude test, we conclude that the large number of 5s do not\nreflect ignorance about probabilities. Using similar tech-\nniques for assessing the validity of the responses, others\nreach the same conclusions as we do here (Honig, 1996;\nHurd and McGarry, 1995). Rather, we argue that the 5s re-\nflect real uncertainty about future nursing home use, and\nthat movements toward zero (or 10) reflect some informa-\ntion about factors that would reduce (increase) the prob-\nability of entering a nursing home. Similarly, we were\nconcerned that responses of 0 and 1 were provided with ig-\nnorance of probability, rather than based on absolute cer-\ntainty. Again, there was sufficient dispersion in answers to\nother probability questions to suggest that certain persons\ndid understand the concept of probability. Interestingly, in-\ndividuals who were certain that they would not enter a\nnursing home were more likely to have responded that their\nchance of living to 85 was zero.\nThe distribution of responses is consistent with the inter-\npretation that many persons are uncertain about their risks.\nThe modal response, given by about 35 percent of all re-\nspondents, is 5. In contrast, about 23 percent were certain\nabout their use of nursing homes (19% certain they will not\nuse nursing homes, 4% certain they will). The remaining\nthird of the sample gave responses that lie between the ex-\ntremes of complete certainty and complete uncertainty.\nPredictors of nursing home use. -- Table 2 presents\nsome characteristics associated with lifetime nursing home\nuse and, therefore, that may be expected to shape expecta-\ntions as well. The results suggest that while HRS respon-\ndents' expectations do vary in ways that are comparable to\nactual use rates, the variation is much smaller for expecta-\ntions than actual use. For instance, HRS females estimate a\nrisk that lies between the short- and long-term nursing\nclearly overestimate their risk (41% as compared to 21-\n32%). Expected rates for Blacks and Whites are above\nactual rates, particularly for Blacks, but Whites and Blacks\ndo perceive correctly that their use rates are different.\nWhile married individuals overestimate their chances (most\nlikely a product of the overestimates by the mostly married\nmales), expectations of unmarried individuals almost ex-\nactly mirror actual chances.\nTable 3 presents, for women and men separately, the\nmeans of characteristics that we hypothesize influence\nnursing home expectations. Although the mean number of\nchildren is about the same for women and men, women are\nless likely to be living with a spouse or partner. Hence,\neven at this relatively early age, women have fewer poten-\nTable 3.

Women are somewhat\nyounger and report lower education levels and fewer assets\nthan males. However, assets are for the family so that this\ndifference is primarily because women are more likely to\nbe widowed than are males in the HRS sample.\nBecause health is a strong predictor of actual nursing\nhome use, we include both subjective and \"objective\" mea-\nsures of health, although all health measures are self-\nreported. About 18 percent of the full sample reported fair\nor poor health status, with males somewhat more likely to\ndo so. There is no difference between women and men in\nthe percentage reporting that their health has become worse\nover the past year.\nWhile subjective measures of health may capture percep-\ntions regarding general health status, previous research sug-\ngests that specific health conditions affect nursing home\nentry in different ways. As discussed above, we distinguish\nbetween health conditions likely to predict death (\"early\nmortality\" conditions), and health conditions that are likely\nto predict long periods of functional limitation (\"long-term\ndisability\" conditions). In the list of early mortality condi-\ntions we include histories of high blood pressure, heart at-\ntack, and cancer. High blood pressure is predictive of future\nheart disease that is associated with high mortality and a\nlimited period of disability. In the list of long-term disabil-\nity conditions we include histories of arthritis, diabetes,\nasthma, persistent pain, stroke, kidney or stomach prob-\nlems, difficulties with activities of daily living (ADLs), and\nmental illness. We include three \"life style\" characteristics\nthat threaten health problems but currently may not be\nlinked with a health condition. These are whether the per-\nson is a current smoker, drinks more than three drinks per\nday on average, or is obese (the person is categorized as\nobese if the ratio of body weight in kilograms to height in\nmeters squared is greater than 33).\nThe results presented in Table 3 indicate that while an\nearly mortality condition is more often reported by men\ndifference that is statistically significant). Although not\nshown here, the higher incidence of long-term disability\nconditions among women arises from a higher incidence of\narthritis and psychiatric disorders. The greater prevalence\nof early mortality health conditions among men than\nwomen may contribute to the higher mortality rates of men\nand the consequent disparity in the actual lifetime risk of\nnursing home use between men and women. In contrast, the\npresence of more long-term disability conditions may oper-\nate in the opposite direction. A question is whether men and\nwomen recognize these future disparities much earlier in\nlife and, consequently, whether men have lower nursing\nhome use expectations.\nMultivariate Analysis\nIn this section we seek to identify how personal charac-\nteristics are related to variations in the expectations of nurs-\ning home use. As described above, we group responses for\nthe multivariate analysis. Table 4 presents variable means\nfor each of the five probability groups. In some cases, this\ntable suggests a strong relationship between a variable and\nnursing home expectations. For instance, the average num-\nber of children falls as reported chances of nursing home\nuse rise. Urban location and residence in the South appear\nto be associated with lower expectations of nursing home\nentry -- of those reporting a 0 probability, 70 percent re-\nside in an urban community, whereas of those reporting\ncertain entry, only 58 percent are urban residents. Table 4\nalso suggests that respondents' estimates of probabilities\nalso reflect greater or lesser \"certainty\" on the part of re-\nspondents about their chances of nursing home entry, given\ntheir current characteristics. This does not contradict the\nunderlying assumption of a monotonic ordering of proba-\nbilities; higher stated probabilities still reflect higher chances\nof entry which are themselves expressions of uncertainty.\nWhat Table 4 suggests is that as individuals move away\nfrom \"uncertainty\" defined in the probabilistic sense as an\neven chance of using a nursing home, their estimates reflect\nunderlying processes that are consistent with known entry\nbehavior. For example, worse and worsening health reduces\nuncertainty about future nursing home entry, increasing\nthose chances. While those who are absolutely certain to\nuse a nursing home on average have 2.3 long-term disabil-\nity conditions and .8 early mortality conditions, those who\nestimate an even chance of future nursing home use have\nonly 0.97 and 0.5 conditions, respectively. On the other\nhand, those who indicate there is no chance they will enter\nTable 4.

To test the hypotheses outlined here, we\ninclude measures of health status, marital status, family\nstructure, economic status, and family history of nursing\nhome use as explanatory variables.\nTable 5 presents results from the estimation. The factors\naffecting nursing home expectations for men are very dif-\nferent from the factors affecting expectations for women.\nWhile the coefficient on the Male variable in the estimates\nusing the full sample is insignificant, a result which reflects\nthe almost identical mean expectations shown in Table 1 for\nmale and female, the separate estimates for males and fe-\nmales suggest that different processes underlie the forma-\ntion of nursing home expectations for women and men.

The expectations of males are shaped by current mari-\ntal status -- if married, their expectations of nursing home\nuse are lower. This is not the case for women who, we con-\nclude, realistically assess their chances as very small of still\nbeing married when the nursing home decision will be\nmade and are more influenced in forming their expectations\nby the availability of children rather than by the current\npresence of a spouse. Interestingly, women are also influ-\nenced by their parents' nursing home entry with more likely\nentry anticipated when a parent has been in a nursing home.\nThis positive effect may arise from (a) the information\ngleaned from their parents' experience about the conditions\nthat lead to nursing home care, even when children are pre-\nsent; (b) family expectations about the obligations of chil-\ndren to care for parents; (c) acquaintance with the quality of\nnursing home care, thereby eschewing the common percep-\ntion of substandard care; or (d) unmeasured genetic health\nconditions that individuals expect to develop in the future.\nThe last is a real possibility, as health conditions appear to\ninfluence women's nursing home expectations.\nTo try to better understand the effect of health status on\nnursing home expectations, a set of alternative regression\nmodels were run. Table 5 reports the results of our pre-\nferred model using early mortality, long-term disability, and\n\"life style\" health variables as subjective measures of\nhealth status. Alternatively, it might be assumed that re-\nspondents would use \"subjective\" health status measures\n(health status excellent, fair, or poor) to assess their risk of\nentering a nursing home, since these are likely to directly\nimpact subjective expectations. Table 6 reports the results\nfrom a test of this hypothesis, reporting the coefficients on\nthe subjective health measures; other coefficients were not\nsensitive to the health measure chosen. Including specific\nhealth conditions (results not shown) did not add insight\ninto health effects beyond that from the Table 5 specifica-\ntion. The results of the alternative specification in Table 6\nindicate that self-reported health measures do not con-\ntribute to explaining nursing home use expectations, al-\nthough worsening health, included in our preferred model\nas well, does have a strong positive influence for both\nwomen and men. This is not to say that expectations are not\ninfluenced by individuals' own global assessment of their\nhealth status. It is more likely that the HRS subjective\nhealth indicator combines medical conditions that increase\nthe chances of early mortality as well as those that increase\nthe risk of nursing home entry, conditional on survival,\nleading to an indeterminate sign on the subjective health\ncoefficient. The model estimated in Table 5 attempts to sep-\narate these two types of health conditions.\nThe results of our preferred model (Table 5) suggest that\nmales consider the type of health condition, with \"early\nmortality\" conditions diminishing expectations of nursing\nhome use and \"long-term disability\" conditions increasing\nexpectations. Men with more early mortality conditions\nmay predict early death and therefore discount the probabil-\nity of nursing home use, while men with greater numbers of\nlong-term disability conditions may predict future disability\nand therefore increase their probability of nursing home\nuse. This contrast is not apparent among women, although\nthe opposite and significant effects of being overweight and\na smoker may indicate similar processes. The positive in-\nfluence of deteriorating health on the expectations of both\nwomen and men is maintained. Their own worsening health\nand parents' nursing home use appear to signal their chances\nof future health deterioration.\nThe coefficient on the variable Black, which measures\ndifferences in the intercept, is large and statistically signifi-\ncant only at the 10 percent level for males but is smaller\nand insignificant among females. The influence of urban\nand southern residence may be picking up the effect of\neither quality of institutions, access, or alternative long-\nterm care options. We included wealth and home ownership\nas measures of expected long-term economic well-being.\nNeither wealth nor home ownership seem to influence nurs-\ning home expectations, which may indicate that these\nwealth measures are poor predictors of the effect of wealth\non long-term care choices at probable ages of nursing home\nentry. Including continuous wealth measures did not alter\nthis result. The education variables, which are significant\nonly for women, may be picking up a couple of different\neffects. On the one hand, they may be measuring long-term\nexpectations about the ability to pay for future nursing\nhome care among the more highly educated (not captured\nby the wealth variable) and, therefore, their access to higher\nquality nursing homes. On the other hand, this coefficient\nmay be capturing the better acquisition of information\nabout nursing home risks by more highly educated persons,\nincluding their children's willingness to provide care.\nAge is not a significant predictor of nursing home expec-\ntations. While this may seem counterintuitive, this finding\nlikely reflects the lack of variation in age in the HRS sam-\nple. In other words, since the age of most respondents falls\nwithin a 10-year age range, with older and younger respon-\ndents all married to persons within that range, expectations\nwould not be expected to vary by age. Moreover, the\nwell-known relationship between age of death and use of\nnursing homes (reflected in the findings cited in Table 2)\nmost likely captures persons who survive acute episodes,\nbut become more susceptible to chronic illnesses over time.\nSince health conditions are controlled for in the models\npresented here, it is likely that respondents are forming ex-\npectations of their mortality and internalizing that in their\nnursing home expectations. Thus, the relationship between\nTable 6.

While a positive (negative) sign indi-\ncates that a person is more likely to be in the highest (lowest)\nordered group, it does not necessarily increase the likelihood\nof being in all of the higher groups. For example, a positive\nsign increases the probability of observing a non-zero re-\nsponse to the expectations question, but does not necessarily\nincrease the probability of giving any non-zero response ex-\ncept for 10. To facilitate interpretation of these results, we\nuse the ordered logit to derive predicted probabilities of fall-\ning into each of the ordered categories, estimated separately\nfor women and men. The predicted probabilities presented in\nTables 7 and 8 were calculated by setting all of the explana-\ntory variables at their means and then calculating the proba-\nbility of falling into each of the ordered categories, using the\nrelative odds formula from the ordered logit model (Greene,\n1993). This allows us to isolate the effect of one variable at a\ntime, by changing its value and then recalculating the proba-\nbilities while holding all other variables at their mean values.\nThe first row of Tables 7 and 8 shows the predicted distri-\nbution of women and men, respectively, across the probabil-\nity groups. The other rows show how the probability distri-\nbution changes as the value of some specific variable\nchanges. For example, the results indicate mat the predicted\ndistribution of nursing home use among women shifts to-\nward lower expectations as the number of children increases,\nperhaps reflecting their expectations that children will pro-\nvide care if needed. Alternatively, when a respondent sees\nthat their parents have used a nursing home, the distribution\nof perceived nursing home risks shifts to the right. Persons\nliving in an urban area or outside the South perceive a higher\nnursing home risk, perhaps reflecting greater access to nurs-\ning homes or unmeasured health differences in these areas.\nBlack men and married men perceive that they face lower\nnursing home risks. More education, which was significant\nfor women but not men, increases uncertainty about nursing\nhome care; that is, more educated persons are more uncertain\nabout future nursing home use.\nTable 7.

Women perceive that they are at greater risk for nursing\nhome entry if they are overweight, are not a current\nsmoker, or if their health has recently worsened. The pre-\ndicted probabilities for men illustrate the differential effects\nof \"early mortality\" and \"long-term disability\" conditions:\nA greater number of early mortality conditions moves the\ndistribution away from uncertainty toward certain nonuse,\nwhile a greater number of long-term disability conditions\nand worsening health increases perceived risk for men.\nWhile the results described above are informative, they\ndo not show how nursing home expectations are influenced\nby the presence of multiple risk factors. To illustrate the im-\nportance of combined risk factors, we construct two hypo-\nthetical individuals -- one with characteristics that are\nlikely to make them a \"high risk\" individual and the other\nwith characteristics that are likely to make them a \"low risk\"\nindividual -- and compare their predicted nursing home ex-\npectations. Low- and high-risk cases have variables set at\nmean, except for the following. A low-risk case is described\nas a person who has five children, has less than a high\nschool education, lives in the South, has parents who did not\nuse nursing homes, whose health is not getting worse, and\nwho is not obese. A high-risk case is a person who has no\nchildren, has some college education, does not live in the\nSouth, has parents who used a nursing home, whose health\nis getting worse, and is obese. The results of this exercise\nare reported in the last rows of Tables 7 and 8. The results\nshow dramatically that an individual with fewer risk factors\nis likely to have lower expectations of nursing home use.\nWhile only illustrative, this exercise indicates that nursing\nhome expectations may vary across individuals as the num-\nber of risk factors varies, and in ways that we would expect.\nDISCUSSION\nThis study finds support for all three hypotheses posited\nhere. It is found that respondents to the Health and Retire-\nment Study (HRS) form expectations that are roughly consis-\ntent with observed frequency of lifetime use of nursing\nhomes found in other studies, although respondents also indi-\ncate considerable uncertainty about these expectations. In ad-\ndition, respondents form expectations about nursing home\nuse in rational ways, using information available to them to\nform expectations that are consistent with their characteristics\nand especially with characteristics found in the nursing home\nliterature to be important risk factors for nursing home entry.\nFinally, the nursing home expectations for men and\nwomen differ in ways that are consistent with their proba-\nble determinants of actual future use. In particular, while\nexpectations on nursing home use are on average the same\nfor women and men, the underlying process that shapes\nthose expectations takes account of different factors. Both\nmen and women appear to incorporate differential mortality\nrisk into their nursing home expectations. Married men, who\nare likely to die before their spouses, have relatively low ex-\npected probabilities of nursing home use. In contrast, the\ncurrent availability of a spouse does not appear to influence\nthe nursing home expectations of women. Instead, women\ntake into account the number of children when forming ex-\npectations. While health conditions influence expectations\nfor men, health conditions have a smaller effect on the nurs-\ning home expectations for women. Instead, other factors,\nsuch as family history of nursing home use, family structure,\nand education, appear to be the strongest predictors of nurs-\ning home expectations for women. This probably reflects the\nunpredictability at this early stage of life of the onset of\nchronic, age-related conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease,\nincontinence) that lead to nursing home entry late in life.\nThese results are important for several reasons. First, ex-\npectations of nursing home use are likely to influence sav-\nings for retirement, insurance purchase, and the allocation of\nassets (Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes, 1995). If nursing\nhome use is widely anticipated, individuals may attempt to\nsave during their working years in order to ensure the ability\nto pay for quality care. Anticipating the need for long-term\ncare, individuals may respond to the availability of long-\nterm care insurance, purchase Medicaid-exempt assets (e.g.,\nbuying and retaining more expensive housing), or give inter\nvivos transfers to children as part of an intrafamily care con-\ntract. Understanding expectations of nursing home use is re-\nquired in order to predict both the demand for formal\nlong-term care services and the effect of public policy aimed\nat ensuring adequate provision of alternative forms of care.\nThis study's analysis is exploratory and there are some\nlimitations of these findings. The data have been available\nonly recently, and further investigation is expected. Since it\nappears that respondents are reflecting considerable uncer-\ntainty in their responses to the expectations questions, ex-\nploring the origins of this uncertainty with further detailed\nquestions seeking further elaboration would be very useful.\nThe responses to the question on expected long-term care\nuse appear reasonable and reflect factors that are known\nfrom the literature to affect actual use. Thus, we also con-\nclude that these expectation questions -- even about an\nevent far into the future -- may provide potentially useful\ninformation about how expectations about nursing home\nuse and costs may be linked to savings and retirement\npreparation. We propose that the HRS ask this question of\nthe full sample in a future wave. Insight into the influence\nof these expectations on savings, insurance purchase, and\nliving arrangements requires a far larger sample than is\navailable from an experimental module. If these questions\nare asked several times over the HRS period (though not\nnecessarily in each interview), investigators will be able to\ntrack how these expectations change as the sample ages,\nhow changes in expectations influence retirement planning,\nand the predictive accuracy of these questions over time as\nwe observe individuals entering long-term care facilities.\n"
