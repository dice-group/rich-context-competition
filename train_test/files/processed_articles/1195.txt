In particular, because\nphysical and laboratory examinations occurred in mobile ex-\namination centers, inclement weather was an issue during data\ncollection. To avoid these issues and improve response, the\nNHANES mobile examination centers preferentially sched-\nuled data collection in the lower latitudes (further south) dur-\ning the winter months and in higher latitudes (further north)\nduring the summer months, a strategy that was used consis-\ntently in all years of NHANES data collection.\nBlood samples for serum 25(OH)D testing collected during the\nexamination were centrifuged, divided into aliquots, and frozen\nto -70\u00b0C on site and then shipped on dry ice to central labora-\ntories, where they were stored at -70\u00b0C until analysis. Serum 25\n(OH)D levels were measured by a radioimmunoassay kit after ex-\ntraction with acetonitrile (DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minnesota) by the\nNational Center for Environmental Health (Atlanta, Georgia). Be-\ncause risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency have been exten-\nsively explored in previous NHANES analyses,30 we focused the\ncurrent analysis on self-reported age, sex, and race/ethnicity col-\nlected during the household interview to evaluate changes in pre-\nviously documented demographic disparities in vitamin D insuf-\nficiency.31,32 Becausethemonthofdatacollectionwasnotpublicly\ndentiality), we did not record or control for season.\nANALYSIS\nWe performed statistical analyses using commercially available\nsoftware (Stata, version 9.0; StataCorp, College Station, Texas).\nUsing survey commands, we applied the recommended sub-\nsample weights for the interview plus examination data to ac-\ncount for unequal probabilities of selection and to represent ac-\ncurate estimates for the US population.

In addition,\ndecreased outdoor activity and obesity have been associ-\nated with vitamin D insufficiency.30,36 The increased inac-\ntivity and obesity in the US population has likely contrib-\nuted to the observed rise in vitamin D insufficiency.37\nPreviously published data suggested that vitamin D\ninsufficiency was more prevalent among older adults (ow-\ning to reduction of 7-dehydrocholesterol levels in skin),\nwomen (owing to lower outdoor activity), and individu-\nWe found that previous differences by age and sex have\nequalized, but those by race/ethnicity have remained. The\nloss of age- and sex-related differences may be second-\nary to disproportionately greater time indoors (eg, with\ntelevision, computers, and video games) and less time out-\ndoors among younger compared with older individuals\nand males compared with females.\nAlthough socioeconomic status, health care access, life-\nstyle, and cultural factors contribute to racial/ethnic dis-\nparities in disease incidence and outcomes,38 vitamin D in-\nsufficiency may provide a plausible biological explanation\nfor health differences. In particular, black and, to a lesser\nextent, Hispanic Americans have a markedly higher preva-\nlence of vitamin D insufficiency and higher incidence and\nworse outcomes for cardiovascular disease, certain can-\ncers, diabetes mellitus, and renal disease, all of which have\nbeen linked to vitamin D insufficiency.22,26,38 Indeed, Wolf\net al39 recently reported that, compared with white pa-\ntientsundergoingdialysis,mortalitywas16%lowerinblack\npatients receiving vitamin D supplements but 35% higher\nin black patients not receiving supplements.

In addition,\nalthough not specifically evaluated in this analysis, rec-\nommendations by season and latitude (ie, higher supple-\nmentation in the winter and at higher latitudes) would\nlikely be more effective.\nThis study has some potential limitations. First, meth-\nodologic explanations for the increased prevalence of vi-\ntamin D insufficiency should be considered. However, data\nwere collected by the same group (the National Center for\nHealth Statistics) using similar methods, a similar sam-\nplingtechnique,andthesame25(OH)Dassay,whichmake\nthis unlikely.

Additional poten-\ntial limitations are that the demographic information was\nself-reported and that other factors associated with vita-\nmin D insufficiency were not analyzed (eg, season, lati-\ntude, estimated sunlight exposure, and diet). However, be-\ncause determinants of vitamin D insufficiency have been\nwell described, the purpose of our analysis was to exam-\nine the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in the US\npopulation.\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe found that the mean serum 25(OH)D level in the US\nated with an overall increase in vitamin D insufficiency\nTable 2.
