Progress towards a full understanding of the nature of an encounter\nwith art, therefore, depends on deepening our understanding of the complex interplay\namong these factors and processes. However, given the many factors known to contribute\nto the cognitive and emotional reactions to an artwork, one might assume that it would\nbe very difficult, if not impossible, for science to subject aesthetic phenomena to rigorous\nexperimental scrutiny and identify the underlying interactive processes involved. But, in\nfact, researchers in the field of experimental aesthetics have in recent years begun to make\ntremendous strides in doing just that due in large part to the application in aesthetic science\nof recent advances in computer technology and electronics. Neuroimaging techniques\nand other psychophysical methods have also provided insights into biology's interactive\ncontribution to an aesthetic experience. This extensive body of knowledge has been used\nby theoreticians to create comprehensive information-processing stage models of aesthetic\nprocessing as well as frameworks describing the important variables that influence a viewer's\ninteraction with art.\nThe purpose of this essay is to provide the reader with a brief overview of some of\nthese recent person-artifact relational models. Additionally, I highlight three experimental\ntechniques at the forefront of the field of experimental aesthetics to illustrate how contem-\nporary aesthetic science is contributing to an evaluation, clarification, and extension of these\nframeworks. They include the investigation of viewers' body postural adjustments to depicted\nmovement in paintings, the use of hand-held computers known as personal data assistants\nto record audience members' on-going emotional reactions to live performances of dance,\nand the contribution of audio tour information to museum visitors' interaction with and\naesthetic evaluation of sculptures and paintings. This article is a very truncated version of a\nmuch more detailed account of the state of the art of contemporary experimental aesthetics,\nincluding models, experimental techniques, and findings, published in two chapters by this\nauthor (Locher in press\u00ada, in press\u00adb).\n2 Contemporary models accounting for aesthetic experience with visual art forms\nConceptual models and frameworks that have appeared in the literature to explain\naesthetic judgment and appreciation of visual art tend to focus on either the factors\nthat influence aesthetic experience or the underlying neural, perceptual, and cognitive\nprocesses involved in such an experience. Jacobsen (2006) has proposed a framework for\nthe psychological study of aesthetic processing of artworks that consists of seven multilevel\nand highly interrelated factors that should be investigated when studying the nature of\nan aesthetic experience. These factors, which have been identified by a long history of\nexperimental research, include: (1) the Body or biology's contribution to our understanding\nof aesthetics revealed chiefly by recent advances in cognitive neuroscience; (2) the structural\nqualities, or Content, of the artifact; (3) the Person's individual processing characteristics\nand preferences; (4) the time and place at which an aesthetic experience occurs, that is, the\nSituation; (5) changes in aesthetic behavior over time (Diachronia) from the perspective\nof evolutionary biology and cultural and ontogenetic development; (6) the vantage point\nof comparisons within a given time segment (Ipsichronia) with focus on social processes,\ncultures, and sub-cultures; and (7) the Mind as represented by contemporary psychological\ntheories and models accounting for aesthetic experience with art. Of course, no one study can\nincorporate all of these factors into its research design, and many investigations including\ndifferent combinations of the various factors are needed before a comprehensive explanation\nof how an aesthetic experience with a certain type of artifact can be achieved.\nBacci (2011) has recently written that the aesthetic object that one contemplates as an\nobserver is the result of the complex interaction of many of the same factors included in\nJacobsen's (2006) framework. She suggests that because of this complexity, it may in fact be\nvirtually impossible to fully evaluate the behavior and aesthetic reaction of an observer in\nfront of original art in a museum or an electronic or paper reproduction of it in a setting\nsuch as a research laboratory. One key reason for this according to Bacci is that the viewer\nof an artwork lacks a \"period eye\". This concept, introduced by the art historian Michael\nBaxandall (1972), asserts that people living within a certain historical time and culture share\nways of thinking that influence how they perceive, understand, and respond to visual images,\nincluding art. Thus, Bacci asserts that we can be certain that the cognitive mechanisms of\nRembrandt's contemporaries, to take one artist as an example, triggered by the perception of\none of his paintings functioned in a significantly different way when compared with museum\nvisitors looking at this work today. With respect to viewers interacting with art created\nin the modern period for which they have a period eye, a considerable body of research\ndemonstrates that yet another similar factor, which might be called an \"aesthetically fluent\neye,\" influences the way viewers experience art produced during their lifetimes. Aesthetic\nfluency, a concept introduced by Smith and Smith (2006), is defined as the knowledge base\nthat a person has about art and aspects of life closely related to art that has been acquired both\nformally (ie, through training in the arts) and through life experiences with art. Additionally,\nBacci points out that researchers, for the most part, don't have art historical background\ninformation for the artworks they use as stimuli. These include such issues as an artist's\nintentions for creating a work and his intended message. Nor do they have the original\nContemporary experimental aesthetics 699\nviewing conditions for an original artwork such as its final placement, lighting conditions,\nand distance from the observer.\nMost of these and other limitations to the acquisition of valid findings in the field of\nexperimental aesthetics outlined by Bacci, especially those related to art historical issues,\nhave been addressed by the new and very innovative Parallellepipeda project describe by\nWagemans (2011) elsewhere in this special issue. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 described in his pa-\nper illustrate very nicely the primary goal of this new form of experimental aesthetics, namely,\ncollaboration between scientists and artists to generate research questions concerning the\nnature of an aesthetic experience with art and the art stimuli, procedures, and methodologies\nto implement their studies. Wagemans points out that this approach produces results that\ndo full justice to the artworks used as stimuli and the artist's intentions for creating these\nworks using traditional scientific methods of enquiry. While Bacci may still be right that it is\nimpossible to fully evaluate the behavior and aesthetic reaction of an observer to art, the new\nexperimental aesthetics typified by the Parallellepipeda project, and also by the eMotion:\nMapping Museum Experience research project described below, will certainly bring us closer\nto a comprehensive understanding of the nature of an experience with art.\nOther models of aesthetic experience focus on the underlying mechanisms responsible\nfor aesthetic appreciation while taking into account the role of the factors that influence the\ninterplay of these mechanisms. Leder et al (2004) have published a detailed multicomponent\ninformation-processing model that describes the interactions between a sequence of five\nperceptual and cognitive processing stages that occur across the time course of a viewer's\nencounter with abstract art. The model also incorporates the influence on these processes of\nseveral variables involved in aesthetic experience, including the affective state of an observer;\nobserver characteristics such as personal taste, interests, and domain specific knowledge;\nand the museum as context. The two outputs of the model are aesthetic emotions and\naesthetic judgments.\nSome of the same frameworks used to explain an observer's experience with art have\nbeen applied formally to a user's interaction with and emotional reaction to a design product\n(see, eg, Norman 2004). Recently, however, the rise in development of interactive electronic\nproducts has been accompanied in the design field by a growing interest in the aesthetics\nof interactive systems--and not just of the appearance of artifacts, the traditional focus of\nthe aesthetics of design. According to this view, the aesthetics of an artifact emerge out of\na dynamic interaction between the user of an interactive product and the product and is\nan integral part of what has been labeled an aesthetic interaction. Recently, Locher et al\n(2010) published a theoretical information-processing framework for understanding the\nnature of a user's aesthetic interaction with design products that incorporates factors that\nmoderate the processes that underlie an aesthetic experience with art described above.\nAdditionally, because interaction with a product involves the simultaneous use of visual and\nhaptic (exploratory touch) perception, the framework explains how handling an object can\nadd to the perception and aesthetic evaluation of an artifact beyond vision's contribution.\n(Auditory qualities of many artifacts also contribute to the aesthetics of a multisensory\ninteraction, but this modality is not incorporated in the model.) Thus, the notion of aesthetic\ninteraction and the research studies it has generated that use the same techniques employed\nin the field of experimental aesthetics (see, eg, Frens 2006) deserve mention in this essay\nbecause they are expanding the understanding of the nature of an aesthetic experience with\nartifacts beyond art forms.\n3 Studying the multifaceted processes underlying aesthetic experience\nA primary goal of investigators working in the field of experimental aesthetics is to\nunderstand the components and underlying mechanisms responsible for aesthetic apprecia-\ntion. This is achieved using empirical approaches and techniques that generate continuous\nresponse data across the time course of an encounter with art. The study of an observer's eye\nfixation patterns as he or she looks at and responds to an artwork has provided this type of\ndata for many years, starting with the pioneering work in this field conducted by Guy Thomas\nBuswell (1935), which he described in his book How People Look at Pictures. Eye movement\nstudies continue to make substantial contributions to the understanding of how viewers look\nNeuroimaging techniques have been shown in recent years to be important tools in every\narea of the arts to help localize and connect the components of an aesthetic process with\nspecific events in the brain (see reviews of this literature by Skov and Vartanian 2008 and\nShimamura and Palmer in press). They have opened up a window into biology's contribution\nto aesthetics, and some (eg, Tallis 2008) have argued that the future understanding of\naesthetics is to be found in neurology. Massey (2009) cautions, however, that neuroscience is\nmore effective in the analysis of component processes than in their synthesis--that is, neural\ndata can reveal the components of an aesthetic experience, but they are much less successful\nin understanding how these components interact to produce an aesthetic experience or why\none artwork is perceived to be more beautiful than another.\n3.1 Measuring viewers' reactions to art using computerized dynamic posturography\nIn addition to neuroimaging techniques, computerized dynamic posturography is a tech-\nnique with great untapped potential to measure physiologically a viewer's reaction to art\nduring an aesthetic experience. This is a non-invasive system that quantifies and records\nbody sway in real time originally developed for use in the diagnosis of balance disorders\nand in physical therapy and postural re-education. The body is not perfectly still when\none is looking at an object or some aspect of the visual world. Rather, continuous postural\nadjustments are made that involve the dynamic coupling of sensory, motor, and cognitive\nprocesses to control and maintain posture and balance. Time series data are recorded as a\nviewer stands on an instrumented platform, or force plate, connected to sensitive detectors\nthat measure changes in the weight exerted on the surfaces of the two feet. Changes in\nexcursion of the center of pressure of the body, instantaneously adjusted for a person's height\nand weight, distance from the source of stimulation, and base rate, are recorded in both the\nanterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. Speed of body sway and the pressure on the\nsoles of each foot are also recorded.\nThe study of postural adjustments to the structural elements and compositional organi-\nzation of paintings can provide a physiological measure of a viewer's reactions temporally to\nthese pictorial characteristics and artistic universals. To date, however, only one published\ninvestigation has tapped the potential of this technique for experimental aesthetics. Kapoula\net al (2011) conducted investigations into the effects of pictorial depth in paintings on body\nsway. In one study participants freely explored two reproductions of abstract paintings by\nMaria Elena Vieira Da Silva (Egypt and O Quarto Cinzento), each of which provides a vivid\nperception of recessed space as well as an altered cubist transformation of each work that\nremoved the sense of depth seen in the originals. Throughout the experiment participants\nwere required to maintain a quiet, constant stance by holding their arms at their sides and\nrefraining from speaking, clenching their teeth, or making body movements of any kind. It\nwas found that viewing the original paintings significantly increased postural sway relative to\ntheir manipulated cubist versions: that is, greater sway was recorded for the works containing\nthe greater intensity of visual depth cues--the originals. In a second experiment Kapoula et\nContemporary experimental aesthetics 701\nal found a significantly greater increase in body sway when observers were asked to fixate\nthe principal background area versus the foreground of Piero della Francesca's painting the\nAnnunciatio, a work whose structural organization provides a powerful representation of\nperspective and a sense of recessed space in the pictorial field. Thus, pictorial depth cues in\nboth abstract and representational paintings differentially produce postural instability in\nviewers.\nTo follow up on this line of research Professor Kapoula and I have recently conducted\nan investigation of the effects of another compositional property of paintings--depicted\npictorial movement--on viewers' postural body movements. If any compositional feature\nof a painting should produce postural sway, it most likely would be depicted movement.\nMany methods are used to achieve movement in a painting and give it a sense of kinetic or\ndynamic energy. These range from the global properties of a composition, such as the scene\nor event it represents, to the lively character and direction of brush strokes employed (Cutting\n2002). Our art stimuli consisted of two paintings by Monet entitled in English Study of a\nFigure Outdoors--Facing Left and Study of a Figure Outdoors--Facing Right. They differ in\ndegree of depicted motion produced by the force of the wind but are very similar in content,\ncomposition, color, and image size. In both paintings a woman, who is the primary feature\nof interest in both works, is standing at the top of a grassy knoll and the wind is depicted as\nblowing from right to left as indicated by the pictorial cues for perceived movement generated\nby the clouds, the woman's scarf and dress, and vegetation. Each painting was shown in\nits original orientation and as a mirror-image reversal of it to examine the influence of the\nlateral organization of implied motion cues which has been shown to influence aesthetic\npreference of paintings.\nParticipants' body movements were recorded as they viewed an artwork shown in one of\nthe four painting by lateral orientation conditions. They performed an attention-demanding\ntask that consisted of examining the painting for as long as they wished to obtain the informa-\ntion needed to describe it to someone who had never seen it. The apparatus, procedure, and\ntype of data collected were the same as those employed by Kapoula et al (2011). Additionally,\nparticipants rated the degree of depicted movement on a 10-point scale after viewing the\npainting and described its content, which was recorded. Preliminary analyses of the body\nmovement data revealed that, as expected, body postural adjustments were significantly\nmore pronounced for the composition containing a higher degree of depicted motion. It was\nalso observed that participants' body weight was distributed differently across the two feet\nwhen viewing the original versus its mirror-image. A manuscript describing the complete set\nof results is under preparation for publication in a separate paper.\nResults of the two studies demonstrate that posturography can provide insights into\nthe effects of the applications of fundamental principles of pictorial composition, such as\nthe use of depth and depicted motion cues as in the studies described, on the perceived\nqualities of artworks as measured by their physiological effects on a viewer. In so doing,\nthey demonstrate that viewers can be figuratively \"moved\" by an artwork. In addition,\nthese findings provide physiological support for the notion of \"offline embodied cognition\".\nThere are several theories of the nature of embodied cognition (see Wilson [2002] for a\nreview of these theories), but the underlying notion is that cognition relies heavily on\nbodily states--that is, cognitive representations and operations are intimately tied to the\nrelevant sensory-motor processes required to interact with the environment. Cognitive\nactivity that operates directly on real world environments with objects present is called\n\"online embodiment\". \"Offline embodiment\" occurs when processing is decoupled from\nthe environment, as when modality-specific systems are engaged even when an object or\nsituation is absent and represented by a symbol such as a picture, as was the case for the\npaintings used in these studies. Finally, in future experiments we will simultaneously record\ncontinuous data of viewers' body movements and their eye movements as they look at a\npainting, thereby making it possible to determine with a high degree of spatial resolution the\nimpact of specific pictorial features and the overall structural organization of an artwork on\nbody sway across an aesthetic experience with it.\n3.2 Hand-held personal data assistants\nIndividuals' responses to the temporally unfolding arts such as dance, theater, and especially\nmusic have received research interest for many decades. Most often, perceivers' perceptual,\ncognitive, and emotional reactions to these art forms were recorded in laboratory settings\nas they viewed pre-recorded stimuli. Results obtained using this research approach, while\nensuring experimental rigor, do not capture viewers' continuous reactions to the art form in\nthe presence of other perceivers or audience members in the naturalistic setting of a theater.\nAn electronic technique to study real-time audience responses to temporally unfolding art\nforms involves the use of hand-held personal data assistants or PDAs. Recent developments\nin hand-held computers coupled with wireless technology enable a researcher to record\npsychological responses from individual audience members viewing temporally unfolding\nlive artistic performances in naturalistic settings. PDAs now available are small, portable,\nrelatively inconspicuous, programmable, and make it possible for the data collected to be\ncollated and time-stamped for synchronization purposes with action on the stage. The\nparticipants in such studies move a hand held pen-like stylus or a joystick around a screen to\ngenerate input to the PDA as they view a performance.\nOne of the first studies to use this technique to study dance was conducted by Stevens\nand her colleagues (2009). They developed a portable audience response facility, a modified\nPDA system, to collect continuous response data from audience members during two\nlive performances of dance works. Their goal was to investigate audience perceptions of\nstructures and expressions in the dances and to compare these with the choreographer's\nartistic intentions for the choreography for his work. Continuous responses were measured\nin the first study from adults who had no experience in contemporary dance as they viewed a\n60-minute live performance of a contemporary dance piece. Participants in the second study\nwere accustomed to attending live dance performances and reported enjoying watching\ndance. They too viewed a full-length live ballet that varied in the amount of activity on stage\nreflecting the themes struggle, achievement, reflectiveness, and loss.\nParticipants in both studies were given a practice session prior to the performance to\nacquaint them with use of the system. It should be noted they reported that use of the PDA\ndid not distract them from the performance, and they found it very user-friendly, potential\ndrawbacks for use of such a system during live performances. The PDA recorded continuous\ndata simultaneously for two dimensions of expressed emotion as the performance took\nplace; a valence scale (positive\u00adnegative; happy\u00adsad) and an arousal or activity scale (active\u00ad\npassive). Participants were asked to rate their emotions based upon their experience of\nthe components of the entire performance, including the dancers' movements, the music,\nand the choreography. The continuous arousal data were mapped onto choreographic\nnotes from the choreographers of the two ballets indicating the key moments and intended\nstructural, musical, and emotional changes in the pieces. Stevens et al (2009) present a\ndetailed comparison of the connection between these variables across the time course of\nsegments of the ballet. In general, the researchers found that approximately 80% of the\ntime, the choreographers' intentions with respect to the expressive aspects of the dance and\nthe audiences' emotional responses were congruent. For example, greater activity by the\ndancers, such as acrobatics, and changes in musical material were associated with changes in\narousal and emotional responses, demonstrating a connection between audience emotional\nContemporary experimental aesthetics 703\nresponses and the surface features of the dance and music as well as the expressive aspects\nof the dancers' movements. Thus, Stevens et al's findings enable choreographers, dancers\nand researchers to see for the first time audience responses to dance works made in real\ntime during a live performance. The PDA is a tool capable of providing researchers and\nchoreographers a new perspective in understanding the cognitive and behavioral processes\nduring a temporally dependent visual art form.\n4 The museum as laboratory\nI turn now to a topic which I call the museum as laboratory and examples of the\napplication of recent advances in computers and other technologies in two museum studies.\nInvestigations of the perceptual and cognitive processes that underlie a museum visitor's\nexperience with art have until fairly recently been neglected by the fields of museology\nand experimental aesthetics. Research conducted in museums using original artworks as\nstimuli is essential to provide the external and ecological validity for findings of experimental\naesthetics studies, which typically present reproductions of art on computer screens and\nother presentation formats in laboratory settings. In this respect it is notable, and a relatively\nrare occurrence that the eye-movement studies conducted by Heidenreih and Turano\n(2011) and Kapoula et al (2009) mentioned earlier took place in museums. From a practical\nperspective, visitor-based investigations of the museum experience are critical because\nin the last 10 years museum culture has made a major shift from its traditional roles of\ncollection and preservation of artifacts and of scholarship to museums as public educational\ninstitutions. Yet, despite this shift, Jacobsen (2010) points out in an article entitled \"A research\nvision for museums\" published in a recent issue of Curator: The Museum Journal that\naudience researchers continue to focus their in-house investigations on such factors as\nattendance numbers, visitor behaviors, and satisfaction with the permanent collection and\nspecial exhibitions. For the most part they continue to neglect studying the underlying\nperceptual-cognitive processes responsible for the pleasure which accompanies the learning\nexperiences in art museums. As one example, an issue which has been debated among\ncurators for decades is the amount and type of information which should be provided with\neach artwork. To enhance the likelihood that museum goers will obtain the most pleasure\nand knowledge from their visit, museums use several methods to provide them with insight,\nhistory, anecdotal information, and provenance about the works in its collection. The most\ncommonly used methods to deliver information and interpretive content to enhance the\naesthetic experience include textural information presented with each artwork, guided tours\ntypically conducted by docents, and audio guide tours.\nResearch shows that most museum visitors like to have some organizing schematic\ninformation presented with works of art by these methods but not to be overwhelmed with\ninformation, and they also want freedom to interpret the art as they will. Furthermore, visitors\ndesire a balance between the physical organization and \"mental\" structure of a gallery or\nexhibition and their freedom to explore the artworks according to their own organizing\nschematic notions about the art. The impact of these factors changes according to the style\nof a work of art viewed (eg, abstract versus representational works), the amount and type\nof information presented, and the characteristics and aesthetic fluency of a viewer. In the\npast, this complex interaction of factors could not be fully taken into consideration by a\nmuseum using the audio systems available; until relatively recently, the audio experience\nwas structured for the \"average visitor\" in a linear, non-interactive fashion for a limited\nnumber of artworks. Recent technological advances with hand-held computers have made\nit possible for museums to organize audio guide augmented tours in such a way that they\nprovide visitors with personalized choices in the amount, types, and depth of information\nthey receive about a work, as well as the freedom to navigate a collection of artworks as\nthey choose. Thus, audio tours have the potential to strike a balance between freedom and\nstructure in the visit of each museum goer.\n4.1 Audio tour augmentation in museums\nTo date, there is relatively little empirical research on the contribution of audio augmentation\nto the museum experience using the new electronic technology available for such tours. A\nnotable exception is one of a series of studies conducted by Jeffrey Smith and his colleagues\n(Smith et al 2004; Smith and Tinio 2010) at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York,\none of the world's foremost collections of 20th-century American art. This study examined\nthe impact of the museum's approach to providing audio tour information in a controlled\nin-situ experiential fashion. Museum visitors completed a survey after experiencing one of\nfour art works (two sculptures and two paintings) under three treatment conditions. The\ntwo paintings were George Bellow's Dempsey and Firpo and Arshile Gorky's The Artist and\nHis Mother and the two sculptures were Chris Burden's America's Darker Moments and Yayoi\nKusama's Accumulation. Burden's work consists of five separate pieces that represent events\nin American history (eg, events at Kent State and My Lai) using small metal sculptures. The\nKusama sculpture is a white chair that has been covered with dozen of phallic-shaped white\nstuffed bags. The three treatment conditions were: standard (the museum's standard label\nconsisting of the work's title, artist, date, and acquisition information), label (a label written\nexpressly for the study to present typical art historical and stylistic information), and audio\n(information specific to each work and its artist). Data for several dependent measures\nevaluating participants' experiences with each artwork were obtained.\nSmith and his colleagues (2004, 2010) report that participants spent up to three times\nlonger in front of works when using the audio tour than was the case for the other two\nconditions. The researchers note that some of this difference can be attributed to difference\nin the amount of information presented, especially between the standard and audio tour\nconditions. Nevertheless, the important issue here is that use of the audio guide keeps the\nobserver's visual input focused on the work of art as opposed to diverting his or her attention\nto read a label. Additionally, it was found that participants said they would like to see more\nof the works by a given artist when his work was experienced in the audio condition than\nwhen it was seen in the standard condition. This was especially the case for the Kusama and\nBurden sculptures, which are more difficult to understand than the paintings and probably\nrequire more interpretive help to be appreciated. The specific information presented in\nthe audio guide for these works provided a cognitive schema or structure for looking at\nand understanding these works. It should be noted that the Burden piece commanded\nthe longest stay in each of the three conditions, which the researchers suggest might be\nattributable to the amount of information in the piece if a viewer treated it as five separate\nworks. Furthermore, visitors indicated that they enjoyed their visit much more because of\nthe audio tour, that they did not find it too impersonal, and they would use it again during\ntheir next visit.\nOne negative influence of the audio guide approach was that it appears to focus attention\non only certain features and aspects of a work and away from others. Participants were\nasked questions about some things that were not mentioned in the audio stop information.\nFor example, those who saw the Bellows work were asked about the color of the ceiling\nin the painting. What was found was that with each of the four artworks, participants in\nthe standard and label conditions were better able to answer questions about the works\nthan people in the audio condition. Attention was directed toward certain aspects of a\nwork, and away from others, by the information provided in audio stop. Thus, too much\nstructure might not be optimal, at least in the present circumstances. Additional research is\nContemporary experimental aesthetics 705\nnecessary to identify the factors that must be taken into consideration to make audio guide\naugmentation provide a more successful museum experience, especially as it continues to\nadvance rapidly from a technological perspective. From a practical perspective, it has the\npotential to provide an experience tailored to each visitor--one that takes into consideration\nhis or her characteristics as well as the type of museum being visited (see Mastandrea et al\n2009). From a theoretical perspective, studies of audio augmented tours can be designed to\nprovide insights into the nature of the perceptual-cognitive and evaluative processes that\nunderlie an aesthetic experience outlined in the frameworks mentioned above.\n4.2 The eMuseum: Mapping museum experience\nFinally, mention should be made about a project in progress called eMotion: Mapping\nMuseum Experience, which has already shown its potential to make a major contribution\nto the understanding of the complex interaction of factors that contribute to a museum\nvisitor's experience (described in Tr\u00f6ndle and Tschacher [2010] and Tschacher et al [2011]\nand http://www.mapping-museum-experience.com). The project, which uses innovative\ntechnical devices (described below), is designed to examine how the museum context, the\nart objects, curatorship, and the visitor affect his or her behavior and experiences. The large\ntransdisciplinary team conducting the research project at the Kunstmuseum St. Gallen in\nSwitzerland consists of collaborators with expertise in art psychology, art sociology, art theory,\nmuseum visitor studies, curatorial practice, industrial design, and technical programming.\nVisitors who volunteer to take part in the study are given a wrist band to wear that contains\nseveral measurement and signalling sensors. These make possible the precise quantitative\nmeasurement of the path each individual takes through the museum, his or her speed,\nthe time spent in front of each artwork, and when and how strong an emotional arousal\nand a cognitive arousal occurred. Each person also completes qualitative questionnaires\ndesigned to enable the transdisciplinary team of researchers to interpret the vast collection\nof data obtained electronically. Another innovative feature implemented by the study is that\nparticipants have the opportunity to view moments of their own course through the eMotion\ninstallation played back through cartographic representation. This provides self-insight into\ntheir behaviors and enables visitors to reflect on the nature of their museum experience.\nThis research group has recently published results of one study and a list of many other\nmanuscripts \"in press\" is contained in the project's website given above. Museum goers in\nTschacher et al's (2011) investigation wore electronic gloves through which their locomotion,\nskin conductance, and heart rate were continuously monitored as they explored 76 works\nof modern and contemporary art in seven galleries. After completing their visit the 373\nadult volunteers completed a 19-item questionnaire for each of six works, three artworks\nselected in advance by the researchers and three paintings in front of which a participant\nspent the most time. Items in the questionnaire assessed emotions evoked by a painting,\naesthetic evaluation of it, and the viewer's general appraisal of it. Tschacher et al found that\nphysiological responses recorded during perception of an artwork were significantly related\nto aesthetic-emotional experiences with a work. Specifically, the dimensions \"aesthetic\nquality,\" \"dominance,\" \"surprise/humor,\" and curatorial quality\" were associated with the\ncardiac measures heart-rate level and variability and skin conductance variability. The\nresearchers point out that their findings provide the first evidence that aesthetics can be\nempirically grounded in viewers' physiology in an ecologically valid context, the fine art\nmuseum.\n5 Conclusion\nThere is strong agreement among theoreticians and researchers working in the field\nof psychology of art that an aesthetic experience with a visual art form is the result of a\ncomplex interplay of many factors and processes. The new experimental aesthetics--to\nborrow from the title of Berlyne's 1974 classic work--typified by the research techniques and\nprojects described in this essay have already shown their impressive potential to deepen\nour understanding of the nature of aesthetic experiences and emotions with different visual\nart forms within different contexts. Bacci (2011) may be correct in her assertion that it is\nimpossible to fully evaluate the behavior and aesthetic reaction of an observer in front of\noriginal art in a museum, given the complex interplay of factors involved. But this author\nbelieves that the state of the art of contemporary experimental aesthetics research will bring\nthe field very close to this goal.\nReferences\nBacci F, 2011 \"Eye-movements and Piero's gaze: An art historical perspective\" Esth\u00e9tique et Complexit\u00e9:\nCr\u00e9ation, Exp\u00e9rimentations et Neurosciences (Paris, France: CNRS \u00c9ditions)\nBaxandall M, 1972 Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy (Oxford, UK: Oxford University\nPress)\nBerlyne D, 1974 Studies in the New Experimental Aesthetics: Steps Toward an objective Psychology of\nAesthetic Appreciation (New York: John Wiley & Sons)\nBuswell G T, 1935 How People Look at Pictures (Chicago, IL: The University of Chicago Press)\nCutting J, 2002 \"Representing motion in a static image: Constraints and parallels in art, science, and\nFrens J, 2006 Designing for Rich Interaction: Integrating Form, Interaction, and Function, PhD Dis-\nsertation, Eindhoven University of Technology\nHeidenreih S, Turano K, 2011 \"Where does one look when viewing artwork in a museum?\" Empirical\nJacobsen T, 2006 \"Bridging the arts and sciences: A framework for the psychology of aesthetics\"\nKapoula Z, Adenis M S, L\u00ea T T, Yang Q, Lipede G, 2011 \"Pictorial depth increases body sway\"\nKapoula Z, Daunys G, Herbez O, Yang Q, 2009 \"Effect of title on eye-movement exploration of cubist\nLeder H, Belke B, Oeberst A, Augustin D, 2004 \"A model of aesthetic appreciation and aesthetic\nLocher P, in press\u00ada \"Contemporary experimental aesthetics: Procedures and findings\" Handbook\nof Economics of Art and Culture (Amsterdam: Elsevier/North Holland)\nLocher P, in press\u00adb \"Empirical investigation of an aesthetic experience with art\" Aesthetic Science:\nConnecting Minds, Brains, and Experience (Oxford: Oxford University Press)\nLocher P, Krupinski E, Mello-Thoms C, Nodine C, 2007 \"Visual interest in pictorial art during an\nLocher P, Overbeeke K, Wensveen S, 2010 \"Aesthetic interaction: A framework\" Design Issues 26\nMassey I, 2009 The Neural Imagination: Aesthetic and Neuroscientific Approaches to the Arts (Austin,\nTX: University of Texas Press)\nMastandrea S, Bartoli G, Bove G, 2009 \"Preferences for ancient and modern art museums: Visitor\nexperiences and personality characteristics\" Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts 3\nNorman D, 2004 Emotional Design (New York: Basic Books)\nShimamura A, Palmer S (Eds), in press Aesthetic Science: Concerning Minds, Brains, and Experience\n(Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press)\nSkov M, Vartanian O, 2008 Neuroaeesthetics (Amityville, NY: Baywood Publishing Co)\nSmith L, Smith J, 2006 \"The nature and growth of aesthetic fluency\" New Directions in Aesthetics,\nCreativity and the Arts (Amityville, NY: Baywood Publishing Company)\nSmith J, Tinio P, 2010 \"Audio augmentation of museums visits: Talking the walk\" (Unpublished\nmanuscript)\nContemporary experimental aesthetics 707\nSmith J, Waszkielewicz I, Potts K, Smith B, 2004 Visitors and the Audio Program: An Investigation into\nthe Impact of the Audio Guide Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York: The\nWhitney Museum of American Art)\nStevens C, Schubert E, Morris R H, Frear M, Chen J, Healey S, Schoknecht C, Hansen S, 2009\n\"Cognition and the temporal arts: Investigating audience response to dance using PDAs that\nrecord continuous data during live performance\" International Journal of Human-Computer\nTr\u00f6ndle M, Tschacher W, 2010 \"Design research as an artistic way of knowledge production\" Paper\npresented at the XXI Congress of the International Association of Empirical Aesthetics, Dresden,\nGermany\nTschacher W, Greenwood S, Volker K, Wintzerith S, van den Berg K, Tr\u00f6ndle M, 2011, \"Physiological\ncorrelates of aesthetic perception of artworks in a museum\" Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity,\nWagemans J, 2011 \"Towards a new kind of experimental psycho-aesthetics?
