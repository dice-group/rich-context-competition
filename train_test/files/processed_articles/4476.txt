Patients with traumatic\nhaemorrhage and/or parenchymal bleedings\nthat ruptured into the subarachnoid space\nwere excluded. Medical records including\nhospital notes, laboratory data (comprising\nroutine blood tests, blood biochemistry,\ncoagulation function, autoimmunity and\ntumour-related tests), and imaging results\n(including plain CT, CT angiography, MRI,\nmagnetic resonance angiography, magnetic\nresonance venography, and digital subtrac-\ntion angiography) were reviewed. Data relat-\ning to patient demographics, clinical\npresentation, and outcome were documented\nand collated. Patient follow-up data up to 30\nThe study was approved by the institu-\ntional review board of Peking University\nPatient informed consent was not con-\nsidered to be required due to the retrospect-\nive, observational nature of the study.\nResults\nOf 144 patients identified with spontaneous\nSAH, 14 fulfilled the criteria for nontrau-\nmatic cSAH. Demographic and clinical\ncharacteristics are shown in Table 1 and\nTable 2. The study cohort consisted of 10\nmale and four female patients (median age,\nexception of one 19-year-old female, all\npatients were > 45 years. Medical history\ndata revealed that the most common con-\ncomitant condition was hypertension (10\npatients). Two patients had experienced a\nprevious transient ischemic attack, one had\nexperienced a cerebral infarction, one had\nexperienced a previous SAH, and the remain-\ning 10 patients had no previous history of\ncerebral vascular disease (Table 2).\nClinical presentation\nHeadache was one of the most common\npresenting symptoms (8 patients) and\namong these patients, two had neck rigidity\nand none had a history of migraine. One of\nthe patients with headache (patient 10) also\nhad generalized seizures and although there\nwas no history of epilepsy and trauma, the\npatient responded well to anticonvulsants,\nand an MRI scan and magnetic resonance\nvenography showed the presence of a sig-\nmoid sinus thrombosis. Three other patients\nwith headache presented with unilateral\nweakness and numbness.\nEight patients presented with focal\nneurological deficits as the main symptom.\nTwo of these patients experienced transient\nweakness of both lower limbs and six\npatients had unilateral symptoms that per-\nsisted over 24 h. Six of the patients with\nneurological deficits had MRI scan images\navailable, and acute ischemic stroke was\nconfirmed in four patients. One 74-year-old\nfemale (patient 3) had reported experiencing\ndizziness, and the CT scan showed a left\nparietal lobe cSAH.\nImaging findings\nPlain CT scans were available for all 14\npatients with cSAH and showed that haem-\norrhages were typically unilateral (observed\nbetween one to three neighbouring sulci\n(Table 1). Two patients had bihemispheric\ninvolvement: a 56-year-old male (patient 11)\nwho was receiving warfarin for mesenteric\nvein thrombosis caused by phlebitis; and an\nmonths experienced a second cSAH attack\ninvolving the right frontal and parietal lobe\nsulci. The most common haemorrhage sites\nwere the parietal and frontal lobes, observed\nCranial MRIs were available for 11\npatients, of whom 10 had undergone diffu-\nsion-weighted MRI. Four patients were\nfound to have scattered acute subcortical\ninfarcts all of which were ipsilateral with the\ncSAH.

For two of these patients,\nscattered acute ischemic stroke was con-\nfirmed by MRI and the stroke infarcts and\ncSAH were in the same region of the narrow\narteries. Three patients had patent menin-\ngeal arteries confirmed by digital subtrac-\ntion angiography. One patient (patient 1), a\n58-year-old male, had A1 segment narrow-\ning in the left ACA to > 90% without open-\ning of the anterior communicating artery;\nthe second patient (patient 2) was a 60-year-\nold female with scans showing occlusion of\nthe right MCA and compensatory flow from\nthe ipsilateral ACA via the meningeal artery\n(Figure 2). This patient had total occlusion\nfrom the M1 segment of the right MCA.\nThe left ACA obtained blood supply from\nthe right internal carotid artery via the\nanterior communicating artery. The right\nMCA received compensatory feeding from\nthe ipsilateral ACA via the meningeal artery,\nand from the ipsilateral PCA via the\nmeningeal artery.

The\ncause of cSAH in patient 10 was cerebral\nvenous sinus thrombosis, and consequently\nthis patient began taking anticoagulants\nfollowing the cSAH. Patient 14 had a\nrepeat cerebral infarction one week after\nthe first event and received aspirin as anti-\nplatelet treatment. Patient 8 had a repeat\ncSAH in the same occlusion artery region\napproximately two years following the first\ncSAH. Patient 13, who had a cSAH in the\nbilateral frontal parietal lobe, had a repeat\ncSAH in the right parietal lobe approxi-\nmately six months later.\nThe cause of cSAH was identified in 11\npatients and remained undetermined in\ncarotid artery system atherosclerosis was the\nmost common cause of cSAH (n \u00bc 7,\n50.0%). For the remaining four patients,\ncSAH was caused by cerebral venous sinus\nthrombosis (patient 10), cerebrovascular\nmalformation (patient 9), anticoagulant\ntherapy (patient 11) or possible cerebral\namyloid angiopathy (patient 13).\nDiscussion\nOf 144 patients with SAH who attended\nPeking University Third Hospital between\nprevalence is higher than previously\nnumber of factors including the retrospect-\nive nature of the present study, which may\nhave led to selection bias. In addition, a\nradiologic database was used to identify\npatients with cSAH in the present study,\nrather than a diagnostic code, because the\nauthors believe that cSAH could easily be\nmissed, as coding may be inaccurate and\nlead to an underestimation of the condition.\nOverall, however, the present data agree\nwith other reports that show nontraumatic\ncSAH is a relatively rare condition in\nInternal carotid artery system atheroma-\ntous disease was the most common cause of\ncSAH in the present study, affecting 50%\npatients, and was higher than the previously\nreported prevalence of 33%.1 All of the\npresent cohort were acutely symptomatic\nsuggesting that cSAH may derive from an\nacute alteration in haemodynamics (e.g.,\nplaque rupture and/or further atherothrom-\nbotic narrowing or acute hypertension). In\naddition, all the present cases of cSAH were\nassociated with significant ipsilateral intra-\ncranial disease. Although a few cases of\ncSAH associated with symptomatic intra-\ncranial stenosis or occlusion have been\nreported,1,9,10 the pathologic mechanisms\nremain unclear. Despite carefully reviewing\nall imaging studies, no evidence of reversible\ncerebral vasoconstriction syndrome was\nfound in the present patient cohort.\nIn an observational study of 24 patients\nwith cSAH, five cases with concurrent ische-\nmic lesions were reported.14 In another study\ninvolving 15 patients with cSAH, five cases of\nconcomitant carotid artery stenosis were\npatients with acute stroke/transient ischemic\nattack involving eight (0.16%) patients with\ncSAH, five patients had occlusion of major\narteries and three were suggested as having\ncerebral amyloid angiopathy.5 Several studies\nhave suggested that cerebral amyloid angio-\npathy is a common cause of cSAH.1,3,5,6 In\nthe present study, nine patients had gradient\nrecalled echo T2*-weighted MRIs and none\nfulfilled the criteria for possible or probable\ncerebral amyloid angiopathy (including mul-\ntiple haemorrhages of varying sizes/ages with\nno other explanation, or a single lobar,\ncortical, or cortical/subcortical haemorrhage\nwithout another cause, multiple haemor-\nrhages with a possible but not a definite\ncause, or some haemorrhage in an atypical\nlocation).15 One patient in the present study,\nhowever, an 87-year-old male with recurrent\ncSAH, may have had cerebral amyloid\nangiopathy, but this could not be confirmed\ndue to lack of MRI scan or vessel imaging.\nAntithrombotic drug use has also been sug-\ngested to be associated with an increased risk\nof SAH,16 however, only one patient was\nfound in the present study, for whom antith-\nrombotic drug use may have accounted for\nthe cSAH.\nThe results of the present study may be\nlimited by several factors. First, the observa-\ntions were from a single tertiary care centre\nusing a small sample of patients, and thus,\nmay have been influenced by selection bias.\nSecondly, this was a retrospective study and\nnot all patients had undergone cerebral\nangiography and MRI, which meant data\nmay have been incomplete. Moreover, some\nsmall vascular malformations, small aneur-\nysms, focal venous thromboses, malignant\ntumours or vasculitis may have been missed.\nFinally, although no patients died during the\nhospitalisation period in the present study,\nthe lack of systematic follow-up for these\npatients made it difficult to infer accurate\nprognostic data for the present cohort. The\noutcome of cSAH appears to depend on the\nunderlying aetiology of the disease and age.6\nThus, a well-designed, prospective, case-con-\ntrolled, double-blind, multicentre study is\nrequired to overcome the shortcomings of\nthe present small study.\nIn conclusion, internal carotid artery\nsystem atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion\nwas the most common cause of cSAH in the\npresent study of 14 patients with cSAH.\nThe authors suggest that vascular radio-\ngraphic evaluation, particularly cervical\nvessel imaging, should be performed in all\npatients with cSAH so that a potentially\nfatal underlying vascular abnormality may\nnot be missed. Further prospective studies\nare needed to substantiate the present results\nand to investigate whether patients with\ncSAH and significant atheromatous disease\nshould be treated with antiplatelet therapy.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis study was supported by a grant from the\nScience and Technology Program of Beijing,\nReferences\n1.
