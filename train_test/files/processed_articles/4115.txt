    "abstract": "Abstract\nSpecular surfaces and refractive media are difficult to distinguish from each other because they\nboth generate distorted images of the surrounding lighting environment. Whereas convex\nrefractive objects invert the orientation of the horizon so the sky appears beneath the ground\nplane, convex specular surfaces preserve the orientation of the horizon so the sky appears above\nthe ground. Here, we show that a refractive transparent object can be made to appear specular\nand opaque simply by rotating the image by 180. This result suggests that the visual system relies\non information tied to the orientation of the horizon to distinguish between refractive and\nspecular objects.\n",

The most salient difference between the two materials is the orientation of the horizon,\nwhich is right side upfor the mirror sphere,but upsidedown for the glass sphere.The orientation\nof the horizon differs between the glass and mirror spheres because refraction and specular\nreflection project light in different directions relative to the surface normal (Figure 1, lower).\nSpecularly reflected light has a similar direction to the outward facing surface normal, which\nbisects the angle between the incident and specularly reflected rays. Refracted light, on the other\nhand, is bent toward the inward facing surface normal when it enters glass and is then bent away\nfrom the outward facing surface normal when returning to air.\nWe tested whether the orientation of the horizon functions as a cue for distinguishing\nbetween refractive media and reflective surfaces.

The\nsimulation parameters were based on measured data for K7 Crown glass preconfigured in\nthe rendering software. Relief perturbation was generated by displacing vertices in the radial\ndirection by distances determined by a cloud noise texture. The camera was situated 30.5 cm\nfrom the center of the object. We observe that the upright image (Figure 2(a)) generates a\ncompelling percept of transparency (as though it is constructed entirely from ice or glass),\nwhereas the inverted image (Figure 2(b)) is misperceived as more opaque and reflective.\nWe measured this image inversion effect by instructing eight nai\u00a8ve observers to rate the\nstrength of perceived transparency or opacity when the image was presented in upright and\ninverted orientations. The order of presentations was counterbalanced across observers.\nRatings were ordered metrically along a continuum from \u00c01.0 through 0 to \u00fe1.0. The\nextremity of the rating from zero conformed to the observer's confidence in their rating of\none material classification over the other (zero meaning complete ambiguity).\nFigure 2(c) shows mean ratings across all observers for the upright and inverted images.\nThe upright refractive object was judged as transparent and reflective with a mean rating of\n\u00c00.58 (SE \u00bc 0.12), whereas the surface in the inverted image was judged as opaque and\nreflective with a mean rating of \u00fe0.50 (SE \u00bc 0.05). Ratings were significantly different from\nzero-level uncertainty for the object depicted in both the upright image (t7\nand inverted image (t7\nFigure 1.

(b) A comparable purely specular version of the same 3D\nshape simulated in the same illumination environment. The HDR specular light probe of the UNSW Oval was\nsimulated in Blender 3D from three auto-exposure bracketed images on a Canon 5D Mark III with 180\nfisheye lens (see Debevec, 2002). Schematics illustrate the transport of light rays from the sky and ground\nfor refraction and reflectance below each image.\nsupporting the view that perceived transparency depends on the inferred orientation of the\nhorizon in the light field, assumed to be structured with prevailing illumination from above.\nAll observers indicated after their participation that the objects appeared globally convex.\nThis is important because concave specular surfaces will also generate an inverted image of\nthe horizon. For example, the convex specular sphere in Figure 1(b) can appear concave if its\nimage is viewed upside down. This observation suggests that perceived convexity and\nperceived reflectance codepend on one another. Therefore, the visual system would need to\naccount for perceived convexity of the object to derive surface reflectance from the apparent\norientation of the horizon.\nAnother distinguishing feature of refractive objects is the distortion field--patterns of\nmagnification and minification in the refracted structure of light. For a fixed 3D shape and\nlight field, increasing refractive index increases the amplitude of the distortion field and\nincreases ratings of the perceived refractive index (Fleming, Ja\n\u00a8 ter & Faul, 2014). However, increasing refractive index also reduces the\ncritical angle for total internal reflection. Total internal reflection generates significant\nbanding of image structure at regions of high curvature (Figure 2(a)), which may provide\nadditional information about the refractive properties of thick transparent objects.\nThe image-inversion effect we report here adds to previous literature by suggesting that the\nglobal orientation of photometric variations in these distortions, and not just the local\nstructure of distortions per se, contributes to perceived transparency. This finding\ncompliments other studies that have identified illumination biases in the perception\nof other surface properties, including 3D shape (e.g., Mamassian & Goutcher, 2001) and\npigmentation (e.g., Kim, Marlow & Anderson, 2014).\nFigure 2.

Our results suggest it would be fruitful to further explore how the\nstructure of the light field influences observer judgments of perceived shape, opacity, and\nrefractive index.\n"
