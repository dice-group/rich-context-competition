In this con-\ntext, what precisely is meant by public participation and how\nprocesses for engagement are envisaged vary quite dramati-\nFrewer, 2005). A tension in these discussions has been\nwhether public engagement is seen as a largely unidirec-\ntional effort at educating lay publics in particular areas of\nscience, versus more dialogic processes in which lay publics\nare informed about particular issues, and given opportunities\nto provide input in associated social policy (Castle & Culver,\n2006). This tension is particularly salient in areas where\nscientific questions and technological solutions are inter-\ntwined with broader social issues. In such cases, public\ndeliberation as a specific form of public engagement seems\nto offer valuable pathways for involving publics in the gov-\nernance of science and technology and the particular contro-\nversies in which they are embedded.\nIn this article, we present a case study of an engagement\nevent \"Explosives, Genomics, and the Environment: A\nPublic Deliberation\" (or RDX Talk, for short). RDX is an\nexplosive used in mining, avalanche control, and by the mili-\ntary. The compound is relatively inexpensive and easy to\nhandle, which makes it a preferred choice compared with\nalternatives. However, RDX is also a neurotoxin and impli-\ncated in various adverse health outcomes. Owing to the large\namounts of RDX that have been used across the globe in the\npast few decades, concern is growing about the potential\nenvironmental and human health implications. To this end,\ndifferent approaches for the remediation of RDX are being\ninvestigated and developed. One such method involves the\nuse of naturally occurring microorganisms (Gordonia and\nRhodococcus) in the bioremediation of RDX. Little is known\nabout the precise mechanisms by which RDX is degraded by\nthese bacteria, and current efforts are underway to under-\nstand this process of bioremediation of RDX.\nTogether, these scientific, technological, and environmen-\ntal problems intersect with the social and political sphere on\n1University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada\n2University of British Columbia,Vancouver, Canada\nCorresponding Author:\nKieran C.

For instance, as has been found in\nthe case of food and livestock, there is conflation in public\nunderstandings of genomics and transgenic technologies\n(Tansey & Burgess, 2008). Would this conflation carry over\nto public understandings of microbial genomics, and what\nmight a public response to the use of genetically modified\n(GM) microbes look like? The Canadian military (along with\nother armed forces around the world) rely heavily on the use\nof RDX. Given that their primary mandate is one of defence,\nshould these institutions be held to the same environmental\nstandards as civilian organizations, or should special dispen-\nsations be made? Given the widespread use of RDX, how\nshould trade-offs between its utility to society and the poten-\ntial damage to health and the environment be managed?\nThese questions suggest that policy surrounding pollut-\nants like RDX and technologies involving microbial genom-\nics should at least take into consideration public perspectives\non the issue. However, the relatively obscure nature of both\nthe social issues (RDX pollution) and the science (microbial\ngenomics and bioremediation) suggests that typical social\nscientific methods of surveys, polls, or focus groups will not\nwork in this case. As argued elsewhere (MacKenzie &\nO'Doherty, 2011), low public awareness of the issues as well\nas lack of understanding of relevant technical information\nlimit the usefulness of traditional methods of engagement.\nHowever, a deliberative forum tailored to the issues at hand\noffers a robust mechanism for developing meaningful public\ninput on these issues.\nIn this article, we outline the rationale, methods, and\nresults of RDX Talk. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy of its kind on the issues of RDX pollution and micro-\nbial genomics, and thus provides an important baseline on\npublic sentiment on these issues. The methods used in our\nstudy build on previous work on public deliberation on\nother areas of science and technology (see Burgess,\nO'Doherty, & Secko, 2008; O'Doherty, Hawkins, &\nBurgess, 2012, on human tissue biobanking; and O'Doherty,\nBurgess, & Secko, 2010, on salmon genomics), though we\nalso present several methodological refinements. In particu-\nlar, RDX Talk involved issues that required participants\nthemselves to play a substantive role in setting the agenda\nand structuring their own deliberations on this issue. We\nthus illustrate a methodological refinement that allows\nmembers of the public to provide input not only on their\npreferences in the context of a range of preformulated pol-\nicy options but also in identifying those areas of concern\nthey most want to provide input on.\nThe primary goals of this article are to (a) gain under-\nstanding of how a diverse sample of the public responds to\nnovel and potentially controversial uses of science and tech-\nnology; (b) report on the deliberative conclusions of a pub-\nlic forum on social, ethical, and political concerns related to\nRDX contamination and the use of microbial genomics in\nbioremediation; (c) extend and further evaluate a model of\npublic deliberation; and (d) illustrate the effectiveness of\ncertain methodological refinements in conducting public\ndeliberation.\nRDX: Health, Environmental, and\nRegulatory Concerns\nRDX is a cheap, powerful explosive compound (Maleh,\nCarvalho-Knighton, & Martin, 2009). Unlike more unstable\nexplosives, RDX does not react to low levels of heat, shock,\nor friction, which makes it relatively safe to handle (Global\nSecurity, 2006). RDX is used in demolition, mining, road\nconstruction, avalanche prevention, as well as military appli-\ncations in both combat and training operations (U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Agency for Toxic\nSubstances and Disease Registry, 2010). It has been stated\nthat \"RDX is currently the most important military explosive\n254). However, detailed information about the precise volume\nand nature of usage within the military is not available.\nBy its very nature RDX is associated with violent conse-\nquences. However, RDX is also associated with less obvious\nforms of damage. RDX is a neurotoxin that interferes with the\nbrain and nervous system, causing seizures and disorientation\nif exposed to in high doses (Maleh et al., 2009; Williams et\nal., 2011). Frequent and long-term exposure through inhala-\ntion has produced convulsions, headaches, nausea and vomit-\ning, loss of consciousness, disorientation, and temporary loss\nof memory. Ingestion of RDX produces similar symptoms\n(Kucukavdalt et al., 2003). Recovery appears to be complete\nwhen exposure to RDX is discontinued (Hoek, 2004;\n2011). Experiments with rats and mice indicate other nega-\ntive effects that result from exposure, including decreased\noffspring weight, genital and urinary tract sores, liver and\nkidney damage, reduced fertility, and mortality (e.g., Bannon,\nDillman, Hable, Phillips, & Perkins, 2009; Card &Autenrieth,\n1998). Although there is no conclusive evidence that RDX\ncauses cancer in humans, research has suggested a link\nbetween exposure and cancer in lab animals (Hoek, 2004;\nMaleh et al., 2009; Munch & National Exposure Research\nresult, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)\nhas identified RDX as a possible carcinogen, and placed it on\na list of Emerging Chemicals of Concern (ECC) and the 2009\nContaminant Candidate List (CCL; USEPA, 2011).\nRemediation procedures for RDX have included: remov-\ning contaminated soil and dumping it in approved sites,\nincineration in furnaces or open-air kilns, and the introduc-\ntion of additional chemicals to neutralize pollutants (U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, Agency for\nToxic Substances and Disease Registry, 2010). Because\nmany of these methods are themselves associated with envi-\nronmental damage, researchers are pursing alternative tech-\nnologies that use plants and microbes for remediation\n(bioremediation; Card & Autenrieth, 1998; Maleh et al.,\nO'Doherty et al. 3\n2009). Grains, such as rice (Vila, Mehier, Lorber-Pascal, &\nhave been tested and shown to remediate soils effectively.\nResearchers are also using GM plants to assist in the removal\nof RDX from contaminated soil (Van Aken, 2009). Certain\nmicrobes have been identified that have natural capabilities\nthat could help with cleaning up pollution, including RDX.\nSpecifically, naturally occurring microbes called Gordonia\n(Indest et al., 2010) and Rhodococcus (Andeer, Stahl, Bruce,\n& Strand, 2009) have the capability to degrade RDX (K. T.\nThompson, Crocker, & Fredrickson, 2005). Because these\nmethods are still being evaluated, they are not yet approved\nfor extensive use.\nIn Canada, the regulation of RDX use and cleanup falls\nunder the responsibility of a variety of agencies and is subject\nto multiple pieces of legislation. The primary regulation per-\ntaining to RDX is the Canadian Environmental Protection\nAct (CEPA; Department of Justice Canada, 2011). CEPA\nregulations apply broadly to private industry and government\nagencies. However, the legislation does not limit powers\ngranted under the National Defence Act or any other piece of\nlegislation relating to national defence and security. It is\naccepted that National Defence training has to occur under\nrealistic conditions, but still comply with environmental reg-\nulations. However, the Department of National Defence is not\nrequired to conduct environmental impact assessments each\ntime explosives are used, which would be the norm for any\nother industrial or government agency in Canada.\nSubstances introduced in Canada after 1994 are consid-\nered \"new chemicals\" and need to be assessed for environ-\nmental safety through the submission of toxicological\ninformation. RDX was used before 1994 when environmen-\ntal protection was not the norm. It is classified as an \"exist-\ning substance,\" and any related health or environmental\nimpacts of the chemical have not been thoroughly examined.\nRDX appears as a low risk compound on the Domestic\nSubstances List (DSL) of Environment Canada (2010),\nwhich is the sole basis for determining whether a substance\nshould be evaluated.\nMethod\nThe present study involved engaging participants in a pro-\ncess of deliberation, in which they were informed of the\nissues and given an opportunity to discuss, form opinions,\nand challenge each other's positions in a respectful manner.\nA specific goal was to achieve legitimate public input that\ncould be useful from a social policy perspective in address-\ning the problems of RDX pollution and the costs and poten-\ntial risks of bioremediation. The design of the RDX\ndeliberation was based on previous work on human tissue\nand salmon genomics (O'Doherty et al., 2010). This body of\nwork asserts that the particular format of a public engage-\nment must be tailored to the type of issue to be discussed. As\na refinement on this previous work, RDX Talk involved\nengaging participants not only in deliberation about different\npreformulated policy options but also in identifying issues\nthat are of primary concern and in working toward collec-\ntively formulating policy recommendations on those issues.\nPublic Deliberation\nDeliberative democratic theory centers on the notion that for\nsome issues, at certain times, a simple vote for a political\nrepresentative is insufficient to provide for meaningful\ndemocratic decision making. When an issue is particularly\npoliticized or contentious, or when a policy decision requires\ninput from a large range of perspectives, opening the subject\nto meaningful public debate, and drawing on the outcomes\nof this debate in the formulation of policy, may be warranted\nWarren, 1996). Public debates of this sort can be fostered in\ntown hall meetings, on Internet forums, or in publicized\nmedia debates. More recently, carefully designed participa-\ntory governance processes have been applied to issues\ninvolving science and technology (Burgess & Tansey, 2008;\nHamlett, 2003). In this context, it has been argued that early\nor \"upstream\" development is likely to be most beneficial,\nsuch that broader inputs can be taken into account in the\nways in which a technology is developed, the forms it takes\nwhen introduced into society, and the ways in which it inter-\nfaces with various institutional interests and value systems\n(Wynne, 2001). Once a technology or contentious issue has\nbeen fully developed, once it has become embedded in insti-\ntutional practices and the day-to-day living of large numbers\nof people, once interest groups and political commitments\nhave formed, it is far more difficult to act on the input from\ndeliberative democratic forums.\nRecruitment\nThe aim of recruitment was to assemble a sample that was\nsufficiently diverse to represent the views and interests of\nindividuals and groups residing in the province, while being\nsmall enough to be financially and logistically feasible and\nenable meaningful dialogue between participants. To achieve\nthese goals, we relied on the theoretical construct of a mini-\nforum of members of the public that is chosen strategically\nto provide a legitimate public voice on some question of\npublic policy. While it is not possible in a small sample to\nachieve statistically significant representation across all\ndemographically relevant variables, it is possible to con-\nstruct a small sample in such a way as to maximize diversity\nand minimize selection bias (Longstaff & Burgess, 2010).\nTo this end, we aimed to achieve a randomly selected demo-\ngraphically stratified sample of 25 participants, with mini-\nmum selection filters to ensure representation of particular\nperspectives relevant to the topic.\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

Participant Specialized Knowledge Background.\nToxic and/or toxic materials training\nMilitary experience (self or family)\nA recruitment firm assisted in randomly selecting 5,000\nhouseholds, stratified across various regions in the greater\nVancouver area via publicly accessible postal codes. Each\nhousehold was sent a letter inviting one household member\nto enter a \"civic lottery\" draw, as well as a list of \"frequently\nasked questions\" regarding RDX, public deliberation, and\nthe reasons behind organizing the event. Interested individu-\nals then mailed a response postcard, containing basic demo-\ngraphic information, to the recruitment firm. In total, 138\npositive responses were received. The final group was\nselected from these responses using stratified random selec-\ntion to obtain a sample approximately proportional to the\npopulation of British Columbia in terms of age, sex, ethnic-\nity, and geographical area (see Table 1). The sample was also\nconstructed to include individuals who (a) have had some\ntraining in explosives or toxic materials, (b) have a personal\nor familial connection to the armed forces, and/or (c) con-\nsider themselves indigenous Canadian.\nGiven the topic of the deliberation, it was deemed that\nindividuals from these backgrounds would provide important\nperspectives (see Table 2). If recruitment had relied only on\nrandom selection, it would have been unlikely that individu-\nals with these perspectives would have been included.\nIncluding those with connections to the military was thought\nnecessary to ensure that the deliberation was not biased from\nthe start against military perspectives. It was also deemed\nimportant to include First Nations' voices given the complex\nrelationship betweenAboriginal governance and the Canadian\nstate in issues of land stewardship.\nTo account for attrition, 30 individuals were invited to the\ndeliberation. In all, 26 registered on the 1st day. Of these, 25\nattended and contributed substantively throughout the event\nand toward the final recommendations of the forum.\nInformation Materials\nThe complexity and relative obscurity of the many issues\nrelated to RDX required that participants be given access to\nbalanced and comprehensive, yet succinct, information.\nImportantly, however, information provision was not an aim\nin and of itself. Rather, the aim was to provide sufficient and\nunbiased1 information as a foundation for meaningful delib-\neration to be able to take place. Information was provided\nthrough a booklet, by expert speakers at the event, and\nthrough a dedicated website.\nThe booklet (\"Explosives and the Environment: A Public\nDeliberation\") was written specifically for the event and\nincluded information on the following topics: the nature, his-\ntory, and uses of RDX; the consequences of RDX pollution\nand its effect on human health; the range of cleanup and\nremediation techniques; and the current regulatory context\nfor use of RDX in Canada. The booklet was written at a\nGrade 10 reading level but based on information sourced\nfrom the peer-reviewed literature, and it was checked for sci-\nentific accuracy by experts in the field. The booklet was\nmailed to each participant before the event and an electronic\ncopy was made available on the website (www.rdxtalk.org).\nFour speakers with relevant expertise were invited to\nthe event. During the 1st day of the event, each speaker\ngave a presentation, and participants had the opportunity\nto ask questions immediately after the presentation and\nduring a panel discussion with all speakers. After the 1st\nday, the research team acted as liaison between partici-\npants and the expert speakers when new questions emerged\nor additional information was requested. Expert speakers\ndid not participate in the actual deliberations as mixing lay\nand expert voices in deliberation has been shown to poten-\ntially marginalize the views of nonexperts (Kerr,\nCunningham-Burley, & Tutton, 2007; see also O'Doherty\n& Davidson, 2010). The four speakers provided informa-\ntion and perspectives on\n1. why RDX is an environmental problem, and the cur-\nrently available remediation strategies, including the\nadvantages and disadvantages of each strategy;\n2. the (Canadian) provincial and federal regulations\nthat might come to bear on RDX use and remedia-\ntion, focusing on the complexity of various inter-\ndependent sets of legislation and the lack of clarity\nregarding precisely which regulations might be the\nO'Doherty et al. 5\nmost relevant to the use of RDX and responsibili-\nties for cleanup;\n3. the science behind understanding the role of soil\nmicrobes responsible for biodegrading RDX; and\n4. source water protection, the relative impact of vari-\nous human activities on water quality, and avenues\nfor managing water pollution.\nA website was constructed specifically for this project\n(www.rdxtalk.org). Potential participants were directed to\nthe website in the initial recruitment letter. The site provided\ninformation about the planned deliberation, the topic, and\nthe research team. A private section of the website, accessi-\nble only to confirmed participants, included detailed infor-\nmation about the speakers and their presentations, additional\nreadings, event schedules, and an electronic copy of the\nbooklet. It was also used during the deliberation to post\nnotes or thoughts of individual participants.\nEvent Design\nRDX Talk was staged over two weekends in April 2010 with\nan intervening weekend to allow participants to further\nreflect on the issues and to discuss them with friends and\nfamily before the second weekend of deliberation. Overall,\nthe event can be roughly divided into three phases: (1) infor-\nmation provision, (2) agenda setting, and (3) formulation of\npolicy recommendations. The 1st day of the event was\ngeared toward information provision (Phase 1), and allow-\ning participants to get used to the practice of deliberation.\nAll speaker presentations and the expert panel took place on\nthis day. Day 2 was dedicated to participants collectively\nidentifying the most important issues for which they wanted\nto develop recommendations (Phase 2: agenda setting). The\nsecond weekend (Days 3 and 4) was dedicated to delibera-\ntion and developing group recommendations on the items\nidentified on Day 2 (Phase 3: policy recommendations).\nParticipants also completed a pre- and postdeliberation sur-\nvey immediately prior to and after the event, and a final\none-on-one telephone interview was conducted with each\nparticipant between 4 and 6 weeks after the event.\nDiscussions were conducted in small breakaway groups\nand the large group consisting of all 25 participants. All dis-\ncussions were moderated by members of the research team\nwho had prior experience in group facilitation and in con-\nducting public deliberation. Based on principles from delib-\nerative democracy (see, for example, Gastil & Levine, 2005),\nthe practice of deliberation involves participants working\ntogether to become informed on an issue, and working\ntoward collective positions while providing reasoned argu-\nments for their own positions and being open to considering\nothers' positions. Ideally, good deliberative practices will\nensure that participants are respectful toward each other and\ntreated as equals. Participants should justify their own posi-\ntions and be open to having their positions challenged by\nothers. Finally, any conclusions that are reached should be a\nreflection of the deliberating groups' efforts to find common\ntrast to simply exchanging views, deliberation involves jus-\ntifying positions in an effort to work toward a collective\nresolution of issues. Background materials and responses to\ntechnical questions were intended to enhance participants'\ntechnical knowledge as well as their confidence in engaging\nwith the subject matter and arriving at policy advice.\nFurthermore, recruiting for diversity of life experience and\nfacilitating the discussions to ensure that all participants felt\ncomfortable contributing helped ensure that a broad range of\nconsiderations and perspectives was reflected in the deliber-\native conclusions of the group.\nIn a refinement of previous deliberations, participants in\nRDX Talk were themselves engaged in setting the agenda for\nissues they wanted to discuss. This approach is different from\nmany other mini-public processes. In many cases, those who\nconvene mini-publics decide which issues (and subtopics) will\nbe addressed before the deliberation takes place (Abelson et\nal., 2007). The British Columbia CitizenAssembly's mandate,\nfor example, was restricted to examining the mechanics of\nelections and excluded other related topics, such as redistrict-\ning, election finance, and the size of the legislature (Warren &\noften have quite specific (and restricted) mandates (as, for\nexample, the deliberative poll [DP] on whether Australia\nshould become a republic, 1999). In most cases, such con-\nstraints are appropriate as public deliberations are arguably\nmost productive when they are focused. Constraints also help\nensure that the results of deliberation can be acted on by policy\nIn other cases, however, it can be problematic to constrain\ndeliberation to preidentified issues and concerns. This is\nmost likely to be the case where\n1. policy-making bodies are fragmented, with uncer-\ntainty about where initiatives for new policy or\npolicy changes should be located;\n2. there is little or no social scientific research, such\nthat there are no analyses that can be drawn on to\nevaluate the impact of these issues on public wel-\nfare and values; and\n3. there is little or no public discourse on an issue.\nConsequently, no assumptions can be made about\nthe relative salience of aspects of an issue that\nmight need to be reflected in policy options.\nIn such cases, public deliberations themselves can help\ndetermine which issues require more attention. For example,\nin the case of biobanking, the results of an initial unstruc-\ntured public deliberation (O'Doherty & Burgess, 2009) were\nused to inform and constrain the specific issues that were\naddressed in a subsequent mini-public deliberation\n(O'Doherty et al., 2012). At RDX Talk, the first weekend\nwas dedicated to participants themselves identifying those\ntopics that they felt were most important to address, setting\n6 SAGE Open\nthe agenda for the second weekend of deliberation. RDX\nTalk was therefore designed with separate phases for agenda\nsetting and formulation of policy recommendations (see\nabove). In the agenda-setting phase (Phase 2), participants\ncollectively worked toward identifying the issues they\ndeemed most important and listing them as items for which\nthey wanted to make recommendations. The items tabled for\ndeliberation in Phase 3 (policy recommendations) were thus\nnot imposed by the research team, government agendas, or\nother vested interests. Rather, they were developed in the\npublic forum itself in consideration of the opinions and posi-\ntions of all participants.\nIn Phase 3 (formulation of policy recommendations), each\nagenda item was discussed in small group sessions before\nbeing deliberated in the larger group. The aim of the small\ngroup discussions was for all participants to be able to express\ntheir opinions and explore the issue being considered in depth\nand to provide a foundation from which the large group dis-\ncussion could proceed; the small groups were not expected to\nmake collective decisions during this phase of the process. In\ncontrast, the aim of the large group was to work toward col-\nlective statements endorsed by the group itself. The nominal\ngoal of the large group discussion was to reach agreement on\neach item but facilitators did not push for consensus when\npersistent disagreements emerged. Rather, the aim was to\nexplore disagreements and, when they could not be resolved\nthrough deliberation, articulate and document clearly the\nnature of the disagreement. Deliberation of each issue was\nconcluded with a vote that was recorded together with a col-\nlective statement of the group. The vote helped ensure that the\nfacilitator would not assume a consensus had been formed\nowing to the absence of voices raised against a particular\nproposition. This allowed the facilitator to draw out detailed\nreasoning on both the proposition being considered and any\nalternate views still held by participants at this point in time\n(Moore & O'Doherty, 2012). Each vote also provided an\nexplicit transition from one issue to the next.\nAfter the event, the research team produced a report of all\ncollectively forged recommendations and articulated dis-\nagreements. This document represents the official conclu-\nsions of this public deliberation. The report was sent out to\nparticipants for review and ratification.\nSurvey\nParticipants were asked to complete a 20-item survey before\nand after the deliberation. The survey had two purposes.\nFirst, it provides a quantitative record of individual opinions\nindependent of the collective statements developed in the\ndeliberation. Second, there is a recognized need for empiri-\ncal evaluation of deliberative processes (De Vries et al.,\n2010; Rowe, Horlick-Jones, Walls, Poortinga, & Pidgeon,\nThe items in the survey were developed by the research\nteam to represent the possible range of social and ethical\nissues pertaining to RDX use, pollution, and remediation.\nEach item had five response categories: strongly agree,\nsomewhat agree, somewhat disagree, strongly disagree, and\ndon't know (a copy of the survey is available from the\nauthors on request).\nResults\nThere is no one immediately obvious way of presenting the\nresults of a deliberation. In particular, there is a tension\nbetween analysts' attempts at synthesizing the main themes\nof discussion after the deliberation has taken place and\nallowing the statements of deliberants to stand as they are\nwithout analytical synthesis. Individual deliberants are\nactively encouraged to reconsider their positions in light of\nnew information and other perspectives, and may conse-\nquently change their opinions. Analyses therefore need to\ndifferentiate between individual opinions expressed in dis-\ncussion, themes emerging from analyses of the entire delib-\neration, and collective statements ratified by the group. We\nterm these collective statements deliberative outputs\n(O'Doherty & Burgess, 2009). Although post hoc analyses\nconducted on transcripts of a public engagement may pro-\nvide important insights, deliberative outputs arguably have\nmore political legitimacy because they represent collective\npositions arrived at and ratified through democratic delibera-\ntion. In this section, we report these collectively forged and\nratified \"deliberative outputs\" as well as a range of selected\nsurvey results.\nDeliberative Outputs\nDuring the agenda-setting phase of the deliberation, partici-\npants collectively decided on the following seven topics that\nwould be placed on the agenda for discussion and for which\npolicy recommendations would be developed:\n1. The Costs Associated With RDX Use\n2. Research and Development Priorities\n3. Potential Reduction or Elimination of RDX\n4. Remediation of RDX\n5. The Military As a Special User of RDX\n6. Regulation of RDX Use and Remediation\n7. Public Education and Information Pertaining to\nRDX\nDiscussion on the second weekend was aimed at devel-\noping specific policy recommendations for each of these\nissues. In total, 25 members of the public contributed to the\ndiscussion, although 2 members were unable to attend all\nthe sessions of the second weekend. As such, the totals\nrecorded below vary between 23 and 25. Some of the rec-\nommendations were unanimous and therefore represent the\nopinion of the group as a whole. Where full consensus was\nnot achieved, disagreements were articulated and recorded.\nLast, a vote was taken as a measure of support for each\nrecommendation.\nO'Doherty et al. 7\n1. The Costs Associated With RDX Use\nPolicy Recommendation:\nIn general, the direct costs of RDX use seem to be well recognized. We recommend that when formulating policy on\nRDX, the following indirect/intangible costs should be considered:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Health and safety costs\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Health care system costs\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Environmental costs\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Costs of not using RDX/using alternatives (alternatives may be worse)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Costs to the military of not using RDX (effectiveness of alternatives)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Regulatory costs\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Research costs (cost of researching alternatives to RDX or cleanup costs)\nAssessments of costs should depend in part on situation-specific environmental assessments and budgetary\nconstraints.\nAll 25 participants supported this as a recommendation of the group. However, there was disagreement as to whether\nthe military should be included in the recommendation. In all, 9 participants felt that the military should be excluded from\nthe recommendation, whereas 16 participants felt that the military should be included. In addition, 23 participants felt that\nthis recommendation should also apply to other neurotoxins, whereas 2 participants did not. Those who did not were\nconcerned that the recommendations would have limited policy impact if they were too broad and not specific to RDX.\n2. Research and Development Priorities\nPolicy Recommendation:\nResearch into RDX remediation, RDX alternatives, and RDX effects are each important. With that in mind, the research\npriorities should be in the following order:\n1. Research into the current uses and effects of RDX to establish the extent and impact of RDX use in terms of\nenvironmental pollution and human health effects\n2. Research into remediation of RDX pollution\n3. Research into alternatives to RDX\nThese research priorities should be amended over time once the major backlog of remediation and RDX cleanup has\ntaken place. At that point, priorities should change, so that the primary focus of research is into alternatives for RDX\n(in particular, alternatives that are cost-effective and green/environmentally friendly).\nAll 25 participants agreed on this recommendation.\n8 SAGE Open\n3. Potential Reduction or Elimination of RDX\nNo policy recommendation emerged on this issue owing to a split in the eventual positions adopted by participants. A\nvote was held on each position with the following results:\nPosition 1: (support for Position 9 of 25)\nThere is currently not sufficient evidence that the harms of RDX justify a mandated reduction or ban.\nQualification:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Remediation of RDX pollution should still take place.\nBased on current information, we should aim for a phased reduction of RDX.\nQualifications:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Mechanisms to encourage reduction could include mechanisms, such as taxes or tariffs.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Remediation of RDX should still take place.\nNine of 25 participants supported Position 1, and 14 supported Position 2. One participant abstained from the vote\ndue to a belief that a new coordinating governance body was needed to make this decision.\n4. Remediation of RDX\nPolicy Recommendation A (regarding remediation):\nSituation-specific assessments are required to determine the most appropriate remediation technique. Remediation\nshould be timely and subject to regulatory approval.\nGiven constraints identified in situation-specific assessments, natural solutions to remediation are preferred, including\nmicrobes, plants, photoreaction, and composting.\nQualifications:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 If less preferred options are used, such as chemicals or incineration, a careful justification must be provided.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 An important consideration in choosing a remediation method is to avoid the production of other harmful sub-\nstances.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Use of preferred remediation methods over other options may justify higher financial costs and longer remedia-\ntion completion time.\nThis position was supported by 24 of 24 participants.\nPolicy Recommendation B (regarding bioremediation utilizing genetically modified organisms [GMOs]):\nIt is necessary to conduct further research into the usefulness and safety of GM microbes and GM plants for the biore-\nmediation of RDX. This needs to occur prior to the development of regulations, followed by carefully managed field\ntrials and possible general use.\nQualifications:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 There is a preference for cross-breeding over genetic modification.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 In terms of GM, there is a preference for methods in which plants are unable to reproduce and organisms that\nare noninvasive.\nO'Doherty et al. 9\nThere was contention regarding the inclusion of the term carefully managed field trials in this recommendation. In\nall, 18 participants supported inclusion of this phrase, whereas 5participants did not think field trials would be appropri-\nate because of the risk of GM organisms being released into the environment. One individual abstained.\nOnce the option to include or exclude the term carefully managed field trials had been documented, 21 of 24 partici-\npants supported the above statement regarding bioremediation. The 3 participants who did not support the recommenda-\ntion expressed the concerns that bioremediation was not necessarily acceptable and that \"preference\" was not a strong\nenough statement.\n5.The Military As a Special User of RDX\nPolicy Recommendation A:\nThe military has an obligation to conform to regulations in terms of remediation of RDX.\nEighteen of 23 participants supported Recommendation A. Those who did not did so on the grounds that they did not\nbelieve this recommendation was feasible for implementation outside of Canada.\nPolicy Recommendation B:\nThe military has an obligation to conform to regulations in terms of remediation of RDX in Canada.\nTwenty-two of 23 participants supported Recommendation B. The participant who did not support it thought that the\nrecommendation should be strengthened by stipulating that the military should provide justifications as to why they\nwould not need to remediate in other countries.\nPolicy Recommendation C:\nIn general, the military's use of RDX should be subject to the same regulations as nonmilitary users. There are excep-\ntional circumstances where there should be some flexibility such as when the military is in conflict.\nTwenty of 23 participants supported Recommendation C. Of the 3 participants who did not, 2 felt that the term excep-\ntional circumstances should be removed as it is subjective and weakens the statement and 1 felt that the statement could\nnot be made as the military cannot be regulated.\n6. Regulation of RDX Use and Remediation\nPolicy Recommendation:\nRecognizing that there are some existing regulations in place, we want regulations on RDX to address the following:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A lack of transparency\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Accountability\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Enforcement of regulations\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Oversight\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Competency on both a provincial and federal level\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Recognizing RDX as a hazardous substance\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 User responsibility (including fiscally) for total remediation\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Human and environmental risks\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Control of RDX use/distribution (so that it does not fall into the wrong hands, for example, terrorists)\nTwenty-three of 23 participants supported this recommendation.\nTable 3.

Public Education and Information Pertaining to\nRDX\nSpecific recommendations on the issues of public education\nand information could not be made due to time constraints.\nHowever, general discussion regarding this topic did occur\nand the following points were considered. Note that as no\nconsensus-oriented discussion or voting took place for this\nissue, some items may be in disagreement with others.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The overall objective of informing the public is\ngood. However, public resources for education are\nalready stretched, and should not be used for RDX\ninformation. Moreover, governmental bodies may\nnot be the best people to do this.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Information should be limited, and issues should be\nkept in perspective.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 News broadcasts and local newspaper articles could\nhelp foster discussion and education.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A website containing information would be helpful.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Public discussion should be targeted toward RDX\nand RDX remediation.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Politicians are supposed to act as our representa-\ntives, so if we are concerned as citizens then politi-\ncians should act on our behalf.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 RDX discussion should be incorporated into\nbroader issues, such as the environment and health,\nwhich are on the political agenda.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A more public focus on RDX is justified and is\nunlikely to detract from other, more important\nissues that are on the political agenda.\nSurvey\nThe conclusions listed above represent the product of a\ndynamic and deliberative process. As such, they are a col-\nlective achievement that is emergent from the process of\ndeliberation. In contrast, the survey contained questions\nthat were determined prior to the deliberation taking place.\nAnalyses of predeliberation responses provide some insight\ninto the views of a lay public on issues relevant to RDX use\nand remediation. These responses should have some simi-\nlarity to the views of the general public, at least in com-\nparison with the deliberative conclusions of the forum,\nwhich are purposefully informed and deliberative in nature.\nAnalyses of pre- and postevent responses provide some\ninsight into patterns of opinion change and formation over\nthe course of the event.\nAlthough the survey was developed before the event,\nmany of the survey questions are closely associated with the\nlist of topics identified in the agenda-setting phase and\naddressed in the group's deliberations. In particular, the sur-\nvey included items related to the following deliberative\nconclusions:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The Costs Associated With RDX Use (Issue No. 1)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Potential Reduction or Elimination of RDX (Issue\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Remediation of RDX (Issue No. 4)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The Military As a Special User of RDX (Issue No.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Regulation of RDX Use and Remediation (Issue\nFor each issue, we examine responses from the pre- and\npostevent surveys. For the purposes of this article, we pro-\nvide descriptive statistics only.\nThe Costs AssociatedWith RDX Use\nOne of the strongest recommendations called for an account-\ning of the intangible costs of using pollutants like RDX. The\ngroup agreed that, in the future, all associated costs, includ-\ning those related to health and environmental concerns,\nshould be considered and that financial considerations alone\ndo not adequately reflect the impacts the chemical has, or\nmight have, on humans, animals, and nature more generally.\nTwo survey items are closely related to this deliberative\nconclusion (see Tables 3 and 4).\nTable 3 shows that the group was strongly committed to\nenvironmental values. Given the choice between creating\njobs and protecting the environment, 76.9% chose in favor of\nthe environment in the first wave of the survey, whereas\n73.9% chose the environment in the second wave of the sur-\nvey. This result contrasts to data from the 2008 Canadian\nElection Study in which respondents were asked the same\nTable 5.

In that survey, 46.8% of respondents in British\nColumbia agreed or strongly agreed with that statement.2 It\nappears that participants in RDX Talk were strongly commit-\nted to environmental objectives and this is reflected in their\ndecision to recommend a broad-based accounting of both\nfinancial and \"intangible\" costs associated with the use and\nremediation of RDX.\nAs shown in Table 4, a majority of participants before and\nafter the deliberation were worried about the potential health\nrisks of RDX. This, again, is reflected in the group's recom-\nmendation to account for health costs as well as any financial\ncosts that may be associated with the use and remediation of\nPotential Reduction or Elimination of RDX\nA majority of participants in the deliberative forum recom-\nmended that the use of RDX should be reduced and eventu-\nally phased out; however, the recommendation was not\nsupported unanimously, and in fact, had a relatively large\nminority in opposition. Importantly, the recommendation\ndoes not include a stipulation of a complete (immediate or\neventual) ban on the use of RDX in Canada. Despite rec-\nommending new, clear, and comprehensive regulations of\nRDX, the group did not view an outright ban as desirable\nor feasible. This division of opinion is also reflected in the\nsurvey responses, and in particular in postdeliberation\nresponses. As shown in Table 5, before the deliberation,\n26.9% of participants supported banning RDX in Canada.\nHowever, 19.2% either disagreed or strongly disagreed\nwith this option. It is interesting that a majority entered the\ndeliberation unsure whether banning RDX would be an\nappropriate policy response. In contrast, after the delibera-\ntion, all but two participants expressed an opinion on\nwhether RDX should be banned. The rest were split on this\nissue with 47.8% in general agreement that it should be\nbanned and 43.5% saying that it should not be banned.\nRemediation of RDX\nThe survey contained one item pertaining to the use of\nmicrobial technologies for remediation. As shown in Table\n6, 52% of participants agreed or strongly agreed with this\nstatement before the deliberation compared with 72.7% in\nthe postdeliberation survey. Importantly, the number of\n\"don't know\" responses fell from an initial 48.0% to only\n9.09% in the postdeliberation wave.\nIn addition to the question on microbial remediation, the\nsurvey also measured sentiment toward GMO technologies,\nand GM microbes specifically. Although targeted genetic\nmodification of microbes for the purposes of remediation of\nRDX is (to our knowledge) currently not being considered,\nthe possibility of using GM microbes for remediation does\nexist and has been trialed previously for other pollutants\n(Brazil et al., 1995). Items pertaining to GMOs were included\nin the survey to assess the general sentiment of the group\ntoward these technologies.\nEven though the public forum as a whole endorsed the use\nof GM microbes for remediation purposes with certain pre-\ncautions (see deliberative conclusion above), it is notewor-\nthy that individual participants were much more divided in\ntheir orientation toward GMO technologies. As shown in\nTable 7, in the predeliberation survey, 42.3% agreed that, in\ngeneral, GMO technologies cause more problems than they\nsolve. After deliberation--and in spite of developing a col-\nlective statement that genomic technologies and microbes\nshould be developed and used, but only after extensive (and\nsafe) testing--40.9% remained committed in their general\nopposition to these technologies. Again, the number of\n\"don't know\" responses fell from an initial 34.6% to only\n9.09% in the post-deliberation.\nTable 9. The Military Should Be Subject to the Same\nEnvironmental Laws As Nonmilitary Sectors.\nPre Post\n Frequency % Frequency %\nFinally, participants were asked to respond to the state-\nment: \"Genetically modified microbes are unnatural organ-\nisms\" (Table 8). The notion of \"natural\" is of course vague\nand problematic theoretically, and we use it here not to imply\nthat a neat line can be drawn between \"natural\" and \"unnatu-\nral\" organisms. The point of the question, rather, was to\ngauge participants' general disposition toward the idea of\nGM microbes. The results are revealing in that a majority of\nresponses indicated agreement with the statement that GM\norganisms are unnatural, pre-deliberation (52%) and post-\ndeliberation (59%), indicating a substantive degree of oppo-\nsition to the idea of using GM microbes independent of the\nknowledge and insights gained during deliberation.\nThe Military As a Special User of RDX\nGiven that national defence is considered by many to be an\noverriding mandate for the operations of military forces,\nquestions arise as to whether the military should be expected\nto adhere to the same guidelines as civilian organizations in\nthe use and remediation of RDX. A strong majority of par-\nticipants in the public forum expressed strong agreement\nbefore and after deliberation with the following statement:\n\"The military should be subject to the same environmental\nlaws as nonmilitary sectors\" (Table 9). In the preevent sur-\nvey, 84.6% of participants agreed or strongly agreed with\nthis statement compared with 86.9% in the postevent survey.\nThe survey also contained four items to measure overall\ndispositions toward the military. Responses to these items\nconfirm that the group was not clearly antimilitary, but rather\nreflected a range of different perspectives on this topic.\nThese four survey items were designed to test responses\nagainst increasingly higher levels of military mandate and\nintervention. The first item measured support for the military\nin a relatively noncontroversial role: \"The military has an\nimportant role to play in peacekeeping.\" The second item\nmeasured support for the military with respect to its role in\nproviding national security: \"The military has an important\nrole to play in protecting Canada and its citizens from poten-\ntial threats.\" The third item measured willingness to have\nCanada participate in potentially dangerous international\nmilitary campaigns: \"It is sometimes necessary to put\nCanadian soldiers at risk for the sake of international\nsecurity.\" The last item measured support for involving the\nCanadian military in a more controversial international role:\n\"The military has an important role to play in policing the\nrest of the world.\"\nTable 8. Genetically Modified Microbes Are Unnatural\nOrganisms.\nPre Post\n Frequency % Frequency %\nFigure 1. Perceived role of the military (pre).\nFigure 2. Perceived role of the military (post).\nNote. Survey items pertaining to the role of the military:\n1.The military has an important role to play in peacekeeping.\nThe military has an important role to play in protecting Canada and its\ncitizens from potential threats.\nIt is sometimes necessary to put Canadian soldiers at risk for the sake\nof international security.\nThe military has an important role to play in policing the rest of the\nworld.\nAs expected, support for each of these statements declined\nas the proposed level of intervention of the military increased\n(see Figures 1 and 2 for pre- and postdeliberation responses,\nrespectively; the numbers 1-4 on the x-axis represent the four\ndifferent levels of military intervention). That is, progres-\nsively controversial roles for the military found progres-\nsively lower support from participants. Importantly,\nresponses to all four items demonstrated a range of opinions,\nindicating a good balance of attitudes toward the military in\nthe sample of participants. Based on these results, it is clear\nthat the RDX Talk participants were not characterized by\nunusually strong antimilitary sentiment. To the contrary, a\nmajority expressed agreement that the military has important\nroles to play domestically and internationally. One might\nspeculate here that the focus on antiterrorism in at least one\nof the forum's recommendations could be associated with an\nincrease in positive attitudes toward the role of the military,\nand therefore tolerance of military authority or autonomy. In\nsummary, however, in spite of the group demonstrating sup-\nport for the military in various roles, there is a clear state-\nment from this group, both in the deliberative conclusions as\nwell as in the pre- and postsurvey responses, that the military\nshould be subject to the same environmental regulations as\ncivilian users of RDX.\nRegulation of RDX Use and Remediation\nOne conclusion of the forum was that regulations regarding\nRDX use should be clear and comprehensive, and clearly\nrecognize RDX as dangerous material. A survey item that\nrelates to this issue asked participants to respond to the state-\nment: \"New regulations are needed to reduce the use of\nRDX in Canada.\" Table 10 shows that 69.2% of participants\nagreed or strongly agreed with this statement in the predelib-\neration survey compared with only 3.9% who disagreed or\nstrongly disagreed. At this time, over a quarter of partici-\npants gave a \"don't know\" response to this statement.\nIn the postdeliberation survey, the percentage of those in\nagreement with this statement was somewhat lower at 65.2%.\nIn the postdeliberation survey, there were also far fewer \"don't\nknow\" responses to this item, with a strong increase in dis-\nagreement with the statement. This suggests that deliberation\nhad some impact in helping participants form opinions on this\nissue and that the group was more divided on the issue after\nthe deliberation. Nevertheless, a majority of participants indi-\ncated support for introducing new regulations to reduce the\nuse of RDX in Canada before and after deliberating this topic.\nAdditional Characteristics of the Sample\nSelection of individuals for participation in RDX Talk was\ngeared mainly toward representing diversity across certain\ndemographic filters. Although the purpose was to represent\na diversity of values, opinions, backgrounds, and interests,\ndifficulties in assessing these characteristics in the recruit-\nment phase generally mean that demographic variables need\nto be used as proxies. However, responses to some survey\nitems allow us to gain a more nuanced understanding of our\nsample of deliberants. Below, we briefly consider partici-\npants' responses to survey items that illustrate diversity in\nsome important opinions. Variation across the sample from\npre- to postsurvey responses on these items was negligible,\nand we consider here only predeliberation responses.\nFour (of 26) participants (15.4%) indicated that they had\nheard of RDX prior to the event. We infer from this that\nwhile the majority of participants had not heard of RDX, and\ntherefore reflected the broader population well in this regard,\nthere were voices present in the deliberation potentially\ncapable of drawing on broader experiences with RDX.\nSeventeen (of 26) participants (65.4%) indicated general\nagreement that there are technological solutions to most of\nour environmental problems; 6 participants disagreed\n(23.1%). We infer from this that the sample was overall\ninclined positively toward science and technology, but that a\nrecognizable minority was potentially opposed to this\nposition.\nTo the question whether, in general, environmental prob-\nlems can be addressed by experts without input from citi-\nfor the question of whether RDX pollution, specifically, can\nbe addressed by experts without input from citizens, 5 (of\nspecific question. We infer from this that the majority of par-\nticipants were inclined to feel empowered by their\nparticipation in this deliberation, and felt entitled to hold and\nvoice an opinion on the issue. Nevertheless, a recognizable\nminority likely felt that decisions on the issues discussed in\nthe forum did not require their input.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nThe problem of RDX pollution and use of emerging tech-\nnologies for its remediation reflects a particular example of\nsocietal issues that require governance solutions to be\nimplemented in conditions of considerable uncertainty.\nIn developing appropriate public input for these kinds of\nproblems, it is thus important that such public opinion is\nTable 10. New Regulations Are Needed to Reduce the Use of\nRDX in Canada.\nPre Post\n Frequency % Frequency %\nappropriately informed. Both the transcripts of the delibera-\ntion as well as the deliberative outputs show evidence that\nthe individuals who took part in this public deliberation\nunderstood much of the technical information well enough\nto formulate meaningful conclusions. This is significant for\na number of reasons. First, it provides further supporting\nevidence that lay publics are capable of engaging meaning-\nfully in policy debates on issues involving complex science\nor technology. Second, although informing a lay public on\nmatters relating to RDX and bioremediation was not the\nprimary aim of the project, the legitimacy of the forum's\nconclusions arguably relies in part on evidence of at least a\nfoundational understanding of relevant technical informa-\ntion. And third, although many experts tend to lament hav-\ning to work with uninformed publics and cite publics' lack\nof technical knowledge as a stumbling block to including\nlay publics in policy decision-making processes, the fact is\nthat most experts themselves constitute a \"lay public\" in\nmost areas outside of their own field of specialization. In\nthe context of the present study, for instance, relevant tech-\nnical knowledge came from the areas of microbial genom-\nics, environmental law, remediation of toxic materials, and\nenvironmental science. Experts in any one of these areas are\nlikely not experts in any of the others. The participants in\nRDX Talk, however, were expected to take into account\ninformation from all of these fields, and place them into the\ncontext of even wider public interests, such as considering\nthe role of the military in contemporary society, considering\nlong-term costs to the health care system, and how to bal-\nance the issues being discussed in this forum relative to\nother societal problems. Given these constraints, the con-\nclusions of the public forum reflect breadth of consideration\nof issues as well as relatively high awareness of relevant\ntechnical information.\nA frequent challenge to the use of mini-publics is that it is\nunclear how representative the views of the forum are rela-\ntive to the rest of the population. It needs to be acknowl-\nedged here that this question of representativeness of views\ncannot be answered, because it is the wrong question to ask.\nThe (post-deliberation) views of the forum are not represen-\ntative of the general public, simply because the general pub-\nlic has not been exposed to the relevant information on the\nsubject that was presented to the forum participants, nor have\nother members of the public undergone an intense period of\ndeliberation in which they have been exposed to a range of\ndifferent perspectives and had to defend their own positions\nagainst alternative views. In other words, the legitimacy of\nthe conclusions of this public forum should not rely on crite-\nria of representativeness relative to the broader population,\nbut on criteria of whether relevant technical information was\nunderstood and taken into account, whether there was undue\nbias in the constitution of the group, and whether there is\nevidence that the deliberations of the group took into account\na sufficient diversity of perspectives.\nThe results of RDX Talk allow us to reflect further both\non the substantive issues discussed by members of the public\nas well as methodological questions pertaining to conducting\ndeliberative forums. Regarding the legitimacy of the forum's\nconclusions, it can be noted that the diversity of views\nexpressed over the course of the deliberation suggests that an\nappropriately wide range of concerns and perspectives was\nconsidered and incorporated into the conclusions when\ndeemed relevant. With regard to potential bias, it is possible\nthat the group was more environmentally minded than aver-\nage (given that individuals with an interest in environmental\nmatters might have been more likely to volunteer for partici-\npation in the project in the first place). However, if this was\nthe case, the conclusions do not indicate that such a bias\nunduly overemphasized environmental over other concerns\n(such as human health concerns or considerations of the cur-\nrent usefulness of RDX in different sectors). Given that the\nmilitary is such a prominent user of RDX, a particularly\nsalient bias might have been undue pro- or antimilitary senti-\nment. As outlined in the \"Method\" section, care was taken to\nmanage potential antimilitary bias in the public forum\nthrough special recruitment filters. The results of the survey\nvalidate that the group was balanced in terms of their senti-\nment toward the military. We have reason to be confident,\ntherefore, that the conclusions of the forum represent the out-\ncomes of considered civic deliberation, and not negative (or\npositive) sentiment toward the military.\nIn recent years, the Canadian military has been the subject\nof controversy surrounding the issue of trichloroethylene\n(TCE), with claims that this solvent, used extensively by the\nmilitary, has caused cancer in surrounding communities\n(Stephen, 2009). Understandably, decision makers within the\nmilitary are cautious about raising public concerns about yet\nanother potential environmental crisis. The conclusions from\nthis public forum suggest that an informed public is not likely\nto underestimate the difficulties faced by the military in bal-\nancing responsibilities of national defence with those of envi-\nronmentally sustainable practices. Nevertheless, even this\ninformed public forum (in which care was taken to ensure the\npresence of promilitary voices) came to the majority conclu-\nsion that the military should not be exempt from the societal\nlaws governing environmental practices. What we infer from\nthis is that the military is likely to gain far more favorable\nreviews from the public if they conduct their activities relat-\ning to RDX and similarly hazardous substances with a certain\ntransparency in engaging with public concerns. Although\nlarge-scale attempts of broadcasting problems relating to\nRDX and other pollutants are not warranted, attempts to hide\nthe nature and extent of the problem are likely to result in\nincreased public outrage should these issues ever be faced\nwith a high degree of publicity. Although this public forum\nwas convened to consider the particular case of RDX, one\nmight cautiously speculate that the forum's conclusions with\nregard to not providing special dispensation for military use\nof RDX might be generalizable for other pollutants (see also\nSantos & Chess, 2003, on citizen Restoration Advisory\nBoards consultations with the U.S. Army).\nSomewhat independent of the issue of RDX is that of\npublic responses to microbial genomics and the use of GM\nmicrobes. Given public sentiment on GM crops, GM live-\nstock, and GM salmon (Tansey & Burgess, 2008), greater\nresistance to the idea of GM microbes might have been\nexpected in this sample. In contrast to public sentiment on\nthese other issues, this public forum expressed relatively\nlow concern with the (hypothetical) use of GM microbes\nfor bioremediation in their deliberations (even though more\nthan 50% of the participants did express in the survey that\nthey felt GM microbes to be \"unnatural\" organisms). For\nreasons outlined above, it is not appropriate to generalize\nthese views to the general population, but it seems worth\nspeculating at this point that public perceptions around GM\nmicrobes may be fundamentally different than perceptions\nof other GMOs.\nFinally, on a methodological note, we argue that the\ndesign feature of allowing deliberants to both set the agenda\nfor deliberation as well as work toward collective policy rec-\nommendations illustrates an innovative approach to conduct-\ning public deliberation. In particular, we argue that it is an\napproach that is particularly well suited to addressing com-\nplex and unfamiliar issues like RDX and many other issues\nwhere science and society intersect.\nAuthors' Notes\nResearch team members who provided essential theoretical and\nlogistical support for the public engagement: Alfred Moore, Alice\nHawkins, Aubin Calvert, Cory Fairly, Dan Badulescu, Geoff\nSalomons, Jayme Taylor, Kieran O'Doherty, Michael Burgess,\nMichael MacKenzie, Shauna Nep, and Tamara Ibrahim.\n"
