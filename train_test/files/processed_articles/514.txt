Over the past two decades\nnumerous clinical trials have demonstrated that lowering LDL-C\nreduces cardiovascular risk [2\u00ad11]. Individuals at highest risk of\na cardiovascular event derive the greatest benefit from lowering of\nLDL-C and achievement of LDL-C goals [12]. In the United\nStates, clinical guidelines have been modified to reflect the\nimportance of LDL-C goal achievement in high-risk individuals.\nIn 1993, the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult\nTreatment Panel (ATP) II [13] recommended an LDL-C goal of\nCHD ``equivalent'' conditions to the population appropriate for\npresented an optional high-risk goal of an LDL-C ,70 mg/dL\n[12]. Despite the importance of LDL-C reduction, an achievement\ngap in U.S. individuals at high cardiovascular risk has been\ndescribed [14\u00ad15]. One year after the ATP III recommendations\nto treat those at high risk to an LDL-C ,100 mg/dL, only 32% of\nthe high-risk population in the U.S. met this goal [14]. Over the\npast decade there has been an increase in the availability of potent\nlipid-lowering therapies and increasing evidence supporting the\nbenefits of LDL-C reduction [16]. With increasing knowledge,\neducation, and treatment options the previously described gap in\nLDL-C goal achievement in high-risk individuals may have\nimproved. In 2005, 62% of U.S. CHD patients in a very select\nphysician group achieved an LDL-C ,100 mg/dL [17]. A recent\nreport analyzed the prevalence of high LDL-C levels across\ndifferent risk levels in the National Health and Nutrition\nprevalence of high LDL-C in the U.S. population across each\nrisk category to be improving over the study period [18]. The\nlongitudinal trends in U.S. LDL-C goal achievement at both the\nLDL-C goal of ,70 mg/dL among the high risk subgroups over\nthe past decade have not been described. Defining LDL-C goal\nachievement among the high-risk population and respective\nsubgroups offers an opportunity to examine treatment gaps and\nidentify patient populations to target with preventative therapies.\nThe purpose of our analysis was to describe the longitudinal\nchanges in the prevalence of LDL-C goal achievement in high-risk\nMethods\nThe National Center for Health Statistics performs the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in two-year\nincrements to define the health and nutritional status of the United\nStates population. The NHANES utilizes complex, stratified,\nmultistage sampling techniques based on demographic and\ngeographical data, assigning subjects a weight such that the sum\nrepresents a statistical model of the entire civilian non-institution-\nalized United States population. Methods involve identification of\nprimary sampling units, within which, clusters of households are\nidentified with each person in the household screened for\ndemographic characteristics. The NHANES database has been\nused to develop national health standards, [19] assess disease\nprevalence, [20\u00ad23] identify risk factors for disease development\nand management, [24\u00ad25] and assess the health of the nation [26\u00ad\n27]. Detailed information on NHANES data collection is\npublished and available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.\nhtm.\nInclusions/Exclusions\nwere ages 20\u00ad79 years and met the ATP III definition of ``high\nrisk'' (see below). We excluded participants who were pregnant,\nreceived chemotherapy within 4 weeks of the exam, lacked\ncomplete lipid data including (missing total cholesterol, high\ndensity lipoprotein levels, LDL-C, or triglycerides) or blood\npressure data or had triglyceride measurements $400 mg/dL.\n(Table 1).\nHigh Risk Criteria\nWe defined ``high risk'' according to U.S. ATP III guidelines\n[28] that included those participants with known CHD or one or\nmore CHD risk equivalent conditions including diabetes mellitus,\ncerebrovascular disease, or the presence of two or more ATP III\nrisk factors and a Framingham risk score $ 20% [28]. CHD was\ndefined in the NHANES dataset by self-reported history of\nmyocardial infarction, CHD or angina pectoris. Diabetes mellitus\nwas defined in the NHANES dataset by self-reported history of\ndiabetes or of taking insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic medica-\ntions. Cerebrovascular disease was defined in the NHANES\ndataset by self-reported history of a stroke. The number of ATP III\nrisk factors were summed: age (men $45 years or women $55\nyears), hypertension (blood pressure $140/90 mmHg or use of\nantihypertensive medication), tobacco use (smoked 100+ lifetime\ncigarettes and currently smoking), family history of early CHD\n(defined in NHANES as subjects reporting a heart attack or angina\nin grandparents, parents or siblings ,50 years of age) and high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ,40 mg/dL. An HDL-C\n$60 mg/dL led to subtraction of one risk factor. Framingham risk\nscores were calculated using formulas provided by the Framing-\nham study (Available at: http://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/\nrisk/hrdcoronary.html).\nLipid Goal Achievement\nLow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated\nusing the Friedewald equation, regardless of fasting status [14,29\u00ad\n30]. Weighted mean LDL-C concentrations were calculated for\nthose at high-risk and for the subsets with and without CHD. We\nevaluated achievement of both the ATP III LDL-C goal of\nTo determine those participants who remained eligible for\npharmacotherapy initiation or intensification we evaluated the\nhigh-risk subset with an LDL-C $130 mg/dL. We divided this\ngroup into those with and without CHD, and further divided both\ngroups based on medication use.\nStatistical Analysis\nimported into Microsoft Excel (version 11.2 for Macintosh,\nMicrosoft Corp, Redmond, WA) and into SAS version 9.2 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC). Appendix S1 describes the list of NHANES\nitem codes and descriptions. To account for the complex survey\ndesign of NHANES, SAS PROC SURVEYMEANS was used to\ncalculate standard errors using the Taylor Linearization method\n[31]. The 95% confidence intervals for estimated population\nparameters, p-values for differences in parameters between\nadjacent surveys and p-values for tests of trend over time were\ncalculated using the Wald method. A two-tailed p-value of less\nthan 0.05 was considered to be significant.\nResults\nPrevalence of High-Risk Conditions\nThe prevalence of high-risk participants in the entire eligible\nhigh-risk subgroup with CHD did not significantly change over the\nsubgroup of high-risk participants without CHD increased from\nThe prevalence trends of the diabetes mellitus subgroup increased\ncular disease subgroup increased from 1.8% to 2.7% (p for\ntrend = 0.032) over the five surveys.

Analyses of the NHANES III survey\nin individuals with CHD [32\u00ad34]. A survey of primary clinicians\npopulation achieved the recommended LDL-C goal of less than\nNHANES survey demonstrated improved achievement of LDL-C\nEvaluation ProjecT Utilizing Novel E-Technology (NEPTUNE)\nII, a nationwide survey that recruited from the top 26% statin-\nprescribing physicians evaluated 4,885 patients with dyslipidemia\nand reported that 57% of all high-risk patients and 62% of CHD\n2007, The multinational Lipid Treatment Assessment Project (L-\nTAP) 2 study evaluated 9,955 dyslipidemic patients on lipid-\nlowering therapy. Of the 5,930 high-risk individuals with CHD,\n82% were on statin therapy and 67% reached their country's\nrespective goal LDL-C [36]. While these studies provided\noptimism that achievement of LDL-C goals was improving, they\nwere performed in highly selective clinician or patient cohorts.\nThis study, in contrast, measures LDL-C goal achievement\nlevels in an U.S. representative high-risk population, providing\na comparison for historical cohort studies of LDL-C goal\nachievement. Improvements in achieving an LDL-C ,100 mg/\ndL goal appeared to occur in plateaus following the release of the\nATP III guideline in 2001 [28] and ATP III update guidelines in\n2004 [12]. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the study it is not\npossible to determine causality; however, release of guidelines may\nbe one explanation for the timing of these improvements. Our\nstudy provides optimism that LDL-C goal achievement trends in\nthe United States are improving and are consistent with the high\ngoal achievement rates seen in highly selective cohorts.\nCHD Compared with Non-CHD High Risk\nLDL-C goal achievement improved in both the ``high risk with\nCHD'' subgroup and the ``high risk without CHD'' subgroup over\nthe time period of the five surveys (p,0.0001 for both).\nFurthermore, the subgroup of ``high risk with CHD'' had\nand lower rates of LDL-C $130 mg/dL (p = 0.02) compared with\nThe ``high risk without CHD'' subset had a higher rate of LDL-C\nobserved differences in LDL-C goal achievement and lipid\nmedication use between the CHD and non-CHD subsets are\nlikely the result of multiple causes. The high risk without CHD\npopulation in this analysis included those with diabetes mellitus,\nthe presence of two or more ATP III risk factors and\na Framingham risk score $ 20% or cerebrovascular disease.\nThe lipid goal achievement gap in diabetic patients has been well\ndescribed in the literature and represents numerous factors from\nfailure to treat to the difficulty of clinical inertia in clinical practice.\n[37\u00ad39] The LDL-C achievement gap in individuals at high risk\nby Framingham risk score alone may be due to under recognition.\nCardiovascular risk score calculation is low within primary care\npractices, with one report indicating cardiovascular risk calcula-\ntion rates of ,17% in primary care offices [40]. Thus, the failure\nto treat this group with two or more risk factors and a Framingham\nrisk score may be the result of not appropriately identifying\npatients at risk. The lack of LDL-C goal achievement in those\npatients high risk secondary to cerebrovascular disease may also\nrepresent a combination lack of knowledge of lipid goals and\nclinical inertia. The importance of use of lipid lowering medication\nin patients with CHD is well established with a ,30% reduction in\nCHD mortality. The benefits of lipid lowering medications in\npatients with a history of ischemic stroke is less well established\nWhatever the underlying reasons may be for the LDL-C\nachievement gap between the high risk populations with and\nwithout CHD this finding underscores the need to target\neducational and awareness efforts at high-risk patients without\nestablished CHD.\nLimitations/Strengths\nThis is a serial cross-sectional analysis with limitations inherent\nto the NHANES survey, including statistical modeling and\nselection bias. The generalizability of these findings outside the\nU.S. population may be limited as the NHANES are a population\nbased statistical model of the entire civilian noninstitutionalized\nUnited States population. The NHANES questionnaires rely on\nself-report and may be subject to misunderstanding and recall bias.\nNHANES does not include incarcerated or institutionalized\nindividuals. Some of the NHANES variables do not match the\ndefinitions set forth in the ATP III guidelines precisely so some\nmisclassification may have occurred. For example, the NHANES\ndefines a positive family history of CHD as a parent or\ngrandparent experiencing a myocardial infarction or angina\nunder the age of 50 years without gender differentiation. The\nATP III guideline defines a positive family history of CHD as a risk\nfactor if CHD afflicts a first degree male relative under the age of\n55 years, or a first degree female relative under the age of 65 years\n[28]. The NHANES survey does not include testing for aortic\naneurysms, a history of aortic surgery and does not include\nTrends in LDL-C Goal Achievement\na question regarding claudication. Also, the NHANES survey\nstopped collecting data on ankle-brachial index after the 2003\u00ad\n2004 survey. This could result in an underestimation of those with\nperipheral vascular disease. However, those eligible for inclusion\nwith ankle-brachial indices ,0.9 represent a very small portion of\nthe high risk population. Responses to questions regarding current\nuse of lipid medications are subject to recall bias and mis-\nunderstanding. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design of\nNHANES makes the treatment effects of the lipid medications\nimpossible to assess.\nConclusion\nOverall, the United States population at high risk for\ncardiovascular disease experienced significant increases in the\nproportion of individuals achieving LDL-C goals of ,100 mg/dL\nand ,70 mg/dL. There also has been a significant decline in the\nproportion of the high-risk population with LDL-C $130 mg/dL\nand not on lipid medications.\nSupporting Information\nAppendix S1 NHANES Item ID and Descriptions.\nAuthor Contributions\nConceived and designed the experiments: MT JK KK MC JS RG.\nPerformed the experiments: MT JK KK MC JS RG.
