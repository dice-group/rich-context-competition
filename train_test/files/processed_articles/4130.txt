Introduction: Points of Agreement\nEvolution, Gender, and Rape (January 29, 2003; MIT Press; henceforth\nreferred to as EGR) is an edited collection of 17 essays purportedly \"evaluating\"\nour recent book, A Natural History of Rape: Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion\n(Thornhill and Palmer, 2000, MIT Press). There are many accurate points raised\nin these essays, points that are also made in A Natural History of Rape\n(henceforth referred to as ANHR). For example, Travis states that \"[i]n every\ncase, natural selection occurs in a gene\u00adenvironment context\" (Travis, p. 8; see\nmeans there is no \"categorical divide between `nature' and `nurture'\" (Travis, p.\n18; ANHR, pp. 22-30). Such \"a conceptualization of biological influences not as\nhardwiring but as potential pathways that are shaped by the environment can lead\nto research with practical implications\" (Koss, p. 202; ANHR, pp. 22-30). When\nattempting such an explanation of human behavior, a crucial part of the\nenvironment is \"cultural transmission\" (Travis, p. 18), because \"culture and social\nstructure can influence behavior\" (Eagly and Wood, p. 278; ANHR, pp. 15, 24-\nevidence to indicate that ordinary men . . . engage in rape\" (Travis, p. 213), in all\nremember that \"not all men engage in rape behavior, even when in positions that\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nwould permit rape. Thus, there are different developmental outcomes and\nvariation among individuals. Some of this variation may be cultural context and\nthe natural basis of rape might be, culture exists to override these tendencies\"\nduring a male's development that might be particularly important in overriding\ntendencies to rape is the presence of a father (Mackey, p. 313; ANHR, p. 175).\nFurther, when attempting to provide an evolutionary explanation of rape, it is\ncrucial to remember \"when an act of rape occurs, some combination of\npsychological features that humans have evolved to have must combine with\nenvironmental stimuli to prompt it\" (Vickers and Kitcher, p. 158-159; ANHR,\nChapters 2 & 3). It is also crucial to remember that \"[a]s with all behavioral\nadaptations, the rapist need not be conscious of the evolutionary well-springs of\nhis actions, just as we do not ponder the need to stoke our metabolism when\nsitting down to dinner\" (Coyne, p. 177; ANHR, Chapter 2). Evolutionary\nexplanations also need to realize that because of \"the significant role that females\nplay in reproductive decisions\" (Travis, p. 17), females and males are not only\nequal forces in evolution (Gowaty, p. 62), \"women are powerful selective forces\"\n(Gowaty, p.61; ANHR, pp. 31-52). This is one of the reasons why most\nevolutionists believe that males and females evolved to differ in aggression and in\nsexual behavior (Coyne, p.174; ANHR, 31-52). One result is that \"some men\ninterpret women's behavior in more sexualized ways than it was intended\" (White\nand Post, p. 398; ANHR, p. 179). Men also are expected to exert unwanted sexual\nattention toward some women more than others because \"primate females do vary\nconsiderably in their reproductive efficacy and it would be to any male's\nadvantage to pay attention to these individual differences among females\"\nFurther still, when attempting to identify the specific evolutionary basis of\nrape, there is a \"need to consider alternative hypotheses\" (Vickers and Kitcher, p.\n140). The adaptation and by-product hypotheses for rape \"are not, in fact,\nexhaustive\" (Lloyd, p. 245), indeed there are at least eight other possible\nevolutionary hypotheses (ANHR, pp. 53-84). It is particularly important to\nconsider the by-product hypothesis because \"[t]he phenomenon of evolutionary\nby-products is frequent in human evolution\" (Lloyd, p. 237; ANHR, pp. 60-62).\nHence, it is crucial not to simply accept the specific-rape-adaptation hypothesis as\na fact in the manner of a \"just-so\" story (Coyne, p. 173; ANHR, pp. 53-84). Rape\nwas not as successful a strategy as fathering (Mackey, p. 306; see ANHR, p. 63\nfor reasons this doesn't rule out rape-specific adaptation), and the chances of\npregnancy from a single act of intercourse such as rape probably have been\nrelatively low (ANHR, pp. 99-100; but see Gottschall and Gottschall, in press).\nMoreover, there were often high costs associated with rape (Travis, p. 215;\nANHR, p. 60). Therefore, evidence is needed of some aspect of human males that\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nis functionally designed to produce rape when the benefits outweigh the costs\n(ANHR, Chapter 3). Existing evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate such rape-\nspecific adaptations in human males (EGR is described on its back cover as\n\"[m]ultidisciplinary critiques of the notion of rape as an evolutionary\nadaptation\"); hence, \"the question whether rape is an adaptation or a by-product\ncannot yet be definitively answered\" (ANHR, p. 84).\nAlso, since rape would have had negative fitness consequences for females,\n\"under either evolutionary scenario [of the cause of rape], females are also\nhypothesized to have evolved rape-related adaptations... \" (Lloyd, p. 238).\nIndeed, there is abundant evidence of \"specialized physical, structural and\nbehavioral female `barriers' to forced copulation\" (Drea and Wallen, p. 29). These\ninclude female\u00adfemale alliances (Drea and Wallen, pp. 41-42), female\nmanipulation of sperm competition (Drea and Wallen, pp. 49-50), and seeking\nFinally, the evolutionary approach to the causes of rape is in direct contrast to\nthe approaches that have dominated social science theories about rape, which see\nrape as primarily, if not exclusively, caused by social and cultural factors. One of\nthe reasons the evolutionary approach's challenge to these theories is so\ncontroversial is that \"[g]ender politics are nowhere more profound than in the area\n\"it is true that in recent decades the discussion of rape has been dominated by\nsuch notions [as `rape is not about sex, but about violence and power'],\" which\nwas proclaimed for political rather than scientific reasons (Coyne, p. 176). Given\nthat ANHR challenged this proclamation, and the fact that \"media accounts\ndistorted, exaggerated, misinterpreted, and over-generalized the findings [of\nbooks that make such challenges]\" (Travis, p. 15), it is not surprising that media\ncoverage of ANHR has been largely negative. Further, despite ANHR's many\nwarnings against making the naturalistic fallacy, many reactions to ANHR were\nOn the basis of this impressive amount of agreement, one might expect that\nEGR's evaluation of ANHR was positive, or at least balanced. Nothing could be\nfurther from the truth. In describing the contributors to the book, Travis states, in\nwhat is a classic example of understatement, \"None finds the evolutionary\naccount of rape to be in any way compelling\" (Travis, p. 17). Actually, except for\nthe two articles that barely mention ANHR (Gowaty, Mackey) and the one article\nthat doesn't mention it at all (Eagly and Wood), the contributors appear to be in\ncompetition with each other to come up with the most disparaging adjective.\nKimmel clearly wins the insult contest with his rampage that includes the words\nsilly, unwarranted, preposterously reductionist, vainglorious and self-promoting,\npreposterous, narcissistically self-aggrandizing, nonsense, dreadfully poor,\nideological fantasies of those who justify sexual coercion, bad science, bad\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nhistory, bad politics and appallingly badly written (pp. 221-222). Kimmel's moral\nindignation over ANHR is so great that he is even compelled to speculate on the\nauthors' personal lives, including how often they've had sex (p. 225). Even in a\nfield marked by controversy, the treatment of ANHR is so unprofessional that\nVickers and Kitcher devote a section of their article to justifying it: \"In defense of\nIrreverence.\"\nThis raises the obvious question of how a collection of articles that agrees\nwith so many of the points raised in a book could condemn that same book so\nvehemently. Obviously, none of the points of agreement just presented are\nacknowledged by the contributors to EGR, but that is only a small part of the\nanswer.\nII. A \"Sticker Book\" (Misrepresentations and False Accusations)\nTen thousand copies of Introducing Evolutionary Psychology (Evans and\nZarate, 1999) have a sticker on p. 155 stating that the words attributed to Steven\nRose concerning cultural determinism \"is a misleading caricature of his [Rose's]\nviews.\" If the same standards and procedures were to be applied to EGR, it would\nliterally become a \"sticker book\" filled with such apologetic stickers. Many of\nthese stickers would point out that the portrayal of ANHR as a kind of biological\n(genetic) determinism that ignores cultural and other environmental factors, and\nsees behaviors as \"fixed\" and \"inevitable,\" is at least as misleading as the\nstatements about Rose that caused him to obtain the \"legal advice\" (Symons,\nbiological (genetic) determinism, however, are much less objectionable than\nRosser's accusation that the authors of ANHR are \"like the nineteenth-century\nMany additional stickers would be needed to cover the instances where\nANHR is falsely portrayed as arguing that rape is an adaptation (Drea and Wallen,\nPost, p. 384; Rosser, p. 417). Although this type of mischaracterization seems\nmore benign, it has even greater implications because so much of EGR consists of\ncriticisms of ANHR for arguing that human rape is an adaptation. To make their\ncriticism, the contributors use a number of tactics to circumvent the fact that\nANHR explicitly states that \"the question whether rape is an adaptation or a by-\nproduct cannot yet be definitively answered\" (ANHR, p. 84). Some acknowledge\nour consideration of the by-product hypothesis, but then portray it as being\nessentially the same as the adaptation hypothesis by falsely claiming that both\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\npredict rape increased reproductive success (see Lloyd, p. 249; Mackey, p. 305;\nSanday, p. 342). Others assert that although we mention the by-product\nhypothesis, we actually argue for the adaptation hypothesis. For example, Lloyd\nasserts that the adaptation hypothesis is our \"primary\" hypothesis (p. 237;\nemphasis in original; see also Koss, p. 192). None of the contributors point out\nthat ANHR anticipated such a misinterpretation about which hypothesis was\nview that complex traits should be considered adaptations only if they cannot be\naccounted for as by-products, we will examine the by-product hypothesis first\" (p.\nThe strangest of the misrepresentations is presented by Coyne, who not only\nportrays our consideration of alternative hypotheses as an ingenious rhetorical\n\"trick,\" but asserts that, \"[a]lthough Palmer himself professes to favor the by-\nproduct hypothesis, the authors continuously push the mixture of directly adaptive\ntheories that I have just described. The direct-selection theory first appears in the\nfourth chapter, and the remaining eight are devoted to discussing this theory alone\nand its implications for society\" (p. 178). What is so strange about this is that all\nof the discussion of both the by-product hypothesis and the adaptation hypothesis\nabout why human males rape is in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 examines the hypothesis\nthat human females have anti-rape adaptations. Evidently, Coyne fails to\nunderstand that these two questions are independent since both the rape-as-\nadaptation and the rape-as-by-product hypotheses would predict the evolution of\nanti-rape adaptations in females (see Lloyd, p. 238). Similarly, the remaining\nchapters of ANHR are no more \"supportive\" of the adaptation hypothesis than\nthey are of the by-product hypothesis.\nEqually confounding is Coyne's assertion that we provide a series of\npredictions that are \"all supposedly verified by the author's research\" (Coyne, p.\n180). ANHR does provide a series of predictions concerning \"Potential Rape\nAdaptations in Men\" (ANHR, p. 64, emphasis added), but these aren't what\nCoyne describes. Further, as previously stated, we emphasize that none of these\npredictions have been verified (unfortunately, none of the contributors to EGR\nmake serious attempts to test any of these predictions).\nCoyne's motivation to portray ANHR as an argument for rape-specific\nadaptation seems to come from the fact that he himself finds the by-product\nhypothesis \"a reasonable view . . . that few biologists will find objectionable,\" and\nthat \"might readily explain rape\" (Coyne, p. 175). Amazingly, Coyne then states\nthat \"[w]e can thus dismiss the by-product hypothesis, because there is no\nconceivable observation that could disprove it.\" (p. 177). This is based on his\nassertion that ANHR doesn't specify testable predictions about the adaptations\nthat produce human rape as a by-product. This assertion is false because ANHR\ndoes specify the adaptations that might produce rape as a by-product (ANHR, pp.\n60-63), some of which are discussed by Travis (p. 208). If any of the authors\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nacknowledged that ANHR explicitly says that, on the basis of current evidence,\nrape cannot be shown to be an adaptation in humans, the irrelevance of many,\nperhaps most, of the criticisms in EGR would be starkly apparent.\nStickers also should be placed on a number of pages where ANHR is accused\nof ignoring women and their role in evolution. For example, Drea and Wallen\nassert that ANHR \"ignores the significant role that females play in reproductive\ndecisions\" (p. 29). Gowaty asserts that ANHR \"prematurely rejected insights and\nevolutionary hypotheses about the nature of coercive sexuality from the\nperspective of females\" (p. 81), and Travis asserts that ANHR gives \"little or no\nattention to the co-evolution of female reproductive strategies. It is as if females\ndid not evolve at all\" (p. 214). For a discussion of the role of females in evolution,\nsee Chapter 2 of ANHR, and for a discussion of their evolution specifically\nrelated to rape, see especially pp. 97-104. As for the accusation by Rosser that\nANHR interprets \"females as inferior to males\" (p. 420), we simply point out that\nit is made without any supporting evidence.\nStickers should also be put on the even more serious charge that ANHR is a\nand Kimmel (p. 232) make the unsubstantiated charge that ANHR could be used\nby defense lawyers (see Jones 2000 for reasons to doubt such a possibility).\nKimmel describes ANHR as \"the ideological fantasies of those who justify sexual\ncoercion\" (p. 222), and Martin states that our stance is \"insidious because, their\nprotestations to the contrary, their account actually amounts to an incitement to\nrape\" (p. 378). Since all of these accusations clearly are based on the naturalistic\nfallacy, one might think that our attempts \"to deter this reaction repeatedly\"\n(Lloyd, p. 255; previously cited pages from ANHR) would be praised. Lloyd,\nhowever, claims that we were still \"irresponsible\" because some readers still\nmade the naturalistic fallacy (p. 259). Although it could be argued that ANHR\nshould have warned readers against the naturalistic fallacy on even more than the\npreviously cited 18 pages, there is also the question of the responsibility of the\npreviously listed contributors to EGR that justify and promote reactions based on\nthe naturalistic fallacy.\nAs serious as all of these misrepresentations are, EGR contains two even more\nexplicit and serious charges. The first is by Coyne who accuses us of\nmisrepresenting data on the psychological pain of rape victims: \"Lacking the time\nto look up every citation, I decided to check three claims about rape taken from\nThornhill's own earlier publications. I was shocked to find that none of these\nclaims are supported by the cited articles\" (Coyne, pp. 182-183; see also Lloyd's\naccusation on p. 257 of \"data-fudging,\" evidently based on this accusation by\nCoyne). All of these concern ANHR's claim about differences in the emotional\nresponses to rape in reproductive-age females and females who are younger or\nolder. \"In the three publications by Thornhill and Thornhill, the data show that\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nwhile younger women (under twelve years) do indeed experience less trauma,\nviolence, and vaginal rape than do reproductive-age women between the ages of\ntwelve and forty-four, older women do not differ from reproductive-age females.\nThornhill and Palmer thus achieve their `supportive' results by statistical sleight\nof hand . . . This is not the way that scientists normally behave\" (Coyne, p. 183;\nemphasis in original). Coyne then states, \"I emphasize again that these are the\nonly bits of supporting `evidence' that I checked. Did I happen, by chance, to find\nthe only three inaccurate citations in the book?\" (p. 184). The cause of Coyne's\nmisunderstanding appears to be very simple. Although he took the time to start\nreading the original article, evidently his \"shock\" (or perhaps \"joy\"?) was so great\nthat he evidently failed to read far enough into the article to reach the discussion\nand associated table of results showing the asserted relationship (see Table 4,\nAppendix 3 of N.W. Thornhill and R. Thornhill, 1990). Coyne's accusations are\nfalse.\nWe responded to this criticism of Coyne's earlier. Indeed, we responded to\nvirtually all the criticisms of EGR in our 2001 publication, New Preface, \"Rape\nand Evolution: A Reply to our Critics,\" on MIT Press' web site for the paperback\nedition of our book. MIT published EGR and surely alerted the EGR authors to\nour response to critics. Of course, it was not MIT Press' responsibility to ensure\nthat EGR authors had read Palmer and Thornhill's latest comments and replies to\ncritics; it was the responsibility of the authors of EGR to evaluate this material.\nHad these authors paid attention to our response, as is characteristic of real\nscholarship, there would have been no basis for duplicating the vacuous criticisms\nin EGR.\nAn even stronger accusation is made by Kimmel: \"Thornhill and Palmer's use\nof evidence is so selective that it may well constitute scholarly fraud\" (p. 225). To\nsupport this serious accusation, Kimmel states: \"`In some animal species,' they\nwrite, `rape is commonplace'\" (p. 225). Why is this fraud? According to Kimmel,\nbecause \"the absence of rape behaviors has been equally found for varieties of\nthose species as well. Oops.\" (p.225). Our motive for this \"fraud\" is, according to\nKimmel, that the existence of species without rape is a fact we are \"utterly unable\nto explain\" (p. 226). To be honest, we are not entirely clear about what exactly we\nare supposed to have done. Our guess is that he is accusing us of claiming that\nrape occurs in all species when it clearly doesn't. Such a claim clearly would be\nfalse (although we don't really see how the word \"fraud\" would apply), but\nANHR does not contain anything like this claim. ANHR does claim that rape\noccurs \"widely,\" but it never claims that rape occurs in all species. Further,\nANHR discusses at some length why evolutionary theory predicts that rape\nshould occur in some species, but not in others. ANHR suggests that rape (at least\nrape by males) should be found only in polygynous species, and then only when\nthe benefits have outweighed the costs (see Chapters 2 and 3). ANHR also states\nthat \"[r]esearchers have just begun to examine the cross-species presence and\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nabsence of rape and other sexual coercion in the light of ecological variables that\nare hypothesized to affect female vulnerability and selection pressures\" (ANHR,\np. 146; emphasis added). Needless to say, some very large stickers would be\nneeded for the chapters by Coyne and Kimmel.\nIII.EGR's Alternative View of Evolution, Gender, and Rape\nGiven that EGR distorts the content of ANHR to the extent that it cannot\nreally be considered an evaluation of that book, EGR might be best evaluated in\nterms of its own contribution to the understanding of evolution, gender, and rape.\nEGR's view of evolution\nThe contributors to EGR appear to agree with the theory of evolution,\nalthough Martin seems to suggest that it may be no more than a reflection of\nWestern cultural values. There is much less agreement when it comes to the\nevolution of male\u00adfemale differences, particularly Darwin's theory of sexual\nselection and its refinement by Trivers (1972). With regard to this theory, Lloyd\npoints out that, \"This is a standard view among many biologists working in\nhuman and animal evolution.\" (p. 258). However, Rosser states that, \"[i]n contrast\nto accepting his theory of natural selection, many feminist scientists have\ncritiqued Darwin's theory of sexual selection for its androcentric bias\" (p. 414),\nand Travis leaves sexual selection conspicuously out of her introductory overview\nof evolutionary theory. Similarly, Vickers and Kitcher praise Hamilton and\nMaynard Smith, and even Boyd and Richerson, but make no mention of Trivers.\nKoss refers to \"the old [evidently implying no longer accepted] concept of\ndifferential parental investment (Trivers 1972)\" (p. 193). Kimmel is much more\ndirect, referring to \"Robert Trivers's reductionist evolutionary theory\" (p. 223)\nand asserting that \"Trivers's arguments have been effectively refuted by\nprimatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy. . . .\" (p. 224).\nIn regard to the work on sex differences by David Buss, Vickers and Kitcher\ndevote more than a dozen pages to disparaging it and seem to doubt if any of the\nmale\u00adfemale differences found by Buss actually exist (pp. 146-154). In contrast,\nMackey seems to accept Buss's work, and Eagly and Wood even refer to Buss's\n\"impressive study\" (p. 283). Eagly and Wood's acceptance of the male\u00adfemale\ndifferences found by Buss is not surprising given that their paper is a presentation\nof their alternative explanation of those differences. Their alternative is that\nnatural selection has produced adaptations in both the bodies and brains of\nhumans (although they list only a few general adaptations in the brains). Further,\nnatural selection has produced differences in the bodies of males and females.\nHowever, natural selection, according to Eagly and Wood, has failed to produce\nany differences in the brains (i.e., psychology) of men and women. No\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nexplanation for this arbitrary selectiveness of natural selection is provided (for\nearlier critiques of this theory, see Buss, 1996).\nWith regard to the specific discipline of evolutionary psychology/\nsociobiology, Lloyd refers to it as a \"fringe version of the actual theory of\nevolution\" (p.243) because it downplays such factors as drift, mutation, gene flow\nand phyletic inertia. Vickers and Kitcher contrast the practitioners of this\napproach with the noble evolutionary \"workers on social insects or sage grouse\"\n(p. 163), evidently forgetting Thornhill's work on insects and birds, as well as\nContradictory and inaccurate views are found on other aspects of evolution.\nFor example, several of the contributors make the assertion that for rape to be an\nadaptation, rapists must differ genetically from non-rapists (Travis, pp. 19-20,\n212), possibly stemming from the mistaken notion that \"heritability\" is equivalent\nto \"inheritable\" (Lloyd, p. 241; see ANHR, pp. 22 for reasons why this view is\nincorrect). There is also disagreement over the plausibility of group (or multi-\nlevel) selection. Tobach and Reed state that, \"[t]he prevailing conceptualization of\nnatural selection is that it is primarily based on individual survival\" (p. 108), but\nGowaty (p. 61) and Koss (p. 201) criticize ANHR for using this standard view.\nThere is similar inconsistency over the concept of the environments of\nevolutionary adaptedness (EEA) (see Shields and Steinke, p.98; Coyne, p. 179;\nTravis, p. 209), with Gowaty even making the seemingly bizarre assertion that the\nbest \"estimate of the human EEA might be our parent's generation\" (p. 69).\nWe suggest that the key to understanding these seemingly arbitrary\ndisagreements over aspects of evolutionary theory is the lame view that\nevolutionary theories can be evaluated on the basis of their compatibility with\ncertain ideological goals. Gowaty states that her \"paper shows again what Hrdy\nhas shown repeatedly. Hypotheses sparked by feminist consciousness can be both\ncompletely consistent with Darwinian explanations of behavior and testable\" (p.\n62). This is certainly true. The question is, what happens when Darwinian\nexplanations are not consistent with \"feminist consciousness.\" EGR indicates that\nthey not only stop being \"of interest\" to some feminists, they are arbitrarily\nrejected.\nPerhaps the most fundamental misunderstanding of evolution found in EGR\nconcerns the meaning of proximate and ultimate. Several of the authors confuse\nultimate reproductive consequences in the past with proximate motivations of\ncurrent behavior. Drea and Wallen talk about whether or not rapists are\n\"expecting progeny\" (p. 32), and then use this misunderstanding in their personal\nattack on the authors of ANHR: \"It is undoubtedly true that there are males who\nmay try rape as a reproductive strategy, just as there are, apparently, academics\nwho promote the idea as an academic strategy\" (p. 52; see also Coyne, pp. 172,\nSteinke's entire chapter criticizing ANHR's use of self-reported data appears to\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nbe based on their confusion of an ultimate cause with an unconscious proximate\ncause. For example they refer to \"... the impulses and attractions [which are\nproximate causes] that Thornhill and Palmer hypothesize as the ultimate\nexplanations for rape and reactions to it\" (Shields and Steinke, p. 91; emphasis\nadded). This confusion is obviously at the base of their assertion that \"Because\nevolutionary psychologists try to probe ultimate explanations, which they assume\nto exert an effect on us without our explicit awareness of the mechanics of those\neffects, they have an especially heavy burden of proof\" (p. 90).\nEGR's views on gender\nLloyd criticizes ANHR for \"a caricature of social scientists, who supposedly\nbelieve in `cultural determinism'\" (p. 250). However, numerous statements by\ncontributors indicate that \"the idea that biology doesn't much matter\" (Wright,\n1994, p. 5; what Tooby and Cosmides call the \"standard social science model\") is\nstill a very widely accepted view. For example, Travis asserts that \"[t]he\nunderstanding, meaning, and significance accorded actions are derived not from\nbiological features, but from society and culture\" (p. 22), and that \"sociocultural,\nsocialization, and socioemotional experiences of men provide a compelling and\ncomprehensive account of variations in men's violence toward women\" (p. 23).\nTobach and Reed state that it is \"possible to view sexuality as a sociosocietal\nprocess\" (p. 127). Travis states that sex is \"a function of social constructions\" (p.\n210), \"[r]esearch findings of greater male inclinations toward casual sex may\nreflect a variety of social, rather than biological, conditions\" (p. 211), and we\nneed \"to understand rape as a social and cultural phenomenon\" (p. 218). Eagly\nand Wood state \"[s]ex differences in behavior thus reflect contemporaneous social\nconditions\" (p. 278). Sanday states that in some cultures \"rape is the playing out\nof a sociocultural script\" (p. 341). White and Post praise Brownmiller for\naddressing rape as a \"nonbiological event. She conceptualized rape as a cultural\nphenomenon\" (p. 383). White and Post also concur with ANHR's conclusion that\n\"social learning theories . . . stress the differential socialization experiences of\nmen and women\" and \"[g]ender socialization theories explain rape as rooted in\nthe dominant culture\" (p. 391). They also state that \"men rape because they have\nlearned that rape is acceptable and normal behavior\" (p. 392). Finally, Sanday\nappears to concur with ANHR's description of \"the feminist social-science\nexplanation of rape\" when she states \"[w]ith its emphasis on the role of culture,\nthe `feminist social-science explanation of rape,' which Thornhill and Palmer\ndenigrate as bad science, has a better chance [to explain rape]\" (pp. 358-359).\nClearly, the contributors to EGR still see culture as both separate from biology\nand capable of determining, or nearly determining, human behavior, including\nbehavioral differences between males and females.\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nEGR's views on rape\nEGR's views on rape are even more inconsistent than its views on evolution.\nFirst, there is little agreement on the definition of rape, or even on whether or not\na definition is possible, as well as the baffling false assertion that ANHR's\ndefinition restricts the definition of rape to only acts that lead to reproduction\nThere also is disagreement on whether or not rape is the act of only\npsychopaths/sociopaths. Travis praises feminist researchers for refuting the\n\"common myth\" that rape is a rare event perpetrated only by \"sociopaths\" (p. 3),\nand points out that \"there is plenty of evidence to indicate that ordinary men . . .\nengage in rape\" (p. 213). However, Tobach and Reed (p. 114) support the\npsychopathology explanation of rape. Similarly, Lloyd asks, \"[a]nd what\nhappened to the patently obvious hypothesis that raping behavior is due to\npsychopathology?\" (p. 247). Lloyd also praises Geoffrey Miller for favoring the\npsychopathology hypothesis, an act that evidently removes Miller from the\n\"fringe\" category of evolutionist (p. 258). Kimmel even makes the accusation that\nthe authors of ANHR \"hate men\" because they suggest that ordinary non-\npsychopathological males might commit rape under some circumstances: \"the\nhypothesized male propensity for rape is an unacknowledged form of male\nbashing where all men are painted with a common brush as violent, rapacious\npredators\" (p. 231). This view is even more puzzling given that two pages earlier\nKimmel claimed that men of his generation \"would have to confess that virtually\nall of us are `failed attempted date rapists'\" (p. 229).\nThere also seems to be considerable confusion over whether or not rape is a\nhuman universal. The term \"universal\" in anthropology usually means \"a trait\npublished a paper whose \"first general hypothesis\" was that \"sexual assault is not\na universal characteristic of tribal societies\" (1981, p.9; emphasis in original).\nThis was based on the reported finding that 45 out of 95 cultures in her sample\nwere \"rape-free.\" However, she was using both the term \"universal\" and the term\n\"free\" in very unusual ways. By \"not universal,\" she meant only that \"[t]he\nincidence of rape varies cross-culturally\" (Sanday, 1981, p. 9). In her chapter in\nEGR she also explains, \"My rape-free code was based on reporting by\nethnographers that rape is rare or absent. I did not take the ethnographers to mean\nthat rape was literally absent, only that they found no evidence that rape was\ncommonplace\" (p. 359). There can be little doubt that the frequency of rape, like\nthe frequency of nearly all human behaviors, varies from one culture to another.\nHowever, Sanday did not measure the actual frequencies of rape. She relied on\nquestionable ethnographic reports (see Palmer, 1989) of such things as the\npresence or absence of \"ceremonial\" rapes on which to base her codings. Hence,\nher conclusions about correlations between the frequency of rape and other\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nfactors is highly speculative. This is why ANHR, drawing upon a re-examination\nof the ethnographic evidence on rape (Palmer, 1989), pointed out that what the\nethnographic evidence actually demonstrates is that rape not only occurs in all\nknown human societies, it does so despite being subject to punishment in all\nknown human societies (ANHR, pp. 140-143). In her chapter, Sanday refutes this\nposition by simply repeating her 1981 assertion that \"the incidence of rape is not\nconstant cross-culturally\" (p. 340), and by describing one more culture, the\nMinangkabau, where rape appears to be rare (again, no statistics are presented),\nbut does occur despite being subject to punishment (p. 355). She then says that\n\"Thornhill and Palmer come close to my conclusions regarding variation in the\nincidence of rape when they say that `[t]he ethnographic evidence indicates that\nsome frequency of rape is typical of Homo sapiens . . . (2000, p. 142; emphasis\nmine)\" (p. 359). Then, surprisingly, she states, \"However, I disagree with their\nconclusion that `human males in all societies so far examined in the ethnographic\nrecord possess genes that can lead, by way of ontogeny, to raping behavior. . . .\"\n(p. 359-360). We fail to understand her reason for rejecting this conclusion, just as\nwe fail to understand Travis's assertion that Sanday's finding \"directly\nundermines at least some of the support for the proposal that rape evolved among\nmen more or less universally\" (p. 22), or Rosser's claim that \"[t]hus, human rape\nvaries tremendously across cultures within the species, thereby refuting the notion\nof Thornhill and Palmer that rape is universal and adaptive\" (pp. 418-419). Our\nguess is that these authors fail to acknowledge that both the by-product and\nadaptation hypotheses predict that the frequency of rape will fluctuate with\nenvironmental, including social and cultural, variables (ANHR, pp. 140-143). As\nto Kimmel's assertion that \"[w]e have evidence of the absence of rape\" in\n\"several cultures\" (p. 226), we would just like to point out that he provides no\nevidence or supporting citations.\nOne of the most important contradictions in EGR concerns the ways that\nwomen can avoid being raped. Several of the contributors criticize ANHR for\nsuggesting that a woman's physical appearance, as influenced by such factors as\nage and dress, as well as such behavior as avoiding being alone with males near\nthe beginning of relationships, could influence her chances of being raped\n185). This criticism is usually based on the assertion that this position \"blames\nwomen\" for rape. For example, Kimmel says it is \"silly because it blames the\nvictim\" (230). However, there is a crucially important difference of opinion\nunderlying this seeming unanimity. On the one hand, several authors condemned\nus for asserting that women could do anything to lessen the chances of being\nraped. For example, Vickers and Kitcher state that \"[a]ny sensible approach to\nrape education should be freed from suggestions of female responsibility or\ncomplicity\" (p. 165). Koss even asserts that \"[t]he entire premise [of ANHR's\nsuggestion] is based on an empirically unfounded assumption that women can\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nprotect themselves from rape\" (p. 198), and that \"[a]dvice on women's dress and\nconduct should be rejected not only because it is unscientific, but also because of\nits tacit assumption that women have a responsibility to act `reasonably' and live\ntheir lives in fear of rape. This thinking is absolutely unacceptable in a democratic\nsociety\" (p. 199). This view is in direct contradiction to the reason Coyne\ncriticizes ANHR's suggestions. Coyne criticizes ANHR's suggestion to \"urge\nwomen to avoid secluded spots\" because it is \"obvious and derivable from\nnonevolutionary views of rape\" (p. 185). Similarly, Lloyd states that \"[a]s far as\nrape prevention goes, their [ANHR's] suggestions are nearly all features that have\nbeen central to the feminist revolution in rape counseling: advising caution about\nbeing alone in isolated places; advocating self-defense training; urging women to\nexert greater control over circumstances `in which they consent to be alone with\nsuggestion that a women's behavior can reduce her chances of being raped is\n\"blaming the victim,\" then the existing feminist suggestions for preventing rape\nalso have been \"blaming the victim.\" This indicates that the real reason behind the\ncriticism of ANHR's assertion that a women's appearance might be one of those\nfactors (which is certainly going to be the case if sexual desire is one of the\nmotivations of rapists, see below) is not because it blames women. Lloyd provides\nthe real reason when she points out that \"[t]hey [the authors of ANHR] differ\nfrom feminist advice [only] in their recommendation that women wear more con-\ncealing clothing\" (p. 257). Women can obviously do a great many things to lessen\ntheir chances of being raped, and the contrary view is not only \"silly,\" it is\nsocially irresponsible. The rejection of any particular tactic to reduce the chances\nof being raped simply because it differs from feminist advice also is socially\nirresponsible.\nThis brings us to the question of the role of sexual desire in the motivation of\nrapists. As Coyne points out, the starting point of this discussion is the fact that\n\"[i]t is true that in recent decades the discussion of rape has been dominated by\nsuch notions\" as \"rape is not about sex, but about violence and power\" (p. 176;\nsee also Koss, p. 192; Drea and Wallen, pp. 32, 38). When Palmer first challenged\nthis \"notion\" (Palmer, 1988) a colleague reported that reading his challenge was\nlike being in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale when the child speaks up and\nsays the emperor isn't wearing any clothes. This is because the claim that rapists\nare not sexually motivated, like the assertion that the naked emperor was clothed\nin the finest robes, \"originated not as scientific propositions but as political\nslogans\" (Coyne, p. 176). Coyne seems to see this as excusing the presentation of\nsuch claims as if they were scientific propositions, but Andersen clearly saw such\npolitically motivated inaccurate assertions about the world as dangerous and\nhoped to warn people against such behavior by writing his story. The real world\nexample indicates that Andersen actually overestimated the ability of humans to\nreject such non-scientific propositions even after someone has spoken up.\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nAndersen's story reads:\n\"But he has nothing on at all,\" said a little child at last. \"Good heavens! Listen\nto the voice of an innocent child,\" said the father, and one whispered to the other\nwhat the child had said. \"But he has nothing on at all,\" cried at last the whole\nThe same reaction occurred when ANHR challenged the view that had\n\"dominated\" discussions of rape (none of the EGR contributors bothered to quote\nexactly what ANHR says on this issue). For example, a rape survivor stated:\n\"Finally. Finally, somebody is coming around to my way of thinking on the\nmotivations of rape. . . . During my quest [to know why I was raped], I came\nacross a lot of people who liked to quote the so-called experts and say things such\nas, \"It's a crime of violence, not sex\" and \"It's a control thing.\" Boy, did I hate\nthose people. In my mind, they were wrong.\" (Eckstein 2000)\nReactions in EGR, however, are different. Travis seems to continue to assert\nthat the emperor is wearing beautiful robes by criticizing ANHR because\n\"Nothing [in ANHR] suggests that it might be useful to challenge the common\ncultural understanding of rape as sex\" (p. 21; see also Tobach and Reed, p. 115).\nThe sarcastic tone of Vickers and Kitcher when they write \"[a]dd on a\ndenunciation of that feminist canard that rape isn't a sexual act--what\nnonsense!--and we're done\" (p. 154) seems to indicate that they do as well (see\nalso p. 155). Travis clearly takes this position: \"The most fundamental error made\nby Thornhill and Palmer is to characterize rape as largely an act of desire. The\nproposition that sexual motivation is the common denominator of all rape was\ndebunked by feminists decades ago. Some of the relevant arguments and data\nwere elaborated in the 1975 foundation work of Susan Brownmiller (Against Our\nWill)\" (p. 211). This last reference to Brownmiller is interesting because several\nof the contributors claim that Brownmiller never put forth this position. For\nexample, Vickers and Kitcher point to the fact that Brownmiller acknowledged\nthat young women were the most likely to be raped. Ignoring the fact that\nBrownmiller also said that rapists select their victims \"with a striking disregard\nfor conventional `sex appeal'\" (Brownmiller, 1976, p. 338), Vickers and Kitcher\n\"reconstruct\" Brownmiller's view to suggest that what she really meant to say\nwas, \"The coercive expression of sexual desire is the result of a failure in an\ninhibitory mechanism that can be caused by hostility toward the victim\" (p. 161).\nNot only did Brownmiller not say this in 1975, she still isn't saying that rapists\nare motivated by sexual desire. She's only making the claim, that is as obvious as\nit is irrelevant to the debate over motivation, that, \"I never said that rape was not\ninvolved with sex. Obviously, it uses the sex organs\" (Brownmiller, quoted by\nThe attempt to deny that the claim \"rape is not about sex\" was never made, or\nthat it never meant that rapists were not motivated by sexual desire, suggests that\nAndersen's story would have been more realistic if it read\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\n\"Good heavens! listen to the voice of an innocent child,\" said the father, and\none whispered to the other what the child had said. \"But no one ever said he was\nwearing clothes,\" cried at last the whole people.\nthe phrase, \"it is not a crime of sex, but a crime of violence.\" While there never\nseemed to be any confusion about the meaning of this slogan before ANHR, now\nthat a high-profile challenge to it has been made, many of the contributors seem to\nbe asserting that it's all been a misunderstanding. For example, claiming that they\nnever said sex organs were not involved, or that when they said rapists were\nmotivated by power they meant sex because these things are really the same\n(Martin, p. 378), or the even more confusing statement by Koss that \"rape is not a\nsex act, it is a crime that can be impelled by sexual motives\" (p. 200). In addition\nto the existence of countless published repetitions of the claim without any\napparent misunderstanding of its meaning (see Palmer, 1988 and Palmer et al.,\n1999, for examples), there is a further fact that makes such revisionist history\nunlikely. If Brownmiller and others have been misquoted or misunderstood, why\ndidn't they bring this up before the political slogan was challenged? For example,\nwhy didn't Brownmiller object when Hill wrote \". . . Against Our Will: Men,\nWomen and Rape--rated by the New York public library as one of the 100 most\ninfluential books of the 20th century--first instigated the theory that rape had\nnothing to do with sex and everything to do with a desire to dominate and control\nwomen . . .\"? (Hill, 2000). More importantly, why don't they do something about\nthe rape-prevention instructions that are still being given to one of the most\nvulnerable populations of women. If the \"not sex\" explanation of rape was never\nmeant to be taken as a real explanation of the causes of rape, or if it had never\neven really been stated in the first place, how come \"The `rape myths'\" presented\nto students at the University of Wisconsin, Texas A & M, Tulane University, and\nMonash University in Australia, to pick a few, contain statements like the\nfollowing: \"Since sexual assault is all about power, not sex, the age or appearance\nof the victim is irrelevant,\" and \"Rape is not about sexual orientation or sexual\ndesire. It is an act of power and control in which the victim is brutalized and\nIV. Conclusion: Building for the future\nIt is unfortunate that EGR was dedicated to discrediting ANHR at any price.\nThe ubiquitous misrepresentations produced by this approach not only makes\nEGR of little value as an evaluation of ANHR, it greatly reduces EGR's own\ncontribution to the understanding of rape. In terms of ultimate causation, EGR's\npreoccupation with condemning anyone who even suggests the possibility of\nrape-specific adaptations in men distracts it from testing any of ANHR's\npredictions that might actually settle the issue. In terms of proximate causation,\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nit's overall contribution is so confused and contradictory that it doesn't increase\nunderstanding much beyond Drea and Wallen's statement, \"Therefore, the\nsimplest proximate explanation for why males might force copulation on females\nis because they can\" (p. 38; emphasis in original). EGR does, however, contain\nreasons for optimism about future attempts to increase knowledge about the\ncauses of rape. First, the chaotic positions found in EGR on the role of sexual\ndesire in the motivations of rapists indicate that ANHR has largely succeeded in\nbringing an end to the reign of the assertion that \"rape is not a sexually motivated\nact.\" If so, this will remove perhaps the largest obstacle to increasing knowledge\nabout the actual causes of rape. The many points of agreement between the\ncontributors to EGR and the positions taken in ANHR discussed at the start of this\nreview also are reasons for optimism, especially the fact that many of the\nquestions about rape are now being approached from the perspective of the\nevolutionary paradigm. As long as these ideas are discussed within the context of\nevolution, the more grievous misunderstandings of evolutionary theory found in\nEGR will be quickly corrected. This raises the probability of real progress being\nmade on the causes of rape, and the use of the knowledge in the prevention of\nrape. Of course, this will only be possible if rape researchers refuse to engage in\nthe type of blatant misrepresentation found in EGR.\nAs scientists, we find fascinating how much many people dislike the fact that\nrape is evolutionary and the extreme difficulty many people have in maintaining\nreasonable thinking or talking about rape in biological terms. By raising the topic\nof the biology of rape in a conversation with another, one can determine if the\nperson has consistent scientific objectivity or not. It can be used as an acid test of\nwhether a person has interest in knowing or may be blinded by ideological\nconvictions.\nWe hypothesize that people have a psychological adaptation whose function is\nto disable the mind's reasoning and thereby prevent personal acceptance of ideas\nthat are perceived contrary to the ideology of the perceiver's community. This\nhypothetical adaptation is the \"knowledge destroyer.\" Its functional design is to\nprevent acceptance of an idea that is not consistent with one's ideology by\ngarbling the logic and evidence that the idea entails. Thus, humans may be\ndesigned as a result of evolution by selection to think illogically and unreasonably\nabout politically loaded topics such as rape in biological perspective. The\nexistence of the knowledge destroyer would be supported by evidence that people\nwith various ideologies that most oppose evolutionary ideas being applied to\npeople's behavior would show significantly greater lapses of reason when\nevaluating a sequence of logic in an evolutionary vignette involving human\nbehavior than when evaluating logic in other types of vignettes. It may be that the\nknowledge destroyer also is behind the great difficulty many people have\nunderstanding the fact that culture and biology are not a dichotomy and that in\nreality culture is biology. Culture is the behavior of people in a place and time and\nA posse of good citizens brings outlaw evolutionists to justice\nbiology is the scientific study of all life, including all behavior.\nReferences\nAlcock, J.
