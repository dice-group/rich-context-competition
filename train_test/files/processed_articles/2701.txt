Adolescents reporting past-year alcohol use and aggres-\nsion were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (SafERteens).\nIntervention All patients underwent a computerized baseline assessment and were\nrandomized to a control group that received a brochure (n = 235) or a 35-minute brief\nintervention delivered by either a computer (n = 237) or therapist (n = 254) in the ED,\nwith follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months. Combining motivational interviewing\nwith skills training, the brief intervention for violence and alcohol included review of\ngoals, tailored feedback, decisional balance exercise, role plays, and referrals.\nMain Outcome Measures Self-report measures included peer aggression and vio-\nlence, violence consequences, alcohol use, binge drinking, and alcohol consequences.\nResults About 25% (n = 829) of screened patients had positive results for both alco-\nhol and violence; 726 were randomized.

Study proce-\ndures were approved by the Univer-\nsity of Michigan and Hurley Medical\nCenter institutional review boards; a\nNational Institutes of Health Certifi-\ncate of Confidentiality for human sub-\njects was obtained.\nEmergency department patients\nfor medical illness or injury were eli-\ngible for screening. Exclusions were\nacute sexual assault or suicidal ide-\nation, altered mental status preclud-\ning consent, or medical instability\n(ie, abnormal vital signs).\nRecruitment occurred between 12 PM\nand 11 PM 7 days a week (September\njor holidays. Adolescent patients iden-\ntified from electronic logs were ap-\nproached by research assistants in\nwaiting rooms or treatment spaces. Fol-\nlowing obtainment of written consent\n(and assent and parent/guardian con-\nsent if 18 years), participants self-\nadministered a 15-minute computer-\nized survey with audio and received a\nAfter completing the survey, partici-\npants reporting both past-year aggres-\nsion (peer, dating, weapon carriage/\nuse) and alcohol consumption (\"In the\npast 12 months, have you had a drink\nof beer, wine or liquor more than two\nto three times? Do not count just a sip\nor taste of someone else's drink.\")15\nwere eligible for the RCT. Participants\nreporting only 1 behavior (aggression\nor alcohol use) were not eligible.\nFollowing obtainment of written\nconsent (and assent and parent/\nguardian consent if 18 years) for the\nRCT, participants self-administered a\ncomputerized baseline assessment ($20\nremuneration). As required by the in-\nstitutional review board, participants\nwere told they would be randomly as-\nsigned to 1 of 3 groups: computer ses-\nsion, counselor session, or brochure.\nParticipants were blinded to condi-\ntion assignment until after the base-\nline assessment. After the baseline, par-\nticipants were randomized and received\nthe therapist brief intervention, com-\nputer brief intervention, or control bro-\nchure during the ED visit. Randomiza-\ntion was stratified by sex and age (14-15\ncomputer-generated algorithm and\nusing numbered sealed envelopes.

Piloting revealed\nthat question 1 response options were\nmisunderstood by urban teens and were\nreplaced with the response options for\nquestion 3.

Research staff ensured\nthat sessions were completed pri-\nvately. Participants in all groups,\nincluding the control condition,\nreceived a brochure with community\nresources. The SafERteens brief inter-\nventions were based on principles of\ninvolved normative resetting and alco-\nhol refusal and conflict resolution\nskills practice.31 The therapist and\ncomputer interventions were designed\nto have similar sections but with dif-\nferent modes of presentation. They\nwere developed to be culturally rel-\nevant for urban youth, of whom at this\nstudy site approximately 50% were\nAfrican American. The sections\nincluded goals, personalized feedback\nfor alcohol, violence, and weapon car-\nriage, decisional balance exercise for\nthe potential benefit of staying away\nfrom drinking and fighting, 5 tailored\nrole plays (eg, anger management,\nconflict resolution, alcohol refusals,\nnot drinking and driving), and refer-\nral. Although both interventions\nreviewed these content areas in a way\nthat was consistent with tenets of\nmotivational interviewing (ie, non-\njudgmental), the mode of delivery\nresulted in important differences. For\nexample, it was not possible for the\ncomputer to provide complex inter-\npersonal responses that a skilled thera-\npist could deliver.\nThe therapist intervention was also\nfacilitated by a tablet laptop computer\nthat displayed tailored feedback for par-\nticipants and screens to prompt con-\ntent for the therapists. Research social\nworkers were initially trained on mo-\ntivational interviewing techniques and\nthe specific SafERteens intervention.\nBased on harm reduction principles,\nwhich are well suited for adoles-\ncents,32,33 motivational interviewing em-\nphasizes developing a discrepancy be-\ntween current behavior and future goals\nand increasing problem recognition,\nmotivation, and self-efficacy. To en-\nsure fidelity, sessions were audio-\ntaped and 20% were coded based on ad-\nherence and competence; therapists\nreceived individual and group super-\nvision and periodic retrainings through-\nout the study.\nThe computer intervention devel-\noped for this study was a stand-alone\ninteractive animated program31 with\ntouch screens and audio via head-\nphones to ensure privacy. An ani-\nmated character guided participants\nthrough the intervention components\nvia audio feedback for the choices made,\nfocusing on tipping the decisional bal-\nance away from risk behaviors. The en-\ntire computer program was an interac-\ntion, not passively viewed. For example,\nduring the role-play scenarios, partici-\npants had to interact with peers and\nmake behavioral choices about drink-\ning and fighting.\nStatistical Analysis\nData were analyzed using SAS version\n9 (SAS Institute Inc; Cary, North\nCarolina). Descriptive statistics were\ncomputed for the total sample and by\nTable 1.

Because of base-\nline differences by condition in rates\nof participant school dropout, this\nvariable was initially included in\nanalyses to control for group differ-\nences. Models are presented without\nthis covariate, however, because it\nwas unrelated to outcomes when it\nwas included in initial analyses. For\ndescriptive purposes, rates of occur-\nrence of risk behaviors are presented\nas percentages along with percentage\nchange at 3 and 6 months. At base-\nline, a single imputation procedure\nwas used to complete missing alcohol\nmisuse scores for 5 participants. The\n1-tailed statistical significance was set\nconfidence interval.\nData were analyzed using general-\nized estimating equations (GEE) due\nto the correlated structure of data\nfrom repeated measures at baseline\nGEE analyses allow for observed vari-\nable distributions (eg, binary/logit,\ncontinuous/negative binomial). An\nintention-to-treat approach was used\nin which all randomized participants\n(n=726) were included because GEE\nanalyses include all cases, even drop-\nouts, by using available pairs to esti-\nmate working correlation parameters\nfor the entire sample. The study was\npowered to detect differences between\nintervention groups and the control,\nnot between treatment conditions (eg,\ntherapist brief intervention and com-\nputer brief intervention); thus, analy-\nses compared each intervention con-\ndition separately with the control\ncondition. Based on 15% reduction in\noccurrence of a risk behavior and\nwas needed for 80% power; thus, the\nanalyses were adequately powered.\nBecause the intervention focused on\ndecreasing the occurrence as well as the\nfrequency of the risk behaviors, GEE\nanalyses were conducted examining\ngroup differences over time in the oc-\ncurrence (binary variables) and fre-\nquency (continuous variables) of pri-\nmary outcomes (ie, peer aggression,\nviolence consequences, alcohol mis-\nuse [AUDIT-C score], binge drinking,\nand alcohol consequences) and sec-\nondary outcomes (ie, experiencing peer\nviolence). The GEE analyses pro-\nduces a model group  time interac-\ntion effect, as well as specific group \ntime interaction effects for the thera-\npist and computer conditions com-\npared with the control. For conserva-\ntive purposes, only models with\nsignificant overall group  time inter-\naction effects were examined further to\ndetermine intervention effectiveness (ie,\ntherapist group  time interaction,\ncomputer group  time interaction).\nA significant therapist group  time in-\nteraction effect indicates that the inter-\nvention condition significantly differs\nfrom the control in a specific out-\ncome; thus, this analysis approach con-\nsiders baseline values and the relative\nchange over time in outcomes based on\ngroupassignment.Becauseviolencewas\na common occurrence, relative risks are\nreported for violence-related vari-\nables; for alcohol-related variables, odds\nratios are reported because these are\nless common events and this allows for\ncomparison with the published\nliterature.\nRegarding effect sizes, for out-\ncomes using binary variables percent-\nage change was computed. For con-\ntinuous variables, Cohen effect sizes35\nwere calculated, which indicate the\nstrength of the relationship between the\nintervention and the observed out-\ncome and allow for comparisons across\nstudies; the prevention literature sug-\ngests that effect sizes of 0.10 or higher\nare clinically meaningful.36\nRESULTS\npatients presenting during recruit-\nTable 2.

Given\nthat a leading cause of mortality and\nmorbidity in this age group is vio-\nlence, the reduction in the occurrence\nof severe violence following a single-\nsession brief intervention is clinically\nmeaningful. Specifically, only 8 at-\nrisk adolescents (with past-year alco-\nhol use and aggression) would need to\nreceive the therapist intervention to pre-\nvent severe peer aggression in 1 ado-\nlescent. In addition, participants in the\ntherapist intervention reported a re-\nduction in the occurrence of experi-\nencing peer violence and violence con-\nsequences at 3 months. Clinically, a\ntrained ED-based therapist would need\nto deliver this 30-minute intervention\nto 10 at-risk adolescents to prevent 1\nadolescent from being victimized by a\npeer. In a similar manner, the number\nof adolescents needed to treat with the\ntherapist intervention is 6 to reduce vio-\nlence consequences in 1 adolescent.\nThis study focused on at-risk youth\nseeking general ED care for a single-\nsession intervention delivered com-\npletely during the teachable moment of\nthe acute care visit. Prior hospital and\nED interventions for youth violence\nhave focused on patients with inten-\ntional injury and have typically used\nmultisession case management or men-\ntoring approaches.6,9,37 Additional stud-\nies with larger samples of adolescents\nwho are seeking care following an in-\ntentional injury (eg, assault, gunshot)\nare needed to determine the effective-\nness of this intervention among youth\nwith more severe violence profiles. Few\nED studies have examined alcohol brief\ninterventions among adolescents. Ado-\nlescents in the therapist intervention\nand the computer intervention were less\nlikely to report alcohol-related conse-\nquences (eg, missed school, trouble\nwith friends) than those in the control\ncondition over the 6-month follow-\nup. Clinically, to prevent alcohol\nconsequences in 1 adolescent, 17 ado-\nlescents would need to receive the\nTable 4.

It is important to\nrecognize, however, that a computer\nplayed a role in the therapist condi-\ntion. Assessments were computerized\nand the adolescents and therapists re-\nviewed tailored feedback presented on\nthe computer. The computer screens\nstandardized the delivery of the inter-\nvention by the therapist; such ap-\nproaches are appealing as a mecha-\nnism to prompt content for busy ED\nstaff.\nA limitation of this study is that it is\nnot possible for participants to be\nblinded to the intervention condition\ngiven current institutional review board\nrequirements. This concern is some-\nwhat mitigated by blinding of fol-\nlow-up staff to intervention condition\nassignment as well as by the self-\nadministered nature of assessments.\nFindings may not generalize to pa-\ntient groups not included in this single-\nsite study, such as adolescents present-\ning during overnight shifts or with acute\nsuicidal ideation/attempt or sexual as-\nsault. Although the sample reflected the\nED study site composition, replica-\ntion with other sites and samples (eg,\nHispanics) are needed. The self-report\ndata are a potential limitation; how-\never, recent reviews support the reli-\nability and validity of self-report of risk\nbehaviors when privacy/confidential-\nity is ensured and when using self-\nadministered computerized assess-\nments.39 Although the follow-up rates\nexceeded 85% and analyses included all\nparticipants regardless of dropout, at-\ntrition is a limitation of this study. Find-\nings are limited by the 6-month follow-\nup. Future studies are needed that\nexamine long-term follow-up, modera-\ntors of outcome such as age, and the\ntemporal relationship between acute al-\ncohol consumption and violence using\ncalendar-based assessments.40\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough replication is required, find-\nings support the efficacy of a therapist\nbrief intervention (with computerized\nfeedback and structure) in decreasing\nthe occurrence of experiencing peer vio-\nlence in the 3 months following an ED\nvisit. In addition, both the therapist and\nthe computer brief interventions were\neffective at reducing alcohol conse-\nquences over 6 months. Computer-\nized approaches could assist in trans-\nlating research findings into routine\nclinical practice by standardizing in-\ntervention delivery and have wide ap-\nplicability across other content areas\nand settings.\nAuthor Contributions: Drs Walton and Cunningham\nhad full access to all the data in the study and take\nresponsibility for the integrity of the data and the ac-\ncuracy of the data analysis.\nStudy concept and design: Walton, Chermack, Shope,\nBingham, Zimmerman, Blow, Cunningham.\nAcquisition of data: Walton, Chermack, Blow,\nCunningham.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Walton, Chermack,\nZimmerman, Cunningham.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Walton, Chermack,\nBingham, Zimmerman, Cunningham.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Walton, Chermack, Shope,\nZimmerman, Blow, Cunningham.\nStatistical analysis: Walton, Chermack, Cunningham.\nObtained funding: Walton, Chermack, Shope,\nBingham, Zimmerman, Blow, Cunningham.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support:, Shope,\nBlow.\nStudy supervision: Walton, Chermack, Cunningham.\nFinancial Disclosures: None reported.\nFunding/Support: This project was supported by Na-\ntional Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\nRole of the Sponsor: The NIAAA had no role in the\ndesign and conduct of the study; collection, man-\nagement, analysis, and interpretation of the data;\nor preparation, review, or approval of the manu-\nscript.\nAdditional Contributions: We thank project staff for\ntheir work, as well as Pat Bergeron (not paid by the\nproject) for administrative assistance and Linping Duan,\nMS, for statistical support (paid analyst for the project),\nboth from the University of Michigan.
