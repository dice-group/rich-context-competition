Personal experiences, as well as evidence from the humanities and the\nvarious social sciences, clearly support this assertion. Our purpose is to contribute to this\nknowledge base by estimating the causal structure and importance of a subset of these\nrelationships--those among negative affect, mate value, and mating effort--using a\nStructural Equations Model approach. To move us toward this goal, we must first\nfamiliarize the reader with a few terms.\nMating Strategy refers to a coordinated set of behaviors that evolved to solve the\nadaptive problems of selecting, attracting, and retaining sexual partners (e.g., Buss and\nsocial exchange and evolutionary economic theory (Converse and Foa, 1993; Huston and\nwith individuals who possess similar overall value as mates (Kirsner, Figueredo, and\nJacobs, 2003; Miller, 2000), leading some to suggest that relationship partners exchange\nvalued resources, and that the overall perceived value of these resources must be relatively\nsimilar for each party to remain in the relationship (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992). The mate\nvalue of potential (attainable) partners must be approximately equal to one's own mate\nvalue (e.g., Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad and Simpson, 2000; Kenrick, Sadalla,\nGroth, and Trost, 1990). A potential partner with too little mate value is an unacceptable\nlong-term partner choice, whereas one with too much mate value might not be attainable or\nretainable as a long-term mate. The image of the \"ideal\" and \"attainable\" partner should\ntherefore correspond closely (Kirsner et al., 2003).\nMating Effort is the total time, energy, attention, and other resources expended in\nattracting or retaining a mate (Rowe, Vazsonyi, and Figueredo, 1997). The value of\ninvestments of time and attention received from any given partner depends partially on the\npartner's mate value. One can (to some extent) increase one's value as a mate by increasing\none's efforts to provide the mate with valued resources. To preserve an unequal\nrelationship, one may compensate for an imbalance in mate value, whether real or\nperceived, by increasing (or decreasing) mating effort.\nSelf-perceived Mate Value is an estimate of one's bargaining power in the mating\nmarketplace. Unbiased self-perceived mate value must closely reflect the value\nconspecifics place on particular attributes for social exchange to proceed equitably.\nNegative Affect is associated with lower estimates of one's own value as a mate (Kirsner et\nal., 2003), perhaps resulting from systematic biases in the estimation of personal mate\nvalue. In keeping with evolutionary economic theory, lower estimates of one's own mate\nvalue predict lower self-reported expectations for the mate value of potential partners\nWe expect negative affect to have differential effects on mate attraction and mate\nretention. Though negative affect may decrease mate attraction efforts by encouraging\navoidance of social situations (Johnson, Aikman, Danner, and Elling, 1995; Lesure-Lester,\n2001), negative affect should increase efforts to retain existing mates for several reasons.\nNegative affect may: (1) increase desire to have a mate, to the extent that one believes a\nmate will lessen one's negative affect (McNeill, Rienzi, Butler, and Doty, 1996), (2)\ndecrease confidence in one's ability to attract new or alternative mates (Smith and Betz,\nNegative Affect, Mate Value, Mating Effort\ngiving up a current mate in hopes that a new mate might be an improvement. Finally,\ndepression is associated with lower self-perceived mate value (Kirsner et al., 2003); if\nnegative affect decreases self-perceived mate value relative to its level at the onset of the\nrelationship, it would require one to invest more to equalize the product of mate value and\nmating effort between existing partners (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992).\nprovides an alternative interpretation of the relationships among Negative Affect, Mate\nValue, and Mating Effort. LH Theory is an evolutionary theory that describes the strategic\nallocation of an organism's resources among the competing demands of continued survival\nversus reproduction. Applied to humans, a \"slow\" life history strategy entails slower\ndevelopment and delayed reproduction, indicators of the latent variable called the LH\nFactor, all of which reflect a devotion of resources to parental effort and high offspring\nsurvival. Conversely, a \"fast\" life history strategy entails faster development and earlier\nreproduction, reflecting a devotion of resources to immediate and frequent reproduction\n(i.e., mating effort).\nConvergent lines of evidence suggest a positive association among a fast LH\nstrategy, Negative Affect (Figueredo, V\u00e1squez, Brumbach, and Schneider, 2004; 2007b;\nSefcek, 2007), and Mating Effort (Figueredo et al., 2005). Further, a fast LH strategy\npredicts both low personal and partner mate value (Figueredo, 2007; Figueredo, Sefcek,\npredicts that mate value is an outward manifestation of enhanced phenotypic quality,\nperhaps suggesting a higher genetic quality (when considering heritable phenotypic traits).\nStrategic Sexual Pluralism Theory (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000) also predicts a positive\nassociation between sexually-selected \"good genes\" and perceived mate value. LH Theory\npredicts that fast LH individuals have received a lower quantity of parental and nepotistic\neffort from genetic kin during development, and furthermore invest a lower quantity of\nsomatic effort in their own growth and maintenance throughout their lifespan (Ellis,\nFigueredo, Brumbach, and Schlomer, 2009). This leads us to predict that faster LH\nindividuals will manifest a lower degree of phenotypic quality, as indicated by poorer\nphysical and mental health, than slower LH individuals, regardless of their underlying\ngenetic quality. Thus, faster LH individuals will manifest a decreased mate value (as\nperceived by either self or others) as a result of this basic physiological condition. Indeed, a\nslower LH strategy has been positively correlated to better physical and mental functioning,\nas indicated by the well-validated RAND SF-36 Short Form (Wenner, 2009). Strategic\nSexual Pluralism Theory (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000) is a subset of LH theory and\nwould also predict a positive association between \"good genes\" and mate value. These\nfindings may also account for the association of a faster LH strategy with negative affect\nand depressive symptoms. These data suggest that a single latent common factor,\nrepresenting a coordinated life history strategy, the LH Factor, underlies the relations\namong Negative Affect, Mate Value, and Mating Effort.\nWe use our previous work (Kirsner et al., 2003), evolutionary economic theory, and\nLH Theory to guide our design, data collection, analyses, and interpretation of those\nanalyses in the present manuscript. We compared six structural models, starting with one\nbased closely on the structural model described by Kirsner et al. Both the primary\ntheoretical model (Model 1.0), based on evolutionary economic theory, and the\nNegative Affect, Mate Value, Mating Effort\nreinterpreted theoretical model (Model 2.0), which also incorporates LH theory, share the\nfollowing hypotheses:\n1. Personal Mate Value positively influences both Long-Term Partner (LTM) Mate\nValue and Short-Term Partner (STP) Mate Value, as a product of matching on\noverall mate value;\n2. Both LTP Mate Value and STP Mate Value positively influence Mating Effort,\nbecause the better the partner, the more one would presumably do to attract or retain\nhim or her;\n3. Sex correlates positively with negative affect, reflecting the well-documented higher\nrates of depression and anxiety among women (Kessler et al., 2005).\n4. Sex predicts higher levels of both LTP and STP Mate Value because women are\nmore selective than men when choosing short-term partners (Kenrick, Sadalla,\nGroth, and Trost, 1990). Counterintuitively, theory predicts that women and men\nwill be equally selective when choosing long-term partners. Therefore, we specified\na model predicting that women will be more selective, following the intuitive\nmodel.\nIn addition, the primary theoretical model (Model 1.0) proposes that both direct and\nindirect causal relationships exist between Negative Affect and Mating Effort, generating\nthe following predictions (see Figure 1):\n1. Negative Affect negatively influences Personal Mate Value, as documented in\nKirsner et al. (2003), reflecting biased self-estimation;\n2. Negative Affect positively influences Mating Effort, because it may: (a) increase\ndesire to have a mate because, as stated above, obtaining a mate might decrease\nnegative affect (McNeill, Rienzi, Butler, and Doty, 1996), (b) decrease confidence\nin one's ability to attract mates (Smith and Betz, 2000), (c) and decrease risk-taking\n(Yuen and Lee, 2003). We expect the effort to retain an extant relationship to\noutweigh the effect of Negative Affect on reduced efforts to attract a mate.\nIn contrast to Model 1.0, the reinterpreted theoretical model (Model 2.0) proposes that\nnegative affect, mating effort, and personal mate value are correlated because they are\nconvergent indicators of LH, generating the following prediction (see Figure 3):\n1. The LH Factor negatively influences Negative Affect and Mating Effort and\npositively influences Personal Mate Value, all of which are indicators of LH, as\ndiscussed above.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nintroductory-level Psychology courses at the University of Arizona. All participants were at\nleast 18 years old at the time of participation (mean age = 19.3).\nMeasures\nDepression. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) provided a self-reported\nestimate of the severity of depressive symptoms in the past two weeks (Beck, Steer, and\nBrown, 1996). The inventory exhibits sound psychometric properties (Dozois, Dobson, and\nNegative Affect, Mate Value, Mating Effort\nAnxiety. The Trait form of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory provided a self-\nreported estimate of the severity of chronic symptoms of anxiety. This inventory also\nshows sound psychometric properties (Spielberger, Gorsuch and Lushene, 1970).\nThe Mate Retention Scale (MRS; see Appendix D) provided subjective estimates of\nthe frequency with which the participant engaged in behavioral tactics designed to keep a\npartner from leaving an extant relationship. We derived the items in the MRS in part from\nBuss' (1988) taxonomy of mate retention tactics. We added items designed to measure\novertly manipulative tactics, such as threats to harm self or partner if the partner leaves. We\nobtained separate reports for the past year and prior to the past year; the figures reported for\nthese two time frames were averaged after determining that they were highly correlated.\nFigure 1.

This includes, for example, having sex to attract or retain a\nmate, having sex while intoxicated, having sex out of a sense of obligation, or having sex in\nan attempt to regulate mood. The participants indicated what activities constitute \"having\nsex\" elsewhere in the survey (see Appendix A).\nThe Cumulative Sexual Frequency scale (see Appendix B) provided subjective\nestimates of how many times a participant \"had sex\" with male and with female partners in\nNegative Affect, Mate Value, Mating Effort\nhis or her lifetime. Because of the restricted age range of participants, the models did not\ncontrol for current age of the participants.\nThe Mate Value Inventory (MVI; Kirsner et al., 2003) provided subjective estimates\nof personal and partner mate value from five perspectives. Personal Mate Value measured\nself-perceived mate value. Attainable Short-Term Partner Mate Value measured the mate\nvalue of the best partner participants thought they could realistically attract to a brief\nrelationship. Ideal Short-Term Partner Mate Value measured the mate value of one's ideal\npartner for a brief fling. Short-Term Partner Mate Value was the average of these two\nmeasures. Attainable Long-Term Partner Mate Value measured the mate value of the best\npartner participants thought they could realistically attract for long-term relationship. Ideal\nLong-Term Partner Mate Value measured the mate value of one's ideal partner for a long-\nterm relationship. Long-Term Partner Mate Value was the average of these two measures.\nOn all five forms of the MVI, participants indicated how the relevant person\ncompared to the participant's peers, using a scale from -3 (extremely low on this\ncharacteristic) through 0 (don't care/average on this characteristic) to +3 (extremely high\non this characteristic).\nProcedures\nWhile completing a set of questionnaires during class, students were asked to\nindicate whether they would be interested in participating in a study that involved questions\nabout romantic relationships and sexual behavior. They also completed screening\ninstruments to permit over-sampling of respondents with high scores on the BDI-II.\nInterested students were contacted by phone to arrange appointments to participate.\nDuring their appointments participants were seated in a room alone. After each\nparticipant completed informed consent procedures, he or she completed a packet of\nquestionnaires and returned them to a box to maintain anonymity.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe constructed our scales, measurement, and structural models using the\nprocedures detailed in Kirsner et al. (2003).\nBalancing explanatory power with model parsimony, we used hierarchically nested\nmodel comparisons (Widaman, 1985) to determine which of the alternative models\nproduced the best fit to the data as measured by practical fit indices and Chi-squared.\nPractical fit indices, such as the Normed Fit Index (NFI) and the Comparative Fit\nIndex (CFI) estimate how successfully a proposed model describes observed relations\namong measured variables. Practical indices of fit compare the proposed model to a\ncomplete \"independence\" model, a model that does not reproduce any of the observed\ncorrelations. In other words, practical fit indices tell you how much better than nothing\nyour model performs.\nIn contrast, Chi-squared takes the opposite approach; it tells you how much less\nthan perfect your model is. Chi-squared estimates the extent to which a structural equations\nmodel replicates the observed relations among variables (i.e., covariances in the data\ncollected) by statistically comparing a proposed model to a completely \"saturated\" model, a\nmodel that reproduces the observed correlations perfectly.\nWhen significant, Chi-squared indicates that the proposed model did not reproduce\nthe observed correlations among the variables within an acceptable margin of sampling\nNegative Affect, Mate Value, Mating Effort\nerror. When non-significant, Chi-squared indicates that a model perfectly reproduced the\nobserved relations among the variables. An acceptable margin for sampling error is\nconventionally defined as a 95% confidence interval around a discrepancy of zero between\nthe observed correlations and those predicted by the proposed model.\nIn addition to describing the acceptability of a model on its own, Chi-squared can\ncompare related models, using a technique known as Nested Model Comparisons (NMC).\nIn this context, one compares models in terms of the most parsimonious yet complete\nexplanation of the observed data. Using NMC, one can compare the fit of any two models\nwith hierarchically nested relations. Two models are hierarchically nested if they have\nidentical specifications except for one or more parameters that have been omitted in the\nrestricted model. In short, one can compare the fit of models with and without the pathways\nwhose necessity is being examined (James, Mulaik, and Brett, 1982).\nWhen conducting a NMC, we make tradeoffs. Our scientific goal is threefold: a) to\npropose parsimonious models that b) permit us to predict patterns of behavior and, under\nthe right circumstances, c) control or influence those patterns of behavior.\nIf we proposed a \"saturated\" model, with paths between every possible pair of\nvariables, the model explains 100% of the observed relations among the measured\nvariables. Such a model is of no practical use because, in effect, it says that everything\ndirectly affects everything else--it merely restates the data contained in the covariance\nmatrix. Because perfect prediction of behavior is infinitely costly, we initially attempt to\nget the most value out of the smallest possible number of structural pathways. As\nresearchers, we are generally interested in including only those variables and pathways\namong them that surpass a threshold level of explanatory power. If we can eliminate a\nparticular pathway without losing significant explanatory power, we do so.\nIt is important to keep in mind, however, that the observed covariance among\nmeasured variables includes error specific to the particular sample of the population. This\nleads to a second tradeoff. Parsimony may suggest that a particular pathway does not\nprovide enough additional explanatory power to warrant inclusion in a model, whereas a\npriori theory may lead one to conclude that the pathway only appears to be unnecessary\ndue to sampling error. In this case, it is necessary to devise true experiments to settle the\nquestion.\nTo compare two models, one of which has fewer error degrees of freedom (i.e.,\nmore model degrees of freedom representing pathways) and a lower Chi-squared than the\nother, NMC involves three steps. First, subtract the smaller number of degrees of freedom\nfrom the larger number; second, subtract the smaller Chi-squared from the larger Chi-\nsquared. Third, locate the resulting Difference Chi-Squared (DCS) figure in a Chi-squared\ntable and determined its significance level. If the DCS is significant, the dropped\npathway(s) produced a significant loss of explanatory power. In other words, it is better to\nleave those pathways intact. If the resulting DCS is not significant, the dropped pathway(s)\nproduce no significant loss of explanatory power. Hence, the more parsimonious is\npreferable to the less parsimonious model.\nThe Measurement Model. We are interested in examining causal relations among\nNegative Affect, Mating Effort, and Mate Value. To that end, we measured Negative Affect\nusing standardized measures of depression and anxiety. We measured Mating Effort using\nthree custom-designed measures: the Mate Retention Scale, Sexual Situations, and\nCumulative Sexual Frequency. We measured mate value using five forms of the Mate\nNegative Affect, Mate Value, Mating Effort\nValue Inventory, Personal Mate Value, and both Realistic and Idealized versions of both\nLong-Term and of Short-Term Partner Mate Value. In so doing, we created the following\nmeasurement model: (1) Depression and Anxiety are indicators of the latent construct,\nNegative Affect; and (2) The Mate Retention Scale, Sexual Situations, and Cumulative\nSexual Frequency are indicators of the latent construct, Mating Effort.\nThe Structural Models. We used a Structural Equations Model approach to examine\nthe relative explanatory power of two conceptually distinct sets of models. The first set\nconsisted of the initial structural model described above, which we numbered Model 1.0,\nand two variants of it. The second set of models consisted of the reinterpreted model\ndescribed above, which we numbered Model 2.0, and two variants based on that\nreinterpretation.\nThe first restricted model, Model 1.1, eliminated two of the causal pathways\nproposed in Model 1.0: the pathways from Short-Term and Long-Term Partner Mate Value\nto Mating Effort. Model 1.1, therefore, proposed a single direct causal pathway from\nNegative Affect to Mating Effort.\nThe second restricted model, Model 1.2, eliminated the causal pathway from\nNegative Affect to Mating Effort, but retained the causal pathways from Short-Term and\nLong-Term Partner Mate Value to Mating Effort. Model 1.2, therefore, proposed two\nindirect causal pathways from Negative Affect to Mating Effort.\nThe reinterpreted model, Model 2.0, replaced the causal pathway from Negative\nAffect to Mating Effort with the LH Factor, a latent common factor representing LH\nstrategy. Model 2.0 also dropped the direct pathway from Negative Affect to Personal Mate\nValue and, to explain the correlation between them, substituted a functionally equivalent\npathway from the LH Factor to Personal Mate Value. Model 2.0, unlike Models 1.0\nthrough 1.2, specifies that the correlations between Negative Affect and Mating Effort, as\nwell as the correlations between Negative Affect and Personal Mate Value, are spuriously\nproduced by the latent LH Factor. Model 2.0 retained the causal pathways from both Short-\nTerm and Long-Term Partner Mate Value to Mating Effort.\nAs in Model 2.0, the first restricted variant, Model 2.1, retained the direct causal\npathways from the LH Factor to Negative Affect, Mating Effort, and Personal Mate Value\nand removed the direct pathways from Negative Affect to both Mating Effort and Personal\nMate Value. Model 2.1 also retained the causal pathway from Long-Term Partner Mate\nValue to Mating Effort, but dropped the causal pathway from Short-Term Partner Mate\nValue to Mating Effort.\nThe second restricted variant of Model 2.0, Model 2.2, is identical to Model 2.1\nexcept for having eliminated the causal pathway from Long-Term Partner Mate Value to\nMating Effort.

Model\n2.2 gained one degree of freedom by eliminating the indirect pathway from the LH Factor\nto Mating Effort mediated by Personal Mate Value and Long-Term Partner Mate Value.\nDropping the direct path from Long-Term Partner Mate Value to Mating Effort eliminated\nthis indirect pathway. The difference Chi-squared was statistically significant, X 2 (1) =\n7.790, p =.0053, indicating a significant loss of explanatory power when this indirect\npathway was dropped. Hence, we prefer Model 2.1 because it provides a better fit to the\ndata than Model 2.2.\nComparing the Preferred Models. Comparing the explanatory power and fit indices\nof the most powerful and parsimonious model based on evolutionary economic theory,\nModel 1.1, to the most powerful and parsimonious model based on Life History Theory,\nModel 2.1, permits us to compare these theoretically distinct models indirectly.2 When we\ndo so, we find that the models fit just about equally well by all statistical and practical\ncriteria. The squared multiple correlation for the Mating Effort construct, which was the\n2 Because the preferred primary model, Model 1.1, and the preferred reinterpreted model,\nModel 2.1, are not nested, we could not pit them against one another directly.\nNegative Affect, Mate Value, Mating Effort\nprimary endogenous variable of theoretical interest, was .046 for Model 1.1 and .103 for\nModel 2.1. This comparison favors Model 2.1 somewhat by the more conventional\ncriterion of explanatory power.\nDiscussion\nWe used a structural equations model approach to examine the empirical\nplausibility of hypothesized causal relations among Negative Affect, Mate Value, and\nMating Effort. Using these methods, we arrived at two equally parsimonious models,\nModel 1.1 and Model 2.1. Model 2.1 was favored by a higher squared multiple correlation\nfor the Mating Effort construct, although it was not favored by any of the statistical and\npractical criteria of model fit unique to structural equations modeling.\nBoth models measured three indicators of Mating Effort. Each indicator assessed a\nslightly different aspect of behaviors in which people might engage for the purpose of\nattracting a partner or keeping a partner from exiting an extant relationship. The majority of\nthe items contained in Sexual Situations (Appendix C) and the Mate Retention Scale\n(Appendix D) might be labeled \"Risky Mating Effort.\" Cumulative Sexual Frequency and\nSexual Situations assessed the use of many potentially high-risk sexual tactics as\ninstruments to attract or retain a partner. The Mate Retention Scale assessed many high-risk\nbut non-sexual tactics as instruments to retain a partner. Of these self-reported sets of\ntactics, both Model 1.1 and Model 2.1 identified Sexual Situations, how often one engages\nin sexual behavior under 36 sampled social situations, as the strongest indicator of Mating\nEffort. The very high loading of Mating Effort on Sexual Situations suggests that the\nmeasure captures an essential aspect of efforts to attract and retain mates. This finding does\nnot diminish the importance of Cumulative Sexual Frequency or non-sexual mate retention\ntactics, both of which show remarkably strong relationships to Mating Effort in Model 1.1\nand Model 2.1. By both models, it appears that people willingly admit the instrumental use\nof a wide variety of risky sexual and non-sexual tactics to attract or retain a partner.\nThe detrimental impact of using sexual, psychological, or physically violent\nbehaviors to manipulate one's partner is obvious. Less obvious are the dangers to the\npartner who uses those tactics, perhaps because of fears that his or her mate will defect. The\npresent study demonstrated that experiencing persistent Negative Affect is associated with\ngreater use of risky mate attraction and retention behaviors. Those behaviors include\nhaving sex when fearing that your mate will leave if you do not, having sex even though a\npartner refused to use protection, and agreeing to sexual behaviors you would rather not do\nin order to keep the partner from leaving. Engaging in sex primarily for the purpose of\nattracting or retaining a partner may thereby expose one to several possible dangers.\nClearly, having sex without using protection exposes both parties to the possibility of STD\ntransmission and pregnancy. The potential consequences of unsafe sex may increase the\nanxiety experienced by people prone to anxious symptoms. Engaging in behaviors viewed\nas unpleasant or undesirable, be they sexual or not, also maintains Negative Affect in\ngeneral (Grosscup and Lewinsohn, 1980); At a minimum, engaging in instrumental sex or\nother manipulative behaviors is, for most of us, unpleasant for both the manipulator and the\nmanipulated.\nTurning to the structural models, the primary theoretical model, Model 1.0, which is\nbased on evolutionary economic theory, predicted a set of causal pathways from Negative\nNegative Affect, Mate Value, Mating Effort\nAffect to Personal Mate Value, from Personal Mate Value to Short and Long-Term Partner\nMate Value, and from both Short-Term and Long-Term Partner Mate Value to Mating\nEffort. The best-fitting and most parsimonious models, Restricted Model 1.1 and\nReinterpreted Model 2.1, disconfirmed this prediction.\nModel 1.1 specified a direct effect, from Negative Affect to Mate Retention Efforts;\nbut no indirect effect, whereas in Model 2.1, which is based on LH Theory, the indirect\neffect from the LH Factor to Mating Effort via Personal Mate Value and Long-Term\nPartner Mate Value was at best negligible. Whether Negative Affect is seen as the ultimate\ncause, or as an indicator of an underlying \"fast\" life history strategy, these findings imply\nthat greater Negative Affect is associated with: (1) a lower threshold for accepting a either a\nshort- or long-term partner; and (2) greater effort to attract or retain a partner. In short,\nNegative Affect is associated with exerting increased sexual efforts that produce fewer\nbenefits in reproductive fitness.\nAlthough there was very little mathematical basis on which to decide between\nModels 1.1 and 2.1 based on the current cross-sectional, correlational data, we can do so\nexperimentally. Each model predicts a unique set of relations among measures of Negative\nAffect, Personal Mate Value, and Mating Effort. For example, Model 1.1 predicts that\nchanges in Negative Affect will produce large and easily detected changes in a person's\nestimated Personal Mate Value and less easily detected changes in Mating Effort through\ndirect causal links (see Figure 2). To be more specific, Model 1.1 predicts that significant\nincreases in Negative Affect will cause large decreases in Personal Mate Value and smaller\nbut detectable increases in Cumulative Sexual Frequency, Sexual Situations, and Mate\nRetention tactics, the three indicators of Mating Effort. In contrast, Model 2.1 predicts that\nchanges in Negative Affect will produce no changes in a person's estimated Personal Mate\nValue or Mating Effort. That is, any empirically observed relations among Negative Affect,\nPersonal Mate Value, and Mating Effort will be mediated by the common causal influence\nof the LH Factor. A simple power analysis indicates that the data patterns predicted by\nModel 1.1 can be detected, with a standardized regression weight of 0.85, by taking\nappropriate measures from 102 participants. Hence, a study taking appropriate measures\nfrom about 100 participants should provide a critical test of the unique set of predictions\ngenerated by Models 1.1 and 2.1. Such a study is now in progress.\nBy either account, the explanatory power and fit of the preferred Models 1.1 and 2.1\npose a serious challenge to the predictive power of evolutionary economic theory. By\nModel 1.1, there is no indirect effect of Negative Affect on Mating Effort; thus, the expected\nlower mate value of partners of those with greater Negative Affect is not predicted to lower\nthe effort expended to attract or retain them. By Model 2.1, the correlations between\nNegative Affect and Mating Effort and between Negative Affect and Personal Mate Value\nare both spurious. Both models thereby contradict basic tenets of evolutionary economic\ntheory.\nSummary\nThe present study examined relations among Negative Affect, Mate Value, and\nMating Effort. An a priori model (Model 1.0), based on evolutionary economic theory,\npredicted that Negative Affect simultaneously increases Mating Effort directly, and\ndecreases it indirectly by reducing the expected mate value of one's partner. The present\nresults support the first and disconfirm the second prediction. Two alternative models,\nNegative Affect, Mate Value, Mating Effort\nModel 1.1, based on evolutionary economic theory, and Model 2.1, based on Life History\nTheory, described the data almost equally well. These models, however, predict different\nsuites of behavior in the face of changing levels of Negative Affect. Model 1.1 predicts a\ndramatic change in Personal Mate Value and a less dramatic but detectable change in\nMating Effort when Negative Affect changes. In contrast, Model 2.1 predicts that both\nPersonal Mate Value and Mating Effort will remain stable when Negative Affect changes.\nAlthough we briefly discuss several pragmatic implications of these models, we stress the\ntheoretical importance of examining the empirical veracity of these models carefully.\nReferences\nBeck, A.
