A legiti\u00ad mate concern is whether academic health centers, with their emphasis on\n\n\n\n\n\ntertiary care, provide trainees with a range of common medical problems in their primary care clinics.5\n\nMETHOD\n\nEach visit to the outpatient clinics of the University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) for which a bill was produced and an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 diagnosis recorded for the year July 1989-June 1990 was examined for principal diagnosis and provider identification. Diagnoses were coded according to the scheme devised by Schneeweiss et al.,8 which organizes ambulatory care diagnoses into 92 common clusters. Their fre\u00ad quencies were compared with the fre\u00ad quencies of the clusters in the Na\u00ad tional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) of 1989.7 In that survey, the 92 clusters comprised 78% of all outpatient visits. The top 25 clusters covered 52% of visits, with each accounting for at least 1% of all visits.\nThe  UIH  ambulatory  care  clinics\nwere grouped in five categories: (1) primary care clinics (family practice, general internal medicine, general pe\u00ad diatrics); (2) general clinics of the other departments having required third-year clerkships (surgery, obstetrics- gynecology,   psychiatry);\n(3) subspecialty clinics within the de\u00ad partments of medicine (endocrinology, pulmonary diseases, cardiology, medi\u00ad cal oncology, gastroenterology, neph\u00ad rology, infectious diseases, hematol\u00ad ogy, occupational medicine, and arthritis), surgery (surgical oncology, vascular surgery, and obesity), and pe\u00ad diatrics (pediatric hematology and on\u00ad cology); (4) other specialty clinics (dermatology, ophthalmology, otola\u00ad ryngology, orthopedics, urology, anes\u00ad thesiology, neurology, and neurosur\u00ad gery); and (5) the Department of Emergency Medicine. These five groups comprised 96% of all  visits. The remaining 4% were visits without identification of diagnosis or clinic. These were excluded from analysis.\n  The frequency of visits to each clinic category was determined for the 92 diagnostic clusters. Because of the\n\nlarge numbers of visits to the UIH clinics and in the NAMCS, all differ\u00ad ences are statistically significant. Sig\u00ad nificant differences may not necessar\u00ad ily be meaningful differences.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThere were 195,165 visits recorded. Only 27,957 (14%) were to the primary care clinics, while 79,708 (41%) were to the other specialty clinics. The 25 most common diagnostic clusters from the NAMCS made up 18,107 (64.8%) of all visits to the primary care clinics, more than the 52.2% nationally. How\u00ad ever, only eight of the 25 clusters ac\u00ad counted for more than 1% of the visits to these clinics. These clusters were general medical examination (7,437 visits), hypertension (2,738 visits), diabetes mellitus (2,425 visits), otitis media (1,115 visits), upper respiratory infections (809 visits), malignant neo\u00ad plasms (655 visits), lower respiratory infections (387 visits), and dermatitis and eczema (388 visits).\n  The number of clusters accounting for more than 1% of the visits in\u00ad creased to nine when the general clinics of the other departments with third-year clerkships were included. This cluster was prenatal care (19,301 visits). The number increased to 13 when emergency medicine visits were also included. These clusters were lac\u00ad erations, abrasions, and contusions (2,249 visits); acute sprains and strains (703 visits); fractures and dis\u00ad locations (519 visits); and urinary tract infections (524 visits). A 14th was added from the subspecialty clinics of medicine, surgery, and pedi\u00ad atrics: ischemic heart disease (920 visits). An additional eight clusters were added when the other specialty clinics were included. These were cat\u00ad aracts (3,456 visits), refractive error (3,231 visits), low back pain (1,231 visits), benign neoplasms (1,085 visits), rhinitis (735 visits), sinusitis (699 visits), acne (693 visits), and bur\u00ad sitis (583  visits)-bringing  the  total to 22. Sixteen of the 25 leading clus\u00ad ters were seen commonly in the other specialty clinics, five of which were also seen in the primary care clinics.\n\nNine of the 25 leading clusters were seen commonly in the Department of Emergency Medicine, four of which were also seen in the primary care clinics. Of the six clusters seen in the subspecialty clinics of medicine, sur\u00ad gery, and pediatrics, five were seen commonly in the primary care clinics. Unusual or non-groupable diag\u00ad noses - those not included in the 92 clustersoftheSchneeweiss classification-were seen less fre\u00ad quently in the primary care clinics (4,920 visits, 17.6%) than they were in\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe results of the present study show that the common diagnostic clusters were poorly represented in the pri\u00ad mary care clinics and the subspecialty clinics of medicine, surgery, and pedi\u00ad atrics. The pattern appears to be that the primary care clinics saw a limited range of diagnoses, although these are among the common outpatient diag\u00ad noses, while the specialty services saw the bulk of common outpatient diag\u00ad noses. For a student or resident to get exposure to a majority of these clus\u00ad ters, he or she would probably need outpatient experience in addition to that provided by departments of the primary care clinics. These would in\u00ad clude some experience in ambulatory care in specialties outside the tradi\u00ad tional third-year clerkships.\n  Many of the benefits of ambulatory care medicine training are indepen\u00ad dent of specialty. These include longi\u00ad tudinal observation of medical prob\u00ad lems from presentation through resolution and understanding of psy\u00ad chosocial aspects of patient care.8 Nevertheless, physicians in training need to observe and study the common medical conditions they will see in pri\u00ad mary ambulatory care settings outside the academic health center. More in\u00ad tensive use of a center's specialty clinics for primary care training may be an alternative to the use of off\u00ad campus clinical primary care prac\u00ad tices, which may be difficult to sup\u00ad port financi ally910 and complicated to administer.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n2.
