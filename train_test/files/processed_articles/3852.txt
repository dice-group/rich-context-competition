    "abstract": "Abstract\nSynthetic drug abuse has become an increasingly serious problem among adolescents in Macao, the world's largest gambling\nmarket and the only legal gambling place in China. To counteract this trend, a good understanding of the culturally relevant\nrisk factors for this behavior is required. Based on social learning theory and opportunity perspective of deviance, logistic\nregression analysis was performed on a probability sample of 8,076 Macao students collected in 2014 to investigate whether\ndelinquent peer association, recreational use of time with friends, attitudes toward drug use, and the availability of synthetic\ndrugs are significant predictors of synthetic drug use among adolescents. The analyses revealed that students who had more\ndrug-using peers, perceived drug use to be less harmful, and had easier access to synthetic drugs were more likely to use\ndrugs. The findings indicate that preventing synthetic drug use among adolescents should target individual risk factors and\nthe availability of drugs.\n",

China is no exception.\nOfficial statistics show that the rate of synthetic drug use in\nChina grew faster than the rate of natural drug use (China\nNational Narcotics Control Commission Office, 2015), espe-\ncially among the younger population. Nationally, approxi-\nmately 75% of the 7 million synthetic drug users in mainland\nAlthough what fueled the rapid increase in synthetic drug\nabuse in China is not completely known, there seems to be\nlittle doubt that the popularity of synthetic drugs among\nyouth and adolescents has played an important role shaping\nthe trend. Unlike American youth who are more likely to use\nmarijuana than any other illicit drug (Johnston, O'Malley,\nMiech, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2017), adolescents in\nAsia, especially those in the Greater China Region, typically\nchoose synthetic drugs as their drugs of choice. Official sta-\ntistics released by the Food and Drug Administration of\nfar more likely to use synthetic drugs than traditional drugs.\nThis pattern holds true in Macao, a Special Administrative\nRegion of China and the only place in the country where\ngambling is legal. According to the surveys conducted by\nphetamine and ketamine were the most frequently used drugs\namong young drug users in recent years (Macao Social\ndata, official statistics from the Central Registration System\nfor Drug Abusers of Macao also show that young drug users\nregistered in the system disproportionally used synthetic\ndrugs such as methamphetamine and ketamine as opposed to\ntraditional drugs (Macao Social Welfare Bureau, 2016).\nTo reverse the trend of increase in synthetic drug use\namong adolescents in the Greater China Region, we need\ncountermeasures that are scientifically based and effective. A\nstarting point in developing such countermeasures is to iden-\ntify culturally relevant factors contributing to the problem.\nHowever, there has been little scientific evidence that can\nserve as a basis for building systematic understanding of the\nkey driving forces leading to the spread of adolescent syn-\nthetic drug abuse in this region. Our study aims to contribute\nto the knowledge base through a population-based survey.\nWhile large-scale representative studies are lacking,\nsmaller studies using nonprobability samples have offered\nsome suggestions of potential predictors of adolescent use of\nsynthetical drugs in the Greater China Region.

They do not neces-\nsarily consider synthetic substances, such as ketamine, to be\ndrugs at all. In their minds, traditional drugs, such as opium\nand heroin, are dangerous and should be avoided. To these\nyoung people, synthetic drugs do not pose the same risks and\nare acceptable to use, especially when doing it with friends\nby party culture, drug dealers market synthetic drugs to ado-\nlescents as recreational consumer goods, promote the use of\nmethamphetamine or ketamine as new types of fashion, and\npropagate the notion that the occasional use of synthetic\ndrugs is harmless.

Methamphetamine, for example, is fre-\nquently trafficked from West Africa to South Africa or\nEurope and later to East and Southeast Asia (United Nations\nThis change has increased synthetic drug trafficking to Asia.\nAt the street level, drug dealers increasingly rely on the sale\nof synthetic drugs for profit. These market conditions have\nincreased the supply and use of synthetic drugs in this part of\nthe world.\nThe primary purpose of the current research is to identify\nculturally relevant predictors of synthetic drug use among\nadolescents in Macao. Built on prior knowledge in this area,\nthis study focuses on the modern party culture and drug\navailability while taking into account of other potential cor-\nrelates of the delinquent behavior.\nLiterature Review\nLam et al. (2004) and Hunt, Joe-Laidler, Moloney, van der\nPoel, and van de Mheen (2011) attributed the spread of drug\nuse among urban adolescents to the modern party culture,\nwhich places heavy emphasis on communicating with friends\nand regards the use of psychoactive drugs as a ritual, a form\nof recreation, and an activity enhancer (e.g., dancing and\nsinging). Youth in the Greater China Region who are drawn\nto the party culture tend to share at least three characteristics.\nFirst, they have more unconventional friends and peer rela-\ntionships. Second, they spend more time in recreational\nactivities. Third, they have more favorable attitudes toward\npsychoactive drugs (Hua & Li, 2009; Perrone & Sanders,\npersonal characteristics have each been shown to positively\ncorrelate with substance abuse (Arthur et al., 2007; Arthur,\nHawkins, Pollard, & Catalano, 2002; Hawkins, Catalano, &\nalso been found to be a significant predictor of illicit drug\nuse. For many adolescents, drug use is a choice of pastime.\nThey may start to use drugs when the activity is encouraged\nand approved by peers and when an illicit drug is readily\navailable. First-time use does not usually require a lot of\neffort. Continuing use over a period of time, however, may\ndepend more on one's ability to obtain drugs. Either behavior\nis tied to the availability of drugs (Desmond, Bruce, & Stacer,\nPeer Influence, Time in Recreation, Attitudes\nToward Drugs, and Addictive Behavior\nOne of the strongest and most consistent correlates of delin-\nquency in the criminology literature is the association with\ndelinquent peers, especially during adolescence when the\nrelationship with friends supersedes the relationship with\nparents (Thornberry, 2005). According to the social learning\ntheory, individuals learn deviant behavior (e.g., drug use)\nthrough their associations with other people, such as family\nmembers, siblings, and peers (Akers & Sellers, 2009;\nPetraitis, Flay, & Miller, 1995). Individuals associated with\ndeviant peers are more likely to hold attitudes favorable to\ndeviance, learn the skills to commit crime, and engage in\ndeviant or criminal behavior (Sutherland, Cressey, &\nLuckenbill, 1992). Many studies have indicated that associa-\ntion with substance-using peers is significantly and posi-\ntively correlated with substance use among youth (Hawkins\nin peer groups is also a strong predictor of adolescents' atti-\ntudes and actual drug use (Iannotti & Bush, 1992; Simons-\nMorton & Farhat, 2010). A meta-analytic study comparing\nthe influence of parents and peers found that peers and\nfriends have stronger influences than parents on adolescent\nsubstance use (Allen, Donohue, Griffin, Ryan, & Turner,\n2003). Research conducted in Hong Kong and Taiwan also\nfound that peer influence contributed significantly to youth\npattern has been observed in Macao. Studies conducted by Li\nand colleagues (Li, Tang, Xia, & Zhang, 2016; Li, Zhang,\nTang, Xia, & Lin, 2016) found that the association and time\nspent with delinquent peers were positively correlated to\ndrug use among adolescents in Macao.\nLi et al. 3\nFurthermore, several studies examining the relationship\nbetween leisure activities and antisocial behavior have found\nthat certain recreational activities (e.g., going out at night)\nincreased the risk of problematic behavior (e.g., drug use)\namong youth (Berg, Aslanikashvili, & Djibuti, 2014;\nleisure activities, such as hanging out with friends for fun,\nwere found to be associated with heavy drinking among high\nschool seniors (Bachman et al., 2002) and first-year college\nstudents (Finlay, Ram, Maggs, & Caldwell, 2012). Piko and\nVazsonyi (2004) found that peer-oriented or commercial-\nbased leisure activities are positively correlated with prob-\nlem behavior among Hungarian youth aged 14 to 19 years.\nFindings from Monitoring the Future consistently indicated\nthat socializing with peers away from home and authority\nfigures is closely related to deviant behavior (Johnston,\nO'Malley, Schulenberg, & Bachman, 2006).\nA number of studies have found that juveniles who had\nfavorable attitudes toward drugs and drug use were more\nlikely to use drugs (Bretteville-Jensen & Jacobi, 2011;\nThe perceived harms of drug use are especially important in\npredicting substance abuse. Studies have found that adoles-\ncents have a tendency to underestimate the harms of certain\ndrugs, especially synthetic drugs that are designed to appeal\nto young people (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2014).\nFurthermore, limited health literacy and the lack of personal\nawareness of the risks of substance use contribute to the mis-\nuse and/or abuse of psychotic drugs (Shek, 2012; Shone,\ncent synthetic drug users in Shanghai, China, found that the\nrespondents' lack of understanding of the harmfulness of\ndrugs and drug use was the main reason for their involve-\nment in synthetic drug abuse (Fan & Li, 2012).\nDrug Availability and Drug Use\nThe availability of drugs in community has also been identi-\nfied as a significant predictor of the prevalence and frequency\nof adolescent drug use, especially for those who are prone to\ndrug use because of delinquent peer associations, beliefs, or\naffectivity (Caviness, Tzilos, Anderson, & Stein, 2015;\nCoudun, G\u00e9gout, Piedallu, & Rameau, 2006; Dembo,\n1989). This idea is highlighted in the availability-proneness\ntheory of drug abuse proposed by Reginald Smart, which\ncontends that drug abuse is more likely to occur when a drug-\nprone individual is exposed to a high level of availability\n(Smart, 1980). This notion is consistent with the opportunity\nperspective in the criminology literature. In their popular\nbook A General Theory of Crime, Gottfredson and Hirschi\n(1990) argued that people with low self-control, character-\nized by impulsiveness and risk-taking, have a higher propen-\nsity for criminal behavior. The actual commission of crime,\nhowever, is conditioned by illegitimate opportunity. People\nwith low self-control will likely commit a crime when the\nopportunity presents itself. Without the opportunity, criminal\nproneness may not actually result in a criminal act. In this\nregard, drug availability can be seen as an opportunity factor.\nAdolescents influenced by delinquent peers and delinquent\nbeliefs are more likely to use drugs when they are readily\navailable or accessible. However, their proneness to drug use\nmay stay dormant if drugs are inaccessible to them. Several\nstudies have confirmed that drug availability has a signifi-\ncant effect on adolescent drug use (Bretteville-Jensen &\n& Prout, 2011; Freisthler, Gruenewald, Johnson, Treno, &\nCurrent Research\nAlthough researchers have conducted a large number of\nstudies on synthetic drug use among youth in the past several\ndecades, there is still a lack of understanding of the factors\ncontributing to synthetic drug abuse. Most of the research on\ndrug use has been conducted in the West. Studies examining\nthe causes of synthetic drug use among adolescents have\nbeen scarce in the Greater China Region, especially in\nMacao. A survey of students in schools conducted recently\nby Li and associates (2015) found that adolescents in Macao\nhad a higher rate of synthetic drug use than their counterparts\nin nearby regions. However, the study did not explain why\nMacao adolescents were more likely to use synthetic drugs.\nMost of the studies on synthetic drug use conducted in the\nGreater China Region have been descriptive based on data\ncollected from nonprobability samples. Studies examining\nthe influence of peers, drug use attitude, party culture and\navailability of drugs usually focused on one of these factors\nwithout considering the contribution of the other factors.\nMultivariate statistical analysis using rigorous methodology\nand large random sample is rare. To date, reliable evidence is\nlacking with regard to how those factors influence adolescent\nuse of synthetic drugs in the Greater China Region. This\nstudy attempts to fill this gap. Specifically, it tests the follow-\ning hypotheses.\nHypothesis 1: Factors related to the modern party cul-\nture, including association with drug-using peers, time\nspent on recreational activities with friends, and favorable\nattitudes toward synthetic drugs, significantly predict syn-\nthetic drug use among Macao adolescents. All of these\nfactors have been known as correlates of adolescent drug\nuse. As an unconventional way of making friends and\nsharing experiences, party culture increases adolescents'\nexposure to these risk factors, which in turn leads to a\nhigher level of involvement in synthetic drug use.\nHypothesis 2: The availability of synthetic drugs poses\nan additional risk factor for synthetic drug use among\n4 SAGE Open\nMacao adolescents. The common motives for adolescents\nin Macao to use drugs appear to be curiosity and the pur-\nsuit of fun and excitement (Li et al., 2015). They may not\nuse them or doing it less frequently if they must spend\nconsiderable effort to acquire synthetic drugs. On the con-\ntrary, if the drugs are more readily available at the time\nthey want to use them, they will be more likely to seize\nthe opportunity to engage in drug-using behavior.\nMethod\nData\nThe data used in this study were collected in Students and\nDrugs in Macao 2014, a large-scale survey sponsored by the\ngovernment of Macao and conducted by the research team.\nThe main purpose of the study was to identify the level and\npattern of substance abuse among students enrolled in Macao\nschools and colleges and the factors related to their addictive\nbehavior. The target population was fifth- and sixth-grade\nprimary school students, middle school students, and high\nschool students in Macao. To increase representativeness, we\napplied a multistage stratified probability-proportional-to-\nsize cluster sampling method to select 15 primary schools\nand 20 secondary schools. The sample consisted of nearly\n8,300 students who were asked to participate in the survey\nfrom July to December of 2014. Strict procedures were used\nto ensure voluntary participation and to protect the students'\nconfidentiality. The response rate was approximately 97%.\nUsing a structured, self-administrated questionnaire, we\ncollected the following information in the survey: demo-\ngraphic characteristics, family background, parenting prac-\ntices, routine activities, school performance, attitudes toward\ndrug use, antidrug education experience, and drug use. Many\nitems on the questionnaire were based on standard instru-\nments used in previous studies conducted in other cultural\ncontexts, such as the National Longitudinal Study of Youth\nO'Malley, Bachman, Schulenberg, & Miech, 2014). When\nnecessary, we modified the items to accommodate for\nMacao's context. Trained investigators administered the sur-\nvey in class. To prevent interference, we asked teachers to\nstep out of the classroom when conducting the survey.\nAltogether, we received 8,076 completed questionnaires:\nstudents, and 3,719 from high school students.\nMeasurements\nThe key variables examined in this study were synthetic drug\nuse, association with drug-using peers, time spent in recre-\national activities with friends, attitudes toward synthetic drugs,\nand the availability of synthetic drugs. We also included a set\nof control variables in the regression analysis. The appendix\nprovides a summary of the variables and their measures.\nSynthetic drug use. Previous studies show that the same pre-\ndictor may have different effect on substance use depending\non whether drug use is measured as 30-day, annual or life-\ntime prevalence of use (Gao et al., 2010; Johnston et al.,\nwhether the predictive power of the key variables varies by\ntype of prevalence of use, we included three measures of\nsynthetic drug use: past-month use, past-year use, and life-\ntime use. In the survey, the respondents were asked how\nmany times they had used ketamine, ecstasy/MDMA, ice/\nmethamphetamine, tranquilizers (e.g., rohypnol and mid-\nazolam), and hybrid synthetic drugs in the past 30 days, in\nthe past 12 months, and in their lifetime. Each item was mea-\nsured on a 7-point scale, where 1 = 0 occasions and 7 = 40 or\nmore occasions. Because our primary focus is prevalence of\nuse among the youth population, we dichotomized the mea-\nsures of synthetic drug use such that 0 = did not use any\nsynthetic drug and 1 = used at least one type of synthetic\ndrug. This measurement approach is common in population-\nbased studies of drug use (Herman-Stahl, Krebs, Kroutil, &\nAssociation with synthetic drug-using peers.Association with\nsynthetic drug-using peers is a composite variable, measured\nby five items asking how many of the respondent's friends\nwere thought to use ketamine, ecstasy/MDMA, ice/metham-\nphetamine, tranquilizers (e.g., rohypnol and midazolam), or\nhybrid synthetic drugs. The responses were measured on a\n5-point scale ranging from none to all, with higher values indi-\ncating more synthetic drug-using friends. Cronbach's alpha\nfor these five items was 0.92, indicating high-level interitem\ncorrelations. We computed a mean score of these items as a\nmeasure of the association with synthetic drug-using peers.\nRecreational use of time with friends. The frequency of recre-\national use of time with friends was measured by asking the\nrespondents how often they met with friends informally,\nsuch as going to a party or hanging out. The responses ranged\nfrom 1 = never to 5 = nearly daily.\nAttitudes toward synthetic drugs.We focused on the perceived\nharms of synthetic drug use. The respondents were asked to\nrespond to four statements designed to assess their perceived\nharms of synthetic drug use (e.g., \"How much do you think\npeople risk harming themselves if they occasionally/regularly\nuse ketamine?\"). The responses ranged from 1 = no risk to 5 =\ngreat risk. We reverse recoded the four items and computed\ntheir mean to measure attitudes toward synthetic drug use.\nHigher scores represented lower perceived harms or more\nfavorable attitudes toward synthetic drug use (alpha = 0.93).\nAvailability of synthetic drugs. The respondents were asked to\nreport how difficult they thought it would be for them to\nobtain synthetic drugs, such as ketamine, ecstasy/MDMA,\nLi et al. 5\nice/methamphetamine, tranquilizers (e.g., rohypnol and mid-\nazolam), and hybrid synthetic drugs. The responses ranged\nfrom 1 = nearly impossible to 5 = very easy. The alpha coef-\nficient for the five questions was 0.90, indicating a high level\nof interitem correlation. We computed a single measure by\ntaking the mean of all responses, with higher values repre-\nsenting greater levels of synthetic drug availability.\nControl variables.We included several other risk factors,\nall of which have been shown to correlate with adolescent\ndrug use in studies conducted outside Macao, as potential\ncompeting explanations to the explanatory variables listed\nabove. Parental supervision was measured by asking the\nrespondent's perceived supervision and rule-setting from\ntheir mother and father. The scale is measured by taking\nan average of 10 items, five for mother and five for father.\nThe overall alpha equals to 0.90. Low self-control is mea-\nsured by Hirschi's (2004) 9-item measurement, and the\nscale is ranged from 0 to 9. School attachment is measured\nby seven questions on how the respondents' bond to\nschool or school life (alpha = 0.68). Risk-taking is mea-\nsured by two items on the respondent's tendency for risk-\ntaking behavior (alpha = 0.70). We also included a variable\nmeasuring whether the respondent participated in any\nantidrug educational programs. The variable was coded as\n1 if the respondent participated in a program and 0 if he or\nshe did not.\nLast, we included demographic and family background\nvariables that may operate as common confounders affecting\nadolescents' synthetic drug-using behavior (Flynn, Falco, &\nand Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). Gender\nwas coded as 1 for females and 0 for males. Grade was coded\nas 1 for elementary school, 2 for middle school, and 3 for\nhigh school. In the analysis, we computed two dummy vari-\nables representing middle and high school students and\ntreated elementary school students as a reference group.\nTwo-parent home was measured by asking respondents with\nwhom they lived. It was coded as a dummy variable, with 1\nfor living with both parents and 0 for the rest. Parents' work-\ning status was measured by asking the respondents whether\ntheir father/mother had a paid job. The answers were coded\nas 1 for yes and 0 for no. We computed two dummy variables\nby combining the answers for father and mother to indicate\nthat one of the parents had a paid job or neither of them had\na paid job. Respondents whose parents both had paid jobs\nwere regarded as the reference group.\nAnalytical Method\nWe first use cross-tabulation to explore the prevalence rate of\nsynthetic drug use in the past month, past year, and lifetime\nby gender and grade of the respondents. Three multivariate\nlogistic regressions are then conducted to investigate the fac-\ntors associated with synthetic drug use. Case-wise deleting\nmethod is used to handle item missing in the response. The\nstatistic software applied in the current study is STATA 14.0.\nResults\nDescriptive Results\nAbout 1.46% of the respondents had used at least one type of\nsynthetic drug, such as ketamine, ecstasy/MDMA, ice/meth-\namphetamine, tranquilizers (e.g., rohypnol and midazolam),\nand hybrid synthetic drugs, in their lifetime. Approximately\nmonth, respectively (see Table 1).\nThe rates of synthetic use among male adolescents were\nhigher than those of female adolescents for lifetime use\nalso noticeable. Synthetic drug use was most prevalent\namong fifth and sixth graders at the elementary school level.\nThe rate of use was higher among middle school students\nthan high school students with regard to past-year use (1.01%\nschool students, however, had a higher lifetime use rate than\nOverall, the statistics shown in Table 1 indicate that synthetic\ndrug use is more prevalent among younger students in the\npopulation of fifth to 12th graders in Macao. This finding is\nconsistent with the results of several other studies showing\nthat synthetic drug users in Macao are getting younger\nreason that students in lower grades were more likely to use\nsynthetic drugs has not been explored in previous research.\nIn the current study, students from elementary schools\nreported lower participation in antidrug educational pro-\ngrams, which might be responsible for their relatively higher\nrate of synthetic drug use.\nLogistic Regression Analysis Results\nWe constructed three logistic regression models, each with\none of the three measures of synthetic drug use as the depen-\ndent variable. As shown in Table 2, the association with syn-\nthetic drug-using peers was significantly and positively\ncorrelated to the students'synthetic drug use throughout their\nlifetime, in the past year, and in the past month. More specifi-\ncally, a one-unit increase in the measure of association with\nsynthetic drug-using peers (e.g., from 1 = none to 2 = very\nfew) increases the odds of an adolescent's lifetime use of\nthese statistical tests were significant with p < .001.\nSecond, recreational use of time with friends was not a\nsignificant predictor of lifetime, past-year, and past-month\nuse of synthetic drugs among Macao adolescents.\n6 SAGE Open\nAttitudes toward synthetic drug use were also signifi-\ncantly related to synthetic drug use. Compared with those\nwho perceived greater risk of synthetic drug use, adolescents\nwho perceived lower risk were much more likely to use syn-\nthetic drugs. Specifically, a one-unit decrease on the 5-point\nscale used to measure perceived harms of synthetic drug use\nwould increase the likelihood of lifetime use by 1.70 times,\ntimes. The coefficients for lifetime, past-year, and past-\nmonth use were all significant with p < .001.\nThe availability of synthetic drugs was also found to be a\nsignificant predictor of synthetic drug use. A one-unit\nincrease on the 5-point scale (e.g., from \"nearly impossible\"\nto \"very difficult\") measuring availability of synthetic drugs\nwas associated with an increase in lifetime use of synthetic\nmonth use by 0.19 times. All coefficients were significant\nDiscussion\nThe results of the regression analysis are mostly consistent\nwith our expectations. Of the key independent variables\nassessed in the regression analysis, association with syn-\nthetic drug-using peers and favorable attitudes toward syn-\nthetic drugs stood out as the strongest predictors of synthetic\ndrug use among Macao adolescents. Specifically, increased\ndelinquent peer associations and decreased perceived harms\nTable 1.

In support of the\nopportunity perspective of criminological theory, this study\nfinds that drug availability is significantly and positively cor-\nrelated with the three measures of synthetic drug use. These\nrelationships, however, are not as strong as those for delin-\nquent peer associations and attitudes toward synthetic drugs,\nsuggesting that individual-level factors, such as choice of\nfriends and antidrug attitudes, may play more important roles\nin influencing adolescents' synthetic drug use.\nDespite this study's extensive scope and representative-\nness, it has some limitations. This study is one of only a few\nsurveys in Asia that have adopted many questions from U.S.\nsurveys of adolescent drug use such as Monitoring the\nFuture. The use of standard instruments has the advantage of\nproducing measures with strong validity and reliability as\nshown in this study. On the flip side, however, this practice\nmay have undermined our ability to capture culturally rele-\nvant variation. For example, the results show that time spent\nin recreational activities is not a significant predictor of ado-\nlescent synthetic drug use in Macao. This unexpected finding\nmay be related to the measurement we used. In consistency\nwith how time with friends is measured in Monitoring the\nFuture, we asked the student respondents how often they had\nmet with friends informally, such as going to a party or hang-\ning out. These questions may not be specific enough to mea-\nsure time-sharing activities with friends that amplify\nsynthetic drug use in the specific cultural setting, such as\ngoing to KTVs or attending parties where synthetic drugs\n(e.g., ketamine) are used. There are also two design issues\nthat may limit the validity of the study. First, the research\ndesign was cross-sectional. The relationships discovered in\nthe analysis are correlational in nature and should be inter-\npreted as such. More studies are needed to test the causal\nlinks between delinquent peer associations, recreational use\nof time with friends, proneness to drugs, and availability of\nsynthetic drugs and synthetic drug use. Second, the respon-\ndents only consisted of students who attended school during\nthe time of the survey. Adolescents who dropped out of\nschool or did not attend their classes were not included in the\nsurvey. Studies have shown that adolescents who do not go\nto school tend to have higher rates of drug use than those\n2011). Thus, our results can only be applied to at-school stu-\ndents in Macao. Consequently, the overall rate of drug use\namong adolescents in Macao may have been underestimated.\nFuture studies should make a better effort to reach out to ado-\nlescents who do not attend schools.\nbest a midsize city by Chinese standards. Despite the recent\ngrowth of the gaming industry, part of the society remains\nconventional with a high level of informal social control (Li,\n2014), which may explain the overall lower rate of delin-\nquency (e.g., drug use) in this society. However, significant\nrisks exist for adolescent drug use, as shown in this study.\nFirst, like young people elsewhere, Macao adolescents are\nsusceptible to the bad influences of unconventional peers.\nThe opportunities for Macao adolescents to develop delin-\nquent peer associations have become ever greater. Macao is\na popular tourist destination. Thousands of tourists pour into\nthe city every day (Macao Statistics and Census Service,\n2016). Some of these visitors are young vagabonds from\nHong Kong, Guangdong, and other places in China, trying to\nmake money through illegal activities, such as synthetic drug\ntrafficking. They prey on adolescents using various market-\ning techniques and even befriend them (Macao Social\nWelfare Bureau, 2016). Adolescents in Macao also travel to\nHong Kong and bordering Chinese cities to meet people and\nto have parties. Sometimes, the main purpose of their trips is\nto buy and use drugs (Li, 2016). With more opportunities to\nmeet unconventional peers, some adolescents, especially\nthose with family and school problems, will be at high risk of\ndeveloping delinquent peer associations. Indeed, a sizable\nportion of our sample reported that they had friends who\nsmoke, drink, or use drugs. This kind of peer relationship\nmay increase their likelihood to use drugs. Second, under the\ninfluence of the modern party culture, synthetic drug use has\nincreasingly been seen as an acceptable way to have fun by\nmany adolescents in the Peal Delta Region including Macao\nAdolescents exposed to the subculture tend to underestimate\nthe harms of synthetic drug use. For many of these young\npeople, traditional drugs such as opium and heroin are addic-\ntive and dangerous. Synthetic drugs, on the contrary, do not\ncarry the same level of risk and are therefore safer to use. If\nunchecked, the internationalization of these cultural norms\nmay lead to a significantly higher rate of synthetic drug\nabuse among the youth population. Third, synthetic drugs\nhave become increasingly accessible to adolescents who\nwant to use them. In the past, most drugs trafficked to Macao\nwere opioids from Southeast Asia, particularly, the Golden\nTriangle. Nowadays, synthetic drugs, such as ketamine and\nmethamphetamine, have largely replaced opioids. The\nregions of China close to Macao, especially Guangdong\nProvince, have become major producers of synthetic drugs\n(China National Narcotics Control Commission Office,\n2015). Due to geographic proximity, Macao has become a\nkey market for these illegal substances (Macao Social\nWelfare Bureau, 2016). Easy access to synthetic drugs pro-\nvides more opportunities for sensation-seeking adolescents\nto use them.\nThe results of this study suggest that public policies aimed\nat preventing synthetic drug use among Macao adolescents\nshould promote several key strategies. One way is to pay more\nattention to adolescents who are more peer-oriented and are\nmore frequently associated with drug-using peers. Parents,\n8 SAGE Open\nteachers, and social workers should encourage adolescents to\ndevelop healthy relationships with conventional peers (Barnes,\nReifman, Farrell, & Dintcheff, 2000; Cottrell, Li, Harris,\nD'Alessandri, & Stanton, 2003; Li, Stanton, & Feigelman,\n2000). Another strategy is to educate adolescents about the\nharms of synthetic drug use and strengthen their antidrug atti-\ntudes. Adolescents who believe that drug use is unacceptable\nor harmful are much less likely to use drugs (Alhyas et al.,\n2015). Parents, teachers, and relevant government agencies\ncan all play important roles in helping students develop the\nright attitudes toward drugs and drug use. Another strategy is\nto control the supply of drugs. Police and customs agencies\nshould explore more effective approaches for reducing drug\ntrafficking and drug selling activities. One thing the agencies\ncan do is to intensify border patrol by using better technolo-\ngies, such as mobile x-ray machines and drug-sniffing dogs,\nand to increase the punishment for drug trafficking (Floyd,\nAlexandre, Hedden, Lawson, & Latimer, 2010; Halverson,\n2004). Currently, drug traffickers face a maximum of 15 years\nof imprisonment in Macao. Many people have argued that this\npunishment does not provide sufficient deterrence (China\nAn increase in the severity of punishment may stop more peo-\nple from smuggling and selling drugs in Macao.\nAppendix\nVariables and Measurements.\nVariable Item Response\nSynthetic drug use Have you or did you use any of the following substances in your lifetime/during the past month/\nduring the past 12 months?\nKetamine 0 = No to 1 = Yes\n MDMA (Ecstasy) 0 = No to 1 = Yes\n Crystal meth (Ice) 0 = No to 1 = Yes\n Pills (Tranquilizer, Cross, etc.) 0 = No to 1 = Yes\n Happy water 0 = No to 1 = Yes\nRecreational use of time How often do you get together with friends\ninformally (like going to a party or hanging out)\n1 = Never to 5 = Nearly daily\nAssociation with synthetic\ndrug use peers\nHow many of your friends would you estimate . . . ?\n Use ketamine 1 = None to 5 = All\n Use MDMA (Ecstasy) 1 = None to 5 = All\n Use methamphetamine (ice, etc.) 1 = None to 5 = All\nAvailability of synthetic\ndrugs\nHow difficult do you think it would be for you to get each of the following types of drugs, if you\nwanted some?\nKetamine 1 = Probably impossible to 5 = Very easy\n MDMA (Ecstasy) 1 = Probably impossible to 5 = Very easy\n Methamphetamine (ice, speed, etc.) 1 = Probably impossible to 5 = Very easy\n Pills (tranquilizer, cross, etc.) 1 = Probably impossible to 5 = Very easy\n Happy water 1 = Probably impossible to 5 = Very easy\nAttitudes toward synthetic\ndrugs\nHow much do you think people risk harming themselves (physically or in other ways), if they . . .\n Take ketamine occasionally 1 = No risk to 5 = Great risk\n Take ketamine regularly 1 = No risk to 5 = Great risk\n Take methamphetamine (ice, speed, etc.)\noccasionally\n1 = No risk to 5 = Great risk\n Take methamphetamine (ice, speed, etc.)\nregularly\n1 = No risk to 5 = Great risk\nAntidrug education Have you participated in any of the following drug education programs?\n Lectures or special group discussions in your\nschool\n Lectures or discussions at other places 0 = No to 1 = Yes\n Media (TV, radio, banner, etc.) 0 = No to 1 = Yes\n Other antidrug activities 0 = No to 1 = Yes\nAuthors' Note\nThe authors alone are responsible for the content and writing of the\narticle.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest\nwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\nLi et al. 9\narticle: The research is based on data collected in Students and\nDrugs in Macao 2014, a project sponsored by the Social Welfare\nBureau of Macao Government.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAkers, R.
