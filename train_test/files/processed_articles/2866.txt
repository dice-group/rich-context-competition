In this context, the net\ninterest margin is the wedge between what the borrowers have to pay for their loans and\nwhat the ultimate lenders actually receive. The aim of this paper is to account for both\nperspectives. For this purpose, we decompose this important economic variable, thereby\nhelping to gain a better understanding of the banks' intermediation functions. The main\nissue we want to address in this paper is the quantification of the components of the\nbanks' net interest margin.\nWe investigate banks' major intermediation functions: namely, the bearing of credit\nrisk, term transformation, and liquidity and payment management for their customers.\nThe idea behind our approach is to estimate the costs associated with performing these\nfunctions. Under the assumption that, at least in the long run, costs are covered by\nearnings, we assume that the earnings from performing the various functions can be\nderived from the respective costs.\nBanks grant loans which are subject to the risk of default. Banks carefully select and\nmonitor their borrowers. Nevertheless, some of these borrowers cannot make their\ninterest payments and are unable to pay back their debts. This is especially true of risky\nloans which have been given to firms in cyclical industries or which are not well\ncollateralized. In this paper, we not only take into account the expected losses of the\ncredit exposure, but also estimate a credit risk premium. Moreover, banks hold bonds\nwhich also expose them to credit risk and should therefore earn them a decent\nremuneration.\nThe banks' term transformation consists in granting long-term loans and taking in short-\nterm deposits. As the term structure of interest rates tends to increase with maturity,\nterm transformation is advantageous for banks. However, if the interest rate level rises,\nbanks' earnings from term transformation decrease because rising interest rates usually\nhave a greater impact on funding costs than on interest income. These differences in\nimpact are due to the fact that the maturities of banks' liabilities are usually shorter than\nthe maturities of their assets. This means that within a given time span of, say, one year,\nthe share of liabilities that has to be renewed at what are now unfavorable conditions is\nlarger than the new business on the asset-side which benefits from the more favorable\ninterest rates.\nAnother main function of banks is to perform liquidity and payment management for\ntheir customers. They carry out money transfers for their customers, they provide cash\nin the ATMs, and they enable their customers to store their money. This function also\nincludes the administrative expenses when customers take out a loan. Often, customers\ndo not pay directly for these services, but pay for them indirectly in terms of reduced\ninterest rates on their deposits and mark-ups on the loans. For instance, customers'\nmoney placed in current accounts is remunerated only at a low rate (if at all), whereas\nthe remuneration of time deposits is geared to capital market rates.\nMost papers that deal with banks' net interest margin derive qualitative statements: for\ninstance, that a bank's market power is positively correlated with its net interest margin.\nBy contrast, our paper aims at making quantitative statements: for instance, that the\nearnings from term transformation account for a certain percentage of a bank's net\ninterest margin.\nA bank's bearing of credit risk is the function that receives the most attention, especially\nin academia. Term transformation is also an often-discussed issue, perhaps because of\nits intuitiveness and owing to bank failures caused by excessive term transformation.\nSurprisingly, in our empirical study, neither the bearing of credit risk nor the earnings\nfrom term transformation are the most important sources of a bank's net interest\nincome. Instead, liquidity and payment management for the bank's customers turns out\nto be the most important source. In our study for the German universal banks, we show\nthat, in 2012, liquidity and payment management account for 47% of a bank's net\ninterest income, followed by earnings from term transformation (35%) and by the\nbearing of credit risk (16%), respectively.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review the literature in this\nfield and state our contribution. Section 3 is about the banks' functions and how we\nquantify their contribution to the banks' net interest margin. In Section 4, we describe\nthe data and Section 5 gives the empirical results. Section 6 concludes.\n2 Literature\nThere is a vast amount of literature on the banks' net interest margin. In principle, this\nliterature can be divided into three strands. The first is about bank characteristics and\nmarket conditions that qualitatively explain the banks' net interest margin. Starting with\na dealership model, which goes back to Ho and Saunders (1981), banks are considered\nas risk-averse dealers between depositors and borrowers of funds. This model has\nbecome fundamental in designing empirical models that explain how banks set their\ninterest rate margins. Theoretical refinements have been suggested during the\nintervening period. Examples of these are Angbazo (1997), Mc Shane and Sharpe\nEntrop, Memmel, Ruprecht, and Wilkens (2012). Their studies extend the basic model\nby introducing, for example, credit risk, interaction between credit and interest rate risk,\nterm transformation, uncertainty with respect to money market rates and the role of non-\ninterest income business. Furthermore, Maudos and Fern\u00e1ndez de Guevara (2004), and\nSaunders and Schumacher (2000) highlight administrative costs as a major determinant\nof the banks' interest margin. In addition, there are empirical papers that analyze the\nbanks' net interest margin without a theoretical model for deriving the determinants; for\nSigmund (2013). By contrast, as stated earlier, we do not try to find further determinants\nof the net interest margin, but to quantify the different contributions made by\nperforming the banks' intermediation functions.\nThe second strand of literature deals with the pass-through of capital market interest\nrates to bank rates, which has been extensively discussed in the literature (e.g. De\nSievers, 2012). While most of this literature is about the question of how completely\nand rapidly banks adjust their rates to changes in market rates, some of these papers\nanalyze the determinants of interest pass-through parameters. By contrast, our interest in\nthe speed of the banks' pass-through is that this speed is one key determinant of the\nbank's term transformation: Banks with a strong market position are able to have a large\ngap between the legal and the actual maturity of the deposits. Using data on banks' own\nassessment of their exposure to interest rate risk, we do not have to estimate how\nquickly a single bank adjusts its rates to changes in the market rates, but can make use\nof this interest rate risk exposure data.\nThe third strand is about the quantification of different components of the net interest\nmargin. Memmel (2011) performs this quantification for the German banks' term\ntransformation. While we make use of the same technique, we quantify all components\nof the net interest margin, not only the term transformation. Costa and Nakane (2005)\nprovide a quantitative decomposition of Brazilian banks' lending spread, i.e. the\ndifference between the loan rate and a maturity equivalent swap rate. They concentrate\non the modeling of the administrative costs related to loan granting. By contrast, we try\nto extract the entire costs associated with a bank's interest income-generating activities,\nespecially the costs of the customers' liquidity and payment management. In addition,\nthe authors neglect \u00ad by definition \u00ad the contribution of term transformation (because\nthis component is not included in the lending spread), and model the costs due to loan\nlosses in a rather elementary way. For Macedonia, Georgievska, Kabashi, and Manova-\nTrajkovska (2011) examine the difference between a bank's lending rate and its deposit\nrate, which is close in economic terms to the net interest margin. They quantitatively\ndecompose this difference, but their modeling is rather elementary and they also neglect\nthe role played by term transformation. Our contribution is to undertake a thorough\nmodeling of all major components of the banks' net interest income and to use very\nsuitable data sets on German banks.\n3 Decomposing the net interest margin\nIn this section, we explain how we measure the costs and earnings of the various\nintermediation functions; namely, the bearing of credit risk, term transformation, and\nliquidity and payment management for the customers. In addition, we discuss technical\nadjustments of the net interest margin.\nWe can divide the cost of bearing credit risk into two components. The first consists of\nthe expected losses in the credit portfolio. The second is the premium for bearing this\nrisk.\nWe assume that the expected loss rate of a loan depends on the loan's initial maturity\nand the industry of the borrower. We further assume that the expected loss rates are\ntime-dependent and that a bank uses the then prevailing expected loss rates when it sets\nthe rates that it charges for newly granted loans. Therefore, the contribution to a bank's\nnet interest margin that covers the expected losses in the bank's credit portfolio is a\nweighted average of past and current expected loss rates for different maturities and\nindustries. For the estimation of this contribution, we divide a bank's credit portfolio\ninto different industries and maturity brackets. The breakdown is such that we can\noptimally use the information included in the Bundesbank's borrowers statistics (See\nSection 4). Let\n, ,\nt j k\n be the expected credit loss rates in time t for industry 1,...,28\nj \nk  and let\n, , ,\nt i j k\nw be the corresponding weights in the credit\nportfolio of bank i . Given the expected losses in the credit portfolio are fully taken into\naccount when loan rates are set, the contribution to a bank's net interest income due to\nexpected losses (in euro) in the credit portfolio\n,\n( )\nt i\nE L of bank i in time t can then be\nexpressed as\n( )\nt i t i t i j t j t i j l t l j t i j l t l j\nj j l j l\nE L loan w h w h w h\n  \n \n    \n \n   \n         \n \n   \n   \n \nwhere\n,\nt i\nloan is the bank's credit volume in time t and\n,\nl k\nh is a function to weigh the\ncurrent ( 0\nl  ) and past ( 0\nl  ) expected loss rates making use of the information about\nthe loans' different initial maturities (See the section A.1 in the appendix and Table 1).2\nThe first maturity bracket ( 1\nk  ) encompasses the loans with an initial maturity of up to\none year, the second bracket those with an initial maturity of more than one and up to\nfive years, and the third bracket contains loans with an initial maturity of more than five\nyears, where we assume, for reasons of data availability, that there is no loan with an\ninitial maturity of more than eight years. The expected credit loss rates\n, ,\nt j k\n are\nestimated as the three-year average of the actual corresponding nationwide loss rates.\nWe use a three year horizon (instead of the loss rate in a given year) to reduce the noise\nin the estimation.\n2 Bolt, de Haan, Hoeberichts, van Oordt, and Swank (2012) also model the banks' net interest margin as a\nfunction of past and current interest rates and expected loss rates. However, their dataset is much less\ngranular (no maturity breakdown and no industry breakdown), so that they have to strongly rely on\nsimplifying assumptions.\nMaturity\nbracket k\nFunction\n,\nl k\nh with time passed l (in years)\nMore than 1 y\nup to 5 ys\nMore than 5\nys\nTable 1: Weights of past and current expected credit loss rates, calculated with yearly\naverages. See the appendix for the derivation of the weighting function\n,\nl k\nh and Equation\nSo far, we have only estimated the expected losses in the credit portfolio. However,\nwhen a bank prices a loan, not only do the expected losses have to be covered, the bank\nalso needs to earn a risk premium. We assume that this risk premium\n,\nt i\n is proportional\nto the expected losses,3 i.e.\n \n,\n,\n,\n  t i\nt i\nt i\nloan\nWe estimate the factor  with the following regression:\n, , , ,\n'\nt i t i t i t i\n    \nwhere\n,\nt i\nNIM is the net interest margin (net interest income over total assets),\n, , ,\n: ( ) /\nt i t i t i\n  is the expected losses in the credit portfolio over total assets, and\n,\nt i\nx\nis a vector of bank-specific characteristics. This vector\n,\nt i\nx includes all the other\nvariables that we use to explain a bank's net interest margin, that means the\ncontributions from the bond portfolio (as explained below in this subsection), from term\ntransformation (Subsection 3.2), from the payment and liquidity management\n(Subsection 3.3) and from the other components (Subsection 3.4). The factor  is equal\nto the coefficient  if one is subtracted. The euro amount for expected losses in the\ncredit portfolio and the corresponding risk premium is then computed as\n \n, ,\n^\nt i t i\nCredit E L\n\n3 If we interpret the risk premium as a contribution to the unexpected loss in the Basel formula, the\nrelationship between the probability of default (a measure for the expected losses) and the unexpected\nlosses are not linear, but strictly monotonic increasing. In this context, Equation (2) can be seen as an\napproximation.\nIn addition, banks hold bonds as well. Here, we use a bank's holdings of bonds issued\nby non-banks multiplied by the bonds' premium over the yield of government debt. By\ncontrast, we neglect the credit risk contribution stemming from government bonds (and\nloans). We do so, because we use the yield of government bonds as our benchmark for\nrisk-free assets. Furthermore, for most banks, the positions in government bonds and\nloans tend to be minor ones, which means there is hardly any difference in our results in\nterms of whether we use zero or any other reasonable credit risk premium for\ngovernment bonds.\n3.2 Term transformation\nA bank's earnings from term transformation cannot be observed directly. There is no\nsuch item in the bank's financial statement, unlike, say, write-downs in the credit\nportfolio. However, banks in Germany have to report their exposure to interest rate risk\nin the banking book, and we use this information to gauge a bank's earnings from term\ntransformation, as done in Memmel (2011). His idea was to investigate a passive trading\nstrategy in risk-free government bonds with the same interest rate risk exposure as the\nbank under consideration. Under the assumption that the same risk exposure yields the\nsame return, the net interest income of this passive trading strategy will be equal to the\nbanks' earnings from term transformation. The benchmark models (See, for instance,\nFama and French, 1992, and Carhart, 1997) for the stock market state that the expected\nreturn of a share, not the actual return, is the same if the share has the same exposures to\nthe risk factors. By contrast, in our paper, we assume that the actual return is the same.\nWe believe that this is justified, because the returns of bond portfolios (of the same\ncurrency and without default risk) are much more highly correlated than the returns of\nstock portfolios.\nThe passive trading strategy consists in revolvingly investing in 10-year par yield\nbonds, where this position is funded by revolvingly issuing 1-year par yield bonds. Our\ntimely discretion is at monthly intervals. This means that, each month, a 10-year bond\nthat was issued ten years ago at par comes due and the sum is then reinvested in the 10-\nyear bond that is now issued at par. The interest payments of the different bonds are\ncollected during one year and constitute the interest income of the strategy.\nAccordingly, the interest expenses of the passive trading strategy consist of the interest\npayments on the 1-year bond. The euro amount of the passive trading strategy is not\nrelevant for our purposes, but for the ease of exposition, we assume that its volume is\nLet\n,i\nBPV\nand ( )\nbe the basis point value, i.e. the loss in euros in the case of a\none basis point parallel shift of the term structure, for bank i and the passive trading\nstrategy, respectively, at the end of month  and let ( )\nNi TS \nbe the net income (in euro)\nof the passive trading strategy in month  , then our estimate\n,\nt i\nTerm for the earnings\nfrom term transformation (in euro) of bank i in year t are\n,\n,\n( )\n( )\nt\ni\nt i\nt\nBPV\nTerm Ni TS\n\n\n \n\n  \n \nFor scaling purposes, the measure\n,\nt i\nTerm is divided by either the bank's total assets\n(\n,\nt i\nTA ) or its net interest income (\n,\nt i\nNi ).\n3.3 Liquidity and payment management for the customers\nAs stated above, banks perform liquidity and payment management for their customers.\nPerforming such a function causes costs for bank branches and staff. We assume that, at\nleast in the long run, these costs are covered by corresponding earnings, for instance by\nmark-ups on loans or by reduced bank rates for customer deposits. A bank's profits and\nloss account has a position on administrative costs, which comprise personnel costs as\nwell as other administrative costs, such as depreciations on fixed assets and\namortizations on intangible assets. However, these costs include not only costs that\nresult from interest generating activities, but also costs from fee and trading business. In\norder to extract the portion of operating costs which arise from liquidity and payment\nmanagement, we adopt two approaches and compare the outcome for robustness\nreasons.\nIn the first specification (Equation (6)), we explain a bank's operating costs by different\nsources of income, namely interest income and fee income. In doing so, we estimate the\nt i t i i t t i t i\n    \n         (6)\nwith\n,\nt i\nOC as operating cost relative to total assets,\n,\nt i\nNIM as the net interest margin and\n,\nt i\nFEE as income from fees and commissions over total assets. We conduct a panel\nregression with bank-fixed effects in order to control for unobservable heterogeneity.4 A\ntime trend variable ( T ) accounts for technological changes which affect cost\ndevelopment. We expect  to be negative, since costs have been declining through the\nobserved period. Income shares are considered as proxies for outputs in interest-\ngenerating and fee-income-generating activities. In doing so, we divide operating costs\ninto three parts: a part which is directly associated with interest income, a part which is\ncaused by running fee-income business, and a residual which contains fixed costs and\ncosts stemming from other income sources, e.g. trading income. To be more precise,\nvariable costs directly related to net interest income are calculated as\n^\nt i\nNIM\n  .\nIn the function above we do not consider trading income explicitly as an output\ncomponent, since this income source is very volatile and often takes on negative values.\nTherefore, the appropriateness of net trading income as a proxy for the extent of trading\nactivities may be limited. As we use fixed-effects regressions, we do not assume\nserious problems due to omitted variable bias. In order to test the appropriateness of this\nassumption, we run a robustness check, where we introduce a variable which covers\nother income components (i.e. it covers trading income and other non-interest income),\nto total assets. As\n,\nt i\nTRADE often takes on negative values, we only consider cases where\nthis variable is positive.\nIn the second specification, we take a more detailed view as we use concrete amounts of\ndifferent outputs (instead of the whole net interest income) to describe costs caused by\nthe banks' liquidity and payment management for their customers. Again, we run fixed-\nt i t i t i t i\nt i t i t i i t i\n   \n   \n      \n       \nCARDS is the number of cards (credit cards, cards with a cash function, with a payment\nfunction as well as with an e-money function) a bank hands out to its customers per\n100,000  of total assets. The variable TRANSACTIONS is defined as the number of\npayment actions taken at the cashiers' desk per 100 of total assets. This variable serves\nas a proxy for personal customer service. If a bank focuses more on face-to-face service\nrather than on providing its services via internet and terminals it is expected to face\n4 We prefer fixed effects to random effects, since the Hausman test has shown systematic differences\nbetween coefficients, indicating inconsistency of the coefficients in the random effects specification.\nhigher administrative costs. We also introduce the amount of automated teller machines\nper 100.000 of total assets. CREDITS comprise customer loans (as a percentage of\ntotal assets) as a variable to account for the costs emerging within the loan granting\nprocess (e.g. consultancy, monitoring, management and, if the loan engagement fails,\nliquidation). This type of costs has also to be covered by net interest income.\nFurthermore, we introduce SECURITIES (as a percentage of total assets) as a further\noutput.5 As in Equation (6), we include the variable FEE because fee-income generating\nactivities are expected to cause further administrative costs.6 We also perform a further\nregression, where TRANSACTIONS are separated into whether money is paid in\n(PAYMENT-IN) or paid out (PAYMENT-OUT). The reason for this is that paying in\ncould be assumed as more laborious than paying out, and therefore causes higher costs.\nWe furthermore introduce a time trend as in Equation (6). In a further specification we\ntest whether there is a significant interaction between TRANSACTIONS and fee-income.\nSince fee-income generating activities (e.g. selling building savings contracts and\ninsurances) normally require a certain amount of personal service, a bank which is\nalready focused on personal service (e.g. a bank that carries out customers' transaction\nat the counter) may gain synergies by offering additional fee-products. From Equation\n(7), operating costs for providing liquidity and payment management (\n,\n_\nt i\nOC PLM ) are\ncalculated in our paper as:\n^ ^ ^ ^\n_\nt i t i t i t i t i\n   \n        (8)\n3.4 Other components\nThere are further components determining banks' interest margins, such as market\npower and inequality of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. In the interest margin\nliterature, which explains interest margins in a qualitative context, proxies like\nconcentration ratios or Lerner indices are often used in order to account for market\npower (e.g. Maudos and Sol\u00eds, 2009; Lepetit, Nys, Rous, and Tarazi, 2008; Maudos and\nFern\u00e1ndez de Guevara, 2004). Measuring the quantitative part due to market power\nseems to be rather difficult. One useful attempt to do this might be to interpret the\n5 Customer loans and securities are often proposed as bank outputs by the literature on cost efficiency.\nSee, for example, Fiorentino, Karmann, and Koetter (2006), Koetter and Poghosyan (2009), Bos, Heid,\nfraction due to market power as the difference between the identified components and\nthe actual value of the interest margin. Our calculations indicate little space for market\npower margins. At this point it has to be mentioned that small markups could also be\ndue to cost and profit inefficiencies rather than reflecting little market power. Thus,\nbanks with market power could suffer from inefficiencies instead of reaping\nmonopolistic rents (see Koetter, Kolari, and Spierdijk, 2012; Koetter and Vins 2008).\nParticularly when bank fixed effects in the equations for the liquidity and payment\nmanagement (Equations (6) and (7)) do not fully cover cost-inefficient deviations from\nthe cost function, part of the estimated magnitude of operative costs could reflect market\npower induced cost-inefficiencies. However, from our point of view, a rather small\nmarket power margin does not seem to be implausible. First, we assume that\ncompetition in the banking market has increased due to the expansion of direct banks,\nnon-banks and near-banks. Second, it would be expected that small rural banks, in\nparticular, face low competition and, therefore, benefit in terms of higher margins. But\nthis argument is myopic, since savings and cooperative banks, which are located mainly\nin rural regions, are committed to supporting common public interests, rather than to\nfocusing on profit maximization.\nThere are also technical issues related to interest margin calculation. We calculate the\nnet interest margin by subtracting interest expenses from gross interest income and\ndivide it by the banks' total assets. This procedure is appropriate when interest-bearing\nliabilities equal interest-bearing assets. The net interest margin would however be\noverestimated if interest-bearing assets were to exceed interest-bearing liabilities. We\ntherefore calculate a variable \"Other\". We assume that a bank obtains its residual\nfunding or invests its surpluses at the interbank market. The contribution to the net\ninterest margin is therefore calculated as\n, ,\n,\n,\n( ) ( )\n\n  t i t i\nt i t\nt i\nq A q L\nOther month rate\nTA\nwhere 3-month-ratet\nis the 3-month-Euribor,\n,\nt i\nTA are the total assets and\n,\n( )\nt i\nq A and\n,\n( )\nt i\nq L are interest bearing assets and liabilities, respectively. Note that the difference\nbetween interest bearing assets and liabilities may stem from a bank's capital (which in\nmost parts does not count to the interest bearing liabilities). The assumption that a bank\nborrows or lends the difference in the volumes at the interbank market is a technical\nassumption to equalize interest bearing assets and liabilities. We neglect price effects\nthat arise due to the assumed change in the liability structure.\nAnother issue that has become especially relevant during the recent low interest rate\nenvironment is that deposit rates normally take positive values. When market interest\nrates decrease, banks would normally adjust their loan rates as well as their deposits\nrates. If the market interest rate level has fallen below a certain threshold, deposit rates\ncannot be adjusted in the expected dimension (due to, for instance, the lower bound of\nzero concerning deposit rates), thereby causing a decline in the actual net interest\nmargin. This aspect could contribute to a situation in which the sum of the calculated\ncomponents (credit risk compensation, term transformation, liquidity and payment\nmanagement costs, and other components) exceeds the actual net interest margin.\nFor our analysis, we use regulatory data for banks in Germany. Apart from the banks'\nfinancial statements (balance sheet, profit and loss accounts), we have quantitative\nsupervisory reports for each bank and each year at our disposal. From these data sets,\nwe take the elementary information about the banks; for instance, their total assets, their\noperating costs, their net fee income, and their net interest income. This data is available\non an annual basis. For our panel regression in section 3.3, we use data from 1993 till\n2012. In order to get more detailed information about the payments services a bank\nprovides to its customers we use the payment statistics. This database contains yearly-\nbased information about payment transactions in the German banking system and is\navailable from 2008 till 2012. We use data on the amount of cards a bank hands out to\nits customers (i.e. credit cards, cards with a cash function, with a payment function as\nwell as with an e-money function), the amounts of payments carried at a cashier's desk\nand the number of automated teller machines (ATMs) a bank reports.7 We apply a\nrelatively moderate outlier treatment, in which we truncate variables used in the\nEquations (6) and (7) by banking group (i.e. savings, cooperatives, small commercials,\nand large banks)8 at the 1st and 99th percentile. We furthermore account for mergers, as\n7 Some banks, most of them regional banks, did not report the numbers of ATMs, cards and transaction,\nwhich we have treated as missing values.\n8 Large banks comprise \"Landesbanken\", \"big banks\" and central cooperative institutions. We choose this\ngrouping, because individual groups differ in their income ratios due to differences in business models.\nthe banks that have resulted from the mergers are usually substantially different from\nthe pre-merger banks. In Tables 7 to 10 in the appendix, we provide summary statistics.\nFor determining a bank's exposure to credit risk, we make use of the Bundesbank's\nborrowers statistics and BISTA statistics. In this data set, the German banks' loan\nexposure to the real economy is broken down into 28 different industries/sectors and\nthree maturity brackets. The 28 industries/sectors consist of 23 industries in the German\nreal economy (excluding government), three types of loans to German households, the\nsector of German non-profit organizations, and foreign non-banking firms and\nhouseholds (excluding government).9 The data is further broken down according to the\nloans' initial maturity (three brackets: up to one year, more than one and up to five\nyears, more than five years). This data set not only includes the loan volume, but its\nvaluation changes as well, which allows us to calculate loss rates.\nConcerning the banks' exposure to interest rate risk, we make use of the Basel interest\nrate coefficient. This coefficient states the change in the present value of a bank's\nbanking book due to a standardized shock of the term structure of interest rates relative\nto the banks regulatory capital. In the past, this shock consisted of a parallel shift in the\nterm structure of +130 basis points. Since 2011, the amount of the parallel shift has been\nset to +200 basis points. To derive a bank's banking book basis point value\n,i\nBVP\n\n, we\ndivide its Basel interest rate coefficient by 130 and 200, respectively, making use of the\nnear linear relationship of the interest rate risk for relatively small shocks, and multiply\nit by the bank's capital. In accordance with Memmel (2011), we set the basis point\nvalue of the passive trading strategy ( )\n9 To make the manuscript easier to read, we write \"industries\" instead of \"industries/sectors\".\n10 The basis point value of the passive trading strategy, i.e. a measure for its interest rate risk, varies in the\ncourse of time, depending on the level of interest rates. However, these variations are small and tend to be\nnegligible.\nFigure 1: Net income (as an annual percentage) of a passive trading strategy that\nconsists in revolvingly investing in 10-year German par-yield government bonds and\nrevolvingly issuing one-year par-yield bonds.\nThe net income of the passive trading strategy is based on estimates of the term\nstructure of German government bonds, carried out by the Deutsche Bundesbank (See\nEarnings\nrelative\nto...\nCredit\nrisk\nTerm\ntransformation\nLiquidity/Payment\nfunction\nOther Sum\n...total\nassets (in\nbp per\nyear)\npercentile\npercentile\n...net\ninterest\nincome\n(in %)\npercentile\npercentile\nTable 2: Remuneration of the different functions of banks in 2012; bp = basis points; n\n= 1545; \"Credit risk\" is the sum of the expected losses and a premium for the bank's\ncredit risk in its loan portfolio (See Equation (4)) plus the contribution of its bond\nholdings; \"Term transformation\" is the return of a passive trading strategy scaled by the\nbank's interest rate risk exposure (See Equation (5)); \"Liquidity/Payment function\":\nvariable costs from liquidity and payment management (See Equation (7)); \"Other\":\ncontribution to the net interest margin due to the difference between the volume of\ninterest bearing assets and liabilities (See Equation (9)).\nIn Figure 1, we show the yearly net income of this strategy since 1983, the first year for\nwhich we can calculate the net income.

First, the steepness of the term\nstructure (the yield of a 10-year par yield bond minus the yield of a 1-year par yield\nSecond, the passive trading strategy benefits from the higher coupons of past 10-year\npar yield bonds.\n5 Empirical Results\n5.1 Quantifying the components\nIn Table 2, the results for the quantification of the different components are shown. The\nresults are given for 2012 as the median relative to total assets (per year) and net interest\nincome, respectively. We can only carry out the break-down for the year 2012 because,\nfor the credit risk, we need a time series to estimate the contribution to the net interest\nmargin as a weighted average of past and present credit loss rates (see Equation (1)).\nThe data set on credit loss rates only started in 2003 and we use this period of ten years\nto estimate the contribution of bearing credit risk for the year 2012.\nWe can derive the following conclusions. First, the component that reflects the costs of\nthe clients' liquidity and payment management is the most important, followed by the\ncomponent for term transformation and credit risk. In 2012, for the median bank, the\ncosts of liquidity and payment management account for 47% of the net interest income\nand 104 bp per total assets. The relevant figures for term transformation and credit risk\nare 35% and 16% of net interest income, and 77 bp and 34 bp relative to total assets,\nrespectively.\nOperating costs over total assets (OC)\nSpecification\nI-a\nSpecification\nI-b\nSpecification\nI-c\nSpecification\nI-d\nNIM\nFEE\nTRADE\nTrend\nConstant\nWald-test\n,\np-value\n,\np-value\n,\np-value\nTable 3: Decomposition of operating expenses, Specification I: Explaining operating\ncosts by income streams (1993-2012). Robust standard errors in parentheses. ***, **, *\ndenote significance on a 1 percent, 5 percent or 10 percent level, respectively. See\nEquation (6).\nSecond, when calculating operating costs that arise from liquidity and payment\nmanagement, specification I (Table 3) gives us a first hint about the range of the cost\nshare which has to be covered by interest margin. Specifications I-a to I-d suggest that,\non average, about 47% to 52% of net interest margin corresponds to administrative\ncosts. This finding is confirmed by specification II-b (Table 4), which makes it possible\nto calculate the operating costs stemming from liquidity and payment management as\n47% of net interest margin in the median in 2012 and as 49% in the median for the\nFigure 2: Banks' operative costs for the liquidity and payment management of their\nhas been dropped.\nFurthermore, we interpret the coefficients in specification II directly as cost unit rates.\nAccording to these estimates, a card causes average costs of 80 per year, whereas an\nadditional ATM costs, on average, costs 64,000 (including depreciations). As expected,\nPAYMENTS-IN are, on average, associated with higher costs per transaction than\nPAYMENTS-OUT. The coefficient on FEE reflects the relatively high personnel costs\nconnected with fee products: For every 100 fee income, 32 operating costs are\nincurred. Our calculations show that operating costs for securities are negligible, while\nconsumer loans cause 5 administrative costs per 1,000 customer loan. In both\nspecifications, administrative costs are not significantly influenced by time trend.12\nSpecification II-d in Table 4 shows no evidence for synergy effects between fee-income\n11 We rely on specification II-b in order to calculate operating expenses for the provision of liquidity and\npayment management, as time trend and interaction term do not play a significant role, but the\ndifferentiation between PAYMENTS-IN and PAYMENTS-OUT does provide further information.\n12 This could be due to a short time horizon.

See Equation (7).\nThird, the component for term transformation seems very high, i.e. roughly one-third of\nthe median bank's net interest margin comes from this source. When we look at\nTable 5, we see that this component is rather volatile in the course of time and that the\nyear 2012 shows very high term transformation figures. The median contribution of this\npoints per total assets and year, and 20% of the net interest margin, whereas the\nand 13% of the net interest margin.\nYear(s)\nRelative to total assets\nand per year (in bp)\nRelative to net interest income\n(in %)\nTable 5: Earnings from term transformation; bp = basis points; median bank; the\nearnings are calculated as stated in Equation (5).\nFourth, earnings due to bearing credit risk seem rather low at 16% of the net interest\nmargin, all the more so since not only the loans' expected losses are accounted for, but a\nrisk premium as well (as estimated in Equation (3)). One reason for the rather low\ncontribution of bearing credit risk is due to the fact that the year 2012, for which we\ncarry out the break-down of the net interest margin, was characterized by very low loss\nrates in the credit portfolio. As stated in Equation (1), the contribution for bearing credit\nrisk is a weighted average of past and present credit loss rates. However, the years 2010\nto 2012 which were characterized by low loss rates, have a large weight in the portfolio\ncomposition, so that the low contribution need not to be representative for a whole\nbusiness cycle (See Memmel et al., 2014, Figure 1, for a graphical representation of the\ncredit loss rate in Germany in the course of time). Another issue is the credit risk\npremium. If we dropped this risk premium altogether (as suggested by the regression\nresults for Equation (3) in the first column in Table 6), the contribution of bearing credit\nrisk would be even lower (12%). Instead, we take the results of the single variable\nregression (second column in Table 6), where the coefficient for the expected losses in\nthe credit portfolio is 1.363 (implying a risk premium of 36.3%). We do so, because the\nvariable for the payment and liquidity management includes administrative costs for the\nloan granting, which may lead to biases in the estimates. An example may explain this:\nAssume a bank grants a risky loan. For this loan, the probability of default and,\ntherefore, ceteris paribus the expected losses are higher. At the same time, this loan has\na higher-than-average probability that costly renegotiations and liquidations are\nnecessary, which increases the administrative costs above the average.\nFifth, the component due to the difference between interest bearing assets and liabilities\namounts to around 2 basis points, which corresponds to less than 1% of a the median\nbank's net interest margin. The amount seems relatively small, but one has to take into\naccount that the average 3-month interbank rate was relatively low (0.57% p.a.) in 2012.\nSixth, the sum of the four components accounts for nearly 100% of the median bank's\nnet interest income. This finding is in line with the empirical results of Georgievska et al\n(2011), who find that the sum of the components even exceeds the banks' net interest\nincome by up to 20%. The question is why there is so little left from the interest income\nto cover the banks' fixed costs or to contribute to the remuneration of the banks' equity.\nOne possible answer could be that some of the costs are not associated with a\ncorresponding money outflow. As long as a bank sets its loan rates such that the\nexpected losses are covered, the money inflow \u00ad on average \u00ad is equal to or exceeds the\nmoney outflow. However, if a bank invests in bonds, it receives interest that covers the\nexpected losses and it receives \u00ad on top of this \u00ad a credit risk premium, i.e. the costs we\nderive are, at least in part, opportunity costs. Another possible explanation may be a\nprice setting across different sources of income. For instance, liquidity and payment\nmanagement is financed by low remuneration of current accounts, but there may also be\nfees associated with, say, the current accounts.\n5.2 Justification of the decomposition\nAs stated earlier, the results of the decomposition of a bank's net interest margin are not\nright or wrong. There are no items in the profit and loss account about the exact\ndecomposition. If we define, for instance, earnings from term transformation as the\nincome of a passive trading strategy with the same interest rate risk, then we can only\nmake a point that the calculation is economically sensible or not. To do so, we explain\nthe bank's actual net interest margin by the components we derived.\nNet interest margin (NIM)\nExpected credit\nlosses\nCorporate bonds\nTerm\ntransformation\nLiquidity and\nPayment Costs\nOther\nConstant\nWald-test, p-value:\nExpected credit losses\nCorporate Bonds\nTerm Transformation\nL&P Costs\nOther\nTable 6: Explanation of the net interest margin for 2012, using cross-sectional\nregressions. Robust standard errors in parentheses. ***, **, * denote significance on a 1\npercent, 5 percent or 10 percent level, respectively; \"Expected credit losses\" are the\nexpected losses in a bank's credit portfolio as stated in Equation (1); \"Corporate bonds\"\nis the contribution to a bank's net interest margin stemming from its bond holdings; for\nthe other variable definitions see Table 2. All variables are divided by the banks' total\nassets.\nIn Table 6, we show to what extent the different components can explain the banks' net\ninterest margin. We estimate the relationship as laid down in Equation (3), but only in\nthe cross-section for the year 2012, not as a panel. As explained above, we can only\ndetermine the contribution of bearing credit risk for the year 2012, because we need a\ntime series of ten years (which correspond to the period of available data) to estimate\nthe contribution in the tenth year. We see the following results. First, the expected\nlosses in a bank's credit portfolio have an impact on the net interest margin of less than\none, at least in the specification where all variables are included. For the reason outlined\nabove, we choose the single variable regression (second column in Table 6); here the\ncoefficient is 1.363. However, we have to admit that this coefficient is only estimated\nwith relatively low precision and that it is not statistically significantly greater than one.\nThis said, we interpret the difference to one as the premium for bearing credit risk. This\nrisk premium is estimated to be about 36% of the expected credit losses.\nThe composition of the credit portfolio explains about 6.1% of the cross-sectional\nvariation of the banks' net interest margin. Second, the corporate bonds' credit risk\npremium (including the expected losses) explains 3.6% of this variation. What is more,\nthe coefficient is close to one, the theoretical value. Third, the component for the term\ntransformation is \u00ad as all the components \u00ad highly significantly positive, but this\ncomponent is significantly different from one. Memmel (2011) showed that the cross-\nsectional explanatory power of this variable is relatively low. Therefore, we run a fixed-\neffects panel regression (results available on request) to see whether the time series\nestimate of the coefficient is not statistically different from one. The time series estimate\nis highly significantly positive and greater than the cross-sectional coefficient, but still\nsignificantly smaller than one.\nFourth, costs for the clients' liquidity and the payment management explain nearly 23%\nof total variation, which illustrates the importance of this component. The coefficient is\nrelatively close to one, although statistical equality to one is rejected. Concerning\noperating costs, we furthermore run tests to justify the appropriateness of the chosen\ncost function estimated in Section 3.3 in Equation (6) and (7). In specification I-a to I-d\nwe interpret\n as the variable unit costs stemming from interest-generating activities.\nAs we assume a linear relationship between operating costs and the income\ncomponents, variable unit costs correspond to marginal costs. From a theoretical point\nof view, cost minimization of products measured in the same unit (here: euros of\noperating income) requires equal marginal costs in the different product lines. Under the\nassumption that banks minimize costs, the rejection of the equality of the marginal\ncosts, i.e.\n:\nH  \n , would give us a sign for misspecification. The corresponding\ntests are reported in Table 3 and we see that the coefficients are not statistically\ndifferent.\nWe also obtain indications that these coefficients do not suffer from omitted variables.\nTable 3 indicates that coefficients remain stable when introducing the trading income\n(TRADE). We have also tested the equality of the coefficients in this specification. The\nequality of the coefficients is only rejected when comparing the coefficient for the\nvariable TRADE and net interest income. One possible explanation could be that the\ncoefficient for other income sources may be overestimated, since we have ignored\nnegative values. Furthermore, for multicollinearity reasons, we abstain from accounting\nfor non-linearity in both specifications in terms of introducing squared terms. 13\nComparing specification I and II, specification II seems more advantageous, because, in\nthis approach, a bank's operating costs can be explained by economically meaningful\nvariables that have roughly the same explanatory power as the variables in specification\nI. We use specification II-b in order to calculate the specific costs, as the differentiation\nbetween PAYMENTS-IN and PAYMENTS-OUT seems useful, although the inclusion of\na time trend and the interaction term do not provide any further information.\nAll in all, there is evidence that the components for credit risk, term transformation, and\nliquidity and payment management for the customers are sensibly chosen.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper is about quantifying the components of the banks' net interest margin. The\nresults have several implications. First, the liquidity and payment management for the\nbanks' clients need to be more in the focus of research. Issues like technical progress in\nthe payment management and other efficiency gains could be explored in more detail.\nSecond, stress tests on the banks' net interest margin should take into account the\ncomponent of liquidity and payment management for their customers. Up to now, such\n13 Correlations between variables and their squared terms in specification I and specification II are about\nstress tests have focused mainly on the banks' credit and interest rate risk. Third, there\nis a contribution to the question of which part of the banks' net interest margin is due to\nfunctions that banks perform with an advantage over other market participants. There is\nlittle doubt that banks have an advantage in carrying out liquidity and payment\nmanagement for their customers and the same holds true for the banks' loan granting\nbusiness. Concerning term transformation, especially the interest rate risk, which\naccounts for up to one-third of the median bank's net interest margin, the literature says\nthat banks have only limited advantages in bearing this risk. That is to say, banks could\nhand over their interest rate risk to the markets by means of appropriate positions in\ninterest swaps and no problems seem to arise from information asymmetries or wrong\nincentives. The same is true of their bond positions.\nIn this paper, we investigate the German banking system. German banks are said to rely\ngreatly on earnings from term transformation. Nevertheless, there is reason to believe\nthat the large share of the net interest margin that is due to cost and earnings\nmanagement is a feature that is common to banking systems in many countries.\nReferences\nAngbazo, L.
