A transvagi-\nnal probe was first used to evaluate the\nanal sphincter were defined using a transva-\nAlthough TL-US is used widely for the\ndetection of sphincter defects after birth,\nthe effect of the delivery method on the anal\nsphincter immediately after birth has not\nbeen studied.\nThis present study evaluated the effects of\nvaginal and caesarean delivery on internal\nand external anal sphincter measurements\nusing TL-US with a vaginal probe in nul-\nliparous women.\nPatients and methods\nPatient population\nThis prospective cohort study enrolled con-\nsecutive healthy nulliparous women at term\npregnancy (gestational age of !37 weeks)\nwho attended the Labour Unit, Etlik\nZu\n\u00a8 beyde Hanim Women's Health Teaching\nand Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey\nin order to give birth. Nulliparous women\nwho underwent caesarean section as a result\nof obstetric or medical indications, without\nentering active labour, were recruited to\nthe caesarean delivery group during the\nsame time period. The exclusion criteria\nfor the vaginal delivery group were:\n(i) women who were delivered with vacuum\nor forceps; (ii) women who developed third-\nor fourth-degree lacerations during delivery;\n(iii) women with sphincter interruption on\npostpartum TL-US, with muscle interrup-\ntion being defined as a complete discontinu-\nity in the muscle at a given location. The\nfollowing demographic and clinical charac-\nteristics were recorded for each study par-\nticipant: maternal age, body mass index,\nweight gain during pregnancy, gestational\nage of baby and birth weight of baby.\nThe study was approved by the Local\nEthics Committee of Etlik Zu\n\u00a8 beyde Hanim\nWomen's Health Teaching and Research\nto the Declaration of Helsinki. All women\nwere informed of the study's purpose and\nprotocol and each study participant provided\nwritten informed consent.\nAnal sphincter muscle thickness\nmeasurements\nThe hypoechoic internal anal sphincter\n(IAS) and hyperechoic external anal sphinc-\nter (EAS) thicknesses were measured at\ndistal level as described previously.9 The\nanal sphincters were first measured prior to\ndelivery (prepartum): at the beginning of the\nlabour for the vaginal delivery group (with\ncervical dilatation of 4 cm with regular\ncontractions or with rupture of the mem-\nbranes); and at the time of admission for\nthe caesarean delivery group (Figure 1).\nThe anal sphincter measurements were\nrepeated postpartum at 24\u00ad48 h after deliv-\nery for both groups (Figure 2).\nExaminations were performed in the lith-\notomy position. A single operator (D.K.)\nperformed the TL-US examinations, both\nprepartum and postpartum. Ultrasound was\nperformed using an GE LOGIQTM P5 ultra-\nsound machine (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee,\nFigure 2.

Then the transducer was\nrotated 90 and an axial image of the distal\nanal sphincters was obtained at the level of\nthe mucosal star sign.9 Measurements in the\ntransverse plane included: (i) IAS measure-\nments (hypoechoic part from side to side);\nand (ii) EAS measurements (only circular\nhyperechoic muscular fibres of the EAS from\nside to side). The hammock-like muscle fibres\nof the pubovisceral muscle were not included,\nwhich could be seen passing posteriorly in\nsome patients at this level (Figure 1a & 1b).\nStatistical analyses\nPrevious research and a prior pilot study\nconducted in our clinic revealed a difference\nof 0.5 mm with a standard deviation of 1.3,\nwhich was the baseline hypothesis for the\ndifference between measurements before and\nafter delivery for each sphincter position.10\nUsing these values with a significance level of\npower, the minimum sample size was calcu-\nlated to be 42 for each group.\nAll statistical analyses were performed\nusing the SPSS\u00d5 statistical package, version\n17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5. Categorical variables are pre-\nsented as percentages and continuous\nvariables are presented as mean \u00c6 SD. The\nnormality of the variables was tested using\nthe Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov test. For statis-\ntical analysis, independent samples t-test\nwas used to compare the two groups.\nPaired-samples t-test was used to compare\ntwo sets of measurements prepartum and\npostpartum. A P-value < 0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 105 consecutive nulliparous\nwomen with term pregnancy, 60 in the vagi-\nnal delivery group and 45 in the caesarean\ndelivery group, were enrolled in the study. In\nthe vaginal delivery group, one woman who\nexperienced third- or fourth-degree lacer-\nations during delivery and seven women\nwith sphincter interruption on postpartum\nTL-US were excluded from the analysis,\nwhich left 52 patients in the vaginal delivery\ngroup.\nThe demographic and clinical character-\nistics of the two groups are presented in\nTable 1. There were no significant differ-\nences between the vaginal and caesarean\ndelivery groups in terms of maternal age,\nbody mass index, weight gain during preg-\nnancy, gestational age of the baby and birth\nweight of the baby. All patients in the\nvaginal delivery group had a mediolateral\nepisiotomy.\nTable 1.

This present\nstudy undertook TL-US imaging before and\nafter delivery in vaginal and caesarean\ndelivery groups in order to be able to\ncompare the impact of delivery type on\nanal sphincter anatomy. Normal muscle\nthickness values for anal sphincters at the\nend of pregnancy and immediately after\ndelivery are lacking. The IAS muscle thick-\nafter caesarean delivery. The EAS muscle\nafter vaginal delivery and from 2.23 to\n3.02 mm after caesarean delivery.\nPrevious research has waited at least\n6 weeks after birth before measuring anal\nsphincter muscles,6 but this present study\naimed to detect occult sphincter injury early\nand exclude these women before healing had\nbeen accomplished. However, the present\nresults may have been affected by early\ninflammation secondary to delivery. A pre-\nvious study evaluated normal TL-US anal\nsphincter complex measurements of women\nat 6 months after both vaginal and caesar-\nean deliveries.10 The study showed that IAS\nmeasurements at the 12 o'clock position,\nboth proximally and distally, were signifi-\ncantly thicker for caesarean delivery patients\ncompared with vaginal delivery patients.10\nThe present IES data were found to be\nbut the EAS measurements were thinner\nthan previous measurements made in both\nFor example, the EAS thickness measure-\nments ranged from 5.6 to 6.6 mm in preg-\nnant women examined using endoanal\nutrasonography.14 The difference in EAS\nthickness between studies probably depends\non the imaging technique used, because the\nmethod used in the present study only\nmeasured the circular hyperechoic muscle\nfibres of the EAS from side to side and it did\nnot include the hammock-like muscle fibres\nof the pubovisceral muscle, which could be\nseen passing posteriorly in some patients at\nthis level. The present EAS thickness values\nwere similar to those previously measured\nusing magnetic resonance imaging.15\nThe anal sphincter is composed of an\ninvoluntary inner smooth-muscle compo-\nnent (the internal anal sphincter) and a\nvoluntary striated muscle component (the\nexternal anal sphincter). The most common\ncause of sphincter damage is vaginal deliv-\nery,2,4 therefore most of the patients who\nneed anal sphincter investigations are\nwomen. Endoanal ultrasound is currently\nthe gold standard for sphincter evaluation,\nbut vaginal ultrasound has many advan-\ntages in women.16 The use of transvaginal\nultrasound probes is available in almost\nevery obstetrics and gynaecology unit and\nphysicians are familiar and experienced with\nthe vaginal approach. The anus is undis-\nturbed by the insertion of a vaginal probe, so\nexamination of the anal sphincters can be\ndone without deformity from a probe within\nthe canal. This allows the thickness of the\ninternal sphincter and the subepithelial tis-\nsues to be measured in their true resting\nstate. The internal sphincter has been found\nto be a little thicker when a vaginal probe is\nused rather than when it is measured using\nendoanal ultrasonography.8 Although\ndoubts have been raised about the ability\nof transvaginal scanning to accurately detect\nsphincter damage, results of both prospect-\nive and retrospective studies support the use\nof transvaginal ultrasonography as a reliable\nmethod for evaluating the anal sphincter,\nequivalent in accuracy to the endoanal\nProximal thinning after vaginal birth can\nbe defined as sphincter asymmetry and it\nmay be a sign of partial damage. However, it\nhas been suggested that sphincter thinning\nor asymmetry, particularly at the 12 o'clock\nposition, is not a product of birth injury or\nthe mode of delivery.19 Even though the\nanterior (12 o'clock position) sphincter\nmuscles were thinner compared with the\nother three positions before delivery in the\npresent study, further significant sphincter\nthinning of both the IAS and EAS at the 12\no'clock position after delivery was only seen\nin the vaginal delivery group. One of the key\nbenefits of the present study was the fact that\nthe same patients were scanned before and\nafter delivery.\nIn the vaginal delivery group (n \u00bc 60) in\nthe present study, one woman (1.7%)\nexperienced third- or fourth-degree lacer-\nations during delivery and seven women\n(11.7%) experienced occult sphincter inter-\nruption as detected on postpartum TL-US.\nThese eight women were excluded from\nthese analyses. There are very conflicting\nresults in the literature regarding the detec-\ntion rate of postpartum occult sphincter\ninjury as measured by ultrasonography.20,21\nA previous study reported that 28% (42 of\n150) of nulliparous women were diagnosed\nas having occult sphincter tears as measured\nby anal endosonography immediately after\nvaginal birth,11 but a subsequent study by\nthe same authors reported a lower rate of\nThis present study had several limita-\ntions. First, the study included only nul-\nliparous women. This may have increased\nthe need for episiotomy during delivery and\nthe potential effect of episiotomy on anal\nsphincter measurements after delivery has\nnot been eliminated. However, the presence\nof a significant difference only at the\n12 o'clock position was similar to a previous\nstudy performed after 6 months of deliv-\nery,10 which suggests that the effect of\nepisiotomy may have been negligible.\nSecondly, this study used 2D ultrasonog-\nraphy to measure only the distal IAS and\nEAS. Larger studies that use 3D ultrason-\nography to evaluate multiple planes of the\nanal sphincter are recommended.\nIn conclusion, this present study demon-\nstrated significant muscle thinning of both\nthe IAS and EAS at the 12 o'clock position\nafter vaginal delivery, but not after caesar-\nean delivery, as determined by TL-US.\nThese findings may show that the anal\nsphincter is better preserved during caesar-\nean delivery compared with vaginal delivery.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
