Suicide rates have remained stable over the\nproposed by the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention\nto reduce the rate has been to target intervention efforts toward\nsubgroups at the greatest risk, a strategy requiring the identifica-\ntion of reliable biomarkers capable of identifying those at current\nor future risk.2 Previously identified risk factors implicated in\nsuicide include biological or genetic characteristics, early-life\ntrauma, stressful life events, impulsive aggressive traits, psycho-\npathology, inadequate social support, access to lethal means and\nsubstance abuse.3\u00ad5 Recent work by our group and others has\nidentified biomarkers at the epigenetic or gene expression level\ncapable of predicting suicidal behavior from blood.\nPrevious work suggests that epigenetic alterations in the\nspindle and kinetochore-associated protein 2 (SKA2) gene may\nrepresent a promising biomarker for detecting suicidal behaviors.6\nThis study determined that the cytosine, but not the thymine,\nmethylation at this site predicted lower SKA2 expression in the\nfrontal cortex of suicide completers,6 along with lower levels of\nmicroRNA-301a in the cortex of depressed suicide completers.7\nExpression of this microRNA is tied to SKA2 expression, suggesting\nthat this observation may be a proxy of suicide-associated SKA2\ndecreases. Recently, Niculescu et al.8 demonstrated significant\nSKA2 expression decreases in the peripheral blood in both\nindividuals with high suicidal ideation as well as in suicide\ncompleters relative to controls. The same group published\npreviously on the biomarker efficacy of various peripheral blood-\nbased gene expression biomarkers9 that have also subsequently\nbeen independently replicated.10 Data exist to suggest that these\ngene systems may be linked,6 further implicating the possible\nefficacy of biomarker-based suicidal behavior prediction. An\nimportant feature of both biomarker panels is the observation\nof consistent associations across a broad range of suicidal\nbehaviors including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and suicide,\nsuggesting that dysregulation of the gene pathways associated\nwith these biomarkers may be an important underlying feature for\nthe progression to increasingly severe suicidal behaviors.\nSKA2 has been implicated as important for enabling glucocor-\nticoid receptor nuclear transactivation.11 As a result, epigenetic\nvariation influencing levels of SKA2 gene expression may be\nimportant for modulating the sensitivity of the hypothalamic\npituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. A small amount of data exist to\nsuggest that SKA2 epigenetic variation may moderate the\nsuppression of cortisol following stress.6 Importantly, other factors\nknown to influence the HPA axis such as early-life trauma\nexposure may interact with SKA2 epigenetic variation to moderate\nrisk for suicidal behaviors. In addition, epigenetic variation at SKA2\nmay have relevance to other psychiatric disorders that have\n1Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA; 2Department of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg\nSchool of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA; 3Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA; 4Department of Psychiatry and\nBehavioral Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA; 5Mental Health Service Line, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical, Atlanta, GA, USA; 6Department\nof Translational Research in Psychiatry, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany and 7Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Chevy Chase, MD, USA.

Below, we demonstrate\nthe effects of trauma exposure and SKA2 on suicide risk and\ndiscuss various confounding factors influencing suicide prediction\nefficacy.\nGrady Trauma Project\nThe subjects for this study were part of a larger investigation of genetic\nand environmental factors that predict the response to stressful life events\nin a predominantly African American, urban population of low socio-\neconomic status.12\u00ad14 Research participants are approached in the waiting\nrooms of primary care clinics of a large, public hospital while either waiting\nfor their medical appointments or while waiting with others who were\nscheduled for medical appointments. After the subjects provided written\ninformed consent, they participated in a verbal interview and blood draw.\nThis cohort is characterized by high rates of interpersonal violence and\npsychosocial stress; the majority of subjects report at least one major\ntrauma during their lifetime, and the number of traumatic experiences in\nchildhood and adulthood predict psychiatric symptom severity in\nsubjects from the blood of whom a subset of N = 61 samples were also\ncollected and analyzed from saliva.\nJohns Hopkins Center for Prevention Research Study\nData are from a prospective study conducted in a predominantly African\nAmerican, urban population.16\u00ad18 Details of the trial are available\nIn brief, the trial recruited two successive cohorts of students (1196 from\ngrade in 19 elementary schools in Baltimore, MD, USA (49.8% male and\n67.1% ethnic minority consistent with the population in Baltimore City\nschools). Since 1985, participants have been assessed through middle\nschool, twice in young adulthood and most recently when participants\nwere 30\u00ad32 years old. DNA methylation analyses were generated as\nreported previously6 and were restricted to the 326 individuals participat-\ning at the age of 30\u00ad32 data collection wave who at the time of this\nanalysis provided a blood sample (60% female and 76% African American,\nlacking another 12 who provided blood later).\nAll participants provided informed consent to participate. All procedures\nwere approved by the Institutional Review Board of Emory University\nSchool of Medicine and the Grady Health Systems Research Oversight\nCommittee and by the Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity, respectively. Samples were randomized and investigators were\nblinded to the phenotypic status during experimental data processing as\nreported previously. Detailed information on study sample characteristics\nand phenotype metrics for suicidal behavior, PTSD and trauma metrics\nappear in Supplementary Method S1 and Supplementary Table S1.\nBiological samples\nFor both Grady Trauma Project (GTP) and Prevention Research Study (PRC),\nwhole blood was collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for genetic\ntesting. As part of the GTP screen, saliva samples were also collected.\nSKA2 3'-UTR DNA methylation levels were determined using normalized\nin the GTP cohort (Supplementary Method S2 and Supplementary Figure S1).\nIn the PRC cohort, SKA2 3'-UTR DNA methylation levels were deter-\ndetermined using reverse transcription quantitative PCR as reported\npreviously.6\nDexamethasone suppression test\nIn the GTP cohort, whole blood was collected under fasting conditions\nmeasurements. A subset of 213 subjects received a low-dose dexametha-\nsone suppression test (DST) in which they took 0.5 mg dexamethasone\norally at 2300 hours, and blood was collected on the next day (that is, day\nmeasured using a commercial radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic Systems\nLaboratories, Webster, TX, USA).\nStatistical analysis\nUnless otherwise stated, reported statistics derive from linear regression\nanalysis, adjusted for age, sex and race generated in R (http://www.\nthe dependent variable was current suicidal ideation, lifetime suicide\nattempt or the natural log of the day-2 cortisol values from the DST. Unless\notherwise stated, the trauma metric for the GTP cohort was the total Child\nTrauma Questionnaire (CTQ) score, whereas the first Eigen vector of a\nprinciple components analysis combining reported sexual abuse and the\nmean frequency of emotional or physical abuse was used for the PRC\ncohort. Relevant additional covariates were determined according to the\nstrategy presented in the Supplementary Methods (Supplementary\nMethod S3, Supplementary Table S2). Using the Anderson\u00adDarling test,\nall data distributions that rejected the null hypothesis of normality were\nsubsequently evaluated with nonparametric tests. All statistical tests were\ntwo-tailed; P  0.05 denotes statistical significance and \u00b1 denotes the\ns.e.m. Where specified, genotype correction of SKA2 3'-UTR DNA\nmethylation values was achieved by taking the residuals of a linear model\nIn a similar manner and as justified in Supplementary Methods S3, we\nadjusted SKA2 DNA methylation levels for past history of substance abuse\nin all receiver operator characteristic curve analyses as the availability of\ndifferent substance abuse variables in the training data set precluded the\nability to account for substance-related decreases on SKA2 DNA\nmethylation.\nSliding window analyses were performed for visualization purposes,\nwhereby subsamples were grouped such that all individuals falling within\n\u00b1 15 units for the CTQ total or \u00b1 5 units for CTQ emotional, sexual or\nphysical abuse scores were included in the analysis.

We\nassessed the model efficacy in both N = 67 current suicidal ideators\ncompared with N = 337 controls and N = 99 lifetime suicide attempt\ncases relative to N = 321 controls.

We performed a sliding window analysis,\ngenerating an AUC value for suicide attempt prediction for all\nindividuals within a range of 30 points on the CTQ. The results\ndepicted in Figure 1a demonstrate two peaks of maximum\npredictive accuracy corresponding to groups in both the high\nand low trauma categories. Importantly, the direction of suicide\nattempt prediction in both cases appears to be reversed\nbetween these low and high trauma-exposed groupings\n(Figure 1e). This, in effect, cancels out the predictive efficacy of\nthe SKA2-only model and suggests that SKA2 3'UTR DNA\nmethylation may interact with the trauma status to moderate\nsuicide risk. Linear regression modeling in the GTP cohort\nconfirmed a significant interaction between CTQ total trauma\nscores and SKA2 DNA methylation model terms after con-\ntrolling for age, sex, race and lifetime substance abuse history\n(Table 1, Figure 2a). In the highly traumatized group, the\nmaximum predictive efficacy of N = 28 suicide attempt cases from\nEmotional abuse, more so than physical or sexual abuse,\naccounted for a majority of the total CTQ score effect on suicide\nattempt model predictability (Figure 1, Supplementary Result S1).\nWe next assessed model performance separately in subjects\npreviously classified as having experienced either low or severe\nemotional abuse. In the severely abused group, the SKA2\nepigenetic and genetic variation model predicted lifetime suicide\nattempt from N = 51 cases compared with N = 55 non-suicide\nP = 0.005), whereas stronger associations were observed in\nindividuals having experienced emotional but not physical or\nsexual abuse (Supplementary Result S2). In the low emotional\nabuse-reporting group, N = 47 suicide attempters were not\nReplication of the interaction between SKA2 and trauma on\nsuicidal behaviors\nTo corroborate the association of altered directionality of suicide\nideation/attempt prediction in low versus high trauma-exposed\nsubjects, we returned to the PRC cohort and assessed the\ndirection of suicidal behavior prediction as a function of trauma\nexposure. We observed significant interactions for SKA2 3'-UTR\nand suicide attempt (Table 1, Figure 2b). The strength of the\ninteraction between trauma and SKA2 DNA methylation was\nstrongest when modeling trauma resulting from emotional\nabuse as compared with physical or sexual abuse (Supple-\nmentary Table S3).\nIncorporation of trauma into the suicide prediction model\nIn light of the identified interaction of early-life trauma on suicide\nattempt risk, we rebuilt the statistical model from the PRC cohort,\ngenotype interacting with trauma scores, adjusting for age and\nsex. We assessed the efficacy in both N = 67 current suicidal\nideators compared with N = 337 controls and N = 99 lifetime\nsuicide attempt cases relative to N = 321 controls, incorporating\nCTQ scores as the interactive covariate.

The AUC values reported above are moderate.\nThere are a number of potential explanations for the lack of\nstrength of the reported AUCs. First, the GTP cohort represents a\nprimarily African American cohort, similar to the PRC cohort, with\nFigure 3. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves of suicide attempt prediction in blood and saliva. ROC curves generated by the model\ngenerated in the Prevention Research Study (PRC) cohort and predicting suicide attempt in the GTP cohort in (a) blood and (b) saliva. The\ntraining set data from the PRC cohort was generated by a linear model of suicide attempt as a function of the interaction of SKA2 3'-UTR DNA\nmethylation and genotype at rs7208505 with trauma scores, additively controlling for race, sex and age.

As reported previously, the allele\nfrequency of C-containing alleles is much smaller in this population\nrelative to Caucasian, Asian and Native American individuals,\nsuggesting that there may be a lower amount of biologically\ninformative alleles capable of conferring DNA methylation informa-\ntion. Additional replication studies will be required in larger cohorts\nwith more ethnic diversity to better understand the predictive\nefficacy of SKA2 in the general population. In addition, although our\nsupplementary analysis did not demonstrate a confounding effect\nof other psychiatric illnesses, it remains possible that variation is\ninduced by different underlying psychiatric conditions as well as\ndifferent subtypes of suicidality.\nSecond, the predictions result from retrospective data, such that\nepigenetic drift over time and the confounding influence of\nvarious suicide- and trauma-associated lifestyle factors may\ninfluence the prediction. In the GTP cohort, prediction of suicide\nattempt metrics performed stronger than predicting suicidal\nideation. Our previous data indicated that elevated SKA2 levels\nmay be indicative of increasing severity of suicidal behaviors,\nwhich is consistent with this observation. An increased signal may\nbe more important in a retrospective sample such as the GTP,\nwhere biological samples were taken long after a suicide attempt\nand factors affecting DNA methylation at SKA2 may have caused a\ndrift in suicide-relevant signal.\nSuicidal ideation, attempt, anxiety, trauma and substance abuse\nmetrics were obtained through different scales in the GTP and PRC\ncohorts. Although the results in both cohorts were consistent,\neach has distinct clinical features that influence SKA2 methylation.\nThis fact calls into question whether SKA2 is capable of measuring\nany suicide-relevant biology. In light of the findings detailing that\nthe SKA2 epigenetic and genetic variation independent of\ninteracting covariates was capable of similar predictive accuracies\nin the severe trauma cases stands as a proof of principle that SKA2\nalone may act as an efficacious biomarker in certain populations,\nsuch as highly traumatized individuals.\nInitial results in a small subset of DNA obtained from saliva\ndemonstrated a similar predictive efficacy to that observed in\nblood. Approximately 74% of cells in the saliva are white blood\ncells;21 therefore, a high overlap between blood- and saliva-based\nfindings is expected. It has been demonstrated that DNA derived\nfrom the saliva may be a better proxy for the epigenetic status of\nthe brain,22,23 possibly because buccal tissue is derived from the\nsame primary germ layer as the brain, the ectoderm. However, the\nrelevance of peripheral biomarker signals at SKA2 to the brain\nhave been demonstrated previously6 and may result from a tissue\nnonspecific reprogramming of the epigenome. The implication of\nthese observations is that salivary DNA may represent a useful\ncollection tissue for biomarker testing, an option that would\nultimately enable a less invasive and more cost-effective means to\nperform biomarker testing.\nOur previously published model demonstrated that SKA2 3'-UTR\nDNA methylation significantly interacted with anxiety to moderate\nsuicidal behavior that was not replicated in the GTP cohort.\nAlthough it is possible that our previously published anxiety\nresults may be linked to underlying trauma exposure, this\nconclusion is not supported by the data. Instead, it is likely that\nthe underlying factor resulting in significant interactions with SKA2\nis differential HPA axis sensitivity, which is an underlying feature of\nboth anxiety and trauma.\nWe identified a significant interaction between SKA2 variation\nand trauma at mediating the response to the DST, a metric of HPA\naxis sensitivity often dysregulated in suicidal individuals.3,24,25\nGiven the implicated role of SKA2 in facilitating glucocorticoid\nreceptor nuclear transactivation and anticorrelated relationship\nwith gene expression,6,8 the observed direction of association is\nconsistent with our previously proposed interpretation that\nepigenetically driven decreases in SKA2 may inhibit the ability of\nglucocorticoid receptor to properly suppress natural stress\nresponse. This finding has relevance to other psychiatric disorders\nsuch as PTSD, which may have altered HPA axis sensitivity. The\nobserved interaction is similar to that reported for other HPA axis-\nrelevant genes including CRHR1 and FKBP5. In both cases, high\nCTQ scores moderate the relationship between genetic variation\nand psychiatric symptoms or HPA\u00adaxis function.26,27 Indeed,\nFKBP5 has also been associated with depression, anxiety and\nPTSD.28\u00ad31 Such interactions with childhood maltreatment, includ-\ning those observed for SKA2, may result from a differential priming\nof the HPA axis by early-life trauma. Similar to FKBP5, epigenetic\nalterations at SKA2 may adapt over time in the presence of\nheightened HPA axis sensitivity causing differential effects on the\nglucocorticoid receptor-negative feedback system dependent on\nthe context of early-life exposure to stress and potentially mediated\nby the genetic and epigenetic context of relevant genes. These\ndifferential effects may predispose to stress-related disorders such\nas suicide and PTSD, which have been demonstrated to have\nopposing actions on the HPA axis, resulting in faster and slower\nclearing of post-stress cortisol, respectively. This interpretation is\nsupported by the data as individuals with PTSD and no suicidal\nbehaviors had generally lower CTQ scores compared with those\nwith suicidal behavior. Thus, the observed interaction on HPA axis\nsensitivity may be a result of the differential contributions of these\noverlapping phenotypes in the subjects tested.\nWe observed that the SKA2 epigenetic and genetic biomarker\npredicted civilian PTSD cases when child abuse was incorporated.\nThe degree to which our observations are based on comorbid\nphenotypes or substance use cannot be distinguished because of\nthe observed significant association between trauma exposure,\nsubstance abuse, PTSD and suicidality. Further work will be\nnecessary to distinguish the degree to which SKA2 is specific to\nsuicide biology or more broadly affects other HPA axis-associated\nmental disorders such as PTSD. Future work in longitudinally\ncollected samples will enable a robust way to test these\nhypotheses and to fully discern the cause versus effect nature of\nthe identified associations of SKA2 with suicidal behaviors.\nZK is an inventor on patent applications for DNA methylation biomarker-based\nprediction of PPD, suicide and PTSD.
