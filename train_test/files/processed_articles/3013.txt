DAWN, sponsored by the\nSubstanceAbuseandMentalHealthSer-\nvices Administration in the US Depart-\nment of Health and Human Services,\nprovides estimates of the health conse-\nquences of the nonmedical use of indi-\nvidual drugs. It is a large-scale, ongo-\ning retrospective survey of medical\nrecords that is used to monitor na-\ntional drug abuse trends. The system\ncollects information from DAWN-\naffiliated hospital emergency depart-\nments (EDs) to identify substances that\nare abused; monitor drug abuse pat-\nternsandtrendsanddetectnewdrugen-\ntities and combinations; assess health\nhazards associated with drug abuse;\nand provide data for national, state, and\nlocal drug abuse policy and program\nplanning.\nData are collected on patients 6 years\nandolderfromtheEDsofapproximately\nother nonmetropolitan areas.

Reported epi-\nsodes typically involve drug over-\ndoses, but also may be the result of long-\nterm drug use and adverse reactions.\nThe reporter collects information for\neach episode, including gender, eth-\nnicity, age, concomitant use of other\ndrugs, motive for use, reason for ED\ncontact, source of substance, dosage\nform, and route of administration. The\nnational estimates of abuse are de-\nrived from these data. Standardized pro-\ncedures are used to collect DAWN data;\nhowever, there may be some variabil-\nity from facility to facility.20\nDrug abuse in the DAWN system is\ndefined as the nonmedical use of a sub-\nstance for psychic effect, dependence,\nor suicide attempt or gesture. Drug\nabuse can involve the use of illicit drugs\nor any other substance (eg, heroin,\nmarijuana, peyote, glue, aerosols); pre-\nscription drugs in a manner inconsis-\ntent with accepted medical practice; and\nover-the-counter drugs contrary to ap-\nFor each episode of drug abuse, as\nmany as 4 different substances, in ad-\ndition to alcohol, can be recorded. Each\nis referred to as a drug mention. More\nthan half of DAWN episodes involve\nmultiple drug mentions.20 If DAWN re-\nporters are not able to classify a drug,\nthese mentions are classified as other/\nunspecified. DAWN reports do not in-\nclude information about drugs for\nwhich the frequency of annual men-\ntions is less than 200. However, for our\nstudy, the Substance Abuse and Men-\ntal Health Services Administration per-\nformed a special data run to extract an-\nnual abuse mentions for one of the\nstudy drugs, fentanyl, for which the\nnumber of mentions is consistently less\nWe renamed several drug categories\nand reclassified a number of drugs to\nreflectcurrentmedicalterminologyand\npharmacology. The categories desig-\nnated as narcotic analgesics and non-\nnarcoticanalgesicswererenamedasopi-\noidanalgesicsandnonopioidanalgesics.\nSome drugs were reclassified: codeine\ncombinations were recategorized from\notherdrugstoopioidanalgesics.Hydro-\ncodone was reclassified from other/\nunspecified narcotic analgesics to opi-\noidanalgesics.Ibuprofenandnaproxen\nwere transferred from other drugs to\nnonopioid analgesics. Methamphet-\namine and methaqualone, originally\nclassified as amphetamines and non-\nbarbituratesedatives,respectively,were\nmoved to the category of illicit drugs.\nOther/unspecified drugs listed within\neach subcategory of DAWN reports\nwere aggregated into 1 \"other drugs\"\ncategory.\nDAWN reports routinely combine\nheroin and morphine mentions into a\nsingle category, making it impossible\nto distinguish between the abuse of an\nillicit drug and an essential pain medi-\ncation. We requested that the Sub-\nstance Abuse and Mental Health Ser-\nvices Administration separate morphine\nfrom the heroin-morphine category for\nphine mentions accounted for an an-\nnual average of 1.9%, and never ex-\nceeded 2.5%, of the combined heroin-\nmorphine category.\nData on Medical Use of Opioids\nWe obtained data on medical use of opi-\noids from the US Drug Enforcement\nAdministration's Automation of Re-\nports and Consolidated Orders Sys-\nControlled Substances Act.10 ARCOS\nmonitors the lawful distribution of con-\ntrolled substances in Schedules I and\nII and narcotic substances in Schedule\nIII from manufacturers to the retail level\nof consumption, including hospitals,\npharmacies, and licensed practition-\ners. The Drug Enforcement Adminis-\ntration makes reports on ARCOS data,\nproviding information on individual\nstates and national totals.22 Informa-\ntion is provided for each drug in total\netary source of information on medi-\ncal use of opioids.\nRESULTS\nmentions represented by each of the 5\ndrug categories is shown in TABLE 1.\nMentions for opioid analgesics ac-\ncount for less than 4% of total DAWN\nmentions, mentions for nonopioid an-\nalgesics account for 8.6%, and men-\ntions for illicit drugs account for 33.2%.\nTABLE 2 presents the abuse levels for\nthe same drug categories as number of\nmentions and as a percentage of total\nber of mentions for drug abuse in\ncrease in total mentions for all drug cat-\negories. For opioid analgesics, the to-\ntal number of mentions increased from\nincrease), but declined as a percent-\ncategory of drug abuse that exhibited\na continual increase in both number of\nmentions and percentage of total men-\ntions over the study period.\nTrends in the medical use of the 5 se-\ntial increases were observed in use of\nfentanyl and morphine, which oc-\ncurred in both total use and use ad-\njusted for population.\nTABLE 4 presents trends for the abuse\nof the 5 selected opioid analgesics for\nthe same 7-year trend. The number\nof abuse mentions, as measured by\nDAWN, for fentanyl, hydromorphone,\nmeperidine, and oxycodone declined\nduring the study period, whereas abuse\nmentions for morphine increased by\n3.2%. The abuse levels for each of the\n5 opioid analgesics, as a percentage of\ntotal DAWN mentions, were less than\n1% and declined during the study pe-\nriod despite substantial increases in\nmedical use.\nCOMMENT\nOfficial Drug Enforcement Adminis-\ntration data indicate that the amounts\nof fentanyl, oxycodone, hydromor-\nphone, and morphine distributed to the\nretail level have increased substan-\ntially.25 According to the World Health\nOrganization, increasing medical use of\nopioids is one indication that progress\nis being made to improve pain man-\nagement.19 Despite these increases, pain\nis still inadequately treated due to nu-\nmerous barriers to pain manage-\nment.6,26 In the future, as these barri-\ners are addressed, the medical use of\nopioid analgesics may be expected to\nincrease further.\nInthisstudy,meperidinewastheonly\nopioidthatdecreasedinmedicaluseover\nthe study period. This decrease may re-\nflect increasing awareness of the short-\ncomings of the use of meperidine for\nchronic pain, which includes short du-\nration of action and accumulation of a\nlong-lived toxic metabolite.6,27\nThese data suggest that opioid anal-\ngesics, including the 5 study drugs, are\na relatively small part of drug abuse as\nmeasured by the DAWN system. Al-\nthough there are year-to-year varia-\ntions, the abuse levels have remained\nlow and relatively stable for the past 7\nyears despite substantial increases in the\nmedical use of opioids. Although abuse\nof most opioids decreased during the\nstudy period, several caveats are needed\nto place these results in context.\nFirst, these data also indicate that\nthere is some abuse of opioid analge-\nsics. However, compared with the abuse\nof other drugs, illicit drugs in particu-\nlar, the abuse of opioid analgesics ap-\npears to be relatively low, accounting\nfor 3.8% of total DAWN mentions in\nwere increases in the total number of\nmentions of abuse for opioid analge-\nsics during the study period, the pro-\nportion of mentions for opioid abuse\nrelative to total reports of drug abuse\nTable 1.

Columns do not add to 100% due to rounding.\nSecond, the DAWN system may un-\nderestimate the extent of the drug abuse\nproblem. The DAWN system mea-\nsures only those episodes of drug abuse\nthat result in an admission to an ED,\nand thus underreports the true extent\nof all drug abuse, such as drug-related\noverdoses and deaths occurring out of\nthe hospital. We believe that this limi-\ntation, which is common to all drug\nabuse monitoring systems, should not\naffect the proportional representation\nof drug categories because it should af-\nfect all drug categories equally. Fur-\nthermore, our study primarily ad-\ndresses changes in abuse trends rather\nthan abuse levels at a single point in\ntime. As such, it is important to evalu-\nate these data longitudinally to exam-\nine the stability of the incidence fre-\nquency, and to detect relative changes\nin abuse levels. However, the appar-\nent stability of abuse levels over the\nstudy period suggests that actual abuse\nof opioid analgesics, regardless of to-\ntal prevalence, is also relatively stable.\nThird, although the DAWN system\ncollects some information about the se-\nverity of adverse events resulting from\ndrug ingestion, such as mortality rates\nand hospital admissions, we were un-\nable to use the data to detect any trends\nin the severity of adverse events re-\nlated to the abuse of opioid analgesics.\nThe mortality data in the DAWN ED\nsystem are sparse because most deaths\ndo not occur in the ED. Instead, these\ndeaths appear in the DAWN medical ex-\naminer data. However, the DAWN\nmedical examiner reports were not used\nbecause drug-related mortality data do\nnot differentiate among deaths related\nto morphine, heroin, and codeine.\nMoreover, data on hospital admis-\nsions related to abuse of opioid anal-\ngesics are not available for most of the\ndrugs examined in this study.\nFourth, we used data on abuse of opi-\noids from the DAWN system. Two\nother sources of drug abuse informa-\ntion were considered but not used. The\nNational Household Survey on Drug\nAbuse,28 a widely known survey mea-\nsuring drug abuse prevalence, was not\nused because data are not available for\nspecific opioid analgesics. Also, the\nToxic Exposure Surveillance Sys-\ntem,29 which tracks exposures to toxic\nsubstances from a large sample of re-\ngional poison control centers, was not\nused because it is not nationally rep-\nresentative and because the cost of ac-\nquiring the data was prohibitive.\nCONCLUSION\nConventional wisdom suggests that the\nabuse potential of opioid analgesics is\nsuch that increases in medical use of\nthese drugs will lead inevitably to in-\ncreases in their abuse. The data from\nthis study with respect to the opioids\nin the class of morphine provide no sup-\nport for this hypothesis. The present\ntrend of increasing medical use of opi-\noid analgesics to treat pain does not ap-\npear to be contributing to increases in\nthe health consequences of opioid an-\nalgesic abuse. To maintain this trend,\nmanufacturers, pharmacies, clini-\ncians, and patients should continue\ntheir efforts to improve pain manage-\nment while exercising care so that the\ndiversionofopioidmedications for non-\nmedical use is minimized. If the abuse\nof opioid analgesics should increase, the\nsources of diversion should be ad-\ndresseddirectlywithoutinterferingwith\nmedical availability of opioid analge-\nsics, legitimate medical practices, or pa-\ntient care.\nFunding/Support: This research was supported by\ndation.\n"
