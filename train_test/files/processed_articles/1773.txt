Indeed, conflicting data exist,\nwith several studies demonstrating a significant attenuation of\nthe association between CRP and myocardial infarction or\nstroke in subjects with diabetes,25,26 although the data are not\nuniform.27 With these inconsistent findings and the accumu-\nlating evidence supporting the close interrelationship of\ninflammation and insulin resistance,28\u00ad30 we hypothesized\nthat the presence of insulin resistance might modify the\nassociation between CRP and PAD. Accordingly, we used the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nbetween HOMA-IR, a direct measure of insulin resistance,\nand PAD and to determine the influence of insulin resistance\non the association of inflammation and PAD.\nMethods\nThe NHANES is a series of surveys of the noninstitutionalized\ncivilian population in the United States. Sampling is performed in a\ncomplex, stratified, multistage manner to provide nationally repre-\nsentative data in an effort to assess the health and nutritional status\nNHANES was reviewed and approved by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was\nobtained from all subjects.\nAnkle Brachial Index Measurements\nBeginning in 1999, adults 40 years of age were asked to participate\nin a lower-extremity examination, including the ankle brachial index\n(ABI), a diagnostic test for PAD with excellent performance char-\nSystolic pressure was measured in the supine position in the right\narm (brachial artery) and in the posterior tibial artery of both ankles\nwith an 8-MHz Doppler probe. Blood pressures were measured twice\nat each site in participants 40 to 59 years of age and only once for\nparticipants 60 years of age. The ABI was calculated by dividing\nthe systolic blood pressure in the ankle by the systolic blood pressure\nin the arm. We assigned a diagnosis of PAD if either leg had an ABI\n0.90. Patients with ABI values 1.40 were excluded because these\nvalues may be falsely elevated as a result of severe vascular\ncalcification.\nLaboratory Methods\nStandard automated biochemical analysis was used to determine\nnonfasting serum glucose (Beckman Synchron LX20, Beckman\nCoulter, Fullerton, Calif), and fasting glucose was measured with the\nenzyme hexokinase method. Fasting insulin was determined with the\n2-site immunoenzymometric assay (Tosoh AIA-PACK IRI, Tosoh\nused for insulin measurement (Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala,\nSweden). Because these methods yield slightly different measure-\nments, insulin values were converted as recommended in the analytic\nguidelines.31 High-sensitivity CRP was measured by latex-enhanced\nnephelometry. Serum creatinine and nonfasting cholesterol values\nwere determined by automated biochemical profiling (Beckman\nSynchron LX20). Because of a change in assay, serum creatinine\nsuggested in the laboratory documentation files. Fasting lipids were\nanalyzed with the Hitachi 704 Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,\nSwitzerland). HOMA-IR was calculated as follows: {[fasting glu-\nCovariates\nRace/ethnicity, gender, and age were assessed by self-report. Race/\nethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, Mexican American, or other. Subjects were considered to\nhave hypertension if they reported a physician diagnosis of hyper-\ntension, if they reported taking prescription medications for hyper-\ntension, or if systolic blood pressure was 140 mm Hg and/or\ndiastolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg. These blood pressures\nwere taken separately from the ABI examination and measured with\na mercury sphygmomanometer. A diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia\nwas assigned if the subject reported a physician diagnosis of\nhypercholesterolemia or reported taking prescription medications for\nhypercholesterolemia or if the total cholesterol level was\ndiabetes mellitus if the subject reported a physician diagnosis of\ndiabetes, if the subject reported taking prescription medications\nfor diabetes (either insulin or oral agents), if nonfasting plasma\nglucose was 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). Active smokers were deter-\nmined from self-report (a positive answer to the question, \"Do you\nnow smoke cigarettes?\"). Those who did not meet these criteria were\nconsidered former smokers if they answered yes to the question,\n\"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life?\" and never\nsmokers if they had never smoked in their lifetime. Body mass index\n(BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m2)\n(n3198). We used the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease\nStudy equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from\nclassified as having chronic kidney disease. Diagnosis of congestive\nheart failure, angina, heart attack, and stroke was made by self-\nreport. Any cardiovascular disease was defined as prevalent myo-\ncardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke on the basis of a subject's\naffirmative response to the question, \"Has a doctor or other health\nprofessional ever told you that you have had a [heart attack/\ncongestive heart failure/stroke]?\" Subjects were categorized as\nhaving the metabolic syndrome on the basis of the National Choles-\nterol Education Program criteria if they had 3 of the 5 following\ncriteria: high-density lipoprotein 1.04 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) (men)\nmg/dL), fasting glucose 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), and elevated\nblood pressure (systolic 130 mm Hg or diastolic 8 mm Hg).\nDerivation of Sample Population\nexaminations. ABI measurements were available for 7571 subjects in\nABI 1.40. One half of these participants, a representative sub-\nsample of the US population, were asked to attend a morning session\nduring which fasting blood work was collected. Only individuals\nwho had fasted at least 8 to 24 hours were assigned a nonzero\nfasting weight and thus were included in our sample population.31\nThis left 3499 with glucose and insulin values enabling calcula-\ntion of HOMA-IR. We excluded subjects who were taking insulin\n(n80) given the limitations of HOMA-IR measurements in this\nsubpopulation.34 After the exclusion of subjects who did not have\ncomplete information available on other covariates of interest, the\nremaining 3242 subjects constituted the sample population for\nthis analysis.\nStatistical Methods\nNHANES uses a complex, multistage, probability sampling design\nto select participants representative of the civilian, noninstitutional-\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nized US population. Given that our analysis was limited to the\nrepresentative subsample of individuals with fasting blood work, we\nused the fasting sample weights to account for the sampling design.\nSubjects were included in our analysis only if they had fasted a\nminimum of 8 hours and had been assigned a nonzero fasting weight.\nWe generated a combined 6-year fasting weight variable by assign-\nAnalyses were performed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute,\nInc, Cary, NC) callable SUDAAN version 9.01 (Research Triangle\nInstitute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account for the complex\nsample design. Age- and gender-adjusted baseline subject character-\nistics are reported as the weighted mean and SE or the weighted\npercentile and SE. Categorical variables were compared by use of the\n2 test or logistic regression. Comparisons of mean values across\ngroups and correlations between continuous variables were achieved\nby linear regression. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated\nby logistic regression. We divided HOMA-IR values into quartiles\nand examined the presence of a linear trend across quartiles. We\nfurther evaluated the odds of PAD in each quartile compared with the\nreference group, HOMA-IR quartile 1. In a multivariable model, we\nthen adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, hypertension, hyperlip-\nidemia, smoking, BMI, chronic kidney disease, and CRP. A value of\nP0.05 was considered statistically significant except for interaction\nterms, for which a value of P0.10 was considered statistically\nsignificance.\nTo assess whether the presence of insulin resistance influenced\nthe relationship between CRP and PAD, we stratified the popu-\nlation by median HOMA-IR level to indicate the presence or\nabsence of insulin resistance and reevaluated the relationship\nbetween CRP and PAD in these 2 categories. Given the lack of\nestablished threshold values of HOMA-IR to indicate insulin\nresistance, we used the median HOMA-IR level as a threshold\nvalue in our analysis. A formal test for interaction also was\nperformed to evaluate the impact of insulin resistance on the\nassociation between CRP and PAD.\nThe authors had full access to and take full responsibility for\nthe integrity of the data.

We analyzed the association of CRP with\nPAD in analyses stratified by median HOMA-IR level (1.86).\nAmong subjects without insulin resistance, there was a\ngraded increase in PAD prevalence among increasing CRP\ncategories, with prevalence estimates of 2.2% (SE, 1.0%),\n2).

However, the association was\nmarkedly blunted in subjects with insulin resistance.

Furthermore, this is the first study to\nillustrate the association of PAD and a direct measure of\ninsulin resistance, HOMA-IR, a simple method that uses\nplasma insulin and glucose in a single fasting blood sample.\nHOMA-IR has previously been reported only in relation to\nwe found a roughly 25% increased odds of PAD for each\n1-quartile increase in HOMA-IR, a finding that remained\nconsistent despite adjustment for typical atherosclerotic risk\nfactors, factors related to insulin resistance (ie, BMI), and\nglycemic control (hemoglobin A1c\n). In addition, although the\ntrend across quartiles was marginally no longer statistically\nsignificant after adjustment for diabetes, the point estimates\nwere essentially unchanged, and subjects in the highest\nHOMA-IR quartile continued to have a nearly 2-fold\nincreased odds of PAD. Using HOMA-IR as a continuous\nvariable, we found a strong relationship between PAD and\ninsulin resistance that persisted even after additional ad-\njustment for diabetes or hemoglobin A1c\n. These data\nsuggest that insulin resistance may have an association\nwith PAD along the entire spectrum of insulin resistance\nand distinct from the impact of diabetes. Even after the\nexclusion of subjects with diabetes, there were graded\nincreases in PAD prevalence with increasing HOMA-IR\nquartiles, although the associations between HOMA-IR\nand PAD were no longer statistically significant. Our data\nsupport prior observations that PAD is associated with the\nsurrogate markers of insulin resistance.\nIn contrast to the limited data on the association of insulin\nresistance and PAD, the link between inflammation and PAD\nhas been well established. Our demonstration of a strong\nassociation between CRP and PAD is consistent with prior\nepidemiological data and prospective studies linking inflam-\nmation with atherosclerosis in the coronary and peripheral\ninflammation and atherosclerosis has been generated in\nhealthy individuals. Less clear is whether this relationship\npersists in individuals with established cardiovascular risk\nfactors such as diabetes. Sakkinen et al26 studied the relation-\nship between CRP and myocardial infarction over a 20-year\nperiod, and although they found a positive relationship\nbetween CRP and myocardial infarction in the overall popu-\nlation, the association was abolished in individuals with\ndiabetes. The same group also showed no significant rela-\ntionship between CRP and stroke among patients with dia-\nbetes or hypertension.25 Prospective data from the Strong\nHeart Study in an American Indian population found no\npredictive value of CRP for incident cardiovascular events in\ndiabetic individuals.38 In contrast, the Women's Health\nStudy2 found that CRP added prognostic information regard-\ning cardiovascular events even in subjects with the metabolic\nsyndrome, and a study by Schulze et al27 found a strong\nrelationship between CRP and cardiovascular events among\nmen with diabetes. However, none of these studies focused\nspecifically on PAD, and none directly examined the role of\ninsulin resistance.\nGiven the conflicting data on the relationship of CRP and\nvascular disease among subjects with diabetes and metabolic\nsyndrome, we explored the possibility that insulin resistance\nin particular might influence the relationship between CRP\nand PAD. Indeed, our analysis found a strong association\nbetween CRP and PAD among individuals who were insulin\nsensitive. However, this association was no longer evident in\nsubjects with insulin resistance.\nThe attenuation of the relationship between CRP and\nPAD in the presence of insulin resistance may be explained\nin part by the close interrelationship of inflammation and\nexperimental data demonstrate that inflammation leads to\nimpaired insulin metabolic signaling, resulting in insulin\nresistance.39 Insulin resistance may in turn exacerbate\ninflammation via increased cytokine and adipochemokine\nexpression (including tumor necrosis factor alpha-,\ninterleukin-6, leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1,\nplasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and others), elevation of\nfree fatty acid levels, and impaired endothelial nitric oxide\nsynthase activity.39,40 The reciprocal interaction of inflam-\nPAD Prevalence (%)\nIncreasing CRP Increasing CRP\n.\n=\np\n.\n=\np\nInsulin Sensitive Insulin Resistant\nN\nPAD (%)\nFigure 2.

In the absence of insulin resistance, there is a robust\nrelationship between increasing CRP category and prevalence\nincreasing CRP categories (P0.007). However, in the presence\nof insulin resistance, the relationship between CRP and PAD is\nsignificantly blunted, with PAD prevalence rates of 5.5%, 6.5%,\ntest.\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nmation and insulin resistance creates a cycle of further\nincreasing cardiovascular risk.\nThese findings also support the notion that atherogenesis\nresults from the complex interplay of multiple atherosclerotic\nrisk factors, each of variable influence in different vascular\nbeds. In individuals with few risk factors, inflammation may\nhave a relatively large contribution to the development of\natherosclerosis. In contrast, in the presence of a potent\ncardiovascular risk factor, insulin resistance, the relative\ncontribution of inflammation to the pathogenesis of athero-\nsclerosis may be diminished. In our study, subjects with\ninsulin resistance but without inflammation (CRP 1 mg/L)\nalready had a high prevalence of PAD (5.5%) compared with\nthose who were insulin sensitive and without inflammation\n(2.2%). Among insulin-resistant subjects, the presence of\ninflammation then resulted in only a marginal increase in\nPAD prevalence (to 6.9% in the highest CRP category) that\nwas not statistically significant. Whether these data imply that\ninsulin resistance reduces the association of inflammation and\nPAD by a distinct effect on vascular function or simply by\nincreasing inflammation, they highlight the complexity of the\ninteraction of these risk factors in PAD and suggest that the\nrole of inflammation in PAD may be modified in individuals\nwith insulin resistance.\nAdditionally, although there are common risk factors for\nthe development of vascular disease, the impact of specific\nrisk factors on the development of disease is not the same in\nthe peripheral vascular bed as in the coronary or cerebrovas-\ncular circulations.41 Indeed, cigarette smoking, one of the\nstrongest risk factors for the development of PAD, was shown\nin the Edinburgh Artery Study42 to have a greater impact on\nPAD (OR, 1.8 to 5.6 for the risk of PAD in smokers versus\nnonsmokers) than on coronary artery disease (OR, 1.1 to 1.6).\nIn contrast, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, potent risk\nfactors for coronary atherosclerosis, appear to have less\nimpact on the development of PAD, with a 10-mg/dL\nincrease in total cholesterol conferring only a 10% increased\nrisk of PAD.41 These findings suggest that individual risk\nfactors may have variable impact on different vascular beds,\nand as such, a focused analysis of the impact of insulin\nresistance on PAD is warranted and may shed light on the\ndifferential pathophysiology of PAD compared with CAD\nand cerebrovascular disease.\nThese pathophysiological differences may explain in part\nthe differences observed between our results and the findings\nof the Women's Health Study2 and a study by Schulze et al,27\nwhich suggest that CRP adds prognostic information regard-\ning incident cardiovascular disease in subjects with the\nmetabolic syndrome2 or diabetes27 at baseline. Our results\nalso stand in contrast to a cross-sectional study from Vu et\nal43 in a smaller NHANES cohort suggesting that CRP\nremains associated with PAD even in patients with metabolic\nsyndrome or diabetes, although not in those with established\ncardiovascular disease. The discrepancy is explained in part\nby differences in statistical methodology (the authors used the\ngroup with low CRP and no established disease as the\nreference population for all comparisons) and use of meta-\nbolic syndrome as opposed to a direct measure of insulin\nresistance.\nThese data are derived from a nationally representative\ncohort and therefore are generalizable to the US adult\npopulation. The ABI method has been demonstrated to have\nexcellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of\nPAD.10 Despite these strengths, potential limitations of the\npresent study merit consideration. In NHANES, the ABI was\ncalculated from the blood pressure in only 1 arm, raising the\npotential for misclassification by not excluding the possibility\nof subclavian stenosis. Additionally, our analysis was limited\nto the subset of participants with ABI measurements who had\na fasting blood sample drawn, reducing our sample size and\npotentially limiting power. However, our final sample popu-\nlation was nonetheless substantial, consisting of 3200\nindividuals in whom there were 256 cases of PAD. We also\nare limited by the lack of established threshold values of\nHOMA-IR for indicating the presence or absence of insulin\nresistance. Prior studies have used quartiles8 or quintiles,6 and\ngiven the lack established guidelines, we elected to use\nstandard median and quartile cut points in our analysis.\nAdditionally, there are notable differences in clinical vari-\nables by HOMA-IR quartile; even with multivariable models,\nthere may be confounding that may not be adequately\naccounted for in our statistical models. Finally, the cross-\nsectional nature of our study does not allow us to draw\nconclusions regarding causality, and prospective studies are\nrequired to clarify any temporal relationship and to delineate\nthe true causal relationships between inflammation, insulin\nresistance, and PAD.\nConclusions\nInsulin resistance is strongly and independently associated\nwith PAD. The presence of insulin resistance attenuates the\nassociation of inflammation with PAD. These data establish a\nrole of insulin resistance in PAD and suggest that future\nstudies are warranted to better understand the complex\ninterplay of inflammation and insulin resistance in peripheral\narterial disease.\nSources of Funding\nDr Creager is the Simon C.

Am J Cardiol. 2005;\nPeripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an important manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. Systemic inflammation and\ninsulin resistance are closely linked pathological states, and each contributes to the development of atherosclerosis.\nHowever, the specific association of insulin resistance with PAD and the influence of insulin resistance on the relationship\nbetween inflammation and PAD have not been established. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey 1999 to 2004, we found that insulin resistance, as measured by the homeostasis model of insulin resistance, is\nstrongly associated with PAD independently of known cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, we found that the presence\nof insulin resistance blunts the association between inflammation, as measured by C-reactive protein, and PAD. These\nfindings suggest a direct link between PAD and insulin resistance along its entire spectrum and highlight the complex\ninterplay of insulin resistance and inflammation in atherosclerosis.\nPande et al Insulin Resistance, Inflammation, and PAD 41\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/\nDownloaded from\nReena L.
