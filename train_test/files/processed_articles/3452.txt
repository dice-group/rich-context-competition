It is therefore a major task of jealousy research to\nidentify potential determinants of jealousy-motivated behavior. One such potential determinant is\nthe intensity of the jealousy feeling. It appears reasonable to assume that mild jealousy feelings\nSpatial distance\npromote rather innocuous mate retention tactics such as heightened vigilance. In contrast, very\nintense feelings are more likely to evoke ferocious reactions including violence and abuse.\nSeveral determinants of jealousy intensity have been identified. First, sneaking\nsuspicions of a partner's infidelity appear to result in mild, anxious-insecurity like jealousy\nfeelings (Parrott, 1991), whereas the certainty of actual infidelity is associated with intense, rage-\nlike jealousy feelings. Secondly, based on evolutionary psychological considerations, Buunk and\nhis colleagues provided substantial empirical evidence that rival characteristics affect jealousy\nintensity. These authors found that a (potential) rival's high physical attractiveness elicits more\njealousy in women than in men. In contrast, a (potential) rival high in social and physical\ndominance and social status evokes more jealousy in men than in women (e.g., Dijkstra and\nfundamental factor contributing to the intensity of jealousy concerns the infidelity type the\npartner engages in. Empirical evidence continues to accumulate confirming the evolutionary\npsychological hypothesis (Buss, Larsen, Westen, and Semmelroth, 1992; Daly et al., 1982;\nSymons, 1979) that men respond with more intense jealousy than women to a mate's sexual\ninfidelity whereas, conversely, women respond with more intense jealousy than men to a mate's\nEdlund, Heider, Scherer, Farc, and Sagarin, 2006; Guadagno and Sagarin, 2010; Groothof,\nDijkstra, and Barelds, 2009; Pietrzak, Laird, Stevens, and Thompson, 2002; Sagarin, Becker,\nAlthough the infidelity type is a major determinant of jealousy intensity, a mate's sexual\nor emotional infidelity is typically not just simply revealed. Rather, as the unfaithful partner most\nlikely tries to conceal his or her infidelity, the jealousy mechanism often needs to rely on indirect\nevidence from which a mate's infidelity can be inferred. An important source of such indirect\nevidence consists of sudden and conspicuous changes in the partner's behavior. Shackelford and\nBuss (1997) identified numerous such behavioral changes that were more diagnostic of either\nemotional or sexual infidelity. Moreover, within each infidelity type, those cues to infidelity\nvaried in their diagnostic value, that is, in the likelihood of the respective infidelity type given\nthat cue. Both the suspected infidelity type and the diagnostic value of the cue combine in\ndetermining the intensity of the jealousy feeling as men needed fewer cues to sexual infidelity\nwhereas women needed fewer cues to emotional infidelity to respond with intolerably intense\nHowever, the sudden and conspicuous changes in the partner's behavior as factors\ncontributing to jealousy intensity and thus determinants of jealousy-motivated behavior have\nseveral limitations. First, these behavioral changes are often ambiguous with respect to the\ninfidelity type (e.g., the clothing style suddenly changes; he or she stops returning your phone\ncalls), thus presumably requiring complex inference processes that are prone to errors. Second,\nsome if not most of these behavioral cues to infidelity were certainly not available during our\nancestors' past, (e.g., the clothing style suddenly changes; he or she stops returning your phone\ncalls). As a consequence, they could not have shaped the jealousy mechanism during its\nevolutionary history. Finally, although these cues contribute to the intensity of jealousy and thus\nto the regulation of jealousy-motivated behavior, they remain mute as to which specific behavior\nis most appropriate in a given situation. To illustrate, what is the appropriate response to sudden\nchanges in the clothing style or in sleeping habits? What should be done when he or she is\nunusually apologetic or when he or she says \"I love you\" either more or less frequently than he\nor she used to (Shackelford and Buss, 1997)?\nSpatial distance\nThese considerations raise the question whether there are possible additional cues to\ninfidelity that do not suffer from the limitations mentioned above. The present study picks up this\nquestion and examines a hitherto neglected but fundamental proximate contextual factor in\njealousy research: The spatial distance between the persons involved in the \"eternal triangle\"\n(Buss, 2000), that is the partner, the potential rival and the jealous person. Spatial distance\nbetween the three persons (a) was recurrently available to our ancestors and thus could have been\nexploited by the jealousy mechanism throughout our evolutionary past, (b) can be clearly\ndetected, (c) is not ambiguous and thus does not require complex inferential processes, (d)\ninforms rather directly about appropriate mate guarding behavior (e.g., moving closer to the\npartner; increasing the distance between the partner and the potential rival or stepping between\nthe partner and the potential rival).\nSeveral lines of research suggest that spatial distance is an important input regulating the\nintensity of emotions in general and jealousy in particular. Construal Level Theory (Trope and\nLiberman, 2010) assumes that spatial distance is closely related to psychological distance as a\ndecrease in spatial distance intensifies emotions dealing with immediate threats. Accordingly,\nspatial proximity and thus personal closeness between the partner and the potential rival signals\nan immediate threat that should result in intense jealousy. In the same vein, Ortony, Clore, and\nCollins (1988) construe spatial closeness in terms of psychological proximity, which in turn\ngives rise to more intense emotions. Psychological distance and proximity in these examples\nrefer to the distance between the self and another person or object. Williams and Bargh (2008)\nextended this view in showing that the mere priming of spatial closeness and distance even\nwithout reference to the self elicits more intense emotions with the closeness prime. Finally\nspatial distance has been established as the crucial input regulating distress responses in a\njealousy-related psychological mechanism, the attachment system (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters,\nand Wall, 1978). Like the jealousy mechanism, the attachment system is also activated by the\nseparation or the threat of separation from a closely related person and that evolved to establish\nand maintain an affectional bond in close relationships (e.g., Hazan and Shaver, 1987;\nThe present research focuses on three spatial arrangements systematically varying the\ndistances between the three persons involved in the eternal triangle. In each arrangement one\ndistance is always short and the other two distances are long. Specifically, in one arrangement\nthe partner is close to the jealous person (in the present study: the participant) while the potential\nrival is in the distance. The second arrangement presents the potential rival and the jealous\nperson in close proximity but both far from the partner. Finally, in the third arrangement the\npartner and the potential rival are close together and both are far from the jealous person.\nThe present study introduces new scenarios designed to raise suspicions of either sexual\nor emotional infidelity, respectively. These scenarios describe a rather familiar situation at a\nparty, thus increasing the ecological validity of the procedure. Over the course of this party, the\npartner's behavior more and more clearly signals either a partner's physical attraction to a\npotential rival or a close emotional attachment to a potential rival without using the terms sexual\nand emotional infidelity. After the scenario-based induction of suspected sexual or emotional\ninfidelity, the participants were asked to rate how (un-)comfortable they would feel in response\nto various spatial arrangements between themselves, the partner and the potential rival. We\nreferred to the emotional feelings as uncomfortable because the scenarios were designed to\nimplement sneaking suspicions of a partner's infidelity expected to result in rather mild, anxious-\ninsecurity like jealousy feelings rather than more intense and rage-like jealousy feelings. We\nSpatial distance\nexpected that this would allow the participants a more subtle differentiation of the intensity of\nthe negative feelings in response to the various spatial arrangements than the use of jealousy as\njealousy appears to imply a very high intensity of the emotional feeling (cf. Edlund et al., 2006).\nAdditionally, the use of jealousy-related emotion terms such as distress and upset as indicators of\njealousy intensity is common practice in jealousy research (see e.g., most of the research inspired\nThis new procedure allows for the testing of the following predictions. (1) When\nsuspecting a partner's (potential) infidelity, the jealousy mechanism is predicted to respond with\nonly mild negative feelings at most as long as the partner is close to the jealous person. (2)\nHowever, the negative feelings should increase when the partner is far from the jealous person\nand the rival is close to the jealous person and thus far from the partner. (3) The most\nuncomfortable feelings are predicted when the partner and the rival are close together but both\nare far from the jealous person. (4) Importantly, however, the sex-differences in the negative\nfeelings to these spatial arrangements are predicted to depend on the suspected infidelity type.\nBased on the evolutionary psychological view on jealousy, men are predicted to report stronger\nnegative feelings for each arrangement than women when suspecting the partner's sexual\ninfidelity. Conversely, women are predicted to report stronger negative feelings than men when\nsuspecting the partner's emotional infidelity. In sum, these predictions amount to a significant\nthree-way interaction between the participants' sex, the suspected infidelity type and the\ndistances between the three persons necessarily involved in jealousy.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThe participants were 38 female and 42 male students, academic staff and visitors at\ncurrent relationship status, 35 reported being married, 40 having a partner, and 5 were divorced.\nThe participants covered diverse ethnical backgrounds: 16 were British, 10 Irish, 8 Scottish, and\n3 Welsh. Moreover, 19 reported an Indian, 9 a Pakistani and 8 a Bangladeshi background. The\nremaining 7 participants reported miscellaneous ethnical backgrounds. They were not paid for\ntheir voluntary participation.\nMaterial and Procedure\nThe participants were individually approached in the public areas of the university and\nasked whether they would be willing to participate in a short study on jealousy amongst couples.\nThey were tested individually in one of two lab rooms by either a female or a male experimenter.\nThe participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions where they were led to either\nsuspect the partner developing an emotional attachment to a potential rival or a sexual interest in\nthe potential rival (subsequently referred to as the emotional and sexual infidelity condition,\nrespectively). Instructions were presented on a 20' computer monitor. The scenarios in both\nconditions began with the following two sentences (female version): \"You and your boyfriend\nare at a friend's house party and all is going well. The music is lively, everyone is socializing\nwith one-another.\" The scenario in the emotional infidelity condition then continued: \"You are\ntalking to some of your friends on the outskirts of the dance-floor when in the corner of your eye\nyou notice that your boyfriend is in the garden with another woman, alone. They seem to just be\ntalking but you can see that your boyfriend is really interested in this other person. They've been\nSpatial distance\nin the garden for quite some time now, talking, and when they finish you notice that they have a\nmoment where they are both just looking at one another. They hug each other almost tenderly\nwhich makes your stomach feel funny. Then he returns to you. However, it is abundantly clear\nthat his mind is elsewhere.\"\nIn contrast, the instructions in the sexual infidelity condition continued as follows: \"You\nare talking to some of your friends on the outskirts of the dance-floor when in the corner of your\neye you notice your boyfriend on the other side of the dance-floor dancing very closely with\nanother woman. However, at first you think nothing of it. Then you notice that their bodies are\ngetting closer and closer and their hands are all over each other. You evidently become very\nuncomfortable with this to the point that your heart beats faster and your stomach churns making\nyou feel extremely nauseous.\"\nSubsequently, the participants were informed that they \"will now be presented with a\nseries of triangles that represent this scenario. The three persons involved in this scenario (you,\nyour boyfriend and the other woman) are located at the corners of the triangle. The lines of the\ntriangles represent the spatial distance between yourself, your boyfriend and the other woman.\nThus, the shorter the line the shorter the distance and the longer the lines the longer the\ndistance.\"\nThe participant (the jealous person) was symbolized in the triangle as \"Me\", the partner\nas \"P\" and the potential rival as \"R\". An equidistant triangle with a side length of approximately\n15 cm was shown to illustrate a situation where the distances between the three persons are all\nthe same. Participants were then instructed to indicate for each triangle how (un)comfortable\nthey were with the arrangement of the distances between the three persons on a separate answer\nsheet. The 10-point rating scale provided for each triangle's rating ranged from -5 (extremely\nuncomfortable) to +5 (extremely comfortable). Zero was not an option. Additionally, the\nparticipants were informed that the presentation time of each triangle would be short because we\nwere interested in their first and immediate impression.\nThese instructions were followed by the presentation of five new triangles which were\npresented in one of four random orders. Two of the triangles with more or less similar,\nintermediate distances between the three persons were presented as fillers. Of most importance,\nhowever, were the three triangles (here referred to as Triangles A, B and C) in which the\ndistances between two persons were long, whereas the third distance was short. The long\ncm. As Figure 1 illustrates, in Triangle A the distance between the jealous person and the partner\nwas short but their distances to the potential rival were equally long. In Triangle B the distance\nbetween the jealous person and the potential rival was short, while their distances to the partner\nwere equally long. Triangle C showed the partner and the potential rival close together and both\nwere depicted equally far from the jealous person. Finally, the presentation time of each triangle\nwas fixed at 5 seconds. Immediately after each presentation of a triangle, the participants\nprovided their rating on the separate answer sheet. To start the presentation of the next triangle,\nthe participants had to press the space bar.\nSpatial distance\nFigure 1.

To\nensure a constant number of participants in the following analyses, participants with missing data\nwere not considered. It should be noted, however, that the inclusion of these participants'\nevaluations leaves the results unchanged. In a first analysis step, a three-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) with the participants' sex, suspected infidelity type (sexual vs. emotional) as the\nbetween-subjects factors and the (un)comfortableness ratings for Triangles A, B and C as the\nwithin-subjects factor yielded significant main effects for each factor, Fs > 39.34, ps < .001,\npartial 2s > .412. The two-way interactions between the participants' sex and the suspected\nSpatial distance\ninfidelity type as well as the interaction between the suspected infidelity type and the\n(un)comfortableness ratings for the three triangles were also significant, Fs > 9.13, ps < .001,\npartial 2s > .129. More importantly, however, these significant effects were modified by the\npredicted three-way interaction between the participants' sex, infidelity type and the\nThis interaction will subsequently be further analyzed with two-way ANOVAs of the ratings\nseparately for the three triangles with participants' sex and infidelity type (sexual vs. emotional)\nas the between-subjects factors.\nThe men's and women's mean (un)comfortableness ratings for the three triangles in the\nsexual and emotional infidelity condition are presented in Table 1.

As predicted,\nTriangle A (close partner, distant rival) did not result in negative feelings. The same pattern can\nbe found across participants' sex at the level of suspected sexual and emotional infidelity (see\nMore specifically, men in the emotional infidelity condition reported no uncomfortable\nfeelings for any of the triangles. Moreover, post-hoc comparisons of men's ratings in the\nemotional infidelity condition revealed marginally significantly less comfortable feelings for\nTriangles A and B than Triangle C (0.77 and 0.62 vs. 1.69). In contrast, men's ratings in the\nsexual infidelity condition show pronounced uncomfortableness ratings for Triangles B and C\nTriangle B was rated only marginally significantly more uncomfortable than Triangle C, p =\nWomen's ratings differentiated between the triangles in both the sexual and emotional\ninfidelity condition resulting in significant post-hoc comparisons. In the sexual infidelity\ncondition, women considered Triangle B significantly more uncomfortable than Triangle A (\u00ad\n2.75 vs. \u00ad 0.13). The other comparisons failed to be significant. In the emotional infidelity\ncondition, the spatial arrangements shown in Triangles B and C were rated significantly more\nand C did not significantly differ.\nSpatial distance\nDiscussion\nThe present results confirm the central assumption underlying this research that the\njealousy mechanism uses spatial information about the partner and the (potential) rival as input\nto regulate emotion intensity. Moreover, men and women use this input differently when led to\nsuspect either a partner's sexual or emotional infidelity, especially when the partner is no longer\nin close proximity to the jealous person. As predicted, the spatial arrangement depicting the\npartner close to the jealous person while the potential rival is far way (Triangle A) is considered\nnon-threatening as the participants mostly report feeling comfortable, with one exception. This\nexception concerns the women suspecting sexual infidelity who contrary to our prediction report\nvery mild negative feelings whereas the men do not.\nOnce the distance between the jealous person and the partner is increased and the threat\npresumably increases, the emotional responses change considerably. First, the emotional\nresponses are mostly rather negative and second the sex-specific influence of the infidelity type\npredicted by the evolutionary approach becomes apparent. Considering first the arrangement\ndepicting the rival close to the jealous person (Triangle B), suspecting sexual infidelity men\nreport more intense uncomfortable feelings than women. Conversely, suspecting emotional\ninfidelity women report substantial uncomfortable feelings but men still feel comfortable. Lastly,\nthe spatial arrangement showing the partner and potential rival close together but at the same\ntime both far from the own person (Triangle C) reveals the same pattern: suspecting sexual\ninfidelity men report more intense uncomfortable feelings than women, whereas suspecting\nemotional infidelity women but not men feel uncomfortable.\nContrary to our prediction, the spatial arrangement presented in Triangle C did not result in\nthe most pronounced uncomfortable feelings. Rather, it appears that both men and women\nrespond with the most intense uncomfortable feelings if the potential rival is close to the own\nperson. One reason for this unexpected finding might be that the pure physical presence of a\n(potential) rival is a salient threat cue eliciting strong negative feelings. Additionally, a close\nrival but a distant partner as depicted in Triangle B might be considered as more difficult to deal\nwith as a partner who is close to the rival albeit distant from the jealous person, as illustrated in\nTriangle C. Finally, as pointed out by a reviewer the proximity of the rival could be most\nupsetting because the jealous person feels impelled to interact with or confront the rival.\nIt is also important to emphasize that the participants of the present sample not only cover\na wide age range accompanied by considerable relationship experience. They also represent a\nhighly diverse ethnical background. It speaks to the robustness of the present findings supporting\nthe evolutionary view of sex-differences in jealousy in the presence of factors which might\ncontribute to individual differences in the attitudes towards emotional and sexual infidelity\npotentially blurring the sex-specific differences. In fact, additional statistical analyses using age\nand ethnical background as covariates revealed virtually identical results.\nAnother noteworthy aspect of the present study apparently concerns the ease with which\nthe sex-specific jealousy mechanisms can be triggered by hypothetical scenarios explicitly\navoiding the terms infidelity, jealousy, sexual and emotional. Clear sex-differences emerged with\nmen even not reporting any negative feelings at all when asked to imagine a scenario\nemphasizing an emotional attachment between the partner and a potential rival, but strong\nnegative feelings when asked to imagine a physical attraction between the partner and a potential\nrival.\nSpatial distance\nLimitations of the present study suggest directions for future research. First, the present\nstudy relies on hypothetical scenarios leading the participants to suspect their partner's emotional\nor physical attraction to a potential rival. Thus, it would be interesting to extend the present\nresearch to more realistic encounters of suspicions of a partner's sexual or emotional infidelity.\nSecond, verbal reports about the (un-)comfortableness elicited by the various spatial\narrangements of the persons involved in the eternal triangle serve as the indicator of the output of\nthe jealousy mechanism, reflecting the intensity of the emotional response. Although verbal\nreports are widely used in jealousy research (e.g., Buss et al., 1992) additional measures of the\nfunctioning of the jealousy mechanism should be assessed. For example, cortisol levels could be\nused as hormonal indicators of the participants' stress response elicited in the current scenarios.\nMoreover, mate guarding strategies presumably motivated by the negative emotional responses\nto the various spatial arrangements are important behavioral measures of the jealousy mechanism\n(e.g., Buss, 1988; Buss, Shackelford, and McKibbin, 2008). Third, as men's mate guarding\nefforts appear to increase near their partner's ovulation (Haselton and Gangestad, 2006) it would\nalso be important to know whether men's emotional responses to our scenarios would reveal a\nsimilar ovulation-contingent sensitivity of the jealousy mechanism.\n"
