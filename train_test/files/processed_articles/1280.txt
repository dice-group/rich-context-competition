In an earlier study, using samples from 2,161 healthy African American children from\n2 to 18 years old, we found a statistically significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the mean hemo-\nglobin value for each age group as compared to reference normative mean hemoglobin values.\nHere we present the results of a comparative analysis of the data set from our previous study\nand the data set from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys III (NHANES III)\n1988\u00ad1994. We found no statistically significant difference between these data sets with\nrespect to the hemoglobin values for any age or sex group, confirming that African American\nchildren and adolescents have lower mean hemoglobin values than do Whites.

The causes of ane-\nmia during childhood and adolescence are well known.\nIn 1979, Dallman and Siimes [1] established percentile\ncurves for hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume\nfor children between 5 and 16 years of age based on a\nlarge sample of white children of nonindigent parents.\nBy design, these authors gathered information from\n9,946 \\White children,\" only making reference to the\nfact that the hemoglobin concentrations would have\nbeen lower if \\Blacks\" had been included in the survey.\nWhen evaluating pediatric patients for anemia, clini-\ncians usually check their suspicion of this disorder by re-\nferring to the normative hematological reference values\nfor children and adolescents in reference textbooks, such\nas that by Nathan and Oski [2]. These standard refer-\nence values are uniformly used for all racial and ethnic\ngroups. They are used in spite of evidence in the medical\nliterature, originating as far back as 1930, that healthy\npeople of all ages who are of African extraction have av-\nerage hemoglobin concentrations ranging from 0.5 to\n0.73 g/dl below those of Whites, independent of statisti-\ncal matching, and controlled for selected variables,\nincluding iron deficiency, age, sex, hemoglobinopathies,\nand socioeconomic factors [3,4].\nA review of the medical literature over the past few\ndecades suggests that African Americans have lower\nbaseline hemoglobin concentrations than do Whites.\nDifferences in socioeconomic status or iron deficiency\nand other causes of anemia do not account for this dif-\nference [5\u00ad7]. Anemia remains common among African\nAmerican children, having been identified as one of the\nfive most prevalent conditions in this population [8].\nAccording to the Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance 2002\nreport [9], 19.3% of black children were diagnosed with\nthat while anemia has continued to decline since the\n*Correspondence to: Edwin B.

Studies done in\nthe 1960's attributed lower hematological values in Afri-\ncan Americans to diet and nutritional status but this has\nsince been disproved [10]. Nduka et al. [11] compared\nresiding in the same Nigerian town and found marked\ndifferences between the two groups, with Caucasians\nhaving higher hemoglobin levels. The hemoglobin val-\nues for African women, in particular, were much lower\nthan those previously reported, but the authors made no\nmention of diet, living conditions, or hygiene as possible\ncauses of this difference. The National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey II (NHANES II), 1976\u00ad\nhemoglobin and hematocrit levels, with African Ameri-\ncans having consistently lower mean values than those\nof Whites, but also found that those differences were\nindependent of gender, age, poverty status, or nutrition,\nalthough there was some variation with age. This survey\nprovided clinicians and researchers with suggested refer-\nence ranges for specific population subgroups.\nIn a previous study [13], we obtained samples from\nold. These children were from three independent pedi-\natric practices in Manhattan, a borough of New York\nCity. These practices have a service area spanning\nCentral and East Harlem, Morningside Heights,\nWashington Heights, and the Upper West Side, areas\nhaving high populations of African Americans. In its\nmethodology, this study addressed some of the limita-\ntions of earlier studies. The methodology included a\ncomplete dietary history and excluded individuals\nwith iron deficiency, b thalassemia trait, and sus-\npected a thalassemia trait. Adolescent patients were\nsubcategorized by age and sex to account for the\neffects of both maturation and sex on hemoglobin lev-\nbecause of patients' nutritional history, iron defi-\nciency, or the presence of thalassemia trait. Among\nthe remaining 2,161 samples, this study found a statis-\ntically significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the mean\nhemoglobin value for each age group when compared\nto reference normative mean hemoglobin values.\nThese findings were consistent with previous reports\nof significant racial differences in mean hemoglobin\nvalues.\nTo establish hematologic reference values for Afri-\ncan American children and adolescents, we performed\nan analysis of two existing data sets. The first data\nwas from our previous study of a sample of 2,161\nhealthy African American children between the ages\nof 2\u00ad18 years. The second and larger data set was\nobtained from the National Health and Nutrition Ex-\nold and older with subsamples of White (n \u00bc 6,321),\nMexican American (n \u00bc 3,616), other Hispanic (n \u00bc\nIII data files were organized in a manner suitable for\ncomparative analysis. We used the subsample of chil-\ndren and adolescents of ages 2\u00ad18 years from the\nNHANES III subsample. Of the 3,593 African Ameri-\ncan children, 2,878 were of the appropriate age for\nthis analysis.\nThe number of African American children from the\nAfrican American children in our study. Mean hemoglo-\nbin and hematocrit values for each ethnic group were\nextracted from the NHANES III data files with the\nappropriate statistical analysis software (SAS) code. The\nmean hemoglobin values for non-Hispanic Whites from\nthe NHANES III subsample was compared to the mean\nhemoglobin values from the NHANES III African\nAmerican subsample using Students T-test. These data\nfiles were sorted into groups as in our previous study: 2\u00ad\ndata from those over the age of 10 years also sorted into\nmale and female groups.\nWe compared the NHANES III subsample of he-\nmoglobin values for African American children and\nadolescents to the data from our earlier study.\nBecause our data were collected from a single demo-\ngraphic area of the United States, they may not be\nrepresentative of all African Americans. The NHANES\nIII study, in contrast, was a cross-sectional study and\nis considered to be more representative of the United\nStates population.\nRESULTS\nStatistically significant differences in hemoglobin\nvalues were found between all age and sex groups\n(Table I). The mean hemoglobin values from the\nNHANES III subsample of non-Hispanic Whites\nwere similar to the published reference standards cur-\nrently available. Comparing the data for African\nAmericans from the NHANES III study group and\nour own study group, we found no statistically signifi-\ncant differences in mean hemoglobin by age and sex\ngroup (Table II). This finding confirmed that African\nAmerican children and adolescents have lower mean\nhemoglobin values than do Whites. The similarity in\nall age and sex groups of the mean hemoglobin values\nfor the two study groups demonstrates that the sam-\nples used in our analysis were indeed representative of\nAfrican American children and adolescents. We deter-\nmined normative hemoglobin values based on the\nsimilar mean hemoglobin values of the two studies.\nDISCUSSION\nAccording to the 2004 U.S. census, African Ameri-\ncans make up 12.3% of the country's population.\nAfrican American children represent an even higher\nproportion of the pediatric population in the United\nStates, accounting, according to the 2004 census, for\nThe purpose of establishing the normative values for\nAfrican American children and adolescents is not to cre-\nate confusion for general pediatricians, but to emphasize\nthe fact that hemoglobin values vary by ethnicity. With\nthe ethnic diversity of the United States and its ever-\nchanging demographic patterns, practitioners need to be\naware of how ethnicity and mixed ethnicity can influence\nwhat may be considered a normal hemoglobin value.\nThese new reference values are intended to be used only\nas guidelines; they are not designed to replace good clini-\ncal judgment and appropriate hematological workups.\nHowever, this newly developed reference table does pro-\nvide documentation and a quick reference source for the\nracial differences in hemoglobin values between African\nAmerican children and adolescents and non-Hispanic\nWhite children of the same ages.\nAlthough this information has been available in the\nNHANES database for years, and although the medi-\ncal literature has, for decades, clearly demonstrated\nthat normal hemoglobin values differ between African\nAmericans and non-Hispanic Whites, a reference\ndatabase for African Americans has never before\nbeen developed.

With the costs\nand restrictions of present-day health care, unneces-\nsary anemia evaluation and treatment should be\navoided. These guidelines will not only identify\npatients who need additional anemia evaluation, but\nalso prevent the misdiagnosis of anemia in African\nAmerican children and adolescents.\nREFERENCES\n1.
