    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe report some new observations on what could be regarded as the world's simplest visual\nillusion--the autokinetic effect. When a single dim spot of light is viewed in a completely dark\nroom, it moves vividly in random directions. During steady fixation, perhaps subtle eye movements\ncause the image to move and a failure to correct for this using eye movement command signals\nleads to motion perception. This is especially true because eye muscle fatigue can lead to\nmiscalibration. However, if two dots are shown, they often move independently in different\ndirections, which negate the eye movement theory. In addition, two lines defining a single cross\nsometimes uncouple and slide past each other and the fragments composing a hidden object move\nindependently until they click in place and the whole object is perceived--implying that the illusion\noccurs relatively late in visual processing. Finally, the effect is modulated by vestibular stimulation;\nanchoring your sense of self may be a prerequisite for binding features into coherent objects.\n",

Nine nai\u00a8ve subjects were asked to view the display with one eye and\npress the buttons on a keyboard to indicate whether the dots moved in unison or were\nuncoupled (we could infer by default, the proportion of time they appeared stationary).\nWe found the dots were uncoupled and progressively more often as the separation\nbetween dots increased--casting further doubt on any simple version of the theory that\nthe illusion is based on eye movements or reafference from commands (because the single\neyeball cannot move simultaneously in multiple directions) (Figure 1).\nExperiment 2: Size Constancy\nThe perceived distance between two horizontally separated dots remains relatively constant\nas you walk toward them; despite the rapidly increasing size on the retina. This is because the\nbrain takes into account distance cues and applies a correction to calculate the real physical\nseparation. We wondered, therefore, whether this effect occurs prior to, or after, the\nautokinetic effect. In Experiment 1, we showed a monotonic relationship between\nhorizontal separation and duration of uncoupling. Comparing the results of the present\nExperiment 2 (new nine nai\u00a8ve subjects) to Experiment 1, it seems clear that moving\nyourself closer to the display does not lead to equivalent uncoupling because the brain\nuses subtle depth cues (e.g., from small amount of stray light as well as nonretinal cues\n% Asynchronous motion\nDegree of horizontal separation\nFigure 1. The percentage of uncoupled motion increased as the two dots were placed farther apart,\nsuggesting the illusion occurs after grouping by proximity.\n2 i-Perception\nsuch as accomodation and overall cognitive inference about the room layout) to infer\nthat the horizontal separation has not actually changed. The net result is the degree of\nsynchrony/asynchrony is roughly half way between perfect constancy and no\nconstancy--compelling evidence proving that effect does not occur early in sensory\nprocessing (Figure 2).\nDemonstration 1: Grouping Effects\nWe have seen in Experiments 1 and 2 that grouping by proximity results in the dots moving\nsynchronously whereas if the dots are far apart they uncouple and wander in different\ndirections. We wondered if other types of grouping also play a role. Figure 3(a) depicts\ngrouping by contrast and Figure 3(b) by orientation of lines--in both cases, grouping by\nsimilarity resulted in uncoupling and independent movement of the two clusters. Four naive\nsubjects experienced this.\nDemonstration 2\nIf you look at (say) two orthogonal lines forming an X shape in a fully lit room, you see it\nexactly as it is. But when you view two luminous lines in darkness--they uncouple and almost\nslide off each other! This implies that illusory motion signals are differentially applied to the\nlines prior to the solution to the aperture problem. In addition, if one voluntarily stratified\nthe lines mentally--then the nearer of the two lines always appeared to slide over the farther\n% Asynchronous motion\nDegree of horizontal separation\nmove the subject\nmove the dots\nFigure 2. As in Experiment 1 (Figure 1), the dots were seen to uncouple more when they were far apart\nfrom each other (dotted line). But if the subjects moved closer to the dot pairs they did not uncouple\nequivalently--showing a partial size constancy correction (solid line).\nRamachandran et al. 3\n(Figure 3(c)). Thus, image segmentation (aperture problem) and top-down processing can\nstrongly modulate autokinetic effect.\nDemonstration 3\nThe top-down component was especially striking in the experiment using an illusory three-\ndimensional (3D) Y shape defined by attached shadows (Figure 3(d)). The figure is initially\nseen as mere irregular fragments by most people but eventually a 3D ``Y'' is seen.\nIntriguingly, if luminous fragments are used, subjects initially see them moving\nincoherently; though not always. But as soon as the fragments ``click'' into place forming\na 3D ``Y''; they always move together as a single object.\nDemonstration 4\nOne might expect that binding of multiple attributes of the visual scene into a stable coherent\npercept would also require prior anchoring of the observing self in one's body scheme--which\nin turn is strongly modulated by vestibular input. Indeed, the strategic location of vestibular\ncortex in the vicinity of polymodal parietal cortex makes it an ideal candidate for both\nanchoring and binding; for example, patients with parietal lesions often have\nsomatoparaphrenia (denial of arm; Ramachandran, 2003) as well as illusory feature\nFigure 3. Grouping by contrast (a) and grouping by line orientations (b). (c) Two perpendicular lines moved\nindependently on many trials. (d) The fragments moved independently until they saw the 3D block letter ``Y.''\n4 i-Perception\nconjunctions (caused by a failure of binding; Robertson, Treisman, Friedman-Hill, &\nGrabowecky, 1997). Although vestibular modulation of autokinetic effect has been\nobserved before (Gregory & Zangwill, 1963; Nelson, 2001), we were curious whether the\ndegree of movement, coupling, and feature binding would be influenced by the procedure.\nWe used a portable noninvasive galvanic vestibular stimulation to modulate vestibular\nfunction in six naive subjects. Five subjects reported that there was substantially more\nillusory motion--and of these, four reported more coherence and binding during the\nstimulation; most commonly a rocking or seesaw motion at 1 Hz (curiously, one subject\nreported less binding). These informal observations suggest that vestibular modulation\ndoes indeed occur. However, additional experiments are needed to confirm this.\nWe suggest that the brain creates multiple drafts of parallel sensory inputs on temporary\nsketch pads before integrating them at various stages to create a subjective impression of\ncoherence and stability. In a room full of objects, the noise from parallel sources gets\naveraged out to increase signal-to-noise ratio. However, in a cue impoverished environment\nwith a single luminous dot, such noise cancellation fails and the dot is free to wander.\nTaken collectively, these experiments on autokinetic effect allows us to explore the laws of\ncue integration and provide a novel approach to the binding problem and its relevance to\nconsciousness. In addition, far from being a curiosity, the illusion has relevance to our war\nand defense; during the Gulf War, American scouts perceived a whole battalion of enemy\ntanks move toward them and launched a counterstroke, failing to realize it was autokinetic\neffect. Had the realization come any later, we might now be facing nuclear winter and would\nnot have written this article.\n"
