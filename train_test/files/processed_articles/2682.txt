Two multi-country data collection efforts, SHARE and SAGE, provide nationally representative samples of adults\naged 50 years and older. Forty items were used to construct the frailty index in each data set. Our study shows that the level\nof frailty was distributed along the socioeconomic gradient in both higher and lower income countries such that those\nindividuals with less education and income were more likely to be frail. Frailty increased with age and women were more\nlikely to be frail in most countries. Across samples we find that the level of frailty was higher in the higher income countries\nthan in the lower income countries.\nCitation: Harttgen K, Kowal P, Strulik H, Chatterji S, Vollmer S (2013) Patterns of Frailty in Older Adults: Comparing Results from Higher and Lower Income\nCountries Using the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health (SAGE).

Assessing levels of frailty in higher versus lower income\ncountries gives a unique perspective on health status at different\nstages of demographic transitions, and the effect of different\npolicies on functioning and, in turn, on well-being over the life\ncourse. With almost all countries in the world faced with growing\nnumbers of older persons, and more older persons in lower than\nhigher income countries, a better understanding of levels of\nfunctioning and predictors of health care utilization will be\nnecessary for planning purposes.\nThe important factors will be how to best maintain the health\nand functioning of an aging population, thereby preventing or\npostponing disease, disability and frailty. These mitigating factors\nare not only present at the individual level, but also in the\nsupporting environment, for example in communities and social\nnetworks [5].\nFrailty has significant impacts on individuals and society with\nincreased risk of dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional\nplacement, and mortality [6], [7]. Numerous classifications and\ndefinitions of frailty are currently used in different clinical and research\nsettings [8]. Although a common metric for measuring and assessing\nfrailty would be a starting point, it is hard to establish [9]. Two of the\nmore commonly used definitions are operationalized as: a physical\nphenotype [10]; and as a multi-domain count of health impairments\n[11]. The latter description of frailty, as a `multidimensional loss of\nreserves (energy, physical ability, cognition, health) that gives rise to\nvulnerability', was used for this study [12], [13]. This approach\naccounts for deficits in many different health domains measured in the\ntwo multi-country studies used here: the Study on Health, Ageing and\nRetirement in Europe (SHARE) and the World Health Organiza-\ntion's (WHO) Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE).\nThis paper provides evidence on frailty in older adults across 14\nhigher income countries and six lower income countries, using a\ncommon set of variables to define frailty. The background aging\ncharacteristics of each of the countries in the study are presented in\nData and Methods\nThe study sample\nThe data for these analyses come from two multi-country\nsurveys, SHARE which is supported by the European Commission\n(see www.share-project.org), and SAGE which is supported by the\nUS National Institute on Aging (see www.who.int/healthinfo/\nsystems/sage). SHARE includes more than 45,000 individuals\naged 50-plus [14] from higher income countries. Currently, four\nwaves of SHARE are publicly available and fieldwork has started\nfor the fifth. We focus on the second wave of SHARE, because its\ntiming coincides (more or less) with the first wave of SAGE. The\n14 countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark,\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland,\nSpain, Sweden, and Switzerland. SHARE is representing about\nSAGE consists of nationally representative samples of older\nadults in six low and middle income countries: China, Ghana,\nIndia, Mexico, the Russian Federation and South Africa,\naccounting for 42% of the world's population aged 50-plus in\n2011 [15]. SAGE includes questions about health and well-being,\nrisk factors and chronic conditions, socio-economic status and\nwork, social networks, and health care utilization. Standardized\ntraining and survey materials were used across the countries. The\nfirst (and to date only publicly available) full wave of SAGE was\nindividuals aged 50-plus. Both studies, SAGE and SHARE, are\nstill ongoing.\nStudy contents and variables\nIn addition to socio-economic variables, including education,\nassets, income, consumption and transfers data, both data sets\ninclude a large set of health information (self-reported health,\nhealth conditions, physical and cognitive functioning, health\nbehaviors, and health care utilization), biomarkers (grip strength,\nbody mass index (BMI), lung function, vision), and well-being\nvariables (affective health, subjective well-being, life satisfaction).\nTable 1.

The results were recoded into dichotomous\nvariables taking the value of 0 if not present, and 1 if present. The\ndata set was then reshaped and country-specific ``asset ladders''\nwere generated. A Bayesian post-estimation (empirical Bayes)\nmethod was used to arrange households on the asset ladder, where\nthe raw continuous income estimates were transformed in the final\nstep into quintiles. This dichotomous hierarchical probit model\nhas been described in detail elsewhere and used in other studies\nGrip strength was measured using Smedley's hand dynamom-\neter, with two trials in each hand with the respondent in a seated\nposition with the arm at a 90-degree angle and elbow close to the\nbody. A single value was derived from taking the average of the\nbest result in each hand. Body mass index was based on measured\nheight and weight, and is equal to weight/height squared.\nFrailty index construction\nThe approach taken for this analysis is the deficits count\napproach to construct the frailty index. A frailty index is strongly\nassociated with worsening health status and higher mortality risk\nwhen at least 30 deficits are included [20]\u00ad[22]. As more deficits\nare included, the precision of estimates increases, alternately,\nestimates become unstable when fewer than 10 deficits are\nincluded.\nThe actual number of deficits included in this frailty index was\ndetermined by the availability of the same variables in the second\nwave of SHARE and the first wave of SAGE, and by the following\nFigure 2. Box plots of the frailty index by country. Note: The box\nshows the 25th to 75th percentile of the frailty index. The horizontal bar\ninside the box shows the median value. The upper and lower bars show\nthe upper and lower adjacent values (values within 1.5 times the IQR\nfrom the upper and lower quartile). The interquartile range (IQR) is\ndefined as the distance between the 25th and 75th percentile. Outside\nvalues are omitted.

Individual level observations pooled across\ncountries.\nPatterns of Frailty in Older Adults\nPatterns of Frailty in Older Adults\ninclusion criteria: (1) deficits must be associated with the health\nstatus of the individual; (2) prevalence of deficits must increase with\nage; (3) deficits must not saturate too early; (4) when the\naccumulated deficits of an individual are considered as a whole,\nthey should cover a range of systems (for example, not only\nimpacting cognition).\nA set of assumptions accompanied the inclusion criteria: a) a\nreasonable proportion of the population would have the charac-\nteristic; b) low levels of missing data - not more than 25% missing\nfor a given variable; and, c) variables were an expression of a\nhealth deficit [20].\nThirty-nine variables from SHARE and 40 variables from the\nSAGE dataset were used to generate the frailty index. These\nvariables included difficulties in functioning (like loss of mobility),\nlimitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) (such as needing help\nwith bathing), and diseases (such as depression, stroke, diabetes).\nThe underlying assumption is that increasing deficits contribute to\na higher likelihood of frailty in an individual [23]. Information\nabout variable selection and deficit thresholds for constructing the\nfrailty index were taken from published literature [20], [24].\nTable 2 shows the cut-offs of the selected variables and differences\nin constructing the frailty index for both SAGE and SHARE.\nPrevious studies have indicated that frailty indices need not be\nbased on the same items to yield similar results when taking the\ntallying deficits approach [25].\nThe variables included were binary, ordinal or continuous.\nBinary variables were coded as 1 being a deficit and 0 as non-\ndeficit. For continuous variables, additional categories between 0\n(no deficit) and 1 (maximal deficit) were included. For example,\nself-rated health can be very good = 0, good = 0.25, moder-\ndeficit threshold. Setting cut-offs for the ordinal and continuous\nvariables (walking speed, BMI, grip strength, mobility problems)\nfollowed an approach based on published literature. Cut-offs were\ndefined based on characteristics of the distribution of the deficits\nThe frailty index was then calculated as the proportion of the\nnumber of deficits for an individual to the total number of deficits.\nFor example, a respondent with reported cancer, hypertension,\ntrouble sleeping and slow walking speed has a frailty index score of\n4/40 (0.10). In this case, frailty could be a pre-disabled state, so an\nindividual could be frail but without any limitations in ADLs; or\nfrail persons could have comorbidity and disability (i.e., with\nlimitations in ADLs).\nIn addition, besides the differences in some indicators, the data\nsets also differ in the cut-off point for some indicators. For\nfunctional activities and activities of daily living, the SHARE data\nFigure 4. Relationship between frailty and age by country and sex, SAGE countries.

The log transformation is justified because we expect the age-\nspecific frailty index to increase exponentially with age. We only\nconsider ages between 50 and 85, because for older ages the\ncountry and sex specific samples sizes are too small to calculate the\naverage age-specific frailty index with sufficient accuracy.\nResults\nThe results are based on weighted samples of persons aged 50-\nplots for SAGE and SHARE (Figure 1) looks rather similar, but\nwith a slight left shift and lower peak in the case of SAGE.\nAmongst the SHARE countries \u00ad the highest mean frailty index\nscores were seen in Italy, Spain and Poland, the lowest in\nDenmark, Switzerland and Ireland. In SAGE, the highest frailty\nscore was seen in the Russian Federation. The lower income\ncountries had lower frailty levels than those seen in higher income\ncountries \u00ad with China having the lowest mean frailty scores\namongst all countries (Tables 3 and 4). Figure 2 shows a box plot\nof the frailty index by country.\nOn average, women and older age groups had higher frailty\nlevels than men and younger aged adults. The mean frailty scores\ndemonstrated strong inverse education and income gradients, with\nlower levels of education and lower wealth showing higher levels of\nfrailty. These patterns were consistent in higher and lower income\ncountries from the two studies.\nTo visualize the link between frailty and age, scatter plots of the\nlog of the age-specific frailty index and age with a linear fit and a\n95% confidence band were generated by country and sex\n(Figures 3 and 4). At most ages, the regression line for females is\nstrictly above the regression line for males. In general, the slopes\nare rather similar for males and females within a country (Table 5).\nHowever in a few countries, such as China, India, Ireland and\nSwitzerland, the slope is much steeper for males than for females,\ncausing the regression lines to intersect at older ages.\nDiscussion\nFrailty is being increasingly recognized as a useful construct in\nclinical and other settings. While different stakeholders have used\nvarying definitions to suit their specific purpose, there is an\nemerging consensus that frailty is a multidimensional phenomenon\ncharacterized by decreased reserve and diminished ability to\nrespond to stress. Its assessment should include measures of\nphysical performance, including gait speed and other measures of\nmobility, nutritional status and mental health, including cognition.\nHowever, currently there is no agreement on a single biomarker\nA recent systematic review on the prevalence of frailty in\ncommunity samples showed a consistent increase in frailty with\nage and that frailty was more common in women. This review also\nnoted big differences between countries that were attributed to\ndifferences in the definition used [28]. Despite our use of a frailty\nindex that was uniformly applied across countries we still have\nsignificant differences between countries. Our observation that\nhigher frailty scores were seen in the SHARE countries as\ncompared to the SAGE countries could possibly indicate a\nsurvivor bias, where social support and health systems allow\npeople in wealthier countries to live longer despite higher levels of\nfrailty.\nApproaches to measuring frailty and constructing a frailty index\nhave varied considerably. A recent analysis of six different\napproaches showed that these measures can, at best, be used to\nexclude frailty as their ability to predict functional decline and\nmortality remained poor, and their false positive rates were too\nhigh to permit major health care decisions [29]. Measuring frailty\non a continuum as in our study helps in setting thresholds as fit for\npurpose. As the SAGE and SHARE studies will produce more\ndata from future waves and track respondents who develop a need\nfor long term care or die, the frailty index can be examined to\ndetermine its predictive validity including a sensitivity analysis to\npick the right threshold depending on the country. Also, it would\nallow the examination of different trajectories that respondents\nmay follow over time and an analysis of the factors associated with\nthese different trajectories.\nFrailty is perhaps the end result of a cascade of events from\ninflammatory processes to coagulative dysregulation to a range of\nalterations in hormones and peptides and a disruption of\nhomeostatic mechanisms. Understanding this further in a range\nof settings will help identify individuals at risk of becoming frail\nand refine interventions for prevention and treatment that will\nlikely range from nutritional therapies to improving physical\nAuthor Contributions\nAnalyzed the data: KH SV.
