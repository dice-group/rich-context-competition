The results showed\nthat Portuguese media's discourse on sexuality is not only becoming more liberal but is also characterized by ambiguity\nand contradiction.Within a \"progressive\" discursive framework for sexuality, tensions and double standards for women are\nstill noticeable.The media discourse in Portugal continues to reinforce the established gender hierarchy and inequality in\nheterosexual relationships and maintain traditional gender roles.\n",

The study of sexuality and media has been developed\nparticularly in the context of feminist research. The media\nwere a focus of feminist attention (van Zoonen, 1994) dur-\ning the three waves of feminist movements. The media\nassumed particular relevance during the third wave, espe-\ncially in the context of postmodern feminism (Nogueira,\ncombinations and intersections between the media, con-\nsumer culture, neoliberal policies, postmodern theory, and\nfeminist assumptions (Genz & Brabon, 2009; McRobbie,\n2009). Today, feminist research on the media is an innova-\ntive project that joins cultural studies, media, and commu-\nnication. Feminist research embraces a dimension that is\npolitical, complex, multidisciplinary (Gallagher, 2006), and\nsocioculturally focused (Devereux, 2007) with respect to\nsexuality and female subjectivity.\nFor example, in the advent of feminist scholarship on the\nFeminine Mystique, which analyzes the representations of\nhousewives particularly in women's magazines of the\n1960s. Since then, many studies have focused on the role of\nwomen's magazines in the construction of female subjectiv-\nity and the way in which women experience their sexuality\nCultural discourses and practices, which include the\nmedia, define norms and values for feminine and masculine\nsexuality and construct gendered standards for both expected\nand unexpected sexual behaviors (Jackson & Gee, 2005;\ntherefore, the product of specific social, cultural, and histori-\ncal factors, and it also outlines social and gender relations\nMagalh\u00e3es, 2010). It is used to justify gender differences and\nperpetuates gender beliefs, expectations, values, and rules.\n(Hetero)sexuality and gender are, therefore, intrinsically\nrelated--they are not the same, but sexuality reveals gender\nconstructions, and both in turn constrain sexual practices\nCross-cultural studies indicate that these norms, values,\nand practices vary within different contexts (e.g., Benkert,\n2002) and have suggested the possibility of more subtle\nmicrovariations. For example, Williams's (2002) study,\n1University of Minho, School of Psychology, Braga, Portugal\nCorresponding Author:\nAna Rita Conde Dias, Psychologie School, Minho University, Campus de\nEmail: ritacondedias@psi.uminho.pt\nFrom \"Chastity As a Gift\" to \"Doing It As a\nSign of Love\":A Longitudinal Analysis of the\nDiscourses on Female Sexuality in Popular\nMagazines in Portugal\nAna Rita Conde Dias1, Carla Machado1, and Miguel Gon\u00e7alves1\n Keywords\nsexuality, gender, women, media, culture, Portugal\n2 SAGE Open\nconducted in the United States using two groups of adoles-\ncent girls, showed clear differences in the construction of\nfemininity that was linked to the specific sociocultural char-\nacteristics of the two groups.

In Europe, studies indicate gender differ-\nences regarding sexual activity (onset and number of\npartners), and Portugal is the country in which this difference\nis most evident (Ross, Godeau, & Dias, 2004). A comparative\nstudy of several European countries indicated that only 20.3%\nof Portuguese girls claimed to be sexually active, compared\nreveal that boys have a greater number of relationships (an\naverage of three) than do girls, who have an average of one\nMany studies developed in Portugal reveal the gender dif-\nferences in the experience of sexuality: Boys become sexu-\nally active earlier than girls, while the rate of virginity is more\npronounced in girls (Alferes, 1997; Monteiro & Raposo,\n2005) and boys have more sexual partners than do girls.\nStudies indicate that there is a perpetual asymmetry of affec-\ntive expectations: Whereas boys' achievements are deter-\nmined by the number of relationships, women are still\nattached to the romantic aspect and exclusivity of each\nromantic involvement (Saavedra et al., 2010).\nIn Portugal, along with these studies about sexual behav-\nior and attitudes, some research groups and authors have\nalso analyzed the media in relation to gender and feminist\nacterizes the evolution of feminist media studies in Portugal;\nwomen in the Portuguese press and in the publicity spots;\nCerqueira, Magalh\u00e3es, Cabecinhas, and Nogueira (2011)\nanalyze gender representations in news magazines; and\nMagalh\u00e3es (2011) analyzes the discourses of sexuality in a\nteenage girls' magazine. Globally, these studies reveal the\npersistence of gendered representations in media content\n(Cerqueira et al., 2011) and show that women and girls are\nexposed to contradictory messages, from an emancipation\ndiscourse to a discourse of subservience (Magalh\u00e3es, 2011;\nMota-Ribeiro, 2005). The studies also reveal the presence of\na discourse that objectifies and minimizes women\ning a hegemonic and androcentric vision that prevents an\ninclusive and equal citizenship (Cerqueira et al., 2011).\nIn fact, despite the transformations occurring in Western\nsocieties, there are differences between different countries\nand their sociocultural contexts (Benkert, 2002; Gill &\nScharff, 2011). It is important to understand the transforma-\ntions of sexuality within their social, cultural, historical, and\npolitical backgrounds. In this respect, Portugal is a country\nwith cultural specificities that should be analyzed: Three\ndecades ago, the Portuguese lived under a dictatorial politi-\ncal regime in which women were considered inferior and\nwomen were considered to be the property of the husband or\nfather; women were not encouraged to work; divorce was\nnot possible; and women were supposed to only have one\nboyfriend whom they should marry and have children with\nwhich is a very Catholic country where politics and religion\nare united, the highest values are summarized in the follow-\ning phrase: \"God, Family and Country\" (Pimentel, 2000). It\nwas not until April 25, 1974, that a revolution took place and\ngave rise to a democratic period. Despite a period of struggle\nand the consolidation of rights and equality for women, in\nwhich the feminist movement played an important role, gen-\nder disparities still persist, and the old \"values\" remain in the\nConde Dias et al. 3\ncontext of sexuality and relationships (Dias, Machado,\nManita, & Gon\u00e7alves, in press; Saavedra et al., 2010). As\never, such transitions are happening against the backdrop of\nmore constraining sexual values than were characteristic of\nAmerican society several decades ago. For women living in\nthese contexts, the transformations now occurring are dra-\nmatic and shattering\" with respect to their social integration\nand acceptance and their own negotiation of their gender,\ncultural, and even religious identity (see Machado, Dias, &\nAs mentioned above, social \"reality\" is mostly constructed\nby the media. Media discourses are important resources that\npeople use to construct/support ways of understanding many\nsocial problems and phenomena, such as sexuality, sexual\nrelationships, and gender identity. Several media studies on\ngender issues and gender relationships have been conducted\nin the last several decades (e.g., Cancian & Gordon, 1988;\net al., 2011) revealing that the media reinforce specific gender\nimages and meanings, namely, hegemonic masculinity (male\nauthority, ability, and strength) and submissive femininity\n(dependency, sexual receptivity/passivity, and mothering). In\nfact, several studies of women's magazines reveal their\nemphasis on heterosexual femininity, beauty, and fashion\n(Brown Travis, Meginnis, & Bardari, 2000; Magalh\u00e3es,\nalong with the reinforcement of predominant gender stereo-\nMany studies on this subject have been conducted, but\nfew studies have used a longitudinal analysis (e.g., Cancian\nthrough which it would be possible to identify and under-\nstand the variations in public discourses about this theme\nover time.\nIn this study, we develop a longitudinal analysis (over a\n40-year period) of media discourses because the social con-\nstruction of female sexuality must be understood in its\nsociocultural and political context given the profound\nchanges in Portugal.\nA Longitudinal Study of Media Discourse\nin Portugal on Female Sexuality\nObjectives\nThe main goal of this study is to characterize the dominant\nsociocultural discourses (and their transformations) with\nrespect to feminine sexuality in Portugal, from 1965 to the\npresent, and to analyze the potential implications of these\ndiscourses on the construction of female sexuality.\nBefore presenting our methodology and results, it is\nimportant to note the way the relationship between media\ndiscourse and the meanings and realities of individuals\nexposed to this discourse is conceptualized in this article. A\ndialectic relationship exists between the media and society\ndiscourse on sexuality is a product and mirror of predomi-\nnant sociocultural representations and practices. On the other\nhand, those media representations contribute to the sociocul-\ntural construction of sexuality, thus reinforcing or changing\nsocial patterns of behavior and thoughts (Gallagher, 2006;\nIt is important to note that there is no cause\u00adeffect rela-\ntionship between media discourse and individual beliefs or\nbehaviors. From a social constructionist perspective, media\ndiscourse is anchored in social reality, reflecting not only the\npredominant social norms but also the diversity of values\nand behaviors that characterize the social world. These dis-\ncourses constitute important resources for people trying to\nmake sense of the world (Potter & Wetherell, 1992), but the\npublic is not merely a passive recipient of media discourse.\nOn the contrary, several studies suggest that people are able\nto critically analyze media content and that they seek infor-\nmation that reinforces their previous views of the world\n(Sacco, 1995). In this article, although we do not consider\nthe way media content is understood by the public, this is an\nimportant point to keep in mind in order not to reify the\nresults of media content analysis, such as those we will pres-\nent next.\nMethod\nof media production was considered and included materials\ncorresponding to different phases of the recent sociopolitical\nhistory of Portugal and the corresponding transformations in\nsocial practices and discourses. This framework allowed for\nthe inclusion of materials from three distinct phases of recent\nPortuguese sociopolitical history: the fascist regime (that\nto the present).\nWithin this time frame, magazines were selected accord-\ning to their accessibility (preference was given to large dis-\ntribution titles), target audience (women, men, adolescents,\nand the general public), and the content profile (generalist,\n\"society/celebrities,\" and \"romantic/interpersonal\"). This\nselection led to a final sample of 10 magazines distributed\naccording to six different profiles: \"general content\" for the\nadult public (Selec\u00e7\u00f5es), \"general content\" for the adult\nfemale public (Modas e Bordados, M\u00e1xima), \"generalist\ncontent\" for the adult male public (Men's Health), \"roman-\ntic/interpersonal content\" for the female public (Cr\u00f3nica\nFeminina, Maria), \"romantic/interpersonal content\" for the\n4 SAGE Open\nadolescent feminine public (Menina e Mo\u00e7a, Ragazza), and\n\"society/celebrity content\" for the adult female public\n(Flama, Nova Gente). Whenever a magazine was no longer\npublished, it was substituted by a publication of magazines\nwith a larger circulation and a similar profile.\nIt must be noted that the initiation of a true media culture\nilliteracy rates were very high (26%-40%), mainly in rural\nareas and among women. Therefore, reading was only preva-\nlent among societies' elites (Barreto, 2002). Moreover, the\nfascist government controlled editorial policies and contin-\nued to promote its rigid ideology. During the dictatorship,\ncensorship acts were extremely aggressive. These censorship\nacts included the confiscation and destruction of books; the\npersecution of authors, publishers, and booksellers; the forced\nclosings of printers; and the preliminary examination of all\nprinted material (Medeiros, 2010). Consequently, the analy-\nered case studies that help to illustrate the representation of\nwomen (and female sexuality) under a dictatorship.\nMoreover, because of this repression and censorship of\npublishers and printers, the magazines that existed during the\ndictatorship cannot be compared with recent magazines in\nterms of content or editorial policy. Nevertheless, we\nattempted to maintain equivalence in terms of target audi-\nence, circulation, and publisher (e.g., \"Flama\" was replaced\nby \"Nova Gente\" for the \"Impala\" publisher).\nannual editions of each magazine were analyzed (March and\nSeptember).\nAnalysis,coding,and validation procedures. The analysis pro-\ncedure consists of three main stages: (a) collection of maga-\nzines and the selection, within each magazine, of texts that\naddressed the theme of female sexuality; (b) transcription of\nall the identified texts (270); and (c) coding and analysis of\ndata using the NUD*IST 4 (Nonnumerical Unstructured\nData Index, Searching and Theorizing) software.\nAll coding was inductively derived using an inclusive\ncoding approach (Fielding, 1993) based on the principles of\ngrounded analysis (Strauss & Corbin, 1997). The coding unit\nwas the phrase.\nFor validation purposes, 10% of the texts were randomly\nselected and co-codified by a \"blind\" researcher, reaching an\nindex of fidelity of 0.8. This result was considered a substan-\ntial force of agreement.1\nResults\nDescriptive Presentation of Media Discourse\nA data analysis revealed substantial transformations in the\nmedia discourse about female sexuality over time.\nwhen present, they were mainly indirect, conveying a\nnegative connotation of feminine sexuality. The importance\nof a woman's virginity was stressed (8; \"It is better to be a\n`no' girl than a `yes' girl\"; \"To have fun with a girl is a fling;\nto marry her is another matter\"). Women's sexuality was only\naccepted within marriage and, even in this case, references\nto sexual life emerged only using covert language (\"The\nmarried couple should also reach physical harmony\").\nIn 1970, the number of references to the theme increased\n(23) and sexuality was described more explicitly. Sex was\nconsidered a basic need for men (2; \"Sometimes the hus-\nband's most pressing need is sex\") and a women's matrimo-\nnial duty, whose denial justifies male dissatisfaction and\neven infidelity (3; \"Some women don't understand the\nurgency of their husband's needs, and later they feel hurt and\nshocked when those needs cause him to pursue an affair\").\nWomen's virginity (10) remained an extremely valued\npersonal trait (\"Chastity or dignity--as you prefer to call it--\n. . . is the soul's beauty and a girl's delicacy\"). The defense of\ntime-honored moral values was reinforced through strict\nsocietal norms by which young women were expected to\nabide. This expectation was in clear contrast to the sexual\nperverseness that was thought to be taking place in other\nEuropean countries (8) (\"Living in a consumer society, hav-\ning money, being surrounded by an amoral culture, young\npeople aspire to a natural ideal . . . : God, Family, Work, and\nHomeland\").\nAfter the democratic revolution that occurred in Portugal\ndecreased (5), but their content changed substantially.\nSexuality was no longer understood as something negative\nor as a reason for feeling guilty (\"Physical understanding and\nloving accomplishment are not accompanied by guilty feel-\nings\"), and the need for sexual education was mentioned for\nthe first time (\"There isn't a rational preparation for marriage\nin many countries, and a few years ago, sexual subjects and\nthe teaching of certain hygienic precepts to young people\nwere considered awful\"). Some references to sexual pleasure\nand women's active role in sexuality appeared for the first\ntime (3; \"The woman should not have merely a passive role\nand should also achieve physical satisfaction\"). It should,\nhowever, be noted that sexuality remained linked only to the\nmarital couple and that the language used to describe it\nmainly emphasized the physiological dimension of sex (e.g.,\n\"hygienic precepts,\" \"physical reward\").\nThis period was also unique because of the emergence of\na critical discourse on women's social exploitation as sexual\nobjects (5; \"They are exploited as sexual objects by all\nconsumer society structures\"), namely, in the context of\nmedia discourse (6; \"Publicity is the most insidious means of\nperpetuating women's depreciative images as sexual symbols\nand inferior human beings\"). It is important to note that this\ncritical discourse will not reappear in the subsequent years of\nthis analysis.\nIn fact, during the 1980s, sexuality nearly disappeared\nfrom media discourse, apart from tenuous references to\nConde Dias et al. 5\nfemale contraception in 1980 (2; \"The doctor spoke to us\nabout the pill\"). In 1990, sexuality continued to be scarcely\nreferenced (6), even if sex was then, for the first time,\ndescribed as a central aspect of life (4; \"Sex is everywhere,\nand to speak of life is to speak of sex\"; \"sex is the cause of\nall pleasant and unpleasant things, of happiness and suicide,\nof connections and ruptures\").\nIn 1995, sexuality became a central theme in the maga-\nzines' discussion of affective relationships (140). Couples'\nsexuality was then described as a learning process (3; \"To\nlearn this language can take years\"), and sexual communica-\ntion was characterized as communication based on codes one\nshould learn to reach satisfaction and mutual understanding\n(13; \"Between husband and wife there is always a secret code\nto express what they want\"). There were recommendations\nfor a satisfactory sexual life that emphasized communication\n(\"Open communication is the best way of achieving a satis-\nfactory sexual life\") and romanticism (4).\nRegarding male sexuality, we found that men were\nunderstood to have higher levels of sexual interest and needs\nthan women (15; \"Most of the men are ready for immediate\nsexual relationships\"). Male worries about their sexual\nperformance and their fear of female evaluation were also\naddressed (3; \"A man is always concerned about a woman's\njudgment of his masculinity, of his performance, of his\npenis, of everything!\").\nAlthough with a critical tone, notions corroborating a tra-\nditional conception of gender roles during sex were con-\nveyed (9). These notions were either presented as male\ndysfunctional beliefs (\"When men begin to think about a\nwoman as their future wife, they may begin to treat her as\nsacred rather than sexy\") or as patterns of thinking involving\nfemale inadequacy (14; \"Instead of going to bed as the rap-\nturous and crazy woman she was when they met each other,\nshe now comes as a diligent and well-behaved wife, who\nbecomes disturbed by ardent sexual practices--because now\nshe is thinking about marrying him\"). Following the same\nrationale, women were portrayed as self-restraining and men\nas more prone to engaging in sex (12). This fact, however, is\nno longer presented as a natural occurrence but as a result of\nsocialization (\"Women are conditioned to wait, indepen-\ndently of what they feel, whereas men are not. For men, sex\nis good and that is reason enough for seeking it\"). Because of\nthis female restraint, women's sexual receptivity was\ndescribed as ambiguous (14; \"Many men think that women\nsend them ambiguous signs, and it becomes difficult to know\nif they want to say `no' or if they want to be persuaded\").\nThe double standard regarding sexuality was still present\nwhen discussing sexually transmitted diseases and their pre-\nvention. The use of condoms was mainly described as a\nmale reaction to the disease, and sexual \"withdrawal\" was\nportrayed as the predominantly female way of coping with\nthat risk (3; \"In the AIDS era, sex has some dangerous\nimplications, but most of the men handle this risk by using\ncondoms\"; \"Women also think about AIDS when they\ndecide to make love with a man. And they think about other\nsubtle implications of their sexual behavior. They ask if he\nwill continue to respect them; they think about whether they\nwill keep their self-respect and they think about the changes\nthat sex can bring to the relationship. Because of this, it is\nless probable that women `move forward' without further\nado. Women become reserved\").\nAdolescents' sexual initiation was also addressed for the\nfirst time in the mid-1990s. Sex with a boyfriend was then\npresented as something positive and natural, but only under\ncertain conditions: in the context of a loving relationship (7;\n\"If you are truly in love and he loves you\"), under absolute\ncertainty about the partner and the decision (8; \"If you are\ncompletely sure about wanting to do it,\" \"If you don't have\nany doubts about the person whom you chose\"), after pro-\nlonged discussion (3; \"If you and your boyfriend talked hon-\nestly enough about the subject\"), and if the girl had good\nself-esteem (5; \"Ifyoufeel goodabout yourbody\").Following\nthis logic, several pieces of advice were offered to girls about\nhow to resist pressure from their boyfriends (7; \"If he loves\nyou, he will wait\"). Curiously, despite the educational tone\nthese magazines adopt when addressing their audience, birth\ncontrol was only mentioned once (\"You should visit a Family\nPlanning Center or, at least, be seen by a gynecologist\").\nThis attention given to sexuality, especially adolescent\nzines provided advice regarding the girl's first time with her\nboyfriend (17), techniques on how to discover the boy's\nlevel of experience, and female initiative (7; \"Make the first\nmove: If you don't want to wait for his decision, you should\ngo for the attack\"). Woman's sexual pleasure was portrayed\nas something important (2; \"Enjoy every caress, every\nword\"), while contraception was scarcely mentioned\nalthough described as fundamental (2; \"Even if he takes an\noath that he will stop on time, or says that there is no danger\nbecause you are menstruating or because it is the first time,\nthere always exists the possibility of you becoming pregnant\nor of contracting an STD\").\nFinally, in 2005, the media continued to focus on sexual-\nity (92), not only in magazines for young girls but also in\nones for the adult public (male and female). For the first\ntime, male heterosexual prostitution was mentioned (4) and\nthe reasons behind women's desire for these sexual services\nwere discussed: as a means to achieve an affective relation-\nship (5), to save one's marriage, as a result of having marital\nproblems, or just because they fall in love with the man and/\nor with \"their athletic bodies.\" Ambiguity was evident in the\nmedia presentation of this theme. On one hand, the media\nsuggested that paying for sex is a form of sexual equality (4;\n\"Women should have the same rights as men\") but, on the\nother, the media emphasized the emotional needs of female\ncustomers and not their search for physical satisfaction.\nOn the whole, differences between female and male sexu-\nality were again emphasized, characterizing women as more\nreserved than men either because of biological reasons or\n6 SAGE Open\ncultural conditioning (4; \"For biological and social reasons,\nthe female impulse is more socialized, more repressed.\nHowever, the costs of an unwanted pregnancy are much\nhigher for women\"; \"Men are taught to achieve love through\nsex and women are taught to achieve sex through love\").\nIntegrative Analysis of the Results\nAs a second step in our analysis, we went back to the data to\nresolve three main research questions: (a) the possibility of\ndistinguishing different time periods in the media discourse\non sexuality, (b) the discursive continuities and discontinui-\nties that are present in these magazines, and (c) the discur-\nsive differences between magazines designed for different\ntarget audiences.\na. Discursive changes over time\nChanges in the number and content of references to sexu-\nality make it possible to differentiate three distinct periods in\ncharacterized by a \"traditional,\" negative discourse on sexu-\nality; (b) 1975 was an important year and a landmark of\nchange, with a more positive view of sexuality to be devel-\noped further in subsequent years; and (c) the years from 1975\nto the present were marked by the importance attributed to\nthis topic (especially since the 1990s) and by ambiguous\nlanguage, alternating between a \"liberated\" version of female\nsexuality and a permanent return to traditional gender roles\nand behavioral prescriptions for women.\nThese three periods directly correspond to the three dif-\nferent phases of recent sociopolitical life in Portuguese his-\ntory. In a more detailed analysis, magazine language in the\npresented female virginity and modesty as the main definer\nof a woman's social and moral values and as essential con-\nditions for marriage. Marriage, however, was perceived as a\nwoman's main objective in life and as her unique pathway\nto achieving social respectability and a personal sense of\naccomplishment and self-esteem. In this context, sex was\nconstructed as something dangerous for women, and female\nsexuality was seen as a source of vulnerability; on one hand,\na woman must be protected (by her family) and, on the other\nhand, the girl must restrain her own (rarely admitted) desire\nand simultaneously control her boyfriend's sexual impulses\nwithout seeming to reject him (\"say no with the mouth and\nyes with the eyes\"). This difficult equilibrium is presented\nby the media as the means to preserve and enhance girls'\nmoral and social values and to protect their opportunities in\nthe \"marriage market.\"\nIn 1975, the year after the democratic revolution in\nPortugal and when there were was a strong Communist\ninfluence on Portugal's government and political life, this\ndiscourse was substantially altered, with sexuality presented\nas a normal, physiological need for both men and women. At\nthis time, the media discourse adopted a normalizing and\neducational tone, presenting a positive image of sexuality\nthat clearly resonated with communist aesthetics of the body\n(functionality, strength, activity). This positive stance toward\nsex was not, however, free from ambiguity. The media essen-\ntially avoided the theme of female pleasure and instead\nfocused on the sexual exploitation of women. While it is\ncommendable that the media uncovered a widely known but\nunspoken reality, we must note that this theme once again\nresonates with the way communists perceive women as part\nof the explored classes, vulnerable not only by their lesser\nwages but also by the vulnerability caused by their gender. It\nmust be noted that the female body and sexuality were still\nconceived of as sources of vulnerability and powerlessness\nfor women (whereas the male body was represented as domi-\nnant, strong, and powerful).\nFrom 1980 to the present (years of consolidation of the\ndemocratic regime), the political tone of the 1975 language\nvanished and \"old\" notions (e.g., female sexual modesty, vir-\nginity) reappeared, coexisting with numerous references to\nwomen's sexual needs and rights, in a discourse marked by\nambiguity and inner contradictions.\nb. Changes and continuities in media discourse\nSignificant differences between the first years we ana-\nlyzed and the present are quite noticeable. These differences\nrefer both to the visibility of the theme in media discourse\nand to its content. Although sexuality was hardly ever men-\ntioned during the first years, it has proliferated in magazines\nThe discursive content is also quite different, as mentioned\nregarded as something to avoid and only conceivable within\nthe context of marriage, in 1975, sexuality appeared with a\npositive connotation. At present, it is presented in an ideal-\nized and romantic way in adult women's and adolescent mag-\nazines. Sexual life is not presented as restricted to married\ncouples, and marriage is no longer presented as the main goal\nof entering a relationship. Adolescent magazines note that\nadolescent girls may have several boyfriends and sexual part-\nners, and they focus on female sexual satisfaction, initiative,\nand pleasure. Female sexual satisfaction is, in fact, presented\nalmost as a duty or as a goal to be reached, and sexual perfor-\nmance is described as a central ingredient for women's self-\nesteem and sense of personal accomplishment and as essential\nto a normative and satisfactory intimate relationship.\nDespite these important changes, traditional notions\nabout female sexuality remain present, as shown in the\nfollowing example:\n1965: \"For marriage, they want a girl morally intact,\nbecause . . . to form a home and choose their chil-\ndren's mother--that is a serious thing!\"\nConde Dias et al. 7\n1995: \"Can a boy notice that you are no longer virgin?\nOr is possible to deceive him?\" \"Tell him that all\nyour sexual experience comes from hearing people\ntalk about it\"; \"Act coy when he tries to find out\nyour previous relationships.\"\nVirginity is one of these areas of discursive continuity,\neven though it is no longer viewed as a marker of a girl's\nmoral value. The emphasis is now placed on the social dis-\napproval that the knowledge of the girl's past could bring up\nand its effects on her present relationship with her boyfriend,\nassuming that he will be uncomfortable knowing about her\nsexual experiences. This orientation is thus more pragmatic\nthan moral, with girls being told that it is normal to have\nseveral sexual partners but that they should lie about the fact\n(\"act as if your boyfriend was the only one\").\nThe opposite occurs with male sexuality. Throughout the\nyears, the expectation has been for men to have many part-\nners, and this expectation is presented as something that is\nvalued by society and comprises a central ingredient of\nmasculinity:\n1965: \"A loyal husband is considered a silly man\"\n1995: \"He says that he already had sex with more than\nAnother area of continuity includes the conceptualiza-\ntion of female sexuality as inherently affective, or rather\nthe notion that it is difficult for women to detach sex from\nlove, while male sexuality is characterized by a \"physiolog-\nical\" need. In addition, men are presented as less worried\nabout finding a loving relationship and instead as actively\navoiding it.\n1970: \"She wants to keep herself so that she may\ngive herself as a gift to a true and complete love\";\n\"The woman doesn't understand the urgency of her\nhusband's needs . . . \"\n1995: \"`I want to make love to you' is a sentence\ncommonly used by men when they aren't actually\nthinking of love\"; \"That `monster' called commit-\nment makes me sick and gives me shivers down my\nspine.\"\nc. Discursive differences according to the magazine\nprofile\nIn the magazines we analyzed during the first years\nbefore the revolution, there were no differences between\npublication profiles. A probable explanation resides in the\nhegemonic political regime, which is characterized by cen-\nsorship mechanisms, a marked ideology around the theme of\n\"family values\" and the closed environment of Portugal\nregarding the significant social and cultural changes of the\nThe present discourse is much more heterogeneous and\ndiverse, and it is possible to identify discursive differences\nbetween publication profiles, these differences being stimu-\nlated by this ideological diversity and by a bigger specializa-\ntion of the mass media industry.\nFemale adolescents' magazines\nFemale adolescents' magazines are, by far, the ones in\nwhich the topic of sexuality is most prevalent. As in other\nRibeiro, 2005), it is possible to observe the conflict arising\nfrom plural and contradictory notions of sexuality (e.g., the\nideas that girls are sexually active and must take the first\nstep toward intimacy co-occur with concerns about virginity\nand the alleged need for girls to hide their previous sexual\nexperiences). The focus of many articles is on the girl's deci-\nsion to initiate sexual activities, which is addressed through\nan instructional approach marked by numerous pieces of\nadvice (e.g., choose a loving partner, be comfortable with\nyour body, do not rush into a relationship).\nIn these publications, sex is conceptualized as a technique\nor \"ability,\" something that can be learned and taught. Girls\nare given clear instructions about sex, assuming that they do\nnot have information from other sources (friends, school,\nfamily). However, girls are told to instruct their boyfriends\nabout how boys should act with them.\nAnother common theme found in these magazines is the\nnotion that sexuality is placed on the affective/emotional\nrealm of experience. Sexuality is linked with a long-lasting\nrelationship, and sex is presented as something special,\nassociated with feelings of love, confidence, and respect.\nThis type of language suggests that love is the most appro-\npriate or most desirable context for sex. This suggestion\ndoes not mean that casual sex is not possible, but that it is a\nless desirable one, one that girls need to differentiate from\n\"special\" sex. Furthermore, casual sex can create problems\nthat girls have the responsibility to manage effectively.\nRomantic love is, in fact, presented in teen magazines as an\nideal to which girls should aspire in their daily lives and use\nto make decisions during difficult situations (infidelity,\nfights) with their boyfriends, especially regarding the deci-\nsion on whether to engage in sex.\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that while teenagers'\nmagazines tend to focus on sexuality and sexual initiation,\ntheir actual discussions of safe sex are quite scarce, and the\nemphasis on sexuality overshadows other important areas of\nteenagers' lives (e.g., school, family, friends).\nWomen's versus men's magazines\nDuring the last few years, it is obvious that women's and\nmen's magazines marketed for an affluent audience focus\nmore on the analysis of gender differences. Both magazines\n8 SAGE Open\nclaim that these differences are explained by cultural and\nbiological factors but still conceptualize female sexuality as\ninherently affective and describe male sexuality as a physi-\nological function.\nDouble standards regarding sexuality also persist: Having\nmany sexual experiences and partners is presented as legiti-\nmate and positive for men, whereas women must restrict\ntheir sexual experiences to fewer relations with romantic\nmeaning:\nMen's magazine: \"What do males and females search\nfor? Males: sex! They keep improving their tech-\nnique without scruples; Females: an ideal partner . .\n. sex is important but only if there is commitment\"\nWomen's magazine: \"Because men usually desire\nsexual relations earlier than women do, they will\nsometimes insist with them or pressure them for\nsex\"; \"Women want a relationship in romantic\nterms.\"\nBoth publication profiles associate sexual initiative/\nperformance with masculinity, conferring an active role to\nmen, while assigning a receptive/passive role to women\n(\"Most men are ready for immediate sexual relations\";\n\"Women are conditioned to wait, no matter how they feel\ntowards the subject\").\nDespite this common focus in both publication profiles,\nwe also found specificities that are exclusive to each maga-\nzine. One of those unique aspects is that the discourse on the\nso-called \"sexual ambiguity of women\" appears only in\nwomen's magazines, formulated in a way that makes women\nresponsible for clearly expressing their preferences to avoid\nmale misinterpretation and hurting their partner's feelings:\n\"Given the different expectations, perhaps it is better\nfor a woman to declare her intentions to him earlier--\nbefore they go to his house, for example, or before\nthey go beyond the kissing phase. Tell him that you\nlike him, but that you aren't ready for more.\"\nHowever, the men's magazine distinguishes itself by a\nnegative portrayal of women and their sexuality, either\ndescribing it as a means women use to achieve control and\npower in relationships (\"Women can be controlling of men.\nIt is as if women told us, `if you do what I want, I'll go to bed\nwith you'\") or pointing out women's sexual inhibitions\n(\"Women hide, even from themselves, their desires and sex-\nual fantasies\").\nThe reference to violent sexual practices is also exclusive\nto this magazine profile, while stressing the \"make believe\"\nand \"controlled\" character of these behaviors, and presenting\nthem in an educational tone (\"Before beginning, agree on a\n\"word of safety\" for the other to always know when to stop.\nThe word no can be an integral part of the fantasy. For that,\nyou need to certify that the password is something totally out\nof the context\").\nDiscussion\nMedia discourse on sexuality underwent great transforma-\ntions throughout the years included in our analysis, both in\nits frequency and in its content. In global terms, a discursive\ninversion seems to have happened. The fascist era was char-\nacterized by sexual repression, negative connotations of sex,\nand its restriction to the marriage realm, whereas the present\ntime is characterized by the proliferation of discourses about\nsex, both romanticized/idealized and \"taught\" as if it were a\ntechnique.\nWith regard to the fascist era, we cannot forget the politi-\ncal regime of the \"Estado Novo\": It was an authoritarian,\nconservative, nationalist, and corporate regime, fascist-\ninspired, Catholic and very traditionalist, which prevailed in\nCruz, 1982). The regime has created its own state structure\nand repressive apparatus (PIDE [Pol\u00edcia Internacional e de\nDefesa do Estado], penal colony for political prisoners, etc.).\nIt was a police state that relied on censorship, propaganda,\nparamilitary organizations (Portuguese Legion), juvenile\norganizations (Portuguese Youth), the cult of the leader, and\nTherefore, the absence of female sexuality in publications\nuntil 1975 and the extreme suppression/annulation of women\n(viewed as inferior, devoted to her husband and children, and\npure and chaste like the Virgin Mary until their marriage)\nhave to be understood under the ideology of the \"Estado\nNovo\": (a) with a Catholic ideology, there was an alliance\nbetween the state and the Catholic Church (Braga da Cruz,\n1982); (b) because of the political propaganda and censor-\nship of periodicals, radio, and television, the state controlled\nthe content of every publication in the country to \"protect\"\nits ideology defending \"the moral and good behaviors\"\nyouth organizations (Portuguese Youth) to teach young peo-\nple the ideology advocated by the regime and teach them to\nobey and respect the leader and the church (Pimentel, 2000);\nand (d) the educational system was controlled by the regime\n(a nationalist and ideological education) and focuses on the\nexaltation of national values (e.g., past history, the great\nPortuguese Colonial Empire, religion, tradition, customs,\nservice to the country, human solidarity from a Christian per-\nspective, the attachment to the land and family, etc.) and\nfocuses on teaching and disseminating the state and catholic\nThus, in this context, sexuality was conceptualized as\nsomething negative and prohibited for women. On the con-\ntrary, sexuality was permitted and encouraged in men, and\nsociety distinguished between women who marry (pure and\nchaste) and women who have fun.\nConde Dias et al. 9\nWith regard to the current situation, sexual satisfaction\nis now conceptualized as a central aspect in the construc-\ntion of one's identity, being construed as both a woman's\ngoal and duty.\nAlthough this conceptualization seems to confirm the idea\nthat the present era is characterized by sexual \"liberation\"\nthe social regulation of sexuality is also quite evident; it was\na regulation that changed from repression and moral censure\n(in the years of the fascist regime), to a form of regulation (in\nthe democratic years) that operates through the internalized\ncontrol of women and organized around ideals of health, sat-\nisfaction, and self-esteem, as noted by Foucault (1976). This\nanalysis is reinforced by the numerous ambiguities and con-\ntradictions that permeate this discourse, again consistent with\nwhat other studies have proven (Cancian & Gordon, 1988;\nThere is tension between describing women as more \"natu-\nrally\" reserved and the prescriptions to be \"more active\";\nthere is conflict between the social censure of women's pro-\nmiscuity and the construction gender equality as the norm;\nthere is a contradiction between viewing adolescents who\nhave several sexual partners as acceptable and suggesting that\nthey not reveal that to their boyfriend. Furthermore, success\nin love/sexual relationships is still construed as being a wom-\nan's responsibility, linked to her ability to regulate herself and\nthe other person, to make good decisions, and to choose the\n\"right\" way to behave. This finding reinforces the idea that,\nwhile sex is not an interdict anymore, it did not become \"free\"\nor \"liberated.\" As Foucault emphasized, the proliferation of\ndiscourses on sex that we observe in today's magazines con-\nstitutes an arena for an even more complex regulation of sex-\nuality: a territory of prescriptions, techniques, and careful\nchoices that continue to separate \"good\" from \"bad\" women.\nWithin this ambiguous framework, it seems important to\nhighlight the recurrent emphasis on the supposed difficulty\nof women in separating sex from affect. The romantic dis-\ncourse on the \"specialness\" of sex helps to reinforce this\nidea: For women, sex is represented as a way to share and to\nlove, and it is this love/affect that makes women's sexual\npractices \"special\" and \"positive.\" This romanticization of\nsex appears to constitute a discursive mechanism to reduce\nthe tension between traditional and modern discourses on\nwomen's sexuality.\nThis discourse has a prescriptive nature, but it is not for-\nmulated in an authoritarian voice; the imperatives that char-\nacterized the prerevolutionary years are currently substituted\nby a tolerant and educational discourse, which establishes\npreferences within a framework that recognizes some\nvariety of sexual practices and relational contexts. Women\nare, therefore, encouraged to experience their sexuality in a\nloving/long-term relationship (although casual/short-term\nrelationships are accepted); exclusivity and monogamy are\npresented as the ideal (despite recognizing the possibility of\nbreaking-up, infidelity, and serial relationships); and the\ndecision to engage in sex, especially for the first time, is\ncharacterized as crucial and requires certainty and careful\nreasoning.\nIn this process, the discourse directed at female adoles-\ncents merits particular attention, because it is in this publica-\ntion profile that sexual concerns are more evident, as has been\nfound in other studies (e.g., Gavey & McPhilips, 1999;\nis also important to study this discourse because these maga-\nzines are directed at an age group for which the social regula-\ntion of sexuality becomes more evident than ever and the\nconstruction of female sexual subjectivity is potentially con-\nsolidated. Many authors indicate the importance of the mass\nazines symbolize an important way to produce, define, and\nreinforce ideals regarding how an adolescent female and an\nadult woman should behave sexually.\nThis trend clearly relates to the focus on girls'decisions to\ninitiate sexual life. As mentioned previously regarding maga-\nzines'discussions of female sexuality, the permanent associa-\ntion between sex and affect is also stressed in adolescent\nmagazines, placing love as the appropriate or more desirable\ncontext for sex, as though love were the \"excuse\" to engage\nin sex without losing self and social respect. We considered\nthat this speech constitutes an attempt to reconcile or dimin-\nish the tension between traditional visions of female adoles-\ncent sexuality (virginity as a value, fear of social censure) and\nthe supposed sexual \"freedom\" of the present time.\nRegarding the comparison of magazine profiles by gender,\nit is clear that gender differences are portrayed with essential-\nism, as something stable, enduring, and internal (caused by\nbiological constitution or by the internalization of social roles\nand discourses). The same happens with the persistence of\ndouble standards of sexuality, namely, through traditional\nnotions of male activity and sexual dominance and female\npassiveness and sexual reserve. These findings are consistent\nwith the findings in other studies (Crawford & Popp, 2003;\nIn addition to this common focus in both publication pro-\nfiles, the specificities of each magazine also reinforce tradi-\ntional sexual roles. The discourse on women's sexual\nambiguity in women's magazines forces women to shoulder\nthe burden of managing their own and their partner's emo-\ntions, while encouraged to attend to men's needs and provide\nfor their emotional comfort. This expectation resonates with\ntraditional notions that women are more competent than men\nin the emotional realm and also with the idea that it is a wom-\nan's responsibility to take care of other people's emotional\nwell-being. Many authors consider that these ideas, if taken\nto an extreme, may make women feel pressured into having\nsex to keep the relationship alive and not hurt their partners,\nand may even facilitate male sexual coercion (Jackson &\nAnother important aspect of men's magazines is that they\nconvey a negative portrayal of women and their sexuality and\nexpress the belief that women use sex as a form to exert con-\ntrol and power over men. This message has important impli-\ncations: On one hand, it limits women's influence and power\nto the sexual sphere, implying that their other capacities and\naptitudes are negligible; on the other hand, it propagates the\nrepresentation of men as those who withhold and control\nresources, power, and decision-making in relationships. The\nonly way women may have access to that power is through\nsubtle persuasion techniques acquired by having sex.\nFinally, another important characteristic of men's maga-\nzines is the reference to violent sexual practices. While stress-\ning the \"make believe\" characteristic of these behaviors and\nassuming an \"educational\" tone in their articles, this reference\nmay be interpreted as male concerns about the current social\nchallenges to male control and power and over dominant con-\nstructions of masculinity (Barker & Loewenstein, 1997; Fine,\nThis analysis showed that although there are significant\nchanges over the last 40 years in the way women's sexuality\nis talked about in media discourse, including less repressive\ndiscourse, many traditional gender expectations and sexual\ndifferences between men and women persist. The social and\ninternalized control over women's sexuality is still pervasive,\nalthough it is not exerted through such coercive means as\nbefore. This change constitutes a clear example of Foucault's\ndecades, moving away from a repressive form of control,\nwhich was centered on the body, to a subtle, diffused, perva-\nsive, and internalized pattern of control that is mostly exerted\nthrough self-regulation and directed to the \"soul.\"\nOn a more alarming note, we also found that some of\nthese discourses can legitimize female sexual submission or\neven male sexual coercion over women. We hope that this\nattempt at deconstructing media discourse has contributed to\na better understanding of the ways social control over female\nsexuality has changed over time and how it functions during\nthe present day, while contributing to the reinforcement of\ndifferent and less prescriptive discourses on this theme. It is\nour expectation that such discursive changes may contribute\nto opening up new spaces, for both women and men, to con-\nstrue freer and preferential avenues of communication and\nsatisfaction in their intimate relationships.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nNotes\n 1.
