Although not\nalways explicit in Bourdieu's work, the respective forms of\ncultural capital only exist in relation to and through (differ-\nent) cultures--here understood as pervious, evolving, more\nor less consciously learned, and more or less closely\n\"shared\" frames of perception, thought, and (inter)action\nthat are both shaped by and shape their (histories of) objec-\ntification and institutionalization.\nWhile it might be true that certain expressions of cultural\nlearnedness--familiarity with \"classic\" music and literature,\nfor example--constitute today less pertinent sources of\nsociocultural distinction than at the time when Bourdieu ana-\nlyzed fields of struggle over (symbolic) power, little points at\na more general decline in the (inter)personal and societal rel-\nevance of cultural capital. Quite to the contrary, in fact,\ncountless research endeavors across cultural and disciplinary\nboundaries provide compelling evidence of the enduring\nexplanatory value of \"cultural capital variables\".1\nIn an ever more interdependent world, intercultural capi-\ntal emerges as an increasingly significant type of cultural\ncapital and marker of sociocultural distinction. Its manifesta-\ntions at the level of objectification include monuments with\nimportant intercultural connotations such as The Mother of\nHumanity\u00ae sculpture in Los Angeles (USA), the Way of\nHuman Rights in Nuremberg (Germany), and the Monument\nto Multiculturalism in Toronto (Canada); international agree-\nments or declarations with inherent intercultural dimensions\nsuch as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; com-\nmemorative days such as the International Day for the\nElimination of Racial Discrimination on March 21, World\nPeace Day on September 21, or Human Rights Day on\nDecember 10th that are acknowledged across cultural bound-\naries around the globe; institutions and organizations with a\nstrong intercultural underpinning (e.g., bi- or multilingual\nschools, intercultural universities, the European Court of\nHuman Rights, or the United Nations); as well as books,\narticles, pamphlets, reports, speeches, and other academic or\nnonacademic publications with an intercultural outlook.\n1Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales (Mexico City), Mexico.\nCorresponding Author:\nAndreas P\u00f6llmann, Facultad Latinoamericana de Ciencias Sociales,\nCarretera al Ajusco 377, Colonia H\u00e9roes de Padierna, Delegaci\u00f3n Tlalpan,\nEmail: apollm@daad-alumni.de\nIntercultural Capital:Toward the\nConceptualization, Operationalization, and\nEmpirical Investigation of a Rising Marker of\nSociocultural Distinction\nAndreas P\u00f6llmann1\n Keywords\nBourdieu, intercultural capital, realization, recognition, sociocultural inequalities, (symbolic) power\n2 SAGE Open\nWith official endorsement, such objectified forms of\nintercultural capital can gain legitimacy and become more\nreadily recognized across cultural boundaries. For instance,\nwhen Nuremberg received the UNESCO Prize for Human\nRights Education, the aforementioned Way of Human Rights\nwas internationally acknowledged as an important part of the\ncity's accomplishments--and thus decorated with a form of\ninstitutionalized intercultural capital. In a similar vein, insti-\ntutions of formal education can enhance \"ordinary\" individ-\nual-level manifestations of embodied intercultural capital\n(e.g., language skills, intercultural friendships, or experi-\nences of living abroad) through authoritative and lasting offi-\ncial testimonies and certifications.\nEven if the inter in intercultural capital emphasizes the\nsphere of relationships and relationalities between (different)\ncultures, it deliberately does so without neglecting \"cultural\nparticularities\". In fact, all forms of intercultural capital are\nalso forms of cultural capital in that they are particular to the\ncultures in relation to and through which they have emerged.\nAnd all forms of cultural capital are also forms of intercul-\ntural capital given that the cultures in relation to and through\nwhich they have emerged constitute, to a greater or lesser\nextent, a product of intercultural contact and \"mixing\".\nWhat distinguishes cultural and intercultural forms of\ncapital is their relative degree of field-transcendence. For\nBourdieu, capital, in its various forms, constitutes \"an energy\nwhich only exists and only produces its effects in the field in\nwhich it is produced and reproduced\" (Bourdieu, 1984, p.\n113) and, consequently, tends to lose force with increasing\ndistance from the field(s) of its (re)production. Intercultural\ncapital, to the contrary, functions as a potent marker of socio-\ncultural distinction within a wider range of contexts of (re)\nproduction and is likely to retain, or indeed enhance, its\nexchange value when \"moved\" across more distant fields.\nThe focus of the present article lies on intercultural capi-\ntal in the embodied state, which may, at first glance, appear\nas yet another linguistic variant of similar and already well-\nestablished terminologies such as intercultural competence,\nintercultural communication skills, or intercultural sensitiv-\nity. In fact, the notion of embodied intercultural capital--to\nwhich, for the remainder of this article, I will simply refer to\nas intercultural capital--expressly entails intercultural\nskills, competencies, and sensitivities. However, inspired by\nBourdieu's work, it does not solely relate to intercultural\nproficiencies as such,2 but also to their relative exchange\nvalue and the circumstances under which they are more or\nless likely to be realized.\nThe subsequent discussion first looks at the notion of\n\"intercultural capital realization\", with a view on the benefits\nthat it may bring about. It then moves on to illustrate why\nsome people can be considered as better positioned to realize\nintercultural capital than others. The article proceeds with a\nfocus on potential operational \"measures\" and promising\nareas of application in empirical research, before revisiting\nsome important points by way of conclusion.\nThe Realization of Intercultural\nCapital and Its Potential Benefits\nIntercultural capital can be realized in terms of (a combina-\ntion of) awareness, acquisition, and application, as outlined\nin Table 1.\nWhile the full realization of intercultural capital involves\na certain degree of awareness of what may be at stake, the\nlack of it does not necessarily preclude effective acquisitions\nand applications, particularly in cases where people's socio-\ncultural environment favors habitual and largely taken-for-\ngranted processes of capital embodiment.\nThe kinds of sociocultural environment in which intercul-\ntural capital may be acquired en passant, so to speak, can\nrange from poorly financed state community centers in cul-\nturally diverse working class neighborhoods to lavish inter-\nnational management training programs for \"global business\nleaders\". Even if the former source of intercultural capital\nacquisition is as such (i.e., in ontological terms) no less\n\"valuable\" than the latter, it is unlikely to be as highly prized,\nwidely recognized, and easily convertible (i.e., into eco-\nnomic capital).\nBecause intercultural capital (as all cultural capital) tends\nto operate \"as symbolic capital, i.e., to be unrecognized as\nfinancial profits even (or particularly) when these are not\ndirectly evident. But intercultural capital--when embodied\nin form of a more or less consciously learned and habituated\nintercultural know-how--as a practical intercultural sense,\ncan offer more than a set of economically viable skills that\nallow their respective bearers to successfully compete in\nglobal markets. It can complement \"original\" cultural per-\nspectives without imposing a need to abandon them in favor\nof assimilation to \"new\" ones. And by doing so, it may lead\npeople to appreciate cultural diversity and develop an under-\nstanding for previously unfamiliar and perhaps \"strange\"\nsituations and contexts.\nAs a solid body of research in the area of intergroup con-\ntact theory suggests, the kinds of personal encounter with\nextraordinary and previously unfamiliar customs, environ-\nments, people, or languages, which lie at the heart of the\nrealization of intercultural capital, can render significant\nTable 1.

Before attending to issues of operationalization and\nempirical application, let us take a look at a number of\ninterrelated factors that are likely to influence people's\nchances of realizing intercultural capital and the benefits\nthat it may bring about.\nWho Is in a Position to Realize\nIntercultural Capital?\nThe realization of (inter)cultural capital is inherently \"linked\nIndeed, it always takes effect through somebody's biologi-\ncally mediated (history of) individual practice--including\ndeliberate reflections as well as less conscious and often\ntaken-for-granted \"manners of being, seeing, acting and\nlikely extent of individual capital realization cannot be\nmeaningfully evaluated based on the analysis of individual\ncharacteristics (e.g., age and gender) and practice alone, but\nis better thought of as the product of interrelated individual\nand environmental factors, as indicated in Figure 1.\nPeople's family background and upbringing no doubt\nplay a crucial part in the course of their educational forma-\nThose who can draw on a domestic inheritance of highly val-\nued and widely convertible economic, social, and (inter)cul-\ntural capital will be more likely to accumulate highly prized\nand widely transferable varieties of intercultural capital, and\ntake advantage of their accumulation, than others who do not\nenjoy such privileges (P\u00f6llmann, 2009). But even in cases\nwhere a supportive and well-positioned family network pro-\nvides access to \"a share in the sum of the assets of all its\npersonal intercultural capital can still vary significantly--\nlargely depending on their actual or perceived affiliation\nwith ethnic, linguistic, national, racial, religious, or other\ngroups--and particularly in a climate of group-specific dom-\nination and marginalization.\nMore than three decades ago, Hall (1976) pointed out that\n\"the many gifts and talents of women, blacks, Native\nAmericans, Spanish-Americans and others are not only unrec-\nognized, but frequently denigrated by members of the domi-\nnant group\" (p. 7). Today as in the 1970s, in the United States\nof America and elsewhere, group-specific \"hierarchies\" can\nhave a detrimental impact on people's opportunities in life, not\nonly in circumstances of blatant exclusionism and discrimina-\ntion (e.g., during the South African Apartheid regime), but\nalso through more concealed forms of exclusion and disad-\nvantage due to a lack of recognition of group-specific rights\nEssentially, members of marginalized groups can pursue\nthree courses of action to enhance their chances of realizing\nintercultural capital: they can undertake to change their\ngroup affiliations; they can join into struggles over the rec-\nognition and appreciation of their particular (inter)cultural\nexperiences and skills; or they can endeavor to challenge and\nchange the often taken-for-granted practices and (unspoken)\nIndividual\nCharacteristics/Practice\nFamilial\nCapital Resources\nRealization of\nIntercultural Capital\nGroup\nMemberships\nFields of Struggle over\n(Symbolic) Power\nFigure 1. The realization of intercultural capital as the product of four interrelated factors.\n4 SAGE Open\nrules that are sustained by and sustain established sociocul-\ntural divisions of (symbolic) power.\nTo be sure, as much as groups can be empowering,\ndiverse, and open to change, they can be constraining, total-\nizing, and inflexible. But they hardly ever make up entirely\nhomogeneous and fully unified wholes in which individual\nmembers amalgamate into a mysterious collective (Benhabib,\n2009). More often than not, different people will have differ-\nent ideas about the meanings and purpose of the groups to\nwhich they (are perceived to) belong. They may feel strongly\nattached to some groups, while hardly taking notice of\n\"objectively\" existing links to others. They may dissociate\nthemselves from previous group affiliations and, possibly,\ndevelop a desire to engage in new ones.\nGroup membership is, however, not in all instances, and\nnot only, a matter of personal choice. If it was, it would\nindeed be fairly easy for people to change their respective\naffiliations and thus their relative chances of realizing inter-\ncultural capital. In fact, however, external evaluations of an\nindividual's (alleged) group membership(s) can persist even\nif they are at odds with his or her actual personal situation\nand choices. For those concerned, such a lack of \"evaluative\ncongruence\" constitutes no trivial matter. As much as posi-\ntive external evaluations can encourage and facilitate, nega-\ntive stereotypes and prejudice can discourage and\nimmobilize--particularly if they become internalized with\neffects on people's self-perception and self-esteem (Taylor,\nAs it happens, people often choose to assert rather than\nto change their affiliations with different groups.

They have to be fought for and,\nwhat is just as difficult, sustained. This calls for a\npositive identity among the inferiorized groups, and\nhence a cultural struggle both within the groups and in\nFor (members of) inferiorized groups, a vital part of this\nstruggle consists in affirming that it is much less a shortage\nof domestic and cultural resources that accounts for their\nmarginalization, but the lack of sociocultural recognition and\nappreciation of these resources as legitimate and valuable--\na point forcefully developed in various critiques of group-\nspecific stereotyping and \"deficit thinking\" within the field\nof formal education (Moll, Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez, 1992;\nThe prospects of individual or collective demands for the\nrecognition and appreciation of a wider range of (hitherto\nmarginalized) varieties of domestic and cultural resources\nwill vary from context to context, and particularly\nacross different states. As the holders \"of the monopoly of\nics in original), states represent a prime force in the shaping\nof sociocultural categorizations and divisions, be it explicitly\nand formally by authorizing legal provisions and laws\n(Bourdieu, 1986a), or less overtly, but often no less effec-\ntively, within other fields of struggle over (symbolic)\npower--including the realms of formal education (Bourdieu\nlanguage and communication (Bourdieu, 1991b), religion\nWhenever the (symbolic) \"power to impose the legitimate\nvision of the social world . . . its present meaning and the\ndirection in which it is going and should go\" (Bourdieu,\nals and groups will have more opportunities to accumulate\nintercultural capital than others. And even if they realize\nonly comparatively little intercultural capital in terms of\nawareness and acquisition, its relative currency value--that\nis its realizability in terms of application--would still be\nlikely to exceed that of others, whose personal stock of inter-\ncultural capital may be nominally larger, but is being greatly\ndevalued by their unfavorable sociocultural positioning.\nWe will return to questions of realization and realizability\nin the concluding section. First, however, let us consider\nsome ideas as to how possible operationalizations of the con-\ncept of intercultural capital may look like and across which\ntypes of research the respective empirical indicators might\nbe applied. After all, theoretical concepts and propositions\n\"are designed to be put to work empirically in systematic\nfashion\" (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992, p. 96, italics in origi-\nnal) rather than to be treated as ends in themselves.3\nOperational \"Measures\" and Areas\nof Application in Empirical Research\nA recent survey on (supra)national forms of attachment\namong school leaders in Berlin and London (P\u00f6llmann,\nalized as a combination of the number of spoken foreign\nlanguages (\"none\", \"one\", or \"two or more\"), intercultural\nfriendships (\"none at all\", \"a few\", or \"several\"), and expe\nrience of living abroad (\"none\", \"less than 1 year\", \"1 to 4\nyears\", or \"5 years or longer\")--can have a significant\nexplanatory impact.4 The scope of these indicators could,\nno doubt, be further developed--particularly in terms of\ntheir analytic depth. For instance, in addition to considering\nwhether and how long people say they have been living\nabroad, it would be interesting to also look at both the spe-\ncific type of living experience (e.g., during holidays, in the\ncourse of an international student exchange program, or as\nthe result of an international work placement) and the pos-\nsible learning outcomes (e.g., indicated by the level of\nknowledge about another country before and after living\nabroad). In a similar vein, instead of merely focusing on the\nnumber of intercultural friends, one may dig deeper to learn\nP\u00f6llmann 5\nmore about the sociocultural backgrounds of the respective\nfriends and the subjectively perceived quality of their\nfriendship.\nOther possible operationalizations could take account of\nthe different states of realization (i.e., Table 1); the degree of\nfield-transcendence; the length of acquisition, which\nBourdieu (1986b) conceived as \"the least inexact of all the\nmeasurements of cultural capital\" (p. 244); and the mode of\nacquisition, considering direct personal experiences (e.g.,\nthrough intercultural marriage or international migration) as\nwell as more indirect forms of intercultural learning (e.g., via\nbooks, television, or the Internet)--bearing in mind that\n\"mediate, knowing acquisition will always differ from an\nimmediate familiarity with the native culture\" (Bourdieu,\nIn the end, the number and complexity of operational\n\"measures\" for the concept of intercultural capital will vary\ndepending on the specific subject under consideration and\nthe respective theories and methods employed in the course\nof its investigation. A comparative cross-national survey\nproject on people's intercultural experiences and skills, for\nexample, is unlikely to involve the same set of empirical\nindicators as an in-depth ethnographic study of intercultural\nencounters within a particular local community. Apart from\nits practical necessity, such flexibility at the level of opera-\ntionalization prevents from limiting the notion of intercul-\ntural capital to a singular (essentialized) set of connotations\nand, by doing so, allows it to appeal across cultural and dis-\nciplinary boundaries.\nThe concept of intercultural capital lends itself to various\npromising empirical applications--both as an explanatory\nfactor and as a phenomenon to be explained. When consid-\nered as an explanatory factor, its potential impact could be\nexamined in relation to a range of contemporary social prob-\nlems, such as ethnocentrism, racism, religious intolerance,\nand xenophobia. When treated as a phenomenon to be\nexplained, its relative degree of realization in terms of aware-\nness, acquisition, and application (i.e., Table 1) could be\ntaken into account and examined as a function of any one or\na combination of the factors outlined in Figure 1.\nIn quantitative social research, empirical \"measures\" of\nintercultural capital could serve as predictors of educational\nsuccess (Nu\u00f1ez, 2009), transnational employability, or atti-\ntudes toward cultural diversity, foreigners, ethnic minorities,\nand immigrants--to name only a few possible examples. At\npresent, however, the necessary large-scale survey data are\nrelatively scarce. The regular incorporation of \"intercultural\ncapital variables\" in cross-national survey programs such as\nthe European Social Survey, the World Values Survey, or the\nInternational Social Survey Programme would largely\nenhance the analytical scope of quantitative social research,\nincluding possibilities for multilevel data analyses and sys-\ntematic comparisons over time.\nWhile statistical analyses of social survey data are par-\nticularly well suited to examine the relative explanatory\nvalue of \"intercultural capital variables\", more interpretive\nsocial research strategies (e.g., life history interviews, par-\nticipatory observation, or focus group interviews) allow for\nfurther and more in-depth insights--not only into how the\nembodiment of intercultural capital may affect people's\nlives, but also on factors that may enable or constrain its real-\nization (i.e., Figure 1) in terms of awareness, acquisition, and\napplication (i.e., Table 1).\nWhether treated as an explanatory factor or as a phenom-\nenon to be explained, the notion of intercultural capital is\nneither exclusively suited to qualitative applications nor\nsolely reserved to be used in the context of quantitative anal-\nyses. Indeed, to apply the concept across cultural and disci-\nplinary boundaries, and to take full advantage of its heuristic\npotential, requires problem-oriented research strategies\nrather than rigid theoretical frameworks and methodological\nfetishisms.\nHaving introduced the forms of intercultural capital,\nemphasized the particular significance of embodied intercul-\ntural capital--its potential benefits, as well as factors that\nmay enable or constrain its realization--and discussed pos-\nsible applications at the level of empirical research, I would\nlike to conclude this article with a brief outlook on some\nearlier points.\nConclusion\nThe realization of intercultural capital can, no doubt, help\npeople of various backgrounds to develop a practical inter-\ncultural sense for the globally interconnected world which\nthey inhabit--and by doing so pave the way for considerable\n(inter)personal and societal benefits. In many places around\nthe world, however, the most highly esteemed, institution-\nally certified, and (thus) most widely convertible types of\nintercultural capital are being realized by the few rather than\nthe many. Even within the comparatively prosperous and\nenabling context of the European Union, the kind of inter-\nculturally mobile lifestyles, which can be expected to facili-\ntate the realization of intercultural capital, are\noverproportionately associated with higher levels of socio-\neconomic status and majority ethno-racial backgrounds\nTaking into consideration that those who have already real-\nized comparatively high levels of highly valued and widely\nconvertible (officially recognized) intercultural capital are\nlikely to realize even more of it with more ease, such sys-\ntematic inequalities may well exacerbate rather than dimin-\nish over time.\nAs we have seen, whether and how easily intercultural\ncapital can be realized is neither simply a question of luck or\ngood fortune, nor primarily the result of differences in indi-\nvidual characteristics and efforts. It depends to an important\nextent on a range of environmental factors. The more, for\ninstance, domestic capital resources, group memberships,\nand the respective field conditions favor a habitual, effort-\nless, and largely taken-for-granted embodiment of highly\nprized and widely convertible intercultural capital, the more\n6 SAGE Open\nawareness is relatively dispensable. In comparatively less\nfavorable circumstances, on the contrary, conscious individ-\nual or collective struggles for recognition, appreciation, and\na more equal distribution of (symbolic) power become all the\nmore important.\nAs long as large parts of the world remain ridden with\nprofound sociocultural inequalities, it would be na\u00efve, or at\nleast premature, to mistake processes of intercultural capital\nrealization and their possible (inter)personal and societal\nbenefits for the dawn of a new age of \"intercultural person\nhood\". Instead, to avoid undue generalizations and rushed\nconclusions, both the conditions and potential impact of\nintercultural capital embodiment are best conceived in terms\nof degree and probability, where different people can be con-\nsidered as more or less likely to (be able to) possess so and\nso much intercultural capital, of this or that empirical variety,\nat different points of realization, and of more or less widely\ntransferable (institutionally certified) currency value.\n"
