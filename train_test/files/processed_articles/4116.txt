We suppose that since this\ncapacity demands refined mental traits, it is a subjective topic that is inaccessible to\nscientific analysis. Unfortunately, such a perspective precludes gaining an understanding of\nthe roots of possibly one of our more defining characteristics, one that has implications for\nour art, culture and civilization.\nAesthetics concerns our sense of what is beautiful. But what is beauty? It has been\nvariously described as the sole propriety of a beholder, and being skin-deep on the one\nhand as well as \"the substance of God\" on the other. Beauty is also the harmonious\nrelationship of facts, ideas and lines and color combinations that make a picture, story or\ntheory out of chaos, which by our sense of aesthetics, approaches what some define as\n\"truth.\" Godfrey Hardy (1877-1947) applied truth to mathematics, where the beauty in\nformulas is \"as harmonic as color and words.\" What wasn't true, wasn't beautiful. To the\nphysicist Paul Dirac (1937-1984) beauty was truth, as when he quipped: \"It is more\nimportant that the formulas are beautiful, than that the experiments fit.\" But truth makes\nbeauty, not the other way round, as the biologist Thomas Huxley (1825-1895) notes in his\nfamous epigram: \"Many a beautiful theory is felled by an ugly fact.\" Facts are often\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nunpleasant but they are never ugly, and they can be used to create beauty. But the\nunderlying principle of beauty is still relationships, either of facts, bits of sound, paint, or\nany other matter, to those to whom such truth is revealed. And to make or reveal that\n\"truth\" requires observation, experiment, knowledge, deduction, and craft, all of which may\ntranscend ugly appearance and make beauty. Our aesthetics sense that allows us to valuate\nthe beautiful and parse it from ugly, is like sensations of pleasure and pain that are useful\nfor drawing attention to basic relevancies of life.\nAesthetics, like other sensations, is a valuation of \"reality/truth\" that concerns many\nanimals other than ourselves. We can deduce its antecedents and decipher how and why\nspecific aspects of it were shaped and developed. My approach, therefore, will be\ncomparative because if aesthetics has a biological function that helps generate appropriate\nbehavior relating to feeding, breeding, and finding suitable associates and homes, then it\nwould be generally adaptive and species-specific.\nAesthetics proximally relate to feelings, but to be examined objectively, we must\nevaluate it by choice behavior and comparative biology. Attraction and approach versus\nwithdrawal and avoidance are based on sensory stimuli that may be direct, or they may be\nevaluated symbolically; a cat set onto a picture of three-dimensional perspective will\nhesitate to cross an edge on it, sensing depth \u00ad but by a symbolic representation of the real\nenvironment. We do not need to feel the effect of jumping off a cliff to avoid doing it. We\nalso have fear of heights. Judgments are influenced by our senses, but most if not all\nanimals are born with innate abilities to make appropriate decisions of many sorts that\naffect their welfare on the basis of stimuli that are symbolic indicators, and they are\nmotivated by urges generated by them.\nAesthetics\nRecent definitions of aesthetics, upon which \"fine\" (as opposed to functional) art is\nbased, are diffuse. Scharfstein (2009) defines aesthetics as \"anything in experience that is\nother than the merely literal or practical.\" But he then states that \"the aesthetic and literal or\npractical I distinguish are inseparable, except verbally or imaginatively, from the acts,\nevents, objects, or persons of what they are, in the terminology I suggest, aspects or\ndimensions.\" He proposes that the aesthetic dimensions of experience \"is the free interest\nwe take in our acts, our thoughts, and in the functioning of our senses. It is the mode of\nconscious experience, even when the consciousness is evasive and marginal--\".\nFurthermore, he makes reference to enjoyment when proposing \"the seeing is most\nevidently aesthetic when it is colored with some exultation.\" I have gone into some detail\nin the definition of aesthetics by a current artist and philosopher not because it is made with\nreference to humans, but because I think it could encompass what a biologist could accept\nfor the experience and productions of animals other than ourselves. The caveat is, though,\nthat one incorporates the evolutionary perspective, where both our own and other animals'\nexperiences are felt, and acts executed, on the basis of \"other than the merely literal and\npractical.\" All are colored by \"exultation\" or emotion, the proximate mechanism of\nchoice/action.\nOther animals' actions are arguably even less consciously performed for practical\neffect than ours. They are performed by motivation of what \"feels right.\" It is only we who\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nhave figured out why they may feel right (or not), because we have deciphered many of the\neffects that the animals themselves are not likely to be consciously aware of. For that\ncapacity of knowing about them we required consciousness and so the product, the\nscientific insight, that stands as an edifice of the imagination and skill, and that is colored\nby some expectation and ultimately exultation, is therefore art as well.\nOur aesthetic sense, as opposed to operant conditioning for a reward, is largely\ninnate. This fact is now tacitly recognized with regard to appreciation for habitat. For\nexample, in \"the prospect of refuge\" (Appleton, 1996), we refer to a view such as one\nequivalent to from a cave, or under a tree. We prefer landscapes featuring open space, or\nthose with a clear focal point such as groupings of climbable trees (Kaplan, 1992), paths, or\nwater, with wildlife (Orians and Heerwagen, 1992). There may be gender differences, with\nwomen having a predisposition toward prospects providing fruit and refuge (Lyons, 1983),\nas opposed to those of hunting and exploration for men. The fact that children show\nstronger preferences than adults argues for the innateness (i.e., aesthetic) rather than\nlearned tastes, those influenced by society and other environmental factors (Balling and\nFalk, 1982). I argue therefore for a distinction between the innate or \"pure\" choices as\nopposed to the conditioned ones such as those arising from proximally-reinforcing ones\nthat we define as operant conditioning. Even pigeons can be trained to distinguish what we\n(human children) choose as \"good\" versus \"bad\" paintings (Watanabe, 2010) on the basis\nof the whole composition of the pictures, and not just isolated parts of it (Watanabe, 2011).\nThus, whereas we are expressing an aesthetic sense, the pigeons' amazingly sophisticated\ndiscrimination is not the result of aesthetics, but instead from operant conditioning. The\nchildren's choices were aesthetic. It may be doubtful if children can articulate why they\nfind specific artistic creations beautiful and others not, any more than birds do.\nAesthetic creations\nBirds routinely make judgments that are expressed in their creations. The Great\ncrested flycatcher, Myiarchus crinitus, usually adds a shed snake-skin to the lining of its\nnest. Tree swallows, Tachycineta bicolor, go to apparent great lengths to gather specifically\nlarge white plume-like feathers for that purpose, and the Red-eyed vireo, Vireo olivaceus,\nadds the paper from hornet nests to the outside of its nest. Do they have an aesthetic sense?\nBirds' carrying specific items to their nest and incorporating them into it are\nexpressing a psychological urge. If applied to us, it would signify \"aesthetic\" appreciation,\nbut probably only if we were unable to explain the taste in terms of utility, such as pasting\nthe walls of our home with a flower design. We would say because it is beautiful.\n\"Beauty,\" we presume, is for its own sake, but if art is an expression of aesthetics, then\nobjectively it must include the creations of animals other than our own. A difference in the\ncomparison between the birds and us is that we probably know more about the birds'\nchoices than our own, because our behavior is strongly based by conscious intentions,\nespecially with regard to what we make.\nAnimals make a variety of structures from the simple to the highly elaborate, but all\nserve a practical purpose. Those of spiders serve as traps. Those of the social insects and of\nbirds are dwellings, nurseries for the young, or both, and one might suppose that, except for\nthe constraint of building material, bird nests could or should be alike. Yet, although\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nbetween individuals of the same species they vary little, these creations can vary widely\neven between closely related species. Black-throated blue warblers, Dendroica\ncaerulenscens, build their nest within a foot of the ground, and preferably sheltered just\nunder its broad leaves in the fork of a hobblebush. They line this nest with dark hair-like\nrootlets from ferns that look like moose hair, or as an ersatz when such hair is not available.\nYellow-rumped warblers, D. coronata, build their nests of thin twigs high in the branches\nof a large conifer, and line them with dark feathers. The Northern parula warbler,\nSetophaga americana, has a hanging nest built into fibrous lichens. Each of the over 50\nwarbler species has its own unique places where it builds its nest and with what it is\nconstructed from and in. Some birds literally weave nests using string-like fibers, while a\nvariety of species make pot-like structures of mud and clay and then line them plant down\n(Goodfellow, 2011). No bird needs to know the deep reasons why it chooses specific nest\nsites, nest materials and construction techniques any more than a monkey knows why it\nlikes sex (and specifically with a member of the opposite sex of its own species at certain\ntimes). Each species has innate \"templates\" that help identify the appropriate stimuli and\nexecute often highly specific behaviors.\nSome likes and dislikes of birds are logically consistent in terms of adaptive\nscenarios that can be tested. The vireos' exterior of hornet nest paper decoration (Heinrich,\n2010), for example, could be mimicking a hornet nest and thus reduce predation. The large\nwhite feathers that tree swallows bring into their nest would hide their white eggs, and\ncould be an adaptive trait reducing chick mortality (During the week of egg-laying, before\nincubation starts, females other than the nest owner who have not been able to find a nest\nhole of their own attempt to dump their eggs in others' nests, and for this egg-dumping\ntactic to succeed a prospective cuckold needs to make sure the potential host is in the\nprocess of completing its clutch. That is, it may need to see the others' eggs. So the\npreference for white feathers translates to good parenting, because, in nests with extra\nyoung, some of the young do not survive to fledge because, in this species, individual\nyoung can dominate siblings by plugging the nest-hole entrance and intercepting most of\nthe incoming food (Heinrich, unpublished). In contrast, some hawks daily add fresh greens\ninto their nest lining, but only after their young hatch when the parents stockpile meat in\nthe nest (Lyons, Titus, and Mosher, 1986). A dead hare may spoil long before it is entirely\nconsumed, and it would then contaminate the nest lining for the next meal. The greens may\nbe providing a \"clean tablecloth\" that retards food spoilage (Heinrich, 2013). Whether birds\nthemselves consciously know why they have the specific tastes is probably irrelevant in\ntheir decision-making process, because the evolutionary \"reason\" to get it right would\nrequire an in-depth understanding of advanced PhD level biology, and would even then be\nhighly convoluted and too complex to fathom. It is simpler and more reliable to simply\nprogram tastes. Similarly, what our \"eye\" relates to us as appealing may also be as\nunknown to us as the urge to collect white feathers is to a tree swallow and the penchant to\ncollect green boughs is to the Broad-winged hawk. Our tastes for different kinds of food,\non the other hand, are (in the last century at least) becoming more transparent, and\ntherefore we are less apt to think of them as \"aesthetic\" since we now also consider health\neffects.\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nFood choice\nAnimals proximally judge the proper food to eat by taste. Taste preferences are\nlargely innate, as are some cues that identify food, such as color, shape, and scent.\nHoneybees are attracted to gather sugar from flowers on the basis of their scents, colors and\ngeometrical patterns (von Frisch, 1954). We do not need to suppose that they find flowers\n\"beautiful.\" Aesthetics could be irrelevant, because these insects are strongly conditioned\nby the food rewards, whereas we pick the flowers simply (or more complexly!) because we\nconsider them \"beautiful\" and therefore worthy of being grown in a garden or displayed in\na vase on the table. Yet, the dichotomy between innate attraction and conditioning is not\nstrict since bees would likely have difficulty in finding flowers if they did not have an\ninnate attraction to the specific general stimuli that represent generic flowers. Secondly,\ntheir chances of finding nectar are increased also by specific innate choice, because blue\nflowers on average have more nectar than white flowers. (Bird-flowers tend to be red, bee\nflowers blue, and fly flowers white). Honeybees, Apis mellifera, (Menzel and Erber, 1972)\nand bumblebees, Bombus sp. (Heinrich, Mudge, and Deringis, 1977) indeed have a stronger\ninnate attraction to blue rather than white flowers, and bumblebees also have an innate\npreference for flowers with bilateral symmetry (Rodriguez, Gumbert, Hempel de Ibarro,\nKunze, and Giurfa, 2004), which should reduce chance visits to random objects. Bees'\nsenses of being attracted to flowers in general, and specifically to being biased toward blue\nand bilaterally symmetrical flowers, are arguably aesthetic if referenced to our tastes, so\nwhy should they not be aesthetic if referenced to theirs, provided the individuals' choices\nwere not preconditioned on their experience creating an expectation of reward?\nInsects' behavior may, however, seem to be unjustified in terms of aesthetics simply\nbecause we associate that faculty with \"intelligence.\" Some vertebrate animals, on the other\nhand, exhibit choice behavior that, because of its detailed discrimination based on\ngeneralized features, is difficult to reduce to discrete \"mindless\" qualities such as color or\nscent. Both Black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus (Heinrich and Collins, 1983) and\nBlue jays, Cyanocitta cristata (Real, Ianazzi, Kamil, and Heinrich, 1984), for example,\nhave been taught to distinguish the differences in the shapes of leaves that are undamaged,\npartially-eaten by palatable caterpillars, or partially-eaten by unpalatable caterpillars.\nSimilarly, Rock pigeons, Columba livia, can discriminate features in pictures that relate to\nhuman aesthetic value (Watanabe, 2010, 2011). The birds' ability to generalize features \u00ad\nin the first case with regard to forms, in the second of colors and patterns that relate to\nhuman aesthetic sense \u00ad is impressive. In the above cases, however, the preferences cannot\nbe regarded as aesthetic because the choice behavior was not spontaneous. It had been\nshaped by rewards and is presumably motivated by those rewards. On the other hand,\nrelatively na\u00efve monkeys do have spontaneous preferences for visual stimuli similar to\nthose that na\u00efve humans find pleasing as well, and this has qualified them as being\n\"aestheticists\" (Anderson, Kuwahata, Kuroshima, Leighty, and Fujita, 2005; Rensch,\nIf, for some reason, presumably mindless creatures cannot be considered\naestheticists, then consider an animal of considerable acumen (Heinrich, 1995a), the\nCommon raven, Corvus corax. Like many insects, it also has visual templates that serve the\nyoung inexperienced individuals. Na\u00efve young ravens are attracted to bright-colored and\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nshiny objects, such as rings, coins, gems, etc., that appear to have no utilitarian value\n(Heinrich, 1995b). The na\u00efve birds are also attracted to round, as opposed to elongated,\nobjects (Heinrich, Marzluff, and Adams, 1996). Furthermore, young inexperienced birds\nare curious but highly cautious of large furred and feathered objects. The predispositions\nof na\u00efve birds to be attracted to these stimuli have ultimate (i.e., evolutionary) biological\nsignificance, because they represent foods, such as insects, fruits and eggs, as well as\ncarcasses. The latter, however, may be confused with a live sleeping predator, and therefore\nrequire caution to approach. The caution by na\u00efve young birds is like an innate\n\"knowledge\" of potential danger that, like some peoples' fear of snakes and spiders, pre-\ndetermines choice-behavior and then can modify the behavior by learning.\nPrimates eat fruit, which have evolved to stand out from green foliage by their\ncolors, as do flowers that attract pollinating insects. Given that the plants coevolved with\ntheir animal pollinators and seed dispersers who have both evolved tri-chromatic color\nvision, it is predictable that these animals would also have evolved the behavioral attraction\nto color and/or color contrasts. Their neophilia is a learning predisposition that draws\nattention to their food in a background of green foliage to then promote appropriate\nbehavior.\nFood may be initially located by vision and scent, but it is evaluated by the eating.\nHence, chemicals relevant to food identification, as detected by chemical receptors, must\nbe linked to the central nervous system to be valued depending on its suitability as\nnutrition; the animal cannot logically deduce their health effects. For the most part it must\n\"know\" whether food is nutritious or harmful. Aesthetics can serve as the first filter.\nIndeed, for some people, the taste of food has been elevated to make \"dining\" and cooking\nan aesthetic, if not an art, experience. It is no accident that our perception of \"good\ncooking\" is often related to \"simple\" and healthful food, and that the old masters invariably\nchose ripe fruit as their models, rather than the achromatic, shriveled, rotten, or green.\nNevertheless, food choice is broad and easily alterable. In contrast, in sexual attractions,\nwhich are similarly guided by specific innate preferences/tastes that relate to scent, vision,\nand other senses, choice is strongly hard-wired and relatively unalterable.\nChoice of Mates and Associates\nInnate choices triggered by specific sign stimuli are important for reproduction in\nall animals. Mating may require highly specific rules, and the ornaments and behaviors to\nachieve it can be costly, as shown, for example, by tail ornaments in birds.\nA birds' tail is normally used as an organ for steering and/or flight, and if potential\nmates choose a mate proximately on the basis of the appearance of its tail, and ultimately\non its utility, then an aerodynamically perfect tail might result. But the peacock's tail (and\nthose of some others as well) is useless as such. It is large enough to be a physical burden\nto produce and to carry around, and brightly-colored enough to bring the wearer to the\nattention of predators. However, as pointed out by the theoretical biologist Amotz Zahavi\n(1975), it gains its impressiveness primarily for its cost (if it were cheap to produce and\nwear than each male could have one). The price a male peacock pays in essence shows that\nhe is alive and well despite wearing his long colorful tail that could cost him his life. But to\nmate he must wear one that meets specific expectations, because the females' aesthetic\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nsense is cued to choose that specific ornament.\nAppearance identifies quality, and the first aspect of quality for a potential mate is\nto identify the proper species to choose, and the next is the choice between individuals. The\nnuptial sky dance of the male woodcock will never impress the hen of a grouse or a\npeacock. Yet, in a more fundamental way, it boils down to the same thing in all species.\nWhether it is the red buttocks of a baboon, or the brilliant flashing green head and neck of a\nmallard duck, the huge rack of a stag, or the shapely breasts, hips and long hair of a young\nwoman and how they are displayed, it's all about aesthetic taste. And that taste, like all\ntastes, has meaning in terms of signaling desirable qualities relating to reproduction of the\nindividual bearing them, or of an individual as an ally in the more social animals.\nMost birds offer themselves in body, by their dance and song, in their skill in\nconstruction, and ability and competence to offer help to a potential mate. All of the\npotential attributes can be incorporated into ritual displays that attract mates where\nspecifics and subtle cues matter. The individuals in a group of displaying male sage grouse\nor birds-of-paradise may all look and act alike to us, but the potential mates who watch\nthem and judge are highly selective, and there is usually a near consensus among them as to\nwhich one is the most attractive of them all in the line-up. The animals are acutely aware of\nspecific cuing signals, but it would be hard to argue that they consciously know why they\nprefer them. Appearance and behavior may reflect hormone levels and physical conditions\n(Ligon, Thornhill, Zuk, and Johnson, 1990). One may perhaps debate whether such fine-\ntuned taste is \"aesthetic\" (Thornhill, 2003) or whether it includes art (Endler, 2012), though\nthere is no doubt about its effects and relevance, and that the choices could generally not\ncome from operant conditioning.\nThere is, for humans, such little ambiguity about the general body features that do\nor do not signal reproductive potential that is translatable to physical beauty, that a\ndiscussion of them in the present context is superfluous. On the other hand, the face is as\nimportant, yet few of us can articulate what we see that makes a face beautiful. But not all\ncues need to be consciously evaluated, nor do we, as in birds or other animals, need to be\naware of them for them to affect choice behavior. Again, consider other animals for whom\nwe do not suppose that they consciously know what attracts them. We call it \"instinct,\" and\nif applied to us we might say \"impulse\" or a \"heeding of the gut.\" But if it is an evolved\naesthetic enabling us to act on the instinctual knowledge that we have acquired over our\nhistory, then it is so firmly grounded that it is no longer necessary for us to be conscious of\nit. Consciousness could delay and divert from what has produced the proper result through\nevolutionary history. It may, however, help to be consciously aware if one wanted to\nreproduce the cues symbolically, and I suspect an artist has the ability to bring instinctive\nattractions into expression, which is referred to as having a \"good eye.\"\nThe \"eye\" can be tested, and one of the (to us) unconscious features of facial beauty\nthat has been revealed by experiment is something none of us would likely have articulated;\nnamely, symmetry (Brown et al., 2008; Little and Jones, 2003; Samuels, Butterworth,\nRoberts, Grauper, and Hole, 1994; Thornhill and Moller, 1998). Physical symmetry has\nnow been extensively examined not only with regard to facial features in humans but also\nin respect to other bodily features in insects, fish, birds, etc. (see references in recent article\nby Langridge (2006), on a mollusk, the cuttlefish). Is it an averageness that helps to identify\nthe relevant features of the type?\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nWe are, apparently, programmed to recognize and be attracted to certain features\nthat are not different in kind than those important to a peacock, widow finch, or a barn\nswallow, whose females are programmed to be attracted to a male with a long tail feathers.\nNeedless to say, Vargas did not get famous painting models chosen specifically for\ndeformities, disease, or old age. The models were chosen instead by criteria for beauty.\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, but in this case there is relative uniformity in the eyes\nof the intended beholders, and the artist was privy to it, and also had the skill to paint what\nhis audience wanted and expected.\nWe also value \"inner beauty,\" perhaps roughly translated to \"spirit,\" because we\nare highly social and our survival as a social species has depended on the wisdom and\nnecessary knowledge of post-reproductive individuals. As a consequence, artists may\ndisplay \"character,\" in which case the emphasis is on the face rather than the body.\nHowever, almost invariably when artists draw a portrait, there is an attempt to display the\npositive elements of the subject possibly through the, perhaps, superficially negative\nelements that may be included to warrant the \"truth.\" If negative qualities are deliberately\ndisplayed, then they are meant to indict an enemy. If conscious, then it would be\nadvertisement or propaganda, as would a reaction to it. Neither would be fine art,\nregardless of what it is a reaction to or against.\nAesthetic taste is not displayed only on the living body and/or behavior, but also on\nproducts the individual makes and is then associated with. For other animals, the best\nexample may be that of the bowerbirds of Australasia (Frith, Frith, and Barnes, 2004). The\nSatin bowerbird, Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, stays at and in the vicinity of his bower for\nyears, daily attending, maintaining and improving it. It is a large construction of two\nparallel walls of upward-extending twigs that arch upward and over an avenue in a north-\nsouth direction (across the sun). It is erected in a carefully-kept clearing a meter long and\nwide with a smooth floor on which some 50 or more preferably blue berries, parrot\nfeathers, and other shiny trinkets are arranged for prominent display. The birds' attraction\nto blue decorations is so strong it may even kill small blue birds for its feathers. In contrast,\nthe Vogelkop gardener bower bird, Amblyornis inornatus, builds a bower that is up to 1.6\nmeters long and over 1.2 meters tall. It resembles an \"extremely well-made and neat\"\nconical hut. The bird maintains a meadow of moss free of debris in front of it, and displays\non this \"lawn\" piles of colorful fruit, flower petals, fungi, and insect parts, all arranged\naccording to their different colors as though aiming to provide maximum contrasts between\nShow of Skill\nBirds' displays in sexual selection are, aside from feather garb, often exquisite\ndemonstrations of skill. The dances of the South American cotingas (Cotingidae) and\nAustralasian birds-of-paradise (Paradisaeidae), the nuptial flights of the North American\nwoodcock and the raven, are out of the ordinary or everyday behavior of these birds; they\nare highly distinctive special displays of perfection through strength, coordination, and\nability to measure up to an ideal, as are Vargas' paintings of nudes with respect to\nmorphology. They are for an audience, and that audience judges them critically. Song is\noften an accompanying demonstration of skill.\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nWe not only adorn ourselves with clothes, jewelry, body paint and markings, but by\nextension also by the products of our skills, such as music and other art. The aesthetics of\nproducts are generally clearly identified as being a part of the individual.\nBirds' nests are a particularly conspicuous example of sometimes exquisite skill of\ntheir creators, but since the designs are highly species-specific (Collias and Collias, 1984;\nGoodfellow, 2011; Haskell, 2000) and serve a utilitarian function, they cannot generally be\nregarded as satisfying tastes. However, for some species nests do serve as mate attractants\nand that then cater to tastes. A presumed outgrowth of nests as display objects are the\nbowers built by the afore-mentioned male bowerbirds, which are primarily, if not\nexclusively, for display.\nWhether it is the elaborate bower built by a bowerbird (Frith et al., 2004;\nGoodfellow, 2011) requiring years of practice to achieve, a rock star's CDs or a painter's\nart, all are extensions of the individual. Similarly, if someone shows us a beautiful print of\nan anonymous painting, we are less impressed and less interested than if we saw who\ncreated it, knowing it is the extension of the contents of the persons' brain and their skilled\nhand and thus really an extension of him or her.\nIt is difficult to imagine artistic expression without a heavy dose of skill required to\nproduce the show even in human art. Indeed, often the skill IS the show. A gymnast or\nskater may be physically fit, but the essence of their projection is skill. Playing a recording\nof its species-specific song may attract a conspecific bird, but if a show-person came to\nplay to a human audience a recording that happened to sound nice, rather than exhibiting\ntheir skill by their own vocalizations and their own skill on the strings or keyboard, we\nwould not be impressed. Skill impresses, and skill is almost by definition that which is\nsuperior to what we ourselves can or could do routinely.\nHabitat Choice\nAnimals are adapted to live in specific habitats, but to choose one it must first be\nable to identify it. Presumably Wood thrushes, Hylocichla mustelina, for example, should\nfind dense woods attractive and Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, open\nfields. Birds' habitat-specificity is presumably derived from visual cues that are symbolic\nenough to identify some key feature or features of their often fine-grained and specific\nhabitat. Like food and mate preferences, choice for their specific habitat is genetically\nengrained. But what exactly are the cues for something as difficult to define as \"habitat\"?\nWe don't know, but the relevant cues could include sign-markers, such as perhaps open\nvistas versus closed, irregular patterns such as cover of trees versus an even horizon near\nthe ground, attraction to specific colors or scents, complex pattern versus simple, sunshine\nversus shade, and perhaps horizontal versus vertical lines. Gulls as seabirds, for example,\nmay be expected to be attracted to water, yet they now also forage on open fields and\nparking lots, so open space or a horizon may be their relevant attractant cue rather than\nwater as such. Similarly, cliff-nesting peregrine falcons now nest on tall human-made\nstructures, presumably because they identify similar specific cues there that match their\ninnate ones.\nInnate human habitat preferences have been expressed and documented in the\nreferences to numerous studies by Edward O. Wilson's books (1984, 2004). We evolved\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nout on the open plains with scattered trees and may have an innate attraction for park-like\nvistas, given our attraction to the shelter of trees and prominences. Our fascination with\nanimals is part of the same aesthetic sense, specifically labeled as the \"biophilia\"\nhypothesis. We were and are fascinated by animals, as cats are by birds and hounds by\nhares. A landscape replete with a diversity of animal life is for us a habitat that is suitable\nfor our life. Similarly, one with flowers has a signature of open space, sunshine, and it\nautomatically presupposes productivity, a habitat where there are animals. Thus, it is no\nwonder that we have an aesthetic sense for color contrasts, one widely exploited by artists,\noften directly in using flowers as models. But that aesthetic environment includes not only\nour visual cues but also an aural landscape (Fisher, 1998, Pijanowski et al., 2011).\nIf the osprey's aesthetic sense dictates that it must nest on a platform of branches of\ntall trees, then if we cut down old trees we should (and do now) provide substitutes.\nSimilarly, if our aesthetic senses are a basis for what makes us human, then they inform\nmoral choices. If aesthetic tastes refer to adaptive responses to living in a certain\nenvironment, then this suggests that we should make efforts to retain and create\nenvironments that we find beautiful and pleasing because our well-being depends on it.\nSince we are relatively plastic and subject to experience, early contact in childhood (Louv,\n2008) may be required to facilitate the innate developmental trajectory.\nThe innate sensory stimuli that through our evolutionary history have conferred\nbeneficial effects on us may be transferred to our art, perhaps through a \"sensory\nexploitation\" (Verpooten and Nellison, 2012), a concept that does not explain the origin of\nthe original preference, but is useful in explaining effects. The visual effects that, perhaps\nmost effectively, match human aesthetics of landscapes with skill enough to be effective\nmay arguably be paintings such as those of Albert Bierstadt, Thomas Cole, and Frederick\nEdwin Church. With relevance to conservation, recent books argue to save not only the\nArt\nArt, as Leo Tolstoy (1896, 1996) understood it over a century ago, is: \"a means of\nintercourse between men.\" He apparently falsely presumed that only we have the capacity\nto receive/perceive another's experience or their expression of feelings. Any dog owner\nknows otherwise, and the dog is only a single of innumerable species. Many of us are close\nenough to just this one to know it intimately to some degree.\nEible-Eibesfeldt (1988) acknowledged that human aesthetics refers to what is\nbeautiful and that our sense of it may have a biological basis because of an apparent\nconsistency with regard to brain laterality, whereas beauty as defined by culture instead is\nnebulously related to \"good form.\" However, we now generally accept that art expresses\nhuman tastes of beauty, pleasure, and skill that are of evolutionary origin related to fitness\n(Dutton, 2009), and other animal's tastes are presumably similarly derived, though\ntherefore given different expression in accordance to different needs of life. Yet, we know\ninduced one reviewing artist to remark: \"They pretty much say it all. I spent years getting a\ndegree in something [making paintings] which monkeys do innately.\"\nSome would say (Lewis-Williams, 2004) that we didn't have art until we had\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nconsciousness. Thus art, at least anthropocentrically, is a conscious expression of\nsomething of our inner nature. But of what? To Scharfstein (2009), art stems from our\n\"hunger or need to create, contemplate, possess... at least a shadow of what we do not have\nfully enough to satisfy us\" so that art becomes a \"testimony to the maker's traits.\" It is, as\nin other animals, indeed an extension beyond the verbal expression, though arguably to an\neven greater extent than in those who have no verbal expression. Art includes imagination,\nhunger, skills to explore and make \"imagined possibilities less figuratively, more tangibly,\"\nand make them \"more accessible.\" It is, according to Scharfstein, a \"reconnoitering of the\nworlds' interesting possibilities and yet avoid the inconvenience or danger of\nencountering....\" I suspect the cave paintings, and those of Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516),\nwould come to mind as the latter, and those of Leonardo da Vinci in the former.\nSome 32,000 years ago, from when we have the earliest recorded human images\nthat have been preserved (on cave walls in Europe), we painted animals, and most likely in\nritualistic or shamanic contexts to make them directly relevant to a most important aspect\nof our reality then: the prey we enjoyed to hunt. They represented our \"reality\" and hence\nour \"truth.\" Our sensory-perceived connections to nature are now not as close as they were\nthen, and so our art now would expectedly also be more symbolic of that past. Joel Babb,\nan artist who paints (to us humans, not meadowlarks) beautiful pictures of wooded streams\nand brooks told me: \"I don't know what the deep reasons are behind the interest [in\nhumans] of the beauty of clouds rising behind a ridgeline, or white pine branches reaching\nin front of a cloud, or a brook coming down through the woods splintering the brilliance of\nlight.... But the interest is there for us.\" Billowing clouds and the open sky appeals to our\nancient heritage of hunters on the relatively open plains, savannas and open bush-land\ncountry such as in Africa, in which we feel even now much more at home than in closed-\ncanopy dark forest. In the open, as hunters, we could spot game, and as the hunted at times\nalso, we had time to climb a tree. So trees represent safety. I suspect further that the\nhanging pine branch touches an analogue of \"frame\" such as one would visually experience\nunder a tree, or perhaps a shelter from a cliff.\nBabb uses flowing water as a persistent theme in many of his paintings. His brooks\nand streams look alive, shimmering and moving- the stimuli we associate aesthetically with\nwater. Water represents life to us. As hunters running down an antelope in the heat \u00ad the\nonly arena where we gained an advantage over the big cats \u00ad access to water was essential.\nUnlike other open-country animals that must retain water to the utmost, we gained our\nadvantage through copious sweating. Sweating was key to hunting in an open sunny\nhabitat, and those of our ancient ancestors who were near water gained a huge advantage\nrelative to those who lived far from it. Those who had a great attraction for water were\nlikely those who wanted to settle or be near it. We see the evidence of our innate appeal to\nwater in the value of real estate; a cottage at the edge of a lake or stream costs at least\ndouble the same one in an open bare field, or in thick woods without a view. If we had\nevolved to live underground, or on treeless plains, our aesthetic tastes would be very\ndifferent.\nNeophilia and Art\nIn a (strictly theoretical) unchanging environment, specialization should ideally\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nbecome fossilized by hard-wiring to reduce or eliminate wrong choices. Learning can fill in\nfor change, but it may require time, and it necessarily involves exploring something new\nand making mistakes (which can be minimized by correct insight) before there is correction\nto achieve appropriate behavior. As already mentioned, food choice is a good example and\nhas been well-studied in insects. After bumblebees have specialized to forage on the \"best\"\nof available flowers, and that flower stops blooming or is removed, they become attracted\nto the new. They sample a great variety of flowers, which enlarges their choice horizon.\nThey then choose the best of those available on the basis of food rewards (Heinrich, 1976).\nSimilarly, although adult ravens are attracted to specific features in mate choice (Gwinner,\n1964), the young na\u00efve ravens' are biased to novelty. They preferentially contact and\nmanipulate the new regardless of food value. After several contacts, however, they ignore\nall but the edible, which are then hunted preferentially (Heinrich, 1995b). On the other\nhand, ravens have innate attraction to smooth, round and colorful objects whereas elongate\nobjects are neutral (Heinrich et al., 1996). Such cues indicate what might be edible, namely\nberries and eggs, and these serve them as a first approximation that shortens or even\npermits subsequent conditioning, but is not the cause of it.\nHumans also value uniqueness as an aesthetic appeal. We pick a bright blue flower\nout of a field of the red. We, too, are attracted to fruit, to bright colors, and to eggs.\nHowever, we exhibit a huge range of individual tastes, in addition to valuing uniqueness.\nAre the two related? To try to answer that question it is perhaps appropriate to first\nacknowledge that we are, more than any other, a species in which learning assumes an\noverwhelming importance. The addition of conditioning onto the innate predispositions\nresults in us having a large variety of tastes. My own view is that, until shown otherwise,\nwe are unique quantitatively, but not qualitatively. Again referring to bumblebees, there is\nso far no evidence that their innate attraction to flowers vary to any significant extent, but\npreferences may vary greatly among the individuals of the same species and even in the\nsame locality. Flower morphologies vary greatly, and the rewards may be nectar, pollen, or\nboth. Harvesting techniques vary greatly as well, depending on what is harvested, and even\nmore depending on from what. The morphologies of the different flowers demand specific\nbehaviors to exploit (Heinrich, 1976, 1979b), and they are identified by specific attractant\ncues. The results of individual specialization, however, are adequately explained by\nconditioning (Heinrich et al., 1977). Similarly, Common ravens preferentially nest on cliffs\nand forage in association with wolves wherever one or both occur. However, their curiosity\nand flexibility allows them to fill in to contact and then be conditioned to a great variety of\noptions for food, habitat, and nest sites. As a likely consequence these birds may be able to\noccupy a wider geographical range and wider ecological conditions than any other bird\nspecies.\nThe ravens', as well as our own, neophilial tendency facilitates staying informed\nand would also have importance in the ability to spread into new habitats, and hence to\nachieve world-wide distribution and success in discovering the many possibilities, riches,\nand opportunities. In bumblebees, it permits the tracking of resources available in different\nflowers through a season in the same place, as is required in their annual colony cycle\n(Heinrich, 1979a). Solitary bees, in contrast, which can specialize on specific plant species\nblooming at any one time, have a narrow preference window and presumably a lower\nlearning capacity.\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nAttracting signals could be labeled as \"aesthetic,\" provided they are not based on\nconditioning, but the experiments with ravens show them to have a utilitarian basis (even\nwhen at times it causes them to pick at bottle caps or carry golf balls to the nest). Novelty\nas an aesthetic sense thus has not only benefits, but can also involve the costs of making\nmistakes. Translated to art, this tendency means that the \"new\" catches our eye and so\nvariety and complexity as such may be aesthetic. But if the comparative approach with\nother animals is indicative, it also means that there are discrete limits to the novel that are\nbeautiful. Making something ugly is not innovation. Style is a different category.\nArtists over the centuries painted in distinctive styles. The beauty of the Flemish\nlandscape painting is distinct from the majestic paintings by Albert Bierstadt (1830-1902)\nof the western North American panoramas. More recent paintings, such as those of Andrew\nWyeth (1917-2009) display a readily-recognizable personal stamp, different both from that\nof his father, N.C. Wyeth, and his son, Jamie. Joel Babb's paintings of the New England\nbrooks and forests are again a vastly different style. But all are of nature and people and\ntheir works. All are innovative, and distinctive. But the one thing that they are distinctive\nfor is aesthetic beauty. It is generally presumed that art is not necessarily representative of\nanything, and some even say that if it is representative then it is not art! On the other hand\nis that which does not look like anything to the average person really art? Or is art anything\none says it is?\nDuring a recent visit to the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, I\ngreatly admired a private collection of Dutch and Flemish master paintings that date from\nthe 1400's to 400 years later, and thought how it must be a brave person who, after that\nglorious time of these artists' achievement, would dare to apply paint from brush to canvas,\nif they were in need of public recognition to produce something that might be superior to\nthis, in order to stand out enough to make a living. But when I looked at the contemporary\npaintings on the wall of my hotel, it seemed that I was looking at trash that almost anyone\ncould have produced. But it must appeal to some. How can the difference in appeal from\nthe old to the new be reconciled in terms of aesthetics or do aesthetic tastes change\nradically over time?\nAlternative Strategies and Post-Modern Art\nBeauty as a commodity is best understood in animals, and in most animals' mating\ngames \"beauty\" becomes a commodity in literally head-to-head competition. In the social\nsphere, the competition is in precise parameters and by \"rules\" that the contestants follow\nin order to remain in the game. In balloon flies (Diptera: Empididae) the mating \"rules\" are\nthat males dance in crowds. They are then chosen by the females out of a line-up on the\nbasis of large empty balloon-like construction of silk that these courting males offer as\nmating inducements (Kessel, 1955). These \"balloons\" appear to be useless except as an\naesthetic offering. What do they offer these females aside from satisfying their \"aesthetic\"\nsense? The answer is \"nothing.\" However, that \"nothing\" evolved from something that did\nhave value, but the attraction to it was achieved by hijacking, in what amounts to marketing\ndeception. That story emerges from the likely prior evolutionary steps that can be deduced\nfrom some species of the genus Hilara in this group.\nThe original steps to the empty \"balloon\" attraction involved males who increased\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\ntheir social success by offering prey that was wrapped in silk, thereby presumably making\nit easier to handle, and females then evolved to choose males with the largest offerings.\nCompetition among males to carry large prey may have compromised dancing\nperformance, but some males compensated by making their gifts more conspicuous by\nbetter \"gift-wrapping.\" After the females evolved to become attracted to the enhanced, new\nstimulus for food, it in turn selected males to leave out the contents and carry empty\npackages, which they could make large to increase show alone, since \"real\" value was no\nlonger relevant. Could similar principles apply more universally?\nAs shown by the example of the peacock's tail, rules of the self-marketing game\nmay be stringent and costly. Many males of a population may not breed. The individuals\nwho don't measure up to the winning standard do something different than appealing to\naesthetics. In some species of insects, fish, birds, and mammals, instead of showing off\ntheir finery and competing head-on, some males adopt nondescript garb and manners and\nso enter into the arena \"under the radar,\" so to speak.\nIf art is an expression of aesthetics to create beauty then one might expect\nmarketing it to generate two kinds of strategies. The first concerns utilization of the\naesthetics related to the unvarying life-promoting aspects ultimately based on food, safety,\ncomfort, and reproduction. The second is instead with respect to exploiting client\nrelationships in which social aspects are an issue.\nThose who paint \"pour l'art\" are presumably driven by aesthetics, the tastes that are\ngenerally widespread because they spring from our biology and are influenced by our\nexpectations from style. However, choice in what has been described as \"post-modern\" art\nboils down to two constituents: Name and Number. Two paintings can be identical, and one\ncan demand an astronomical price, and the other be ignored. The difference is that one is by\na famous artist and the other is by an unknown; the painting selling for a million dollars\nwould likely be discarded by the same buyer if they were ignorant of its painter.\nAesthetics may be the least of the value of postwar modern art, and perhaps also the\ncontent of it, as is prominently displayed in a recent (31 August, 2012) New York Times\narticle by James B. Stewart on a comparison between recent astronomical prices of real\nestate and art. The article asks: \"If its $100 million, is it art?\" The premise of that question,\nthat \"art is what people are willing to pay,\" implies that \"an apartment is like a piece of\nart,\" which, as Cezanne's \"The Card Player\" that sold for $250 million demonstrates,\nsimply means it is worth a lot of money. If this premise is true, it follows that art is\ndetermined not by the object but absurdly either by the amount of available money, fools,\nor both. Alternately, art is defined as something that is \"unique and can't be replicated.\"\nHowever, the random splotches of paint thrown onto a wall or canvas by any chimpanzee\ncould never be exactly replicated. Each is unique. It is true also that the portrait of the\nfaintly smiling Lisa Gherardine by Leonardo da Vinci can't be replicated. But a reasonably\ntechnically capable artist could make a close copy, and a blue plastic rectangle that sells as\nart can probably be replicated by almost anyone. What would be reduced in a replication,\nthough, is not beauty, but the monetary value of the original by threatening their ownership\nof \"one of a kind.\" Where value is all about demand, buyers need both assured rarity and\nName.\nArt is also defined as something without practical use. But the fluted marble\ncolumns holding up the roofs of the Greek temples are still beautiful, whereas white-\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\npainted columns created for beauty and set in front of a house built to live in make it look\nugly. The designs of a feather, or that of an egg, are highly functional, and beautiful to\nwhomever that design is revealed, but any imaginary construction trying to serve the same\nfunction of either is necessarily ugly; it reveals not truth but an individual's whim.\nErnst Beyeler, the great Swiss art dealer reputedly said: \"if I can't sell something, I\njust double the price.\" If this strategy is effective then it acknowledges the facts that for the\nseller the high price is meant to let the buyer presume they are buying something of greater\nvalue than what they see, and that to the buyer the \"something\" is not art but money. It's a\nconfidence scam where the purchase is reduced to money to become a pawn in a financial\ninvestment, rather than chosen as a work of craftsmanship and beauty. Donald Kuspit\n(2004) in \"The End of Art\" posits that post-modern art is \"post aesthetic\" and has\ndegenerated into an entropic character. However, especially in its most bizarre examples,\npost-modern art makes newspaper headlines. These generate discussion and garner even\nmore attention, and so there is even more inducement to go yet another step in the same\ndirection into idiosyncratic and purely personal, which turns out to be a distancing from the\nbroad biological roots of what is innately pleasurable for our species.\nWe are like other animals except that we are clever and flexible enough to be able\nto substitute fake for real value. A peacock risks his life to predators to back up his worth\nwith what appears highly attractive to the discriminating intended client. We invest in\n\"something\" (which could be anything) that we call art. As the artist Joel Babb, summed\nup: \"It is only the insiders who are educated to the point of not being able to distinguish\nshit from shinola, or the pulling off of a scam that is working\" and \"it can't be good for art\nor society in the long run- it's like a virus which infects everything, but it can be amusing.\"\nA personal note\nThe above exploration would not be complete without a consideration of personal\nevolution and possible biases (although if they were strictly personal they would be\nirrelevant). I rather think of them as general, but that realization came only after exposure\nthrough science and art, after which I realized that the effect of collective culture can\noverwhelm and squelch aesthetic sensibilities as well as hone them.\nWe are a species that more than any other lives by learning. We absorb at first\npassively, then actively as we try to \"belong\" to that which to most of us now means\nlargely the urban environment. I experienced a facilitated exposure to a much different one.\nIt was much like that of some birds who learn their species' songs by hearing it around\nthem while they are still in the nest. That is their specific learning \"window\" of time, the\nonly one that song learning by them can occur. Learning occurs only with emotional\narousal, and originally that arousal comes from our innate aesthetic roots where the relevant\ncatches our attention.\nI recall my intense emotional arousal from animals of all sorts. In part my father\nfacilitated what was likely this natural predisposition, but I soon focused a burning\nfascination on birds and beetles, possibly because they were the most readily available\nsubjects. I recall also a special romance for marshes, which seemed like a heaven yet\nunseen but only glimpsed, perhaps from a picture or a verbal description. Pictures of the\nreal thing were evocative because they seemed to touch the same feelings.\nLater, as a young man, during a year in the African wilds and months in dense\nBiological roots of aesthetics and art\nforest, I experienced exhilaration to be finally out of them and onto the Acacia savanna\nwith views into the distance, with breathing space, birdsong, and animals and their tracks as\nsign. I knew nothing of the \"Savanna hypothesis\" or the \"Hunting hypothesis.\" Thus, I\nbelieve my strong biases then were \"pure\" aesthetics. They emerged from direct exposures\nand comparisons that allowed weighing one sign stimulus against the other on the\nemotional scale.\nEarly on, I wanted to \"capture\" and keep the beautiful. At first that was literally by\nhunting, using whatever means I had available: hand, net, slingshot, gun. As a kid I could\nkeep insects. Later I raised young birds as (free) pets, and learned taxidermy to preserve\nanimals. I moved on to photography, and then to sketching and water-coloring. Later still I\ntried to \"capture\" deeper non-visual aspects of beauty through science, which led to writing\nand enlarged the vistas of reality into ever-wider contexts or frames. The large frames of\nreference were almost like my beloved \"marshes,\" savannas or other encompassing\necological settings. There was little aesthetic distinction between the beauty of a marsh or\nan aesthetic intellectual framework that placed the animal or plant into the construct of an\necosystem, or into the time-frame of evolution. But such \"realism\" never could or needed\nto be absolute. It could only capture fragments and essences that would isolate, represent,\nor symbolize the key features that evoke the aboriginal feelings.\nWe are imbedded in a collective culture changing us in an ever-tighter spiral away\nfrom our aboriginal aesthetic roots and into an alien existence. I believe that the closer we\nlive to our aesthetic roots, and the more we are exposed to them especially during our\nchildhoods, the more we will be able to live contented and healthy lives. Art has the power\nto help bring us closer to that aesthetics, which may be obscured and hidden, but which we\nneed to access in order to feel whole.\n"
