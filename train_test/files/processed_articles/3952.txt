Kitaoka and Ashida (2007) reviewed the\nillusions and classified them in two categories; some of them are classified as \"illusory motion in a\ndirection different from the retinal-image motion,\" i.e. producing perception of motion components\nat a right-angle direction to the retinal-motion direction (Gori & Hamburger, 2006; Ito, Anstis, &\nCavanagh, 2009; Pinna & Brelstaff, 2000). The other illusions category is \"illusory motion in the\ndirection parallel to the retinal-image motion.\" For example, the swinging-motion illusion (Khang &\nEssock, 2000) produces illusory motion arising in an opposite direction to eye movement direction.\nThe Filehne illusion (Filehne, 1922) also produces illusory motion in the direction opposite to the\npursuit direction. An illusion of floating motion (Figure 1 [bottom] in Pinna & Spillmann, 2002) and\na kind of sliding-motion illusion (Figure 5 in Pinna & Spillmann, 2005) are rare examples of illusory\nmotion produced in the same direction as the eye movement direction. The pursuit-pursuing illusion\n(Ito, 2012) should be classified in the latter category, i.e. illusory motion in the direction parallel to the\nretinal-image motion and in the same direction as the pursuit eye movement (Ito, 2012; see reviews in\nThe pursuit-pursuing illusion (Ito, 2012) is a visual illusion where a circular object placed in\nthe centre of a radial pattern consisting of thin sectors is seen to move in the pursuit eye movement\ndirection. Figure 1a presents an example of the typical stimulus that produces this illusion. A yel-\nlow disc is placed on a radial pattern consisting of 30 thin dark-grey \"sectors\" (although, strictly\nspeaking, the sectors were not true sectors on the screen because they were partially occluded by a\ndisc) on a light-grey field. When one pursues a moving target with one's eyes observing the stimulus\nfigure in peripheral vision, the yellow disc is seen to move in the same direction as the pursuit direc-\ntion as shown in Figure 1a (a PowerPoint file to demonstrate the illusion can be downloaded from\nhttp://www.design.kyushu-u.ac.jp/~ito/IOM.ppt). During the pursuit of a moving target, extraretinal\nsignals indicating eye movement contribute to perceiving the stability of the sector pattern in the visual\nfield, cancelling the retinal motion signals.At the same time, the extraretinal signals seem to contribute\n\u00b6 Current affiliation: Hitachi, Ltd. Information & Telecommunication Systems Company, Marunouchi\nEffect of surrounding texture on the pursuit-pursuing illusion\nto perceiving the motion of the disc in the same direction as the pursuit direction (see Wertheim, 1994,\nfor a review on illusions caused by interactions between retinal and extraretinal signals). However,\nthis illusion can also appear as an illusion of perceived stillness against physical motion (Figure 1b).\nWhen one fixates on a point and the radial pattern with a disc slowly moves in a particular direction,\nthe disc is perceived as stationary in the visual field or as moving in a direction opposite to the physical\nmotion (see also Ito, 2012). In this case, the extraretinal signals do not play a role. Thus, although the\nexistence/nonexistence of the extraretinal signals changes the illusion's appearance, the essence of this\nillusion may be an illusory motion in a direction that is opposite to its physical motion on the retina.\nThis point is again discussed in the General Discussion. One way to quantitatively measure the effect\nis to move the stimulus figure instead of moving the eyes. However, the fine radial sectors were not\nseen to move smoothly on a PC display; the artefact in wrong apparent motion caused by the monitor\nrefresh and/or image persistence on the display reduced the quality of the illusion. More importantly,\nsubjective stillness was more difficult to quantitatively measure than subjective motion. Therefore,\nwe measured the illusory motion while moving the eyes using a stationary figure displayed with little\nflicker on an LCD screen.\nIto (2012) described the features of the pursuit-pursuing illusion; that is, (1) the illusory motion\noccurs in an opposite direction to the retinal-motion direction (i.e. the same direction as the pursuit\neye movement), (2) the centre disc does not move when the sheet on which the radial patterns are\nprinted is rotated (illusory stillness against physical motion, see also Figure 2 in Ito, 2012), (3) the\neffect does not change with pursuit direction (no anisotropy in the effect) because the radial pat-\ntern has virtually no orientation and (4) despite the radial stimulus configuration, this illusion needs\none-dimensional retinal motion, not expansion/contraction of the stimulus pattern (e.g. \"Pinna and\nBrelstaff illusion,\" Pinna & Brelstaff, 2000; \"the Rotating-Tilted-Line illusion,\" Gori & Hamburger,\n2006; \"the Breathing Light Illusion,\" Gori & Stubbs, 2006; \"the accordion grating illusion,\" Gori,\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of the pursuit-pursuing illusion. (a) indicates illusory motion and its direction\n(broken arrow) during smooth pursuit eye movement tracking a horizontally moving target. (b) indicates illusory\nstability/illusory motion in a direction opposite to physical motion during the fixation of a stationary target. In\neach case, an illusion arises in a direction that is opposite to the retinal-motion direction.\nFigure 2. A radial pattern that produces the pursuit-pursuing illusion and assumed receptive fields of the relative-\nmotion detectors: (a) typical radial stimulus; (b) model of a relative-motion detector with a central excitatory field\naccompanying a circularly inhibitory surround; (c) model application to the illusory figure (note that the left and\nright surround areas slightly signal motion when the retinal motion is horizontal); (d) assumed receptive field of\na modified relative-motion detector tested in Experiment 3 and (e) another type of receptive field with bilateral\ninhibitory regions along the motion direction.\nEffect of surrounding texture on the pursuit-pursuing illusion 22\nGiora, Yazdanbakhsh, & Mingolla, 2011). This is also different from those that do not need explicit\nphysical motion of the stimulus image (e.g. \"Enigma,\" Leviant, 1982, 1996; \"MacKay Rays,\"\n2003). The strength of the pursuit-pursuing illusion is determined by several factors (Ito, 2012). The\nbest illusion occurs when (1) the centre yellow disc is equiluminant with the average luminance of the\nsurround, (2) the luminance contrast between the dark sectors and the light background is high, (3)\nthe diameter of the radial pattern is more than twice as large as the disc diameter and (4) the number\nof the sectors is around 30.\nOne of the proposed hypotheses for the illusion (Ito, 2012) is that a centre-surround relative-\nmotion (or motion-contrast) detector (Figure 2b) produces an illusory motion component of the centre\ndisc. The centre-surround antagonism for motion in V5/MT cells has been investigated physiolog-\nically and psychophysically (Allman, Miezin, & McGuinness, 1957; Born & Tootell, 1992; Born,\nLappin, Gilroy, & Blake, 2003; Tadin, Silvanto, Pascual-Leone, & Battelli, 2011; Takemura, Ashida,\nAmano, Kitaoka, & Murakami, 2012; van der Smagt, Verstraten, & Paffen, 2010). The typical recep-\ntive field of the detector consists of a classical receptive field for motion and the surround inhibitory\narea as shown in Figure 2b. The radially arranged sectors always include sectors in an orientation\northogonal to the retinal-motion direction irrespective of the eye movement direction. This results in\nstrong motion detection in the surround area. In contrast, motion of the centre disc is weakly detected\nbecause the disc is equiluminant with the surround. Thus, the combination of the strong motion signals\nin the surround and the weak motion signals in the centre may activate the centre-surround relative-\nmotion detector (Figure 2c). This may produce the illusory motion of the centre disc in the same direc-\ntion as the pursuit eye movement direction. In this study, we examined this hypothesis manipulating\nthe characteristics of the surrounding texture.\nExperiments 1 and 2 tested the illusory effect when the radial surround was replaced by stripes or\nrandom dots. The radially arranged surround always included not only sectors in an orientation orthog-\nonal to the retinal motion but also sectors in an orientation nearly parallel to the retinal motion. When\nthe entire surround area was filled with orthogonal stripes or random dots, the detected motion signal\nwould be much stronger than that when the surround area was filled with radially arranged sectors. In\ncontrast, when the orientation of the surrounding stripe was parallel to the retinal-motion direction,\nthe detected motion signals in the surround area would be markedly weaker. According to the centre-\nsurround relative-motion detector hypothesis, we could expect that in the former orthogonal-stripe or\nrandom-dot condition the illusion would be stronger than that in the radially surround condition and\nthat in the latter parallel-stripe condition the illusion, if any, would be weaker.\nThrough the experiments here, we examined the centre-surround relative-motion detector hypoth-\nesis and its variant for the pursuit-pursuing illusion. If motion detection in the surround areas is critical\nfor the illusion, a radial pattern may not be the best surrounding texture for the illusion.\nMethod\nParticipants\nEight graduate or undergraduate students (aged 22\u00ad27, six males and two females) participated in\nExperiment 1. Before formal data collection, an experimenter confirmed that each participant per-\nceived the illusory motion in a typical stimulus that was considered to robustly produce the effect. All\nparticipants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity and gave informed consent before taking\npart in the experiments. None of them knew the purpose of the experiment.\nApparatus and stimuli\nThe stimuli were produced by a computer (Dell Inspiron 580s) and displayed on a 24-inch LCD\nin visual angle at a viewing distance of 35 cm. As shown in Figure 3, at the top of the screen, we\npresented three standard-stimulus figures with radially arranged sectors. In each figure, a yellow disc\nwas placed in the centre of 30 radial sectors on a light-grey background. The thickness of the sectors\nFigure 3. Schematic illustration of the experimental condition in Experiment 1. The centre dot indicates the\ntracked target moving horizontally. The upper radial patterns indicate standard stimuli. The lower patterns indicate\na test condition.\ndecreased towards the centre, maintaining the duty ratio at 50% along centric paths (see Figure 2a).\nThe diameters of the disc and the radial pattern were 5.9 deg and 16.6 deg in visual angle. The disc\ntively. At the bottom of the screen, we presented three test stimulus figures with varied surround\nstripes or plain backgrounds.\nIn the stripe conditions, the orientation of the surround stripes was horizontal or vertical. The\nwidth of the dark/light area in the stripe was varied in five, i.e. from 0.31 to 0.87/deg in a 50% duty\nratio, corresponding to the narrowest or the widest part of the dark sector of the standard stimulus.\nIn addition, three plain surround conditions were tested. Luminances of the three surrounds were\nground, the dark sectors and the average of the two, respectively. A control stimulus that was the same\nas the standard stimulus was also tested with the same procedure as used in the other conditions.\nIn Figure 3, the centre dot that subjects tracked moved horizontally between the standard (upper)\nand test (lower) stimuli. Under the vertical eye-movement conditions, the entire stimulus set was\nProcedure\nAt the top of the screen, the standard stimuli (radial condition) were presented and at the bottom of\nthe screen, the test stimuli were presented. A fixation dot (1.3 deg in diameter) was presented in the\ncentre of the screen. As shown in Figure 3, one second later, the fixation dot moved along a horizontal\nor vertical path (21.8 deg in length) at a speed of 10.9 deg/s. Subjects tracked the dot with their eyes\nkeeping their head fixed by a chin rest. After 16 seconds (four sets of round trips), the dot stopped\nand participants evaluated the strength of the illusory motion that appeared in the test stimulus. The\nillusion rating of 100 was defined as the score when the illusion strength in the test stimulus was the\nsame as that in the standard stimulus, whereas 0 was defined as the score when no illusory motion\nEffect of surrounding texture on the pursuit-pursuing illusion 24\nperception occurred. Over a 100- or under a 0-score (i.e. the illusory motion in the opposite direction)\nwas permitted for the rating.\nThere were 20 stripe conditions (5 grating widths  2 grating orientations  2 eye movement\ndirections), six plain surround conditions (3 luminance levels  2 eye movement directions) and one\ncontrol condition (the same figure as the standard stimulus). These were presented in a random order\nonce per session. Four sessions were conducted for each participant.\nResults and discussion\nFigure 4 presents the results of Experiment 1.As the figure clearly shows, in the vertical eye-movement\nconditions, the illusion strength was higher in the horizontal-stripe condition than in the vertical-stripe\ncondition. Inversely, in the horizontal eye-movement conditions, the illusion strength was higher in\nthe vertical-stripe condition than in the horizontal-stripe condition. Thus, when the stripe orientation\nand the eye movement direction were orthogonal, the illusion was strong. Conversely, when they were\nparallel, the illusion barely appeared (the scores were around 0).\nThe thinner stripe width had a higher rated illusion strength within the range tested. This was\ntrue for both the vertical eye-movement horizontal-stripe condition and the horizontal eye-movement\nvertical-stripe conditions. However, in the thinnest condition, the effect seems to reach the ceiling.\nThe effects under the plain background conditions changed depending on the luminance in the\nsurround area. When the surround was dark grey, i.e. in the same luminance as that of the dark stripes,\nno illusion occurred. When the surround was in the average luminance of the dark stripes and the light\nbackground in the stripe conditions, the strength of the illusion was slightly evident (this equiluminant\nFigure 4. Results from Experiment 1. Error bars indicate standard errors of the mean (SEs). Stripes in an\norientation that was orthogonal to the eye movement direction, especially in thin stripe conditions, produced\nstrong motion illusions while stripes in an orientation that was parallel to the eye movement direction did not\nproduce the illusion irrespective of the thickness. Homogeneous background conditions did not clearly produce\nthe illusion or even produced the opposite illusion. In no condition was the strength of the pursuit-pursuing\nillusion as strong as in the control condition.\nplain background condition was tested again in Experiment 4). When the surround was white, i.e. in\nthe luminance of the background in the stripe conditions, the illusion occurs in the opposite direction.\nThis may be a type of Filehne illusion (Filehne, 1922).\nA three-way ANOVA was conducted for the results in the stripe conditions to analyse the effects\nof the direction of eye movement (horizontal or vertical), the orientation of the stripes (parallel or\northogonal to eye movement direction) and the width of the stripes. The main effect of the stripe\nmovement direction was not significant (F(1, 7) 5 4.048, p  0.05), the interaction between the effect\nof the stripe orientation and the effect of the eye movement direction was significant (F(1, 7) 5 7.227,\np  0.05). A simple main effect of the eye movement direction in the orthogonal-stripe condition was\nstripe conditions. The difference in the rated illusion strength between the vertical- and horizontal\neye-movement direction conditions may be due to the smoother pursuit or the larger amplitude in the\neye tracking path in the horizontal eye-movement conditions. In both conditions, there was a standard\nstimulus with radially arranged sectors. However, the illusion strength rating may be partly affected\nby the overall experimental sequence, resulting in the lower ratings in the vertical eye-movement\nThis is clearly seen in Figure 4, i.e. the strength of the illusory effect changed according to the stripe\nwidth in the orthogonal orientation conditions while there was little illusion irrespective of the stripe\nwidth in the parallel orientation conditions. Multiple comparison tests (Ryan's method) revealed that\nthere were significant differences (p  0.05) between all the pairs of width conditions with orthogonal\nstripes except the pair of the thinnest and the second thinnest stripe conditions. The effect seems to\nreach the maximum possibly when the stripe is thinner than 0.47 deg, whereas the illusion was weaker\nwhen the stripes are thicker than that. The illusion ratings from the 0.31 deg stripe conditions were\ncompared with the rating of the control stimulus conditions. The difference between them was signifi-\neye movement). Even when the stripes that were orthogonal to the motion direction filled the entire\nsurround area, the illusion was still weaker than that with the radial sector surround.\nTwo contradicting results were acquired in Experiment 1. First, motion detection in the surround\nis important for the illusion because only surround stripes in an orientation orthogonal to the motion\ndirection cause the illusion. Ito (2012) demonstrated that the increasing luminance contrast between\nthe sectors and the background positively affected the strength of the illusion and that increasing the\nlength of the sectors also affected it positively. These results suggest that increasing motion signals\nin the surround increases the illusion strength, which fits the centre-surround relative-motion detector\nhypothesis. A similar tendency of peripheral-stripe-orientation dependency, as seen in Experiment 1,\nwas found in the strength of the Enigma illusion (Gori, Hamburger, & Spillmann, 2006). Gori and\ncolleagues showed that the illusory stream motion was strongest when the stripe orientation was\northogonal to a band in which the illusory stream was perceived. Hamburger (2007) also showed the\nimportance of orthogonal stripes in inducing the Enigma illusion. In our stimulus, both horizontal\nand vertical stripes were partly orthogonal to the edge of the centre disc; only vertical stripes were\northogonal to the motion direction when eye movement direction was horizontal. We are interested in\nthe similarity between the pursuit-pursuing illusion and the Enigma illusion (Ito, Tomimatsu, & Bai,\n2012) and, inversely, we think we can propose an explanation of the Enigma illusion from the point of\nthe relative-motion detector (Tomimatsu & Ito, 2012).\nSecond, only the amount of motion signals in the surround area does not determine the illusion\nstrength because the illusion with the orthogonally striped surround never exceeds the effect produced\nby the radial surround, which the hypothesis cannot explain. However, the present experiment dem-\nonstrated that although stronger motion signals by the surround filled with orthogonal stripes actually\nenhanced the illusion, compared to the parallel stripe surround, the motion signals from the radial\nsector pattern were more effective than those from the orthogonal striped patterns. The difference may\nbe critical for the illusion.\nAs for the stripe width, the thinner stripes produced stronger effects. Comparing the disc and\nthe stripe, the two had different spatial frequency components, i.e. the stripe had higher frequency\ncomponents than the disc. This difference might give the impression of having different velocities,\nEffect of surrounding texture on the pursuit-pursuing illusion 26\ni.e. the disc being slower, which could produce effective relative motion between them. Accordingly,\nthe higher spatial frequencies of the surround may have enhanced the relative motion. However, this\nhypothesis cannot explain the strongest effect of the radially arranged sectors.\nInterestingly, the stimulus proportion for the best illusion using stripes is similar to that for the\nOuchi illusion (Ashida, 2002). When the sizes of our stimulus were calculated for a left or right (i.e.\nperipheral) stimulus patch where the illusion was stronger than the centre patch, they were 16.0 deg\nfor the stripe pattern and 5.7 deg for the centre disc. In that case, the thinnest stripe had a spatial fre-\nquency of 3.3 c/deg. In Ashida (2002), when the outer disc size was 16 deg and the inner disc size was\n6 deg for a stripe version of the Ouchi illusion stimulus, the optimal spatial frequency was 3.4 c/deg.\nAlthough our stimulus was generally considered to be observed in more peripheral vision (typically\n23.6 deg in eccentricity) than Ashida (2002), it is surprising that the best proportions of the striped\nfigures were similar. This may suggest that the surface segmentation process suggested by Ashida\n(2002) is common between the two illusions when both illusion stimuli are produced by striped pat-\nterns. As seen in the Ouchi illusion, the centre disc in the present illusion is perceived as floating when\nthe illusion is strong.\nIn Experiment 2, we tested the relative-motion detector hypothesis again with a different surrounding\ntexture, i.e. random dots. Motion could be detected in every local part of the surround, the same as for\nthe surround filled with vertical stripes in horizontal motion.\nMethod\nParticipants\nEight students (aged 22\u00ad24, four males and four females) participated in Experiment 2. Seven of them\nparticipated also in Experiment 1. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity,\nand gave informed consent before volunteering in the experiments. None of them knew the purpose\nof the experiment.\nFigure 5. Results from Experiment 2. Error bars indicate SEs. Generally, the illusion ratings for random-dot\nconditions were very low compared with the ratings for the control condition. The ratings in the random-dot\nconditions were highest for the smallest dot-size condition. However, even this condition produced a weaker\neffect than the vertical-stripe conditions in Experiment 1.\nApparatus and stimuli\nThe apparatus was the same as in Experiment 1. Stimuli were a yellow disc on random dots. The\nhorizontal and vertical dot size was varied corresponding to the stripe widths used in Experiment 1 as\nshown in Figure 5. Half of the dots were dark grey and the other half white. Their luminances were\nthe same as those of the stripes and the background in Experiment 1. The two standard stimuli (the\nleft and right radial figures in the top row in Figure 3) were placed at the top of the screen while two\ntested stimuli were presented at the bottom (i.e. at the positions of the left and right radial figures in the\nbottom row in Figure 3). The other methods were the same as those in Experiment 1.\nProcedure\nThere were six stimulus conditions, i.e. five dot-size conditions and a control condition. The six con-\nditions were tested once per session in a random order. Four sessions were conducted for each par-\nticipant. After the data collection, a further small dot-size condition (the 0.16 deg condition) was\nadditionally tested.\nResults and discussion\nThe results are shown in Figure 5. As a whole, the ratings of the illusion strength were very low com-\npared with the control condition. These results again do not fit the centre-surround relative-motion\ndetector hypothesis. The differences among the ratings under the seven conditions were analysed by\nparisons (Ryan's method) revealed that the ratings under the smallest dot-size condition were higher\nthan those under the other dot-size conditions (p  0.05) and that the ratings under the control condi-\ntion were higher than those under the all dot-size conditions (p  0.05).\nWithin the tested dot sizes, the illusion favoured a smaller size. The smallest dot size here was\nsmaller than the width of the thinnest stripes in Experiment 1 and thinner than the thinnest part of\nthe sector used in the standard stimulus. With further smaller dots, the surround texture may become\nperceptually grey and not produce strong motion signals (approaching the equiluminant grey condi-\ntion in Experiment 4). However, the larger dots seem to weaken the illusory effect. We believe that\nrandom dots in a larger dot size broke local equiluminance around the disc edge, which inhibited the\nillusion from occurring. Another explanation is that the larger random dots were perceived as groups\nof subparts of textured areas. Giora and Gori (2010) reported that a smaller dot size or a random dot\npattern as a filled texture reduced the filled area illusion, compared with a larger dot size or a regular\nchecker pattern. In the filled area illusion, the perceptual area enlargement was reduced with a weaker\nsubparts' articulation while the present illusion was reduced with a background perceptually divided\ninto groups of subparts. It is possible that a background consisting of groups of subparts interferes\nwith the perception of the figure\u00adground relationship between the disc and the background random\ndots because some subparts of the random dot texture could be a figure. In the case of the background\nof radially arranged sectors, the sectors are clearly distinguishable and enhance the illusion when the\ncontrast is high (Ito, 2012). However, even in that case, the sectors are indistinguishable just around\nthe sectors, producing the impression of figure\u00adground relationship between the disc and the sectored\nbackground. As in Experiment 1, a difference in spatial frequency between the disc and the dots\ncould explain why the smaller dots produced a stronger effect. However, this factor cannot explain\nwhy dots cannot produce the illusory effect as strongly as a stripe or radially arranged sectors.\nThe weakness of the illusion in the random-dot condition, compared with the striped background\ncondition, is also seen in the Enigma illusion (Hamburger, 2007). One of the reasons for the random\ndots not producing a strong illusory effect may be that the centre disc was seen as being attached to the\nsurround, possibly because there was no T-junction or end-stop of the surrounding texture at the disc\ncontour. This explanation may be common to Hamburger (2007) or Gori et al (2006). In contrast, the\nstripes created T-junctions at the disc edge, which may have produced the impression of the disc being\nin front of the stripes. In addition, the radially arranged sectors created more T-junctions that touched\nthe disc contour orthogonally. The difference in their appearance, i.e. attached or floating, was com-\nmon with that caused by the difference in sector length (Ito, 2012), where short radial sectors appeared\nas attached to the centre disc and did not cause the illusion. In contrast, long radial sectors appeared as\nthe background of the centre disc that seemed to be floating in front of it and caused a strong illusion.\nIt is possible that, in addition to motion detection in the surround areas, the perceived figure\u00adground\nrelationship produced by the end-stops of stripes or radially arranged thin sectors affects the illusion.\nEffect of surrounding texture on the pursuit-pursuing illusion 28\nThe figure\u00adground relationship and perceived depth separation as a determinant of an illusory motion\neffect is also reported by Pinna and Spillmann (2002).\nThe stripes in an orientation orthogonal to the motion direction produced an illusory effect while the\nstripes in an orientation parallel to the motion direction did not contribute to the illusion in Experi-\nment 1. However, a radially arranged sector pattern including sectors in both orientations produced\nthe strongest illusion. Accordingly, we propose a modified hypothesis that the combination of the sur-\nround stripes in both orientations could produce a stronger illusion than do the whole-field orthogonal\nstripes, as seen in the radial sector stimulus. Particularly, when the eye movement was horizontal, the\ncombination of the vertical stripe in the top and bottom areas of the test stimulus and the horizontal\nstripes in the left and right areas could produce the illusion as strongly as seen in the radial sector\nstimulus. We hypothesize that the radial sectors could be replaced by the two components in orienta-\ntions both orthogonal and parallel to the motion direction. This stimulus configuration may fit a recep-\ntive field of a modified relative-motion detector shown in Figure 1d. In this model, horizontal motion\nis strongly detected in the top and bottom areas because the stripes are vertical, whereas motion is\nweakly detected in the middle area (between the top and bottom areas) because the sectors in the mid-\ndle area are nearly horizontal and the disc is equiluminant with the surround. Experiment 3 is aimed to\ntest the modified relative-motion detector hypothesis.\nMethod\nParticipants\nSeven graduate or undergraduate students (aged 22\u00ad25, four males and three females) participated\nin Experiment 3. Five also participated in Experiment 1 while the others did not. All participants had\nnormal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity, and gave informed consent before volunteering in the\nexperiments. None of the participants knew the purpose of Experiment 3.\nApparatus and stimuli\nThe apparatus was the same as that in Experiment 1. We divided the surround into four equal sector\nareas as shown in Figure 6a. The top and bottom areas were paired, the left and right areas were paired,\nand each paired area was filled with averaged luminance grey, horizontal stripes, vertical stripes or\nradial sectors; thereby, producing 16 combined surrounds. The horizontal or vertical stripe was the\nsame as the thinnest one used in Experiment 1, which produced the strongest illusion among the orthog-\nonal-stripe conditions. The radial sectors were the same as the control stimulus used in Experiment 1.\nProcedure\nThe eye movement direction was horizontal in all trials. The black dot to be tracked moved left-\nward for 2 seconds and then reversed direction. The round trip was repeated three times, i.e. the\nparticipants observed the stimulus for 12 seconds. Then, participants judged the illusion strength as in\nExperiment 1.\nOne session included 16 trials (4 surround patterns in the top-bottom area  4 surround patterns\nin the left-right areas). Four sessions were conducted for each participant. The order of the trials was\nrandomized within each session. The remaining procedure was the same as in Experiment 1.\nResults and discussion\nFigure 6 presents the results of Experiment 3. The graph clearly shows that grey or horizontal stripes\nslightly contributed to producing the illusion, that vertical stripes modestly contributed and that radial\nsectors greatly contributed. These effects did not depend on the presented area, i.e. the top-bottom or\nleft-right areas. The illusion produced by the radial surround was stronger than that produced by any\nother combination of the textures tested here.\nA two-way ANOVA was conducted to analyse the effects of the surround. The main effect of the\ntiple comparisons (Ryan's method) revealed that the difference between every pair of the four types\nof surrounds was significant (p  0.05) except the pair of grey and horizontal surrounds (p  0.05).\nThe main effect of the four types of surround in the left-right area was significant (F(3, 21) 5 47.111,\np  0.0001). Multiple comparisons (Ryan's method) revealed that the difference between every pair\nof the four types of the surrounds was significant (p  0.05) except the pair of grey and horizontal sur-\np  0.0001), revealing that the combination of radial sectors in both areas prominently enhanced the\nillusion.\nTo further analyse the position effect, we compared the following stimuli: horizontal stripes, ver-\ntical stripes or radial sectors in the left-right areas combined with the grey field in the top-bottom\nareas versus horizontal stripes, vertical stripes or radial sectors in the top-bottom areas combined with\nthe grey field in the left-right areas. A two-way ANOVA revealed that although the effect of the sur-\nround types (the horizontal stripe, vertical stripe or radial sectors) was significant (F(2, 14) 5 24.026,\np  0.0001), the effect of the presented position (the left-right areas or the top-bottom areas) was not\nto the illusion irrespective of the presented area. It is noteworthy that although the orientations of\nthe radial sectors in the left-right areas were near to the horizontal, i.e. the parallel orientation to the\nmotion direction, the effect was stronger than that of the vertical stripes.\nWe could make a simple model to predict the strength of the illusion appearing in a combined sur-\nround condition by adding the two illusory effects from each area. For example, the illusion strength\nin a combined surround consisting of vertical stripes at the top and bottom areas and horizontal stripes\nat the left and right areas might be predicted by the addition of illusion strength produced by verti-\ncal stripes at the top and bottom areas with plain grey areas at the left and right and illusion strength\nproduced by horizontal stripes at the left and right areas with plain grey areas at the top and bottom.\nFigure 7 presents a correlation between the rated illusion strength under the combined surround con-\nditions and the sum of rated illusion strength under each half-surround condition. The coefficient of\ndetermination was 0.92, indicating that 92% of variation in the illusion strength ratings in the com-\nbined surround condition is accounted for by the sum of the illusion strength ratings acquired in each\nhalf-surround condition. This indicates that there is little interaction between the two combined sur-\nround textures. Thus, a combination of different surrounds produces no new effect.\nFigure 6. Tested stimuli and the produced illusion strength. The stimulus matrix in the left panel corresponds to\nthe condition matrix in the graph in the right panel. Thin black lines above the bars indicate SEs.\nEffect of surrounding texture on the pursuit-pursuing illusion 30\nIn Experiment 3, we proposed the modified hypothesis that the combination of the surround com-\nponents in two orientations orthogonal or parallel to the motion direction could replace the radial\npattern. The assumed underlying mechanism was a modified version of the relative-motion detector\nshown in Figure 2d. Despite the results of Experiment 3 having rejected that hypothesis, they did\ndemonstrate that even the radial sector pattern in the left and right areas contributed to producing the\nillusion although the sector orientations in the areas were nearly parallel to the motion direction when\neyes move horizontally.\nExperiment 4 quantitatively measured the strength of the illusory effect. The experiments noted\nabove used a magnitude estimation method to test the illusion. Therefore, strictly, the illusory strength\nmeasured so far was limited to indicating the relative effectiveness among the tested stimulus condi-\ntions. Here, the illusion strength with various kinds of backgrounds was measured by comparing real\nand illusory motions to quantitatively show the amount of the illusion. In this experiment, the point of\neach participant's individual equiluminance between yellow and mid-grey was measured and used to\nset the luminance condition for each participant to see the best illusion.\nAnother purpose of Experiment 4 was to assess the contribution of equiluminance to the pursuit-\npursuing illusion. Ito (2012) showed that the pursuit-pursuing illusion was best observed when the\nluminance of the yellow disc was equal to the average of the sector and background luminances while\nthe illusion robustly arose even if the yellow disc luminance was apart from the precise equiluminance.\nOn the other hand, equiluminance itself could produce a similar motion illusion (Terao & Murakami,\n2011). It is possible that an individual best equiluminance setting drastically increases the illusory\neffect in the plain surround condition because the illusion with an equiluminant plain surround would\nbe quite sensitive to the difference between the disc and surround luminances. If the illusion strength\nwas equal between the radially arranged sector and plain surround conditions in this luminance setting,\nit would indicate that the essential of the pursuit-pursuing illusion is the equiluminance between the\ndisc and its surround and that the only role of the surround texture is to increase the tolerance to the\ndifference between the disc and the average surround luminances.\nMethod\nParticipants\nSix graduate or undergraduate students (aged 22\u00ad25, three males and three females) including the\nfirst author participated in Experiment 4. Four participants also participated in at least one experi-\nment noted above. Aside from the first author, no participants knew the purpose of the experiment.\nFigure 7. Correlation between illusion ratings from combined-texture surround conditions and addition of\nratings from each texture surround condition. The illusion strength under the combined-texture conditions can be\npredicted by simple addition of the effect of each texture component. See details in the text.\nAll participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity, and gave informed consent before\nvolunteering in the experiments.\nApparatus and stimuli\nThe apparatus was the same as that in Experiment 1. The luminances of the background and the sectors\nwere 137 cd/m2 and 69.7 cd/m2. The participants sat on a chair with a chin rest and tracked a black dot\nwith their eyes at a viewing distance of 35 cm.\nFigure 8 shows the schematic illustration of the stimulus display. In the centre of the screen, a\nhorizontally moving black dot was presented, which participants tracked with their eyes. The transla-\ntion speed was 10.9 deg/s. The length of the horizontal path was 21.8 deg. In the left-lower part, a\nstatic stimulus figure was presented. There were five background texture conditions; radially arranged\nsectors, vertical stripes, horizontal stripes, random dots and the equiluminant plain background. The\ndiameter of the whole radial shape was 16.6 deg and that of the central disc was 5.9 deg. The width of\nthe stripes and dots was 0.31 deg. The distance between the centre of the stimulus disc and the centre\nof the horizontal path of the dot motion was 28.0 deg.\nIn the lower-right part, a horizontally moving yellow disc was presented. The phase was matched\nwith that of the tracking target. The length of the horizontal path of the physical motion of the disc\nwith 10% steps). The diameter and the luminance of the physically moving disc were identical to that\nin the illusory figure. The distance between the stimulus disc and the centre of the physical motion path\nof the compared disc was 30.4 deg.\nProcedure\nBefore measuring the illusion, an individual equiluminance was set where the yellow disc luminance\nwas effectively equated to the averaged luminances of the surrounding grey (103.5 cd/m2, i.e. the\naverage of the sector and background luminances) by heterochromatic flicker photometry. During the\nmeasurement of equiluminance, participants fixated a cross presented at the centre of the horizontal\npath of the dot motion to be tracked. The yellow and grey squares were alternated at 10 Hz in the\nscreen position where the stimulus was presented. Keeping their fixation on the cross, the participants\nadjusted the yellow luminance by button pressing to minimize the perceived flicker. Four measure-\nments were conducted for each participant. The average of the measured values was used to set the\nyellow disc luminance for each participant.\nThe amount of the illusion was measured with a method of limits. Participants judged which\nmotion impression was stronger, the physical motion of the matching disc or the illusory horizontal\nmotion, while tracking the physically translating dot with the eyes, as shown in Figure 8. Six meas-\nFigure 8. Schematic illustration of the stimulus configuration. The horizontally moving dot was tracked by eyes.\nThe matching disc moved horizontally in phase with the dot.

We can see the effect of equilu-\nminance itself in the plain surround condition. While the individual equiluminance setting disclosed\nthe effect, the illusion strength was not strong compared to that in the other conditions. A one-way\nANOVA revealed that the effect of the surround textures was significant (F(4, 20) 5 36.619, p \n0.0001). Multiple comparisons (Ryan's method) revealed that all pairs, except for the pair of the\nhorizontal-stripe and plain surround conditions and the pair of the random-dot and plain surround\nconditions, showed significant differences (p  0.05). These results are consistent with the results\nacquired from Experiments 1 and 2. That is, the radially arranged sectors produced the best illusion,\nfollowed by the vertical-stripe condition, while the horizontal-stripe and plain-surround conditions\nproduced slight effects (Experiment 1). The illusion strength in the random-dot condition was between\nthe vertical-stripe and horizontal-stripe (or plain surround) conditions in their rated values (Experi-\nment 2). The little effect of equiluminance in the previous experiments is explained by the differences\nin individual equiluminance point and by the contrast in illusion strength between the plain surround\ncondition and the radially arranged sector condition (as a standard stimulus). The illusion arising under\nthe horizontal-stripe condition in Experiment 4 may come from the equiluminance between the disc\nand the average surround luminances. However, the effects found in the radially arranged sector and\nvertical-stripe conditions were much larger than that in the plain surround condition and, therefore,\ncannot be explained only by the effect of equiluminance. On the other hand, the illusion found in the\nradially arranged sector and vertical-stripe conditions may be also enhanced by the individual equilu-\nminance setting.\nIn short, the results of the subjective ratings were quantitatively confirmed here. The effect of equi-\nluminance itself actually existed but was not so strong as to explain the pursuit-pursuing illusion. In\nFigure 9. Matched path length of physical motion to produce subjectively equal motion impressions to the illusory\nmotion. Error bars indicate SEs.\nother words, the effect of equiluminance is one component of the pursuit-pursuing illusion.Astriped sur-\nround may add a factor of relative motion. The radially arranged sectors may add a further figural factor.\nWe conducted two additional experiments, Experiments 5 and 6. Experiment 5 investigated the effect\nof oblique components. One possible difference between the radial pattern and the tested stripes in\nExperiments 1 and 3 is the existence of oblique components. In some illusory motion figures, motion\ncomponents that are detected in an oblique orientation and the aperture problem for the oblique motion\nseem to be important to produce illusory motion that is orthogonal to the retinal motion. For example,\nthe Pinna\u00adBrelstaff illusion (Pinna & Brelstaff, 2000) is considered to be induced by detected oblique\nmotion components owing to the implicit figural oblique components in the micropattern (Gurnsey,\nSally, Potechin, & Mancini, 2002; Gurnsey & Pag\u00e9, 2006). In the Rotating-Tilted-Line illusion, lines\nthat are oblique to motion directions explicitly exist (Gori & Hamburger, 2006; Gori & Yazdanbakhsh,\ntion in an oblique orientation. The recently discovered accordion grating illusion (Gori et al., 2011;\nGori, Giora, Yazdanbakhsh, & Mingolla, 2013; Yazdanbakhsh & Gori, 2011) has been demonstrated to\narise from the aperture problem for oblique retinal motion.\nThe radial sectors included figural components that are oblique to motion direction. These oblique\nfigural components may induce motion detection in oblique directions that could be ambiguous in\nthe interpreted motion direction owing to the aperture problem for motion. Experiment 5 investigated\nwhether the radial sector pattern could be replaced by a combination of oblique stripes.\nMethod\nEight graduate or undergraduate students (aged 22\u00ad24, four males and four females) participated. Six\nalso participated in at least one experiment described above while the others did not.\nThe surround area was divided in four, i.e. top-left, top-right, bottom-left and bottom-right areas.\nThe stimuli were presented in Figure 10. In all conditions, the width of the oblique stripe was the same\nas the thinnest one used in Experiment 1. The seven stimuli were tested in two eye movement direc-\ntions, i.e. left to right or right to left, because four of the seven stimulus figures were not horizontally\nsymmetrical. The other methods were the same as those in Experiment 2.\nFigure 10. Effects of oblique stripes on the illusion. Error bars indicate SEs. Combinations of oblique stripes\ncannot produce the illusion at an adequate strength.\nEffect of surrounding texture on the pursuit-pursuing illusion 34\nResults and discussion\nResults indicate that any of the stimulus figures with oblique stripes could not match the illusory effect\nof the control figure, i.e. the ratings never exceeded 40. Particularly, in the Diamond condition, little\nillusion was reported. The most important figural characteristic of the Diamond figure would be that\nthe oblique stripes in it touched the disc almost in parallel to the disc contour. The centre disc was seen\nas being fused to the oblique lines in the Diamond figure, whereas the centre disc in the pseudo-radial\nfigure was seen as being in front of the oblique stripes. Clear T-junctions and perceptual depth separation\nof the disc from the surround might be one of the factors that enhances the illusion as previously noted.\nA two-way ANOVA shows that the main effect of the seven stimulus types was significant (F(6,\ndifferences between the control and the other conditions (p  0.05) and between the pseudo-radial and\nthe Diamond conditions (p  0.05). The other pairs did not show any significant differences (p  0.05).\nThe main effect of eye-movement direction was not significant (F(1, 7) 5 2.978, p  0.05). The inter-\nthat the radial sector pattern cannot be replaced by a combination of oblique stripes in two orientations\nperpendicular to each other.\nExperiment 3 demonstrated that the radially arranged sectors contribute to producing the illusion\nirrespective of the presented areas, and thus, the sector orientations. Even the sectors in an orientation\nnearly parallel to the pursuit direction contributed to the effect as well as did the sectors in an orthogo-\nnal orientation, although stripes in an orientation perfectly parallel to the pursuit direction made no\ncontribution. Ito et al. (2012) showed that the illusion strength depended only on the percentage in the\nsurround area where radially arranged sectors were presented irrespective of both the pursuit direc-\ntion and the presented areas. This result corresponds well to the results in Experiment 3. These results\nsuggest that the radial pattern is a special figure that cannot be replaced by combinations of stripes.\nWe conducted another additional experiment to investigate the effect of the relative position shift of\nthe yellow disc within the radial sectors on the production of the illusion. Even if the radial sectors\nexist as a globally structured background, the locally surrounding texture touching the disc changes\nwith the changes in disc position on the radial pattern.\nFigure 11. Results showing the effect of disc position offsets. Error bars indicate SEs. Even if the shift of the disc\ndoes not reveal the radiation centre (38% condition), the illusion is greatly reduced.\nMethod\nEight graduate or undergraduate students (aged 22\u00ad28, three males and five females) participated.\nSeven also participated in at least one experiment described above while one did not. The amount of\nhorizontal or vertical shift in disc position was varied, i.e. 0 (the centre, i.e. control), 38% or 78% of\ndisc diameter in a left, right, above or below direction, as shown in Figure 11. The size of the radial\npattern was 21.8 deg in diameter. The other methods were the same as those in Experiment 2.\nResults and discussion\nWhen the disc was at the centre of the radial pattern, the illusion was strong. However, when the disc\nposition was shifted, the rated illusion strength was markedly weakened. The decrease in strength\nwas more rapid in horizontal shift conditions. A 38% shift in disc position left the centre of the radial\npattern still behind the disc. However, the occlusion of the radiation centre was not a critical factor in\nproducing a strong illusion. As the horizontal shift increased, the directly surrounding texture became\nsimilar to horizontal stripes. In contrast, as the vertical shift increased, the directly surrounding texture\nbecame similar to vertical stripes. This may explain why the illusion remained relatively strong in the\n38% vertical shifted condition, whereas the discs that were 78% shifted in any direction produced a\nvery weak illusion.\nA two-way ANOVA was conducted. The main effect of shift direction (up-, down-, left- or right-\nthat the differences were significant for all pairs of direction conditions except the pair of upward and\ndownward conditions and the pair of leftward and rightward conditions (p  0.05). The main effect\nshift direction was significant in the 38% condition (p  0.001), but not significant in the 78% condi-\ntion (p  0.05) where little illusory effect was perceived as seen in Figure 11.\nConsequently, this experiment demonstrated that the radial sector pattern must radiate from the\ndisc centre creating a symmetrical surround texture to produce a strong illusion. Thus, the radial tex-\nture as an illusion producer here acts not only as a global background of the disc but also as a local\nstimulus structure around the disc.\n8 General Discussion\nSummary of the results\nThrough the four experiments, we investigated how the surrounding texture affected the strength of\nthe illusory motion of the centre disc, i.e. the pursuit-pursuing illusion. First, we tested a hypothesis\nthat the centre-surround relative-motion detector caused the illusion. In Experiment 1, the stripes in\nan orientation orthogonal to the motion direction produced the stronger illusion than those in a paral-\nlel orientation. Although this result is consistent with the centre-surround relative-motion detector\nhypothesis (Figure 2c), the maximum illusion strength caused by the stripes was less than that caused\nby a figure with the radial sector surround. Experiment 2 tested the hypothesis again but employing\nrandom dots. The results demonstrated that the surround consisting of smaller dots produced an illu-\nsory effect, although the effect was much weaker than that of a radial sector surround. In Experiment 3,\nwe examined a modified hypothesis that a combination of stripes in orthogonal and parallel orien-\ntations strengthened the illusion, assuming a modified receptive field of a relative-motion detector\n(Figure 2d). We tested various combinations of stripes and radial sectors. The results demonstrated\nthat there was no new effect by combining the stripes and that the radial sectors produced a stronger\nillusion than the stripes in an orientation orthogonal to the motion direction, irrespective of the pre-\nsented areas. These results showed that the motion signals in the surround area are important in caus-\ning the illusion. However, an effect as large as that obtained from the radial sector surround cannot be\nobtained from the surround consisting of stripes orthogonal to the pursuit direction, a combination of\nstripes or random dots.\nPhysiological correspondence\nIt is well known that V5/MT cells show a centre-surround antagonism for motion detection (Allman\net al., 1985; Born & Tootell, 1992) as we assumed in Experiment 1. However, as noted above, a simple\ncentre-surround relative-motion detector model as shown in Figure 2b cannot completely explain our\nEffect of surrounding texture on the pursuit-pursuing illusion 36\nresults. In addition, the modified model as shown in Figure 2d could not predict the results. Further-\nmore, another model shown in Figure 2e had difficulty in producing the effect when the motion direc-\ntion is horizontal because assimilation would occur between the centre disc and the top-bottom areas,\nresulting in no illusion. Motion signals from the left-right areas may be weak. Probably the overlapped\nreceptive fields of several types of cells, including cells with an asymmetric-inhibitory field, contrib-\nute to producing the illusion. In MT cells, a receptive field with an asymmetric-inhibitory surround\nwas observed more frequently than that with bilaterally symmetric-inhibitory surrounds or that with\na circularly symmetric-inhibitory surround (Xiao, Raiguel, Marcar, Koenderink, Orban, 1995; Xiao,\nOne important property of a V5/MT cell is that, under a low contrast display condition, the func-\ntion shifts the surround inhibition to the spatial summation of motion signals (Pack, Hunter, & Born,\nproduce the illusion even under a low contrast condition. Although a low contrast between the sectors\nand the background actually reduces the illusory effect, a simple grey surround still produces some\neffect. Thus, it is possible to separate the two factors to induce the illusion, i.e. the surround effect\nby the radially arranged background and the equiluminance between the disc and the surround. This\npoint should be further examined by collecting quantitative data. One possible approach would be to\nemploy an rTMS technique. Tadin et al. (2011) succeeded in reducing the surround suppression at V5\nby rTMS, revealing spatial summation of motion in a large visual field. Ruzzoli et al (2011) found\nthat rTMS targeting V5 weakened the illusory stream perception of Enigma. Whether rTMS targeting\nV5 also erases the present illusion or not could be a direct test of the centre-surround relative-motion\ndetector hypothesis.\nFrom the point of stimulus size, another approach is possible. We typically used radially arranged\nsector patterns 16.0 deg and centre disc 5.7 deg in diameter at an eccentricity of 23.6 deg although the\neccentricity of the stimulus changed according to eye movement. The size of the excitatory centre of\nmacaque MT cells with an inhibitory surround was reported by Raiguel, Van Hulle, Xiao, Marcar, and\nOrban (1995). According to them, at the eccentricity of 23.6 deg, the size is estimated as 5.6 deg. This\nis very close to the size of the centre yellow disc used in this study. The inhibitory surround is supposed\nto extend to a very wide area. It is possible to apply a model of a V5/MT cell as a centre-surround\nrelative-motion detector to this illusion in the point of receptive field size. We have informally observed\nthat the stimulus size (and disc size) for the best illusory effect closely relates to eccentricity. The\npresent stimulus is not seen to move when observed in foveal vision. In parafoveal vision, the stimulus\nshould be much smaller to produce the illusion. Distribution of optimized stimulus sizes measured at\nvarious eccentricity might be a clue to brain sites to respond to the illusion even if the relative-motion\ndetection hypothesis is not valid. At the same time, we should consider that brain sites other than V5/\nMT also show centre-surround antagonism for motion and that attention can modulate the size of a\nclassical receptive field size of V5/MT cells (Anton-Erxleben, Stephan, & Treue, 2009).\nThe effect of stripe width\nExperiment 1 showed the effect of stripe width. This could indicate a spatial frequency tuning of the\nillusion-inducing mechanism. Here, we used stripes in a square-wave luminance profile. To precisely\ninvestigate the spatial frequency tuning, stripes in a sine-wave luminance profile should be used. Vary-\ning the spatial frequency together with the presented retinal position and the size of the stimulus, a\ncertain form of magnification factor will be found. As noted in Experiment 1, the best proportion\nbetween the outer disc size, the inner disc size, and the fundamental spatial frequency of the stripe for\nthe present illusion is similar to that of the Ouchi illusion when both illusions are produced by gratings.\nIt is worth testing whether the most appropriate proportion producing the present illusion is constant\nagainst the eccentricity changes.\nHowever, for radially arranged sectors, the varied width of the stripes is included in the figure\nbecause the sector width was narrow around the centre disc and wide at the periphery. Thus, it is\npossible that the best width of stripes is almost always found in the radial sector figure, resulting\nin a robust motion illusion. Random dots in the surround, however, did not cause a strong illusion\ndespite their inclusion of various spatial frequency components in various orientations. When the dot\nsize was large, the evenness of the local luminance distribution was broken; thereby, breaking the\nequiluminance between the disc and the surrounding texture. In addition, large dot size makes the\nfigure\u00adground relationship in the stimulus ambiguous. We plan to reproduce the random-dot stimulus\nthrough various spatial frequency filters. These approaches may contribute to determining the spatial\nfrequency tuning of the illusion-inducing mechanism.\nAccuracy of detected motion direction\nOne may argue that the radial pattern includes many oriented figural components, resulting in accurate\nmotion-direction detection. This condition may activate relative-motion detectors that could be highly\ntuned for the preferred orientation. In the orthogonal stripe pattern, orthogonal motion components are\nambiguous because of the aperture problem for motion. Thus, the detected motion direction includes\ncertain degree of ambiguity. However, in Experiment 2, we used random dots as a surrounding texture\nand demonstrated that the effect of random dots on producing the illusion is limited. The random dots\nmay include many spatial frequency components in any orientation, which may result in accurate\ndetection of the motion direction. Thus, we do not believe that accurate detection of the motion direc-\ntion leads to a strong illusory effect in a radial sector pattern.\nA radial pattern as an illusory figure\nThe appearance of the centre disc is another possible factor added by a radial pattern. It is possible\nthat when the disc appears as floating in front of the surrounding texture, it tends to cause an illusory\neffect compared to the disc appearing as attached to the surround. For example, as Pinna, Spillmann,\nand Ehrenstein (2002) reported, the disc in the centre of a radial pattern appears to be floating and\nscintillating. Moreover, the disc in our typical figure (the control stimulus in all experiments) appears\nto be floating and scintillating (Takahashi, Fukuda, Watanabe, & Ueda, 2012). Pinna and Spillmann\n(2002) and Ashida (2002) suggested that the segregation of figure and ground contributes to inducing\nillusory motion. However, the disc on the random-dot texture or on the stripes forming a diamond\ndoes not appear to float on the background. It is plausible that a perceptually floating object is easier\nto move perceptually than is an object perceptually attached to or fused with the surrounding texture.\nWe believe that the correlation between the scintillating lustre illusion and the pursuit-pursuing illu-\nsion should be investigated. It is possible that these illusions are two aspects of the same phenomenon\nsharing the same visual mechanism.\nRecently, Sokoliuk and VanRullen (2013) found that the occipital alpha rhythm of the electroen-\ncephalogram (EEG) showed a correlation with the appearance of the illusory flicker of a static wheel\nstimulus with 32 spokes (the Flickering Wheel illusion). Our typical stimulus precisely corresponds\nto a centre disc placed on their typical stimulus. In fact, as noted above, we see some flicker or scintil-\nlation in our stimulus. We do not think that the alpha rhythm of EEG produces the present illusion.\nHowever, from a physiological point of view, it is possible that radially arranged sectors are a special\npattern where physiological activity in the brain appears as a visual phenomenon.\nRetinal and extraretinal signals for motion\nInteractions between retinal and extraretinal motion signals could produce motion illusions. The\nFilehne illusion is considered to be induced by the underestimation of eye movement signals coming\nfrom an extraretinal origin, e.g. efference copy. However, when retinal signals for motion are weaker,\nthe Filehne illusion can be reversed. Freeman and Banks (1998) showed that a test grating at a spatial\nfrequency of 0.25 cycle/deg or lower was seen to move in the direction of pursuit eye movement. Terao\nand Murakami (2011) showed a similar effect using an equiluminant target. The present illusion is\nsimilar to their effects but can be only partly explained by them. In Experiment 4, the illusory motion\nin an equiluminant disc without surround texture is not as strong as with a background of orthogonal\nstripes or radially arranged sectors. Thus, although weak retinal motion signals certainly produce the\nreversed Fhilene illusion, the strength explains only a part of the present illusion.\nEven without extraretinal signals, this illusion strongly arises although the appearance of the\nillusion is different as shown in Figure 1. We have demonstrated this illusion to many na\u00efve people\nusing a printed stimulus figure, with the method shown in Figure 2 in Ito (2012), and found that all\nof them could see the illusion of stillness or illusory motion in the direction opposite to the physi-\ncal motion direction. The fact that there is no need to track a moving target by eye movement may\nproduce smoother retinal motion of the figure, resulting in a strong illusion experience, especially\nfor people who are not good at smooth pursuit eye movement. We think that extraretinal signals\nchange the appearance of the illusion but may not add another component that enhances the present\nillusion.\nEffect of surrounding texture on the pursuit-pursuing illusion 38\n9 Conclusion\nHere, we conclude that the centre-surround relative-motion detector hypothesis (as shown in Figure 2c)\nor its modified version (Figure 2d) alone cannot completely explain the illusion. Stripes and dots that\ncarry many motion signals cannot substitute for the radial pattern that produces the strongest illusion.\nHowever, it is also clear that motion detection in the surround is important. Although equiluminance\nbetween the centre and surround areas enhances the illusion, the effect is not strong compared to that\nof the radial surround texture. It is worth trying to revise the relative-motion detection model for the\nillusion to directly or indirectly manage radial components.\nSeveral motion illusions have been reported in a radial or circular stimulus configuration (Fraser\nor observed with back and forth head movement. However, they could also occur in their straight\nversions of the stimulus configurations. That is, the circular or radial stimulus configuration may not\nbe necessary for the illusions to occur. However, to some degree, the effect in the pursuit-pursuing\nillusion depends on the radial stimulus configuration, although the illusion-producing motion is one-\ndimensional. This is an exclusive characteristic of this illusion.\nAt present, we think that the pursuit-pursuing illusion consists of three factors, i.e. weak motion\ndetection of the central disc due to equiluminance or lower spatial frequency, relative motion detection\nbetween the disc and the surround, and some illusory effect originating in the radial configuration. The\nlast factor may be partly common among the illusory figures in Ehrenstein (1941), MacKay (1957),\nUniversity P & P program and Grants for Promising Research Projects, Department of Design, Kyushu University.\nReferences\nAllman, J., Miezin, F., & McGuinness, E.
