Subsequently, various strategies have been formulated to alleviate poverty. But what are actually the components\nof the destructive force of poverty in the vision of contemporary Muslim scholars? What kind of Islamic strategies have\nthey formulated out of this vision? This article seeks to answer these two main questions by first investigating into the\ncontemporary vision of poverty that has been adopted by Muslim scholars, followed second by an investigation into the\nstrategies for poverty alleviation they proposed, and third, by critically analyzing their vision of poverty and strategies from\nan Islamic perspective. Based on a textual analysis of references, this article displays an inadequacy of the vision and strategies\nof the contemporary Muslim scholars for ignoring material-spiritual definition of poverty, as well as for formulating strategies\nfor poverty alleviation using an exogenous, top-down approach. In a nutshell, this article attempts to provide a justification\nfor rescrutinization of the vision of poverty from an Islamic perspective, and for a reconstruction of the poverty alleviation\nstrategies based on the faith of the Muslim communities themselves.\n",

More specifi-\ncally, it has the following two objectives. First, to investigate\nthe vision of poverty and strategies for poverty alleviation of\ncontemporary Muslim scholars; and second, to analyze the\nstrategies for poverty alleviation that have been considered\nas Islamic. In so doing, this article is divided into two main\nsections. The first paints the backdrop of the whole discus-\nsion by highlighting the contemporary vision of poverty and\nthe contemporary \"Islamic\" strategies of poverty alleviation.\nThe second delves into critical analysis of the contemporary\n\"Islamic\" strategies for poverty alleviation.\nIndeed, this article is a preliminary groundwork that\nstrictly focuses only on the understanding of the vision of\npoverty and strategies for poverty alleviation of contempo-\nrary Muslim scholars. It neither intends to provide a specific\ndetailed redefinition of poverty, nor does it formulates the\nmeasurements for the identification of individuals infected by\nmoral and spiritual poverty.An in-depth study on the redefini-\ntion of poverty and the measurements for the identification of\nsuch individuals--with the support of the verses from the\nHoly Qur'an, sayings of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon\nhim), and works of classical scholars--need to be addressed\nmeticulously in a separate paper.\nThe Backdrop\nAs an effort to paint the backdrop of this article, the main-\nstream vision of poverty and the so-called \"Islamic strate-\ngies\" in poverty alleviation are discussed below. The former\nreflects the general perception of scholars on poverty while\nthe latter shows how such a perception has shaped the strate-\ngies for poverty alleviation proposed by the Muslim writers.\nMainstream Vision of Poverty\nAlmost all Muslim scholars who write on poverty, irrespec-\ntive of their ideological underpinnings, seem to dislike pov-\nerty. They do not only perceive poverty as having negative\n1Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nMuhammad Syukri Salleh, Centre for Islamic Development Management\nStudies (ISDEV), Universiti Sains Malaysia, Minden, Penang 11800,\nMalaysia.\nEmail: syukri54@gmail.com\nContemporary Vision of Poverty and\nIslamic Strategy for Poverty Alleviation\nMuhammad Syukri Salleh1\n Keywords\npoverty, Islamic vision of poverty, poverty alleviation strategy\n2 SAGE Open\nnature in itself but also implicate negative consequences to\nindividuals, society, and nations. Poverty is regarded as\nbeing one of the worst problems in society (Nofal, 1984), as\na dangerous social problem (al Qaradawi, 2002), as the most\nterrible social ills and main enemy to nation's development\nplanning (Abdullah, 1984), as a social time bomb (Fadhil,\nhuman's beliefs and to the security and stability of the soci-\nety as a whole (Salih, 1999, p. 91), as disrupting human dig-\nnity and stability of a nation (Fadhil, 1992), as not only an\neconomic phenomena but also a social and political problem\nand society, aqidah and belief, thinking and culture, and fam-\nily and races as a whole (al Qardhawi, 1980).\nSimultaneously, the negative consequences of the pov-\nerty are also highlighted. They argued that poverty degrades\nMuslim's dignity (Ahmad, 1991), emerging along with\nunemployment, catastrophes, indebtedness, unequitable\nincome distribution, and so on (al Qaradawi, 2002), to vari-\nous evils, including apostasy (irtidad/ar-riddah) (Fadhil,\n1992), leading to crimes and hatred between rich and poor\n(Nofal, 1984), leading to untold sufferings resulting in beg-\nging (Sadeq, 2002, p. 17), entailed with the decline of many\nempires and civilization following the struggle between the\nhaves and the have-nots (Iqbal, 2002, p. 1), leading to inca-\npacity, helplessness, and dependence on others, driving a\nperson close to disbelief, and it is in fact in conflict with\nhuman dignity (Chapra, 2008). As poverty is regarded as the\nroot of many crimes and misdeeds, it jeopardizes the moral,\nsocial, and spiritual standards of a society; creates imbal-\nances in social and moral aspects as much as of an individ-\nthe freedom of choice and actions that can help them getting\nrid of deprivation (Ahmed, 2004, p. 45). All in all, poverty\nis seen as serious not only from a humanitarian point of\nview but also from an Islamic point of view because abject\npoverty is incompatible with Islamic ideology (Ariff, 1988,\nBased on such a disastrous nature and consequences of\nthe poverty, these writers make a firm stance on poverty.\nQardhawi (1980) pushes that poverty must be handled,\nobstructed, and fought. Fadhil (1992) argues that poverty\nerty is a Holy War (jihad). Ahmad (1991) perceives that\nfighting poverty is equal to upholding dignity. Al-Qardhawi\ncould be launched due to poverty, and that Caliph Abu Bakar\nAl-Siddiq's war against those who refused to pay zakat (ar-\nriddah) could be considered as a war against poverty (al-\nharb `al faqr). It is said to be the first war in Islamic history\nto protect the fate of the oppressed poor. Ahmed (2004) pro-\nposes poverty eradication through the provision of basic\nneeds of every citizen and regards it as a duty of every\nMuslim society. Chapra (2008) issues a stance that taking\ncare of the basic needs of the poor is a collective obligation\n(fard kifayah) of a Muslim society. In terms of social impact\ntribution of income and the state uses it for the purpose of\nalleviating poverty. Zakat is also designed to promote the\nwelfare function of the public expenditure. The argument is\nquite similar to those of Nodal (as cited in Sadeq, 1994, p.\n17) who explains the function of zakat to eradicate poverty\nand argues that poverty is one of the worst problems in a\nand economic inequalities is one of the primary objectives of\nthe Islamic economics system and Islamic banking can play\nan important role in achieving this objective.\nContemporary \"Islamic\" Strategies for Poverty\nAlleviation\nDiscussion on the strategies that have been undertaken both\nin Islam and mainstream domain are definitely huge and do\nnot adequately fit into the limited space of this article. It is\nacknowledged that the mainstream strategies in alleviating\npoverty have gained a considerable accomplishment, in spite\nof their `tangibility-centred' nature that denies spiritual\ndomain, hence becoming un-holistic. However, this paper\ndoes not mean to deliberate on the accomplishment and the\nun-holistic strategies. Instead, this paper only concentrates\non the so-called Islamic strategies for poverty alleviation as\nare suggested by certain authors, with a brief introduction of\nan overall strategies.\nIn general, poverty alleviation strategies could be said to\nthe Gross Domestic Product (GDP), hoping that it would\n\"trickle-down\" to the poor. But this was much to be desired.\nSecond, in the 1970s, the attention shifted to direct provision\nof nutritional, health, and educational needs of the poor as a\nmatter of public policy. But this was realized that it was not\nsustainable in the long run as it puts heavy burden on govern-\nshifted to efficient labor-intensive pattern of development\nand increase of investment in human capital formation. But it\nwas found that promotion of labor-intensive growth is diffi-\ncult, provision of basic services to the poor requires more\npublic spending and involves the trade-off between the inter-\nests of the poor and the non-poor, and there were misman-\nagement of public funds and corruption. Fourth, in 2000s,\nthe strategy shifted to promoting opportunities, facilitating\nempowerment, and enhancing securities. This was based on\nthe realization on the importance of the participation of the\npoor in decision making, better governance of public funds,\nand protection of the poor from economic and natural shocks\nthrough public policies. The strategy involves, inter alia, pro-\nvision of material opportunities such as jobs, credits, and\ninfrastructure; cohesive pattern and quality of growth, mar-\nket reforms that reflect local institutional and structural\nconditions, greater equity in the distribution of income,\naccess to market opportunities and public sector services;\nsound, responsive, and accountable institutions; reduction of\nvulnerability to economic shocks, natural disasters; ill health\nand disability; building assets of poor people; diversifying\nhousehold activities; and providing a range of insurance\nmechanisms to cope with adverse shocks.\nFor the poverty alleviation through Islamic approach,\nIqbal (2002) starts with a belief that strategies for poverty\nalleviation involve two trade-offs, that is, first, between inter-\nests of the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots,\" and second, between\nthe role of public sector versus the market (pp. 12-13). For the\nfirst trade-off, he comes back to the very worldview of the\nIslamic teaching, that life in this world, and the context of\npoverty, the difference in income and wealth, is actually a\ntest. Those bestowed by Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala (May He\nbe glorified and exalted) (SWT) with high income and wealth\nneed to share the resource with the poor, and the poor, while\nnot grudging against the rich, are assured to be richly rewarded\nin the life Hereafter for bearing their hardship patiently.\nAs for the trade-off between the public sector and the\nmarket, Iqbal (2002) suggests an \"institutional approach\" to\nachieve its redistributive goals (pp. 13-20). The market as an\ninstitution is allowed to play its role, while other institutions,\nsuch as zakah, awqaf, takaful, irfaq (non-profit sector), and\nso on, become supplements to correct some in-built tenden-\ncies in the market solutions.\nThe above idea of alleviating poverty through the \"institu-\ntional approach,\" as Iqbal (2002, p. 13) terms it, has become\none of the main approaches advocated by many Muslim\nscholars. In realizing the zakat, for instance, Yasin and Tahir\n(2002) advocates full-scale Islamization, as opposed to a less\nefficient policy such as maintaining the status quo, introduc-\ning zakat only, and replacement of interest with profit shar-\npermanent mechanism from within the economy in continu-\nous transferring of income from the rich to the poor, with the\naim to enrich and remove the later completely from poverty\nlevel through sufficient income and ability to take charge of\nall their needs by themselves. According to him, the basic\nobjective of zakat indeed is to solve poverty, along with other\nsocial problems such as unemployment, catastrophes, indebt-\nedness, inequitable income distribution, and so on. This\ncould be done by providing the poor and the needy, as two of\neight groups of recipients of zakat (asnaf), with necessary\neducation, training, and capital equipment.\nMore direct that manifests the institutional approach is\nthe writing by Ahmed (2004). He believes that zakat, along\nwith awqaf, are able to play a role in policies of redistribu-\ntion of assets and opportunities, capacity building and\nwealth creation, and extending income support, hence alle-\n15-18) believes in the ability of zakat and awqaf to play a\nrole in policies of redistribution of assets and opportunities,\ncapacity building and wealth creation, and extending income\nsupport. He suggests four approaches in alleviating poverty\nthrough the zakat and awqaf institutions: first, by integrat-\ning zakat and awqaf into the overall development scheme;\nsecond, by introducing laws and regulations that can create\nincentives for the proper functioning of zakat and awqaf\ninstitutions and establishing institutions that operate in an\nefficient and transparent ways; third, by introducing effec-\ntive organizational structures that could build trust among\npeople to maximize collection/revenues; and fourth, by cre-\nating institutional development and diversity, with the help\nof various institutions using contemporary organizational\nstructures and instruments to reinforce the endeavors in\npoverty alleviation.\nAwqaf is also perceived as one of the irfaq (nonprofit) sec-\ntors that is able to support the elimination of interest in\naccomplishing redistributional function, hence poverty alle-\nawqaf system could help in reducing government expendi-\nture, hence reducing budget deficit, the need for government\nborrowing, curbing the crowding-out effect, reduction in\ninterest rates, removing major impediment to private invest-\nment and growth, as well as solving the problem of under-\nsupply of public goods.\napproach by going beyond the institutions of zakat and awqaf\nper se to include positive roles of other Islamic economics\ninstitutions as well. Apart from zakat (which he terms as\ninvoluntary sadaqat or compulsory tax on idle wealth/\nincome after the nisab is met), he also mentions ushr (com-\npulsory payment in the form of tax from the produce of land\nor specifically zakat on the produce of land); voluntary con-\ntributions such as hibah, waqf, gifts, wills, and so on; muda-\nraba (profit sharing on trading capital in place of interest);\nlaw of inheritance; organization of various cooperatives, and\nso on. Two other institutions that have been advocated by\nother scholars are microcredit or microfinance (Hassan &\nfact, Hassan and Alamgir (2002) argue that microcredit has\nbeen found to be an effective instrument for creating self-\nemployment, while Bakar (2002) argues that takaful could\nbecome an important element in the modern poverty-reduc-\ntion agenda by protecting people from shocks, both eco-\nnomic and natural.\nAnother approach to Islamic poverty alleviation adopted\nby Muslim scholars is what could be called economic\napproach, which is based mainly on the belief in economic\nimportance of economic growth in alleviating poverty, espe-\ncially in the pattern of growth that corrects the distribution of\nincome. In addition, population growth and demographic\nchanges are also suggested to be taken into consideration, so\nthat young people could be developed into a productive\nworkforce through human capital formation, job creation,\nfinance facilities, and secure environment.\n4 SAGE Open\nSirageldin (2002) proposes \"effective growth strategies\nwith a built-in equitable opportunity mechanism\" as the\nfoundation for sustainable poverty-reduction policies (p. 41).\nTo him, these strategies are in harmony with the Islamic ethi-\ncal system, in particular the axiomatic approach developed\nby Naqvi (1994) which is based on four basic tenets: Unity\n(Tawhid) which indicates the vertical dimension of the ethi-\ncal system; Equilibrium (al-`adl wa'l-ihsan) which provides\nfor the horizontal dimension of equity leaving a lot of free-\ndom for policy details; Free-will (ikhtiyar) in which careful\nintellection is required to interpret-reinterpret that freedom\nwithin specific social contexts, and to suit the needs of\nchanging times (p. 31); and Responsibility (fard) which\nstates that although \"responsibility\" is voluntary, individuals\nand society need to conserve for the public good Sirageldin\nfalling into the economic approach. Although he does not\ndirectly talk about the growth, his suggestions are full of eco-\nnomic formulation. He suggests a set of criteria for poverty\nelimination that is believed to be able to fulfill the basic\nneeds of the people. These criteria are firstly, low-cost; sec-\nondly, the state is not forced to indulge in heavy borrowing;\nand thirdly, it is consistent with (indeed built-in within) the\nsystem. The strategy emphasizes motivating all human\nresources to take up every possible opportunity to contribute\nto family income; subsistence and poor families should be\ngiven every encouragement for self-employed activity and\nimproved family enterprise. This strategy is believed to be in\nconsistent with the spirit of Islamic economy and that Islam\nprovides for institutions for the success of such a strategy.\nCritical Analysis of the Vision of\nPoverty and the \"Islamic\" Strategy for\nPoverty Alleviation\nContemplating on the above vision of poverty and the so-\ncalled Islamic strategies for poverty alleviation leads one to\nrealize that the vision and strategies are actually suffering of\nat least three deficiencies. They are first, the absence of the\nredefinition of the very poverty itself; second, the exogenous\ndomination of the vision on poverty and poverty alleviation\nstrategies; and third, the adoption of a top-down approach to\nvision of poverty and the strategies for poverty alleviation.\nThe deliberations of these deficiencies are as follows.\nThe Absence of a Redefinition of Poverty\nAs shown earlier, there are already literatures that attempt to\ndeliberate on the Islamic vision of poverty and on the Islamic\nstrategies for poverty alleviation. However, they are heavily\nconcentrated on two main things. First, in regard to the vision\nof poverty, all of them dislike poverty and suggest the elimi-\nnation of poverty as much as possible to avoid its negative\nconsequences. Second, in regard to the strategies for poverty\nalleviation, they concentrate heavily on either Islamic insti-\ntutions or on economic formulation. In both cases, poverty is\naccepted as is understood by conventional thinking, leaving\nalone the very base of the attempt, namely, the definition of\nthe poverty itself. They, for instance, elaborate on the use of\nzakat and awqaf,1 or on microfinance,2 or on takaful,3 or on\neconomic formulation,4 but all seem to be done with a view\nof overcoming the problem of the undefined conventional\npoverty, not an Islamically defined poverty.\nUndeniably, they are commended for at least providing\nthe bases for the endeavors in poverty alleviation.\nNevertheless, their vision and strategies are embedded with\nthe mere economic indicators and instruments such as\ngrowth, market, income, wealth, employment, capital, assets,\nrevenues, and profits, as if that poverty is void of spiritual\ndimension. To make them in tandem with Islam, they pro-\npose an injection of Islamic elements such as Unity (Tawhid),\nEquilibrium (al-`adl wa'l-ihsan), Free-will (ikhtiyar), and\nseems to mention briefly about the meaning of poverty, but\nstill it hardly could be considered as an Islamic definition. He\nstill uses \"the level of living\" and \"subsistence level\" as the\nindicators of poverty.5 His categories of the poor are based\non incomes, ability to buy goods, and services (purchasing\npower) to fulfill minimum basic needs for economically\ndecent living. In addition, he defines the poor (fuqara) as\nthose who lack the opportunities or abilities or both to earn\ntheir livelihoods, which may lead to suffer social humilia-\ntion, economic deprivation, and moral and spiritual vacuum\nabout the first two categories of zakat recipients--the poor\nand the needy--briefly mentions the difference in opinion of\nzakat scholars on the definition of the poor and the needy,\nbased on human needs in relation to wealth and income. The\nfirst group of scholars he says defines the poor as a person\nwho has less than his needs in terms of wealth and income\nwhereas the needy is that who owns nothing. The second\ngroup of scholars, however, considers that the poor is in a\nworse situation than the needy. The detailed discourse on\nthis, however, was not deliberated because to Kahf (2002, p.\n22), it is immaterial who is in a worse situation. What matters\nis that both cannot support their needs by their own means,\nhence the supplementary support for sustenance, in this case,\nthrough zakat.\nThe definition of poverty and the poor outlined by both\nliberate itself from the entanglement of tangible indicators\nused by conventional economics. Both basically ignore the\nspiritual dimension embedded within the poor-self, as is\nthough stressing on the insufficiency of the quantitative\nmoney-metric consumption (or income)\u00adbased approach in\nmeasuring the multidimensionality of the concept of poverty,\nhe could not come out of the tangible indicators. His sugges-\ntion to overcome the above problem is based on the expan-\nsionofneedsandmeasurementofsociopoliticalexternalities.6\nSuch a phenomenon too could be found in the work of Khan\n(n.d., p. 4). He sees poverty, supposedly from Islamic per-\nspective, as related to two concepts, that is, the concept of\nnecessities (dharuriyyah) and the concept of exemption limit\n(nisab). Necessities here refer to all activities and things that\nare essential to preserve the five fundamentals of human life,\nthat is, religion, physical self, intellect or knowledge, off-\nspring, and wealth (that is the maqasid al-shari'ah, though\nhe does not use the term so). One is considered poor if he\ndoes not possess sufficient necessities to fulfill his basic\nneeds based on the above five foundations for good individ-\nual and social life. Nisab refers to a certain minimum quan-\ntum of any good or wealth that must be possessed before that\ngood and wealth is subject to zakat. In zakat, the nisab\nrequirement implies that those who do not meet the nisab\nrequirement are not only excused from paying zakat but also\nconsidered poor and hence eligible to receive zakat. Even a\nsupposedly Islamic-oriented writing such as of Patel (1983,\np. 4) defines poverty in a material-oriented sense. He says,\n\"Poverty, in its pure meaning is the insufficiency and the lack\nof the material means to live a tolerable and meaningful\nexistence.\"\nIf there could be considered a little bit of Islamic elements\nin the definition of poverty, they are perhaps the definitions\nBoth consider poverty as a test of man's allegiance to his\nCreator and a great fear. The Quranic verse which is related\nto this argument, inter alia, is as follows: \"We will surely test\nyou with a measure of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth,\nlives, and fruits; and give good news to the patient\" (al-\nBesides that, he also agrees with Chapra (1980) who says\nthat Islam is a religion of balance and therefore has given\nequal emphasis on both the spiritual and worldly affairs.\nAhmed (2004) is well aware of the integration of the material\nand spiritual dimensions of poverty. He argues that the con-\ncept of richness/poverty in Islam does represent not only\ndeprivation of goods and services but also lack of richness/\npoverty in spirit.\nUnfortunately, however, Ahmed (2004) has purposely left\nout this broader comprehensive concept of poverty, to only\nfocus on the notion of deprivation in the economic sense. He\ndoes so with the belief that the economic concept of poverty\nand its eradication indirectly addresses the spiritual aspects.\nLike what has been asserted by Rahman (1974), Ahmed\n(2004, p. 20) believes that the individuals can improve their\nspiritual lives by improving their material life. Ahmed (2004,\np. 55) too, in spite of his consciousness that the concept of\npoverty has evolved from deprivation of material needs, edu-\ncation, and health to more broader ideas of vulnerability,\nexposure to risk, voicelessness, and powerlessness still\nfocuses his discussion on the former economic notion. Such\na similar treatment of the definition of poverty also has been\n"
