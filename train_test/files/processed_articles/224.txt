The physician deemed 49% of these requests clinically inappropriate. Physicians\nfilled 69% of requests they deemed clinically inappropriate; 39% of physicians perceived DTCA as dam-\naging to the time efficiency of the visit, and 13% saw it as helpful. Thirty-three percent of physicians\nthought discussing DTCA had improved the doctor-patient relationship; 8% felt it had worsened it. The\neffect on the relationship was strongly associated with doing what the patient wanted.\nConclusions: DTCA can have good and bad effects on quality of care, the doctor-patient relationship,\nand health service utilization. The benefits might be maximized, and the harms minimized, by increas-\ning the accuracy of information in advertisements; enhancing physicians' communication and negotia-\ntion skills; and encouraging patients to respect physicians' clinical expertise. (J Am Board Fam Pract\nCompared with other sources of health informa-\ntion for the public, direct-to-consumer advertising\nof prescription medications (DTCA) is pervasive,\npersuasive, and passive. Patients are exposed to\nDTCA without actively seeking it. Unlike much\npublic interest advertising,1 it uses effective tech-\nniques, including a strong emotional appeal to tar-\ngeted audiences.2 The pharmaceutical industry\nspends more than $2 billion annually with the goal\nof promoting consumer desire for products and\nhence increasing market share.3\nIts advantages and disadvantages are controver-\nsial.3,4 Proponents contend that DTCA provides\nvaluable health information5 that helps patients\nvoice health concerns to their physician and in-\ncreases patients' sense of confidence and control\nduring visits.6 Both these effects could improve the\ndoctor-patient relationship. DTCA may also raise\nawareness of underdiagnosed, treatable conditions\nsuch as hyperlipidemia or depression, leading to\nphysician visits for prevention and treatment that\nwould not otherwise occur.7 Opponents argue that\nDTCA contributes to rising drug costs,8 encour-\nages inappropriate prescribing,9\u00ad11 and may in-\ncrease overall health care costs needlessly by lead-\ning to requests for tests or referrals that are not\nclinically indicated. Evidence for these conflicting\nclaims is scanty. Available data are limited by small\nsamples or restricted populations.9,12 This is the\nfirst population based survey of physicians, and the\nFrom the Department of Primary Care and Population\nSciences, Royal Free and University College School of Med-\nicine at University College London, United Kingdom (EM),\nDepartment of Medicine and Program in Medical Ethics\n(BL) and Health Survey Research Unit, Center for AIDS\nPrevention Studies (LP, KL), University of California, San\nFrancisco, and Department of Health Policy and Manage-\nment, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachu-\nsetts (KD).

EM was a Harkness Fellow in Health Care\nDirect-to-Consumer Advertising 513\nfirst to look at physician views on the impact of\nDTCA on the doctor-patient relationship and the\nquality of care. Moreover, it is unknown whether\nthe effects of DTCA vary according to socioeco-\nnomic or health status, which is important in view\nof the widespread concern about health disparities.\nWe used data from 2 nationally representative\nsurveys of US physicians and the US public on\nDTCA to examine these claims, and to determine\nthe extent to which the effects of DTCA vary with\nsocio-economic and health status. This article uses\ndata from the physician survey to address the ef-\nfects of DTCA on quality of care, health outcomes,\nhealth service utilization, and physicians' percep-\ntions of its effect on the doctor-patient relation-\nship. Our forthcoming article uses the public data\nset to analyze issues pertaining to the individual and\nto population health.\nMethods\nDevelopment of Testable Hypotheses\nOur first step was to collate published claims and\nderive hypotheses that could be tested in at least 1\nof our 2 data sets (Figure 1). Not all the claimed\nbenefits or harms of DTCA were amenable to ex-\namination with the available data (e.g., \"DTCA\ncontributes to a cultural expectation of a `pill for\nSample\nTwo thousand physicians were randomly selected\nfrom the national list of physicians provided by\nthe Medical Marketing Service, Inc. (MMS). The\nMMS list is based on the national database of the\nAmerican Medical Association (AMA), which con-\ncomplete list of physicians available in the US.\nPhysicians who currently spent more than 20 hours\na week on direct patient care were included in the\nsurvey. The sample was stratified by specialty: pri-\nmary care, medical specialty, or surgical specialty.\nPrimary care included Family Practice, General\nPractice, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics. Ob-\nGyn was classified as a surgical specialty.\nQuestionnaire\nThe questionnaire was developed after literature\nreview and focus group discussions and was pre-\ntested. It consisted of 3 sections of closed-ended\nquestions and took approximately 12 minutes to\ncomplete. The entire sample received Part 1 of the\nquestionnaire, which elicited general information\nabout views on health information on the Internet\nand DTCA. Questions examined general views on\naccuracy and effects of such information, and per-\nsonal use of the Internet at work. Part 2 was sent to\na random 50% of the sample. It asked whether any\npatient had discussed information derived from\nDTCA in the past 12 months and, if so, specific\ninquiries were made about the last time this hap-\npened. \"Last time\" methodology was used to min-\nimize recall bias. Areas explored were the relevance\nand accuracy of the information, physicians' per-\nceptions of why the patient had brought the infor-\nmation, physicians' responses to the patient, and\ntheir views about the impact on health care, health\noutcomes, and the doctor-patient relationship. The\nother 50% of the sample received a different Part 2,\nwhich asked about respondents' experiences with\nInternet information. Part 3 was received by the\nentire sample and obtained demographic and work-\nload information: hours per week spent on face-to-\nface consultations, other tasks related to patient\ncare, and administrative tasks; numbers of patients\nseen per week; practice income; proportions of pa-\ntients on Medicaid, from minority groups, having\nand with no health insurance; geographic setting of\npractice; age and racial origin of respondent. This\nwas supplemented with information from the\nMMS database, including specialty, year of gradu-\nation from medical school, geographic region\n(East, South, Midwest, West), whether hospital or\noffice-based, and whether trained in the United\nStates or overseas.\nResponse Rate\nData collection was undertaken between Novem-\nwas mailed to the selected physicians with a check\nfor $35 as a token of appreciation for completing\nthe questionnaire. Up to 3 reminders were sent and\nadditional telephone contact made with non-\nresponders. Of the original 2000 physicians sent\nthe survey, 38 were ineligible because they were\ndeceased, retired, or no longer in practice; 1050\nphysicians completed the questionnaire (response\nsion of the questionnaire and 515 the Internet ver-\nsion (Figure 2).\nAnalysis\nWeighting\nData were weighted to represent the national pop-\nulation of physicians on the MMS database who\nspend 20 or more hours per week on direct patient\ncare using the MMS variables mentioned above.\nOutcome Variables\nThe effect of DTCA on the doctor-patient rela-\ntionship was tested using physician perceptions of\nthe relationship and whether the doctor had felt\nthat the patient was challenging his or her authority\nduring the discussion. Outcomes pertaining to the\nFigure 1.

Each analysis\nwent through several iterations, with each new it-\neration using successively more stringent statistical\ncriteria for inclusion in the model.

The goal was to\nidentify the most parsimonious model while still\nachieving adequate fit, which was operationalized\nas P  .20 on the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-\nof-fit test.\nBecause all data were weighted (except where\nspecified), the appropriate procedures to correct\np-values and standard errors were undertaken.

Despite\nthis, most doctors agreed that DTCA gives patients\nconfidence to talk to their doctors about health\nconcerns and encourages patients to follow the\ndoctor's instructions or advice (Table 2). No de-\nmographic, practice, or workload variables were\nassociated with respondents overall opinion about\nAccuracy and Relevance of DTCA\nthought that advertisements were very accurate,\nsomewhat accurate, and the remainder thought\nthey were not very or not at all accurate.

On univariate analysis,\nan improved relationship was associated with phy-\nsicians' perceptions that the information in the ad-\nvertisement was relevant and accurate, the patient\nseeking only the doctor's opinion rather than a\nspecific intervention, and the doctor's responses\nduring the discussion (Table 3). Specifically, the\ndoctor doing what the patient wanted, feeling that\nthe patient was taking responsibility for his or her\nhealth, and perceiving the request as clinically in-\ndicated were all associated with an improved\nrelationship. Conversely, inaccurate, irrelevant in-\nformation was associated with a deterioration in the\nrelationship, as was the doctor feeling that the pa-\ntient was challenging his or her authority, not hav-\ning enough time to discuss the request, and not\ndoing what the patient wanted. Practice character-\nistics were not associated with a positive or negative\nTable 3.

On mul-\ntivariate analysis, the most important factor inde-\npendently associated with an improved doctor-\npatient relationship was the doctor doing what the\npatient wanted (Table 3).\nDoctors Who Feel Challenged\nthat their authority was being challenged by the\npatient during the discussion about DTCA (Table\n4). On univariate analysis, doctors were more likely\nto feel challenged if the patient wanted a specific\nintervention, if the intervention was not clinically\nindicated, if the doctor did not do what the patient\nwanted, or if the doctor did not know the patient\nwell enough to have good communication (Table\n4).

In\n75 of these cases (19% of all visits in which DTCA\nwas discussed; 69% of inappropriate requests), the\ndoctor did what the patient wanted, either com-\npletely (n  5) or partially (n  70). In 33 cases, the\ndoctor did not do what the patient wanted at all.\nEffect on Time-Efficiency\nMore physicians viewed discussing information\nfrom a drug advertisement as worsening the time\nunivariate analysis, factors associated with wors-\nened time efficiency included inaccurate or irrele-\nvant advertisements, patients wanting a specific in-\ntervention, and the doctor's response. Not doing\nwhat the patient wanted was strongly associated\nwith worsened time efficiency, as was thinking that\nthe request was not appropriate or that the patient\nwas challenging the doctor's authority (Table 5).\nOn multivariate analysis, inaccurate ads, specific\nrequests, inappropriate requests, and the doctor's\nfeeling challenged were independently associated\nwith worsened time efficiency (Table 5).\nEffect on Quality of Care\nWe further analyzed the 75 cases in which the\npatient had made a request that was deemed inap-\npropriate by the physician (Figure 3). In the 5 cases\nin which the physician did what the patient wanted\ncompletely, the impact of this on quality of care was\nviewed as neutral. In the 69 cases in which the\ndoctor had done partially what the patient re-\nquested, the effect on quality of care was viewed as\nWhen the patient's request was deemed appro-\npriate by the doctor, the effect of doing what the\npatient wanted, either completely or partially, was\nviewed as positive or neutral in all cases. The find-\nings were similar for effect on ultimate health out-\ncomes (data not shown).\nOn multivariate analysis, several factors were\nindependently associated with the patient making a\nrequest for an intervention that the doctor deemed\ninappropriate: the physician regarding the adver-\ntisement as not very or not at all accurate [odds\nregarding patients as poor (rather than fair to ex-\ncellent) at assessing the relevance of a drug ad (OR\nthat he or she did not know the patient well enough\nDiscussion\nWe found that DTCA has complex effects on qual-\nity of care and health service utilization. DTCA\nresults in patients making almost as many inappro-\npriate requests as appropriate ones. This puts phy-\nsicians in a quandary, facing 3 conflicting ethical\nobligations. First, physicians aim to \"do no harm.\"\nSecond, physicians seek to maintain and develop\na strong doctor-patient relationship because it\nenhances future care and health outcomes. In\naddition, patient satisfaction is now used as a\nbenchmark for quality of care and, as such, may\ndetermine physician income. Third, physicians\nhave a duty to ensure fair allocation of health care\nresources and avoid wasteful expenditure. In the\nUnited States, such stewardship of societal re-\nsources is regarded as a weaker obligation than\npromoting the well-being of the individual pa-\ntient.16\u00ad18 We found that physicians find respond-\ning to inappropriate requests time-consuming and\nthat they often seem to acquiesce to such requests\nas long as the patient is not harmed. Thus, physi-\ncians attempt to mitigate negative effects of DTCA\nbut at the cost of physician time or health care\ndollars. Furthermore, more doctors perceive the\neffect on the relationship as beneficial than harm-\nful, but this is dependent on physicians doing what\nthe patient wants, a finding confirmed in our forth-\ncoming article presenting patients' views.\nDirect-to-Consumer Advertising 521\nOur findings have several implications for max-\nimizing the benefits of DTCA while minimizing\nthe harms. Inaccurate DTCA increases costs with-\nout improving health outcomes. Increased regula-\ntion of DTCA may ensure that information in\nadvertisements is accurate and includes possible\nharms of treatment, as well as nonpharmacological\nalternatives.\nFigure 3. Outcomes when patients brought information from DTCA to a visit (n  395).\nIn addition, patients need stronger skills in crit-\nically appraising drug advertisements to determine\nwhether the material is personally relevant and ac-\ncurate. Patients should seek the physician's opinion\non the relevance and accuracy of information in\nDTCA. This would both strengthen the doctor-\npatient relationship and avoid clinically inappropri-\nate interventions. Just as physicians need to ac-\nknowledge that patients are expert in knowing their\nown health utilities, patients need to recognize\nphysician clinical judgment.\nFinally, physicians need to learn how to negoti-\nate inappropriate requests efficiently without jeop-\nardizing the doctor-patient relationship or feeling\nTable 5: Effect of DTCA on the Time-Efficiency of the Visit\nN\n%\nHelped\n%\nNeutral\n%\nHurt\nUnivariate\np\nMultivariate\nOdds Ratio\nPhysicians' background views on DTCA\nHow good are patients at assessing the relevance\nof ads?\nPhysicians' cognitive and emotional responses in the last visit where a patient talked about DTCA\nHow relevant to the patient was the information\nin the ad?\nHow accurate was the information in the ad? 0.001\nWhy did the patient talk to you about the ad? 0.001\nDid you do what the patient wanted? 0.001\nDid you have enough time to discuss the\ninformation?\nDid you feel the patient was taking\nresponsibility?\nDid you feel the patient was challenging your\nauthority?\nDid you think that the patient's request was not\nappropriate for their health?\nCI, confidence interval.\nDirect-to-Consumer Advertising 523\nthat patients are challenging their authority. En-\nhanced communication skills may enable doctors to\nfollow their professional judgment, without dam-\naging the doctor-patient relationship.19\nMethodological Issues\nSeveral methodological issues limit the generaliz-\nability of our findings. First, this article reports on\na secondary analysis of an extant data set, so not all\nhypotheses could be evaluated with the desired\nprecision. Second, we have no objective measures\nof the appropriateness of patient requests; however,\nbecause this is a professional judgment of the type\nclinicians make daily, respondents' opinions have a\ndegree of face validity. Finally, the response rate is\nmoderate at 53%, despite every effort to maximize\nit. However, comparison of unweighted with\nweighted data suggests that the sample obtained\nwas representative of US physicians, and sampling\nweights were applied to adjust for survey nonre-\nsponse.\nConclusions\nDTCA can have both good and bad effects on the\ndoctor-patient relationship and health service uti-\nlization. The benefits can be maximized and the\nharms minimized by increasing the accuracy and\nrelevance of the information in the advertisements,\nenhancing physicians' communication and negoti-\nation skills, and encouraging patients to respect\nphysicians' clinical expertise.\nWe are grateful to Kinga Zapert and Rachel Turner of Harris\nInteractive Inc. for developing and fielding the survey instru-\nment and to Joseph Catania, PhD, director of the Health Survey\nResearch Unit, for advice on the analytical strategy.\nReferences\n1.
