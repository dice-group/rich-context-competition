Initial findings, when the\nchildren were ages 2 to 4 months, dem-\nonstrated enhanced receipt of devel-\nopmental services, increased satisfac-\ntion with care, and enhanced parent\npractices related to sleep position, feed-\ning, and infant development.14 In this\narticle, we report whether Healthy Steps\nincreased quality of care related to de-\nvelopmental and behavioral services\nand affected parenting practices regard-\ning discipline, perceptions of their chil-\ndren's behavior, and promotion of de-\nvelopment when children were ages 30\nMETHODS\nThe Healthy Steps for Young Children\nProgram was a 3-year, prospective con-\ntrolled trial with 6 randomization and\n9 quasi-experimental pediatric prac-\ntice sites selected by program funders\nand located in 14 states across the\nUnited States (randomization sites: Al-\nlentown, Pa; Amarillo, Tex; Florence,\nSC; Iowa City, Iowa; Pittsburgh, Pa; and\nSan Diego, Calif. Quasi-experimental\nsites: Boston, Mass; Chapel Hill, NC/\nBirmingham, Ala; Chicago, Ill; De-\ntroit, Mich; Grand Junction, Colo/\nMontrose, Colo; Kansas City, Kan;\nKansas City, Mo; New York, NY; and\nRichmond, Tex/Houston, Tex).\nEligibility/Inclusion Criteria\nConsecutive newborns up to 4 weeks\nof age were enrolled at birth or their first\noffice visit and followed up to age 3\nyears. Newborns were excluded if they\nwere to be adopted or placed in foster\ncare, were too ill to make an office visit\nby age 4 weeks, their mother did not\nspeak English or Spanish, or the fam-\nily intended to leave the practice within\n6 months. Enrollment of families was\nWithin each randomization site, new-\nborns were randomized to interven-\ntion or control groups of approxi-\nmately200newbornseach.Trainedstaff\ncarried out randomization in blocks of\n4, using a computer-generated assign-\nment sequence concealed in sealed en-\nvelopes. Constraints on sample size (ie,\nneed to enroll 400 children total), space\nlimitations, scheduling logistics, and the\nunwillingness of some practices to pro-\nvide different services to families pre-\nvented randomization at all sites. At\nquasi-experimentalsites,upto200new-\nborns were consecutively enrolled at the\nintervention sites and at a comparison\nsite matched on organizational setting\n(practice type and urban/rural loca-\ntion) and demographic mix of pa-\nA simulation study was conducted to\nevaluate the power of our design to de-\ntect treatment effects for dichotomous\noutcomes. Our simulation allowed for\nclustering of outcomes within sites and\nfor a 33% missing outcome rate. For\nrandomization sites for a dichoto-\nmous outcome and control-group\nfound greater than 90% power to de-\ntect a treatment effect odds ratio (OR)\nof 1.5. For control group prevalences\nof 0.1 and 0.9, the associated power was\nroughly 70%. For the quasi-experimen-\ntal design, the power was substan-\ntially larger.\nIntervention Protocol\nRegardless of assignment, families re-\nceived all aspects of standard pediat-\nric care within the practice. Clinicians\nat the randomization sites cared for both\nintervention and control families. In-\ntervention families also received the\nHealthy Steps program components, in-\ncluding contact with the Healthy Steps\nSpecialist. Each site had 2 Healthy Steps\nSpecialists with caseloads of approxi-\nmately 100 families each. The Healthy\nSteps Specialists were nurses, nurse\npractitioners, early childhood educa-\ntors, and social workers with training\nand experience in child development.\nThe specialists' main focus was on de-\nvelopmental, behavioral, and psycho-\nsocial aspects of care.\nHealthy Steps provided 7 services to\nintervention families: enhanced well-\nchild care (through visits with the phy-\nsician and Healthy Steps Specialist); 6\nhome visits in the first 3 years; Healthy\nSteps Specialist\u00adstaffed child develop-\nmental telephone line to address par-\nents' developmental concerns; develop-\nmental assessments; written materials\nemphasizing prevention and health pro-\nmotion; parent groups offering support\nand learning opportunities; and link-\nages to community resources through\ntargeted referrals. In enhanced well-\nchild visits, parents' questions and con-\ncerns about child development and be-\nhavior were addressed, using \"teachable\nmoments\" and promotion of positive\nparent-child interactions. These visits\nalsoemphasizedthemother'shealthand\nencouraged early learning through the\nTraining and Implementation\nKey site personnel participated in 3 an-\nnual training sessions, stressing knowl-\nedge in child development, parenting,\nand practical clinical strategies; empha-\nsizing the importance of relationships;\npromotingmultidisciplinaryteambuild-\ning; and helping practices implement\nHealthy Steps.16 Each site also received\nprogram and training manuals and tech-\nnical assistance through biweekly\nteleconferences.Sitesalsoreceivedtrain-\ning in evaluation procedures. Imple-\nmentation of written protocols was\nmonitored by the Healthy Steps na-\ntional program office. Significant\nchanges were required in practice op-\nerations related to space, appointment\nscheduling (for joint Healthy Steps Spe-\ncialist/physician visits), job responsi-\nbilities, and team meetings. Some sites\nexperienced changes in practice own-\nership,administration,andstaffing,forc-\ning 1 site to close before completing the\nstudy. Despite these challenges, all sites\nmade all components available from the\nstart of the program.\nThe study was approved by the hu-\nman subjects committees at the Johns\nHopkins Bloomberg School of Public\nHealth and all participating institu-\ntions. Families gave written informed\nconsent at the time of enrollment and\noral consent at each subsequent par-\nent interview.\nTracking\nlies provided data for the evaluation, re-\ngardless of their continued use of care\nat the original Healthy Steps practice.\nAttempts to minimize study attrition in-\ncluded mailing of annual birthday cards\nmarked \"return service requested\" to\ninform evaluators of address changes,\nannual queries of the National Change\nof Address service to update contact in-\nformation, and newsletters marked \"re-\nturn service requested.\"\nData Sources\nComputer-assisted telephone inter-\nviews in English or Spanish were con-\nCenters for Public Health Research and\nEvaluation. The mother was the pri-\nmary respondent (98.5%). If she was\nnot available, the child's guardian or pri-\nmary caretaker was interviewed. Re-\nspondents were asked about use of\nhealth-related services, satisfaction with\ncare, perceptions of their children's be-\nhavior, parenting activities that pro-\nmote development and safety, and the\nmother's health status and problems\nwith depressive symptoms. Data on\ndemographic characteristics came from\nenrollment forms and parent tele-\nphone interviews at 2 to 4 months.\nData about well-child visits and vac-\ncinationswereabstractedbytrainedstaff\nfrom medical records when the child\nreached age 32 months, including type\nand date of visit and each vaccine re-\nceived. A random sample of 5% of re-\ncords was reabstracted at each site. Per-\ncentage agreement was 87% or higher\nforvisittype,96%orhigherforvisitdate,\nor higher for vaccine date.\nQuality-of-Care Outcomes\nFour domains of quality of care--\neffectiveness, patient-centeredness,\ntimeliness, and efficiency--were op-\nerationalized using the Institute of\nMedicine framework (eBOX, available\nonline at: http://www.jama.com).17,18 Ef-\nfectiveness included receipt of Healthy\nSteps\u00adrelated services, and patient-\ncenteredness described satisfaction and\nexperiences while seeking care. We cre-\nated subscales to measure parents' per-\nception of the care their family re-\nceived from their child's health care\nproviders. Internal consistency of the\nscales, as assessed by Cronbach , ex-\nceeded .70 for all scales, the generally\naccepted level for an internally consis-\ntent scale.\nTimeliness encompassed adherence to\nthe recommended schedule of well-\nchild care visits9 and vaccinations.19\nWell-child visits and vaccinations that\noccurred within the recommended pe-\nriod were considered age-appropriate.\nChildren who received 4 doses of diph-\ntheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, 3 doses\nof polio vaccine, and 1 dose of measles-\nmumps-rubella vaccine by age 2 years\nwere considered up-to-date. Doses re-\nceived before the minimum interval be-\ntween doses were not counted.\nEfficiency, ie, the avoidance of wasted\nresources, included emergency depart-\nment (ED) use and hospitalizations be-\ncause their costs per unit of service are\nhigh and inappropriate use of re-\nsources contributes to many of these\nvisits.20 Continued receipt of care at the\nsame practice after age 20 months also\nwas included since continuity of care\nreduces the risk of hospitalizations and\nED use21 and increases consumer sat-\nParenting Outcomes\nParenting outcomes included re-\nsponses to child misbehavior, reports of\nchild behaviors, and selected age-\nappropriateparentingpracticesthatpro-\nmote child health and development\n(eBox).\"ParentalResponsetoChildMis-\nbehavior\" assessed the frequency with\nwhich parents used each of 12 re-\nsponses to misbehavior in an average\nweek in the past month.23 The usual\n7-point scale was condensed to 4 re-\nsponse categories ranging from 0\n(\"never\") to 3 (\"almost always\") to fa-\ncilitate telephone administration. Re-\nsponses were dichotomized to indicate\nwhether individual approaches to disci-\npline were used \"never\" or \"seldom\" vs\n\"often\" or \"almost always.\" A con-\nstructed scale included more harsh re-\nsponsestomisbehavior(eg,yellinginan-\nger, threatening, slapping the child's\nhand, and spanking with a hand). The\nrespondent'stotalscorewassummedand\ndivided by the number of items and was\ninterpreted in relation to the response\ncategories for the item. One dichoto-\nmous variable indicated \"harsh disci-\npline\"withameanscoreof1.5orhigher.\nA second dichotomous variable indi-\ncatedwhethertheparenteverslappedthe\nchild in the face or spanked him or her\nwith an object. Two nonphysical strat-\negies (often or almost always negotiat-\ning and ignoring the misbehavior) were\nassessed.\nThe Child Behavior Checklist\n(CBCL) for children aged 2 to 3 years\nmeasured parents' perceptions of their\nchildren's behavioral problems.24 Means\nof 3 CBCL subscales (aggressive behav-\nior, anxious or depressed, sleep prob-\nlems) were reported. Parents rated their\nchild for how true (\"often,\" \"some-\ntimes,\" \"never\") each item was at the\ntime of the interview or within the pre-\nvious 6 months.\nParenting practices included read-\ning to the child or showing the child\npicture books, playing with the child,\nand following daily routines at nap-\ntime, mealtime, and bedtime. We also\nassessed parents' practices recom-\nmended by the American Academy of\nPediatrics to promote child safety.8\nA 14-item, abbreviated Center for\nEpidemiologicStudies\u00adDepressionscale\nwas used to assess mothers' depres-\nsive symptoms.25 It included the same\nresponse categories as the original 20-\nitem scale. Scores of 11 or greater in-\ndicated the presence of maternal de-\npressive symptoms. The  coefficient\nfor the 14-item depression scale in the\nHealthy Steps sample was .86, similar\nto that for the total scale in general\npopulation samples.25 Discussing sad-\nness with someone at the practice was\nidentified as a parenting practice that\npromoted child development among\nthose respondents with depressive\nwho needed help with sadness since the\nchild was born, or those for whom ac-\ntivities were restricted for 1 week or\nlonger in the previous 6 months be-\ncause of feeling anxious or depressed.\nAnalysis\nFamilies remained in their original\ngroup assignment regardless of the site\nof care or intensity of services re-\nceived. Randomization and quasi-\nexperimental sites were analyzed sepa-\nrately and combined. In bivariate\nanalyses, we compared the distribu-\ntion of quality-of-care outcomes and\nparenting practices using 2 statistics\nfor categorical variables and t statis-\ntics for continuous variables (eg, CBCL\nscores).\nGeneralized regression models (lo-\ngistic regression for dichotomous out-\ncomes, linear regression for continu-\nousoutcomes)wereusedtoestimatethe\noverall adjusted effects of Healthy\nvariables to account for the fact that\nfamilies within sites tend to respond\nmore similarly than those at different\nsites.

These im-\nprovements included marked parental\nsatisfaction with the program; more\ntimely preventive care, including on-\ntime immunizations; and the receipt of\nmore developmentally-oriented ser-\nvices. We observed similar increases at\nfamilies reported increased use of fa-\nvorable discipline techniques. Al-\nthough the use of negative discipline\nstrategies was low, we believe that re-\nductions in yelling in anger, threaten-\ning, slapping in the face, and spanking\nwith an object are meaningful given the\nassociations of early discipline strate-\ngies with later socioemotional devel-\nopment, mental health, and parent-\nchild relationships.30 These treatment\neffects were observed in families who\nparticipated in a universal interven-\ntion broadly focused on development\nand behavior. Prior evaluations of early\nchildhood interventions with home\nvisits have focused on high-risk popu-\nlations.\nThe program also appears to have af-\nfected mothers' perceptions of their\nchildren's behaviors. Intervention\nmothers were more likely to report ag-\ngressive behaviors and sleep prob-\nlems. They also were more likely to talk\nto someone at the practice about their\nown depressive symptoms. We sus-\npect that participating mothers be-\ncame more sensitive in reading their\nchild's behavior and more comfort-\nable discussing their child's behavior\nand their own sadness with someone\nat the practice. Full implementation of\nHealthy Steps at each of the sites likely\ncontributed to the positive findings.31\nAlthough Healthy Steps was not con-\nceived as a \"quality improvement\" in-\ntervention, our findings indicate that\nHealthy Steps made its impact through\nimprovements in quality of care and se-\nlected effects on parenting practices.\nRelative to other early childhood in-\nterventions, however, the program was\nmodest in intensity. For example, Early\nHead Start provides daily contact with\nlow-income families through center-\nbased programs or weekly contact\nthrough home-based programs.32 The\nInfant Health and Development Pro-\ngram provided an average of 67 home\nvisits in children's first 3 years of life.33\nIn contrast, the average Healthy Steps\nfamily made 11 well-child visits and re-\nceived less than 2 home visits within\ntheir child's first 2.5 years. Correspond-\ning costs for the Healthy Steps pro-\nstantially less than those for Head Start\nContrary to expectations and de-\nspite increased receipt of timely pre-\nventive services, Healthy Steps did not\ninfluence hospitalizations or overall ED\nuse. Reducing receipt of these acute ser-\nvices may require further systems and\npractice-level changes (eg, making pri-\nmary care available during weekends\nand evenings). In addition, use of these\nTable 5.

The randomiza-\ntion design reduces bias in the selec-\ntion of families in the program, but has\nthe weakness of possible spillover ef-\nfects. The quasi-experimental design re-\nduces spillover effects and makes it\neasier to implement the program, but\ndoes not eliminate the possibility of se-\ntively defined controls at quasi-\nexperimental sites likely contributed to\nminimized discrepancies in outcomes\nbetween randomization and quasi-\nexperimental groups.37 For several\nparenting outcomes, such as disci-\npline practices, findings were of simi-\nlar magnitude and direction at random-\nization and quasi-experimental sites,\nbut statistically significant at only quasi-\nexperimental sites, where the sample\nsize was larger; they were significant in\nthe pooled sample, as well.\nA number of limitations should be\nnoted. The site selection process meant\nthat Healthy Steps was evaluated against\na high standard of performance among\npractices already oriented toward pro-\nviding developmental and behavioral\nservices. Many evaluation sites al-\nready provided one or more program\ncomponents. During the evaluation,\nsome comparison practices adopted na-\ntional programs, such as Reach Out and\nRead,38 that were components of\nHealthy Steps from its inception.\nOverall high levels among interven-\ntion and comparison families of base-\nline practices to promote toddler de-\nvelopment and safety likely contributed\nto lack of treatment effects in relation\nto injury prevention and parents' prac-\ntices to promote development. Par-\nents' engagement in these activities was\nhigher than that reported in the Na-\ntional Survey of Early Childhood Health\n(NSECH)6 and the Commonwealth\nFund Survey of Parents with Young\nChildren (CWF).4 For example, more\nHealthy Steps parents read to their chil-\ndren daily or showed their children pic-\nture books (Healthy Steps, 68%;\nsame bedtime (Healthy Steps, 77%;\nNSECH, 68%). Similar percentages of\nparents played with their child daily\ncovered electrical outlets (Healthy\nour findings at 2 to 4 months showing\nenhanced feeding practices, decreases\nin use of the prone sleep position, in-\ncreased daily use of picture books, and\nmonths, however, we similarly ob-\nserved no treatment effect with regard\nto infant routines.\nParents who completed the inter-\ncially advantaged than the total en-\nrolled population.

Findings also\nmay be underestimates because re-\nsponding families may have reported in-\ncreased use of favorable parenting be-\nhaviors at baseline. Finally, baseline\ndifferences between quasi-experimen-\ntal intervention and control families are\na limitation to the extent that covari-\nates did not account for these differ-\nences. We nonetheless believe that we\nadequately captured baseline differ-\nences. Moreover, the consistent find-\nings for randomization and quasi-\nexperimental sites appear to support\nthis conclusion.\nGiven nonresponse, generalizabil-\nity of our findings to the original co-\nhort is possible to the extent that (1)\nwithin levels of baseline covariates,\ntreatment assignment is independent of\nthe outcome; (2) within levels of base-\nline covariates, missingness of an out-\ncome is independent of the outcome;\nand (3) our regression models are cor-\nrectly specified.39 While the first and\nsecond assumptions cannot be empiri-\ncally validated, we did not have differ-\nential attrition of families, and we be-\nlieve that we have included a set of\ncovariates to increase the plausibility of\nthese assumptions.\nPediatricpracticesprovideuniqueop-\nportunities to favorably influence health\ncare for young children, increase par-\nents' satisfaction, and influence paren-\ntal practices to improve child develop-\nment and behavior.
