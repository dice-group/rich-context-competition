The engagement\nby youths in agitation for the restoration of their rights and\ndignity or self-seeking and criminal activities, that can be\neither constructive (positive) or destructive (negative), is\nundoubtedly a hydra-headed socio-economic problem in\nNigeria's Niger Delta. The root cause of the youth restive-\nness in the region is the broad spectrum of laws that have\nboth colonial inspiration and feudal inclination and the\naccompanying actions of the Nigerian state on the country's\noil industry and the age-long regime of environmental degra-\ndation due to the mindless operational threats arising from\nthe oil exploration and production activities of the oil con-\nglomerates. The legal/environmental laws that provided the\nconstitutional foundation did not only create the environ-\nment which is up till today plaguing the Niger Delta region\nbut also set the stage for the operational menace in which the\nregion has been engulfed. A deeper insight into the nature of\nthe collaboration by the three partners in the unholy alliance\ncan largely be provided, taking cognizance of the fact that\nthe Nigerian state (pre- and post-colonial) formulates the\npolicies that create and determine the political and business\nenvironment that are clement for the capitalist development\nof the oil industry and the exploitation and underdevelop-\nment of the Niger Delta region. In the face of the far from\nlegal/environmentally benign laws and the devastating oper-\national activities of the oil majors and minors, the cosmetic\ninstitutional interventionist efforts of the Nigerian state sup-\nposedly meant to close the developmental gaps in the para-\ndoxically rich-oil treasure-based, but poverty-ridden and\nunderdeveloped, region failed to achieve any tangible results.\nThe patently stark environmental injustice that has been the\nlot of the Niger Delta region has provided a fertile ground for\nthe deep-seated youth restiveness that had assumed frighten-\ning militant and anti-developmental dimensions. This study\ntherefore critically examines the youth restiveness problem-\natic in Nigeria's Niger Delta.\nEnvironment and Youth Restiveness:\nConceptual Explanation\nEnvironment literally connotes the surrounding. It is the total\nplanetary inheritance and the totality of all resources\n1Delta State University, Abraka, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nKelly Bryan Ovie Ejumudo, Department of Political Science, Delta State\nEmail: drkellypaulovieejumudo@yahoo.com\nYouth Restiveness in the Niger Delta:\nA Critical Discourse\nKelly Bryan Ovie Ejumudo1\n Keywords\nyouth restiveness, Niger Delta, holistic developmental approach\n2 SAGE Open\n(Karpagam, 2009). Environment is the aggregate of all those\nthings and set of conditions that directly or indirectly influ-\nence not only the life of organisms but also the communities\nat a particular place (Narayanan, 2007). Environment also\nincludes all the factors prevailing internally and externally or\naround and in the plants and animals (Treshow, 1970, cited in\nNarayanan, 2007). Environment, in fact, includes natural\nresources, both biotic and abiotic, covering not only the natu-\nral environment but also the man-made landscapes, build-\nings, and objects that form part of man's natural heritages\n(Thornton & Beckwith, 2007). An environment represents\nthe surrounding conditions and influences on the whole com-\nplex of climatic, edaphic, and biotic factors that act upon an\norganism or an ecological community and ultimately deter-\nmine its form and survival (Gboyega, 1998). In Nigeria, an\nenvironment is, by statute, defined to include water, air, land,\nand all plants and human beings or animals living therein and\nthe interrelationships that exist among these or any of them\n(Federal Environmental Protection Agency [FEPA], 2010).\nAjomo (2010) tended to agree with this definition, as accord-\ning to him, the Nigerian environment is composite in nature.\nThe environment affects the social, cultural, economic, and\naesthetic existence of man within it and ultimately deter-\nmines his survival (Nnanna, Alade, & Odoko, 2003).\nYouth restiveness, however, is a situation of the inability\nof youths to be still or quiet and difficult to control, espe-\ncially when they are unsatisfied with something. It relates to\nmatters of agitation by youths over issues of deprivation,\nneglect, marginalization, and other feelings of dissatisfac-\ntion. It can also be viewed as the engagement by youths in\nagitation for the restoration of their rights and dignity or self-\nseeking and criminal activities. In a similar vein, youth res-\ntiveness refers to the reactions by youths, both constructive\n(positive) and destructive (negative) to the \"use and dump\"\nmentality and attitude of those considered to be involved in\nacts of oppression and repression against their interests. It is\nequally a deliberate instrument of organized response to per-\nceived grievances that has an increasing potency and capa-\nbility for destruction. Essentially too, youth restiveness is a\nmanifestation of anxiety that encompasses the dysfunctional\neffects of anxiety on human body and the description of the\npsychological activities of the body that give vent to anxiety.\nIt is, in fact, a sustained protestation embarked upon with an\neye to enforcing a desired outcome from a constituted author-\nity by an organized body of youths. It is thus an excess\nbehavior attribute that is commonly marked by violence and\ndisruption of lawful activities.\nThe usage of the word \"youth restiveness\" became ubiq-\nuitous in Nigeria since the wake of the activities of youths in\nthe oil-bearing communities of the Niger Delta. The phe-\nnomenon is usually associated with adolescents because of\nthe fact that they confront a host of new, varied, and difficult\nproblems of adjustment that make the search for identity and\na place in society imperative. Ogbeifun (2007) categorized\nyouth restiveness into three categories--namely, genuine\nagitation, self-seeking and criminal activities, and youth on\nvengeance mission. Although the term has gained notoriety\nin usage, particularly in the Nigerian parlance, it has gradu-\nally assumed a global configuration, despite the fact that a\nstandard and generally acceptable definition is yet to evolve.\nTheoretical Framework\nAlthough there are several theories for explaining facts gen-\nerated in research endeavors, for purpose of this study, the\n\"Strain Theory of Deviance and the Frustration Theory\"\nwere adopted. This became expedient because all the factors\nthat are commonly advanced as an explanation for youth res-\ntiveness can be located in the above context due to the fact\nthat they all relate to the bottom line, which is dissatisfaction\nand unrealized goals.\nThe \"Strain\" theory as propounded by Merton (1968)\ncontends that deviant behavior results not from pathological\npersonalities; rather, it is a consequence of the culture and\nstructure of society itself. He reasoned that because all mem-\nbers of the society are placed in different strata of the social\nstructure, they do not have the same access to the realization\nof their shared values and goals. The shared values and goals\ntranslate into cultural goals which could be material posses-\nsion, educational attainment, and significant others. Merton\nfurther noted that people feel strained when they are incapa-\nble of meeting the cultural goals to which they are exposed\nowing to inaccessibility to the culturally approved and\nacceptable means of realizing the goals. The tendency there-\nfore is to resort to deviant and unacceptable means.\nIn the same vein, the \"Frustration\" theory presupposes\nthat a continuing or unresolved motivational conflict is a\nsource of frustration (Atkinson & Atkinson, 1975). This the-\nory argues that when a person's progress toward a desired\ngoal is blocked, delayed, or otherwise interfered with, he or\nshe encounters frustration. Blocked goal seeking therefore\nproduces confusion, bewilderment, and annoyance.\nFrustration, by implication, connotes an event rather than an\nemotional state; thwarting circumstances rather than their\nconsequences. Apart from the various types of conflict that\nprovide a major source of human frustration, there are other\nbarriers to the satisfaction of drives (Atkinson & Atkinson,\n1975). Frustration, whether it is the result of obstacles, defi-\nciencies, or conflict, has both immediate and remote conse-\nquences. This viewpoint is premised on the reasoning that\nwhen blocked in goal seeking, the individual or youth may\nreact immediately or develop attitudes toward uncertainty or\nrisktakingthathasmoreenduringconsequences.Restlessness\nand tensions are usually associated with many actions indi-\ncating unhappiness, dissatisfaction, and frustration and\nclosely related to increased tensions; and restless movements\nare the rage states that lead to destructiveness and hostile\nattacks that have become commonplace in the Niger Delta\nenvironment. Although aggression is often the result of frus-\ntrating circumstances, an explanation of aggression based\nsolely on environmental influences is incomplete. Because\nof the problems inherent in the original version of the frustra-\ntion\u00adaggression hypothesis, Berkowitz (1965) suggested\nthree alterations to the theory. He opined that emotional reac-\ntion does not compulsorily cause aggression, but it creates a\npredisposition for aggressive acts.\nThe above reality is typical of the Niger Delta youths who\nhave little or no access to the environmental opportunities of\ntheir region due to the insensitivity and neglect that charac-\nterize or underpin the activities and roles of the Nigerian\nstate in an unholy alliance with the oil multi-nationals and\nthe local bourgeoisie. Thus, the inability of the youths to\nactualize their goals through the institutionalized means in\nthe face of the opportunities that abound in their environment\nhas produced strains and frustrations culminating in all\nshapes of social problems and deviant practices that conse-\nquently pose serious threats to the same micro (Niger Delta)\nenvironment and the macro (Nigerian state) environment.\nThe strain theory of deviance and the frustration theory\ntherefore have the utilitarian explanatory value for the youth\nrestiveness and the attendant militancy activities in the Niger\nDelta region of Nigeria.\nRoot Cause and Legal Environment of\nYouth Restiveness\nNigerian legislation on petroleum predated exploration\nactivities or efforts in Nigeria. The first piece of legislation\nwas the Petroleum Ordinance of 1889 that was followed by\nthe Mineral Regulation (Oil) Ordinance of 1907, both of\nwhich provided the basic legal framework for the develop-\nment of petroleum and its natural resources (Omorogbe,\n2001). To a very significant degree, the nature of the colonial\nand post-colonial Nigerian state is largely structurally the\nsame, for the broad spectrum of laws and accompanying\nactions of the Nigerian state on the country's oil industry\nhave been no less an extension of the 1914 Mineral Act that\nvested all powers over resources (solid and liquid) on the\nstate as Omoweh (2006) rightly articulated. For instance, the\npost-colonial state like its predecessor has the exclusive right\nto issue mineral prospecting and mining licenses and the sole\npower to collect royalties, rents, and fees from the oil compa-\nnies. Both the Petroleum Act of 1969 and the Land Use\nDecree of 1978 are complementary and designed to\nstrengthen the instrument of oppression, suppression, mar-\nginalization, dispossession, deprivation, and disempower-\nment of the Niger Delta people by the state in collaboration\nwith its allies, the multi-national oil corporations, and the\nlocal bourgeoisie.\nThe origin of the law in Nigeria is traceable to a similar\nlaw enacted by the British in Northern Nigeria, inspired by\nEnglish tradition that vested all land on the English Crown\n(Constitutional Rights Project [CRP], 1999). The law can\ntherefore be described as one of colonial inspiration and\nfeudal inclination. Arguably, no where else in Nigeria has the\nimpact of the Land Use Decree manifested in alt its ramifica-\ntions and inequities as in the Niger Delta, Nigeria's main oil-\nproducing region. The Land Use Decree also sought\naccommodation for the oil companies who need land for vir-\ntually all its operations. In fact, the oil giants need land for\nexploration, production, transportation of crude oil by pipe-\nline, construction of oil terminal stations, flare sites, airstrips,\noffices, and staff quarters. This partly explains the logic\nbehind the content of the Land Use Decree that also provided\na buffer for the oil giants to be more reckless in their opera-\ntions. This may also be a part explanation for why Shell, for\ninstance, can afford to flare gas on a daily basis since 1956\nwhen it discovered oil in the Niger Delta and yet be shielded\nby the state over litigations on land where oil is explored or\nproduced (Omoweh, 2006). Land protection in the light of\nsustainability was, as a result, and is still not of any interest\nto the state that gradually rendered the Niger Delta people\ninto paupers through successive legislation including the\nPetroleum and Land Use and squatters in their own land.\nThus, the entire structure of the macroecological climate in\nwhich the Niger Delta is embedded and that has seriously\nstifled its development or facilitated its underdevelopment is\npredicated and premised on the legal environment that is the\nroot cause and foundation of youth restiveness in the region.\nOperational Activities of Oil\nConglomerates as Accentuation of\nthe Legal Environment of Youth\nRestiveness in the Niger Delta Region\nSince 1956, when the then Shell\u00adBritish Petroleum (BP)\nstruck oil in commercial quantities at Oloibiri in the Niger\ncrude oil exploration, production, and transportation activi-\nties have been on in the region with the first export of\nyears, which is on the eve of the Nigerian civil war, produc-\ntion had reached about 500,000 barrels a day, thus establish-\ning Nigeria as a significant oil producer (Owoeye &\nseveral other multi-national operators in Nigeria, including\nGulf (which later became Chevron and Texaco, which are\nnow merged and today known as Chevron\u00adTexaco) in 1965\nexploration and production activities of the oil giants in the\noil-bearing communities of Nigeria, several issues including\nenvironmental degradation, poverty, marginalization,\nresource control, and outright underdevelopment of the\nNiger Delta region have surfaced and constituted unending\nsources of conflict including youth restiveness.\nThe beginning point of any fruitful assessment of the alli-\nance between the state, its local bourgeoisie, and the oil\n4 SAGE Open\nmulti-nationals is to see the state as a contested terrain where\nthere is group interest and power play. The alliance of the\nthree actors, namely, the state, oil giants, and the domestic\nbourgeoisie also determines the dependence of the Nigerian\nstate on the oil surpluses and integration into global oil rela-\ntions. The alliance of the trio and the dependency elements,\nexploitative structural basis, and the constraining underde-\nvelopment effects is understood taking cognizance of the his-\ntorical circumstances of the Nigerian state that conspired to\nproduce a domestic bourgeoisie (elite group) that has no\nThat the alliance of the Nigerian state with the oil giants\nand the domestic bourgeoisie has played a dominant role in\nthe underdevelopment of the Niger Delta is indubitable. The\nchoice of the word \"underdevelopment\" is predicated on the\nunderstanding that the region has prospects for development\nbut not potentialities for same due to the laws, policies,\nactions, and operations of the trio (three actors) in the alli-\nance that has produced stagnation and retrogression in the\nregion (Jhingan, 2009). The role of the oil giants (transna-\ntional corporations) as agents of underdevelopment in the\ndeveloping world has for long been acknowledged and high-\ntional foundation did not only create the environment that is\nup till today plaguing the Niger Delta region but also set the\nstage for the operational menace in which the region has\nbeen engulfed. A deeper insight into the nature of the col-\nlaboration by the three partners in the unholy alliance can\nlargely be provided, taking cognizance of the fact that the\nNigerian state (pre- and post-colonial) formulates the poli-\ncies that create and determine the political and business envi-\nronment that are clement for the capitalist development of\nthe oil industry and the exploitation and underdevelopment\nof the Niger Delta region. The effects of the exploration,\nexploitation, production, and transportation activities of the\noil companies including gas flaring have been devastating to\nthe rich-oil region called the \"Niger Delta.\" The mass of the\npeople of the region are therefore pauperized through rural\npoverty that is foisted on them.\nA Critical Discourse of Youth\nRestiveness as Agitation and Response\nto the Operational Environment in the\nNiger Delta\nIn the early days of the oil industry in Nigeria, exploration\nand production activities of transnational companies (TNCs)\nwere at a relatively low level, less visible and intrusive than\nthey are presently. Oil-bearing communities were thriving on\ntheir traditional vocations of farming and artisanal fishing\nfor which they depended essentially on land, watershed, and\nnatural resources that were fertile, unpolluted, and highly\nproductive. Industrial and population pressures on land and\nwater resource were yet unknown in most of the communi-\nties (Onosode, 2006). Today, as a result of the increasing pro-\nfile of exploration and production activities owing to the\ninvolvement of many oil majors and minors, the Niger Delta\nregion has been a victim of environmental pollution and deg-\nradation. The same land that was productive has given way\nto the deteriorating effects of the operations of the oil con-\nglomerates. Shell Petroleum Development Company\n(SPDC), the oil conglomerate on behalf of the Nigerian\nNational Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)/Shell/Elf/Agip\nJoint Venture as at 1996, operated oil mining licenses cover-\ning an area of more than 31,000 sq km. The company oper-\nated an extensive network of about 900 producing oil wells,\nlines, and more than 1,500 km of trunk lines through which\noil flows from the aggregates of overlapping and superim-\nposed pools of accumulations of petroleum located in the\ngeological structures of the oil region to the two major termi-\nnals at Bonny and Forcados (Ejumudo, 2005).\nArguably, the proportion of land take is far more signifi-\ncant than it seems, considering the fact that the Niger Delta\nconstitutes one of Nigeria's most difficult geographical ter-\nrain and a significant proportional (of about two thirds) is\nmade up of water or at best is riverine. There is therefore a\nlimited, usable land. The accompanying effect is that in\nmany areas of the region, there is land hunger, especially as\noil companies cut up and confiscate farmlands with the legal\nbacking of the state. As land is farmed into oil concessions,\ndegrading of natural resources on the land commonly results\nin death of the land that is marked by declining productivity\nand rural\u00adurban migration is intensified. In fact, valuable\nportions of farmland, lowland, fresh water swamp forest, and\nmangrove resources have been degraded and such loss of\nhabitat and resources in the oil communities that depend on\nnatural resources is devastated, leaving the people in a\nvicious cycle of poverty (Onosode, 2006). The trail of natu-\nral resource degradation in places such as Oloibiri, Kokori,\nSangama, Boma, and other oil-bearing communities are\ntestimonial.\nAssociated implications of the operations of the oil con-\nglomerates in the Niger Delta region are oil spillage, gas flar-\ning, and pipeline vandalization. While oil spillages occur at\nvarious stages of product handling, from exploration to pro-\nduction through refining to distribution and marketing, no\nless than 96% of the spills are associated with the exploration\nand production and therefore localized in the producing areas\n(Roberts, 2005). Over the years, oil companies have spilt\nmillion barrels of which only 2.4 barrels were recovered,\nwhile the rest were retained in the environment. About 6,500\nm barrels of oil were spilt in 700 separate incidences each\nyear in Rivers, Delta, Bayelsa, and Akwa Ibom states (World\nlight crude leaked from a Mobil Producing Unlimited\npipeline at Eket in Akwa Ibom state. The incidences of spills\nand their impact are varied across the ecological zones, with\nmore spillages in land than swamp and offshore operations.\nThis impact of spills on the Niger Delta environment is more\nrevealing in view of the fact that Nigerian crude is very toxic\nand chemical dispersants often used to clean up spills tend to\naggravate the damage on the aquatic environment. In addi-\ntion, dispersants merely make spills more soluble and rela-\ntively invisible to the eye, but they do not remove the toxicity\n(Ayonote, 2005). The long-term effects of oil spills can be\nvery enduring largely because the devastation of plants and\nfarmlands continue insofar as spilled oil blocks oxygen sup-\nply and destroys essential nutrients in the soil such as magne-\nsium and nitrogen.\nAs far as gas flaring is concerned, across the Niger Delta,\noil conglomerates burn off gas from hundreds of oil wells in\nhuge fires. The disposal of associated gas has been a major\nchallenge to the region and the Nigerian state. On the aver-\nage, roughly 1,000 standard cubic feet (scf) of gas is pro-\nduced in Nigeria with every barrel of oil. With oil production\nof about 2.0 billion scf of associated gas is produced every\nday. Nigeria flares more gas than any other country in the\nworld, for the country is estimated as being responsible for a\nestimated that Nigeria flares about 75% of the gas it pro-\nduces due to lack of a local market and infrastructure. Apart\nfrom the fact that gas flares constitute a massive and monu-\nmental waste of a valuable national financial and energy\nresource, they cause significant environmental damage, prin-\ncipally because they kill vegetation, suppress the growth of\nsome plants, and diminish agricultural production. The dys-\nfunctional effects of the exploration and production activities\nof the oil conglomerates and operators in Nigeria since the\nclose of the 1950s have not only become a hydra-headed\nproblem but also raised many concerns and attracted the\nattention of environmental and human rights activists, devel-\nopment scholars, and research experts, as well as multi-lay-\nered levels of government.\nIn respect of pipeline vandalization, the Niger Delta has a\nhotbed of crisis. This is because the youth commonly resort\nto cutting of flow lines and destruction of oil facilities\nbelonging to oil companies or the NNPC. In 1998, for\ninstance, agitated youth vandalized NNPC's pipelines at\nJesse in Ethiope Local Government Area of Delta State in\nNigeria. Later, about 1,000 people went there to siphon\npetroleum products from the man-ruptured pipelines and\nthey were killed in the inferno (Okecha, 2011). Also, in\na raging inferno at the site of a vandalized NNPC pipeline at\nNnejiji and Umuegbede, both in Ngwa Local Government\nyouth were killed following an explosion on a vandalized oil\npipeline at Egborode village in Okpe Local Government\nArea of Delta State. The fire did not spare the fauna and flora\nas hundreds of hectares of farmlands were reduced to ashes.\nIn fact, statistics on pipeline vandalization in Niger Delta\nVandalization in the Niger Delta,\" 2009).\nCognizant of the above operational dysfunctionality of\nthe oil exploration and production activities of the oil con-\nglomerates in the oil-rich Niger Delta region stimulated by\nthe legal/constitutional environmental laws that empowered\nthe Nigerian state, emboldened the oil companies and simul-\ntaneously disempowered the oil-bearing communities and\nthe peripherally superficial, but failed, state institutionalized\ninterventionist efforts to close the development gaps of the\nregion, it is incumbent upon this study to locate and contex-\ntualize youth restiveness in the explanatory field of the strain\nconception of deviance and the frustration perspective of\nMerton and Atkinson, respectively. It is instructively sequen-\ntial to add that it is the blocked or delayed access to socio-\neconomic developmental opportunities and the consequential\nfailure by the youths of the region to realize their shared val-\nues and goals that produced confusion, bewilderment, and\nannoyance. One of the many-sided effects of the environ-\nmental injustice in the Niger Delta is therefore \"Youth\nRestiveness.\"\nThe frustrated and agitated youth of the Niger Delta first\nresponded to the prevailing unacceptable and detestable\nenvironmental and socio-economic situation through pleas\nand demands, but eventually with sundry forms of political\ncontestation, including violence to life and property (Okafor-\nOfiebor, 1997). A more eloquent and sophisticated response\nwas the pioneering struggle for the Movement for the\nSurvival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) championed by Saro-\nWiwa and his Ogoni kinsmen. The movement launched a\nvigorous local and international campaign for the ownership\nof the oil in the area. The campaign was guided by the Ogoni\nBill of Rights issued in 1990 that demanded for the political\ncontrol of Ogoni affairs by Ogoni people, control and use of\na fair proportion of Ogoni economic resources for Ogoni\ndevelopment, and the right to protect the Ogoni environment\nand economy from further development. Beyond the fact that\nother Niger Delta groups have the same agenda was the\ndemand by the Ogoni people for the abrogation of the Land\nUse Decree and the Petroleum Decree.\nThe non-violent approach was like a dialogue with the\ndeaf, for neither the state nor the oil conglomerates paid suf-\nficient attention. The Niger Delta youth thereafter opted for\nthreats and protests during which time oil companies were\nwarned to discontinue their operations in the region. On\nNiger Delta converged Aleibiri in Bayelsa state to protest the\nenvironmental degradation caused by SPDC. A retired navy\nlieutenant from Aleibiri was quoted to have said that the\nNiger Delta people would fight until there is freedom in the\nNiger Delta because they have been exploited for so long\n(Osaghae, 1995). The agitated youths more often than not\ndirect their violent protests at oil conglomerates because the\nlatter are perceived not just as the direct culprits in their\n6 SAGE Open\nplight but also as the most proximate government agents.\nSuch protests took the form of blockade of and sabotage to\noil installations (Mabro, 1997). The Niger Delta youths\neventually went beyond the sabotage of oil installations to an\nattack of the personnel of oil companies. In 1997, for\ninstance, a gang of armed youths attacked and closed down\nsix flow stations in Delta state, taking 127 personnel hostage\nand shutting in 10,000 bpd of oil. It took 6 days of negotia-\ntions to get the hostages released. Subsequently, 15 contract\nstaff on board a supply convoy were kidnapped and detained\nNotably, it was the increased anger in the oil-bearing\ncommunities with the crude and exploitative activities of the\noil companies and the growing perception of federal govern-\nment's tacit endorsement of same that resulted in youth res-\ntiveness and the formation of activist youth organizations\nand militia groups in the Niger Delta. Between 1990 and\n1999, at least 24 of such groups were formed that intensified\nstruggles, often with violent outcomes, against the compa-\nnies and federal (state) agents and agencies such as the police\nand the armed forces (Jega, 2007). Many of these groups\nhave made declarations that emphasize self-assertion and\nautonomy in the control of resources and management of the\naffairs of the communities in the Niger Delta. The groups\ninclude the Ogoni Bill of Rights, the Kaiama Declaration, the\nAklaka Declaration of the Egbi people, the Oron Bill of\nRights; the Warri Accord, and the Resolutions of the First\nUrhobo summit. In May 2006, for instance, the Movement\nfor the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said, \"there\nwill be no rest for the Nigerian government and collaborating\noil companies until all the stolen oil is returned to its rightful\nowners with compensation for all the years of theft and slav-\nery\" and the group had vigorously sponsored several violent\nprotests and instigated many kidnapping in the region\nEssentially, MEND criticized the piecemeal and divide-\nand-rule approach to the development of the Niger Delta\nregion and described the Niger Delta Development\nCommission (NDDC) as a channel for further looting of the\nmeager sums allocated to developing the Niger Delta\n(International Crisis Group, 2006). In protesting the approach\nof the Nigerian government and oil multi-nationals to the\ndevelopment of the Niger Delta region, the organized groups,\nwith their sophisticated weaponry, have since December\n2005, adopted the strategy of hostage taking that targets for-\neign oil workers and prominent Nigerian citizens. In fact,\nviolent crimes, including politically and financially moti-\nvated contract killings, cult wars, hostage taking, kidnap-\nping, arson, pipeline, and oil installation vandalization did\nnot only worsen the precarious security situation in the Niger\nDelta (Ikporukpo, 2007) but also equally threatened the daily\nexistence of the citizens and the corporate integrity of\nNigeria, especially with the proliferation of arms that is argu-\nably a threat to the macro-Nigerian environment and its sus-\ntainable development.\nThe implications of youth restiveness that are manifold\ninclude colossal damage to oil installations; loss of human\nlives; global warming; loss of rare plants and animals; ther-\nmal pollution of air, water, and land; loss of sources of liveli-\nhood; respiratory diseases; and destruction of social services.\nOthers include downturn in oil production capacity and rev-\nenue generation in the Nigerian state; disempowerment and\nsocio-economic dislocation of the Niger Delta youth who\ncannot reproduce themselves in the face of the poverty-\ninflicting and pauperizing environment, apart from the ulti-\nmate deprivation of the region and its youth from contributing\nto the enhancement of the productivity indicators that are\ncritically needed for national development initiatives, aspira-\ntions, and attainments; and the unprecedented peace-time\nsecurity challenges that constitute a potential threat to the\ncorporate existence of the Nigerian state. For instance,\naccording to a former vice president of Nigeria, Atiku\nAbubakar, the country lost N4.4 billion due to 400 pipeline\ndamages in the oil region between January and August, 2000\n(\"Nigeria Loses to Pipeline Damages in the Niger Delta,\"\nMore importantly, the serious implication of the human\ndimension of youth restiveness in the Niger Delta is evident\nin the fact that the youth are the energetic segment whose\nenergy could be galvanized to productive work for individ-\nual, community, and national development. The marginaliza-\ntion of the youth in the region and their engagement in\ndestructive and unproductive acts have not only resulted in\nsocio-economic unprogressive order but also denied the\ncountry the services of a core group of people who must\ninvariably form the backbone of the future. Involving the\nyouth in development therefore requires a conscious process\nof voluntary participation and it encapsulates three phases of\nunfreezing, change, and refreezing as Lewin (1948) rightly\narticulated. After all, a state with inbuilt socio-economic\ndeprivation or marginalization outcomes cannot but lead to\nsocio-economic and political exclusion.\nThe Failed Piecemeal Institutional\nMeasures of the Nigerian State to\nthe Niger Delta Crisis and Youth\nRestiveness\nThe challenges of development; that is to say the underdevel-\nopment of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria is as old as the\ncolonial dispensation. These challenges range from the\nabsence of basic social amenities and infrastructure to short-\nage of skilled manpower and socio-economic dislocations\ncaused principally by blocked access to wealth. This anoma-\nlous state of affairs was admitted by the Willinks Commission\nof 1958 in its recommendations to the then Colonial\nGovernment, shortly before Nigeria attained independence\nin 1960. The only remedy that the Commission proffered to\nassuage the agitated people of the Niger Delta region was the\ncreation of the Niger Delta Basin Development Authority\n(NDBDA) in 1959 to cater for the developmental needs and\naspirations of the region. However, the impact of the\nNDBDA, which was supposedly an interventionist agency,\nwas so infinitesimal and inconsequential that it can at best be\ndescribed as an abysmal failure.\nIn 1992, the Babangida regime created the Oil Mineral\nProducing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC) to\nreplace the Presidential Task Force established by his admin-\nistration in 1988, which was an abysmal failure. Although\nthe Commission was originally construed as a developmen-\ntal strategy to cater for the needs of the oil-bearing communi-\nties, it became overtly clear that it was political machinery\ndesigned to serve the purpose of the self-seeking military\njunta through the erection of a clientele of political support-\ners in the Niger Delta. The OMPADEC essentially deepened\nthe misery of the people of the region given the political\nmotive behind its creation and operations as mostly evident\nin the kind of projects that it embarked upon in the oil region\nand the manner it awarded the contracts (Omoweh, 2006).\nOMPADEC was therefore to any critical and discerning\nmind, a fraudulent venture, a financial jamboree or spree,\nand a state institutional framework to further the exploitation\nof the already pauperized and devastated Niger Delta people\nThe major policy instrument by which the Obasanjo\nadministration pretended to use to intervene in the Niger\nDelta crisis is the NDDC. This Commission was expected to\nbe an improvement on the woeful performance of the defunct\nNDBDA, OMPADEC, and the ill-fated Petroleum Trust\nFund (PTF) that was established by the Abacha administra-\ntion supposedly to improve infrastructure in the entire coun-\ntry, but which neglected the Niger Delta region. The NDDC\nwas, however, not significantly different from the previous\ndeliberately designed failed efforts of the ill-fated state so-\ncalled interventionist-development agencies because the\nthinking of the state and its allies in the exploitation and\nunderdevelopment of the Niger Delta has not altered.\nThe Yar'adua administration with its sincerity and com-\nmitment posturing has promised a holistic approach to the\nNiger Delta crisis and intends to actualize a Niger Delta\nDevelopment Plan, yet he clearly stated that the Federal\nGovernment's contributory share to the NDDC's funds in the\nObasanjo's administration had expired. The level of indebt-\nedness currently stands at more than 360 Billion Naira\n(N360b). The administration also created the ministry of\nNiger Delta affairs and put in place an amnesty program.\nWhile the former was supposedly meant to facilitate the\ndevelopment of the region, the later was probably designed\nto stop the menace of militancy and the accompanying das-\ntardly acts of the armed Niger Delta youths whose reactions\nand responses had steadily and stoutly been against the\nunending regime of neglect, oppression, marginalization,\nand pauperization by the Nigerian state in collaboration with\nthe oil conglomerates and the local bourgeoisie. The Niger\nDelta ministry initiative has turned out to be a mockery\nbecause it has not achieved anything as far as the develop-\nment of the region is concerned and the amnesty program has\nonly succeeded in selectively getting some of the militant\nyouths to accept pardon and participate in training programs\nthat will enable them to acquire skills that will enhance their\nliving standards. All the same, neither the over 1 year 3\nmonths administration of President Goodluck Jonathan nor\nthe Niger Delta ministry has been able initiate and execute\ninfrastructural development projects to tangibly address the\nhydra-headed nature of underdevelopment that the oil-rich\nregion had been enmeshed in and rehabilitate the teeming\nyouths who are desperately in need of safety nets.\nOn the whole, the failed piecemeal institutional measures\nof the Nigerian state, despite the creation of the Niger Delta\nMinistry by the Yar'adua/Jonathan administration, are such\nthat one can safely summarize that there has been a superfi-\ncial tinkering with the burning issues that concern the collec-\ntive destiny of the Niger Delta people. The bottom line of\nthis deliberate approach that reveals the insincerity, negli-\ngence, and lack of commitment on the part of the state and its\nelite is the demonstration of the hollowness of the mission\nand the deceit of the vision behind the cosmetic and dubious\nso-called development-based state intervention agencies.\nTherefore, the various factors ranging from social, political\nto environmental and economic factors commonly adduced\nas responsible for youth restiveness in the Niger Delta envi-\nronment can, in actuality, be situated in and explained by\nboth the \"Strain and Frustration\" theories.\nEfforts at Addressing the Youth\nRestiveness Palaver in Nigeria's Niger\nDelta\nSundry attempts have been made by different governments\nin Nigeria to tackle the Niger Delta crisis and its youth res-\ntiveness dimension. Some of such attempts include the appli-\ncation of the derivation principle in revenue allocation\narithmetic, the unsuccessful land use reform of the Yar'adua\nadministration, the short-run partially successful amnesty\nprogram, and the petroleum industry bill that is still under the\nlegislative process at the National Assembly. Below is an\nexpository critical discussion of the different efforts.\nIn respect of the derivation principle element of the reve-\nnue allocation regimes in Nigeria, the genesis of revenue\nallocation in Nigeria was in 1946 when the Colonial\nGovernment established the Phillipson fiscal commission.\nFrom that time till today, several commissions had been\nified some revenue sharing or distribution principles or crite-\nria. They include derivation, even development, needs,\nnational interest, fiscal autonomy, equality of states, popula-\ntion, expenditure capacity, land mass, internal revenue\n8 SAGE Open\ngeneration, terrain, primary school enrollment, and the like.\nThe controversy over an acceptable federal arrangement and\nthe basis for fiscal federalism in Nigeria has been a raging\nand troublous one. The fact that the matter still remains prob-\nlematic after 53 years of independent status sounds paradoxi-\ncal (Ejumudo, 2010). In the face of the numerous revenue\nallocation commissions and plethora of formulas, the conten-\ntious and political nature of fiscal federalism and the con-\ncomitant revenue sharing palaver exhibits the hollowness\nand inefficacy of the many failed efforts at redressing the fis-\ncal imbalance or inequity and the pseudo as well as the quasi\nnature of Nigeria's federal arrangement where the central\ngovernment is too powerful, domineering, and high-handed\nto the extent that the Obasanjo-led government seized the\nfunds meant for Lagos state councils because of the local\ngovernment development authorities that were created by the\nimmediate past Tinubu-led administration of Lagos state.\nThus, the concern about the mismatch between expenditure\nlevels and revenue bases is central to and, as a consequence,\nit is not strange to federal systems or arrangements. The\nstructural and foundational defect of the Nigerian federal\nunion and experiment does not only have the potency of\nmaking fiscal issues prone to crisis but also has actually\nlargely made the Nigerian federal arrangement a laughing\nstock.\nOf all the burning issues in Nigeria's fiscal federalism, the\nmost controversial and apparent locus or terrain of contest is\nthe derivation principle palaver. This principle is the only\none in the revenue sharing system that allows money to be\nappropriately returned back to the state or source and base of\nnatural resources. No wonder, derivation principle has come\nto be equated with the consciousness and efforts at the actu-\nalization of resource control in the Nigerian political terrain.\nOver the years, the controversy over the use of derivation\nprinciple center on the infinitesimal and inconsequential\nvalue in the weighting system of the various revenue alloca-\ntion efforts and formula. With the exception of the Nigerian\nfirst republic and the post-1999 democratic experience, deri-\nvation principle had attracted as little as 1% of the federation\naccount. In fact, while the various minority groups in the\nNiger Delta have continually pressed for a fair and better\ndeal or compensation in the revenue sharing arithmetic of\nNigeria given the centrality of their states in the revenue cal-\nculation of the country, the Nigerian leadership, especially\nthe military cabal have coercively employed the apparatus of\nthe state to effectively contain the opposition of the minori-\nties to government's imposition. They have also cosmetically\nand superficially tinkered with the issue that concerns the\ncollective destiny of the mineral-bearing communities and\nstates as evident in the slow and tortuous journey that culmi-\nnated in the progression from 1% to the present 13% deriva-\ntion formula.\nAgainst the background of the 50% derivation arrange-\nment that favored other regions in the entity called Nigeria\nbefore the current petro-dollar mono-cultural economic\nenvironment, it is not hyperbolic to describe the gap as fiscal\ninjustice. This injustice problem is further compounded by\nthe general failure of most governments in the Niger Delta to\njudiciously utilize their revenue for genuine developmental\npurposes. This may be a fruitful point to state, possibly in all\ncertitude, that the fiscal federalism endless problematic has a\ndevastating political economy underlying force. It is thus\ninstructive to note that the superimposition of the military's\nunitary command structure on the pre-military federal sys-\ntem and the growth and centrality of oil revenue engendered\na confused form of intergovernmental fiscal relations and\nsubstantial changes in the fiscal landscape. Regrettably, the\ndecades of military governance in Nigeria did not only\nentrench authoritarianism and autocracy in Nigeria's federal\narrangement but also accentuated the ideology of centraliza-\ntion of power and resources at the center and engendered the\nneglect of the Niger Delta in terms of infrastructure develop-\nment. This made Nigeria's federalism with all its elements of\nunitarism to be pseudo and quasi in nature.\nConcerning the land use reform initiative of the President\nUmaru Musa Yar'adua administration, a committee was set\nup to address relevant issues, particularly the need to restrict\nthe requirement for a governor's consent in land transactions\nto assignments only. Following the presentation of the Report\nof the Committee on land use reforms, President Yar'adua\nforwarded a bill to the National Assembly for some amend-\nments to Land Use Act to be known as the Land Use\n(Amendment) Act 2009. The bill sought to score off seven\nsections of the existing act, which was originally enacted on\nMarch 29, 1978. The act did not pass through the crucible of\nany parliamentary debate from which one could have dis-\ncerned the objectives of the legislators. However, from its\npreamble, the inalienable right of every Nigerian to partake\nof land, a major factor of production, was deducible. That\nexplains why not a few Nigerians initially rejoiced at the\npromulgation of the Decree (now an Act, entrenched in the\nLand Use Act, except for a few of its provisions, is based,\nalmost verbatim, on the 1962 Land Tenure Law of the defunct\nNorthern Region, which, in turn, derived its existence from\nthe report of the Perry Girard Committee. That Committee\nhad recommended that\na declaratory Proclamation should be passed to the effect that\nthe land of the Protectorate should be under the control and\ndominion of the Government, and that no title to the occupation,\nuse, or enjoyment of any land is valid without the assent of the\nGovernment.\nThis colonial report-turned-law, however, did not omit a\nrecommendation that \"the control and dominion of\nGovernment should be exercised in any particular case with\ndue regard to lawful customs proved to exist at present in the\nprovince or district where the land is situated.\" The latter rec-\nommendation was reprehensibly ignored both by the Land\nTenure Law of 1962 and by its successor, the Land Use Act,\nSection 5 of the Act makes it lawful for a Governor to\ngrant statutory rights of occupancy \"in respect of land,\nwhether or not in an urban area, to any person for all pur-\nposes and to demand rentals for any such land granted to any\nperson,\" while Sections 21 and 22 make it unlawful to alien-\nate by assignment, mortgage, transfer of possession, sub-\nlease, or otherwise howsoever a customary or statutory right\nof occupancy without the consent of the appropriate Local\nGovernment Area or Governor, respectively. Section 26 ren-\nders null and void any instrument that purports to confer on\nor vest in any person any interest or right over land other than\nin accordance with the provisions of the act. Other offensive\nsections include 34 (8) and 35 (7) relating to the transfer of\nundeveloped land in an urban area without the prior consent\n(in writing) of the Governor. By subjecting to consent all\ntransactions in the land, including alienation by assignment,\nmortgage to banks, transfer of possession, and sublease, the\nact has created a dead set against rapid socio-economic\ndevelopment, over the years.\nFor the Niger Delta region, the land use reform initiated\nby President Yar'adua should have checked the high-handed-\nness of the oil companies that are aware of the over-lordship\nof the Nigerian state and the near squatters' status of the oil-\nbearing communities. This understanding by the oil con-\nglomerates may be a part explanation for why Shell, for\ninstance, can afford to flare gas on a daily basis since 1956\nwhen it discovered oil in the Niger Delta and yet be shielded\nby the state over litigations on land where oil is explored or\nproduced (Omoweh, 2006). Land protection in the light of\nsustainability was, as a result, and is still not of any interest\nto the state that gradually rendered the Niger Delta people\ninto paupers and squatters in their own land through succes-\nsive legislation including the Petroleum and Land Use Acts.\nApart from the fact that the Land Use Act reform would have\nmade land available and accessible to the people so as to\nincrease home-ownership levels (Yar'adua, 2007), other eco-\nnomic activities such as agriculture, industries, and tourism\nwould have benefited from the review or amendment of the\nAct. Worthy of note is the United Arab Emirate (UAE) that is\ntoday a world tourism destination simply because of the\nchanges it made in its land rules. Specifically, in 2002, UAE\nliberalized its land rules, which gave foreigners freedom to\nacquire land and develop the same. Today, the story is what\nwe see as Masdar City in Abu Dhabi; Burj Dubai and Burj\nAl-Arab, both in Dubai; all these attract millions of dollar\nrevenue to the emirate. Regrettably, however, it beats every\ngenuine imagination that several years after, nothing has\nbeen heard in respect of its reading, not to talk of its debate.\nAs a step toward resolving the protracted insecurity in the\nNiger Delta, the Federal Government of Nigeria on June 25,\n2009, proclaimed unconditional amnesty for agitators in the\noil-bearing communities of the Niger Delta region. The\nterms of the amnesty included the willingness and readiness\nof the agitators to surrender their arms, unconditionally\nrenounce militancy, and sign an undertaking in this direction.\nIn return, the government pledged its commitment to insti-\ntute programs to assist the disarmament, demobilization,\nrehabilitation, and reintegration of repentant ex-agitators.\nThe key objective of the Amnesty Program is to address the\ninsecurity conditions in the Niger Delta as a prerequisite for\npromoting economic development in the region in particu-\nlarly and in the country as a whole. Since the proclamation of\namnesty for the agitators, relative peace and fragile security\nhave returned to the once volatile Niger Delta. From a paltry\nrelative peace that now prevails in the Niger Delta has aided\nthe remarkable growth of Nigeria's oil production to between\nPursuant to the core objectives of demobilizing, rehabili-\ntating, and reintegrating the former agitators into the Nigerian\nsociety, all the 26,358 persons enrolled in the first and sec-\nond phases of the program have successfully gone through\nnon-violence training at a demobilization camp in Obubra, a\ncommunity in Cross River State. For the demobilization\nexercise, the Federal Government engaged experts from\nNigeria, South Africa, and the United States. Following the\ncompletion of their non-violence training and career classifi-\ncation in the camp, the Federal Government successfully\nplaced a total of 10,395 former combatants in skills acquisi-\ntion/training centers as well as in formal education within the\ncountry and offshore. Similarly, 12,000 ex-agitators were\nsent to their reintegration centers to pursue either formal edu-\ncation or vocational training. In all, the beneficiaries of the\namnesty program are as at today in 36 local training centers\nin 12 States of the Federation; while the ex-agitators placed\nin offshore educational and skill acquisition centers are in the\nUnited States, Italy, Russia, South Africa, Malaysia, United\nKingdom, Israel, Sri Lanka, India, Benin Republic, Cyprus,\nPoland, Ghana, Belarus, UAE, the Philippines, Trinidad and\nTobago, Greece, Germany, and Canada.\nArguably, the amnesty offer was President Yar'adua's last\nditch solution to the age-long multi-dimensional crisis in the\nNiger Delta region. The crisis in the region had reached a\ncrescendo with militant activities ranging from kidnapping\nof expatriates (and even Nigerian) workers in the oil sector to\nblowing up of flow stations and outright criminality. The\namnesty was a political solution to a problem that seemed to\nhave defied other solutions. Before the granting of amnesty,\nPresident Yar'adua had tried other solutions such as drawing\nup the Niger Delta Master Plan and establishment of a Niger\nDelta Ministry (Omotola, 2010). It would seem that it was\nthe president's frustrations with the failure of these solutions\nthat culminated in the experimentation with the amnesty\noption. Although, the amnesty program can be adjudged to\nhave successfully reversed the serious security challenge that\nhad plagued the Niger Delta, nothing has been significantly\nachieved by either the Yar'adua/Jonathan administration or\nthe present Jonathan/Sambo administration to massively\ndevelop the glaringly marginalized and neglected region, a\nprecondition that is needed for the much-desired sustainable\npeace, security, and socio-economic development of the\nNiger Delta. Even the road leading to President Jonathan's\nhometown (Otueki) in Bayelsa state, almost 2 years into his\nfull-blown 4-year tenure, is in a state of disrepair. This is\napart from the multi-million naira contracts awarded and the\nsurveillance jobs given to key ex-Niger Delta militants,\nexpectedly to pacify the so-called militant leaders whose\nrepentance is still doubtful and the level of illegal oil bunker-\ning going on in the same region among the youths.\nIn respect of the petroleum industry bill that mainly seeks\nto utilize 10% of the profit from the oil companies for the\ndevelopment of the oil-bearing communities in the Niger\nDelta region, it is worrisome that apart from the opposition\nfrom the senators from the northern part of Nigeria who are\nclamoring for the inclusion of states that have oil pipelines\nand installations, the inconsequential fund may not be realiz-\nable. Moreover, full royalties from oil and gas companies are\nsupposed to be paid to the state, local government, and com-\nmunities where the oil and gas are extracted at a rate similar\nto what it was before the 1969 Petroleum Act.\nOn the whole, in the face of sundry efforts by the Nigerian\nstate, particularly the infinitesimal 13% derivation element\nof the current revenue sharing formula, the failed land use\nreform attempt, the partially successful short-run post-\namnesty program, and the controversial petroleum industry\nbill, the central developmental concerns of the Niger Delta\nregion have not been addressed. Thus, the need for the modi-\nfication of the obnoxious and eco-environmentally disadvan-\ntageous laws and a holistic developmental approach and\naction-based programs by the Nigerian government and oil\nconglomerates that will provide sustainable windows of\nopportunity and safety nets for the socio-economically dislo-\ncated youths cannot be over-emphasized.\nConclusive Remarks and\nRecommendations\nEvery environment is endowed with opportunities and con-\nfronted with threats. While the opportunities may be poten-\ntial (dormant) or actualized (activated), the threats are more\noften than not man-made. This position derives from the fact\nthat environmental resources in their natural state do not\npose any threats to man; rather, it is the utilization of the\nresources through their use or misuse that generates threats.\nIn the case of the Niger Delta environment, it is the treasure\nbase of the entity called Nigeria. This is because the Nigerian\neconomy is largely dependent on the petroleum sector that\naccounts for approximately 80% of government revenues,\n90% of foreign exchange earnings, and 95% of export\nreceipts. The Niger Delta environment from which the petro-\nleum natural resource is extracted is therefore the mainspring\nof the economy and the energizing force of the sustainability\nof the Nigerian state. This same environmental resource has\nalso created significant empowerment. The petroleum\nresource has engineered the process of limited access to the\nsocial amenities that today exist in parts of the Niger Delta\nenvironment, particularly the urban towns and cities.\nAlthough the opportunities accruable from the business envi-\nronment of the region are enough to transform the environ-\nment, the degradation, neglect, marginalization, repression,\nand deliberate underdevelopment of the environment and the\npauperization of its people remain a paradoxical puzzle.\nIn actuality, it is the use and misuse of the environmental\nresources of the Niger Delta and the concomitant devastation\nof the productive capacity of their land, careless pollution of\ntheir waters, and the degradation of their atmosphere in the\nface of the patent inequity in the distribution of the revenue\nderivable from the petroleum resources of the region that has\ngenerated threats that is arguably the basis of the restiveness\namong the Niger Delta youths. The restiveness is, in fact, the\nmajor explanation for the negative social activities such as\npipeline vandalization, kidnapping, thuggery, armed robbery,\nand sea piracy that have engaged the attention and energy of\nthe youths and also become a commonplace in the environ-\nment of the region. This is because the Niger Delta youths\nare caught in a web between a devastated traditional occupa-\ntional/economic mainstay and a blocked access to the oppor-\ntunities of a petro-dollar business environment. Thus, the\nwidespread relative and near-absolute poverty in which the\nNiger Delta youths are enmeshed has precipitated environ-\nmental crisis in the region with youth restiveness as one of\nthe multi-faceted dimensions.\nThere is therefore the exigency of achieving an accom-\nmodation between the level of costs and threats as well as the\nbenefits and opportunities in the Niger Delta. This is essen-\ntially due to the fact that environmental costs and benefits\ncannot be progressing separately at arithmetic and geometric\ndirections. And the equitable distribution of environmental\ncosts and benefits is not only the hallmark of environmental\njustice but also the standard for measuring deviation in prac-\ntice (Tietenberg, 2005). The juxtaposition of the two words\n\"costs and benefits\" is very important given the environmen-\ntal crisis situation of the Niger Delta region. Cost\u00adbenefit\ncriterion therefore presupposes that for every cost, there\nshould be not only a corresponding but also an exceeding\nbenefit. This is a gap that must be filled in an integrated and\na holistic approach to the environmental opportunities and\nthreats relationship as far as the macro-Niger Delta palaver\nand the accompanying hydra-headed youth restiveness prob-\nlematic are concerned. And with the little or no access of the\nregion's youth to the benefits derivable from oil exploration\nand production activities that should expectedly mitigate the\nnegative effects and costs of the environmental degradation\nto which they have been perpetually subjected, environmen-\ntal justice is thus a desideratum. This environmental justice\nwill permeate the legal/constitutional, operational, and insti-\ntutional aspects of the Niger Delta crisis through the\namendment or abrogation of the environmentally obnoxious\nlaws, the genuine massive compensational infrastructural\ndevelopment of the devastated and neglected region, and the\nsocio-economic empowerment of the pauperized, unproduc-\ntive, and agitated youth such that they can contribute to the\nnational development process. To this end, holistic efforts to\nanalyze and overcome the power structures that thwart and\nmilitate against the principles of fairness and equity and seek\nto redress the imbalances in the distribution of environmen-\ntal benefits and costs in the form of skill acquisition, job cre-\nation, health care, and educational assistance schemes and\nother pro-poor life-enhancing programs are desirable and\nappropriate.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAjomo, M.
