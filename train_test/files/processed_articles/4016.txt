This\nnotion was supported by Siyanova and Schmitt (2007) who\nstated that one of the most challenging aspects of learning\nEnglish vocabulary by non-native speakers is developing\nnative-like proficiency of phrasal verbs in both spoken and\nwritten English.\nAs a teacher of English for 7 years at Sohar University,\nthe first author has observerd this outstanding phenomenon\nin the writing of Omani student-teachers of English. Those\nstudents who are going to be teachers of English do not or\nrarely use phrasal verbs in their writing, preferring their\nequivalent single-word verbs even though the use of phrasal\nverbs is more appropriate as they provide vibrancy to dis-\ncourse as they \"seem to be a lot more vivid and emphatic\nThis notion was supported by Chen (2007), who stated that\nphrasal verbs are frequently used by native speakers of\nEnglish because of their \"characteristics of flexibility, practi-\ncability, adaptability and efficiency\" (p. 350). To validate the\nresearcher's personal observation regarding Omani student-\nteachers of English, this study will examine the types and\nfrequency of the phrasal verbs used by Omani\nstudent-teachers.\nBased on what has been stated above, the study sets out to\nanswer the following questions:\n1. Do Omani learners of English use phrasal verbs in\ntheir writing?\n2. Do Omani learners of English use certain types of\nphrasal verbs and refrain from using other types?\n3. Do they use such verbs in the same frequency that\nnative speakers of English do?\n4. Do these learners really avoid using phrasal verbs?\n5. Are there any reasons why Omani learners of English\navoid using such verbs?\n6. Are there any proposed methods that teachers of\nEnglish follow to encourage their students to use\nvarious types of phrasal verbs in their written\ndiscourse?\nPhrasal Verbs\nPhrasal verbs are intriguing linguistic phenomena as they are\non the interface between the domains of syntax and seman-\ntics (Davies, 2009). They are commonly defined as linguistic\nunits that are engendered from the amalgamation of a verb\nproper and a particle that can be an adverb, a preposition, or\nboth. The meaning of such combinations cannot always be\ninferred from the meaning of the verb and the particle\n1Sohar University, Oman\n2Universiti Sains Malaysia, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nZuhair Abdul Amir Abdul Rahman, Department of English and Translation,\nFaculty of English and Language Studies, Sohar University, Sohar, Oman.\nEmail: zuhairaljuboori@yahoo.com\nRarity or Non-Existence of Phrasal Verbs\nin the Written Discourse of Omani\nStudent-Teachers of English\nZuhair Abdul Amir Abdul Rahman1 and Raith Zeher Abid2\n Keywords\nphrasal verbs, Omani student-teachers, native speakers, corpus linguistics, production and recognition tests\n2 SAGE Open\nindependently. Aldahesh (2009) supports this definition stat-\ning that a phrasal verb is\na combination of two or three items (a verb + a preposition, a\nverb + an adverb, or a verb + an adverb + a preposition) which\nfunction as a single unit of meaning in the sense that its meaning\ncannot be deduced from the total sum of the meanings of its\nseparate elements. (p. 1)\nConsider the following example:\nThey did not get on with their mother.\nThe authors of this article intend to adopt the definition intro-\nduced by Gardner and Davies (2007) who proposed a more\nfunctional definition of phrasal verbs stating that two-word\nitems consisting of a lexical verb and an adverbial particle are\nto be considered phrasal verbs. This definition adaptation is\nbased on the notion that in spite of the many attempts made\nby grammarians and linguists to distinguish between phrasal\nverbs, prepositional verbs, phrasal-prepositio-nal verbs, and\nother multiword verb constructions, these attempts, the\nauthors believe, are of little instructional value for non-native\nlearners of English who struggle to master this linguistic area.\nPhrasal verbs are commonly divided into three main cat-\negories: non-idiomatic, semi-idiomatic, and fully idiomatic\n(Downing & Locke, 2006). Non-idiomatic phrasal verbs are\ncharacterized by their ease of comprehension as the verb and\nthe particle keep their own meaning, for example,\nThe brothers carried out the food.\nIn semi-idiomatic phrasal verbs, the verb keeps its own\nliteral metaphoric meaning while the particle is utilized as an\naspectual marker of several kinds, for example,\nThe mother cried out for help.\nThe meaning of fully idiomatic phrasal verbs (the focus of\nthis study) is too difficult to derive by only examining their\nconstituents because of their inherent idiomaticity. For\nexample, the meaning of the phrasal verb \"look + particle\" in\nthe following sentences cannot be deciphered by simply\nlooking at the constituents:\nI will go back to work if I can find somebody to look after my\nchildren.\nWe have been looking for you everywhere.\nDon't look down on them just because they haven't been as\nsuccessful as you.\nI am looking forward to seeing you again.\nA committee was set up to look into the causes of the accident.\nAll we could do was look on as the house burned.\nWould you please look up that word in a dictionary?\nThey have to look up to their parents.\nIn the above examples, the change of the particle that fol-\nlows the verb \"look\" brings about the change in meaning.\nThese particles are perceived as adverbial particle because\n\"they differ from mainstream adverbs in having very little\nHence, what causes the difficulty for non-native speakers\nof English to utilize idiomatic phrasal verbs is that the mean-\ning of the combination of the verb with the particle cannot\nalways be inferred from the literal meaning of the verb and\nparticle independently.\nPhrasal verbs like most other English verbs could either\nbe transitive or intransitive, for example,\nThe man held up his angry wife.\nMy car broke down on the side of the road.\nThe object can also be situated between the verb and the\nparticle as in\nHe had wanted to beat this man up for making such an offer.\nHowever, when the object is an unstressed pronoun, it is\npredominantly positioned between the verb proper and the\nparticle as in\nCan you put it off?\nIntransitive phrasal verbs, whereby the verb is not fol-\nlowed by a direct object, are commonly used as directives\nand imperatives (Biber, Conrad, & Leech, 2002), for\nexample,\nCome on Jack, let's hit the road and stand up straight.\nMoreover, there is a phrasal prepositional verb that con-\nsists of a verb (intransitive/transitive) + particle + preposi-\ntion, such as \"come up with\" as in\nThe student came up with a plan.\nPhrasal verbs are vital linguistic repertoire to acquire as\nthey are \"the most productive patterns of the English lan-\nbinations of verb + particle that increase overtime. This is, as\nMcArthur andAtkins (1974) put it, mainly due to the produc-\ntive nature of these kinds of verbs which can emerge at any\ntime, in any situation, and within any context throughout the\nEnglish language. The main reason for such continuous cre-\nation of phrasal verbs, according to McCarthy and O'Dell\nRahman and Abid 3\nchange and the need to develop words to describe new phe-\nnomena. To support their viewpoint, the writers mentioned\nthe following examples that have been recently used by\nnative speakers of English:\nAfter a whole week of birthday celebrations, I feel totally partied\nout!\nHe bigged up that new film, but when I went to see it I was really\ndisappointed.\nThey blessed out on music.\nI don't really buy into all that homeopathic medicine stuff.\nI'll text you back when my meeting finishes.\nSports promoters are trying to sex up cricket for the younger\ngeneration.\nChill out! Life is too short to get so stressed.\nThe meanings of the above phrasal verbs are \"have had\nenough of parties,\" \"praise very highly,\" \"become or make\nsomeone become totally happy,\" \"complete in a set of ideas,\"\n\"send a text message in reply,\" \"make something seem more\nexciting than it really is,\" \"relax completely, or not allow\nthings to upset you\" respectively.\nPhrasal verbs are units that are claimed to be frequently\nassociated with informal discourse because of their collo-\nquial distinctiveness which situates them \"at the informal\nend of the formal-informal continuum\" (Waibel, 2007,\n\"are often informal, emotive, and slangy, and may often con-\ntrast with Latinate verbs\" (p. 774). Though the frequency of\nphrasal verbs in Davies's (2008) the Corpus of Contemporary\nAmerican English (COCA) depicts the fact that these verb +\nparticle combinations are less frequent in academic writing\ncompared to spoken, fiction, magazine, and newspapers\n(Figure 1), this does not make phrasal verbs rare in written\ndiscourse. This is because the total number of phrasal verbs\nin native speakers' diverse written forms (fiction, magazine,\nnewspaper, and academic) exceeds the number used in the\nspoken discourse (Figure 2). The utilization of COCA by the\nresearchers is based on the notion that it provides us with\nreal-life language use of native speakers of English. COCA\nhas been used by many researchers due to its dynamic archi-\ntecture and rich database. This, in turn, increases the reliabil-\nity of the results that researches, including the present one,\nendeavor to reach.\nThe authors of this article believe that as phrasal verbs\nplay an indispensable role in communication, they are fre-\nquently used by native speakers of English both in speaking\nand writing. A number of recent empirical studies such as\nanalyzed the writing of native speakers of English and after a\nthorough analysis of these written texts, they found out that\nphrasal verbs are frequently used in the written communica-\ntion of native speakers of English. The authors of this article\nhave also arrived at the same conclusion. Though many\ngrammarians and linguists assert that phrasal verbs are\nlargely used in spoken language, none of the English written\ntexts the authors have gone through is characterized by the\nnon-existence of phrasal verbs.\nStudies on Phrasal Verbs\nThere are several studies that examined the use of phrasal\nverbs by English as a Foreign Language (EFL) or English as\na Second Language (ESL) learners. For instance, Yoshitomi\n(2006) explored the use of phrasal verbs by Japanese learners\nof English. The researcher concluded that phrasal verbs are\nused by native speakers more frequently than the EFL and\nESL Japanese learners did. Semantically transparent phrasal\nverbs were used more often than semantically opaque phrasal\nverbs. Furthermore, the results also showed that ESL learn-\ners differ from EFL learners in their tendency to employ\nphrasal verbs in a native-like way. Uchida (2012) examined\nthe implementation of phrasal verbs by EFL Japanese learn-\ners. The results indicated that Japanese EFL learners tend to\nemploy semantically transparent phrasal verbs more than\nsemantically opaque ones. However, the frequency of phrasal\nverbs tends to increase gradually with the increase of profi-\nciency levels.\nIt is fundamental to note that the majority of the studies\nthat examined phrasal verbs in the language of EFL and ESL\nlearners encountered the phenomenon of avoidance of these\nSpoken Fiction Magazine Newspaper Academic\nFigure 1. The frequency of phrasal verbs in COCA.\nNote. COCA = Corpus of Contemporary American English.\nSpoken Written\nFigure 2. The frequency of phrasal verbs in COCA.\nNote. COCA = Corpus of Contemporary American English.\n4 SAGE Open\nmultiword verbs. Schachter (1974) was the first linguist who\nuncovered the strategy of avoidance manipulated by learners\nwhen they find a structure difficult to use. Schachter stated,\n\"If a student finds a particular construction in the target lan-\nguage difficult to comprehend, it is very likely that he will\ntry to avoid producing it\" (p. 213). She further criticized\nError Analysis of being deficient in second language acquisi-\ntion as it was unable to discover avoidance phenomenon. An\ninterpretation of the term avoidance was presented by\nKleinmann (1977) who supported Schachter stating that it is\na strategy usually resorted to by L2 learners when they per-\nceive that it is difficult to produce a specific target language\nword or structure though they have already been exposed to\nit. However, Schachter and his proponents did not highlight\nthe fact that the strategy of avoidance might be the result of\nthe learner's complete ignorance of the structure rather than\nconscious avoidance. Studies that examined the avoidance of\nphrasal verbs include Liao and Fukuya (2004) who studied\nthe phenomenon of avoidance in the discourse of Chinese\nlearners of English. The results of the study showed phrasal\nverbs are predominantly avoided and both intermediate and\nadvanced-level learners produce less figurative phrasal\nverbs. Kweon (2006) studied the use of phrasal verbs by\nKorean EFL learners. The researcher concluded that the\navoidance behavior of Korean EFL learners is influenced by\n\"differences between first and second language, the inherent\nsemantic difficulty of phrasal verbs, and developmental\nframework of interlanguage processes\" (Kweon, 2006,\np. 175). The use of phrasal verbs by Iraqi undergraduate stu-\ndents in the Department of English Studies in Kirkuk\nUniversity was studied by Mohammed (2010).The researcher\nindicated that avoidance is a distinctive feature of the Iraqi\nstudents' writings and it is determined by the level of the\nphrasal verb complexity, that is, the less transparent the\nphrasal verb is, the more it is avoided. Sara and\nMohammadreza (2013) examined the use of phrasal verbs by\nPersian EFL learners. The results of the study indicated that\nthe participants avoid using phrasal verbs, and the level of\nthe semantic complexity of the phrasal verbs dictates the\noccurrence of avoidance in the student's writings.\nKharitonova (2013) examined the use of phrasal verbs by\nRussian and Norwegian learners of English. The results also\nshowed that avoidance does exist and that negative L1 trans-\nfer also occurs whereby students employ phrasal verbs from\ntheir mother tongue that have an erroneous meaning in\nEnglish.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe sample of the study is composed of three groups. The\nfirst group includes first-year students who join the English\nDepartment at Sohar University after completing their foun-\ndation year; the second group consists of fourth-year\nstudents who have already finished their foundation year and\nseven semesters. A group of native speakers of English who\nteach at Sohar University in different departments composes\nthe third group. The purpose of choosing first- and fourth-\nyear students is to find out how far their knowledge of phrasal\nverbs is different due to their different levels of proficiency.\nDesign of the Study\nThe study underwent four procedures that revolve around\ntwo test types: recognition and production. The recognition\ntest (seeAppendixA) was devised to find out how far the two\ngroups of students are able to recognize the phrasal verbs\nimplemented by an English professional writer in a written\ntext. The text in which 17 phrasal verbs are used was given\nto the two groups to underline all the phrasal verbs used by\nthe writer. A 1-hr period was given to the students to com-\nplete the task.\nOn the production level of the test, the fourth-year stu-\ndents and the native speakers of English were asked to write\nan essay of about three hundred words on \"A Day to\nRemember\" to find out how frequently they use phrasal\nverbs in their written discourse. The participants were given\n1 week to complete the task. It is fundamental to note that the\nstudents were strongly encouraged to solely rely on them-\nselves so that remedial aid will be provided to help them in\ntheir writing. A comparison between the two groups' written\ntexts was subsequently conducted to find out the types and\nfrequency of phrasal verbs they used in their essays.\nMoreover, a group of fourth-year students were asked to\nchoose the right phrasal verb from a group of phrasal verbs\ngiven to them (see Appendix B) to find out if they could use\nthem properly after they had been exposed to them. A 2-hr\nperiod was given to the students to complete the task.\nIt is crucial to mention that in the recognition as well as\nproduction tests, explicit verbal instructions were given to\nthe participants as well as a summary of the instructions was\nprovided in each task to facilitate the participants' compre-\nhension of the tasks presented to them.\nDiscussion of Results\nAfter investigating the underlined phrasal verbs by the two\ngroups in the recognition test, the results are presented in\nTable 1 shows that the second group performed much bet-\nter than the first group. While 159 phrasal verbs were recog-\nnized by the first group, 285 phrasal verbs were recognized\nby the second group. Moreover, some participants of both\ngroups underlined some constructions which are also com-\nposed of verbs and prepositions thinking that they are phrasal\nverbs, but they are not. It is obvious that the second group is\nmore proficient in English than the first group because of the\nlonger period that they have been studying English. These\nresults are in line with Sara and Mohammadreza's (2013)\nRahman and Abid 5\nwho emphasized that the frequency of phrasal verbs used by\nthe students is dictated by their proficiency levels.\nFurthermore, Uchida (2012) indicated that the frequency of\nphrasal verbs increases gradually with the increase of profi-\nciency levels. Figure 3 represents the results of the recogni-\ntion test:\nIn the production test, the participants (fourth-year stu-\ndents and native speakers) were asked to write a three-\nparagraph essay on \"A Day to Remember.\" The first-year\nstudents were not asked to do this test because of their poor\nperformance in the recognition test compared with the\nfourth-year students. Thus, the authors believe that focusing\non the fourth-year students will be sufficient to understand\ntheir level of comprehension of phrasal verbs. After a thor-\nough analysis of the essays, the results are noted in Table 2.\nTable 2 shows that both native speakers and the students\ndid not use many phrasal verbs in their writing. This is com-\npatible with what was previously stated by many scholars that\nphrasal verbs are used informally in spoken language.\nHowever, when both groups' usage of types of phrasal verbs\nwas examined, students are more inclined to use non-\nidiomatic phrasal verbs whereas native speakers tend to use\nidiomatic ones. This phenomenon is supported by various\nresearchers. Yoshitomi (2006) also emphasized that non-native\nlearners of English tend to use semantically transparent phrasal\nverbs rather than the semantically opaque phrasal verbs. To\nunderstand this phenomenon, many texts written by profes-\nsional writers were examined and, surprisingly, they show a\ntendency to use as many idiomatic phrasal verbs as possible.\nOne of the writers (Alexander, 1964) wrote an essay that has\nthe same title \"A Day to Remember.\" He used 17 idiomatic\nphrasal verbs in his three short paragraph essay. This gives an\nimpression that using idiomatic phrasal verbs in writing by\nprofessional writers is a feature of this type of writing.\nTo examine whether the differences between the two\ngroups' implementation of phrasal verbs is significant, a\ntwo-tailed t test with two samples assuming unequal vari-\nances was conducted. The Table 3 represents the findings of\nthe t test.\nindicate a significant variation in the use of phrasal verbs by\nnative speakers and fourth-year students due to the fact that\nthe native speakers used more phrasal verbs than the students\ndid. To elucidate this phenomenon, the authors randomly\nselected 15 essay papers written by the student participants\nand examined their contents. The examination indicated that\nstudents rarely use phrasal verbs to an extent that there are\nsome essays that have not a single phrasal verb. Moreover,\nthere are instances in which the phrasal verbs are grammati-\ncally correctly used, but it is semantically inappropriate, for\nexample, \"I put my step in a new house.\" Table 4 illustrates\nthe analysis.\nAfter correcting all the answer sheets of the second part of\nthe production test (fill in the blanks), Table 5 is presented.\nAgain, Table 4 shows the poor performance of Level 4\nstudents even though the list of phrasal verbs given to them\nrepresents a list of the 50 most frequently used phrasal verbs\nin native speakers' academic writing. The list, retrieved from\nCOCA, includes phrasal verbs given in Table 6.\nA majority of students do not know how to use phrasal\nverbs even when provided with a list of them. The poor per-\nformance of the participants in this part of the test is expected\nTable 1. Performance on the Recognition Test.\nChoice value\nfirst-year students)\nfourth-year students)\nFigure 3.

Performance in the Second Part of the Production\nTest.\nNumber of\nparticipants\nTotal number\nof items\nNumber of\ncorrect responses %\ndue to the fact that the non-existence of such verbs in the\nlearner's repertoire causes him/her to lack adequate strate-\ngies to recognize and process them. This means that the\navoidance strategy adopted by these learners simply resulted\nfrom their ignorance of this structure. Consequently, the phe-\nnomenon of avoidance of phrasal verbs arrived at by a\nnumber of researchers such as Sara and Mohammadreza\n(1985), the authors believe, is inapplicable to this study.\nPedagogical Implications\nThe lackluster performance of the participants in the three\ntypes of the test indicates why those learners find it difficult\nto use phrasal verbs in their written discourse. A cause of this\nis likely the limited exposure of the students to English\nphrasal verbs in the Omani school English syllabus that is\ncalled \"English For Me.\" English For Me, which is a set of\n48 books, is made up of 2 course books and 2 workbooks for\neach of the 12 school years. Hence, the researchers reviewed\nall 48 books to examine the type and frequency of phrasal\nverbs and they found out that only one exercise in Grade 8/B\npage 23 deals with phrasal verbs under the title \"Language\nFocus\" and is presented in Figure 4.\nThis is the only activity that focuses on the use of multi-\nword verbs (phrasal verbs) during the 12 years in which stu-\ndents study English. The designers of the program even\navoid using the term phrasal verbs in the exercise. Thus,\nOmani learners of English can hardly be familiar with phrasal\nverbs when using them in their spoken and written discourse.\nThe syllabus Omani students are exposed to is in no way suf-\nficient to help them use and acquire the various types of\nphrasal verbs in their spoken and written English. In this\nregard, many scholars like Gardner and Davies (2007),\nTable 6. Fifty Most Frequently Used Phrasal Verbs in Native\nSpeaker's Academic Writing.\nThe most common phrasal verbs\ngo on make up sit down come down break down\ncarry out take over turn out put down take off\nset up come out take on put up go off\npick up come on give up turn up bring about\ngo back come in get up get on go in\ncome back go down look up bring up set off\ngo out work out carry on bring in put out\npoint out set out go up look back look out\nfind out take up get out look down take back\ncome up get back take out bring back hold up\nRahman and Abid 7\nReppen (1998) criticized learners' syllabi that are not based\non research findings because the decisions about what to\ninclude in those syllabi are usually based on the author's gut-\nlevel impressions and anecdotal evidence of how speakers\nand writers use the language.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nThis study examined the use of phrasal verbs in the written\ndiscourse of Omani student-teachers. The analysis of the\nresults of the participant's performance clearly shows that\nphrasal verbs pose problems even for advanced learners.\nNonetheless, the issue is especially evident in the Omani\nstudent-teachers who learn English in a foreign language\nlearning setting where the class is the only opportunity for\nthe learners to study and practice English. The scarcity or\nnon-existence of phrasal verbs in the writing of these learn-\ners of English means that \"about one third of the English\npart of the learners' repertoire. In addition, the learners'\nFigure 4. The language focus exercise Grade 8/B text book.\n8 SAGE Open\nincapacity to use phrasal verbs means that these learners will\nmiss out on the growing number of phrasal verbs with new\ncombinations appearing every year (Villavicencio &\nIt seems evident that the students, unlike the natives, pre-\nfer to use single-word verbs to phrasal verbs especially idi-\nomatic ones though the use of the latter is more appropriate.\nThe result of this tendency is the absence or rarity of these\nverbs in their writing. Moreover, though native speakers of\nEnglish do not show the inclination to frequently use these\nverbs, they, unlike Omani learners of English who com-\nmonly use non-idiomatic ones, use idiomatic phrasal verbs\nmore than non-idiomatic ones.\nThe retrieved results lead to the recommendation that\nphrasal verbs should be given special emphasis with the aim\nof enabling the learners to achieve an effective and efficient\ncommunication in the English-speaking community. This\ncan be achieved via modifying the syllabus to include the\nmanner in which the most common phrasal verbs are used by\nnative speakers in their everyday language. As phrasal verbs\nare inevitable in native speakers' communication for their\nflexibility, practicability, and efficiency, it is, therefore, rec-\nommended that the elements of any Omani syllabus should\nbe selected according to empirical corpus-based research\nfindings to help in compiling a selection of naturally occur-\nring language that can be very useful for teaching both spo-\nken and written English. Selecting items for a syllabus,\ntherefore, should not be in any way based on teachers' and\nlinguists' intuition however experienced they are.\nAs such, this study has shown the difficulty Arabic L1\nusers commonly face in using phrasal verbs in their English\nwritten discourse, and how in particular their use of such\nverbs is in need of attention. Further research needs to be\ndone into the effectiveness of various approaches to teaching\nthese verbs, especially idiomatic ones, as it is clear that cur-\nrent product-based approaches are not equipping our stu-\ndents with the ability to use them. In this regard, the writers\nbelieve that the downward and upward approach recom-\nmended by Chen (2007) appears very relevant. The down-\nward approach stresses the teaching of the components of\nphrasal verbs which students are familiar with. This is a psy-\nchologically strategic step by which learners feel that phrasal\nverbs involve nothing difficult, hence, they will be more con-\nfident to learn them. The upward approach is then applied via\nintroducing the phrasal verbs that are used in daily\ncommunication.\nAppendix A\nRecognition Test\nRead the following passage and underline all phrasal\nverbs:\nWe have all experienced days when everything goes\nwrong. A day may begin well enough, but suddenly every-\nthing seems to get out of control. What invariably happens is\nthat a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely\nthe same moment. It is as if a single unimportant event set up\na chain of reactions. Let us suppose that you are preparing a\nmeal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time. The\ntelephone rings and this marks the prelude to an unforeseen\nseries of catastrophes. While you are on the phone, the baby\npulls the table-cloth off the table, smashing half your best\ncrockery and cutting himself in the process. You hang up\nhurriedly and attend to baby, crockery, etc. Meanwhile, the\nmeal gets burnt. As if this were not enough to reduce you to\ntears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three\nguests to dinner.\nThings can go wrong on a big scale as a number of people\nrecently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney.\nDuring the rush hour one evening two cars collided and both\ndrivers began to argue. The woman immediately behind the\ntwo cars happened to be a learner. She suddenly got into\npanic and stopped her car. This made the driver following her\nbrake hard. His wife was sitting beside him holding a large\ncake.As she was thrown forward, the cake went right through\nthe windscreen and landed on the road. Seeing a cake flying\nthrough the air, a lorry-driver who was drawing up alongside\nthe car, pulled up all of a sudden. The lorry was loaded with\nempty beer bottles and hundreds of them slid off the back of\nthe vehicle and on to the road. This led to yet another angry\nargument. Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind. It took the\npolice nearly an hour to get the traffic on the move again. In\nthe meantime, the lorry-driver had to sweep up hundreds of\nbroken bottles. Only two stray dogs benefitted from all this\nconfusion, for they greedily devoured what was left of the\ncake. It was just one of those days!\nAppendix B\nProduction Test\nComplete the sentences using the phrasal verbs below:\ncome on, come in, go down, work out, set out, take up, get\nback, sit down, turn out, take on, give up, get up, look up,\ncarry on, go up, take out, come down, put down, put up, turn\nup, get on, put down, bring up, get on, bring in, break down,\nbring back, take off, go off, set off, put out, hold up, look out,\ngo on, carry out, set up, pick up, come back, go out, find out,\nmake up, take over, come out.\n1.
