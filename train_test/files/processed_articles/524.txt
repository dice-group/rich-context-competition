Recommendations for cervical screening are less controversial, although they are constantly evolving. Several\norganizations, including the American Cancer Society (ACS), the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and\nmajor organizations within each field, offer recommendations guiding clinical care. The opinions of each professional\nsociety's recommendations often differ with regard to age of initiation and discontinuation of screening, frequency of\nscreening, and screening tool.\nClinical breast examinations are recommended by the ACS and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecol-\nogists (ACOG)1\u00ad3 but are not recommended by the USPSTF or the World Health Organization because of the risks of\nanxiety and unnecessary biopsies.4,5 In contrast, all major organizations recommend mammography; however, contro-\nversy exists with regard to the age of initiation. The USPSTF recommended against routine screening with mammography\nin women aged <50 years in 2009,4 which resulted in significant controversy.\nScreening for melanoma with routine skin examinations is recommended by the ACS.2 However, the USPSTF cites\ninsufficient evidence to support screening.6 The Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Dermatology recom-\nmend screening for those at high risk, including older, white men.8,9 Professional dermatology organizations are con-\nstantly examining this issue, attempting to provide better evidence of the benefit of routine screening.\nProstate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal examination (DRE) is no\nlonger recommended by the American Urologic Association (AUA).

Its annual use is recom-\nmended by the ACOG, although the ACOG\nacknowledges the lack of evidence for its use alone in the\nasymptomatic patient.12 It is recommended against by the\nUSPSTF for ovarian cancer screening.14\nIn this study, we examine the most recent data repre-\nsenting the rates of screening examinations currently con-\nducted in a nationally representative population of\nprimary care practices. We compare the rates of examina-\ntions that are and are not recommended, and we also\nexamine the factors that influence screening rates.\nData from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Sur-\nvey, a publicly available survey conducted by the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, was used. We exam-\nined only visits to non\u00adfederally employed, office-based\nphysicians (general, family practice, and internal medicine\ngroups) for nonillness care and preventive care from 2005\nwere limited to routine physical examinations and general\nmedical examinations. We excluded pregnant patients\nwho were undergoing prenatal follow-up, and we also\nexcluded any visits related to injuries. The rates of breast\nexaminations and mammography were examined only\namong women aged >40 years, pelvic examinations and\nPapanicolaou (Pap) smears were examined among women\nages 18 to 70 years, and DRE and PSA tests were exam-\nined among men ages 50 to 75 years. The rate of skin\nexaminations was examined in patients aged 18 years\nand again in patients aged 50 years, because there are no\nguidelines for the age at which skin examinations should\nbegin. The ranges were based on current screening\nrecommendations.\nThe National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data\nprovide information from the nation's largest study of\nambulatory care provided at physicians' offices. Partici-\npants are composed of office-based physicians randomly\nselected from information obtained from the American\nMedical Association and the American Osteopathic Asso-\nciation. The US Census Bureau acts as the field data-\ncollection agent. Participants provide data through the\nuse of survey instruments on 30 randomly selected patient\nvisits during a randomly assigned, 1-week reporting pe-\nriod. Thirty visits are used from each physician to equalize\nreporting levels among the sample regardless of practice\nsize. The data are collected either by the physician or by\nthe physician's staff; although, in 51.5% of visits during\n2009, for example, data were collected by Census field\nrepresentatives trained in data collection. The field staff\nalso makes completeness checks. In addition, manual cler-\nical edits, during which ambiguous entries are reclassified\nor recoded, are performed upon the receipt of data for\ncentral processing. Computer edits for code ranges and\ninconsistencies also are performed. Error rates for coding\nrange between 0% and 1%, depending on the survey\nitem. Item nonresponse rates are 5%. Imputations are\nperformed for missing data.15\nThe survey instrument varies slightly from year to\nyear but includes the following data: patient date of visit;\nzip code; birth date; sex; ethnicity; race; source of pay-\nment; tobacco use; medical history; vital signs, including\nheight and weight; whether the visit is related to an injury\nor poisoning; whether the provider is the primary care\nphysician or whether the provider has seen the patient\nbefore; the reason for the visit; the primary diagnosis or\ndiagnoses; diagnostic tests, including physical examina-\ntion, imaging, and blood tests; the procedures, health edu-\ncation, nonmedication treatment, medications, or\nimmunizations provided; type of provider; time spent\nwith the provider; and follow-up. All items are multiple-\nchoice except for medications and immunizations, which\nmay be written in by the provider. The questionnaire and\nrelated documentation are available online .16\nWe calculated the prevalence rate for each of the\nexaminations and tests among eligible visits per year. We\nused the Fisher exact test to compare the prevalence across\nyears. We compared the prevalence of examinations from\nwe examined the factors associated with whether or not\neach of the examinations took place. These included age,\nethnicity, race, sex, smoking status, source of payment\n(Medicaid and self-pay vs Medicare and private insur-\nance), practitioner type (MD or DO vs nurse practitioner\nor physician assistant), and the number of chronic medical\nconditions. Race was divided into 4 groups: white, black,\nAsian, and other, which included American Indian, native\nAlaskan, native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander.\nOriginal Article\nEthnicity was defined as Hispanic or Latino and non-\nHispanic or non-Latino. Age and the number of chronic\nmedical conditions were examined continuously. We\nused t tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests\nfor categorical variables to examine the influence of each\nvariable on each screening test or examination. The signif-\nicance level was set at P < .05. Statistical analyses were\nconducted using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) sta-\ntistical software package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\nRESULTS\nThe prevalence rate of clinical breast examinations among\neligible visits was significantly higher than that of mam-\nexaminations did not significantly differ from that of Pap\nsmears (P 5 .087).

It is noteworthy that, when\npatients without insurance were excluded, the trend\nremained the same (P < .01) (Fig. 4).\nDISCUSSION\nOur study validates the disparity that exists in cancer\nscreening with regard to race and socioeconomic status.\nNumerous studies have addressed this issue,17\u00ad22 espe-\ncially in recent years as the debate regarding universal\nhealth care has made its way to the national foreground.\nStudies have demonstrated that this disparity is mini-\nmized or does not exist in systems with universal access to\ncare.23,24 We observed that white patients received all\nscreening examinations and tests significantly more fre-\nquently than black, Asian, Hispanic, and other patients.\nThese findings are in line with numerous studies demon-\nstrating a lack of access to care among nonwhites,25 stigma\npreventing certain cultures from seeking routine medical\ncare like gynecologic screening,26,27 and distrust and mis-\nunderstanding of the US medical system among particular\nethnic groups.28 Many studies have demonstrated\nincreased mortality for black patients with skin, breast,\nprostate, and cervical cancers compared with their white\nblack men with prostate cancer, for whom studies indicate\nthat mortality is 2 to 3 times higher than for white\nmen.30,31 Newer studies demonstrate this disparity not\nonly with black patients but also with southeast Asian\nand Hispanic patients.32 Those studies demonstrate why\nfinding solutions to closing these gaps is especially\nimperative.\nNot only did we observe a large disparity with regard\nto race and ethnicity, but our findings also confirmed the\nrole of insurance in cancer screening. Patients who were\npaying with private insurance or Medicare were far more\nlikely to receive all examinations and tests than patients\nwho were paying with Medicaid or who were without in-\nsurance. When we excluded patients without insurance,\nthe results were similar. Medicare coverage is considered\nby many to be superior to Medicaid programs because of\naccessibility, selection of providers, and reimbursement\nrates.33 Although both programs theoretically cover rec-\nommended cancer screening examinations, our data sug-\ngest that the screening of patients with Medicaid falls\nTABLE 3.

This is line with studies documenting the impor-\ntance of insurance on cancer screening.34\nMany of our findings are consistent with current rec-\nommendations. This is especially true with regard to age.\nThe mean age for starting clinical breast examinations\nwas 46 years, whereas that for starting mammography was\n51 years. Recommendations from the ACS suggest that\nyearly breast examinations and mammograms should\nbegin at age >40 years.1,2 Although the USPSTF does not\nrecommend breast examinations, it does suggest that\nmammograms begin at age 50 years.4 The mean ages for\nstarting DREs and PSA tests were 52 years and 60 years,\nrespectively, which fell well within the commonly recom-\neffective medicine, however, it may become increasingly\nimportant to act based on strict evidence based-\nrecommendations. A recent National Ambulatory Health\nCare (NAMCS) study demonstrated that many services,\nincluding breast and prostate screening, continue to be\nOne such screening measure may include clinical\nbreast examinations, the rate of which was higher than\nthat for mammography, despite research suggesting no\nadditional mortality benefit with clinical breast examina-\ntions.38 The sensitivity of detecting breast cancers with\nmammogram versus mammogram plus clinical breast ex-\namination is similar; however clinical breast examinations\nlead to higher rates of false-positive results.39 Because of\nsuch evidence, the USPSTF does not recommend routine\nclinical breast examinations.40 They are still recom-\nmended, however, by the ACS and the ACOG,1,3 likely\nbased on slight gains in sensitivity of detection.\nIn our study, the rate of pelvic examinations did not\ndiffer significantly from that of Pap smears. Although the\ndefinition of a pelvic examination is not entirely clear\nfrom NAMCS data, we interpreted this as distinct from a\nPap smear, entailing an external visualization, speculum\nexamination, and=or bimanual pelvic examination for use\nin cervical and ovarian cancer screening.12 Whereas cytol-\nogy with a Pap smear is routinely recommended by most\nsupporting the role of pelvic examinations is lacking.42\nDespite this, our study is similar to a recent study of US\ngynecologists demonstrating that screening with bima-\nnual pelvic examinations is performed routinely. Forty-\nseven percent of survey participants in that study cited\ndetection of ovarian cancer as the reason for performing\nthe examination.43 The evidence indicates that the likeli-\nhood of detecting ovarian cancer with screening is so low\nthat it is recommended against by the USPSTF.14 In addi-\ntion, pelvic examinations often are associated with signifi-\ncant embarrassment, discomfort, and anxiety.44 Our data\nindicate perhaps some concordance with such evidence, as\nthe rate of pelvic examinations is slowly declining.\nDespite the rising incidence of melanoma,45,46 skin\ncancer screening is currently not recommended by the\nUSPSTF because of a lack of evidence of mortality bene-\nfit.6,47 However, it is recommended by the ACS.2 Skin can-\ncer screening by primary care physicians is not routinely\nprovided.48 More recent evidence suggests, however, that\nphysician detection is associated with thinner melanomas\nand a significant survival advantage.7,49 Although our data\ndemonstrate that skin cancer screening has significantly\nincreased over a 10-year period, the rates of other examina-\ntions that similarly lack evidence of mortality benefit,\nincluding breast and pelvic examinations,39,42 continue to\nbe significantly higher than the rate for skin cancer screen-\ning. This is consistent with findings from a NAMCS study\nLack of time is commonly cited as a reason why\nscreening is not performed,51 particularly for skin, breast,\nand prostate cancers.52\u00ad55 To our surprise, the number of\nchronic medical conditions did not seem to have a signifi-\ncant influence on the rate of examinations or tests. This\nwas true in all cases except Pap smears, for which a higher\nnumber of chronic medical conditions meant a lower rate\nof examinations. This may be explained by our inclusion\nof only routine physical examinations in our study, which\nmay not have addressed the management of chronic\nissues. However, this result is still promising. According\nto our study, a patient's complex medical history does not\npreclude conducting recommended routine cancer screen-\ning in the setting of scheduled preventive visits. This is in\ncontrast to other studies, which have indicated that\npatients with chronic conditions may experience neglect\nof unrelated disorders during primary care visits.56\nAlso unexpected in our study was the finding that\nsmokers were less likely to be screened than nonsmokers.\nIt is well established that smoking is a risk factor for and\nplays a significant role in the pathogenesis of most can-\ncers.57 It is possible that smokers were screened less often\nbecause of the presence of additional comorbidities associ-\nated with smoking58,59 as well as the extra time it may\nhave taken to counsel smoking cessation.60 Smokers may\nalso be less likely to consult physicians for preventive\nhealth maintenance visits. Regardless of the reason, this\nfinding highlights a need for the risk stratification of\npatients who require screening. For example, although\nroutine skin cancer screening is not recommended, evi-\ndence suggests that screening in at-risk populations, such\nOriginal Article\nas elderly white men, is likely to yield a significant mortal-\nity benefit compared with screening all patients.7 Risk\nstratification should be based on other factors as well,\nsuch as family history.61\nOur study also demonstrates the changing role of\nthe physician in the practice of primary care. Significantly\nmore screening examinations and tests took place when\nthe visit was conducted by a nurse practitioner or a physi-\ncian assistant rather than by a physician. Nurse practi-\ntioners and physician assistants conducted routine\nscreening examinations more often than physicians,\nwhereas physicians addressed more acute complaints and\nchronic illness visits. This speaks to the expanding role of\nnurse practitioners and physician assistants in primary\ncare.62 More and more practices, not only in the commu-\nnity but at academic centers as well, are integrating non-\nphysician practitioners as part of an effort to address the\nprimary care shortage. The role of the nurse practitioner is\nnot clearly defined.63,64 Our study documents the increas-\ning importance of nonphysician practitioners in providing\npreventive care and demonstrates an area in which the\nefforts of physician assistants and nurse practitioners may\nbe especially realized.\nLimitations of this study are related to our use of data\nfrom a publicly available survey instrument. The survey\nform is completed by the provider, provider staff, or\nNAMCS field staff. Variables in the survey form were\nlargely objective, because they were based on data from the\nvisit. Although this helps to minimize some bias tradition-\nally associated with questionnaires administered to patients,\nsurvey of the providers may be associated with variability in\nhow the survey form was completed. For example, some\nmay have completed forms during or immediately after the\nvisit, whereas others may have completed them at a later\ntime, making the data more prone to recall bias. Providers\nalso knew they were being observed during the week of vis-\nits and may have altered their clinical behavior, whether\nintentional or not. In addition, we were limited by the data\navailable from the survey form. We would have liked to\ninclude data regarding colon cancer screening; however,\nthe survey form did not explicitly collect data for fecal\noccult blood tests, sigmoidoscopy, or gastrointestinal refer-\nral. Although the survey form did collect data for colono-\nscopy, in our preliminary analysis, we observed that it was\nseldom ordered. We hypothesized that this was because of\nthe recommendation for routine colonoscopy only every\n10 years and the availability of flexible sigmoidoscopy as an\nacceptable alternative to colonoscopy for cancer screen-\ning.65 It is also a procedure that is not consistently ordered\nby primary care providers themselves but, rather, upon\nreferral to gastroenterology. We included only screening\nexaminations and tests in our study that were likely done or\nordered by the provider at the time of the primary care\nvisit.\nCancer screening is a key component of primary\ncare. The goal of cancer screening is to balance the risk of\ndiagnostic workup with mortality benefit. In our\npopulation-based study representing primary care\npractices across the United States, we identified trends in\ncancer screening practices that have important implica-\ntions for the practice and delivery of health care. It is im-\nportant to document patterns of cancer screening to\nidentify areas of strength and areas that need significant\nimprovement.\nThis study was supported by an American Society for Dermatologic\nSurgery Cutting Edge Research Grant.\nThe authors made no disclosures.\nREFERENCES\n1.
