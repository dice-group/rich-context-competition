    "abstract": "Abstract\nFracking, an extraction technique for unconventional oil and gas, has proved highly controversial in England,\nwith environmental and health impacts being a central concern. Although the topic has been widely debated,\nsuch debate has focused on the pros and cons of the technique and little attention or literature has focused on\nthe current regulatory system. At present, uncertainty surrounds numerous aspects of the extraction\ntechnique and the promotion of fracking in England is largely founded on the assumption that a strong\nregulatory system is already in place to control any impacts. This article will examine the current suites of\nregulation and will highlight the gaps that are present within the existing European Union (EU) and national\ncontrols and their connection to potential environmental and public health damage. Such an examination\nwill consider legislation as well as the ability of regulators in England to act. This article will show that, at\npresent, the system governing fracking is far from satisfactory. In light of this, the regulatory approaches\nnow available will be evaluated and the need for a more precautionary approach to regulation highlighted.\n",

However, the extraction of such\n`unconventional' gas is not without its issues, particularly the technique of hydraulic fracturing \u00ad commonly\nknown as fracking \u00ad which is used to release it. Current literature surrounding shale gas exploration in\nEngland has focused on examining the positive and negative consequences associated with the develop-\nment of such an industry.1 Only brief comment has been made on the state of the current English regu-\nlation.2 Since the shale gas industry is at a critical stage of development in England, examining the\nCorresponding author:\nJo Hawkins, Bristol Law School, Wills Memorial Building, Queens Road, Clifton, Bristol, BS81RJ, United Kingdom.\nEmail: jo.hawkins@bristol.ac.uk\n1.

The focus of this article will be upon the regulatory framework and role of authorities in England; as\nsuch, it will not be a comparative piece.\nWhilst there have been arguments based on the assertion that fracking is, in fact, not a new technology,\nsuch arguments are misleading as technological advances and changes in intensity and depth mean that, in\nthe present context, the current fracking techniques are novel. The relationship between regulation and\nnew technologies is something that is apparent, but not unique, in relation to fracking. The issue of reg-\nulatory gaps and the imposition of controls after the event is a problem that can be seen in relation to other\nnovel technologies such as genetically modified organisms and nano-technology.3 In the context of frack-\ning, the time and political pressure for development, due to energy supply and energy security demands,\nhighlights the tensions and problems that can emerge in the relationship between the law and novel tech-\nnologies. For reasons of space, this aspect is not a core concern of this article, but is worthy of further\nfuture study.\nThe first part of this article outlines what fracking is and the concerns associated with it. An examination\nof the current regulatory gaps and uncertainties will then be undertaken. The final part of this article will\nexamine how the regulation of fracking should proceed, highlighting the options available and demonstrat-\ning the benefits of a temporary moratorium whilst a more precautionary approach to the regulation is\ndeveloped.\nWhat is hydraulic fracturing/fracking?\nFracking is the extraction technique for natural gas or oil found within unconventional resources such as\nshale formations. Artificial fractures are created by injecting wells at high pressure with water, tracers (that\nallow the fracturing fluids to be tracked), chemical additives (such as friction reducers) and proppants\n(which keep the created fractures open allowing the gas released to flow).4 The resources are unconven-\ntional because the oil and gas trapped within them is not recoverable using conventional methods. Addi-\ntional stimulation techniques are required, hence the use of fracking. To conduct onshore shale gas\nexploration involving fracking in England the following process must be followed. Petroleum Exploration\nand Development Licences (PEDL) for shale gas exploration are obtained through licensing rounds, plan-\nning permission is then sought for a particular exploration site, relevant permits are obtained from the Envi-\nronment Agency, an independent well inspection is arranged and notification to drill given to the Health and\nSafety Executive. Monitoring plans are then agreed before consent to drill is awarded by the Department of\nEnergy and Climate Change (DECC), followed by the submission of a hydraulic fracturing plan which,\nwhen approved, sees consent to fracture awarded.5 Hydraulic fracturing by shale gas exploration companies\nHydraulic fracturing does not have a fixed or commonly shared meaning. Fracking only comprises one\npart of the process of shale gas extraction, but this is not always how the term is used and variations in the\nuse of the term can account for miscommunications between stakeholders. The general meaning attached by\n3. E. Stokes `Regulating Nanotechnologies: Sizing up the Options' (2009) 29(2) Legal Studies 281; M.

However, outside the industry, the term is used to cover the whole process of shale gas extraction\nfrom the drilling of a wellbore to the underground injection and, even further, to the abandonment of the\nwell at the end of its life.7 The definition is crucial as a number of concerns associated with fracking are\nnot tied solely to the technical underground injection, but are related to other practices associated with\nextraction. It is only through looking at the process as a whole, from design through to abandonment, that\nthis article can effectively evaluate the control system currently in place. As such, the term fracking will be\nused to cover the entire process of exploration and utilisation unless otherwise stated.\nKey issues with fracking\nFracking has enabled the exploitation of previously inaccessible gas resources, giving rise to a boom in US\nshale gas production and a fall in gas prices. Although a corresponding fall in prices here in England/the UK\nis unlikely,8 the potential tax revenue and increased security of supply are proving to be driving factors in\ngovernment policy. However, concerns surrounding fracking have been raised and these have both environ-\nmental and health implications. At present, public opposition to fracking poses a potentially significant bar-\nrier to the development of a UK shale gas industry.9 The absence of social acceptance or approval of\nfracking in turn means the absence of a social licence to operate. Following the anti-fracking protests at the\nexploration site in Balcombe in the summer of 2013, there has been a noticeably negative impact on public\nperceptions of shale gas.10 A detailed examination of the role of a social licence to operate is beyond the scope\nof this article and as such will not be discussed in detail here. Notably, however, in many ways the concerns\nexpressed are not new and mirror concerns with other energy sources, both traditional and renewable.\nWater. One of the prime concerns with fracking, for the environment and public health, is its potential link to\nwater contamination. There are a number of facets to this concern. The first is the risk of migration into\ngroundwater of pollutants within the fracturing fluid, potentially polluting natural substances and methane\ngases through the fractures created. Due to the height to which fractures extend and the low porosity of shale\nin the absence of pressure conditions (that is, fracking), contamination through these methods is considered\nunlikely.11 Additional concerns which may have more of a scientific basis surround the migration of gas\nreleased during fracking, fracking fluids and polluting natural substances due to inadequate well integrity,\nand the impact of surface spills.12 Finally, there are concerns over the volume of water used during fracking.\nAt present the recycling of water is not common practice (this may change if production begins)13 and the\n7.

Pollution concerns are not confined to water impacts, but also extend to the effect fracking sites\nwill have on air quality. Emissions from machinery and gaseous escape from flaring raise issues for local air\nquality and the effects on the local environment/health from exposure. In addition, fracking brings into\nquestion wider issues relating to whether exploiting more fossil fuel is compatible with the UK's binding\nclimate change targets.15\nSeismic activity. Another concern, especially after the tremors near Blackpool in 2011, is the risk of seismic\nactivity, particularly in areas where natural geological faults lie. Fracking at this exploration site saw a num-\nber of seismic events with a maximum magnitude of 2.3M, and triggered a temporary moratorium on frack-\nCurrent regulation17\nReports, such as those conducted by the Royal Society and Public Health England, have expressed the\nopinion that if a `robust' regulatory system is in place the risks associated with fracking can be reduced\nand controlled. Such claims have been repeated by political figures.18 The next section discusses whether\nthe assumption that a `robust' regulatory system exists in England is justified by examining whether cur-\nrent controls effectively translate and map onto the operation of a new technology and industry in\nEngland.\nThe government insists that current regulation for conventional oil and gas extraction is adequate to con-\ntrol fracking.19 However, these controls were designed pre-fracking and, as will be discussed, whilst current\noil and gas regulations do not fail to offer any relevant controls, their application leaves a number of gaps\nwhich may risk harm to human health and/or damage to the environment. The emergence of such gaps is not\nsurprising and has been seen in the regulation of other novel and new technologies.20 In addition, the lack of\n14.

Evidence of the inade-\nquacy of a borrowed regulatory regime has already become apparent. Prior to the occurrence of seismic\ntremors near Blackpool in 2011 there were no seismic controls in England. Although DECC has now imple-\nmented regulation following a short suspension of fracking, this was only done in response to the materi-\nalisation of the risk (i.e. the earthquake).23\nWith similar uncertainty surrounding other environmental risks associated with fracking, there is con-\ncern that such a reactive approach will provide little consolation if damage to health or to the environment\nhas already occurred. The key question surrounding the concerns on shale gas exploration and fracking at\nthis early stage must be: how far do these risks and uncertainties coincide with the current regulatory gaps?\nEnvironmental and health consequences must also be considered. What has happened so far with fracking\nmirrors a number of other narratives in EU and UK environmental regulations where specific, targeted\ncontrols have been imposed after the event, not before.24\nThe European Commission has recently published a Recommendation setting out the minimum princi-\nples for the exploration of oil and gas using fracking.25 Although the recognition that current EU regulation\nfails to comprehensively cover fracking operations is welcome, Member States are only encouraged to\napply the non-binding suggestions. This fails to guarantee that the problem areas are addressed. As such,\nthis article focuses on the existing enforceable regulatory controls on shale gas exploration under EU and\nEnglish law whilst considering how the recent EU Recommendation impacts on their operation. The fol-\nlowing section examines the use of conventional oil and gas regulation in the context of fracking and the\naffect this has had on the regulatory protection offered.\nRegulatory mismatch\nCurrent conventional oil and gas regulation fails to translate into adequate controls for the shale gas industry\nand fracking leading to a regulatory mismatch and uncertainty over if and how regulations apply. Regula-\ntion is dependent on existing controls in a wide number of sectors and media: laws on waste, water quality,\nair quality, environmental impacts and liability, chemical controls, noise emissions, planning and\n22.

The current regime is not conducive to clarity and consistency. The following section\ndiscusses this mis-match in further detail.\nWater. The emergence of regulatory gaps is clearly evident when the controls on fracking and water are\nexamined. There is no guarantee that a borehole passing through groundwater will require a permit under\nthe Environmental Permitting Regulation.26 This is due to the fact that many chemicals used in drilling\nmuds27 and fracturing fluids are categorised as non-pollutants (pollutants being defined as any substance\nliable to cause pollution, in particular those listed in Annex VIII of the Water Framework Directive\n(WFD)).28 This means that their direct injection into groundwater is not controlled, despite the fact this may\nultimately impact on groundwater quality and aquifers. In addition, with many of the chemicals used in\nfracking only assumed to be non-hazardous based on current information, there is a risk that inadequate\ncontrols will be applied as such chemicals do not currently fall under the hazardous or priority substances\nlisted under the WFD.29\nFailure in regulatory translation is again apparent due to the present lack of control on water abstrac-\ntion.30 These controls limit the amount of groundwater an operator can extract for industrial purposes. Such\ncontrols are, however, rendered ineffective due to the current sourcing of water supplies from local utility\noperators. Water supply moves beyond legislative controls, becoming an issue of utility provider policy on\nwater allocation and priority.\nChemicals. As detailed above, the chemicals used in fracking are not necessarily regulated via a ground-\nwater permit. Nor are they effectively regulated via dedicated chemicals regulation. REACH, the regu-\nlation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, is the EU flagship regime\nfor chemicals risk assessment and management. As downstream users (that is, users of chemicals in an\nindustrial process), registration of new usages of chemicals is key in ensuring appropriate risk manage-\nment and exposure scenarios are considered. Despite the `new use' of chemicals during fracking, an\nassessment of registration dossiers found that neither hydraulic fracturing nor shale gas were explicitly\nmentioned.31 In addition, the current description system for chemical use does not provide a suitable cate-\ngory to describe the use of chemicals in fracking. Compounding these gaps is the fact that none of the\ninvestigated dossiers explicitly quantified potential releases into the environment and associated environ-\nmental exposure. Where they did, it was in relation to marine surface waters which are not relevant to\nEnglish onshore fracking.32 There is a clear need for alteration of the controls/descriptors available. With-\nout such alteration the controls offered by REACH will not operate effectively. The recent EU recommen-\ndation emphasises that registration of chemicals used in fracking is required to comply with REACH\npollution and deterioration; The Environmental Permitting Regulations 2010 (SI 2010 No. 675); The Water Environment (Water\n27.

The classification of fracking fluids and drilling muds as non-hazardous is based on assumptions\nfrom current information. This is of particular concern when the controls offered by the Mining Waste\nDirective (MWD) are considered.34 The MWD should govern the way in which waste from fracking oper-\nations is dealt with. However, it is not clear whether fracturing fluids that remain underground whilst the\nsite is still active will be discarded for the purposes of the directive. As such they may only be subject to\ndirective controls when operations at the site are suspended or wells abandoned.\nRegulatory mis-match is once again visible when the supposed role of Best Available Techniques\n(BATs)/Best Available Techniques Reference Documents (BREFs) under the Industrial Emissions\nDirective (IED) is considered.35 Such documents are used to improve industrial practices and avoid/\nreduce emissions and the impact of installations on the environment. However, with uncertainty as to\nwhether the IED applies to fracking, and with no such BREF documents existing for the treatment of\nfracking waste or for drilling equipment (even if the IED is applicable), their role in controlling opera-\ntions is redundant. The EU Recommendation emphasises that risk assessment should be based on BAT\nand BREF, but does nothing to fill the gap where no such documents exist. Notably, as part of the policy ini-\ntiative, the Commission has pledged to review the BREF on extractive waste in light of fracking operations\n(although this is not contained in the Recommendation).36 In addition, as a result of fracking waste, some shale\ngas operators are likely to classify their sites as mining waste facilities.37 Facility categorisation affects the\nrelevant prevention and emergency plans in place; with uncertainties over the classification of Category A\nwaste facilities there is a risk of inadequate waste controls and safeguards if the appropriate category is not\napplied.\nEmissions. There is uncertainty over whether the IED will apply (shale gas and fracking are not mentioned\nand do not necessarily qualify under hazardous waste/combustion capacity criteria).38 This brings into ques-\ntion whether a permit under the IED will be necessary.39 If no permit is needed, monitoring requirements of\nemissions to air, water and land, including measures concerning waste, may not be applied. The impact on\nlocal air quality is also compounded by the absence of emission limits for non-road mobile machinery above\nprevention and control).\n36.

The imposition of inappropriate thresholds is another problem which has previously\nbeen an issue in relation to other novel and new technologies.41 This section focuses on current EU and\nEnglish legislation whilst planning controls will be discussed further in the subsequent section.\nWhen looking at controls on safety, Seveso II (which requires operators handling dangerous substances\nto have a major accident prevention policy) is unlikely to apply as the storage of hydrocarbon products fails\nto reach the relevant threshold.42\nThe unsuitability of these thresholds can also be seen under the Environmental Impact Assessment\n(EIA) Directive, which was created to ensure that projects likely to have a significant impact on the envi-\nronment are subject to environmental assessment prior to development. However, exploratory sites can\nfall short of the national threshold (i.e. 1 hectare or the extraction of more than 500,000 cubic meters of\ngas per day), meaning that assessment is discretionary rather than mandatory.43 With the assessment of\nhealth impacts by the Health Protection Authority only undertaken after an approach by a Local Authority\nor as part of the EIA process, the absence of an EIA has clear implications for the environment and\nhealth.44 Whilst the EU recommendation emphasises the need for an EIA, its retention of the directive\nas the basis for requiring such an assessment means that inappropriate mandatory EIA thresholds are not\naltered.\nThe absence of any provision for automatic remediation of any environmental damage is also proble-\nmatic. The EU Environmental Liability Directive (ELD), operating on the `polluter pays' principle, imposes\nstrict liability for activities classed as dangerous and listed under Annex III.45 At present, shale gas oper-\nations are not included, meaning that fault or negligence is required to attribute liability for environmental\ndamage. In the United States, it has been extremely difficult to assign responsibility for claimed environ-\nmental damage from fracking operations. The fault/negligence burden in England looks set to be a signif-\nicant hurdle to remediation if environmental damage does occur.46\nWhen discussing thresholds, it is not possible to ignore the implications of UK climate change targets.\nWhilst it is not the purpose of this article to engage in wider debates as to the merits of extracting shale\ngas, in considering the fit of regulatory controls, if a large-scale industry is to develop here in England, the\nHaving examined the current regulation on shale gas and fracking, it is clear that the inherent problem\nlies in the fact that old regulations are being used to govern a new technology. This results in inappropriate\nthresholds, the failure of controls to apply (or lack of clarity as to whether they apply) and the absence of\nrequired guidance documents such as BREFs. Clearly, the existing controls offer some regulatory protec-\ntion, but that should not obscure the fact that there are gaps in the present system.\n41.

Dillard `Analysis of Litigation Involving Shale and Hydraulic Fracturing: Part 1' (2013) International\nEnergy Law Review 50.\nLack of English experience\nThe number of authorities involved and lack of English experience in regulating fracking is of significance.\nAlthough the presence of multiple regulators can provide a system of checks and balances, it can also\nexacerbate the risk of regulatory gaps.48\nThis is a point of particular concern in England. The authorities involved in regulating fracking range\nfrom the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) through to the Local Mineral Authority\n(LA/usually the County Council), the Environment Agency (EA) and the Health and Safety Executive\n(HSE). Broadly, DECC is responsible for the initial licence grant (Petroleum Exploration and Development\nLicence/PEDL), for approval of the hydraulic fracturing plan and agreed method for monitoring induced\nseismicity, consent to drill, consent to fracture and consent for an extended well test. The LA takes respon-\nsibility for screening and defining the scope of an EIA (if applicable), determining the planning application\nand planning conditions. The EA controls the environmental permits which fracking operations may\nrequire, whilst the HSE takes responsibility for well design, integrity and operational safety. In reality\nhowever, many of these aspects overlap.\nOne of the key issues stemming from the current structure is regulators' lack of relevant experience and\nknowledge. This is of particular significance to LAs whose general planning experience ill-equips them to\ndeal with fracking applications. The role of LAs is further questioned by the community incentive scheme\nand Council retention of 100 % of business rates from exploration sites and through their role in the EIA\nprocess.49 The self-scoping of EIA issues by operators, combined with the LAs' limited experience in deal-\ning with shale gas operations, risks important issues being excluded from consideration.\nAlthough the above issues are of particular relevance to LAs, it must be noted that planning applications\nare also subject to consultation both by statutory (e.g. the EA) and non-statutory/relevant consultees as well\nas the public. Accordingly, other bodies with relevant knowledge and experience are involved in the plan-\nning process. Bodies involved in regulation beyond the planning system also have significant knowledge of\nand experience in related industries. In particular, the EA and HSE both have considerable experience in the\nconventional oil and gas sector, with the HSE having a long history of regulating well integrity and design.\nFor both bodies involved in the planning and further regulatory stages, this experience and knowledge is of\ngreat value, but it must be noted that, like the regulation, it cannot simply be transposed. This is evidenced\nby recent calls from Public Health England (PHE) for further research into agencies' analytical capacities.50\nIn light of the current cut-backs, in many regulatory agencies the capacity of regulators to monitor the indus-\ntry is questionable. Lack of English expertise and understanding is a two-pronged issue: first, the authori-\nties' technical capacity to adequately control the industry; and second, the authorities' resources to ensure\nthat controls are implemented and enforced. These issues have been seen previously in other environmental\nregimes such as that of contaminated land.51\nDespite the absence of regulations specific to shale gas, planning guidance tailored to onshore oil and gas\nexploration has been issued.52 Although aimed at ensuring clarity in the area, the document does add a\n48.

The guidance, whilst not\nreplacing the LAs' judgement, is provided as a specific and detailed guidance tool on the relevant consid-\nerations and requirements for those dealing with unconventional exploration applications. There are indi-\nvidual issues within the guidance itself, as discussed below, but these are compounded by the presumption\nthat when granting planning permission `all other regulatory controls are to be considered fully functional\nand effective'.53 As has been shown, there are clear gaps in the current regulation; such an assumption\nintensifies the risk of damage from regulatory inadequacies.\nThe planning guidance states that cumulative impacts are unlikely to be a consideration at the explora-\ntion stage regardless of how close well pads are. This is despite the National Planning Policy Framework\nreferring to the relevance of cumulative impacts in assessing whether a development is appropriate to its\nlocation and in the public interest.54 This means that fracking impacts are segmented. Separating such\naspects imposes an artificial distinction and ignores the full implication of the potential for environmental\ndamage at the exploration stage, particularly when deficiencies in the regulation are ignored.\nThe planning guidance stresses the importance of mineral extraction for both local and national econo-\nmies as a relevant planning consideration. However potential future activities and alternative energy devel-\nopments in the area are not relevant.55 This emphasis on the economic value of shale gas is likely to be\nchallenged in the context of conservation during appropriate assessments. A project can only be authorised\nin a protected habitat if the authority has made certain there will be no adverse effects on a protected site.\nHowever, the question of how easily exemptions allowing development for imperative reasons of over-\nriding public interest (IROPI) will be invoked on an economic basis remains.56 This tension will be of even\ngreater concern should clause 58 of the Draft Deregulation Bill come into force. This emphasises the need to\nconsider the desirability of promoting economic growth when exercising regulatory functions.57 Such eco-\nnomic considerations raise questions as to how the EU requirement to avoid conflict between regulators'\n`regulatory' functions and their function relating to economic development of resources is to be met.58\nEconomic implications also extend to English landowners. Whilst section 106 agreements between\noperators and LAs can be used to impose planning obligations to cover the remediation of sites, the planning\nguidance highlights the imposition on landowners of a duty to restore the site if the operator defaults.59 This\nsuggests that the area is open to legal uncertainty and that a lack of precedent could have extreme and\nunforeseen consequences.\nAlthough a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has now been conducted for the fourteenth\nonshore licensing round (consultation ended on 28 March 2014),60 which compels a more holistic approach\nto risks, this has been conducted under several problematic assumptions.

Some (e.g. France) have a moratorium in place and others (e.g. the UK) have actively encour-\naged the technology. The development of shared best practices and accident prevention is likely to face sig-\nnificant hurdles, meaning that any improvements based on EU industry experience will be neither\nstraightforward nor prompt.63\nAlthough the United Kingdom Onshore Operators Group (UKOOG) has issued best practice guidance\nfor shale gas operators, it remains voluntary. Relevant legislation and regulatory requirements are collated\nin the guidance, as are references to other relevant oil and gas guidelines (e.g. the Well Integrity Guidelines)\nand industry best practices from the conventional sector. Monitoring and transparency within the industry\nare encouraged (including the public disclosure of fracturing fluids), but without enforceability mechanisms\nand supporting legislation many guidance provisions still fail to guarantee adequate environmental and\nhealth protection.64\nAt present, the uncertainty in relation to fracking controls extends beyond technical regulation and into\npractical application and enforcement. Such a combination is problematic and highlights that the regulatory\nsystem will not remove the current gaps and uncertainties unless the issue of authority experience, expertise\nand resources is also addressed.\nThe need for regulatory change\nWith uncertainty as to application and potential for gaps in the controls, the question that must be addressed\nis: what now for the regulation of shale gas and fracking? The objective of fracking regulation (leaving aside\nquestions of whether England should develop a new fossil fuel industry) is to ensure that the exploration for\nshale gas can proceed in a manner which also protects the environment and public health. Under the current\nregulatory system, the uncertainty and risk associated with fracking is not justifiable. The very way in which\nthe risks have been assessed assumes that a `robust' regulatory system will be in place; this has fed the justi-\nfication for significant instances of regulatory inaction.65 Clearly the current regulation is not `robust', and the\nframing of such risks as `low' based on this assumption highlights the deficiencies in this cyclic determination.\nAs this article has shown, there are a number of risks associated with fracking and a number of uncer-\ntainties as to its impact in England. These correspond with evident gaps and uncertainties within the current\nregulation and the current regulatory approach risks a non-uniform application of uncertain regulations.\nMaintenance of the current approach is beneficial in that it requires minimal effort and expenditure, whilst\nallowing the shale gas industry to develop. However, it risks allowing regulatory gaps to remain until prob-\nlems materialise.\nas flowback, between 14\u00ad51 vehicle movements a day during stages 2\u00ad3 and assumed production of 3 billion cubic feet of gas per\nwell (over lifetime assumed to be 20 years).\nProgramme to 2020 `Living well, within the limits of our planet'.\n64.

See Public Health England, above, n. 18 at iii; See Royal Society, above, n. 11 at 4.\nFracking remains unpredictable in the English context. First, in relation to the natural environment\nthere are a number of unknowns in geological terms (e.g. pathways and receptors for pollution and envi-\nronmental damage). Second, there are unknowns relating to human behaviour and practices (e.g. the way\nin which operators will act, particularly in light of the lack of English experience and understanding of\nshale gas activities). Fracking must be recognised and regulated as a new and uncertain technology.\nWhat next?\nGuidance. There are some arguments in favour of the introduction of guidance on fracking both to avoid reg-\nulatory reform and to allow this new technology and industry to develop.66 This argument is not without\nmerit; however, the assertion that current provisions provide `proper environmental safeguards' and are\nwell understood by businesses is highly questionable.67 A vast number of regulations apply and misunder-\nstandings surrounding their application have already materialised.68 Whilst guidance on the applicability of\nthe current provisions would be useful, this does not resolve the problem of the gaps in the current regula-\ntion. Once these have been addressed, the value of guidance will be significantly increased. At present, how-\never, it is of limited value. This is exemplified by the current EU Recommendation, which encourages\nuseful processes such as baseline monitoring and public dissemination of information. However, in relation\nto areas such as environmental impact assessment and chemical registration, the current EU guidance, even\nif legally enforceable, still leaves regulatory gaps and uncertainties.\nAlteration of current provisions. An alternative would be to conduct a piecemeal reform of current regulations.\nSuch action fails to address the fundamental problem that controls from one system are failing to translate to\nanother system and its technology. Altering the current controls would not address this issue and would sup-\nport the misplaced idea that they are sufficient to control new technologies. Such a piecemeal reform poses\nthe potential for clashes in controls and a distinct lack of clarity meaning that, in practice, gaps in the\nregulation would likely remain.\nA moratorium. Another available option would be to impose a temporary moratorium on fracking. A mor-\natorium on shale gas extraction is not a new concept in England (as seen following the seismic events in\n2011).69 Further use of a response that allows the materialisation of damage prior to regulatory action\nshould not be adopted.\nHowever, a moratorium could be used to halt activities in England until further information on the risks\nand uncertainties associated with fracking becomes available based on operational experience in other\ncountries. Nonetheless, information from other jurisdictions with different geological, social and regulatory\nconditions may prove to be of limited value.\nPrecaution and regulatory reform. The remaining, preferred option, is the development of precautionary reg-\nulation for fracking. To develop this, a temporary moratorium must be imposed. This would address the\n66.

As precaution is a complex and disputed term the precise\napproach needed is something beyond the scope of this article. Further research is required.70\nThere are too many regulatory gaps and uncertainties in the current legislation relating to fracking. Under\nsuch a system environmental and health risks are self-evident, but could be avoided by the imposition of a\ntemporary moratorium until these issues can be addressed. Despite recognition at EU level of the need and\nvalue of precautionary measures, these have not been adopted.71 The need for English operational informa-\ntion requires exploratory activity; this will inevitably be delayed by a temporary moratorium and the imple-\nmentation of precautionary measures. This carries the risk of economic disadvantage and slower industry\ndevelopment, as well as delaying any potential benefits from shale gas.72 However, there is a need to ensure\nthat during the exploration and development stage, current risks and uncertainties are not left open.73 A pre-\ncautionary approach would not prevent future industry development and would allow for later review of the\nregulation, and amendment if necessary, once uncertainty in the English context is reduced (through the\nproduction of operational information without unnecessary risk to the environment and health).\nEnsuring that strong precautionary regulation is in place would also permit regulators to develop relevant\nexperience and knowledge, whilst simultaneously protecting both the environment and public health. This\nis crucial to ensuring that regulation is effectively applied in practice.\nCurrent law does not transpose neatly onto the new technology and industry it is trying to control. This\narticle does not attempt to propose the technical contents of any regulatory changes and, whilst there may\nnot be an immediately obvious and effective way to do this, until attention is drawn to the issue of regulatory\ninadequacy and it is given serious consideration a mismatch of regulatory uncertainty and gaps will\nremain.74 Notably, the use of current industry best practice guidance could prove useful at this stage in help-\ning to design enforceable precautionary regulation.\nThese issues are not unique to fracking. Despite the problems with allowing new technologies such as\ngenetically modified organisms and nano-technology to proceed in a manner where regulation is constantly\ncatching up,75 fracking indicates that little has been learnt from the historically problematic relationship\nbetween new technologies, the law and environmental and health protection.\nConclusion\nExploration for shale gas in England has sparked significant debate, yet little of this has focused in any detail\non the control afforded by current regulation. There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with\nfracking accompanied by a number of corresponding gaps and uncertainties in the regulation. Whilst the\npresent regulatory systems offers a base of controls built upon conventional oil and gas experience, its suit-\nability is limited. The inability to transpose one set of regulations from an existing context into a new con-\ntext is apparent. At present gaps emerge as a result of a lack of coherence and uncertainty surrounding the\napplicability of regulations as well as through the application of inappropriate thresholds. These are com-\npounded by the lack of regulatory expertise and experience and the questionable capacity of regulatory\n70. E.

Maintenance of the current approach and controls will leave areas\nexposed to potential environmental and health damage.\nAt present, the framing of shale gas and fracking activities as low risk is based on the assumption that a\nrobust regulatory system is in place.76 This article has shown that this is not the case and that regulatory\nchange is needed. Such a change requires recognition of the fact that the current regulation does not fit the\ntechnology and processes it is trying to control. Until this fact is acknowledged and addressed, the regula-\ntion governing fracking will continue to be inadequate.\nA number of options exist in relation to the reform of fracking regulation, including the piecemeal reform\nof current provisions or the production of guidance. The difficulty with such reforms is that they fail to\nacknowledge the problems raised by trying to map old regulations onto a new technology. The alternative\noption \u00ad a temporary moratorium until further information on fracking in other jurisdictions is available \u00ad is\nof limited value due to the context-specific generation of this information. At present, the state of the reg-\nulation suggests the need for a temporary moratorium which utilises the time to examine the current regu-\nlation in detail and engages with the notion that gaps and uncertainties are apparent. This would ensure that\nthe regulatory gaps highlighted in this article are filled and that the operation of the new technology of frack-\ning in England is conducted under a precautionary regime enabling context-specific data to be generated.\nThis, in turn, would reduce uncertainty surrounding fracking and help to minimise damage to the environ-\nment and to public health.\n"
