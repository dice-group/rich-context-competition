This includes the introduction of prudential instruments that\ntarget the stability of the financial system as a whole. In integrated banking markets, banks\ncan respond to changes in prudential regulation in one country by shifting their activities\nbetween countries. This can weaken the effectiveness of national prudential instruments and\ncreate cross-border spillovers. Thus, we ask how prudential policies implemented in domestic\nand foreign markets affect German banks' local and global lending behavior.\nContribution\nWe use detailed micro-level data on banks' international activities including information on\nGerman banks' foreign branches and subsidiaries. We merge this data with a novel cross-\ncountry dataset on prudential measures. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to study\nhow regulatory changes affect German banks' domestic and international lending decisions.\nOur results are used in a cross-country analysis of the International Banking Research\nNetwork (IBRN).

However, the results are\nheterogeneous depending on the direction of spillovers, the type of banks and prudential\ninstruments. For example, we find that German banks increase their domestic loan supply as a\nresponse to stricter regulation in countries in which they maintain international activities. In\ncontrast, foreign banks located in Germany reduce their loan supply in Germany if regulation\nin their home country tightens. This suggests that no general policy conclusions can be drawn\nbut recommends a case-wise analysis when evaluating cross-border spillovers of prudential\nregulation.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nFragestellung\nAls Antwort auf die letzte Finanzkrise wurden zahlreiche regulatorische \u00c4nderungen im\nFinanzsystem eingef\u00fchrt.

Introduction\nIn response to the recent financial crisis, numerous and substantial changes have been made\nto the architecture of the financial system. One key objective is to maintain financial stability\nby widening the focus of regulation from individual banks to the stability of the financial\nsystem as a whole. Prudential instruments can help in achieving this objective. The\neffectiveness of these instruments for financial stability hinges however on the absence of\nunintended leakages and spillovers. In integrated financial markets, such as in the German\ncase, this might be a challenge given that banks can circumvent prudential regulation by\nadapting their global activities.\nIn this paper, we analyze how prudential policies implemented in domestic and foreign\nmarkets affect German banks' local and global lending behavior. Our study relates to the\ncurrent policy debate on cross-border effects of regulatory policies and reciprocation. For\ninstance, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which is the European macroprudential\nauthority, has recently issued recommendations which call for an annual assessment of cross-\nborder effects of national macroprudential measures (ESRB 2015). We use detailed micro-\nlevel data on German banks to study regulatory spillovers across borders in three different\ndimensions; inward transmission of foreign regulation into Germany due to international\nactivities of German banks, inward transmission through foreign affiliates located in\nGermany, and outward transmission to foreign countries through foreign lending of German\nbanks and their affiliates.\nThis analysis is part of the International Banking Research Network (IBRN) project on cross-\nborder regulatory spillovers and follows the methodology described in Buch and Goldberg\n(2016).2 The IBRN is a network of several national central banks (NCBs), the Bank for\nInternational Settlements (BIS), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International\nMonetary Fund (IMF) which seeks to analyze questions regarding global banks' activities.3\nThe key advantage of the IBRN is the access to NCBs' high-quality micro-level data\ncombined with the use of up-to date empirical methods and the availability of expert\nknowledge on the characteristics of national banking systems. The IBRN's work thus yields,\nfirst, relevant results from single-country studies based on a common methodology and\nperformed by the country teams within the network (a list of the other country studies on\n2 Following Buch and Goldberg (2016), the term spillovers is used to analyze whether changes in regulation in\none country affect banks' decisions in another country. We do not make explicit statements about regulatory\narbitrage or about the welfare effects of spillovers.\n3 For more information on the IBRN please see https://www.newyorkfed.org/IBRN/index.html.\nregulatory spillovers can be found at the end of the references section). Second, these\ncountry-specific results can be compared and analyzed in a meta-analysis. For example,\nanother IBRN project focused on the transmission of liquidity risk through banks'\ninternational exposures; a summary of the results can be found in Buch and Goldberg (2015).\nThe issue of regulatory spillovers through global banks is analyzed by various country teams;\nthis study looks at the German perspective. We use the Deutsche Bundesbank's External\nPosition Report, which gives us detailed micro-level information on German banks'\ninternational activities. Data on changes in prudential policies is obtained from the IBRN.\nThe newly established database on \"IBRN Prudential Instruments Database\" includes\ninformation on prudential instruments, e.g. reserve requirements or concentration limits, for\nthat regulatory changes are likely to interact with economic conditions, we control for the\nbusiness and financial cycles using data provided by the BIS.\nThe German case is interesting because of the high degree of international activity of German\nbanks. We analyze international lending growth of German-owned banks to 52 foreign\ncountries. These foreign claims amount to 33% of total claims of German banks. Also,\nGermany hosts 72 affiliates of foreign banks which hold 9% of all German claims. From a\nGerman policy perspective, it is important to understand whether and how these foreign-\nowned banks transmit regulatory changes from their home country into the German market.\nFinally, German banks enter foreign markets not only through cross-border lending but also\nthrough both, foreign branches and foreign subsidiaries. Besides following the common\nIBRN methodology, our data allow us to test whether foreign branches and subsidiaries\nbehave differentially to changes in regulation.\nWhile our results provide evidence for international spillovers of prudential instruments, we\ndocument that these spillovers are heterogeneous between types of instruments and types of\nbanks. First, analyzing the inward transmission of regulatory changes abroad due to foreign\nexposures of German banks, we find for the average bank that domestic lending growth\nincreases if foreign regulation tightens. This holds specifically for a tightening in capital\nrequirements and loan to value ratios.\nSecond, foreign-owned affiliates located in Germany contract their lending growth in\nGermany in response to a policy tightening in their home country. This finding is surprising\nas one might expect that foreign-owned banks respond to stricter regulation in their home\ncountry by increasing lending activities of their foreign affiliates that are not subject to the\nregulation. However, regulatory pressure can have indirect effects on foreign affiliates\nlocated in Germany if their parent bank draws resources from them in order to fulfill tighter\nrequirements in the home country. While there is a substantial heterogeneity between\ndifferent types of foreign-owned banks, the impact of bank characteristics depends on the\nregulatory instrument. Overall, the retrenchment from the German lending market is less\npronounced for larger banks that are better capitalized and with a higher ratio of illiquid\nassets to total assets.\nThird, for the outward transmission exercise, we find evidence that international lending\ngrowth by German banks is negatively affected by stricter regulation in the destination\ncountry. However, for most prudential instruments we only find short-run effects that vanish\nafter one quarter. Only in the case of local reserve requirements, we find that a tightening in\nthis instrument significantly reduces loan growth over a longer time horizon. This suggests\nthat reserve requirements, which have been used mainly by emerging markets in our sample,\nhave been successful in controlling capital inflows from German banks.\nFurthermore, we study whether foreign branches and subsidiaries of German banks differ in\ntheir responses to changes in the prudential regulation in their host country. Institution-based\nregulation in the host country usually applies to foreign subsidiaries, while foreign branches\nare subject to home country regulation. These differences in the treatment of branches\ncompared to subsidiaries in the host country may facilitate regulatory leakages. Our results\nsuggests that foreign subsidiaries are constrained by host country regulation as they reduce\nlending growth after a tightening in the host country prudential index (as well as in sector-\nspecific capital buffers, loan-to-value-ratios and foreign reserve requirements). Foreign\nbranches, however, do not change their lending growth significantly after a change in host\ncountry regulation (except for a negative effect of concentration ratios and a positive\ncontemporaneous effect of the prudential index). In contrast to foreign subsidiaries, marginal\neffects of a tightening in prudential instruments are positive in the foreign branch sub-sample,\nbut they lack significance.\nFinally, we find that business and financial cycles matter for lending decisions. For example,\nforeign-owned banks located in Germany increase lending growth when the financial cycle in\ntheir home country undergoes an upturn. Similarly, German banks increase lending growth to\ndestination countries which experience an upturn in the financial and business cycles. This\nprocyclicality to destination country cycles, however, cannot be found for loan growth by\nGerman banks' foreign affiliates that are hosted in these countries.\nOur study adds to research on the pattern of German banks' international activities and cross-\nborder spillovers. Buch et al. (2014), for example, find that more productive German banks\nare more likely to maintain cross-border activities. In contrast, the propensity to maintain\ncross-border loans decreases with risk aversion (D\u00fcwel et al. 2011). Besides productivity and\nrisk aversion, bank size matters. While a large percentage of German banks are active abroad,\nonly large banks maintain foreign affiliates (Buch et al. 2011a). We include a set of bank\ncontrol variables based on this literature.\nThe recent financial crisis has affected banks' international activities.4 Banks have withdrawn\nfrom international markets, with one reason being changes in funding conditions or\ngovernment interventions (Buch et al. 2013, Kerl and Koch 2015). Internal capital markets\nhave been one tool to stabilize foreign affiliates' lending activities after the crisis depending\non parent banks' characteristics (Frey and Kerl 2015). Regarding international spillovers,\nBuch et al. (2011b) look at the effect of rescue measures implemented in response to the\nrecent financial crisis in the US and Germany and find evidence of spillover effects through\nforeign affiliates.\nOur paper sets itself apart from these studies by focusing on the effects of changes in\nprudential regulation on German banks' (international) lending activity. We address this issue\nby exploiting a novel dataset on regulatory changes obtained from Cerutti et al. (2015),\nthereby contributing to a relatively new strand of the literature (e.g. Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2012,\nAiyar et al. 2014). However, studies that evaluate the use and effectiveness of prudential\ninstruments are mostly based on country-level data (IMF 2011, Claessens et al. 2013). Cerutti\net al. (2016) study the outcome of a new survey on prudential instruments conducted by the\nIMF. They find that these instruments tend to be used more in emerging market economies,\nthat their use is linked to the state of the credit and housing markets, and, importantly, that\nthere is evidence for avoidance of these policies by relying more on cross-border borrowing.\nEvidence at the micro level is scarce and often limited to domestic markets or single\ninstruments (Jim\u00e9nez et al. 2012, Aiyar et al. 2014). Overall, we find a withdrawal from\nforeign markets when regulation in the home or foreign market tightens.\n4 For studies on the transmission of shocks through international banks, see, for example, Cetorelli and Goldberg\n(2011). Bremus and Fratzscher (2015) look at the factors that caused changes in the structure of cross-border\ncapital flows after the recent crisis.\nThe paper is structured as follows. The following part describes the data and stylized facts\nregarding international activities of German banks. The third part presents regression results\nfor the analysis of inward and outward transmission of prudential instruments. In addition to\nthe common methodology, we analyze whether adjustments differ for foreign branches and\nsubsidiaries of German banks. The final part concludes the paper.\n2. Data and Stylized Facts for Germany\nWe use confidential data collected by the Deutsche Bundesbank for the Monthly Balance\nData is available for (i) all banks located in Germany, including foreign-owned subsidiaries,\nand (ii) German banks' branches and subsidiaries operating abroad. Data on German banks'\ninternational activities by destination country is obtained from the Deutsche Bundesbank's\nExternal Position Report. The analysis is conducted at quarterly frequency in order to match\nthe frequency of the regulatory dataset. To aggregate monthly data to quarterly frequency, we\nuse quarter-end values.\nDependent variables\nFor the dependent variable, we use the change in log loans multiplied by 100. In the baseline\nspecification, we use total loans; in robustness tests, we exploit the sectoral breakdown and\nanalyze the effect on loans to banks, non-bank private sector, and the public sector separately.\nFor the inward transmission exercise, we refer to total domestic loans as provided by the\nmonthly balance sheet statistics. This data is available for domestic (German) banks and\nforeign affiliates located in Germany. 6 For the latter, we can identify the country of the\nparent bank. For the outward transmission exercise, we make use of data from the External\nPosition Report. All German banks, including their foreign affiliates (branches and\nsubsidiaries), are required to report foreign asset positions, broken down by destination\ncountry. While foreign subsidiaries of German banks have to report their foreign claims\n5 For more information on the Deutsche Bundesbank's Monthly Balance Sheet Statistics of banks please see\nhttps://www.bundesbank.de/Redaktion/EN/Standardartikel/Service/Reporting_systems/monthly_balance_sh\neet_statistics.html?https=1\n6 Please note that foreign affiliates located in Germany are not included in the outward transmission exercise due\nto data restrictions. In the inward transmission exercise, these banks are only included when specifically\nanalyzing inward transmission through foreign banks located in Germany. We can not differentiate between\nbranches and subsidiaries due to data limitations.\nindividually, foreign branches are aggregated for each German parent bank and host country.\n7 Our analysis includes the 52 largest destination countries (in terms of overall claims of the\nGerman banking system) and the 92 largest banks (plus their foreign affiliates) in terms of\nforeign assets. In this way, we cover more than 90% of the German banking system's total\nforeign loans as of December 2013. Our analysis focuses on the intensive margin, i.e. on\nlending growth, not on adjustments along the extensive margin. In order to reduce the cases\nof entries into and exits out of foreign markets in our dataset, we exclude small banks and\nless relevant destination countries. As a result, 84% of all bank-destination country\ncombinations exist in at least 75% of all quarters.\nRegarding the level of consolidation, we proceed as follows. When studying the lending\nresponses of German-owned banks, we use consolidated (parent plus foreign branch) data if a\nGerman bank owns foreign affiliates but include also banks that lend directly cross-border\nwithout having a foreign affiliate. This is the case for the inward transmission through\ninternational activities of German banks and the outward transmission exercise. This\nconsolidation choice accounts for the fact that parents and their foreign branches are often\nsubject to home country regulation, whereas subsidiaries are subject to host country\nregulation. We approximate consolidated exposures at the parent-foreign branch level by\nusing the unconsolidated positions of the parent and its foreign branches and a proxy for\nintrabank flows. This proxy has been used in previous studies with this data (Frey and Kerl\n2015). For the inward transmission specification through foreign affiliates located in\nGermany, we use unconsolidated data due to data constraints but control for internal capital\nmarket positions.\nTo account for outliers we drop observations where log changes of lending exceed 100% in\nabsolute terms. We keep only series for which at least two consecutive observations and at\nleast eight observations in total are available. Qualitatively, our main regression results are\nnot affected by the data cleaning. Summary statistics are provided in Table 1.\nBalance sheet characteristics\nThe balance sheet characteristics are taken from the monthly balance sheet statistics\n(BISTA). To clean the data, we drop observations for which the ratios described below are\nless than zero or greater than 100%.8 The balance sheet variables include the illiquid assets\n7 For a comprehensive description of the External Position Report, see Fiorentino et al. (2010).\n8 The variable capturing internal capital market positions can also be less than zero; we therefore drop values\nthat exceed 100% in absolute terms.\nratio, core deposits ratio, capital ratio, net intragroup funding ratio, log of total assets, and\ninternational activities ratio. Detailed information on the construction of these variables can\nbe found in Appendix Table 1. The balance sheet variables are defined as follows, with\ncorresponding summary statistics provided in Table 1:\n\u02c7\npercentage of a bank's portfolio of assets that is illiquid ,\n\u02c7\npercentage of a bank's balance sheet financed with core deposits\n( ,\n)\n\u02c7\npercentage of a bank's equity-to-asset ratio ( ,\n)\n\u02c7 percentage of a bank's net intragroup funding position of headquarters relative to total\nliabilities ( ,\n)\n\u02c7 log of total assets ( ,\n)\n\u02c7 percentage of a bank's foreign assets plus foreign liabilities relative to total assets plus\ntotal liabilities ( ,\n)\n2.2 Data on prudential instruments\nTo analyze spillovers of regulatory policies, this study draws on the \"IBRN Prudential\nInstruments Database\" developed by Cerutti et al. (2015) which provides quarterly\ninformation on changes in prudential instruments plus a composite index for more than 60\ncountries over the 2000-2014 period. The prudential variables provide information on\ntightening (coded by 1) and loosening (coded by -1) of a specific instrument in the specific\nquarter when the change came into effect, and zero otherwise. In this study, we focus on six\nout of seven instruments to study spillovers of prudential policies: general capital\nrequirements, sector-specific capital requirements, loan-to-value ratio limits, reserve\nrequirements (in local and foreign currency), concentration limits. We exclude interbank\nexposures limits from our analysis due to the small number of changes for this instrument in\nour sample (see Table 2).\nWe use this information in our analysis to control for individual changes in prudential\ninstruments in the home country of foreign banks located in Germany and in the destination\ncountry of lending by German banks. We are not analyzing the effects of regulatory changes\nin Germany on bank lending because we do not observe enough changes in regulatory\ninstruments in Germany over the sample period. Instead, we control for German regulation\nthrough time fixed effects. See Buch and Goldberg (2016) for more details on the\nconstruction of regulatory measures. The variables are defined as follows:\nRegulation weighted by foreign exposures (= all exposures of the banks outside the home\ncountry)\nExpP ,\n(where l = 0, 1, 2) = Foreign exposure-weighted regulation\nHome country regulation (home country = country of the foreign parent bank)\nHomeP,\n(where l = 0, 1, 2) = Home country regulation with 0, 1, and 2 lags\nDestination country regulation (destination country = country to which the loan goes)\nDestP,\n(where l = 0, 1, 2) = Destination country regulation with 0, 1, and 2 lags\nTable 2 provides summary statistics for changes in these instruments. We see that most\nchanges occur for reserve requirements on local and foreign currency deposits followed by\ncapital requirements. A tightening of standards occurred more often than a loosening.\nOur sample is rather dominated by advanced economies (60% of the underlying observations\nin the Inward A and Outward specification, 90% of the underlying observations in the Inward\nB specification). However, we observe relatively more regulatory changes in emerging\nmarket economies for the regulatory instruments that are significant in the regression\nanalysis. This holds particularly true for foreign and local reserve requirements.\n2.3 Data on the business and financial cycles\nThe second database focuses on macroeconomic conditions and was provided by the BIS. It\nallows us to control for the current state of the business (output gap) and financial (credit-to-\nGDP gap) cycles when assessing regulatory spillovers (BIS 2014, Drehmann et al. 2011).\nThis is important given that changes in regulation often take place in response to economic\nand financial conditions while their implementation might, in turn, affect economic\noutcomes. For example, Cerutti et al. (2016) analyze a new IMF database on prudential\nthese policies is linked to developments in credit and housing markets.\n[Fact 1: The degree of internationalization is heterogeneous across German banks.]\nA large percentage of German banks maintain international activities (Buch et al. 2011a).\nFigure 1 shows that German banks have recently increased their foreign loan supply relative\nto assets (lower left panel), whereas this cannot be observed for domestic lending (upper right\npanel). On average, German banks are net lenders regarding their intragroup positions (lower\nright panel). Hence, on average, they distribute liquidity to their foreign subsidiaries rather\nthan absorbing liquidity from them.\nThe size of international activities of German banks and thus presumably their potential to\ngenerate cross-border spillovers of regulation varies with the banks' business models:\nnotably, large German banks conduct a relatively high amount of their business abroad\n(Fiorentino et al. 2010). Table 3 shows correlations of banks' total, domestic, and foreign\nloan shares with balance sheet characteristics. Besides the relevance of bank size, it can be\nseen that German banks' capital and core deposits ratios correlate positively with the share of\ndomestic loans to assets, whereas this finding is less pronounced or even reversed for the\nshare of foreign loans to assets. We will therefore test whether banks' balance sheet\ncharacteristics affect their responses to regulatory changes abroad and at home (Section 3.1).\nHeterogeneity in international activities also comes into play if we look at foreign loans by\nbank group relative to total foreign lending by German banks. For example, in 2013Q4,\naround 60% of foreign loans granted by German banks can be attributed to the \"large\ncommercial banks\", around 20% to the \"head institutes of savings banks and credit unions\",\nbut only 6% to \"other commercial banks\" and less than 1% to \"savings banks and credit\nunions\" (Table 4). The average bank size in the latter two banking groups is significantly\nsmaller compared to the former two banking groups, such that the result is consistent with the\nrelevance of bank size for the conduct of international activities (Table 5). Furthermore,\ncomparing large commercial banks and head institutes of savings banks and credit unions to\nbanks in the other banking groups reveals that they have, on average, a lower capital ratio and\nilliquid assets ratio, they are net lenders regarding their intragroup positions and financed to a\nlower degree by core deposits. These differences in exposure to foreign activities as well as\nbusiness models might thus impact the transmission of prudential changes.\n[Fact 2: (Inter)national activities of German banks include loans to different sectors.]\nHeterogeneity also exists regarding the sectoral breakdown of lending. For example, German\nbanks' domestic loan supply comprises 56 percent of total assets: 14 percent directed to\nbanks, 37 percent to the non-bank private sector (i.e. non-financial firms and households),\nand 5 percent to the public sector (Table 6). If changes in prudential regulation occur, banks'\nresponses might vary depending on the loan type. We analyze this issue further in robustness\ntests (Section 3.1). Also, the sectoral composition of loans differs between types of German\nbanks' foreign affiliates. A relatively high share of local (=foreign) lending by foreign\nbranches is directed toward the non-bank private sector. In contrast, foreign subsidiaries have\nsimilar shares of local lending exposures to banks and the non-bank private sector. Both\nforeign branches and subsidiaries maintain a relatively high share of home country\n(=domestic) loans to banks, most likely reflecting internal capital market activities.\n[Fact 3: Foreign affiliates of German banks include both branches and subsidiaries.]\nGerman banks maintain both foreign subsidiaries and foreign branches in a large number of\ndifferent counterparty countries. In an extended analysis on the impact of the organizational\nstructure, we cover around 40 destination countries with approximately 170 subsidiaries and\n190 aggregates of branches. 9 Foreign subsidiaries are assumed to respond differently to host\ncountry regulation than foreign branches. For example, German banks' foreign branches,\nwhich are under home country regulation, can expand/reduce their activities compared to\ndomestic banks in the host country if the latter face a tighter/looser regulatory environment.\nIn Section 3.2, we thus analyze whether foreign branches respond differently to a tightening\nor loosening of host country policies compared to foreign subsidiaries of German banks.\n3. Empirical Method and Regression Results\nThis section presents the baseline estimations for inward and outward transmission of\nprudential instruments (Section 3.1). We extend our analysis and ask whether banks adjust\ntheir lending growth differently depending on their organizational form (Section 3.2).\n3.1 Baseline analysis of inward and outward transmission of prudential policies\nIn the following, we provide a description of the baseline empirical model to study inward\nand outward transmission and comment on the results. The analysis closely follows the\napproach described in Buch and Goldberg (2016).\nIn each specification 1 to 3, we include our variable of interest, a prudential policy change,\nboth contemporaneously as well as its two lags. Furthermore, the prudential policy is\ninteracted with banks' balance sheet characteristics showing how banks with different\n9 Note that, as described in the data section, we do not have data on individual branches but the aggregate of\nbranches per German parent bank and host country. For example, if the German parent bank A has two branches\nin the US, we have information on the sum of these two branches.\n(structural) balance sheet characteristics adjust their loan growth in response to changes in\nregulation. In regression tables 7 to 14, for the sake of brevity, the reported coefficients are\nthe sum of the contemporaneous term and its two lags, with the corresponding p-value of the\nF-statistics for joint significance in square brackets.\nAs the prudential instrument enters individually as well as in the interaction effects with bank\nvariables, we calculate a marginal effect (at the average) for both, the contemporaneous\nchanges as well as for the sum of contemporaneous and lagged changes. These marginal\neffects give the effects of regulation for the average bank and are reported at the bottom of\neach table. Baseline regression models include time and bank fixed effects.\nSpecification 1: Exposure-weighted inward transmission of regulation (Table 7).\nY ,\n=  + ( ExpP ,\n+  ExpP ,\n+  ExpP ,\n) + a X ,\n+ (  ExpP ,\n X ,\n+\n ExpP ,\n X ,\n+  ExpP ,\n X ,\n) + f + f +  ,\nwhere Y ,\nis the log change in the domestic lending of bank b at time t. Xb,t-1\nis a vector of\ncontrol variables that captures the degree to which a bank is exposed to changes in regulation\nthrough ex ante balance sheet composition as described in Section 2.1. The prudential policy\nchanges are captured by ExpP, that is an index of exposure-weighted prudential policies\noutside the home country. We control for time-invariant heterogeneity at the bank level by\nincluding bank fixed effects fb\n. Time fixed effects ft\ncapture global developments that affect\nall banks contemporaneously.\nThe interaction terms of the prudential instrument with banks' balance sheet characteristics\nshows how banks with different (structural) balance sheet characteristics adjust their loan\ngrowth in response to changes in regulation. As the baseline regression model includes time\nand bank fixed effects, the coefficient of the interaction term measures how the structure of\nbanks' balance sheets affects the response of bank lending to changes in regulation.\nThis approach helps for identification in two dimensions. First, we estimate lending responses\nat the bank-level with respect to a change in regulatory policies at the country-level.\nAssuming that an individual bank does not drive adjustments in regulatory policies, this\nreduces endogeneity concerns. Second, we interact changes in regulatory policies with\nbalance sheet characteristics. Like this, we can account for the fact that banks' reactions to\nregulatory policy can be heterogeneous depending on their business model. For example,\nbanks' internationalization pattern as well as liquidity and capital buffers might determine to\nwhich extent a bank is affected by changes in regulatory instruments. 10\nResults for specification 1 are shown in Table 7; we see that the exposure-weighted index of\nchanges in the overall prudential index increases domestic lending growth for the average\nbank (see marginal effects at the bottom of Table 7). While this effect is significant\ncontemporaneously, it becomes insignificant in the medium run, if we add the effects for the\nfirst and second lag to a joint effect. One reason for the lack of medium-run effects can be\nthat most of the changes in instruments are clustered in 2012 and 2013. The result on the\nprudential index is driven by two instruments, capital requirements and loan to value ratios.\nFor the latter, we also see a significant effect for the average bank over current and two lags.\nAlso in quantitative terms, the current effect of the loan to value ratio is strongest: Given a\ntightening of the policy, loan growth rates increase on average by 15.2% which corresponds\nto an increase of the median loan growth rate (0.27% per quarter) by 0.04 percentage points\nin that quarter. Loan to value ratios have been used actively by emerging market economies\nover our sample period and have been both tightened and loosened. This provides a solid\nground for the empirical analysis.\nDifferences in bank characteristics do not seem to consistently affect the response to\nregulatory changes abroad. The positive effect in case of the prudential index is weakened for\nbanks with higher net intragroup positions; banks' response to a tightening in the instrument\nis more than four times weaker if the net intragroup funding ratio increases by one standard\ndeviation. This might be because foreign affiliates have less scope to provide intragroup\nfunding to the German parent bank given tighter regulation.\nSpecification 2: Inward transmission of home prudential policy via foreign affiliates (Table\nY , ,\n=  + ( HomeP,\n+  HomeP,\n+  HomeP,\n) +  X ,\n+  Z ,\n+ ( HomeP,\n\nX ,\n+  HomeP,\n X ,\n+  HomeP,\n X ,\n) + f + f +  , ,\nwhere Y ,\nis the log change in the lending to Germany of a foreign affiliate bank b located\nin Germany with a foreign parent from country j at time t. 11 The vector of bank control\n10 For a more detailed discussion about identification issues, see Buch and Goldberg (2016).\n11 Ideally, we would like to distinguish between foreign-owned affiliates that are subject to German (i.e. host)\ncountry regulation and those that are subject to home country regulation. Unfortunately, our data do not allow us\nvariables Xb,t-1\nis the same as above. The prudential policy changes are captured by HomeP,\nreflecting prudential policy in the home country, that is the country of the parent bank of the\nforeign-owned affiliate located in Germany. Z ,\nrepresents the cycle variables for home\ncountry j.\nResults on specification (2) are shown in Table 8. For the average foreign bank (see marginal\neffects at the bottom of the table), home country policy is of importance for sector-specific\ncapital buffers, loan to value ratios and reserve requirements on local currency deposits. The\nlatter two instruments have been used mainly by emerging market countries in our sample.\nAn increase in these instruments reduces the host (i.e. German) lending growth by foreign\naffiliates located in Germany. The economic magnitude of the current effect is strongest for\nsector-specific capital buffers: Given a tightening of the policy, on average loan growth rates\ndecrease by 17.4% which corresponds to a decrease in the median loan growth rate (1.43%\nper quarter) by 0.25 percentage points.\nThis decrease in loan growth can be caused by foreign parents drawing on resources of their\nforeign affiliates to fulfill higher reserve or capital requirements and to maintain lending at\nhome. The effect is, for example, less pronounced for illiquid banks which might have less\nscope to transfer liquidity to their parent bank. Also larger and better-capitalized banks are\naffected less severely, possibly due to higher buffers which allow them to maintain lending\ngrowth. Two conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, especially reductions in\nlending growth in response to activity based measures like loan to value ratios might be\nproblematic from the perspective of the German regulator in case domestic and foreign\nfinancial cycles do not coincide. Second, a foreign affiliate located in Germany is not\nindependent from home country regulation, in particular tighter regulation in its parent bank's\ncountry does not make it more attractive to increase lending growth in Germany.12\nRegarding the financial and business cycle, we find that an upswing in the financial cycle of\nthe home country has positive effects on lending growth of foreign affiliates located in\nGermany. In sum, this suggests that foreign affiliates are not independent of developments in\nto do so. However, regulatory changes in the home country might be important for both types of foreign\naffiliates due to the internal capital market and the influence of the parent bank.\n12 Interestingly, a tightening in concentration ratios in the home market has the opposite effect, namely an\nincrease in lending growth to the host (i.e. German) market. With tighter concentration ratios, banks might seek\nto increase diversification across regions. However, changes in this instrument go back to only two countries\n(the Netherlands and France) such that these results should be taken with care.\nthe country in which their parent bank is located. Regulatory changes and macroeconomic\ndevelopments alike are mirrored in their lending activities within the host country.\nSpecification 3: Outward transmission of destination country prudential policy (Table 9).\nY , ,\n=  +  DestP,\n+  DestP,\n+  DestP,\n+  X ,\n+  Z ,\n+ ( DestP,\n\nX ,\n+  DestP,\n X ,\n+  DestP,\n X ,\n) + f + f + f +  , ,\nWhere Y , ,\nis the log change in the lending of a German bank b to a foreign country j at\ntime t. The prudential policy changes are captured by DestP, reflecting prudential changes in\nthe destination country j of the loan by bank b. All other variables are defined in parallel to\nspecifications (2) and (3). Again we interpret the effect of the regulatory index by computing\nits marginal effect for the average bank.\nResults in Table 9 reveal that a tightening in the prudential index of the destination country\nreduces lending growth of the average German bank to this country. Hence, stricter policies\nin the destination country spill over to German banks even though these are not always\ndirectly subject to the change in regulation. The significant result for the prudential index is\ndriven in particular by changes in reserve requirements. For local reserve requirements, banks\ndo not only react in the short-run as can be observed for the prudential index, the\nconcentration ratio or foreign reserve requirements. Also, the cumulated effect over the\ncurrent and following two quarters is negative and significant. Our results thus suggest that\nreserve requirements which have been used mostly by emerging countries, have indeed been\nsuccessful in dampening lending inflows. 13 A tightening of local reserve requirements relates\non average to a short-run decline in loan growth rates by 0.41 percentage points. The negative\neffect is smaller for banks with more liquid assets, possibly because holding the required\nreserves may be less costly for these banks, but reinforced for banks that obtain higher net\nintragroup funding.\nFinally, macroeconomic developments in the destination country matter for German banks'\ninternational loan portfolio. An upturn in the business and financial cycles causes a positive\nresponse in loan growth. This suggests that German banks expand across borders during\neconomic and financial upswings in the respective destination country.\n13 An increase in reserve requirements imposes additional costs on funding, which might in turn be passed on to\nborrowers by increasing loan rates and hence dampening credit growth. To simultaneously reduce the country's\nattractiveness for foreign capital inflows, an increase in reserve requirements can be accompanied by expansive\nmonetary policy, which translates into lower returns for foreign investors.\nRobustness tests\nWe test the robustness of our results by exploiting the granularity of our data and conducting\nregressions in which the dependent variable is broken down by loans to banks, the the non-\nbank private sector, and the public sector. The sector breakdown shows that responses to\nprudential measures vary across loan sectors and specifications which might explain why we\nobserve only few significant results for total loan growth. For inward transmission through\nforeign exposures, our results are strongest for lending growth to banks and less pronounced\nto the non-bank private sector (Tables 10-11). For outward transmission, the negative effect\nof a tightening in local-currency reserve requirements on German banks' total international\nlending is confirmed contemporaneously and in the medium run for loan growth towards the\nnon-bank sector, as well as in the short-run towards the bank sector (Tables 12-13). 14\nWe further test the robustness of our results to excluding small exposures of a bank to a\nforeign country as this might reflect idiosyncratic business outside the scope of our model.\nResults remain robust if we exclude the 1% or 5% smallest destination country-bank\npositions. Finally, we alternate the set of fixed effects, for instance by including country-time\nfixed effects controlling for demand factors, and the clustering of the standard errors which\ndoes not cause major changes to our results. 15\n3.2 Exploration of organizational structure\nThis section explores whether foreign affiliates differ in their lending behavior in response to\nprudential instruments due to their organizational form. We focus on outward transmission\nand distinguish between lending by foreign subsidiaries and by foreign branches of German\nbanks. This reduces our sample size relative to Table 9 as we exclude all banks that do not\nown foreign affiliates but only lend cross-border. Foreign branches and subsidiaries might be\naffected differently by changes in prudential instruments in the home and the host country\n(Danisewicz et al. 2015). For institution-based instruments, such as capital requirements or\nconcentration limits, branches tend to be subject to home country regulation whereas\nsubsidiaries have to comply with host country regulation. We use this variation across bank\nand instrument types to analyze banks' differential responses.\n14 For brevity, results for loans to the public sector are not reported but can be obtained upon request.\n15 These tables are available upon request.\nOur approach is similar to specification (3) but the sample pools across foreign branches and\nforeign subsidiaries of German banks. We allow for heterogeneous effects of cycle variables,\nof regulation and of the interaction of regulation with bank variables by interacting them with\nan indicator variable that equals one in case of a foreign subsidiary. At the bottom of Table\n14, we report the marginal effects of the prudential instruments for branches and subsidiaries,\nwhere the latter consists of the joint effect of the baseline category (=branch) plus the\ninteraction effect.\nWe find that the average foreign subsidiary reduces lending growth contemporaneously\nfollowing a tightening in the prudential index, sector-specific capital buffers and loan to value\nratios. A tightening in foreign reserve requirements leads to a reduction in lending growth of\nforeign subsidiaries in the medium run. While foreign subsidiaries are thus constrained by\nhost country regulation, we only find weaker evidence for foreign branches. A tightening in\nconcentration ratios leads to a reduction in lending growth in the short run, while a tightening\nin the prudential index leads to an increase in lending growth in the medium run (finding\nsignificant at 10% level only). Bank characteristics other than the organizational structure\nseem to play a less important role in the response of foreign affiliates to regulatory changes.\nOverall, we find that foreign subsidiaries react more strongly to host country regulation.\nForeign branches do not generate regulatory leakages by increasing lending growth after a\ntightening in host country regulation.\n4. Concluding Remarks\nGlobal banks may generate cross-border spillovers of the regulatory stance if they adjust their\ninternational loan portfolio in response to foreign and domestic regulation. While prudential\ninstruments like reserve requirements or loan to value ratios have mostly been implemented\nby emerging market countries, in recent times also advanced countries increase their\nmacroprudential toolkit to target financial stability. For countries like Germany with a highly\ninternationalized banking system, concerns about regulatory spillovers are a topic of utmost\nimportance. Therefore policy discussions and coordination are conducted at the European\nlevel at the ESRB. This macroprudential body has recently recommended monitoring cross-\nborder effects of macroprudential instruments on an annual basis (ESRB 2015). Our study\nmay inform this current policy debate by analyzing the inward and outward transmission of\nregulation for German banks.\nOverall, while we find evidence for cross-border spillovers of regulation, there is no general\nconclusion that holds for all types of policy instruments and banks. Instead, heterogeneity\nbetween banks, loan types and specification matters.\nForeign regulatory changes spill over to lending growth in Germany through both, foreign-\nowned banks located in Germany as well as German-owned banks which maintain\ninternational activities. Foreign-owned banks located in Germany reduce their local loan\ngrowth following a tightening of sector-specific capital buffers, local reserve requirements\nand loan to value ratios in their parent bank's country. This finding suggests that regulatory\npressure can have indirect effects on foreign affiliates located in Germany if their parent bank\ndraws resources from them in order to fulfill tighter requirements in the home country.\nGerman-owned banks also transmit changes in foreign countries' regulatory stance to\nGerman borrowers. A tightening of foreign regulation leads to an increase in domestic\nlending growth.\nFurthermore, we find that German banks reduce foreign lending growth given a tightening in\nprudential instruments in the destination country. However, these negative responses abate\nrather quickly, except for local reserve requirements. Thus, our results suggest that reserve\nrequirements have been effective in dampening lending inflows by German banks into\nforeign economies.\nFinally, transmission occurs not only because of regulatory changes but also because of\neconomic developments. This is reflected by the fact that business and financial cycles matter\nfor lending decisions: foreign subsidiaries located in Germany increase lending growth in the\nhost country in response to an upturn in the financial cycle of their home country. Also,\nGerman banks' international lending behavior is procyclical in the sense that loan growth\nincreases in response to an upturn in the financial and business cycles of the destination\ncountry.\nReferences\nAiyar, S., Calomiris, C.W., and Wieladek, T.
