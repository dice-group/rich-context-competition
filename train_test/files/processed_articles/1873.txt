The prevalence of HIV infection among those aged 18 to\nbetween surveys in any race and/or ethnic or gender group among\nof prevalence. Cocaine use and the presence of herpes simplex virus-\n2 antibody were the only significant risk factors for HIV infection for\nnon-Hispanic blacks. Fifty-eight percent of infected individuals not\nreporting ART had CD4 T-lymphocyte counts G200 cells/mm3\ncompared with 18.2% on therapy and 12.5% of participants newly\ninformed of their HIV status.\nKey Words: national survey, HIV antibody, prevalence\nAs part of the overall surveillance activities to monitor the\nHIV epidemic in the United States, testing for HIV\nantibody has been included in 2 National Health and Nutrition\ninfected individuals based on this representative sample of\nthe civilian noninstitutionalized household population of the\nopportunity to estimate the change in HIV prevalence in the\ngeneral household population since NHANES III. In the 10\nyears between the 2 surveys, the number of new AIDS cases\nand deaths declined substantially after the introduction of\ncombination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the late 1990s.\nThe number of estimated new HIV infections has remained\nstable at approximately 40,000 per year; therefore, the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that\nthe number of individuals living with HIV infection continues\nto increase.3 Surveillance data of persons diagnosed with HIV\ninfection has also demonstrated a changing epidemic that now\ndisproportionately affects poor and minority individuals.4\nestimate of the current epidemiology of infection in the general\nhousehold population. CD4 T-lymphocyte testing was also con-\nducted on HIV-positive individuals and age-matched controls to\nexamine the current state of immune function in infected parti-\ncipants compared with noninfected individuals. In addition,self-\nreported data on medication use in this survey provided insight\ninto treatment of HIV-infected individuals, and data on self-\nreported risk behaviors provided informationon the contribution\nof these behaviors in the general household population.\nMETHODS\nStudy Populations and Sample Design\nThe NHANES are a series of cross-sectional surveys\ndesigned to provide national statistics on the health and\nnutritional status of the general household population through\nhousehold interviews, standardized physical examinations,\nand the collection of biologic samples in special mobile\nexamination centers (MECs).\nThe sampling plan of each survey has been a stratified,\nmultistage, probability cluster design that selected a sample\nrepresentative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized\nparticipants aged 18 to 59 years were anonymously tested for\nantibody to HIV.

In 1999, the\nNHANES became a continuous survey with data released in\n2-year cycles. HIV antibody prevalence estimates from 1999\nto 2002 are presented in this article. During these survey\nyears, HIV testing was not anonymous and was performed on\nparticipants aged 18 to 49 years. Because age by individual\nyears was not associated with information on HIV status in\nNHANES III, it is not possible to construct comparable age\ngroups for those aged 40 or more years across the 2 surveys.\nethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic\nblack, and Mexican American. Persons not fitting these\ncategories were classified as Bother[ and included in the total\npopulation. In both surveys, Mexican Americans and black\nAmericans were sampled at a higher rate than other persons.\nThe HIV antibody test results were reported to\ntransmitted disease (STD) laboratory results using a call-in\npassword-protected system. If participants did not call for the\nresults, they were sent 3 reminder letters to encourage them to\ncall. Information on previous knowledge of HIV status was\nobtained as part of the posttest counseling.\nanalyzed with other NHANES components and data. Vari-\nables analyzed include poverty index ratio calculated by\ndividing total family income by the poverty threshold index\nadjusted for family size at year of interview and categorized as\nbelow poverty (G1) or at or above poverty (1 or above)7 and\neducation measured as last year of school completed and\ngrouped into 2 levels (less than high school graduate and high\nschool completed or more education) as well as marital status\ngrouped as married, living as married, or widowed; divorced\nor separated; and never married. The sexual behavior and drug\nuse data were collected in a private room in the MEC using\nan audio computer-assisted self-interviewing technique\n(ACASI). The variables collected include use of cocaine and\nintravenous drugs, age at first intercourse, lifetime number of\nsexual partners, and history of male-to-male sex.\nwere collected during the household interview. Respondents\nwere asked: BHave you taken or used any medicines for which a\ndoctor`s or dentist`s prescription is needed in the past month?[\nFor each medication reported, the interviewer asked to see the\nmedication container to record the product names from the\nlabel. If the container was unavailable (17% of all reported\nproducts), the interviewer probed the subject for this\ninformation.8\nIn both surveys, informed consent was obtained from\nall participants and the National Center for Health Statistics,\nCDC Ethical Review Board approved the protocols.\nLaboratory Methods\nIn NHANES III, serum specimens were tested for HIV-\n1 antibody using a US Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA)Ylicensed enzyme immunoassay kit (Genetic Systems,\nRedmond, WA or Organon-Teknika Corporation, Durham, NC).\nPositive specimens were retested and confirmed by an FDA-\nlicensed Western blot assay (Biotech/Dupont, Rockville,\nMD) and interpreted according to the Association of\nState and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors\n(ASTPHLD)/CDC criteria.9\nfor HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody (HIV-1/HIV-2 Peptide EIA,\nGenetic Systems). HIV-1 was not differentiated from HIV-2\nduring these survey years; thus, positive results are identified\nas HIV-positive without an indication of subtype in this article.\nAll repeatedly positive specimens were confirmed by Western\nblot analysis (Calypte Serum Western blot; Calypte Biomedical\nCorporation, Pleasanton, CA). NHANES participants who\nconsented to the HIV test but did not have venipuncture or\ndid not have sufficient serum available for the serum antibody\ntest were tested for HIV antibody using urine (Calypte HIV-1\nPeptide EIA; Calypte Biomedical Corporation). Positive\nspecimens were retested and confirmed by Western blot analy-\nsis (Calypte Urine Western blot; Calypte Biomedical\nEnumeration of CD4 T lymphocytes from NHANES\ncontrols was performed on cryopreserved whole blood using\nthe method reported by Fiebig et al.11 Samples were batch-\nthawed quickly with 8 to 10 samples per batch in a 37-C\nwater bath and analyzed within 2 hours of setup. The CD4\nT-lymphocyte cell counts were obtained using the Becton\nDickinson MultiTEST reagent in TrueCOUNT tubes (Becton\nDickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA).\nComparison of this method with fresh normal whole blood\nresulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.97, with a slope of\nAntibody to herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 was\ndetermined by a type-specific immunodot assay. Details\nabout this method have been previously reported.12\nStatistical Analyses\nPrevalence estimates for both surveys were weighted to\nrepresent the total civilian noninstitutionalized US household\npopulation in the age groups covered in each survey and to\naccount for oversampling and nonresponse to the household\ninterview and physical examination but not for nonresponse to\nphlebotomy. The weights were further ratio-adjusted by age,\ngender, and race and/or ethnicity to the US population control\nestimates from the current population survey adjusted for\nundercounts.13 Standard errors were calculated using\nSUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, NC),14 a family of statistical procedures for analysis of\ndata from complex sample surveys. Ninety-five percent\nconfidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the logit\ntransformation.15 To examine possible predictors of seroposi-\ntivity, differences in prevalence were evaluated by examining\nP values calculated using a univariate t statistic obtained from a\ngeneral linear contrast procedure in SUDAAN. For total\ncomparisons between NHANES III and NHANES 1999 to\nUS population.16 Because the estimates are of small magnitude\nrelative to their standard errors (RSEs), all prevalence estimates\nexcept for the total estimate in each survey were outside the\naccepted RSE reliability cut point of less than 30%.17\nCopyright \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

Because there were\nonly 3 non-Hispanic white and 4 Mexican-American HIV-\npositive individuals, sample sizes were too small to describe\nassociations with potential risk factors for these 2 groups in\nany detail. Data are thus presented for the non-Hispanic\nblacks and the total population. Despite this categorization,\nlow prevalence in all groups limited the statistical power to\nidentify significant differences between subgroups, although\nmost associations were in the expected direction.

Estimates from these surveys\ncan be used with those from national surveillance from\nselected populations to provide a more complete picture of\nthe HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States. Prevalence\nestimates from the 2 surveys conducted approximately 10\nyears apart for those aged 18 to 39 years were not statistically\nare living with HIV infection in the US household population.\nThe upper limit of this estimate is similar to the CDC 2003\nStates living with HIV/AIDS.18\nwas higher among persons with known risk behaviors and\namong non-Hispanic blacks, which is consistent with other\nCDC HIV antibody prevalence surveys.19 Data from the\nCDC`s 1997 unlinked prevalence surveys in selected STD\nclinics, drug treatment centers, and adolescent medicine\nclinics19 had a black/white ratio that ranged from 1.5 among\nmen who have sex with men (MSM) and women attending\nSTD clinics to 4.3 among participants in the Young`s Men`s\nSurvey (MSM aged 15Y22 years who attended public venues\nAmong non-Hispanic blacks, a history of use of cocaine\nor other street drugs had the strongest effect on infection. The\nimpact of drug use on HIV transmission through use of\ncontaminated needles or indirect transmission to sexual\npartners or via maternal-child transmission has been well\ndocumented and accounts for nearly half of the annual total\nnumber of HIV cases in the United States.21 A 10-year\nprospective study in Baltimore has demonstrated that risk\nfactors for HIV seroconversion differed by sex.22 For male\nparticipants, needle sharing and male-to-male sex increased\nHIV incidence, whereas for female participants, high-risk\nsexual behavior was more significant than drug use beha-\nto 2002 was the presence of antibody to HSV-2, which was\nassociated with an increase in HIV seroprevalence in the total\nand non-Hispanic black populations. HSV-2 infection has\nbeen demonstrated to double the risk of HIV acquisition;23\nthus, this association was not unexpected. There is evidence\nthat among those who are coinfected with HIV and HSV-2,\nthere is a significant biologic interaction between these 2\nviruses, resulting in more efficient sexual transmission of HIV\nand an increased HIV viral load during clinical and sub-\nclinical HSV-2 reactivation.24,25 Because data from previous\nthe population had antibody to HSV-2 and that prevalence was\ngreater than 50% among non-Hispanic blacks aged 30 years or\nolder,12 a substantial percentage of the population has this\nadditional added risk associated with increased prevalence of\nHIV infection.\nPrescription drug use was obtained from all HIV-\npositive persons during the household interview, and CD4 T-\nlymphocyte counts were performed on all HIV-positive blood\nsamples. These data provide a cross-sectional estimate of\nimmune function among HIV-positive individuals in the\ngeneral population. Seven of the 12 individuals who did not\nreport current treatment had CD4 T-lymphocyte counts\ntreatment, demonstrating that receiving ART treatment was\nassociated with better immune function in this population.\nAmong the newly informed individuals, only 1 individual\nHIV antibody prevalence estimates in the 2 NHANES\nconducted approximately 10 years apart assist in monitoring\nthe changing HIV epidemic in the United States, but because\nof the low prevalence and the small number of HIV-positive\npersons, these data need to be interpreted carefully. The\nNHANES are designed to provide reliable estimates of\nconditions by demographic groups based on a 10% pre-\nvalence with an RSE of G30%. The magnitudes of HIV\nantibody prevalence in both NHANES do not meet these\nstandards, and the RSEs are greater than 30% for most\ndemographic groups. The NHANES are also limited by the\nfact that many high-risk populations are not sampled, such as\nprisoners and other institutionalized populations. In addition,\nindividuals who did not have a stable household would be less\nlikely to be sampled. Finally, the age range tested was only 18\nto 49 years in the most recent survey; thus, estimates on\nindividuals outside this range were not provided.\nDespite these limitations, a comparison across surveys\nprovides some insight into the HIV epidemic trends in the\nUnited States. The concentration of the HIV epidemic in the\nnon-Hispanic black population seen in many CDC surveil-\nlance programs4 was also observed in this household\npopulation. On the positive side, individuals on antiretroviral\nmedication had improved immune function.\nIn January 2001, the CDC published an HIV prevention\nstrategic plan26 with an overarching goal of reducing by at\nleast 50% the number of new infections and of eliminating\nracial and ethnic disparities. Emphasis was shifted from\nfocusing largely on prevention of transmission to those not\ninfected with HIV to preventing transmission from HIV-\npositive persons.26 These strategies require that individuals\nknow their HIV status and that they have access to adequate\nmedical care and prevention counseling. At least 25% of the\nNHANES HIV positive population did not know their test\nresults (8 individuals who called in for their results of the\n32 positive participants), which is consistent with other\nTABLE 3.
