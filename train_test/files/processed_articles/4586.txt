Compared with PLIF, Dynesys\nstabilization can maintain the mobility of the stabilized segments with less influence on the\nproximal adjacent segment and may help to prevent the occurrence of adjacent segment\ndegeneration.

With increasing research, more reports\nhave described the deficiencies of fusion\nsurgery, such as adjacent segment degener-\nation (ASD) and acquired spinal instability\nafter the fusion operation. Non-fusion tech-\nnology has been developed to solve these\nproblems. As a posterior lumbar non-fusion\ntechnique, Dynesys dynamic stabilization\nhas become more widely performed.1,2 The\nDynesys system was designed by Dubois\net al. and was first applied in the clinical\nsetting in 1994. The Dynesys dynamic sta-\nbilization system aims to maintain the range\nof motion (ROM) of the fixed segment,\npreserve the lumbar spinal stability, and\nprevent ASD. Clinical reports of Dynesys\nstabilization have mainly focused on the\nshort-term clinical efficacy; medium- and\nlong-term clinical follow-up studies, espe-\ncially those involving PLIF as a control, are\nlacking.3 In this retrospective study, we\nanalyzed the clinical effects and radiographic\nresults of Dynesys dynamic stabilization\nversus PLIF in the treatment of multiseg-\nmental lumbar degenerative disease.\nMaterials and methods\nGeneral data\nA total of 57 patients underwent operations\nfor multisegmental lumbar degenerative dis-\nease at The Affiliated Hospital of School of\nMedicine of Ningbo University from\npatients were randomized to either the\nDynesys or PLIF group. The Dynesys\nspinal stenosis. Eighteen patients had\ninvolvement of two segments, and eight\npatients had involvement of three segments.\nThe PLIF group comprised 31 patients\ndegenerative spinal stenosis. Nineteen\npatients had involvement of 2 segments,\n11 patients had involvement of 3 segments,\nand 1 patient had involvement of 4\nsegments.\nSymptoms in this study included low\nback pain with or without neurologic clau-\ndication or sciatic pain. Three months of\nnonoperative treatment failed in all patients.\nThis study was approved by the Human\nEthics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital\nof the Medical College of Ningbo\nUniversity. Each patient enrolled in this\nstudy provided written informed consent.\nAll patients were followed up for at\nleast 46 months and underwent X-ray\nand magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nexaminations.\nThe inclusion criteria were involvement\nof two or more lumbar segments, neurogenic\nclaudication caused by lumbar spinal sten-\nosis, or low back or leg pain caused by\ndegenerative intervertebral disc disease.4\u00ad6\nThe exclusion criteria were severe osteopor-\nosis; severe spinal deformity; grade !2\nlumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis; pro-\ngressive intervertebral disc degeneration;\nserious instability associated with lumbar\nspine disease; obesity (body mass index of\n!30 kg/m2); serious heart, brain, or lung\ndisease; trauma; infection; malignant\ntumors; history of lumbar spine surgery;\nand pelvic-related disease.\nSurgical techniques\nAll operations were performed by the same\nsurgical team at a single institution. The\npatients were placed in the prone position,\nand a standard surgical procedure was\nused for posterior lumbar spine surgery.\nThrough a midline incision and after\nsubperiosteal dissection of the erector\nspine muscles, the affected segment and\nentrance points for the pedicle screws were\nexposed. Radiographic guidance with a C-\narm X-ray machine was used to ensure\nthat the Dynesys pedicle screws were safely\ninserted. Interlaminar decompression and\nlaminotomy were performed in the\nDynesys group depending on each patient's\ncondition. However, extensive decompres-\nsion such as semi-laminectomy or total\nlaminectomy was performed in patients\nwith severe stenosis or far lateral stenosis.\nAll procedures were carefully performed to\navoid destruction of the facet joints.7\nPolycarbonate urethane spacers and poly-\nethylene terephthalate cords were accur-\nately assembled according to the technical\nsuggestions provided by the manufacturer.\nFinally, the incision was flushed, a drain-\nage tube was placed, and the incision was\nclosed in a step-by-step manner.\nPatients in the PLIF group underwent\nstandard semi-laminectomy or total lamin-\nectomy according to the severity of their\ndisease. The nucleus pulposus was carefully\nremoved, nerve root was completely\nreleased, and an interbody fusion cage\nfilled with artificial bone material was\ninserted.\nPostoperative management\nAntibiotics were routinely administered for\n1 to 3 days after surgery. The drainage tube\nwas removed 24 to 72 hours postoperatively.\nThe patients were encouraged to cough and\nproduce expectoration as well as move their\nlower limbs after the operation to prevent\ndeep vein thrombosis. Patients in the\nDynesys group wore a soft lumbar orthosis\nfor 12 weeks. In contrast, patients in the\nPLIF group wore a hard orthosis for\nClinical and radiological evaluation\nEvaluations were performed preoperatively,\n3 months postoperatively, and at the final\nfollow-up. Back and leg pain were evaluated\nusing a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the\nOswestry disability index (ODI).8,9\nRadiological evaluation included lumbar\nflexion-extension and lateral standing radi-\nography, computed tomography, and MRI.\nRadiological measurements were per-\nformed as follows. (1) The average interver-\ntebral space height (AH) was calculated using\nthe ventral intervertebral space height (VH),\ndorsal intervertebral space height (DH), and\ncentral intervertebral space height (CH):\nAH \u00bc (VH \u00fe CH \u00fe DH)/3. (2) Segmental\nROM was calculated as the angle between\nthe inferior surface of the upper vertebrae\nand the superior surface of the lower\nvertebrae on the lateral standing lumbar\nflexion-extension X-ray. (3) All patients\nunderwent lumbar MRI both preoperatively\nand at the final follow-up to evaluate\nchanges in the height of the adjacent degen-\nerative intervertebral discs and signals of the\nintervertebral discs. Disc degeneration was\ngraded on T2-weighted sagittal and axial\nMRI according to the modified method\ndescribed by Pfirrmann.10\nRadiologic ASD was diagnosed by the\ndevelopment of olisthesis of 4 mm, a 10\nangular change on flexion-extension lateral\nradiographs, 10% loss of disc height, or\ngrade !2 disc deterioration (University of\nCalifornia at Los Angeles disc degeneration\nASD was also diagnosed by a modified\nPfirrmann grade of IV or V or the presence\nof spinal stenosis or disc herniation at the\nadjacent level. Clinical ASD was diagnosed\nin the presence of (1) symptomatic spinal\nstenosis, (2) intractable back pain, or (3)\nsubsequent sagittal or coronal balance as\nsuggested by Cheh et al.13 Symptomatic\nspinal stenosis was defined as MRI-diag-\nnosed stenosis accompanied by clinical\nneurologic claudication.\nRadiographs were evaluated three\ntimes independently by two experienced\nspine surgeons in this study. We used the\nmean value of each parameter in all analyses\nand resolved disagreements through discus-\nsion or by consultation with a senior\nsurgeon.\nStatistical assessment\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS 18.0 statistics software (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA). Measurement data are\npresented as mean \u00c6 standard deviation\n(SD), and enumeration data were evaluated\nwith the chi square test. Categorical data\nwere compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank\ntest. A P-value of <0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\nResults\nClinical outcomes\nAll patients were followed up. The Dynesys\ngroup was followed up for 50.3 months\n(range, 46\u00ad65 months); the mean operating\n255 min), and the mean blood loss volume\ngroup was followed up for 52.8 months\n(range, 48\u00ad68 months); the mean operating\n300 min), and the mean blood loss volume\nage, follow-up time, and disease distribution\nwere not significantly different between the\ntwo groups. However, the operation time\nand blood loss volume were significantly\nlower in the Dynesys than PLIF group\nClinical symptoms such as back and leg\npain were significantly improved at the final\nfollow-up in both groups. The VAS score\nand ODI were also significantly improved at\nthe 3-month and final follow-ups in both\ngroups. Moreover, the VAS score and ODI\nwere significantly better at the final follow-\nup than at the 3-month follow-up in\nRadiological outcomes\nThe preoperative and postoperative radio-\nlogic parameters in the Dynesys and PLIF\ngroups are shown in Table 4. At the final\nfollow-up, the disc height of the fixed seg-\nments was slightly increased in both groups\nand significantly increased in the PLIF\ngroup (P < 0.05). ASD frequently occurs\nsuperior to the fixed segment; therefore,\nwe only evaluated the radiological out-\ncomes of the proximal adjacent segment\nin this study.14,15 The disc height of the\nproximal adjacent segment was not signifi-\ncantly decreased in the two groups.

In contrast to\nPLIF, Dynesys technology can carry and\nbalance the load between vertebrae while\nretaining the motor function of the fixed\nFigure 2. a: The preoperative lumbar MRI(T2). b\u00add: The preoperative flexion and extension X-rays.\nThe ROM of L4/5 was 10, and the ROM of L5/S1 was 7. e\u00adh: The flexion and extension X-rays 52 months\nafter operation.

Additionally, after move-\nment recovery and load delivery, the degen-\nerated intervertebral disc has the potential for\nself-repair.19 Theoretically, Dynesys dynamic\nstabilization has more advantages than\nDynesys stabilization has been performed\nfor more than 20 years, and many studies\nhave verified its clinical effects. However,\nmost of these studies were short-term case\nreports; comparative studies with PLIF are\nlacking.20,21 Through its retrospective case-\ncontrol design, the present study allowed for\ncomparison of the clinical effects and radio-\ngraphic characteristics of Dynesys stabiliza-\ntion versus PLIF for the treatment of\nmultisegmental lumbar degenerative dis-\nease. In addition, the average follow-up\nduration was more than 46 months. The\nclinical effects at all follow-up points showed\nobvious improvement over the condition\nbefore treatment (P < 0.05), suggesting\nthat Dynesys stabilization has a definite\ntherapeutic effect in treating multisegmental\nlumbar degenerative disease. Moreover,\nthe postoperative lumbar disc height of the\nfixed segment was greater than that pre-\noperatively (P < 0.05), and the ROM\nThis indicates that Dynesys stabilization\npartially preserves the motion of the oper-\nated segment based on stabilization of the\nlumbar vertebrae. Additionally, there was\nno significant difference in the lumbar disc\nheight or ROM of the proximal adjacent\nsegment before and after treatment, indicat-\ning that Dynesys stabilization can effectively\nreduce the influence of these parameters on\nthe adjacent segment in the middle-term\nfollow-up.

Complications in the two groups.\nGroup Nerve root injury Dural tear Screw loosening Reoperation Incision infection\nData are presented as number of patients.\nPLIF, posterior lumbar interbody fusion\na relatively small operative wound and\nprovides a satisfactory effect, and the overall\nrate of complications such as implant failure\nand breakage was lower than that of PLIF;\ntherefore, we consider that PLIF can be\nreplaced by Dynesys dynamic stabilization\nfor fixation in patients with lumbar degen-\nerative disease. In total, of the 172 screws\nused among 26 patients who underwent\nDynesys stabilization in this study, only 2\nscrews had become loose at the medium-\nterm follow-up, both located at S1, within 6\nmonths postoperatively. These patients had\nno associated symptoms, and screw loosen\nand breakage were not visible temporarily.\nAdditionally, no delayed infection occurred\nand no postoperative revision was needed.\nStoll et al.22 reported that most cases of\nscrew loosening occurred in the closest\nproximal or closest distal segment.\nConsistent with this, both cases of screw\nloosening in the present study occurred in\nthe closest distal segment. Furthermore,\nboth were located at S1, which can likely\nbe explained by the difficulty in gaining a\nsatisfactory angle during implantation\nbecause of the shorter length of the S1\nscrew and higher tension in the lumbosacral\nregion. The greater stress of the S1 screw\nafter a multisegment operation is probably\nanother cause. Regardless of this complica-\ntion, we still believe that Dynesys dynamic\nstabilization is safe and effective in\ntreating multisegmental lumbar degenera-\ntive disease.\nThe clinical features of multisegmental\nlumbar degenerative disease are complex\nand atypical, making localization difficult.\nExtensive decompression and multilevel\nfusion have been widely adopted.\nHowever, ASD after multilevel fusion is\nattracting increasingly more attention. One\nstudy suggested that 24% to 45% of patients\nwith lumbar interbody fusion develop accel-\nerated ASD,23 which leads to spinal stenosis\nof the adjacent segment, vertebral\ninstability, and facet joint osteoarthritis.\nCadaver studies have revealed that the\npressure and ROM within the adjacent\nintervertebral disc after long-level fusion is\nclearly higher than that after short-level\nfusion.24 In patients with multisegmental\nlumbar degenerative disease, the influence of\nDynesys stabilization on the development of\nASD is a current area of clinical research.\nWhen comparing simple lumbar discectomy\nand lumbar interbody fusion, Dynesys sta-\nbilization is capable of removing the her-\nniated nucleus pulposus and releasing nerve\ncompression. Moreover, it can restore the\nlumbar disc height of the operative segment\nand maintain the structure of the lumbar\nspine. Furthermore, it can preserve the\nROM of the operative segment, reduce the\nstress load on the adjacent segment, and\ncompensation of motion range.16 Many\nstudies have also supported the idea that\nDynesys stabilization can delay the occur-\nrence of adjacent-level degeneration.\nHowever, its specific mechanism is yet\nunclear. Ciavarro et al.25 determined the\nglycosaminoglycan content of the interver-\ntebral disc in the fixed segment and adjacent\nsegment after Dynesys stabilization using\nMRI with delayed enhancement. They\nfound that the glycosaminoglycan content\nwas increased at both 6 and 24 months\npostoperatively. In addition, the content\nwas higher 24 months than at 6 months\npostoperatively. The authors concluded that\nDynesys stabilization can delay degener-\nation and promote self-repair of the inter-\nvertebral disc. Beastall et al.26 made months\nMRI follow-up for 24 patients who under-\nwent Dynesys stabilization and found that\nthe fixed segment holds part of motion, but\nno obvious change occurred at the adjacent\nsegment; additionally, the anterior height of\nthe intervertebral space decreased, while\nthere was no apparent increase of the pos-\nterior of intervertebral space. Therefore,\nDynesys stabilization could prevent the\noccurrence of ASD. However, some\nresearchers doubt the role of Dynesys\nstabilization in preventing and releasing\nwith delayed enhancement of the cartilage\nand intervertebral discs preoperatively and 6\nmonths postoperatively in patients who\nunderwent Dynesys stabilization. They dis-\ncovered that Dynesys stabilization can delay\nor partly reverse the degeneration of the\nintervertebral disc, especially for patients\nwith severely degenerative intervertebral\ndiscs. However, Dynesys stabilization\nincreased the load on the adjacent segment,\nwhich led to the early development of ASD.\nAfter the average 50.3-month follow-up in\nthe present study, the differences in the\nvariation of the lumbar space height at the\nupper end of the adjacent segment between\nthe Dynesys and PLIF groups were not\nstatistically significant. The ROM at the\nupper end of the adjacent segment was\ngreater at the final follow-up than preopera-\ntively. Additionally, the ROM at the upper\nend of the adjacent segment was greater in\nthe PLIF than Dynesys group at the final\nfollow-up, indicating that Dynesys stabiliza-\ntion better retains the motion of the adjacent\nsegment than does PLIF. Moreover, tem-\nporary development of adjacent lumbar\nspondylosis was not found during follow-\nup in the Dynesys group. However, one\npatient in the PLIF group required a second\noperation because of symptoms of ASD.\nThe factors that affect the development of\nASD remain unclear. Determination of\nwhether Dynesys stabilization can actually\nprevent the occurrence of ASD requires\nfurther high-quality randomized controlled\ntrials with long-term follow-up.\nIn conclusion, Dynesys dynamic stabil-\nization provides a satisfactory medium-term\neffect in treating multisegmental lumbar\ndegenerative disease. Dynesys stabilization\nresults in a smaller wound, which benefits\nfor multisegment recovery, and the clinical\nfollow-up data showed that Dynesys stabil-\nization can partially preserve the ROM of\nthe fixed segments and limit abnormal\nmovement of the lumbar spine. It also has\nlittle effect on the adjacent segment and is\nassociated with a lower incidence of compli-\ncations such as screw loosening and break-\nage. However, the specific mechanism for\nthe prevention of ASD remains unclear. No\ndetailed data are available to verify that\nDynesys stabilization can delay ASD.\nBecause of the small number of cases in\nthe present study, determination of the long-\nterm effects of Dynesys dynamic stabiliza-\ntion and its impact on the adjacent segment\nrequires further clinical research with long-\nterm follow-up.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
