Developing\na better understanding of early farming practices, revealing the various inputs that were required to\nmake agriculture a success under a range of social and ecological conditions, can therefore contrib-\nute to wider questions regarding the trajectory of present-day economies and the agricultural basis\nof today's subsistence practices.\nAlthough much research has focused on the when and where of early cultivation and crop\ndomestication (e.g. Price and Bar-Yosef, 2011; Willcox, 2013), less is known about the nature of\nearly farming itself, including tillage and weeding, manuring, water management, the longevity of\ncultivation and the interplay between crop and animal husbandry. Manuring of fields, in particular,\nimplies an investment in the land, since `topping up' of nutrient levels is only required if plots are\nlong-lived; consecutive crop harvests eventually strip the soil of nutrients, which must be replaced\nif subsequent crop yields are to be maintained (e.g. Rothamsted Research, 2006: 9). Manuring also\nimplies a certain labour input and a close interdependence between crop and animal husbandry,\ncollection and subsequent spreading of manure requires management of domestic animals and is\ncostly in terms of time and labour (Halstead, 2014). Moreover, since manure is a finite resource,\nstrategic decisions about its application were likely to have been necessary in order to maximise\ncrop yields most effectively, and to enable surpluses to buffer against potential future crop failures\nIn the so-called Fertile Crescent region of the eastern Mediterranean, where the earliest crop\ncultivation and domestication are currently documented (Willcox, 2013), rainfed cultivation is pos-\nsible but water is the major limitation to growth, as in other semi-arid regions (mean annual rainfall\n1978). Water management practices, whether through location of cultivated plots close to natural\nwater sources or on soils with better natural water retention, or through small-scale hand-watering\nor larger-scale irrigation works, help to ensure favourable and reliable crop yields (Abbo et al.,\n2010; Halstead and O'Shea, 1989). Manuring has also been found to improve the water use effi-\nciency of some crop species (Hati et al., 2006). As with manuring, water management practices\nrequire strategic planning and management of the cultivated environment, since wetter areas in\narid regions are likely to be scarce, and high labour inputs may be required for hand-watering and\nmanipulation of water supplies.\nBy assessing the likelihood of manuring and water management at early farming sites, it is\ntherefore possible to infer the degree to which early farming societies were investing in the long-\nterm productivity of the land and in the day-to-day maintenance of soil quality, and making stra-\ntegic decisions about the use of valuable resources such as labour, manure and water. A range of\nmodels have been proposed for early farming regimes (summarized in Bogaard, 2005), each with\nvarying degrees of labour input and investment in the land: shifting cultivation, extensive ard\ncultivation, floodplain farming and intensive gardening. Our aim here is not to test these models\nper se, since this would require incorporation of ecological analysis of arable weed flora along-\nside stable isotope analysis (cf. Bogaard et al., 2015). Rather, the most relevant contrasts for this\ndiscussion of crop isotope chemistry and farming in arid regions are those between relatively\nlow- and high-input forms of cultivation, where management intensity relates to maintenance of\ncrop water and nutrient supply: maintenance of adequate water and soil nutrients would point to\nrelatively intensive management, as in a `gardening' regime. Naturally favourable water supply\nand soil fertility would arguably be available in floodplains (Sherratt, 1980), but this model for\n4 The Anthropocene Review 3(1)\nearly cultivation was developed without ethnographic support (Isaakidou, 2011) and relies on\nspring sowing for which there is no archaeobotanical evidence (Hillman, 2000; Jones et al., 2013).\nIn this paper, stable isotope values were determined for barley grains sampled from a series of\nmodern farming plots in Morocco, one of the few (semi)-arid areas of the Mediterranean where\ntraditional agrosystems offer a range of watering and manuring regimes under different annual\nrainfall conditions, supplementing stable isotope data from modern bread wheat grains grown\nunder a range of controlled irrigation and manuring regimes at an experimental station nearAleppo,\nSyria (see Fraser et al., 2011; Wallace et al., 2013). These data allow a framework to be developed\nthat will refine current stable isotopic approaches used to infer manuring intensity and crop water\nstatus in (semi)-arid regions. This refined method is then applied to charred (carbonized) crop\nremains (cereal grains and pulse seeds) from two early farming sites in the eastern Mediterranean:\nAbu Hureyra in the northern Levant, and `Ain Ghazal in the southern Levant (Figure 5). These\nsites date to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic and beginning of the Pottery Neolithic (PPNB and PN;\nc.8800-6000 cal. BC), a period during which both cultivation and herding were becoming estab-\nlished and widespread. The intention is to identify crop isotope signatures that deviate from those\nexpected because of environmental factors (for which rainfall is used as an index), and thus to\nidentify, or discount, potential management practices. In this way, our study aims to enhance\nknowledge of early agricultural practice, informing wider debates regarding societal changes and\nsubsistence strategies at the advent of farming.\nCrop nitrogen isotope values\nCrop nitrogen isotope (15N) values integrate a range of environmental and physiological pro-\ncesses, but largely reflect the 15N value of the soil in which they are grown (e.g. Evans, 2001;\nH\u00f6gberg, 1997). Studies of modern crops have found that manuring can increase the 15N values\nof cereals by as much as 10, and this increase is related to the intensity \u00ad amount and frequency\n\u00ad of manuring (e.g. Bol et al., 2005; Fraser et al., 2011), as well as the type of manure (Szpak,\n2014). Based on these modern studies, cereal grain 15N values for high, medium and low/no\nmanuring levels have been estimated (see Figure 3; cf. Bogaard et al., 2013: figure 1). Since\nchanges in manuring level take a number of years to register in crop 15N values (Fraser et al.,\n2011), contrasts in crop 15N values reflect sustained differences in cultivation, indicating variable\ninvestment in the land over many years.\nThe potential of 15N values of carbonized crop remains from archaeological sites as a means of\nassessing manuring intensity has been demonstrated in a number of recent studies within temperate\nVaiglova et al., 2014), revealing that farmers in Europe and the Mediterranean practised varying\nlevels of manuring on sites from as early as 5900 cal. bc. Another recent study, by Araus et al.\n(2014), determined the 15N of pre-domestic and domestic cereal grains from a series of sites in the\nNear East dating from c. 11,070 cal. bc to the present-day. This study found that cereal grain 15N\nvalues decreased over the millennia, a trend that the authors interpret as a reflection of decreasing\nsoil fertility (Araus et al., 2014). A large proportion (45%) of the determined cereal grain 15N\nvalues were > 6, which in temperate climates would be consistent with intensive manuring\n(Bogaard et al., 2013). However, 70% of cereal grains with 15N values > 6 were associated with\npre-domestication cultivation, which although not precluding the possibility of early middening/\nmanuring, is unlikely to have been closely integrated with animal husbandry (cf. Araus et al.,\n2014). It is possible that the high cereal grain 15N values determined by Araus et al. (2014) are at\nleast partly due to environmental factors such as aridity, which increases plant 15N values (e.g.\nStyring et al. 5\nthe effect of manuring from that of aridity before farming practice can be assessed reliably at the\narchaeological sites in the semi-arid regions where early farming began.\nTo distinguish the contribution of manure from environmental factors (such as aridity), the\napproach of recent studies has been to estimate the 15N values of plants consumed by herbivores\nfound at the same archaeological site/phase, by subtracting the offset (c. 4; Steele and Daniel,\n1978) between consumer and diet from the 15N values of preserved herbivore bone collagen, and\nStyring et al., in press; Vaiglova et al., 2014). This estimated 15N value could differ from the true\n15N value of unmanured cereal grains because herbivores consume a range of plant parts, making\nit difficult to apply a consistent 15N offset (Fraser et al., 2011; Rothamsted Research, unpublished\ndata, 1991). There is also a possibility that domestic herbivores may have received supplementary\nfodder in the form of crop residues, which may have been manured. Notwithstanding these limita-\ntions, the estimated herbivore diet gives an approximate indication of the 15N values to expect for\nunmanured crops, allowing some assessment of whether any environment-related enrichment of\ncrop 15N is likely, independent of that resulting from agricultural management. In cases where\nfaunal bones are not found or bone collagen is not well-preserved, or the range in herbivore 15N\nvalues is so large that an unmanaged plant 15N baseline is not meaningful (e.g. Pearson, 2013), an\nindependent means of inferring a plant isotopic baseline for a particular environment is\nnecessary.\nAridity and nitrogen isotope values\nVarious studies of soils and vegetation have found a positive correlation between aridity (low rain-\nfall and high evapotranspiration) and 15N values (e.g. Aranibar et al., 2004; Austin and Vitousek,\net al., 2004). The mechanisms of this enrichment remain speculative, but current hypotheses sug-\ngest that 15N values relate to the `openness' of the nitrogen (N) cycle: the extent to which N is in\nexcess to plant demand and can therefore be lost through volatilization (c.f. Austin and Vitousek,\n1998). Any process that decreases the flux of N into organic matter or increases the flux of N from\norganic matter to mineral pools favours this volatilization and therefore N loss (Handley et al.,\n1999). Both plant growth and microbial activity decrease with decreasing soil moisture, producing\nan excess of readily volatilized mineral-N (Barber, 1995; Stark and Firestone, 1995) whose loss\nincreases the 15N value of the remaining soil-N. This enrichment in soil 15N can be enhanced by\nprogressive cycles of wetting and drying, which also stimulate loss of N in the form of N2\nO and\nNO (Austin et al., 2004). Rainfall thus tends to account for the majority of the variation in 15N\nvalues of unmanaged plants (e.g. Craine et al., 2009; Handley et al., 1999; Hartman and Danin,\n2010; Swap et al., 2004), but the trend is complicated by differences in mychorrhizal interactions\n(Craine et al., 2009), soil texture (Aranibar et al., 2004) and plant type (Gebauer and Ehleringer,\nCrop carbon isotope values\nCrop carbon isotope (13C) values reflect the water status of the crop during its growth period\nplants, differences in plant 13C val-\nues relate to the degree of stomatal conductance, i.e. the rate of passage of CO2\nthrough stomata,\nwhich is regulated according to water availability (Ehleringer et al., 1993; Farquhar et al., 1989).\n6 The Anthropocene Review 3(1)\nIn well-watered conditions, open stomata freely permit the assimilation of CO2\n, allowing dis-\ncrimination against the heavier 13C isotope and resulting in more negative plant 13C values. In\ndrier/poorly watered conditions, closed stomata restrict the assimilation of CO2\n, reducing dis-\ncrimination against 13C and resulting in less negative plant 13C values.\nThe degree of discrimination against 13C varies between species (e.g. Ferrio et al., 2005; Flohr\net al., 2011; Wallace et al., 2013), so that e.g. barley and wheat grown in the same watering condi-\ntions will have different 13C values. Water status itself can be influenced by many factors, includ-\ning water inputs (i.e. rainfall, anthropogenic watering) and water losses (i.e. evapotranspiration), as\nwell as by the water-holding capacity of the soil. For this reason, Wallace et al. (2013) proposed\nthree broad levels of water status based on crop 13C values: poorly watered crops for which water\navailability imposes major limitations on growth; well-watered crops for which water is not a\nmajor limitation on growth; and moderately watered crops which fall between the two.\nWhen using crop 13C values to infer water status of archaeological crop remains, it is also\nnecessary to account for the change in the 13C value of atmospheric carbon dioxide (13Cair\n) over\ntime. Today, the 13Cair\nvalue is c. -8 (White and Vaughn, 2011) but it was higher in the past. The\nvalues for the time periods covered by the archaeobotanical samples were therefore approxi-\nmated by the AIRCO2_LOESS system (Ferrio et al., 2005) and these are given in Wallace et al.\n(2015). This allows the watering bands established from modern crop watering experiments to be\napplied to crop remains from different time periods. Crop 13C values are converted to 13C values\nby the following equation (Farquhar et al., 1989)\n =\nair\nplant\nplant\nC\n - \n\nCrop isotope values in semi-arid regions: A pilot study in Morocco\nThis study determines the 15N and 13C values of hulled six-row barley grains (Hordeum vulgare\nsubsp. vulgare) growing in traditionally managed manured and unmanured fields (n = 34) receiv-\ning different quantities of annual rainfall (190 to 700 mm/yr) and supplementary water from\nTable 1, available online). This isotope study was carried out alongside a weed survey of the same\nfields. Table 1 gives details of the climate, manuring and irrigation regimes, summarized by farm.\nSince these are not experimental plots, better control over manure and water inputs was not pos-\nsible, but these agricultural conditions represent real-life situations, providing an insight into the\nconstraints imposed on agricultural decision making by the environment. No commercial\nN-containing fertilizers were used on any of the plots included in this study and had not been used\nfor at least three years prior to crop sampling. For the most part, interviews were conducted with\nfarmers who tended the fields. The mean annual rainfall quoted is from the Aquastat climate\ninformation tool (http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/climateinfotool/index.stm) from the Food\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The data for the Aquastat climate informa-\ntion tool originated from the CRU CL 2.0 data set (New et al., 2002) and use the means of obser-\nvations made from 1961 to 1990. The aridity index (a numerical indicator of the degree of dryness)\nfor each location was calculated by dividing mean annual precipitation by reference evapotranspi-\nration (Middleton and Thomas, 1997), as quoted by the Aquastat climate information tool. Ten\nears were randomly selected from each field, or were selected from five locations along a transect\nthrough each field. Half of the collected ears were then threshed, and a random selection of 50\nStyring et al. 7\ngrains was homogenized in a freezer mill to give an average isotope value for the growing condi-\ntion. More details of the analytical methods are given in Supplementary Information, available\nonline.\nFigure 2 plots barley grain 15N values against 13C values. Watering bands are defined from\nthose determined for modern two-row hulled barley grains grown under different irrigation regimes\nin Borja, Spain (Wallace et al., 2013), and adjusted for the difference in13C values of two-row and\nsix-row barley growing in the same watering conditions (c. 1; Voltas et al., 1998, 1999). The\nbarley sampled in the Rif region of northern Morocco (Figure 1; AGD and BEL) received no\nmanure and relatively high annual rainfall (703 mm/yr) and growing conditions are classified as\ndry-subhumid from the calculated aridity index (0.58; UNESCO, 1979). Its 13C values fall into\nthe well-watered band (Figure 2) and its relatively low 15N values, ranging from -0.3 to 1.4,\nplot within the no/low manuring band established from modern experimental farms in temperate\nAlso plotted in Figure 3 are the 15N values of bread wheat grains grown in controlled condi-\ntions on newly established plots at an experimental station near Aleppo, Syria (Figure 5 and\nSupplementary Table 1, available online). These bread wheat plots received differing quantities of\nmanure and irrigation water in two separate years of cultivation (see Fraser et al., 2011). There is\nno difference in the 15N values of bread wheat and barley grown under the same manuring condi-\ntions (Fraser et al., 2011), so barley and bread wheat 15N values can be used interchangeably here.\nAs Fraser et al. (2011) note, the effect of manuring on cereal grain 15N values is variable on these\nnewly established plots, with grain 15N values increasing significantly with manuring in the year\nwhen rainfall was higher (2009) but to a much lesser extent when rainfall was low.

Plot of barley and bread wheat 15N values against a natural log scale of mean annual rainfall\nfor their location. Manuring bands established from 15N values of cereals grown in experimental and\ntraditional farming plots in temperate Europe are shown. NB. Aleppo plots were newly established in both\nyears and therefore the effect of manuring on bread wheat 15N values was variable (grey symbols).\nirrigation had no clear effect on bread wheat 15N values (Fraser et al., 2011). These results dem-\nonstrate that the effect of manure on crop 15N values can be detected after the first year of manure\napplication, but the extent to which 15N values increase is variable, likely influenced by changes\nin annual rainfall and past land use.\nThe barley sampled in and around the Amtoudi oasis in southern Morocco (Figure 1) came\nfrom both rainfed and irrigated oasis fields. The rainfed fields are associated with three different\nfarms (AGU, ISS, OMA) situated within 30 km of the oasis, but located at a higher elevation (up\nto c. 1110 m a.s.l. compared with c. 780 m a.s.l.), which means that they receive more rainfall\n(272 mm/yr compared with 194 mm/yr) and can support rainfed crops. Nevertheless, the growing\nconditions are classified as arid by the calculated aridity index (0.19; UNESCO, 1979). The rain-\nfed fields received low quantities of sheep manure every two to three years. The barley 15N\nvalues range from 4.7 to 10.6 (Figure 2), the large variability likely reflecting a wide geo-\ngraphical region and therefore more varied environmental conditions, and considerable variation\nin manuring practice between fields. The barley 13C values (Figure 2) indicate that they were\nrelatively poorly watered, and thus that water was a limitation to growth. Figure 3 shows that the\ndetermined grain 15N values overestimate the level of manuring based on bands established in\ntemperate Europe, since the majority fall within the high manuring band.\nThe fields in the oasis receive lower annual rainfall than the rainfed fields nearby, but they are\nirrigated every 15 days in autumn and every 7 days in summer (a total of 28 times over the growing\nseason), by flooding to the point of saturation with water from an underground aquifer. It has been\ncalculated that irrigation water input equates to c. 70 mm per irrigation cycle and c. 2000 mm/yr (see\nSupplementary Information for calculations, available online). The environmental conditions are\nclassified as arid from the calculated aridity index (0.12; UNESCO, 1979), but if irrigation water\ninput is also considered, the calculated aridity index is 1.42. The oasis fields receive sheep manure\ntwice a year, with each autumn- and summer-sown crop, equating to c. 100 t/ha \u00ad an extremely high\nlevel of manuring that is readily observable in the dark colour and texture of the resulting artificial\nsmaller variation in 15N values compared with the rainfed fields reflecting a much more uniform\nmethod of manuring. The barley 13C values (Figure 2) indicate that they were moderately to well-\nwatered, demonstrating that irrigation inputs were sufficient to prevent water being a limitation to\ngrowth. In Figures 3 and 4, the 15N values of the barley from the oasis fields have been plotted\nagainst a natural log scale of mean annual rainfall for their location. We use mean annual rainfall\nrather than water input (i.e. rainfall + irrigation water) because it acts as an index of wider environ-\nmental conditions (e.g. temperature, evaporation potential), which all affect the `openness' of the N\ncycle and thus the volatilization of 15N-depleted N, resulting in higher plant 15N values. Moreover,\nthe level of irrigation (water input ranging from c. 250 mm/yr to c. 1200 mm/yr on experimental\nplots near Aleppo) has not been found to affect cereal grain 15N values in previous studies (Fraser\net al., 2011). The 15N values of the barley growing in the oasis fields plot correctly within the high\nmanuring level band in Figure 3, but are much higher than the 15N values of any other cereal grains\nDisentangling the effect of manuring from aridity on crop\nIdeally, we would have sampled both manured and unmanured crops from all regions in Morocco\nin order to fully assess the difference in 15N values caused by manuring. However, no fields in the\nRif region studied were manured because of a lack of available manure, and all fields in and around\nthe Amtoudi oasis received some manure input. We have therefore made use of the trend\ndetermined by Hartman and Danin (2010) between 15N values of unmanaged (unmanured) annual\nplants and the natural log scale of mean annual rainfall in order to estimate the expected 15N val-\nues of unmanured cereals at different rainfall levels.\nIn the Hartman and Danin study, unmanaged plants were sampled along a rainfall transect in\nIsrael, from 1000 mm to less than 50 mm mean annual rainfall. The regression for annual plants\n(15N = -3.19[log(mean annual rainfall)] + 19.09) from this study was chosen as the closest com-\nparison to cereals. Furthermore, it ignores the 15N values of plants growing on exposed ridges,\nwhere very low N availability and reliance on atmospheric N-fixation by cyanobacteria leads to\nditions are unlikely to be relevant to arable land. More 15N data from unmanaged cereal grains\ngrowing in different rainfall regimes is needed to refine this relationship further, but this is difficult\nto attain since agriculture in many (semi-)arid regions now involves irrigation and/or artificial\nfertilizers and many of the soils have become too degraded for viable crop yields. In order to relate\nthe 15N values of annual plant leaves determined in the Hartman and Danin study to the 15N\nvalues of cereal grains, the mean offset in 15N between bread wheat grains and leaves from a\nrange of inorganic-N and manure fertilized plots throughout a growing season (1.4 \u00b1 0.9;\nRothamsted Research, unpublished data, 1991) was used to adjust the regression line.\nIn Figure 4, we again plot the barley 15N values against the natural log scale of mean annual\nrainfall. We have used the regression between unmanaged plant 15N values, adjusted for grain-leaf\noffset (15N = -3.19[log(mean annual rainfall)] + 20.49), and the natural log scale of mean annual\nrainfall to adjust the manuring level bands established in temperate Europe. With these adjusted\nmanuring bands, the 15N values of the sampled barley grains more accurately reflect the true\nmanuring levels. The 15N values of barley grains from northern Morocco plot on the regression\nline for no manure, the 15N values of barley from the rainfed fields in southern Morocco plot\nFigure 4. Plot of barley and bread wheat 15N values against a natural log scale of rainfall, with manuring\nbands adjusted for the regression between unmanaged plant 15N values and rainfall.\naround the medium level of manure, and the 15N values of barley from the oasis fields plot in the\nhigh manuring level band. The bread wheat grains from Aleppo also plot within the no/low and\nmedium manuring level bands, which broadly corresponds to the rates of manure applied on these\nnewly established plots. As noted above, manuring of plots in the drier year (2008) at Aleppo did\nnot result in a clear increase in crop 15N values.\nThe adjusted manuring bands more accurately reflect known manuring practices in Morocco\nand Syria and can therefore tentatively be used to assess past manuring practice from crop 15N\nvalues at sites situated in areas with low rainfall. Herbivore bone collagen 15N values can also be\nused to estimate unmanured plant 15N values and therefore further ground truth this model on a\nrange of archaeological sites.\nThe early farming sites of Abu Hureyra and `Ain Ghazal\nTo date, the earliest evidence for crop cultivation has been found in southwest Asia, dating to the\n10th millennium bc (Willcox, 2013). While much research has focused on determining the location\nand date of the earliest crop cultivation and subsequent domestication (e.g. Brown et al., 2009;\npractices involved in this early agriculture. Isotopic analysis of the cereal grains themselves can\nreveal manure inputs (15N) and the water status of the crops (13C). To this end, this study deter-\nmines 15N values of barley grain and pulse seed samples from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B and\nPottery Neolithic periods (PPNB and PN; c. 8800\u00ad6000 cal. bc) of Abu Hureyra and `Ain Ghazal,\nFigure 5. Map showing location of the archaeological sites Abu Hureyra and `Ain Ghazal and the modern\nexperimental station near Aleppo. Present-day annual rainfall is represented by shading. The area of the\nHartman and Danin (2010) study is indicated by the box.\nfocusing on a period when domestic crop cultivation and animal husbandry were newly established\nand potentially integrated (Bogaard, 2005). Each sample represents between 5 and 80 individual\ngrains/seeds, homogenized prior to analysis. The 13C values of the same barley grain and pulse\nseed samples have been determined by Wallace et al. (2015). No faunal isotope data are available\nfrom Abu Hureyra because of poor preservation of bone collagen, but 13C and 15N values of\ncaprine bone collagen (n = 50) from PPN `Ain Ghazal have also been determined previously\ncompare the 15N values of the crop remains determined in this study. The results of these earlier\nisotope studies are summarized in the section `Isotopic composition of fauna and crops from Abu\nHureyra and `Ain Ghazal'.\nAbu Hureyra, on the southern bank of the Euphrates river (Figure 5), is a significant site as its\noccupation spanned the transition from a hunter-forager to farming economy. The site is located at\nthe boundary of two contrasting environmental zones: drier steppe to the south and moist, often\nwaterlogged, floodplain to the north (Moore et al., 2000: 3). Today the site receives c. 230 mm of\nannual rainfall but it has been estimated from 18O values of speleothems in the Soreq Cave that\nthan it is today (Bar-Matthews et al., 1997). We therefore plot the barley 15N values against a\nrange of annual rainfall values between 175 and 450 mm higher than today's rainfall. In this study\nwe focus on Abu Hureyra 2 (c. 8800\u00ad6000 cal. bc), the second phase of occupation, where cultiva-\ntion of domestic crops and herding of domestic animals were the dominant means of subsistence\nfor the sedentary community, although in the earliest period hunting of wild animals was still eco-\nnomically important. Hulled two-row barley grain samples (n = 6) covering all three periods of the\nsite's occupation \u00ad 2A, 2B and 2C \u00ad were selected for isotope analysis.\nnumbers of gazelle were hunted for meat alongside domestic crop cultivation and caprine hus-\nbandry (Legge and Rowley-Conwy, 2000). The crops grown comprise five domesticated cereals\n\u00ad rye, einkorn, emmer, bread wheat, two- and six-row barley \u00ad and at least three pulses \u00ad lentils,\npeas, vetches (De Moulins, 1997). Since both cereals and pulses were major crops, it has been\nsurmised that crop rotation was practised to replenish the soil nutrients (De Moulins, 1997).\nCultivation on the Euphrates floodplain has been dismissed by archaeobotanists working on the\nsite since early cereals are believed to have been autumn-germinating (Hillman, 2000; Jones et al.,\n2013; Miller, 1987) and thus the spring floods caused by snow melt would have washed away the\ncrops before harvest. Wadi sides, breaks of slope and wadi bottoms not prone to flooding could\nhave offered areas for cultivation with enhanced soil moisture but reduced risk of flood damage (cf.\nHillman, 2000). On the other hand, relatively high precipitation levels in the Early Neolithic sug-\ngested by the Soreq Cave speleothem data (Bar-Matthews et al., 1997) may have broadened poten-\ntial cultivation zones beyond these restricted areas and into the steppe. Weed seeds recovered in the\narchaeobotanical assemblage are associated with cultivation on the drier steppe (De Moulins,\n1997), although small-seeded legumes may have been derived from burning of dung.\nregarded as maximum limits, since shifting of the settlement cannot be excluded (Hole, 2000).\nFocus shifted from the hunting of gazelle to the adoption of large-scale herding of sheep and goats\nand the first significant exploitation of cattle (Legge and Rowley-Conwy, 2000). An increase in\ndomesticated cereals and high proportions of weed seeds attest to the continued importance of crop\ncultivation (De Moulins, 1997). Pottery use began at the end of this period. Period 2C (c. 6200 to\n6000 cal. bc) is the beginning of the Pottery Neolithic and saw the continuation of caprine\nexploitation, with cattle and pig husbandry becoming more important. The ubiquity of legumes\ndecreased in this period and it has been tentatively suggested that manure may have been used to\nmaintain soil fertility, replacing the role of the small-seeded legumes in rotation with cereals (De\nMoulins, 1997). The nature of settlement also changed, with buildings spaced further apart and pits\ndug between them (Moore, 2000). The site contracted to c. 8 ha and at the end of this period was\nabandoned.\n`Ain Ghazal is located in modern Jordan (Figure 5). It is situated immediately adjacent to the\nWadi Zarqa, which would have been a permanent stream during the site's occupation, in a transi-\ntion zone between oak woodland and open steppe desert (Simmons et al., 1988). Today the site\nreceives c. 250 mm of annual rainfall, placing it in an area vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall.\nAnalysis of wood charcoal found at the site has indicated the presence of deciduous oak woodland\nin the surroundings, which requires >300 mm rainfall per year and this has been used to infer that\nrainfall must have been at least 100 mm higher during the PPN (Neef, 2004). Again, the barley\n15N values are plotted against a range of rainfall values between 175 and 450 mm higher than\ntoday's rainfall (cf. Bar-Matthews et al., 1997).\nThe archaeobotanical samples included in this study comprise two-row hulled barley grain (n = 9)\nand pulse seed (n = 7) samples, spanning the site's occupation during the Middle and Late PPNB\nHureyra samples. In the MPPNB, herded sheep and goat accounted for the majority of the faunal\nassemblage, but there is evidence that a wide variety of wild animals were also hunted (Von den\nDriesch and Wodtke, 1997; Wasse, 2002). Domesticated cereals and a relatively high proportion of\npulses were found in the archaeobotanical assemblage, with domestic two-row hulled barley,\nemmer and einkorn wheat, peas, lentils and chickpeas found in order of decreasing frequency\n(Neef, 1997). Sickle blades accounted for nearly 10% of the chipped stone tool inventory (Rollefson\nand Simmons, 1988), suggesting the economic importance of crop cultivation. By the beginning of\nthe Late PPNB the site was c. 4\u00ad5 ha, but expanded to around twice that size by c. 7000 cal. bc\n`Ain Ghazal, unlike many sites in the Levant that were abandoned at the end of the PPNB,\nwas occupied into the Yarmoukian phase of the Pottery Neolithic. Nevertheless, from the begin-\nning of the PPNC, the variety of faunal species exploited by the inhabitants of `Ain Ghazal\ndecreased significantly and it has been proposed that this was related to degradation of the sur-\nrounding landscape by removal of the natural vegetation through cultivation, grazing and defor-\n(Bar-Matthews et al., 1999). Although the archaeobotanical samples in this study date to the\nMiddle and Late PPNB, when evidence for landscape degradation is not as advanced as that in\nthe later PPNC, there is the possibility that vegetation and accompanying soil degradation would\nhave impacted the methods of cultivation, or indeed led to adaptations in order to redress the\nnegative impacts of soil erosion on productivity.\nTo summarize, 15N values of hulled barley grain and pulse seed samples from the Early\nNeolithic sites of Abu Hureyra and `Ain Ghazal in the eastern Mediterranean were determined.\nThese derive from both storage and refuse contexts spanning the Middle to Late PPNB and into the\nearly PN, when crop cultivation was likely a mainstay of subsistence but reliance on hunting\nchanged through time. Situated in areas where fluctuations in rainfall could have presented a risk\nto the success of crop cultivation, these sites are a good representation of cultivation in a relatively\ndry region. By placing the crop isotope determinations of barley from these archaeological sites in\nthe framework of our modern study, we hope to constrain interpretation of cultivation practices, in\nparticular water management (considered in Wallace et al., 2015) and manuring, and thus reveal\nmore about the nature and intensity of early agriculture.\nIsotopic composition of fauna and crops from Abu Hureyra and\n`Ain Ghazal\nThe 15N values of archaeological barley grain and pulse seed samples are given in Supplementary\nTable 2, available online, and their corresponding 13C and13C values, as well as the 13Cair\nvalues\nused to calculate the 13C values, can be found in Wallace et al. (2015). As explained in the section\n`Crop carbon isotope values', it is common practice to convert plant 13C values to 13C values, to\nallow comparison between time periods when atmospheric CO2\ndiffered in its isotopic\ncomposition.\nThe determined barley grain 13C values from Abu Hureyra are relatively varied (15.3\u00ad18.7;\nFigure 6), with samples falling predominantly in the moderate- to poorly watered band, with the\nexception of a well-watered outlier with 13C = 18.7 (Wallace et al., 2015). The large variation\nsuggests that barley was cultivated on soils receiving variable water inputs and/or with varying\nwater retention capacity. Although the crop isotope results cannot preclude floodplain cultivation\n(the relatively high 15N values could result from loss of 15N-depleted nitrogen via denitrification\nas a result of seasonal flooding), given the risk posed to crops by spring floods, this variation in\nwater status is more likely to be due to variation in the water retention of soils on the steppe or wadi\nsides. However, since the samples span the site's occupation, this variation could also be due to\ndifferences in annual rainfall over time (Wallace et al., 2015). The range in barley 13C values at\nAbu Hureyra (3.5) is similar to that of the barley grown in rainfed fields in south Morocco\n(3.2; Figure 6), suggesting that variation could indeed have been due to such natural differences\nin the water retention of soils in the vicinity of the site.\nThe 15N values of barley grains from Abu Hureyra are relatively high, ranging from 6.4 to\n10.4 (Figure 6). Without faunal 15N data it is not possible to estimate the 15N values of unman-\naged plants in this region, but by plotting the Abu Hureyra barley 15N values against the natural\nlog scale of the range of estimated past annual rainfall, it is possible to estimate the effect of aridity\nto some extent (Figure 7). The values plot within the high band of manuring at all annual rainfall\nvalues. There is no clear chronological difference in the 15N values and the low sample number\nprecludes any statistical analysis. Some degree of manure application therefore cannot be excluded\nat Abu Hureyra during the PPNB and PN. However, it is possible that the relatively high crop 15N\nvalues were due to cultivation in soils that experienced temporary waterlogging and thus denitrifi-\ncation, such as on floodplains and wadi slopes (cf. Hartman and Danin, 2010). More work is\nneeded to characterize crop growing conditions in such temporarily waterlogged soils and this\nshould incorporate a multi-isotope approach, alongside weed ecological data, in order to distin-\nguish different potential contributions to elevated crop 15N values (e.g. manuring and/or seasonal\nwaterlogging).\nThe 15N values of these barley grains dating to the PPNB and PN are not significantly lower\nthan those of individual rye grains (8.7\u00ad11.1; p = 0.113) dating to the Epipalaeolithic (deter-\nmined by Araus et al., 2014), despite the >1500 year gap between their deposition. The authors\nhave suggested that the high 15N values of these rye grains are due to them growing on `dump-\nheaps', which likely had higher 15N values than the surrounding soils. The climate is also believed\nto have been drier than the succeeding PPN (Bar-Matthews et al., 1997). This demonstrates that if\ndecreasing fertility of soils in the wider region was leading to decreasing crop 15N over time (cf.\nAraus et al., 2014), soil conditions were being managed in some way at Abu Hureyra in the PPNB,\nmaintaining higher crop 15N values than those expected for unmanaged plants.\nGhazal (MPPNB to PPNC) have been determined by Miller (2012) and Makarewicz (2007). The\na mean of 8.9. There was no statistical difference in 15N values between the chronological\nphases of the PPNB, but Miller observed that both the 13C and 15N values of caprines from the\nPPNC (n = 9) were higher than the PPNB. She interprets this as evidence for greater consumption\nplants growing in more arid environments (Miller, 2012). The inferred mean unmanaged\nplant 15N value estimated from the faunal bone collagen is 4.9. This can be compared with the\n15N values of the barley grains in this study and also to the regression line of 15N against natural\nlog transformed rainfall determined from the Hartman and Danin (2010) study (Figure 7). The fact\nthat the estimated faunal plant diet 15N value plots in the medium band of manuring suggests that\nthe herbivores were consuming plants growing in areas of the landscape where loss of N was\nenhanced, perhaps in seasonally wet stream beds where moisture levels and therefore plants remain\ninto the summer months (Hartman and Danin, 2010). This highlights the benefit of considering\nherbivore bone collagen 15N values in relation to the regression of plant 15N values and rainfall\nin order to identify potential feeding strategies that could bias the unmanaged plant 15N baseline\nvalue.\nThere is very little variation in the 13C values of barley grain samples from `Ain Ghazal (16.7\u00ad\n17.3; Figure 6; Wallace et al., 2015). This range is as tight as that determined in modern barley\ngrown under the same water conditions (Wallace et al., 2013), suggesting that farmers at `Ain\nGhazal had strict control over water availability, possibly through the use of the spring and flood-\nplains close to the site. Their 13C values fall into the moderately watered band, again consistent\nwith a degree of intentional watering to improve their water status. The floodplain at `Ain Ghazal\nis very limited in extent and thus unlikely to have supported enough crop cultivation to provide the\nFigure 6. Plot of 15N against 13C values of barley grain from Abu Hureyra and `Ain Ghazal, with\nmodern barley grain isotope values plotted for reference. The watering bands for 2-row rather than 6-row\nbarley are marked, to allow for comparison with archaeological 2-row barley 13C values.\npopulation of the 5\u00ad10 ha settlement. It seems therefore that well-watered conditions were main-\ntained elsewhere, possibly on terraced fields close to the spring. The 15N values of barley grains\nfrom `Ain Ghazal are relatively low, ranging from 1.2 to 5.6 (Figure 6). The barley 15N val-\nues are similar to or lower than the unmanaged plant 15N baseline estimated from the faunal 15N\ndata (4.9), suggesting that the barley was growing in soil with a lower 15N value than plants\nconsumed by herbivores. When the `Ain Ghazal barley samples are plotted against the natural log\nscale of the range of estimated past annual rainfall, they plot within the low-medium bands of\nmanuring (Figure 7), implying that any manuring input was minimal.\nThe 13C and 15N values of pulses from `Ain Ghazal (n = 7) have also been determined\n(Supplementary Table 2, available online). The 13C values are relatively varied and fall within the\nmoderate- to poorly watered band (Wallace et al., 2015). The greater variation in pulse 13C values\ncompared with barley could be because pulses tend to be more sensitive than cereals to water short-\nages during seed filling (Brouwer et al., 1989), so variation in water availability during this growth\nperiod would result in greater variation in pulse compared with barley 13C values. The pulse 15N\nvalues range from 0.9 to 2.3, which is close to but slightly higher than the 15N value of\natmospheric-N (Yoneyama et al., 1986), and this indicates that they indeed received the majority\nof their N from N-fixation. The slight elevation of pulse seed 15N values over that of atmospheric-\nN could indicate some uptake of soil-N, which is more favourable when the concentration of soil\ninorganic-N is high (e.g. in manured soils; Streeter and Wong, 1988; Waterer and Vessey, 1993).\nThus we see evidence for two different strategies of crop cultivation in the PPNB and early PN,\nalthough greater numbers of crop samples for isotope analysis would be needed to characterize\nthese more fully. At Abu Hureyra, barley was grown in rainfed fields whose soils varied in their\nwater-holding capacity, with organic matter levels equivalent to high manuring rates, potentially\nFigure 7.

The 15N values of\nmodern barley and bread wheat grains from Morocco and Syria are plotted for reference.\nrelating to dung from the domestic sheep and goats herded in the vicinity of the site. At `Ain\nGhazal, farmers seemed to have had strict control over the water status of their barley, possibly\nthrough watering their crops from the spring. There is no evidence for intensive manuring at the\nsite, possibly because sheep and goats were herded away from the settlement (cf. K\u00f6hler-Rollefson\nand Rollefson, 1990), or periodic grazing of sheep and goats on arable fields did not result in high\nlevels of manuring (cf. Bogaard and Isaakidou, 2010). The relatively high frequency of pulses\nrecovered from the site could also reflect the practice of cereal\u00adpulse rotation, which would have\nhelped to replenish soil nutrients.\nConclusions\nAlthough a relatively small modern pilot study, the 15N values of barley grains growing in fields in\npresent-day Morocco have provided a framework for reconstructing past farming practices, in areas\nwhere a (semi-)arid environment complicates the manuring 15N signal. We use the regression line\nestablished by Hartman and Danin (2010) between unmanaged annual plant 15N values and the natu-\nral log of annual rainfall to assess the relative importance of manuring at two early farming sites.\nTaken together, the material evidence from archaeological sites and crop isotope values can constrain\nscenarios of early farming practice. For example, low crop 15N values preclude intensive manuring\nat `Ain Ghazal, which is consistent with the theory that the high frequency of pulses at the site is\nlinked to maintenance of soil fertility. By contrast, the relatively high 15N values of barley from Abu\nHureyra cannot exclude the possibility of manuring as a means of maintaining soil fertility, although\nit is possible that cultivation of temporarily waterlogged soils (wadi bottoms and slopes) contributed\nto these high 15N values. In both situations, however, the importance of manuring inferred from crop\n15N values would have been overestimated using the manuring level bands established for temperate\nEurope, rather than the framework developed here. This study provides the basis upon which to carry\nout further 15N value determinations of modern cereal grains at other locations \u00ad and particularly on\nfloodplains \u00ad to refine this framework, further constraining interpretations of possible farming\nregimes. The emerging evidence for crop growing conditions and early farming practices in western\nAsia presented here, as in Neolithic regimes in Europe (e.g. Bogaard et al., 2013), suggests that the\nflexibility of the early farming `package' of cereals, pulses and livestock enabled communities to\ndevelop contrasting strategies to adapt to different ecological and social settings.\n"
