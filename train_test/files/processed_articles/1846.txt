Infec-\ntions with low-risk types, such as HPV\ntypes 6 and 11, can cause benign or low-\ngrade changes in cells of the cervix,\ngenital warts, and recurrent respira-\ntory papillomatosis. High-risk HPV\ntypes can cause cervical, anal, and other\ngenital cancers. High-risk HPV types are\ndetected in 99% of cervical cancers, and\nworldwide approximately 70% of cer-\nvical cancers are due to HPV types 16\ncommon, studies suggest approxi-\nmately 90% of infections clear within\nA highly efficacious prophylactic\nrecommended for routine use in\nthe quadrivalent HPV vaccine demon-\nstrated close to 100% efficacy in pre-\nventing infection and disease (cervical\ncancer precursors, genital lesions)\nassociated with types included in the\nvaccine in analyses restricted to those\nwomen who were naive to HPV types\nor HPV antibodies).\nRepresentative data on type-\nspecific prevalence of HPV DNA\ndetection in the United States could\nprovide a baseline estimate to mea-\nSee also p 876 and Patient Page.\nAuthor Affiliations: Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, Atlanta, Ga (Drs Unger and Swan, and Ms\nPatel); and National Center for Health Statistics, Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention, Bethesda, Md\n(Dr McQuillan).\nCorresponding Author:  ,\nCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention,1600Clifton\nContext Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is estimated to be the most com-\nmon sexually transmitted infection. Baseline population prevalence data for HPV in-\nfection in the United States before widespread availability of a prophylactic HPV vac-\ncine would be useful.\nObjective To determine the prevalence of HPV among females in the United States.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants The National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES) uses a representative sample of the US noninstitutionalized ci-\nvilian population. Females aged 14 to 59 years who were interviewed at home for\nself-collected vaginal swab specimen. Swabs were analyzed for HPV DNA by L1 con-\nsensus polymerase chain reaction followed by type-specific hybridization. Demo-\ngraphic and sexual behavior information was obtained from all participants.\nMain Outcome Measures HPV prevalence by polymerase chain reaction.\nResults The overall HPV prevalence was 26.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 23.3%-\na statistically significant trend for increasing HPV prevalence with each year of age\nfrom 14 to 24 years (P.001), followed by a gradual decline in prevalence through\nrisk types) were detected in 3.4% of female participants; HPV-6 was detected in 1.3%\nticipants. Independent risk factors for HPV detection were age, marital status, and in-\ncreasing numbers of lifetime and recent sex partners.\nConclusions HPV is common among females in the United States. Our data indi-\ncate that the burden of prevalent HPV infection among females was greater than pre-\nvious estimates and was highest among those aged 20 to 24 years. However, the preva-\nlence of HPV vaccine types was relatively low.\nsure the wide-scale impact of the vac-\ncine for reducing infection and could\nhelp guide models evaluating impact\nand cost effectiveness. With wide-\nspread implementation of the pro-\nphylactic HPV vaccine, decreases in\nthe prevalence of vaccine HPV types\nwould be expected. To determine a\nprevaccine population-based preva-\nlence of cervicovaginal HPV in the\nUnited States, we performed HPV\nDNA testing on self-collected vaginal\nswabs among females participating in\nthe National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES)\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nand Study Design\nNHANES is conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics,\nCenters for Disease Control and Pre-\nvention, and uses a representative\nsample of the US noninstitutionalized\ncivilian population. The representative\nsample is obtained by using a com-\nplex, stratified, multistage probability\nsample design with unequal probabili-\nties of selection to obtain a nationally\nrepresentative sample.15 Certain sub-\ngroups of people, such as adolescents,\nnon-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican\nAmericans are oversampled. All\nfor participation in this study. Of 2482\nined in a mobile examination center. A\nted cervicovaginal swab specimens.\nFour hundred sixty-six females\n(23.0%) were considered nonre-\nsponders because they either submit-\nted an inadequate swab specimen\n(n=105) or they did not submit a\nswab specimen (n=361). There were\nsignificant differences between nonre-\nsponders and responders on some\ndemographic and behavioral variables\n(nonresponders were significantly\nmore likely than responders to be of\nother race/ethnicity, to be younger\n[40 years], to be born outside the\nUnited States or Mexico, and to have\nnever had sex). Written informed con-\nsent was obtained from all partici-\npants, and parental permission for\nthose females younger than 18 years.\nThis human subjects research was\napproved by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention institutional\nreview board.\nDemographic and Behavioral Data\nRace and ethnicity were self-reported\ninto categories, including non-\nHispanic black, non-Hispanic white,\nand Mexican American. Poverty index\nratio was calculated by dividing total\nfamily income by the poverty thresh-\nold index, adjusted for family size at\nyear of interview.16 Estimates of the\ntotal number of cases were generated\nby multiplying the appropriate popu-\nmonthly postcensal civilian noninsti-\ntutionalized population17 by the\nweighted prevalence estimate among\nfemales in the appropriate age\ncategory.\nSex was defined as vaginal, oral, or\nanal sex. For those females who had at\nleast 1 lifetime sex partner, additional\nquestions were asked on age of first sex\nand lifetime number of sex partners. For\nwere sexually active, additional ques-\ntions about sexual behavior were asked,\nincluding age at first sex, number of life-\ntime partners, and ever use of a con-\ndom. For women aged 18 years or older\nwho were sexually active, additional\nquestions were asked on number and\ngender of sex partners in the last 12\nmonths and lifetime sex partners, and\npast history of sexually transmitted in-\nfections.\nSpecimen Collection\nand Processing\nasked to self-collect a cervicovaginal\nsample in the mobile examination\ncenter. In brief, each female was given\na collection device, which was a small\nfoam swab on a plastic handle pack-\naged in an individual reclosable plastic\nsleeve (Catch-All Sample Collection\nSwabs Epicenter, Madison, Wis). Par-\nticipants were instructed to wash their\nhands before opening the swab, to\nhold the swab by the end of the\nhandle, to insert the foam swab into\nthe vagina similar to inserting a tam-\npon, to gently turn the swab during a\ncount of 10, and to replace the swab in\nthe plastic sleeve, avoiding contact\nwith the external genitalia. Partici-\npants took swabs and instructions into\na bathroom and collected the samples\nin privacy. Swabs were given to\nNHANES personnel, stored at room\ntemperature, and mailed to the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion laboratory for processing.\nDNA Isolation\nDNA was extracted using slight modi-\nfications of the QIAmp Mini Kit pro-\ntocol (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) within\n1 month of sample collection. Briefly,\nswabs were incubated at 56\u00b0C for at\nleast 12 hours in proteinase K lysis so-\nlution. One half of each sample was\nadded to an equal volume of 100% etha-\nnol and applied to each of 2 QIAmp\nMini columns for DNA isolation. The\neluates were collected, washed, and\nconcentrated in Microcon 100 concen-\ntrators (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,\nPa), adjusting the final volume to 100\n\u00b5L with deionized distilled water.\nSamples were tested immediately or\na water blank was processed through\nall steps of extraction to serve as a con-\ntamination control.\nHPV Genotyping Test\nHPV detection and typing was per-\nformed by using the Roche prototype\nline blot assay (reagents provided as a\ngift from Roche Molecular Systems Inc,\nPleasanton, Calif). This assay uses HPV\nL1 consensus polymerase chain reac-\nprimer sets and -globin as an inter-\nnal control for sample amplifica-\nin the 100-\u00b5L polymerase chain reac-\ntion. Amplicons (10 \u00b5L) were evalu-\nated for -globin and HPV bands with\n1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis stained\nwith ethidium bromide, and those am-\nplicons with an HPV band were hy-\nbridized to the typing strips. The first\n84). The second generation strip used\nSamples that did not hybridize the strip\nwere sequenced as previously de-\nscribed to determine HPV type.21\nSamples negative for both -globin and\ninadequate for interpretation and were\nomitted from further analysis. We con-\nsidered low-risk HPV types as HPV type\nand high-risk HPV types as HPV type\nStatistical Analysis\nFemales who submitted an adequate\nswab for HPV evaluation were in-\nStatistical analyses were conducted\nable SUDAAN.23 Variance estimates\nwere calculated by using a Taylor se-\nries linearization that incorporated the\ncomplex sample design of the sur-\nvey.24 All estimates were weighted using\nweights provided by National Center for\nHealth Statistics to account for the un-\nequal probabilities of selection and ad-\njustment for nonresponse. The weight-\ning methodology has been described\npreviously.25 Because there were some\nmissing laboratory specimens, we in-\nvestigated whether any additional non-\nresponse adjustments to the original\nNHANES weights were needed. We\nfound that using weights with an ad-\nditional nonresponse and poststratifi-\ncation adjustment always provided\nprevalence estimates within the 95%\nconfidence interval (CI) based on the\noriginal NHANES weight; therefore, no\nadditional adjustments to the NHANES\nweights were made.\nWe considered a prevalence esti-\nmate unreliable if the relative SE was\nmore than 30% of the prevalence esti-\nmate; these estimates are not pre-\nsented. Confidence intervals were cal-\nculated by using a log transformation\nwith the SE of the log prevalence based\non the delta method and applying\nSUDAAN estimated SEs.26 Tests of as-\nsociation between HPV and the demo-\ngraphic or behavioral characteristics\nwere based on the Wald 2 statistic. To\ncompare the prevalence between HPV\ntypes, we applied a version of the\nMcNemar test for complex surveys. No\nadjustments were made to the P val-\nues for multiple comparisons.\nTo explore the association with age\nandoverallHPVprevalence,agewascat-\nlogoddsofHPV.Theplotrevealedanon-\nlinear association between age and HPV\nprevalence. Prevalence increased up to\nTo test for the presence of an increasing\nlinear trend among those females\nyounger than 24 years and a decreasing\nlinear trend for those females older than\n24 years, 2 separate logistic regressions\nwere used. Each logistic regression\ntreated age as a continuous variable and\nwas restricted to the age range under in-\nvestigation. A trend was considered sta-\ntistically significant if the  coefficient\nfor the independant variable was non-\nzeroatP.05,usingtheSatterthwaitead-\njusted F test.\nDemographic and behavioral char-\nacteristics of participants were evalu-\nated. Characteristics significant at the\nP.20 level based on a Wald 2 statis-\ntic were considered in a multivariate\nmodel. There are only 15 df available\nto develop a multivariate model, due\nto the complex survey design in the\n2-year cycle of NHANES. To limit the\ndf used when including age in the\nmodel, we collapsed age into 4 catego-\nyears), because the prevalences for age\nyears did not differ significantly. The\nmultivariate model was limited to\nquestions regarding sexual exposures\nwere asked of this group. We used\nSUDAAN for logistic regression to\nmodel independent associations\nbetween prevalence of any HPV and\ndemographic and behavioral variables\namong sexually active females aged 18\nto 59 years. We eliminated variables in\na backward fashion that did not meet\nthe criteria of P.05 by Satterthwaite\nadjusted F test at each step. Any par-\nticipants with missing data on vari-\nables included in the multivariate\nanalysis were excluded. Once all vari-\nables in the model were statistically\nsignificant at the P.05 level, all pair-\nwise interactions were evaluated and\nretained only if the overall P value for\nthe interaction was .05. Goodness of\nfit for the final step of the model was\nassessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow\nSatterthwaite adjusted F test.\nRESULTS\nHPV DNA Prevalence Overall\nand by Age\nspecimens from female NHANES par-\nwere positive for any HPV DNA.

Race/\nethnicity was not significant in the mul-\ntivariate model. Increasing numbers of\nrecent sex partners was more strongly\nassociated with HPV detection than was\nlifetime sex partners.

This prevalence cor-\nresponds with 7.5 million females with\nHPV infection, which is higher than the\nprevious estimate of 4.6 million preva-\nlent HPV infections among females in\nthis same age group in the United\nStates.1 The overall prevalences of high-\nWe found that the prevalence of\nHPV infection increased from 14 years\nthrough 24 years, and then decreased\nat older ages. Most evaluations in the\nUnited States have found that the\nprevalence of any HPV was highest in\nthe younger age groups (20 years).\nManhart et al6 in a population-based\nassessment of sexually active 18- to\n25-year-old women using a urine\nsample found the prevalence of HPV-6\n25-year-old women in our study, the\n30%) was similar to that found by\nManhart et al,6 and the prevalence of\nlower. These differences may be due\nto differences in the type of test used\nfor the HPV detection, differences in\nthe study population, or both.\nFigure 2.

In most\nother studies, HPV-16 has been found\nto be the most prevalent type, al-\nthough prevalence varied based on the\npopulation evaluated. Population-\nbased studies outside the United States\nhave found lower prevalence of HPV-16\nthan clinic-based studies have.28 It is\npossible that our cervicovaginal assess-\nment using the self-collected vaginal\nswabs was more likely to detect HPV\ntypes not related to cervical infection.\nCastle et al28 hypothesized that there is\ntropism of some phylogenetic group-\nassessment, the most common types de-\nin the A3 phylogenetic grouping. Man-\nwere also frequently detected in urine\nyears.\nIndependent risk factors for HPV\nDNA detection in our analysis in-\ncluded sexual behavior (number of sex\npartners in the last year, number of life-\ntime sex partners) and demographic\nvariables, including young age and\nmarital status, consistent with risk fac-\ntors for HPV detection found in other\nstudies.\nHPV DNA was detected in approxi-\nmately 5% of women in our study who\nreported never having had sex. In an\nunweighted analysis of these women,\nwe found that most were young in age\nand some had other sexually transmit-\nted infections, suggesting their self-\nreported sexual history may not be ac-\ncurate. Genital HPV is primarily\nassociated with sexual intercourse;\nhowever, 1 study3 found that nonpen-\netrative sexual contact, such as genital-\ngenital contact, could also result in HPV\ntransmission. A detailed sexual his-\ntory was not collected, therefore, we\ncould not evaluate specific types of\nsexual contact.\nThe 84.9% response rate (number of\ncollected swabs/number of eligible\ncollection in our study suggests that the\nself-collected swabs were a feasible and\neffective method for HPV DNA detec-\ntion in a large survey. Previous assess-\nments of the acceptability of self-\ncollected vaginal swabs found this\ncollection method to be more accept-\nable than specimens collected by health\ncare professionals.29,30 Evaluations have\nalso demonstrated a high correlation of\nHPV DNA detection, both high-risk and\nlow-risk types, in self-collected swabs\ncompared with swabs collected by\nhealth care professionals.31-35 There are\nfew studies comparing correlation of\nspecific HPV types. Available studies on\ntype-specific correlations suggest dif-\nferent types may be detected from these\nspecimens, although a strong correla-\ntion, at least in 1 study, existed for HPV\nevaluations in the general US popula-\ntion using self-collected swabs preclud-\ning a direct comparison of our data with\nthose from other studies.\nThere were several limitations to\nour study. Nonresponders were sig-\nnificantly different from responders\nby certain demographic characteris-\ntics (race, age, country of birth, and\never had sex) and this could bias\nprevalence estimates; however, as\nnoted, evaluations of the weighted\nprevalence estimates taking the non-\nresponders into consideration did\nnot substantially change our point\nestimates. A self-collected cervico-\nvaginal sample was obtained, which\nmay not detect the same HPV types\nas cervical mucosa samples obtained\nby health care professionals. Also,\nHPV DNA point prevalence will most\ncertainly underestimate cumulative\nincidence as many infections clear9,10;\nthis assessment only measures cur-\nrent infection and does not indicate\npast exposure to HPV. A study in a\nprevious NHANES sample found\noverall HPV-16 seroprevalence in\nfemales to be 17.9%, with the preva-\nolds.36 Seroprevalence provides a bet-\nter estimate of cumulative exposure.\nThe difference between the seroprev-\nalence found in that study and the\ncurrent DNA prevalence in our study\nreflects the high clearance of HPV\ninfections.
