The control of blood pressure\n(BP) is crucial in the prevention of these adverse outcomes.\nHowever, hypertension can be asymptomatic, so many people\nwith hypertension do not see a doctor. The detection and\ncontrol of BP is, thus, a major public health challenge in the\nUnited States. The National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ntion Survey (NHANES)2 is a large health and nutritional\nsurvey of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the\nUnited States and is very useful for monitoring trends in the\nhealth status of the population that arise as a result of public\nhealth measures or changes in clinical practice. In NHANES\n68.9% of people with hypertension were aware of the\nthe BP controlled.3 We reported previously a nonsignificant\ntrend of improvement in the BP control rate among people\nBP goal for hypertensive patients with diabetes has changed\nbecome available. Here, we analyzed the trends in the\nprevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension\nwhether there are further improvements in hypertension\ncontrol according to the current treatment goals.\nMethods\nNHANES was conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics\nof the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.2 A stratified,\nmultistage probability sampling design was used in the survey. The\ndetailed measurement procedures and protocols have been described\nin previous publications and also on its website.6\u00ad8 Since 1999,\nNHANES has become a continuous survey program. The 1999\u00ad\n2004 results are available online. All of the participants gave\ninformed consent, and the study received approval from the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention Institutional Review Board.\nBP was measured 3 or 4 times manually by a trained operator\nusing a mercury sphygmomanometer according to a standard proto-\ncol and calculated as the average after excluding the first measure-\nment.9 The BP measurement techniques were identical over the 3\n(BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square\nof height in meters. Individuals aged 18 years were included in the\nanalysis (n17 061). Participants who were interviewed but not\nexamined were excluded from analysis (n1190). Those with\nmissing data on BP or BMI were also excluded (n1218).\nHypertension was defined as an average BP 140/90 mm Hg or if\nthe participant was taking antihypertensive medications.

The prevalence of\nhypertension has not increased significantly since 1999. At\nthe same time, there has been increasing control rate of\nhypertension, especially in Mexican American men, elderly,\nand obese people. The lack of increased prevalence of\nhypertension may be because of the lack of a further increase\nin BMI in the population, although there was an increase in\nwaist circumference. Better publicity and education and effort\nfrom health professionals may be another reason for this. The\nincrease in BP control rates may be the result of clinical\nguidelines on the management of hypertension5 rather than\nimproved antihypertensive drugs, because there were no new\nmajor antihypertensive drugs introduced in this period. Public\nhealth measures and intensified antihypertensive treatment\nseem to be effective in improving BP control rates. The latest\nhypertension management guidelines recommended the use\nof diuretics as first-line antihypertensive medications for\nuncomplicated hypertension and the use of multiple antihy-\npertensive drugs to control BP.5,16 A recent report revealed an\nincrease in the use of antihypertensive medications in men\nconverting enzyme inhibitor among hypertensive patients\nwith diabetes, congestive heart failure, and heart attack.17\nThis was consistent with current guidelines.5,16 The use of\ndiuretics also increased shortly after the release of new\nevidence on the clinical equivalence of diuretics to calcium\nchannel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-\nthat most hypertensive patients require multiple antihyperten-\nsive drugs to control BP.20\u00ad23 The readiness to use multiple\ndrugs may explain the increase in BP control rates in\nThe awareness and control rates of hypertension were\nbetter in older people and people with higher BMI, whereas\nthere was relative undertreatment of hypertensive people of\nyounger age and lower BMI. This may be because of greater\nconcerns in health status among older and obese people. The\nsignificant increase in waist circumference but not weight and\nBMI suggests an increasing trend of abdominal obesity.

Clinicians need to overcome clinical inertia and\nstep up treatment to reach the BP target. Other than antihy-\npertensive medication, lifestyle interventions should also be\nencouraged in hypertensive patients.30\nAccording to the national goal of Healthy People 2010, the\nproportion of adults with high BP should be reduced to 16%,\nand the proportion of adults with high BP whose BP is under\ncontrol should be reduced to 50%.31 It seems unlikely,\nbecause of the aging population, that the proportion of adults\nwith hypertension can be reduced to 16%. However, the\nimprovement in BP control rates in the last few years is\nhighly encouraging, suggesting that, with concerted effort\nfrom health professionals and the government agencies, the\nRecent clinical trials showed that a high BP control rate of\n66% to 71% could be achieved in some settings and environ-\ncrease in the age-adjusted rate of BP control in patients under\nclose to the control rates of 70% to 80% found in clinical\namong treated hypertensive patients with diabetes from\nnificant, but this is still in need of substantial improvement. In\nwere unaware of their hypertension, and our efforts to detect\nhypertension need to be improved. The treatment rate among\nhypertensive patients was only 53.7%. Therefore, approxi-\nmately half of the hypertensive subjects were not being\ntreated. To meet Healthy People 2010, the greatest attention\nmust be paid to this group. In countries with limited resources\nlike Cuba, very good BP control can be achieved through\ninvestment in the training of health professionals, availability\nof locally manufactured drugs, and more aggressive policy at\nthe primary care level.34 Therefore, there is room for further\nimprovement in the control of hypertension in the United\nStates.\nStudies using a BP goal of 140/90 mm Hg in hyperten-\nsive people with diabetes might overestimate BP control\ngoals were used for those with and without diabetes to\nproduce a more accurate control rate. However, there are\nsome limitations in our study. The BP goal for hypertensive\npatients with diabetes was changed from 130/85 mm Hg to\npeople with diabetes might seem poor before 2003. Inaccu-\nracies in estimating BP control rates in the diabetic popula-\ntion might also arise from not classifying diabetic people with\nprehypertension as hypertensive, although they may require\nantihypertensive medications to bring their BP to 130/\n80 mm Hg. The limited sample sizes for each 2-year period\nmade the estimates in some subgroups less reliable and made\nit difficult to study interactions between factors such as age,\nsex, and race/ethnicity. Estimates of prevalence are substan-\ntially affected by age adjustment. The age distribution of the\nUS general population, used for the adjustment standard, is\nmuch younger than the hypertensive population, so the\nadjustment emphasizes the estimates among the younger\npopulation. A better standard population might be the age\ndistribution of those with hypertension, such as for the entire\nTABLE 6.
