    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nTo examine the mechanisms of drug relapse, we first\nestablished a model for cocaine IVSA (intravenous self-\nadministration) in mice, and subsequently examined elec-\ntrophysiological alterations of MSNs (medium-sized spiny\nneurons) in the NAc (nucleus accumbens) before and after\nacute application of cocaine in slices. Three groups were in-\ncluded: master mice trained by AL (active lever) pressings\nfollowed by IV (intravenous) cocaine delivery, yoked mice\nthat received passive IV cocaine administration initiated by\npaired master mice, and saline controls. MSNs recorded in\nthe NAc shell in master mice exhibited higher membrane\ninput resistances but lower frequencies and smaller ampli-\ntudes of sEPSCs (spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic cur-\nrents) compared with neurons recorded from saline control\nmice, whereas cells in the NAc core had higher sEPSCs fre-\nquenciesandlargeramplitudes.Furthermore,sEPSCsinMSNs\nof the shell compartment displayed longer decay times, sug-\ngesting that both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms were\ninvolved. After acute re-exposure to a low-dose of cocaine\nin vitro, an AP (action potential)-dependent, persistent in-\ncrease in sEPSC frequency was observed in both NAc shell and\ncore MSNs from master, but not yoked or saline control mice.\nFurthermore, re-exposure to cocaine induced membrane hy-\nperpolarization, but concomitantly increased excitability of\nr r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r\n1 Present address: Department of Neuroscience, University of Pittsburgh, A210 Langley Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, U.S.A.\n2 To whom correspondence should be addressed (email ccepeda@mednet.ucla.edu).\nAbbreviations: AHP, afterhyperpolarization; AL, active lever; BIC, bicuculline; Coc, cocaine; CsMeth, Cs-Methanesulfonate; FR, fixed ratio; GABA, -aminobutyric acid; IAL,\ninactive lever; IC, current clamp; IVSA, intravenous self-administration; KGluc, K-gluconate internal solution; mEPSCs, miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents; MSNs,\nmedium-sized spiny neurons; NAc, nucleus accumbens; Rin, resistance; rm, repeated measure; RMP, resting membrane potential; sEPSCs, spontaneous excitatory\npostsynaptic currents; sIPSCs, spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents; Thr, threshold; TTX, tetrodotoxin; VC, voltage clamp.\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY)\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nMSNs from master mice, as evidenced by increased mem-\nbrane input resistance, decreased depolarizing current to\ngenerate APs, and a more negative Thr (threshold) for firing.\nThese data demonstrate functional differences in NAc MSNs\nafter chronic contingent versus non-contingent IV cocaine\nadministration in mice, as well as synaptic adaptations of\nMSNs before and after acute re-exposure to cocaine.

ASN NEURO\n Key words: intravenous self-administration, nucleus\naccumbens, relapse, synaptic transmission.\nINTRODUCTION\nRelapse, the major challenge in the treatment of drug abuse,\nhas been modeled in rodents by reinstatement of extin-\nguished drug-seeking behaviors (Steketee and Kalivas, 2011).\nSimilar to humans, this phenomenon can be precipitated\nby exposure to a small dose of the abused drug. Local\nadministration of cocaine into the NAc (nucleus accum-\nbens) reinstated drug-seeking, whereas microinjection into\nthe dorsal striatum or lateral septum did not (Park et al.,\n2002), showing that the drug's effects on the behavior are\nY.Y. Ma and others\nanatomically specific. Using a reinstatement model, in con-\njunction with inactivation of different pathways involved in\ndrug addiction, the neural circuitry involved in reinstatement\nof drug-seeking has been mapped (Kalivas and McFarland,\n2003). In this circuit, reinstatement pathways converge onto\na final common output through the NAc.\nChronic cocaine-induced functional alterations in the NAc\ncontribute to cocaine-elicited addiction behavior, includ-\ning drug-primed relapse to previously abused drugs (Hy-\nman et al., 2006). Extensive efforts have been directed at\nelucidating neuroadaptations of MSNs (medium-sized spiny\nneurons), the principal cell type in the NAc, after chronic ex-\nposure to either non-contingent (response-independent) or\ncontingent (response-dependent) administration of cocaine\n(reviewed by Wolf, 2010). MSNs in the NAc receive excitatory\ninputs from the pre-/infra-limbic cortex, ventral subiculum\nand basolateral amygdala (Voorn et al., 2004; Sesack and\nGrace, 2009), mixed excitatory and inhibitory neuromodula-\ntion from dopaminergic neurons and inhibitory inputs from\nlocal and afferent GABAergic circuits (Voorn et al., 2004;\nYan and Nabeshima, 2009). Although there are some reports\non the influence of chronic cocaine exposure on inhibitory\nsynaptic adaptations (Meshul et al., 1998; Kushner and Un-\n2008a, b), growing evidence supports adaptions in glutamate\nreceptor-mediated synaptic activity after chronic cocaine ad-\nministration. Thus, AMPA (-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-\nisoxazole-propionic acid) receptors are up-regulated at NAc\nsynapses after withdrawal from cocaine administration (Wolf,\nThe two major determinants of the functional output of\nNAc MSNs, i.e., synaptic transmission and intrinsic membrane\nexcitability, have been extensively examined after cocaine\n1 week) from either non-contingent or contingent cocaine,\na decreased intrinsic excitability of MSNs has been demon-\nlonger withdrawal period from cocaine exposure with a non-\ncontingent cocaine history, a decrease in intrinsic excitability\noccurs in MSNs, at least in the shell compartment. How-\never, previous studies have also suggested that the effects of\ncontingent and non-contingent cocaine administration may\ndiffer quantitatively or qualitatively, which could limit the\ngenerality and validity of laboratory studies that use primar-\nily non-contingent administration (Winsauer et al., 2003).\nOnly a handful of studies have examined the functional out-\nput of NAc MSNs in the cocaine contingent administration\nConsidering that relapse after a long period of abstinence\nis a major clinical problem when treating people with a sub-\nstance use disorder (Hyman et al., 2006), it is imperative to\ndevelop a reliable model of reinstatement of drug-seeking\nbehavior. Contingent drug administration, e.g., IVSA (intra-\nvenous self-administration) in rodents, has been recognized\nas the best model to mimic addiction behavior in humans\n(Shaham et al., 2003). This model thus represents a powerful\ntool to explore potential mechanisms of drug addiction and\nthe functional alterations of NAc MSNs. The present exper-\niments were designed to study electrophysiological adapta-\ntions in NAc MSNs in the IVSA mouse model of drug-primed\nreinstatement using a complex paradigm that better repli-\ncates the human condition, consisting of repeated cycles\nof extinction-reinstatement. After establishment of cocaine-\nseeking behavior, in vitro slices from trained mice were used\nto examine changes in membrane excitability and synaptic\ntransmission in two conditions: firstly, under basal conditions\nbefore cocaine re-exposure and secondly, following acute\nexposure to cocaine which in a way is the in vitro equiva-\nlent of drug-primed cocaine-seeking behavior. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first study using such drug IVSA\nextinction-reinstatement procedure in mice, in conjunction\nwith examination of functional alterations in synaptic activ-\nity and excitability of NAc MSNs.\nAnimals and housing\nMale C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME)\nwere obtained at the age of 8\u00ad9 weeks and housed four\nper cage with food and water ad libitum. Ambient vivarium\ntemperatures were maintained at 22C, and illumination\nwas provided for 12 h/day (7:00 AM on). Experimental proce-\ndures were performed in accordance with the United States\nPublic Health Service Guide for the Care and Use of Labo-\nratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Ani-\nmal Care and Use Committee at the University of California,\nLos Angeles.\nOperant conditioning apparatus\nEach operant chamber (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT) was\nfitted with an AL (active lever) and an IAL(inactive lever, 7 mm\nabove the gridfloor), a cue light positioned 45 mm above the\ncenter of the two levers and a house light on the opposite wall\nof the chamber. The position of the AL was counterbalanced\nacross individuals and within each group. Chambers were\nlocated in sound-attenuating containers, with a fan that\nalways was on during the training sessions.\nCatheter implantation, maintenance and patency\nWe used methods previously described (Thomsen and Caine,\nmixed with oxygen and implanted with a chronic indwelling\nsilastic catheter (0.2 mm i.d., 0.4 mm o.d.) connected to a 26-\ngauge guide exteriorized cannula for drug administration in\n258 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nNucleus accumbens excitability and cocaine relapse\nthe right or left jugular vein. The catheter was tunneled sub-\ncutaneously to the base located in the midscapular region.\nTwo subcutaneous injections of carprofen (5 mg/kg) were\ngiven right before and 24 h after surgery. Mice were allowed\n7 days to recover, during which 0.02 ml of 0.9% (w/v) saline\ncontaining heparin (30 USP units/ml) and antibiotic (cefa-\nzolin, 67 mg/ml) was infused daily through the catheter to\nforestall clotting and infection. During the following exper-\nimental procedure of cocaine IVSA acquisition, the catheter\nwas flushed with heparinized saline before and after each\ntraining session. Catheter patency was confirmed before and\nafter completion of cocaine IVSA acquisition phase by the\ninfusion of propofol (0.02 ml; 10 mg/ml). Loss of muscle tone\nand clear signs of anesthesia within 3 s indicated catheter pa-\ntency. Catheterization of rodents for IVSA, particularly mice,\nis technically challenging. In the present study, a total of\n51 mice were used but eight were excluded due to catheter\nleakage or clogging (n = 7) or surgery-associated infection\n(n = 1). No mortality due to the catheterization procedure\noccurred.\nBehavioral procedure of drug-primed cocaine\nseeking\nThe schematic of in vivo behavioral procedure for modeling\ndrug-primed cocaine seeking is shown in the upper panel\nof Figure 1. It consisted of a multi-staged procedure, which\nstarted with the acquisition of cocaine IVSA, followed by\nseveral cycles of extinction and reinstatement.\nAcquisition of cocaine IVSA behavior\nOne week after jugular catheter implantation, training of\nmice in the operant conditioning chambers was initiated.\nThe training session lasted 2 h/day, 5 days a week for 3\u00ad\n4 weeks. Each session started with a house light on and both\nlevers extended. For master mice, the training started with\nan FR 1 (fixed ratio 1) schedule of reinforcement, during\nwhich one response to the assigned AL resulted in the pro-\ngrammed consequences, i.e., an IV drug injection through\nthe pre-implanted catheter as well as illumination of the\ncentral cue light on and the extinguishing of the house light\nfor 20 s (time-out, no more injection was delivered after\nactive response). The criteria for moving from FR1 to FR5\nphase included: (1) earning a minimum of 20 reinforcers\nper session in two consecutive sessions; (2) varying in the\nnumber of infusions earned by no more than 20% in two\nconsecutive sessions; (3) making at least 70% of all re-\nsponses on the AL; (4) the passage of at least 2 weeks in\nthe FR1 phase. The FR5 training phase, usually 1\u00ad2 weeks,\nprogressed to the extinction phase when no more than 20%\nvariation in the number of reinforcers earned between the\ntwo sessions occurred. Mice in the saline control group were\ntrained with the same procedure except the cocaine solu-\ntion was replaced with saline. The training procedure of\nmice in the yoked group strictly followed that of the cor-\nFigure 1 Schematic diagram of in vivo behavioral procedures for\nmodeling drug-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking and in vitro\nwhole-cell patch clamp recordings of the NAc MSNs are shown in the\nupper and lower panels, respectively\nFR, fixed ratio; Coc, cocaine; IC, current clamp; VC, voltage clamp.\nresponding paired masters, except each drug delivery and\npresentation of visual cues were initiated by the paired\nmasters.\nExtinction of established cocaine IVSA behavior\nMice in all three groups were trained in operant chambers\nwith everything similar as in the acquisition phase except that\nall lever presses were recorded but were without programmed\nconsequences. Subjects remained in extinction until no more\nthan 20% variation in the number of AL responses be-\ntween two consecutive sessions occurred, with a minimum of\n2-week extinction period.\nDrug-primed reinstatement of cocaine seeking\nFour cycles of reinstatement testing were performed in all\nsubjects 24 h after meeting the extinction criteria (see above).\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nY.Y. Ma and others\nIn each cycle, mice were tested for their propensity to rein-\nstate drug-seeking behavior after a challenge injection of\ncocaine (0, 1, 3.2 and 10 mg/kg IP, in random order) followed\nby at least 2-day re-extinction until they met again the ex-\ntinction criteria. The in vitro electrophysiological studies were\nperformed 24 h after the last extinction session. Thus, the end\npoint of behavioral training was when the subjects were at\nthe extinction phase. Forty-one of 43 mice reached the es-\ntablished criteria.\nSlice preparation and localization of MSNs in\nthe NAc sub-regions\nA schematic for in vitro NAc MSNs recordings is shown in\nthe lower panel of Figure 1. Mice were decapitated, and\nbrains were quickly removed. Coronal slices containing the\nNAc (300 m thickness) were prepared with a vibratome (Le-\nica) and incubated for at least 1 h in standard ASCF (artificial\ncerebrospinal fluid) composed of the following (in mM): 130\nand\n]. All MSNs included\nin this study were located within the NAc, in coronal slices\ntaken from 1.7 to 0.8 mm anterior to Bregma (Ma et al.,\n2012). The anterior commissure and the islands of Calleja\nwere used as landmarks for locating the NAc core and shell\nsub-regions. Coordinates for recording in NAc core were 1.3\u00ad\n0.8 mm anterior to Bregma, within 200 m from the edge of\nthe anterior commissure, whereas in NAc shell coordinates\nislands of Calleja (Franklin and Paxinos, 2007).\nElectrophysiological recordings\nWhole-cell patch clamp recordings of NAc MSNs were per-\nformed using methods adapted from those described previ-\nwere identified by somatic size, basic membrane properties\n(input resistance, membrane capacitance and time constant),\nand by addition of biocytin (0.15%) to the internal solution.\nThe patch pipette (3\u00ad5 M ) contained one of the following\nsolutions (in mM): 1) KGluc (K-gluconate internal solution):\nATP 2, for voltage and current clamp; 2) CsMeth (Cs-\nMethanesulfonate) internal solution: Cs-methanesulfonate\nAccess resistances were <25 M . sEPSCs (spontaneous ex-\ncitatory postsynaptic currents) and sIPSCs (spontaneous in-\nhibitory postsynaptic currents) were recorded by holding the\nmembrane at - 70 mV and + 10 mV, respectively, in ACSF.\nIn specific experiments, sEPSCs were recorded in the presence\nof the GABAA\nreceptor antagonist, bicuculline (BIC, 20 M)\nin the external solution, and by holding the membrane at\n- 70 mV. mEPSCs (miniature excitatory postsynaptic cur-\nrents) were recorded after addition of TTX (tetrodotoxin,\nRecordings with CsMeth internal solution\nPassive membrane properties were determined in VC (volt-\nage clamp) mode by applying a depolarizing step voltage\ncommand (10 mV) and using the membrane test function\nintegrated in the pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments). This\nfunction reports membrane capacitance (Cm, in pF), input\nresistance (Rin, in M ) and decay time constant (Tau, in\nms). This was obtained from a single exponential fit to\nthe decay of the capacitive transient. After characterizing the\nbasic membrane properties of the neuron, EPSCs/IPSCs were\nrecorded for 3\u00ad6 min. The membrane current was filtered at\n1 kHz and digitized at 200 s using Clampex (Foster City,\nCA). Spontaneous events were analyzed off-line using the\nMini Analysis Program (Jaejin Software). The Thr amplitude\nfor the detection of a synaptic event (generally 6 pA for\nEPSCs and 10 pA for IPSCs), was adjusted to be 2\u00ad3 times\nabove the root-mean-square noise level. This software was\nalso used to calculate EPSC frequency, amplitude for each\nsynaptic event, and to construct time-frequency histograms.\nFrequencies were expressed as number of events per second\n(Hz).\nRecordings with KGluc internal solution\nRecordings started in the VC mode to measure passive mem-\nbrane properties following the same procedure used with\nCsMeth internal solution. Then recordings were switched to\ncurrent clamp (IC) mode and measurements of membrane\nproperties were obtained following published methods (Heng\net al., 2008). The RMP (resting membrane potential) was\nmeasured 5 min after the seal was ruptured. For membrane\nexcitability assessment, the membrane potentials of all the\nneurons were held at - 80 mV in IC mode to make the mea-\nsurements from different neurons comparable. The rheobase\nwas defined as the minimal depolarizing current necessary to\nevoke APs (action potentials). The Rin was calculated from the\nvoltage response to a hyperpolarizing current pulse ( - 100\npA). For measurements of a single AP, a Thr was determined\nby differentiating the AP waveform and setting a rising rate\nof 10 mV/ms as the AP inflection point.\nValues in the figures and tables are presented as\nmean +\n- S.E. of the mean. Two-way (Figures 2, 4(B) and 4(C),\nand Figures 5\u00ad7) or one-way (Figure 4D) rm (repeated mea-\nsures) ANOVAs were followed by multiple comparisons using\nBonferroni post-hoc tests, except two-way ANOVAs followed\nby Bonferroni post-hoc tests in Table 1 and Figure 3 and\npaired Student's t tests in Figures 4(E) and 4(F).

However, the change in schedule did not affect\nthe lever pressing rates in yoked or saline groups (right panels\nof Figures 2A and 2B).\nAfter a minimum 10 days of extinction training, the num-\nber of AL responses made by master mice declined to a\nlevel not different than IAL responses (days, F9, 130\nsuggesting that drug-seeking behavior was extinguished\nby this procedure (Figure 2D). The drug-primed reinstate-\nment tests in master mice showed that the number of\nAL responses was significantly higher than that of IAL re-\nsponses when an IP injection of cocaine at 3.2 mg/kg, but\nnot at 1 or 10 mg/kg, was given before reinstatement test-\nFigure 2E). This inverted U-dose effect is consistent with\npast studies (Weissenborn et al., 1996; Rosenzweig-Lipson\net al., 1997). The lever pressing paradigm in the yoked\nand saline controls was not changed by an IP priming\nshown).\nMembrane and synaptic properties of NAc MSNs\nin vitro before acute cocaine re-exposure\nElectrophysiological studies in slices from trained mice were\nperformed 24 h after the last extinction session. MSNs in NAc\nshell from master mice showed significant increases in mem-\nbrane Rin compared with cells in the core compartment mea-\nsured in VC mode (sub-region, F1, 60\nP < 0.01, shell versus core MSNs from master mice, Table 1).\nHigher Rin in the shell of master mice suggested that MSNs\nin this region could be more excitable.\nCompared with saline controls, MSNs in the NAc core of\nmasters showed a significantly higher frequency and larger\namplitude of sEPSCs, whereas in the NAc shell, a lower fre-\nquency and smaller amplitude of sEPSCs were observed (sub-\nregion\u00d7behavioral procedure, for frequency, F2, 63\nhoc test, for both frequency and amplitude, P<0.05, master\nversus saline in the MSNs of NAc core and shell). This up-\nregulation of sEPSCs in the core was specifically related to\nactive, contingent drug use/extinction history as it did not\noccur in yoked mice or saline controls. Interestingly, while the\nfrequency of sEPSCs in MSNs of the core region in yoked mice\nwas similar to that of the saline group, in the shell it was sim-\nilar to the master group, suggesting that down-regulation of\nsEPSCs in the shell is the consequence of repeated exposure\nto cocaine, either in a contingent or non-contingent manner\n(Figures 3A\u00ad3C). Furthermore, the decay time and duration\nat half-width of sEPCS of shell MSNs were longer in master\nmice than in saline controls (sub-region\u00d7behavioral proce-\nmaster versus saline in the MSNs of NAc core and shell for\nboth frequency and amplitude).\nChanges in sIPSCs were observed as well. The sub-regional\nbidirectional modification in the frequency of synaptic activ-\nity, decreased in MSNs from the shell but increased in MSNs\nfrom the core compartment, was also observed. However,\nthe amplitude of sIPSCs remained unchanged in master mice\ncompared with saline controls (results not shown).\nResponse of MSNs in the NAc after re-exposure\nto cocaine in vitro\nEffects on synaptic transmission during and after cocaine\nbath application\nMSNs from master, yoked and saline control mice showed\ndose-dependent responses to acute in vitro cocaine ap-\nthe specific behavioral procedure (F2, 105\nFigure 4C). Thus, NAc MSNs from saline controls showed no\nof cocaine (left panels of Figures 4A and 4B). In contrast,\nthe average sEPSC frequency in MSNs from master mice was\nincreased during application of cocaine at 0.1 and 1.0 M,\nbut decreased to control levels at 10 M (right panels of Fig-\nures 4A and 4B). The average frequency of sEPSCs in MSNs\nfrom yoked mice showed a response only to the high dose\nof cocaine and this effect was inhibitory (middle panels of\nFigures 4A and 4B). This dose-dependent response of NAc\nMSNs did not show sub-regional differences and data from\nshell and core were pooled together. The number of cells\nfrom each compartment was roughly half and half. Addi-\ntional experiments demonstrated that the modification of\nsEPSCs frequency in master mice by low doses of cocaine (0.1,\n1.0 M) was abolished in the presence of TTX (F3, 5\n0, 0.1, 1 M, Figure 4D). Furthermore, after pharmacological\nisolation of sEPSCs by addition of BIC to the perfusate, the av-\nerage frequency of sEPSCs in master mice was also increased\nand this up-regulation disappeared in the presence of TTX\namplitude were observed in master, yoked or saline control\nmice, suggesting an AP-dependent mechanism of changes\noccurring in response to acute cocaine in NAc MSNs from\nmice subject to different behavioral procedures.

Our\nprocedure included acquisition, extinction and repeated\nreinstatement/extinction cycles in mice trained by contin-\ngent cocaine IVSA. With this multi-staged paradigm it was\npossible to explore functional alterations of NAc MSNs using\nin vitro electrophysiological recordings in slices before and\nafter acute re-exposure to cocaine. Our data clearly demon-\nstrate differences in passive and active membrane properties\nof MSNs, as well as synaptic adaptations before and after\nacute cocaine application in slices from saline, yoked and\nmaster mice. Some neuroadaptations were region-specific,\nwhile others were observed in both compartments. In master\nmice, MSNs displayed higher Rin in the shell of NAc un-\nder basal conditions, i.e., before acute re-exposure to co-\ncaine, compared to yoked and saline controls. In addition,\ncells from master mice showed an AP-dependent increase in\nsEPSC frequency after re-exposure to a low dose of cocaine\nin vitro. Acute cocaine also induced membrane hyperpolar-\nization, but concomitantly increased membrane excitability\nof MSNs from master mice, as evidenced by increased Rin, de-\ncreased current required to induce firing and hyperpolarized\nAP Thr. These changes were not observed in yoked mice or\nsaline controls. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nreport of functional alterations of NAc MSNs after chronic\ncontingent versus non-contingent cocaine exposure using\nIVSA in mice, and also the first to examine the effects of\n266 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nNucleus accumbens excitability and cocaine relapse\nextinction training in conjunction with an in vitro equivalent\nof cocaine-primed drug-seeking behavior at the cellular and\nsynaptic levels.\nRegional and non-regional differences in NAc\nMSNs before and after acute cocaine application\nin slices\nPassive membrane properties and spontaneous synaptic\ntransmission of MSNs from master mice were different in the\nNAc shell versus core before cocaine re-exposure, consistent\nwith previous observations using non-contingent administra-\ntion (Martin et al., 2006), in which opposite changes in ex-\ncitability of MSNs were reported between shell and core. The\ndecrease in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous synaptic\nactivity in the shell occurred in conjunction with increases in\nmembrane input resistance. While this may appear paradoxi-\ncal, this increase could represent another synaptic adaptation\nin response to reduced glutamatergic input, a sort of synap-\ntic scaling (Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004). For example, in NAc\nneurons it has been shown that postsynaptic membranes are\ncapable of adjusting excitability in response to basal shifts\nin excitatory synaptic input, a phenomenon called homeo-\nstatic synapse-driven membrane plasticity (Ishikawa et al.,\n2009). In contrast to our findings, another study reported\nincreased frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in the shell\ncompartment (Kourrich et al., 2007). However, in this study\nvery young mice were used and the cocaine treatment was\nnon-contingent. The apparent discrepancy with our results\nunderlines that age and mode of administration play a crit-\nical role in defining the outcomes of electrophysiological\nchanges.\nThere was no difference between core and shell in re-\nsponse to acute cocaine treatment. The prolonged effects\nof acute treatment during cocaine washout were also ho-\nmogeneous in both compartments. Moreover, acute cocaine\ntreatment-induced changes in the intrinsic cellular excitabil-\nity, including RMP, Rin, current necessary to induce fir-\ning and Thr for APs also did not show sub-regional dif-\nferences. These results suggest that although cocaine IVSA\nmice show sub-regional differences in passive membrane\nproperties, the increased membrane input resistance of NAc\nshell MSNs from master mice may not be responsible for\nmediating the cocaine-primed drug-seeking behavior but\na result of the training or extinction procedure. The pos-\nsible mechanism of this change is presently unknown but\nmay involve modifications in DA and second messenger\ncascades that alter specific K+ conductances (Dong et al.,\nels play a role. For example, withdrawal from cocaine self-\nadministration decreases tyrosine hydroxylase levels in NAc\nshell but not core (Self et al., 2004). The absence of sub-\nregional differences in response to cocaine re-exposure of\nMSNs in the core versus shell is consistent with previous\nin vivo studies which showed no sub-regional difference in\nthe NAc in reinstatement of cocaine-seeking (Famous et al.,\nExcitatory but not inhibitory synaptic\ntransmission of NAc MSNs was involved in\nspecific responses to cocaine re-exposure in\nmaster mice\nOur results showed that both sEPSCs and sIPSCs were mod-\nulated by the chronic cocaine exposure history. Under basal\nconditions, i.e., before cocaine application in slices, NAc MSNs\nfrom master mice showed lower frequency and smaller EPSC\namplitude in the shell, but significantly higher frequency\nand bigger amplitude in the core. Similar changes in sIP-\nSCs frequency, but not amplitude, were observed. However,\nchanges to acute cocaine re-exposure in vitro were only de-\ntected in the frequency of sEPSCs, but not sIPSCs. In addition,\nthe alterations in the frequency of the sEPSCs from master\nmice was AP-dependent, suggesting adaptations in excita-\ntory projections from pre-/infra-limbic cortex, but not of\nlocal inhibitory, GABAergic inputs, mediated cocaine-primed\nreinstatement of drug-seeking. This is consistent with ac-\ncumulating evidence that glutamate inputs are necessary\nfor drug-primed cocaine-seeking behaviors, which could be\nblocked by ablating (Peters et al., 2008) or manipulating the\ncortical-NAc glutamatergic projections either pharmacolog-\nically (Berglind et al., 2009) or optogenetically (Suska et al.,\n2013). While an essential role for cortical inputs to NAc has\nbeen acknowledged, other excitatory inputs can induce plas-\ntic changes in NAc neurons. In particular, a strong and spe-\ncific projection from the ventral hippocampus to the medial\nNAc shell has been shown to enhance synaptic strength after\ncocaine administration, albeit using a non-contingent ad-\nministration paradigm (Britt et al., 2012). As MSNs in both\ncompartments were sensitized by acute re-exposure to co-\ncaine in our IVSA paradigm, it is likely that inputs from\nthe prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala also play an\nimportant role.

Ma and others\ntransmission in the NAc MSNs. These findings are in agree-\nment with results in dorsal striatum using chronic adminis-\ntration of metamphetamine (Bamford et al., 2008). A pro-\nlonged state of corticostriatal depression is followed by a\nparadoxical pre-synaptic potentiation upon re-exposure to\nthe drug. Because adding BIC had no effects on the response\nof sEPSCs to a low dose of cocaine, local inhibitory circuits\nseemed not involved. However, this sensitized response in\nmaster mice was abolished in the presence of TTX, suggest-\ning that an AP-dependent glutamate release was sensitized\nat the pre-synaptic level and could be involved in mediating\nthe cocaine-primed drug-seeking behaviors. Although a tight\nrelationship between glutamate levels and cocaine-primed\nreinstatement has been demonstrated in rats by in vivo co-\nexamination of glutamate synaptic activity in the yoked sub-\njects limits the relevance of these observations. Our current\ndata demonstrated that (1) increased AP-dependent release\nof glutamate might be involved in cocaine seeking in the\nmouse IVSA model; and (2) this sensitized glutamate synap-\ntic activity probably resulted from the active drug-taking\nhistory, not the prolonged effects of chronic cocaine ex-\nposure history itself as it did not occur in yoked mice. An\nadditional mechanism that could contribute to sensitized\nresponses to cocaine is the well-known enhancing effect\nof DA, via D1 receptors, on glutamatergic activity (Cepeda\nduces an increase of DA concentration in slices (Ortiz et al.,\nAn interesting finding is that in the presence of TTX\nsEPSCs frequency of NAc MSNs from master mice showed\na similar response to cocaine as that from yoked mice,\ni.e., no response to low doses (0.1, 1 M), whereas fre-\nquency was decreased by a high dose (10 M) of co-\ncaine. Thus, we hypothesize that pharmacological effects\nof chronic IV cocaine administration after prolonged with-\ndrawal is encoded in the NAc MSNs by an AP-independent\nmechanism, possibly mediated by postsynaptic mechanisms.\nHowever, the long persistence of compulsive drug-seeking\nbehaviors was mediated by an AP-dependent mechanism,\nwhich more possibly resulted from alterations in pre-synaptic\npathways. This AP-dependent mechanism showed a glu-\ntamate sensitized response to low dose (0.1, 1 M) co-\ncaine treatments, but the AP-independent response was only\nobserved at the high dose (10 M). It appears that pre-\nand postsynaptic mechanisms in the NAc play differential\nroles in the long-persistence of emotional/motivational and\npharmacological-related effects, respectively. Indeed, it has\nbeen demonstrated that the down-regulation of sEPSCs in\nstriatal MSNs occurs in response to a high dose of co-\ntrations cocaine may produce anesthetic effects by reduc-\ning the amplitude of Na+ currents (Crumb and Clarkson,\nCould changes in intrinsic excitability of NAc MSNs af-\nter cocaine re-exposure be attributable to contingent versus\nnon-contingent cocaine administration, or route of adminis-\ntration? Our data demonstrated that after a prolonged period\nof drug withdrawal, no differences occurred in the basal val-\nues of RMP, Rin, current required to induce APs and Thr\nfor firing from mice with IVSA cocaine history versus saline\ncontrols. This is consistent with the only previous study us-\ning contingent IV cocaine administration in rats, although in\nthis study a temporary decrease of MSN intrinsic excitability\nduring the early stage of cocaine withdrawal was observed\n(Mu et al., 2010). However, there is evidence that during\nboth early (within 1 week) and late stage (after 2\u00ad3 weeks)\nof withdrawal from repeated non-contingent IP injections\nof cocaine significant decreases of intrinsic excitability of\nNAc MSNs occur (Kourrich and Thomas, 2009; Mu et al.,\n2010). More importantly, the NAc MSNs from IV yoked mice,\nwhich serves as a better non-contingent administration con-\ntrol for IV masters than mice receiving non-contingent IP\ninjections, did not show any changes in RMP, Rin, depolar-\nizing current necessary to evoke APs, and Thr of APs, which\nis different from the controls with non-contingent IP in-\njections. This suggests that the intrinsic excitability of NAc\nMSNs, although clearly related to the stage of withdrawal,\ndoes not depend on contingent or non-contingent cocaine\nadministration. The way by which cocaine is delivered, IP or\nIV, is hypothesized to be responsible for alterations of in-\ntrinsic excitability of NAc MSNs in mice with a history of\nchronic cocaine exposure. For example, in Mu's study, after a\n3-week cocaine withdrawal the membrane excitability of NAc\nMSNs, which remained low in IP treated rats, returned to a\nnormal level in IVSA-treated rats. This can be explained by dif-\nferent pharmacokinetics of these two routes of drug adminis-\ntration. The behavioral effects of IV administration of cocaine\nhas a more rapid onset and termination relative to IP admin-\nistration (O'Dell et al., 1996). In humans, IV administration of\ncocaine produces greater physiological changes and more in-\ntense subjective effects relative to other routes (Resnick et al.,\nAlthough the present methodology probably represents\nthe best way to examine changes in NAc MSN properties in\na mouse model of drug-seeking behavior, one limitation is\nthat, because of the complex training paradigm, it is difficult\nto determine the exact source and timing of electrophysi-\nological changes in NAc MSNs in the in vitro studies. Thus,\npermanent changes could be attributed to acquisition, ex-\ntinction, and/or reinstatement phases. Notwithstanding this\nlimitation, our study opens new alternatives for a deeper\nunderstanding of the mechanisms of drug-seeking behavior.\nThe availability of genetically modified laboratory animals,\ne.g., mice expressing green fluorescent protein as a reporter\nof specific neuronal populations of the striatum, will allow\ndefining better the contribution of the direct and indirect\npathways in drug addiction. Based on our previous work\nrent literature, we can speculate that sensitized responses to\ncocaine occur mainly in D1 receptor-containing MSNs (see\n268 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nNucleus accumbens excitability and cocaine relapse\nple, it has been shown that overexpression of the transcrip-\ntion factor FosB in direct, but not indirect, pathway MSNs\nenhances behavioral responses to cocaine (Grueter et al.,\n2013), and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phos-\nphorylation after acute or chronic cocaine injections is con-\nfined to D1 MSNs in NAc and dorsal striatum (Bertran-\nGonzalez et al., 2008). In addition, a selective increase in\nspine density occurred in D1 MSNs after chronic cocaine ex-\nposure (Kim et al., 2011). However, a role for D2 MSNs cannot\nbe ruled out (Lobo et al., 2010) although, for the most part,\nadaptations in D2 MSNs generally oppose addictive behaviors\nCONCLUSIONS\nUsing a complex paradigm of cocaine use consisting of\nrepeated cycles of extinction/reinstatement, a model that\nclosely resembles the human condition, we demonstrate elec-\ntrophysiological neuroadaptations in NAc MSNs due to either\ncontingent (IVSA in master mice) or non-contingent (yoked\nmice) administration. Changes after a long withdrawal period\nwere compartment specific while those occurring after acute\nre-exposure to cocaine occurred in both core and shell. We\nalso demonstrate sensitized glutamate transmission of NAc\nMSNs from master mice in response to acute cocaine ap-\nplication and suggest a promising strategy to counter drug-\nprimed cocaine-seeking. Disruption of glutamatergic inputs\nonto MSNs or blockade of glutamate receptors in NAc could\nprevent relapse induced by drugs that have been previously\nabused.\nYao-Ying Ma, Christopher Evans, James Jentsch, Michael\nLevine and Carlos Cepeda designed the study and wrote the\npaper.
