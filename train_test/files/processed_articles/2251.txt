    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nAlthough several studies have noted increased fracture risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the pathophysiologic\nmechanisms underlying this association are not known. We hypothesize that insulin resistance (the key pathology in T2DM)\nnegatively influences bone remodeling and leads to reduced bone strength. Data for this study came from 717 participants in the\nBiomarker Project of the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS II). The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance\n(HOMA-IR) was calculated from fasting morning blood glucose and insulin levels. Projected 2D (areal) bone mineral density (BMD) was\nmeasured in the lumbar spine and left hip using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Femoral neck axis length and width were\nmeasured from the hip DXA scans, and combined with BMD and body weight and height to create composite indices of femoral neck\nstrength relative to load in three different failure modes: compression, bending, and impact. We used multiple linear regressions to\nexamine the relationship between HOMA-IR and bone strength, adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, menopausal transition stage\n(in women), and study site. Greater HOMA-IR was associated with lower values of all three composite indices of femoral neck strength\nrelative to load, but was not associated with BMD in the femoral neck. Every doubling of HOMA-IR was associated with a 0.34 to 0.40\nSD decrement in the strength indices (p < 0.001). On their own, higher levels of fasting insulin (but not of glucose) were\nindependently associated with lower bone strength. Our study confirms that greater insulin resistance is related to lower femoral neck\nstrength relative to load. Further, we note that hyperinsulinemia, rather than hyperglycemia, underlies this relationship. Although\ncross-sectional associations do not prove causality, our findings do suggest that insulin resistance and in particular, hyperinsulinemia,\nmay negatively affect bone strength relative to load. \u00a9 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\n",

For instance, low bone mineral\ndensity (BMD) is a major risk factor for fracture, yet BMD in\ndiabetics is greater than that in nondiabetic individuals.(8,10\u00ad12)\nBut T2DM is also associated with greater body weight, which can\nincrease fracture risk by several mechanisms, including increas-\ning the forces on bone during a fall.(13\u00ad19) Greater body weight is\nalso expected to increase BMD by the impact of skeletal loading\non osteoblast differentiation and activity.(20,21) However, the\npathophysiology of T2DM may negatively influence bone\nin response to increased skeletal loading, it is not increased\nenough relative to the increased impact forces in a fall.\nConsistent with this hypothesis, composite indices of femoral\nneck strength relative to load are indeed lower in midlife women\nwith diabetes than in nondiabetic women.(24) The composite\nstrength indices combine femoral neck areal BMD and size\nobtained from dual-energy X ray absorptiometry (DXA) hip scans\nwith body size to gauge strength relative to load (impact forces)\nas may be borne during a fall.(25) They are inversely associated\nwith incident hip fracture risk in community-dwelling older white\nwomen(25) and in young U.S. white and Chinese men and\nwomen,(26) and unlike BMD, predict fragility fracture risk in\nmiddle-aged women without requiring knowledge of the\nwoman's race/ethnicity.(27)\nIshii and colleagues(24) also noted a significant inverse\nassociation between insulin resistance (measured using the\nHomeostatic Model of Insulin Resistance [HOMA-IR]) and\ncomposite indices for bone strength in a multiethnic sample\nof premenopausal women. A few small studies have also found\nAddress correspondence to: Preethi Srikanthan, MD, MS, University of California, Los Angeles, David Geffen School of Medicine, BOX 951679, A2-237 CHS, Los\nJ\nJBMR\n\u00a9 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research\ninverse associations between insulin resistance and markers of\nbone formation, such as osteocalcin,(28,29) osteoprotegerin,(30)\nand even BMD in some subpopulations.(31\u00ad33)\nWe therefore hypothesized that insulin resistance plays a key\nrole in the increased fracture risk observed in T2DM, and used\ndata from a national midlife sample to examine the association\nbetween insulin resistance and bone strength. Thus we hope to\nextend the results of Ishii and colleagues(24) to a population of\nmen and women, and uniquely, we used DXA-derived femoral\nbone strength relative to load, in addition to BMD, as markers of\nbone strength.\nSubjects and Methods\nData came from the second wave of the Midlife in the United\nStates Study (MIDUS II), which included blood and urine assays\nfor biomarkers and bone scans for a subsample of the overall\nMIDUS II cohort. The MIDUS II study, initiated in 1995, was\ndesigned to determine how social, psychological, and behavioral\nfactors interrelate to influence mental and physical health. The\nfirst wave (MIDUS I) collected sociodemographic and psychoso-\ncial data on 7108 English-speaking, noninstitutionalized Ameri-\ncan adults residing in the contiguous 48 states, ages 25 to\n74 years, whose household included at least one telephone\n(recruited by random digit dialing), with oversampling of\nfive metropolitan areas, twin pairs, and siblings.(34) To increase\nthe representation of African Americans from urban, low\nsocioeconomic strata in the sample, 592 additional African\nAmerican residents were recruited from Milwaukee, WI, USA, to\nparticipate in MIDUS II.\nOf the 4963 participants who completed the MIDUS II survey,\n3191 participants were deemed medically safe to travel. Of them,\n1255 agreed to participate in the MIDUS II biomarker project,\nwhich required a 2-day commitment, including travel to one of\nthree general clinical research centers (GCRC): the University of\nCalifornia at Los Angeles, Georgetown University, and the\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u00adMadison. Reasons given for nonpartici-\npation were travel, family, and work obligations. MIDUS II\nBiomarker Project participants were similar to the MIDUS II\nsample with respect to key characteristics (eg, subjective health,\nchronic conditions, physical activity, alcohol use),(35) and the\ncomplete MIDUS II sample was similar to the MIDUS I sample.(36)\nData were collected during a 24-hour stay at a GCRC between\nand physical examination (including medication review), a\nfasting blood draw, and DXA scans of the lumbar spine and\nleft hip.(35) Height and weight were measured during the GCRC\nvisit. Blood samples were frozen and shipped to a central\nlaboratory for assays. The glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and\nlipid assays were performed at Meriter Labs (GML) in Madison,\nWI, USA using a Cobra Integra Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics,\nIndianapolis, IN, USA). The glucose assays were performed at\nARUP Laboratories in Salt Lake City, UT, USA. Insulin assays were\nperformed on a Siemens Advia Centaur Analyzer also at ARUP\nLaboratories (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Tarrytown,\nNY, USA). Informed consent was provided by each participant,\nand each MIDUS center obtained institutional review board\nThe sample for this analysis included participants in the MIDUS\nII Biomarker Project with valid data on bone strength, fasting\ninsulin, and fasting glucose. Of the 1255 participants in the\nMIDUS II Biomarker Project, we excluded data from 347\nparticipants who did not have DXA scans (mainly because\nfunding for DXA scanning at the UCLA and Georgetown sites was\nobtained after the Biomarker Project had commenced), an\nadditional 15 individuals for whom data for fasting insulin and\nglucose data was lacking or fasting insulin values were less\nthan or equal to 68 mU/mL, 91 participants who were taking\nmedications known to influence bone strength (oral cortico-\nsteroids, alendronate, anastrazole, calcitonin, ibandronate,\nleuprolide, letrozole, raloxifene, risedronate, tamoxifen, zole-\ndronic acid, testosterone, finasteride, or dutasteride), and 85\nwomen whose menopause transition stage could not be\ndetermined, resulting in an analytic sample of 717.\nFor those models in which insulin resistance, fasting insulin, or\nfasting glucose were primary predictors, 83 individuals who were\ntaking hypoglycemic medications (glimepiride, glipizide, Met-\nformin, glyburide, Nateglinide, Pioglitazone, Pramlintide, Repa-\nglinide, Rosiglitazone, or Sitagliptin) or insulin analogues\n(Humalog, Novalog, Humulin N, Novolin N, Lantus, or Levemir)\nwere excluded, leaving an analytic sample of size 634 for these\nanalyses.\nMeasurements: primary predictors\nDetails of the sequence and methodology of biological specimen\ncollection in the MIDUS II Biomarker Project have been described\nin detail.(35) Biomarker Project participants also provided\ninformation on health conditions and medication usage.\nMedication information was verified by examination of medica-\ntion bottles brought to the clinical research center.\nBlood HbA1c measurements were obtained from fasting\nblood draws in the morning. Blood glucose and insulin levels\nmeasured from fasting morning blood samples were used to\ncalculate insulin resistance by the HOMA-IR, which is approxi-\nmated using the formula below(37):\nHOMA-IR \u00bc fasting glucose \u00f0in mg=dL\u00de\nParticipants were said to have diabetes if they met any of the\nfollowing four criteria: (1) HbA1c ! 6.5%; (2) fasting glucose !\n126 mg/dL; (3) reported having diabetes (categorical answer to\nthe question \"In past 12 months have you experienced or been\ntreated for any of the following conditions: diabetes or high\nblood sugar?\"); or (4) were taking medication(s) for diabetes\nincluding insulin analogue agents or hypoglycemic medications\nmentioned earlier in the Subjects and Methods section.\nParticipants were said to have prediabetes if they met all of\ndL < fasting glucose < 126 mg/dL; (2) did NOT report having\ndiabetes; AND (3) were NOT taking medication(s) for diabetes.\nParticipants were deemed to not have either prediabetes or\ndiabetes if they met all of the following criteria: (1) HbA1c\nhaving diabetes; AND (4) were NOT taking medication(s) for\ndiabetes.\nMeasurements: bone strength\nDuring the GCRC visit, 2D projected (areal) BMD was measured in\nthe lumbar spine (L1\n) and left hip using DXA. DXA scans were\nperformed using GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy (Madison site) or\nHologic 4500 (UCLA and Georgetown sites) technology.\nReading of all DXA scans was performed centrally by\nphysicians at the University of Wisconsin DXA center. Three\nJournal of Bone and Mineral Research INSULIN RESISTANCE AND BONE STRENGTH 797\ntimes per week, and on all days on which scans were obtained,\ninstruments were calibrated and phantom scan data were\nacquired. No densitometer shift or drift occurred during\nthe course of this study. For BMD cross-calibration across the\nthree clinical sites, a phantom was scanned 10 times on the\ndensitometers at each of the three study sites. The linear\nregression equation developed from these calibration scans was\nused to correct BMD values from two of the three sites to make\nthe data comparable across study sites. The recalibrated BMD\nvalues at the lumbar spine and left hip were reported in units of\ngrams per square centimeters(g/cm2).(38)\nFemoral neck axis length (FNAL), the distance along the\nfemoral neck axis from the lateral margin of the base of the\ngreater trochanter to the apex of the femoral head, and femoral\nneck width (FNW), the smallest thickness of the femoral neck\nalong any line perpendicular to the femoral neck axis, were\nmeasured from the hip scans using software provided by the\nscanner manufacturers. Composite indices of femoral neck\nstrength relative to load were created using the following\nCompression strength index \u00f0CSI\u00de\n\u00bc \u00f0BMD \u00c2 FNW\u00de=Weight\nBending strength index \u00f0BSI\u00de\n\u00bc \u00f0BMD \u00c2 FNW2\u00de=\u00f0FNAL \u00c2 Weight\u00de\nImpact strength index \u00f0ISI\u00de\n\u00bc \u00f0BMD \u00c2 FNW \u00c2 FNAL\u00de=\u00f0Height \u00c2 Weight\u00de\nAll three indices were recorded in units of grams per kilogram\nper meter (g/kg-m). Because BMD was measured in grams per\nsquare centimeter, FNW and FNAL in centimeters, weight in\nkilograms, and height in meters, we scaled CSI and BSI by 100 to\nobtain values in units of grams per kilogram per meter (g/kg-m).\nCSI reflects the ability of the femoral neck to withstand an axial\ncompressive load, BSI reflects its ability to withstand bending\nforces, and ISI reflects the ability of the femoral neck to absorb\nthe potential energy in a fall from standing height.\nMeasurements: covariates\nInformation regarding age and gender was obtained from self-\nreports. Gender/race/ethnicity was self-identified as white, Black/\nAfrican American, other, or multiracial. From self-reported\nmenstrual patterns and use (in the last year) of sex steroid\nhormones (from self-report and examination of medication\nbottles brought to the clinical research center), we classified each\nfemale participant's menopause transition stage as one of the\nfollowing: premenopausal (no change in regularity of menses),\nearly perimenopausal (had menses in last 3 months with change\nin regularity of menses), late perimenopausal (last menses 3\u00ad\n12 months previously with change in regularity of menses),\npostmenopausal (no menses in prior 12 months) not taking\nmenopausal hormone therapy, and postmenopausal taking\nmenopausal hormone therapy.(39)\nMen were categorized by age into three categories: younger\nage categories in men was guided by previous observations that\nsubstantial age-related bone loss in men does not start until age\n50 years.(40) Further, the age categories chosen in men also\nage-matched the oldest group of men to the postmenopausal\nwomen, because only 0.3% of occurrences of spontaneous\nmenopause take place at or after 59 years of age.(41)\nStatistical analyses\nWe used multiple linear regression to examine the associations of\nHOMA-IR (which was log-transformed to reduce skew in the\ndistribution, using base 2 log transformation to facilitate\ninterpretation), prediabetes, and diabetes with bone strength\nmeasures, adjusted for age, gender, menopause transition stage,\nrace (black versus non-black), and study site. We treated log-\ntransformed HOMA-IR as a continuous predictor because the\nrelationship between log HOMA-IR and bone strength indices\nhas been noted to be linear.(24) To allow for age-related changes\nin bone strength being different in men and in women, we used\ngender-specific coding for age. We included the categorical age\ntwo continuous variables--one that tracked age in men 60 years\nand older, and another that tracked age in women who were late\nperimenopausal or postmenopausal and not taking menopausal\nhormone therapy.\nBone strength measures examined as dependent variables\nwere BMD in the lumbar spine; BMD in the femoral neck; and the\nthree composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to load:\nCSI, BSI, and ISI. Because increased body weight is associated\nwith insulin resistance and because body weight also influences\nbone deposition, the models were run with and without\nadjustment for body mass index (BMI). BMI was calculated as\nweight (kilograms) divided by the square of height (meters), and\nwas included in the models as a three different terms: continuous\n(linear) term, a squared term (BMI2), and a race interaction\nterm (BMI \u00c2 race) to allow for potentially different effects of BMI\nby race.\nWe tested for effect modification by gender, by including\ninteractions between gender and the primary predictor(s).\nFurther, as the relationship between HOMA-IR and bone strength\nmay be different in prediabetics and diabetics compared\nto nondiabetics, we included interaction terms HOMAIR \u00c2\nprediabetes and HOMAIR \u00c2 diabetes to test for effect modifica-\ntion by diabetes and prediabetes statuses. In supplementary\nanalyses aimed at shedding light on the independent\nroles of insulinemia and glycemia, fasting serum insulin\n(base 2 log transformed) and fasting serum glucose (base 2\nlog transformed) were included together in the models in place\nAll models accounted for within-family correlations using\nSTATA's cluster option. STATA SE version 10.1 (StataCorp LP,\nCollege Station, TX, USA) was used for all analyses.\nResults\nThe study sample was similar to the complete MIDUS II Biomarker\nProject sample with respect to age, BMI, HOMA-IR, prediabetes,\nand diabetes prevalence (Table 1). The most common reasons for\nexclusion of Biomarker Project participants from the analysis\nsample were missing hip DXA scans (from the UCLA and\nGeorgetown sites where DXA scans were added late to the\nprotocol due to funding limitations) and unclassifiable meno-\npause transition stage in women. Therefore, compared to the\nBiomarker sample, the study sample had a smaller proportion of\nwomen and a larger proportion of African Americans (because\nthe new urban African American participants from Milwaukee\n798 SRIKANTHAN ET AL. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research\nwere seen at the University of Wisconsin\u00adMadison site, which\ncollected DXA scans from the start of the Biomarker Project)\n(Table 1).\nThe average age of study participants was 56.8 years, 38% of\nmen were 60 years or older and 59% of women were either late\nperimenopausal or postmenopausal and not taking menopausal\nhormone therapy. The mean age (SD) of men in the analytic\nparticipants had diabetes. Both prediabetes and overt diabetes\nwere more common in older individuals and in African American\nparticipants: among diabetics, mean age was 59.5 years, 44.4%\nwere men, and 34.7% were African American; among predia-\nwere African American; and among those who did not have\neither prediabetes or overt diabetes, mean age 52.9 years, 45.3%\nwere men, and 9.2% were African American.\nIn the complete sample, median and interquartile range of\nAdjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, menopause transition\nstage, and study site, greater insulin resistance was associated\nwith higher BMD in the femoral neck but with lower values of\neach of the three composite indices of femoral neck strength\nrelative to load (Table 2). With additional adjustment for BMI,\ngreater insulin resistance was associated with lower values of all\nfive bone strength measures, although the association with\nlower BMD in the femoral neck was not significant (Table 2).\nEvery doubling of HOMA-IR was associated with a 0.09 to 0.14 SD\ndecrement in the other four bone strength measures (Table 2).\nTable 1.

Following additional\nadjustment for BMI, neither prediabetes nor overt diabetes was\nsignificantly associated with any of the five strength measures\n(Table 3).\nGender did not modify the associations of HOMA-IR, with bone\nstrength (all p values in tests of gender by HOMAIR interaction\nwere greater than 0.24). Moreover, prediabetes and diabetes\nstatus did not modify the association of HOMA-IR with four of the\nfive bone strength measures (all but one of the 10 p values in\ntests of prediabetes/diabetes by HOMA IR interaction were\ngreater than 0.17). The one exception was a significant\ninteraction between prediabetes and HOMA-IR in the association\nwith lumbar spine BMD (interaction p value 0.05). Therefore, we\nre-ran the HOMA-IR and lumbar spine BMD model with the\nanalytic sample restricted to prediabetics. Among prediabetics,\nthe association was even stronger: adjusted for age, gender,\nrace/ethnicity, menopause transition stage, study site, and BMI,\nevery doubling of HOMA-IR was associated with a 0.15 SD\ndecrement in lumbar spine BMD (p \u00bc 0.01); 95% confidence\nFinally, when fasting insulin and fasting glucose were entered\ntogether into the models, higher insulin (but not glucose) was\nindependently associated with lower bone strength. Adjusted for\nage, gender, race/ethnicity, menopause transition stage, study\nsite, BMI, and fasting glucose, every doubling of fasting insulin\nwas associated with a 0.10 to 0.18 SD decrement in each of the\nfive bone strength measures (Table 4).\nDiscussion\nAs hypothesized, in this national sample, increased insulin\nresistance, prediabetes, and overt diabetes mellitus were all\ncross-sectionally associated with lower indices of femoral neck\nstrength relative to load. Adjustment for BMI also unmasked an\nassociation between greater insulin resistance and lower BMD in\nthe lumbar spine. Our study confirms and extends the findings of\nan inverse association between bone strength indices and insulin\nresistance, noted by Ishii and colleagues(24) in premenopausal\nwomen to a national sample, in a population with a wider age\nTable 2.

Our findings are also\nconsistent with those from smaller studies in adolescents,(42)\nyoung adults,(33) bone marrow transplant patients,(32) and\ndiabetics(31) that have found associations between greater\ninsulin resistance and lower BMD. These findings and ours\nhelp explain, at least partly, the increased fracture risk observed\nThese findings are in contradistinction to several previous\nstudies that have documented higher BMD in T2DM(44\u00ad46)\nstudy however, suggests that hyperinsulinemia itself may in fact,\nbe associated with lower bone strength, because fasting insulin\nlevels (and not fasting glucose levels) were associated negatively\nwith both BMD and composite indices of strength relative to load\nin the femoral neck. A deleterious role for insulin on bone is also\nconsistent with experiments in mouse models that suggest that\nosteoblasts are insulin target cells(49) and that insulin signaling in\nosteoblasts favors bone resorption. Mice deficient in osteoblast-\nspecific insulin receptors have reduced expression of genes\nimplicated in bone resorption (CathepsinK and Tcirg1), less\nacidification of bone extracellular matrix, significantly smaller\nresorption pits, and markedly lower serum levels of bone\nresorption marker, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX).(50) Further, it\nwas recently noted that in Wistar rats with an obese, insulin-\nresistant condition induced by a 12-week high-fat diet, there was\nsignificant impairment of osteoblastic insulin signaling and\nosteoblast proliferation, with increased osteoblastic apoptosis\nculminating in osteoporosis in the jaw bone, compared to\nbaseline, measured using micro\u00adcomputed tomography (mCT) of\nmandibular bone.(51)\nThis study also adds to the accumulating evidence that it is not\nenough to look at BMD in isolation when assessing bone's ability\nto resist fracture. The importance of bone size and body size to\nfracture risk has been established.(47,52\u00ad56) The composite indices\nof femoral neck strength relative to load combine BMD with both\nbone size and body load and improve fracture prediction ability\nin both women(25,27) and men.(26) Previous studies have also\nnoted the lower spine bone volume in T2DM subjects.(57) A\nrecent study found that bone cross-sectional area is also lower in\nT2DM,(58) suggesting a deficit in periosteal apposition which is\nnormally stimulated by skeletal loading. Other studies have\nfound that although BMD may be higher in T2DM, bone strength\nrelative to load is not any higher.(24,59) Taken together, these\nstudies suggest that increased insulin resistance and/or hyper-\ninsulinemia may interfere with the usual anabolic response in\nbone to skeletal loading, so that bone strength relative to load is\nnegatively affected.\nOur study has some important limitations. Foremost, it is a\ncross-sectional study; thus causal inferences cannot be conclu-\nsively drawn. We cannot for instance, infer that insulin resistance\nleads to low bone strength. An alternate explanation for our\nfindings might be that increased bone mass leads to greater\ninsulin sensitivity, because osteoblasts and osteocalcin appear to\nhave a role in pancreatic function and glucose metabolism.(33,60\u00ad\n62) Further longitudinal studies of the temporal relationships\nbetween changes in insulin resistance and changes in bone\nstrength are needed. Next, the composite indices of femoral neck\nstrength are based on macroscopic measurements from DXA\nscans, and ignore changes in microarchitecture and quality of\nmineralization, both of which are thought to be adversely\naffected by T2DM.(63,64) Finally, previous studies have validated\nfemoral neck strength indices measured from Hologic machine\nscans; this is the first time Lunar machine\u00adbased measurements\nof the strength indices have been examined in a research study.\nDespite these limitations, our study confirms the negative\nassociation between insulin resistance and femoral neck\nstrength that was first noted in the Study of Women and the\nMenopausal Transition (SWAN) cohort of women by Ishii and\ncolleagues.(24) It suggests that obesity and hyperinsulinemia may\nnot be bone-protective, and adds to the growing body of\nevidence which points to the importance of measuring bone\nstrength relative to load, in assessing and understanding fracture\nrisk. Further research is needed to uncover the biological\nmechanisms by which insulin resistance could deleteriously\naffect bone health.\nDisclosures\nAll authors state that they have no conflicts of interest.\nTable 4.
