The Japanese subscribe to ethnic nationalism, which\nis an ideology with the aim to develop an ethnically exclu-\nsive and homogeneous nationhood (Kashiwazaki, 2011).\nOne manifestation of ethnic nationalism is the belief that\nJapan is, or should be, a mono-ethnic society. In other words,\neveryone who has Japanese nationality should be ethnically\nJapanese, or Japanese citizenship should be exclusively for\nthe ethnic Japanese.\nIn addition to the ethnocultural conception of nationhood,\nethnic nationalism is manifested in the exclusionary\nattitude or opinion of the Japanese. This is illustrated in the\nfollowing quote by the former director of the Tokyo\nImmigration Bureau:\nThe native Japanese have lived as a single ethnic group for\nnearly 1000 years and it will be a difficult task for them to build\nfriendly relationships with other ethnic groups. There will likely\nbe many who would prefer to deal only with other Japanese\npeople rather than foreigners with different customs and ideas.\nSakanaka explains that given Japan's history as an island\npopulated by people with a shared culture and common out-\nlook, developing close relationships with people of different\ncultures will not be easy. We will see in \"Housing\" and\n\"Discrimination Against Foreigners\" sections that the\nJapanese do \"prefer to deal only with other Japanese people\nrather than foreigners\" in housing and customer service.\nIn the context of foreigners living in Japan, the exclusion-\nary attitude or opinion of the Japanese often translates into\nthe insistence that foreigners should do things the Japanese\nway. In addition, because the Japanese are privileged and\nforeigners are at a disadvantage in ethnic nationalism, for-\neigners have fewer rights:\nIt's natural that foreigners who come to Japan should do things\nthe Japanese way. It's strange that we provide special services\nfor them. We should not give them any special treatment. (Nagy,\nIn addition to insisting that foreigners should do things the\nsame way as the Japanese do, the Japanese respondent above\nfrom Nagy's study in Shinjuku, Tokyo, seems to be against\nthe provision of multilingual services. In other words, the\nJapanese may have the right to have government services\noffered to them in their native language but foreigners do\nnot, even though foreigners pay taxes too. The following\nquote is from a foreign resident in the Nagoya area:\nI know that, in Nagoya, when I transgress a system even when\nthat system is simply advisory like the date to pick up at the dry\ncleaners . . . they have been very confrontational. I assume this\n1Nagoya University of Commerce and Business, Nisshin, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nLiang Morita, Nagoya University of Commerce and Business, 4-4\nEmail: liangchua3@gmail.com\nSome Manifestations of Japanese\nExclusionism\nLiang Morita1\n Keywords\nJapan, foreigners, housing, discrimination\n2 SAGE Open\nis based on the fact that I am foreign and must comply with\nJapanese rules to the very letter, but the exact rationale isn't\nclear to me as I find it hard to see their point of view on this.1\nThe respondent above was unhappy about the dry cleaner's\ninsistence on his suits being collected on a specified day, a\npractice seen in some parts of the country. From the respon-\ndent's point of view, he is the paying customer and should\ntherefore have the right to pick up at his convenience\nThe number of foreigners in Japan is increasing. The number\nof foreign residents has doubled to 2.2 million over the past 20\nyears (Kingston, 2013). Signs of transformation are evident in\nrising numbers of foreigners gaining permanent residency and\nforeign wives (many from low-income countries) playing a key\nrole in rural areas. In some sectors facing a shortage of skilled\nworkers such as information technology, the government has\ninitiated a new fast-track permanent residency program that tar-\ngets the relevant foreigners. Globalization, intensified interna-\ntionalization, and the aging and declining Japanese population\nall point toward the presence of more foreigners in Japan.\nHousing discrimination and discrimination against for-\neigners are contemporary phenomena in Japanese society,\nand this article identifies the discourse of Japanese homoge-\nneity and ethnic nationalism as main factors shaping this\nexclusion. Discrimination against foreigners in many parts of\nthe country is documented in works such as Lee, Murphy-\nShigematsu, and Befu (2006) and Willis and Murphy-\nShigematsu (2008). Discrimination against the Ainu and\nZainichi Koreans2 is discussed in Maher and Macdonald\nKoreans. The experiences of Nikkeijin3 are described in\nconsistent with and contributes to the existing literature.\nEthnic nationalism, particularly in the form of exclusion-\nary attitudes or opinions of the Japanese, is unfriendly to for-\neigners living in Japan, to say the least. This article illustrates\nhow unwelcoming and inconvenient Japanese exclusionism\ncan be by using two examples that directly affect foreigners:\nhousing (\"Housing\" section) and discrimination against for-\neigners (\"DiscriminationAgainst Foreigners\" section). Many\nforeigners looking for housing have had the experience of\nbeing refused service by estate agents, and even after having\nfound a willing estate agent, many find the guarantor require-\nment challenging. Discrimination against foreigners is not\nillegal in Japan, and racist incidents are fairly common, espe-\ncially in the form of refusal of service by businesses.\nHousing\n\"Open and blatant housing discrimination against foreigners\nis common in Japan\" (Befu, 2006, p. 3). Refusal of service\nby estate agents is widely reported in the literature. Most\nestate agents refuse to rent out their properties to foreigners.\nA recent case of a Belgian student in Kyoto who was told he\ncould not rent a flat because he was a foreigner was reported\nin The Japan Times (Scott, 2013). Recently, a colleague of\nthe author who was looking for housing was turned down\nby 9 out of 10 estate agents, citing \"Japanese only\" as the\nreason.\nRuru mamoranai (\"to disobey rule(s)\") is often cited by\nestate agents as the reason for refusing to rent out properties\nto foreigners. The rules in question can be the correct days\nfor putting out the correct rubbish or minimizing noise.\nEstate agents sometimes simply state that foreigners do not\nunderstand the Japanese language or do not know Japanese\nculture and, therefore, they do not want to rent out properties\nto foreigners. Befu (2006) points out that most Japanese\nregard these as reasonable excuses for not renting to foreign-\ners, regardless of the foreigner's actual grasp of the Japanese\nlanguage or culture.\nAfter having found estate agents who are willing to serve\nthem, foreigners are still not out of the woods. Guarantor or\nco-signers are usually required of renters in Japan. Guarantors\npay the rent if tenants fall behind or cause damage to the\nproperty. Landlords prefer relatives as guarantors, especially\nparents who are still working. One option is to have employ-\ners serve as guarantors, but this only applies to those with\njobs lined up and companies willing to commit. Even then,\nusing an employer as guarantor is potentially problematic.\nChanging jobs can be difficult. If the tenant loses his or her\njob, he or she could have nowhere to live. Another option is\nshared houses or dormitories for foreigners, but group living\nhas its drawbacks. Some companies specialize in short-term\nrentals for foreigners with no guarantors, but these properties\nare often not centrally located. There are companies that\noffer to act as guarantors for a fee, but some of them require\ntheir clients to provide guarantors before they agree to pro-\nThe guarantor system has existed in Japan in various\nforms since feudal times. In the Edo Period, tenants needed\ncaretakers who managed properties for landlords to act as\nguarantors for them if they wanted to rent, marry, or travel\nthrough official checkpoints. The current law concerning\nguarantors dates back to the Meiji Era, when the Civil Code\nwas written in 1896. Some aspects of the Civil Code are cur-\nrently being reviewed but the guarantor requirement for rent-\ners is not one of them. This requirement and the vertical\nrelationship between landlord and renter persist to this day\nMany foreigners do not know anyone in Japan when they\nfirst arrive, making it almost impossible to find a guarantor.\nAccording to one of the respondents in Morita (2015) who\nfound the guarantor requirement challenging,\n[I strongly disagree that it was easy for me to find housing in\nJapan.] It was very difficult to find housing in Japan. Based on\nmy experience, it took me more than 3 months to finally find an\napartment. The guarantor issue was the biggest hurdle for me. I\nhad to wait for my application for guarantor to be approved by\nthe university. So for 3 months, I stayed at Freebell apartments\nwhich do not require guarantor or deposit. It was a bit expensive\nstaying there, though. (p. 10)\nThe respondent above had to wait for a period of time for his\nrequest for his employer to serve as his guarantor to be pro-\ncessed. While he waited, he paid a premium for accommoda-\ntion that did not have a guarantor requirement. When his\napplication to his employer was finally approved, his\nemployer took out 2 months'rent from his salary as collateral\nDiscrimination Against Foreigners\nWhen United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\n(UNHCHR) Doudou Diene visited Japan in 2005, he reported\nthe existence of racism, racial discrimination, and xenopho-\nbia. In his report (UNHCHR, 2006), he called on the Japanese\ngovernment to acknowledge the existence of racial discrimi-\nnation and show the political will to combat it. He also rec-\nommended that a national anti-discrimination law should be\npassed and implemented, which to this day, has not.\nThe Japanese Constitution prohibits discrimination, but\nthe degree to which this can be enforced in practice is unclear.\nAccording to Article 14, \"All of the people are equal under\nthe law and there shall be no discrimination in political, eco-\nnomic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social\nstatus or family origin.\" The traditional view of a constitu-\ntion is that it protects an individual from the government, but\nit does not necessarily extend to discrimination by private\nindividuals. There is also a lack of sound legislation to ensure\nthese protections are upheld. This is in sharp contrast to\ncountries such as the United States in which it is spelled out\nexplicitly in legislation that discrimination is illegal. The\nlack of a statutory regime to enforce constitutional principles\nmeans that Japan takes a soft line when it comes to discour-\naging discrimination. It may be possible to challenge a par-\nticular incident through the courts or by bringing a complaint\nto a human rights committee, but neither may lead to a con-\ncrete result in terms of remedies (Scott, 2013).\nJapan is unique in that there are no laws protecting the\nlivelihoods or rights of non-Japanese. One hundred twenty-\nsix cases of discrimination toward foreigners were reported\nto the Bureau of Human Rights in 2007, which include\nrefusal of service by estate agents, hot springs, and hotels.\nThe Bureau only has the power to issue setsuji (\"explana-\ntion\" or \"warning\"), not redress measures.\nThe Japanese government ratified the International\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial\nDiscrimination (ICERD) in 1995, which is one of the most\nwidely ratified human rights conventions in the world.\nDespite ICERD's recommendation to the Japanese govern-\nment in 2001 to adopt specific legislation to outlaw racial\ndiscrimination, the Japanese Civil or Criminal Code still has\nno law specifically outlawing racial discrimination. Racial\ndiscrimination is unconstitutional and unlawful under the\nAna Bortz, A Brazilian journalist living in Japan, took to\ncourt the owner of a jewelry shop who refused to serve her\nbecause of her nationality. She won the case on the basis of\nthe ICERD. In 1999, the judge ruled that she had suffered\ndiscrimination and ordered compensation.\nRefusal of service to foreigners is fairly common in Japan.\nIn the high-profile Otaru onsen (\"hot spring\") case (1993-\n2005), \"Japanese only\" signs barred entry to foreigners in\nOtaru, Hokkaido. The following respondent in Morita (2015)\nhad similar experiences:\nOnce or twice I haven't been allowed into a Japanese onsen or a\nJapanese bar/izakaya because I wasn't Japanese. (p. 7)\nSakanaka's (2005) prediction, that \"there will likely be many\nwho would prefer to deal only with other Japanese people\nrather than foreigners with different customs and ideas,\" has\ncome true, particularly in customer service. Businesses\nwould rather forgo the profit they could potentially make\nfrom foreign customers than to serve foreigners. In March\n2014, the \"Japanese only\" banner displayed at the Urawa\nReds football match received negative publicity all over the\nworld.\nRefusal of service comes in more subtle forms, too:\nI have popped into a few small Japanese women's clothing\nstores where they used one English word to insult me and chase\nme off \"laaah-gie janai\" [No large--I presume] they said this 3\nsyllable phrase over and over tittering with their friends who\nwere in the shop. It was very absurd. In another similar case the\nwoman followed me around and pointed out all the clothes to\ninsist they were not large--I presume they didn't want me to try\ntheir clothes on, nor to frequent their shop!4\nThe respondent above is a medium-built Caucasian who\nwould be considered a Japanese size Large. It is possible that\nthe shops she visited stocked clothes up to Medium only. In\nany case, it is clear that the shops wanted her to leave, and the\nway they conveyed their message is unacceptable. The same\nmethod would never be used with Japanese customers.\nThere is a lack of awareness among the Japanese that for-\neigners in Japan do not enjoy the rights and privileges of the\nthe respondents answered \"yes\" to the question \"Should for-\neigners have the same human rights protections as Japanese?\"\n(Arudou, 2011). According to Saga Prefecture public prosecu-\ntor, Hiroshi Ichikawa, he was taught that foreigners had no\nhuman rights. Even the Japanese Constitution speaks of defin-\ning equality and fundamental human rights as being condi-\ntioned on nationality rather than being human.A2008 Supreme\nCourt decision made it clear that citizenship is essential to\nenjoying constitutional and human rights in Japan. There are\ndifferent standards in civil and criminal courts for citizens and\n4 SAGE Open\nnon-citizens. The government has repeatedly claimed\nthrough explicit exceptions and caveats made when signing\ntreaties that non-citizens do not qualify for protection against\nracial discrimination or for equal civil and political rights\nAMinistry of InternalAffairs and Communications (MIC;\n2006) report admits that previous efforts to tackle the\ninequalities faced by foreign residents have been insuffi-\ncient: \"It is hard to say that the corresponding actions of the\nministries and government offices have been adequate, nor\ncan it be denied that there has been a lack of comprehensive,\ncross-cutting measures\" (p. 2).\nThere is some differentiation and stratification within the\ncategory of foreigners on the basis of country of origin and\noccupation. According to Kobayashi (2010), the Japanese\ndiscriminates against foreign residents of the same or darker\ncolor or English speakers with an \"accent\" (i.e., non-native\nspeakers of English). In her study, she refers to a survey in\nwhich half of the Latin American respondents (n = 115)\nexperienced discrimination due to their skin color or nation-\nality. A similar differentiation can be found below:\nFrom my peers I learned that the image of \"foreigner\" associated\nwith the term gaijin is of Caucasian, blue-eyed, fair-haired\npeople. They are generally seen as more intelligent and\nfinancially better-off. . . . But there's also a non-Caucasian\nimage, referring to other Asians. They're regarded as lower\nstatus than Japanese: poor, unintelligent and badly educated. . . .\nI used to be told that Kankokujin (South Koreans) were OK, but\nChosenjin (North Koreans) were really low status, along with\nChinese, Filipino and other Asians. (Maher & Macdonald, 1995,\nDiscussion\nPrioritizing the protection of the perceived ethnic homogene-\nity of Japan does not always led to the best solution. Japan\nholds dear the principle of not allowing unskilled migration\nbecause of its perceived negative consequences for Japanese\nsociety. In the revision of the Immigration Act in 1998, the\ngovernment allowed the migration of unskilled nikkei\nBrazilians, granting them unrestricted working visas of vari-\nous lengths based on their presumed Japaneseness. This is\nbased on the rationale that the Japanese blood in the nikkei\nBrazilians meant the homogeneity of Japan would be pre-\nserved. However, this line of reasoning proved to be flawed.\nThese Latin Americans, even though of Japanese descent,\nturned out to be more different and foreign than workers\nfrom neighboring Asian countries, neither speaking the\nJapanese language nor practicing Japanese culture.\nHolding dear Japanese exclusionism is not always in\nJapan's best interests either. Japan has Economic Partnership\nAgreements (EPAs) with Indonesia, the Philippines, and,\nmore recently, Vietnam. The EPAs provide the regulations for\nthe migration of nurses and caregivers from these countries.\nDespite the acute shortage of registered nurses and caregiv-\ners, a problem particularly pressing in the face of a growing\nelderly population, the EPAs are described as \"a window-\ndressing to a strong, clear, and prevailing no to opening\nJapan's borders to an international workforce\" (Vogt, 2013,\np. 18). The Japanese government would rather alleviate the\nshortage by increasing the labor market participation of\nyouth and women and the use of care robots and technology.\nThis reflects the difficulties Japan has in coming to terms\nwith accepting and welcoming international labor migrants\nin large numbers. Japanese exclusionism is also manifested\nin the fact that the nurses'and caregivers'previously acquired\nskills are not fully acknowledged. Regardless of their work\nstatus in their respective countries, they have to work as\nnursing assistants and assistant caregivers in Japan until they\npass the national examination (Vogt, 2013).\nThe national examination is a major obstacle to nurses\nand caregivers from Indonesia and the Philippines. The\nexamination is in Japanese, and passing it is a necessary step\nfor being employed as certified nurses and caregivers as well\nas being granted long-term residency in Japan.An Indonesian\nnurse praised the efforts of a Japanese doctor who helped her\nwith her medical vocabulary for 2 hr every evening for a\nyear. She passed the national examination in her second\nattempt. However, she reported she was bullied by Japanese\nnurses, who considered her more of a burden than an equal\nWhen the Japanese government started campaigning for\ninternationalization in the mid-1980s, insularity and tenden-\ncies toward exclusionism were criticized and regarded as\nobstacles in the process of globalization. According to a\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA; 1985) Blue Paper, \"It is\nnecessary to overcome our insular/exclusionary quality by\ndeveloping the ability to tolerate and accept differences\"\nernment acknowledge Japanese exclusionism, it is aware that\nexclusionism can be a hindrance. More recently, politicians\nhave accepted the fact that welcoming foreigners is neces-\nsary given the aging and declining population. It is regarded\nas a necessary step to ensure Japan's future competitiveness\nIt is not possible to welcome foreigners if they are per-\nceived as agents disrupting the homogeneous social fabric of\nJapan. Issues pertaining to foreigners are often referred to as\ngaigokujin mondai (\"foreigner problem\"). The choice of the\nword mondai reflects the perception that foreigners contrib-\nute little to Japanese society, and that they have come to\nJapan to make money and have brought problems with them.\nAn example of a gaigokujin mondai discussed in the media\nis education for foreign children. Many Japanese do not see\nprovision of education for foreign children as the responsi-\nbility of the host society that benefits from the economic\ncontribution made by foreigners. Sakanaka (2005) shares\nthis view:\nWe do not often see Japanese people praising the work of foreign\nresidents and warmly welcoming them as friends and colleagues.\n. . . It is far more common to hear of problems--problems\nadjusting to society, problems with children's education,\nproblems of discriminatory treatment, housing problems, social\ninsurance problems--the list goes on and on. (Sakanaka, 2005)\nForeigners are also perceived as \"a burden,\" \"disrupters of\nthe traditional patterns of Japanese life,\" and \"causers of\nproblems.\" In Shinjuku, Tokyo, one of the reasons why\nJapanese language classes, cultural classes, multilingual\nadvisory services, and publications are provided is so that\nforeigners do not cause any intercultural friction or become a\nburden to the local government and Japanese residents.\nShinjuku's multicultural coexistence practices have a strong\nfocus on preventing intercultural friction between the\nJapanese and foreign residents. According to the managing\ndirectorofInternationalExchangeattheShinjukuFoundation\nfor Culture and International Exchange,\nMulticultural existence practices are not about creating a\nmunicipality that minorities want to come to; rather, it is about\nmaintaining the integrity of the Japanese community, ensuring\nthat the foreigners that do settle temporarily or for the long term\ndon'tdisruptthetraditionalpatternsofJapaneselife.Multicultural\ncoexistence programs provide foreign residents with knowledge\nabout Japanese customs and manners so they can avoid causing\nForeigners can be invaluable assets and should be\nacknowledged as such:\n. . . international migrants themselves--as part of border-\ncrossing flows--can be invaluable assets to each country's\ninnovative potential, and should be acknowledged as such. By\nsolely contemplating about the risks international migration\nposes to social stability and wage levels, we forfeit an opportunity\nto embrace their vibrant and diverse input to our societies,\nJapanese exclusionism and the insistence on maintaining the\nperceived ethnic homogeneity of Japan has prevented the\nJapanese from embracing foreigners' contribution to the\ncountry. Sakanaka (2005) suggests that Japan needs to move\naway from valuing homogeneity.\nIn the face of a rapidly aging and declining population and\nglobal competition, Japan's future will depend on whether it\ncan accept and welcome foreigners:\nJapan must recognize that globalization is here to stay, and should\nstake its very survival on accepting people elsewhere in the world\nas its brethren, and transforming itself into a much more\nmulticultural, diverse society. It will be a large task, but Japan is\npast the point where easy solutions will do. (Sakanaka, 2011)\nStopping the tide of globalization is impossible. The Japanese\ncan no longer live in a \"Japanese only\" world.
