    "abstract": "Abstract\nLow cardiovascular fitness is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adults. The \"fit\nbut fat\" concept suggests that cardiovascular fitness attenuates risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease\nindependent of body mass index (BMI), even among the obese. However, the proportion of U.S. adults considered both\nfit and obese is unknown. Thus, the purposes of this short paper were to estimate the proportion of U.S. adults who are\nobese yet have a high cardiovascular fitness level (fit but fat), and determine the independent effect of obesity on\ncardiovascular fitness. The study was a secondary data analysis of 4,675 adults (20-49 years) who completed a\nsubmaximal exercise test, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002). Cardiovascular\nfitness and body weight were expressed as continuous (estimated VO2max\n[ml.kg-1.min-1] and BMI [kg/m2]) and\ncategorical variables (low, moderate, and high cardiovascular fitness level; normal weight, overweight, and obese), the\nlater using sex and age-specific criteria from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study and standard BMI cut-points,\nrespectively. Using these methods, the prevalence of meeting the fit but fat definition among U.S. adults was 8.9%\nImportantly, the proportion of low, moderate, and high cardiovascular fitness differed significantly (p < 0.05) by BMI\nlevel. Using multiple regression, being obese was associated with a 9.2% lower estimated VO2max\ncompared to being\nnormal weight, even after controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and income. These results suggest that a small\npercentage of U.S. adults can be considered fit but fat, and that obesity is independently associated with reduced\ncardiovascular fitness. The likely explanation for the low proportion of U.S. adults who can be considered fit but fat is a\nlow level of physical activity, which constributes to both a positive energy balance and low fitness. Thus, engaging\nobese adults in physical activity that is sufficient to improve cardiovascular fitness may help to reduce not only body\nweight, but the excess health burden in this population.\nBackground\nHigh levels of physical activity and/or cardiovascular fit-\nness attenuate health risks associated with overweight\nand obesity [1-11], although it is unclear whether activity\nor fitness can eliminate the risks [12,13]. A common rec-\nommendation to improve both cardiovascular fitness and\npromote weight loss in the overweight and obese is to\nincrease physical activity [14]. However, physical activity\nlevels in the population are well below those recom-\nmended for health benefits [15], and rates of physician\ncounseling about healthful lifestyles in overweight and\nobese patients is also typically low [16].\nGiven the high rates of obesity and low rates of physical\nactivity in the population, it is unclear how many U.S.\nadults might be considered both fit and obese (\"fit but\nfat\"). The purpose of this short paper was to estimate the\nproportion of U.S. adults who are clinically obese by body\nmass index standards (BMI), yet have a high cardiovascu-\nlar fitness level as estimated from exercise testing in a\npopulation-based study. The author hypothesized that\ncardiovascular fitness levels differ significantly by BMI\nlevels, and that obesity is independently associated with\nreduced cardiovascular fitness.\nMethods\nSample\nThe study was a secondary data analysis of 4,675 adults\n20-49 years who had completed a submaximal exercise\n* Correspondence: duncag@u.washington.edu\n1 Department of Epidemiology, Nutritional Sciences Program, University of\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nDuncan International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2010, 7:47\ntest, from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-\ncol was reviewed and approved by the National Center\nfor Health Statistic's Institutional Review Board. Written\ninformed consent was obtained from all participants\nprior to testing.\nTesting\nDetailed procedures for the cardiovascular fitness com-\nponent of NHANES are available elsewhere [17]. Briefly,\nparticipants were screened using questionnaires and\nphysical examination. Individuals were excluded from\ntesting based on certain medical conditions, medication\nusage, and physical limitations that would interfere with\ncardiovascular responses to exercise. The fitness exam\nwas performed by health technicians trained using a\ncommon protocol. The goal of each test was to elicit a\nheart rate that was approximately 75% of the age-pre-\ndicted maximum (220-age). The test included a 2-minute\nwarm-up, two 3-minute exercise stages, and a 2-minute\ncool down period. Heart rate was monitored continu-\nously, and blood pressure was measured at the end of\neach stage, using an automated electronic monitor. Test-\ning was terminated in persons who exhibited abnormal\nsigns or symptoms (e.g., pain or pressure in the chest), or\nheart rate or blood pressure responses (e.g., heart rate >\n85% of predicted maximal heart rate, blood pressure >\nstage.\nMeasures\nThe primary outcome was estimated VO2max\n(ml.kg-\n1.min-1), calculated from the heart rate response to known\nlevels of submaximal work. Using sex and age-specific\ncriteria for adults 20-49 yr. from the Aerobics Center\nLongitudinal Study (ACLS), the estimated VO2max\nwas\nalso categorized as a low, moderate, or high level of car-\ndiovascular fitness. Specifically, low cardiovascular fit-\nness was an estimated VO2max\nbelow the 20th percentile of\nthe ACLS data of the same sex and age group, moderate\nfitness was between the 20th and 59th percentiles, and\nhigh fitness at or above the 60th percentile.\nHeight was measured with a stadiometer, and weight\non a self-zeroing scale with no shoes and wearing light\nclothing. BMI was calculated as kg/m2 (continuous vari-\nable), and also expressed as a categorical variable using\nstandard cut-points, where normal weight was BMI < 25,\ngraphic variables were obtained by self-report.\nAnalysis\nData were analyzed using SAS version 9.2 with survey\nsoftware. All analyses used the four-year full sample\nweights (wtmec4yr) to estimate means and 95% confi-\ndence intervals (CI), and the corresponding masked vari-\nance units (pseudo-primary sampling units [SDMVPSU]\nand pseudo-stratum variables [SDMVSTRA]) to estimate\nstandard errors of those means. Differences among con-\ntinuous outcomes by BMI level were tested using linear\nregression. Prevalence and differences for cardiovascular\nfitness level by BMI level were compared using the Wald\n2 test of association. The procedure provides design-\nadjusted tests of independence (no association) between\nrow (fitness level) and column (BMI level) variables. Mul-\ntiple linear regression was used to examine associations\nbetween cardiovascular fitness and BMI. Statistical sig-\nnificance was established at  = 0.05 a priori, and multi-\nple comparisons were adjusted using the Bonferroni\nmethod.

The distribution of cardiovascular fitness level\ndiffered significantly (p < 0.05) by BMI status. Overall,\n8.9% of subjects were obese and had a high cardiovascular\nfitness level, 17.4% were overweight and high fit, and 30%\nwere normal weight and high fit.\nThe distribution of cardiovascular fitness levels within\neach BMI level is provided in Figure 1. The proportion of\nsubjects with a high cardiovascular fitness level was over\n20 percentage points lower in obese compared to normal\nweight adults, whereas the percentage of low cardiovas-\ncular fitness was roughly 15 percentage points higher in\nthe obese compared to normal weight.\nRegression models were constructed to examine associ-\nations between estimated VO2max\nBMI, which was entered both as a continuous and cate-\ngorical variable.

This study demonstrates that a\nrelatively small percentage of U.S. adults, about 9%, can\nbe considered fit but fat. Furthermore, obesity is indepen-\ndently associated with reduced cardiovascular fitness at\nthe population level. In contrast, about 17% of U.S. adults\ncompleting the fitness-testing component of NHANES\nTable 2: Differences in major outcomes by body mass index level.\nNormal weight Overweight Obese\nEstimated VO2max\n(mean\nFitness Level (percentage) \u00a7\nData presented as the mean or percent and standard error (SE).

Both sex\nand race/ethnicity also differed significantly by BMI level\n(data not shown). Of note, there was a higher relative pro-\nportion of Non-Hispanic Black and lower proportion of\nNon-Hispanic White adults in the obese group. This dif-\nference may have contributed to the difference found in\nthe distribution of high cardiovascular fitness levels\nacross BMI levels. This is based on reports that Non-His-\npanic Black adults, particularly women, have lower car-\ndiovascular fitness levels than do other major race/\nethnicity groups tested in the NHANES sample [18,19].\nAlthough the percentage of adults who were fit but fat\nas defined in this study was relatively small across BMI\nlevels in the population (Table 2), a different picture\nemerges when examining cardiovascular fitness levels\nwithin each BMI level. Among obese adults, about 20%\nhad a low cardiovascular fitness level whereas 80%\nachieved a medium or high level (Figure 1). Among the\noverweight, 12.5% had low cardiovascular fitness and\n87.5% had medium or high fitness. These findings are\nsomewhat encouraging because they demonstrate that\noverweight and obese individuals can achieve a medium\nto high cardiovascular fitness level, which could poten-\ntially mitigate some of the deleterious effects of excess\nbody weight on health.\nOf course, not all studies demonstrate that high levels\nof cardiovascular fitness attenuate health risks indepen-\ndently of excess body weight, perhaps refuting the fit but\nfat concept. For example, Stevens and colleagues [9] con-\ncluded that although both fitness and fatness were risk\nfactors for mortality, being fit did not completely reverse\nthe increased risk associated with excess adiposity. Chris-\ntou et al. [20] found that body fatness was a better predic-\ntor of cardiovascular disease risk profile than aerobic\nfitness in healthy men. Finally, in the Quebec Family\nStudy [21], the effects of physical fitness on individual\ncomponents of the metabolic syndrome were attenuated\nafter considering total and abdominal adiposity.\nSimilarly, several studies have demonstrated that BMI\nmay be more important than is physical activity in pre-\ndicting development of adverse health outcomes [22-24].\nHowever, it is difficult to compare \"head to head\" results\nof various studies examining the relationships among\nphysical activity and/or physical fitness and BMI and/or\nadiposity with health because these measures describe\ndifferent concepts and are therefore not interchangeable.\nIndeed, as Blair and colleagues suggest in a comprehen-\nsive review [25], it is not possible at this time to conclude\nwhether activity or fitness is more important for health.\nSeveral limitations are noteworthy. First, NHANES is a\ncross-sectional survey, which negates drawing causal\ninferences as to the underlying relationship between car-\ndiovascular fitness and obesity. Related, BMI is an imper-\nfect surrogate measure of adiposity and the potential for\nmisclassification has been documented [26,27]. There is\nalso potential for misclassification of fitness level using an\nestimate of cardiovascular fitness from a submaximal\ninstead of a maximal, graded exercise test. Differences in\nthe proportions of low, moderate, and high cardiovascu-\nlar fitness among BMI levels may have been caused by a\npotential for bias or misclassification because the cut-\npoints used to define these levels were derived from the\nACLS, which is a mostly well-educated, white sample.\nFinally, the distribution of cardiovascular fitness levels by\nBMI levels among U.S. adults provided in this report may\nnot reflect the actual distribution in the population\nbecause of the select age and physical status of the sample\ncompleting exercise testing in NHANES.\nDespite the limitations noted, this study demonstrates\nthat few U.S. adults are both highly fit and obese across\nthe population. However, the data also demonstrate that\nobese and overweight adults can achieve a moderate to\nhigh level of cardiovascular fitness. The 20% or so most\nunfit overweight and obese adults are therefore optimal\ntargets for intervention. Because the common recom-\nmendation to improve both cardiovascular fitness and\npromote weight loss in the overweight and obese is to\nincrease physical activity [14], the findings from this\nreport might better serve to suggest that obese and over-\nweight individuals not only move around more (i.e.,\nincrease habitual physical activity), but that they move\naround more at a level that is sufficient to improve car-\ndiovascular fitness (i.e., activity of a sufficient dose).\nAlthough changes in cardiovascular fitness in response to\ntraining are variable and determined in part by genetic\nand common environmental factors [28-30], even small\nincreases in activity and/or fitness may provide health\nbenefits.\nCompeting interests\nThe author declares that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nGD conceived the study, performed the statistical analyses, and wrote the\nmanuscript.\nAcknowledgements\ngrants.
