Hume\nused the Negro as an example of those who do not have men-\ntal capacity. Hume asserts, in his renowned footnote,\nI am apt to suspect the Negroes, and in general all the other\nspecies of men (for there are four or five different kinds) to be\nnaturally inferior to the whites.1 There never was a civilized\nnation of any other complexion than white, nor even any\nindividual eminent either in action or speculation. No ingenious\nmanufacturers amongst them, no arts, no sciences . . . Not to\nmention our colonies, there NEGROE slaves dispersed all over\nEUROPE, of whom none ever discovered any symptoms of\ningenuity; tho' low people, without education, will start up\namongst us, and distinguish themselves in every profession.\nIn a similar vein on a geographical standpoint, Immanuel\nKant classified humans into different classes: \"white\"\n(European), \"yellow\" (Asians), \"black\" (Africans), and\n\"red\" (American Indians). From a psychological standpoint,\nthen, within Kant's classification, the American India that\ninhabit America, the Africa, the Asia, and the Hindustan\nappear to be incapable of moral maturity because they lack\n\"Americans are completely uneducable because they lack\n`affect and passion,' the Africans escape such a malheur, but\ncan only be `trained' or `educated' as slaves and servants\"\ndeserves this kind of \"training\" because he or she is lazy,\nprone to jealousy and hesitation (ibid). Kant argued that \"the\nAfrican is all these because, for climate and anthropological\nreasons, he or she lacks `true'(rational and moral) character\"\nMontesquieu is correct in his judgement that the weak-\nheartedness that makes death so terrifying to the Indian or the\nNegro also makes him fear many things other than death that the\nEuropean can withstand. The Negro slave from Guinea drowns\nhimself if he is to be forced into slavery. (pp. 62-64)\nKant goes further to attribute to the supposed grades of supe-\nriority and inferiority of race to the presence or absence of\n\"talent.\" Taking skin color as evidence of a racial class, Kant\nsaid that \"white skin, it seems, is only the concrete, physical\nevidence of this racial superiority . . . skin colour reveals race\nas species class and morally, as `difference in Character'\".2\nAs such, skin color, for Kant, is evidence of rational superi-\nority or inferiority.\nIn response to Hume and Kant, my aim in this article is to\nshow that the works of nationalist\u00adideological philosophers\nare evidence that Africans are not irrational or inferior\nWhites. I will discuss the works of the nationalist\u00adideologi-\ncal philosophers as evidence of the existence of African phi-\nlosophy, and hence as a refutation of Hume's and Kant's\n1University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa\nCorresponding Author:\nOvett Nwosimiri, School: University of KwaZulu-Natal, Golf Road,\nScottsville, Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal 3201, South Africa.\nEmail: ovettmore@gmail.com\nDo the Works of the Nationalist\u00ad\nIdeological Philosophers Undermine\nHume's and Kant's Ideas About Race?\nOvett Nwosimiri1\n Keywords\nnationalist\u00adideological philosophers, African, philosophy, African philosophy, race\n2 SAGE Open\nideas of the Negroes/Blacks, as captured above. My reason\nfor choosing this trend is that the nationalist\u00adideological\napproach actually helps to untie African from the yolk of\ncolonialism by showing that intellectual superiority and infe-\nriority are something that varies among individuals. Some\npersons are more gifted intellectually than others, and this is\nnot due to one's race or color. Even among people of the\nsame race, some display higher ingenuity than others.\nIn the first part of the article, I will briefly explain the idea\nof nationalist\u00adideological philosophy. I will explore the rea-\nsons that necessitated the development of nationalistic\u00adideo-\nlogical philosophy. In the next part, I will discuss the nature\nof nationalist\u00adideological philosophy, examining the ideas of\nConsciencism, Communalism, Humanism, Cultural Life,\nNegritude, Black Consciousness, and Pan-Africanism. I will\nshow that the existence of nationalist\u00adideological philosophy\nis evidence of the existence of African philosophy and hence\nserves to refute Hume's and Kant's ideas that Blacks are irra-\ntional and inferior to Whites.Against Kant's idea thatAfricans\n\"can only be `trained' or `educated' as slaves and servants,\" I\nwill argue that the philosophical knowledge that someAfrican\nphilosophers have acquired has falsified his ideas.\nNationalist\u00adIdeological Philosophy\nNationalist\u00adideological philosophy emanates from the ide-\nologies of national liberation movements. It arose before the\nindependent era inAfrica.And it also arose out of the convic-\ntion that political independence must be accompanied by \"a\ntrue mental liberation\" (Bodunrin, 1991, p. 64). In essence, it\nstarted off as a fight against colonial imperialistic ideologies\nin Africa. This philosophy \"advocates mental liberation and\na return to African humanism\" (Hapanyengwi-Chemhuru,\n2013, p. 46). The conviction that informs this philosophy is\nthat European model and its ideologies were not appropriate\nfor Africa. The nationalist\u00adideological philosophers used a\npractical way to convey their ideas through economic, politi-\ncal, social, and cultural transformation. Thus, it is not sur-\nprising to note that \"Nkrumah was deeply convinced that\nAfrica must rationalize the dominant intellectual strands in\nAfrica's historical experience and reinstate what was noble\nand everlasting in traditional African society\" (Mbonjo,\nattempt to deal with the problems of national and socialist\nWhat Necessitated Nationalistic\u00ad\nIdeological Philosophy\nNationalist\u00adideological philosophy was born out of the strug-\ngle for liberation ofAfricans from colonialism. Serequeberhan\n(1991, p. 3) explained that colonialism set the communist-\nsocial structure of African societies on the path to ruin, sup-\npressing the stable indigenous African societies, a situation\nthat left Africans wallowing in a miasma of confusion in\ntrying to fit in the shoes of their colonizers. Thus, the rich and\nsolid traditional African life and culture were distorted,\nbecause of colonialism. Africans lost their identity at the\nexpense of colonial powers. The aftermath of colonialism\npropagated \"pseudo\" ideas such as the conception that tradi-\ntional beliefs and social structures (culture and language) are\nflawed; hence, there is a need for \"civilization.\" This created\nthe idea of Africans being inferior to the Europeans.\nNationalist\u00adideological philosophy was necessitated by the\nravages of colonialism and the need for Africans to liberate\nthemselves politically, and decolonize their minds from\npseudo-ideas like White supremacy and Black inferiority.\nUpon realization of independence, many African leaders\nembarked on a quest for solutions to contemporary problems\nin Africa. They saw a need to restructure the disfigured and\ndistorted African society. Consequently, nationalist\u00adideolog-\nical philosophy can be understood as a reaction to the debased\nAfrican sociopolitical system which was created by colonial\npowers. It is a response to Western capitalist systems, eco-\nnomic imperialism, Marxism, and Western socialism.\nNationalist\u00adideological philosophy set out on the quest to\nreestablish and restructure the African social context after\ncolonialism. As Makumba (2007) avowed, this trend, \"com-\ning from the African worldview, was understood by Africa's\npioneer ideologies to be a worthy response to what had\nbecome a dehumanizing and exploitative situation brought\nabout by colonization\" (p. 135).\nNationalist\u00adideological philosophy is geared toward defin-\ning a unique African political system which not only decolo-\nnizes the African but also equips the nationalist\u00adideological\nphilosophers with solutions to contemporary African prob-\nlems. This political system is based on traditional African\nsocialism, humanism, familyhood, and the existential situa-\ntion in Africa (Coetzee & Roux, 1998, p. 96). The proponents\nof this trend include African leaders and statesmen such as\nL\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor (from Senegal), Kwame Nkrumah\n(from Ghana), Kenneth Kaunda (from Zambia) Julius Nyerere\n(from Tanzania), and Jomo Kenyatta (from Kenya), among\nothers. The trend is embodied in the various manifestos and\npolitical writings produced by these statesmen and leaders\nduring the African liberation struggle. The philosophical\nfoundation of this trend, as Makumba puts it, was \"influenced\nby the political and social urgency of their environment\"\ncies led these optimistic statesmen to formulate philosophical\nblueprints for the reconstruction of their respective countries,\nculturally, politically, socially, and economically.\nThe Nature of Nationalist\u00adIdeological\nPhilosophy\nNationalist\u00adideological philosophy, in essence, is an attempt\n\"to evolve a new and if possible, unique political theory based\non traditionalAfrican socialism and familyhood which Nyerere\ncalls ujamaa\" (Njoroge, 1986, p. 96). Nationalist\u00adideological\nNwosimiri 3\nphilosophy can be referred to as a philosophy of transition, \"a\nvoice crying in the wilderness,\" calling all Africans to con-\nsciousness of their own identity and personality (Makumba,\nreality and African social values. This social synthesis of the\nnationalist\u00adideological philosophy is geared toward political,\neconomic, social, religious, and cultural situations of pre\u00ad and\npost\u00adindependent era. Nationalist\u00adideological philosophy\naccording to Serequeberhan (1991, p. 20) consists of the \"man-\nifestos, the pamphlets and political works produced by the lib-\neration struggle.\" It encompasses the whole gamut of national\nliberation literatures and the African anti-colonial struggles in\nwhich pan-Africanism is inclusive. As a result, the literature\nthat has been produced in this time constitutes the basis of \"an\nAfrican philosophical discourse on politics\" (Serequeberhan,\n1991, p. 20). In other words, \"the political and philosophic\noutput of the African anti-colonial struggle as a whole has to\nbe understood as the originative grounding that is presup-\nposed by contemporary African intellectual works as such\"\nThe role of nationalist\u00adideological philosophy is that of\nassuming a leading position in the questions of the best options\nbefitting Africa's divergent conditions of social and political\norganization and re-examination and re-appraisal of traditional\nculture in the hope of identifying and preserving what is useful\nand worth developing from what is obsolete and fit for dustbin.\nAccording to the proponents of this movement, there is a\nnecessary connection between theory and practice, which is\npraxis; in a nutshell, it means a unification of theory and\naction. Nationalist\u00adideological philosophers are philoso-\nphers of action. These philosophers of the pre\u00ad and post\u00ad\nindependent era saw that theory alone could not solve the\nproblems of Africa, thus identifying the need to come up\nwith a pragmatic way of solving African problems. From the\nforegoing, it is clear that these philosophers aimed at radi-\ncal transformation of political, economic, social, and cul-\ntural aberrations in African because of the impact of\ncolonialism. It aimed at decolonizing the minds of Africans\nso that they could--and can--reassert themselves in the\nnationalist\u00adideological philosophers is their ardent zeal and\nclarion call for all Africans to return to their values and shun\neverything Western that is not in conformity with this noble\ngoal. Njoroge further asserts that the nationalist\u00adideological\nphilosophy could also be called \"political philosophy\"\nThe Philosophical Ideologies of the\nNationalist\u00adIdeological Philosophers\nWhat these African political thinkers have developed and\nthus have offered to Africans are ideas such as consciencism,\ncommunalism, familyhood, negritude, humanism, nation-\nhood, unification, socialism, and pan-Africanism. Below are\nbrief explanations of their ideologies.\nConsciencism\nConsciencism as presented by Nkrumah is the philosophy of\nthe African revolution which upholds the ideology of social-\nism and the redemption ofAfrican humanist society of the past\nthe map in intellectual terms of the disposition of forces which\nwill enable African society to digest Western and Islamic and the\nEuro-Christian elements in Africa, and develop them in such a\nway that they fit into the African personality. The African\npersonality is itself defined as the cluster of humanist principles\nwhich underlie the traditional African society. Philosophical\nconsciencism is that philosophical standpoint which, taking its\nstart from the present content of the African conscience,\nindicates the way in which progress is forged out of the conflict\nConsciencism is both revolutionary and evolutionary.\nConsciencism is revolutionary when it deals with colonial-\nism and capitalism. On the contrary, consciencism is evolu-\ntionary when it is \"considered in relation to the traditional\nAfrican society, whose guiding principles of egalitarianism\nand the concern of all for each it seeks to reassert and\nenthrone and regards as fundamental to any society or social\nmain values found in the traditional African society which\nneed to be guided or taken care of by the philosophical con-\nsciencism. The first is the idea of egalitarianism that all of us\nbelong to the same species without any discrimination. The\nsecond is that each person is responsible for the other as long\nas we live in a community. Consciencism has as starting\npoint the idea that in every society, there is a kind of explicit\nor implicit ideology. And this ideology defines a social cohe-\nHence, consciencism is meant to guide African ideology. In\nhis own words, Nkrumah affirms that \"philosophical con-\nsciencism builds itself by becoming a reflection of the objec-\ntivity, in conceptual terms, of the unfolding of matter\"\ntive of the notion of philosophical consciencism. Hence, it\nfollows according to philosophical consciencism \"that each\nman must be treated as an end in himself and not just as a tool\nNkrumah writes, \"The cardinal ethical principle of philo-\nsophical consciencism is to treat each man as an end in him-\nself and not merely as a means. This is fundamental to all\nsocialist or humanist conception of man\" (quoted in Mbonjo,\ncism will serve as the solid theoretical foundation on which a\ntruly unifying ideology for all Africa can be built (Mbonjo,\n4 SAGE Open\nThus understood, consciencism could not and cannot\naccommodate colonialism. The reason is that colonialism is \"a\ndoctrine of exploitation and a doctrine of alienating\" (Mbonjo,\n1998, p. 21). This implies that colonialism is a means by which\na colonial power secures material advantages for her own eco-\nnomic development. It is considered as a crude form of impe-\nrialism, which is the \"policy which aims at creating, organizing\nand maintaining an empire\" (Mbonjo, 1998, p. 22).As a result,\nAfrican political thinkers, reject colonialism, as well as the\nidea that it is to bring civilization to a people or to prepare\nthem for self-rule.At the Casablanca Conference of January 7,\n1961, Nkrumah made a speech which reads,\nFor my part, I must say that as long as I live, and as long as any\nlittle vestige of colonialism and imperialism remains in Africa, I\nshall prosecute a ruthless war on these monsters, a war in which\nthere shall be no truce. Colonialism and imperialism have no\nhonour, no shame, no morals and conscience. The devastation\nwhich they have brought in Africa is without parallel anywhere\nin the history of the world, but now Africans have arrived on the\nscene. We have arrested their progress and are determined to\ngive them battle with all the forces of our command until we\nhave achieved the total liberation of the African continent and\nhave built a strong Union of African states. As I have always\nstated, and as I will continue to proclaim, I can see no security\nfor African states unless African leaders like ourselves have\nrealized beyond all doubts that salvation for Africa lies in Unity.\nCommunalism\nAfrican traditional worldview encompasses \"an attitude towards\nthe human person, which can only be described, in its social\nHence,African communalism was considered the \"socio-politi-\ncalls this Ujamaa, meaning familyhood. This idea of African\nsocialism is opposed both to capitalism and to Marxist social-\nism.Afamily, according to Nyerere, embraces the whole human\nsociety. So it is \"the foundation, and the objective, of African\nsocialism . . . the trueAfrican socialist system regards all men as\nhis brethren--as members of his ever-extending family\"\nthrough the exploitation of one person by another, and Marxist\nsocialism seeks happiness through conflict between persons\"\nrooted in African communalism is \"an attitude of the mind\"\nhuman equality which \"has to be applied to the different sectors\nof society, namely economic, social and political\" (Makumba,\nHumanism\nIn the same line as Nyerere's ideas, Kaunda calls the attitude\ntoward the human person African humanism. This is because\nAfrica is human-centered and that ideology conquered colo-\nhumanist claim is that humanism is rooted in human person\nin relation with God.As a result,African humanism is closely\nrelated to Christian anthropology, where the human person is\ntruly human \"only before God and that the spiritual dimen-\nsion is an integral part of the human personality\" (Makumba,\nseeks to uphold and protect the dignity of the human person.\nIt is a form of socialism that is based on political, social,\ncultural, and economic aspects of the life of a human person\nand geared toward the improvement of the human life.\nKaunda saw a connection with Christianity, and he advo-\ncated religious beliefs as fitting complements to traditional\nAfrican society. Humanism was a tool to break away from\nthe colonial heritage and to develop and reconstruct an\nAfrican identity.\nCultural Life\nAmilcar Cabral sees cultural life as an element of resistance\nis a dependant and reciprocal connection between cultural\nfactor and the economic and political factor in the behaviors\nof human societies.\nIn fact, at every moment of the life of a society, culture is the\nresult, with more or less awakened consciousness, of economic\nand political activities, the more or less dynamic expression of\nthe type of relations prevailing within that society.

C\u00e9saire coined\nthe word \"negritude.\" His idea of negritude originated in his-\ntory, and it was one of bitterness and discomfort (Wolfers,\n1979). Thus, \"Negritude emerged as a concept with different\nresonances in, and applicable to, different contexts.

Senghor holds that \"the\nfamily in Africa encompasses all persons descending from a\ncommon ancestor who is responsible for the flame of life\ntransmitted to his descendants\" (Wolfers, 1979, p. 48). As a\nresult, negritude is all about pointing out the African values\nand their authenticity. For instance, Senghor stipulates that\nBlack man's emotivity is due neither to inherently superior\nsensory faculties nor to inherently inferior rational faculties, but\nto a particular attitude toward the external world and its apparent\ncomplexity. Essentially positive and dynamic, this attitude is a\ndirect result of the notion of life force and its intensification and\nthe tendency to relate to the external world as to a network of\nIt is important to underscore that Senghor may have been\ndisingenuous, but he is not at all innocent of the ongoing\nmodern racial battles \"over the meaning of reason and\nhumanity when he notoriously defended a thesis that, on the\nsurface, is unsurpassably droll: `Emotion is Negro, and rea-\nson Greek'\" (Eze, 2001 , p. 41). According to Eze, \"it is as if\nSenghor said, `Well, you keep your Reason; we have our\nEmotion. Besides, our Emotion is superior to your Reason'\"\nhow race plays itself in modern discourse.\nBlack Consciousness\nSteve Biko says that \"the basic tenet of black consciousness\nis that the black man must reject all value systems that seek\nto make him foreign in the country of his birth and reduce his\nbasic human dignity\" (Biko, 1971). What Biko is trying to\nbring to the awareness of the African masses is the injustice\nwrought on him by the apartheid era. His main point is that\nAfricans should seek to reject injustice and recognize her\nvalue, and Africans should stop feeling inferior in their own\nhome. In other words, he is insisting on a sense of superiority\ninstead of inferiority among Blacks. According to Biko,\nWhite people \"must be made to realise that they are only\nhuman, not superior. Same with Blacks. They must be made\nto realise that they are also human, not inferior\" (quoted in\nBiko, 1978b). What Biko is saying is that the White masses\nthat colonized and forced apartheid on the Black masses\nshould not treat Blacks as their inferiors. His idea is that the\nWhite masses are not better than the Blacks; in fact, all peo-\nple are equal and should be treated as such. Biko further said\nthat by merely \"describing yourself as black you have started\non a road towards emancipation, you have committed your-\nself to fight against all forces that seek to use your blackness\nas a stamp that marks you out as a subservient being\" (Biko,\n1978a). Thus, it is the responsibility of the Blacks to fight\nagainst oppression.\nPan-Africanism\nfor the generation that theorized the decolonization of Africa,\nthen, \"race\" was a central organizing principle. And, since these\nAfricans largely inherited their conception of \"race\" from their\nNew precursors, we shall understand Pan-Africanism's profound\nentanglement with that conception best if we look first at how it\nis handled in the work of the African-American intellectuals\nwho forged the links between race and Pan-Africanism. (p. 10)\nThe idea of African unity that these African political thinkers\nwere all emphasizing and advocating is mainly expressed in\nthe movement of pan-Africanism. The latter has as a basic\npremise that \"the people of Africa and of African descent\nthroughout the globe, constitute a common cultural and\npolitical community by virtue of their origin in Africa and\ntheir common racial, social and economic oppression\"\nthat in order to bring about effective action for the liberation\nand development of Africa, a political, economic, and cul-\n6 SAGE Open\npan-Africanism started to develop in the nineteenth century,\nwhen the countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone were\nformed to \"create a homeland in Africa for American Slaves\nthe expression \"pan-Africanism\" came into use with Henry\nSylvester Williams from Trinidad and William Edward\nBurghardt Du Bois of the United States (Mbonjo, 1998, p.\n125).

The works of some nationalist\u00adideological\nphilosophers have helped tremendously to show thatAfricans\nare capable of intellectual exercise. Many works of Africans\nor African philosophers have been done just to show their\ncontrast from that of the West, and to show that they are\nintellectually capable of engaging in the discourse.\nThe philosophical writings of some modern philosophers\nlike Hume, Kant, and Hegel aroused psychological defen-\nsiveness by most modern African intellectuals when they\ncame across intellectual racial discrimination and anti-\nAfrican prejudices. Appiah, for example, writes, \"Few con-\ntemporary readers are likely to be undisturbed when they\ndiscover the moments when Africa is banished from Hegel's\nsupposedly universal history and when Hume declares, in the\nessay on `National Characters,' that blacks are incapable of\nand Kant's classification or hierarchical chart on the different\n\"races.\" Appiah's statement, the idea of race, and other colo-\nnial and neocolonial exploitation and degradation of African\nhumanity, reawakens the existence of African philosophy. I\nuse the term \"reawakens\" because African philosophy\nexisted, even before colonization. It was as a result of the\nEuropeans misinterpretation of African cultures, ideas, and\nways of life that Africans reinforced their ideas so that the\nEuropeans could better understand their philosophy. This\nwas done after many African scholars assimilated European\nculture and lifestyle, through education.\nThe term \"Africa,\" while generally taken to refer to a par-\nticular geographical area located at the South Pole, has been\nbedeviled by different ill conceptions. Terms like \"the land of\nDarkness,\" \"the dead end,\" \"the cold-less,\" or \"sunny-land\"\nhave been used to describe the continent. As Mogobe B.\nRamose (2003) noted, these derogatory expressions of some\nanthropologists point to the fact that the history of Africa is\nmainly the history of West European experience of \"Africa\"\nand only incidentally is it the story of the peoples of the con-\ntinent about themselves. By implication, all that arises from\nAfrica is thought to be barbaric and unworthy of being\ncounted among the credence of human achievement. To this\nend, the likes of Hume and Kant would categorizeAfricans as\nirrational beings who are unable to engage in critical reflec-\ntion upon their own experience. This thought ofAfrican back-\nwardness further drove Europeans, albeit their greed for\nAfrican's wealth, to invade the continent with the idea of civi-\nlization. From this backdrop, the existence of African philos-\nophy is denied. The above also imprints in Kant's and Hume's\nminds their wrong views of Blacks. They see Blacks as irra-\ntional and inferior to the Whites. But this is a false idea.\nEtymologically, philosophy is the love of wisdom. It is an\nart of critical reflection upon lived experience. Taken as\nsuch, African philosophy ought to seek to reflect critically\nupon the lived experience of the people. So, when we talk\nabout African philosophy, we are talking about works that\nrelate to Africa. It can be philosophical works from Africans\nthat contribute to one's understanding ofAfrica andAfricans,\nbased on the person's experience of African culture.\nAccording to Oruka, African philosophy in the above sense\n\"is considered in the terms of African past, current, or poten-\ntial contribution to philosophy in the strict meaning of the\nideas on African philosophy is the contextual specificity of\nAfrican philosophy. This is necessary taking into consider-\nation that African philosophy has long been silenced by the\nWest. In response, Africa must speak up for herself and about\nherself. This is crucial also for the need to divest Africa and\nher mode of thought of any undue colonial influence. As\nWiredu (1984) aptly noted, this task must be carefully car-\nried out with a double critical stand toward both what is\nWestern and African. African philosophers must not shy\naware from taking a critical stand toward elements within\ntheir cultural worldview that is inimical to rational thought,\nnor should they accept as axiomatic any conceptual work\nfrom the West. On the contrary, both traditions can offer phi-\nlosophers materials upon which they can conduct their\nreflection. Thus, African philosophy can been see as written\nand unwritten/oral reflection of thinkers based on the ways in\nwhich African people of the past and the present critically\nmake sense of their existence, heritage, religion, customs,\ntheir tradition and culture, and the world they live in.\nAs a reminder, we should note that the contextual specific-\nity spoken of earlier should not be taken to be a report of cul-\ntural or communal worldview of a community within Africa.\nThis is what Oruka (2002) called ethno-philosophy. In the face\nof criticisms from outside Africa, African philosophy must\noutgrow collective worldview. Because philosophy is primar-\nily about independent thought of persons about phenomena of\ntheir experience, the works of the trend in African philosophy\ncan be useful to professional philosophers as a material for\nNwosimiri 7\nreflection. More importantly, contextual specificity should\ntake into consideration the diversity ofAfrican cultures; as it is\nsometimes said, \"there is not one Africa but many.\" In this\nlight, Wiredu (1996) made a point by alluding that African\nphilosophy \"have to be intensive studies of those elements of\nculture that play significant roles in the constitution of mean-\nings in the variousAfrican world views\" (p. 159). This is a call\nfor particularistic studies that avoid hasty generalization.\nTo this end, one may object that this culture of specificity\ncan hamper intra-African and international philosophical\ndialogue. This objection need not concern us given that a\nparticularistic study done in a culture that interprets the lan-\nguage of that culture can spur a similar project in another.\nThis would throw light on concepts with which communica-\ntion can be carried out. After all, dialogue presupposes\nunderstanding of differences as well as similarities. \"If we\nunderstand `philosophy' as the tradition to which Plato and\nAristotle, Descartes and Hume, Kant and Hegel belong, then\nat least the following concepts are bound to be regarded as\ncentral to that canon: beauty, being, causation, evil, God,\ngods, good, illusion, justice, knowledge, life, meaning, mind,\nperson, reality, reason, right, truth, understanding, and\nwrong,\" we will understand that both Western and African\nphilosophers have engaged themselves in an ongoing task on\nthese concepts, based on their own view and understanding,\nin search of similarities and differences (Appiah, 1992,\npp. 86-87). No doubt, that not all cultures have the above\nconcepts, but any philosopher talking or discussing about\nany of this concept, engage with it in contrast and in connec-\ntion to his or her own culture. I think that many works of\nAfricans or African philosophers with have been done just to\nshow their contrast from that of the West.\nThe idea of \"African philosophy\" as a field of inquiry thus has\nits contemporary roots in the effort ofAfrican thinkers to combat\npolitical and economic exploitations, and to examine, question,\nand contest identities imposed upon them by the Europeans.\nThe arrival of the colonizers inAfrica marked the interchange\nof modernity and tradition. It is in light of this interchange that I\nwould like to congratulate nationalist\u00adideological philosophers\nfor acting as a backdrop to subsequent philosophical undertak-\nings which were in aid of either redefining or redeeming the\nAfrican self-concept and ultimately human nature.\nHow Is the Nationalist\u00adIdeological\nPhilosophy and the Existence of African\nPhilosophy an Indirect Response to\nHume's and Kant's Ideas About the\nNegroes/Blacks?\nAccording to Mogobe B. Ramose, \"the struggle for reason--\nwho is and who is not a rational animal--is the foundation of\nracism\" (Ramose, 2003, p. 3). David Hume and Immanuel\nKant are good examples of the above statement. Hume\nbelieved that \"some races have high levels of mental capaci-\nties and that others do not\" (Eze, 2001, p. 66). Kant believes\nthat \"white skin, it seems, is only the concrete, physical evi-\ndence of this racial superiority skin colour reveals race as\nspecies class (Klassenunterschied) and morally, as `differ-\nenceinCharacter'(\"VerschiedenheitdesNaturcharakters\")\"3.\nthe presence of an inflammable \"substance\" phlogiston in the\nAfrican's blood makes the skin colour \"black\" and, by analogy\nand extrapolation is assumed to be responsible for the skin\ncolour of other \"race\" or \"racial\" distinctions. He nevertheless\nmaintained throughout a hierarchical extrapolation of these\nFrom their ideas, it is quite clear that race is a real issue that\naffects Africans in various ways. Arguably, the issue of race\ncan be cited as a prime factor that makes \"African Philosophy\nlabour under this yet-to-end exploitation and denigration of\nAfrican humanity. It challenges the long-standing exclusion\nas the negative `other' of reason and of the western world in\nthe major traditions of modern Western philosophy\" (Eze,\nNationalist\u00adideological philosophy and trends of African\nphilosophy can be conceived as an indirect response to Hume\nand Kant. To emphasize this point, I will say that the nation-\nalist\u00adideological philosophy has helped tremendously in the\nrestoration of African pride. The writings of the philosophers\nin this trend are a visible example, and it encompasses the\nwhole gamut of African values in her political, economic,\nand cultural values. They disentangled African society \"from\nits yolk of colonialism, and then revert to former cardinal\nprinciples of traditional African\" (Ochieng-Odhiambo, 2010,\nKant explains that Africans \"can only be `trained'or `edu-\ncated'as slaves and servants.\" Against this idea, the national-\nist\u00adideological philosophers and other African philosophers/\nscholars show that they can assimilate European culture and\nlifestyle, through education. This is evident today in the way\nAfricans live, in the nature of their studies, and their com-\nmunication with others. It was as a result of the Europeans\nmisinterpretation of African culture, ideas, and way of life\nthat the nationalist\u00adideological philosophers reinforced their\nideas so that the Europeans can better understand their phi-\nlosophy. Following this view, the existence of African phi-\nlosophy can also be considered as refutation of the ideas of\nHume and Kant. To emphasize this point, Eze says that\nAfrican philosophy as a field of inquiry thus has its contemporary\nroots in the effort of African thinkers to combat political and\neconomic exploitations, and to examine, question, and contest\nideates imposed upon them by Europeans. The claims and\ncounter-claims, justifications and alienations that characterize\nsuch historical conceptual protests and contestations indelibly\n8 SAGE Open\nAgainst Hume's and Kant's ideas that Africans are infe-\nrior to the Whites and are irrational beings who are unable to\nengage in critical reflection upon their own existence, I will\nsay that in this case the nationalist\u00adideological philosophers\nused their mental and rational capacities to address and artic-\nulate issues concerning Africa. And this is no different from\nwhat the Europeans or modern Western philosophers have\ndone. All human being, as rational animals, are endowed\nwith these capacities, and all societies are confronted by\nthese ultimate questions. Because we apply reason in all that\nwe do, reasoning does not belong to anyone; it is part of\nnature.\nSenghor \"advocated some kind of symbiosis within the\nAfrican context, for some dominant suppositions within both\nthe West and Africa context\" (Ochieng-Odhiambo, 2010,\np. 151). Senghor stipulates that\nBlack man's emotivity is due neither to inherently superior\nsensory faculties nor to inherently inferior rational faculties, but\nto a particular attitude toward the external world and its apparent\ncomplexity. Essentially positive and dynamic, this attitude is a\ndirect result of the notion of life force and its intensification and\nthe tendency to relate to the external world as to a network of\ninteracting forces. (Senghor quoted in Wolfers, 1979, p. 75)\nThe above explains his idea of the meaning of reason and\nhumanity. The above reaction from Senghor is an example\nthat better describes and informs us how the concept of race\nhas affected some Africans. It explicitly shows Africans'\nawareness of racial consciousness and their intellectual urge\nto defend it, without the foreknowledge of them being racist\nat the same time. And this was what works and writings of\nthe nationalistic\u00adideological philosophers actually defended.\nTherefore, against Hume's and Kant's misunderstanding of\nAfrica, I would like to say that the conceptual transforma-\ntions that have been happening through the centuries, in both\nAfrica and Europe, attest to the fact that our articulation of\nreality is a highly contested terrain.\nKant further attributed the supposed grades of superiority\nand inferiority of race to the presence or absence of \"talent.\"\nSkin color for Kant was proof of rational superiority or infe-\nriority. His position on the importance of skin color was\nobvious in a statement he made on the question of the reason-\ning of a Black person: \"This fellow was quite black from\nhead to foot, a clear proof that what he said was stupid\".4 As\nsuch, Skin color has been the primary common sense crite-\nrion for racial classification, membership, and identification.\n\"Skin colour differences are taken for granted as evidence of\nracial difference, if not considered to be racial differences in\nthemselves, then skin colour is assumed to be the evolution-\nary result of ancestral geographical environment\" (Zack,\n2002, p. 42). According to Zack, there are problems with this\nassumption, one being \"using an evolutionary geographical\nmodel to explain skin colour differences.\" Zack further\nexplains the problems when she states that\nPeople with dark skin are present in cold climates, and light skin\nis not necessarily an adaptive advantage in cold climates that\nhave less sunlight, because recent evidence suggests that vitamin\nD can be stored in the body. Even more recent evidence suggests\nthat skin color differences around the globe are adaptive\nresponses to the amount of ultraviolent light present. UV light is\nnecessary to produce vitamin D-3 and folate, which support fetal\ngrowth, and more of it is absorbed by lighter than darker skin.\nToo much UV light causes skin cancer, and too little retards fetal\nZack further asserts that there are two important problems\nwhen we use skin color as the basis for race. The first problem\nis an obvious one; it is based on the idea that \"apart from cus-\ntom, there is no reason to believe that skin colour differences\nare in themselves, or in combination with other biological dif-\nferences, sufficiently important to provide a basis for a human\nsecond problem is that \"while skin colour is accepted as a\nfoundation for racial difference in society, in nature there are\nno distinct groups. Furthermore, the geographical continuity\nof human skin colour is not an isolated pattern of human phe-\n\"Race,\" in Kant's view, is based upon an ahistorical prin-\nMontesquieu is correct in his judgement that the weak-\nheartedness that makes death so terrifying to the Indian or the\nNegro also makes him fear many things other than death that the\nEuropean can withstand. The Negro slave from Guinea drowns\nhimself if he is to be forced into slavery. The Indian women burn\nthemselves. The Carib commits suicide at the slightest\nprovocation. The Peruvian trembles in the face of an enemy, and\nwhen he is led to death, he is ambivalent, as though it means\nnothing. His awakened imagination, however, also makes him\ndare to do something, but the heat of the moment is soon past\nand timidity resumes its old place again. . . . The inhabitant of\nthe temperate parts of the world, above all the central part, has a\nmore beautiful body, works harder, is more jocular, more\ncontrolled in his passion, more intelligent than any other race of\npeople in the world, that is why at all points in time these peoples\nhave educated the others and controlled them with weapons.\nWhat the above simply shows is the reaction of different\nraces when any of them was being forced into slavery. The\nNegro slave from Guinea decided to drown himself because\nhe was being forced into slavery, while the Indian women\ndecided to burn themselves on the same account of slavery.\nOther races also had their own reaction when they were\nbeing forced into slavery. So the idea of all suicide as irratio-\nnal is one way to understand the broader view of Kant's argu-\nment as ahistorical. Despite this background, I however think\nthat the actions of the individual (Kant's examples) show that\nthey were aware of what they will go through if they were\nsubjected to slavery. In my view, this can be used against\nNwosimiri 9\nKant's argument on human knowing, because reasoning is a\nfree gift to humanity. How we as humans and individuals use\nit is up to us. Whether we make a wrong judgment or a right\njudgment, what counts at the end is the fact that we made use\nof it. In the above case, the different examples of people that\nKant mentioned could identify with the \"I.\" That very act of\nidentification makes them a thinking thing. Their conscious-\nness had reached the objective existence, which in turn made\nthem to be more aware that it was better to die, than to be\nenslaved and tortured to death in the hands of the Europeans.\ndo terrible things from blind sentiments and impulse, not\nbecause they did not think about the outcome of their actions,\nbut because they are merely taking means perceived as nec-\nessary to achieve ends prompted by their non-rational incli-\nnations\" at that point in time. This is the reason why Hill and\nBernard argued that Kant was obviously aware of but\nignored. This also is a claim I concur with on the basis that as\nhumans, we must first have a concrete consciousness of who\nwe are and what we want to do. This is to say, we cannot\nknow or be conscious of something without participating in\nthat thing and being participated in by that thing.\nConsciousness paves the way for reasoning. When one is\nconscious of something, it creates room for thoughts about\nthat particular think before one's action follows. One's mind/\nreasoning/thought has to work in a coherent way with one's\nactions. The action of that Negro and that of the other people\nthat Kant used as an example better explains a reasoning that\ncoincides with their actions. Thus, in the face of slavery they\nthought of what to do to escape slavery and this for me is\ncoherent reasoning in display.\nAgainst Kant's idea of human classification, Appiah\nasserts that the classification of human beings does not\nreflect any deep facts about humans in general. In other\nwords, the concept of race does not reflect any deep facts\nabout human beings. Human beings as we know have differ-\nent purposes to achieve in life, so the classification of humans\ndoes not tell us which races we should value, as \"the num-\nbers in the Dewey decimal system does not correspond with\nqualities of utility or interest or literary merit\" (Appiah,\n\"The notion of race that was recovered would be of no\nbiological interest--the interesting biological generaliza-\ntions are about genotypes, phenotypes, and their distribution\nthe above biological classification or generalizations, the\nnotion of race would be of no biological interest because all\nhumans are linked with each other and there is no need to\nclassify people into different races based on human descent.\nAccording to Appiah, if there arises any need for the classifi-\ncation, \"we could just as well classify people according to\nwhether or not they were redheaded, or redheaded and freck-\nled, or redheaded, freckled, and broad-nosed too, but nobody\nclaims that this sort of classification is central to human biol-\nappeal of race as a classificatory notion provides us with an\ninstance of a familiar pattern in the history of science\"\n(Appiah, 1992, p. 38). Scientists started the idea of classifi-\ncation and categorization based on their folk theory of the\nworld. Gradually science developed and became the sole\ntools for a deeper understanding of things around us. Thus,\n\"in early chemistry, colour and taste played an important role\nin the classification of substances; in early natural history,\nplant and animal species were identified largely by their\nthe above and scientists' methods of discovery and organiza-\ntion, classification becomes a special activity. \"The benefit\nwe gain is that we are able to make generalization of greater\ntage is that we seem to always classify things that do not\nneed to be classified.\nConcluding on this discourse, Appiah states that\nThe truth is that there are no races: there is nothing in the world\nthat can do all we ask race to do for us. As we have seen, even\nthe biologist's notion has only limited uses, and the notion that\nDu Bois required, and that underlies the more hateful racism of\nmodern era, refers to nothing in the world at all. The evil that is\ndone is done by the concept and by easy--yet impossible--\nassumptions as to its applications.\nTo call it \"biologizing\" is not, however, to consign our concept\nof race to biology. For what is present there is not our concept\nbut our word only. Even the biologist who believe in human\nraces use the term race, as they say, \"without any social\nimplication.\"5 What exists \"out there\" in the world--\ncommunities of meaning, shading variously into each other in\nthe rich structure of the social world--is the province not of\nIt is important to underscore that the outlook of Appiah's\nargument in defense of the concept of race lies on his idea\nthat race is an illusion and that the concept of race cannot do\nanything for us. More so, the biological idea of race is of\nlimited use because what biologists seem to suggest about\ngenetic idea of race based on the idea of classification is dif-\nferent from the historical theory of evolution. Thus, Appiah\nbelieves that race is relatively unimportant because it does\nnot explain the biological difference among human beings.\nAn unmistakable feature of the African continent is its\ncultural and ideological plurality. We cannot subscribe to any\nessentialist notion of African thought, except that, as mem-\nbers of human race living on the African continent, we can\nall account for an innate capacity to use our mental and ratio-\nnal capacities. I believe that there are some questions which\nhave been accorded greater emphasis in African and those\nthat need more emphasis, depending on the particular era of\nAfrican history. The concept of race is one of these ques-\ntions. The arrival of the colonizers in Africa marked the\ninterchange of modernity and tradition. Out of this conten-\ntious union there are some questions, one of which is the\nunderlying concern of the concept or race and African identi-\nties. It is to this regard that Chinua Achebe said,\nIt is, of course true that the African identity is still in the making.\nThere isn't a final identity that is African. But, at the same time,\nthere is an identity coming into existence. And it has a certain\ncontext and a certain meaning. Because if somebody meets me,\nsay, in a shop in Cambridge, he says \"Are you from Africa?\"\nWhich means that African means something to some people.\nEach of these tags a meaning, and a penalty and a responsibility.\nmeaning is not always one we can be happy with, and identity is\none we must continue to reshape. And in thinking about how we\nare to reshape it, we would do well to remember that the African\nidentity is, for its bearers, only one among many. (p. 177)\nMasolo also gives a better explanation of African identity\nusing the word \"return\" in C\u00e9saire's book. According to\nMasolo, the word \"return,\" which appears in the title of\nC\u00e9saire's poem, Return to My Native Land, is a term\nwhich symbolizes many aspects of the struggle of the peoples of\nAfrican origin to control their own identity . . . a symbolic call to\nall black peoples to rally together around the idea of common\norigin and in a struggle to defend that unifying commonality . . .\n--a uniting idea of common origin for all black peoples.\nThis commonality became their identity tag and a language\nthat expresses African's unification. This is exactly what the\nnationalistic\u00adideological philosophers and the existence of\nAfrican philosophy have actually shown.\nConclusion\nAs a refutation of Hume's and Kant's ideas of the Negroes/\nBlacks, the main aim of this article has been to show that the\nworks of nationalist\u00adideological philosophers are evidence\nthat Africans are not irrational or inferior to Whites. I started\nwith a brief explanation on the nationalist\u00adideological phi-\nlosophy. As I said earlier, my reason for choosing the nation-\nalist\u00adideological philosophers and their thoughts and\nwritings is that these works actually helped to untie African\nfrom the yolk of colonialism. The nationalist\u00adideological\nphilosophers are the ones that started the movement of\nchange. This trend is a viable alternative because the philo-\nsophical ideology of these philosophers is an ardent call for\nall Africans to return to their values. I explored the reasons\nbehind nationalist\u00adideological philosophy. I then proceeded\nto discuss the nature of nationalist\u00adideological philosophy.\nFollowing from that, I discussed the philosophical ideologies\nof the proponents of the trend, one after the other. In the fol-\nlowing section, I argued that the philosophical pride that\nsome African philosophers and the existence of African phi-\nlosophy have acquired has falsified Hume's and Kant's ideas\nthat Blacks are irrational and inferior to the Whites. I con-\ncluded the article by explaining why I think the nationalist\u00ad\nideological philosophy is a refutation of the ideas of race of\nHume and Kant.\nAuthor's Note\nThe underlying research materials related to my article can be\naccessed from a wide range of already published materials like\nbooks and articles in academic journals.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. \"We should keep in mind, therefore, that when Hume says that\nsome races are inferior to others, and the evidence for this is\nthat the inferior ones lack the science and the arts, he is saying,\nin effect, that members of the inferior races are ontologically\n(psychologically) and functionally (cognitively) deficient\"\n2.
