Given the high\ndegree of structural homology of one of the domains of its\napolipoprotein(a) component with plasminogen, one\nproposed mechanism is interference with thrombolysis\n[1,3]. Adults of African descent have mean levels of Lp(a)\napproximately twice those of Europeans but do not have\ncommensurately increased risk of atherosclerotic disease;\nnor has Lp(a) been shown to be a coronary artery disease\nrisk factor in Blacks [4,5]. The explanations for the differ-\nential effects of Lp(a) on CVD risk among different popu-\nlations are poorly understood. Because birth weight has\nbeen shown to influence levels of Lp(a) [6], and adverse\npatterns of blood lipids and atherosclerosis itself begin in\nchildhood, studies of population and individual differ-\nences in the early onset and progression of risk factors\nthrough adolescence are important [7]. Given the\nreported contribution of intrinsic factors, family history,\nand environmental factors to the CVD risk in adults [8-\n10], the identification of inherited risk markers and envi-\nronmental variables that may interact with levels of Lp(a)\n> 30 mg/dl to modify its influence on the development of\natherosclerosis at an early age, is therefore imperative.\nFew studies have examined the epidemiology of Lp(a) in\nrepresentative samples of total populations of children\nand adolescents[11,12]. However, no study has examined\nwhether the effects of inherited and acquired or environ-\nmental factors interact with Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl, to cause dif-\nferential attributable risk in different populations using\ndata from a nationally representative sample of children\nin the US. We utilized data from a national survey of over\nlipid data to examine correlates of Lp(a) in children and\nadolescents and specifically to determine whether: [1] eth-\nnic differences in shape of Lp(a) distributions seen in\nadults are also seen as early as age 4 in children; [2] family\nhistory of cardiovascular disease is associated with higher\nlevels of Lp(a); [3] the effects of ethnicity and family his-\ntory of CVD on the levels of Lp(a) are influenced by low\nbirth weight, other personal, behavioral or environmental\nvariables.\nMethods\nData for this analysis was obtained from The Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES-III) conducted on a nationwide multi-stage\nprobability sample of about 40,000 persons from the\ncivilian, non-institutionalized population aged 2 months\nand over of the United States excluding reservation lands\nof American Indians. Of these, 31,311 were examined.\nOur analysis was restricted to children aged 4\u00ad11 years\nand 504 Mexican Americans) with valid Lp(a) measure-\nDetails of the planning, sampling, operation, informed\nconsent procedures, and measures taken to maintain con-\nfidentiality of information have been previously detailed\nDemographic, medical history and behavioral informa-\ntion were collected prior to the examination by household\ninterview of the parents or guardians of children and of\nadolescents aged 12 and over. Parents of children aged 2\nmonths-11 years were asked \"How much did the child\nweigh at birth?\". Parents responding \"don't know\" were\nasked \"Did the child weigh more than 5 1/2 pounds\n(2500 grams) or less? Responders were then asked, \"Did\nthe child weigh more than 9 pounds (4100 grams) or\nless?\" An approximate category of weight at birth was cre-\nated by combined responses to exact birth weights and the\nlatter two questions. Participants' parent or guardian was\nalso asked, \"Has either of the biological parents ever been\ntold by a doctor that he or she had a) high blood pressure\nor stroke before age 50 b) heart attack or angina before the\nage of 50? c) high blood cholesterol at any age? d) diabe-\ntes at any age? All \"Yes\" responses were followed by\n\"Which, father, mother, or both?\" Other interview varia-\nbles are described elsewhere [13].\nBlood samples were obtained at the examination centers\n[14]. A subsample of persons 12 years and over was asked\nto fast overnight for the examination of lipids in the\nmorning. Lp(a) in serum was measured immunochemi-\ncally by using an enzyme-lined immunosorbant assay\n(ELISA) (Strategic Diagnostics, Newark, DE) [14], which\ndoes not have cross reactivity with plasminogen or LDL\nnon sensitive to apo(a) size heterogeneity. The normal\nrange was set at 0 to 30 mg/dL because concentrations\nabove 30 mg/dL have been associated with increase risk\nfor coronary heart disease and stroke [1,3] (Plasma con-\ncentrations were 3 % lower than serum concentrations).\nThe quality control of the Lp(a) assay has been described\nin detail elsewhere [14]. Serum samples with Lp(a) > 80\nmg/dL were diluted into the assay range with sample\ndiluent.\nSerum total cholesterol were determined at the Centers for\nDisease Control using a modified ferric chloride tech-\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL) was measured in serum\nfollowing the precipitation of other lipoproteins with a\npolyanion/divalent cation mixture and triglycerides were\nmeasured enzymatically by Hitachi 704 Analyzer autoan-\nalyzer (Boehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics). LDL choles-\nterol level was calculated by the Friedewald equation for\nindividuals 12 years and older who were examined in the\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nmorning and fasted 9 hours or more, and whose triglycer-\nide concentration was less than or equal to 400 mg/dL.\nBecause fasting was not required in children, LDL could\nbe calculated on only 15% of this sample. In selected anal-\nyses, serum total cholesterol was corrected for Lp(a) cho-\nlesterol as follows: TCc = TC - Lp(a) \u00d7 0.30 [11]. Standing\nheight was measured to the nearest 0.1 centimeter, weight\nto the nearest 0.01 kg, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac and\nmid-thigh skinfold thickness to the nearest 0.1 millimeter\nand waist and buttocks circumference to the nearest 0.1\nStatistical analysis\nPopulation estimates for many of the variables other than\nLp(a) have been published by the National Center for\nHealth Statistics [14,17]. Because, body weight, family\nhistory, socio-economic factors including income, gender,\nethnicity, birth weight and regional diversity have been\nshown to influence levels of Lp(a) and or CVD risk in gen-\nand correlates of Lp(a) were mindful of these factors. In\norder to ensure adequate weight for a given age group, and\nto examine pre- peri- and post pubertal effects on levels of\nLp(a), quintile distribution of age was used as a categori-\ncal variable. Detailed descriptive statistics and measures of\nassociation were computed initially using unweighted\ndata. Kendall's nonparametric rank correlation was used\nto assess the association of Lp(a) with other variables and\ncompared to Pearson correlation [22]. To determine the\ninfluence of gender and ethnicity on the distribution of\nLp(a), analysis of covariance was used to compute\nadjusted means for subjects within sex and ethnic catego-\nries, and to assess the statistical significance of differences\nof means among groups. Stepwise logistic multiple regres-\nsion analysis was used to develop models for predicting\nLp(a) >30 mg/dL for each sex, and ethnic group [22].\nOnly variables with pre-specified hypotheses and with sta-\ntistically significant univariate correlation coefficients\nwere eligible to enter the regression models. Following\nthese preliminary analyses, preplanned hypotheses and\nmajor findings of the unweighted analyses were con-\nfirmed using techniques that incorporated sampling\nweights and design features of the survey [14]. Population\nestimates for mean Lp(a) and percentiles and statistical\ntests of weighted proportions were produced using Statis-\ntical Analysis System (SAS) callable SUDAAN [23]. Chi-\nSquare analysis was used for the comparisons of distribu-\ntions of Lp(a) categorized into 10 mg/dL strata between\nsex, ethnicity and age groups. Associations of Lp(a) with\nother variables were confirmed in final weighted analysis,\nusing PROC LOGIST procedure in SUDAAN [23] with\nalpha set at <0.05. Since substantial proportions of white\nand Mexican American children had undetectable Lp(a),\nlog or other transformations could not produce an\napproximately normal distribution of Lp(a) for paramet-\nric analyses. Therefore analytic results presented are pri-\nmarily those using Lp(a) > 30 mg/dL as a categorized\nvariable.\nTable 1: Selected percentiles of lipoprotein(a) distributions and prevalence of concentrations > 30 mg/dL in children and young adults\nEthnic group Age (yrs) Lipoprotein(a) (mg/dL) N\nPercentile Percent > 30 (mg/dL)\nNonhispanic white\nNonhispanic black\nMexican American\n* Indicates unadjusted statistically significant difference in levels of Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl between black and white children, and between black and\nMexican American children in the same age group.

Neither\nHDL cholesterol nor casual triglyceride concentration was\nsignificantly associated with Lp(a) after controlling for\nmultiple variables. Total serum cholesterol was signifi-\ncantly associated with Lp(a) after controlling for multiple\nvariables in all three ethnic groups as expected.\nDiscussion\nThe most important findings of this study are that ethnic-\nity significantly associated with Lp(a), and that parental\nhistory of heart attack significantly associated with Lp(a)\nlevels >= 30 mg/dl. While non-hispanic black children\nhad significantly higher total Lp(a) level, compared to\nwhite and Mexican American children, no consistent asso-\nciations of age or gender with Lp(a) were found in\nwas not significantly associated with high Lp(a) after con-\ntrolling for age and sex in the entire group. Higher levels\nof Lp(a) >30 mg/dl was evident in metropolitan com-\npared to non-metropolitan non-hispanic black children.\nMechanisms\nLp(a) is a circulating particle that consists of phospholip-\nids, cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B-100 (i.e. a LDL par-\nticle), with apolipoprotein(a) attached to the latter at a\nsingle point [5,24]. Like LDL, Lp(a) when oxidized may\npromote atherosclerosis by promoting formation of foam\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ncells which release growth factors. Lp(a) acquires a patho-\ngenic profile on entering the arterial cell wall as a result of\nthe influence of factors operating in the inflammatory\nenvironment of the atheromatous vessel, such as proteo-\nlytic enzymes of the metalloproteinase family [25]. About\n80% of the amino acids in apo(a) are homologous with\nthose of plasminogen, suggesting a possibly thrombolytic\neffect which might both promote atherosclerosis and trig-\nger acute thrombotic occlusions [1,3,26].\nWhereas levels of Lp(a) above 30 mg/dL was shown to\nincrease risk of coronary heart disease in European sam-\nples [3,24], no such association has been found in black\npopulations, in whom the concentration is twice that in\nEuropeans [24,27]. Study of serum concentrations of this\nparticle in children is especially important since, unlike\nLDL, its concentration is postulated to be remarkably sta-\nble throughout the life of an individual. Thus, identifica-\ntion of persons at increased risk early in life would permit\nmore effective intervention to lower levels of modifiable\nrisk factors such as LDL cholesterol.\nEnvironment, Ethnicity, Age and Gender\nA number of studies of adults have compared Lp(a) levels\nin Whites and Blacks, and have uniformly reported two-\nfold higher levels in Blacks [4,5,11]. In Texas, Mexican\nAmerican adults were found to have lower Lp(a) than\nwhites. Conversely, Kambor et al observed higher mean\nand median plasma Lp(a) concentrations in hispanic men\nthan white men in Colorado with lesser difference seen in\nwomen[28]. Although the explanations for these findings\nremain unclear, environmental factors, genetic admixture\n[29] or a combination of both should be considered.\nNo previous reports of studies comparing Lp(a) in whites\nand blacks and Mexican American children in the same\nstudy were found prior to NHANES-III. In fact, few com-\nparisons of plasma Lp(a) concentrations were found for\nhispanic children or other children below age 8 years prior\nto NHANES-III [30,31]. The present findings extend the\npublished report by examining children in greater detail\nand examining the relationship of birth weight and family\nhistory of cardiovascular disease with Lp(a) in children.\nPerhaps one of the most noteworthy observation from\nthis study is the significantly higher levels of Lp(a) >30\nmg/dl in black, compared to white and Mexican American\nchildren (Table 1). Ethnic-related differences in Lp(a)\nsimilar to those in adults were found in children as young\nas 4\u00ad5 years of age, supporting the presence of higher lev-\nels of Lp(a) in black children compared to other ethnic\ngroups (Table 1). This observation is consistent with find-\nings of the Bogalusa Heart Study of white and black chil-\ndren, and the NHLBI Growth and Health Study of girls\nthat showed higher Lp(a) levels in black than white chil-\ndren [30,32]. Findings in Mexican Americans in the\nNHANES-III study is analogous to reports from the Colo-\nrado study showing a greater percent of Hispanics than\nThe explanation for ethnic-related differences in levels of\nLp(a) in the US remains unclear. Other than total choles-\nterol, no single environmental or biological variable con-\nsistently associated with levels of Lp(a) in the NHANES-III\nsample. While levels of Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl received signifi-\ncant contributions from BMI and residence in metro com-\npared to non-metro in black children, only higher birth\nweight significantly contributed to levels of Lp(a) in Mex-\nican American children. Contrary to a previous report of\nassociation of low birth weight with elevated Lp(a) con-\ncentration in black children, [6] we found no consistent\nassociation of low birth weight with levels of Lp(a) in\nblack or white children in the present study (Table 4).\nAt the genetic level, heritability estimates were reportedly\nhigher for Whites than for Blacks [33,34] despite the dis-\nproportionately higher levels of Lp(a) in Blacks. This\nobservation raises an important question about the\ngenetic determinants of differential levels of Lp(a) in non-\nhispanic Blacks compared to Whites. A recent study on\ngenetic linkage analysis by Barkley et al found no linkage\nevidence to support the presence of a single but separate\ngene with large effects specifically segregating in non-his-\npanic Blacks that may account for elevated Lp(a) lev-\nels[35] Conversely, high levels of Lp(a) levels have been\nsuggested to be an old African trait that is associated with\nmutations in the coding sequences of apo(a) [36]. Collec-\ntively, these disagreements among studies suggest that\nhigher levels of Lp(a) in non-hispanic Blacks compared to\nother ethnic groups, may result from a complex interac-\ntion of genes with environmental and metabolic factors,\n[37]. Future identification of the presence and nature of\nthis interaction is imperative.\nStudies of adults found an association of higher age and\nfemale gender with higher Lp(a) levels [38]. The Bogalusa\nHeart Study found a small but significant gender differ-\nence and a weak positive correlation with age (p < 0.001)\nno consistent associations of age or gender with Lp(a) in\nNHANES-III below age 20 (Table 3). Despite the levels of\nLp(a) that tended to be highest between age 6 \u00ad 11 years\nin boys, the lack of similar trend in girls, and the absence\nof age-related difference in the levels of Lp(a) in the com-\nbined group, suggests that pre-pubertal or pubertal status\nmay not significantly influence levels of Lp(a) in children.\nAltogether, our observation from the present NHANES-III\nstudy, together with the work of others [30,38] found very\nfew significant associations of Lp(a) with personal, behav-\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nioral, or environmental variables. It therefore appears\nlikely, that multiple factors at the environment and or\ngenetic levels may act together to differentially influence\nlevels of Lp(a) in children and adolescents in the US.\nFamily History\nFew studies of the association of Lp(a) with family history\nhave been reported in children [30,39]. Our observations\nof significant association of parental history of heart\nattack/angina before age 50, with levels of Lp(a) >30 mg/\ndl in NHANES-III (Figure 2) are consistent with results\nfrom the Bogalusa study that found an association of\nparental history of premature heart attack with higher lev-\nels of Lp(a) [30]. However, contrary to Bogalusa study\nshowing an association of Lp(a) with parental history of\nhypercholesterolemia, trends for family history in black\nchildren in NHANES-III were concordant with those in\nwhites, although not attaining statistical significance.\nMore recently, Dirisamer and colleagues provided addi-\ntional support for higher levels of Lp(a) levels in children\nand adolescents from families with premature coronary\nheart disease compared to those without familial coro-\nin the CARDIA study, a non-significant trend toward\nhigher Lp(a) levels in those with a family history of myo-\ncardial infarction was observed in whites, but no associa-\ntion was seen in blacks [33]. Collectively, the association\nof parental history of premature heart attack appears asso-\nciated with levels of Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl, may lend support\nto the theory of genetic underpinning for the higher levels\nof Lp(a) observed in black children.\nIn the NHANES-III study, no association of Lp(a) were\nseen with family history of stroke, hypertension, or\ndiabetes. Similarly, family history of high cholesterol and\ndiabetes were not significantly associated with levels of\nLp(a) >30 mg/dl in the entire sample (Figure 2), except in\nnon-hispanic white children (Table 2). Cross-sectional\nstudies of adults have not consistently shown a relation-\nship of Lp(a) with NIDDM. Conversely, several reports\nindicate an association between IDDM with Lp(a)\n[29,41]. However, NIDDM is thought to have a stronger\ngenetic component in its etiology than IDDM [42].\nDespite the inconsistencies in the literature, there is strong\nevidence to suggest that Lp(a) is a risk factor for vascular\ndisease in diabetics [43]. Further research on clinical and\nsubclinical diabetes and Lp(a) is needed.\nLimitations\nLimitations of the present study include possible bias\nfrom survey non-response, missing values for some varia-\nbles, and confounding by variables not measured. Fortu-\nnately, several special studies of earlier NHANES-III data\nhave indicated little bias due to non-response [44].\nAlthough, adequate reliability has been demonstrated for\nLp(a) measurement [14], the lack of a single, generally\naccepted laboratory method and national standardization\nprogram remains a problem, perhaps explaining in part\nthe inconsistencies among studies [3]. The relatively large\nsample size provided good statistical power and the con-\nservative criteria for statistical significance reduced the\npossibility of chance findings attaining significance\ndespite a large number of tests. Overall, the representa-\ntiveness of the sample and the use of sample weights pro-\nvided wide generalizability of the results to United States\nblack and white and Mexican American children and ado-\nlescents of the same ages.\nIn conclusion, ethnicity significantly associated with lev-\nels of Lp(a). Parental history of heart attack/angina before\nage 50 years associated with levels of Lp(a) > 30 mg/dl in\noffspring. Collectively, different pathological thresholds\nmay have to be established for elevated serum Lp(a) lev-\nels, to be used as a risk marker for coronary heart disease\nin different populations. Future research should include\nlongitudinal studies of Lp(a) in white, black and hispanic\nchildren followed to adulthood. Racial admixture as well\nas environment and behavioral variables associated with\nacculturation and urban residence should be studied,\nespecially in Mexican American and black populations.\nStandardization of methods will facilitate inter-study and\nlongitudinal comparisons.\n"
