A further aim was to investigate how the notion of\nmedical indication was conceptualised.\nMethods: A random sample of GPs, oncologists and pulmonologists (n \u00bc 646) comprised the study group. Respondents\nwere randomised to receive either version of a case presentation; in one version, the patient had smoked and in the\nother version she had never smoked.

In\nthis paper, however, we will argue that it may be neither\nof those two things. We want to point out that our aim is\nnot to discredit this individual physician nor to further\ncomment on that particular case, but rather to focus on\nthe role that physicians' private values may play in fram-\ning and understanding the concept of medical indication\nin a wide variety of clinical settings.\nHealth care is, by necessity, a value-laden enter-\nprise. Like any institution that purports to achieve\nsomething (in this case: improved health), it shows\nalready by this intention that its actions are at least\npartly governed by values. In striving towards\nimproved health for patients, health care thus presup-\nposes that improved health is desirable. This also goes\nfor those working within health care: a physician who\ndoes not value good health above bad health and ben-\nevolence above malevolence would seem badly suited\nfor his/her job.\n1Department of Research and Development, Region Kronoberg,\nKarolinska Institute of Medicine, Stockholm Sweden\n2Stockholm Centre for Healthcare Ethics (CHE), Karolinska Institute,\nLIME Stockholm, Sweden\nCorresponding author:\nJoar Bjo\n\u00a8rk, Karolinska Institute of Medicine, Tomtebodava\nEmail: joar.bjork@ki.se\nClinical Ethics\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\ncet.sagepub.com\nOne common view holds that the most important\nvalues in health care are autonomy, benevolence, non--\nmaleficence and justice.2 Although controversies\nregarding these `four principles' remain, these values\nhave become so accepted that they now form part of\nsome health care systems' official regulation.3 In the\nfollowing, we will refer to these as the `official values'\nof health care.\nAt least two of the above-mentioned values (benevo-\nlence and non-maleficence) are directly relevant to the\nconcept of medical indication. Judging that a procedure\nis medically indicated for a patient is in itself an evalu-\native process, as the physician balances the individual\npatient's health impairment versus the achievable\nhealth improvement and the possible side effects.4\nIf the achievable health improvement is sufficiently\nlarge and the possible side effects sufficiently small,\nthe beneficence and non-maleficence principles would\nindeed support the physician's judgment of a specific\nmedical treatment as `medically indicated'.\nHowever, since physicians are human beings it\ncannot be taken for granted that they all fully share\nthe official values. It is reasonable to expect that some\nof them hold certain private value convictions that may\nbe in conflict with the official values. In the following,\nwe will call such convictions `private values', as\nopposed to `official values' which will be used for\nvalues conforming to the ethical principles mentioned\nabove, regardless of whether these are shared by indi-\nvidual physicians or not.\nEthical problems may result if any physician's pri-\nvate values differ considerably from the official values.\nIf physicians are allowed to act on such private values,\npredictability and transparency may be impaired,\nwhich, in turn, might undermine patients' potential to\nmake informed health care choices. To avoid this, many\nhealth care systems have checks and balances to limit\nthe scope of physicians' fancies. Indeed, health care\nlegislation and ethical codes of conduct are often\nbased upon the official values mentioned above, striving\nto bar influence by physicians' private values in the\nsense we have defined them. In Sweden, there is a\nlong positivist tradition where civil servants such as\nphysicians are assumed to be neutral administrators\nof official guidelines and values.5 This is illustrated,\nfor instance, by the fact that there is no room for con-\nscientious objections in the Swedish healthcare system.\nIdeals and regulations such as these in themselves work\nto prevent physicians acting on the basis of their own\nwhims.\nHowever, there is a body of empirical studies suggest-\ning that despite all checks and balances physicians'\nprivate values do sometimes enter clinical practice impli-\ncitly or `through the back door'. 6 This expression refers\nto a cognitive process described by, among others,\nMolewijk et al.7 who dubbed it `implicit normativity'.\nMolewijk et al.7 describe how private values affect clin-\nical practice by informing physicians' impression of, and\ncommunication regarding, the factual basis of medical\ndecisions. As the physicians' private values are hidden in\nthe presentation of factual aspects of the situation, they\ncan effectually become `invisible' to all parties (including\neven the physicians themselves). The issue has been fur-\nther investigated by Juth and Lynoe.8 who have instead\nused the term `value impregnation' of factual aspects.\nThis term indicates that the factual aspects of a deci-\nsion-making process may be more or less impregnated\nby a physician's private values. Take, for instance,\na physician who is privately in favour of physician-\nassisted suicide (PAS), but works in a setting where\nPAS is not permitted. When faced with a dying patient\nin pain, this physician may \u00ad by route of conscious or\nunconscious value impregnation \u00ad make a factual over-\nestimation of the patient's pain, leading to the adminis-\ntration of possibly lethal doses of pain relief. Conversely,\na physician who does not support PAS may in the same\nsituation underestimate the pain, leading to possibly\ninsufficient doses of pain relief.9\nWhen physicians' private values impregnate factual\naspects of medical decisions, this can lead to several\nproblems. First, it may compromise patients' auton-\nomy.6 Obviously, the more biased the physician's infor-\nmation to the patient is, the harder it will be for the\npatient to reach a decision in the light of her own values\nand wishes.2 (Conflicts with patient autonomy may of\ncourse arise even relative to the `official values', but this\nis beyond the scope of the present study.) Secondly, if\nphysicians' private values implicitly affect the clinical\ndecision-making process, the choice of clinical examin-\nations and treatments offered to the patient will be\ndependent upon these values. This may lead to arbi-\ntrariness, which is clearly in conflict with the so-called\nformal principle of justice (i.e. that relevantly equal\ncases should be treated equally), and by extension\nwith the health care codex in several countries, for\nUnlike physicians' private values, it is commonly\naccepted that the patient's private values should be\naccounted for in the medical decision-making process.11\nAs individuals differ, so patients differ in attitudes to\ntreatment as well as in their preferred levels of infor-\nmation and risk taking. Such attitudes may, in line with\nthe autonomy principle (an official value), legitimately\naffect how and which decisions are ultimately made.\nHowever, it is unclear whether such patient values are\ninternal or external to the concept of medical indica-\ntion. For instance, can a patient's strong desire for a\ntreatment constitute or augment a medical indication\nfor that treatment? There seems to be no consensus on\nthis issue. The Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary\nBjo\nsimply defines medical indication as `a symptom or par-\nticular circumstance that indicates the advisability or\nnecessity of a specific medical treatment or proced-\nure',12 giving no clue as to what these circumstances\nmay be. In clinical practice, physicians sometimes\nspeak of two kinds of indications: medical indications\non the one hand and `non-medical indications',\n`extended indications', `social indications' or `humani-\ntarian indications' on the other hand. Although the\nlatter kind of indications may be invoked in any med-\nical setting, they seem to be most often used in ethically\ncomplex medical situations such as beginning-of-life\nissues, life style questions or issues in palliative care.\nSome examples are abortions, sterilisations,\nCaesarean delivery on maternal request, sedation-ther-\napy on request at the end of life and certain plastic-\nsurgery operations (e.g. culturally motivated hymen\nThe present paper rests on two hypotheses. The first\nis that \u00ad in contrast to perceptions of the physician as\nan impartial administrator of official values \u00ad phys-\nicians' private values do sometimes affect medical deci-\nsion making. The second is that the concept of medical\nindication is unclear and that different physicians may\nmean quite different things when they use the term.14 In\nthe following, we will try to specify how the uses may\ndiffer and what implications these differences may have,\nespecially in regards to value impregnation of medical\nindications associated with priority setting.\nWe have previously conducted an experimental\nstudy among Swedish physicians using a randomised\ncontrolled design. The results indicated that although\nmost physicians stated that patients should not be held\nresponsible for their conditions, a significantly larger\nproportion of physicians were inclined to offer a new\nand expensive treatment to a non-smoking lung-cancer\npatient than to a smoking lung-cancer patient.15 For\nthe present paper, we used the same set of data to inves-\ntigate whether the participating physicians estimate the\nmedical indication for treatment differently depending\nupon the patient's smoking status, which would suggest\nthat the concept of medical indication is open to value-\nimpregnation. Also, we wanted to examine how the\nphysicians accounted for their judgments of medical\nindication, again with a special eye to possible value\nimpregnation of this concept.\nMethods\nThe questionnaires\nRespondents were randomised to receive one of two\nversions of a questionnaire containing a case\ndescription of a female 59-year-old lung-cancer patient.\nThe two versions were identical but for one factor: in\none version, the patient was a current smoker with a 40\npack-year smoking history, whereas in the other ver-\nsion, she had never smoked.15 By using this design,\ninspired by studies by Joshua Knobe,16 we aimed at\ncapturing possible differences in response patterns\nattributable to the patients' smoking status. In the\ncase description, it was stated that the patient had\nincurable, disseminated lung cancer, but that a novel\ntreatment could prolong her life approximately\n10 weeks. However, the treatment was stated to be\nexpensive and not routinely offered. The questionnaires\nthen posed the questions whether or not there was a\nmedical indication to offer the new treatment, and\nwhether the respondents thought that the treatment\nshould be offered (response options to both questions:\nyes/no).\nThe respondents were further asked whether their\nown trust in health care would be affected if this kind\nof treatment was routinely offered (response options:\ndecrease/not change/increase). Those who claimed\nthat their trust would increase or decrease were classi-\nfied as value-influenced, and those who claimed their\ntrust would not be affected were classified as value-\nneutral. The rationale for this dichotomisation was\nthe assumption that those who said their trust would\ndecrease or increase thereby expressed an evaluation of\nthe act in question (i.e. to offer or not offer treatment).\nPhysicians who said their trust would decrease if the\ntreatment were to be offered were thus interpreted to\nclearly oppose the routine offering of this treatment\n(and conversely). The group who, in contrast, reported\ntheir trust would not be changed if the treatment was to\nbe routinely offered were interpreted to find this pro-\nspect neither good nor bad.13\nParticipants\nThe study group in the present analysis included a\nrandom sample of 1200 physicians (mainly oncologists,\npulmonologists and GPs) of which 646 responded,\ngiving a response rate of 53.8%. The random samples\nwere drawn from a commercial database (Cegedim/\nStockholm) and came from all over Sweden. The par-\nbalance was 52% male and 48% female respondents.\nRandomisation and blinding\nThe two versions of the questionnaire were randomly\ndistributed to all participants by paper mail, including\ntwo reminders. The randomisation was executed by\nallotting each participant a list number, giving all even\nnumbers `the smoking patient version' and all odd\nnumbers `the non-smoking patient version'. The ran-\ndomisation procedure resulted in two groups which\nwas similar in all relevant aspects, results which have\nbeen presented elsewhere.15 In the introductory letter,\nthere was no mention of another version of the case\npresentation. Thus, the design of the experiment was\nblinded to the respondents.\nAnalysis\nChi-2 test was used to analyse contingency tables.\nThe results were presented as proportion with 95%\nconfidence interval (CI). Logistic regression analysis\nwas performed in order to study associations between\nthe dichotomous main outcome variable and the inde-\npendent variables that might influence the outcome.\nWe also included interactions in the logistic model to\ntest for non-additivity of the independent variables.\nA p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nThe data were registered and analysed using the Epi-\ninfo software 6.04 as well as SAS\u00d5 System 9.4, SAS\nInstitute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.\nWhen analysing the comments, we used a\nmodified version of content analysis17 focusing on the\nrespondents' stated reasons in support of their judg-\nment of medical indication. We also tried to divide\nthe reasons into factually based reasons and value-\nbased reasons.\nEthics\nAll respondents were informed about the study's pur-\npose and voluntary nature in a simple, comprehensible\nlanguage. However, the Joshua Knobe-inspired method\nwhich effectively conceals the specific research aim from\nthe respondents entails an ethical dilemma common to\nall partly deceptive research methods. In brief, the\ndilemma is that the respondents are asked to participate\nunder auspices that do not exactly match the real pur-\npose of the study.\nThe study protocol was approved by the Stockholm\nResults\nWhen comparing the physicians who received the\nnon-smoking patient version of the questionnaire and\nthe physicians who received the smoking patient\nversion, the first group tended to be more inclined to\noffer the proposed treatment than the second group\n(57.3% vs. 52%). This difference, however, was not\nIn order to further analyse the data, we divided\nthe physicians into the above-mentioned categories\nof value-influenced and value-neutral physicians.\nUnder this definition, 65% (n \u00bc 393) were classified as\n`value-neutral' and the remaining 35% (n \u00bc 207) were\nclassified as `value-influenced'. There was no statistical\ndifference in the relative proportions of the value-neutral\nto the value-influenced physicians among those who\nhad received the smoking and non-smoking patient\nversion of the questionnaire.\nAmong the value-influenced physicians, 67% (95%\nCI: 58\u00ad76) stated that there was a medical indication\nfor treating the non-smoking lung-cancer patient, while\ntreating the smoking patient (Chi-2 \u00bc 5.8, df \u00bc 1;\np \u00bc 0.016). Among value-neutral physicians, the corres-\nponding proportions were 53% in both groups\nWe also used the dichotomy of value-influenced and\nvalue-neutral to compare the two groups' inclinations\nto offer treatment. This analysis showed that 78%\nTable 1.

Please see Table 2.\nDiscussion\nThe empirical results\nIn the whole group of physicians studied, there was no\ndifference in the perception of medical indication for\ntreatment depending upon the patient's smoking\nstatus. However, when the group was divided into\nthose who seemed to hold an evaluative stance in\nregards to the proposed treatment (pro or contra) and\nthose who seemed to be value neutral in regards to the\nproposed treatment, we found a significant difference.\nThe 35% of the physicians who were classified as value-\ninfluenced, unlike their value-neutral counterparts, dis-\ncriminated between the non-smoking and the smoking\npatient in their estimations of medical indication for\ntreatment as well as their inclination to offer the treat-\nment. The 65% who were classified as value-neutral, on\nthe contrary, did not discriminate between the smoking\nand non-smoking patient on either account. In this,\nthey acted in accordance with the Swedish official\nvalues, which stress that patients' previous behaviour\nshould not influence access to treatment.\nTable 2.

Numbers in brackets refer to amount of comments. Italicised captions are actual quotes from\ncomments.\nMolewijk et al.7 claim that all physicians' decisions\nare more or less influenced by official as well as private\nvalues. If the distinction between value-influenced and\nvalue-neutral physicians is plausible, it can be argued\nthat at least in this setting the majority of the physicians\nseem not to let private values influence their estimation\nof the medical indication for the proposed treatment\nand their inclination to offer the treatment. Whether\nthis is because they discipline their potential subjectiv-\nity, or whether as a matter of fact they do not hold any\nstrong private values regarding the proposed treatment,\ncannot be assessed in the study. It should also be borne\nin mind that previous studies suggest that the relative\nproportions of value-neutral to value-influenced phys-\nicians might depend upon the level of controversy sur-\nrounding the issue in question.6,18\nSince the smoking patient questionnaire and the\nnon-smoking patient questionnaire differed solely on\nthe point of the patient's smoking status, which in\nturn was framed as being of no prognostic relevance,\nthe results indicate that the value-influenced physicians\nincorporate medically irrelevant aspects in their assess-\nment of medical indication for treatment. In this par-\nticular study, such aspects would be biases against\nsmoking patients. We suggest that these physicians'\nassessment of the factual aspects of medical indication\ncould be value-impregnated. As nearly all participating\nphysicians stated that patients' responsibility should\nnot count when deciding whether or not the patient\nshould be offered a new and expensive treatment, it\nmay be that some physicians' private values were tacitly\nand unconsciously brought in `through the back-door'.6\nWe suggest that the back door metaphor might be\ninterpreted as private values impregnating the estima-\ntions of factual aspects of `medical indication'.\nThe impregnation procedure might be unconscious and\ninvisible both for the participants themselves and others\nconcerned. In this way, the physicians are seemingly not\nacting against the official values, but our applied experi-\nmental design makes it possible to reveal the procedure\nand the concealed agenda behind it.\nQualitative and philosophical analysis of\nmedical indication\nThe empirical results provide some clues on how to\nanalyse the concept of medical indication. As noted in\nthe introduction, different people can mean different\nthings when they say there is a medical indication for\ntreatment. We propose that this is due to two different\nbut related conceptual unclarities: firstly, the unclarity\nregarding the concept of medical indication itself, and\nsecondly the unclarity regarding the conceptual relation\nbetween finding a medical indication for treatment and\nactually offering this treatment.\nAt its analytical core,19 the concept of `medical indi-\ncation' for a treatment seems to presuppose or establish\nonly that there is evidence to show that the treatment is\neffective and reasonably safe. This is supported by the\nlexical Merriam-Webster definition of medical indica-\ntion, which states that a treatment is medically indicated\nwhen advisable or necessary. Thus, it is reasonable to\nexpect that when physicians claim a treatment is medic-\nally indicated, they mean at least that medical evidence\nbacks its usage. Indeed, the comments in our data\nshowed many physicians explaining their judgment of\nmedical indication along these lines, e.g. `if there is med-\nical evidence for treatment, there is a medical indication'.\nAlthough consistent with the analytical core, many\nother comments showed that many respondents also\nincluded non-medical/extended considerations into the\nnotion of medical indication itself, e.g. `medically indi-\ncated so she can live past her grandchild's birthday'.\nThus, it seems that whereas some physicians consider\nthe above-mentioned reference to evidence of effect as a\nsufficient and necessary reason for judging that there is\na medical indication for treatment, others see reference\nto evidence of effect as insufficient for medical indi-\ncation. It was not clear from our data whether these\nphysicians also consider it unnecessary. However, the\nabsence of comments implying that the treatment was\neffective and reasonably safe, but still not medically\nindicated, seems to speak against this. All in all, the\ncomments supported the hypothesis that there is great\nambiguity regarding the interpretation of `medical indi-\ncation', and that some physicians have a much broader\nview of the concept.\nThe second conceptual unclarity concerns the rela-\ntionship between medical indication and the physician's\ninclination to treat. Two of this paper's three authors\nare physicians, and our clinical experience is that when\nphysicians speak of something being medically indi-\ncated, they are doing more than making a factual\nclaim. This point can be analysed by reference to the\nconcept of `conversational implicature' from the field of\nlanguage philosophy.\nThe conversational implicature of a statement is\nwhat the statement could be taken to mean, when the\nfull context of the situation is accounted for.20 Often,\nthis amounts to much more than what is literally being\nsaid. If, for instance, I ask you if I can come around this\nafternoon and you answer `I will be at home', I may be\njustified in thinking you did not merely offer me infor-\nmation about where you will be this afternoon, but\nrather that we have made a date of sorts. In much the\nsame way, a physician saying `there is a medical indi-\ncation for treatment' will often be interpreted, by con-\nversational implicature, as meaning `treatment should\nbe offered' or, at least, `there is a reason to offer treat-\nment'. However, although related, these propositions\nBjo\nare not necessarily synonymic or extensionally equiva-\nlent. Conceptually, the correlation between what a\nphysician means when s/he claims there is a medical\nindication to offer treatment and that s/he is inclined\nto offer treatment can be illustrated thus:\nIndeed, the results of this study can be interpreted as\nshowing support among physicians for all four views\ndescribed above. Analysis of the comments gave further\ncorroboration of this hypothesis. Returning again to\nthose physicians who seem to equate medical indication\nwith what we called the concept's minimal interpret-\nation (reference to efficacy and safety), most displayed\na correspondence between their judgment of the treat-\nment's efficacy and their judgment of whether treatment\nshould be given. Thus, most of those who saw the treat-\nment as efficient were inclined to offer treatment, and\nmost who saw treatment as ineffective were disinclined\nto offer treatment. We propose that at least some of\nthese efficacy-determined physicians adhere to position\n1 above, making a strong link between medical indica-\ntion and offering treatment.\nIf the existence of position 1 physicians was only\nindirectly suggested by the results, there were very\nmany comments that clearly expressed support for pos-\nitions 2 or 4 (possibly also 3). In regards to the first\nunclarity mentioned above, these physicians seem to let\nhumanitarian considerations remain external to the\nunderstanding of medical indication proper, but still\ninfluence the choice to offer treatment. One example\nof many such comments was: `not medically indicated\nbut we have to show empathy'.\nThe results also indicated that some physicians who\njudged there was a medical indication for treatment\nnevertheless opted not to offer treatment. In the scheme\nabove, that would put them in position 4. All comments\nfrom that group regarding why they would not offer\ntreatment concerned cost efficacy: `prioritizations are\nnecessary\"; \"resources should be put to better use'.\nObviously, positions 2 and 3 are `including' in the\nsense that they lead to more patients being offered treat-\nment than only those with a firm medical indication\n(under all interpretations of that concept). In contrast,\nposition 4 is \"excluding\" as opposing reasons can sub-\ntract from the medical indication to lead to a situation\nwhere treatment is not offered despite there being a med-\nical indication. As seen in the comments, the reasons for\nnot giving the treatment may be prioritisation consider-\nations in a situation of economy shortage.\nSumming up so far, we have described two concep-\ntually different ways by which physicians include other\naspects than the purely medical ones (i.e. efficacy,\nsafety, and evidence) in treatment decisions. The first\nway is to expand the notion of medical indication to\nencompass for instance humanitarian issues. The\nsecond way is to keep the notion of medical indication\nfree from such issues, but base treatment decisions on a\nrange of indications.\nWe would like to point out that both of these prac-\ntices may be in conflict with established systems for\nhealth care prioritisation. In Sweden, for instance, the\nhealth care law stipulates that all priority setting deci-\nsions should conform to the principles of human dignity,\nneeds and solidarity and cost efficacy.3 As can be seen,\nthere is no officially sanctioned principle that regulates\npriority for patients with `non-medical' indications. In\ntheory, it could be argued that extended/humanitarian\naspects fall under the needs principle above, but this is\nnot uncontested.10 Thus, under the current Swedish\nhealth law, humanitarian aspects have an unclear stand-\ning in priority setting situations, and any physician who\nfrequently treats patients on a humanitarian indication\nmay by opportunity cost decrease health access for\npatients managed by other physicians who do not base\ntheir treatment on this principle.13 Thus, pending a\nphilosophically sound work-up of the place of humani-\ntarian indications within the hierarchy of prioritisation,\nit is probably wise to use this principle with moderation.\nSome apparent contradictions among the respond-\nents' comments also merit mention. For instance, there\nwas great variance in the responses to issues of prog-\nnosis and expected survival time. Many physicians who\nfound a medical indication for treatment pointed out\nthat the patient `seemed healthy' and might live longer\nthan the expected survival time on the proposed treat-\nment. On the other hand, physicians who did not find a\nmedical indication pointed out she `seemed very ill' and\nmight live shorter. In fact, the text in the vignette pro-\nvided very little clues to how `healthy' she was, other\nthan the fact that without treatment she would likely\ndie within three weeks. As for the survival on treatment,\ndeviations from the mean are of course possible in both\ndirections. It is also an open question what constitutes\n`sufficient' time to merit treatment. (However, one\nrespondent actually provided a clear answer to this,\ncommenting: `one month is clinically significant time'.)\nThese findings give rise to the question: did the phys-\nician start with an inclination to treat and adjust his/her\njudgment of expected time accordingly, or did the judg-\nment of time provide basis for the inclination to treat?\nAs our results cannot answer this question, we do not\nclaim that these response patterns prove that phys-\nicians' value impregnate their perceptions of survival\ntime. But the finding that some physicians used the\npatient's smoking status as basis for the medical indi-\ncation indicates that there is a risk of value impregna-\ntion, and the judgment of expected survival time is a\njudgment that may easily be impregnated.\nOn the same note, we found it interesting that some\nrespondents who denied there being a medical indica-\ntion for treatment claimed there was insufficient evi-\ndence for treatment. In fact, the questionnaire clearly\nstated that the proposed treatment had been thor-\noughly studied. Obviously, this is an area where value\nimpregnation can have far-reaching implications. To\nthe critical-minded, it is almost always possible to\nclaim there is insufficient evidence: most bodies of evi-\ndence contain contradictions and controversies. Thus,\nwhenever a physician does not want to offer treatment,\ns/he can offer lack of evidence or `insufficient' expected\nsurvival time as reasons for not offering treatment.\nImplications of the study\nIf a physician's anti-smoker bias determines patients'\naccess to treatment by affecting how the physician\nestimates a patients' medical indications for treatment\n\u00ad as this study has indicated \u00ad this is bad news for\nindividual patients as well as for justice in health\ncare priority setting. It is bad news because whether\nor not such a patient will receive treatment will\ndepend on the private values of the decision-making\nphysician. In other words, it becomes arbitrary whether\nor not such a patient will be offered the treatment.\nMatters are further complicated by the fact that\nsuch value-impregnation may be partly unconscious.\nIn a recent study of decision-making capacity evalu-\nations in Switzerland, Hermann et al.6 found that a\nquarter of the studied physicians, when asked openly,\nstated that their own values influenced their evalu-\nations, while equally many claimed that their own\nvalues had no effect at all. One way to raise awareness\nof this potential problem could be for clinicians to rou-\ntinely question and discuss underlying evaluative forces\nin clinical decision making. This is probably most\nimportant when the issue at stake is controversial or\nvalue-laden, as when involving smoking patients.\nFurther empirical studies are needed to show how\nsuch awareness-raising activities may be arranged in\nthe clinical setting.\nAs indicated by our discussion above, there seems to\nbe no agreement among physicians as to what is meant\nby `medical indication'. This ambiguity increases the risk\nof value-impregnation, and we therefore propose\nthat the medical community should be more careful\nwhen using this concept. While there is no way to\nensure a terminology free from value-impregnation, the\nambiguity can be partly avoided if physicians reserve the\nmoniker `medical indication for treatment' for what we\nhave called its analytical core or minimal interpretation\n(the claim that evidence shows the treatment is effective\nand safe enough), and call other indications (social,\nhumanitarian etc.) by another name. Furthermore, we\nrecommend that physicians reflect about how and when\ntheir own private values influence decision-making\nexplicitly or implicitly, for instance through value\nimpregnation of supposedly `hard' facts. The British\nethicist Martyn Pickersgill21 writes of `the essential\nentanglement of the moral and the factual' and as we\ndo not see any way to permanently disentangle the fac-\ntual from the moral, we hope instead that this paper may\nbe a starting-point for a discussion about that very\nentanglement.\nAnother practical implication of this study is\nthe following: if there is disagreement between phys-\nicians (or physicians and patients) in a decision-\nmaking situation, it may be helpful to first examine\nwhether the disagreement is based on the judgment of\nfactual aspects and, if so, also examine whether this\ndifference may depend on possible value-\nimpregnations.\nBjo\nStrengths and weaknesses\nThe obvious strength of this study is its randomised,\ncontrolled design. This method yields robust data and\nin this setting allowed us to examine the effect played by\nthe patient's smoking status on the estimation of med-\nical indication. As the randomisation process resulted\nin comparable groups regarding relevant aspects, the\ndesign minimised the risk of bias.\nHowever, due to the relatively low response rate, we\ncannot know to what degree the results are generalisable\nat least regarding the proportions of those who are\nvalue-neutral and value-influenced. Comments made\nby the respondents indicate that some physicians found\nthe case description over simplified, which could be a\nreason for the low response rate.\nThe respondents' answering patterns and com-\nments raised a wealth of philosophical questions, pri\nmarily concerning the notion of `medical indication'.\nTherefore, we set out to investigate this topic in a\nlong discussion section. By necessity in a mixed empir-\nical/philosophical paper such as this, the philosophical\nanalysis to some extent goes `beyond' what can be\nstrictly inferred from the empirical material. We thus\nwish to point out that the final interpretative result is\nour estimation of a best guess, and that we welcome\nalternative interpretations to the matter.\nIn this paper, the group labelled `value-influenced\nphysicians' were those whose trust in health care would\nbe altered \u00ad for better or worse \u00ad if the proposed therapy\nwas to become routinely used. The underlying assumption\nis that such an alteration of trust implies that the respond-\nents feel that important health care values are truly at\nstake in this issue, in a way that the value-neutral phys-\nicians do not. Thus, it is only in regards to the adoption of\nthe proposed treatment as routine that value-neutral\nphysicians are indicated to be value-neutral. Outside\nof that, they may very well harbour for instance strong\nliberal and humanitarian values that are in accordance\nwith the official values. What is of concern here is, then,\na very limited interpretation of the term `value-neutral'.\nThis interpretation is furthermore our own and its validity\nneeds to be scrutinised further.\nFinally, we wish to point out that in the qualitative\nanalysis, the counting of comments is not intended to\ngive an estimation of the relative frequency of certain\nopinions in the entire set of data. As only a minority of\nrespondents commented on their responses, the com-\nments can only give clues on how to interpret the\nrationales for understanding medical indication in the\nstudied group.\nConclusion\nThis study indicates that approximately a third of the\nstudied physicians let their private values influence the\njudgement of whether or not to offer treatment to a\nsmoking lung-cancer patient, and their estimation of\nthe medical indication for such treatment. In contrast,\nthe majority of the studied physicians either held no bias\nagainst smokers, or were able to keep such private values\nout of the medical decision-making process, and hence\nmade more fair decisions \u00ad or at least decisions that were\nin accordance with official Swedish health care norms.\nOur analysis of the concept of medical indication\nhighlights three problems with this concept. First,\nthat although physicians and patients may not realise\nthis, stating that a treatment is `medically indicated' is\nby definition an evaluative endeavour. Second, that the\nterm is plagued by conceptual unclarity. Third, that\nphysicians sometimes\u00ad deleteriously \u00ad seem to involve\nprivate values such as bias against smoking in estima-\ntions of medical indication for treatment. To ameliorate\nthese problems, we suggest that physicians engage in\ndiscussions regarding the official and possible private\nvalue base of decisions, and that the term medical indi-\ncation be reserved for statements about evidence of effi-\ncacy and safety of treatment only.\n"
