    "reduced_content": "Normal human serum has been shown' to exhibit cholesterol-binding proper-\nties upon immunoelectrophoresis on agar gel. The evidence clearly supports\nthe concept of a specific type of binding of cholesterol by alpha-beta globulin.\nAccordingly, the name \"transcholesterin\" was proposed for the reactive com-\nponent.\nIn order to evaluate the mechanism of in vitro interaction of cholesterol with\ntranscholesterin, purified components are desirable. Sober and co-workers2\nintroduced the use of O-(diethylaminoethyl) (DEAE)-cellulose chromatography\nfor the fractionation and identification of serum proteins. However, DEAE-\ncellulose chromatography of serum proteins failed to resolve them into com-\nponents homogeneous as judged by the criteria of paper electrophoresis.3 There-\nfore, it has been necessary to combine electrophoretic separation with column\nchromatography in the fractionation of serum proteins. The present com-\nmunication describes the initial findings in an attempt to isolate and char-\nacterize transcholesterin by the combination of zone electrophoresis and the\nmodified chromatographic procedure and also by chemical analysis and im-\nmunodiffusion studies.\nMaterials and Methods.-Human sera: Pooled and individual fresh sera were obtained\nfrom healthy volunteers. The details of the procedure have been described elsewhere'\nfor the following items: (a) agar-gel immunoelectrophoresis, (b) cholesterol solution in\nTeepol \"L\" (an alkyl sulfate detergent), and (c) transcholesterin assay involving immuno-\nelectrophoresis.\nLipoprotein and lipoprotein-free serum (LFF) preparations: Lipoprotein fractions at\naccording to the method of Havel et al.4 When total lipoproteins and LFF were desired,\nthe preparative ultracentrifugation was carried out according to the procedure of Lewis\net al.' at solvent density 1.21. All the fractions were adjusted to original serum volume\nwith isotonic saline. Tests such as paper electrophoresis6 and starch-gel electrophoresis' 8\nwere performed to determine the purity of the lipoproteins and LFF samples. Further\ncharacterizations of these samples were by the Ouchterlony double-diffusion technique.9\nAntisera against human serum lipoproteins: Antisera against human alpha-1, alpha-2,\nand beta lipoproteins produced separately in rabbits were obtained from Behringwerke,\nA. G., Marburg-Lahn, West Germany.\nTotal cholesterol determination: A modified Liebermann-Burchard procedures using\nthe Bausch and Lomb spectronic 505 spectrophotometer to read the density of the color\nat wavelength 640 mys was adopted for cholesterol quantitation. The reproducibility of\nthe analytical procedure was good with a standard deviation of +5%.\nVertical zone electrophoresis: Buffer preparation was described elsewhere (Fig. 5),1\nexcept that the pH was adjusted to 8.6 instead of 8.1. Potato starch powder (Baker\nanalyzed reagent) suspended in the buffer was slurried into a glass column (2.5 cm in\ndiameter X 60 cm in length) stoppered at the bottom with a rubber stopper and center-\nfilled with a glass tubing which was filled with a glass-wool and Difco agar gel (2% buff-\nered) to serve as a salt bridge. Excess buffer, which resulted after the starch had sedi-\nmented by gravity for 6 hr, was pipetted off. One piece of filter paper disk was put on\nthe top surface of the packed starch column. Serum or serum protein preparation dis-\nsolved in the buffer was applied onto the starch column above the paper disk. Then\nstarch powder was added to the liquid sample, with stirring, to adsorb the sample com-\npletely. Another piece of filter paper disk was layered on the starch medium containing\nthe sample. More starch slurry was added so that the sample compartment was at least\n10 cm below the additional starch medium. A layer of buffered agar gel which served\nas a reservoir for buffer covered the top surface. Electrophoretic technique and collec-\ntion of fractions were described in an earlier communication.' Identification of serum\nprotein fractions was performed by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips as described\nby Kohn\" but with Hirschfeld'2 electrode buffer.\nDEAE chromatography: DEAE-cellulose obtained from Carl Schleicher and Schuell\nraphy by the method of Peterson and Sober.'3 A flow rate of 3.0 ml/min was maintained,\nand constant aliquots per tube were collected in the GME fraction collector. Serum\nsample, adjusted to original buffer condition, was passed through a DEAE column of the\nsame buffer. The column was eluted with distilled water until the effluent absorbance at\nwith a linear gradient elution14 of 1 M NaCl in a 0.05 M buffer. Different sets of pH\nand buffer were used in the separate experiments. The fractions were combined accord-\ning to their respective peaks, lyophilized to small volumes, and dialyzed against distilled\nwater for 4 hr and finally overnight in 0.154 M NaCl solution. These fractions were as-\nsayed for transcholesterin activity and serum proteins identified on cellulose acetate\nelectrophoresis.\nResults.-DEAE column chromatography of a whole human serum at pH 4.75:\nFigure 1 represents a chromatographic elution pattern of 20 ml of human serum\n(approximately 1.4 gm of protein) at pH 4.75. The transcholesterin activity\nis spread out across a wide section of the chromatogram. The last fraction\neluted by 2 M NaCl contained only albumin and was negative in the trans-\ncholesterin test. All the other fractions, which have in them alpha-1 and\nalpha-2 globulins, exhibited positive transcholesterin activity. Even though\nthe chromatographic procedure yields more than nine distinct peaks, the sep-\naration of serum proteins in terms of their electrophoretic identities on cellulose\nacetate was not clear-cut.\nDEAE column chromatography at pH 8.20 of lipoprotein-free serum or D 1.21\ninfranate: In Figure 2 is shown the effluent diagram obtained with a lipo-\nprotein-free serum chromatographed on the DEAE-cellulose column. A num-\nber of poorly resolved peaks are evident. The transcholesterin activity was\nfound in the fractions containing either alpha-1 or alpha-2 globulin, or both.\nNo transcholesterin activity could be detected in either the isolated gamma globulin\nfractions or the purified albumin fractions. It is quite interesting to note that\nall the transcholesterin activity is distributed over a fairly large NaCl gradient\nVertical zone electrophoresis of whole serum: Figure 3a demonstrates that all\nthe transcholesterin active proteins are found in a broad zone about 14.5 cm\nin length and including a well-defined yellow front band followed by a red\ndiffused zone. The separation patterns of serum proteins for whole serum (Fig.\n3a) were less well defined than for lipoprotein-free serum (Fig. 3c).

Aliquots of 3.6 ml are collected in a GME (Gilson\nMedical Electronics, Middleton, Wis.) fraction collector.\nthe active transcholesterin proteins were found to reside in this broad zone\ncontaining albumin, alpha-1, alpha-2, and possibly beta globulins, the active\nfractions from the zone electrophoresis were rerun on a newly prepared starch\ncolumn and one of the peak fractions (fraction 9) of Fig. 3a was chosen. The\nelectrophoretic run is shown in Figure 3b. Again, all the fractions which con-\ntained alpha globulins gave positive transcholesterin tests except for the one\nfraction of alpha-1 globulin in fraction 7. The positive tests with albumin\nfractions 1 and 2 were probably related to contamination of the albumin of\nwhole serum by alpha-lipoprotein since the albumin of lipoprotein-free serum\nseparated by zone electrophoresis (Fig. 3c) does not give transcholesterin\nactivity.\nAn example of the vertical zone electrophoresis of the LFF is showii in Figure\n3c. Alpha-1 globulin moved as a broad zone of approximately 12 cm between\nalbumin and alpha-2 beta globulins; only two (fractions 4 and 5) of eight alpha-1\nglobulin fractions gave positive transcholesterin activity, whereas all fractions\ncontaining alpha-2 globulins were positive for transcholesterin activity. It\nappears that the transcholesterin active proteins were located in a certain\nfraction of alpha-i globulin and in alpha-2 globulin regions of the electrophoresis.\nDuring the course of the isolation and characterization of transcholesterin-\nactive proteins by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and vertical zone elec-\ntrophoresis, it became necessary to ascertain the identity of the fractionated\nsamples.\nFurther chemical and immunological characterization of serum fractions: Fur-\nther characterizations of the LFF serum and lipoprotein fractions by more\nspecific and sensitive methods such as chemical and immunodiffusion tech-\nniques were carried out.\n(1) Analyses for total serum cholesterol on lipoprotein fractions and D 1.21\ninfranate: The data showed that lipoprotein fraction (D 1.063) LDL contained\n68.2 per cent of total serum cholesterol, which is in good agreement with the\nvalue given by Lindgren and Nichols'5 for lipoproteins obtained in this density\ntained as much as three times the amount of total serum cholesterol as (D 1.100)\nHDL2. Despite the fact that (D 1.210) infranate was shown to contain no\nmeasurable total serum cholesterol, its unique character is interesting in that\nit is capable of binding free cholesterol in the transcholesterin test.\n(2) Transcholesterin test on partially delipidated and nontreated serum frac-\ntions: Partial delipidation of serum fractions were conducted according to\nthe method described by Levy and Fredrickson.16 All nontreated lipoprotein\nfractions, (D 1.210) infranate, and whole serum yielded positive transcholesterin\nwhole serum still exhibited positive transcholesterin activity even after they\nhad been subjected to the delipidation treatment.\nFrom the data presented, a general statement can be made concerning the\nstability of transcholesterin or transcholesterins. The transcholesterin activity\nin all lipoprotein fractions is destroyed after partial delipidation. In contrast,\nthe activity in (D 1.210) infranate is stable after it is subjected to the same\ntreatment.\n(3) Serological specificity of serum fractions with rabbit antisera in immuno-\ndiffusion: The results of the characterization of whole serum, lipoprotein\nfractions, and density 1.210 infranate by immunodiffusion technique of Ouch-\nterlony9 with or without prior partial delipidation treatment are presented\nin Table 1. (D 1.210) HDL3 reacted only with anti-alpha-1 lipoprotein to form\na reaction line. Whole human serum was used as control and reacted with all\nthree specific antisera. When the various serum fractions were subjected to\nTABLE 1.

(D 1.210) infranate was negative to each of the three specific\nantisera by the immunodiffusion test either before or after it was similarly\ntreated, an indication that it did not contain lipoproteins of the nature dis-\ncussed here. The (D 1.210) infranate preparations were thus generally free\nof alpha-1, alpha-2, and beta lipoproteins as determined by the Ouchterlony9\ndouble-diffusion procedure with commercial rabbit antisera.\nDiscussion.-Fractionation of the transcholesterin from lipoprotein-free\nserum by vertical zone electrophoresis on starch medium showed that one of the\nseveral separated alpha-i globulins and all of the alpha-2 globulins yielded\npositive transcholesterin activity. Similar zone electrophoresis of the whole\nserum gave poorer resolution of the protein components. It seems that the\nlipoproteins present in the whole serum were smearing the electrophoretic\npattern.\nSober and co-workers2 applied DEAE-cellulose chromatography to the sep-\naration of serum proteins. They found that lipoproteins were eluted in frac-\nhave described the use of this technique for serum protein separation with\nminor modifications and have produced similar results. There has been an\nimportant need for suitable elution buffers at some pH values to reduce or in-\ncrease the number of charges on the protein or exchanger. In the present study,\ntwo modified elution buffers (pH 8.2 and 4.75) used in developing the DEAE-\ncellulose chromatogram of serum proteins have been described.\nThe demonstration of transcholesterin activity in the several peak fractions\nof the DEAE-cellulose chromatograms containing alpha globulins suggests\nthat this cholesterol-binding protein may actually comprise a system of several\nproteins rather than a single oiie. Hence, it is desirable to investigate further\nthis class of alpha globulins exhibiting transcholesterin activity by immuno-\nlogical and by biological assay. For these purposes, adequate amounts of\nhomogeneous purified materials must be obtained. Additional procedures are\nnow under study in our laboratory.\nAlthough the mechanism of in vitro interaction of free cholesterol with trails-\ncholesterin is not fully established, some experiments involving the technique\nof Avigan'9 to measure the relative uptake of C'4-cholesterol by serum frac-\ntions from radioactive cholesterol-coated celite 545 have produced evidence\n(which will be reported later) that the transcholesterin-positive protein or pro-\nteins can bind cholesterol without the use of the detergent Teepol \"L\". How-\never, in an earlier communication,' the specificity of the precipitinlike reaction\nof transcholesterin was found to be limited to cholesterol and dihydrocholesterol\ndissolved in Teepol \"L\" solution. Close homologues of cholesterol such as\ndesmosterol, zymosterol, and lanosterol dissolved in Teepol \"L\" have since\nbeen tested; they were unreactive. The evidence supports the idea that Tee-\npol \"L\" serves only as a vehicle for cholesterol. The specific reaction would be\ndependent in part on the conformation of the protein, while the primary re-\nPROC. N. A. S.\nquirement would be contributed by the steric configuration of the cholesterol\nmolecule.\nSummary.-The studies have presented evidence that the protein com-\nponent(s) of lipoprotein-free serum which reacts with cholesterol in immuno-\nelectrophoresis (termed transcholesterin) resides in the alpha globulins. It is\napparently not a lipoprotein.\nThe albumin, alpha, and beta globulins were resolved into a number of sub-\nfractions of DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, but by this procedure\nwere not completely separated from each other. Upon zone electrophoretic\nseparation the lipoprotein-free serum yielded positive transcholesterin activity\nin one of the alpha-1 and all of the alpha-2 globulin regions. The electrophoretic\npatterns of whole serum were less distinct with considerable cross-contamination\nby lipids.\nFurther characterizations of the lipoproteins, the (D 1.210) infranate, and\nthe LFF fractions were performed through Ouchterlony immunodiffusion tech-\nnique and through chemical analyses for total serum cholesterol. The frac-\ntions of LFF with transcholesterin activity did not react with antilipoprotein\nsera.\nThe fact that transcholesterin activity is found in different eluted fractions\nof alpha-i and alpha-2 globulins suggests that it may constitute a system of\nproteins actively combining with cholesterol.\n* This work was supported by USPHS grant HE-06378, Center for Research in Diseases o\nthe Heart, Circulation, and Related Disorders.\n2 Sober, H.
