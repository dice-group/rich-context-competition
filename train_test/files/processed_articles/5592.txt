The need for effective PHC\ndelivery complemented by a sustainable and competent sup-\nply of HRH is more heavily pronounced in the Eastern\nMediterranean Region (EMR). In fact, the EMR ranked sec-\nond to last in HRH densities, despite the established associa-\ntion between nurse and physician densities and better life\nexpectancy with reduced overall mortality rates.9\nPHC Context in the State of Qatar\nSupporting the growth of a sustainable PHC system along\nwith required human resources is of particular concern to the\nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.10,11 Qatar is one\n1Mohammed Bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences,\nCollege of Medicine, Dubai, United Arab Emirates\n2American University of Beirut, Faculty of Health Sciences, Beirut, Lebanon\n3Ministry of Public Health, Doha, Qatar\n4American University of Beirut, Lebanon\nCorresponding Author:\nMohamad Alameddine, College of Medicine, Mohammed Bin Rashid\nUniversity of Medicine and Health Sciences, Building 14, Dubai Healthcare\nEmail: Mohammed.Alameddine@mbru.ac.ae\nGCC country that has expressed interest in and launched\nvarious initiatives aimed at improving its PHC system's\ncapacity to enhance the health of the public and address\ngrowing population health needs.12\nIn fulfillment of the above, \"Amiri Decree No. 15\" came\nHealth Care Corporation (PHCC) complete administrative\nand financial autonomy to oversee public PHC in Qatar.13\nPHCC runs 21 PHC centers with the majority located in\nTo meet the growing health demands and achieve set\ngoals of having PHC as the principal mode of care, Qatari\nauthorities have acknowledged the need for diligent efforts\nto ensure an adequate supply of qualified primary care HRH,\nwith particular attention to strengthening recruitment and\nretention strategies.15\nObjective and Significance\nThis study aims at soliciting the feedback of PHC stakehold-\ners on the current HRH recruitment and retention strategies\nand the means to strengthening them to enhance HRH avail-\nability and tenure in the PHC sector. To the knowledge of the\nauthors, this study presents the first systematic examination\nof the HRH recruitment and retention strategies in the ever\nexpanding and strategically important PHC sector in the\nstate of Qatar.\nMethodology\nEthical Approval\nThe study obtained ethical approval from the Joint Institutional\nPHCC's Research Committee (Reference No: PHCC/\nBehavioral Studies IRB committee at theAmerican University\nof Beirut (Protocol Number FHS.MA.05).\nStudy Design\nThe study utilized a qualitative study design involving a\nseries of semistructured key informant interviews with PHC\nstakeholders in the state of Qatar.\nStudy Tool\nA semistructured interview schedule, consisting of 13 open-\nended questions, was used for interviewing stakeholders.\nQuestions aimed at collecting information on stakeholders'\nperception of PHC in the country and the existing recruit-\nment and retention strategies. The interview schedule and\nsubsequent interviews encouraged stakeholders to express\nadditional thoughts and to recommend additional stakehold-\ners relevant to the study utilizing snowball sampling. The\noriginal version of the interview schedule was developed in\nEnglish and later translated into Arabic by a professional\ntranslator. Back-translation was carried out to ensure accu-\nrate translation of questions.\nStakeholder Selection and Data Collection\nStakeholders included coordinators, managers, academi-\ncians, researchers, primary care providers, health authorities,\nand parastatal organizations. This diversity in stakeholders\noffered a multifaceted description and understanding of\nHRH recruitment and retention.\nThe authors sought the advice of experienced Qatar-\nresiding medical and public health experts, carried out an\nonline review of PHC providers and authorities, and a review\nof the PHC context and players in Qatar to identify 5 key\nstakeholders who were invited to participate in this study .\nThe initial 5 stakeholders included an academic institution\ndean, a medical college lecturer and educational program\ndirector, a semiprivate organization health center manager, a\nmedical residency program director, and a program coordina-\ntor at a local health authority. Snowball sampling was utilized\nto identify additional key informants. Interviewing continued\nuntil the saturation point was reached. This was determined\nwhen additional interviewed stakeholders were neither pro-\nviding new information nor suggesting any new key infor-\nmants. In total, the study involved 11 key informants.\nStakeholders were invited through a package delivered to\ntheir offices containing an invitation letter and an informed\nconsent. Out of 18 invited stakeholders, 11 accepted to par-\nticipate in the interview. The reasons provided for nonpar-\nticipation were busy schedule and lack of authority to speak\nto research entities.\nThe majority of stakeholders were incumbents of more\nthan 1 influential position, and in many cases at different\ninstitutions in the country. Table 1 offers a summary of the\npositions held by the interviewed stakeholders along with the\ntype of institution they are employed at (the total does not\nequal to the total number of interviewees as reference is\nbeing made to the position rather than individual). Note that\nfor confidentiality purposes, and due to the small size of the\ncountry and small number of institutions, the type instead of\nthe name of the institution was included in Table 1. Only one\nof the stakeholders interviewed was of Qatari origin. All\nother stakeholders were expatriates of different nationalities\n(Western and Middle Eastern) working in Qatar. Although\nonly 1 Qatari was included in the study, we believe the\nstudy's findings are representative of the Qatari context,\nbecause expatriates constitute the great majority of the Qatari\nworkforce and are the main working segments affected by\nrecruitment and retention strategies and initiatives.\nOver the course of 2 to 3 weeks after initial contact, stake-\nholders were followed up with 2 additional e-mails and a\nphone call to confirm their reception of the invitation and\ndecision to participate. A favorable decision to participate\nAlameddine et al 3\nwas followed by arranging a time and place that met the\nstakeholder's preferences and ensured their privacy and con-\nfidentiality. Interviews ranged between 30 and 60 minutes in\nduration. Upon receiving consent, interviews were audio-\ntaped for a more detailed and accurate account and analysis\nof information. When stakeholders did not consent to audio-\ntaping, interviews were conducted by 2 members of the\nresearch team; one led the interview while the other was\nengaged in meticulous note taking. All research members\nwere fluent in both Arabic and English to accommodate for\nstakeholders' preferences. Questions were supplemented by\ndetailed probing, catered specifically to stakeholders with an\nacademic and nonacademic background or profession.\nData Analysis\nAudiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim with spe-\ncial attention to accurately translating all Arabic phrases and/\nor answers into English. All interviews underwent extensive\nthematic analysis to identify the main themes generated by\nthe study, the corresponding recruitment and retention rec-\nommendations, and the parties that are targeted by these\nrecommendations.\nThe thematic analysis yielded a comprehensive, well-orga-\nnized document of all responses, relevant quotes, and key rec-\nommendations. The document was further analyzed, and the\nanswers were categorized into key themes and associated sub-\nthemes (Table 2). Two members of the research team, who later\ncompared results, separately reviewed the final document and\nshared professional opinions to focus responses into agreed-\nupon themes, subthemes, and the findings associated with each.\nNote that, unless otherwise stated, each direct quote is\nattributed to one source/stakeholder.\nResults\nThematic analysis unearthed 3 major themes: (1) perception\nand role of PHC in health care delivery, (2) recruitment prac-\ntices, and (3) retention schemes. Each of these themes was\nassociated with a number of subthemes relevant to the objec-\ntives of the study (Table 2). Discussion of each themes and\nsubthemes is presented below.\nPerception and Role of PHC in Health Care\nDelivery\nThis theme sets the context of how PHC settings, personnel,\nand patient care are regarded, approached, and provided in\nQatar. In regard to PHC definition, analysis revealed a vari-\nety of opinions as to what primary care is in the state of\nQatar. A number of stakeholders described PHC by level of\ncare and duration of treatment, as well as the extent of com-\nmunity involvement and participation. It was acknowledged\nas care throughout the cycle of life. Using the words of one\nof the interviewed stakeholders, PHC is defined as follows:\n\"PHC is care from birth to neonates to pediatrics to adolescent\nto adults to senior and geriatrics . . . \" and \"effectively total care\nfor the patient from cradle to grave.\" (Family physician, medical\nlecturer, and program director at a primary health center and\nacademic institution)\nOther stakeholders defined PHC by the range of health care\nprofessionals delivering health care services, with a particular\nTable 1.

In terms of\nrole of the provider, suggestions were made that qualified\nnurses can attend to minor cases, which, aside from yielding\ncost and time-savings, enhances equitable access to care.\nRelated to this subtheme was the definition of PHC care as the\nsystem that has a \"gatekeeper for health services\" (department\nhead and lecturer at a secondary care institution and medical\ncollege). This was deemed by most interviewees as a cost-\neffective and time-efficient system for care delivery.\nThe third subtheme focused on boasting more compre-\nhensive PHC services, for example, mental health services\nand screening, rehabilitation care, and family planning ser-\nvices. Shortcomings in the provision of such services were\nattributed to physicians lacking the time needed to perform a\nfull screening and care procedures, as well as mental health\nillnesses being a cultural taboo. Furthermore, more emphasis\non OBGYN preventive services was recommended. Such\nshortcomings are delineated in the following statement:\nThe only service available is screening for cervical and breast\ncancer. Other services for women . . . osteoporosis . . . obesity or\nwellness and health promotion services are not there. (Lecturer\nand coordinator at a health authority)\nGreater efforts were also recommended to strengthen\nhealth promotion activities targeting children, parents, and\nstudents, as well as improved public acceptance of \"taboo\"\ndiseases such as autism. Overall, more action at the commu-\nnity level was advised with PHC to encompass palliative and\nlong-term care for NCDs.\nRecruitment Practices\nAlthough strategic recruitment measures are currently\nemployed across PHC organizations in Qatar, many opportu-\nnities to strengthen capacities for meeting growing HRH\ndemands were identified by interviewed stakeholders.\nWith respect to existing recruitment strategies, academic\nstakeholders described curricular restructuring in nursing\nand medical programs aiming at boosting future recruitment\nin the PHC sector, for example, holding more clinical prac-\ntices and core rotations in community settings for medical\nand nursing students. Sponsorship of students by health care\norganizations was also recognized as a key approach to\nincreasing the enrollment in specialties that would feed into\nthe PHC system of care. Other recruitment strategies men-\ntioned by the stakeholders included a plethora of benefits to\nattract professionals to the PHC sector, such as generous\nsalaries, tax-free employment, health and dental coverage,\nand generous family benefits.\nPresent impediments. Interviewed stakeholders identified a\nnumber of impediments undermining effective HRH\nrecruitment efforts. Such limitations were classified as\nthose that fall under the control of the PHC sector and those\nthat go beyond that control. With respect to the former, a\nnumber of impediments were identified including having\nno HRH recruitment strategy, inadequate recruitment skills,\npoor job descriptions, poor recruitment practices, and inef-\nfective outsourcing of human resources recruitment ser-\nvices. Of particular concern for the stakeholders were the\nbureaucratic strains that delay or hinder the recruitment\nprocess. The quote below clearly highlights the magnitude\nof this problem:\nAfter I applied, I took almost a year and half to join . . . from the\nbeginning of submitting my CV until I got a final acceptance\nand joined . . . (Health care manager and primary care provider\nat a semiprivate organization)\nHowever, certain limitations go beyond the control of\nthe PHC sector. These include market shortages in HRH,\nspecifically nurses and female physicians; strong competi-\ntion for competent HRH within Qatar and among GCC\nstates; and lack of competent HRH that can speak Arabic.\nAnother issue that emerged relates to fresh graduates, spe-\ncifically Qataris, seeking only managerial positions. The\nfollowing stakeholder's quote documents the intricacies of\nsuch hindrances:\n. . . Graduates want to directly go into director positions even\nbefore gaining experience. (Chief officer at secondary care\ninstitution)\nMeans to boost recruitment. Stakeholders proposed multiple\ncontextualized strategies to boost HRH recruitment (Table\n3). A key recommendation entailed strengthening the degree\nof coordination among academic institutions to better satisfy\nmarket needs. This would entail Qatari universities and other\nacademic institutions to collaborate on planning and imple-\nmenting medical and health care education programs. Such\ncollaboration could help fine-tune the HRH supply to the\nneeds of the country (recommendation for recruitment) and\nensure the offering of proper continuous education programs\nto in-service HRH (recommendation for retention). Further-\nmore, stakeholders suggested enhancing the sponsorship of\nstudents in health and medical majors that could feed into the\nPHC sector.\nAt the level of human resources departments, recommen-\ndations focused on improving the capacity of human\nresources departments both by recruiting additional officers\nand by training existing ones on recruitment techniques.\nOne key suggested strategy to boost recruitment, specifi-\ncally for expatriate HRH, included offering better support for\nrelocating HRH, such as ensuring appropriate accommoda-\ntion and reserving places in educational institutions for chil-\ndren. These recommendations emanate from the difficulties\nexperienced by some HRH regarding matters such as the one\ndescribed in the quote below:\nTable 3.

HRH = human resources for health; PHC = primary health care.\nExpanded definition of certain recommendations:\naUnified definition: Adopt a universal theoretical and working definition for PHC that would help providers set specific roles and differentiate between primary and more advanced levels of care and assist patients to better understand\nthe level of care they need to seek based on the type and extent of their health issue.\nbEnhanced role for HRH: Nurses may assume certain responsibilities currently under the delegation of physicians as one means to improve efficiency.\ncExpanded services: Add services to PHC centers, such as initial mental health diagnosis and care services.\nWhen I first came to Qatar, I went around for schools and I said\nI've got three children, they all just laughed at me and said \"well\nyou'll never get places.\" And that's what happened. It took us 18\nmonths to get all our kids into school. (Health care manager and\nprimary care provider at a semiprivate organization)\nRetention Schemes\nInterviewees shared experiences in regard to existing reten-\ntion schemes and offered advice on how they could be\nstrengthened.\nCurrent schemes.Stakeholders described existing retention\nschemes including a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic\nrewards. Intrinsic rewards suggested by stakeholders\nincluded professional development and continuing medical\neducation (CME) opportunities, promotion and training, and\nconference participation.\nDespite the importance of intrinsic recognition strategies,\nthe majority of retention schemes identified fall under extrin-\nsic rewards. The provision of housing, travel and transporta-\ntion allowances, and bonuses are well-recognized and\nprevalent HRH retention strategies.\nPresent challenges. Stakeholders elaborated on an assortment\nof challenges that jeopardize employee retention in the PHC\nsector. Such challenges include lack of clear job description,\nheavy workloads, skyrocketing cost of living, and lack of a\nstandardized salary scale. Lack of job stability and subopti-\nmal retention strategies were affecting turnover rates, with a\nstakeholder commenting,\n. . . People come and go and come and go. They don't settle\ndown, and . . . when they find a better offer they leave. (Program\ndirector at secondary care institution)\nIn addition, the shortage of intrinsic rewards and the sub-\njectivity of some HRH performance management systems\npose additional strains on the length of HRH employment.\nOne stakeholder reflects on this by stating,\nIntrinsic awards are available . . .yet are not supported by\nadequate budget . . . and programs are not consistent across\ncenters. (Health care manager and primary care provider at\nprimary health care center)\nRecommendations. Interviewed stakeholders offered an assort-\nment of suggestions and recommendations that may lead to\nbetter employee retention (Table 3). Recommendations\nincluded implementing a career ladder that allows for the rec-\nognition and growth of HRH based on their performance; pro-\nviding childcare assistance, maternity and parental leave, and\nretirement plans; and allowing for continuous professional\ndevelopment through participation in national and interna-\ntional conferences. The importance of professional develop-\nment for retention is highlighted in the following quote:\nIf you don't make an effort to make job professionally satisfying,\nthen you're definitely going to have some people say, \"I've been\ndoing this for too long, it's same old thing, and it's just become\nso routine . . . my heart is not in it\" . . . . and then you lose people.\n(Primary care provider, program director, and lecturer at primary\nhealth care center and academic institution)\nIn terms of working conditions, flexible hours and work-\nplace gender equality, as well as improving job security and\nstability, were highly recommended initiatives.\nFurthermore, stakeholders recommended that the man-\nagement of PHC institutions implement initiatives that would\nidentify current and future HRH needs, oversee activities of\nCME committees, and conduct \"exit interviews\" to gather\nfeedback from leaving HRH.\nDiscussion\nQatar has recently established a profound commitment to\nboosting the public health of its people through realizing \"a\ncomprehensive world-class health care system\" with a par-\nticular emphasis on PHC.12,16-18 Successful outcomes of this\ninitiative are already being realized with PHCC receiving\nplatinum-level accreditation from Accreditation Canada\nInternational, among other manifestations.19 Local authori-\nties have identified PHC as the optimal solution and HRH as\nthe core component for improved PHC delivery.17 This study\nhighlighted several existing PHC recruitment and retention\npractices and delineated additional strategic and operational\ninitiatives for a sustainable supply of HRH and continued\nPHC performance development. Analyses of stakeholders'\nresponses revealed that Qatar's PHC sector currently lacks\nsatisfactory mental health, family planning, and overall\nscreening services. These concerns are well founded with\nmental illnesses having a prevalence rate of 20% and\naccounting for 3 out of the 5 factors leading to disability in\nThe need for advanced PHC screening and services is fur-\nther marked as studies reveal that consanguineous marriages\nconstitute half of all marriages among Qataris. The preva-\nlence of marriage between relatives adds to the country's\nneed for qualified HRH stationed at PHC centers to provide\npremarital education on the health implications of marriage\nbetween relatives. In addition, proper dietary and weight\nmonitoring care is available in only 5 of PHCC's health cen-\nters, while services assisting smokers to quit are provided in\nings are underway with ongoing efforts aiming to include\nmental health as a regular PHC service. Yet, such a strategic\nexpansion of services needs to be well supported by an ade-\nquate number of properly trained mental health HRH should\nthe 5-year national mental health strategy be successfully\nOne interim solution to address the mental health needs of\nPHC patients is to train currently employed physicians on\nAlameddine et al 7\ncaring for mental health issues. Such a measure, while neces-\nsary on the short run, is suboptimal taking into consideration\nthe limited role of practitioners in attending to mental health\ncases and their already busy schedule that prevents them\nfrom delivering proper screening services, including mental\nhealth.23 While it is expected that excessive reliance on expa-\ntriate human resources will continue for the next few years,\nit is essential to work on building local training capacity to\nboost local supply of HRH and ensure that service providers\nare culturally savvy.\nOffering HRH employed in the PHC sector an assortment\nof intrinsic and extrinsic rewards would enhance recruitment\nand contribute to prolonged employee tenure.24 The central-\nity of these rewards is underscored in existing national strate-\ngies; nonetheless, they need to be properly operationalized\nby provider organizations, such as PHCC. Such a task is\ndaunting taking into consideration that, to satisfy national\naddition, PHCC reports that only 27% of its workforce is\nQatari.17 Therefore, it is imperative for any successful\nrecruitment and retention strategy to consider that the major-\nity of PHC providers are expatriates. Such strategies need to\ndevote attention to the needs and aspirations of expatriate\nHRH, including offering support with housing, facilitating\nchildren schooling requirements, and streamlining the\nadministrative processes so that the relocation and settlement\nwould be possible within a reasonable time frame.\nOne key reward that was expressed by virtually all public,\nacademic, and parastatal stakeholders was the availability\nand fairness in the selection of candidates to participate in\nCME and professional development activities. Access to\nsuch opportunities is pivotal because they are a prerequisite\nfor job promotion and career advancement, as well as a\nrequirement to maintain licensure with professional colleges,\norders, and syndicates. The outcomes of CME activities may\nalso exceed the organizational level to influence community\nhealth outcomes.25 PHCC, in its national PHC strategy, has\ncommitted to continuously advancing and training its HRH.17\nThe current study has a number of shortcomings that are\nworth mentioning. First, the interviewed stakeholders may\nnot be representative of all PHC employers in the state of\nQatar. Second, the research team could not ascertain whether\nthe identified interviewees who declined the request for\ninterview held views different from those who accepted to be\ninterviewed. Third, it cannot be confirmed whether the inter-\nviewed stakeholders were biased in their responses in fear of\ndisclosure.\nConclusion\nMultiple internal and external factors currently influence\nQatar's sustainable supply of PHC professionals.\nEncouragingly enough, Qatar's PHC strategy recognizes and\ncommits to addressing the majority of the discussed HRH\nconcerns. The study provided guiding mechanisms to assist\nPHC decision makers in translating knowledge by imple-\nmenting recruitment and retention strategies. PHC authori-\nties are advised to approach developments from a\nconsultative, bottom-up approach, with HRH feedback as the\ninitial and main input for improvement. Future investigations\nwould focus on evaluating the impact of implemented strate-\ngies and identifying areas for improvement. Studies on spe-\ncific determinants of HRH retention are also recommended\nfor more targeted efforts.\n"
