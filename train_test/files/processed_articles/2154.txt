The FES shows that the Baby\nBoomers are typically more involved with their\nchildren than with their aging parents; Boomers'\npersonal values, family members' needs, and personal\nrewards shape decisions about support.

But the endurance of the\n ' family ties is exceptional. In 1700,\nthe infant mortality rate was 20%, deadly epi-\ndemics were common, and overall life expectancy\nremained below the age of 40. Dramatic shifts in\nlife expectancy over the past century have precipi-\ntated accompanying changes in family ties.

The longevity of the\n ' relationships to siblings and to aging\nparents is unprecedented. This review article\ndescribes key issues in the  ' long-\nenduring family ties as they enter old age, particu-\nlarly their intergenerational ties.\nA reciprocal interplay between  '\nintergenerational ties and societal changes began\nin early life and continues into late life. The Baby\nBoomers' relationships with their parents shaped\ncultural, educational, and economic experiences\nthroughout their childhood (Fingerman & Dolbin-\nMacNab, 2006). In young adulthood, the Baby\nBoomers encountered remarkably different social\ncircumstances than their parents did, including the\nwomen's movement, the sexual revolution, rising\ndivorce rates, and enhanced educational opportu-\nnities. Societal changes continue to shape their\nfamily ties. Increased use of technologies and a poor\neconomy have led to disparities with their own\ngrown children. Moreover, during the past half cen-\ntury, norms governing intergenerational relations\nhave weakened; as   enter late life, they\nhave limited societal guidance regarding their\nresponsibilities for older parents or for grown chil-\nTwo key features of the  ' intergen-\nerational ties are the focus of this review. First, the\n  increasingly are in positions of provid-\ning care to aging parents, and they do so in the con-\ntext of their original family ties. Throughout history,\nmost humans have had siblings, but the Baby Boom-\ners typically experienced larger sibships than did ear-\nlier or later cohorts over the last century. Moreover,\nthey are the first cohort to enter midlife with so many\nsisters and brothers still alive. The implications of\nthese sibling ties for their relationships with their aging\nparents and future parent care warrant consideration.\nSecond,   often find themselves of\nexchanging support with multiple generations.\nmented relatively few cases where middle-aged\nadults were in a \"sandwich generation\" of simul-\ntaneously providing care for aging parents and\nchildren younger than 15 years (Grundy & Henretta,\nthe Long-Term Care Study of 1994 (when the old-\nest   were aged 48) revealed that only\n9% of female primary caregivers and 6% of male\nprimary caregivers also had children younger than\n15 years. However, today, many  \nare torn between helping young adult children and\naging parents (Attias-Donfut & Wolff, 2000;\nFingerman, Pitzer, et al., 2011). Their aging par-\nents incur chronic illnesses and disability, whereas\ntheir grown children face demands from economic\ndownturns, prolonged education, and a slow transi-\ntion to adulthood (Arnett, 2000). The  \nstep in to provide assistance.\nThese demands from generations above and\nbelow are situated in relationships to romantic\npartners and changing marital dynamics. The Baby\nBoomers experienced greater acceptance of non-\nmarital romantic liaisons, divorce, remarriage, and\ncohabitation than was the case historically. Thus,\nthey often confront complex emotional, legal, or\nfinancial demands from former romantic ties,\ncohabitating partners, and peripheral relatives\n(e.g., former in-laws or stepchildren). We consider\nthe implications of romantic relationships for the\n ' ties to their parents and children as\nthey enter late life.\nThe researchers take two perspectives in\naddressing these issues, they consider: (a) the ways\nin which  ' ties are prototypical of\nfamily relationships in general (e.g., importance of\nintergenerational ties in late life) and (b) unique\nfeatures that shape the  ' family ties\nas a cohort (e.g., increased life expectancy and\nsocial vicissitudes). The point of this article is not\nto provide a definitive review of  '\nparent\u00adchild relations. Rather, the researchers\ndescribe key issues and three major studies of\nBoomers' families to illuminate these issues.\nMultiple Siblings and Parent Care: The Within\nFamily Differences Study\nAs they traverse midlife and begin to enter late\nlife, Baby Boomer siblings typically confront their\nparents' present or future needs for care. One pos-\nsible consequence of the  ' large\nsibships is a high degree of differentiation among\nparent\u00adchild dyads within families in adulthood.\nSome siblings may get along better with parents,\nsome receive more from parents, and some may\ngive more back. A key question as they enter late\nlife is which children in the family will provide\nparental care? Understanding whether and why\nparents differentiate among Baby Boomer siblings\nis a first step in answering this question.\nSibling differentiation is not new to the Baby\nBoomers in late life. A substantial body of work has\ndemonstrated that parents' relationships with their\noffspring differ considerably within the same family\nthroughout childhood and adolescence (Suitor,\nSechrist, Plikuhn, Pardo, & Pillemer, 2008), estab-\nlishing patterns that might continue into adulthood.\nHowever, it is plausible that parents cease to engage\nin differentiation by the time the children reach mid-\nlife. The   separated from their parents\nin young adulthood both physically (by moving out of\nparental homes) and psychologically (by establishing\nautonomy), leaving fewer opportunities for parents\nto draw contrasts among their children.\nWithin Family Differences Study Design\nThe Within Family Differences Study (WFDS)\nwas designed to explore these alternative scenarios\nin siblings' relationships with their parents. The\nWFDS asks two key questions about the Baby\nBoomers: (a) Do aging parents differentiate among\nBaby Boomer siblings and, if so, (b) does such dif-\nferentiation matter to the siblings involved? More-\nover, this study is well suited to address questions\nregarding the parents' future caregiving.\nThe WFDS began in 2001 with the selection of\nliving children. At the end of each interview, the\nmothers were asked to provide contact informa-\ntion for their children. Approximately 63% of the\nmothers agreed to provide information, and\napproximately 70% of the children agreed to par-\nticipate. Telephone interviews were completed\nwith at least one child in 300 families, resulting in\na sample of 773 adult children. One hundred\ntwenty-nine fathers also participated.\nDoes Differentiation Exist in Baby Boomer Families?\nThe WFDS asked parents about relationships\nwith their middle-aged children across a range of\ndimensions. Analyses revealed that most parents\ndifferentiated among their offspring across mul-\ntiple relational domains, including closeness,\nconfiding, preferences for care, and instrumental\nand emotional support (Pillemer & Suitor, 2006;\nSuitor, Pillemer, & Sechrist, 2006). For example,\namong mothers, 72% named a child whom they\nwould prefer to care for them in times of illness or\ndisability, 79% named a child to whom they would\nturn first in a crisis, 78% named a child to whom they\nwould talk first when facing a personal problem, and\n64% named a child to whom they were most emo-\ntionally close (Suitor & Pillemer, 2007). Furthermore,\nmore than three quarters of the mothers differentiated\namong their children in providing emotional and\ninstrumental support (Suitor et al., 2006).\nAlthough one might expect these patterns to\ndiffer by gender or race of parent, this was not the\ncase. Percentages of mothers and fathers who dif-\nferentiated among their children were very similar\n(Suitor & Pillemer, in press); likewise, Black and\nWhite mothers were almost equally like to differ-\nentiate among their children (Suitor, Sechrist, &\nMoreover, it was surprising that the adult children\nwere relatively accurate in reporting whether their\nmothers currently differentiated among them (Suitor,\nSechrist, Steinhour, & Pillemer, 2006). However,\nonly about half of the adult children correctly identi-\nfied which offspring the mothers favored.\nWhy Does Differentiation Occur and Does it\nMatter?\nAlthough differentiation in young families\nreflects both parents' and children's or teenagers'\ncircumstances and characteristics, differentiation\nwhen children are adults is fueled primarily by\ncharacteristics of the offspring (Suitor et al.,\n2007a). In particular, parents are substantially\nmore likely to favor daughters; children who share\ntheir values and with whom they have a history of\nsupportive exchanges; and, in the case of closeness,\nlast-born children (Pillemer & Suitor, 2006; Suitor &\nPillemer, 2006). In contrast, parents' characteris-\ntics play no role in when differentiation occurs or\nwhich children are favored (Suitor et al., 2007a).\nThe implications of this differentiation were\nevident with regard to offspring's well-being. WFDS\nanalyses showed that parental differentiation has\na major impact on adult children. When children\nperceived their mothers as differentiating among\noffspring or recall mothers \"playing favorites\" in\nchildhood, they reported more problematic relation-\nships with their siblings and higher depressive symp-\ntoms (Pillemer, Suitor, Pardo, & Henderson, 2010;\nSuitor et al., 2009). The question remains as to\nwhether differentiation matters for parents as well.\nThe Gerontologist\nDifferentiation and Parental Caregiving in Late Life\nThere is a reason to expect that parental favorit-\nism will play a role in caregiving as parents age\nand require greater assistance. The WFDS findings\nsuggest that expectations regarding care are estab-\nlished long before parents are in need of such assis-\ntance. In fact, the study found that more than three\nquarters of the mothers in the WFDS named a spe-\ncific child as the one most likely to care for them\nwhen they became ill or disabled (Pillemer &\nSuitor, 2006). Mothers typically expected that this\nrole would be filled by daughters and by children\nwho shared their values, lived a short distance\naway, had provided support in the past year, and to\nwhom they felt high levels of emotional closeness.\nSurprisingly, indicators of a child's availability--\nincluding children's competing marital or parental\nroles and responsibilities, education, or children's\nproblems--were not related to which child the\nmother viewed as the likely caregiver.\nThese results suggest that mothers are heavily\ninfluenced in their preferences and expectations\nregarding their future caregiver by factors that rep-\nresent comfort, trust, and reliability in interpersonal\nrelations such as gender and attitudinal similarity,\nemotional closeness, and a history of having been\nprovided support by the child in the past. They also\ncall into question the importance of instrumental\nand contextual factors, including competing family\nroles or serious life problems that might appear to\nmake a child a less appropriate caregiver.\nSuch clear expectations regarding caregiving are\nlikely to have consequences when assistance\nbecomes necessary. Theory and research suggest\nthat consistency between expectations for care and\nactual patterns of care will have a major impact on\noutcomes, including psychological well-being of\nboth parents and children. This pattern may be\nespecially important in the case of family care-\ngivers. Assuming the role of family caregiver to an\nimpaired older person represents a major transi-\ntion that typically has consequences for the care-\ngiver's physical, mental, and social well-being\n(Pavalko, 2011); day-to-day demands are both\nhighly stressful and unfamiliar to most individuals\nbefore assuming this position themselves (Gaugler,\nSpecific expectations regarding which the child\nwill become the primary caregiver in the family\nalso introduce the possibility of violated expec-\ntations, which have been shown to produce psy-\nchological distress and tension in the relationship\n(MacDermid, Huston, & McHale, 1990). For Baby\nBoomers and their parents, violations of expecta-\ntions may create anxiety on the part of parents and\nconflict among siblings as well. These issues may be\nfurther confounded if the Baby Boomer simulta-\nneously is supporting grown children.\nInteractions with Grown Children: The Family\nExchanges Study\nThe   also engage in support\nexchanges with generations below as well as from\nabove; many   find themselves jug-\ngling help to grown children as well as aging par-\nents. Moreover,   pivot between not\njust two generational rungs, but multiple parents\nand grown children on each rung. The Baby Boom-\ners have received assistance from their parents\nthroughout their life and many continue to do so in\nmidlife (Zarit & Eggebeen, 2002). Notwithstanding,\nas the   enter late life, they face greater\ndemands from aging parents confronting health\ndeclines and grown children experiencing economic\ndifficulties. Thus, a second key question as the\n  enter late life is when and why they\nprovide assistance to their grown children and\nwhen and why they funnel aid to parents?\nConsistent with prior cohorts, the  \ntypically value relationships with their grown chil-\ndren more than relationships with their parents\n(Giarrusso, Feng, & Bengtson, 2005). Yet, the cir-\ncumstances of their relationships are distinct when\ncompared with prior cohorts. The  '\nparents have survived longer with chronic diseases\nhitting later than in the past (Schoeni, Freedman, &\nMartin, 2008). Their children have encountered\neconomic downturns, high demands for education,\nand uncertainties in finding a stable mate (Fursten-\nberg, 2010). Both generations incur needs that draw\non the  . The Family Exchanges Study\n(FES) was designed to examine  '\ninteractions with multiple generational partners.\nThe FES Design\nThe FES included families consisting of middle-\naged   (n = 633), their spouses (i.e.,\nother parent of offspring, n = 197), up to three\ngrown offspring (n = 592), and each living parent\nhigh-density minority neighborhoods yielded a\nsample that was 36% minority, particularly African\nAmerican.\nFES involved succinct questions in computer-\nassisted telephone interviews to garner participants'\nperceptions of each family member. Middle-aged\n  provided information about each\ngrown child (n = 1,384) and living parent (n =\n860), regardless of whether those family members\nparticipated. Participating spouses (n = 197), grown\npleted similar surveys, providing a rich multiparty\nportrait of family life.\nThe FES applied theories of social support\n(Antonucci, 2001) to assess exchanges of advice,\ninformation, emotional support, technical help, and\ncompanionship as well as material and practical\nhelp (Fingerman, Pitzer, et al., 2011). The study also\nassessed contextual factors such as demographic\ncharacteristics (e.g., education, race), relationship\nqualities, and needs (e.g., disability, student status).\nThe Scope of Intergenerational Support\nIn FES, most  ' intergenerational rela-\ntionships were thriving. As expected, most Boomers\nreported frequent contact and exchanges of support\nwith both parents and grown children. Middle-aged\n  offered each child a listening ear and\nemotional support more than once a week, advice once\na month, and practical and financial assistance from\nmonthly to several times a year on average (Fingerman,\nMiller, Birditt, & Zarit, 2009).   were\nalso involved in support of parents, particularly when\nparents incurred crises or disabilities that required\nhelp (Fingerman, Pitzer, et al., 2011; Fingerman,\nVanderDrifts, Dotterer, Birditt, & Zarit, 2011).\nThese patterns are not surprising; intergenera-\ntional support transcends the Baby Boomer cohort\nand is common across history and cultural groups.\nYet, U.S.   are much more involved\nwith their own grown children than their parents\nwere with them. This trend began in childhood. A\nnational study of time use conducted from 1965\nto 1998 revealed parents spent increasingly more\nwhen the   were likely to be raising\nyoung children (the oldest   were\n2004). Moreover, studies of involvement with\ngrown children reveal similar findings. Many of\nthe  ' children entered young adult-\nhood in the early 2000s. Comparing data from the\nadults report more frequent contact, receive more\nfrequent support, and share more similar values\nwith their parents than was the case in the prior\ndecades (Bengtson, Biblarz, & Roberts, 2002;\nFingerman, Cheng, Tighe, Birditt, & Zarit, in\npress). Data from the National Survey of Families\nand Households collected in 1988 revealed that\nfewer than half (46%) of parents gave advice to a\ngrown child in the past month and only 31% pro-\nvided any child practical assistance (Eggebeen, 1992).\nadvice to at least one child every month and 69%\ngave practical support (Fingerman et al., in press).\nIncreased parental involvement may be benefi-\ncial to   and their children. Educa-\ntors and popular media lament \"helicopter\nparents\" who hover over their grown children.\nBut complex economic and social demands make\nit difficult for the  ' children to gain\na foothold in adulthood (Furstenberg, 2010) and\nparents may assist in these processes. In FES, more\nthan 20% of grown children received multiple\nforms of support from Baby Boomer parents sev-\neral times a week; more importantly, the grown\nchildren reported better adjustment and well-being\nfrom receiving such support (Fingerman, Cheng,\nDifferentiation across Generations\nJust as their parents differentiate among the\n , similarly, the   do\nnot support each child or parent comparably. The\nmultidimensional intergenerational support model\naddresses factors underlying the  '\ndecisions to help each grown child or aging parent\n(Birditt, & Fingerman, in press; Fingerman &\n  make decisions about whether\nto help aging parents or grown children based on\ninterrelated issues: resources they have, demands\nthey face from multiple family members, each fam-\nily member's needs, and the Boomers' own sense\nof reward from helping a given family member.\nThe role of resources warrants particular con-\nsideration. The   are heterogeneous\neconomically and their ability to provide support\nclearly depends on what they have. Economic\nbackground and current conditions shape what\n  provide their grown children. Well-\noff parents may invest in their children's educa-\ntion. By contrast, less well-off parents may assist\nchildren who are unemployed or have jobs with\nlow wages, changing hours, and few benefits.\nThe Gerontologist\nSimilarly, needs vary by economic background;\npoorer   face greater demands from\nfamily members. Under increasing family demands,\n  often provide more time, effort,\nand money than when such demands are less\n(Fingerman et al., 2009; Lee, Zarit, Rovine, Birditt, &\ndescribed resource expansion when individuals\nstretch time and material resources to meet many\nfamily members' needs.\nA counter aspect of this model involves dimin-\nishing receipt of support. In FES, controlling for\neconomic background,   with a\ngreater number of children gave more support\ncollectively to their children, but any given child\nreceived less support across a variety of domains\n(e.g., financial, practical, emotional; Fingerman\net al., 2009). Similarly, married couples with a\ngreater number of living parents expended more\ntime and energy helping parents, but each parent\nreceived less support (Lee et al., 2011). On aver-\nage, however,   have fewer children\nthan their parents did, and many  \nhave sufficient resources to provide support. Thus,\na low balance of demands to resources may explain\nmany Boomers' high involvement with their children.\nMoreover,   rally around a variety\nof family needs: (a) crises, (b) ongoing problems,\n(c) everyday needs, and (d) future success. Prior\nresearch has shown that middle-aged adults\nrespond to aging parents' health problems with\ndirect aid (Silverstein, Gans, & Yang, 2006). Simi-\nlarly, children who are least well off in a family\ntypically receive the most support (Attias-Donfut &\nWolff, 2000). But, in addition, to support in\nresponse to crises, the   acknowledge\ncommon everyday needs with support such as\nbabysitting, running an errand, or offering advice\nto solve a problem, particularly for their grown\nchildren (Fingerman et al., in press).\n  also allocate resources based on\npersonal values. A study comparing intergenera-\ntional African American and White families attests\nto this premise (Fingerman, VanderDrift, et al.,\n2011). African American   gave more\nfrequent support of all types to their aging parents\nthan White   did, but this difference\nwas not due to the parents' disability or needs.\nInstead, beliefs that one should help parents and\nperceived rewards of helping parents explained the\nracial difference.\nFinally, the   may consider their\nchildren as their legacy. In FES, the  \nhelped children who had good relationships with\nthem and whom they found it rewarding to help\n(Fingerman et al., in press). These Boomer parents\nalso provided support to specific children they\nviewed as potentially successful (Fingerman et al.,\n2009). Even in their generosity,   may\nbe less interdependent and more individual ori-\nented; they give because it makes them feel good.\nIntergenerational Support as the  \nGrow Older\nAs the   incur disability and other\ndeclines, the obvious question is who will attend to\ntheir needs? Their parents have served as a source\nof support throughout their lives. As they deal\nwith the loss of their parents,   may\nincreasingly turn to their own children.\nFrequent involvement with grown children\nbodes well for a majority of the  .\nPrior studies have found children typically support\naging parents if they received support in young\nadulthood (Silverstein, Conroy, Wang, Giarrusso, &\nBengtson, 2002). Nonetheless, a proportion of\n  may languish in late life due to a\nlack of connection to their grown children. Changes\nin romantic patterns and marital disruptions may\nrelegate some   (particularly men) to\nreceive diminished support from grown children in\nlate life.\nMarital Transitions and Intergenerational Ties: The\nLongitudinal Study of Generations\nRomantic ties often serve as a platform for ties\nto grown children, particularly for fathers. Baby\nBoomers have been the first generation to bear the\nbrunt of the divorce revolution and its aftermath.\nThree explanations suggest that  \nwho are not married may be at heightened risk for\nlack of support from grown children in late life,\nthese factors include (a) a diminished sense of obli-\ngation, (b) poorer emotional bonds, and (c) a lack\nof parental investment in the child earlier in life.\nThus, a final question regarding the  \nin late life is will the children and stepchildren of\nthe divorce revolution provide care for their older\nparents?\nIn general, weakening norms of family obli-\ngation over the past half century may lessen the\nlikelihood that   will receive support\nfrom grown children. This is particularly the\ncase for nonmarried Boomers. Research suggests\nchildren of divorce feel less filial obligation to\nassist older family members than those who have\nnot experienced a marital disruption (Ganong &\nFurthermore, filial support available to older\nparents has its roots in early family experiences\ninvolving reciprocity and attachment. The princi-\nple of reciprocity implies that children who received\ntime and financial investments from parents in\nearly life will reciprocate, sometimes decades later,\nby providing parents social support and instru-\nmental care (Kohli, 2005). An attachment perspec-\ntive posits that close emotional bonds forged with\nparents early in life promote strong and altruistic\ntendencies in adult children (Silverstein et al.,\n2002). Divorce and remarriage appear to compro-\nmise both reciprocity and attachment mechanisms\nfor securing informal eldercare by disrupting par-\nents' early investments in children and compromis-\ning secure intergenerational bonds (Lin, 2008).\nThe Longitudinal Study of Generations\nThe task of understanding such family dynam-\nics from a cross-cohort perspective is made possible\nby the Longitudinal Study of Generations (LSOG),\na study spanning four decades. The LSOG began\nuals nested within 351 three-generation families.\nThe sample was derived via a multistage stratified\nrandom selection of grandfathers enrolled in a\nlarge southern California HMO and their descen-\ndants. Each family lineage consisted of older G1\ngrandfathers, middle-aged G2 children, and late\nadolescent G3 grandchildren. Spouses of family\nmembers in each generation were also surveyed.\nBeginning in 1985, follow-up surveys were admin-\nThe LSOG is unique because it followed indi-\nviduals in multiple linked generations over a period\nof history when many social changes occurred.\nTwo important features of the LSOG shed light on\nthe  : (a) the capacity to compare\n  with other generations when each is\nat the same stage of life but experiencing different\nsociohistorical conditions and (b) the ability to\ntrack Baby Boom respondents from when they\nwere as young as 16 years to late middle age.\nCaring for Parents\nResearch from the LSOG has focused on the\nrole of early family conditions that predispose\nadult children to provide support to older parents.\nParrott and Bengtson (1999) found that intergen-\nerational relationships with higher levels of affec-\ntion were more likely to later be characterized by\nreciprocal exchanges of support between the gen-\nerations. By contrast, lessened affection may be\nassociated with diminished sense of obligation to\nprovide parental care. Schmeeckle, Giarrusso,\nFeng, & Bengtson (2006) found that current and\nformer stepparents were less likely to be perceived\nby their stepchildren as parent-like figures because\nthe affective quality of their earlier relationships\nwas poorer compared with parent\u00adchild relation-\nships in intact families.\nLSoG data have also revealed that parental vul-\nnerability tends to activate earlier held filial expec-\ntations and feelings of attachment into supportive\nbehavior. Silverstein and colleagues (2002) found\nthat middle-aged children who had emotionally\ncloser relations with their mothers as adolescents\nwere more likely to provide support three decades\nlater when their mothers experienced severe func-\ntional impairments.\nSimilarly, familistic values prospectively pre-\ndicted the support children provided, but only when\ntriggered by parents' frailty as manifested by poor\nfunctional health and widowhood (Silverstein et al.,\n2006). In this sense, filial norms and attachment\nare forms of social capital that may remain latent\nfor decades until action is required (Silverstein &\nConroy, 2009), and marital disruption may result\nin a loss of such capital.\nIt is important to note that changes in norms of\nobligation are widespread, perhaps linked to\nchanging marital patterns. Silverstein and Giarrusso\n(2011) applied a generational-sequential design--\nwhere G3 (children) and G2 (parents) were\nmatched at the same chronological age and con-\ntrasted across historical periods 30 years apart--to\nstudy how the strength of emotional bonds between\nmiddle-aged children and their older mothers and\nfathers changed across adjacent generations. The\nauthors found that G3 and G2 relationships were\nweaker than G2 and G1 relationships when the\nchild generation in each dyad averaged about\n45 years of age. This weakening was partially\nexplained by the increased prevalence of marital\ndisruption and steprelations, but it was mostly\nexplained by a decline in the strength of familistic\nvalues in successive generations.\nFurthermore, LSOG data have shown that\nthe strength of parent-care norms has weakened\nThe Gerontologist\n2006),whereasvaluesofindividualismhavestrength-\nened over the same historical period (Roberts &\nBengtson, 1999). Cross-national data support this\nfinding as well. A large multigeneration study in\nthe Netherlands found that middle-aged Dutch\nadults were even less likely to endorse feelings of\nobligation to help parents than were middle-aged\nAmerican adults (Cooney & Dykstra, 2011). Thus,\nU.S.   are not alone in experiencing\ndiminished values for family.\nAging   in the Context of Marital\nDisruption\nTaken together, LSOG studies have offered evi-\ndence that poor early parent\u00adchild relationships\nmay have adverse implications for future caregiv-\ning roles in complex families where intergenera-\ntional bonds are notably weaker. These trends are\nlinked to marital instability and family disruption\nand portend greater atomization in the family, with\nconsequences for the support and care the current\ncohort of adult children will provide to their divorced\nBaby Boom parents and stepparents.\nEvidence from the LSOG suggests filial obliga-\ntions and attachment--precisely those aspects of\nintergenerational relationships that are compro-\nmised in divorced and stepfamilies--are important\nmotivators of social support to older parents.\nWere we to prognosticate based on the LSOG and\naccumulated evidence, we would be less than san-\nguine about intergenerational care available to\nBaby Boom parents as they grow older, particu-\nlarly fathers whose relationships with adult chil-\ndren are detached due to divorce and remarriage\n(Silverstein, Bengtson, & Lawton, 1997). Some of\nthese fathers may remarry, however, and benefit\nfrom care provided by a new, and possibly younger,\nspouse.\nYet, adaptation to new realities may blunt the\nimpact of family change. The support portfolio of\nolder adults may actually widen with the prolifera-\ntion of kin ties that result from multiple divorces\nand remarriages (Riley & Riley, 1994). Moreover,\npersonal values may dictate patterns of support\nmore than norms and obligations among the Baby\nBoomers and their progeny. Thus, gerontologists\nmight focus on within family differences and\ncompare biological and stepchildren in their filial\ncommitment (Pillemer & Suitor, 2006) and track\nsupport   receive as they advance to\nan age when the true impact of the divorce revolu-\ntion will be discernable.\nImplications of the  ' Ties to Parents\nand Children for the Future\nAlthough the demise of the American family\nhas been lamented throughout the Baby Boom-\ners' lives, most   are actively\ninvolved with members of generations above and\nbelow them. Nonetheless, as these three studies\nindicate, significant societal changes have\nresulted in more individualized relationship\npatterns and weakening norms regarding what\nis expected from family members. As the Baby\nBoomers enter the final decades of life, they are\nlikely to experience: (a) caregiving for their par-\nents; (b) losses of parents, siblings, and even chil-\ndren; and (c) eventual needs for care themselves.\nFrom a practical perspective, each of these issues\npresents complexities.\nWith regard to caregiving, research has docu-\nmented the effectiveness of a family meeting sup-\nplementing individual counseling for caregivers\nof older adults suffering from dementia (Zarit &\nFemia, 2008). For the  , a key issue is\nwho to invite to such a meeting. Both the changing\ndynamics of marriage and the longevity of sibling\nties provide an array of individuals who could be\ninvolved in care. Beyond legal aspects of medical\ndecisions, caregiving will need to counterbalance\ninclusiveness with effectiveness. The WFDS sug-\ngests individuals remain sensitive to being less\nfavored than other family members. Thus, exclu-\nsion from parental or stepparental care may have\ndeleterious effects on well-being and self-esteem,\nand this possibility should be considered in care\nplanning.\nAlthough demands of raising young children\nhave not typically conflicted with parental care\n(Grundy & Henretta, 2006; Loomis & Booth,\n1995), these patterns may change for a subset of\nthe youngest   or the oldest Baby\nBoomers' own children in the future. Since the\nearly 1990s, the number of women giving birth\nhas the number of women older than 40 years who\nHamilton, Martin, & Ventura, 2006; National\nHealth Statistics, 1997). Delayed childbearing\nincreases the likelihood of facing concurrent\ndemands from both generations for intense care.\nDue to the large sibships typical of the Baby Boom,\nhowever, Boomers who had children late may have\nsiblings who are available to care for their own\nparents. The proportion of women in this age\nrange is also still relatively small, but nonetheless,\nthis trend suggests that a subset of  \nmay require care from children in the throws of\nraising children of their own.\nThe FES and LSOG also document the need to\nconsider the role of personal values in the experi-\nences of providing support. The FES found that\n  are more motivated to provide care\nwhen they find doing so to be personally reward-\ning. Some   who find providing care\nunpleasant may favor the idea of formal or institu-\ntional care for parents (Zarit & Femia, 2008).\nIndeed, the 1990s already saw increasing trends\ntoward use of paid care and decreasing informal\nfamily care, and these trends may persist as the\n  care for their parents (Spillman &\nPezzin, 2000). Thus, interventions and policies\nwill be most effective when acknowledging many\nviews on the best means of caring for older adults.\nThe next few decades will involve loss of loved\nones for  . Many   have\nalready lost a parent, but nearly all  \nwill be orphaned in the upcoming decades. Inheri-\ntance among siblings is typically equitable, but\nprior inequities in transfers when the parents were\nalive (McGarry & Schoeni, 1997) may resurface and\ngenerate conflict among siblings. Workplace bereave-\nment policies also may be challenged due to marital\ndynamics as   and their children\nencounter deaths of stepparents, parents, ex-in-laws,\nand other family members in the older generation.\nFinally, in coming decades,   them-\nselves will incur disability and require care. The\nmajority of Baby Boomer parents are actively\ninvolved with at least one grown child on a weekly\nor even daily basis (Fingerman et al., in press).\nAlthough norms and perceived obligation to\nsupport family members have weakened (Gans &\nSilverstein, 2006), such intensive involvement\nbodes well, based on LSOG data showing endurance\nof strong attachments and reciprocity (Silverstein\net al., 2002). Many   may reap the ben-\nefits of reciprocity when they themselves are old.\nNonetheless, aside from family structure changes\nthat involve limited assistance from stepchildren,\nother conditions may constrain the  '\nchildren from assisting them. Most grown children\nbenefit from parental involvement (Fingerman,\nCheng, et al., 2011), but for some grown children,\nparental overinvolvement in early adulthood may\nlimit acquisition of skills to provide care in return.\n ' children also are likely to be single\nparents; nearly, 4 in 10 births in the United States\nSimilarly, if the weakened economy persists, some of\nthe  ' children may be struggling finan-\ncially, working in unstable jobs, managing multiple\nstressors in their own lives, and unable to allocate\ntime necessary to provide care consistently.\nThe   have lived through and\nshaped societal changes that define the nature of\nintergenerational ties in the 21st century. As\nthey enter later life, they are likely to increas-\ningly value their family ties. Yet, the Baby Boom-\ners are a unique cohort and their approach to\nthese family ties may define new patterns for future\ngenerations.\nFunding\nThis paper was written with grants from the National Institute on\nof Intergenerational Transfers and Family Exchanges Study 2, Karen\n04, The Within Family Differences Study, J.
