McEwen, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY, and approved February 27, 2012 (received for review November 7, 2011)\nWe propose a model wherein chronic stress results in glucocorticoid\nreceptor resistance (GCR) that, in turn, results in failure to down-\nregulate inflammatory response. Here we test the model in two\nviral-challenge studies. In study 1, we assessed stressful life events,\nGCR, and control variables including baseline antibody to the chal-\nlenge virus, age, body mass index (BMI), season, race, sex, educa-\ntion, and virus type in 276 healthy adult volunteers. The volunteers\nwere subsequently quarantined, exposed to one of two rhinovi-\nruses, and followed for 5 d with nasal washes for viral isolation\nand assessment of signs/symptoms of a common cold. In study 2,\nwe assessed the same control variables and GCR in 79 subjects who\nwere subsequently exposed to a rhinovirus and monitored at base-\nline and for 5 d after viral challenge for the production of local (in\nnasal secretions) proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, TNF-, and IL-6).\nStudy 1: After covarying the control variables, those with recent\nexposure to a long-term threatening stressful experience demon-\nstrated GCR; and those with GCR were at higher risk of subsequently\ndeveloping a cold. Study 2: With the same controls used in study 1,\ngreater GCR predicted the production of more local proinflamma-\ntory cytokines among infected subjects. These data provide support\nfor a model suggesting that prolonged stressors result in GCR,\nwhich, in turn, interferes with appropriate regulation of inflamma-\ntion. Because inflammation plays an important role in the onset and\nprogression of a wide range of diseases, this model may have broad\nimplications for understanding the role of stress in health.\nlymphocytes | receptor sensitivity | psychological stress | cortisol |\nhypothalamic\u00adpituitary\u00adadrenocortical axis\nChronic psychological stress is associated with a greater risk of\ndepression, cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, autoim-\nmune diseases, upper respiratory infections (URIs), and poorer\nwound healing (1). Although these associations are often attrib-\nuted to stress-induced dysregulation of the hypothalamic\u00adpitui-\ntary\u00adadrenocortical axis (HPA) (e.g., refs. 2, 3), few human studies\ninclude assessments of stressful events, HPA response, and a dis-\nease outcome in the same subjects. The lack of such studies is partly\nattributable to the as yet incomplete understanding of the effects of\nprolonged stress on the HPA in human subjects (4) and on de-\ntermining which stress-induced changes in HPA play a downstream\nrole in disease risk. The simple notion that chronic stress acts\nthrough the direct effects of elevated circulating cortisol is be-\ncoming less likely (5, 6). What may matter more is how target tis-\nsues respond to cortisol, rather than levels of the hormone per se.\nGCR refers to a decrease in the sensitivity of immune cells to\nglucocorticoid hormones that normally terminate the inflammatory\nresponse (6\u00ad9). Evidence for GCR in response to chronic stress\nhas been found in parents of children with cancer (10), spouses of\nbrain-cancer patients (11) and in persons reporting high levels of\nloneliness (5). Without sufficient glucocorticoid regulation, the\nduration and/or intensity of the inflammatory response increases,\nheightening risk for acute exacerbations such as occur in asthma\nand autoimmune diseases, as well as for the onset and progression\nof chronic inflammatory diseases such as CVD, and type II di-\nIn the common cold, the typical signs and symptoms of illness\nare primarily caused by the release of the proinflammatory cyto-\nkines produced in response to infection (13). A series of studies\nhave shown that chronic stress is associated with increased sus-\nceptibility to developing a common cold among persons experi-\nmentally exposed to an upper respiratory virus (e.g., refs. 14\u00ad17).\nThis association has been replicated in cross-sectional and pro-\nspective studies conducted in natural settings (18). Although\nattempts to identify behavioral pathways linking stress to cold\nsusceptibility have not been especially successful (14, 15), there is\nevidence consistent with stress effects resulting in increased dis-\nease risk because of their association with exaggerated local (in\nthe nose) release of inflammatory cytokines (16). The explanation\nfor this association has been that stress disrupts the HPA response\nand that the regulation of inflammation is under HPA control.\nHowever, cortisol levels based on 24-h urine (15) and waking di-\nurnal assessments in saliva (19, 20) do not play a part in this\nprocess. Alternatively, what matters may be how the target tissue\nresponds to cortisol, rather than the levels of the hormone per se.\nTo the extent that chronic stress results in GCR, one might expect\ninsufficient control over the inflammatory response to the in-\nfection, and consequently a greater expression of the signs and\nsymptoms of disease.\nThe viral-challenge paradigm provides an ideal context to study\nthe general model of stress leading to disease via effects on the\nHPA and inflammatory regulation. In these studies, stress and\nGCR are assessed before subjects are exposed to a virus and fol-\nlowed in quarantine to determine whether they develop a clinical\nillness (infection plus signs of illness). Here we conduct secondary\nanalyses of two independent studies (15, 21), each using a different\nmeans of assessing GCR, to address the potential role of target\ntissue sensitivity to cortisol in linking stress to disease. In study 1,\nwe attempt to replicate earlier evidence that stress exposure is\nassociated with increased GCR (5, 6, 9\u00ad11) and test whether GCR\nprospectively predicts who will develop a cold when exposed to\na rhinovirus. In study 2, we address whether GCR is prospectively\nassociated with the magnitude of the local inflammatory cytokine\nresponse to being infected by a cold virus. We predict that GCR\nwill be associated with experiencing a long-term threatening\nstressful experience, will interfere with the down-regulation of\nproinflammatory cytokine response, and will increase illness ex-\npression among persons infected with a cold virus.\nAuthor contributions: S.C., W.J.D., and G.E.M. designed research; S.C., W.J.D., E.F., B.S.R.,\nand R.B.T. performed research; E.F. and R.B.T. contributed new reagents/analytic tools;\nS.C. and D.J.-D. analyzed data; and S.C., D.J.-D., W.J.D., G.E.M., E.F., B.S.R., and R.B.T.\nwrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n*This Direct Submission article had a prearranged editor.\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In study 1, where subjects receive one of two viruses,\nanalyses also control for virus type [rhinovirus (RV)21 or RV39].\nStudy 1. Stress and colds. As reported in similar analyses of these\ndata (14), in a multiple logistic regression, exposure to a recent\nmajor stressful life event was associated with an increased risk\nfor developing a cold following exposure to RV (OR = 1.99,\nCI = 1.04, 3.08). This association was similar across the two\nviruses (P > 0.16 for stress-by-virus interaction).\nStress, GCR, and colds. Greater levels of glucocorticoid are associated\nwith higher numbers of circulating neutrophils, lower numbers\nof circulating lymphocytes, and a lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte\n(N/L) ratio--an overall marker of the trafficking of these cells (e.g.,\nsociation can be used to indirectly assess GCR. The logic of the\nmeasure is that there is a strong physiologic correlation between\ncortisol levels and the number of circulating leukocytes only if\nleukocyte glucocorticoid receptors are sensitive (i.e., signaling cells\nto redistribute).\nStress and GCR. We found the expected associations between\nleukocyte numbers and cortisol among those who did not expe-\nrience a major stressor (n = 83). In contrast, consistent with the\nhypothesis that stress results in GCR, there were no associations\nbetween cortisol and leukocytes among those who did experience\na stressor (n = 193). Fig. 1 displays these findings graphically\nusing the relation of cortisol to N/L ratio as an example. That the\nslopes of the stressed and nonstressed subjects were different\nfrom each other is supported by stress-by-cortisol level inter-\nactions found in linear regressions predicting lymphocytes (P =\nall three analyses, simple slopes for those without stress were\nsignificantly different from 0, whereas slopes for those with stress\nwere not (Table 1). These analyses support GCR emergence\namong those experiencing major stressors.\nGCR and colds. Similarly we find the expected associations between\ncortisol and leukocyte counts for persons who did not develop\na cold following viral challenge (n = 167). In contrast, and con-\nsistent with GCR putting people at greater risk for illness, there\nwere no associations between cortisol and leukocyte counts\namong those who did develop a cold (n = 109). (Fig. 2, N/L ratio.)\nHere linear regressions indicate stress-by-cortisol interactions for\nlymphocytes (P = 0.02), neutrophils (marginal at P = 0.08), and\nN/L ratio (P = 0.02). For all three analyses, simple slopes among\nthose who did not develop a cold were significantly different from\n0, whereas slopes for those who did develop a cold were not\n(Table 2). As expected, plasma cortisol levels did not predict who\nfrom these prospective analyses support the hypothesis that GCR\npredicts an increased risk for colds following viral exposure,\nwhereas levels of circulating cortisol do not.\nConsideration of alternative explanations. To evaluate the possibility\nthat sympathetic nervous system hormones that often increase\nwith cortisol may be driving the redistribution of cells, we con-\nducted all of the same analyses described earlier replacing cor-\ntisol with epinephrine (E) and with norepinephrine (NE). These\nhormones were not associated with numbers of any of the cell\ntypes in relevant subgroups of subjects defined by either stress\nor colds.\nStudy 2. GCR and nasal cytokines. We suggest that the association of\nGCR with colds reflects inadequate control of local inflammatory\nresponses to the virus. To test this hypothesis, we examine\nwhether GCR predicts the production of local proinflammatory\ncytokines when subjects are exposed to a rhinovirus. Data for this\nstudy were collected from a subsample of subjects in a larger viral-\nchallenge trial (15). Here GCR was assessed before viral chal-\nlenge using a standard ex vivo model (6), wherein leukocytes were\ncoincubated with lipopolysaccharide and dexamethasone, and\nproinflammatory cytokine production measured in supernatants.\nThe logic behind this assay is that dexamethasone should inhibit\ncytokine production only to the extent that leukocytes are sensi-\ntive to its effects. This study had enough subjects with the required\ndata to examine cytokine response (a continuous variable) but not\ncolds (a dichotomous outcome).\nFig. 1. Association between plasma cortisol and the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes for subjects experiencing and not experiencing a significant stressful\nlife event during the last year. Lack of correlation is a marker of GCR. Filled circles/solid line, major stressful life event; open circles/dashed line, no stressful event.\nTable 3 presents the partial correlations between GCR and\nproinflammatory cytokine levels in the nasal cavity during the 5 d\nfollowing viral challenge. For both IL-6 and TNF-, increases in\nthe resistance curve were associated with increased production of\nthe matching local inflammatory cytokine. Greater IL-1 GCR\nwas also associated with greater local IL-6 production. The cor-\nrelation of IL-1 GCR with local IL-1 release was in the expected\ndirection, but was not significant. All of these results are the same\nwhether the analyses include all subjects, or are limited to those\ninfected by the virus. Cortisol levels as assessed by multiple sam-\nples of saliva collected across the day before viral challenge were\nunrelated to any of the three GCR measures (all P > 0.20) or to\nproinflammatory cytokine levels (all P > 0.40). Overall, these data\nare consistent with the hypothesis that a decreased sensitivity of\nleukocytes to the inhibitory effects of cortisol (increased GCR)\nreflects a decreased ability of cortisol to regulate the production of\nlocal proinflammatory cytokines in response to infection.\nDiscussion\nWe proposed that exposure to a major stressful life event can result\nin GCR, which, in turn, would interfere with HPA down-regulation\nof local proinflammatory cytokine response to an infectious agent.\nWithout appropriate cortisol regulation of the local cytokine re-\nsponse, there would be an exaggerated expression of the signs of\nURI, which are generated by the proinflammatory response. In\nstudy 1, stress--defined as a recent stressful life experience asso-\nciated with long-term threat--predicted an increased risk of\ndeveloping a cold following exposure to a rhinovirus (also reported\nin ref. 15). New analyses indicate that this same stress measure\nwas also associated with GCR, with stressed persons showing less\nsensitivity of lymphocyte and neutrophil counts to distributional\nchanges associated with greater circulating levels of cortisol. In\nturn, GCR was prospectively associated with increased risk of\ndeveloping a common cold following experimental inoculation\nwith a cold virus. These data are consistent with a model wherein\nstress leads to GCR, which in turn results in greater risk for de-\nveloping a cold. In study 2, GCR predicted how much local\nproinflammatory cytokine was produced in response to infection.\nBecause the analyses in both studies were prospective, we can\neliminate reverse causation (colds did not cause stress, colds did\nnot cause GCR, and cytokine release did not cause GCR) as an\nalternative explanation. The use of multiple control variables also\neliminates many potential spurious explanations.\nThe GCR measure used in study 1 is indirect. However, exper-\nimental studies have shown that glucocorticoid-induced leukocyte\nredistribution is specifically attributable to glucocorticoid receptor\nsignaling (25), and that the indirect assessment used here corre-\nlates with blunting of lymphocyte redistribution in response to\ndexamethasone injection (24). Even so, it is possible that the action\nof another hormone or mechanism both highly correlated with\ncortisol and having the same impact on leukocyte trafficking as\ncortisol could account for these effects. Likely alternative explan-\nations include that the associations are attributable to subject\nhealth (e.g., infections) or to receptor sensitivity to E and/or NE.\nHealth is not an issue here, because subjects are carefully\nscreened for excellent health. Further, we found that neither E\nnor NE were correlated with leukocyte counts under any of the\nrelevant conditions (similar results in ref. 5). We also found\nconsistent evidence across studies 1 and 2, even though study 2\nused a standard direct assessment of GCR.\nWe found no effects of cortisol levels on disease risk (e.g., refs.\n19, 20), GCR, or inflammation. This apparent lack of a role for\ncirculating cortisol levels is consistent with the possibility that\nimpaired target tissue response to the regulatory effects of this\nhormone may overshadow any modulatory influences that might\nresult from changes in circulating concentrations of cortisol itself.\nFig. 2. Association between plasma cortisol and the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes for subjects who developed and did not develop a cold after exposure\nto a rhinovirus. Lack of correlation is a marker of GCR. Filled circles/solid line, meets cold criterion; open circles/dashed line, does not meet cold criterion.\nTable 1.

Because inflammation plays a role in progression of mul-\ntiple diseases, this model not only provides an explanation for the\nincreased risk for URI under stress, but might provide a more\ngeneral explanation for why prolonged stress would play a role in\nother inflammatory diseases as well. Moreover, although the focus\nhere has been on GCR in circulating leukocytes and neutrophils,\nstress could also be associated with illness expression through its\neffect on the glucocorticoid sensitivity of other cells involved in\nimmune defenses (26). For example, glucocorticoid receptors (GR)\nare expressed by cells involved with antigen presentation, such as\ndendrocytes and macrophages, not only in circulation but also at\nspecific sites of infection and in draining lymph nodes.\nParodoxically, proinflammatory cytokines are thought to both\nup-regulate immunity to the virus and produce cold symptoms\n(13). However, here stress and GCR, conditions associated with\nincreased levels of local proinflammatory cytokine, predicted a\ngreater risk of clinical illness. These data are consistent with\nthose of other viral-challenge studies that found a positive as-\nsociation between proinflammatory cytokine levels and symptom\nAn unexplained inconsistency in the data from study 2 is that\nlocal IL-6 and TNF-, but not IL-1, were correlated with GCR\nmeasured by the whole blood ex vivo assay. It is possible that this\ndiscrepancy is due to the relative insensitivity of the IL-1 assay.\nAlternatively, it may reflect a differential sensitivity of these\ncytokines to glucocorticoid suppression (27).\nFinally, future research on GCR would benefit from quanti-\nfication of GR subtypes, whose relative abundance might un-\nderlie the findings observed here. Chronic stress does not appear\nto affect expression of GR, the active isoform of the receptor\n(11). However, there is evidence linking stress and cytokines to\nhigher levels of GR and a lower GR/GR ratio (28). This\ncould prove important because GR is a dominant negative re-\nceptor for cortisol, which can suppress GR activity and thereby\ncontribute to GCR (28).\nMethods\nStudy 1. Subjects and design. The subjects were 125 men and 151 women, mean\nage 29.13 y (SD = 9.09 y) who responded to newspaper advertisements and\nwere judged to be in good health after a medical examination. Subjects\nwere paid $800 for their participation.\nAfter we assessed life stress, completebloodcounts,cortisol, demographics,\nanthropomorphics, and virus-specific antibody levels, subjects were quaran-\ntined in separate rooms, exposed to one of two RVs and followed for 5 d with\nnasal washes for viral isolation and assessment of symptoms and signs of a\ncommon cold.\nExperimental plan. At the medical screening, age, education, race, sex, body\nweight, and height were also assessed and used as baseline data for those\ndeemed eligible. Eligible subjects returned to the hospital 4 and 5 wk later\n(1\u00ad2 wk before viral challenge) for two blood samples for determination of\ncomplete blood counts, antibody to the challenge virus, and plasma cortisol\nand for the stressful life event interview.\nAfter completing the baseline assessments, subjects entered quarantine.\nDuring the first 24 h of quarantine (before viral challenge), they had a nasal\nexamination (including a nasal wash culture for RV) and were excluded if there\nwas any indication of recent or current URI or illness. An update stressful life\nevent interview was administered at this time to identify events occurring\nbetween the initial interview and quarantine. Baseline respiratory signs (nasal\nmucociliary clearance and nasal mucus production) and symptoms were\nassessed. At the end of the first 24 h of quarantine, subjects were given nasal\ndrops containing a low infectious dose of either RV21 (N = 129) or RV39 (N =\n147). Quarantine continued for 5 d after challenge. Nasal secretion samples\nfor virus culture were collected on each of the 5 d. Subjects were also tested\non each day for respiratory symptoms, nasal mucociliary clearance, and nasal\nmucus production. Approximately 28 d postchallenge, a blood sample was\ncollected for assaying convalescent antibodies to the challenge virus. All\ninvestigators were blinded to subjects' status on all baseline assessments.\nStressful life events. Life events were assessed by a standardized semistructured\ninterview, the Bedford College Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS)\n(29), and conducted by trained interviewers. We considered only those events\nthat occurred during the last 12 mo. Ratings of events were performed in an\nindependent laboratory by consensus groups consisting of at least four\ntrained interviewers. The interview staff was blind to other study measures.\nRaters were also blind to individuals' subjective responses to the stressful\nevents and used \"dictionaries\" of precedent examples to rate each stressful\nexperience reported during the interview on long-term threat (i.e., threat\nthat is sustained beyond the immediate experience of the event). Dictionary\nratings are based on the likely response of an average person to a stressor\noccurring in the context of the subject's particular set of biographical cir-\ncumstances. It is the long-term threat of an experience that is thought to\ndetermine its implications for health. Here, we define stress as a life experi-\nence, irrespective of duration (including both acute events and chronic dif-\nficulties in LEDS parlance), that was rated as having high moderate or marked\nlong-term threat. We excluded stress resulting from physical illness to avoid\nconfounding a chronic health condition with susceptibility and stressful\nevents in which the subject was not a major focus.\nGCR. We conducted a complete blood count and assayed for cortisol in each of\ntwobloodsamplescollected1and2wkprechallenge.Correlationsbetweencell\ncortisol was measured using a double-antibody competitive RIA. The correla-\ntion between cortisol in the two samples was 0.70, P < 0.001. Because we were\nconcerned with stable differences in cortisol and in cell distributions that occur\nin response to prolonged stress, we averaged the two values in both cases.\nWefoundnoassociationsbetweenmonocyte percentageandcortisolinthe\nentiresampleorin samplesubsets splitbystressorcolds.

Our data\nare therefore based on the associations of cortisol with percentages of lym-\nphocytes and neutrophils.

On each day of quarantine, we collected two objective signs of\ndisease--mucus weights and mucociliary clearance function. Mucus weights\nwere determined by collecting used tissues in sealed plastic bags (31). The\nbags were weighed and the weight of the tissues and bags subtracted. To\nTable 2.

Illness criterion was based on\nobjective indicators of illness--a total adjusted mucus weight of 10 g or an\nadjusted average mucociliary nasal clearance time of 7 min (21).\nStatistical analyses. We conducted two sets of regression analyses, each pre-\ndicting the percentage of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and the N/L ratio. The\nfirst set included the standard covariates, a dichotomous variable repre-\nsenting life stress (1 = stress, 0 = no stress), continuous plasma cortisol, and the\ninteraction of life stress and cortisol. We predicted an interaction with leu-\nkocyte counts increasing (neutrophils and N/L ratio) or decreasing (lym-\nphocytes) with increasing cortisol levels for those without a major stressful life\nevent but not for those with an event. The second set included standard\ncovariates, dichotomous variables for life stress, and cold status (1 = cold, 0 =\nno cold) and the interaction of life stress and cold status. We again predicted\nan interaction with cortisol associated with leukocyte counts among those\nwithout colds but not among those with colds. We also calculated the simple\nslopes for each group in all analyses and tested whether they were signifi-\ncantly different from a slope of 0.\nStudy 2. Subjects and design. The subjects were 39 men and 43 women (mean\nage = 36.9 y, SD = 9.2 y) who responded to advertisements and were judged to\nbe in good health. They were paid $800 for their participation. Three subjects\nwere excluded due to incomplete nasal cytokine data.\nAfter we assessed GCR and the standard control variables, subjects were\nquarantinedinseparaterooms,exposedtoarhinovirusandfollowedfor5dwith\nnasal washes to assess viral shedding and local proinflammatory cytokines.\nExperimental plan. At the medical screening we also collected specific serum\nantibody titer to the challenge virus, demographics, weight, and height.\nBecause we were interested in inflammatory response to infection, we\nmaximized the rate of infection by including only subjects with prechallenge\nviral-specific antibody titers 4.\nDuring the first 24 h of quarantine (before viral challenge) nasal muco-\nciliary clearance and nasal mucus production were assessed. Volunteers were\nexcluded if they had signs or symptoms of a cold and excluded from analysis if\na viral pathogen was isolated from the nasal lavage obtained at that time.\nSubjects were then given nasal drops containing an infectious dose of\nRV39. On each day of quarantine nasal lavage samples were collected for\nvirus culture and assessment of local proinflammatory cytokines. Approxi-\nmately 28 d postchallenge, blood was collected for serological testing. The\ninvestigators were blinded to all baseline measures.\nInfection. Infection was assessed with the same procedures used in study 1.\nGCR. We used a standard in vitro assay to measure GCR that assessed the\ncharide (30 ng/mL) stimulated lymphocyte production of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\n. The remaining procedures were the same as those used in Miller et al. (6).\nArea under the dexamethasone curve (adjusted for an unstimulated control)\nwas used to represent GCR.\nProinflammatory cytokines. We measured IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in nasal secre-\ntions. Nasal wash fluid was assayed for cytokine protein using the BioSource\nTen-plex bead immunoassay and methods provided by the manufacturer\n(BioSource International). Assays were performed in duplicate using a Luminex\n100 bead-based immunoassay system. To control for basal nasal cytokine\nlevels, prechallenge cytokine values were subtracted from the values obtained\non each of the 5 postchallenge days. Nasal cytokine area under the curve (AUC)\nwas derived from these baseline-adjusted values and computed using the\ntrapezoid formula.\nCortisol. Subjects provided seven saliva samples (collected at wake-up and at 1,\n2, 4, 7, 9, and 14 h after wake-up) on the day preceding viral challenge by\nchewing on cotton rolls until saturated and then storing the rolls in plastic\nsalivettes. Code numbers provided by hand-held computers were used to\nguarantee timely collection of samples. Saliva cortisol level was determined\nAUC adjusted for wake-up time was used to represent\ncortisol level.\n"
