    "abstract": "Abstract\nHigh levels of parental/guardian involvement in their children's education are often associated with a number of educational,\nsocial, and even psychological benefits. These include higher rates of school attendance, greater communication with\nthe school or education provider, better social adjustment, and higher levels of academic achievement including in the\ndevelopment of literacy skills. However, despite this, research from the Arab world on the relationship between parental\ninvolvement and children's development of English language literacy skills has tended to report mixed results, with this also\nbeing the case in the Sultanate of Oman. To explore this issue within the Omani context, the current study examined the\npotential benefits, challenges, and practices of Omani parents as these relate to their children's English language studies. A\ntwo-section Likert-type response scale questionnaire was administered to 391 parents of students in the country's public\nschool system. The first questionnaire section related to participants' attitudes about parental involvement in their children's\nEnglish studies while the second explored the frequency with which parents engaged in activities related to their children's\nEnglish classes. Results indicate that Omani parents are generally aware of the importance of their involvement in their\nchildren's development and believe that they should be involved in a number of home- and school-based activities. However,\ndespite this, their actual level of involvement in their children's English language studies was somewhat limited.\n",

These potential benefits, moreover, are in\nevidence across all levels of schooling and not just during the\nearly grades of a child's formal education.\nEmerson, Fear, Fox, and Sanders (2012) state that paren-\ntal involvement can be defined as the building of partner-\nships between families, schools, and communities that\nincrease parental awareness of the benefits of engaging with\ntheir children's education while also developing the skills for\nthis to occur. Berthelsen and Walker (2008), offering an\noverview of the work of scholars including Reynolds and\nO'Donoghue, and Robb (1996), maintain that parental\ninvolvement can be viewed in terms of parental behavior\ntoward, and expectations of, their children's schooling and\nthe actions they subsequently take in this regard either at the\nschool or at home. This perspective can be argued to encom-\npass such constructs as parents participating at their chil-\ndren's schools, communicating with the school, discussing\nwith their children what they have done during school time,\nand supervising schoolwork at home.\nFor Dimock etal. (1996), parental involvement may be\nrelated to a number of dimensions including the choice of\nschools that the parents make, their involvement in the for-\nmal structures that influence school decision making, and in\nteaching and learning either at the school or at home, com-\nmunication with teachers outside of formal meetings, and\n1Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman\nCorresponding Author:\nRahma Al-Mahrooqi, Deputy Vice-Chancellor for Postgraduate Studies\nand Research, Sultan Qaboos University, P.O.

Although\nthere are many avenues through which parents can become\ninvolved in their children's education, a number of scholars\nhave offered guiding principles to make this engagement\nmore effective.\nLiterature Review\nPrinciples of Effective Parental Engagement\nEmerson etal. (2012) offer several principles for effective\nparental engagement in their children's schooling. The first\nof these is academic socialization, which refers to those\nparental behaviors that have a demonstrably positive influ-\nence on children's learning and academic outcomes. This is\nnaturally a very broad area, though the authors highlight how\nthe main aim of academic socialization is to develop learn-\ners' abilities over time to independently establish and assess\ntheir goals, to take responsibility for their actions, and to\nlearn from both their successes and their failures. Emerson\net\nal. claim that academic socialization can be achieved\nthrough parents communicating expectations regarding edu-\ncation to children, highlighting both the value and the enjoy-\nment that can be gained through learning, discussing relevant\nlearning strategies and styles, establishing a connection\nbetween schoolwork and events happening in the child's\nworld, making the home learning environment stimulating,\nencouraging children to develop educational goals and to\nmake preparations to meet those goals, and engaging in\nactivities that build their sense of autonomy and academic\ncapabilities.\nParental role construction, Emerson et\ntinue, refers to the role parents choose to play in their chil-\ndren's education and is often closely linked with parental\nbeliefs about the efficacy of their involvement in this area. It\nmay be developed autonomously or through the school's\nencouragement to participate, and is often considered one of\nthe most important factors linked to children's academic suc-\ncess. The authors claim that this principle is influenced by a\nnumber of factors, including parents'beliefs about what edu-\ncational outcomes for their children are appropriate and\ndesirable, about who is responsible for helping their children\nachieve these outcomes, and about what people, including\nteachers, family members, and other parents, expect from\nthem as a parent.\nThe final principle of parental involvement Emerson etal.\n(2012) offer is parenting style. This is an area associated with\nboth academic success and psychological well-being. For\nexample, the authors claim that parents who expect high lev-\nels of academic achievement yet are emotionally distant may\nactually cause their children to develop low self-esteem\nwhich, in turn, leads to lower levels of academic achieve-\nment. However, parenting styles that encourage communica-\ntion between parents and children, that set limits and rules\nand seek to understand bad decisions, not only contribute to\nhigher levels of emotional well-being but also encourage the\ndevelopment of a child's autonomy and sense of responsibil-\nity. These parenting styles can, therefore, contribute to aca-\ndemic achievement.\nIn addition to these principles, the Family-School and\nCommunity Partnerships Bureau (2011) maintains that\nparental involvement must be systemic, integrated, and sus-\ntainable to have a positive impact on children's schooling.\nThat is, involvement should be systemic in that parental\nengagement is seen by institutions as a core educational goal\ndue to its strong links with school readiness and academic\nachievement. It must also be integrated into education struc-\ntures and processes, including teaching and learning, com-\nmunity involvement, professional development, and issues\nof evaluation and accountability. Finally, the author states\nthat parental engagement should be sustainable in that ade-\nquate resources are provided for the implementation of strat-\negies to increase parental involvement that can positively\naffect students' well-being and academic success.\nAustralia's Department of Education and Training (DET;\n2001) offers a number of suggestions to put in place appro-\npriate processes to ensure that parental involvement can\nresult in benefits for children, the school, and the wider com-\nmunity. These include\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Creating a profile of the families comprising the\nschool community;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Developing 3-year plans for parent involvement;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Identifying which school staff will be responsible for\nfostering parental involvement;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Regularly surveying parents to gauge their level of\nsatisfaction with their involvement and the processes\nthat support it;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Holding training sessions for parents to inform them\nof ways to be involved;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Holding workshops that examine achievement with\nparental involvement and look for ways to increase\nthat involvement in coming semesters/years.\nWhile these ways of enhancing the effectiveness of paren-\ntal involvement have been discussed in terms of their poten-\ntial general benefits, research has also highlighted the links\nbetween parental involvement in children's education and\nthe development of learners' literacy skills.\nParental Involvement and Literacy Skills\nClark (2009) claims that both mothers and fathers have an\nimportant, if somewhat different, influence on the develop-\nment of their children's literacy skills. That is, although both\nmothers and fathers generally interact with their children in\nsimilar ways, Clark states that fathers often use more diffi-\ncult vocabulary with their children such as more abstract\nwords. Moreover, mothers and fathers often employ different\nvocabulary altogether and, therefore, between them, help\nAl-Mahrooqi et al. 3\nexpose children to a wider range of words. For instance,\nmothers often use language to describe emotions while\nfathers are more prone to offer explanations. It is for these\nreasons that the involvement of both parents in their chil-\ndren's schooling can offer a number of benefits to the devel-\nopment of their literacy skills.\nClark (2009) continues that, despite the potential benefits\nassociated with parental involvement as offered above, only\na handful of studies have explicitly examined the link\nbetween this involvement and children's literacy develop-\nment. However, despite this, the author claims that a number\nsuggested that higher levels of parental involvement in their\nchildren's reading, including through spending time reading\nwith them, monitoring, and evaluating their reading, were\nlinked with higher levels of reading development. These\nwere trends that Clark highlighted in relation to the involve-\nment of fathers, although the author notes that children often\nconsider their mothers to be the ones who initially taught\nthem to read.\nClark (2007) maintains that, of all academic skills chil-\ndren develop at school, it is actually reading that is the most\nsensitive to issues of parental involvement. She states that\nparental involvement with reading activities at home has an\nimportant influence on reading achievement, in addition to\nlanguage comprehension, interest, and attitudes toward read-\ning and even on class attentiveness. Parental involvement in\nthis skill can take many forms, including promoting the value\nof reading as a worthwhile and valuable activity while also\nmaking available reading resources including books, maga-\nzines, and newspapers, and reading to their children.\nIn terms of the link between parental involvement and\nchildren's literacy development, the InternationalAssociation\nfor the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA; 2014)\noffers a direct correlation between the level of parental\ninvolvement and student reading achievement. In an investi-\ngation covering more than 50 education systems from around\nthe world, the IEA reports positive relationships between the\nlevel of parental involvement and achievement on the\nProgress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS)\nreading test that was administered to samples of Grade 4 stu-\ndents from around the world. The report features data from\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations of Oman,\nKuwait, the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Interestingly,\nwhile this general trend of increased parental involvement\nbeing associated with higher level reading skills on the\nPIRLS holds true for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and\nQatar, in Oman and Kuwait the results are mixed. That is, in\nboth countries medium levels of parental involvement are\nlinked with better reading test achievement scores than\nhigher levels of parental achievement. In addition, in Kuwait,\nhigher levels of parental involvement are associated with\nlower reading levels.\nClark and Hawkins (2010) identify four main aspects of\nparental involvement that contribute directly to children's\nliteracy development.The first is access to physical resources,\nwith the authors stating that children who have access to\ntheir own books read more often and enjoy reading more\nthan those who do not. Moreover, having access to other\nreading resources, such as newspapers and magazines, was\nalso correlated with higher levels of reading attainment.\nParental encouragement to read was another aspect of\ninvolvement associated with learners' reading enjoyment\nand attainment. Clark and Hawkins state that children who\nget a lot of encouragement to read from their parents tend to\nreport enjoying reading more and also to read more outside\nof class than those who do not. They also hold more positive\nattitudes toward reading and performed better than expected\nfor their age on reading attainment tests. An almost identical\npattern of increased enjoyment, better attitudes, and height-\nened reading attainment was also in evidence in relation to\nchildren who often saw their parents reading.\nThe final aspect of parental involvement in their chil-\ndren's schooling identified by Clark and Hawkins (2010) as\ncontributing to the development of literacy skills is talking\nabout what children are reading. Clark and Hawkins found\nthat young people who talk about what they are reading with\ntheir parents everyday generally enjoy reading much more\nthan those who never discuss this part of their education.\nMoreover, children who never talk about what they are read-\ning with their parents are more likely to believe that reading\nis boring and tend to rarely read outside of the classroom.\nThese children are also more likely to score below the\nexpected level for their ages on reading achievement tests.\nFactors Influencing Parental Involvement\nA number of factors may be related to the level and type of\ninvolvement parents have with their children's education.\nHoover-Dempsey and Sandler (1995) acknowledge that a\nmodel of parental involvement commonly assumed in the lit-\nerature consists of two dominant contributing factors. The\nfirst of these is parent factors, which include socio-\ndemographic variables and other, more dynamic, variables\nincluding parental attitudes, and so on. The second contribut-\ning factor involves school variables, including those status\nvariables that characterize schools and more dynamic vari-\nables including teacher behaviors and so on. Hoover-\nDempsey and Sandler claim that this model, although widely\naccepted, fails to take account of the reasons why parents\nbecome involved in the education of their children and how\nsuch involvement leads to positive educational outcomes.\nIn seeking to address these questions, Hoover-Dempsey\nand Sandler (1995) offer what they describe as a causal and\nspecific model of parental involvement featuring five inter-\nlinked layers. The first layer is \"parental involvement deci-\nsion\" and relates to those variables that influence the parents'\npositive decision to become involved in their children's edu-\ncation. Factors highlighted in the model include parents'\nconstruction of the parental role and their sense of\n4 SAGE Open\nself-efficacy in helping their children succeed--both of\nwhich are informed by such variables as parents'direct expe-\nriences, emotional arousal, and the verbal persuasion they\nencounter. Other important factors here include general\nopportunities and demands for parental involvement as\nexpressed by their children and their children's schools.\nThese factors combine to influence the next layer of the\nmodel: \"parents' choice of involvement forms.\" This is an\narea that is directly affected by a number of variables, such\nas parents' specific skills and knowledge, the demands of\ntheir families and jobs in terms of time and energy, and the\nspecific invitations and demands for involvement from chil-\ndren, schools, and teachers.\nThe parents'choice of forms of involvement, according to\nthe model, then affects the next layer of \"mechanisms\nthrough which parent involvement influences child/student\noutcomes.\" This is influenced by both closed- and open-\nended instruction, the modeling of school-related behaviors\nand attitudes including asking questions about school,\nreviewing homework, communicating with teachers, and\nreinforcing specific aspects of school-related learning. This\nlayer, in turn, influences \"tempering/mediating variables,\"\nwhich include the parents' use of involvement strategies that\nare developmentally appropriate and the \"fit\" between school\nexpectations of parental involvement and parental involve-\nment actions. These mediating variables contribute to the\nfinal layer of Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler's (1995) model:\n\"child/student outcomes.\" These outcomes encompass the\nskills and knowledge that children develop at school due to\ntheir parents' involvement and the sense of efficacy they\nhave for doing well in school.\nClark (2007) offers an adaptation of Hoover-Dempsey and\nSandler's (2005) model of the process of parental involve-\nment. In this model, the three main factors that contribute to\nparental involvement are identified as parents' motivational\nbeliefs, parents' perceptions of invitation for involvement\nfrom others, and parents' perceived life contexts. In relation\nto the first factor, Clark states that \"parents are at the most\nfundamental level motivated to become involved by their\nsense of self-efficacy\" (p. 2), or their belief that their involve-\nment will have a positive impact on their children's academic\nsuccess. Perceptions of involvement relate to the belief that\nthe school, the teachers, and their children have expressed an\ninterest in involving parents in the education process and, in\nthis way, relate to the beliefs of organizations such as the\nFamily-School and Community Partnerships Bureau (2011)\nand DET (2001) that school systems must be in place to make\nparental involvement as smooth, active, and meaningful as\npossible. The final factor offered by Clark as contributing to\nparental involvement is that of perceived life context, which\nrelates to how parents' knowledge and skills, and the input\nthey believe the involvement requires in terms of time and\nenergy, is viewed by parents.\nThe models of parental involvement offered by Hoover-\nabove feature a number of variables that may be influential\nin determining the nature and level of involvement parents\nchoose to have in their children's education. With direct ref-\nerence to parental involvement and the development of lit-\neducational systems examined around the world, those\nschools that experienced higher rates of parental involve-\nment tended to have more students with parents who had a\nuniversity-level education, thereby suggesting a link between\ninvolvement and socio-educational status. Interestingly, this\nlevel of correlation holds true for the Arab Gulf nations and\nemirates of Dubai and Saudi Arabia though becomes more\nconfused when examined in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, and Oman.\nClark (2009) examines the potential link between parental\ninvolvement and socio-economic status and notes that a\nnumber of researchers have suggested there is a positive link\nbetween children's levels of literacy development and their\nfather's work literacy practices. Although the initial supposi-\ntion here may be that children whose fathers engage in more\nliteracy practices at work are more involved in their chil-\ndren's education and hence can exert more of a positive\ninfluence in the area, Clark maintains that it may not be the\nuse of literacy skills at work by fathers itself that affects the\nliteracy development of children, but rather \"the way in\nwhich job-related literacy impacted on the home literacy\nenvironment where children's development was being fos-\ntered that made a difference\" (p. 13). In either case, this\nresearch implies that those fathers who have white-collar\njobs (and hence are often middle class and/or upwardly\nmobile) tend to have children with better developed literacy\nskills hence suggesting a link between socio-economic status\nand the development of these skills.\nClark (2007) also highlights how parental involvement is\nperhaps most important for those children whose mothers\nhave less education. The author offers research conducted for\nthe Harvard Family Research Project, which reported that\nincreases in family involvement were associated with higher\nlevels of literacy achievement for families from low socio-\neconomic backgrounds and that such involvement has the\ngreatest impact on children who were deemed as \"at risk\" of\neducational failure. Moreover, families who were initially\nuninvolved with their children's schooling and then become\nmore involved exerted a positive influence on their chil-\ndren's literacy development. Finally, the research project\nclaims that this involvement did not have to necessarily be\nextensive to have a positive influence on literacy develop-\nment, with meaningful improvement noted for even one or\ntwo additional involvement activities each year.\nMoon and Ivins's (2004) examination of barriers to paren-\ntal involvement in children's education in the United\nKingdom reported the influence of the variables of gender,\nwork situation, school level, and perceived responsibility for\ntheir child's education. In particular, the authors noted that\nwomen were more likely to be involved in their children's\neducation with men less likely to help with homework and to\nAl-Mahrooqi et al. 5\nbe involved in activities such as fund-raising, school trips,\nand so on. Parents who worked part-time or who were\nemployed in a school were also more likely to be involved,\nwhile parents of children in primary schools and parents or\ncarers who believed that responsibility for their children's\neducation partially or largely lies with them reported higher\nlevels of parental involvement. In terms of socio-economic\nstatus, however, Moon and Ivins report that parents in house-\nholds where the primary breadwinner worked in unskilled\nmanual labor were slightly more likely to claim that they felt\nvery involved in their children's education than other social\nclasses. However, despite these claims, the authors note that\nparents in such households were only likely to participate\nmore in helping with dinner duties and in school trips than\nparents in other socio-economic groups.\nParental Involvement, Literacy, and Arab Learners\nAlthough the studies cited above offer a number of potential\nbenefits to, and variables influencing, the level of parental\ninvolvement in children's schooling, Al-Barwani, Albeely,\nand Al-Suleimani (2012) note that much of the research is\nfocused on Western societies which have different expecta-\ntions about children's levels of independence and of the\ninvolvement of families in the decisions that affect their chil-\ndren. For these reasons, it may be problematic to apply find-\nings from studies conducted on Western learners to Arab\ncountries, as suggested by the somewhat contradictory\nresults related to Oman and certain other Gulf nations\nreported in the IEA (2014) research above.\nMoosa, Karabenick, and Adams (2001) took one step\ntoward addressing the relative dearth of topic-based research\non Arab learners by examining teachers' perceptions of Arab\nparental involvement in elementary schools in the United\nStates. The authors report a widely held belief among teach-\ners that Arab parents in the United States tend not to be\ninvolved in their children's education. This is a result which\nparticipants believed may be due to matters of culture and\ntradition. However, despite these beliefs among teachers, a\nnumber of participants also noted the barriers that these par-\nents experienced toward higher levels of involvement,\nincluding a lack of confidence with their English language\nskills, and family demands on mothers including looking\nafter younger children at home. Finally, a number of teachers\nbelieved that Arab parents considered the school as solely\nresponsible for their children's education and that they were,\nsubsequently, less likely to participate.\nHowever, despite these beliefs held by teachers, Moosa\netal. (2001) note that most Arab parents reported regularly\nattending parent\u00adteacher conferences and almost all of the\nArab mothers claimed they would be willing to participate in\ntheir children's education if requested to do so. The authors\nclaim that this mismatch of perceptions between teachers\nand Arab parents in the United States may be due to a lack of\nteachers' cultural knowledge about appropriate forms of\ncommunication for interacting with Arab families. Moosa\netal. offer the example of mothers who agree to participate\nin a school activity when directly requested out of politeness\nthough who fail to attend and are then characterized as disin-\nterested. For these reasons, the authors state that it is neces-\nsary for teachers of Arab students in English as a second\nlanguage (ESL) contexts to experience professional enrich-\nment opportunities to develop culturally relevant skills.\nMoving away from ESL contexts to the situation in Oman,\nAl-Barwani etal. (2012) highlight how, even as Arab coun-\ntries experience rapid changes in the face of globalization,\nfamilies in the region largely remain paternalistic and\nextended families continue to be involved in decisions\nregarding children. For these reasons, Al-Barwani etal. state\nthat parental involvement, at least at the elementary school\nlevel, enjoys a long tradition in Oman, with open channels of\neducation existing between schools and families on issues of\nbehavior, academic progress, and so on. The authors sought\nto examine whether this is also the case in higher education\ninstitutions. In their examination of parents' attitudes toward\ninvolvement in higher education, the authors reported that\nOmani parents believed they continued to play a major role\nin their children's education, with this being expressed\nthrough financial and moral support, keeping track of aca-\ndemic progress, communicating with teachers, helping solve\nacademic and social problems, and even helping select their\nchildren's colleges and specializations. Moreover, despite\nthe potential importance of the variables offered above in\nmediating levels of involvement, Al-Barwani etal. reported\nthat parents' gender, level of educational attainment, the\nnumber of children they have, socio-economic status, and\neducation levels did not affect their beliefs about the impor-\ntance of involvement.\nStill within Oman but focusing on kindergarten, rather\nthan tertiary-level, learners, Al-Qaryouti and Kilani (2013)\nexamine the level of participation of 314 Omani parents in\nterms of the following involvement practices: availability of\nmaterials, home activities, parents' attitudes, and visits to\ntheir children's classes. The authors note that studies con-\nducted on Arab learners, such as those by Abdulrahman\nthe learners' families' cultural background and/or socio-\neconomic status were associated with children's readiness to\nread and write. After acknowledging this link, Al-Qaryouti\nand Kilani explored whether the level of parental support for\nchildren's reading and writing was associated with parents'\neducational and economic levels, gender, birth order, and\nchild's level in the kindergarten.\nFindings indicate that there is a link between parents'edu-\ncational levels in three of the four participation practices fea-\ntured, with the only exception being in the number of visits\nto the kindergarten. In terms of socio-economic status, the\nresearchers report that parents with middle, as opposed to\nlow or high, income levels tended to more enthusiastic about\nliteracy practices and hence provided more stimulation for\n6 SAGE Open\nthe development of their children's literacy skills. Gender\nand birth order, however, were not found to be related to par-\nents' levels of involvement in the four practices. Finally, the\nauthors note that, as children progress through kindergarten\nlevels, parents tended to express greater interest in participat-\ning in the development of their emergent literacy skills.\nAl-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi (2014) examine the nature of\nOmani parents' involvement in their children's education in a\nstudy of 40 Omani parents.After acknowledging the potential\nimpact of social reasons that may hinder such involvement--\nsuch as family size, number of adults, and parents' levels of\neducation, cultural factors associated with parents'and teach-\ners'ideas of appropriate forms of participation, and economic\nfactors associated with the abilities of both schools and par-\nents to encourage parental involvement--the authors sought\nto examine the ways in which Omani parents are involved in\ntheir children's education, their attitudes toward family\ninvolvement and their effect on their children's academic per-\nformance, and the reasons Omani parents highlight as poten-\ntially hindering participation.\nAl-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi (2014) claim that most\nOmani parents believe participation in their children's school-\ning to almost exclusively involve at-home activities, such as\nhelping with homework and discussing issues related to\nschool. However, the authors report that Omani parents usu-\nally do not believe that they should be involved in school-\nrelated activities, either because they thought teachers to be\ncompetent and to not need any input, or because they do not\nview school-related activities as important. However, despite\nthe somewhat limited nature of this involvement, participants\ndid, nonetheless, maintain that parental involvement contrib-\nutes positively to the academic performance of their children\nand that higher levels of involvement were associated with\ngreater motivation among learners and better behavior.\nAlthough these findings largely follow those offered in the\nliterature from both theArab world and beyond, the authors note\nthat some of the barriers to parental involvement highlighted\nabove are not applicable to the Omani context. That is,\nAl-Harrasi andAl-Mahrooqi's (2014) findings suggest, \"Parents\nhere do not consider such social reasons as having big families,\nhaving many children, not feeling qualified to offer help, or not\nhaving enough time as hindrances to their involvement\"\n(p. 281). In addition, parents believed that, although Omani\nteachers are highly competent, they retained the right to ques-\ntion teachers and administrators about educational decisions.\nThey also maintained that their jobs did not affect their level of\ninvolvement in their children's education, and that Omani\nschools have the processes in place to encourage involvement.\nMethod\nResearch Questions\nWhile the above research highlights the nature and type of\nparental involvement in their children's education, in addition\nto the potential benefit of increased levels of involvement, as\nof yet very little research has been conducted that exclusively\nfocuses on parental involvement in their children's education\nin English. Although the studies cited above, focusing on the\nlink between parental involvement and literacy, suggest that\nhigher levels of involvement are most likely associated with\nthe development of learners English language skills, this is a\nsupposition that is yet to be explored within the Omani con-\ntext. Moreover, results relating to Arab and/or Omani partici-\npants offered above often report contradictory findings or\nresults that would not be suggested from the research from the\nWestern world. For these reasons, the current research sought\nto explore the link between Omani parental involvement in\ntheir children's school-based English language education by\nexamining the following questions:\nResearch Question 1: What are the potential benefits of\nparental involvement in their children's English language\neducation according to Omani parents?\nResearch Question 2: What activities related to their\nchildren's English language education do Omani parents\nbelieve they should be involved in?\nResearch Question 3: Do Omani parents believe any\nobstacles exist to parental involvement?\nResearch Question 4: How often are Omani parents\ninvolved in their children's English language education?\nQuestionnaire\nTo explore this issue, two sections from a questionnaire\ninquiring into parental attitudes toward English in Oman--\nitself part of a nationwide investigation into challenges asso-\nciated with learning English in the country--were analyzed.\nThe first of these sections related to participants' attitudes\nabout parental involvement in their children's English learn-\ning. This section was divided into five parts: benefits of\ninvolvement, parent involvement activities, personal reasons\nfor non-involvement, teacher-related reasons for non-\ninvolvement, and school/administration's reasons for non-\ninvolvement. The second section explored the frequency\nwith which parents engaged in eight activities related to their\nchildren's English language learning.\nSample\nThe questionnaires were administered to 391 parents of stu-\ndents in the Omani public school system.

Interpretations of item and category means are\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\nOverall means for the five questionnaire categories from\nthis part of the questionnaire are\nBenefits of involvement--1.50;\nParent involvement activities--1.51;\nTeacher-related reasons for non-involvement--3.00;\nPersonal reasons for non-involvement--3.15;\nSchool/administration reasons for non-involvement--3.27.\nTable 1 features the first response category from this part\nof the questionnaire: benefits of involvement (M = 1.50).\nParents strongly agreed with each of the four items relating\nto the potential benefit of parental involvement in their chil-\ndren's schooling. The two items that received the highest lev-\nels of agreement were \"parental involvement in children's\nschool results in higher student academic performance\" and\n\"parental involvement helps in solving students' academic\nand educational problems promptly and effectively.\" Both\nthese items recorded means of 1.45. Participants also strongly\nagreed that \"students whose parents are involved at their\nschool are better behaved in classes than those whose parents\nare not involved\" (M = 1.54) and that \"students whose par-\nents are involved in their school are more motivated to learn\"\nClosely linked with this apparent awareness of the bene-\nfits of parental involvement, participants also strongly agreed\nwith each of the items related to involvement activities\n(M = 1.51; see Table 2). Respondents strongly agreed that\nparents should \"go to school even when their children are not\nin trouble\" (M = 1.30). They also maintained that they should\n\"discuss issues related to school with their children at home\"\n(M = 1.33) and \"supervise their children when doing their\nhomework\" (M = 1.44). While they also stated strong levels\nof agreement with the belief that \"Parents should collaborate\nwith teachers in preparing teaching materials\" (M = 1.70),\nthe response mean for the item, \"Parents should get involved\nin school-related activities\" (M = 1.79), was on the border\nbetween agree and strongly agree.\nIn relation to factors that may hinder parental involvement\nin their children's schooling, Table 3 indicates that parents\nremained neutral about all items associated with whether\nteacher-related factors may contribute to their non-involvement\n(M = 2.98). That is, participants neither agreed nor disagreed\nwith the statements, \"I think that secondary school teachers'\nheavy schedules don't give them time to meet with parents\"\n(M = 2.67) and \"Teachers at my children's schools are not\ntrained well to deal with parents\" (M = 2.87). They were also\nneutral in response to items about whether their involvement\nwas considered valuable and appropriate by teachers: \"I do\n8 SAGE Open\nnot feel that teachers appreciate my involvement\" (M = 3.01)\nand \"I do not think that I should question teachers about their\nteaching\" (M = 3.09). Finally, participants were neutral about\nwhether \"teachers know best about their students so I do not\nneed to be involved\" (M = 3.30).\nTable 4 indicates that parents were largely neutral about\nthe influence of personal reasons on non-involvement (M =\n3.15). In fact, of the 13 items associated with this category,\n11 received response means placing them within the neutral\nresponse range, while participants only stated disagreement\nto two items. That is, parents did not believe that their\nresponsibilities negatively affected their involvement in their\nchildren's schooling, with neutral responses to \"I have so\nmany responsibilities which prevent me from getting\ninvolved with my children's education\" (M = 2.85) and \"I do\nnot discuss school issues with my children because I do not\nhave enough time\" (M = 3.25). With specific reference to\nfamily responsibilities, participants were neutral in response\nto the statements that they do \"not get involved enough at my\nchildren's schools because I have a big family to take care\nof\" (M = 2.99) and \"do not help my children much with their\nhomework because I have many children\" (M = 3.29). They\nalso did not see work as interfering with their involvement in\ntheir children's schooling with neutral responses to the fol-\nlowing items: \"I work for long hours so I do not have time to\nvisit my children's schools\" (M = 2.95) and \"I feel so\nexhausted after work that I do not help my children with their\nhomework\" (M = 3.18). The school level and school regula-\ntions were also not identified by participants as having an\ninfluence on their level of involvement, with neutral means\nrecorded for the following items: \"I only get involved at ele-\nmentary schools\" (M = 2.88) and \"I do not get involved much\nwith my children's schools because I do not understand the\nschool system and rules\" (M = 3.06). Participants also\nremained neutral about whether they do not help their \"chil-\ndren with their homework because I want them to be inde-\npendent\" (M = 2.91), while also being neutral about whether\ntheir children's learning was the sole responsibility of teach-\ners: \"I do not help my children much with their homework\nbecause I do not feel qualified enough to do so\" (M = 3.24)\nand \"I believe that teachers are the only ones responsible for\ntheir students' academic performance\" (M = 3.32). In fact,\nthe only items parents disagreed with from this part of the\nquestionnaire related to the lack of importance of parental\ninvolvement. That is, they disagreed with the items, \"I do not\nget involved in my children's schools because I do not think\nthat will make a difference\" (M = 3.40) and \"I do not believe\nthat parental involvement in school matters is important\"\nTable 1.

The level of disagreement expressed here appears\nto confirm trends reported in the previous parts of the\nquestionnaire.\nTable 5 features reasons for parental involvement asso-\nciated with school/administration reasons (M = 3.27).\nParticipants were neutral about two of the four items from\nthis category. These were \"My children's school is not\nequipped with the necessary programs to promote parental\ninvolvement\" (M = 2.91) and \"Administrators at my chil-\ndren's schools do not encourage parental involvement\"\n(M = 3.27). They stated disagreement with the remaining\nitems regarding the influence of distance and class size on\ntheir involvement: \"My children's school is too far for me\nto visit often\" (M = 3.40) and \"My children's school has big\nstudent numbers, so I do not like to go there\" (M = 3.48).\nThe final questionnaire section asked participants to indi-\ncate how frequently they were involved in their children's\nEnglish studies. Item means for this part of the questionnaire\nwere interpreted as\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\n\u00b7\nTable 6 indicates that parents were not always engaged in\nany of the eight activities featured on this part of the ques-\ntionnaire and were only often involved in one.

Participants stated that they were also\nsometimes involved in three specific activities related to\ntheir children's English learning. These were \"I supervise my\nchildren when doing their English homework\" (M = 3.19), \"I\nencourage my children to use and practice their English\naround the house and beyond the classroom\" (M = 3.05), and\n\"I meet with the English teacher to inquire about my\nTable 4.

In doing so, it explored the following\nresearch questions.\nResearch Question 1: What are the potential benefits of\nparental involvement in their children's education accord-\ning to Omani parents?\nParticipants highlighted a number of potential benefits of\ninvolvement in their children's schooling. They believed that\ntheir involvement not only contributed toward higher levels\nof academic achievement for their children, but also allowed\nthem to help solve any academic and educational problems\nthat their children may face. In this way, participants here\nshowed similarities in attitudes to the parents of Omani ter-\ntiary students reported by Al-Qaryouti and Kilani (2013).\nParticipants also highlighted their belief that parental\ninvolvement is associated with better behavior among their\nchildren at school and higher levels of motivation to learn. In\nthis way, Omani parents displayed an awareness of some of\nthe academic, psychological, and social benefits of increased\nlevels of parental involvement as highlighted by scholars\nincluding Al-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi (2014), Berthelsen\n(2004). Moreover, these findings also lend support to\nAl-Barwani etal.'s (2012) contention that parental involve-\nment in children's education is widely practiced in Oman and\nenjoys a long tradition.\nResearch Question 2: What activities related to their\nchildren's English language education do Omani parents\nbelieve they should be involved in?\nThe Omani parents featured in this research strongly\nbelieved that they should be involved in a number of activi-\nties associated with their children's schooling, or what\nHoover-Dempsey and Sandler (1995) describe as choice of\ninvolvement forms. These included the school-related activi-\nties of making visits to their children's school and getting\ninvolved in other school-related activities including prepar-\ning materials for use at school. Moreover, participants stated\nthat at home they should discuss school matters with their\nchildren while also supervising homework. Interestingly,\nAl-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi (2014) maintain that parents in\nOman tend to limit their involvement in their children's edu-\ncation to home activities, such as the last two involvement\nactivities listed here. However, the authors continue, these\nparents tend to be more reluctant to actually attend their chil-\ndren's school to assist with activities. This is a belief that was\nnot supported by the first questionnaire section, although the\nrelative infrequency of parental involvement activities, at\nleast as they relate to English studies, reported in the final\npart of the questionnaire may lend some support to this\nsupposition.\nResearch Question 3: Do Omani parents believe any\nobstacles exist to parental involvement?\nThe current research explored three main areas as poten-\ntially contributing to the non-involvement of Omani parents:\nteacher-related factors, personal reasons, and school/admin-\nistration reasons. Omani parents' responses indicated that\nthey did not consider any of these factors to negatively affect\ntheir levels of involvement in their children's schooling. For\ninstance, they were neutral about whether teachers' heavy\nworkloads and lack of training in dealing with parents had an\nimpact upon their involvement, while also being unsure\nabout whether they had the right to question their children's\nTable 6. Frequency of Parental Involvement in Children's English\nStudies.\nn M SD\nI encourage my children\nto do their best in\nlearning English.\nI supervise my children\nwhen doing their English\nhomework.\nI am involved in my\nchildren's English\nstudies.\nI encourage my children\nto use and practice\ntheir English around the\nhouse and beyond the\nclassroom.\nI meet with the English\nteacher to inquire about\nmy children's progress.\nI have paid for my child/\nchildren to enroll in a\nprivate institution to\nlearn English.\nI participate in school\nactivities that involve\nthe use of English to\nmotivate my children to\npractice the language.\nI have hired a private\ntutor to teach my\nchildren English.\nAl-Mahrooqi et al. 11\nteachers' decisions because \"teachers know best.\" The level\nof neutrality could be argued to offer a small amount of sup-\nport for Al-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi's (2014) findings that,\nalthough Omani parents acknowledge that teachers are gen-\nerally competent and well-trained, they still believe they\nhave the right to question teacher decisions, even though a\nlack of firm agreement or disagreement here leaves this mat-\nter open to debate.\nParent participants also did not believe that either their\nwork- or family-related responsibilities decreased their level\nof involvement in their children's schools. In findings that\nmay lend support for Al-Harrasi and Al-Mahrooqi's (2014)\nresearch, results here suggest that parents were neutral about\nwhether having a big family had any influence on their level\nof involvement. Moreover, they also did not identify work-\ning long hours and feeling exhausted from their work as\nimportant factors. Personal reasons related to the school\nitself, such as its distance from home and the school level,\nwere also not considered important factors in non-involve-\nment by participants. Respondents, moreover, did not agree\nthat they felt unqualified to be involved and, in fact, stated\ndisagreement with the idea that only teachers are responsible\nfor their children's education and that their involvement\nwould not make a difference. This, again, is a finding that\nwas suggested by Al-Barwani etal.'s (2012) belief that the\ntraditional patriarchal nature of Omani families supports the\ninput of the extended family in all important matters relating\nto their children.\nFactors related more specifically to school and school\nadministration were also not considered to have an important\ninfluence on parental involvement. That is, parents were neu-\ntral about whether their children's schools had the necessary\nprograms to facilitate their involvement and also about\nwhether school administrators encouraged such engagement.\nDET (2001) highlights the importance of schools creating\nstructures and training staff to enable parents to participate in\nan effective manner, so the neutral response range here may\nsuggest that Omani schools could put more systems in place\nto facilitate parental involvement. This is a practice that is\nstrongly recommended by Family-School and Community\nPartnerships Bureau (2011) to positively affect students'\nwell-being and academic success.\nResearch Question 4: How often are Omani parents\ninvolved in their children's English language education?\nDespite parents' awareness of the importance of parental\ninvolvement in their children's schooling and their belief that\nvery few personal, teacher- or school-administration-related\nbarriers exist to their involvement in their children's formal\nschooling, participants claimed to only be often involved in\none activity related to their children's English language\nlearning: encouraging them to do their best with English.\nMoreover, participants stated that they were only sometimes\ninvolved in their children's English studies, despite the fact\nthat 56.5% of participants claimed to always be involved in\ntheir children's general education.\nIn terms of their English studies, parents stated that they\noccasionally supervised their children's homework, encour-\naged them to use English at home, and met with their chil-\ndren's English teachers to discuss their academic progress.\nInterestingly, two of these three involvement activities are\nrelated to the home, which tends to support Al-Harrasi and\nAl-Mahrooqi's (2014) supposition that most Omani parents\nlimit their participant to home-based activities, despite rec-\nognizing the importance of school-based activities as high-\nlighted above. Moreover, Omani parents here claimed that\nthey were rarely involved in their school activities related to\nEnglish, and that they were not likely to find a private English\ntutor for their children. This former finding, in particular,\nmay be associated with parents' neutral attitudes as to\nwhether the school and its teachers are welcoming of their\nparticipation in such activities, and about whether the struc-\ntures are in place to encourage their participation.\nConclusion\nThe current study sought to examine attitudes toward, and\npractices associated with, Omani parents' involvement in\ntheir children's education with a specific focus on those prac-\ntices related to English language learning. Results here indi-\ncate that Omani parents are generally aware of the importance\nof their involvement on their children's academic, social, and\neven psychological development. Moreover, they believe\nthat parents should be involved in a number of home- and\nschool-based activities, such as visiting their children's\nschools even when their children are not in trouble and being\nactively involved in other school activities, even though their\nactual level of involvement in their children's English lan-\nguage studies was somewhat limited. Participants tended to\nbe neutral about the nature of any personal, teacher, school,\nor administration obstacles to their involvement in their chil-\ndren's education, although the implication exists that schools\ncould do more to create and staff systems that actively seek\nto encourage their participation, at least as far as English lan-\nguage classes are concerned. The establishment of these sys-\ntems in line with the advice of DET (2001) could function to\ninform parents about the benefits of increased levels of par-\nticipation and appropriate channels for such participation. In\nthis way, parents who may be reluctant to participate can see\nthat their input is valued, hence increasing their level of self-\nefficacy in contributing to their children's development of\nEnglish language as highlighted by Emerson etal. (2012).\nHence, parental involvement at the school level can be sys-\ntemic, integrated, and sustainable, as recommended by the\nFamily-School and Community Partnerships Bureau (2011).\nWith more specific reference to English, the creation of\nhigher levels of dialogue between schools, parents, and the\nwider community is one way to overcome the often-reported\nlimitations of English language learning within Oman. This\nis an important goal of educational reforms in the country,\nand the springboard for the current nationwide investigation\non which this current research is based, and is one that could\nbenefit from the establishment of clearer pathways for Omani\nparental involvement in their children's English studies.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work\nwas supported by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos's Annual Trust Fund\nfor Strategic Research, Oman, under Grant SR/ART/ENGL/12/01).\nReferences\nAbdurrahman, H.
