    "abstract": "Abstract: The evolution of human cooperation remains a puzzle because cooperation persists\neven in conditions that rule out mainstream explanations. We present a novel solution that\nlinks two recent theories. First, Johnson & Kruger (2004) suggested that ancestral\ncooperation was promoted because norm violations were deterred by the threat of\nsupernatural punishment. However, this only works if individuals attribute negative life\nevents (or a prospective afterlife) as intentionally caused by supernatural agents. A\ncomplementary cognitive mechanism is therefore required. Recently, Bering and Shackelford\n(2004) suggested precisely this. The evolution of \"theory of mind\" and, specifically, the\n\"intentionality system\" (a cognitive system devoted to making inferences about the epistemic\ncontents and intentions of other minds), strongly favoured: (1) the selection of human\npsychological traits for monitoring and controlling the flow of social information within\ngroups; and (2) attributions of life events to supernatural agency. We argue that natural\nselection favoured such attributions because, in a cognitively sophisticated social\nenvironment, a fear of supernatural punishment steered individuals away from costly social\ntransgressions resulting from unrestrained, evolutionarily ancestral, selfish interest (acts\nwhich would rapidly become known to others, and thereby incur an increased probability and\nseverity of punishment by group members). As long as the net costs of selfish actions from\nreal-world punishment by group members exceeded the net costs of lost opportunities from\nself-imposed norm abiding, then god-fearing individuals would outcompete non-believers.\n",

Sometimes\ncooperation results in mutual payoffs to all actors involved, and can therefore be easily\nunderstood as each pursuing their own selfish interest. However, other instances of\ncooperation are more surprising, because individuals help others despite incurring a cost in\ndoing so. In the last half century, a number of theories have come to understand such\nbehaviour as the result of motives that, while they may be apparently altruistic at first glance,\nultimately serve selfish genetic interests (they incur an immediate cost, but result in a net gain\nto inclusive fitness overall, Dawkins 1986). The four dominant theories are: \"Kin-selection,\"\nin which cooperation is genetically rewarded by favouring kin (Hamilton 1964); \"reciprocal\naltruism,\" in which altruistic acts are returned later on (Trivers 1971); \"indirect reciprocity,\"\nin which one's reputation for cooperation is rewarded indirectly through the favour of third-\nparty observers (Alexander 1987; Nowak and Sigmund 1998); and \"costly signalling,\" in\nwhich generosity serves as an advertisement of high fitness to would be mates or allies\n(Gintis et al. 2001; Zahavi 1995). Formerly puzzling examples of animal cooperation have\nnow been routinely explained in terms of these theories (for a review, see Dugatkin 1997).\nBy contrast, cooperation among humans is still not understood. Although people do\nincrease cooperation when kin-selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity, and costly\nsignalling are at stake, we also continue to cooperate when they are not (Fehr and\nFischbacher 2003; Gintis 2003). In the words of two leading scholars, \"people frequently\ncooperate with genetically unrelated strangers, often in large groups, with people they will\nnever meet again, and when reputation gains are small or absent,\" leaving human cooperation\nas an \"evolutionary puzzle\" (Fehr and G\u00e4chter 2002, p.137). The key evidence for such\npuzzling behaviour comes from controlled laboratory studies demonstrating that people\ncooperate even when any possible self-interested payoffs via existing theories are carefully\neliminated one by one. The result is that, when asked to play simple games that represent\nevery-day social dilemmas, people from both modern and pre-industrial societies around the\nglobe cooperate to a greater extent than can be accounted for by traditional theory \u00ad a\nphenomenon dubbed \"strong reciprocity\" (Fehr and Fischbacher 2003; Henrich et al. 2004).\nSo far, no one has come up with a consensus explanation for this phenomenon. A number of\nscholars have invoked group selection as a possible explanation (Boyd et al. 2003; Gintis\n2000). Another explanation may be that our psychology simply fails to optimise behaviour in\nevolutionarily novel circumstances (such as laboratory experiments or big cities), and better\nreflects the constraints of the environment in which we evolved, where we lived in small\ngroups of extended kin, few strangers, strong hierarchies and lasting reputations (Barkow et\nnew approach. We suggest that religious beliefs, specifically the moralizing and sanctioning\nbehaviour they generate, may serve as a common origin for human cooperation.\nHand of God, Mind of Man\nReligion as a solution to the puzzle\nIt would be incredible to suggest that religion has nothing to do with cooperation \u00ad\neither in ancient or modern societies. Anthropologists have long noted such links, and over\nthe years have both championed and criticized functionalist accounts of religion's apparently\nscientific progress on the topic reached a \"theoretical impasse\" until the advent of approaches\nthat explicitly couched the benefits of religion in terms of natural selection (simply observing\npossible benefits ignored the problem of how the prerequisite costly beliefs initiated, and why\ncheats did not thrive, Sosis and Alcorta 2003). The new evolutionary approach has given rise\nto a number of theories arguing that religion was a key promoter of within-group cooperation\nWilson 2002), but this work remains totally absent from the literature on \"strong reciprocity\"\nIn fact, proponents of strong reciprocity have specifically denied any link between\ncooperation and religion (e.g. Fehr and Gachter 2003), despite mounting empirical evidence\nsupporting such an intuitive link. For example, Richard Sosis has shown that, among a large\nsample of 19th century communes, religious groups with more costly rituals out-survived\nsecular groups and religious groups with fewer rituals (Sosis and Bressler 2003). Among\nIsraeli kibbutzim, groups with more religious rituals also demonstrated higher levels of\ncooperation than secular groups and religious groups with fewer rituals (Sosis and Ruffle\n2003), which may explain why religious kibbutzim are economically successful while secular\nones have faced bankruptcy (Fishman and Goldschmidt 1990). There is also evidence that\nreligion tends to promote cooperation in a broad range of historical and pre-industrial\nsocieties (Johnson 2005; Wilson 2002). That religious beliefs are associated with higher\nlevels of within-group cooperation is not in doubt. What remains intriguing is why.\nA New Theory\nWe outline a precise, proximate cognitive mechanism that suggests it is the expectation\nand fear of supernatural punishment that serves to promote cooperation. We also argue that\nthis mechanism evolved via individual selection (any group selection effects, though they are\nnot necessary, would help drive the system). The theory builds on two recent and\ncomplementary ideas: (1) supernatural punishment as a positive impact on cooperation\n(Johnson and Kruger 2004); and (2) human cognition as an evolutionarily novel canvas for\nthe workings of natural selection (Bering and Shackelford 2004).\nSupernatural punishment and cooperation\nIt is increasingly accepted that punishment is key to ensuring cooperation (Andreoni\nTrivers 1971). However, the act of punishing cheats entails costs, so punishment itself\nrepresents a \"second-order\" public good (Hackathorn 1989; Yamagishi 1986). The original\npuzzle of cooperation therefore just re-appears at a new level: \"second-order\" cheats may\ncooperate towards the public good, but then defect from contributing to punishment. So how\nis cooperation enforced? Four solutions to this conundrum have emerged in the literature.\nThree are deemed unsatisfactory (Henrich and Boyd 2001, p. 80), and the fourth is contested:\n(1) punishment is administered by an external institution (however, while this may be true in\nwestern societies today, cooperation evolved long before modern institutions existed, and is\nevident even in remote societies that are not subject to state regulations); (2) punishment is\nHand of God, Mind of Man\nnot costly after all (however, administering punishment must incur some cost, however small,\nof time and/or effort which, combined with the risk of reprisals from punished individuals or\ntheir allies, simply returns us to the original dilemma); (3) both regular defectors and those\nwho refuse to punish are punished (however, as Henrich and Boyd put it: \"Do people really\npunish people who fail to punish other non-punishers, and do people punish people who fail\nto punish people, who fail to punish non-punishers of defectors and so on, ad infinitum?\");\n(4) Some fraction of people altruistically punish defectors for the good of the group (Fehr and\nG\u00e4chter 2002; Fehr and Fischbacher 2003), and this trait is propagated by group selection\n(however, this requires that humans are genuinely altruistic, a claim that is problematic for a\nnumber of reasons, see Burnham and Johnson 2005; Johnson et al. 2003). The puzzle\ntherefore remains: Without institutions of law and order, and without a good incentive for\npeople to punish each other, how could early human societies establish cooperation with a\ncredible deterrent threat against cheats?\nWe believe solution 1 is discounted too readily. Although most legal and law\nenforcement institutions are indeed modern inventions, Henrich and Boyd (2001) neglect\nanother \"external\" category of norm setting and enforcement that reaches as far back as we\ncan see into human history \u00ad religion.\nJohnson and Kruger (2004) argued that, over our evolutionary history, individuals\nwould be dissuaded from free-riding if they feared supernatural retribution as a consequence\nof their actions. Religious codes, taboos and mythology provided the \"laws\" \u00ad the rights and\nwrongs which defined the norms of conduct promoting, among other things, cooperation.\nThese norms were enforced by the threat of supernatural punishment, either in the present\nand/or in the afterlife (commonly endorsed by folklore, explanations for other people's\nmisfortune, and supernaturally sanctioned worldly punishment by real group members). If\nsupernatural punishment is held as a belief, then this threat becomes a deterrent in reality, so\nthe mechanism can work regardless of whether the threat is genuine or not (following\nThomas' dictum: \"If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences\"\nCooperation enforced by the threat of supernatural punishment has four major\nselective advantages that evade the classic public goods problems troubling current\ntheoretical work: First, there is no second-order free rider problem (supernatural agents are\nenvisioned as administering the punishing). Second, since other group members do not have\nto be vigilantes, they do not risk reprisals that could undermine future cooperation. Third,\n(believing) defectors can expect to be automatically caught (the idea is encapsulated in Matt.\n5:28: \"whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her\nalready in his heart\"). Fourth, (believing) defectors can expect to be automatically punished\n(the act itself triggers the punishment).\nConsiderable ethnographic evidence suggests that the threat of supernatural\npunishment for norm transgressions exerts a powerful effect on people's behaviour \u00ad\nbelievers literally alter their everyday decisions in order to avoid supernatural retribution (see\nexamples in Bering and Johnson 2005; Boyer 2001). Not only is supernatural punishment\ncommonly feared in diverse cultures around the world, both ancient and modern, it is also\ncommonly linked to taboos concerning life or death collective action problems, such as\nscarce resources, sexual access, food sharing, hunting, divisions of labour, defence, or\nSupernatural punishment may come from any mix of gods, dead ancestors, witches or\nsorcerers. One or more feature prominently in hunter-gatherer societies, and all are\nDead ancestors are commonly offered gifts and attention specifically to avoid their retribution\n(Bonsu and Belk 2003). In Medieval Europe concerns for the dead were so prevalent in the\nHand of God, Mind of Man\nconduct of daily life that one historian treated them as a separate age group (Bering\nForthcoming). In ancient Hawaii, the \"souls\" of the dead (akua), once unconstrained from\nbodily limitations and senses, could be in several places at one time, know the thoughts of\nothers, and were in constant interaction with the living (Dudley 2003). There are some\ncultures that are apparently not particularly concerned about supernatural punishment, such as\nthe Amazonian Yanomamo whose spirit of judgment after death can be lied to about one's\nwordly conduct because he is stupid (Chagnon 1997). Nevertheless, such cases appear to be\nexceptions to an otherwise widespread significance of supernatural punishment to cultures\nacross the globe and across history.\nThe significance of supernatural punishment is common to modern religions as well.\nChristians who act contrary to God's will expect divine retribution either immediately by\nsanctions (e.g. struck down with an affliction or some other misfortune), or later, in hell.\nEven if they don't believe that, they commonly attribute positive and negative life events to\ntheir conduct before God. Either way, \"it is plain from the bible that sin will be punished\"\n(Harrison et al. 1960, p. 196). Supernatural punishment is also a central theme in Islam,\nwhere salvation depends on \"human effort as well as God's mercy in following the Qur'an's\nEast Asian and Indian religious traditions, as well as in ethnographic evidence on the world's\nfar more numerous and diverse pre-industrial and historic cultures (for some examples and\nevidence, see Bering and Johnson 2005; Bering Forthcoming; Boyer 2001; Johnson and\nWhy punishment is more important than reward\nIt may seem odd to focus on punishment, because most religions also offer the\nprospect of rewards for good behaviour (in fact many people, religious or not, see positive\nevents as felicitous signs of supernatural forces \u00ad e.g., \"it was meant to be\" (Bering 2002;\nGilbert et al. 2000)). Such beliefs would, like punishment, serve to induce cooperative\nbehaviour if one was rewarded for pro-social actions.\nHowever, the effects of carrots and sticks on the level of cooperation are not\nsymmetrical, even when of equivalent magnitude: punishment is inherently more effective at\npromoting cooperation than rewards. Carrots are not enough because, although they may\nencourage some people to cooperate, they do not prevent all of them from cheating. Even if\nthe rewards of cooperation are large and obvious to everyone involved, they provide no\ncredible deterrent against defectors \u00ad cheats will not be deterred if they can gain even more\nby shirking the costs of cooperation (Schelling 1960; Sigmund et al. 2001). This reflects the\nfundamental paradox behind the famous \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" game. Even though each\nplayer is aware of the substantial rewards if they both cooperate, rational actors defect\nbecause this is the only way to avoid exploitation and it may bring an even greater payoff \u00ad\nand there is no credible deterrent against doing so (Axelrod 1984; Poundstone 1992). In other\ncontexts too, rewards turn out to be less effective than equivalent levels of punishment in\npromoting cooperation. Empirical experiments bear out this claim: despite its potential\nmutual rewards, cooperation collapses in real-life groups if there are no additional binding\nagreements to prosecute or punish dissenters (a single cheat can cause otherwise cooperative\nagents to withdraw their own contributions, Fehr and G\u00e4chter 2002; Ostrom et al. 1992;\nYamagishi 1986). Such results have led to a convergence of opinion among experimental\neconomists, game theorists and evolutionary biologists that \u00ad wherever self interest conflicts\nwith group outcomes \u00ad cooperation will emerge only if defectors are punished.\nRewards may contribute to promoting cooperation, but it is the weaker of the two\ncomplementary forces: punishment has an intrinsic leverage. While rewards clearly play an\nHand of God, Mind of Man\nimportant part in religious behaviour (a Christian, for example, may be motivated by eternity\nin heaven as much as by the fear of hell), the punishment aspect is likely to have the more\npotent influence on the dynamics of cooperation. As one theologian pointed out: \"The very\nproclamation of hell indicates that the defenders of religion found it necessary to balance the\nattraction of its promise with a threat for the `others', who rejected it or failed to meet its\ntests\" (Bernstein 1993, p. x). This resonates with the observation that while there are many\npre-industrial societies in which the only supernatural agents are antagonistic, there are few,\nif any, whose only supernatural agents are beneficent. The effectiveness of sticks over carrots\nalso concords with accumulating evidence that negative psychological events and phenomena\nare much more potent in their effects than positive ones (Baumeister et al. 2001).\nHuman cognition and supernatural agency\nThe supernatural punishment theory, outlined above, offers the plausible hypothesis\nthat a fear of supernatural punishment is the proximate mechanism that maintains\ncooperation, but it begs the all-important question of how the system initiates in the first\nplace. Johnson and Kruger (2004) suggested that the mechanism could originate via the\n\"green beard effect\" (Dawkins 1986; Hamilton 1964), via a purely cultural innovation, or via\ngroup selection processes (Sober and Wilson 1998; Wilson and Sober 1994). None of these\nmechanisms may be necessary, or sufficient, however.\nFigure 1. The human intentionality system has three key consequences: disposition to see\nagency in random events; secondary social emotions (shame, guilt, empathy etc.); and fitness\ncritical interactions with third parties. These lead to a fear of supernatural punishment (which\ndeters potential defectors), rewards for social norm compliance (which promotes cooperative\ntendencies), and Machiavellian strategies (which exploit the intentionality system). In\ncombination, these effects determine the resultant level of cooperation.\nEvolutionarily novel\ncognitive mechanism\nIntentionality System\n  \nConsequences\nDisposition to see\nagency in random events\nSecondary social emotions\n(shame, guilt, empathy\netc.)\nFitness critical interactions\nwith third parties\n  \nSpecialised adaptive\nheuristics\nFear of supernatural\npunishment\n\nRewards for social norm\ncompliance\n Machiavellian strategies\n \nEffect\nDeterrence of cheats\n(sticks)\n\nPromotion of cooperation\n(carrots)\n\n \nResult Resultant level of cooperation\nHand of God, Mind of Man\nAs has been recently pointed out, \"supernatural punishment can only be an effective\ndeterrent insofar as individuals are capable of reasoning that negative life events are caused\nby supernatural agents who have explicit reasons for bringing about such events\" (Bering\nevidence suggesting that humans do indeed reason in this way about negative events. We\nappear to have an inherent cognitive tendency to search for reason and intentionality in life\nevents, and to attribute positive and negative outcomes to supernatural agency. Keleman\nsuggests that children are \"intuitive theists\" because of their commonplace teleological\nreasoning that things usually exist \"for\" something (e.g. clouds are for raining, see Keleman\n2004). Bering and Bjorklund's (2004) study on children's reasoning about the psychological\nstates of dead agents also hints at a default \"afterlife\" stance that may only be usurped by\nexplicit scientific understanding about biology and death \u00ad knowledge that was of course\nlimited in our pre-scientific evolutionary past. Such tendencies, we argue, may have specific\nselective advantages at the individual level. The logic is set out below and illustrated in\nNovel selective pressures on human sociality\nUnlike other primate species, humans possess a sophisticated \"theory of mind\" and, in\nparticular, an \"intentionality system,\" which is the capacity to represent mental states as the\nunseen causes of behaviour (Bering 2002; Povinelli and Bering 2002). This intentionality\nsystem is foundational for a uniquely human cognitive specialization: \"second- and third-\norder representation\" \u00ad the ability to know what others know, and to know that they know\nwhat we know, or did (i.e. A knows that B knows what A knows, or did). Humans also differ\nfrom other species in having complex language (allowing information about specific social\nbehaviours to spread among the group). Consequently, B can inform C by word of mouth\nabout A's actions, information that can profoundly influence the nature of subsequent\ninteractions between A and C, with significant fitness consequences (for example, if A stole\nfrom B in the absence of any social others, then retaliation against A might come from C,D,\nor E and so on, perhaps days, weeks, or months later). Through the lens of this evolutionary\nnovelty, many higher-function and premeditated human behaviours take on great adaptive\nsignificance, including the murder of witnesses, revenge, suicide, and generosity (Bering and\nShackelford 2004). With humans, therefore, natural selection has a new workbench to shape\nbehavioural adaptations that Darwin did not consider. No other species are subject to its\neffects.\nBefore the evolution of the intentionality system and complex language, selfish\nbehaviour would be consistently selected for as long as it conferred a net payoff (even when\nthis occurred in full view of others). For example, chimpanzees can be selfish in front of\nother chimpanzees without their behaviour being reported to absent others. There can\ntherefore be no negative repercussions from absent third parties because such individuals\ncould not entertain others' knowledge states (nor could they learn such complex information\nby communication).\nAfter the evolution of the intentionality system and complex language, by contrast, it\nwas in the genes' interests to avoid selfish behaviour in contexts that could bring negative\nrepercussions (now, one had to worry about the consequences of other actors, wholly\nremoved from the scene of the crime, learning of the act and responding later). People could\nhear, discover, infer, remember, report, hypothesize, plan and act on others' behaviour \u00ad even\nlong after the event. What are the consequences?\nHand of God, Mind of Man\nGod-fearing strategies\nSelfish behaviour is evolutionarily ancient, whereas the intentionality system and\ncomplex language are evolutionarily novel. So while selfish behaviours might have paid off\nin the simpler social life of our prehistoric ancestors, many of them (or too many of them)\nwould bring a net fitness loss in a cognitively sophisticated, whispering society. The advent\nof these novel cognitive abilities increased the likelihood of public exposure for selfish\nbehaviour, which could bring high costs of retaliation by other group members (involving\nsocial sanctions, seizure of property, physical harm, ostracism, imprisonment, punishment of\nkin, or death).\nSpecific mechanisms might have evolved to rescue inclusive fitness after the\nindividual committed a social offence in this new \"big-brother\" society (e.g. cognitive\nprocesses underlying confession, blackmail, killing witnesses, suicide and so forth (Bering\nand Shackelford 2004)). However, these de facto strategies tax reproductive success, so\nnatural selection would favour more efficient traits that constrain selfishness to some extent\nin the first place (indeed we see such traits in human interaction every day \u00ad restraint, self-\ncontrol, sacrifice, sharing, patience etc.). Those that carried on being indiscriminately selfish\nwould be out-competed by prudent others who were able to successfully inhibit their more\nancient selfish motives and refrain from breaching social rules to begin with.\nAccording to Bering and Shackelford (2004), the human intentionality system\nallowed the selection of traits that militated against public exposure. Because the temptation\nto cheat remained, however, we add that something extra \u00ad a belief in supernatural\npunishment \u00ad was an effective way to caution oneself against transgressions and thereby\navoid \"real\" worldly retribution by other group members. God-fearing people may, therefore,\nhave had a selective advantage over non-believers because the latter's more indiscriminately\nselfish behaviour carried a higher risk of real-world vengeance by the community.\nMachiavellian strategies\nSo far we have focused on the disadvantages of the novel intentionality system and\ncomplex language \u00ad selfish actions now bring an increased risk of detection and retaliation.\nHowever, these cognitive innovations also brought opportunities: selective pressures for traits\nthat exploit them. One can manipulate others' knowledge as well as suffer from it (as a result\nof these two mechanisms, the overall selective effect might be expected to be quite strong,\neffectively \"pushed\" and \"pulled\" simultaneously in the same direction by evolution \u00ad\nexposed transgressors are selected out, prudent exploiters of the social cognitive system are\nselected in). As an example of manipulation, one can conceal the transgressions of kin, or\npreferentially cooperate with those who have established a good reputation with others \u00ad\nexamples which hint at significant implications for the evolution of kin-selection and direct\nor indirect reciprocal altruism among humans (Johnson and Bering In prep). In short, these\nnew psychological forces gave humans, for better or worse, a new capital stock to trade in \u00ad\nsocial information. Our ancestors became highly invested in this stock because it exerted a\nsignificant influence on reproductive gain. Profits came from effectively gathering, retaining,\nand regulating (through whatever means possible, including deception, threats, and violence)\nthe flow of social information that had the potential to impact inclusive fitness. One may\ntherefore postulate Machiavellian strategies that did exploit the human intentionality system\nfor personal gain, but which were not god-fearing.\nHand of God, Mind of Man\nTable 1. Three strategies come into competition with the advent of the human intentionality\nsystem (IS) and complex language. Grey-shading indicates consequences that act against\ngenetic fitness. Machiavellians outcompete ancestral individuals, and god-fearing strategists\noutcompete Machiavellians as long as pc > m. See text for further details.\nStrategy IS present?\nCan exploit\nIS for\npersonal\ngain?\nProbability of\ndetection\n(p)\nCost of\npunishment\n(c)\nCost of\nmissed\nopportunities\n(m)\nPayoff\nAncestral No No High Same None Lowest\nMachiavellian Yes Yes High Same None\nHighest\n(if pc < m)\nGod-fearing Yes Yes Low Same Some\nHighest\n(if pc > m)\nWhich strategy wins?\nTable 1 compares the performance of the above two strategies (God-fearing and\nMachiavellian), and the ancestral state, following the advent of the intentionality system and\ncomplex language. Machiavellians would clearly outcompete ancestral individuals because,\nwhile everything else is identical between them, ancestrals cannot exploit these new cognitive\nfeatures for personal gain. More importantly however, Table 1 indicates that god-fearing\nstrategists can outcompete Machiavellians. They differ in just two respects: god-fearing\nstrategists have a lower probability of detection, but miss out on some opportunities for\nselfish rewards. Therefore, god-fearing strategists will outcompete Machiavellians as long as\nthe total expected costs of punishment (i.e. the probability of detection (p) multiplied by the\ncost of punishment (c)) is greater than the cost of missed opportunities for selfish rewards\n(m). In other words, when the inequality pc > m is true. This would occur wherever the\nrewards of selfishness were relatively small compared with the costs of public exposure\n(which may include social sanctions, seizure of property, physical harm, ostracism,\nimprisonment, punishment of kin, or death). Even a small p can mean selfishness does not\npay on the average. Moreover, Error Management Theory predicts that, where pc > m, we\nshould expect exaggerated estimates of p (such as a belief that supernatural agents are\nwatching) to outperform accurate estimates of p, given that the latter will engender more\nrecent criminal evidence indicates that offenders tend to underestimate the probability of\nbeing caught and the costs of punishment (Robinson and Darley 2004).\nSummary of the model\nHumans often act on selfish motives (and sometimes inadvertently due to emotionally\ncharged situations) \u00ad acts which, thanks to the human intentionality system and complex\nlanguage, carry a far greater chance of social exposure than in previous stages of evolution. If\nthe costs of exposure are high enough, individuals that were more likely to refrain from\nHand of God, Mind of Man\ncheating for fear of supernatural agents concerned with group norms (indeed, such agents are\noften the proposed authors of these norms), and who are believed to punish defectors by\ninflicting misfortune (on both the self and innocent others), could have out-reproduced\notherwise equal \u00ad and more indiscriminately selfish \u00ad individuals. Of course, Machiavellian,\nnon-believing cheats who do not get caught would do best of all, but we suggest that the\nheightened costs of exposure by virtue of human cognitive sophistication favoured the\nevolution of traits that suppress selfish behaviour, and favoured instead the kind of moralistic\nbehaviour that is, after all, empirically common among human societies (Alexander 1987;\nConclusions\nThe supernatural punishment theory of Johnson and Kruger (2004), combined with\nthe powerful implications of the human intentionality system and complex language (Bering\nand Shackelford 2004), offers a novel theory for the origins of human cooperation \u00ad a\nsolution that has a specific proximate mechanism, and that precisely defines the cognitive\nprocesses involved. Our proposition is not mutually exclusive of other theories of religion,\nnor of other theories of cooperation. The mechanism we describe would complement many of\nthem. However, our proposal offers a more complete and plausible mechanism than some,\nand an intuitive and circumstantially supported one. Although we have highlighted a central\nrole for individual selection in our theory, which we believe could drive the system on its\nown, any inter-group advantages leading to the group selection of such morally bound\ncooperative behaviour would augment the process (as per Sober and Wilson 1998; Wilson\nand Sober 1994; Wilson 2002). Indeed, group selection would lead to a much more rapid\ndominance of god-fearing strategies, since groups with Machiavellians will suffer by\ncomparison.\nAn additional lever in our proposed mechanism comes from a consideration of third\nparties. Over and above any personal experience linking one's own actions to one's fortunes,\npeople can draw lessons from supernatural agency apparently befalling others (again, a\nfaculty made possible by the intentionality system). Someone else's misfortune or fortune\n(e.g. illness, gifted children) may tend to be seen as evidence of wrongdoing or virtue (e.g.\nselfishness, generosity). Whether the victim really is bad or virtuous is of little consequence\nfor selective pressures to operate if the events themselves are perceived as the \"evidence\"\n(especially where other group members corroborate that interpretation; cultural learning is\nclearly important here). Such perceived connections will steer onlookers away from\nbehaviour that would bring the same fate \u00ad not just because of the fear of supernatural\npunishment (as we proposed in our general argument above), but also because of learning\nhow such negative life events would be viewed and treated by other group members. Thus,\nsupernatural agents are seen not only as communicating to the self through life events, but in\nso doing, they are also seen as communicating to other group members about the moral\n(in)aptitude of the self. The gods effectively call out the wicked, exposing them to the group\nto impose its own social punishments.\nHow does our theory fit with existing literature? Sosis and Bressler (2003, p. 227)\nfound that, on the basis of their comparisons of secular and religious communes, the costly\nsignalling theory of religion fails to \"capture some critical elements of religious belief that\ndistinguish it from belief in a secular ideology.\" In their study, variation in costly signalling\nexplained variation in religious commune survival. However, variation in costly signalling\ndid not explain variation in secular commune survival. The underlying reason for this, they\nsuggest, is the special \"sanctity\" of religious rituals, which simply cannot be matched by\nsecular rituals (see also Whitehouse 2000). Religious rituals are superior to secular ones in\nHand of God, Mind of Man\ntheir ability to build solidarity among group members, it appears, because they are directed\ntowards a supernatural being, which authenticates them beyond logical analysis \u00ad a critical\ncomponent of their success (Rappaport 1999). Sosis and Bressler predict as a consequence\nthat, among different religious doctrines, those that are more reliant on supernatural agency\nshould exhibit higher levels of cooperation (a prediction partially supported by a recent\nempirical analysis of 186 pre-industrial cultures, Johnson 2005). Other evolutionary studies\narrive at similar appeals to some as-yet-unexplained, special feature of religion: Dogon\nwomen in Mali, for example, are obliged to visit \"menstrual huts\" to advertise their fertility\ncycle and thereby reduce cuckoldry. Although this conforms to theories based on ritual, the\nstudy's author noted that \"the threat of supernatural sanctions is crucial for enforcement\"\n(Strassmann 1992). We offer an explanation for why such a supernatural component may be\nso fundamental to understanding the power of religion in achieving cooperation.\nClearly, cooperation in the modern world cannot be explained solely by any religious\ntheory because cooperation is prevalent among atheists as well as believers (although we\nmust remember that 79% of Americans expect a day of judgment when God decides whether\nthey will go to heaven or hell and, depending on religious affiliation, 74% or more believe in\nan afterlife, as do 58% of adults who have no religious affiliation (Pinker 2002;\nReligioustolerance.org)). Many instances of social cooperation today are no puzzle at all,\nbecause governments and other organizations impose strong social contracts to cooperate\n(and punishment if one does not). However, many of these modern institutions, and their\nfounding morals, ethics and norms, are in fact deeply rooted in local traditions that are\nessentially religious. Indeed, religious traditions continue to underlie fundamental aspects of\nlaw, political discourse, appeals to public action problems, and social life, even if the modern\nproponents are no longer themselves believers (consider marriage, swearing on the bible in\ncourt, charity, many national constitutions, and calls for U.S. unity against an \"evil empire\"\nor \"axis of evil\" \u00ad it is not inconceivable that these norms originated and persevered because\nof their selective success and cognitive salience over human history). Certainly, most people\ntoday \u00ad even atheists \u00ad continue to behave in accordance with a set of values which, although\nthey may appear as self-evident, are directly analogous to many religious codes (and evoke\nthe same secondary emotions of shame, empathy, guilt etc., that supervise one's own\nactions). Our proposed mechanism can be generalized to suggest similar adaptive advantages\nin superstition, folklore, or just world beliefs.\nSpeculations about modern society aside, the real puzzle is still the evolutionary\norigins of cooperation behaviour \u00ad independent of the forces governing cooperation today.\nHow did early human societies achieve cooperation? Future studies of the evolutionary\norigins of cooperation must focus on analogues of that point in our history, the best window\nonto which comes from evidence on contemporary hunter-gatherer societies. Further cross-\ncultural and within-culture empirical tests would be tremendously useful (Johnson 2005;\nWilson 2002). We also need to know more about how religious beliefs and behaviours are\ntransmitted across generations. There is exciting new work along these lines (Alcorta and\nSosis 2005), and recent studies of twins indicate that aspects of religiosity are heritable, and\nthat this influences adult behaviour over and above influences in environmental conditions\nwhile growing up (Koenig et al. 2005). Certainly, there is something deep in biology and\nhuman nature that predisposes us to religious beliefs, offering a wealth of opportunities for\nMuch of the literature on religion and cooperation focuses on squaring religious\nbehaviour with economic \"rational-actor\" assumptions or, at the other extreme, the\nphysiological responses of the brain. What is lacking, however, is a careful consideration of\nthe \"black box\" in between \u00ad the human mind itself, and how cognitive processes interact\nHand of God, Mind of Man\nwith the natural selection of behaviour. We suggest that, by virtue of our unique social\ncognitive abilities, the evolution of cooperation may have been influenced more than\ncurrently appreciated by the hand of God at work in the mind of man.\n"
