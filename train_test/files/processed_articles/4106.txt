He made many original\ncontributions, including on binocularity (e.g., the Law of Visual Direction) and on eye\nmovements (e.g., the Law of Equal Innervation), and a conceptual breakthrough with his\nopponent-colour theory (or opponent-processing theory) which Helmholtz had wrongly\ndismissed at the time.\nHering's father was a pastor, and his religious and cultural roots are sometimes cited as\none reason for his lifelong antagonism towards the more cosmopolitan Helmholtz (Turner,\n1994, p. 56). Indeed, several digs at Helmholtz appear in the Translation below.\nAcademically, Hering favoured biological and nativistic explanations for perceptual\nphenomena, whereas Helmholtz proposed psychological explanations that emphasised\nlearned experience.\nBy 1899, Hering was back working in Leipzig, having been called there in 1895. In the talk\ntranslated below, he contradicts Helmholtz's denial that we possess the ability to detect\nspatial differences that subtend on the retina distances smaller than the diameter of a cone\nreceptor (i.e., what we nowadays call hyperacuity: Westheimer, 1975). By outlining\nexperiments by Wu\n\u00a8 lfing and Volkmann, as well as his own, he established the reality of\nour apparently paradoxical ability to detect spatial changes in the retinal image an order\nof magnitude smaller than a foveal receptor.1 Moreover, he provided a theory to explain the\nphenomenon.\nThis was based on his earlier development of a `local sign' theory.2 Each retinal receptor\nwas postulated to carry `space values' (Raumwerthe) that signalled its distance from the fovea\nalong orthogonal (rather Cartesian) x- and y-coordinate axes, as well as depth by way of\ninterocular differences in location along naso-temporal axes. He called these coordinates\n`breadth values' (Breitenwerthe), `height values' (Ho\n\u00a8 henwerthe), and `depth values'\n(Tiefenwerthe), respectively (Hering, 1861). He realised that for a Vernier-style offset to be\ndetected when it was less than the magnitude of one intercone distance, some integration of\ninformation was necessary. His diagrams of the situation (reproduced in our Translation)\nsuggest that since the lines or edges extend over several cone diameters, the natural way to\nsolve the problem would be to average \u00ad somehow \u00ad over the local sign values of the cones\nalong the lengths of the contours (e.g., for vertical contours, above and below the offset). This\nis indeed how this paper has been widely cited: as the source of this theory (e.g., Badcock &\nconsequence, some have claimed that Hering's theory has been disproved because dot stimuli\ncan exhibit hyperacuity (e.g., Ludvigh, 1953; Westheimer & McKee, 1977), and so too can\ncurved line stimuli (Matin, 1972) \u00ad although in its defence, many others have shown length\nsummation in hyperacuity experiments (e.g., Averill & Weymouth, 1925; French, 1920), if\nwith qualifications (Wang & Levi, 1994).\nHowever, although one could argue such averaging (along contour length) might be\nimplicit in his theory, in fact Hering only proposed in this 1899 paper that averaging\nhappens over time, as `the incessant small movements of the eyes' shift the image back and\nforth over the retina. Perhaps this fact has been overlooked by subsequent workers because\nHering gave the key part of the explanation in a footnote: designated footnote (d) in our\nTranslation. In this footnote, he first revealed more about his underlying philosophy, saying\nthat the mind creates idealised spatial structures, such as exactly straight lines, rather than\nmerely recreating the retinal image (although by this he actually meant recreating the spatial\npattern of retinal elements that are activated by the image). Otherwise, he said, a straight line\nwould generally appear `gezahnt' (literally, `toothed'; after some discussion, we have\ntranslated this here as `serrated').\nTo understand this view fully, we need to consider first his figures in the main text. In\nthese, Hering illustrates how he thinks straight edges in the image are perceived and how\nsmall offsets along their length are detected. For example, he assumed an edge that falls along\npurely a single line of receptors (such as the vertical set in Figure 1(b) in his paper) would be\nseen as being straight, despite the small offset (less than the diameter of a receptor) that\noccurs half-way along the edge. In contrast, the offset would be noticed when the eyes move\nthe image slightly so that the two offset parts of the edge lie along different lines of receptors,\neven if only partially (as illustrated in Figure 1(a) in his paper). Thus, as the eyes move\nthe image back and forth between the two situations (shown in Figures 1(a) and (b)), there\nwill be a `temporary but repetitive detectability of the location difference' (our italics) of the\nedge parts.\nBehind this is a further assumption that the local signs (space values) attached to each\nreceptor are all-or-none. Thus, the edge-parts above and below the offset in Figure 1(b)\nappear to be at the same (in this case, horizontal) location despite their different relative\nlocations within the hexagonal receptors above and below the offset. It makes no difference to\nthe perceived location of the edge just so long as each receptor receives an amount of light\nsufficient to make its sign `noticeable' to the mind. The intensity of the light falling on a\nreceptor is not indicated to the mind by the local sign.4 Hering believed this because,\naccording to Lotze's (1852) original theory, the local signs must be nonspatial (to solve the\nconundrum posed by Descartes' reasoning that, because the mind is nonspatial, the signals\nsent to it cannot have any spatial quality). Thus, importantly, a local sign does not carry\ninformation about the size or diameter of the receptor element but merely signals its location,\ntreated as a single point.5 Therefore, the number of receptors activated along an edge in the\nimage does not matter, as long as these receptors have the same values along the relevant axis\n(i.e., breadth values for a vertical edge, as in Figure 1). Hence, length summation along the\northogonal axis would not make any difference, but merely replicate redundantly the\ninformation the mind is already receiving from the sign of, possibly, only a single receptor.\nIn sum, Hering's eye-movement hypothesis ingeniously made his theoretical stance and the\nempirical evidence consistent with each other, whereas a length-summation explanation would\nin fact have been inconsistent with his theory.\nSubsequently, Andersen and Weymouth (1923) independently reinvented the theory of\naveraging across eye movements, and reproduced a figure just like Hering's, which they had\ncopied from Bourdon (1902, p. 146; note that although Bourdon had clearly read Hering's\n1899 paper, he did not mention Hering's eye movement explanation). However, in 1925\nAverill and Weymouth gave full credit to Hering as the originator of the idea in his 1899\npaper (indeed they quoted from the relevant footnote \u00ad although only in German). They\nargued, however, that this is only one factor at work \u00ad alongside length summation and\nbinocular summation \u00ad in improving acuity by (somehow) calculating a mean local sign. They\nStrasburger et al. 3\nprovided empirical evidence for each factor, for example, testing the relevance of eye\nmovements by varying stimulus exposure time.\nBut as explained above, subsequent writers in English have almost universally taken\nAverill and Weymouth's (1925) passing of credit to Hering (1899) to refer to the length\nsummation theory instead of to the eye movement theory or to a combination of these\ntheories. In addition, the role of eye movements in hyperacuity has frequently been denied,\nfor example, on the grounds that image stabilisation on the retina does not preclude\nlimits of acuity.\nIn fact, the relative popularities of these rival theories on the limits of acuity \u00ad those based on\nstatic (anatomical) or on dynamic (eye movement) factors \u00ad swung back and forth during the\nthe pendulum has swung towards the dynamic. With more sensitive techniques, miniature eye\nmovements during fixation have indeed been shown to be important factors in hyperacuity\nother processes such as the prevention of perceptual fading even in the fovea (e.g., Costela,\nMcCamy, Macknik, Otero-Millan & Martinez-Conde, 2013) and in acuity more generally\n(Ratnam, Domdei, Harmening & Roorda, 2017).\nSo Hering's 1899 paper still bears relevance for modern perception research, both in\nestablishing the existence of hyperacuity and as the first to suggest a positive role for\nminiature eye movements.6 It has been referred to in research across a wide range of\ntopics over the more than a hundred years since its publication (even though its actual\ncontent may have evaded many). These topics include peripheral vision (Ju\n\u00a8 ttner &\nanimals (Backhaus, 1959), and retinal implants (Eckmiller, Neumann & Baruth, 2005).\nThus, the paper we translate here has played, and continues to play, a pivotal role in\nstimulating discussion of the most fundamental aspects of vision \u00ad how it is a spatial sense\nat all and how it is so admirably good at it.7\nTranslation8\nE. Hering: On the Limits of Visual Acuity. (Presented at the meeting on 4 December 1899.\nFollowing a presentation by Mr. PULVRICH on the C. ZEISS Co. stereoscopic distance\nmeter, a discussion took place at the last convention of German natural scientists in\nMunich at which it was emphasised, by Mr. LUMMER in particular, that a striking\ncontradiction exists between the limits for the resolution of the eye, given amongst others\nalso by HELMHOLTZ, and the accuracy of binocular depth perception given by Mr. PULVRICH.\nThe discussion did not achieve resolution of this contradiction. The contradiction exists,\nhowever, only as long as we overlook that something basically different is measured with\nthe method commonly employed (including by HELMHOLTZ) to measure visual acuity,\ncompared to the determination of the accuracy of binocular depth perception.\nOne has become accustomed to use the visual angle of the smallest mutual distance at\nwhich two smallest possible points or narrow lines are just distinguishable as a measure of\nvisual acuity. For example, double stars or line grids offered themselves as appropriate\nobjects for such measurements, which can just about be resolved after as complete as\npossible accommodation. Yet, in this way, one determines the limits of optical resolution and\nnot the actual fineness of the optical spatial sense, that is, one does not measure the smallest\ndifference in position or size which the eye is just capable of recognising.\nThis difference is of fundamental importance, albeit not discussed anywhere as far as\nI know. I myself have been discussing it in my lectures for several years but have not\nfound an opportunity to come back to it in public.\nWe should not, offhand, use the smallest distance between two finest points or narrow lines\nthat are just resolvable as a measure of the fineness of the optical spatial sense. This follows first\nof all from the fact that, for example, the resolution of a bright double line presupposes the\nperception of a dark line in between, separating the two bright lines. Thence, one here\nrecognises not only a difference in position of the two bright lines but at the same time the\neven smaller difference in position of the dark in-between line and either of the bright lines.\nThus, the visual angle of the smallest difference in location perceived here does not correspond\nto the distance of the two bright lines, but corresponds to the location difference between the\ndark space in between and one of the bright lines. For the latter visual angle, however, only half\nof the first angle should be assumed at most. Thus, when, for example, a visual angle of 5000 is\nfound for the distance of a pair of lines that is just resolvable, the visual angle of the smallest\nrecognisable difference in position is to be set at a maximum of 2500.\nIt is, however, well established that the eye can even recognise much smaller differences in\na showed in his investigations `About the smallest\nrelative size difference that we are capable of perceiving' that \u00ad to mention just one\nexample (p. 130) \u00ad two [horizontal] distances9 located next to one another \u00ad demarcated\nby the finest [vertical] wires \u00ad of initially 0.5 mm, or 0.9 mm or 1.3 mm, were confidently\ndistinguished at 200 mm viewing distance when one of them was enlarged or diminished by\nmm, which corresponds to a visual angle difference of 12.4seconds.10,b VOLKMANN's\ninvestigations on the limits of unnoticeable differences (verkennbare Unterschiede) of small\nmagnitudes also led to values of the corresponding visual angles that extended well below\nc showed that one can recognise differences in position that\ncorrespond to a visual angle of 12\u00ad1000 or even less. On a nonius-type apparatus, he shifted\none half of a fine straight line against the other half by means of a micrometer screw until the\nposition difference of the two halves became just reliably noticeable, and calculated the visual\nangle corresponding to the shift.\nWU\n\u00a8 LFING also found his results in contradiction to the prevailing view and inferred from\nhis experiments, which incidentally resulted in only a fifth of the value for the `smallest visual\nangle' obtained by the double-object method, that the diameter of the retinal elements at the\nposition of direct vision (respectively, the axial distance between two neighbouring retinal\ncones) must also be correspondingly smaller than hitherto assumed. This conclusion, which\nmust strike us as odd considering the findings of histologists, is as we shall see directly, no\nmore compelling than those drawn at the time by VOLKMANN, taking into account the effects\nof irradiation, from the results of the double-object method.\nLet us, in the usual way, conceive of the retina's central part as being divided into as many\nhexagonal area elements as there are retinal cones in the same area, and let us further assume\nthat, for spatial perception, a space value (Raumwerth) goes with each of these visual field\nelements, as I will call them,12 that is just noticeably different from the space values of all of\nits neighbours. For a luminous double point to be still resolvable under such circumstances,\nthe two retinal images or their respective irradiation areas must not get so close, or overlap so\nfar, that a noticeably less illuminated visual field element does not still have space between the\ntwo illuminated visual field elements. The mutual distance of the points can therefore, even\nStrasburger et al. 5\nwhen we assume an (in reality never achievable) ideal acuity of their retinal images, never be\nsmaller than the diameter of a visual field element. The same holds for double lines \u00ad by\nwhich I, including in the following, entirely ignore that the retinal image of a straight line,\neven with the most regular arrangement of the visual field elements, could meet an aligned\nflight of elements only in very special cases and in general falls on a more or less zigzag-\nshaped line of elements.d\nWhile, therefore, an ultimate limit appears to be given in principle for the distance of\nresolvable double objects by the size of the visual field elements, the same does not hold true\nfor spatial differences obtained with the Nonius method or the method of distance\ncomparisons.\nLet a surface, half of which is black to one side, the other half white, be divided into an\nupper and a lower half by a cut that is horizontal and at right angles to the straight line\ndelimiting the white and the black, and let the lower half be movable against the upper half by\nmeans of a micrometer screw. As long as both halves of the vertical line are aligned, we see a\nsingle straight line, the apparent position of which is determined by the space values (breadth\nvalues) of all the visual field elements on which the image of the line falls. Presupposing the\nideal but perhaps never fully realised case where the concerned visual field elements are\narranged in straight, and coincidentally parallel, rows to the boundary line's image, there\nare first of all two possibilities, illustrated by Figure 1(a), (b), and Figure 2.13 Figure 1(a)\nshows us the lower half of the image of the boundary line of white, lying on the element row m-\nm such that a small shift, as already shown by the upper half of the line image, is sufficient to\nexcite, apart from the already aroused elements, also elements of row n-n by the light of the\nsurface's white half. As soon now as the excitation of the latter elements becomes sufficiently\nstrong to become noticeable, the location difference of the two line halves will also become\nnoticeable, insofar as our assumption is correct that each two neighbouring visual field\nelements have just noticeably different location values. Admittedly, a small shift of the line\nn\nm\nn\nm\nb\nb\nb\nb\nb\na\na\na\na\na\nc\nc\nimage on the retina will be sufficient to put both line halves once again onto one and the same\nelement row of consistently equal breadth values, as shown in Figure 1(b), but another small\nshift of the eye in the same or opposite direction will shift both line halves once again onto\nrows of different breadth values, and in this way the, admittedly temporary but repetitive,\ndetectability of the location difference can be sufficient to ensure the offset is perceived.\nA second schematic case is depicted in Figure 2, where the boundary line coincidentally\nlies parallel to two sides of the regular hexagonal visual field elements. The lower half of the\nborder line's image runs, in turn, on the middle line of an element (b) and over the boundary\nline between two elements each; its apparent breadth location will therefore be the resultant\nof the breadth locations of the elements named a and b. The upper half of the white's\nboundary has, however, shifted somewhat over the boundary of the elements marked a, to\nthe right onto the element row indicated by c, and its apparent breadth location is determined\nby the breadth values of the elements marked b and c, and will be just noticeably different\nfrom the position of the lower image half, provided that the excitation of the c-elements\nbecomes noticeable.\nThose just described are borderline cases; to them could be added those in which the\nboundary line between black and white is at an arbitrary oblique angle relative to the row\nelements, and finally one could assume an arrangement of the visual field elements deviating\nmore or less from the regular pattern. Always, however, one arrives at the result that under\nfavourable conditions even the shift of one line-half by a fraction of an element diameter\nappears sufficient for just noticing the location shift \u00ad as long as the `light area' of the retinal\nimage corresponding to the white object surface declines sufficiently steeply at its boundary.\nThis is because the light emanating from a luminous point will not be reunited at a point\non the retina even under the most favourable circumstances but illuminates a small area on\nthe surface. If we imagine, for a given case, that in every point of such a small laminar point\nimage an ordinate is raised whose height corresponds to the intensity of the illumination at its\nbase, then we obtain the image's light area (Lichtfla\n\u00a8 che), so-called by MACH. Likewise, the\naforementioned boundary line of a luminous area in the exterior space does not lead to a\nsharp boundary on the retina, as we have assumed in our figures, but the light area reaches,\nwith a more or less steep gradient, over the theoretically demanded boundary of the\nilluminated image part (physical irradiation). For the locational difference of the two\nhalves of such a boundary line to become noticeable, if in the retinal image it amounts to\nonly a fraction of one field element's diameter, it is required that the aforementioned light\narea decreases sufficiently steeply to change noticeably the illumination of the newly excited\nrow of elements with so small a shift. The value of the smallest noticeable locational change\nwill thus be dependent likewise on the focus of the retinal image, the more or less favourable\nillumination intensity, and the adaptation state of the eye.\nAnalogous considerations to those just made also apply to the method of distance\ncomparisons (Streckenvergleichung), as used by VOLKMANN.14 If one of the retinal images\nof the two adjacent distances is longer by only a fraction of an element diameter, it will, under\nfavourable circumstances, affect one more visual field element than the other.\nBinocular depth perception is another matter of perceiving positional differences, and\nanalogous considerations apply to experiments about the accuracy of binocular depth\nperception as for the investigations using the Nonius method or the method of size\ncomparison. HELMHOLTZ has already attempted to measure this accuracy. He used three\nneedles arranged initially in a fronto-parallel plane at 340 mm distance from the eyes, with\na mutual distance of 12 mm. The central needle was then moved out of the plane of the other\ntwo, until its deviation from that plane became just noticeable, for which a displacement of \u00bd\nmm was sufficient. A binocular parallax of 60\u00bd seconds of arc corresponds to the central\nStrasburger et al. 7\nneedle at this deviation, if the two on the side are mapped onto corresponding [retinal]\nlocations of the double eye (Doppelauge).15 This chance agreement with the smallest visual\nangle of a just resolvable double point or double line is the likely cause why HELMHOLTZ did\nnot vary his experiment at all, but concluded immediately `that the comparison of the retinal\nimages of the two eyes for the purpose of stereoscopic vision occurs with the same accuracy\nwith which the smallest distance is seen by one and the same eye'.e This conclusion was\nunjustified, because here `the smallest distances seen by the eye' meant the distances of the\njust still resolvable fine double objects and not the smallest still noticeable location difference\n(in breadth or height), and because a further variation of his experiment would have led\nHELMHOLTZ, too, to entirely different values for the accuracy of depth perception.\nSeveral years ago, Dr. CZAPSKI of C. ZEISS Co. was so kind as to leave me two glass panes\nwith engraved line systems that were made to study the limits of stereoscopic vision. On the\npane I used, several groups of 5 mm long lines were found on either side (at [inter-]pupillary\ndistance),16 the mutual distance of these lines being for the one eye fairly exactly 1 mm and for\nthe other larger or smaller for some of the lines by small fractions of a millimetre. Since I am\nmoderately short-sighted, I was easily capable \u00ad at viewing distances between 30 and 40 mm \u00ad\nto binocularly fuse two of these groups of lines each, under free viewing, and decide which lines\nappeared definitely closer or further away than their neighbours. The respective distance of the\nglass pane from the nodal point of the eyes was determined accurately, and the mutual\ndistances of the lines were measured under the microscope. It emerged that under\nfavourable illumination disparities of the lines corresponding to a visual angle of 1100\neffected a still confidently noticeable depth difference in the fused image. Imagine, thus,\nthree 5 mm high vertical lines on each side, each separated by 1 mm from the other, and\nthen the central line of the one group shifted sideways such that the distance of the shift\ncorresponds to a visual angle of only 11 seconds: Then, this positional difference discloses\nitself in the binocularly fused images by a shift of the central line out of the plane of the other\ntwo. I did not test whether even smaller positional shifts of the lines would make themselves\nstereoscopically noticeable. Dr. HOFMANN, who at my instigation made observations on the\nsecond pane, found a threshold of 11\u00ad1200 visual angle. According to PULVRICH'S data, younger\npersons with fairly acute and continuously practised eyes are capable of recognising parallactic\ndirection differences of 1000 and even less as depth differences under free viewing. Nothing is\nreported about the objects used for these measurements; therefore, for the time being, a\ncomparison with the experiments by VOLKMANN, WU\n\u00a8 LFING, and so forth is not possible.\nIn general, I will not address here at all the interesting and still insufficiently investigated\nrelationships between the fineness of binocular depth vision and the fineness of binocular\nvision with respect to breadth and height, in short of depth-perception acuity and of area-\nperception acuity (Fla\n\u00a8 chensehscha\n\u00a8 rfe). Only one thing should be briefly mentioned, namely,\nthat doing my observations using the line groupings on the above-mentioned glass panes, I\nobserved again how much easier and more confidently small differences of two distances can\nbe identified by using stereoscopic methods than by ordinary binocular observation, a fact\nthat appears to me worthy of thorough investigation. For this, both observation methods\nshould be applied comparatively using exactly the same objects.\nFinally, it is barely worth saying that if one replaces the assumptions underlying this\ntreatise about the field elements and their spatial relations to the retinal cones by\nconsiderably different assumptions, for example, by taking into account the difference of\nthe cross-sections of the peripheral members to that of the central [foveal] members, then\nthe interpretation of the discussed facts has to be different in part. Here, my aim was solely to\ndemonstrate how these facts can be subsumed under the now common assumptions about\nvisual field elements, whose correctness remains to be universally established.\n"
