Renal disease is commonly described as a complication of metabolic syndrome (MetS) but some recent studies suggest\nthat Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) may actually antecede MetS. Few studies have explored the predictive utility of co-clustering\nCKD with MetS for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Methods. Data from a nationally representative sample of United States\nadults (NHANES) was utilized. A sample of 13115 non-pregnant individuals aged  35 years, with available follow-up mortality\nassessment was selected. Multivariable Cox Proportional hazard regression analysis techniques explored the relationship between\nco-clustered CKD, MetS and CVD mortality. Bayesian analysis techniques tested the predictive accuracy for CVD Mortality of\ntwo models using co-clustered MetS and CKD and MetS alone. Results. Co-clustering early and late CKD respectively resulted\ncompared with individuals with no MetS and no CKD. A model with early CKD and MetS has a higher predictive accuracy\nConclusion. The study findings suggest that the co-clustering of early CKD with MetS increases the accuracy of risk prediction for\nCVD mortality.\n1. Introduction\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of\ndeath and disability in the United States, accounting for\napproximately 1 of every 2.8 deaths recorded in the United\nStates [1]. The tendency for the major CVD risk factors\nto occur in clusters informed considerable research interest\nleading to the description of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS)\n[2]. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)\nAdult Treatment Panel (ATP) III accepts the cooccurrence\nof abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated\nblood pressure, insulin resistance with or without glucose\nintolerance, prothrombotic states, and proinflammatory\nstates as MetS [3]. Although the precise pathophysiological\nmechanism of MetS is unknown, there is ample evidence of\nthe association of this syndrome with CVD and CKD.\nCKD is the ninth leading cause of death in the United\nStates with an estimated 19 million U.S. adults (6%) reported\nto have some form of CKD [4]. The association of several\ncomponents of MetS with CKD [5\u00ad8] has engendered the\nperception of CKD as a long-term complication of MetS.\nHowever, the establishment of hyperinsulinemia and glu-\ncose intolerance as the pathophysiological bases for insulin\nresistance in patients with renal disease along with the\nrecent implication of the renin-angiotensin system in local\npancreatic islet structure and function suggests a plausible\ncommon pathophysiological mechanism for MetS and CKD\nCKD is an established independent predictor of CVD\nmortality and a long-term complication of several of the\nindividual components of MetS. However, the value of the\ndiagnosis of MetS as an independent predictor of CVD\nmortality is controversial [2, 11]. A recent review of existing\nprospective data concludes that the CVD risk associated with\nthe diagnosis of MetS varies with the components employed\nin the diagnosis of the syndrome and that the diagnosis\nof MetS itself only modestly predicts (Relative Risk 1.65\u00ad\nof MetS are also established CVD risk factors and the\nclinical challenge has always been the establishment of\n2  \nthe additional risk posed by the diagnosis of MetS above\nand beyond the sum of the CVD risk factors employed in its\ndiagnosis.\nWe hypothesize that the inclusion of indices of CKD in\nthe diagnostic criteria for MetS will refine its identity as\na clinical entity and improve its predictive value for CVD\nmortality. The purpose of our study is to explore the effect of\nincluding indices of CKD as defined by the National Kidney\nFoundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative\n(KDQI) study [14] in the diagnostic criteria for MetS on\nthe predictive value of the syndrome for CVD mortality in\na nationally representative sample.\n2. Subjects and Methods\nThis study utilized data from a nationally representative\nsample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population\ncollected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nduring the third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurveys (NHANES III) conducted at 89 survey locations\nsurvey utilized a complex multistage cluster design and over-\nsampled persons 60 years and older, non-Hispanic black\nindividuals, and Mexican American individuals to enhance\nthe precision of prevalence estimates in these groups. In-\nperson interviews were conducted in sampled households,\nand all subjects were invited to participate in medical\nexaminations conducted at a nearby NHANES III mobile\nexamination center. Interviews consisted of demographic,\nsocioeconomic, dietary, as well as health-related questions,\nand the mobile examination component consisted of medical\nand dental examinations, physiological measurements, and\nlaboratory tests. The prevalence of common chronic condi-\ntions and associated risk factors was also determined during\nthis survey. Details of the survey design and examination\nprocedures have been previously published [15, 16]. The\nprimary study outcome, CVD mortality was recorded from\nthe NHANES III mortality follow-up data. This mortality\nfollow-up data relied on a probabilistic match between\nNHANES III and National Death Index (National Center\nfor Health Statistics (NCHS) 2006) death certificate records\n(59%) adult participants (those 17 years and older) that\ncompleted the initial interviews and physical examination\nand laboratory assessment at a mobile examination center\n[17]. Mortality assessments were conducted from the base-\ncause specific mortality and mortality dates. Cause specific\nmortality was coded using the International Classification\nof Diseases Ninth Revision (ICD-9) Clinical Modification\nInternational Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision for\ntotal sample of individuals with mortality assessment during\nthe follow-up period (n = 18, 149). Of these we excluded\nparticipants who were pregnant and less than 35 years of age\n3. Study Variables\n3.1. Outcome Variable. CVD mortality was the primary\noutcome variable of interest. Using the NHANESIII ICD-9\nand 2000 we created a dichotomous variable with categories\nfor CVD mortality and no-CVD mortality [17].\n3.2. Primary Predictor Variable. The primary predictor vari-\nable was cocustered MetS and CKD. To compute this variable\nwe first defined the individual metabolic risk factors or\nconditions consistent with the National Cholesterol Educa-\ntion Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III)\nclassification among the sample [18]: specifically (a) Elevated\nwaist circumference: Men  40 inches (102 cm) and Women,\n(c) Reduced HDL cholesterol: Men  40 mg/dL or Women\n(e) Elevated fasting glucose: 110 mg/dL, (f) Prothrombotic\nstate: fibrinogen > 350 mg/dL, and (g) Proinflammatory\nstate: C-reactive proteins: > 0.5 mg/dL. Then we identified\nstudy participants meeting a minimum of three of these\ncriteria and classified them as having MetS. We also created\na trichotomous CKD variable using the KDQI study clas-\nsification for stages of CKD [19]. Individuals in stages 3\u00ad\nlate CKD; individuals in the stages 1 and 2 (eGFR of 60\u00ad\nproteinuria) were classified as having early CKD. All other\nindividuals were classified as having normal kidney function.\nFinally we created a dummy variable with six categories for\nall the possible permutations of renal dysfunction and MetS\nfrom the two variables described earlier. The categories were\nas follows: (a) No MetS and No CKD, (b) No MetS and Early\nCKD, (c) No MetS and Late CKD, (d) MetS and No CKD, (e)\nMetS and Early CKD, and (f) MetS and Late CKD.\n3.3. Covariates. Covariates included factors demonstrated\nto be associated with CVD mortality and include socio-\ndemographic, smoking status, history of CVD, and mor-\ntality follow-up duration. Specifically, demographic factors\nincluded gender, age was categorized as <65 years and 65\nyears of age, gender, race, ethnicity, and poverty/income\nratio. Smoking status was categorized as never smoked,\nformer smokers and current smokers. Individuals with a self-\nreported history of physician diagnosis of stroke, myocardial\ninfarction, and congestive heart failure were categorized as\nhaving a history of CVD. The time from baseline assessment,\nmortality assessment or death was included in the analysis to\ncontrol for any temporal influences of time on the outcome\nof interest (CVD mortality).\n4. Statistical Analysis\nDescriptive analyses of all the variables utilized in the data\nanalysis were conducted. We explored the distribution of the\nvariables among categories of CVD and no CVD mortality.\n  3\nTable 1: Sample weighted distribution of study variables (n = 13115).\nVariables %\nRace\nGender\nAge (years)\nPoverty/income ratio\nSmoking status\nEver-smoker (currently nonsmoker) 31.4%\nHistory of CVD (stroke, MI & congestive heart failure)\nHypertriglyceridemia\nDecreased HDL cholesterol (men  40 mg/dL/women  50 mg/dL)\nDiabetes (FBS, medications for DM & physician diagnosis)\nCentral obesity (waist circumference: men  40 inches/women  35 inches)\nProinflammatory state (CRP  3 mg/dL)\nProthrombotic state (fibrinogen  350 mg/dL )\nMetabolic syndrome (meet at criteria for 3 or ATP III criteria)\nRenal dysfunction (eGFR in mL/min/1.73 m2 and proteinuria)\n4  \nTable 1: Continued.\nVariables %\nRenal dysfunction & metabolic syndrome\nNo metabolic syndrome and no renal dysfunction 31.9%\nNo metabolic syndrome and early renal dysfunction 24.4%\nNo metabolic syndrome and late renal dysfunction 3.6%\nMetabolic syndrome and no renal dysfunction 14.7%\nMetabolic syndrome and early renal dysfunction 19.4%\nMetabolic syndrome and late renal dysfunction 6.0%\nCVD specific mortality\nInterview/exam to mortality follow-up period in months (mean \u00b1 std) 96.5 [\u00b133.0]\nSample excludes individuals aged <35 years, pregnant, or have no mortality assessment.\nTable 2: Distribution of Independent Variables and   (n = 13115).\nIndependent variables\nNo CVD mortality CVD mortality\nfrequency (%) frequency (%)\nRace\nGender\nAge (years)\nPoverty/income ratio\nSmoking status\nHistory of CVD (stroke, MI & congestive heart failure)\nMetabolic syndrome (meet at criteria for 3 or ATP III criteria)\nRenal dysfunction (eGFR in mL/min/1.73 m2 and proteinuria)\nRenal dysfunction & metabolic syndrome\nNo metabolic syndrome and no renal dysfunction 96.3% 3.7%\nNo metabolic syndrome and early renal dysfunction 89.8% 10.2%\nNo metabolic syndrome and late renal dysfunction 61.9% 38.1%\nMetabolic syndrome and no renal dysfunction 93.9% 6.1%\n  5\nTable 3: Univariate and Multivariable Cox Regression Analysis   versus Independent Variables (n = 13115).\nUnivariate analysis Multivariable analysis\nRace\nGender (ref)\nAge (years)\nPoverty/income ratio\nSmoking status\nHistory of CVD (stroke, MI & congestive heart failure)\nRenal dysfunction & metabolic syndrome\nNo metabolic syndrome and no renal dysfunction (ref) 1.00 -- 1.00 --\nTable 4: Area under the Curve (AUC) for CVD Mortality using unadjusted metabolic syndrome measure compared with cocustered\nmetabolic syndrome and early stage renal disease.\nArea under the ROC Accuracy Cohen's Kappa Mortality cases/total\nUsing the Cox proportional hazard model in multiple\nsurvival analysis regression tests and controlling for the\ninfluence of time to mortality assessment from baseline we\nexplored the Univariate relationship between the predictor\nvariables and CVD mortality (including both censored and\nevent categories). The time to event was considered the\ntime from the baseline laboratory measures and survey\nmeasurement to the time of mortality assessment or death\nof participants. A final multivariable survival analysis model\nwas then created using all the significant predictors of\nCVD mortality in the univariate models to examine the\ninfluence of MetS and CKD on CVD mortality. Tests were\nconducted to rule out collinearity prior to running the final\nmultivariable regression analysis model including all the\ncovariates noted above. All data analyses were conducted\nusing SAS (version 8.0; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and\nSPSS (version 15.0). Statistical hypotheses were tested using\nP < .05 as the level of statistical significance. Finally we also\nutilized the Bayesian analysis technique using the Waikato\nEnvironment for Knowledge Analysis software (Weka 3.0) to\ntest the predictive accuracy of a model including a cocustered\nMetS and early CKD variable when compared to a model\nincluding separate MetS and early CKD measures while\nadjusting for other predictors of CVD mortality identified in\nthe Univariate analysis.\n5.

The mean mortality follow-up period was about\n97 months and CVD specific mortality among the sample\n5.2. Distribution of CVD Mortality. The distribution of CVD\nspecific mortality in the sample is presented in Table 2.\nHigher mortality rates were observed in individuals who\nbelow the 100% federal poverty line (15.1%), had a history of\nor had late stage renal disease without cooccurring MetS\n(38.1%) closely followed by individuals with both late stage\nrenal disease with cooccurring MetS (31.0%).\n5.3. Unadjusted Relationship: Cocustered CKD and MetS\nversus CVD Mortality. Univariate analysis using Cox propor-\ntional hazard analysis demonstrated that individuals aged\n65 years or older, male, who had a history of CVD, were\nwhite and lived below the 100% federal poverty income\nline were more likely to had significantly greater hazard\nof mortality (Table 3). Using the cocustered CKD and\nMetS variables categories, the results demonstrated that in\nincreasing order, early CKD without MetS (HR = 3.02, CI\n19.48) all had a statistically significant higher mortality\nhazard when compared to no MetS or CKD. Individuals\nwith MetS and no CKD did not demonstrate any statistically\nsignificant difference in hazard for CVD mortality when\ncompared with individuals with no MetS or CKD.\n5.4. Adjusted Relationship: Cocustered CKD and MetS versus\nCVD Mortality. After adjusting for other potential predictors\nof mortality a Cox proportional hazard model was developed\nto explore the relationship between cocustered CKD and\nMetS with CVD mortality. All measures reported previously\nin the Univariate analysis model as being significantly\nassociated with CVD mortality remained the same (Table 3).\nUsing the cocustered CKD and MetS variables categories,\nthe results demonstrated that in the same increasing order\nas observed in the Univariate analysis, early CKD without\nsignificant higher mortality hazard when compared to no\nMetS or CKD. Individuals with MetS and no CKD did\nnot demonstrate any statistically significant difference in\nhazard for CVD mortality when compared with individuals\nwith no MetS or CKD. Figure 1 demonstrates the adjusted\nrelative hazard for CVD mortality among the categories of\ncocustered CKD and MetS variable. Figure 2 presents a bar\nchart displaying the adjusted relative hazard ratios for CVD\nmortality among the categories of cocustered CKD and MetS\nvariable.\n5.5. Predictive Accuracy of Models Cocustering Early CKD and\nMetS versus MetS Alone for CVD Mortality. The results of\nthe Bayesian analysis as shown in Table 4 demonstrated that\nfor CVD mortality a model with cocustering of early CKD\nand MetS demonstrated higher predictive accuracy (72.0%\nalone.\n  7\n6. Discussion\nThe poor predictive value of the diagnosis of MetS for CVD\nmortality has cast serious doubt on the existence of MetS\nas a clinical entity distinct from its diagnostic components.\nHowever, the clustering of metabolic abnormalities that led\nto the description of the syndrome is still apparent in clinical\npractice. This clustering of metabolic abnormalities more\noften than would be predicted by chance alone was the\nbasis for the description of the syndrome and the suggestion\nof a common etiology for its components. The initial\nassociation of the syndrome with glucose intolerance and\nhyperinsulinemia led to the suggestion of Insulin resistance\nas the probable common pathophysiological basis for the\nsyndrome [20\u00ad22]. However, subsequent conflicting series\nof studies led the National Cholesterol Education Program\n(NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III to conclude that\nthe relationship between insulin resistance and MetS is not\nwell established [3].\nThe emerging role of vitamin D as a modulator of both\ninsulin resistance and the renin-angiotensin system [23]\nand the recent implication of the renin-angiotensin system\nin local pancreatic islet structure and function suggest a\nbroader base for a probable common etiology for MetS\nthan previously anticipated. The traditional association of\nCKD with several components of MetS may have led to\nthe exclusion of CKD as a component of MetS and misled\nthe search effort for a common pathophysiological basis for\nthe components of the syndrome. It is in the light of this\nemerging body of evidence that we evaluate the effect of\nincluding early CKD in the diagnostic criteria for MetS on\nits predictive value for CVD mortality using a nationally\nrepresentative sample.\nThe preponderance of participants with early CKD in\nthe analysis sample makes it suitable for the isolation of\nthe influence of early CKD on the predictive value of MetS\nfor CVD mortality. The association of CKD with CVD\nmortality in this study is consistent with the existing body\nof evidence and highlights the significance of CKD as an\nindependent risk factor for CVD mortality. Even in the early\nstages CKD carries a significant risk for CVD mortality\nCKD, MetS carries no significant risk for mortality in this\nstudy. However, early CKD becomes more hazardous with\na hazard ratio of 1.8 versus 1.69 for CVD mortality in the\npresence of MetS (Figure 2). The greater hazard of early\nCKD in the presence of MetS is associated with a slight but\nsimilar reduction in survival among the affected participants\n(Figure 1). The apparent lack of a significant association\nbetween MetS and CVD mortality is consistent with the\nresults of several previous studies but the increase in the\nhazard ratio for CVD mortality associated with early CKD\nin the presence of MetS gives credence to a potential renal\ncontribution to the pathogenesis and perhaps mortality of\nMetS.\nThe primary purpose of this study was to explore\nthe implication of including indices of early CKD in the\ndiagnostic criteria of MetS for the predictive value of the\nsyndrome for CVD mortality. The results of this study\nsuggest a broader base for a common etiology for MetS and\nsupport the finding of a potential renal contribution to the\netiology of the syndrome. The results of this study represent\nan analysis of a nationally representative sample of 13,115\nparticipants with a mean mortality follow-up period of about\nHowever, the mortality follow-up data employed in this\nstudy relied on a probabilistic match between NHANES\nIII and National Death Index (National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS) 2006) death certificate records available\nand inaccurate matches for CVD specific mortality may\npotentially confound the study findings, particularly since\na few studies suggest that appropriately identifying CVD-\nspecific mortality may inadvertently result in misclassifica-\ntion of cause specific mortality [24]. Also given the cross\nsectional nature of risk measures utilized in our study the\nimpact of other confounding events post assessment may\nimpact our finding and influence the attribution of CVD\nmortality to our study risk measures.\nOverall the study findings that early CKD may cocuster\nwith MetS to result in an increased mortality burden should\ninform more studies to explore the temporal relationship\nbetween the pathogenesis of CKD and MetS.\nReferences\n[1] A.
