Hedonic well-being\ncorresponds to the subjective well-being (SWB) construct,\ndefined as the presence of life satisfaction and positive affect,\nand the absence of negative affect. Eudaimonic well-being\nrefers to the dimensions that describe the optimal psycho-\nlogical functioning of the individuals (e.g., meaning in life,\npositive relationships, and self-acceptance). Although these\ntwo perspectives have been developed independently of each\nother, recently it has been proposed that they should be inte-\ngrated (Huppert & So, 2013) because of the substantial over-\nlap between the two constructs (e.g., Disabato, Goodman,\nKashdan, Biswas-Diener, & King, 2008). Here, we provide\nevidence contrary to this proposal by showing that hedonia\nand eudaimonia are distinguishable, and that flourishing\nrelates to the cognitive component of SWB more than\nhedonic affect. Moreover, factor analyses of our data support\na bipartite model of SWB over a one-factor model. The\nresults of the present study, thus, suggest the usefulness of\nseparate measures for these two components of well-being.\nDifferent Types of Well-Being?\nIt may be simpler to consider well-being to be a unidimen-\nsional construct, as hypothesized, for example, by the Oxford\nHappiness Questionnaire (Hills & Argyle, 2002) or by the\nsingle-item measures proposed in several contexts (e.g.,\nFordyce, 1977). Some researchers, however, have noted that\n1Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Padova, Italy\n2Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Firenze, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nCorrado Caudek, PhD, NEUROFARBA, Sezione di Psicologia, Universit\u00e0\ndegli Studi di Firenze, Via di San Salvi 12, Complesso di S.

In fact,\nit has been shown that, when constructing self-evaluations,\nrespondents rely on multiple sources of information and\nsocial standards. Hedonic affect measures encourage respon-\ndents to base their evaluations on feelings of pure emotional\npleasantness/unpleasantness; judgments of life satisfaction\n(SWB cognitive component), instead, tend to elicit higher\norder conscious processes. Likewise, eudaimonic measures\ninvolve cognitive processes beyond affective experience in\nevaluating one's positive functioning (Kashdan et al., 2008).\nFor example, meaning and purpose in life can be influenced\nby thoughts about the future (Waytz, Hershfield, & Tamir,\n2015). Consistent with these previous findings, the present\nstudy provides evidence that hedonic and eudaimonic well-\nbeing are related but distinct constructs.\nMeasuring Hedonic Affect\nThe affect dimensions of SWB are often measured with the\nPositive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson,\nhave pointed out that the PANAS has some important limita-\ntions, such as the inclusion of adjectives that do not represent\nreal feelings (e.g., \"strong,\" \"alert,\" \"determined,\" \"active\")\nor that are infrequent (e.g., \"inspired\"). Moreover, the\nPANAS omits some basic feelings (\"sad,\" \"depressed\"),\nwhereas others are overrepresented (e.g., \"jittery,\" \"ner-\nvous,\" \"scared,\" and \"afraid\" are all feelings that represent\nanxiety). Overall, the PANAS tends to overrepresent states\nof high arousal, namely anxiety, for the negative affect, and\nenthusiasm for the positive affect; the negative (depression)\nand the positive (peace and serenity) counterparts character-\nized by low arousal are absent. This characterization of\nhedonic affect can be problematic, especially when applied\nto other cultures. In fact, if for North Americans and\nEuropeans the emotional states characterized by high posi-\ntive arousal are desirable, for East Asians low-arousal feel-\nings such as \"calm\" and \"relaxed\" are more appreciated\nContrary to the PANAS, the Scale of Positive and Negative\nExperience (SPANE) is able to assess the full set of feelings\nfelt by the respondent, both general and specific (Diener\net al., 2009). Using adjectives with a broad and general sig-\nnificance, such as \"good,\" \"positive,\" and \"pleasant,\" the\nSPANE includes a wide range of desirable feelings.\nCorrespondingly, Diener et al. (2010) included general\ndescriptors with a negative valence such as \"bad,\" \"negative,\"\nand \"unpleasant.\" Specific feelings, both positive (\"happy,\"\n\"joyful,\" \"contented\") and negative (\"sad,\" \"afraid,\" \"angry\"),\ncomplete the full range of emotional states. The PANAS asks\nrespondents to rate each feeling in terms of its intensity,\nalthough the temporal frame seems more strongly related to\nwell-being than the feeling's intensity (Diener, Colvin, Pavot,\n& Allman, 1991). For this reason, the SPANE asks respon-\ndents to quantify the amount of time they passed in a particu-\nlar feeling in the previous month. Recently, Jovanovi (2015)\nshowed that the SPANE subscales explain more variance than\nthe PANAS in life satisfaction, depression, and general\nwell-being.\nMeasuring Eudaimonic Well-Being\nThe eudaimonic theoretical framework is scarcely integrated\nbecause it encompasses the contributions by many authors,\nsuch as the self-determination theory by Ryan and Deci\nthe concept of psychological well-being by Ryff (1989). In\nthe eudaimonic tradition, well-being is identified with the\nconstruct of flourishing, which refers to the optimal psycho-\nlogical functioning of the individual (Keyes, 2002).\nAfter noting the limitations of the existing measurement\ninstruments, several authors studying flourishing have tried\nto identify its underlying dimensions (Diener et al., 2010;\nexample, the factorial validity of the Psychological Well-\nBeing Scales (PWBS; Ryff, 1989) has been questioned\n(Springer, Hauser, & Freese, 2006), and some of its items\nhave been deemed inappropriate descriptors of eudaimonic\nwell-being (Huta & Ryan, 2010). The conceptualizations\nin fact, spuriously include in the flourishing construct \"posi-\ntive emotions\" dimension that should be measured separately\nThe Flourishing Scale (FS) developed by Diener et al.\n(2010) was aimed at supplementing the existing instruments,\nwhich are too long (e.g., PWBS) or too narrow in scope (e.g.,\nBasic Needs Satisfaction Scale [BNSS]; Ryan & Deci, 2000).\nThe FS provides a brief and comprehensive measure of\nflourishing that summarizes the existing dimensions pro-\nposed by other authors: meaning and purpose of life (Ryff,\nactivities (Csikszentmihalyi, 1990), perception of the per-\nsonal contribution to the well-being of others (Putnam,\n2000), perception of personal competence (Deci & Ryan,\n(Scheier & Carver, 2003), and being respected (Brown,\nNesse, Vinokur, & Smith, 2003). The FS does not evaluate\neach of these single dimensions separately but provides a\ngeneral overview of the individual's perception of his or her\nown positive functioning.\nPurpose of the Study\nThe present study had two aims: (a) to validate the FS and the\nSPANE in an Italian sample, and (b) to test the usefulness of\nseparate measures of the hedonic and eudaimonic well-being\nGiuntoli et al. 3\ncomponents. The first aim was addressed by evaluating the\npsychometric properties of the Italian FS and SPANE (Study\n1). The main reason for conducting this study is the growing\ninterest in well-being research in Italy (Speroni, 2010) and a\nconsequent increased need for appropriate measures of well-\nbeing. The second aim was addressed by examining the con-\ncurrent validity of hedonic affect and eudaimonic well-being,\nand by comparing one-dimensional and two-dimensional\nmodels of well-being. Specifically, we measured the strength\nof association between hedonia and eudaimonia (measured\nby the SPANE and the FS), on one side, and other measures\nof the cognitive component of SWB (Study 1) and two mea-\nsures of psychological distress (Beck Anxiety Inventory\n[BAI], Beck, Epstein, Brown, & Steer, 1988; Beck Depression\nInventory\u00adII [BDI-II], Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996), on the\nother, within a sample of unemployed individuals and within\na control group (Study 2).\nWe evaluated the internal consistency and the factorial valid-\nity of the Italian FS and SPANE. We also examined the fac-\ntor-measurement invariance of the two instruments across\npaper-and-pencil and Internet data collection methods by\nmeans of multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA)\ntechniques. In both the paper-and-pencil and Internet sam-\nples, we expected to find a one-factor structure for the Italian\nFS and a two-factor structure for the Italian SPANE (Diener\net al., 2010). Once the invariance across the Internet and\npaper-and-pencil groups was established, convergent valid-\nity was explored in the combined sample by considering the\ncorrelations between the Italian FS, the Italian SPANE, and\nother measures of well-being, such as the Subjective\nHappiness Scale (SHS; Lyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999), the\nPANAS (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988), the Satisfaction\nWith Life Scale (SWLS; Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin,\n1985), the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI; International\nWellbeing Group, 2006), and the Single Global Item (SGI;\nInternational Wellbeing Group, 2006). We expected to find a\nstrong association between the SPANE-P and the PANAS-P,\nand between the SPANE-N and the PANAS-N, because they\nall measure positive or negative affect. Furthermore, we\nexpected a stronger association of the FS compared with the\nSPANE scores with measures of the cognitive component of\nSWB (SWLS, PWI, SGI), given that eudaimonic well-being\ninvolves cognitive processes beyond affective experience.\nParticipants\nyears) from introductory undergraduate psychology classes\nat the University of Florence, Italy (68.4% females). Average\n= 3.6) for males. This sample completed the paper-and-pen-\ncil versions of the Italian FS and SPANE. Additional 218\nparticipants completed the Internet-based administrations of\nParticipation in the study was voluntary, anonymous, and in\ncompliance with institutional ethical guidelines. All partici-\npants were informed through written instructions about the\nanonymity and confidentiality of their data.\nMeasures\nTo evaluate the convergent validity of the Italian FS and of\nthe SPANE, we administered the following instruments.\nFS. The FS (Diener et al., 2010) is an eight-item scale mea-\nsured on a 7-point Likert-type scale response format, which\nfocuses on the eudaimonic aspects of well-being (e.g., \"I\nlead a purposeful and meaningful life,\" \"My social relation-\nships are supportive and rewarding,\" \"I am engaged and\ninterested in my daily activities\"). The total score is calcu-\nlated by the sum of the item scores and can range from 8 to\n56, with higher scores meaning that the respondent rates\nhimself or herself as a very positive functioning individual.\nreport measure made up of two subscales: six items for posi-\ntive affect (SPANE-P) and six items for negative affect\n(SPANE-N). Positive and negative affect is evaluated over\nthe past 4 weeks. Respondents rate how often they had expe-\nrienced the feelings indicated by each item by means of a\nLikert-type scale ranging from 1 (very rarely or never) to 5\n(very often or always). Scores of the SPANE-P and SPANE-\nN are calculated separately because of the putative indepen-\ndence between these two kinds of feelings (Diener et al.,\nall score (SPANE-B), ranging from -24 to 24, is computed\nby subtracting the SPANE-N score from the SPANE-P score.\nPANAS (trait). The PANAS (Terracciano, McCrae, & Costa,\ntory assessing the two primary mood dimensions: positive\naffect (PANAS-P) and negative affect (PANAS-N). Both\naffective dimensions can be measured either as a state (i.e.,\n\"How do you feel right now?\") or as a trait (i.e., \"How do\nyou generally feel?\"). In the present administration, partici-\npants were instructed to assess their feelings \"in general.\" An\naffect balance score (PANAS-B) is computed by subtracting\nthe PANAS-N scores from the PANAS-P scores. The 10\nitems of the PANAS-N assess unpleasant engagement and\nsubjective distress (e.g., \"afraid,\" \"upset\"), whereas the 10\nitems of the PANAS-P assess positive affect (e.g., \"enthusi-\nastic,\" \"proud\"). Participants rate to what extent they have\ngenerally experienced each emotion on a 5-point scale rang-\ning from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). Total\nscores on each subscale range from 10 to 50, with higher\nscores indicating high levels of positive or negative affect.\n4 SAGE Open\nSHS.The SHS (Iani, Lauriola, Layous, & Sirigatti, 2014;\nLyubomirsky & Lepper, 1999) is a four-item scale rated on a\n7-point Likert-type scale designed to assess global subjective\nhappiness. Two items ask respondents to characterize them-\nselves based on absolute ratings and ratings relative to peers,\nwhereas the other two items ask to what extent participants\nidentify themselves with descriptions of happy and unhappy\nindividuals. A global score is computed by averaging the\nscores for the four items.\nSWLS. The SWLS (Diener et al., 1985) is a five-item instru-\nment created to measure the cognitive component of SWB.\nParticipants respond to each item by indicating on a 7-point\nLikert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7\n(strongly agree), their general satisfaction with life accord-\ning to their own criteria. Total scores range from 5 to 25, with\nhigher scores reflecting greater life satisfaction.\nPWI.The PWI (International Wellbeing Group, 2006)\nconsists of eight items that assess the personal satisfaction\nin eight specific life domains: standard of living, health,\nachievement in life, personal relationship, personal safety,\ncommunity connectedness, future security, and spiritual-\nity religion. Respondents are asked to rate their level of\nsatisfaction within each domain by a numerical rating\nranging from 0 (extremely dissatisfied) to 10 (extremely\nsatisfied).\nSGI.This item (International Wellbeing Group, 2006) asks\nabout participants' overall life satisfaction (\"Thinking about\nyour own life and personal circumstances, how satisfied are\nyou with your life as a whole?\"), and it is often administered\nwith the PWI. Participants respond on a 11-point scale, rang-\ning from 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 10 (completely\nsatisfied).\nProcedure\nThe authors independently translated the original FS and the\nSPANE into Italian and made a synthesis of the four transla-\ntions. Next, two native English speakers with a BS degree in\npsychology from a U.S. University back-translated the\nItalian version into English. This back-translation was then\nchecked for consistency of meaning with the original English\nversion. This process was repeated until the back-translation\nwas found to correspond to the original. Moreover, the Italian\nFS and SPANE were judged by other two bilingual transla-\ntors to verify the linguistic equivalence with their English\nversions. For the FS, the interrater agreement was Kappa =\n1.219]. This last step showed that further item refinement\nwas unnecessary. The Italian FS and SPANE are reported in\nSupplementary Material Appendixes D and E.\nData Analysis\nAll the analyses were conducted with the software R (R Core\nTeam, 2016). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was per-\nformed with the R-package lavaan (Rosseel, 2012). To deter-\nmine the fit of the CFA models, we considered the 2 test\nstatistic, the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker\u00adLewis\nindex (TLI), the root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA), and the standardized root mean square residual\n(SRMR). Generally, CFI and TLI values larger than .90 are\ntaken to indicate acceptable fit, although values greater than\nindicate close fit, values between .05 and .08 indicate accept-\nable fit, values between .08 and .10 indicate mediocre fit, and\nvalues greater than .10 indicate poor fit (Browne & Cudeck,\nhowever, values as high as .08 are deemed acceptable (Hu &\nWe tested measurement invariance using MG-CFA across\nadministration methods (paper-and-pencil and Internet).\nFactorial invariance was tested by comparing a series of\nincreasingly restrictive models using the R-package sem-\nTools (semTools Contributors, 2015) with progressively\nmore restrictive hypotheses about equality across groups\nConfigural invariance is the most basic level of measure-\nment invariance, and only requires the same number of fac-\ntors and the same overall factor pattern across groups. Weak\ninvariance adds to the requirements of configural invariance\nthe constraint of the equality of the factor loadings across\ngroups. Strong invariance (also referred to as scalar invari-\nance) requires both the factor loadings and the item inter-\ncepts to be invariant across groups. Strict invariance adds to\nthe previous constraints the equality across residuals. These\nfour levels of increasingly restrictive constraints are defined\nby the relationship between the items and the factors (mea-\nsurement model), and their equality across groups is a neces-\nsary condition for measurement invariance.\nThe 2 test is typically used to compare the fit of two\nnested models, with the less parameterized model being\nfavored when the 2 difference is not statistically significant.\nLike the 2 model fit test statistic, however, the 2 test is\nsensitive to sample size. Therefore, we followed the practice\nof using the CFI criterion, with CFI < .01 being consid-\nered evidence supporting the less parameterized model\nResults\nDescriptive analysis.Descriptive statistics for the FS and\nSPANE are shown in Table 1. The assumption of normal\ndistribution was validated graphically by normal quantile\u00ad\nquantile (QQ) plots of test scores. Skewness and kurtosis\nwere within the expected range (Lei & Lomax, 2005).\nGiuntoli et al. 5\nInternal consistency. Cronbach's alpha was larger than .80 for\nall scales, suggesting good internal consistency (Nunnally &\nBernstein, 1994)--see Table 1. Item-total correlations were\nrange; SPANE-N: .51-.74 range). The deletion of any single\nitem did not appreciably decrease Cronbach's alpha (FS: .85-\nrange) (Supplementary Material Appendix A, Table S1).\nCFAs for FS and SPANE scores. In the Italian sample, we repli-\ncated the factor solutions reported by Diener et al. (2010).\nThe one-factor solution for the FS provides an adequate fit in\nboth samples according to the 2/df, CFI, TLI, SRMR, and\nRMSEA criteria (Table 2). All items loaded on the latent fac-\ntor in high degree from .60 to .80 for the paper-and-pencil\nadministration, and from .64 to .81 for the Internet adminis-\ntration. Also, the two-factor solution for the SPANE had an\nacceptable fit in both samples. All the factor loadings were\nthe paper-and-pencil administration, and from .54 to .85 for\nthe Internet administration. Correlations between the two\nlatent dimensions were high in both the paper-and-pencil (r\n= -.71) and Internet (r = -.77) administrations.\nMeasurement invariance. Configural, weak, strong, and strict\ninvariance models produced acceptable fit indices (CFI =\ncriterion, we found no deterioration of fit with the constraints\nof configural, weak, strong, and strict invariance models\n(Table 3). Therefore, we conclude that the Italian FS and\nSPANE obtained strict invariance across the paper-and-pen-\ncil and Internet administration methods.\nCombined sample. Aone-way MANOVAassessed the admin-\nistration method differences for the FS, SPANE-P, and\nSPANE-N scores. The combined dependent variables were\nnot significantly affected by the method of administration,\nences between the administration methods were observed\nwhen separate t tests were performed on the FS, SPANE-P,\nand SPANE-N scores. Therefore, in the following analyses,\nthe two samples were combined. For the total sample, the\naverage FS score was 38.7 (with average item scores ranging\naverage SPANE-N score was 15.27 (with average item scores\nComparison of one- and two-factor models of well-being.

Only the two-\nfactor model SRMR (.065) proved an acceptable fit com-\npared to the one-factor model SRMR (.085). Considering the\n2 difference test, the two-factor model fared better than the\nMaterial Appendix B, Table S2).\nConcurrent validity. Concurrent validity was tested by examin-\ning the correlations between the FS and SPANE scores, on\none side (Table 4), and the scores of the scales reported in\nTable 5, on the other. The correlations between the FS and the\nSPANE-Pscores (r = .69) and between the FS and the SPANE-\nN scores (r = -.48) were medium\u00adhigh. On average, the cor-\nrelations between the FS and the SPANE scores, on one side,\nand the SHS, the PANAS, the SWLS, the PWI, and the SGI\nscores, on the other, were high, thus suggesting a high concur-\nrent validity. A series of Steiger's (1980) z tests (Steiger's\nmodification of Dunn & Clark's, 1969) were performed to\ntest for differences in the magnitude of the correlations\nbetween the FS and the SPANE-P, and the measures of cogni-\ntive components of SWB (SWLS, PWI, SGI). The correlation\nbetween the SWLS and the FS was significantly stronger than\nthe correlation between the SWLS and the SPANE-P, z =\nwas significantly stronger than the correlation between the\nbetween the SGI and the FS was not significantly stronger\nthan the correlation between the SGI and the SPANE-P, z =\ntion than the SPANE-P with the cognitive components of\nwell-being (SWLS, PWI, SGI).\nDiscussion\nThe Italian FS and SPANE showed good reliability and valid-\nity. Internal consistency and factor analysis indicated a unidi-\nmensional structure for the Italian FS and a two-factor\nstructure for the Italian SPANE. The Italian FS and the\nSPANE exhibited medium\u00adhigh positive correlations with\nother SWB measures and with measures of related constructs,\nTable 3.

The stronger cor-\nrelation was between SPANE-N and PANAS-N. However,\ncontrary to our expectations, the SPANE-P was more strongly\nassociated with the SWLS, the SHS, and the SGI, compared\nwith the PANAS-P. This finding could be explained by the\ndifferent conceptualization of the positive affect adopted by\nthe SPANE-P and the PANAS-P, as indicated in the\n\"Measuring Hedonic Affect\" section. Both the FS and the\nSPANE were strongly associated with life satisfaction.\nHowever, the FS showed a stronger association with the cog-\nnitive components of SWB than with the SPANE-P, thus sug-\ngesting that eudaimonic well-being involves affective\ninformation on a less explicit level compared with the SPANE.\nPsychological research data collection has recently moved\ninto the realm of the Internet, and self-report survey-based\ndata collection is increasingly carried out using the Internet,\nas opposed to the traditional paper-and-pencil method. It is\ntherefore important to determine the adequacy of the Internet-\nbased data collection for the measurement instruments under\nexamination. Our results provide evidence of strict measure-\nment invariance across paper-and-pencil and Internet data\ncollection procedures. We thus conclude that the Italian FS\nand SPANE can be administered through the Internet with\ngood (i.e., equivalent to paper-and-pencil) results.\nStudy 2 assessed the discriminant and nomological validity\nof the hedonia and eudaimonia constructs. After controlling\nfor the effect of the unemployed participants' age, we exam-\nined a sample of unemployed individuals and a healthy con-\ntrol group. We performed CFAs for both the groups, and we\ntested metric invariance (i.e., invariance across individual\nfactor loadings). Furthermore, the one-dimensional and the\ntwo-dimensional models of well-being were tested. Finally,\nwe analyzed the discriminant validity of the FS and the\nSPANE by considering the BDI-II and the BAI scales.\nWork is not only a means of economic sustenance, but it\nalso contributes to the definition of the self-image and to the\nconstructionofmeaninginone'slife(Iacovides,Fountoulakis,\nKaprinis, & Kaprinis, 2003). These latter two dimensions are\nimportant in the flourishing conceptualization and, therefore,\nwe expected lower FS scores in the unemployed group than\nin the control group.

We also expected the BAI and\nBDI-II scores to be negatively associated with the FS and\nSPANE-P scores, because they represent the opposite poles\nof the mental health continuum, and to be positively associ-\nated with the SPANE-N scores, because their emotional neg-\native content is in part overlapping (e.g., the \"sad\" and\n\"afraid\" items of the SPANE-N).

The threshold of 35 years was suggested\nby the Italian Institute of Statistics (ISTAT; Istituto Nazionale\ndi Statistica) classification of unemployment ages. This\nunusually high threshold is justified by the particular Italian\nsituation, in which 62.3% of individuals aged between 18\nand 34 years still live with their family of origin, given an\n(ISTAT, 2012).

All participants were\ninformed through written instructions about the anonymity\nand confidentiality of their data.\nMeasures\nTo evaluate the divergent validity of the Italian FS and\nSPANE, we administered the following instruments.\na 21-item, self-rated scale that evaluates key symptoms of\ndepression, including cognitive, emotional, and somatic\naspects. Individual scale items are scored on a 4-point con-\ntinuum (0 = least, 3 = most), with a total summed score range\nof 0 to 63. Higher scores indicate greater depressive severity.\nSuggested guidelines for cutoff scores are less than 14 for no\nor minimal depression, 14 to 19 for mild to moderate depres-\nsion, 20 to 28 for moderate depression, and 29 or higher for\nsevere depression.\ntains 21 items, each describing a symptom of anxiety.\nRespondents rate on a 4-point scale how much they have\nbeen bothered by the symptoms.

Skewness and kurtosis were\nwithin the expected range (Lei & Lomax, 2005).\nEvaluating group differences.A series of one-way ANOVAs\nassessed the group (young unemployed adults, older unem-\nployed adults, control group) differences for the FS, the\nSPANE-P, and the SPANE-N scores. There was a signifi-\ndifference (HSD) tests (p < .05) indicated lower FS mean\nscore for both the young unemployed adults (M = 33.50, SD\n= 9.79). The young and older unemployed groups did not\ndiffer significantly on their FS scores. The three groups dif-\ncantly lower than those for the control group (M = 20.27,\nSD = 5.17), but the young and older unemployed adult\ngroups did not differ significantly from each other. A simi-\nlar result was found for the SPANE-N scores, F(2, 705) =\ncantly lower than those for the control group (M = 15.02,\nSD = 4.48), but the young and older unemployed adult\ngroups did not differ significantly from each other. Given\nthat we found no differences between young and older\nunemployed adults, the subsequent analyses were per-\nformed without distinguishing between them.\nCFAs for FS and SPANE scores. The one-factor solution for the\nFS had acceptable fit indices (Table 7). All items loaded on\nthe latent factor (p < .001), and loadings ranged from .68\nTable 6.

The same pattern of correlations\nwas observed for the SPANE-P, which was more strongly\nassociated with BDI-II than with BAI scores. A similar result\nwas also found by Sumi (2014) in the Japanese validation of\nthe SPANE and by other studies comparing the associations\namong BAI, BDI-II, and PANAS (Ahrens & Haaga, 1993;\nThe FS was more strongly (negatively) associated with\nthe BDI-II than with the BAI scores. A possible interpreta-\ntion of this result can be provided by the different cognitive\ncontents of anxiety and depression (D. A. Clark, Beck, &\nStewart, 1990). Anxious cognitive content is focused on\nphysical or psychological threats, whereas depressive cog-\nnitive content refers to thoughts related to negative self-\nevaluation, hopelessness, and pessimistic view of the world.\nThe cognitive content of depression (more than the cogni-\ntive content of anxiety) may thus be considered to be the\nnegative counterpart of flourishing, which is based on posi-\ntive self-evaluation, optimistic view on the future, and gen-\neral positive view of the life.\nGeneral Discussion\nIt has recently been proposed that the experience of posi-\ntive emotional states (hedonia) and the meaning and devel-\nopment of one's potentials (eudaimonia) represent a single\nwell-being construct, rather than two related dimensions\n(Disabato et al., 2016). However, our results do not support\nthis conclusion. CFAs revealed two correlated factors rather\nthan a single well-being construct. Moreover, the FS\nshowed stronger correlations with measures of the cogni-\ntive components of SWB compared with the SPANE-P.\nThese results also suggest the distinct placement of the con-\nstructs of hedonia and eudaimonia in a nomological net-\nwork of related constructs (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955) and\nsupport their concurrent validity.\nThe previous considerations highlight the importance of\nvalidating the translations of the FS and SPANE in differ-\nent national languages. In this respect, our results indicate\nthat the Italian FS and the Italian SPANE have adequate\npsychometric properties. The FS showed a unidimensional\nfactor structure, whereas the SPANE showed a two-factor\nstructure. Both scales revealed good levels of internal con-\nsistency, homogeneity, and validity. Convergent validity of\nthe Italian FS and SPANE was also well supported. This is\nthe first study, to our knowledge, that has examined the\nproblem of measurement invariance for the FS and for the\nSPANE. MG-CFA indicated that the Italian FS and SPANE\nobtained strict measurement invariance across administra-\ntion methods (paper-and-pencil and Internet) and strong\nmeasurement invariance across groups (unemployed indi-\nviduals seeking work and control group). Such evidence of\nmeasurement invariance thus supports the possibility of\nvalid inferences concerning the FS and SPANE scores\nacross different administration methods and heterogeneous\nsocial groups.\nWe acknowledge some limitations of the current study.\nFirst, test\u00adretest reliabilities of the Italian FS and SPANE\nhave not been assessed. Second, in the assessment of con-\ncurrent validity of Study 1 we did not consider the eudai-\nmonic dimensions of well-being. The association between\nthe Italian FS and SPANE with other dimensions of well-\nbeing thus remains a task for future research. Third, mea-\nsurement invariance for the paper-and-pencil and Internet\nadministration methods of the Italian FS and SPANE might\nbe inflated by the fact that most of the participants were\ncollege students or young adults used to interact with the\nInternet. Fourth, in Study 2 the cognitive component of\nhedonic well-being was not assessed, given that we were\nonly interested in measuring FS and SPANE scores among\nunemployed individuals to evaluate the discriminant valid-\nity with the BAI and BDI-II scores. From this point of\nview, our results corroborate the outcomes of previous\nstudies (e.g., Ahrens & Haaga, 1993; Watson & Kendall,\n1989). Fifth, the Italian translations of the PWI and the\nSGI were only validated as part of a more comprehensive\nstudy on the role of cognitive variables in psychological\ndisorders (Sica, Caudek, Chiri, Ghisi, & Marchetti, 2012).\nSixth, although we found a superior fit for the two-factor\nmodel over the one-factor model of well-being, we\nacknowledge that even the two-factor model does not fit\nthe data well. Therefore, more research on the factor struc-\ntures of the FS and SPANE is required. However, we\nbelieve that the present work provides a valuable starting\npoint for an improved assessment of well-being in the\nItalian language. Finally, in Study 2 we were not able to\ncollect potentially useful information, such as the length of\ntime of unemployment or the distinction between individu-\nals who were unemployed because they were looking for\ntheir first job and individuals who were unemployed\nbecause they lost their job or were laid off.\nIn conclusion, hedonic and eudaimonic motives are both\nimportant for the individual well-being. Whereas eudai-\nmonic motives favor individual growth and meaning con-\nstruction, hedonic motives foster emotional regulation\n(Huta & Ryan, 2010). An assessment of personal well-being\nin all its scope thus requires the consideration of both these\ndimensions.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAhrens, A.
