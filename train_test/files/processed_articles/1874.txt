Approxi-\ndividuals from each survey was invited to attend a morning ex-\namination after fasting overnight. Fully informed consent and\nassent were obtained from all participants and these docu-\nments were approved by the National Center for Health Sta-\ntistic's Institutional Review Board.\nDetails of the NHANES protocol are available elsewhere.15\nBriefly, blood specimens were stored frozen until they were\nshipped to a central laboratory for analysis. Plasma glucose lev-\nels were measured with an enzymatic technique using the hexo-\nkinase/glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase reaction. Whole-\nblood hemoglobin A1c\nlevels were measured using fully\nPrimus Corp, Kansas City, Mo) and boromate affinity high-\nperformance liquid chromatography, serum insulin levels were\nmeasured using a double-antibody radioimmunoassay tech-\nnique, and serum C-peptide levels were measured using a poly-\nethylene glycol\u00adaccelerated double-antibody technique. Height\nwas measured in an upright position with a stadiometer and\nweight was also measured in a standing position on a self-\nzeroing scale. The poverty-to-income ratio, a ratio of family in-\ncome to poverty thresholds established by the US Census Bu-\nreau, was used as a measure of socioeconomic status.\nData from each survey were linked using a unique survey\nparticipant identifier. The full sample consisted of 4370 ado-\nlescents (aged 12-19 years) who were given a personal inter-\nview on diabetes, including use of medications and symptoms\nassociated with diabetes. All subjects were asked the lead-in\nquestion pertaining to history of diabetes: \"Have you ever been\ntold by a doctor or health professional that you have diabetes\nor sugar diabetes?\" Subjects with a missing response (n=1) or\nthose who responded \"borderline\" (n=1) were excluded from\nthe analyses. Thus, the only possible responses were \"yes\" or\n\"no.\" Pregnant women (n=101) and subjects categorized as\n\"other Hispanics\" (n=231) and \"other races, including multi-\nracial\" (n=202) were also excluded from the analyses, the lat-\nter because of inadequate sample sizes for these groups. The\nsubsample consisted of 1496 adolescents with a fasting ( 8\nhours) glucose value recorded and who responded \"no\" to the\nlead-in question on diabetes history. Only subjects who had\ncomplete data were included in the subsample analyses.\nDEFINITIONS\nIn the full sample, subjects who responded \"yes\" to the lead-in\nquestion were further categorized by specific diabetes type. Those\nwho reported using insulin were categorized as having type 1\ndiabetes, and those who reported not using insulin as having\ntype 2 diabetes. Subjects in the subsample with a fasting glu-\ncose level of less than 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) were catego-\nrized as having normal fasting glucose levels, and those with a\nvalue greater than or equal to 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) as hav-\ning impaired fasting glucose levels.16 Using the Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention growth charts for the United States\nin the year 2000, being overweight among adolescents was de-\nfined as having a body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight\nin kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of greater\nthan or equal to the 95th percentile for age and sex; at risk for\nbeing overweight was defined as having a BMI value greater than\nor equal to the 85th percentile but less than the 95th percen-\ntile for age and sex; and normal weight was defined as having\na BMI of less than the 85th percentile for age and sex.17\nData were analyzed using SAS statistical software (version 9.1;\nSAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). The full sample was analyzed us-\ning the 4-year full sample interview weights to estimate means\nand95%confidenceintervals(CIs),andthemaskedvarianceunits\n(pseudoprimary and pseudostratum sampling units) to estimate\nthe standard error of those means. The subsample was analyzed\nusing the 4-year fasting weights and the masked variance units.\nContinuousvariablesarepresentedasmean\u00b1SE.Categoricalvari-\nables are presented as frequency, weighted frequency (based on\nsampling weights), and proportion with 95% CI.

Eighteen subjects in\nthe full sample had self-reported diabetes. Using popu-\nlation-based sample weights, this was equivalent to\nreported diabetes, or 0.5% of all people in this age group.\nThis estimate is reasonable and consistent with the es-\nhave diagnosed diabetes, as reported elsewhere.1\nThe absolute percentage of self-reported diabetes was\nhigher among boys than girls (eg, 54% vs 46%, respec-\ntively), and among non-Hispanic white youth than non-\nHispanic black and Mexican American youth. This pat-\ntern was consistent when self-reported diabetes was\nexpressed as a function of the number of individuals in a\ngiven sex or race with diabetes by the total number of\nindividuals of that sex or race in the population. For\nexample, about 0.53% of all adolescent boys in the popu-\nlation had self-reported diabetes (73 011 cases of self-\nin the population), compared with about 0.48% of all ado-\nlescent girls in the population. Similarly, about 0.56% of\nall non-Hispanic white youth in the population had self-\nnon-Hispanicwhiteyouthinthepopulation)comparedwith\nAmerican adolescents in the population. These percent-\nagesaredifferentamongadults(20years),wherethetotal\nprevalence of diabetes by race/ethnicity is highest among\nnon-Hispanic black adults (11.4%), followed by non-\nHispanic white (8.4%) and Hispanic/Latino adults (8.2%).1\nBy examining information on self-reported diabetes\nand medication use, subjects were further categorized as\nhaving type 1 or type 2 diabetes. In this analysis, 10 sub-\njects with self-reported diabetes were categorized as hav-\ning type 1 diabetes, whereas 8 subjects were categorized\nas having type 2 diabetes. Using population-based sample\nweights, this was equivalent to 95 066 adolescents with\nbetes. Thus, among the US adolescents in the popula-\ntion who have diabetes, 71% have type 1 diabetes and\n29% have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes was once a\ncondition only seen in adults, but this study provides evi-\ndence to support recent clinic-based reports and re-\ngional studies2,3,5,18 that point to an emerging problem of\ntype 2 diabetes among US youth.\nThe absolute percentage of type 1 diabetes was higher\namong boys than girls, while the absolute percentage of\ntype 2 diabetes was higher among girls than boys. About\n78% of all adolescent boys in the population with self-\nlation with self-reported diabetes), and 22% of all ado-\nlescent boys in the population with self-reported diabe-\ntes had type 2 diabetes.

About 76% of all non-\nHispanic white youth in the population with self-\n1 diabetes among non-Hispanic white youth divided by\nreported diabetes), and 24% of all non-Hispanic white\nadolescents in the population with self-reported diabe-\ntes had type 2 diabetes. This is in contrast to 62% of all\nnon-Hispanic black youth in the population with self-\nreported diabetes having type 1 diabetes and 38% hav-\ning type 2 diabetes, and 37% of all Mexican American\nyouth in the population with self-reported diabetes hav-\ning type 1 diabetes and 63% having type 2 diabetes. Thus,\nthe relative percentage of type 2 diabetes is highest among\nMexican American adolescents, followed by non-\nHispanic black and non-Hispanic white adolescents.\nThere were 178 subjects in the subsample who had im-\npairedfastingglucoselevels.Usingpopulation-basedsample\nwith impaired fasting glucose levels, or about 11% of all\npeople in this age group. The number of adolescents with\nimpaired fasting glucose levels in this study is about 9 per-\ncentage points higher than previously reported (1.76%).6\nHowever, at the time of that report the cut-point value for\ndefining impaired fasting glucose levels was 6.1 mmol/L\n(110mg/dL).Themuchhigherprevalenceofimpairedfast-\ning glucose levels in this study was entirely a result of the\nlowered cut-point value. There were only 24 subjects in\nthesubsamplewhohadimpairedfastingglucoselevelswhen\nusing a value of 6.1 mmol/L (110 mg/dL). This was equiva-\nin this age group. Sinha et al7 found that 21% of over-\nweight adolescents aged 11 to 18 years had impaired glu-\ncose tolerance. However, it is important to note that their\nsubjects were at high risk for diabetes, impaired fasting glu-\ncose levels, and/or impaired glucose tolerance as the en-\ntire sample had a BMI at or above the 95th percentile for\nage and sex. Although BMI was not different between the\nnormalandimpairedfastingglucoselevelgroupsinthepres-\nent study when expressed on an absolute basis (ie, 22.8 vs\n23.9, respectively), more than 15% of all adolescents with\ncases of impaired fasting glucose levels among overweight\nin the population) compared with 14.1% who were at risk\nfor being overweight and 9.5% who were normal weight.\nThiswasalsothecasewhenacut-pointvalueof6.1mmol/L\n(110 mg/dL) was used; roughly 2.4% of overweight or at\nrisk for being overweight adolescents had impaired fast-\ning glucose levels compared with 1.1% of normal-weight\nyouth.Thus,impairedfastingglucoselevelsweremorecom-\nmonamongoverweightyouthonarelativebasisinthepres-\nent study, regardless of the cut-point value used. The dis-\ntribution of impaired fasting glucose levels as a function\nof BMI percentile is shown in the Figure.\nImpaired fasting glucose levels were more common\nin boys than girls (14.8% of all boys in the population vs\n7.3% of all girls in the population). In contrast, Fagot-\nCampagna et al6 reported that slightly more girls than\nboys had impaired fasting glucose levels. Impaired fast-\ning glucose levels were more common among Mexican\npaired fasting glucose levels among Mexican American\nlescents in the population) compared with 11.3% of all\nnon-Hispanic white and 7.4% of all non-Hispanic black\nadolescents. These data are consistent with a previous\nreport1 demonstrating large differences in the preva-\nlence of impaired fasting glucose levels among the\nmajor race groups.\nAs expected, there were differences in several physi-\nologic measures of glucose metabolism between adoles-\ncents categorized as having normal or impaired fasting glu-\ncose levels. By definition (as previously mentioned in the\n\"Methods\" section), fasting plasma glucose would have to\nbe different between groups; levels were about 5.0 mmol/L\n(90 mg/dL) in those with normal fasting glucose levels and\n5.8 mmol/L (105 mg/dL) in those with impaired fasting\nglucoselevels.Fastingplasmainsulinlevelswerealsohigher\nin subjects with impaired vs normal fasting glucose lev-\nels. This is consistent with the findings of Weiss et al8 who\nfound significantly higher fasting insulin levels in young\nsubjects with impaired glucose tolerance compared with\nmatched youth with normal glucose tolerance. The im-\npaired glucose tolerance group in that study also exhib-\nited marked insulin resistance (measured by the glucose\nclamptechnique)andhigherfastingC-peptidelevels.Simi-\nlarly in this study, C-peptide levels were higher in the im-\npairedvsnormalfastingglucosegroup.Togetherthesefind-\ningssuggestthatabnormalitiesinglucosemetabolism(that\nmanifest as impaired fasting glucose levels and/or im-\npaired glucose tolerance) in adolescents are primarily ow-\ning to insulin resistance and not an absolute reduction in\n-cell function.\nA few limitations of this study are worth noting.

The sample weights used to calculate popu-\nlation totals in the current NHANES are based on\npopulation estimates that incorporate the US Census Bu-\nreau counts from the year 2000. The population esti-\nmate for US adolescents aged 12 to 19 years in the full\nplied to 4370 subjects. Although this population esti-\nmate is lower than the actual population of US adoles-\non the monthly postcensal civilian noninstitutional popu-\nin this study was estimated after applying several exclu-\nsion criteria.

However, this was the best method of doing so\nbased on the available data in the current NHANES. It\nhas been proposed that approximately 1 in every 400 to\n500 children and adolescents younger than 20 years has\ntype 1 diabetes.1 Based on the results of the present study,\ndiabetes. Thus, type 1 diabetes remains the major con-\ntributor to the diagnosis of diabetes in a pediatric popu-\nlation. Finally, the classification of and prevalence esti-\nmate for impaired fasting glucose levels were determined\nfrom one measurement. Although only subjects who had\nfasted for at least 8 hours were included in this analysis,\nconfirmation of these findings may require an addi-\ntional fasting blood draw and/or an oral glucose toler-\nance test. Despite these limitations, this study does pro-\nvide evidence that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and\nimpaired fasting glucose level is substantial among US\nadolescents. These findings have important implica-\ntions for public health because of the high rate of con-\nversion from impaired fasting glucose level to type 2 dia-\nbetes in adults, and the increased risk of cardiovascular\ndisease among adults with type 2 diabetes. These data\nprovide a compelling rationale for prevention of diabe-\ntes and impaired fasting glucose levels among adoles-\ncents in the US population.\nCorrespondence:  ,\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 (duncag\n@u.washington.edu).\nFunding/Support: This study was funded by a career de-\nvelopment award from the National Institutes of Health\nAuthor Contribution: The author had full access to all\nthe data in the study and takes responsibility for the in-\ntegrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\nREFERENCES\n1.
