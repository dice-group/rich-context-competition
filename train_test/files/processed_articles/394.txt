    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Variation in the use of hospital and physician services among\nMedicare beneficiaries is well documented. However, less is known about\nthe younger, commercially insured population. Using data from the\nCommunity Tracking Study to investigate this issue, we found significant\nvariation in the use of both inpatient and outpatient services across\ntwelve metropolitan areas. HMO insurance reduces, but does not\neliminate, the extent of this variation. Our results suggest that health\nplan spending to better organize delivery systems and manage care may\nbe efficient, and regulations that arbitrarily cap plans' spending on\nadministration, such as minimum medical loss ratios, could undermine\nefforts to achieve better value in health care.\nFor more than twenty years, the Dart-\nmouth Atlas of Health Care has docu-\nmented two striking facts. First,\nMedicare spending and treatment\ndecisions vary greatly across geo-\ngraphic areas, even after differences in benefici-\naries' age, health status, and cost of living are\nadjusted for.1 Second, this variation in the use of\nhealth care resources is not always positively\ncorrelated with variation in quality or health out-\ncomes.2,3 This body of work forms the basis for\nthe view that there are major inefficiencies in\nhealth care delivery.4\nUnanswered Questions\nDespite the importance of this research to health\npolicy, it has left several questions unanswered.\nStudying Broader Populations First, al-\nmost all of the Dartmouth Atlas work has exam-\nined health care resource use by people age sixty-\nfive and older, and a substantial portion focuses\nfurther on chronically ill older adults. Much less\nattention has been paid to the care of relatively\nhealthy, younger people. As Laurence Baker and\ncolleagues have observed, evidence of variations\nin treatment in a broader population of patients\nimply that the opportunities for improving effi-\nciency are even greater than the Dartmouth Atlas\nand associated research suggest.5\nImproving Efficiency Second, although\nexisting work highlights which geographic areas\noffer opportunities for efficiency improvement,\nit generally does not identify a mechanism for\nobtaining such improvements. Knowing which\nareas are high-use is necessary, but not suffi-\ncient, for reducing use in high-use areas. Two\nrecent papers suggest that managed care might\nserve this role.5,6 However, neither explicitly\nquantifies or tests the extent of the effect of man-\naged care on area variation.\nPurpose Of Paper This paper seeks to fill\nthese gaps. We used data from the Community\nTracking Study (CTS) to estimate the extent of\narea variation in inpatient and outpatient ser-\nvices in twelve US metropolitan areas.\nWe found that health maintenance organiza-\ntion (HMO) insurance is associated with reduc-\ntions in variation in medical but not surgical\nhospital admissions, and in emergency depart-\nment but not ordinary physician visits. Interest-\ningly, we also found that HMO insurance\nreduces variation among people under age 45,\nThe People-to-People Health\nFoundation, Inc.\nLaurence C.

Most existing work quantifies the effect\nof such coverage by estimating its effects on mea-\nsures of resource use and health outcomes.8 In-\nvestigating how managed care affects area\nvariations is an alternative approach.\nStudy Data And Methods\nData We used data from the CTS, a large-scale\nlongitudinal survey designed to track health in-\nsurance coverage and use of health services by\nindividual households in sixty US communities.\nTwelve large metropolitan areas, with popula-\nsentative survey samples large enough to draw\nconclusions about each area, were randomly se-\nlected to be studied in depth.9,10\nCommunity Tracking Survey, which included a\nFollowback Survey that provided details about\nthe surveyed population's private health insur-\nance policies.11 We used these early waves be-\ncause the data, although more than a decade\nold, have several unique features that make them\nideally suited to examining the question of area\nvariation. Later waves either do not include a\nFollowback Survey or do not support commu-\nnity-level analyses, or both, and we are not aware\nof any other, more recent data that do.\nThe survey distinguished among four types of\ninsurance: HMO, preferred provider organiza-\ntion, point-of-service, and fee-for-service. We\ngrouped the latter three together as \"unman-\nthan age sixty-five with private insurance, of\nhave unmanaged insurance.\nAnalysis We began our analysis by comparing\nhospital admission rates among people age sixty-\nfive and older in the Community Tracking Sur-\nvey, where data are self-reported, and perhaps\nunderreported, to similar estimates from the\nDartmouth Atlas, which is based on Medicare\nclaims data. The Dartmouth Atlas therefore pro-\nvides a useful validity check of the CTS data, at\nleast for elderly beneficiaries.\nWe found that the correlation between the\nnumber of hospital admissions per elderly Medi-\ncare beneficiary--excluding those in Medicare\nAdvantage plans--in the twelve CTS commun-\nities and the number of admissions per person\nfor these twelve areas reported in the Dartmouth\nAtlas for 1999 is high (correlation coefficient\nvery close: Weighted by population, the mean\nrate of hospitalization is 0.377 in the CTS data\nand 0.340 from the Dartmouth Atlas data.\nThe remainder of our analysis focused on pri-\nvately insured people younger than age sixty-\nfive. We measured area variation with the coef-\nficient of variation--the ratio of the standard\ndeviation across areas of the use of a health ser-\nvice, such as hospital admissions per capita, to\nthe mean. Higher values of the coefficient of\nvariation imply more variation.\nOne important feature of the coefficient of\nvariation is that it measures the spread of a dis-\ntribution without regard to the units in which the\ndistribution is denominated (for example, days\nin the hospital, number of physician visits). For\nthis reason, it is comparable across different\ntypes of services. We calculated the coefficient\nof variation of four types of services: surgical\nhospital admissions (admissions for a surgical\nprocedure), medical hospital admissions (ad-\nmissions for reasons other than a surgical pro-\ncedure), physician office visits, and emergency\ndepartment (ED) visits.\nFor each type of service, we compared the\ncoefficient of variation for people with HMO in-\nsurance to that of people with unmanaged insur-\nance. For all four services, the coefficient of\nvariation for people with HMO insurance was\nlower than that for people with unmanaged in-\nsurance. Then, we formally tested whether varia-\ntion in use across areas differed between the two\ngroups. For two of the four services, we found the\ndifference in coefficients of variation to be sta-\ntistically significant.\nStudy Results\nExhibits 1\u00ad3 present the extent to which area\nvariation in four measures of utilization differs\nfor people younger than age sixty-five who have\nunmanaged versus HMO insurance.13 Each point\non each exhibit represents the average number\nof admissions or visits per person in one study\narea, adjusted for differences across areas in\nrace, sex, age, and household income.14\nIn exhibit Notes, we report the coefficient of\nvariation across areas and the mean level of use\nfor people with each type of insurance. Because\nthe CTS is only a sample, estimates of the coef-\nficient of variation for people with unmanaged\nversus HMO insurance may differ as a result of\nchance variation rather than of true differences\nin the underlying populations. To enable readers\nto evaluate whether estimated differences are\nstatistically significant--that is, not due to\nchance--we report p values from hypothesis tests\nof the equality of coefficients of variation be-\ntween people with each type of insurance.15\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The exhibits show that more area\nvariation exists among people with unmanaged\nthan HMO insurance in both medical and surgi-\ncal admissions.\nThe coefficient of variation of the rate of medi-\ncal hospital admissions for people with unman-\naged insurance is 0.294; for those with HMO\ninsurance, it is less than half as great (0.142).\nThe coefficients of variation of the rate of surgi-\ncal admissions are closer together (Exhibit\nWe rejected the hypothesis of equality of coef-\nficients of variation across insurance types at\nconventional significance levels for medical ad-\nmissions (p \u00bc 0:027), but not surgical admis-\nEmergency Department Visits Exhibit 3\nshows the analogous statistics for the number\nof emergency department visits. Among people\nwith unmanagedinsurance, thereis significantly\ngreater variation across areas in outpatient ser-\nvices use. As above, we rejected the hypothesis of\nequality of coefficients of variation across insur-\nance types at conventional levels (p \u00bc 0:016).\nInteresting Regularities Although the sys-\ntematic differences in area variation across in-\nsurance status are striking, Exhibits 1\u00ad3 also\nreveal other interesting regularities in the sourc-\nes and types of area differences in patterns of\ncare. First is the extent to which the Miami met-\nropolitan area is an outlier in hospital use\n(Exhibit 1). Indeed, for people with unmanaged\nprivate insurance, the per capita medical hospi-\ntal admission rate in Miami (0.139) is almost\ntwice as great as the next-highest area, Cincin-\nSecond, even though HMO coverage does re-\nduce variation in the use of services across areas,\nit does not come close to eliminating it. For ex-\nample, among people with unmanaged insur-\nance, the number of ED visits per person in\nthe highest-use community, Boston, is almost\ndouble thenumber in thelowest-usecommunity,\nSeattle. But even among people with HMO in-\nsurance, the number of ED visits in the highest-\nuse community, again Boston, is still 69 percent\nlarger than the number in the lowest-use com-\nmunity, Syracuse.\nThird, although areas that are high-use on\none dimension are in some cases high-use on\nothers--such as Boston, which ranks persist-\nently high on the use of all four services--overall,\nthe ordering of areas by utilization rates is not\nvery consistent across measures.

Correlations between area rankings\nof service use for people with HMO insurance\nshow a similar pattern.\nPhysician Visits We also analyzed the extent\nof variation across areas in the number and level\nof physician visits (results available in the Online\nAppendix).16 We found that people with unman-\naged insurance had greater variation in physi-\ncian visits across areas (coefficient of variation\ndifference between those with unmanaged and\nHMO insurance was not statistically significant\n(p \u00bc 0:139).

Medicare admission rates are pos-\nitively correlated, and more strongly, with ad-\nmission rates for people under age sixty-five\nwith unmanaged insurance ( \u00bc 0:40). These re-\nlationships are consistent with HMO coverage\nhaving a causal effect on the extent of variation.\nThe area variation of younger people with un-\nmanaged insurance--that is, insurance resem-\nbling fee-for-service Medicare--looks like the\narea variation for Medicare beneficiaries. In con-\ntrast, the area variation of younger people with\nHMO insurance does not.\nExhibit 5 presents results that suggest how\nHMO coverage reduces area variation. It\npresents coefficients of variation for each of\nthe four measures of use that we studied, by\npatient age group and insurance type. Reduc-\ntions in area variation associated with managed\ncare are concentrated mainly among younger\npeople. For three of the four measures, people\nyounger than age forty-five with HMO insurance\nhave statistically significant lower coefficients of\nvariation across areas (p < 0:10) than the same\nage group with unmanaged insurance. In con-\ntrast, there are no statistically significant differ-\nDiscussion\nPrior research has documented dramatic differ-\nences across geographic areas in the intensity of\nmedical treatment received.1 This work, how-\never, has focused on the aged Medicare popula-\ntion and people with chronic illnesses. It has also\nnot explicitly evaluated whether and how man-\naged care affects geographic variations.\nNew Findings We present three new findings.\nFirst, there is significant variation across areas,\neven among a relatively healthy commercially\ninsured population under age sixty-five. Second,\nHMO insurance reduces the extent of this varia-\ntion but does not eliminate it. Third, the effect of\nmanaged care on variation seems to come\nthrough the younger segment of this population.\nThis is important because younger people tend\nto be in better--and less variable--health than\ntheir older peers,19 so variation in the younger\nsubpopulation is less likely to be attributable to\ntheir underlying medical conditions.\nLimitations Our study has two important lim-\nitations. First, the data that we used are more\nthan a decade old. Second, those data did not\nallow us to identify the consequences of area\nvariation for health outcomes. If the greater\nhealth services intensity in high-use areas leads\nto better health or to greater benefits for patients\nthrough some other path, then reduction in\nvariation--and, by implication, the role of man-\naged care--might not be socially beneficial.\nHowever, as other researchers have observed,\nfinding significant geographic area variation in\nmedical care invites closer scrutiny of what is\ncausing the variation. Differences across areas\nin utilization that are not associated with pop-\nulation characteristics or quality of care are\nlikely to behallmarks of an inefficienthealth care\nsystem. The fact that the reduction in variation\nthat we observed came through the effects of\nVariation In Use Of Four Types Of Health Services Among People Younger Than Age 45 And Ages 45\u00ad64 With Unmanaged\nAnd HMO Insurance\nYounger than age 45 (coefficient of variation) Ages 45\u00ad64 (coefficient of variation)\nUnmanaged HMO p value of difference Unmanaged HMO p value of difference\nMedical (non-surgical) hospital admissions\nSurgical hospital admissions\nPhysician office visits\nEmergency department visits\nFollowback Surveys.

They suggest\nthat health plans' expenditure of resources to\nbetter organize delivery systems and manage\ncare may be efficient; this is consistent with\nthe findings from other recent work on area var-\nTo the extent that this is true, regulations that\narbitrarily cap plans' spending on administra-\ntion, such as minimum medical loss ratios,21\ncould end up being socially harmful if they have\nthe effect of restricting beneficial management\nand administration activities. (Editors' note: As\nof publication of this article, however, the Na-\ntional Association of Insurance Commissioners,\nat the request of the secretary of health and hu-\nman services, has proposed language in the\nforthcoming federal regulation governing medi-\ncal loss ratios that would classify such activities\nas \"expenses to improve health care quality,\" and\ntherefore not administrative. It is unknown\nwhether or not this classification will govern\nthe final regulation, or whether there may still\nbe ongoing uncertainty as to the appropriate\nclassification of such activities.)\nOur results also suggest that the managed care\nbacklash of the 1990s, and the subsequent shift\ntoward more unmanaged insurance in the pri-\nvate sector, may inadvertently have perpetuated\nthe problem of inefficient area variation.\nAlthough our results do not imply that HMO\ncoverage alone is the answer--we did still ob-\nserve variation even for patients with HMO cov-\nerage--policy reforms that support the use of\nhighly managed care may be an important part\nof the solution to the area-variation puzzle. \nDaniel Kessler gratefully acknowledges\nresearch support from the National\nInstitute on Aging through the National\nBureau of Economic Research.\nNOTES\n1 Fisher ES, Wennberg DE, Stukel TA,\nGottlieb DJ, Lucas FL, Pinder EL.
