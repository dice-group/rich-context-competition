Felt obligation to help others as a protective factor against losses in psychological well-being following functional decline in middle and later life. Journal of Gerontology:\n\u00a9 The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.\n \nSCHOLARS have posited a variety of psychosocial re-\nsources that can facilitate an individual's adaptation to\nsuch as having a strong sense of control and receiving\nsocial support. This study aimed to extend understanding\nof psychosocial resources that promote psychological\nwell-being in the face of declining functional health\nby examining a factor that previous scholarship has not yet\naddressed--felt obligation to help others. This study used\nMidlife in the United States (MIDUS) to investigate felt\nobligation to help others across two domains of social re-\nlationships (close others and society) as buffers against\nlosses in psychological well-being following functional\ndecline in middle and later life. This study also examined\nwhether associations among functional decline, felt obligation\nto help others, and psychological well-being vary by age.\nFelt Obligation to Help Others as a Psychosocial\nResource in the Face of Functional Decline\nFelt obligation refers to perceiving that one is expected to\nbehave in particular ways toward others (Rossi & Rossi,\n1990), with one type of behavior constituting helping others\n(Stein, 1992). Felt obligation to help others can be concep-\ntualized as an aspect of altruism, which is a broader con-\nstruct referring to a motivational state directed toward\nenhancing others' welfare (Batson, 1991). Despite a grow-\ning body of research on altruism and individual well-being\n(Post, 2005), there has been less attention to how an orienta-\ntion toward helping others might be particularly important\nfor adults facing particular conditions of adversity, such as\ndeclining functional health.\nRecent theorizing on compassionate love--as a genuine\nconcern for the welfare of others with intentions to alleviate\ntheir suffering and to promote their flourishing (Underwood,\n2009)--offers preliminary insights regarding processes\nthrough which greater felt obligation to help others can\nserve as an asset in the face of functional decline. First,\nqualitative studies have found that experiences of compas-\nsionate love oftentimes involve a strong, potentially spiri-\ntual, sense of connection to others (Mastain, 2006; Monroe,\nperiences might include connecting with a religiously iden-\ntified transcendent and can also involve a more general view\nof one's self as connected to all humanity (Mastain, 2006).\nBeing able to perceive one's self as part of a larger, mean-\ningful life whole might facilitate individuals' ability to tran-\nscend their own physical self when faced with functional\ndecline and help them to continue to derive feelings of\nmeaning, growth, and a positive sense of self in relationship\nto others despite functional decline.\nAnother aspect of compassionate love involves individu-\nals' valuing others at a fundamental level (Mastain, 2006;\nThis quality manifests itself in valuing the human worth of\nall individuals--regardless of their needs for assistance--\nand recognizing the imperfections of being human (Monroe).\nValuing others at a fundamental level further involves defin-\ning oneself and others beyond their functional contributions\nto society (Underwood, 2002). Perhaps having such a per-\nspective can help individuals better accept themselves when\nFelt Obligation to Help Others as a Protective Factor\nAgainst Losses in Psychological Well-being Following\nFunctional Decline in Middle and Later Life\nEmily A. Greenfield\nSchool of Social Work and Institute for Health, Health Care Policy, and Aging Research, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey,\nNew Brunswick.\nThis study examined felt obligation to help others in two domains (close others and society) as protective factors\nagainst losses in psychological well-being following functional decline. Lagged-dependent regression models were\nestimated using data from 849 respondents aged 35\u00ad74 years and without any functional limitations at baseline in\nthe 1995\u00ad2005 National Survey of Midlife in the United States. Greater felt obligation to help close others pro-\ntected against declining self-acceptance in the face of more severe functional decline, and greater felt obligation to\nhelp society protected against declining personal growth and self-acceptance. Greater felt obligation to help close\nothers and society protected against increasing depressive symptoms at younger ages in adulthood. Findings sug-\ngest the importance for additional research on how aspects of altruism can promote psychological adaptation to\ndeclining functional health in middle and later life.\nKey Words: Altruism--Compassionate love--Disability--Resilience--Social relationships--Social responsibility.\nGREENFIELD\nfaced with limitations of their own through declining func-\ntional health.\nFinally, experiences of compassionate love often involve\na universalistic orientation that advocates for society to af-\nford all people fundamental rights, such as freedom and\nreported that individuals who helped targeted others to sur-\nvive and escape Nazi-dominated Europe emphasized the\nimportance of applying standards of equity and justice to all\nhuman beings and of helping others even when such assis-\ntance was likely to be unreciprocated. When individuals\nface circumstances that make them more dependent on\nothers, such as declining functional health, having a strong\nbelief in humanity's fundamental responsibility for the\nbasic well-being of all others might prepare them to more\ncomfortably accept being the recipient of other people's\ncare and concern.\nFunctional Decline, Psychological Well-being, Felt\nObligation to Help Others, and Age\nAlthough much research on functional decline and psy-\nchological well-being has focused on older adults (e.g.,\nLenze et al. 2001), functional decline is a salient phenome-\nnon to examine at earlier periods of adulthood as well. Pre-\nvious work suggests that particular sociodemographic\nsubgroups are more likely to experience functional decline\nearlier in the adult lifespan, including members of racial/\nethnic minority groups, women, and adults with lower so-\ncioeconomic status (Cleary, Zaborski, & Ayanian, 2004;\nKim & Miech, 2009). Furthermore, with increasing rates of\nobesity and associated health problems, scholars predict\nthat indicators of morbidity--such as declining functional\nhealth--are likely to become increasingly common at ear-\nlier periods of adulthood (Sturm, Ringle, & Andreyeva,\n2004). Moreover, longstanding lifespan developmental the-\nories suggest age-related changes in individuals' orientation\nto the welfare of others (see, McAdams, 2001, for a discus-\nsion). Taken together, this scholarship suggests the impor-\ntance of examining whether associations among functional\ndecline, felt obligation to help others, and psychological\nwell-being vary by age.\nA Multidimensional Perspective on Psychological Well-being\nMuch research on the psychological consequences of de-\nclining functional health has examined depressive symp-\ntoms (Bruce, 2001). Recent conceptualizations of mental\nhealth, however, suggest that mental ill-being is not synony-\nmous with well-being (Keyes, 2002). Accordingly, in addi-\ntion to examining increasing negative moods and emotions\nas a potential consequence of declining functional health,\nthis study also considers two other aspects of well-being\nthat address more positive aspects of well-being. These two\ndimensions include personal growth (feelings of continued\ngrowth and development as a person) and self-acceptance\n(positive evaluations of one's self and one's past life; Ryff\n& Keyes, 1995). Theorizing on concern for others as a foun-\ndation for continued growth and development in adulthood\n(Maslow, 1971), as well as for the acceptance of one's self\n(Underwood, 2005), suggests the importance of examining\nthese particular dimensions of psychological well-being.\nHypotheses\nBuilding from the above-reviewed scholarship, this study\nexamined the following hypotheses (H) and research ques-\ntions (RQ):\nH1:Adults who experience more severe functional decline\nwill report greater losses in psychological well-being than\nadults who experience less functional decline. H2: Adults\nwho report greater felt obligation to help others (close\nothers and society) will report fewer losses in psychologi-\ncal well-being than adults who report less felt obligation to\nhelp others. H3: Reports of greater felt obligation to help\nothers will beneficially moderate problematic associations\nbetween more severe functional decline and greater losses\nin psychological well-being.\nRQ1: Do associations between functional decline and\npsychological well-being vary by age? RQ2: Do associa-\ntions between felt obligation to help others and psycho-\nlogical well-being vary by age? RQ3: Does the extent to\nwhich greater felt obligation to help others protect against\nlosses in psychological well-being following more severe\nfunctional decline vary by age?\nMethod\nThis study used data from the National Survey of Midlife\nin the U.S. (MIDUS). The MIDUS national probability\nsample included English-speaking, noninstitutionalized\nadults who were between the ages of 25 and 74 years in\ndom digit dialing. Once a household was recruited into the\nstudy, a participant from the household was randomly se-\nlected, with older adults and men oversampled to ensure an\nadequate distribution on the cross-classification of age and\ngender. At T1, respondents were asked to complete a 30-\nmin telephone survey, followed by a lengthier self-adminis-\ntered, mail-back questionnaire. A total of 3,024 in the\nMIDUS national probability sample responded to both the\ntelephone survey and self-administered questionnaire\nfollow-up telephone survey and self-administered question-\nrespondents who participated in both the telephone survey\nand self-administered questionnaire at T1 who had not been\nconfirmed deceased as of December, 2005). For a detailed\ntechnical report regarding the MIDUS study, see http://mid\nmac.med.harvard.edu./tech.html.\nTo limit this study's sample to respondents in middle and\nlater life (Moen & Wethington, 1999), the analytic subsam-\nple was restricted to respondents who were at least 35 years\nold at T1, which excluded 306 respondents. To conduct pro-\nspective analyses regarding the psychological consequences\nof declining functional health, the analytic subsample was\nfurther restricted to respondents who reported no functional\nlimitations at T1 (which excluded an additional 593 respon-\ndents; see measure of functional decline subsequently).\nThese restrictions yielded a total sample size of 849 respon-\ndents. About one third of the analytic sample at T1 was be-\nMeasures\nNegative affect.--A six-item scale new to the MIDUS\nwas used to measure respondents' experiences of negative\nmood and emotion, or negative affect (Mroczek & Kolarz,\n1998). In the self-administered questionnaires at T1 and T2,\nrespondents were asked how much of the time during the\npast 30 days they felt: (a) so sad nothing could cheer them\nup, (b) nervous, (c) restless or fidgety, (d) hopeless, (e) that\neverything was an effort, and (f) worthless. Respondents re-\nported their experiences with each of these indicators using\na 5-point scale (1 = all of the time; 5 = none of the time).\nScores on items were reverse coded and averaged such that\nhigher scores indicated more negative affect.

Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for this and all\nother analytic variables.\nPersonal growth and self-acceptance.--The self-\nadministered questionnaires at T1 and T2 included indices to\nassess personal growth and self-acceptance (Ryff & Keyes,\nmeasurement index on psychological well-being, construct-\ning items based on theories of optimal human development\nand mental health. Respondents reported the degree to which\nthey agreed or disagreed with statements on a seven-point\ncontinuum. A sample item for the measure of personal\ngrowth included \"For me, life has been a continuous process\nof learning, changing, and growth.\" A sample item for the\nmeasure of self-acceptance included \"When I look at the\nstory of my life, I am pleased with how things have turned\nout.\" Out of consideration for survey instrument length,\nthree-item scales were used at T1 and seven-item scales were\nused at T2. Scores across items for each subscale were aver-\naged such that higher scores indicated more personal growth\nor self-acceptance.

To allow for this study's prospective, longi-\ntudinal design, respondents who reported any degree of\nlimitation at T1 were excluded from the analytic sample.\nAmong remaining respondents, scores across the five items\nat T2 were reverse coded and averaged such that higher\nscores indicated more severe functional decline between T1\nand T2.

Measures of felt obligation in these two\ndomains were collected by employing Rossi's (2001) indi-\nces of normative obligation to close others and society.\nThese items, which were included only at T1 of the survey,\nassess the strength of respondents' internalized norms to\nhelp others at some expense to themselves.\nRespondents were introduced to the items as a list of\n\"hypothetical situations\" and were asked to \"rate how\nmuch obligation you would feel if they happened to you\nusing a 0 to 10 scale where 0 means `no obligation at all'\nand 10 means `a very great obligation'.\" Items assessing\nfelt obligation to help close others included the following:\n(a) to drop your plans when your children seem very trou-\nbled; (b) to drop your plans when your spouse seems very\ntroubled; (c) to take a friend into your home who could\nnot afford to live alone; (d) to give money to a friend in\nneed, even if this made it hard to meet your own needs; (e)\nto raise the child of a close friend if the friend died; and\n(f) to take your divorced or unemployed adult child back\ninto your home. Items assessing felt obligation to help so-\nciety included the following: (a) to pay more for your\nhealth care so that everyone had access to health care, (b)\nto volunteer time or money to social causes you support,\n(c) to collect contributions for heart or cancer research if\nasked to do so, and (d) to vote for a law that would help\nothers worse off than you but would increase your taxes.\nCronbach's alphas for the indices regarding felt obliga-\ntion to close others and to society were .80 and .81, re-\nspectively, and the correlation between scores on the two\nSociodemographic variables and other covariates.--\nGiven findings from previous studies indicating that a vari-\nety of sociodemographic factors are associated with\nfunctional decline (e.g., Zimmer & House, 2003), felt obli-\ngation to help others (e.g., Marks & Song, 2009), and psy-\nchological well-being (e.g., Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998; Ryff\n& Keyes, 1995), this study included measures of several so-\nciodemographic variables as covariates in multivariate models\n(see Data Analytic Sequence). These measures--which were\nassessed at T1--included a continuous variable for respon-\ndents' age, a dichotomous variable for gender, a multicate-\ngorical variable for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White,\nAfrican American, Latina/o, and other race/ethnicity), a\nmulticategorical variable for educational attainment (less\nmeasure of household income, a dichotomous variable for\nmarital status (married vs. not), a dichotomous variable for\nemployment status (employed vs. not), and a dichotomous\nmeasure for parental status (has at least one biological or\nadopted child vs. not).\nFurthermore, to investigate associations between felt\nobligation and psychological well-being net of other psy-\nchobehavioral and childhood factors associated with felt\nobligation (Rossi, 2001) and functional limitations (e.g., Li\n& Ferraro, 2006), as well as psychological well-being (e.g.,\nMusick & Wilson, 2003), this study included an additional\nset of statistical controls measured at T1. These variables\nincluded a continuous measure of respondents' frequency\nof religious service attendance (1 = never; 4 = more than\nonce a week), a dichotomous measure indicating whether\nrespondents engaged in formal volunteer work within the\npast year, and a continuous measure of respondents' contact\nwith friends and family outside of their household (0 = never\nor hardly ever; 7 = several times a day). Scores on two ad-\nditional scales were used to measure personality character-\nistics that have been found to be correlated with felt\nobligation, including a five-item index of agreeableness\n(Cronbach's alpha = .81) and a five-item index of agency\nnally, this study included statistical controls for respon-\ndents' retrospective reports of three aspects of their\nchildhood family background (Rossi), including a four-item\nindex regarding the extent to which their mothers and fa-\nthers were generous toward others (e.g., \"How generous\nand helpful was [your mother] to people outside the fam-\nily?\"; Cronbach's alpha = .75), a 12-item index of mothers'\nand fathers' affection toward respondents in childhood (e.g.,\n\"How much love and affection did [your mother] give you?\";\nCronbach's alpha = .91), and a four-item index of mothers'\nand fathers' use of rules (e.g., \"How strict was [your mother]\nwith rules for you?\"; Cronbach's alpha = .81).\nData Analytic Sequence\nThis study estimated a series of ordinary least squares\n(OLS) models to examine its hypotheses and research ques-\ntions. Each of the T2 measures of psychological well-being\n(negative affect, personal growth, and self-acceptance) was\nregressed on the complete block of covariates, as well as on\nthe corollary measure of psychological well-being at T1.\nScores on psychological well-being, functional decline,\nage, and felt obligation to help close others and society were\nstandardized at their means for ease of interpretation. OLS\nmodels employed listwise deletion for missing data; no\nmore than 2% of the analytic sample was missing on any\none variable, and less than 10% of the sample was missing\nacross all variables.\nTo test H1 regarding more severe functional decline as a\nrisk factor for losses in psychological well-being, as well as\nH2 regarding linkages between higher levels of felt obliga-\ntion and psychological well-being, Model 1 was estimated\nin which each dimension of psychological well-being was\nregressed on functional decline between T1 and T2 as well\nas on felt obligation to help close others and society. To ex-\nplore RQ1 and RQ2 regarding potential age differences in\nthese associations, additional models were estimated that\nadded each two-way interaction term, including Age \u00d7\nFunctional limitations (Model 2), Age \u00d7 Felt obligation to\nhelp close others (Model 3), and Age \u00d7 Felt obligation to\nhelp society (Model 4). To test H3 regarding felt obligation\nas a protective factor against associations of risk between\nfunctional decline and more rapidly declining psychologi-\ncal well-being, Models 3 and 4 also included two-way inter-\naction terms between functional decline and each of\nmeasures of felt obligation. To explore RQ3, Models 5 and\n6 were estimated that added three-way interaction terms\namong functional decline, age, and each respective measure\nof felt obligation to help others. To interpret the highest or-\nder statistically significant interaction terms, predicted\nscores were calculated for estimated average change in the\ngiven aspect of psychological well-being among relevant\nsubgroups of respondents. The baseline model included re-\nspondents in the reference categories on categorical mea-\nsures of covariates and at the sample mean on continuous\nmeasures of covariates.\nResults\nFunctional Decline and Psychological Well-being\nModels 1 in Tables 2\u00ad4 indicate that respondents who\nreported more severe functional decline between T1 and T2\nalso reported greater increases in negative affect (b = .25,\np < .001), greater decreases in personal growth (b = -.11,\np < .001), and greater decreases in self-acceptance (b =\nfor statistically significant interaction terms between func-\ntional decline and age (for negative affect, b = -.04, ns;\nfor personal growth, b = -.00, ns; and for self-acceptance,\nb = .04, ns). In summary, these results provide consistent\nevidence that functional decline is a risk factor for greater\nlosses in psychological well-being (H1), and results provide\nno evidence that such associations differ by age (RQ1).\nFelt Obligation to Help Others and Psychological\nWell-being\nModels 1 in Tables 2\u00ad4 provide no evidence of associa-\ntions between greater felt obligation to help close others at\nT1 and change in any of the three dimensions of psycho-\nlogical well-being (for negative affect, b = .04, ns; for\npersonal growth, b = -.00, ns; and for self-acceptance,\nb = -.03, ns). Moreover, reports of greater felt obligation\nto help society also were not associated with change in any\nof the three dimensions of psychological well-being (for\nnegative affect, b = -.05, ns; for personal growth, b = .06,\nns; and for self-acceptance, b = .01, ns). Furthermore,\nModels 3 and 4 in Tables 2\u00ad4 provide no evidence for sta-\ntistically significant two-way interaction terms between\nage and felt obligation to help close others (negative affect,\nb = -.01, ns; personal growth, b = .04, ns; and self-acceptance,\nb = .01, ns), nor evidence for statistically significant inter-\naction terms between age and felt obligation to help soci-\nety (negative affect, b = .02, ns; personal growth, b = .01,\nns; and self-acceptance, b = -.04, ns). In summary, these\nresults provide no evidence that felt obligation to help oth-\ners is associated with changes in psychological well-being\n(H2), as well as no evidence that such associations differ\nby age (RQ2).\nFelt Obligation to Help Others as a Protective Factor\nModels 3 and 4 in Tables 2\u00ad4 display results regarding\nfelt obligation to help close others, as well as to society, as\nprotective factors against more rapidly declining psycho-\nlogical well-being in the face of functional decline. Al-\nthough the interaction of Functional decline \u00d7 Felt\nobligation to help close others did not achieve statistical\nsignificance in the model for self-acceptance (b = .05, ns),\nthe interaction did achieve statistical significance in the\nmodel for negative affect (b = -.07, p < .05, but note the\nthree-way age interaction reported subsequently) and per-\nsonal growth (b = .06, p < .05). Moreover, the interaction of\nFunctional decline \u00d7 Felt obligation to help society did not\nachieve statistical significance in the model for negative af-\nfect (b = -.05, ns, but note the three-way age interaction\nreported subsequently), but the interaction did achieve sta-\ntistical significance in models with respect to personal\nModels 5 and 6 in Tables 2\u00ad4 display results with respect\nto RQ3 regarding the influence of age on the extent to which\ngreater felt obligation to help others protects against losses\nin psychological well-being in the face of more severe func-\ntional decline. The three-way interaction among age, func-\ntional decline, and felt obligation to help close others\nachieved statistical significance in the model for negative\naffect (b = .07, p < .05), but not in the models for personal\ngrowth (b = .02, ns) or self-acceptance (b = -.06, ns). Simi-\nlarly, the three-way interaction among age, functional de-\ncline, and felt obligation to help society also achieved\nstatistical significance in the model for negative affect\n(b = .07, p < .05), but not in the models for personal growth\n(b = .02, ns) or self-acceptance (b = -.06, ns).\nFigures 1 and 2, respectively, display predicted scores re-\ngarding the three-way interactions that achieved statistical\nsignificance in Models 5 and 6 for negative affect. Both fig-\nures indicate that among adults one standard deviation be-\nlow the sample mean on age (i.e., adults aged 40 years at\nT1) and with lower levels of felt obligation to help close\nothers or society, a standard deviation increase in functional\ndecline was associated with nearly a half of a standard de-\nviation greater predicted increase in negative affect.

Results provided evidence in support of felt\nobligation to help society as a protective factor against\nlosses in personal growth and self-acceptance, as well as\nfelt obligation to help close others as a protective factor\nagainst losses in personal growth. Also, younger adults re-\nported a smaller increase in negative affect following more\nsevere function decline if they reported greater felt obliga-\ntion to help close others and/or society.\nThis evidence for felt obligation to help others as a pro-\ntective factor against losses in psychological well-being fol-\nlowing greater functional decline supports expanded\nconceptualizations of ways in which social relationships\ncan influence individuals' psychological well-being. A\nlongstanding body of work has addressed the mental health\nbenefits of receiving others' support, particularly during\ntimes of stress (Uchino, 2004). Parallel to this area of re-\nsearch, a more recent body of scholarship has emerged re-\ngarding the potential mental health benefits of giving support\nto others (e.g., Liang, Krause, & Bennett, 2001; Thoits &\nHewitt, 2001). Findings from this study suggest the impor-\ntance of continuing to examine ways in which aspects of\naltruism, such as felt obligation to help others, can promote\npsychological well-being not only among adults in general\nbut also particularly among those adults confronting par-\nticular challenges, such as declining functional health (for\nother examples, see Brown, Brown, House, & Smith, 2008;\nFindings from qualitative studies on experiences of com-\npassionate love provide insights on processes through which\nfelt obligation can protect against losses in psychological\nwell-being following functional decline, such as by encourag-\ning individuals' sense of connection and a universalistic orien-\ntation(Underwood,2002).Theorizingonhowmorebehavioral\naspects of altruism--such as formal volunteering--promote\npsychological well-being has largely addressed other, yet re-\nlated, factors, including self-efficacy and self-esteem (Thoits\n& Hewitt, 2001). Studies that employ more refined measures\nof various and theoretically informed aspects of altruism, as\nwell as of psychosocial factors linking these aspects to psy-\nchological well-being, and that use data analytic techniques to\nmodel these factors as being related-yet-distinct from each\nother can help to better specify the complex causal pathways\namong various aspects of altruism, other psychosocial factors,\nfunctional health, and psychological well-being.\nThis study also tested for age differences in its focal associa-\ntions. Results indicated that felt obligation to help close others\nand/or society served as stronger protective factors against\nincreasing negative affect following functional decline among\nyounger adults. This finding, in part, is consistent with classic\ndevelopmental theorizing, which suggests that concern for the\nwelfare of others--particularly concern for future genera-\ntions--is particularly salient in midlife relative to earlier and\nlater periods of the life course (e.g., Erikson, 1950). Neverthe-\nless, empirical evidence regarding the extent to which concern\nfor others is most central in midlife has been mixed (see\nMcAdams, 2001, for a review). This study's finding of some\nage-associated differences in the protective effects of felt obli-\ngation to help others suggests continued focus on lifespan con-\ntexts that might alter ways in which functional decline and\nvarious dimensions of altruism are associated with psychologi-\ncal well-being. The finding of a weaker protective effect with\nincreasing age, specifically in terms of negative affect and not\npersonal growth or self-acceptance, suggests the importance of\nconsidering multiple dimensions of psychological well-being\nwithin lifespan research on altruism and well-being.\nFigure 2.

SD = standard\nMidlife in the United States.\nDespite this study's evidence for felt obligation to help\nothers as a protective factor against losses in psychological\nwell-being following functional decline, several of its fea-\ntures limit the extent to which conclusions can be drawn.\nFirst, this study draws on theorizing on compassionate love\nto specify processes through which felt obligation to help\nothers might buffer against losses in psychological well-\nbeing following functional decline.Accordingly, additional\nstudies that utilize direct measures of compassionate love\n(see Fehr & Sprecher, 2009, for an example) are necessary\nto examine the extent to which aspects of compassionate\nlove account for the protective effects found and to advance\nunderstanding of processes underlying these associations.\nAlso, because the measure of felt obligation was included\nonly at the first wave of the survey, this study was not able\nto account for potentially dynamic changes in felt obliga-\ntion, which might, in part, be a function of changes in psy-\nchological well-being and functional health. Similarly,\nbecause functional health was assessed only at the begin-\nning and end of a 10-year interval, this study was unable to\ninclude a more nuanced measure of dynamic trajectories of\nfunctional limitations and psychological well-being. (The\n10-year interval between measurement occasions might\nalso help to account for the relatively small sizes of associa-\ntions among functional decline, felt obligation to help oth-\ners, and psychological well-being.) Overall, research that\ncollects measures of functional health, felt obligation, and\npsychological well-being at multiple time points is neces-\nsary for better understanding the sequencing of causal pro-\ncesses linking these experiences. An additional limitation is\nthe potential for nonrandom response at T1 of the survey, as\nwell as nonrandom attrition across the 10-year study period,\nto bias estimates of population parameters (Acock, 2005).\nDespite these limitations, this study suggests the impor-\ntance of additional research on how felt obligation to help\nothers and other aspects of altruism can protect against losses\nin psychological well-being following functional decline.\nFor example, although previous research has identified pre-\ndictors of aspects of altruism within the U.S. adult population\nas a whole (Smith, 2009), studies are necessary to understand\nprocesses toward orientations to help others among individu-\nals with impaired functional health. Additional studies are\nalso necessary to identify the potentially complex processes\nthrough which felt obligation to help others promotes psy-\nchological well-being in the face of functional decline--par-\nticularly at diverse ages throughout adulthood. Advancing\nsuch understanding can help better inform efforts to optimize\nlife quality among adults with functional impairments.\nCorrespondence\nAddress correspondence to Emily A.
