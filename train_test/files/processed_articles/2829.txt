Even though classic theory postulates that utility-\nmaximizing investors greatly benefit from holding well-diversified portfolios of risky\nassets, evidence on real-life investment decisions paints a different picture. In particular,\nrecent research suggests that investors not only eschew foreign shares (home bias puz-\nzle), butin addition to thistilt their domestic stockholdings towards locally head-\nquartered companies. This phenomenon of disproportionately overweighting nearby\nfirms has been dubbed local bias in the literature and has proved robust across a variety\nof countries and for private and institutional investors alike.\nYet, while the presence of local bias among investors is undisputed by now, academ-\nics still struggle to explain its causes thoroughly. Why do investors tilt their portfolios\ntowards local stocks? Given that local bias (a) constitutes one of retail investors' most\nfundamental deviations from what textbook models claim about optimal asset allocation\nand (b) has been shown to be strong enough to move markets, finding answers to this\nquestion is relevant for several reasons.\nSeveral contributions to the local bias literature suggest that households' overweight\nin geographically close stocks reflects informed (i.e. rational) investment decisions\nwhich is based on an information advantage in evaluating nearby companies (informa-\ntion hypothesis).\nYet, empirical evidence on informational advantages as the trigger for investors' lo-\ncal bias is mixed and a variety of studies indicate that local bias, quite on the contrary, is\nactually detrimental to investor welfare. If this is the case, understanding the root cause\nof local bias is particularly important since it provides the basis for reducing the welfare\ncosts of this investment mistake. As such, a number of studies in the field soften or even\nreject the information hypothesis and instead advocate that local bias is the result of\ninvestors' preference to invest in the familiar. However, due to the lack of a comprehen-\nsive analytical framework, these studies cannot explain exactly how investors' familiari-\nty with an asset actually affects local bias.\nFollowing a theoretical concept by Boyle et al (2011), this paper investigates whether\nlocal bias can be explained when incorporating familiarity towards stocks (and issuing\ncompanies) as an additional dimension to the information-based portfolio selection\nprocess. Our research is based on the Security Deposits Statistics maintained by\nDeutsche Bundesbank which collects the common stockholdings of retail customers at\nGerman regional banks on a security-by-security basis and allows specifying the geo-\ngraphical proximity between investor and company headquarters.\nWe find that, indeed, private households in Germany significantly overweight nearby\nstocks and show that this result is robust across a number of different breakdowns.\nSecond, we investigate whether the observed portfolio locality is information-\ndriveni.e. generates positive alphaand conclusively reject the notion of a `home-\nfield advantage' for German individual investors. Finally, we test key propositions of\nthe framework of investor familiarity developed by Boyle et al. (2011). Our data clearly\nconfirms their hypotheses with regard to overinvestment in the familiar and empirically\nsupport a flight to familiarity during financial crises. In sum, our results suggest that\nincluding investors' ambiguity aversion towards the available assets in the asset alloca-\ntion problem contributes to explaining local bias among individual investors.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nIn dieser Studie untersuchen wir die Bedeutung des eigenen Standorts f\u00fcr die Anlage-\nentscheidungen privater Aktieninvestoren. Obwohl die klassische Portfoliotheorie be-\nsagt, dass ein Nutzen maximierender Investor in hohem Ma\u00dfe von einem gut diversifi-\nzierten Portfolio riskanter Wertpapiere profitiert, zeigt sich bei der Untersuchung tat-\ns\u00e4chlich get\u00e4tigter Investitionen ein anderes Bild. So offenbaren neuere Studien, dass in\nden Depots privater Anleger nicht nur ausl\u00e4ndische Aktien unterrepr\u00e4sentiert sind (ho-\nme bias), sondern diese dar\u00fcber hinaus auch bei ihren inl\u00e4ndischen Aktieninvestments\nsolche Unternehmen \u00fcbergewichten, die sich im unmittelbaren Umkreis ihres Wohnorts\nbefinden. Dieses Ph\u00e4nomen der \u00dcbergewichtung lokal ans\u00e4ssiger Unternehmen im\nPortfolio inl\u00e4ndischer Aktienanlagen wird in der Literatur als local bias bezeichnet und\nkonnte empirisch f\u00fcr eine Vielzahl von L\u00e4ndern sowie f\u00fcr sowohl private als auch insti-\ntutionelle Investoren nachgewiesen werden. W\u00e4hrend das Vorliegen eines solchen local\nbias in der Literatur mittlerweile unbestritten ist, stellt sich weiterhin die Frage nach\neiner umfassenden Erkl\u00e4rung f\u00fcr diese Verhaltensanomalie.\nEinige Beitr\u00e4ge zur einschl\u00e4gigen Literatur sehen in der \u00dcbergewichtung lokaler Ak-\ntien informierte (d.h. rationale) Anlageentscheidungen. Sie gehen von einem Informati-\nonsvorsprung bei der Bewertung lokaler Aktieninvestments aus. Allerdings ist die empi-\nrische Evidenz f\u00fcr Informationsvorteile als Ursache des local bias nicht eindeutig. So\nzeigt eine Vielzahl anderer Studien, dass sich Anleger durch die \u00dcbergewichtung loka-\nler Unternehmen systematisch schlechter stellen. Dieser zweite Literaturstrang stellt die\nInformationshypothese in Frage und argumentiert, dass der local bias letztlich auf eine\nPr\u00e4ferenz des Anlegers zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren ist, in das Bekannte und Vertraute zu investie-\nren. Aufgrund eines fehlenden umfassenden analytischen Rahmens konnten diese Stu-\ndien bislang allerdings nicht kl\u00e4ren, inwiefern die Vertrautheit eines Investors mit einer\nAnlage den zu beobachtenden local bias beeinflusst.\nAufbauend auf einem theoretischen Konzept von Boyle et al. (2011) ber\u00fccksichtigt\ndie vorliegende Studie neben dem informationsbasierten Ansatz auch die Vertrautheit\ndes Anlegers mit der fraglichen Aktie (bzw. dem zugrundliegenden Unternehmen) zur\nErkl\u00e4rung des local bias. Unsere Untersuchung basiert auf der Depotstatistik der Deut-\nschen Bundesbank, die die Aktienbest\u00e4nde von Privatanlegern bei deutschen Regional-\nbanken erhebt und es erlaubt, die r\u00e4umliche N\u00e4he zwischen Anleger und dem Sitz der\nAktienunternehmen zu spezifizieren.\nUnsere Ergebnisse belegen, dass deutsche Privathaushalte lokal ans\u00e4ssige Unterneh-\nmen systematisch und deutlich \u00fcbergewichten. Eine umfassende Analyse der mit den\nAktien lokaler bzw. r\u00e4umlich entfernter Unternehmen erwirtschafteten Renditen zeigt\nau\u00dferdem, dass die These eines ,,Heimvorteils\" f\u00fcr lokale Anleger verworfen werden\nmuss (Informationshypothese). Schlie\u00dflich pr\u00fcfen wir einige der zentralen Thesen des\nvon Boyle et al. (2011) entwickelten Modells zur Rolle von Vertrautheit f\u00fcr Investoren.\nHier best\u00e4tigen unsere Ergebisse deren Hypothesen, dass Privatanleger einerseits ver-\ntraute Wertpapiere \u00fcbergewichten und dass sich andererseits in Krisenphasen ein flight\nto familiarityalso eine noch st\u00e4rker ausgepr\u00e4gte \u00dcbergewichtung in vertraute Ak-\ntienbeobachten l\u00e4sst.\nZusammenfassend legen unsere Ergebnisse damit nahe, dass die Ber\u00fccksichtigung\neiner Vertrautheitskomponente bei der Aktienportfoliozusammensetzung einen ent-\nscheidenden Beitrag zur Erkl\u00e4rung des local bias bei Privatanlegern leistet.\nContents\n1 Introduction and related research .............................................................................. 1\n2 Data and descriptive statistics ................................................................................... 5\n2.1 Data ............................................................................................................................. 5\n2.2 Descriptive statistics ................................................................................................. 7\n3 Do German individual investors exhibit a local equity preference? ......................... 8\n3.1 Assessing the locality of investors' stockholdings ............................................... 8\n3.2 Results.......................................................................................................................10\n4 Testing the information hypothesis: Do German individual investors yield\nexcess returns on their local stock investments?..................................................... 13\n4.1 General intuition......................................................................................................13\n4.2 Methodology............................................................................................................14\n4.3 Results.......................................................................................................................16\n5 Testing the familiarity hypothesis: Investor ambiguity aversion and local bias ..... 19\n5.1 General intuition......................................................................................................19\n5.2 Methodology............................................................................................................20\n5.3 Results.......................................................................................................................21\n6 Conclusion............................................................................................................... 23\nList of Figures\nFigure 1: Geographical distribution of German individual investors and public\nlimited companies .......................................................................................... 29\nFigure 2: Changes in local bias among German individual investors during the\nsample period................................................................................................. 30\nFigure 3: Local bias of German individual investors under changing market\nconditions....................................................................................................... 31\nList of Tables\nTable 1: Summary statistics of sampled investor portfolios, custodian banks,\nand companies................................................................................................ 32\nTable 2: Locality of German individual investors' stockholdings............................... 34\nTable 3: Locality of German individual investors' stockholdings, by investor\nlocation and index status................................................................................ 35\nTable 4: Portfolio performance of German individual investors' stockholdings\n(Holdings-based portfolios, 3-month returns)................................................ 36\nTable 5: Portfolio performance for investor quartiles formed on local bias levels\n(Holdings-based portfolios, 3-month returns)................................................ 37\nTable 6: Portfolio performance of German individual investors' stockholdings\n(Transactions-based portfolios, 12-month returns)........................................ 38\nTable 7: Impact of changes in stock market uncertainty on change in local bias\nlevels among German individual investors.................................................... 39\nTable 8: Market performance and local bias among German individual investors ..... 40\nTable 9: Variation in local bias changes across German individual investors............. 41\nHome-field advantage or a matter of ambiguity aversion?\nLocal bias among German individual investors\n1 Introduction and related research\nThis paper investigates the role individual investors' geographic location plays in their equity\ninvestment decisions. Even though classic theory postulates that utility-maximizing investors\ngreatly benefit from holding well-diversified portfolios of risky assets, evidence on real-life\ninvestment decisions paints a quite different picture. In particular, recent research suggests\nthat investors not only eschew foreign shares1, butin addition to thistilt their domestic\nstockholdings towards locally headquartered companies. This phenomenon of disproportio-\nnately overweighting nearby firms has been dubbed local bias in the literature and has proved\nrobust across a variety of countries and for private and institutional investors alike.2\nYet, while the presence of local bias among investors is undisputed by now, academics still\nstruggle to explain its causes thoroughly. Why do investors tilt their portfolios towards local\nstocks? Finding answers to this question is relevant for several reasons.\n Corresponding author: Markus Baltzer, Deutsche Bundesbank, Wilhelm-Epstein-Strasse 14, 60431 Frankfurt\nam Main, Germany, markus.baltzer@bundesbank.de.\nOscar Stolper, University of Giessen, Department of Financial Services, Licher Strasse 74, 35394 Giessen,\nGermany, Oscar.stolper@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de.\nAndreas Walter, University of Giessen, Department of Financial Services, Licher Strasse 74, 35394 Giessen,\nGermany, andreas.walter@wirtschaft.uni-giessen.de.\nThe authors would like to thank the staff of the Bundesbank Statistics Department and especially Markus\nAmann and Matthias Schrape for supporting us with the relevant data.

The authors are exclusively responsible for any remaining\nerrors and inaccuracies.\n1 This puzzle is referred to as home bias. See Karolyi and Stulz (2003) for a review of the home bias literature.\n2 Ivkovic and Weisbenner (2005) and Seasholes and Zhu (2010) find that local stocks are overrepresented in the\nequity portfolios of U.S. discount brokerage clients. Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001) provide qualitatively simi-\nlar evidence for private households in Finland, Massa and Simonov (2006) and Bodnaruk (2009) document\nthat Swedish individual investors overweight firms with geographically close premises, and Feng and Sea-\nsholes (2004) point to a local bias among Chinese retail investors. Coval and Moskowitz (1999) show that,\nwhile less pronounced in magnitude, local bias is also observed among U.S. fund managers.\nOn the one hand, local bias has been shown to be strong enough to move markets. Recent-\nly, Korniotis and Kumar (2009) show that stock returns feature a predictable local component.\nLikewise, Hong et al. (2008) identify an `only-game-in-town effect' in the presence of locally\nbiased investors, which characterizes a negative relation between the density of firm domi-\nciles within a given region and the stock price levels of a company headquartered in that re-\ngion. Finally, Loughran and Schultz (2004) and Jacobs and Weber (2010) show that a prefe-\nrence for local equity among investors also has a significant impact on firm-level turnover. In\nsum, this evidence implies that identifying the reasons behind local bias may improve under-\nstanding the market impact of geography.\nOn the other hand, local bias is equivalent to an under-diversification of risky assets and as\nsuch constitutes one of retail investors' most fundamental deviations from what textbook\nmodels claim about optimal asset allocation. Under-diversification has been identified as a\nmajor challenge in household finance since it is assumed to have widespread effects on\nhousehold welfare.3 Interestingly enough, however, the direction in which portfolio concen-\ntration affects investors' welfare is subject to an active debate briefly outlined in the follow-\ning.\nLocal bias and informational advantages\nSeveral contributions to the local bias literature suggest that households' overweight in geo-\ngraphically close stocks reflects informed (i.e. rational) investment decisions. One common\napproach to measure the informativeness of investment decisions is to analyze investors' port-\nfolio performance. The general idea is that, if investors' preference for nearby stocks is driven\nby locally generated value-relevant information, the value of that information should be re-\nflected in an excess return of their local holdings. Related studies assume real information\nasymmetries between local and remote investors and argue that information is more readily\navailable for local stocks. This allows local investors to form more accurate expectations\nabout the prospects of those stocks, thereby exploiting an information advantage in evaluating\nnearby companies (information hypothesis). Indeed, several authors including Feng and Sea-\n(2009) find that households' local stock investments outperform their non-local ones. Note\nthat in these studies, local bias is not tantamount to a violation of mean-variance portfolio\n3 See Campbell (2006) for a detailed discussion of this facet of household finance.\noptimization. They argue that the increased portfolio risk incurred through the regional focus\nis rewarded by a superior performance of the local stockholdings.\nLocal bias and a preference for the familiar\nHowever, empirical evidence on informational advantages as the trigger for investors' local\nbias is mixed and a variety of studies indicate that local bias, quite on the contrary, is actually\ndetrimental to investor welfare. If this is the case, understanding the root cause of local bias is\nparticularly important since it provides the basis for reducing the welfare costs of this invest-\nment mistake. In a recent contribution, Seasholes and Zhu (2010) re-estimate the findings of\nIvkovic and Weisbenner (2005) using identical data and present diametrically opposed evi-\ndence of significant underperformance for U.S. households' local equity investments. In an\nearlier study, Huberman (2001) shows that shareholders of regional phone companies in the\nU.S. tend to live in the area served by the company. He argues that exploiting an information-\nal advantage essentially involves rebalancing one's portfolio in a timely manner. Yet, his data\nsuggests that investors tend to buy and hold the familiar stocks, a behavior which is inconsis-\ntent with trading on information. Similarly, Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001) state, that if inves-\ntors make money by exploiting information, then those investors with superior information\nprocessing abilities should realize higher excess returns. However, in an earlier study, Grin-\nblatt and Keloharju (2000) find that portfolio performance among Finnish investors is inverse-\nly related to investor sophistication and thus conjecture that local bias is unlikely to be driven\nby information.4 Zhu (2002) finds that the local bias of retail investors decreases with grow-\ning advertisement expenditures of the companies they hold in their portfolios. He figures that\nthis is driven by selective attention rather than relevant information being delivered. Related\nresults have been obtained by Ackert et al. (2005), who indicate that local bias cannot be as-\nsociated with real information asymmetries but rather with the simple fact that companies\nclose to home are recognizable. In an experimental analysis, they show that investors with an\notherwise identical information set perceive themselves to be more knowledgeable about\nstocks in companies whose name they recognize, and subsequently overweight these securi-\nties.\nAll these studies soften or even reject the above-mentioned information hypothesis and in-\nstead advocate that local bias is the result of investors' preference to invest in the familiar.\n4 Barber and Odean (2000) document similar evidence for U.S. households.\nHowever, due to the lack of a comprehensive analytical framework, these studies cannot ex-\nactly explain how investors' familiarity with an asset actually affects local bias.\nA comprehensive approach\nThis paper investigates whether local bias can be explained when incorporating familiarity as\nan additional dimension to the portfolio selection process. To this end, we rely on a frame-\nwork of familiarity established by Boyle et al. (2011), who build on the classic Markowitz\nmodel but allow investors to have different degrees of ambiguity across assets. This leads to a\nportfolio selection setting in which investors choose from a universe of familiar (where little\nrelative ambiguity pertains) and unfamiliar securities. Assuming ambiguity aversion, the\nmodel imposes that investors optimize over risk, return, and familiarity. The resulting portfo-\nlio composition features some interesting deviations from the Markowitz-type portfolio and\noffers novel, empirically testable implications. First, the optimal portfolio is biased towards\nfamiliar assets. Second, the fraction of familiar assets increases in times of economic uncer-\ntainty, an effect which Boyle et al. (2011) call `flight to familiarity'.\nUsing geographic proximity as a proxy for familiarity towards an asset, we examine\nwhether this framework of familiarity is able to explain local bias among German individual\ninvestors. Before we do so, however, we ask if German households overweight nearby stocks\nat all5, and examine whether this investment behavior is nevertheless consistent with mean-\nvariance portfolio optimization, i.e. if informational advantages may be the underlying reason\nfor local bias. In order to answer these questions, we study the Securities Deposits Statistics\nmaintained by Deutsche Bundesbank which collects the common stock investments of retail\ncustomers at German regional banks on a security-by-security basis and allows specifying the\ngeographical distance between investors and company headquarters.\nWe find that, indeed, private households in Germany significantly overweight nearby\nstocks and show that this result is robust across a number of different breakdowns. Second,\nwe apply comprehensive performance analysis to investigate whether the observed portfolio\nlocality is information-driveni.e. generates positive alphaand conclusively reject the no-\ntion of a `home-field advantage' for German individual investors. Finally, we test key propo-\nsitions of the framework of investor familiarity developed by Boyle et al. (2011). Our data\n5 While not the principal objective of their work, Dorn and Huberman (2005) report that equity holdings of\nclients of a German online broker are locally biased; also, the research of Hau (2001), Dorn et al. (2008), and\nJacobs and Weber (2010) points to a local equity preference among German investors. Yet, as of now, there is\nno comprehensive investigation of the local bias phenomenon among German individual investors.\nclearly confirms their hypotheses with regard to overinvestment in the familiar and empirical-\nly support a `flight to familiarity' during financial crises. Taken together, our results suggest\nthat including investors' ambiguity aversion towards the available assets in the asset alloca-\ntion problem contributes to explaining local bias among individual investors.\nThe remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data set. In\nsection 3, we introduce a measure of portfolio locality which we apply to private households'\ndomestic stockholdings. In section 4, we run a performance analysis to test whether the ob-\nserved portfolio locality is a result of superior information about geographically close stocks.\nSection 5 examines whether ambiguity aversion, on the contrary, explains investors' local\nbias. Section 6 concludes.\n2 Data and descriptive statistics\nThe database for this study is compiled from several sources. Our primary data set consists of\nmandatory filings of German commercial banks for the period from December 2005 to De-\ncember 2009. Each bank in Germany is required to report the aggregate quarterly sharehold-\nings of its retail customers on a security-by-security basis. This stock data is part of a centra-\nlized register of security ownership across a variety of asset classes and investor groups main-\ntained by the Deutsche Bundesbank for the Securities Deposits Statistics (henceforth SecuS-\nFor an investigation of investor locality, we restrict our securities sample to domestic\ncommon stocks held by German private households at commercial banks. We confine the\nuniverse of reported equities to shares of publicly listed companies headquartered in Germa-\nny. The resulting sample comprises 1,317 different common stocks issued by 1,109 different\ncorporations and effectively represents the entire universe of publicly listed companies in\nGermany.\nUnlike most other economies, Germany still builds upon a three-pillar commercial banking\nsystem which consists of private banks, public savings banks and credit cooperatives. The\nlatter two sectors have traditionally focused on providing access to banking services for the\n6 For a technical documentation of this database, see Amann et al. (2011).\nlocal population.7 This distinctive feature provides us with the opportunity to geographically\ndemarcate their respective business spheres. We thus further narrow our sample to SecuStat\nfilings of savings banks and credit cooperatives. In the case of savings banks, an institution's\noutreach is typically bound to the local district it is located in. Generally, it is not possible for\nsavings banks to expand their activities into another institution's business sphere.8 Analogous-\nly, cooperative banks have a mandate to promote their (local) members, and thus are also re-\ngionally bounded. Since data about the business areas of German credit cooperatives is not\navailable, we define a cooperative bank's headquarter as the geographic center of its business\ndistrict.9 While we do not know the exact location of each private investor, we are reasonably\nsure that customers of a certain savings or cooperative bank reside nearby the respective insti-\ntution: A virtually identical portfolio of products and services within the respective banking\npillars does not provide any incentive for a customer to choose a remote institution when\nthere is a local one available. Consequently, they will pick the local bank for convenience,\nand we assume that the holdings which a savings or cooperative bank reports, stem from local\ncustomers. Following the approach of Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001), we define the zip code\narea of the bank as the geographic center of its associated pool of investors.10 Throughout the\npaper, we will refer to corresponding aggregations of private clients' stockholdings at the\nbank level as `(individual/private) investor' and `(private) household', respectively.11 A de-\ncentralized organizational structure of the two banking pillars together with nationwide geo-\ngraphic penetration leads to a high density of independent savings and cooperative banks in\nthe German market.12 Specifically, the resulting data set covers nearly 94% of all German\n8 Until 2005, local districts typically incurred the guarantor liability of their respective regional savings bank.\nSince then, banks' geographic outreach has not changed materially.\n10 Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001) use the center of the municipality in which the investor resides as the starting\npoint for their distance calculations.\n11 Seasholes and Zhu (2010) mention that studying investor-level portfolios elevates the impact of small stock\npositions and easily biases overall results; see section 4.2 for further details. In order to overcome potential\ndistortions, they form portfolios which aggregate the value-weighted shareholdings of many individual inves-\ntors at the zip code level, which is essentially what we do.\n12 Conrad et al. (2009) investigate regional variation of sector-specific bank outreach to retail customers in Ger-\nmany and find that branch, deposit, and loan penetration is higher for public savings banks and credit coopera-\ntives as compared to private banks.\ncommercial banks (1,715 out of 1,830 independent reporting entities during the period under\nWe match the quarterly domestic equity holdings from the SecuStat database with compa-\nny-specific information on returns and free float market capitalization as well as index mem-\nbership obtained from Datastream. Also, we make use of information provided by the Open-\nGeo Database to translate the postal codes of investors and firm headquarters into latitudinal\nand longitudinal coordinates.\n2.2 Descriptive statistics\nSummary statistics for the sampled households and companies are reported in Table 1, while\nFigure 1 plots their geographic distribution across Germany. We include the domestic share-\nholdings of nearly 6 million private households throughout Germany.14 Panel A of Table 1\npresents basic characteristics of the average household portfolios constructed from our sam-\nple. Overall, the mean (median) value of direct investments in common stock of companies\nheadquartered in Germanyi.e. domestic stockduring the period under review adds up to\nEUR 7,183 (EUR 6,289). Depositors living in urbanized areas of Germany account for rough-\nly 75% of all portfolios under review and feature higher average amounts of domestic stock\ninvestments than those in rural areas.15 Interestingly, regardless of the proximity to an urban\ncenter, the average percentage of domestic stockholdings remains virtually identical at about\n19% of households' total portfolio value across all asset classes. Considerable heterogeneity\nin the value of domestic stockholdings is however observed when comparing households in\nthe Western states to those in the New L\u00e4nder. For the New L\u00e4nder, the mean portfolio frac-\ntion held in domestic stocks declines by almost 75% to EUR 1,800 or 8.4% of average total\nportfolio value. In addition, stockholders living in the New L\u00e4nder constitute only 7.6% of all\nportfolios under review, while the region is home to more than 16% of the German popula-\n13 Note, however, that savings banks and credit cooperatives cover only roughly 36% of the total German stock\nmarket capitalization held by domestic private households.\n14 This approach differs from other local bias studies such as Ivkovic and Weisbenner (2005), Dorn and Huber-\nman (2005), and Seasholes and Zhu (2010), among others, who infer their findings from studying the clients\nof a single discount brokerage house.\n15 Areas with above-median (below-median) population density are referred to as urbanized (rural). The neces-\nsary data is derived from a joint research data center run by the Federal Statistical Office and the Federal Min-\nistry of Transport, Building, and Urban Development (INKAR), which collects respective items on an annual\nbasis.\ntion.16 Taken together, however, these figures indicate that German individual investors are\nless geographically concentrated than private investors in other European countries.17\nFigure 1 and Table 1, Panel B, reveal that banks, as well, are much less densely distributed\nin the New L\u00e4nder. Only 8.5% of the sampled institutions have their premises in East Germa-\nny. This uneven spread is largely driven by the disproportionately low presence of coopera-\ntive banks, which make up nearly 75% of institutions in the full sample. Moreover, the\nrightmost column of Panel B of Table 1 provides some information with regards to the bank-\nlevel aggregations of households' portfolios employed in our subsequent analyses. On aver-\nage, each bank in the sample reports the securities holdings of 3,401 private households.18\nFinally, the map plotted in Figure 1 suggests that a considerable number of the firms sam-\npled in our study cluster in only a handful of agglomeration areas, while the rest of the coun-\ntry is rather sparsely populated with company domiciles. Yet, with more than half of the 1,109\ncompanies in the sample headquartered outside the ten biggest cities (Panel C of Table 1),\nGermany still appears to be more evenly industrialized than other countries for which similar\nempirical studies exist.19\n3 Do German individual investors exhibit a local equity preference?\n3.1 Assessing the locality of investors' stockholdings\nTo start off, we require a distance threshold with which to classify shares that are local to a\ngiven investor, i.e. issued by a company which is local to the investor's home. Following the\nstandard approach by Coval and Moskowitz (2001), we categorize each stock within 100 ki-\nlometers of an investor's zip code area as a local stock; shares beyond this radius are referred\nto as remote or nonlocal stocks. While it can be argued that a radius of 100 kilometers is an\narbitrary threshold, we replicate our results for a number of different radii and find that they\n17 For instance, Bodnaruk (2009) reports that as much as 60% of the households analyzed in his study live in the\nthree largest Swedish cities. Similar proportions apply to studies conducted in Finland, cf. Grinblatt and Kelo-\n18 Seasholes and Zhu (2010), who apply the same technique, on average aggregate the holdings of 120 house-\nholds at the zip code level; see section 4.2 of this paper for further details.\n19 Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001), for instance, report that as much as two thirds of all sampled firms in their\nstudy are domiciled in the city of Helsinki.\ndo not change materially. Therefore, we stick to the radius of 100 kilometers in the following,\nwhich makes our results more easily comparable.\nIn order to obtain the geographic distance between households and companies, we translate\nthe postal codes of each investor and each company headquarters20, respectively, into latitudes\nand longitudes (measured in degrees). Using the conventional formula, we then compute the\nlinear distance\n,\ni j\ndist in kilometers between investor i and stock j as:\n,\narccos{cos( )cos( )cos( )cos( )\ncos( )sin( )cos( )sin( )\nsin( )sin( )}\n=\n+\n+ \ni j i i j j\ni i j j\ni j\ndist lat lon lat lon\nlat lon lat lon\nr\nlat lat\n,\nwhere lat and lon denote the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates of the sampled investors\nand companies, and r is the radius of the earth (6,378 kilometers). Occasionally, investor and\ncompany headquarters share a common zip-code. In such cases, instead of assigning a zero-\ndistance, we use one quarter of the linear distance between the pertaining zip code and the\nclosest neighboring postal area. This convention follows Thomas and Huggett (1980) and has\nbeen stated customary in geographic science. Next, each stock j is assigned a weight\n,\nBM\nj t\nw\nwhich corresponds to the total value of its readily available shares relative to the free float\nmarket capitalization across the aggregate of sampled stocks at the end of the reporting period\nt (last day of the respective quarter);\n,\nBM\nj t\nw may be interpreted as the weight of company j in the\nfloat-adjusted market portfolio.21 Moreover, we define act\ni, j,t\nw as the actual fraction of stock j in\ninvestor i's portfolio at time t. We are interested in the total fraction of local investments for\neach investor i. To this end, we sum up the weights act\ni, j,t\nw for all stocks j within 100 kilometers\nfrom investor i's place of residence at time t. Specifically, we calculate:\n\n i\nact act\ni,t i, j,t\nj N\nsh = w\n,\n20 Ideally we would like to compute the linear distance between the investor and the closest branch or sub-sidiary\nof the company considered (cf., for instance, Bodnaruk (2009) and Massa and Simonov (2006)). Yet, the ne-\ncessary data is unavailable and we are encouraged by Massa and Simonov (2006, p. 652) reporting that \"the\nresults [for either of the two alternative approaches] do not differ and the variables are highly collinear\".\n21 The full market capitalization of domestic stocks also contains those assets which are not freely tradable due\nto controlling shareholders and as such do not represent actual investment opportunities for individual share-\nholders. We use the free float market capitalization of the sampled companies to exclude the holdings of con-\ntrolling shareholders when constructing our benchmark portfolios.\nwhere i\nN denotes the number of stocks located within 100 kilometers of investor i's place of\nresidence. As can be seen from section 2, however, the number of local investment opportuni-\nties varies greatly with the local area in which the investor is at home. Hence, we also com-\npute the total fraction of available investments for each investor by summing up BM\nj,t\nw for all\ncompanies headquartered within 100 kilometers of investor i's home at time t:\n\n i\ni,t j,t\nj N\nsh = w\n,\nwhich is then subtracted from the fraction, the household actually invests locally. The differ-\nence between these two percentages yields our local bias metric\nact BM\ni,t i,t i,t\nLB = sh - sh\n,\nThis measure represents the extent to which an investor holds stocks of locally domiciled\ncompanies in excess of what she would invest locally if she held the market portfolio.\nTable 2 reports empirical evidence on the degree to which an average German household's\nportfolio composition deviates from the benchmark of locally available investments. Panel A\nprovides an intuitive approach to assessing the local equity preference by comparing an aver-\nage investor's distance (in kilometers) from her actual portfolio versus the market portfolio\nwhich consists of all stocks in the sample.22 The rightmost column reports the difference be-\ntween the two distances and gives a first indication as to whether households actually tilt their\nequity portfolios towards local companies. During the 17 quarters under review, the average\nindividual investor holds stocks which are 255.1 kilometers away from her place of residence,\nwhile the distance to the market portfolio amounts to 290.5 kilometers. Hence, she invests in\nstocks which are 35.4 kilometers closer than the benchmark, pointing to a substantial over-\nweight of local companies.\nBasic breakdown\nPanel B of Table 2 displays the results for the local bias metric derived in section 3.1. The\naverage fraction of stock investments in companies headquartered within 100 kilometers of a\ngiven household amounts to 20.1%, whereas the mean share of the market portfolio within\nthis radius is 11.8%. Thus, our data documents a substantial local bias of 8.3% for the period\n22 For a detailed description of this measure, see Coval and Moskowitz (1999).\nunder review. This is less than the 13% excess local holdings among Norwegian households\nreported by Doskeland and Hvide (2011) and the 14% local bias for U.S. retail investors do-\ncumented by Seasholes and Zhu (2010).23 Interestingly, however, the inter-country difference\ndoes not appear to stem from households' actual holdingsat 19.6%, Seasholes and Zhu\n(2010), for instance, find a virtually identical fraction of locally invested stockbut instead\nfrom differing benchmark levels. This is intuitive, since in the U.S., the mean market capitali-\nzation within a range of 100 kilometers represents much less of the country's aggregate mar-\nket capitalization than in Germany.\nNext, we check for the robustness of the basic breakdown. Specifically, we consider the\npossibility that our findings are essentially the result of households residing in certain regions\nand invested in certain stocks.\nLocal bias and investor location\nIt is conceivable that local bias is a phenomenon which is essentially driven by the area in\nwhich the investor lives. Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001), for instance, provide empirical evi-\ndence that individual investors located in rural regions exhibit a particularly strong bias to-\nwards local companies. Thus, to confirm the robustness of our results with respect to investor\nlocation, we construct subsamples according to the population structure of the household's\nlocal area (urbanized versus rural). Panel A of Table 3 reports the corresponding numbers and\nreveals that the average local bias for residents of urbanized areas (9.7%) is even higher than\nfor households living in rural areas (5.8%). Consequently, we are confident that our findings\nregarding the local bias extend to households living in both urbanized and rural areas.\nMoreover, as discussed above in section 2.2, the geographical distribution of individual in-\nvestors shows considerable variation between East and West Germany. Thus, we replicate the\nanalysis for the subsamples of households in the Western states and the New L\u00e4nder and\nshow that households in the New L\u00e4nder exhibit much less of a local equity preference than\nthose residing in the Western states (2.9% as compared to 8.8%). Yet, even for the investors\nfrom the Eastern part of Germany, the average deviation of local stock investments from the\nCAPM-efficient allocation is still highly significant. One way to rationalize the higher local\nbias levels in urban versus rural areas and West Germany as compared to East Germany\n23 These two studies employ the same local bias measure as we do. Qualitatively, our results are corroborated by\na number of other studies using alternative metrics, including Huberman (2001), Grinblatt and Keloharju\n(2001), and Ivkovic and Weisbenner (2005), whose results also document significant local bias among indi-\nvidual investors.\nmight involve considering the heterogeneous geographical distribution of companies through-\nout Germany (see section 2.2). Company clusters in agglomeration areas provide local inves-\ntors with significantly better diversification opportunities in their nearby environment than,\nsay, a single company in a rural East German area does. While the benchmark portfolio ob-\nviously requires a much smaller investment in local stocks in rural, less industrialized parts of\nEast Germany, it might not fully adjust for differences in diversification possibilities since it\naccounts for company location but not for local industrial variety.\nLocal bias and company awareness\nIn addition, we would like to test whether the observed local bias is a phenomenon which is\nprimarily attributable to stockholdings in companies whose awareness is limited to the local\ninvestment community. Due to higher wide-area media coverage or a greater exposure of in-\ndividuals to company advertisements, for instance, some firms are visible to many potential\ninvestors, regardless of where they reside. For a given investor, this mitigates the asymmetry\nin familiarity between local and remote companies with high relative visibility. Assuming that\npeople tend to invest in the familiar (Huberman, 2001), this effect should reduce the fraction\nof locally invested equity and thus the local bias. Following Ivkovic and Weisbenner (2005),\nwe choose membership in the major national stock index DAX to distinguish companies\nwhich are nationally known from those whose awareness is likely to be regionally bounded.\nDAX members are assumed to feature a relatively small potential for asymmetries in compa-\nny visibility, while the opposite holds true for non-DAX companies. Panel B of Table 3 splits\nthe sampled equity universe into stocks of the 30 companies listed in the DAX, which togeth-\ner account for roughly 60% of Germany's aggregate market capitalization, and the remainder\nof stocks. Indeed, the rightmost column of Panel B reports average local bias levels of nearly\n14% for the portion of non-DAX stocks, while for holdings of DAX-listed companies, the\ndeviation from the benchmark comes to only slightly above one third this percentage (5.3%).\nThis indicates that index membership partly harmonizes the differences in the awareness of a\ngiven company between local and nonlocal investors. Alternatively, reduced local over-\ninvestment for the subsample of DAX-listed companies might also be a result of measurement\nconstraints. Note that we use the sampled companies' headquarters for our distance calcula-\ntions (see footnote 20) and therefore do not capture branch-related local investments but in-\nstead count them as remote stockholdings in a world where the premises of a given company\nare confined to its legal seat. Since DAX-members are particularly likely to have multiple\npremises located throughout Germany, we are in turn particularly likely to underestimate lo-\ncal bias levels for this subsample of firms. Again, however, the null hypothesis of no local\nbias is comfortably rejected for either of the two subsamples.\nLocal bias and employee stock ownership\nFinally, we address the question of whether our implications regarding the preference for lo-\ncal equity might be distorted by employee stock ownership. In Germany, large publicly traded\ncorporations offer employee share purchase plans (henceforth ESPP) where employees can\nbuy company stock at a considerable discount, if they accept a lock-up period of several\nyears. Assuming that most employees live in close proximity to the company they work for,\nhousehold stockholdings attributable to ESPP would appear as local investments in the data.\nOur data set does not allow for a distinction of shareholders according to their affiliation to\nthe company they are invested in. However, this does not pose a problem, since ESPP-related\nstockholdings are typically aggregated in a collective deposit held by the company for ac-\ncount of their employees.24 In other words, they do not appear in the SecuStat filings we ex-\namine in this study.\n4 Testing the information hypothesis: Do German individual investors yield\nexcess returns on their local stock investments?\n4.1 General intuition\nIn this section, we investigate whether the information hypothesis is able to explain local bias\namong individual investors, i.e. whether they possess value-relevant information about local\nstocks and earn abnormal returns from stock-picking. To answer this question, we analyze the\nlong-run performance of investors' local stockholdings and compare it to different bench-\nmarks. Although prior literature generally documents a poor performance of individual inves-\ntors as stock market participants,25 there are several reasons why those investors might pos-\nsess advantageous information for local stocks. First, since households are more exposed to\nregional shocks if they tilt their portfolios towards local equity, uninformed investors should\neschew such a local overweight. Hence, the holdings in geographically close equity should\n25 Barber (1999) and Barber and Odean (2000), for instance, document that the stockholdings of the average\nbroker client in their sample yield negative abnormal returns. Dorn et al. (2008) report related evidence for\nGerman private investors.\nreflect the investments of informed households, which is why we can expect that, on average,\nlocal stock investments should be accompanied by excess returns if information advantages\napply. Second, by investigating nearby holdings of individual investors, we focus on the port-\nfolio segment in which value-relevant informational asymmetriesif presentshould be most\npronounced. Third and finally, we replicate the performance analysis for the subsample of\nnon-DAX-listed stocks in order to guarantee that our results are not weakened by the more\nnationally known companies with less potential for information asymmetries between local\nand nonlocal stockholders.\nWe divide each investor's portfolio into a local and nonlocal portion, using the 100 kilometer\nthreshold. Next, we calculate quarterly returns of the local and remote portion of her portfo-\nlio.26 These returns are then regressed on the performance of two reference portfolios.\nMeasuring long-run abnormal performance of individual investors\nNote that several methodological issues should be considered when studying the performance\nof individual investors.27 One set of pitfalls concerns the calculation of a valid test statistic.\nFirst, we have to account for cross-sectional dependence in portfolio returns across individu-\nals. This is necessary because our data comprises 27,819 investor-quarter observations, while\nour equity universe consists of 1,317 different stocks. Thus, we have cross-correlation in re-\nturns whenever two investors hold the same stock over the same quarter. Hoechle et al. (2009)\nfind that test statistics which ignore cross-sectional dependence in the sample of investors'\nreturns can produce t-values which are three and more times higher than their correctly speci-\nfied counterparts and thus are unusable. Second, we require an appropriate benchmark against\nwhich to compare households' returns on their local equity investments.\nMoreover, empirical evidence suggests that individuals hold rather poorly diversified port-\nfolios, typically composed of only a handful of different stocks.28 Put differently, chances are\nthat the local fraction of a given investor's holdings consists of a single stock only. Thus, the\n26 For details on how the returns are computed, the reader is referred to the appendix.\n27 See, for instance, Lyon et al. (1999) and Hoechle et al. (2009) for problems with measuring long-run abnormal\nreturns of individual investor's stockholdings as well as methodological approaches to resolve them.\n28 See, for instance, Dorn and Huberman (2005) for empirical evidence of under-diversification among German\nprivate investors.\nmonthly return of a sole stock may be counted as an observation in a standard regression\nanalysis, which would mean that small, volatile stocks can overly influence results.\nFinally, recent empirical evidence has revealed a potential time-series selection bias when\ninvestigating individual investors' preference for nearby companies. As mentioned in section\nreach directly contradicting conclusions. They partly ascribe this to the fact that Ivkovic and\nWeisbenner confine their analysis to a (arbitrarily chosen) cross-section of holdings data.\nRegression specification\nWe make use of calendar-time portfolios in order to circumvent the problems discussed\nabove.29 Owing to the structure of our dataset, we build 1,715 bank-level portfolios, each of\nwhich aggregates the stockholdings of all private households affiliated with the respective\nbank, and thus ensure that the impact of small numbers of stocks is not unduly high in the\nperformance analysis. For each of the 1,715 portfolios, we then calculate the value-weighted\nreturn of its local holdings. We estimate pooled ordinary least squares regressions and com-\npute Rogers (1993) standard errors that are robust to heteroscedasticity and contemporaneous\ncorrelation (clustered by quarter).\nAlso, by analyzing a time span of more than four yearswith utterly different stock market\nperiods of boom and bust, including an unprecedented financial crisiswe implicitly avoid\narbitrary `snapshot' results.\nUltimately, we compare against an additional benchmark which is specific to the location\nof a given investor. This way, we address heterogeneity in the geographic distribution of in-\ndustries and households, and avoid that some local investors earn superior (inferior) returns\non their local stockholdings simply because they reside in an area, where certain industries\nexperience higher (lower) relative returns during the period under review. Consider, for in-\nstance, the period from mid-2007 to end-2008. Those stocks in our sample, which are related\nto the financial sector likely exhibit significant underperformance during that time. Recalling\nthe strong geographic concentration of finance-related companies in the city of Frankfurt,\nchances are that we would erroneously document a significant underperformance of house-\nholds in the area surrounding Frankfurt when applying the standard benchmark. To prevent\n29 The calendar-time portfolio approach dates back to the work of Jaffe (1974) and Mandelker (1974) and has\nproved suitable for the analysis of risk-adjusted performance of investors. See Hoechle et al. (2009) for a re-\nview of empirical finance studies applying this methodology. Our regression model largely follows Seasholes\nflawed results, we therefore regress the returns of local holdings not only on a broad market\nreturn, but also on a local benchmark. This investor-specific reference portfolio is composed\nof the value-weighted market capitalization local to a given investor, i.e. stemming from\ncompanies domiciled within 100 kilometers of her place of residence.\nWe form calendar-time portfolios based on both the holdings and the transactions of the\nindividual investors under review, and present our results in the following section.\nHoldings-based calendar-time portfolios\nTable 4 reports the results of the holdings-based regression analysis. Regression 1 documents\nthe average raw excess return (\n,\nlocal i f\n- ) which households earn on their local stockhold-\nings. In equations 2 and 3, we regress the excess local return on an overall excess market re-\nturn ( BM\nall f\nR - R ) and a excess local benchmark return ( BM\nlocal,i f\nR - R ), respectively. We calculate\nboth benchmarks as value-weighted indices including all stocks in our sample. Note that the\nmarket benchmark is the same for all investors, whereas the local benchmark is specific to the\ngeographic location of a given investor. Regression 4 represents the full specification includ-\ning both the nationwide and the local benchmark. Panel A shows the results for the full stock\nuniverse; Panel B reports the corresponding numbers for the subsample of non-DAX stocks.\nWe find a number of interesting results. The average quarterly excess return amounts to a\nnegative 1.3 basis points (bp) per quarter, which can be ascribed to the down market in the\nsecond half of our sample period. Regressions 2 to 4 show that abnormal returns further con-\nverge to zero after adjusting for the different market betas; however, they are negative irre-\nspective of the reference portfolio. Note that neither regression model produces significant\nalphasbe it economically or statistically, regardless of the specification we estimate. In\nfact, even on an annualized basis, the gross loss before benchmark adjustment amounts to\nonly roughly five basis points. Returns decrease when we use the investor-specific local\nbenchmark as a reference portfolio (regression 3), but in terms of economic significance, re-\nsults do not materially differ from those for the overall market index (regression 2).\nThe findings of our holdings-based analysis for the full stock universe qualitatively support\nthe evidence provided by Seasholes and Zhu (2010), who also document economically and\nstatistically insignificant alphas for U.S. individual investors (albeit positive ones). Unlike\nSeasholes and Zhu (2010), however, we also investigate holdings in the subsample of non-\nDAX firms (see Panel B of Table 4) and find that investors' portfolio share of those stocks\n(with presumably lower visibility for the investment community) does not generate significant\npositive alpha, either. Quite on the contrary, excess returns even decrease across the board\nwhen we replicate the performance analysis for the sample of those companies for which we\nhypothesize that information asymmetriesif presentare highest. This is contrary to what\none would expect to see in case of an information-based preference for nearby equity.\nNext, we test the robustness of our results by dissecting households according to how strongly\ntheir stockholdings are tilted towards nearby companies. Assuming that investors with supe-\nrior ability to pick local stocks concentrate their investments locally, whereas investors with\nno such abilities hold a better diversified portfolio, it could be the case that we find abnormal\nreturns from nearby investments only for those households, which exhibit a high relative local\nbias. To investigate this issue, we rank all households according to their investment locality\nand assign them to local bias quartiles. Table 5 summarizes the results for the four resulting\nportfolios. Interestingly, average local bias levels differ sharply across the quartiles. At -0.9%\non average, the 25% least locally invested households in the sample effectively show a slight\nremote bias, while mean local bias levels exceed 20% for households in the top quartile. Yet,\ndifferences across the four portfolios virtually vanish when focusing on investment perfor-\nmance: we re-estimate the full regression model (as described above) for each of the quartiles\nand find that alphas are all indistinguishable from zero and do not differ significantly, as can\nbe seen in the rightmost column of Table 5. This implies that our main finding, i.e. private\nhouseholds do not significantly outperform the market with their local holdings, applies to all\nhouseholds in the sample, regardless of how strongly locally biased they are.\nTransactions-based calendar-time portfolios\nIn a second step, we aim to explore if buys and sells of local stocks predict positive and nega-\ntive future returns, respectively. Overall, purchases of individuals have been found to under-\nperform their sales.30 Hence, it might be interesting to examine whether this still holds when\nfocusing on the portfolio fraction of geographically close stocks. To this end, we now focus\non changes in stock positions compared to the previous quarter. Note that these changes re-\nflect net quarter-to-quarter turnover of aggregated portfolios which combine the trading deci-\nsions of many individual investors at the bank level. Certainly, this entails that opposite trades\n30 See, for instance, Odean (1999), who infers this finding from analyzing the accounts of discount brokerage\ncustomers.\nsimply cancel each other out and we capture only the lower bound of transactions. We calcu-\nlate two returns for the local versus nonlocal fraction of each aggregated portfolio and distin-\nguish between buy- and sell-positions. Hence, the dependent variables are (i) the difference in\nreturns of an investor's buys and sells for the local portion of her portfolio, buy sell\nlocal,i local,i\nR - R\n,andanalogously(ii) the difference in returns of the buy- and sell-positions for the portion\nof nonlocal stocks she holds ( buy sell\nremote,i remote,i\nR - R ). Returns are computed before transaction costs.\nWe assume that each stock is held for 12 months which has been reported as the average\nholding period in related research.31\nTable 6 reports regression results regarding the performance of households' purchases and\nsales of nearby stocks, at a 12-month horizon. Similar to what we see for the holdings-based\nanalysis, we find negative alphas: local buys underperform local sells. This time, however, the\nreturn differential turns out to be statistically significant for both the full sample and the sub-\nsample of non-DAX companies. Interestingly, this finding again corroborates the empirical\nevidence of Seasholes and Zhu (2010) for U.S. individual investors. However, they report\neconomically significant losses, whereas our analysis yields excess losses adding up to no\nmore than 5.3 bp p.a. for the full sample and 4.8 bp p.a. for the subsample of non-DAX com-\npanies. With respect to the performance of remote stocks bought minus sold, we also docu-\nment a marginally negative return for the entire stock universe (-0.70 bp p.a.) as well as for\nthe subsample of non-DAX companies (-7.85 bp p.a.), which turns out statistically significant\nfor the latter group. Compared to the returns from the local portfolio fraction, this points to a\nslightly better (worse) performance of the remote portfolio for the full sample (the subgroup\nof non-DAX companies). However, at roughly \u00b13 bp p.a., this effect is marginal in magnitude\nand thus economically negligible.\nIn sum, the results of the holdings-based as well as the transactions-based performance analy-\nsis conclusively reject the proposition that private households possess a `home-field advan-\ntage' which manifests itself in value-relevant information about local companies. This has a\nnumber of implications. First, the findings document that it is by no means rational for private\nhouseholds to actively pick local stocks. In fact, returns do not compensate investors for the\nconcentration of diversifiable risk they hold in their portfolios when tilting them towards local\nequity. Second, judging from the consistently negative return differential between local buys\n31 Seasholes and Zhu (2010) document an average holding period of one year; Doskeland and Hvide (2011) state\nan average holding period of 300 days.\nand local sells it appears that, if anything, translating her local information into an investment\ndecision turns out to be detrimental to an individual investor's assets.\n5 Testing the familiarity hypothesis: Investor ambiguity aversion and local\nbias\n5.1 General intuition\nSo far, we have not explicitly addressed changes in local bias levels over time. In order to\nexamine the purely information-driven behavior by means of a performance analysis, it suf-\nfices to mitigate a potential time series selection bias, which we have been careful to do by\nconsidering all holdings and transactions over the entire 2005 to 2009 sample period (see sec-\ntion 4.2). Also, this rational behavior does not provide for changes in local bias over time,\nsince it is unrealistic to assume that, on aggregate, investors systematically possess more in-\nformation advantages at a certain point in time than before or after this date. In this section,\nwe investigate whether, empirically, we observe changes in individual investors' local bias\nover time and seek to rationalize them.\nOur period under review is substantially different from others in that it includes extreme\nmarket cycles. Continued GDP growth in Germany between the last quarter of 2005 and the\nfirst quarter of 2008 is followed by four consecutive quarters of severe economic decline,\nwith annualized GDP plummeting by 8 percent in the last quarter of 2008 and again 14 per-\ncent in the subsequent three months. Finally, this crisis period is replaced by moderate GDP\ngrowth from mid-2009 onwards. These heavy fluctuations are accompanied by unprecedented\nstock market volatility: The broad German stock index CDAX crashes by 43% in 2008 while\nin the other three years, it rises by more than 20% per annum.\nWe expect households to take measures in response to this strong economic downturn, i.e.\nto rebalance their equity portfolios, where otherwise inertia would have prevailed.32 We are\ninterested in whether different business cycles have an impact on individuals' propensity to\noverinvest in nearby companies and how this teaches us new insights regarding the root cause\nof local bias. Specifically, our data set allows us to test a key implication of a portfolio selec-\ntion model developed by Boyle et al. (2011). The authors extend the classic Markowitz model\n32 In a recent contribution, Cao et al. (2011) show analytically that investors are reluctant to trade away from\ninvestments that they currently hold (`status-quo bias'). In their model, a threshold has to be exceeded for a\ngiven investor to be willing to leave this status quo.\nby relaxing the assumption that investors are equally ambiguous about all assets. This modifi-\ncation is particularly suitable for asset allocation decisions, since an individual's ambiguity\naversion is extra high in comparative situations where different chances are compared against\neach other instead of being evaluated separately. They find that, when admitting investors to\nexhibit different degrees of uncertainty across assets, the portfolio selection deviates from the\nMarkowitz theory in two important ways. The first difference concerns the portfolio composi-\ntion. The optimal portfolio is now composed of a mix of familiar and unfamiliar assets. Put\ndifferently, incorporating familiarity as a selection dimension implies that the resulting portfo-\nlio is exposed to idiosyncratic risk. The second deviation concerns the portfolio's sensitivity\nto risk. The familiarity bias triggers a rebalancing of the optimal portfolio in response to\nchanging asset-return correlations. In fact, Boyle et al. (2011) find that the fraction of familiar\nassets increases in times of a financial crisisan effect which they dub flight-to-familiarity.\nThe intuition for this result is that unfamiliar assets become less useful for diversification pur-\nposes as correlations between assets increase. An ambiguity-averse investor will therefore\nhold relatively less of the unfamiliar assets. If geographic proximity is a valid proxy for fami-\nliarity, we would thus expect investors (i) to hold locally biased equity portfolios (which we\nshow in section 2 of this paper) and (ii) to shift their portfolio towards local stocks in times of\nstock market downturn, resulting in an increased local bias during those periods. This second\nimplication is tested in the following.\nTo test for a potential familiarity-driven investment behavior, we use expected stock return\nvolatility as a measure of investor uncertainty in order to gauge the negative relationship be-\ntween asset price standard deviation and returns.33 To this end, we take the VDAX New index\nwhich captures implied volatility of the DAX30 index at a one-month horizon and may be\nregarded as the German equivalent to the CBOE's market volatility index VIX based on the\nS&P 500. We calculate quarterly means of the VDAX New and compare them to the corre-\nsponding local bias levels at the end of each quarter.\nBefore turning to the test, we are interested in the extent to which overall quarterly changes\nin local bias levels actually reflect active portfolio rebalancing decisions. Note that individual\ninvestors' exposure to local assets may change in two ways. Obviously, they can play an ac-\n33 See Schwert (1990), among others, for an examination of the relationship between asset price volatility and\nreturns.\ntive part by trading and thereby altering the proportion of local equity in their portfolio. On\nthe other hand, however, they may allow price changes to naturally shift the relative weight of\nnearbyas opposed to remotecompanies. To distinguish these effects, we dissect the quar-\nterly changes in local bias into a trading-induced fraction (active rebalancing) and a price-\ninduced fraction (passive rebalancing). Straightforwardly, the trading-driven (price-driven)\nchange is obtained by keeping prices (holdings) unchanged for the three-month period be-\ntween two consecutive reporting dates.\nFigure 2 plots the overall quarter-to-quarter change in local bias, as well as the proportions\nattributable to active and passive rebalancing, respectively. Interestingly, we observe that the\ntransactions-based effect and the performance-based effect work in opposite directions for\nnearly all quarters. In other words, including price changes understates rather than overdraws\nindividuals' active decisions to shift their portfolio weights. While usually low, this attenua-\ntion is particularly pronounced around the peak of the financial crisis in the third quarter of\n2008, where active rebalancing without price effects would have resulted in considerably\nhigher local bias levels. We conjecture that for individual investorsunlike, say, fund man-\nagersthe absence of trading does not reflect a deliberate portfolio strategy. Thus, we are\nconcerned with active rebalancing decisions and focus on trading-induced changes in local\nbias in the following.\nOur findings clearly support a flight to familiarity among German individual investors. Figure\n3 plots the development of the VDAX New against the respective local bias levels for the\nperiod under review. As can be seen, we document a strong congruence between expected\nstock return volatility and local bias over time. We regress the local bias on the VDAX New\nto examine whether the relationship illustrated in Figure 3 proves statistically significant.\nNote that, in order to do so, we use first differences of the two series since the levels turn out\nto be non-stationary processes of order one. We also include an AR(1)-term to mitigate possi-\nble autocorrelation and thereby bring the Durbin-Watson statistics close towards the required\n2. Finally, we alter the baseline regression (Regression 1) by adding the first lag of the VDAX\nNew change to capture potential inertia of households in their reaction upon a change in stock\nmarket uncertainty (Regression 2). Table 7 reports our results. Corroborating the initial evi-\ndence from Figure 3, we find that changes in the VDAX New turn out to be highly significant\nin explaining adjustments in local bias levels among private households. Specifically, a ten\npercent rise of the VDAX New translates into an average increase in local bias of as much as\n0.6 percent. Results with regard to the lag-one VDAX New change (Regression 2) are not\nstatistically significant, indicating that households adjust their portfolios in the same quarter\nin which the change in stock market uncertainty takes place.\nInterestingly, not only do we observe a flight to familiarity in times of stock market down-\nturn, but also a reversal of this effect as soon as stock prices pick up again: when markets re-\nbound from mid-2009 on, local bias levels also decrease significantly as a result of this devel-\nopment. By the end of 2009, local bias levels have almost reached pre-Lehman levels. We\nfurther sort out the relation of market performance and local bias by calculating the quarterly\nchanges in German stock market performance for our period under review and assigning the\n16 values we obtain into four quartiles according to magnitude of change. As a performance\nmeasure, we use the broad CDAX index. The average change in CDAX levels per quartile,\ntogether with the corresponding mean local bias level, is reported in Table 8. Consistent with\nwhat we observe in Figure 3, we find that for pronounced upward or downward moving mar-\nkets in particular, changes in stock market performance and local bias of German household\ninvestors are strongly negatively correlated.\nNext, we are interested in whether the portfolio rebalancing towards familiar (local) stocks\nwhich we observe in times of economic uncertainty is the result of a few households tilting\ntheir portfolios heavily towards nearby stocks oron the contrarya widespread trend\namong private investors. To this end, we look at the average portfolio shift of private house-\nholds aggregated at the bank level and sum up the number of mean increases and mean de-\ncreases in trading-based local bias, respectively.\nTable 9 reports our results. In most quarters, we see that increases in overall local bias lev-\nels are indeed accompanied by increased average exposure to nearby companies for the\ngreater part of banks, and vice versa. While this relation is stronger in the second half of the\nsampled period starting shortly before the financial crisis, we conclude from our data that the\nflight-to-familiarity effect is driven by the majority of individual investors. Interestingly, we\nsee widespread shifts towards local equity following two events which private investors asso-\nciate particularly strongly with the outbreak of the financial crisis. Specifically, the collapse\nand firesale of Bear Stearns in mid-March 2008 was followed by a 3.4% increase in local\noverinvestment, andmost prominently, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers later that year\non September 15 subsequently lead to a 6.4% jump in individual investor's local bias. Also,\nTable 9 documents shifts towards geographically close companies in the second quarter of\n2006, when the DAX dropped by ten percentage points in less than one month during May\n2006. Analogously, the flight to familiarity reverses in 2009 and average increases in local\nequity reach their lowest levels in mid-2009 when newsflow has again become positive across\nthe board and several important economic indicators reach their pre-Lehman levels.\nTaken together, we find (i) that individual investors pull out of remote (unfamiliar) stocks,\nand pour into local (familiar) stocks during times of financial crises, (ii) that this flight to fa-\nmiliarity is driven by active portfolio rebalancing and rebounds when the economy picks up\nagain, and, finally, (iii) that this shift is a robust phenomenon across the majority of individual\ninvestors.\nGiven this evidence, there is reason to assume that the concept of investor familiarity in-\nduced by ambiguity aversion might be a promising avenue in the attempt to explain the local\nbias phenomenon among individual investors. One can reasonably assume that private house-\nholds do not devote their entire time and energy to collecting and processing all information\navailable in the market. Put differently, due to time (and other) constraints, it is unrealistic to\nconjecture that people are equally ambiguous about all securities. Rather, they possess differ-\nent degrees of ambiguity across different securities, as modeled by Boyle et al. (2011), and\nfavor investments which they are less ambiguous about. In addition to that, portfolio choices\nare characterized by several distinct features which may aggravate investors' ambiguity aver-\nsion. On the one hand, asset allocation decisions are situations in which different chances are\ncompared against each other instead of being evaluated separately. In such settings, people are\nparticularly inclined to exhibit intolerance towards the uncertain (Fox and Tversky, 1995). On\nthe other hand, investment choices are decisions where the majority of households judge\nthemselves to be relatively less competent; this matches the findings of Heath and\nTversky (1991), who demonstrate that ambiguity aversion is especially pronounced when\npeople find it difficult to assess a set of prospects. Consequently, local bias seems to be part\nof a larger phenomenon in which individual investors show a preference for the familiar\nwhich is attributable to ambiguity aversion. Investors' aversion to risk implies that their port-\nfolios should be diversified, butbeing ambiguity aversethey trade off a piece of this di-\nversification by overweighting familiar assets in their stock portfolios, thereby creating a local\nbias.\n6 Conclusion\nThis paper contributes to the literature on the geography of investment. We investigate the\nrole of individual investors' location for their stockholdings. Analyzing a rich data set which\ncovers the accounts of nearly six million private households in Germany, we find strong evi-\ndence for a local biasi.e. an overweight of geographically close versus remote German\ncompanies in their equity portfoliosand investigate the reasons for this portfolio concentra-\ntion. We consider two possible explanations. On the one hand, it could be that the overweight\nin nearby stocks reflects informed investment decisions. In this case, a locally biased portfolio\nwould not necessarily constitute an investment mistake. Instead, it could still be consistent\nwith traditional mean-variance portfolio theory in case the increased portfolio risk incurred\nthrough the regional focus is rewarded by a superior performance of the local stockholdings.\nThe intuition is that, if investors' preference for geographically close companies is driven by\nlocally generated value-relevant information, then the value of that information should be\nreflected in an excess return of their local stocks. More readily available information allows\ninvestors to form more refined expectations about those stocks, thereby exploiting an infor-\nmation advantage when assessing these nearby companies (information hypothesis). In order\nto test for potential information advantages, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of both the\nholdings-based and the transactions-based portfolio performance of private households in our\nsample. Our results conclusively reject a `home-field advantage' of local over non-local indi-\nvidual investors. Next, we investigate to what extent investors' familiarity with nearby com-\npanies is able to explain the empirically observed local bias. While prior studies in the field\nsuggest that familiarity might be the reason for local bias, they remain largely unclear about\nthe nature and the influence of familiarity on portfolio concentration. We take a theoretical\nframework of investor familiarity developed by Boyle et al. (2011) to the data. The model\nclaims that familiarity arises from investors' aversion towards the ambiguous and predicts that\ninvestors are not only locally biased butin addition to thatlocal bias should increase in\ntimes of economic uncertainty (`flight to familiarity' effect). The latter proposition is incon-\nsistent with an information-based explanation. Using geographic proximity as a proxy for\nfamiliarity, we find clear support for investor familiarity as the underlying reason of locally\nbiased equity portfolios. We conclude that individual investors' local bias is a matter of ambi-\nguity aversion in the portfolio selection process rather than a trading strategy based on locally\ngenerated information advantages. The finding that, on average, private households in Ger-\nmany do not benefit from a concentration of local assets in their portfolios, however, suggests\nthat they are well-advised not to confuse familiarity with information about a company when\nmaking investment decisions.\nReferences\nAckert, Lucy F., Bryan K.

Follow-\ning Coval and Moskowitz (2001), we thus update a given investor's portfolio holdings\nat the beginning of every quarter on the basis of the holdings reported for the previous\nquarter, and assume them to remain unchanged over the subsequent three months. So,\nfor instance, the stock positions from the last quarter of 2008 (ending December 2008)\nare used with return data for January, February, and March 2009. Specifically, the two\nreturns for investor i in quarter t are calculated as\n-\n\n=  \n, , , , 1 ,\ni\nact\nlocal i t i j t j t\nj N\nR w r and\n-\n\n=  \n, , , , 1 ,\ni\nact\nremote i t i j t j t\nj N\nR w r\nwhere\n, ,\nlocal i t\nR and\n, ,\nremote i t\nR are the returns over the quarter t on investor i's local and\nnonlocal stockholdings, respectively. i\nN reflects the number of stocks local to investor\ni,\n-\n\nact\ni j t\nw is the rescaled (to sum to one) fraction of stock j in her portfolio at the end of\nquarter t-1, and, finally,\n,\nj t\nr is the three-month raw return of stock j at time t. Each in-\nvestor produces a time series of 17 quarters of local returns.\nGeographical distribution of German individual investors and public limited companies\nThis figure plots the spatial coordinates (in degrees) of the private households (blue rhombuses)\nas well as the public limited companies (red squares) represented in the sample. Households are\nmapped within the zip code area of their custodian bank. Companies are mapped according to\nthe geographical location of their headquarters.\nLatitude\nLongitude\nLatitude\nLongitude\nChanges in local bias among German individual investors during the sample period\nThis figure plots the evolution of average local bias levels across German private households for\nthe period between end-2005 and end-2009. Overall quarter-to-quarter changes (red line) are\ndissected in trading-based shifts (active portfolio rebalancing) and shifts induced by price\nmovements absent transactions (passive portfolio rebalancing).\nChange local bias\nActive rebalancing\nPassive rebalancing\nTotal change\nLocal bias of German individual investors under changing market conditions\nThis figure plots German private households' quarterly local bias levels for the period between\nend-2005 and end-2009 against the VDAX New index. the VDAX New captures implied return\nvolatility of the major German stock index DAX30 at a one-month horizon. Local bias levels are\nadjusted for stock price movements between the reporting periods and thus are confined to\ninvestors' active portfolio rebalancing decisions.\nLocal bias\nLocal Bias\n(continued on next page)\nPanel B: Custodian banks\nGeographical area of\ninvestor residence\nTotal number of banks Average number household\nportfolios per bank\nAll Savings banks Cooperative banks\nSummary statistics of sampled investor portfolios, custodian banks and companies\nPanel A: Portfolio statistics\nAmount (EUR) Fraction of total portfolio value (%)\nDomestic common stockholdings\nGeographical area of\ninvestor residence\nTotal number\nof portfolios\nSummary statistics of sampled investor portfolios, custodian banks, and companiescontinued\nPanel C: Public limited companies\nCity\nCompany headquarters\nN % Cum. %\nThis table presents basic characteristics of the private households and firms represented in the sample. Panel A reports descriptive portfolio statistics of\nhouseholds delineated by the geographical area in which they reside, distinguishing between urban and rural, as well as West German states and East\nGerman states ('New L\u00e4nder'). Numbers in Panel A reflect averages across all years under review. Panel B presents summary statistics pertaining to the\ncustodian banks, to which the sampled households are affiliated. Finally, Panel C provides information on the geographic spread of the sampled public\nlimited companies headquarters within the ten largest cities in Germany as well as outside those areas (Other ).\nHoldings Market portfolio\nkm\nMarket portfolio\nThis table presents portfolio statistics of German private households referring to the locality of\ntheir domestic stock investments. Panel A displays households' average distance to their actual\nholdings and to the market portfolio built from the full stock universe under review (both distances\nweighted by free float market value). The difference between the two distances is shown in the\nrightmost column. Panel B reports the average fraction of a household's stockholdings which is\ninvested locally, i.e. within a radius of 100 kilometers around the household's place of residence,\nas well as the proportional free-float market capitalization within the household's local range.

Panel A reports the\ncorresponding figures for subsamples built according to the households' geographic area of\nresidence, distinguishing between urban and rural, as well as West German states and East German\nstates ('New L\u00e4nder').
