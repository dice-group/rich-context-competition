Estimates from\nAdministrative Data\nLaura Dague1, Thomas DeLeire2,3, Donna Friedsam4,\nLindsey Leininger5, Sarah Meier6, and Kristen Voskuil4\n Keywords\ncrowd-out, Medicaid, SCHIP\nArticle\nIntroduction\nIn this study, we determine the fraction of new Medicaid\nenrollees who have private health insurance at the time of\nenrollment in the program and, of those, the fraction that\ndropped their private coverage. This study is, to our knowl-\nedge, the first to use administrative data to estimate the\nmovement between private and public insurance programs.\nOur findings also update the understanding of these move-\nments in the context of a private insurance environment that\ndiffers substantially from that of a decade ago--in particu-\nlar, one that today requires higher participant cost-sharing in\nthe form of premiums, deductibles, and co-payments (Kaiser\nFamily Foundation [KFF] 2011). In addition, we identify a\nsubpopulation of new enrollees into public insurance pro-\ngrams that simultaneously held private coverage for at least\nsix months following enrollment, a phenomenon that has\nreceived relatively little attention in the literature.\nAn understanding of the movement between private and\npublic insurance programs is particularly important in today's\npolicy environment. The implementation of the Affordable\nCareAct (ACA), including Medicaid expansions and premium\nand cost-sharing subsidies for private, exchange-based health\ninsurance, has heighted concerns about declines in employer-\nsponsored coverage. As of January 2013, Wisconsin was\namong eight states with income eligibility thresholds for par-\nents with dependent children already in place that exceed the\nACA's 133 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) threshold\nfor Medicaid eligibility. An additional fifteen states had estab-\nlished other programs for non-disabled childless adults (KFF\n2013). As a result, concern about crowd-out goes beyond the\nmigration from employer-sponsored insurance to Medicaid, as\nthese states must decide whether to retain expanded coverage\n1Texas A&M University, College Station, TX USA\n2Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA\n3National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, MA, USA\n4University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA\n5University of Illinois at Chicago, IL, USA\n6Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLaura Dague, Bush School of Government and Public Service, Texas A&M\nUniversity, 4220 TAMU, College Station, TX, USA.\nEmail: dague@tamu.edu.\nfor adults or to reduce eligibility to the 133 percent of FPL\nthreshold, and thereby allow a greater fraction of adults to\nbecome eligible for federal subsidies of exchange-based pri-\nvate coverage (State Health ReformAssistance Network 2013).\nUnderstanding the extent to which new enrollees overlap\nprivate coverage with public coverage allows for a more\nnuanced assessment of the prior reported crowd-out rates and\nmay generate policy considerations about the degree to\nwhich such dual coverage is desirable.\nThe linking of various state administrative data sources allow\nus to accurately capture movements between private and public\ncoverage for individuals who enroll in public coverage, to deter-\nmine the extent the enrollees into public coverage have and\nmaintain private coverage, and to observe job transitions that\nmay be associated with losses of coverage, none of which have\nbeen previously possible. While our contribution is primarily\nempirical in nature, we also develop a simple conceptualmodel\nfor understanding various approaches. This conceptual model\nenables us to place our estimates within the literature and allows\nfor comparison with prior estimates of crowd-out.\nThe administrative data we use come from Wisconsin's\nBadgerCare Plus (BC+) program, which covers children of\nall income levels and parent or caretaker adults up to 200\npercent of FPL. The data allow us to observe the universe of\nenrollees in the state's public insurance program as well as\ntheir family members. The size of our administrative data set\nalso allows us to examine subgroups, including groups\ndefined by income and geographic location.\nOur strict upper bound for the percentage of new public\ninsurance enrollees with private health insurance at the time\nof enrollment is 29 percent, with a strict lower bound of 16\npercent. Not all of these enrollees dropped their private cover-\nage. Our strict upper and lower bounds on the percentage that\ndropped private coverage in favor of public insurance are 18\npercent and 4 percent, respectively. We also provide point\nestimates of these percentages, and we estimate that among\nall new enrollees, 21 percent had private health insurance at\nthe time of enrollment and that 10 percent of all new enrollees\ndropped this coverage. While these results are for the time\nperiod after the expansion of Wisconsin's program (April\nhad higher rates of private insurance coverage at the time of\nenrollment, as did residents of urban counties.\nBackground\nInterest in the potential displacement of private insurance\ncoverage by public health programs increased with the expan-\nsions of state Medicaid programs in the late 1980s and early\n1990s. A robust literature emerged seeking to quantify the\nmagnitude of any such \"crowd-out\" effect. A comprehensive\noverview of the crowd-out literature lies beyond the scope of\nour work (for excellent reviews, see Gruber 2003; Davidson,\nSimon 2008); instead, we focus on situating the unique con-\ntribution of our paper within this broader literature.\nThe approach we take is to use high-quality administrative\ndata to directly measure the prior and concurrent private\ninsurance coverage of new Medicaid enrollees. As will be\ndeveloped below in the conceptual model, the resulting mea-\nsure is less expansive than the operationalization of crowd-\nout in the majority of the related literature, as it does not\ncapture any potential effects that the availability of public\ncoverage may have on transitions between uninsured and pri-\nvately insured states. The resulting implication is that our\nparameter of interest should in theory be lower than the range\nof crowd-out rates found in the existing literature. While this\nrange is vast and remains the subject of vigorous debate, two\nimportant benchmarks are frequently cited: (1) the (approxi-\nmate) 50 percent estimate from the seminal Cutler and Gruber\n(1996) paper covering the Medicaid expansions of the late\narrived at in an influential review of the Children's Health\nInsurance Program (CHIP) era expansions by the\nCongressional Budget Office (CBO; 2007).\nThorpe and Florence (1999) authored the one existing\nstudy that estimates a parameter similar to ours; using chil-\nLongitudinal Survey of Youth, they found that across the\nstudy years, between 36 and 54 percent of new Medicaid\nenrollees had private coverage at some point in the past year.\nAfter subtracting out children whose coverage change likely\nresulted from parental job loss, they estimated that approxi-\nmately 16 percent of children had access to private insurance\nat the time of Medicaid enrollment. Our work extends this\nanalysis in several important ways. First, we are able to\ninclude adults in our estimates of private\u00adpublic insurance\ntransitions. Moreover, as discussed above, our results are\nmore reflective of the current employer-sponsored insurance\nenvironment, which is characterized by higher member cost-\nsharing relative to the study periods of Thorpe and Florence\nand its contemporary articles.\nFinally, and arguably most importantly, we estimate concur-\nrent private insurance coverage held by new Medicaid enroll-\nees during their early tenure on the program. Understanding the\nextent to which new Medicaid enrollees \"overlap\" public cov-\nerage with private coverage is a key contribution to the larger\ncrowd-out literature, as the treatment of the overlap population\nis an important driver of differences in estimates across previ-\nous studies. There is concern that the overlap arises from a\nmeasurement issue: either a reporting error on the part of sur-\nvey recipients or an issue of timing (those who moved from one\nsource of coverage to the other report having both). Moreover,\nconcurrent with the implementation of eligibility expansions,\nMedicaid and CHIP agencies increased their use of private\nadministrators for public-managed care programs, which likely\nresulted in beneficiary confusion regarding type of coverage\nheld (see LoSasso and Buchmueller 2004 for a careful\nDague et al. 3\ndiscussion of the resulting measurement error implications).\nCritically, it is impossible to parse true coverage overlap from\nmeasurement error in household survey data, a key limitation\nof the existing literature. Directly measuring coverage with\nadministrative data greatly (if not entirely) reduces the possibil-\nity that coverage overlap reflects measurement error as opposed\nto a genuine phenomenon.\nPolicy Context: BadgerCare Plus\nWisconsin's BC+ program was launched in February of 2008\nand expanded upon Wisconsin's existing CHIP and Medicaid\nprogram. With the expansion, BC+ covered parents and care-\ntaker adults with family incomes up to 200 percent FPL.\nAdults with family incomes greater than 150 percent FPL\nwere charged sliding-scale premiums (premiums start at $10\nand are capped at 5 percent of family income).\nChildren of all incomes were eligible for BC+, though for\nboth adults and children with incomes above 150 percent FPL,\neligibility depended on not having access to affordable and\nqualified private insurance. Families of enrolled children with\nincomes greater than 200 percent FPL were also charged slid-\ning-scale premiums, provided a more limited set of covered\nservices, andcharged co-payments on non-preventive services.\nThe families of children with incomes greater than 300 percent\nFPL were required to pay the full cost of coverage, which\nUnder BC+, applicants with incomes over 150 percent\nFPL were subject to anti-crowd-out provisions. With good-\ncause exceptions, these individuals faced a three-month\nwaiting period for dropped coverage and cannot have been\noffered employer-sponsored insurance during the previous\ntwelve months.\nMethod\nThe methodological approach we take in this article is to use\na set of high-quality linked administrative data sets with\ninformation on a large number of individuals and their fami-\nlies to measure the percentage of new enrollees that were\npreviously uninsured. For a large proportion, we can mea-\nsure this percentage directly; for the remainder, we can both\nbound and estimate it. In the following sections, we first\ndescribe these data and how they were linked in detail. We\nthen describe the conceptual approach we use to measure\ncrowd-out, create bounds and estimates, and compare with\nthe literature.\nData and Sample Construction\nFor the analysis, we construct a longitudinal administrative\ndata set from four administrative databases:\nCARES: Wisconsin's administra-tive enrollment and pro-\ngram eligibility database,\nTPL: Wisconsin's Third Party Liability database,\nUI: Unemployment Insurance program quarterly wage\nrecords, and\nDOL: U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) database of all\nself-insured firms.\nTable 1 provides an overview of these data sets, including\nthe level and frequency of observation, how they are linked,\nand the purpose of their usage.\nThe main data source is an administrative enrollment\ndatabase, CARES, from the state of Wisconsin's Medicaid\nand CHIP programs, which was provided to us by agreement\nwith the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The unit\nof observation in this data set is an individual-month begin-\nning in the first month that individual enrolled in BC+\nysis, we use data from other case members; a case includes\nall individuals associated with eligibility determination (gen-\nerally, everyone in the applicant's household). Over this time\nperiod, we have monthly enrollment data for a total of\nTable 1.

From the\nincome data, we are able to observe whether the main source\nof income for a case is self-employment income.\nThe second data source is the TPL database. TPL is an\nindividual-level database that identifies all enrollees in state\nhealth insurance programs who are covered by a private\nhealth insurance plan. This database, while an excellent\nresource for our study, is limited in two ways. First, the data-\nbase does not contain individuals who are covered by health\ninsurance provided by a self-funded employer (whose poli-\ncies are not subject to state regulation and therefore cannot\nbe compelled to provide information to the TPL database).\nSecond, these data are available for each month in which an\nindividual is enrolled in BC+ but do not contain information\non the health insurance coverage of individuals in months\nprior to enrollment or following disenrollment. The database\ndoes identify individuals covered by fully insured employers\nas well as those with plans purchased in the non-group mar-\nket. Those enrollees who do not have insurance according to\nthe TPL database either do not have any source of private\ninsurance or have health insurance through a self-funded\nemployer. We match BC+ enrollees to the TPL database\nusing Social Security Numbers (SSNs).\nThe third data source, UI, is the state's records of employ-\ners' quarterly wage reports, which are required by the\nUnemployment Insurance program. The wage reports\ninclude the employee's SSN and quarterly wages and the\nemployer's Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)\nemployers not subject to unemployment insurance laws are\nexempt from reporting.2 Our primary purpose in matching\nour enrollees to UI is to obtain the FEIN of their employers\nand of the employers of their family members, which we\nthen use to identify those with self-insured employers.\nBecause employers who are exempt from UI reporting (such\nas independent contractors) are unlikely to provide a self-\nfunded health insurance plan, we are not concerned about\ntheir absence from the UI database. We match all BC+\nenrollees and their case members to the UI data by SSN.\nBecause the enrollment data are monthly, we assign a person\nto a firm for each month in the quarter in which we observe\nthem in UI. Those who are observed at multiple firms are\nassigned the FEIN of the employer from which they had the\nhighest earnings.\nWe also use the longitudinal nature of the UI data to iden-\ntify cases with a worker who had a job loss around the time\nof enrollment, as the UI data are available for all workers in\nCARES both prior to and post-enrollment. We define a job\nloss at the time of enrollment as going from having a UI job\nmatch from any firm in the quarter of enrollment in BC+ to\nhaving no job match from any firm in the following quarter.\nThe final administrative data source we use is from the\nDOL, obtained through a Freedom of InformationAct request,\nto determine whether a BC+ enrollee's or case member's\nemployer offers a self-funded plan. The DOL data represent\nthe universe of employers within the United States from 2003\nto 2007 that self-insured for health, life, and disability and\nrelated insurance plans. These data are used to administer the\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and are\npart of the reporting requirements of self-insured firms to the\nInternal Revenue Service. The DOL data are matched by\nFEIN to all enrollees that were successfully matched to UI.3\nMeans of enrollee characteristics are reported in Table 2.\nNotably, the youngest child in the family is under six for\nabout 60 percent of our sample. The vast majority of the\nsample consists of cases under 150 percent FPL; this is\nbecause much of the new enrollment in this expansion\noccurred in populations that were income-eligible even prior\nhouseholds earn the majority of their income from self-\nemployment (the definition we use for self-employed).4\nWe augment our administrative data with the Current\nPopulation Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement\n(CPS-ASEC) when we impute employer-sponsored insur-\nCPS-ASEC data have 11,418 Wisconsin respondents in total.\nOur analytical sample consists of employed men and women\nwho are eighteen to sixty-four years old. We further limit our\nsample to those living with at least one child under the age of\neighteen in the family to mimic the Medicaid eligibility cri-\nteria in Wisconsin, yielding an analytical sample of 2,685\nmen and women.5 The health insurance question in the CPS-\nASEC asks about coverage sources in the previous year.\nTableA1 of the appendix contains descriptive statistics of the\nsample population from the CPS-ASEC.\nConceptual Framework\nIn this article, we aim to directly measure the percentages of\nnew public insurance enrollees that were previously unin-\nsured and privately insured. This is a somewhat different\nmeasure of crowd-out than that in previous studies. To facili-\ntate comparison of our method with previous studies of\ncrowd-out and to clarify our approach, we develop a concep-\ntual framework in the following discussion.\nCrowd-out in response to an expansion in the income eli-\ngibility threshold from I\nto I\nthat occurs in year t is defined\nas the net change in private insurance coverage between t\nand t + 1 as a proportion of the net change in public insur-\nance coverage between t and t + 1 among the population\nwith incomes between I\nand I\n. Because private coverage\nmay change for reasons unrelated to the public insurance\nexpansion, the change in private coverage that would have\noccurred in the counterfactual world of no public insurance\nexpansion (in practice operationalized as the experience of\ncomparison populations--which, depending on the study,\ninclude across and/or within state individuals who experi-\nenced no change in public insurance eligibility) must be\nDague et al. 5\nsubtracted from this amount. Thus, the crowd-out rate\nresulting from an incremental expansion is given by\nT\nT\n=\n -\n-\n=\n-\nPrivate Private\nPublic Public\nPrivate Private\n\n \n \nC\nC\nC\nC\nPublic\nT\n,\nwhere T represents the actual expansion population (treat-\nment) and C represents the counterfactual expansion popula-\ntion (control). By assumption, the counterfactual net change\nin public insurance among the expansion population is zero.\nIf we take the additional step of decomposing the change in\nprivate insurance into the gross flows between insurance\nstates,\n Private Private Public\nPrivate Uninsured\nUninsured Pr\n= \n( )\n+ \n( )\n-  i\nivate\n( ),\nthen the numerator of equation (1) can be rewritten as\n \nPrivate Private\nivate Public\nPrivate Uninsured\nT c\nT\nT\n- =\n\n( )\n+ \n( )\nPr\n\n\n\n- \n( ) \n\n- \n( )\n\n\n-\nPr\nPr\nivate Uninsured\nUninsured ivate\nUninsure\nc\nT\nd\nd ivate\n\n( ) \n\nPr .\nc\nWe can measure the first term on the right-hand side of\nequation (3)--the number who transition from private insur-\nance to public insurance--directly in our administrative data.\nThe second term on the right-hand side of equation (3)--\nthe difference between the number who transition from pri-\nvate insurance to uninsured in the expansion and\ncounterfactual states--is of ambiguous sign. Some people\nwho would have moved from private to uninsured will now\nbe able to move from private to public, which would tend to\nmake this term negative. However, the expansion may lead\nTable 2.

We believe that this\nlatter effect is likely smaller than the former effect. This term\ncannot be measured using administrative data on enrollment\nas it does not involve enrollees in public insurance\nprograms.\nThe final term on the right-hand side of equation (3)--\nthe difference between the number who transition from\nuninsured to private insurance in the expansion and counter-\nfactual states--is if anything negative but probably small\n(Cutler and Gruber 1996; Shore-Sheppard, Buchmueller, and\nmight have added health insurance coverage (reducing the\nnumber of uninsured) but choose not to do so once public\nhealth insurance is expanded.\nThus, the direct measure of the number of people who\ntransition from private to public insurance in response to the\npublic insurance (which is what we measure in this article) is\nclosely related to what would appear in the numerator of an\nincremental crowd-out rate. It is exactly equal to the numera-\ntor of the incremental crowd-out rate if the rates of transition\nbetween private insurance coverage and being uninsured are\nunaffected by the public insurance expansion.\nThe denominator of the crowd-out rate is the net increase\nin public insurance coverage. This, too, can be decomposed\ninto flows into and out of public insurance:\nPublic Private Public\nUninsured Public\nPublic Unin\nT\n= \n( )\n+ \n( )\n-  s\nsured\nPublic Private\n( )\n- \n( )\nT\nT\n.\nWe can use administrative data to measure the gross flows\ninto public insurance coverage from being uninsured and\nfrom having private insurance coverage (the first two terms).\nThus, the difference between the sum of the two quantities\nthat we measure and the denominator of the crowd-out rate is\nthe difference between gross enrollment and net enrollment\ninto public insurance.\nEmpirical Analysis\nThe main focus of our analysis is to find the percentage of\nnew enrollees in public insurance that had private insurance\ncoverage at the time of enrollment. This quantity is closely\nrelated to previously used measures of crowd-out, as dis-\ncussed in the previous section. Here, we discuss our methods\nfor obtaining strict bounds for and point estimates of this per-\ncentage. Figure 1 serves as a guide to the analysis.\nThe first step is to identify those new BC+ enrollees that\nhad either private non-group insurance or ESI from a fully\ninsured firm at the time of enrollment. We do this by deter-\nmining whether an enrollee was covered by an insurance\nplan in TPL in the enrollment month. Any enrollee without a\nTPL match does not have non-group insurance or insurance\nfrom a fully insured firm in that month.\nThe second step is to identify new BC+ enrollees with\nESI from a self-insured firm. We do this by, first, finding\nenrollees who themselves are or have a case member who is\nemployed at a firm with a self-funded plan by using the\nUI-DOL match. We assume that it is not possible to have ESI\nfrom a self-insured firm without at least one family member\nbeing employed at a self-insured firm. Unlike the TPL match,\nhowever, this match on its own does not tell us whether a\nparticular enrollee was actually covered by ESI from a\nEnrollment\nData\nThird Party\nLiability\nUnemployment\nInsurance\nDepartment\nof Labor\nEnrollee is Insured\n(Fully-Insured Firm or\nNon-Group)\nEnrollee is Not\nInsured\nEnrollee is\nPossibly Insured\n(Self-Insured Firm)\nFigure 1. Process for determination of insurance status.\nNote. BC+ = BadgerCare Plus.\nDague et al. 7\nself-insured firm as not all workers at a self-insured firm will\nbe eligible for coverage. Some employees at firms that offer\nhealth insurance are themselves not eligible for health insur-\nance either because they work part-time, are in occupations\nthat are not covered, or have not been at the firm for a suffi-\ncient period of time. For example, Farber and Levy (2000)\nreport that in 1997, only 91 percent of workers in firms that\noffered health insurance were eligible for coverage. The\nmajority of the ineligible were part-time workers.\nWe use two alternative methods to address this missing\ninformation: (1) a strict bounds approach (Manski 1995) that\nuses only the administrative data and (2) a point estimate that\nimputes this information using survey data.\nThe strict bounds approach makes conservative assumptions\non the probability of an enrollee having ESI insurance coverage\nconditional on a case member being employed at a self-insured\nfirm. In it, we obtain strict upper bounds by assuming that 100\npercent of enrollees who are or who have a family member\nemployed at a self-insured firm have ESI coverage. We obtain\nstrict lower bounds by assuming that none of these enrollees\nhave ESI coverage. This method provides strict bounds because\nit encompasses the minimum and the maximum possible take-\nup of coverage by workers at self-insured firms.\nWe calculate the point estimate of the percentage of BC+\nenrollees with a case member employed by a self-insured firm\nthat were covered by that plan by first identifying those with\nthe potential for this type of coverage using the UI-DOL data\nas described above. Second, we estimate the probability of\ntheir enrollment in ESI using the results of a model estimated\nfrom survey data. In particular, we estimate a probit model\nwhere the dependent variable is an indicator for ESI coverage\nof the highest earning worker and the independent variables\nare various individual and family characteristics. We are\nrestricted in using only those variables that appear both in the\nsurvey data and in our administrative data. The means of these\nvariables in the CPS are listed in TableA1 of the appendix. We\nand calculate the predicted probabilities that the relevant case\nmembers will have ESI. We use three years of the CPS-ASEC\nfollowing Census Bureau guidelines for obtaining reliable\nstate-level estimates. We use the estimated coefficients from\nthe probit model to predict the probability of ESI coverage for\neach new enrollee with a case member who is employed at a\nself-insured firm. We use the average predicted probability as\nthe conditional probability for the relevant subgroup. We mul-\ntiply this estimate of the conditional probability by the number\nof enrollees to obtain the point estimate. Further details of the\nmodel and results are reported in the appendix.\nWe assume any enrollee with neither a TPL match nor a\ncase member with a DOL match is uninsured at the time of\nenrollment. In addition, we assume any enrollee with a job\nloss is uninsured at the time of enrollment regardless of TPL\nor DOL status.6\nIf all those with private health insurance at the time of\nenrollment in public programs dropped that coverage imme-\ndiately, the analysis would end here. However, it is possible\nthat some BC+ enrollees who have private insurance at the\ntime of enrollment maintain their private coverage. This\npossibility has been underexplored in the literature to date.\nTherefore, the third step in our analysis is to determine the\npercentage of enrollees that do drop their private coverage.\nIndividuals who do not drop their private insurance coverage\nin favor of public coverage have not substituted public cov-\nerage for private coverage, and thus we do not include them\nin our estimates of crowd-out. In such cases of dual cover-\nage, BC+ is the secondary payer.\nTo determine the percentage of enrollees that had private\ncoverage at the time of enrollment but subsequently dropped\nthat coverage, we once again use the TPL database that iden-\ntifies all BC+ enrollees with either private non-group cover-\nage or ESI coverage from a fully insured firm. We look six\nmonths post-enrollment. We count those individuals who\nhad coverage at the time of enrollment (month 1) but did not\nhave it in any of the following six months (months 2\u00ad7) and\nwere still enrolled in BC+ as having dropped their private\ncoverage. In the case of BC+ enrollment spells shorter than 7\nmonths, those that keep their private coverage for the entire\nenrollment spell are considered to not have dropped private\ncoverage and those who drop private coverage prior to disen-\nrollment are counted as having dropped private coverage.\nWe cannot directly observe the dropping of insurance\ncoverage among those with coverage from a self-insured\nfirm. When computing our strict lower and upper bounds,\nwe alternatively assume that all of these enrollees or that\nnone of these enrollees drop this coverage, as in our descrip-\ntion of the upper and lower bounds above.\nResults\nThis section, first, presents our estimates, based on adminis-\ntrative data, of the percentage of new Medicaid enrollees\nwho have private health insurance at the time of enrollment\nin the program and, second, reports the fraction that dropped\ntheir private coverage. We organize results into three time\nperiods--a period prior to the launch of BC+ (January\nand March 2008), and a post-expansion period (April\nexpansion period because of an auto-enrollment procedure\nand initial large jump in enrollment that occurred simultane-\nously with program launch. In addition, we report results for\nmultiple income categories (above and below 150 percent\nabove 300 percent FPL) and residents of rural and urban\ncounties. We do not report separate results for adults and\nchildren, as they differ little from one another.\nPercentage of Enrollees with Private Coverage at\nEnrollment\nTable 3 includes a summary of our calculations of the strict\nbounds for the percentage of newly enrolled individuals with\nprivate health insurance at the time they enrolled in BC+. We\nfind a lower bound of 13.6 percent on the percentage of\nenrollees with private health insurance at the time of enroll-\nment prior to the program expansion. As described above,\nthis lower bound assumes that no enrollees who did not have\nnon-group or ESI from a fully insured employer (based on\nTPL) and either themselves worked or had a family member\nwho worked at a self-insured firm were covered by that\nfirm's insurance plan.

But,\nas we will show below, a significant portion of enrollees\nmaintain their private coverage for at least six months fol-\nlowing enrollment into BC+.\nFigure 2 shows the monthly number of new enrollees,\nof new enrollees who were matched to the TPL data (and thus\nhad private insurance from a non-group plan or from a fully\ninsured employer-sponsored plan) but did not experience a\njob loss according to the UI data, and the number who were\nmatched to either TPL or DOL (indicating the additional pos-\nsibility of having coverage from a self-insured firm) and had\nno job loss. With the exception of February 2008, the number\nof enrollees in each category is fairly steady from month to\nmonth, with a slight upward trend in enrollment over the time\nperiod.\nFigure 3 illustrates the strict upper and lower bounds of\nthe percentage of new enrollees with private insurance cov-\nerage at the time of enrollment over time. The strict upper\nand lower bounds on this percentage are fairly steady within\ntime periods, are notably higher in February 2008, and are\nslightly higher in the post-reform period.\nAs an alternative to estimating strict bounds, we use sur-\nvey data to estimate the probability of ESI coverage and\napply those estimates to impute this probability among\nenrollees who are employed or who have a family member\nemployed at a self-insured firm. As described above, we use\nthe CPS to predict the probability of a worker having private\nhealth insurance conditional upon his or her employment sta-\ntus and demographic characteristics. The model is further\ndescribed in the appendix and its estimated parameters are\nreported in Table A2 of the appendix. When these parameters\nare applied to our administrative data, we estimate that on\naverage, 42 percent of enrollees who work for or who have a\nfamily member who works for a firm with a self-funded\ninsurance plan are covered by ESI.\nUsing this method, we then estimate the percentage of\nnew enrollees with private insurance at the time of enroll-\nTable 3.

During the initial program\nexpansion period, we estimate this percentage to be 34.4 per-\npost-BC+ expansion period, 21.2 percent (95 percent CI\n[20.0%, 22.3%]) of all enrollees had private insurance cover-\nage at the time of enrollment. These results are summarized\nin Table 3.\nTable 3 also presents the upper bounds, lower bounds, and\npoint estimates stratified by income as a percentage of FPL\nby whether the county of residence was urban (defined as\nMilwaukee, Waukesha, and Dane counties) or rural (all other\nWisconsin counties). Higher family income (as a percentage\nof FPL) was generally associated with a higher percentage of\nenrollees having private insurance at the time of enrollment.\nEnrollees living in urban as opposed to rural counties were\nslightly more likely to have private insurance.\nBecause our estimates rely on two very different sources\nof data--the TPL data for those with private coverage\nthrough non-group insurance or fully insured ESI and the\nDOL data for those potentially with coverage through self-\nfunded plans--we separate the sources of the estimates into\nthese two components in Table 4 to clarify these elements.\nFor example, of the 21.2 percent of new enrollees between\nhealth insurance at the time of enrollment, 16.0 percentage\npoints represent those with coverage from a non-group plan\nor fully insured ESI (TPL) and 5.2 percentage points is esti-\nmated to come from coverage from a self-insured firm\ncomes from TPL and 12.7 percent from DOL.\nWe also calculated these percentages separately for chil-\ndren and adults, although we do not report them because they\ndid not appreciably differ from one another. This is perhaps\nnot surprising because the adults in this study are parents (or\ncaretaker relatives), and children tend to have the same\nsources of private coverage as their parents.\nNumber of Enrollees\nTotal New Enrollees\nTPL Match or DOL Match, No Job Loss\nTPL Match, No Job Loss\nFigure 2.

Strict upper and lower bounds of the percent with private insurance at enrollment.\nPercentage of Enrollees That Dropped\nPrivate Coverage\nWe report our upper bound, lower bound, and point estimates\nof the percentage of enrollees who had private coverage at\nthe time of enrollment and subsequently dropped that cover-\nage in Table 5.\nDuring the pre-expansion period, 3.1 percent of new\nenrollees had dropped their private insurance coverage within\nsix months after their enrollment month according to our TPL\ndata match. This percentage is the lower bound. If, in addi-\ntion, all those employed at DOL firms had private coverage\nand dropped that coverage, a total of 16.4 percent of new\nenrollees would have dropped their private insurance cover-\nage. This percentage is the upper bound.\nThe upper and lower bounds for the expansion period are\nslightly higher. For February\u00adMarch 2008, we find a lower\nbound of 5.4 percent and an upper bound of 18.1 percent.\nwe find a lower bound of 4.7 percent and an upper bound of\nFigure 4 illustrates the strict upper and lower bounds of\nthe percentage of new enrollees that dropped private insur-\nance coverage within six months of enrollment over time.\nThe strict upper and lower bounds on this percentage are\nfairly steady across all time periods and are substantially\nlower than the bounds on the percentage with private insur-\nance at the time of enrollment shown in Figure 3.\nIf we predict the number of enrollees that have insurance\nfrom a self-insured firm using survey data (as described\nabove) and assume that none of them drop this coverage, we\nestimate that in the pre-expansion period, 8.9 percent (95\npercent CI [7.6%, 10.2%]) of enrollees dropped coverage\nsoon after enrollment in BC+. This percentage was only\nslightly higher in the transitional period at 10.7 percent (95\npercent CI [9.7%, 11.8%]). During the post-expansion\nperiod, we estimate that only 9.9 percent (95 percent CI\n[8.8%, 11.1%]) of new enrollees dropped private coverage\nwithin seven months of their enrollment date.\nAs with the estimates of the percentage of enrollees with\nprivate coverage at the time of enrollment, the estimates of\nthe percentage that dropped private coverage are higher for\nthose individuals in families with higher incomes as a per-\ncentage of FPL and are slightly higher for those enrollees\nwho reside in urban counties.\nDiscussion\nWisconsin's high-quality administrative data systems that\nallow linkages between databases tracking public insurance\nenrollment, private insurance coverage, and employment\nallows for precise measurement of the fraction of Medicaid\nenrollees that had private coverage at the time of enrollment\nand of the fraction that dropped this coverage. These longitu-\ndinal administrative data allow for the calculation of a mea-\nsure of crowd-out that is similar to that measured in the\nprevious literature. Our measure can help inform state and\nfederal policymakers of the likely impacts of state-level pub-\nlic insurance coverage expansions on participation in private\ninsurance markets.\nOur findings suggest that recent expansions toWisconsin's\nMedicaid/CHIP program did not lead to a substantial reduc-\ntion in private insurance coverage.

Moreover, they are low given that, at the time,\nWisconsin policy stipulated that individuals were eligible\nfor BC+ regardless of whether they had access to employer-\nsponsored insurance if either their family incomes were\nbelow 150 percent FPL or if they were required to pay more\nthan 20 percent of an ESI premium. The large increase in\npublic coverage in response to the BC+ expansion, there-\nfore, substantially reduced the ranks of the uninsured or\nadded secondary coverage to many families with private\ncoverage.\nOur estimates also indicate the existence of a relatively\nunexamined phenomenon--public insurance enrollees who\nhold both private and public coverage. A 2006 Government\nCPS data to study this issue finds that, nationally, 13 percent\nof those who have Medicaid for the entire year also had pri-\nvate coverage at some point during that year, which is consis-\ntent with our findings (GAO 2006). We have no direct\nevidence on what motivates enrollees to hold private and\npublic coverage simultaneously, although since Medicaid\nacts as a secondary payer in such cases, it may cover and\nexpand scope of services, reduce out-of-pocket costs to the\nenrollees, or allow them to remain with a current provider.\nWhile allowing dual coverage may seem unusual, it is not\nunique to Wisconsin. In 2010, we reviewed the websites for\neach state's Medicaid program to determine which states allow\nTable 5.

Most states' websites provided sufficient evidence to\ndetermine their dual coverage policy. When this was not the\ncase, we called the state's CHIP program office directly for\nfurther information. Nine states allowed some sort of dual\ncoverage with their CHIP program: Alaska, Idaho, Indiana,\nKansas, Maryland, Michigan, Oregon, South Dakota, and\nWisconsin. These dual coverage programs range in breadth\nfrom allowing children/families with private insurance to be\ndually covered, with income restrictions (Alaska, Idaho,\nIndiana, Kansas, Maryland, South Dakota, and Wisconsin), to\nonly allowing dual coverage in cases of underinsurance, again\nwith income restrictions (Michigan and Oregon). We were\nunable to determine the policy toward dual coverage in five\nstates (D.C., Hawaii, Maine, North Carolina, and Washington).\nThese states'websites were unclear on the subject of dual cov-\nerage and attempts to get more information by phone were\nunsuccessful. Thirty-seven states do not allow any sort of dual\ncoverage. That is, individuals must not have private coverage\nunder any circumstances to be eligible for these programs.\nA limitation of our study, and one shared by the previous\nliterature, is that we are unable to observe directly whether\nthe individuals in our administrative data discontinue cover-\nage voluntarily or whether their employers cease to offer it.\nIn Wisconsin, there have been slight trends toward reduced\nemployer offering and reduced employee take-up of\nemployer-sponsored health insurance (State Health Access\nWe do not claim to capture all dimensions in which public\ncoverage can substitute for private coverage. Specifically,\nwe focus on those individuals who actually enroll in Medicaid\nand had private insurance at the time of enrollment. If poten-\ntial enrollees are able to use Medicaid as an implicit insur-\nance plan, available when needed but not necessary to\nmaintain active enrollment, then we understate the degree of\nsubstitution. Most of our sample, however, would have no\neligibility incentive to drop private coverage and go unin-\nsured prior to taking up Medicaid given that BC+ premium\ncost-sharing does not apply to adults below 150 percent FPL\nand children below 200 percent FPL.\nFinally, the recession that began in late 2007 and wors-\nened throughout 2008 complicates the interpretation of the\ntransition and post-period results. Employers could have\nbeen making changes to benefits during this time that affected\nthe relative desirability of public and private insurance.\nDespite these limitations, our study accurately captures\nthe actual number of new Medicaid enrollees who substi-\ntute public coverage for private insurance and the number\nof new enrollees that were previously uninsured. Our study\nshows that using administrative data can yield credible esti-\nmates of the fraction of public health insurance program\nenrollees that have access to private health insurance.\nMoreover, it suggests that increases in public coverage in\nthe post-CHIP era do not necessarily incur widespread sub-\nstitution of public coverage for private coverage.\nAppendix\nWe report summary statistics for our CPS sample in TableA1.\nWe use this data to estimate a probit model of health insur-\nance coverage. The predictors in the probit models include\nsex, age, geographic location, age of the youngest child in the\nfamily, educational level, self-employment status, occupa-\ntional industry, firm size, earnings, and FPL. See Table A1 of\nthe appendix for descriptive statistics on the CPS sample.\nExcept for FPL and age of the youngest child, all variables\nare employment or demographic characteristics of the highest\nearner in a family. These variables were selected and con-\nstructed to match with the available information in adminis-\ntrative data. The age of the highest earner is coded into 18\u00ad34,\n35\u00ad54, and older than 54 years (reference group). The educa-\ntional level of the highest earner is coded into less than high\nschool (reference group), high school graduation or general\neducation development test (GED) but no college education,\nand at least one year of college education. The size of the\nemployer is coded into a dichotomous variable, with less than\n100 as the reference group. The yearly earnings of the highest\n(reference).

FPL = federal poverty level; CPS =\nCurrent Population Surveys.\nWe use two indicators to identify the residential counties\nthat are more diverse and highly urbanized: living in Dane\ncounty (mainly Madison) and living in Milwaukee or\nWaukesha counties. We first intended to separate urban and\nrural residential areas. Although CPS contains geographic\ninformation sufficient for our purpose, the administrative\ndata only have residential county. We thus created two indi-\ncators of urban counties to match both data sets. We cannot\nseparate Milwaukee from Waukesha in the CPS data.\nWe create a dichotomous indicator for the goods-producing\nindustries, which were identified as agriculture/forestry,\nmining, construction, and manufacturing industries in the\nmajor industry code.Age of the youngest child is categorized\ninto being younger than six, six to twelve (reference), and\nolder than twelve. We also control for the survey year.\nWe use probit models to estimate the probability of having\nprivate insurance among workers. Table A2 of the appendix\nshows the marginal effects from the probit model. Because all\nvariables are binary, the table reports the marginal effects of\ngoing from 0 to 1 for each. Our results suggest that residential\narea, earnings, industry, firm size, educational level, and fam-\nily poverty levels predict the probability of having private\ninsurance well. The workers from smaller firms and workers\nin non-goods producing industries are less likely to have\nhealth insurance. Earning and FPL are positively associated\nwith having health insurance. The workers living in the two\nlargest metropolitan counties in Wisconsin are more likely to\nhave private insurance than those living in other areas. Self-\nemployment is negatively associated with private insurance.\n"
