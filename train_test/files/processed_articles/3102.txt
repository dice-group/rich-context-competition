First, what are the individual (or micro) determinants and\nstate-level (macro) determinants of welfare states that influence people's willingness to\ndonate money to the poor? Second, to what extent do individual determinants for donat-\ning money to the poor interact with state-level determinants? To answer these two ques-\ninhabitants from 15 European countries. Hypotheses are tested using logistic multi-level\nanalyses. The results show that religion, economic situation, political stances and types of\nwelfare regimes influence people's willingness to help the poor. Interestingly, education\nand living conditions interact with types of welfare regimes.\nPoverty in Europe:\nIntroduction and Questions\nIn 1984, the Council of the European Community pro-\nposed a multidimensional definition of poverty, refer-\nring to severe restrictions on material, cultural and\nsocial resources that exclude people from minimal par-\nticipation in European societies. In research, however,\na working definition has often been applied that\nincludes only the material dimension: those who are\nbelow a line of relative poverty are considered to be\npoor. Mikulic (1996) shows that poverty is unequally\ndistributed across European countries.1 The extent to\nwhich poor people are supported by the state they live\nin may differ across these European countries as social\nsecurity arrangements and expenditures differ strongly\nacross countries that have been shown to belong to dif-\nferent welfare state regimes (Esping-Andersen, 1990,\n1999). Moreover, the amount of money donated volun-\ntarily by individuals to alleviate poverty may also\ndepend on the country they live in (Social and Cultural\nPlanning Office, 2000). Although many authors sug-\ngest that living in different welfare regimes may have\nquite different consequences for individual citizens,\nmost studies mainly focus on attitudes related to wel-\nGevers et al., 2000). We, instead, will focus on the will-\ningness to donate money to the poor, directly or indi-\nrectly, in order to alleviate poverty, implying some\ndegree of solidarity with poor people who might feel\nsocially excluded. Historically, this type of behaviour\nhas been and continues to be in contemporary societies\na rather central issue in welfare state policies. As yet,\nprevious European research has not shed any light on\nwhether individual characteristics (such as level of education\nand gender) and typical welfare state arrangements\naffect people's willingness to donate money to the\npoor. Consequently, we also do not know whether\nthese welfare state arrangements interact with individ-\nual characteristics. Therefore we set out to answer the\nfollowing questions:\nWhat are the individual (or micro) determinants and\nstate-level (macro) determinants that influence people's\nmonetary donations to the poor?\nTo what extent do individual determinants for donat-\ning money to the poor interact with state-level determi-\nnants?\nTheories and Hypotheses\non Determinants for Helping\nthe Poor\nWe start off by exploring theories from which we\nderive hypotheses on individual determinants for\nhelping the poor, considering this type of behaviour\nto be conceptually related to helping behaviour (Lee\none set of theories is that it is particularly people who\nare socially integrated within groups in which the\nsocial norm for helping poor people is strongly preva-\nlent, that will tend to donate money to the poor.\nThese theories therefore focus on social groups, such\nas religious denominations, which are generally con-\nsidered to proclaim and transfer such norms to their\nmembers (e.g. Batson et al., 1993). Other theories\nassume that, whereas the desire to donate money to\nothers may be equally distributed in society, the\nresources to donate are unequally divided across the\nsystem of social stratification. Therefore they focus on\n(economic) resources required to donate money to\nthe poor (Wilson and Musick, 1997). Yet further the-\nories assume that particular personal values or prefer-\nences, or more generally prosocial motives may affect\ndonating money to the poor (e.g. Berking, 1999).\nSince we consider these theories to be mutually com-\nplementary, we will set out to derive hypotheses on\nindividuals' religiosity and economic resources, as\nwell as on (political) motives for donating money to\nthe poor. Moreover, we will consider the national\ncontexts in which individuals donate money to the\npoor. Hence, we will set out to derive hypotheses\nfrom a theory on welfare arrangements--arrange-\nments that may interact with individual determinants\nfor donating money to the poor.\nIndividuals' Religion: Denomination and\nChurch Attendance\nMany, if not all, of the world religions explicitly teach\ntheir followers to have compassion for the poor in gen-\neral (Batson et al., 1993). Instead of focusing on the time\nor money spent on one's own religious organizations\nfocus on people donating money to alleviate poverty in\ngeneral. Elaboration of distinctions between denomina-\ntions to the extent that they donate money to alleviate\npoverty reveals contradictory theoretical considerations\nand inconsistent empirical patterns, at least in research\nusing U.S. samples. Some researchers found that Protes-\ntants were less generous than Catholics and non-mem-\nbers (Will and Cochran, 1995), whereas others found\nexactly the opposite pattern (Hodgkinson and Weitz-\nman, 1992). In any case, it seems worth investigating\nwhether there are differences between denominations in\nEurope with regard to the amount of money spent to\nalleviate poverty. We will elaborate on these differences\nand formulate hypotheses to be tested.\nFrom Durkheim's classic work on suicide (1897/\n1966), a general proposition can be derived: the more\nstrongly people are integrated within a social group, e.g.\nthe Church, the more strongly they will comply with the\nnorms of that social group (Stark, 1994). Since caring for\nthe poor is quite generally a social norm advocated by\nreligious denominations, we hypothesize that people\nbelonging to a denomination are more likely to donate\nmoney to the poor than non-members (hypothesis 1a).\nBekkers (2003) recently suggested more specific propo-\nsitions. He states that it is particularly people belonging\nto rather small denominations that may be more\ninclined to take this social norm more seriously, due to\nsmall-scale social control. Hence, we hypothesize\n(hypothesis 1b) that people belonging to minor denomi-\nnations, such as non-Christian denominations that are\nreligious minorities all over Europe, are more likely to\ndonate money to the poor, even more so than people\nbelonging to major denominations.\nHowever, the mere membership of a certain denomi-\nnation tells us little about the exposure to or compliance\nwith the norm of that denomination. Church attend-\nance, on the other hand, does to some extent: the more\nfrequently people attend church, the more they are\nexposed to the social norm for caring for the poor. Con-\nsequently, using Durkheim's general proposition on\nintegration, we hypothesize that the more frequently\npeople attend church, the more they will be inclined to\ndonate money to the poor frequently (hypothesis 2).\nIndividuals' Socio-Economic Situation:\nEducation, Social Class, Income, and Living\nConditions\nHistorical analyses of European initiatives to help the\npoor show that throughout history, fighting poverty\nhas generally been considered a Christian duty, being\none primarily fulfilled by privileged citizens. These cit-\nizens could afford charitable gifts to the poor, not only\nout of Christian altruism, but also out of collective\nself-defence to prevent the poor from rebellion and\ncrime (De Swaan, 1988). In contemporary societies,\nwe also expect the more privileged people to spend\nmore money to alleviate poverty than the less privi-\nleged. There does exist some evidence that supports\nthis hypothesis (Regnerus et al., 1998). To indicate\none's economic (privileged) situation we use income,\nlevel of education, social class and present living con-\nditions. This results in the following hypotheses to be\ntested: the higher people's level of education (hypoth-\nesis 3), the higher people's social class (hypothesis 4),\nthe higher people's income (hypothesis 5), and the\nbetter people's present living conditions (hypothesis\n6), the more frequently they donate money to alleviate\npoverty.\nPolitical Ideologies as Individual\nDeterminants: Left/Right Placement and\nPost-Materialism\nDonating money to alleviate poverty may also be\nrelated to political stances and may help to explain why\nthe individual determinants mentioned above are\nrelated to caring for the poor. Traditionally, left-wing\nparties have often taken the lead in proposing social\nchange towards greater equality and reduction of pov-\nerty, whereas right-wing parties have been and are\nknown to emphasize one's individual responsibility to\novercome poverty and hence have often refrained from\npolicies to fight it (NieuwBeerta, 1995). Accordingly,\nwe hypothesize that those who consider themselves to\nbe left-wing in political respect, tend to donate money\nto alleviate poverty more frequently than those who\nconsider themselves to be right-wing (hypothesis 7).\nFrom Inglehart's (1977) general notions about the\nsocial characteristics of people who are defined as\nbeing `post-materialists' (i.e. stress goals in life such as\nfreedom of speech) and those being defined as `materi-\nalists' (emphasize economic stability), we expect the\nformer to donate money to alleviate poverty more fre-\nquently than the latter (hypothesis 8).\nIndividuals' Background: Age and\nGender\nSchuyt (2003) suggests that older people and women are\nmore compassionate towards their fellow citizens.\nTherefore we take these characteristics into account as\ncontrol variables, which may relate to religion, economy,\nand political stances, on the one hand, and donating\nmoney to alleviate poverty, on the other. We expect the\nrelation between age and donating money to alleviate\npoverty to be positive: the older people are, the more fre-\nquently they will donate money to alleviate poverty. On\nthe basis of the traditional notion that, on average,\nwomen are more inclined to care for others, we expect\nwomen to donate money more frequently than men.\nState-Level Determinants: Types of\nWelfare Regimes\nNot only individual, but also state-level determinants\nmay explain individuals' behaviour towards poverty.\nAccording to Esping-Andersen's theory on the develop-\nment of states `...in the Middle Ages, it was...the family,\nthe church, or the lord that decided a person's capacity\noppression, these institutions provided individuals with\n`pre-commodified' social protection. This protection\ngradually decreased with the rise of capitalism in which\nlabour power became a commodity. This process\ndecreased individuals' dependence on the old institu-\ntions and increased freedom of choice, although it was\nrestricted by new dependencies: `a freedom behind new\nBorn out of necessity, however, a historical process of\nde-commodification occurred in which individuals'\nindependence increased once again. According to Esp-\ning-Andersen, even today, individuals from various\nEuropean countries differ strongly in terms of `de-com-\nmodification', i.e. the freedom and increasing opportu-\nnities to opt out of work and still uphold acceptable\nstandards of living. In case de-commodification is high,\nmarket dependency is low, due to state-level arrange-\nments that prevent people suffering from poverty in the\ncase of unemployment or retirement. Esping-Andersen\nclassifies welfare states into distinct types of regimes\naccording to their level of de-commodification.\nThe social-democratic regime (typically: the Nordic\ncountries) has a relatively high level of de-commodifica-\ntion as social security benefits are at a high level com-\npared to other regimes. In these states, social policy\ndeveloped by the state strives to weaken the influence of\nthe market on distribution. Its ideal is to maximize\ncapacities for individual independence to overcome\npoverty by granting transfers directly to the helpless\nstate that there is indeed a strong tendency in the Scan-\ndinavian countries to collectivize caring. Consequently,\nwe expect that living in such a regime reduces citizens'\ninclination to donate money to alleviate poverty, as this\ntask may be perceived to be taken care of by the welfare\nstate. In a similar vein, the Dutch Scientific Council for\nsuch state policies have substituted or even oppressed\nformer informal help to the effect that informal solidar-\nity has decreased.\nThe conservative-corporatist regime (typically: France\nand the former West Germany) has been shaped by the\nChurch with a strong emphasis on traditions--such as\nthose of the family--and pre-existing class and status\nstructures. This type of regime is only likely to interfere\nin individuals' lives if their families' resources to pro-\nvide help have been exhausted: only then does it pro-\nvide social security benefits on the basis of previous\nearnings and status. This eventually implies that the\nfamily is the dominant locus of solidarity (Esping-\nsubsidiarity, and the level of de-commodification is\nthis characterization, we infer that this type of regime\nproduces more inclination to donate money to allevi-\nate poverty than the social-democratic regime. How-\never, given the crucial position of the family, solidarity\nwith the poor may be restricted to people's primary\ngroup, implying that people will not donate much\nmoney to reduce poverty in general.\nThe liberal regime (typically: the Anglo-Saxon coun-\ntries) is characterized by an even lower level of de-com-\nmodification. Here, the market is considered to be the\nmain arena for the distribution of resources, and social\nsecurity benefits are modest and social rights generally\nrather poor. This type of regime produces a high degree\nof independence from the state and, as a consequence,\noffers individuals less help to fight social catastrophes\nthese characteristics, we infer that this type of regime\nproduces strong social networks of family and friends,\npossibly necessary to provide the means to participate in\nsociety, and if necessary, reduce poverty. Therefore we\nexpect that living in this regime will affect the inclination\nto donate money to alleviate poverty positively.\nHowever, there is another type of regime that may\nproduce even more willingness to alleviate poverty.\nBonoli, 1997) argued for the Mediterranean countries\n(typically: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece) to be consid-\nered as a separate regime: the Latin Rim. In this type of\nregime, instead of an official level of social security, an\nunderdeveloped system of social security exists. In the\nLatin Rim the percentage of old people receiving home-\nhelp services is low, whereas the percentage of old people\nliving with their children is extremely high (Esping-\ninfer that living in this type of regime makes people\naware of the fact that poverty is not so much a state's\nissue and hence may force people to lend a helping hand\nin instances of poverty. Therefore we expect this type of\nregime to produce the highest level of donating money\nto alleviate poverty. Consequently, we hypothesize that\nthe people's willingness to alleviate poverty is rank-\nordered: the lowest willingness is to be found in social-\ndemocratic states, a higher willingness in conservative-\ncorporatist states, an even higher willingness in liberal\nstates, and the highest willingness in Latin Rim states\n(hypothesis 9).\nHowever, quite a different rank-order may be\ndeveloped by authors who propose that there may be\ncommunicating vessels between formal and informal\ntypes of solidarity. If one considers social-democratic\nwelfare regimes to stand out in developing policies that\nfoster formal as well as informal types of solidarity\nin regimes with the highest level of de-commodification\n(i.e. social-democratic states) are the most likely to\ndonate money to alleviate poverty, followed by conser-\nvative-corporatist states, whereas liberal states and states\nbelonging to the Latin Rim may be considered to be\nstates that harbour people with the lowest inclination to\ndonate money to alleviate poverty (hypothesis 10).\nIndividual Determinants Affected by\nState-Level Determinants: Cross-Level\nInteractions\nAll the above-mentioned hypotheses imply that there is\nno interaction between individual determinants and\ntypes of regimes. We hypothesize generally that religious\npeople are more likely to donate money to alleviate pov-\nerty than non-members (hypotheses 1 and 2). This is\nimplicitly said to be true for every type of welfare state.\nClearly, this is a rather strong assumption and could be\nquestioned on several grounds. For instance, if a state's\ncommitment to preventing poverty is low (e.g. in the\nLatin Rim), religious people may indeed be more\nstrongly inclined to donate money to alleviate poverty\nthan non-members since there is no collective provision.\nIn states where the state's commitment is high (e.g. in\nsocial-democratic states), religious people's incentives to\nhelp the poor could be somewhat oppressed since there\nis a collective provision. Hence, we expect that the effects\nof religiosity vary across welfare states: the effect may be\nstronger in Latin Rim states than in social-democratic\nstates (hypothesis 11). Another example is the relation-\nship between people's economic situation and their will-\ningness to donate money to the poor (hypotheses 3\u00ad6).\nIt seems safe to assume that people who live in bad eco-\nnomic conditions will not donate much money to allevi-\nate poverty, no matter what welfare state they live in. If\npeople live in rather sound economic conditions, how-\never, the type of regime will presumably make a differ-\nence. In the Latin Rim regime, for example, privileged\npeople's willingness to donate money to alleviate pov-\nerty may be strong in order to substitute collective\narrangements that are almost absent. In social-democratic\nstates, privileged people's willingness to donate money\nto the poor is presumably much less since there are col-\nlective arrangements. However, privileged people in lib-\neral states may consider poverty an individual's own\nresponsibility and may therefore oppose any state inter-\nference or individual acts, leading privileged individuals\nto refrain from commitments to alleviate poverty, even\nmore strongly than in social-democratic states. Therefore\nwe expect the effects of economic living conditions to vary\nacross welfare state regimes accordingly (hypothesis 12).\nData and Measurements\nTo test our hypotheses, we used secondary data derived\nfrom the Eurobarometer 40 survey (Commission of the\nEuropean countries in 1993. This survey was especially\ndesigned to describe poverty in Europe and includes\nvalid and reliable data on several dimensions of depriva-\ntion and social exclusion as well as on important indi-\nvidual characteristics such as income and religion. The\nsamples constituting the Eurobarometer 40 were drawn\naccording to a multi-stage random design. First, admin-\nistrative regions were drawn proportional to population\nsize. Second, a cluster of random starting addresses was\ndrawn from within these regions. Subsequently, further\naddresses were selected by a random route procedure.\nFinally, at each address the respondent was selected\nrandomly. For more detailed information on the Euro-\nbarometer sampling strategy and survey design, see:\nhttp://europa.eu.int/comm/dg10/epo.\nDependent Variable: Donating Money\nto Alleviate Poverty\nTo measure people's willingness to alleviate poverty we\nuse a straightforward question from the survey: `In the\nlast twelve months have you given money directly or\nindirectly to help the people who are living in poverty or\nare socially excluded?'. Possible answers were: never, sel-\ndom, sometimes, and regularly. Because of the ordinal\ncharacter of the measurement, we decided to collapse\nthe four categories into a dichotomy: never/seldom and\nsometimes/regularly.2\nIndependent Individual Variables\nIndividuals' religiosity was measured using questions on\ndenomination and church attendance. We distinguished\nbetween four denominations: Protestant, Catholic, other\nnon-Christian (such as Jewish, Muslim and Hindu) and\nthe non-religious. Church attendance was measured\non a 5-point scale ranging from never to several times a\nweek.\nIndividuals' economic situations were measured using\nquestions on education, social class, present living con-\nditions and income. To measure the level of education,\nEurobarometer surveys use the age at which people\ncompleted their full-time education (range 6\u00ad28).\nRespondents' social class was measured using an index\nthat closely resembles the widely used EGP categoriza-\ntion. We distinguished between higher professionals,\nlower professionals, non-manual workers, self-\nemployed, and manual workers. Moreover, we added\npresently non-employed categories such as unemployed,\nretired, housewives and students. To measure the\npresent living conditions, we constructed a Likert-scale\nconsisting of 11 items directly measuring aspects of pov-\nerty such as quality of housing, living, health, and leisure\ntime. The scale turned out to be highly reliable (Cron-\nbach's alpha 0.86). Income was measured objectively by\nreferring to the total amount of money available on a\nmonthly basis (i.e. from all household members, includ-\ning wages, salaries, and rents) and was standardized for\nreasons of comparability.3\nTo test whether political stances influence people's\nwillingness to alleviate poverty, we used a standard 4-\nitem measurement of post-materialism and a standard\n10-point scale to indicate left-wing/right-wing position.\nIndependent Contextual Variables:\nWelfare States\nAt the contextual level, we made distinctions between\nwelfare states. Arts and Gelissen (1999) have shown a\nremarkable consistency in classifying countries since the\nfounding work of Esping-Andersen. Reviewing the state\nof the art, they ascertained that all authors agree that\nGreat Britain and Ireland belong to the liberal-leaning\ntype of regime. Furthermore, all authors agree that the\nNordic countries belong to the social-democratic regime\ncategory, including Denmark. On the basis of 58 charac-\nteristics collected in 11 welfare states, Wildeboer Schut\net al. (2000) show that there are ample empirical reasons\nto include the Netherlands in this category too. There\nhave also been some disputes over the countries that\nbelong to the conservative-corporatist states. Again,\nWildeboer Schut et al. (2000) show convincingly that\nBelgium, France and West Germany belong to this cate-\ngory. We decided to add Luxembourg to this category,\nbecause it is in the geographical and economical prox-\nimity of these three countries. Since Leibfriend's study\n(1992), most authors agree that Spain, Italy, Portugal\nand Greece belong to the Latin Rim states. This left us\nwith East Germany as a special case, often ignored in\nprevious studies. We assumed that this country\nbelonged to the social-democratic camp, since the\npeople included in the samples have been exposed to the\nsocialist regime of the German Democratic Republic for\nmost of their lives. To test this assumption, we treated\nthis country as a separate (dummy) variable.\nAnalyses\nAs our hypotheses and our data are hierarchically struc-\ntured, i.e. individuals living in different countries, and as\nour dependent variable is treated as dichotomous, we\nuse logistic multi-level regression analyses (Bryk and\nand Bosker, 1999). In a first analysis we estimated the\namount of variance at the individual level and at the\ncountry level. At both levels the variance was significant\nwhich implies that multi-level analysis is appropriate. In\na second step, we analysed the impact of each independ-\nent variable separately in a set of simple regression anal-\nyses with random intercepts, to take into account the\ndifferences between countries. In a third step we\nexplored the variation in the effects found in step 2 by\nadding random slopes to the model to test whether they\nreached significance. Then, we estimated parameters\nwith a multiple multi-level regression model, presented\nin the second column of Table 1 with standard errors in\nthe third column. In a further step we examined whether\nthe random slopes that we found to be significant related\nsystematically to the types of welfare states. In a final\nstep we included all individual and state-level character-\nistics together with the significant cross-level interac-\ntions found in the previous steps in a second multiple\nmulti-level model, presented in the fourth and fifth col-\numns of Table 1.\nResults\nVariance between Individuals and\nCountries\nWe found a significant amount of variance at both lev-\nels, meaning that the frequencies of donating money to\nalleviate poverty differ between individuals and between\ncountries. To illustrate the latter, we estimated for each\ncountry the proportion of citizens that donate money to\nalleviate poverty sometimes or regularly (see Figure 1).\nFigure 1 shows considerable variance between coun-\ntries.4 Interestingly, the countries that are labelled as lib-\neral countries (i.e. Great Britain, Ireland and Northern\nIreland) seem to have the largest proportion of citizens\nthat regularly donate money, whereas the conservative-\ncorporatist states (France, Belgium, Luxembourg and\nthe former West Germany) have the lowest proportions.\nIn between these two extremes of liberal versus conser-\nvative-corporatist states, we find Latin Rim states, such\nas Spain and Italy, and social-democratic states such as\nNorway and Denmark. East Germany seems to be closer\nto the conservative-corporatist states than to the social-\ndemocratic states. This rank order does not lend much\nsupport to either of the rank orders hypothesized. How-\never, Figure 1 does not tell the whole story as composi-\ntional effects, such as that of religiosity, have not been\ntaken into account. Therefore, in the next section, we\nwill estimate parameters for all types of regimes, also\ntaking individual differences into account.\nMultiple Multi-Level Regression Analyses\nwith Random Intercepts\nBecause many of the individual determinants (denomi-\nnation, church attendance) are related, we performed a\nmultiple regression analysis to put our hypotheses to a\nrigorous test. First, we assumed that there is no interac-\ntion between individual determinants and types of\nregimes. Subsequently, we added significant interactions\nto the model.\nTable 1 Parameter estimates (logit coefficients) from multiple multi-level logistic regression analysis, random intercept\nIndependent variables Money donated to alleviate poverty\nFixed effects1 Interactions\nEstimate Standard error Estimate Standard error\nDenomination\nChurch attendance\nEducational attainment\nSocial class\nLiving conditions\nGender\ncontinued\nReligion\nAccording to Table 1, the differences between Protestants,\nCatholics and non-members turn out to be non-signific-\nant in this model: this refutes hypothesis 1a. This is\nmainly due to the inclusion of church attendance. Table 1\nshows that people who attend church several times a week\nare most likely to donate money to alleviate poverty, and\nthis likelihood decreases as attendance is less frequent,\nwhich corroborates hypothesis 2. These findings imply\nthat it is not so much denominational membership that\ndetermines the help provided to the poor, but rather\nchurch attendance, which we consider to be a more valid\nindicator of exposure to religious norms advocated by\nchurch leaders. However, this line of reasoning does not\napply to members of non-Christian denominations: we\nfind that people belonging to this religious category\nTable 1 (continued)\n1Fixed effects and random intercept.\n2Effect in liberal type, all other parameters are deviations from effect in liberal type.\n3Effects within average educational attainment and average living conditions.\nns = non-significant ( = 5 per cent, one-tailed) deviation from base-level.\n(Post)-materialism\nTypes of regimes3\nFigure 1 Estimated average proportion of citizens that sometimes or regularly spend money to alleviate poverty in 15 Euro-\npean countries\ndonate money more frequently than non-members,\nwhich is in accordance with hypothesis 1b. 5\nEconomic Situation\nNext, we found that level of education has a positive and\nsignificant effect, which is in accordance with hypothesis 3,\neven after controlling for income, social class and living\nconditions. This might be due to the educational content\nitself if one supposes that here norms are taught similarly to\nthose in churches. Social class differences are significant. All\nclass categories donate less frequently than higher profes-\nsionals which supports hypothesis 4. Self-employed people\ndo not differ significantly from higher professionals,\nwhereas most of the other class categories do. Students,\nunemployed people and retired people stand out because\nthey donate least frequently compared to the higher profes-\nsionals. Income has a positive effect on donating money to\nalleviate poverty, which supports hypothesis 5. It is interest-\ning to note that our analyses show that people who refused\nto tell (or did not know) their income, appear to donate\nmoney to alleviate poverty less frequently, compared to\nthose who gave a valid answer. This may indicate that these\ncategories have in fact a low income. The effect of living\nconditions implies that those in more privileged positions\ndonate more frequently, which supports hypothesis 6. The\neffects of age and gender are significant: older people are\nmore likely to donate money to the poor, compared to\nyounger people, and men are less likely to donate money to\nthe poor, compared to women.\nPolitical Stances\nIn line with hypothesis 7, we found that people who said\nthey belong to the left, turn out to donate money to\nalleviate poverty more frequently than people consider-\ning themselves to belong to the right wing of the political\nspectrum. People who did not know their political\norientation were found to donate money to alleviate\npoverty significantly less frequently. Materialists and\nmixed types are less likely to donate money to alleviate\npoverty compared to post-materialists, which supports\nhypothesis 8.\nWelfare States\nWith regard to donating money to the poor, all parame-\nters in Table 1 deviate significantly and negatively from\nthe liberal countries. This implies that people within the\nliberal states donate money to the poor more frequently\nthan people in any other regime. The people living in\nconservative-corporatist states are the least likely to\ndonate money to the poor. The former East Germany\ntakes a position that is similar to the latter states:\nthese people are the least likely to donate money to\nalleviate poverty than people in any other regime. The\nscores of people living in social-democratic states and\nin the Latin Rim are close to each other and in\nbetween the two other types of regimes, i.e. in\nbetween liberal and conservative-corporatist states.\nAll in all, we (again) found no conclusive support for\nMultiple Multi-Level Regression Analyses\nwith Random Intercepts and Interactions\nTo determine which interactions should be included in\nthe multiple model, we first added random slopes to a\nset of simple regression analyses in order to explore\nwhether there was any significant between-country vari-\nation. If so, we subsequently included interaction terms\nbetween individual determinants and the types of\nregimes in order to explain this observed variance. It\nturned out that this between-country variation reached\nsignificance in two cases: level of education and living\nconditions. In all other cases the variation was small and\nnon-significant. This finding actually implies that we\nhave to refute hypothesis 11 on the differential effects of\nreligiosity. To test whether the effects of level of educa-\ntion and living conditions vary systematically, as we pro-\nposed in hypothesis 12, we explored interactions with\ntypes of regimes in the multiple model (see Table 1,\nfourth and fifth columns). As all other effects remained\nvirtually the same, we will focus on these two variables.\nThe general positive effect of level of education, as previ-\nously described, varies across welfare type states. The\nstrongest effect was found in liberal welfare states\n.086). In the other types of regimes, especially the social-\ndemocratic states and the Latin Rim states, the effect is\nant cross-level interaction refers to living conditions. In\ngeneral we found that the worse people's living condi-\ntions were, the less people were inclined to donate\nmoney to alleviate poverty. Again, the strongest negative\neffect was found within the liberal states, whereas the\neffect in the other regimes was smaller, although only\nsignificantly so within the conservative-corporatist\nregime.\nThe interaction parameters of level of education and\nliving conditions indicate that their effects are different\nacross welfare regimes. To illustrate these two significant\ninteractions, we depict the regression slopes of level of\neducation and living conditions for different welfare\nregimes in Figure 2.\nAs Figure 2 shows, the regression slopes of level of\neducation are quite different. This means that the pos-\nitive effect of level of education as described above var-\nies across welfare state regimes. The strongest effect\n(i.e. the steepest slope) of level of education could be\nfound within the liberal type and in the former East\nGermany. Within the other types of regimes, the slopes\nare less steep, which means that the effects are less\nstrong. As a consequence, we see much more variation\nin donating money to alleviate poverty among the\nlower educated, whereas among the highest educated\nthe differences are restricted to a dichotomy: liberal\nversus other types of regimes. This means that, among\nthe lower educated, it indeed matters in which type of\nregime they live. The lower educated in the Latin Rim,\nfor instance, are more likely to donate money to the\npoor than the lower educated in conservative-corporatist\nstates. This difference between these two types of\nregimes gradually disappears altogether among the\nhighest educated. In other words, there is no constant\nrank order of types of regimes across different levels of\neducation.\nThe effect of living conditions also interacts with wel-\nfare state regimes. Where the living conditions are above\naverage, the tendency to donate money to alleviate poverty\nis rather high and varies across types of regimes, where\nthe privileged people in liberal states stand out. Among\npeople living under bad conditions, the willingness to\ndonate money is less, as one might expect, and it hardly\ndepends on the type of regime they live in. Again, as a\nconsequence of this interaction, the rank order between\nwelfare states is not constant and depends on living con-\nditions. Clearly these findings refute hypotheses 9 and 10\nonce more.\nConclusions and Discussion\nThe questions we addressed relate to the impact of both\nindividual and state-level determinants on caring for the\npoor in Europe, using a straightforward indicator to\nmeasure people's willingness to donate money to poor\npeople. Moreover, we focused on the interaction\nbetween individual and state-level determinants.\nOur first question referred to individual and state-\nlevel characteristics of people helping the poor. We\nfound that, after taking into account the fact that\ndenominations have different church attendance rates,\npeople belonging to Protestant and Catholic denomina-\ntions do not differ significantly from non-members.\nHence, it is not so much membership of denominations\nas such that determines donating money to the poor, but\nrather church attendance: the more people attend\nchurch, the more likely they are to help the poor, which\nsupports our second hypothesis. People belonging to\nnon-Christian denominations, however, stand out: these\npeople were found to donate money to alleviate poverty\nmore frequently than any other category related to relig-\niosity. The refutation of hypothesis 1a on differences\nbetween denominations and the corroboration of\nhypothesis 2 on church attendance is rather consistent\nwith findings from the U.S. (Hodgkinson and Weitzman,\nsupports the general proposition in Durkheim's theory\non integration. The finding that non-Christian religious\npeople donate more frequently is rather new and quite\nunderstandable from the perspective of integration the-\nWe also found support for our hypotheses about the\nimpact of people's economic situation (hypotheses 3\u00ad6):\nespecially highly educated people, people belonging to\nthe high professionals, people with higher incomes and\nFigure 2 Estimated effects of education and living conditions within five types of welfare regimes\npeople in good living conditions are more likely to donate\nmoney to alleviate poverty. These findings are consistent\nwith previous historical analyses (De Swaan, 1988) show-\ning that the privileged cared for the poor to some extent,\nnot because of altruistic reasons but out of self-defence.\nHowever, in contemporary societies, the risk that the rela-\ntively poor masses will overthrow the more privileged has\ncertainly been reduced. So we do not really know what\nmotivates the privileged to donate money to alleviate pov-\nerty. Furthermore, we found that subscribing to left-wing\nand post-materialist ideas is also positively related to\ndonating money to the poor. These political stances, how-\never, could not account for the relationships between\nreligiosity and economical situation, on the one hand, and\nthe willingness to donate money to the poor, on the other.\nWith regard to state-level characteristics, we found\nsignificant differences between the types of welfare states\nin relation to donating money, focusing on the average\ncitizen in terms of economic situation. However, the\nrank order did not match any of the two contradictory\nhypotheses on differences between welfare state regimes.\nWe found that liberal states, where the state is reluctant\nto fight poverty, produce the highest amount of solidar-\nity with the poor. Previously, Gelissen (2000) also found\nthat the liberal states produce the highest commitment\nto welfare state provisions, with all other regimes lagging\nbehind. Hence, we may conclude that these liberal states\nwith their lack of collective provisions regarding formal\nsolidarity produce informal substitutes for solidarity\nwith the poor. However, this does not hold for the Latin\nRim states, which are similarly reluctant to alleviate pov-\nerty. The latter states turned out to produce significantly\nless solidarity with the poor, actually similar to the\nextent to which social-democratic states produce solid-\narity. Conservative-corporatist states turned out to pro-\nduce even less solidarity with the poor. The latter finding\nmay be interpreted within the framework of Esping-\nAndersen's theory, if one emphasizes the predominant\nideology of familialism in this regime: familialism\nimplies solidarity with the inner family circle and,\napparently, does not necessarily imply solidarity with\npeople outside of this inner circle. Previously, we found\nevidence to support this part of the theory (Scheepers\net al., 2002). There we found that particularly the Latin\nRim regime produces solidarity with family and friends,\nclosely followed by the conservative-corporatist states,\nwhereas in other regimes social contacts were less wide-\nspread. These findings imply that in conservative-corpo-\nratist as well as Latin Rim states, where state policies\nhave not been developed for formal solidarity, social net-\nworks of family and friends remain the main structure for\ninformal solidarity. The finding that states with a high\nlevel of collective provisions, such as social-democratic\nstates, produce a similar low level of informal solidarity\nwith the poor as Latin Rim states may be considered\nodd. In states belonging to the Latin Rim with low levels\nof collective provisions, people tend to care for their\nfamily and friends and much less so for their fellow citi-\nzens in poverty, supposing they cannot help everyone. In\nstates belonging to the social-democratic type, people\nare reluctant to help their fellow citizens in poverty\nbecause they suppose that the state will take care of\nthem. Moreover, other evidence tells us that social con-\ntacts in social-democratic regimes are relatively scarce\ncompared to other regimes (Scheepers et al., 2002). This\njoint evidence supports theories stating that social pol-\nicies in social-democratic states aimed at formal solidar-\nity may have actually substituted or even oppressed\ninformal solidarity (e.g. W.R.R., 1999).\nOur second question related to differential effects of\nindividual characteristics across countries, i.e. welfare\nstate regimes. We found few, but quite interesting differ-\nential effects, related to the frequency of donating money\nto the poor. Highly educated people and people in sound\nliving conditions, particularly those living in liberal states,\nstand out in donating money to the poor. Apparently,\nprivileged people living in liberal states, where the state is\nreluctant to care for the poor, consider it an obligation to\nhelp them. In the face of poverty, these privileged people\nare likely to donate money to alleviate poverty, in the\nabsence of collective provisions. Middendorp (1978)\nshowed that there is quite some history to this kind of\nbehaviour, particularly in countries with liberal traditions.\nHe showed that, by the mid-nineteenth century, many\nliberals (as well as conservatives, for that matter) had\nbecome aware--predominantly through Marxist atten-\ntion for the disrupting effects of the industrialization pro-\ncess--of the inevitable poverty of many people who could\nnot free themselves from their situation. These liberals\ntherefore tried to soften these disrupting effects of indus-\ntrialization by lending support to the poor. Apparently,\nthis tradition has survived over the years. Vice versa, priv-\nileged people living in other regimes are quite similar in\ntheir willingness to donate money to the poor. This seems\nto imply that welfare arrangements outside of liberal\nstates do not affect their behaviour in this respect: privi-\nleged people donate more to poverty than less privileged\npeople, irrespective of the welfare state they live in. These\nfindings imply that, even for social-democratic regimes,\nthere is no evidence for communicating vessels between\nthe level of formal solidarity developed by state policies\nand the level of informal solidarity.\nNotes\n1. In the European Community Household Panel, it was\nfound that all over Europe particularly `one person'\nand `one parent' households run the risk of poverty,\nin addition to families with five or more persons\n(except for France and Denmark). Families depend-\ning on social security as their main financial source\nalso run a higher risk. In some European countries,\nsuch as Belgium, Spain and Italy, people depending\non their private company's profits run a higher risk of\nsuffering poverty. These families turned out to have\nless durable goods due to financial problems. Most of\nthese poor families, except the Danish, are more likely\nto live in houses that are too small, with dank walls\n2. To check whether important information was lost as\na result of this procedure, the original four-category\nvariable was used as a (quasi-) interval variable in a\nmultilevel linear regression analysis. The results\nwere very similar to those reported in Table 1. On\nrequest, the results of this additional analysis will be\nsent to interested parties.\n3. Income was standardized in each country separately,\nwith mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1.\n4. Variance between the four types of welfare state\nregimes is 0.052 (df = 3), the variance within all\nesis (both variances are equal) was rejected.\n5. In the Eurobarometer survey, church attendance\nwithin non-Christian denominations was not meas-\nured. To have a meaningful comparison, we tested\nwhether people belonging to non-Christian denom-\ninations differ from non-members who never attend\nchurch.\nReferences\nAndress, H. J. and Heien, Th.
