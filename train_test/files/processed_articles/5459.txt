In the context of dia-\nlogue, \"the group constructs and discloses deeper meaning,\nenriching understanding for all participants\" (Eeds & Wells,\nest in \"interdisciplinary and connected learning\" (Cox &\nRichlin, 1993, p. 3).

Rocca (2010), for\nexample, observes that discussion may promote learning in\npostsecondary classrooms by actively involving students in\nthe college learning experience. Hardman and Mroz (1999)\nconclude that discussion gives students a means to draw on\nthe knowledge and experience that they bring to their courses\ngiving them more responsibility for and control over their\nlearning. In general, many postsecondary educators view\ndiscussion as an alternative to lecture that is seen as encour-\naging passive acceptance of factual information rather than\ndeep engagement with ideas (Steen, Bader, & Kubrin, 1999;\nThe purpose of this article is to review the published\nresearch on the effects of discussion in college and university\nclassrooms with particular attention to research examining\nthe quality and quantity of discussion in postsecondary set-\ntings and its effect on student learning.\nI begin by describing the process by which I identified\nstudies for inclusion in this review.\nMethod\nTo locate relevant reports of research on discussion in col-\nlege and university classrooms, I did multiple searches of the\nEducation Resources Information Center (ERIC) database\nusing the following Descriptors:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Discussion (teaching technique) and Higher Education\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Discussion (teaching technique) and Postsecondary\nEducation\nThis search strategy identified articles in peer-reviewed\njournals that examined discussion in 2-year colleges and\nundergraduate and graduate settings including law and medi-\ncal schools. I augmented this ERIC search with a compre-\nhensive search of the tables of contents of major higher\neducation journals including the Journal on Excellence in\nCollege Teaching, College Teaching, Innovative Higher\nEducation, and the Journal of Higher Education. I also\nlocated relevant articles and book chapters by scanning the\nreference sections of each article I identified. From this pool\nof articles, I selected for review only journal articles and\nbook chapters that reported research on discussion in post-\nsecondary settings. I excluded from this review research\nstudies of online discussions. In all, I located 50 articles and\nbook chapters reporting research on discussion in postsec-\nondary settings (2-year and 4-year colleges, graduate classes,\nmedical and law school) including three previously con-\nducted reviews, two focusing more generally on research on\ncollege teaching (Birney & McKeachie, 1955; McKeachie,\n1990), and one focusing on participation in college and\nFindings\nAfter multiple readings of summaries of each of the 50 arti-\ncles included in this review, I identified the following themes\naround which this review is organized:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The effect of discussion on student learning\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The effect of discussion on student participation and\nengagement\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The quality of discussions in college classrooms\nI discuss each of these themes in turn below.\nThe Effect of Discussion on Student Learning\nI located 31 research studies that examined, directly or indi-\nrectly, the effect of discussion on student learning. The first\ngroup of studies reviewed below employed various means to\nassess directly the effects of discussion on student learning\nincluding the effect of discussion on student writing. A sec-\nond group of studies assessed student learning indirectly\nthrough the use of students' perceptions of the effect of dis-\ncussions on their learning.\nEffect of discussion on measures of student achievement.The\nmost potent argument for discussion in postsecondary class-\nrooms is its potential for boosting student achievement\n(Rocca, 2010) by engaging students in higher levels of learn-\ning (Wade, 1994). Indeed, there is some evidence supporting\nthe claim that discussion positively affects student learning\nin college classrooms. Harton, Richardson, Barreras, Rockl-\noff, and Latane (2002), for example, examined the impact of\nan approach to discussion called \"Focused Interactive Learn-\ning\" (FIL) on student achievement in five undergraduate\npsychology classes. While in class students responded in\nwriting to sets of multiple-choice and opinion questions and\nthen discussed their answers for 1 to 2 min with other stu-\ndents. Occasionally, this was followed by whole-class dis-\ncussions. These discussions were undertaken for every other\nchapter in the psychology textbook and, overall, students\nperformed better on end-of-chapter test items they had dis-\ncussed than on chapters they had not discussed.\nde Grave, Schmidt, and Boshuizen (2001) also reported a\npositive effect for discussion on student achievement. Forty-\neight first-year medical students were assigned to either an\nexperimental group that participated in a problem-based dis-\ncussion of blood pressure regulation prior to reading a chap-\nter on this topic or to a control group that participated in a\ndiscussion of a problem of vision before reading the chapter\non blood pressure regulation. Students in the blood pressure\nregulation group recalled 25% more information from the\ntext than control group students who had not discussed blood\npressure regulation.\nOther researchers have found similar effects for discus-\nsion. Christianson and Fisher (1999) reported that students\nenrolled in a discussion/laboratory biology class, compared\nDudley-Marling 3\nto students enrolled in large lecture/laboratory classes, devel-\noped a deeper understanding of osmosis and diffusion.\nSimilarly, Lyon and Lagowski (2008) found that students in\na general chemistry class who volunteered to participate in\nsmall discussion groups outperformed students who did not\nparticipate in these groups on course examinations and final\ngrades. Birney and McKeachie (1955) reported that students\ntaught by discussion generally achieved superior perfor-\nmance on measures of thinking, retention after the final\nexam, motivation, and attitude change.\nPositive effects for discussion go beyond exam scores and\ncourse grades. Josten (1996), for instance, examined the\neffect of discussion on the reading comprehension of\n80 \"developmental readers\" in a 2-year college setting. One\nweek before the final exam, some sections of the course used\ntraditional highlighting and recitation to address a text and\nthe other sections used an inquiry\u00adbased, decision-making\nprocess as a guide for student-led discussions of the same\nreading. At the end of these sessions, students were asked to\nwrite everything they could remember about the topic of the\nreading/discussion and respond to eight prompted recall\nquestions requiring various levels of thinking. Josten con-\ncluded that, although the combined scores for the discussion\nand control groups were not significantly different, the sec-\ntions of those instructors Josten deemed to have adequately\nprepared to lead the discussions performed significantly bet-\nter than the control group. This finding suggests that not just\nany sort of discussion will be effective, an issue addressed in\ngreater detail below.\nLevin (1995) reported that discussion was a \"crucial vari-\nable\" in in-service teachers' ability to learn from case stud-\nies. Experimental and control conditions each consisted of\n12 teachers subdivided into two groups of six teachers. All\ngroups read and wrote about a case and then read and wrote\nabout the same case a second time several weeks later.\nBetween these two events, the experimental group partici-\npated in a discussion of the case study. The second time they\nwrote about the cases, teachers in the discussion group, com-\npared to the teachers in the control group, elaborated on their\noriginal thinking, displaying changes in their understanding\nof the case study. Levin concluded that teachers in the con-\ntrol group failed to present any new ideas or insights after\ntheir second reading of the case.\nIn a related study of pre-service teachers, Copeland and\nDecker (1996) reported that students who discussed video\ncases in groups of three were somewhat more effective\nadopting, transforming, or creating new ways of making\nmeaning of the vignettes they worked with over one third of\nthe time. However, since there was no control group, it is not\nclear if other approaches to reviewing case studies would\nhave been equally effective. Bolt (1998) also reported an\nimprovement in physical education students' \"general pro-\npensity to identify problems and propose solutions\" (p. 96)\nwhen they participated in case study discussions.\nDiscussion has also been found to positively affect stu-\ndent writing. Hewett (2000) compared the influence of in-\nclass and online discussions on students' revision of their\nwriting. Hewett collected data from two sections of the same\ncourse, one a \"traditional oral classroom\" and the other a\n\"networked computer classroom.\" Discussion in both envi-\nronments focused primarily on students'writing although the\ndiscussion in each setting had different characteristics. Oral\ntalk, for instance, was more focused on abstract, global idea\ndevelopment, whereas discussion in the online environment\nfocused more on concrete writing issues and management.\nDespite these differences, students in both environments\nused ideas generated during discussions to revise their writ-\ning. No evidence was offered about the effectiveness of these\nrevisions, however.\nWhile the studies reviewed above support the efficacy of\ndiscussion in postsecondary classrooms, other researchers\nhave found discussion to be no more effective--and some-\ntimes less effective--than other pedagogical approaches.\nLiefeld and Herrmann (2002), for example, compared two\nsections of a consumer studies course. Both sections did the\nsame readings and both sections participated in class presen-\ntations and lectures, but one section spent 1 hr per week in\ndiscussions of class readings. The other section did not par-\nticipate in discussions but instead took and retook quizzes\nbased on course readings to the point of mastery. The\nresearchers created a 60-item test based on course readings\nfor pre- and post-tests. Students in both groups performed at\nsignificantly higher levels on the post-test; however, the\nmean score of the mastery-testing group was significantly\nhigher on the post-test than the mean score of the seminar-\ndiscussion group.\nGarside (1996) found that discussion was no more effec-\ntive at promoting student learning than lecture in six sections\nof an undergraduate interpersonal relations course. Half of\nthe sections were assigned to a lecture condition and half to\na discussion condition in which small groups of students\nresponded to questions provided by the instructor through\ndiscussion. The intervention was limited to a single class\nmeeting. Based on a test of course content, including ques-\ntions deemed to require high and low levels of critical think-\ning, the lecture condition produced significant learning from\npre-test to post-test with regard to the total score, lower-level\nitems, and higher-level items. Discussion produced more\nlearning from pre-test to post-test only with regard to higher-\nlevel items. Although both the discussion and lecture condi-\ntions produced gains in student learning from the pre-test to\npost-test, there were no significant differences in the post-\ntest scores of the two groups.\nStone (1997) also reported that discussion was no more or\nless effective than lecture for acquiring information pre-\nsented during a museum tour. Six intact college art education\nclasses were assigned randomly to one of the three condi-\ntions: a lecture condition, an inquiry/discussion tour, and a\n4 SAGE Open\ncontrol group. In both treatment conditions, students were\ngiven factual information, but in the discussion groups, stu-\ndents were encouraged to ask questions and make comments\nto which the guides responded to with remarks and/or que-\nries. The dependent measures included a multiple choice pre-\ntest and two post-tests, one given immediately after the tour\nand another 3 weeks later. Based on comparisons of the pre-\nand post-test conditions, Stone concluded that students in\nboth intervention groups did significantly better than the\ncontrol group in the post-test condition, but neither group did\nwell on retention as measured by the second post-test.\nBobby et al. (2012) compared the performance of stu-\ndents who were asked to reformulate multiple-choice ques-\ntions in a biochemistry module individually and in small\ndiscussion groups. Although students' gains from the indi-\nvidual task and the small-group discussions were substantial,\nthere was no advantage for either the individual or small-\ngroup discussion conditions, and this was true for various\ncategories of students (low achievers, medium achievers,\nhigh achievers).\nand Guetzkow, Kelly, and McKeachie (1954), also reported\nno advantage for discussion over other pedagogical\napproaches. Eglash (1954), for example, examined two sec-\ntions of a course taught by the same instructor, one organized\naround small and large discussion group, the other taught\nthrough lecture. No differences were found in the achieve-\nment of the two groups. Guetzkow et al. (1954) compared\nthe effect of three instructional approaches: drill-recitation,\ngroup discussion, and study tutorial. All students experi-\nenced a common lecture, used the same textbook, and were\ngiven the identical assignments. Teaching methods differed\nonly in weekly supplemental sections. There were no signifi-\ncant differences between the groups in terms of educational\nachievement.\nThe research on the efficacy of discussion in postsecond-\nary settings is decidedly mixed. However, the research\nreviewed above focuses mainly on student performance on\ntraditional quizzes and exams and, in this context, discussion\nmay be no more or less effective than other pedagogical\napproaches. Proponents of discussion argue that discussion\nhas the potential to engage students in higher levels of think-\ning and critical reflection (e.g., Auster & MacRone, 1994;\nviding fertile ground for collaborative meaning making\ntional assessments utilized in the studies reviewed above\nmay not be sensitive to these outcomes accounting for the\nmixed results.\nA few studies do suggest that discussion is an effective\nmeans for stimulating higher forms of student learning.\nHaroutunian-Gordon and Tartakoff (1996) routinely engaged\nstudents enrolled in a course on problem solving in mathe-\nmatics and music in an approach called \"interpretive discus-\nsion\" in which discussion focused on evidentiary-based\nclaims in response to open-ended questions. Haroutunian-\nGordon and Tartakoff's qualitative analysis of discussion\ntranscripts shows students engaged in high-level mathemati-\ncal thinking. No claim is made that discussion was the cause\nof this high-level thinking; the authors argue, however, that\ninterpretive discussion provided the context within which\nthis kind of thinking occurred.\nLehman and Scharer (1996) found that discussion affected\nthe quality of pre-service and in-service teachers' interpreta-\ntions of texts (as opposed to simple recall of textual informa-\ntion). Students were asked to read a piece of young adult\nfiction and record their responses to the text in writing as\nthey read. They were then asked to participate in whole-class\ndiscussions of the text. Following the discussion, both pre-\nservice and in-service teachers' (n = 129) text-based\nresponses to the text were judged by the researchers to be\n\"more analytical, inferential, and evaluative in relation to the\nliterary textual elements\" (p. 31).\nSelf, Baldwin, and Olivarez (1993) used a test of moral\nreasoning (arguably a form of higher-level thinking) to assess\nthe effectiveness of a film-discussion course for medical stu-\ndents designed to develop \"more humanistic, compassionate,\nand caring physicians\" (p. 383). The researchers reported\nsignificant differences in posttest scores between a group\nthat took the course for two semesters and a control group\nthat did not take the course but not between a group of stu-\ndents that took the course for only one semester and the con-\ntrol group. Unfortunately, because of the design of the study,\nthe only conclusion that can be drawn is that a course that\nincluded films and discussion taken for two semesters was\nbetter at improving medical students' performance on a test\nof moral reasoning than taking no course at all.\nLike research on the efficacy of discussion in general,\nresearch on the efficacy of discussion as a means of promot-\ning higher levels of thinking is mixed. Thyer, Jackson-White,\nSutphen, and Carrillo (1992) examined student performance\nin two graduate classes in social work. One class responded\nin writing to study questions based on the following week's\nreadings and then presented their answers in class. The other\nclass was taught through a structured teaching method called\n\"learning through discussion\" (p. 239) where each student\nwas responsible for presenting a summary of readings to the\nclass as a means of stimulating discussion. Based on student\nperformance on an \"essay-type\" test, the authors reported\nthat students in the study question group made significantly\nhigher gains on their scores for the critical analysis assign-\nment compared to the structured discussion group. Also, as\nsummarized above, Garside (1996) found discussion no\nmore (or less) effective than lecture in improving student\nperformance on test items deemed to require higher levels of\nthinking.\nStudent perceptions of classroom discussion in college class-\nrooms.A number of researchers have used student percep-\ntions as an indirect measure of the efficacy of discussion in\nDudley-Marling 5\npostsecondary classrooms. Windschitl (1999), for example,\npersuaded two science instructors to include brief, small-\ngroup discussions in their classes around questions that did\nnot have \"single discrete answers that could be recalled or\ngenerated quickly . . . but rather the questions would encour-\nage elaborated higher-order thinking\" (p. 23). Discussions\naverage approximately 5 min. At the end of the semester, stu-\ndents were asked to respond to several statements (e.g., \"the\nsmall group discussion questions helped my understanding\nof the lecture material\" [p. 25]) using a 5-point Likert-type\nscale. Students indicated that, while they felt that the discus-\nsions supported their learning, 5 min was insufficient for\nmeaningful discussion.\nWade (1994) used interviews and a questionnaire to\nexplore undergraduate education majors' beliefs and atti-\ntudes toward class discussion. Students indicated that they\nlearned from discussions but, again, many students believed\nthat not all professors provided sufficient time for in-depth\ndiscussions. Other researchers also report favorable response\nto discussions. Based on a 10-item survey and focus group\ninterviews, Randall (2009) reported that students in a course\non adolescence believed that literature circle discussions\nincreased their understanding of literature, in part by allow-\ning them to hear the perspectives of other students. Brazeau,\nHughes, and Prokai (1999) found that students in a first-year\npharmacy course generally liked small-group, case-based\ndiscussions and believed that these discussions supported\nlearning although they felt that 50 min was insufficient to\nachieve all the goals the instructor had set out for the discus-\nsions. Crabtree et al. (2001) reported that students in an\noccupational therapy course indicated that an approach\ncalled \"learning through discussion\" led them to think criti-\ncally about issues raised in the course. Crabtree et al. noted,\nhowever, that at least one of the students in the course was\nhighly critical of the \"learning through discussion\" process.\nJensen and Owen (2010), drawing on a data set that included\nstudents enrolled in introductory economics courses from\n34 universities, concluded that, overall, students preferred\nclasses with less lecture and more discussion and that classes\nwith more discussion were, from the students' perspective,\nmore likely to encourage them to take economics course-\nwork in the future. Other researchers have also reported that\nstudents indicated that in-class discussions made their\ncourses more interesting (Josten, 1996) and enhanced their\nThere is also some evidence, based on student percep-\ntions, that discussions may have a positive effect on students'\noral and written communication skills. Based on an end-of-\ncourse survey of second-term MBA students, Dallimore,\nHertenstein, and Platt (2008) concluded that the students felt\nthat participation in discussions improved their oral and writ-\nten communication skills while enhancing their learning\noverall and generally increasing their confidence.\nBased on focus group interviews with 43 sophomores and\njuniors Roehling, Vander Kooi, Dykema, Quisenberry, and\nVandlen (2011) identified three main reasons that students\nvalued discussions. From the students' perspective, discus-\nsions made learning more active, resulting in deeper under-\nstanding and promoting perspective taking. Not all students\nhave been entirely positive about discussion, however.\nEglash (1954), for example, found that students in a lecture-\nonly section of a course--compared to students in a discus-\nsion section--had more favorable attitudes toward the\ncourse. Although there were no differences in achievement\nbetween the two sections, Eglash reported unfavorable com-\nments from students in the discussion section including the\nassertion that the reliance on discussion amounted to an abdi-\ncation of instructor responsibility. Harton et al. (2002)\nreported that, while students were relatively positive about a\n\"focused interactive learning\" approach to discussion, they\nfelt that this approach had more of an effect on interpersonal\nrelations than their learning despite the evidence presented\nabove that students performed better on end-of-chapter test\nitems they had discussed than on chapters they had not dis-\ncussed. Faw (1949) also found that, while students indicated\na preference for \"student-centered\" discussions, two thirds of\nstudents who participated in these discussions expressed res-\nervations about the intellectual rigor of this approach despite\nthe finding that these students outperformed students\nassigned to non-discussion groups on course examinations.\nSummary and discussion. Overall, the research on the efficacy\nof discussion in college classrooms is mixed. Students gener-\nally perceive discussions as beneficial to their learning. The\nonly two studies reviewed here that reported negative per-\nceptions of discussions in postsecondary settings were con-\nducted over 50 years ago, at a time when students may have\nhad very different sensibilities about discussion. There is\nalso a body of research reviewed here indicating a positive\nimpact of discussion on academic achievement. However, a\nnumber of studies also found no advantage for discussion\ncompared to other pedagogical approaches. Some studies do\nshow that discussion positively affects higher levels of think-\ning and problem solving, but, again, the findings are contra-\ndictory. Still, the majority of studies (65%) examining the\neffects of discussion on measures of student learning reported\npositive effects. These proportions generally hold for studies\nof small- and large-group discussions (see Table 1 for a sum-\nmary of studies summarized in this section).\nThe research on discussion in postsecondary settings is\nfurther complicated by methodological problems that\nplague many of the studies reviewed here. Small sample\nsizes, unmatched comparison groups, measures of student\nlearning that lack any proven validity or reliability, lack of\ncontrol groups, and potential researcher biases undermine\nthe claims that are made about the effect of discussion on\nstudent achievement. Most serious of all, with the excep-\ntion of a few studies, researchers have been virtually silent\non what they mean by \"discussion\" (see Table 1) making it\ndifficult to make any sort of generalized claims about\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 1.

The use of various\nterms for discussion (e.g., \"reflective discussion,\" \"educa-\ntive dialogue,\" etc.) without defining these terms further\ncomplicates the meaning of discussion in the studies\nreviewed here. In general, it is difficult to make definitive\nclaims about the effects of discussion on student achieve-\nment because researchers have generally not been clear\nabout what they mean by discussion.\nDudley-Marling 7\nThe Effect of Discussion on Student Participation\nand Engagement\nBased on her review of the literature on participation in post-\nsecondary classrooms, Rocca (2010) concluded that higher\nlevels of student participation lead to improved learning out-\ncomes, increased student motivation, and engagement in\n\"higher levels of thinking, including interpretation, analysis,\nRocca argues that discussion is a powerful means for\nincreasing student participation and engagement and, ulti-\nmately, student learning; yet, only two of studies reviewed in\nthis section directly considered whether discussion led to\nincreased student participation. Francisco, Nicoll, and\nTrautmann (1998) examined the effect of four different\nteaching methods--cooperative learning, discussion, con-\ncept mapping, and lecture--in a chemistry course with\n94 students. Each type of teaching was integrated with lec-\ntures over the course of the semester. Students perceived\nhigher levels of participation during the discussion format.\nThe researchers offered no objective measure of \"participa-\ntion,\" however. Hardman and Mroz (1999) worked with four\ncollege instructors to implement \"recitation-breaking\" strat-\negies designed to facilitate interactive discussions. These\nteachers were able to create \"space in the [classroom] dis-\ncourse for the students to elaborate on their ideas\" (p. 290)\nthat, the researchers concluded, led to higher levels of stu-\ndent participation.\nDespite the arguments favoring discussion in postsecond-\nary classes, the available research indicates that discussion in\npostsecondary classrooms is fairly rare and, when faculty do\nprovide opportunities for discussion, relatively few students\ntend to participate. For example, based on surveys of eco-\ntime in economics courses was spent on lecture. Watts and\nBecker note, however, a slight movement over the years\ntoward what they referred to as \"instructor-student\" discus-\nsions. Discussions among students (\"Student-student\" dis-\ncussion) were much rarer. Similarly, Nunn (1996), based on\nobservations of 20 upper-level social science courses,\nreported that, on average, less than 1 min of class time was\ndevoted to any form of student talk, although there was con-\nsiderable variation across classes with 15 classes spending\nbetween 1% and 9% of instructional time on student talk and\ntwo classes spending between 20% and 23% of instructional\ntime on student talk. It is unclear how much of this talk quali-\nfied as discussion. Benzing and Christ (1997), in a survey of\nover 200 economics professors across the United States,\nfound that 14% of faculty indicated using class discussion\ntimes,\" and 5% \"never.\" Most of the respondents indicated\nthat they had begun incorporating more discussion into their\nclassrooms over the previous 5 years although, again, the\nmeaning of discussion is not clear. Jensen and Owen (2010),\nbased on their analysis of data from economics classes at 34\nuniversities, observed that postsecondary educators have\nbeen generally reluctant to abandon lecture in favor of more\ndiscussion. Opportunities to participate in class discussions\nmay differ across disciplines, however. Based on a linguistic\ncourses, Csomay (2005) concluded that students in Education\ncourses were most likely to be given opportunities to partici-\npate in discussions in their classes while Engineering stu-\ndents were least likely to have opportunities for discussion.\nEven when given the opportunity, many students still do\nnot participate in classroom discussions. Rocca (2010) cites\nan abundance of research indicating that relatively few stu-\ndents participate regularly in their courses even when offered\nthe opportunity, and many students do not participate at all.\nStudents may be more willing to participate in smaller classes\nthan large ones, however. This finding is supported by Nunn\n(1996) who, based on observations, field notes, and observa-\ntional checklists in 20 upper-level undergraduate courses,\ndetermined that only about one quarter of students partici-\npated in discussions. There was a wide range of participation\nacross the classes ranging from a class in which there was\n\"no participation\" to four classes in which participation in\ndiscussion ranged from 40% to 63% of the students.Asurvey\nof students in these same classes indicated that approxi-\nmately half of the students reported that they participated in\nclass discussions infrequently or never. Foster (1981), on the\nother hand, found high levels of participation among third-\nyear medical students in small, \"clinical discussion groups.\"\nOver the course of 62 small-group sessions, all but 4 of 119\nstudents participated in small-group discussion suggesting\nthat high-achieving medical students are willing to partici-\npate in class discussions.\nA number of researchers have attempted to identify factors\nthat account for students'reluctance to participate in class dis-\ncussions. Based on a survey and focus group interviews of\nconcluded that shyness and lack of preparation were the main\nreasons students chose not to participate in class discussions.\nOther research suggests that race and gender may also affect\nstudent participation in class discussions. Kaufmann (2010),\nfor example, found that whole class discussions in an ethnic\nstudies course tended to be dominated by White females\nwhile working-class students of color were likely to feel\nsilenced. In her review, Rocca (2010) found that females were\nless likely to engage in any form of class participation--\nincluding discussion--than males. Based on a survey of stu-\ndents for 51 courses at a private, Midwestern university,\nFassinger (1995) reported that males saw themselves as\nmore confident and more involved in class discussions while\nfemales saw themselves as more prepared for class, more\ninterested in the subject matter, and more interested in peers'\ncomments and questions than males. Wade's (1994) study of\neducation majors' attitudes toward discussion indicated that\nthree fourths of the men surveyed thought that their ideas\n8 SAGE Open\n\"always\" or \"often\" made an important contribution to dis-\ncussion, but less than half the women indicated similar confi-\ndence in the quality of their contributions.\nIn addition to race and gender, researchers have identified\nother factors that potentially influence students'participation\nin discussions, some of which suggest strategies for increas-\ning student participation including praising students (Nunn,\n1996); the quality of instructors' questions (Auster &\nwith open-ended or divergent questions being particularly\ntors to self-disclose (Goldstein & Benassi, 1994); instructors\nwho ask for elaboration of student questions/answers, accep-\ntance of student answers, using students' names, correcting\nwrong answers, and class size (Fischer & Grant, 1983;\n\"open\" (vs. authoritarian) styles (Townsend & Pace, 2005);\ngrading students' participation (Auster & MacRone, 1994;\ninstructors'use of humor (Reynolds & Nunn, 1998); interest-\ning topics and a general climate of respect (Fassinger, 1995;\nWade, 1994); and explicit efforts to improve students' confi-\ndence (Rocca, 2010). Instructors' skill at facilitating discus-\nsion has been found to affect both student participation and\nthe overall quality of discussion (Garside, 1996; Nunn,\nResearchers have reported that students are more likely to\nparticipate in small-group rather than whole-class discus-\nsions. Kaufmann (2010), in an ethnographic study of discus-\nsion in an ethnic studies course, reported that students who\nwere relatively quiet during whole-group discussions were\namong the dominant voices in small-group discussions.\nOther researchers reported higher levels of engagement and\nparticipation in small groups among students in a first-year\nphysics course (Hamann et al., 2012) and an upper-level\npolitical science course (Mayo, Sharma, & Muller, 2009).\nSmall-group discussions have also been found to encour-\nage higher levels of participation among working-class stu-\ndents of color (Kaufmann, 2010), Black men (Pollock,\nHamann, & Wilson, 2011), and ethnic and linguistic minori-\nties (Lee, 2001) who feel silenced during whole-class discus-\nsions. Lee, for example, found that six Korean-speaking\ngraduate students who rarely spoke during whole-class dis-\ncussions actively participated in small-group discussions.\nThe main reason the Korean students cited for their silence in\nlarge-group discussions was the belief that their language\nwas inadequate for these fast-moving discussions. Lee con-\ncluded that differences in sociocultural values and educa-\ntional practices, individual differences, and the classroom\ncontext also affected these students' participation in\ndiscussions.\nSummary and discussion. Rocca (2010) observed that student\nengagement is a crucial factor in student learning and that\nincreased participation in class activities, including discus-\nsions, will lead to higher levels of student engagement and\nlearning. Participation rates in postsecondary classrooms are\ngenerally low, however, with some groups (e.g., males,\nWhite females) even less likely to participate than others\n(e.g., female students of color). According to a limited num-\nber of studies, small groups as well as certain instructor\nbehaviors seem to foster increased student participation, but\nit is not clear whether higher levels of participation necessar-\nily result in heightened student engagement. Moreover, none\nof the research summarized in this section considered the\nquality of student participation or the degree to which par-\nticipation actually facilitates student learning. The definition\nof student participation may be \"somewhat elusive\" as Aus-\ntain that not all forms of student participation correlate with\nhigher levels of engagement and, ultimately, learning. The\nlevel of student learning will necessarily be a function of the\nactivities in which students are engaged. Engaging in discus-\nsions that require only low-level thinking, for example, will\nnot lead to higher-level learning. Moreover, students can be\nsilent and still be engaged in learning (Schultz, 2009). Ulti-\nmately, because of the failure of researchers to provide any\ndefinition of \"participation\" and its relation to student\nengagement and learning, these studies provide little insight\ninto the potential of discussions to enhance learning in post-\nsecondary settings. And, like the research literature on dis-\ncussion generally, researchers focused on the relationship\nbetween discussion and participation have been relatively\nsilent on the meaning of discussion, an issue that is discussed\nin greater detail in the following section.\nThe Quality of Discussion in College Classrooms\nThirty years ago, in a study of classroom discourse in 40\nclasses at four universities, Fischer and Grant (1983)\nobserved that most of the discourse in these classes, includ-\ning during periods described as \"discussion,\" occurred at the\nlowest cognitive levels, focusing on the transmission of\nknowledge and facts. Similarly, in a study of discussion in a\nthird-year medical course, Foster (1981) found that nearly\n75% of student talk during discussions was at the lowest cog-\nnitive level while only 2% was at the highest cognitive lev-\nels. More recently, in separate studies, Wedman, Smith, and\nmuch of what is taken for discussion in postsecondary class-\nrooms is nothing more than recitation.As Benzing and Christ\n(1997) observed, it may be that \"instructors believe that lec-\nture punctuated by instructor or student questions is a partici-\nDillon (1994) cautions that the mere presence of student\ntalk, no matter how frequent, does not automatically signal\nthat a discussion is taking place. According to Dillon, discus-\nsion is not just any sort of verbal interaction among partici-\npants but a \"unique form of group interaction, where people\nDudley-Marling 9\njoin together in addressing some question of common con-\ncern, something they need to understand, appreciate or\ndecide\" (Dillon, 1994, p. 5). Discussion is different from\nconversation and other forms of group talk by its \"concern\nwith the development of knowledge, understanding, or judg-\nment among those taking part\" (Brookfield & Preskill, 2005,\np. 17). In his widely cited text on discussion, Dillon argues\nthat discussion focuses on open-ended questions for which\nthere is more than one possible answer, a point emphasized\nby Haroutunian-Gordon (1991). Furthermore, in discussion,\n\"the talk concentrates upon one topic which is maintained,\nextended or developed\" (p. 13). Instructors facilitate these\ninteractions but do not dominate them nor do they insist upon\n\"correct\" answers that, from Dillon's perspective, are anath-\nema to true discussion. Dillon (1994) offers the following\nchart (Figure 1, which has been adapted here) to distinguish\ndiscussion as he defines it from recitation, a form of student\nparticipation that is often (mis)taken for discussion.\nAmong the studies in this review that examined, directly\nor indirectly, the effect of discussion on student learning, it is\ndifficult to ascertain how many are actually discussions as\ndefined by Dillon. It may be, however, as Hardman and Mroz\n(1999) suggest, that what counts for discussion in many (per-\nhaps most) of postsecondary classrooms is merely recitation\nas in the case of Guetzkow et al. (1954) who described discus-\nsion as a place \"where students feel free to expose their mis-\nconceptions so they can be corrected\" (p. 196). Studies\nemploying discussions restricted to very brief exchanges\ndents' opportunities to extend or develop topics also fail to\nmeet Dillon's criteria for discussion. Other studies offered\nevidence that at least some elements of discussion were pres-\nent (see Table 1 for a summary of research studies examining\nthe effectiveness of discussion). In both Brazeau et al. (1999)\nand Finkel (1999), for example, discussions began with ques-\ntions for which there were more than one possible answer.\nFour of the studies reviewed here include transcripts that sug-\ngest the rich, engaging discussions advocated by Dillon\n(1994). However, with the exception of these studies, few of\nthe studies included here offered the detail needed to ascertain\nwhat researchers counted as discussion. Of the 31 studies\nexamining the efficacy of discussion in postsecondary class-\nrooms, six studies provided at least some information on the\nresearchers'sense of the meaning of discussion. Only 7 of the\n31 studies offered any actual evidence that discussions\nincluded some of the elements discussed by Dillon. The\nnature of discussion in studies of class participation is even\nless clear. Only 3 of the 22 studies offered any sense for what\nWade, 1994), and only 1 of these 3 studies provided evidence\nthat the classroom interactions they described contained ele-\nments of discussions as defined by Dillon (Kaufmann, 2010).\nSummary and discussion.Dillon (1994) argues that not all\nverbal interactions that occur among students and teachers\nare discussions. Dillon does, however, offer a set of criteria\nthat, for him, distinguish discussions from other forms of\nclassroom interactions (e.g., recitation). Michaels et al.\n(2008) go further and argue that, even when discussions\noccur, not all forms of discussion lead to deep, engaged\nlearning. High-quality academically productive discussions,\nthey argue, are well planned, carefully orchestrated interac-\ntions that necessarily lead to collaborative meaning making.\nBecause researchers mostly fail to define what they mean by\ndiscussion and there is generally an absence of excerpts of\nclassroom discourse in studies of the effect of discussion on\nstudent learning, it is, with the exception of a few studies,\ndifficult to ascertain the quality of discussions--or even\nwhether discussions occurred at all--in the research studies\nsummarized here. It is noteworthy that five of the six studies\nthat provided some guidelines for what counts as discussion\nand six of the seven studies that provided evidence that the\ninteractions they described included at least some elements\nof discussion (as indicated by Dillon) reported positive\neffects for discussion on student learning (see Table 2).

Noticeable characteristics of talk in recitation and discussion.\ndiscussion on student learning and included at least some\nelements of discussion produced positive effects for\ndiscussion.\nDiscussion\nThe studies identified for this review examined the power of\ndiscussion to affect student learning as well as various fac-\ntors that influence student participation in class discussions.\nResearchers have examined small- and large-group discus-\nsions in a range of academic disciplines in public and pri-\nvate universities in various locales. But because of the\nfailure of most researchers to be clear about the meaning of\ndiscussion, no strong claims about the efficacy of discussion\nemerge from this literature review. In general, research on\nthe efficacy of discussion in postsecondary settings is incon-\nclusive because researchers are unclear about the definition\nof discussion that informs their research and rarely provide\nsufficient data to independently evaluate (using Dillon's cri-\nteria, for example) whether the verbal interactions in studies\nof discussion in postsecondary classrooms actually qualify\nas \"discussion.\" Studies that included evidence that interac-\ntions among students and instructors contained some of the\nelements of discussion as defined by Dillon (1994) were\nmore likely to produce positive effects for discussions (see\nTable 2). However, given the small number of studies that\nmet this criterion, this observation is suggestive at best.\nFor now, the strongest support for including discussions\nin postsecondary classroom comes from those few studies of\ndiscussion in postsecondary classrooms that are explicit\nabout the meaning of discussion and, indirectly, from\nresearch in K-12 settings. For example, based on their review\nof the literature on discussion in K-12 classrooms, Mercer\nand Howe (2012) conclude that \"there is now comprehensive\nevidence to support [the] view that talk amongst teachers and\nstudents, if of the right quality, can be a powerful motor for\nthe development of reasoning and the improvement of aca-\ndemic performance\" (p. 13). The degree to which research\non discussion in K-12 settings can be generalized to college\nand university settings is uncertain, however. Rocca (2010)\nargues that, because of the age of the students and issues of\nacademic freedom, the nature of discussions in postsecond-\nary classrooms may be qualitatively different from discus-\nsions in K-12 classrooms. Still, there is reason to hope that\ndiscussions that are \"of the right quality\" will positively\naffect student learning in both K-12 and postsecondary\nsettings.\nThere is also clear theoretical support for class discussion\nin postsecondary classrooms. From the perspective of socio-\ncultural theories of learning, human knowledge is fundamen-\ntally social in nature. Mercer and Howe (2012) observe that\n\"the relationship between social activity and individual\nthinking is vital . . . Knowledge is not just an individual pos-\nsession but also the creation and shared property of members\nof communities\" (p. 12). In this context, conceptual change\nis a key learning outcome (Morton, 2012), and, for this to\noccur, students need to be active participants in their learning\nby engaging in goal-directed conversations with others as a\nmeans of \"co-construct[ing] their knowledge through col-\nlaboration with their peers on meaningful activities\"\nDiscussion provides a potentially productive space for stu-\ndents and their teachers to \"co-construct their knowledge\"\nthrough dialogic interaction (Morton, 2012).\nResearch in K-12 settings, undergirded by sociocultural\nlearning theories that emphasize the social construction of\nknowledge (Gee, 2011), supports the use of discussion in\npostsecondary classrooms. What is missing, however, are\nstudies of discussion in college and university classrooms\nthat provide empirical evidence that students are actually\nengaging in discussion and use outcome measures--mea-\nsures of conceptual change, for example--that are sensitive\nTable 2.

Many of the studies sum-\nmarized above focus on outcome measures more sensitive to\ntransmission approaches to instruction like lecture.\nDespite the shortcomings of the research literature on dis-\ncussion in postsecondary settings, there are several implica-\ntions that emerge from this review.\nFirst, the effective use of discussion in postsecondary set-\ntings demands that faculty learn how to orchestrate discus-\nsions effectively which requires that they have a clear idea of\nwhat productive discussions look like to begin with (Garside,\nMroz (1999) found that, with support, postsecondary teach-\ners could learn \"recitation-breaking\" strategies that lead to\ninteractions that take on the characteristics of genuine dis-\ncussions as described by Dillon (1994). But, even where dis-\ncussions occur, not all discussions are equally productive.\nEffective discussions involve more than just student talk.\nAcademically productive discussions begin with clear goals\nand carefully planned questions for which there is more than\none possible answer (Haroutunian-Gordon, 1991; Michaels\net al., 2008). Productive discussions also require skillful\nmanagement by instructors as students work together to\nresolve some question, problem, or issue (Michaels et al.,\n2008). This requires deliberate effort to learn to plan for and\norchestrate discussions. Facilitating effective discussions is a\nskill that must be learned.\nSecond, given the evidence that students have had few\nopportunities to participate in authentic discussions even\nson to expect that all or even most students will come to\nclass knowing how to participate in productive discus-\nsions. Just as faculty will need to learn how to conduct\ndiscussions, students will need support to learn how to\nparticipate in this specific academic language practice\n(Gee, 2011). Therefore, instructors must offer students\nexplicit guidance on the purposes of discussions and how\nto participate effectively in them. There is also reason to\nbelieve that students may need to be persuaded of the ped-\nagogical value of discussion given the finding that at least\nsome students see discussions as ineffective, or worse, as\nan abdication of responsibility by faculty to \"teach\" (e.g.,\nProbably the strongest claim that can be made on the basis\nof this review is that researchers examining the efficacy of\ndiscussion in postsecondary classrooms need to be clearer\nabout the meaning of discussion in their research and whether\nwhat emerges in the classrooms they study really is discus-\nsion as opposed to other forms of classroom talk (e.g., recita-\ntion). Dillon (1994) provides a useful framework for this\npurpose.\nFinally, there is no research or theoretical framework indi-\ncating that discussion should completely replace other peda-\ngogical approaches (including lecture) in postsecondary\nsettings. The K-12 research indicates that for some pedagog-\nical goals--conceptual change, for example--discussion\nmay be a powerful teaching tool in the hands of skilled teach-\ners. Lecture, on the other hand, may be superior to discussion\nfor the immediate recall of factual information (McKeachie,\n1990). Instructors need to balance discussion with authorita-\ntive talk according to their pedagogical goals (Mercer &\nHowe, 2012). An overreliance on discussion may limit stu-\ndents'access to the expert knowledge needed for their devel-\nopment as scholars. On the other hand, the overuse of lecture\nand recitation in postsecondary classrooms restricts students'\nopportunities to engage in the critical thinking and problem\nsolving that characterizes the highest levels of scholarly\nachievement. As Brookfield and Preskill observe,\nDiscussion . . . teaches us dispositions and practices, provides us\nwith the opportunity to serve and connect with others, and tests\nour ability to confront the most difficult of problems and think\nthem through collaboratively. (p. 20)\nResearch on discussion that addresses the shortcomings\nof the extant body of research on discussion in postsecondary\nsettings will help to clarify the benefits of discussion for\npostsecondary students and help to determine the appropriate\nbalance between discussion and lecture. In the meantime,\nthere is sufficient support from sociocultural theory, research\nin K-12 settings, and limited research in postsecondary class-\nrooms for college and university faculty willing to include\ndiscussion in their teaching.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAuster, C.
