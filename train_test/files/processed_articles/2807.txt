People with mental illness have high rates of\nmorbidity and mortality from smoking related illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory\ndiseases and cancer. As many people who meet diagnostic criteria for mental disorders do not seek\ntreatment for these conditions, we sought to investigate the relationship between mental illness\nand smoking in recent population-wide surveys.\nMethods: Survey data from the US National Comorbidity Survey-Replication conducted in 2001\u00ad\nInterview Survey were used to investigate the relationship between current smoking, ICD-10\nmental disorders and non-specific psychological distress. Population weighted estimates of smoking\nrates by disorder, and mental disorder rates by smoking status were calculated.\nResults: In both the US and Australia, adults who met ICD-10 criteria for mental disorders in the\n12 months prior to the survey smoked at almost twice the rate of adults without mental disorders.\nWhile approximately 20% of the adult population had 12-month mental disorders, among adult\nsmokers approximately one-third had a 12-month mental disorder \u00ad 31.7% in the US (95% CI:\nmental disorders than male smokers, and younger smokers had considerably higher rates than\nolder smokers. The majority of mentally ill smokers were not in contact with mental health\nservices, but their rate of smoking was not different from that of mentally ill smokers who had\naccessed services for their mental health problem. Smokers with high levels of psychological\ndistress smoked a higher average number of cigarettes per day.\nConclusion: Mental illness is associated with both higher rates of smoking and higher levels of\nsmoking among smokers. Further, a significant proportion of smokers have mental illness.\nStrategies that address smoking in mental illness, and mental illness among smokers would seem to\nbe important directions for tobacco control. As the majority of smokers with mental illness are not\nin contact with mental health services for their condition, strategies to address mental illness\nshould be included as part of population health-based mental health and tobacco control efforts.\n\u00a9 2009 Lawrence et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nBackground\nSmoking remains one of the leading causes of preventable\ndisease and death both in Australia and the United States\n[1,2]. Efforts to reduce the prevalence of smoking con-\ntinue to be of public health significance. The association\nbetween smoking and mental illness has been known and\nstudied for many years, but the focus of much of the work\nin this field has been on people with severe mental illness,\nsuch as schizophrenia, or people being treated by psychi-\natric services [3-8]. For instance, a recent meta-analysis by\nde Leon and Diaz of 42 individual studies reported that\npeople with schizophrenia had odds of smoking 5.3 (95%\nCI: 4.9\u00ad5.7) times higher than the general population [9].\nGlassman et al reported an association between smoking\nand major depression from the St Louis Epidemiological\nCatchment Area Survey [10]. Lasser et al reported the first\nmajor population study in the US showing the substantial\nproportion of smokers who met DSM-III-R criteria for\nmental disorders, many of whom were not in contact with\nmental health services [11,12]. They reported that people\nwith DSM-III-R mental illnesses in the month prior to the\nsurvey had a smoking rate twice as high as people with no\nmental illness, and consumed an estimated 44% of ciga-\nrettes smoked by adults in the United States.\nThe excess mortality among people with mental illness\ndue to common conditions for which smoking is a known\nrisk factor, such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory dis-\nease and cancers, has been extensively described, from\nboth service-based and community-based samples, and\nthere is evidence of a growing disparity in mortality rates\nbetween those with and without mental illness [13-17].\nFor example, in Western Australia, cardiovascular mortal-\nity fell significantly in the general population between\nmental disorders [18]. One possible explanation for this\nphenomenon may be that the public health interventions\nthat have helped to reduce cardiovascular mortality in the\ngeneral community, such as the efforts that have reduced\nthe prevalence of smoking in both Australia and the US,\nmay have been less effective among people who have\nmental illness.\nIt has been hypothesised that one reason for the strong\nassociation between mental illness and current smoking is\nthat mental illness is a factor in smoking initiation.\nDepression and anxiety in teenagers have been found to\nbe strong predictors of smoking experimentation and the\ntransition to daily smoking [19-21]. However, smoking\nhas also been associated with the onset of psychiatric\nsymptoms in teenagers [21,22]. This has suggested that\nsmoking and depressive and/or anxiety symptoms may\nhave onset around the same time, possibly associated\nwith common prior causes [23-25]. However, controlling\nfor common causal factors does not completely remove\nthe predictive ability of smoking on mental illness, partic-\nularly depression and anxiety and vice versa. This suggests\nthe possibility that separate causal mechanisms may oper-\nate in both directions, in addition to the predictive ability\nThe large overlap between mental illness and smoking is\nnot entirely surprising considering the known effects of\nnicotine on the brain. Nicotine is a psychostimulant that\neffects several neuroregulators that influence behaviour\nand mood [29,30]. In some circumstances, nicotine can\nrelieve symptoms of both depression and anxiety [31,32].\nNicotine cessation can also precipitate depressive symp-\ntoms, particularly in people with a history of major\ndepression [33,34]. However, it has been questioned\nwhether these are independent depressive symptoms or\nunpleasant withdrawal symptoms [35,36]. The onset of\ndepressive symptoms following smoking cessation has\nbeen linked with lower quit rates, and most commonly\noccurs in people with depression [37-39]. These factors\nhave lead to the self-medication hypothesis \u00ad that smok-\ners with mental illness choose to smoke because it is the\neasiest, most readily accessible way to control symptoms\nof mental illness, especially for those who are not receiv-\ning any prescribed form of treatment for their mental\nhealth condition [40].\nWhile the self-medication theory implies there is a thera-\npeutic benefit to smoking which people with depressive\nor anxiety symptoms find helpful, research suggests that\nsmoking provides temporary relief from immediate symp-\ntoms, while overall creating a greater level of anxiety and\nstress [31,35,41]. Thus the alleviation of stress and anxiety\nby smoking may be part of the withdrawal feedback\nmechanism. It has been suggested that the self-medication\nhypothesis has too often been used as a justification for\nnot acting to curb cigarette smoking in this population\ndespite the fact that nicotine is not regarded as the most\nappropriate therapy for any mental health problem, and\nthat even if it were, cigarettes would not be an appropriate\nform of administering it [37].\nThe study of Lasser et al was based on data from the US\nNational Comorbidity Survey which was collected in\n1992. Smoking rates have been in decline in the US since\nthat time [42]. More current data are now available with\nthe release of the public use file from the US National\nComorbidity Study-Replication which was conducted\nian Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. We hypothe-\nsised that despite the decline in overall smoking rates in\nboth the US and Australia since 1992, people with mental\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nillness would continue to represent a disproportionally\nhigh number of smokers.\nWe used data from two recent nationally representative\nsurveys that employed the WHO Composite International\nDiagnostic Interview (CIDI) to estimate prevalence of\nmental health disorders among smokers\u00adthe National\nComorbidity Study-Replication in the US and the 2007\nAustralian Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. We\nalso examined data from the annual US National Health\nInterview Survey, which has used a short measure of psy-\nchological distress as a proxy of severe mental illness, to\nexamine whether it would be feasible to monitor the rela-\ntionship between mental illness and smoking as part of\nroutine surveillance systems.\nMethods\nData sources\nSurvey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (SMHWB)\nThe Australian SMHWB was conducted by the Australian\nBureau of Statistics (ABS) between August and December\ndwellings, drawn using a stratified multistage area-based\nsample design. The survey was conducted by personal\ninterview. The survey measured the prevalence of three\nmajor groups of disorders \u00ad anxiety disorders, affective\ndisorders and substance use disorders \u00ad using Version 3 of\nthe CIDI [44]. Full details of the survey methodology have\nbeen published elsewhere [45].\nNational Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS-R)\nThe US NCS-R was a nationally representative probability\nsample of 9,282 individuals conducted by means of per-\nsonal interviews by the Institute for Social Research at the\nUniversity of Michigan [46]. The survey measured the\nprevalence of most DSM-IV and ICD-10 mental disorders\nusing Version 3 of the CIDI. The NCS-R employed a strat-\nified multistage area-based sampling design. A long-form/\nshort-form approach was used with all 9,282 respondents\ncompleting part one of the questionnaire covering the\ncore CIDI disorders, while a sub-sample completed part\ntwo (n = 5,692), which covered risk factors, consequences,\nservice use and disorders of secondary importance or\nthose that were time-consuming to administer. Of the dis-\norders used in this study, all the affective disorders and all\nof the anxiety disorders except for post-traumatic stress\ndisorder were included in the part one questionnaire,\nwhile the substance use disorders and post-traumatic\nstress disorder have been estimated using the part two\nsample. Due to a problem with questionnaire sequencing\nthe diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder could not\nbe extracted from the NCS-R data. Full details of the sur-\nvey methodology and procedures have been published\nNational Health Interview Survey (NHIS)\nThe US NHIS is an annual survey conducted by means of\npersonal interview by the National Center for Health Sta-\ntistics [49]. The NHIS uses a multistage area-based proba-\nbility sampling design. The survey has three basic\ncomponents, the family component, the sample child and\nthe sample adult. The family component collects informa-\ntion on household composition, demographic character-\nistics and basic health indicators. For each selected family,\none child and one adult are selected to complete more\ndetailed questionnaires. For this study, data was taken\nfrom the 2007 sample adult component which includes\nmeasures of smoking status and level of psychological dis-\nAs the study consisted of analysis of publicly available\nconfidentialised files, no institutional ethics approval was\nrequired.\nMeasures\nMental illness\nMental disorders were assessed in the NCS-R and SMHWB\nusing Version 3 of the CIDI [44]. The CIDI is a fully struc-\ntured interview questionnaire which was administered in\nboth surveys by lay interviewers using computer assisted\ninterviewing software. The CIDI is designed to cover the\ndiagnostic criteria for mental disorders in both the Inter-\nnational Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-\n10), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\nincludes an initial screener for major symptoms of mental\ndisorders followed by detailed questions on each disor-\nder. The average interview time in the SMHWB was 90\nminutes with the majority of the time taken up by the\nadministration of the CIDI. For this paper we have used\nthe ICD-10 diagnoses rather than the DSM-IV diagnoses\nas results from the Australian SMHWB have only been\nreleased on the ICD-10 basis to date.\nIn the NHIS, specific mental disorders are not assessed.\nInstead the NHIS employs a short measure of non-specific\npsychological distress, the Kessler 6 scale [52,53]. This\nscale was specifically designed to be sensitive to the upper\n90th-99th percentile range of population distribution of\nmental disorders. Within this range it has high discrimina-\ntion.\nTobacco use\nIn the NCS-R, current smokers were identified from\nresponses to the question \"are you a current smoker, ex-\nsmoker, or have you never smoked?\" In the SMHWB,\nrespondents were asked \"do you currently smoke every\nday, at least weekly, less than weekly, or not at all?\" In the\nNHIS, the sample adult was asked \"do you now smoke\ncigarettes every day, some days or not at all?\" For consist-\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nency with the NCS-R, current smokers were taken as those\nwho smoked daily or less than daily.\nService use\nIn the SMHWB, respondents were given the definition\n\"The next few questions are about problems with your\nmental health. This includes but is not restricted to such\nthings as stress, anxiety, depression or dependence on\nalcohol or drugs.\" Respondents were then asked how\noften they accessed the following health services for prob-\nlems with their mental health in the 12 months prior to\nthe survey: general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist,\nmental health nurse or other professional providing spe-\ncialist mental health services, or other health professional\nincluding medical specialist, other professional providing\ngeneral services or complementary and alternative thera-\npist.\nWeighted estimates and standard errors\nSurvey weights were applied to calculate estimates of\ntotals and proportions. These weights have been calcu-\nlated to adjust for potential non-response. For the NCS-R,\nthe supplied weights had been normalised to sum to the\nsample size, whereas the weights supplied with the\nSMHWB sum to the population size. We re-weighted the\nNCS-R data by multiplying the normalised weights by a\nconstant factor so that the weights summed to the popu-\nlation size. This adjustment to the weights has no effect on\nestimates or standard errors for proportions. Standard\nerrors and confidence intervals for the NCS-R and the\nNHIS were calculated adjusting for the complex nature of\nthe sample design using expansion in Taylor series [54].\nStandard errors and confidence intervals for the SMHWB\nwere calculated using the jack-knife method of replicate\nModelling the relationship between smoking and\npsychological distress\nThe NHIS assessed the level of non-specific psychological\ndistress using the K6 scale, which generates a score\nbetween 0 and 24. We used logistic regression modelling\nto assess the relationship between psychological distress\nscore, and probability of being a smoker. As logistic\nregression models the log of the odds ratio, we did not\nenter the K6 score as a linear variable in the model as that\nwould imply an exponential relationship between K6\nscore and probability of smoking. With no theoretical\nbasis to assume a particular shape for the relationship, we\nused the generalised additive models (GAM) framework\nto fit a non-parametric spline curve to describe the rela-\ntionship [55]. Similarly we used GAMs when using regres-\nsion to model the average number of cigarettes smoked\nper day by level of psychological distress. All of the statis-\ntical analyses were undertaken using SAS software, Ver-\nResults\nMental illness and smoking in Australian adults\nthe adult population had a mental illness in the 12\nalence among adults with no mental illness (95% CI:\nsmokers in 2007, and people with mental illness repre-\npeople who have never smoked had a mental illness in the\n12 months prior to the survey.\nMental illness and smoking in non-institutionalised adults\nin the US\nBasing mental illness diagnosis on ICD-10, and using as\nsimilar as possible definitions of disorders as was applied\nin the Australian study, we estimated that 19.7% of the US\nadult civilian non-institutionalised population had a\nmental illness in the 12 months prior to the survey, con-\nthose adults with a mental illness, 40.1% were current\nble the 21.3% smoking prevalence in adults with no 12-\nwith mental illness represented 31.7% of current smokers\nan estimated total 51.0 million adult smokers in the US.\nIn contrast, only 15.1% of people who had never smoked\nhad a mental illness in the 12 months prior to the survey\nIn both the US and Australia, smoking rates were highest\namong those with substance use disorders, where around\ntwo-thirds of sufferers were current smokers (Tables 1 and\n2).

An individual may have\nmore than one disorder. As smoking rates were so high\namong those with alcohol or drug disorders, we investi-\ngated the extent to which comorbid substance use was\nassociated with the rates of smoking for people with anx-\niety and affective disorders. Table 4 presents the propor-\ntions of the Australian population in each age and sex\ncategory who have anxiety or affective disorders with and\nwithout comorbid substance use. The smoking rate within\neach group is also shown. Among those with comorbid\nsubstance use disorders, the smoking rate is consistently\nhigh across age and sex group, except for males aged 55\nyears and over. However, only a minority of those with\neither anxiety or affective disorders also have comorbid\nsubstance use disorders. Although confidence intervals\nare wide for some groups, smoking rates remain elevated\nin those without comorbid substance use disorders.\nComorbid substance use disorders were most common in\nyounger adults, particularly males.\nUse of services\nnot access any health services for their mental health\nproblems in the 12 months prior to the survey (64.0%,\nstantively different between those people with 12-month\nmental disorder who did or did not access services.

The 1992 US National Comor-\nbidity Survey found that 41% of adults with a mental ill-\nness in the past month were current smokers compared\nwith 22.5% of adults with no lifetime mental illness [11].\nHealth Survey reported 33% of adults with a mental dis-\norder were smokers compared with 21% of adults with no\nchiatric Comorbidity Survey found 47% of adults with\npsychiatric morbidity were smokers compared with 29%\nof those with no psychiatric morbidity [60,61].

As these smokers are\nlikely to have commenced smoking most recently, this\nsuggests the possibility that the proportion of smokers\nwho have a mental illness may rise as these cohorts age.\nPeople with substance use disorders have the highest rates\nof smoking, and those with anxiety and depressive disor-\nders who have a comorbid substance use disorder also\nhave very high smoking rates. Although this group repre-\nsents the minority of those with mental illness who\nsmoke, they present particular challenges for tobacco con-\ntrol. Especially among young people, smoking initiation\nneeds to be seen in the context of overall risk-taking\nbehaviour. If a reduction in smoking is offset by an\nincrease in the use of another substance, the benefit of\nsmoking reduction will be reduced.\nPeople with mental illness who are also smokers suffer\nfrom the negative health effects of smoking.

There\nis no doubt that the high rate of smoking among patients\nof mental health services contributes to the excess physical\nmorbidity and mortality consistently observed in these\npatients, and it is likely that smoking complicates or exac-\nerbates mental illness and its treatment. Efforts to reduce\nsmoking in patients of mental health services are clearly\nimportant. However, service-based smoking cessation\nprogrammes will be ineffective for the large proportion of\nsmokers with common mental disorders who are not in\ncontact with these services.\nApproaches to smoking cessation outside the clinical set-\nting have largely ignored the issue of mental illness. For\nexample, the 2000 US Surgeon General report on reduc-\ning tobacco use does not mention this group [68], while\nthe recent Australian National Preventative Health Task-\nforce report on tobacco control only mentions mental ill-\nness outside of mental health services to suggest that\npeople with common mental illnesses are as likely as any-\none else to benefit from general population-based smok-\ning cessation strategies [69]. The principal components of\npopulation health-based smoking cessation efforts, such\nas reducing availability, restricting all forms of promo-\ntion, increasing price, advertising health consequences\nand educating young people about them, and restricting\nuse in public places, have generally not been tailored for\npeople with mental illness, and may be less relevant or\nless effective for people dealing with mental illness. For\ninstance, increases in price may be less successful in moti-\nvating quit attempts in people with mental illness. Some\nof the heaviest smokers have the least ability to pay for\ntheir tobacco use [70]. The principle of increasing price to\nreduce smoking rates is predicated on smokers being\nrational agents able to maximise utility of available funds.\nMental disorders, particularly depression and anxiety dis-\norders can affect people's decision making. It is possible\nthat continuing to increase the price of cigarettes may\nhave a negative effect on mentally ill smokers, penalising\nboth them and their families [37]. Similarly, it has been\nsuggested that bans on smoking in public places may\nincrease the level of social isolation felt by people with\nmental illness who smoke [38]. Denormalising smoking\nmay be less influential on people who already feel mar-\nginalised from mainstream society for other reasons.\nWithout programmes that ensure people with mental ill-\nness have as much chance of successfully quitting smok-\ning as anyone else, the success of these types of public\npolicies may further the level of inequality between peo-\nple with and without mental illness.\nSimilarly, health promotional messages have concen-\ntrated on communicating the longer term negative health\nconsequences of smoking. While this knowledge has\nprompted some people to quit smoking and prevented\nothers from starting smoking, these messages may have\nless impact on people suffering mental illness or dealing\nwith stressful and difficult life circumstances. Mental ill-\nnesses such as depression or anxiety disorders are associ-\nated with increased risk-behaviour, possibly motivated by\nthe lower value placed on a long life by people whose\nability to focus on longer-term goals and consequences\ncan be affected by the pressures of more immediate and\nchallenging circumstances. There is little evidence in the\nliterature of attempts to develop smoking cessation mes-\nsages to target issues that are more relevant to people with\nmental illness.\nPopulation health-based smoking cessation promotional\nactivities have tended to focus on messages for the whole\npopulation or segmenting the population by demo-\ngraphic characteristics, such as age and sex. It has been\nsuggested that this focus may reflect the way surveillance\ndata are collected [73], but it is in contrast to the way that\ncigarettes historically have been marketed in the US and\nAustralia, and the way they continue to be marketed in\ncountries with less restrictions on cigarette marketing and\npromotion. Analysis of tobacco industry marketing\nresearch and market segmentation studies suggests the\ntobacco industry, in addition to developing products and\ncampaigns targeting youth or women, for example, also\ntargeted market segments defined by psychosocial charac-\nteristics, such as personality type. Products and campaigns\nwere developed to address concerns such as reducing anx-\niety, stress or nervousness, improving mood, increasing\nsocial confidence, reducing irritability, or increasing con-\nmotivations for taking up and for continuing smoking\nhave also commonly found that psychological factors are\nimportant. Coping with stress, and controlling emotions\nare two factors commonly extracted from these types of\nstudies [77-79]. Smokers are also more likely to deal with\nproblems themselves rather than seek help [77]. As these\npsychosocial factors cut across demographic groups,\ndemographically targeted smoking cessation campaigns\nmay miss opportunities to develop more effective targeted\nstrategies.\nTobacco control groups have tended to focus on treating\nsmoking as a single issue, arguing that not only are sub-\ngroups such as people with mental illness equally likely to\nbenefit from population-based access control and promo-\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ntion of long-term health consequences, but that develop-\ning targeted campaigns would weaken the effectiveness of\nthe overall campaign [80]. Few would argue with the gains\nthat the universal targeting of smoking cessation has\nmade in the past decades in achieving reductions in the\nprevalence of smoking. And yet, the evidence here also\nsuggests that substantial inequalities in benefit are accru-\ning in the sub-population of individuals with mental ill-\nness and that strategies in addition to universal\napproaches are needed to address these vulnerable popu-\nlations.\nThe universal approach may also miss the context in\nwhich young people initiate smoking or partake in some\nother risk-taking behaviour. A decline in smoking rates\nwould be less meaningful if it is achieved through young\npeople substituting some other harmful substance or\nbehaviour to cope with their difficulties. Perhaps when\npopulation health goals are formulated, such as the\nshould be considered, such as reducing smoking related\nharm without increasing harm through other risk behav-\niours. As mentally ill smokers may be more susceptible to\naddictions in general [82], focussing narrowly on the\nsmoking behaviour only without considering other risk\nbehaviours may compromise the overall goal of smoking\ncessation \u00ad improved health outcomes.\nMonitoring smoking in people with mental disorders in\nroutine surveillance systems\nThe CIDI, which was used for assessing mental health\nconditions in both the NCS-R and the SMHWB, is time\nconsuming to administer and impractical to incorporate\nin omnibus surveys of the type that are routinely used for\nmonitoring smoking rates. The K6 measure of non-spe-\ncific psychological distress has been included in the US\nhas more recently been incorporated into the US Behavio-\nral Risk Factor Surveillance System [83] and the Australian\nNational Health Survey [84]. Although it is far less com-\nprehensive than the CIDI, the strong association between\nsmoking rates and level of psychological distress suggest it\ncould be used to track progress in reducing smoking rates\namong the mentally ill. As the measure is already incorpo-\nrated in monitoring surveys, we hope that it can be incor-\nporated into routine surveillance of smoking rates. While\nsome collections have employed a binary categorisation\nof psychological distress, the significant gradient in smok-\ning rates and numbers of cigarettes consumed across low,\nmild, moderate, and severe levels of psychological distress\nsuggest at least four or five categories should be employed\nto adequately monitor this relationship. The K6 scale is\nmost closely correlated with anxiety and affective disor-\nders and less relevant to measuring impulse control or\nsubstance use disorders. Its use in routine surveillance\nshould be supplemented by other measures in these areas.\nCurrently there is no long-term time series on smoking\nrates in people with and without mental illness. Although\nthe NCS and the SMHWB have both been run twice, the\nchanges in instrumentation and the shift from ICD-9/\nDSM-III-R to ICD-10/DSM-IV limit the comparability of\nthese figures over time. It is hoped that the inclusion of\nshort mental health measures such as the K6 in routine\nhealth surveillance programmes will lead to the accumu-\nlation of time series data in this area.\nStudy limitations\nAll three surveys are based on self-report for both mental\nhealth status and smoking status. Diagnosis via the CIDI\ncorrelates well with diagnosis via structured clinical inter-\nview administered by a psychiatrist, but is not the same\nthing as a validated psychiatric interview. The NCS-R and\nSMHWB were both voluntary surveys, and response rates\nmay be an issue. It is possible that people with mental ill-\nness were under-represented in the surveys due to non-\nresponse problems. The surveys targeted the non-institu-\ntionalised population, and will thus not include the high\nrates of mental health problems within institutional set-\ntings such as hospitals, hostels, and prisons.\nConclusion\nData from two major population-based surveys of mental\nhealth, in the US and Australia, not only confirm the high\nrate of smoking among people with mental illness, but\nalso the significant proportion of smokers who have a\nmental illness. Data from the US NHIS also show that\npeople with higher levels of psychosocial stress on average\nconsume higher numbers of cigarettes.\nThere may be opportunities to further reduce smoking\nrates, reduce morbidity and mortality associated with\nmental illness, and reduce inequality in health outcomes,\nby specifically targeting some tobacco control efforts at\nthis population of smokers. While mental health services\nin developed countries have changed considerably in\nrecent years with moves towards more integrated models\nof care, it seems that providers of some physical health\nservices are more reluctant to see mental illness as an\nimportant part of their target group. Groups interested in\nreducing morbidity and mortality due to heart disease or\ncancer have traditionally been strong supporters of\ntobacco control. Despite the disproportionate rate of peo-\nple with mental illness in morbidity and mortality statis-\ntics for these conditions, addressing mental health\nconcerns has not been a high priority for these groups. On\nthe basis of figures reported in major national surveys it\nwould be expected that mental illness would be a key area\nof concern for groups interested in tobacco control.\nIt is possible that reducing the incidence of common men-\ntal health problems might also reduce the incidence of\nsmoking. Moreover, it is possible that helping people with\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ndepression and anxiety problems to find alternative ways\nof coping, and to understand the consequences of nico-\ntine withdrawal for their symptoms, may be helpful strat-\negies for reducing smoking rates. Teaching young people\nabout mental illness, skills for dealing with emotional dif-\nficulties, anxiety and stress, and about the relationship\nbetween mental illness, smoking and other risk behav-\niours in schools and other settings may also help reduce\nthe incidence of smoking. Population-based methods are\nrequired as the majority of smokers with mental illness\nare not in contact with mental health services.\nSome people with mental illness may find that quitting\nsmoking may not only improve their physical health, but\nimprove their mental health as well. Market segmentation\nstudies and the development of brands and campaigns for\ntailored market segments is a common tool of marketing,\nnot just in the tobacco industry. This type of approach\nmay yield gains in the efforts to combat smoking-related\nharm.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nDL and FM conceived the original idea for the study.
