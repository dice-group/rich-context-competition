The International Classification of Functioning,\nDisability, and Health (ICF) defines disability as the com-\nplex outcome between a person's health condition and envi-\nronmental factors, which include social, physical, and policy\nsupports (Schneidert, Hurst, Miller, & \u00dcst\u00fcn, 2003). This\nemphasis on the role of environment corresponds to the\nsocio-ecological perspective of Bronfenbrenner (1979), who\nviews human development as the evolving interaction\nbetween the person and environment (recited in Berry, 1995).\nThe socio-ecological perspective holds that successful out-\ncomes in human functioning may depend more on the match\nbetween individuals and their environments than on individ-\nual personal characteristics alone (Thompson, Tasse, &\nMcLaughlin, 2008). As such, a disability is heavily influ-\nenced not only by internal traits but also by the varied sup-\nports that enable an individual to function in the environment\n(Claes, Van Hove, Vandevelde, Loon, & Schalock, 2012).\nEnvironmental support in this context is defined as the over-\nriding \"resources and strategies that aim to promote the\ndevelopment, education, interests, and personal wellbeing of\na person and that enhance individual functioning\" (Luckasson\nvidual and the environment is a critical starting point which\nenables the individual to benefit from socio-ecological per-\nspective, because of the inability and limitation the individ-\nual has. The primary sources of these environmental supports\nare parents, siblings, and service providers of the individuals.\nAbery and Stancliffe (Stancliffe, 1997; Stancliffe & Abery,\nthe relationship between individual levels of self-determina-\ntion and residential environment occurring at the micro-sys-\ntem levels of the ecological perspective. The residential\nenvironment examined in those studies included staff\narrangement, residence size, number of residents, and resi-\ndence location. Another study by Wehmeyer and Bolding\n(2001) examined the effects that transitioning from institu-\ntionalization to community residences had on self-determi-\nnation in adults with severe intellectual disabilities. The\nresults of this study were consistent with those of the previ-\nous study by Stancliffe and Abery (1997). They found sig-\nnificant improvement in the areas of self-determination,\nautonomy, and choice-making in adults with severe intellec-\ntual disabilities after they moved from more restrictive resi-\ndential institutions to less restrictive community residences.\nStancliffe, Abery, Springborg, and Elkin (2000) also exam-\nined the effect of substitute decision-making (e.g., a legal\nguardianship or conservatorship) on the personal control of\nadults with intellectual disabilities at the macro-system level.\n1Chonbuk National University, Jeonju City, South Korea\nCorresponding Author:\nJaehyun Cho, PhD, Dept. of Education, Chonbuk National University,\nEmail: saehim1@gmail.com\nA Preliminary Validation Study of\nthe Korean Version of the Minnesota\nSelf-Determination Scales for Adults\nWith Intellectual Disabilities\nJaehyun Cho1\n Keywords\nspecial education, education, social sciences, intellectual and developmental disabilities, rehabilitation, self-determination,\nmeasurement\n2 SAGE Open\nThe results demonstrated that adults without any substitute\ndecision makers exercised significantly higher levels of per-\nsonal control than those with a conservator or a guardian.\nHowever, there was no assessment conducted to systemi-\ncally identify which facilitators and barriers existed, and\nexamined how they influenced the individuals with disabili-\nties either at the micro- or at the macro-system levels in\nProblems\nSince 2000, significant efforts have been made in South\nKorea toward the development of self-determination skills in\nindividuals with disabilities have. These efforts have included\ndevelopment of interventional programs (Bang, 2000;\ncomes related to an individual's self-determination level after\nself-determination measures should be used to develop,\nimplement, and evaluate the effect of self-determination\ninterventions on individuals with disabilities. Unfortunately,\nthe development of norm-referenced and standardized mea-\nsures of self-determination for individuals with disabilities\nwhich report acceptable psychometric properties has been\nvery limited in South Korea. Since 2000, three self-determi-\nnation measures have been translated into Korean (Cho,\n2009). However, only one of these measures included discus-\nsion of psychometric properties and contained a standardized\nsample that matched the recent South Korea census in terms\nof gender, age, family socio-economic status, and regional\nrepresentation (J. K. Kim, Cho, Moon, & Kim, 2001).\nThe second problem identified was the lack of self-deter-\nmination measures developed for adults in South Korea.\nMost measures privileged the evaluation of self-determina-\ntion of secondary students with intellectual disabilities, and\nfocused less on the importance of promoting and measuring\nself-determination in both young children and adults (Lee &\nWehmeyer, 2003). However, the ultimate goal of special\neducation in South Korea is to promote the full inclusion of\nstudents with disabilities (Korean Department of Education\n& Human Resources, 2003). Considering that self-determi-\nnation is a developmental process intended to increase\nautonomy over the course of one's life span (Abery &\nself-determination measure to account for the changes that\nadults undergo as they age.\nThe final problem pertained to the limited perspectives of\nexisting measures of self-determination of individuals with dis-\nabilities. There were no self-determination measures represent-\ning the socio-ecological perspective. Considering that the\nnature of disability can be understood as an intersection\nbetween a person's capacities and the context in which that per-\nson lives, it was valuable to explore the role of environmental\nsupports in improving the self-determination of individuals\nwith severe disabilities. Notably, the Korean version of the\nMinnesota Self-Determination Scale (K-MSDS) was the first\ninstrument designed to assess self-determination of Korean\nadults through the socio-ecological perspective.\nThe Purpose of the Study\nThe purpose of this study was to examine whether a trans-\nlated Korean version of the MSDS, the K-MSDS, might be\nvalid when applied to a Korean population. The original\nscales were invented to measure adults with developmental\ndisabilities (Abery, Stancliffe, Smith, Elkin, & Springborg,\n2000a). The measures were incorporated from the construct\nof an ecological model of self-determination (Abery &\nResearch Questions\nResearch Question 1: Does the K-MSDS yield adequate\ntest\u00adretest reliability correlations in an adult sample from\nthree Korean group homes and a residential institution at\ntwo different points in time?\nResearch Question 2: Does the K-MSDS yield accept-\nable internal consistency coefficients in an adult sample\nfrom three Korean group homes and a residential\ninstitution?\nResearch Question 3: To what extent is there correlation\nbetween the K-MSDS and the K-Arc's SDS (K-SDS) in\nconstructing self-determination?\nMethod\nParticipants and Setting\nParticipants included 40 adults with intellectual disabilities\nresiding in three group homes and one residential institution\nin an urban area of South Korea. The gender breakdown of\nage of participants was restricted to 19 or over, because the\nMSDS was originally developed for use with adults. Mean\nof the participants was Pacific Islander (Koreans). Of the\nparticipants, 28 were recruited from one residential institu-\ntion and 12 were recruited from three group homes the direc-\ntors of which agreed to participate in the study.\nParticipants lived in three different residential settings:\n(a) group homes, (b) pre-group homes, and (c) a residential\ninstitution. Twelve (n = 12) participants resided in three\ngroup homes that provided semi-independent living services\nin integrated community settings. Unmarried participants\nshared a room with two to three other residents. Married par-\nticipants lived with their own family members in the group\nhomes. Twelve (n = 12) participants lived in \"pre-group\nhome buildings\" located within the residential institution,\nbut segregated from the community. The \"pre-group home\nbuildings\" were created to prepare individuals for the transi-\ntion to living in an integrated community. Sixteen (n = 16)\nparticipants resided in one residential institution which pro-\nvided 24-hr supervised services. These individuals lived in\nfour-person rooms segregated from the community. Table 1\nprovides additional demographic information regarding the\nparticipants in this study.\nStructure of Self-Determination Construct\nWehmeyer, Kelchner, and Richards (1996) proposed a func-\ntional model of self-determination. They defined self-determi-\nnation as the attitudes and abilities of the individual to act as\nthe primary causal agent in his or her life. The primary causal\nagent was based on four functional characters of behavior:\n(a) autonomy, (b) self-regulation, (c) self-realization, and\n(d) psychological empowerment. Thus, the model developed\nby Wehmeyer et al. (1996) was called the functional model.\nThe measure assesses these four self-determination areas.\nAbery and Stancliffe (2003) proposed an ecological\nmodel of self-determination based on the work of\nBronfenbrenner (1979). They defined self-determination as\nthe degree of personal control which one wishes to exercise\nover those areas he or she considers important. They present\npersonal control as heavily influenced by the interaction\nbetween individuals and their environments. Thus, the role\nof environmental supports was emphasized in the ecological\nmodel. Abery and Stancliffe's (2003) measure assesses the\neight environmental support areas. Some examples of these\nsupports include home, leisure activities, friends, health, and\nMeasures\nThe Arc's Self-Determination Scale (SDS; Wehmeyer &\nKelchner, 1995) was developed to measure the self-determi-\nnation of both secondary students and adults. This measure\nwas comprised of two forms: an adult and an adolescent\nform, both of which share the same content. The adult form\nwas adapted from the adolescent form (Wehmeyer, 1996).\nThe internal consistency coefficient (Cronbach's ) was .90.\nTheKoreanversionofArc'sSelf-DeterminationAdolescent\nScale (K-SDS) was developed by Kim, Cho, Moon, and Kim\nwith and without disabilities. The internal consistency was .95\nin the Cronbach's  (J. K. Kim et al., 2001).\nConstruct validity was established through a confirmatory\nfactor analysis which identified the consistent factors between\nK-SDS (J. K. Kim et al., 2001) and the SDS measure\n(Wehmeyer & Kelchner, 1995). The psychometric properties\nof the measure were established by administering it to sec-\nondary students with intellectual disabilities. The internal\nconsistency (Cronbach's ) ranged between .92 and .95 across\nthe four Korean studies. The K-SDS was used for this study.\nThe MSDS (Abery et al., 2000a) were invented to measure\nself-determination of an adult in light of the effects of certain\nenvironmental factors. The MSDS consisted of three sub-\nscales. These subscales included (a) Exercise of Control,\n(b) Decision-Maker Preference, and (c) Importance of Control.\nEach subscale included 90 items, grouped into eight domains,\nwhich used a 3-point scale system to evaluate the levels of\nself-determination of the individual. Item questionnaires for\nthe three scales shared the same content, with variation occur-\nring only in initial statements, such as \"How much do you care\nabout . . .\" on the Important scale, \"Who decides . . .\" on the\nExercise Control scale, and \"Who do you want to decide . . .\"\non the Decision-Preference scale. The MSDS included both a\nself-reporting adult form and a proxy reporting residential\nTable 1.

The proxy forms\nwere used for this study (Abery et al., 2000a). The test\u00adretest\n(Pearson's r) ranged between .74 and .87. The internal consis-\ntency coefficient (Cronbach's ) ranged between .88 and .92\nfor the self-reporting scales (Elkin, 2007).\nProcedures\nThe investigator obtained two types of consents; a signed\nand an oral consent form. Signed consent forms were\nobtained from directors of the residential institution and\nthree group homes, and legal guardians of the participants\nwho did not have families and relatives. Oral consent forms\nwere obtained from participants (i.e., residents with intellec-\ntual disabilities). Written consent was waived for participants\nwho were not able to read the forms. The consent document\nwas communicated orally by a member of the research team.\nEach participant was informed that participation in the study\nwas voluntary and could be terminated at any time.\nTranslation and Back Translation\nThe translation\u00adback translation technique (also known as\nretranslation) was used to ensure equivalence on the scale\nbetween different cultures (Brislin, 1986; Brislin & Thorndike,\n1972). The investigator of this study, who was fluent in both\nKorean and English, translated the MSDS into Korean. The\nKorean version was then retranslated into English by a Korean\ndoctoral student majoring in English Literature at the graduate\nschool level, and fluent in both Korean and English. The two\nversions were compared by translation checkers--two other\ndoctoral students in English literature programs at the same\nschool--who were also fluent in both Korean and English.\nThese checkers were asked to rate how well the items on the\ntwo versions of the MSDS aligned to the following criteria:\n(a) linguistic likeness (e.g., word-to-word correspondence\nbetween English and Korean) and (b) content agreement (e.g.,\ndelivery of the meanings from English to Korean. The trans-\nlated-retranslated items were rated using a 5-point Likert-type\nscale (1-5 points). The items that received ratings equal or\ngreater than a point of 4 on both criteria were retained. Items\nthat received ratings equal to or lower than a point of 3 on both\ncriteria were discarded for later retranslations.\nProcedure\nFace validity of the second Korean version of the MSDS was\nrated by a Korean panel of three residential staff members\nwho served individuals with intellectual disabilities. Among\npanel participants, the mean number of years serving intel-\nticipants were certificated social workers.The panel members\nwere asked to rate how well the translated Korean items cor-\nresponded to institutional policies and practices in group\nhomes for adults with intellectual disabilities in South Korea.\nNine culturally inappropriate items were identified by the\npanel on the first translated version and replaced with modi-\nfied items applicable to Korean institutions serving individu-\nals with intellectual disabilities.\nChanges in the questionnaires were identically applied to\nthe three subscales, as they shared the same content. The con-\ntent replaced on the questionnaires was comprised of five\nitems pertaining to the Plans domain, two items from the\nSupport Money domain, and two items from the Support Staff\ndomain. For example, the phrase transition planning meeting\nin the Plans domain was replaced with \"a personal discussion\nwith peer or family member,\" as transition planning meetings\ndid not occur in South Korea. The phrase \"hiring or paying\nthe service staff\" in the Support Staff domain was replaced\nwith \"saving money for necessity\" and \"buying something for\nthe necessity\" in the K-MSDS, as individuals who resided in\nthe group homes and residential institution were not able to\nhire or pay the service staff in South Korea. Table 2 provides\nsample updated items recommended by the panel.\nBoth the first and second translated Korean versions were\npretested with five individuals with intellectual disabilities.\nThe individuals better understood questionnaires in the sec-\nond translated version. The second translated Korean version\nwas used for this study\nAdministrations\nInterviews were administered by six volunteers enrolled in an\nundergraduate special education program in South Korea.\nThe interviewers completed a one-day training workshop\n(6 hr) to acquire specific information regarding the protection\nof participants' privacy, practices and policies in the institu-\ntions, and procedures for administering the measures used in\nthe study. Each of the interviewers had an opportunity to prac-\ntice the interviewing process through role-playing various\ncase studies. In addition, the investigator of this study leaded\ntwo discussion sessions with interviewers to assess their com-\npetence regarding the process of data collecting activities. The\ndiscussion sessions each lasted for 2 hr and were first held\nimmediately after participants began to conduct interviews\nand, again, later on in the process of conducting interviews.\nResults\nTest-Retest and Internal Consistency\nTest\u00adretest reliability (Pearson's r) was computed between\nthe first and second administrations of the K-MSDS by the\nsame interviewers with the same respondents. The time\ninterval between the two administrations was approximately\n2 weeks (M = 14 days, SD = 2 days). Test\u00adretest reliability\ncoefficients were (r = .94) for the Preference, (r = .89) for the\nImportance and (r = .84) for the Personal Control Scales. All\nscale scores on the three scales were significant at the\np < .001 levels (two-tailed). Test\u00adretest reliability analyses\nwere also conducted for the domain scores. Test\u00adretest coef-\nficients were strong between domain scores with the excep-\ntion of two domains.\nThe internal consistency was analyzed for each of the\nPreference, Importance, and Personal Scales using\nCronbach's  (Cronbach, 1951). Each of these scales demon-\nstrated a strong internal consistency: Preference (.99),\nImportance (.99), and Personal control (.96) scales. The\ninternal consistency was also analyzed for the domains\nwithin the three scales. Test\u00adretest and internal consistency\ncorrelations of K-MSDS are presented in Table 3.\nConvergent Validity\nCriterion-related concurrent validity of the K-MSDS was\nexamined using K-SDS (Kim, Cho, Moon, & Kim, 2001) as a\ncriterion measure. Pearson correlations (Pearson's r) were\ncomputed between scores on the K-MSDS and on the K-SDS.\nThe K-MSDS and the K-SDS appear to assess similar con-\nstructs. Preference (r = .53), Importance (r = .52), and Personal\nControl (r = .51) Scales were correlated with the K-SDS.\nScores on the K-MSDS also significantly correlated with\nscores on the K-SMS, (Social Maturity Scale; S. Kim & Kim,\nPreference (r = .53), Importance (r = .52), and Personal Control\n(r = .53) scales were correlated with the K-SMS. Pearson's\ncorrelations between the K-MSDS and K-SDS are shown in\nTable 3. Also, correlations between K-SDS and K-MSDS\nincluding the subscales are presented in Tables 4 to 7.\nDiscussion\nOne of the aims of this study was to examine the reliability\nand validity of a Korean K-MSDS.

However, this study did not further explore the\npossible effects of environmental characteristics--residence\nsize and type, guardianship status of adults with intellectual\ndisabilities, and the characteristics of staff who serve in com-\nmunity-based settings--combined with MSDS, examined in\nprevious studies (Stancliffe, Abery, & Smith, 2000;\nStancliffe, Abery, Springborg, & Elkin, 2000). Also, because\nadults with intellectual disabilities do not retain any legal\nrights as independent decision makers in South Korea, we\nwere not able to examine the effects of possible substitute\ndecisions made by these adults, and, therefore, could not\nmake comparisons with previous studies.\nThe items on the MSDS were adapted from the Institute\nonCommunityIntegrationSelf-DeterminationOpportunities\nand Exercise Scale (ICI-SDOES; Abery, McGrew, & Smith,\ners, and staff who served children with disabilities were\ninvolved as members of an advisory panel during the devel-\nopment of the MSDS. In contrast, only the staff serving\nadults with intellectual disabilities participated as panel\nmembers of the K-MSDS. Thus, items on the K-MSDS were\nrestricted to reflect the opinions of the individuals with dis-\nabilities and their residential service providers. For a wider\napplication of the K-MSDS beyond individuals with intel-\nlectual disabilities who lived in community-segregated resi-\ndential settings, more stake-holders such as family, teachers,\nand service providers in community-inclusive settings are\nrecommended to participate as panel members.\nThe test\u00adretest coefficients ranged from .84 to .94 for\nthe K-MSDS scales. The test\u00adretest intervals (M = 14 days,\nSD = 2 days) were similar to those (M = 16 days, SD = 6\ndays) of the original study (Elkin, 2007). The test\u00adretest\nintervals administered to individuals with intellectual dis-\nabilities in two cross-cultural studies examined varied 1 to\n3 weeks (Gonzalez-Gordon, Salvador-Carulla, Romero,\nSo a 2-week interval for the study is acceptable. The\nK-MSDS showed higher test\u00adretest estimates than the\nMSDS data. These findings provided preliminary support\nfor the reliability of the K-MSDS applied to Korean indi-\nviduals. The test\u00adretest coefficients were particularly low\nfor the At Work domain, (r = .31). One possible explana-\ntion for this, is that participants did not have an opportu-\nnity to use employee's benefits--such as paid vacations, a\nday off, or task training for new employees--as most indi-\nviduals with intellectual disabilities were unemployed\n(81.6%; Employment Development of Korean Institute,\n2010). Individuals who had been employed were consid-\nered under-employed compared with those with non-\nintellectual disabilities or those without disabilities\n(Employment Development of Korean Institute, 2010).\nAnother explanation for this result relates to the difficul-\nties inherent in applying the concept of self-determination\nto different cultures. Asian cultures, such as those in Korea\nand Japan, emphasize family values and relationships\namong community members differently from Anglo-\nEuropean cultures that value individualism (Zhang, 2005).\nBecause of existing cultural norms, it could be difficult for\nindividuals to request a change in their scheduled lunch\ntime or to express preferences for certain types of work.\nThey may express hesitancy communicating their own\nopinions on first or second responding, as they fear break-\ning agency policy or losing better benefits by challenging\ncollective decisions.\nInternal consistency for the K-MSDS ranged from .96 to\n.99. These results were corroborated by the previous results\nfor the original MSDS administered by Elkin (2007), which\nranged from .88 to .92. These results indicated that K-MSDS\nwas an internally consistent measure across all the three\nscales. However, we did not conduct a study examining how\nwell the original MSDS scales were translated to other lan-\nguages and cultures. Thus, we could not compare the inter-\nnal consistency values of this study with those of other\nforeign language and culture-based translated versions of\nthe MSDS. An additional concern involved the use of the\ncoefficient--as the number of items increased, Cronbach's\nalpha tended to inflate (Netemeyer, Bearden, & Sharma,\nThe criterion-related validity of the K-MSDS was evalu-\nated by examining the relationship between the K-MSDS\nand K-SDS. The associations between the two measures\nwere moderate. The validity coefficients were .50, .50, and\n.51 for the three scales of the K-MSDS and the K-SDS.\nThese results provided preliminary support for the use of the\nmeasures with Korean individuals. These two measures of\nself-determination provided different theoretical perspec-\ntives; the K-MSDS relied on the ecological perspective\n(Abery & Stancliffe, 2003), whereas the K-SDS is based on\nthe functional perspective (Wehmeyer, 1996). Therefore, the\ncriterion-related concurrent validity was anticipated as\nrelated, but may not actually be as high because those scales\nmight measure the different self-determination characteris-\ntics of the same individual.\nScores on the K-MSDS (r = .51-.53) were also signifi-\ncant predictors of individuals'scores on the adaptive behav-\nior scale (K-SMS). These results validated the previous\nstudy by Abery, Rudrud, and Arndt (1995) indicating that\nadaptive behavior is closely related to self-determination in\nindividuals with intellectual disabilities (e.g., r = .86-. 89).\nWeller, Watteyne, and Herbert (1994) explained that adap-\ntive behavior and self-determination might share common\ncharacteristics, such as making choices without being\nforced, emphasizing individuals' interests, and modifying\nenvironments based on individual judgments and percep-\ntions of specific encounters. This study indicated that the\nK-MSDS was a valid and reliable self-determination mea-\nsure when applied to Korean adults with intellectual\ndisabilities.\n8 SAGE Open\nLimitation\nThis study used a convenient sample consisting of 40 adult\nindividuals who participated voluntarily. This sample was\nnot representative of all individuals with intellectual disabili-\nties in South Korea. Interpretation of results should be\nrestricted to this study as generalization to other populations\ncannot be made. Future studies to examine the technical ade-\nquacy of the K-MSDS should extend the sample size of par-\nticipants to individuals from a wider variety of age ranges,\nintellectual levels, and residential settings both community-\ninclusive and segregated.\nThe use of the K-SDS adolescent form as the criterion\nmeasure was a limitation of the study. There was no measure\nto assess self-determination of adults in South Korea. Even\nthough there was considerable similarity between the Arc's\nSDS, adolescent, and adult forms (Wehmeyer & Kelchner,\n1995), there was no Korean study to support the similarity\nbetween both adolescent and adult forms of the K-SDS.\nThe study requires the application of sophisticated statis-\ntical techniques to clarify which environmental variables\nexisted and how much they contributed to enhanced levels of\nindividuals' self-determination. Stancliffe, Abery, and Smith\n(2000) used path analysis to examine whether there was a\ndirect relationship between levels of self-determination and\nvarious expected environmental predictors. They found four\nprominent environmental predictors: self-determination\nskills, autonomy, individualization, and a discretionary use\nof money. Another study (Stancliffe, Abery, Springborg, &\nElkin, 2000) analyzed self-determination scores combined\nwith adaptive behavior skills and IQ tests to examine the\ninfluences of different substitute decision-making statuses\non individuals' levels of self-determination. This method\nwas effective for controlling the compound effects because\nadaptive behavior and IQ were identified as strongly related\nto levels of self-determination. These studies provided con-\nsistent support for the ecological perspective. Future studies\npropose that the results of this study will be more convincing\nwhen combined with the Environment Scale (Abery,\nStancliffe, Smith, Elkin, & Springborg, 2000b). The purpose\nof the Environment Scale is to identify the environmental\nfeatures in which an individual lives.\nScale brevity may be a concern (Netemeyer et al., 2003).\nThe study used relatively long interview protocols with indi-\nviduals with intellectual disabilities. The K-MSDS includes\n270 items and requires approximately 3 hr to be completed.\nParticipants became less enthusiastic in the interviews as\ntime progressed. It is suggested that low levels of participant\nenthusiasm influenced the results of the study. A shorter\ninterview period may increase the test\u00adretest reliability.\nImplications for Future Studies\nSelf-determination measures are used for developing, imple-\nmenting, and evaluating the effect of self-determination\ninterventions as stated by Shogren et al. (2008). There was\nno self-determination intervention program for adults with\ndisabilities in South Korea. Future studies should focus on\nthe development of intervention programs for enhancing\nself-determination in Korean adults. The data from the cur-\nrent study identify the needs of individuals who are placed in\nKorean group homes and residential institutions, and sug-\ngests the need for designing and implementing intervention\nprograms.\nAdditional studies should include the administration of\nthe K-MSDS combined with the Environment Scale (Abery,\nStancliffe, Smith, Elkin, & Springborg, 2000b). The\nEnvironment scale was developed for use in combination\nwith one of the MSDS. Its purpose is to identify environmen-\ntal features in which the individual lives. This scale was not\nincluded in this study. Use of the Environment scale will pro-\nvide individualized information pertaining to what environ-\nmental features enhance self-determination, which barriers\nexist, and how they influence the individuals with\ndisabilities.\nFuture studies will include the exploratory factor analysis,\ngiven the availability of a larger sample population. This\nmethodological approach will be more effective for detect-\ning factor structure and relationships among the factors\nwithin the theoretically based-measures (i.e., the K-MSDS,\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbery, B.
