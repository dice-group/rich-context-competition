In addition, the probability of a takeover contest is high. Frequently the\noriginal controlling will not be suited to drawing high non-cash benefits from the\nfailing firm.\n\u00b7 The expectation of a high premium leads to share prices in excess of expected cash\npayments even before the contest.\nThe private benefits going to the controlling shareholders are a large part of the total\nvalue of equity when the firm is distressed, but these returns are invisible. However, if a\ncontrol contest is expected, they will be reflected \u00ad fully or partly \u00ad in the price. There-\nfore, given dividend payout and later capital gains, the price appears too high.\nThe contribution of our paper is threefold. First, we give an efficient-market inter-\npretation of an important stock market anomaly. Second, by doing so, we link work on\nprivate benefits to the literature on the empirics of asset pricing. Third, we show that the\nfinancial structure and the probability of default may be important for determining the\nsize of private benefits of control. This topic has largely been treated in the context of\nagency costs of equity, with controlling shareholders or managers exploiting minority\nshareholders. We show that agency costs of debt also play a role and may become\noverwhelming when the firm is distressed. The mechanism described here creates a link\nbetween the financial position of a firm and real allocation that may amplify macroeco-\nnomic real or financial shocks.\nIn Section 2, we start by summarising the empirical evidence. The wreckers the-\nory of corporate distress is laid out in Section 3, after summarising other attempts to ex-\nplain the anomaly. Section 4 models the wrecking incentives by means of a simple\nagency model. The effect on market prices and its dependence on shareholder structure\nis analysed in Section 5 using an auction model. Section 6 develops the empirical im-\nplications and shows that the existing evidence corresponds well with the predictions of\nthe model. Section 7 gives an outlook and concludes.\n2 Challenging evidence ...\nThe underperformance of the stocks of distressed companies is an anomaly that\ncomes with a twist. Fama and French (1996) and others have explained the anomalous\nhigh returns of \"value stocks\" by conjecturing that such firms are often close to bank-\nruptcy: Their prices have been driven down by a string of bad news. And bankruptcy\nrisk is something that markets should rather dislike. For a number of reasons, losses due\nto default can be systematic, and the aggregate default rate is quite volatile. This argu-\nment amounts to the prediction of a positive 'default risk premium' in the returns of high\nrisk shares.\nDichev (1998) was the first to show that prediction does not bear out and that the\nperformance of high risk shares is actually very bad. Using Altman (1968) Z-score and\nOhlson (1980) O-score ratings, he groups a CRSP-Compustat matched sample covering\nthe years 1981 \u00ad 1991 into decile portfolios based on the magnitude of bankruptcy\nscore. Mean returns of high risk firms are compared with the average and with low risk\nfirms. For both indicators, the performance of the firms with the highest bankruptcy risk\nis clearly worst. A trading strategy that goes long in an equally weighted portfolio of\nfirms with a low bankruptcy risk and short in the firms with a high bankruptcy risk\nearns a monthly 1.17%, or 22.4% on an annual basis. The results are confirmed using\nregression tests.\nGriffin and Lemmon (2002) also find a negative relationship between financial\ndistress as proxied by Ohlson's (1980) O-score and subsequent returns, even after cor-\nrecting for the stochastic structure of returns by means of a Fama-French 3 factors\nmodel. In addition, they show that this relationship is driven by firms with a low book\nto market (BE/ME) ratio. The average return of low BE/ME firms in the highest quintile\nfor Ohlson's O-score is only 6.36%, about half of the average return in the other portfo-\nlios and slightly lower than the risk free rate over that period. In the subset of firms with\na high BE/ME ratio, the returns of distressed firms are not lower than would be ex-\npected by their BE/ME. In the quintile with the most distressed firms, the estimated\nreturn differential between high and low BE/ME firms is 14.44%. The results are robust\nto using the Altman (1968) Z-score indicator instead.\nSome contrary evidence is presented by Vassalou and Xing (2004) on the basis of\na distance-to-default-measure. For the smallest firms, as well as for the firms with the\nvery highest BE/ME ratio, the authors find a positive relationship between their measure\nof default risk, DLI, and the returns in the month after portfolio formation. Da and Gao\n(2005) repeat and interpret these estimations. They show that all the important results\ncan be traced to first-month reversals, mostly due to data problems with penny stocks,\nsuch as bid-ask bounces and illiquidity.\nTwo recent working papers complete the picture. Garlappi, Shu and Yan (2005)\nform six months cumulative returns from portfolios sorted according to default risk.\nUsing Standard and Poor's credit rating, they find an unconditional negative dependence\nof returns on default risk. Using instead the EDF measures generated by Moody's KMV\ndata, they find a negative relationship in the sub-sample of firms with a low BE/ME\nratio. This study is important because the authors use real world default risk indicators\nthat were sold to tens of thousands of market participants.\nCampbell, Hilscher and Szilagyi (2005) break new ground by constructing their\nown reduced form default risk indicator based on a logit model for bankruptcy and a\nbroader concept of company failure. Sorting firms into ten different portfolios according\nto their estimated default risk, they show that the distressed firms strongly underperform\nfinancially healthy firms. The difference is magnified if returns are corrected using a\nCAPM or a Fama-French three-factor model. The three-factor alpha of the highest per-\ncentile of the failure risk distribution corresponds to a return of almost -25% at an\nannual rate. For the highest 5%, it is still less than -15% annualised. The long-short\nportfolio that goes long the 10% of stocks with the lowest failure risk and short the 10%\nof stocks with the highest failure risk would earn a whopping annual 23%, almost ex-\nactly the same figure found by Dichev (1998). The study conditions on further variables\nand investigates the effect of momentum. These results and additional evidence will be\ndiscussed further in Section 6.\n3 ... in need of an explanation\nTo date, three explanations have been advanced for the negative excess premium\nfor the stocks of distressed firms. One possibility is, of course, that markets may be mal-\nfunctioning. Griffin and Lemmon (2002) speak of 'mispricing' and relate the size of the\ndifference to indicators of informational asymmetry. However, this leaves the sign of\nthe deviation unexplained \u00ad why should informational asymmetry lead to systematic\noverpricing? Campbell et al. (2005) advance two versions. On the one hand, markets\nmay be irrational. Specifically, financial institutions may have had a pronounced a pri-\nori dislike of distressed firms' shares that is not justified by their return characteristics.\nWith market shares of institutions going up, the shares of distress firms underper-\nformed. Second, markets may be inefficient. Their information set may not encompass\nthe default indicator constructed by the authors, although the authors were careful to\nmake sure that its components were available at the time and a rolling estimation proce-\ndure was used to eliminate the look-ahead bias. This latter argument does not explain\nwhy the effect is also found when using real world default indicators that could be used\nby anybody.3\nLivdan, Sapriza and Zhang (2005) have advanced a structural explanation, based\non risk. Financial constraints lead firms to reduce their investment. The reduction low-\ners their risk and hence their expected returns. This explanation has one principal short-\ncoming: it cannot explain why the returns of portfolios of distressed firms are low even\nafter correcting for risk using a CAPM or a Fama-French three factor model, and why\nthis correction worsens the anomaly.\nAnother explanation based on the risk of share returns is offered by Garlappi et al.\n(2005). In the event of a bankruptcy, equity holders, depending on their bargaining\npower, may have the opportunity to violate the absolute priority rule and obtain pay-\nments over and above what would be left of the assets after the creditors had fully been\npaid. This gives equity holders something that resembles an American option: by\ndeclaring bankruptcy, they can always exchange their claim on future returns for a fixed\nfraction of total assets now. An optimal threshold value of bankruptcy is determined. In\nthe neighbourhood of this threshold, the probability of default becomes very high, and\nthe risk is accordingly low, because in the state of bankruptcy, the return is certain by\nassumption. As the risk of distressed firms is lower, the equity beta and the returns in\nequilibrium are lower, too. This explanation has the same fundamental shortcoming as\nthe one by Livdan, Sapriza and Zhang (2005): the effect should not survive correction\nfor risk. Apart from that, it is not clear that the returns of equity holders in a bankruptcy\nprocedure according to Chapter 11 can really be assessed as being close to certain, even\nif some violation of the absolute priority rule is expected.\n3 As reported above, Garlappi et al (2005) use the EDF indicator by Moody's KMV and Standard and\nPoor's credit rating. Dichev (1998) and Griffin and Lemmon (2002) use the standard Altman Z-score\nand Ohlson O-score indicators with coefficients known from the literature.\nStill, in some important respects, the explanation resembles the one advanced in\nthe following. In both cases, it is the dependence of expected non-dividend benefits on\nthe probability of default that drives the results. But whereas the reasoning of Garlappi\net al. relies on second moments, our explanation is based on first moments.\nImagine a firm being hit by a series of negative shocks, making losses and ap-\nproaching a state of financial distress. With higher leverage, volatility increases and the\nexpected value of cash flows to shareholders goes down. But certain groups of well-\ninformed insiders can draw returns on their investment in ways other than by receiving\na cash dividend if they are in control of the firm.\nEquity is not only a right to receive dividends, it also confers control rights. These\ncontrol rights have an economic value of their own, as they enable owners to draw a\nreturn in kind. The benefits of corporate control comprise all non-dividend economic\nbenefits of ownership, by no means necessarily illegal ones. Although they do not show\nup in the books, the benefits of corporate control are economically equivalent to a divi-\ndend, and will be valued as such \u00ad not only by the ultimate beneficiary, but also by all\nother market participants who try to form rational price expectations.\nThe transfer of assets out of firms for the benefit of those who control them has\nbeen labelled \"tunneling\" by Johnson, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes and Shleifer (2000).\nThey use legal cases to establish that in developed countries, too, the diversion of cor-\nporate resources from the corporation to the controlling shareholder can be substantial,\nand that much of this diversion is legal. They number a variety of forms of diverting\nresources,\nincluding expropriation of corporate opportunities from a firm by its controlling shareholder, trans-\nfer pricing favoring the controlling shareholder, transfer of assets from a firm to its controlling\nshareholder at nonmarket prices, loan guarantees using the firms asset as collateral, and so on.4\nAkerlof and Romer (1993) give an extremely vivid account of \"bankruptcy for\nprofit\" during the 1980's, focussing on four historic events: the Chilean financial crisis,\nU.S. Savings and Loans regulatory changes, the Dallas/Fort Worth buildings boom and\nbust, and the US junk bond-financed takeover wave.\nOur hypothesis is that the benefits conferred by ownership of a private company\nwill form a disproportionately large part of the total payoff of distressed firms. This may\nbe termed the `wreckers theory' of financial distress. Firms close to bankruptcy will be\nstripped of their assets, as the opportunity costs of not doing so are high. The resulting\nreturns are a substantial part of the value of equity. For insiders with special uses for the\nfirms' resources, distressed firms are an easier prey than healthy firms. The causality\nalso goes the other way: Companies that are being depleted by insiders will very soon\nfind themselves in a situation of financial distress. Eventually, and maybe most impor-\ntantly, the process is self-reinforcing. With the conditional probability of bankruptcy\nincreasing, it seems less and less advantageous to the owners to leave valuable resources\nin the firm. Thus, well-intentioned owners can turn into wreckers quite against their\nown inclination. Wrecks and wreckers are correlated phenomena: one causes the other.\nOur argument rests on two pillars that need to be investigated more closely. First,\nwe need to show that the incentives to withdraw resources from the firm in the form of\nprivate benefits do indeed become stronger as the firms approaches bankruptcy. Section\n4 introduces a simple agency model of optimal management behaviour under the risk of\ndefault where management can choose between a strategy that maximises the overall\nfirm value and a technically inefficient strategy involving relocations of resources to\nequity holders. Debt contracts are incomplete, and no system of covenants can fully rule\nout this type of action. The inefficient strategy becomes optimal once leverage is high\nenough.\nThe second step is to reflect on the conditions under which the value of control\nbenefits will show up in the share prices of ailing firms. There is a broad literature ex-\nplaining the price difference between voting and non-voting stocks in terms of private\nbenefits of control and the expectation that the votes will become valuable in a contest\nbetween rivalling parties. In Section 5, we argue that the resulting premium will be\nlarge for a firm close to default, as the non-cash components of the return to equity are\nimportant and the probability of a contest for control is high. It is rather unlikely that the\noriginal management team, supported by some coalition of shareholders, is the most\nefficient wrecker. And even if they are, there will be other groups who think the same of\nthemselves.\n4 Financial distress and wrecking incentives\nGenerally speaking, the moral hazard problems caused by limited liability are well\nknown, notably the tendency to accept projects with a high risk, but a low expected re-\nturn as investigated by Jensen and Meckling (1976) and Stiglitz and Weiss (1981). For\noverviews see, for example, Grinblatt and Titman (2002), Ch. 16, or Freixas and Rochet\n(1997). The agency conflict described in this paper is close to the one investigated by\nInnes (1990), who shows how the incentive of an owner-entrepreneur to work hard are\ninfluenced by the terms of the debt contract. With respect to the specific problem of\nprivate benefits, however, the literature by and large has followed the seminal paper by\nJensen and Meckling (1976) in modelling the diversion of funds primarily within the\ncontext of an agency conflict between insiders and outside equity holders, not between\nequity holders and creditors.\nvalue of the assets must be larger than the value of all the payment obligations at each\npoint in time to keep the entrepreneur from diverting the returns. Johnson, Boone,\nBreach and Friedman (2000) show that managers with an equity stake have greater in-\ncentives to steal when the returns of capital drop. Their model does not recognise un-\ncertainty. Similarly, Akerlof and Romer (1993) show that the possibilityof a dividend\npayout larger than the true economic value of equity will induce the owners of the firm\nto extract a maximum amount of cash and let the firm go bankrupt. Without taking un-\ncertainty into account, they focus on the institutional preconditions for successful\n\"bankruptcy for profit\" to take place, calling the resulting activity \"looting\". We com-\nplement their analysis by focussing on the significance of leverage and the probability\nof default for the incentives to divert resources, in an agency conflict between equity\nholders and creditors, and directing attention to the private benefits of control.\nThe underlying conflict derives from the fact that when a firm is close to bank-\nruptcy, it is the creditors who are the true residual owners in many states of the world,\nbut the equity-holders maintain their residual control rights. In order to show first the\nincentives to relocate assets from the firm in case of financial distress, let us consider\nthe case of a selfless management that maximises the value of equity, as would be the\ncase with an owner-managed firm. At this point, we do not distinguish between classes\nof equity holders. We consider one period only, with two points in time: and\n. The management has the opportunity to take an unobservable action that yields\nbenefits to equity holders, thereby reducing the overall firm value. Taking the action\nwill reduce the firm value by the amount d (standing for \"damage\") and leads to private\nbenefits , with and\nt =\nt T\n=\n( )\nG d ( )\n< < for . That is, we assume that\nunlike dividend payments, the taking such private benefits is socially inefficient. For the\nsake of simplicity, we assume that there are only two possible values for d:\nd >\n{ }\nd  l . (1)\nThe firm value in t is a random variable with a distribution that depends on the\nmarket value of the firm's assets, A, and the managerial action:\nT\n=\n( )\nj\nV T A d\nj\n\n= - + . (2)\nHere, j is an index for the state of nature. The shock\nj\n follows a distribution function\n. To avoid asset stripping, there is a contractual ceiling to dividend payments, and\nwithout loss of generality we normalise it to zero. Choosing\n\nd = l is essentially an\ninefficient substitute for \"milking the property\" by means of high dividends. Unlike\ndividends, the action d and the implied loss of resources are invisible (or at least not\nverifiable), and cannot be contracted upon.\nThe firm value is the sum of the value ( )\nj\nS T of payments to shareholders and\npayouts ( )\nj\nB T to creditors:\n( ) ( ) ( )\nj j j\nCreditors' claims have face value F. Limited liability of shareholders means that\n( ) ( )\n{ }\nmin ,\nj j\n= T and ( ) ( )\n{ }\nj j\nThe probability of default is given by\n( )\n( ) ( ) ( )\nprob prob\nj j\nV T F A d F F A d\n\n< = - + < =  - + . (5)\nNote that the decision on d has consequences for the default probability. The objective\nfunction of the management is the present value of total benefits, cash and non-cash:\n( ) ( ) ( )\nW d G d S d\nWe will refer to ( )\nS d as the cash value of equity and to ( )\nG d as the non-cash benefit\nunder d. In order to simplify matters, we will assume that the non-cash benefit is cer-\ntain. The future cash payment in T, however, is uncertain. We assume that it is spanned\nby existing assets. If K is the number of possible states of nature at time T, then given\nthe absence of arbitrage opportunities there exists a stochastic discount factor,5 a vector\n\n++\n K\nR such that the cash value of equity is\n( ) ( ) ( )\n( )\n( ) (\nj\nj j j j\nj j\nK\nj j j\nj A F d\nS d S T V T F\nA F d A F d\n\n \n)\nj\n  \n= =\n= - - + >\n= = -\n= - - + = - - +\n \n  \nIn other words, the cash value of equity is a weighted sum over the residual value in the\nfuture, taken over those states where this residual is positive.\nIt is a rather straightforward matter to show that the incentive to take the non-cash\nbenefit becomes stronger as the firm's financial position deteriorates. The value of\nchoosing over is given by\nd =\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n = - = + -\nl l l . (8)\nRelocating assets from the firm is optimal if the benefit ( )\nG l is higher than the loss in\ncash value of equity induced by this decision, that is ( ) 0\n+  >\nl , with\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\nj j\nj j j\n \nj\n  \n- - + > - + >\n = - = - - + - - +\n \nl\nl l  . (9)\nIt is convenient to distinguish three cases, or sets of states:\n\u00b7 Case A (Default will not occur under either policy): { }\nj\nA j A F \n= - - + \nl .\n\u00b7 Case B (Default occurs under policy d = l, but not under policy ):\nd =\n{ }\nj j\nB j A F A F\n \n= - +  > - - +\nl .\n\u00b7 Case C (Default occurs under both policies): { }\nj\nC j A F \n= - + < .\nWe can then rewrite the cash value differential as\n( )\nj j\nj A j B\nj\nF\n  \n \n \n = - + - +\n \n \n \nThe owners bear the full cost of taking the non-cash benefit only in those states\nwhere the firm would have survived with and without the detrimental policy, that is, in\nthe states collected in case A. They still bear a fraction of the costs in those states where\nthe firm would have survived under 0,\nd = but has to declare bankruptcy under .\nIn those states, collected in case B, the costs to shareholders are strictly less than the\nsocial costs . And relocation is essentially a free lunch for shareholders in the states\ncollected in case C, when the firm will default on its debt even when playing the \"hon-\nest\" strategy . Then the full social costs of the relocation are borne by the credi-\ntors. Equation (10) allows us to see three important facts.\nd = l\nl\nd =\n1. The social cost of taking action d = l instead of 0\nd = is equal to the cost to the\nshareholders if the risk of default is absent, i.e. if ( )\nj\n for both strategies and\nin all states of nature.\n2. If there is a risk of default, the cost of taking action d = l for shareholders is strictly\nless than the social cost. This is a simple consequence of limited liability. In effect,\nthe creditors not only have to bear part of the economic risk embodied in the shock\nj\n , but also part of the costs of deviating from strategies that maximise firm value.\n3. The cost to shareholders of taking action d = l is increasing in the financial posi-\ntion, A F\n- .\nIn the states pertaining to case B, the costs increase one-to-one with A F\n- . Further-\nmore, for each state of nature there are two threshold values for A F\n- , marking the\nboundaries between the cases A, B and C. If the threshold\nj\nA F \n- = is surpassed, the\nstate switches from C to B. At a still higher value,\nj\nA F \n- = + l , state j passes the\nboundary between cases B and A. Increasing A F\n- therefore pushes more and more\nstates from category C, where the action essentially is a free lunch for shareholders, to\nB, where the shareholders bear part of the consequences; and from B to A, where the\nshareholders bear the full cost.\nThe incentive to relocate resources from the firm, S\n , is a continuous (though not\neverywhere differentiable) function of the financial position A F\n- . As long as not all\nstates of nature are in category A, the absolute value of S\n will be increasing in the\nfinancial position, A F\n- . It will be strictly increasing if at least one state of nature is in\nregime B.\nWe have assumed that the relocation decision is socially inefficient, ( )\nG <\nl l .\nThus, it will not be chosen when A F\n- is high enough for there to be no default risk.\nOn the other hand, d will certainly be chosen if default is guaranteed, i.e. if\n= l A F\n-\nis so low that default cannot be avoided.

Any sort of wasteful activity will happen if the\nfinancial situation is bad enough.\n( )\nG l l\nWe have shown that under financial distress there is a strong tendency to choose\nstrategies that are inefficient but confer a benefit on equity holders.\n5 A wrecking premium in the share prices\nThe incentives to divert company resources for private use drive a wedge between\nthe expected value of cash flows and the total value of equity. The difference between\nthe two is simply ( )\nG l . But we have yet to explain how the value of non-cash benefits\nwill show up in share price quotations. Typically, these quotations reflect trades of mar-\nginal investors, i.e. minority or outside shareholders, and in most cases these marginal\ninvestors will not benefit from the relocations.\nThere is a growing literature on the question of whether and how private benefits\nof control enter stock market valuations. In this literature, the focus is on the protection\nof minority shareholders from expropriation by the controlling team. Le Maux (2003)\ngives a recent overview. Empirically, two main routes have been taken. One strand of\nliterature, starting with Barclay and Holderness (1989), observes privately negotiated\ntransfers of controlling blocks and compares them with the stock market price prior to\nthis transfer. In order to make sure that the votes of shares traded on the stock market\nwill carry little or no value, periods with an elevated probability of a control contest are\nexcluded. The second method, pioneered by Lease, McConnel and Mikkelson (1983,\n1984), relies on comparing stock market prices when different classes of shares are\nquoted. If there are two classes of shares with identical cash flow rights, but one class\ncarries votes and the other does not, the price differential must be interpreted as the\nmarket price of votes and is indicative of private benefits.\nFor our purposes, it is important to understand the circumstances under which a\npositive price for votes will result. Ordinarily, transactions take place between non-con-\ntrolling parties who cannot expect to receive any control benefits themselves. The pri-\nvate benefits of control, which are essentially invisible, are translated into an easily ob-\nservable market price of a vote by the expectation that the vote will become valuable in\na contest for control. For share prices to rise above expected cash flows from dividends\nthere must be a positive probability of a contest, in the form of a proxy fight or a tender\noffer. In such a contest, when rival teams are bidding for votes in order to gain access to\nthe private benefits of control, the winner must outbid the maximum price that the rival\nparty is willing to pay. With private benefits involved, the price the winner is willing to\npay for minority shares will be higher than the subsequent cash flows. If shareholders\nattribute a positive probability to such a situation, a premium of share prices in excess\nof cash flows will show up even before the contest.6 The price run ups that occur before\ntender offers are well documented.\nThe price of a vote in a contest will depend on the distribution of shareholdings.\nAt the one extreme, it is easily seen that the price of votes is nil if one shareholder has a\ncontrolling majority of more than 50%, provided this is the relevant majority. For an\noutsider trying to gain control, a tender offer or a proxy fight would be useless. Instead,\nthe contender must deal directly with the majority owner, and if there are payments in\nexcess of the cash flow values, these would be made to the majority owner alone. On\n6 In order to make inferences on the size of private benefits, the method relying on differential voting\nrights needs additional assumptions regarding the probability of control contests. The first method, on\nthe other hand, suffers from a relative dearth of observations. A country-by-country comparison of the\nresults obtained by Dyck and Zingales (2004) and Nenova (2003), as well as the survey of Le Maux\nthe other hand, if we assume dispersed ownership, large parts of the private benefits will\nshow up in a takeover contest. In their study on managerial stock ownership, DeAngelo\nand DeAngelo (1985) find that the voting premium can become extremely high when\ncontrol of the firm is at stake. In order to tell the story as simply as possible we will\nIn a contest for control bidders reveal their preferences. There must be at least two\npotential competitors. We will assume that the non-verifiable benefits G are in fact pri-\nvate benefits to the controlling party alone. Let player i be the incumbent team in con-\ntrol of the firm and let r be the rival who challenges control. We assume that the contest\nfor control takes the form of a tender offer. and are the bids of the incumbent and\nthe rival, respectively. Here, following Zingales (1995), we will make two assumptions\nthat will be dropped later on.\ni\nP\nr\nP\n(a) All shareholders are \"small\", in that they do not expect their vote to be pivotal.\n(b) The offer must be unrestricted, i.e. the bid involves all of the companies' securities.\nShareholders will tender to the higher bidder, provided that the bid is at least as\nhigh as the value of cash flow under the winning team. The latter condition is the free-\nrider problem with takeover bids analysed by Grossman and Hart (1980). We want to\naddress it as the Grossman-Hart incentive compatibility constraint (ICC).\nThe value of the entire firm is equal to\ni\ni\n+ for the incumbent and to\nthe rival. Shareholders will tender to the rival unless the follow-up bid by the incumbent\nis higher. In order to win, the rival's bid must be equal to or higher than the highest bid\nthe incumbent can make without losing money:\nr\n+\nr\ni\nr i\nThe right-hand side is the break-even point for the incumbent. Furthermore, the\nbid must reach the value of the cash flow that would be created under the rival's own\nmanagement:\n(2004) demonstrates that the two methods of inference come to very similar conclusions. For us it is\nimportant simply to show that private benefits of control are reflected in share prices.\n7 Similar results could also be obtained from the closely related frameworks by Grossman and Hart\nr\n\nr\n)\ni\nV\n+\ni\ni\ni\nThus, the rival will make a winning bid of\n(\n* max ,\nr r i\nif it is profitable to do so. We will call a bidder \"superior\" if , and\n\"dominant\" if . The first inequality is sufficient for the bidder to make a\nwinning bid; the second inequality depicts the case in which, under the rival's policy,\nthe projected cash flow alone is higher than the entire value of equity under the incum-\nbent. We can distinguish three cases.\nr r i\n+  +\nr i\n +\na) The bidder is superior, but not dominant, i.e.\ni i r r i\n+ -  < + . In this case\nthe willing bid will be\n*\nr i\n= +\ni\ni\nr\ni\nThe winner pays a premium above the cash flow value of the shares as a result of the\ncontest for control. This premium is labelled \"surplus-extraction\" by Grossman and Hart\nb) The bidder is dominant, that is . The binding constraint for the optimal\nbid is given by the free-riding behaviour of shareholders:\nr i\n +\n*\nr\nc) The bidder is not superior, i.e.\nr r i\n+ < + . He will make no bid and control\nremains with the incumbent.8\nThus, we have seen that if a changeover of control takes place, the winning bid\nwill be at least as high as the entire value of equity (private and cash flow benefits) un-\nder the incumbent party. If there is more than two competitors, the relevant lower bound\nis the entire value of equity under the second best management team.\nr\n8 Note that this is a rather extreme assumption in the context of what we want to show. If there is no\ncertainty on the side of the rival as to the private benefits of the incumbent, the rival may choose to\nmake an offer that maximises the conditional expected payoff. If repeated counteroffers are possible,\nas in an English auction, the incumbent would be forced to make a bid of\nr\n+ , the value of the firm\nto the rival.\nNow, let  be the probability that a superior rival shows up, or more precisely: let\nthe rivals be drawn from a known distribution and let  be the probability that the rival\nis superior, ie:\nr r i\ni\n+  + . Furthermore, let be the expected tender bid condi-\ntional on the rival being superior, and the expected value of cash flow in this case.\nThen, the value of the shares, with risk neutral investors, will be\nr\nP\n%\nr\nV\n%\n( )\nr\n \n= + -\n%\ni\ni\nV\nV\nIf the investors are risk-averse, we can interpret  as the appropriate risk neutral\nprobability, given the true probabilities and the vector of state prices, see again Duffie\n(2001), Ch. 1. On the other hand, the value of expected cash flow is\n( )\nr\n \n= + -\nWe are interested in the conditions for the share price before the contest to be\nhigher than the value of expected cash flow, . This will be the case if and only\nif\nE\nP >\n > and . There must be a positive probability of a rival making a bid and\nthat this bid will exceed the value of cash flow the rival herself is going to generate.\nThat means that surplus extraction occurs, and the Grossman-Hart ICC must not bind.\nWe have seen that this will happen when the rival is superior, but not dominant.\nr\n>\n%\nr\n%\nIn the case of a financially distressed company it is extremely unlikely that the ri-\nval will dominate. A dominant rival is able to generate a cash flow to shareholders that\nis higher than the sum of private benefits and cash flows generated by the incumbent.\nWith a low or negative A F\n- , the expected cash flows to shareholders are small even\nwhen no relocation takes place, whereas the size of can be assumed to be a function\nof total assets, A, not of net worth.\ni\nG\nWe are in a position now to state why the premium paid in excess of expected\ncash flows will be high when the firm is financially distressed, relative to healthy firms:\na) The share of private benefits as a percentage of the overall value of equity is high\nwhen firms are distressed. In many cases, relocation policies may be the only way to\nextract any benefit at all from the firm. And it is these private benefits that make a\nsuperior rival bid higher than the expected cash flows. At the same time, the case of\na dominant rival \u00ad that may be quite frequent under normal circumstances \u00ad be-\ncomes extremely unlikely.\nb) The probability of a contest for control is high when the firm is distressed. It is\nunlikely that the controlling party that was installed in better times is the most effi-\ncient wrecker. In many cases, the efficient wrecker will be a close competitor, who\nis able to make good use of the material and immaterial assets of the firm, and to\nwhom the market position of the firm matters most. In other cases, a management\nbuy-out will result, with the management trying to make use of their superior\nknowledge with respect to the value of the firm's assets.9\nIn many cases, contestants will already possess large blocks of ownership, so-\ncalled toe-holds, which alters their strategic position in an important way. Furthermore,\nthey will not necessarily bid for the entire outstanding equity, but only for the quantity\nthey need in order to achieve control. This case is investigated in the Appendix, adapt-\ning a model by Rydqvist (1996). The principal conclusions reached above go through.\nHowever, a large part of outstanding equity will remain in the hands of minority share-\nholders under these circumstances, and the Grossman-Hart ICC becomes even easier to\nsurmount, as only half of the cash flow is relevant for bidders.\n6 Testing the hypothesis\nAssume that there is a contest for control with some probability . If it takes\nplace, the winner pays, for a fraction  of the shares, the value of the stream of expected\ndividends after takeover, [Dt\n], plus a wrecking premium  for the benefits of control:\n( )\nD \n\n\n \n\u00b5 \u00b5\n\n+\n=\n+\n+ +\nHere, \u00b5 is an asset specific one-period discount rate. The premium  may or may\nnot fully reflect the value of private benefits of control, depending on the distribution of\n9 Debtors themselves are also potential candidates. In order to rescue the economic value of their assets,\na subset of creditors may want to buy the firm themselves. Whether a premium results in this case de-\npends on whether these new majority shareholders are willing to generate private benefits, exploiting\nother creditors and minority shareholders. We assume that creditors are either credit constrained,\nunable to run the firm or prevented from taking it over by institutions like the Glass-Steagall Act.\npower between contestants.

The right-hand side shows the alpha\nthat will be measured in an asset valuation equation such as the CAPM or the Fama and\nFrench 3 factor model. It is equal to the expected premium that will be paid by contest-\nants as a share of the market value, taking into account the possibility that there may not\nbe such a contest, and corrected by an assessment of contest risk. Of course, it is not\nnecessary to assume agents to believe that the contest takes place either at the end of\nthis period or not at all. The left-hand side is the value of the possibility that a premium\nwill be paid at any time in the future.\nFor the wreckers theory to hold, it is enough that\nt\np\n  be an increasing func-\ntion of default probability. This means that for endangered firms the share of the ex-\npected takeover premium as a component of the overall value for marginal sharehold-\ners in (22) must be higher than for healthy firms. This is a rather mild requirement,\ngiven that in many cases distressed companies do not pay out any dividends at all. A\nviable way of estimating the value of the expected premium is\n\u00b7 to sort firms into portfolios according to their default risk, and calculate returns\n\u00b7 to estimate a CAPM or a factor model in order to generate the appropriate risk-ad-\njusted returns, and then\n\u00b7 to compare the alphas of portfolios with high and low default risk. If the portfolio\nwith the lowest default risk does not contain any takeover premium as a compensa-\ntion for private benefits, then the excess returns of the higher risk portfolios is a di-\nrect estimate of value of the expected wrecking premium. If this is not true, then the\nexcess returns give us the economic value of the differential takeover premium, in-\nduced by wrecking incentives.\nThus, the excess returns measured by Griffin and Lemmon (2002) and Campbell et al.\n(2005) may simply be a fair estimate of the discounted expected premium that candi-\ndates for takeover are willing to pay in exchange for being able to either actively deplete\nthe resources of their company, or use them in a way that is beneficial to their other\ninterests. We have seen that excess returns are a smoothly decreasing function of default\nrisk, as they should be according the wreckers theory. The results of Dichev (1998)\nspeak the same language, although returns were not adjusted for risk.\nOne might argue that given the hypothetical returns calculated for a strategy that\nshorts a portfolio of distressed stocks and is long in the shares of healthy companies, it\nwould be possible to generate return from a zero net investment with a very small risk.\nThis seems to be a direct implication of the negative excess returns. However, if an in-\nvestor goes short in a security, he has to pay the broker any income that would have\nbeen received on this security. The broker will transfer this income to the account of the\nclient from whom the security was borrowed. In the case of a tender offer, the premium\nof the tendered shares over the not tendered shares will be part of that income. Other-\nwise, if there is the expectation of a tender offer, the lender would not be willing to lend\nout his stock, or he would demand an appropriate lending fee.\nThe theory also accords well with the results for subsets of companies in the lit-\nerature. Given default risk, the wrecking premium should be higher for small firms, as it\nwill be easier to generate returns in kind using the control rights of equity if there is no\nmulti-layered management and a complicated set of corporate governance devices. And\nthis is the evidence that Campbell et al. (2005) brought up. For large firms, there is an\nannualised returns differential of 11.5% between low-risk firm and high-risk firms. For\nthe smallest size category, it is 17.5%.\nThe same authors show that distressed firms have low book-to-market ratios, like\ngrowth stocks, although they have the factor loadings of value stocks, since they load\npositively on the Fama-French value factor. These low book-to-market ratios are also\nnoted by Griffin and Lemmon (2002) and Dichev (1998). They may indicate the pres-\nence of a wrecking premium in the market value. Imagine that the book value gives a\ncorrect account of the liquidation value. If market prices are higher, equity holders as a\ngroup seem to expect additional benefits. But we expect a premium only for the stocks\nof those distressed companies where a takeover contest is expected. If this is impossible,\nbecause there already is a dominant owner, or if wrecking is impossible for other rea-\nsons, there should be no negative excess returns. Consistent with this, Griffin and\nLemmon (2002) show that the underperformance of distressed stock is highest when\nthey have the lowest book-to-market ratio. Garlappi et al. (2005) find that the negative\nrelationship between probability of default and returns is restricted to the firms with low\nBE/ME ratio. Campbell et al. (2005) also observe a maximum underperformance for\nlow BE/ME firms, although underperformance is also high in the subset of the firms\nwith the very highest BE/ME ratios.\nFinally, it is clear that the negative excess return should show a large degree of\npersistence, as depleting the company takes time and the expectation of a takeover con-\ntest will be upheld over a longer period in many cases. Again, Campbell et al. (2005)\nhave done the test for us. In addition to the CAPM alphas and the three-factor alphas,\nthey calculate alphas on the basis of the four-factor model proposed by Carhart (1997)\nwhich also includes a momentum factor. This momentum factor offers no explanation\nof return differentials in terms of risk, but it shows how much of the excessive return\ncan be attributed to the fact that they are persistent. It turns out that using the four-factor\nmodel including a momentum portfolio cuts the negative alphas of distressed stocks\nroughly in half, although there is little effect on the excess return of the portfolio formed\non the very highest percentile of default risk.\nSome further evidence comes from the literature on block sales premiums. As a\nmeasure of financial distress, Dyck and Zingales (2004) use a dummy variable that\ntakes a value of one if earnings per share were zero or negative in the year of a block\ntrade or before and obtain a weakly significant negative coefficient in their block-trade\nregression. However, past returns are not a valid measure of the incentives to deviate\nfunds. Barclay and Holderness (1989) show that the premium paid for the sale of large\nblocks is positively related to the financial leverage of the company and the amount of\ndisposable free cash, which both accord well with the wreckers theory.10\nThus, the theory is able to explain the existing evidence very well, without in-\nvoking irrational or inefficient behaviour.\nThe explanation advanced here focuses on the non-financial rewards of corporate\ncontrol. Johnson, Boone, Breach and Friedman (2000) have shown that measures of\ncorporate governance, particularly the protection of minority shareholders, explain the\nextent of losses during the Asian crisis. They conjecture that in countries with weak\n10 More precisely, the two variables are insignificant for the sample as a whole. They turn significant\nwhen the purchaser is an individual.\ncorporate governance, worse economic prospects result in more expropriation by man-\nagers and thus a larger fall in asset prices. Our short paper highlights an additional\nmechanism triggered by the high probability of default that can drive this relationship.\nThe inefficiencies created by wrecking behaviour may amplify real and financial\nshocks.\nThe probability of contests for control may also differ among industries. For ex-\nample, in growing industries the private benefits that can be realised by a competitor\nmay be larger than in a declining industry. The same is true of concentrated industries as\nopposed to competitive industries. Using a Herfindahl index, Garlappi et al. (2005) have\nfound evidence confirming this conjecture.\nWe want to point out a rather strong prediction with respect to the relationship\nbetween financial stature and excess returns. It may serve as a definite test of the hy-\npothesis advanced here. Our modelling exercise has shown that in order for a wreckers'\npremium to show up, there must be a positive probability of a contest of control, with at\nleast two parties competing for the private benefits, and the expectation that the winner\nwill have to pay a premium over the cash value. We have seen that such a contest is not\nto be expected if there is a controlling shareholder. Therefore, the negative excess pre-\nmium should not exist in a portfolio of distressed firms that have a majority owner.\nThese shares should trade at the value of their expected dividend or liquidation pay-\nments. With dispersed ownership, on the other hand, the existence of a premium can be\npredicted. It would therefore be interesting to investigate empirically whether financial\ndistress is associated by a change in control and whether there is evidence of overpric-\ning for distressed stocks with a majority owner.\nReferences\nAkerlof, George A. and Paul M.

This case was analysed by Rydqvist (1996),\nand we will adapt his model to the problem at hand.\nWe assume that the incumbent owns a fraction and the rival owns a fraction\nof the shares. The rest is held, as before, by atomistic shareholders. Incumbent and rival\nparties have private benefits and , and plan to generate cash flows and ,\nrespectively. No bargaining between the agents is allowed. In a contest, a fraction of 0.5\nis needed to secure control and reap the private benefits. Parties submit bids for what is\nmissing to reach the simple majority,\ni\ne\nr\ne\ni\nG\nr\nG\ni\nV\nr\nV\ni\ne\nr\ne\n- . Thus, the number of shares\nthe contestants buy may differ. Both initial holdings and are smaller than 0.5. Bids\nare unconditional \u00ad the contestants commit themselves to take all shares when less than\nthe required number of shares is tendered to them.\nr\ne\ni\ne\n11 Oversubscribed bids are pro rated.\nWe start by computing the contestants' break-even bid, which is the highest bid\nthey can make without losing money if they win. The incumbent faces an offer P per\nshare by the rival. If the incumbent makes a (infinitesimally higher) counter-offer and\nwins, the incumbent's payout will be\n(\ni i i\nG V e\n+ - - )P . (A1)\nwith the outstanding equity normalised to 1. If, instead, the incumbent tenders to\nthe rival, with a portion\nr\nf being accepted, the incumbent's payoff is\n( )\ni r r r\ne f P f V\n+ -\n\n \nAssuming that all shareholders other than the rival tender their shares, the portion\nr\nr\nr\ne\nf\ne\n-\n=\n-\nof the proffered shares will be accepted, and the rest returned. The break-even point is\nthe price for which the two options yield the same:\n( )\n( )\ni i i r\ni\ni r\nG V e f V\nP\ne f\n+ - -\n=\n- -\nCorrespondingly, the rival's break-even bid is\n( )\n( )\nr r r i\nr\nr i\nG V e f\nP\ne f\n+ - -\n=\n- -\ni\nV\nThe winning bid will be at least as large as the lower of the two break-even bids:\n11 This ensures that the shareholders tender to the contestant with the higher bid, even when they suspect\nthat he may not reach the majority, see Grossman and Hart (1988).\n[ ]\n* min ,\ni r\nThe winning bid may be higher than this lower bound for two reasons. One is the\nGrossman and Hart ICC: the winning bid must be at least as high as the cash flow gen-\nerated by the winner herself. It is only when the Grossman-Hart ICC is binding that\nthere will be no rent extraction and no wreckers' premium. The other is that the loser\nhas incentives to bid higher than his or her her break-even bid. Overbidding may force\nthe adversary to make a counter-offer, giving the loser the opportunity to trade in the\nshares at a higher price.12 If we assume perfect knowledge with respect to both agents'\nvaluation, the winning bid will have to be the higher of the two break-even bids,\n[ ]\n* max ,\ni r\n= P , (A7)\nif the Grossman-Hart ICC does not bind. The losing party would not let the win-\nner have it for less. The more generic case of a private valuation auction has been in-\nvestigated by Burkart (1995). He shows that an agent with a toehold will invariably bid\nin excess to her valuation. The winning bid may even be higher than [ ]\nmax ,\ni r\nP P in this\ncase. We assume that the agent with the higher valuation wins, as will be the case under\ncertainty. However, we do not want to exploit the overbidding feature fully, but rather\nsee (A6) as a lower bound for the outcome. Suppose first that the higher valuation is\nwith the rival. The condition for the Grossman-Hart ICC to be not binding at the lower\nbound, i.e. , is given by\ni\n>\nr\n)\ni\nV\ni\ni\n(\ni r\n> - . (A8)\nIf the condition holds, there will be rent extraction, as the bid is higher than\nthe subsequent cash flows .\n*\nP\nr\nV 13 An analogous condition holds for the case that the\nincumbent wins. We may now compare the results with the simple Zingales (1995)\ncase. Prior to the contest, there will be a wreckers' premium in the market price of\nshares if\n(1) market participants see a positive probability of a contest taking place and\n(2) condition (A8) for rent extraction is fulfilled.\nThe probability in (1) is extremely high in our current modelling context, as it\npays for the rival to put up even a losing fight as soon as . Such a fight gives the\nrival the possibility of selling a part of her shares to the incumbent at a premium. Re-\ngarding the second point, condition (A8) is very similar in structure to the correspond-\ning condition for the Zingales (1995) case, but it is milder, as only half the\ntotal cash flow of the firm is relevant for the two bidders. Thus, if none of the competi-\ntors is dominant, condition (A8) will be fulfilled a forteriori, and there will be rent ex-\ntraction in a contest and a premium in the share prices.\nr\n>\ni r\n> -\n12 Rydqvist (1996) assumes that there will be no overbidding. We do not need to make this assumption.\n13 If the condition does not hold, the relevant lower bound is . Note that (A8) is merely a sufficient\ncondition for rent extraction to take place, as overbidding may result in higher winning bids.\nr\nV\n14 It has to be noted, though, that this does not mean that the premium will be necessarily higher than in\nthe Zingales (1995) case. The winning bid may be lower if the winner needs to buy only a few shares.\nThe dependence of the premium on the ownership structure is investigated further in Rydqvist (1996).\nThe following Discussion Papers have been published since 2004:\nSeries 1: Economic Studies\n1 2004 Foreign Bank Entry into Emerging Economies:\nAn Empirical Assessment of the Determinants\nand Risks Predicated on German FDI Data Torsten Wezel\n2 2004 Does Co-Financing by Multilateral Development\nBanks Increase \"Risky\" Direct Investment in\nEmerging Markets? \u00ad\nEvidence for German Banking FDI Torsten Wezel\n3 2004 Policy Instrument Choice and Non-Coordinated Giovanni Lombardo\nMonetary Policy in Interdependent Economies Alan Sutherland\nin an Asymmetric Currency Area Giovanni Lombardo\n5 2004 FDI versus cross-border financial services: Claudia M.
