We find that foregoing medical care is common among low-income, privately insured families, occurring at a greater\nrate than those with higher incomes or Medicare coverage. To better understand the relationship between out-of-pocket\n(OOP) spending and access, we used the 2011-2014 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data and a logistic model\nto analyze the likelihood of avoiding or delaying needed medical care based on health insurance design and other individual\nand family characteristics. We find that avoiding or delaying medical care is strongly correlated with coverage under a high-\ndeductible health plan, and with depression, poor perceived health, or poverty. However, it is relatively independent of\nthe percent of income spent on OOP costs, making the percent of income spent on OOP costs by itself a poor measure\nof health care unaffordability. Individuals who spend a small percentage of their income on health care costs may still be\nextremely burdened by their health plan when financial concerns prevent access to health care. This work emphasizes the\nimportance of insurance design as a predictor of access and the need to expand the definition of financial barriers to care\nbeyond expenditures, particularly for the low-income, privately insured population.\n",

While most notable for the resulting\ndrop in uninsured rates across the country, primarily driven by\nthe state Medicaid expansions and employer and individual\nmandates, the law also established regulations requiring stricter\nstandards for a minimum acceptable level of coverage.1,2 These\nstandards include guaranteed issue (preventing insurers from\nexcluding those with preexisting conditions), the elimination of\nlifetime spending caps, limits on annual deductibles, limits on\nannual out-of-pocket (OOP) spending, and requirements that\nplans cover services considered essential to an individual's\nhealth. These standards are aimed at reducing underinsurance, a\nsituation where an individual's coverage either leaves them lia-\nble for an unsustainable amount of medical OOP expenses or\nresults in the inability to receive necessary care.3\nDespite the ACA regulations and guaranteed level of\ncoverage, for many low-income individuals in the non-\ngroup, individual market and employees covered with\nemployer-sponsored insurance, their plan leaves them\nunderinsured. This is especially true for those offered high-\ndeductible health plans (HDHPs), which under the law in\nindividual and $13 200 for a family. While often paired\nwith health savings accounts (HSAs), a high-deductible\nplan for a low-income individual places a potentially sig-\nnificant burden for medical expenses before the deductible\nis reached as many of these individuals are unable to fund\ntheir HSA.4 Furthermore, while these plans are subject to\nthe OOP maximums established by the law, services not\nclassified as essential health benefits and services provided\nout-of-network may not count toward the annual cap, fur-\nther exposing an individual to higher expenses.\n1Altarum Institute, Ann Arbor, MI, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nEdward S. Kielb, Strategic Research and Initiatives Group, Altarum\nEmail: EdwardSKielb@Gmail.com\nThe use of HDHPs has increased substantially over the\npast 10 years, carrying with it several major concerns for\nlow-income enrollees.5 First, that these individuals will be\nforced to spend a large percentage of their income on health\ncare expenses. Thresholds of 10% or 20% of total income\nhave been identified as levels of concern for combined\nspending on premiums and OOP medical expenses. Previous\nwork has shown that families making less than 200% of the\nFederal Poverty Level (FPL) are far more likely to have a\nhealth care financial burden--the percent of income spent on\npremiums and OOP costs--above these thresholds.6,7,8,9 In\naddition, it has been shown that these risks are even more\npronounced in the pool of low-income individuals with\nHDHPs, who have almost twice the risk of health care expen-\nditures exceeding 20% of income than those with a plan\nwithout such high deductibles.10,11 Furthermore, recent\nresearch has analyzed the impact of HDHPs on medical\nexpenditures. HDHPs appear to cause reduced spending on\noutpatient care and pharmaceuticals, though no judgment has\nbeen yet been made on how such plan changes impact low-\nA potential complementary concern for the underinsured\nis that they avoid receiving necessary medical care alto-\ngether, such as dental care, filling prescriptions, or critical\nmedical procedures.15 Previous work that has looked solely\nat health care financial burden as a percent of income effec-\ntively censors those with the inability to spend on health\ncare, and thus does not capture this concern. A low-income\nindividual who spends 0% of their income on health care\nmay nevertheless be extremely burdened by their underin-\nsurance if they completely avoided care due to the potential\nOOP costs. Moreover, financial burden as a measure of\nunderinsurance is problematic because the OOP caps under\nACA make it mathematically impossible for some middle-\nincome families to reach the 10% or 20% of income thresh-\nold, despite the possibility they may be significantly impacted\nby their medical expenses.16 Previous work modeling\navoided or delayed care only in families with children dem-\nonstrated that in such families, a measure of these concerns\nis a better predictor of unmet needs than raw OOP costs.17\nIt is important to note that the concept of underinsurance\nincludes components beyond the economic concerns of avoid-\ning care due to cost and percentage of income spent on health\ncare expenses mentioned above. Previous work has also identi-\nfied underinsurance can occur as a result of plans not covering\nparticular services or providers (structural underinsurance) or\nfrom an individual's perception of the quality of a health plan\nand its coverage (attitudinal underinsurance).18 Qualitative\nunderinsurance measures to assess these concerns using access\nto care questions have been previously demonstrated in an\nanalysis of the impacts of theACAon people's access to health\ncare.19 Furthermore, using the 2007 HealthTracking Household\nSurvey, it was demonstrated that almost 20 percent of US\nadults faced some manner of unaffordability barrier to medical\ncare.20 It has also been found that lower income persons are\nmore likely to experience nonfinancial barriers and less likely\nto use health care than their higher income counterparts.21\nIn this article, we focus primarily on economic and attitu-\ndinal factors of underinsurance. To measure the attitudinal\nfactor of underinsurance, we defined an unaffordability met-\nric to identify individuals who avoid or delay medical care as\na result of cost. We then compare this metric with a health\ncare financial burden indicator--percent of family income\nspent on health care--measuring economic factors of under-\ninsurance. Finally, focusing on the privately insured popula-\ntion, we develop a logistic model to predict the impact of\nfinancial barriers, plan type, and health characteristics on\nunaffordability concerns for this population.\nStudy Data and Methods\nWe analyzed the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)\nusing SAS version 9.4. The MEPS population is a subset of\nthe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) respondents\nand is designed to provide nationally representative spending\nestimates of per-capita medical procedures. The most recent\navailable data is from 2014. It was collected from March to\nEach individual is reported as part of a larger family with a\ncorresponding characteristic weight determined by demo-\ngraphic and financial factors, thus allowing us to collapse the\ndata to the household level. We used the Current Population\nSurvey (CPS) family weights; the differences with MEPS-\ndefined weights are small, but the CPS definition is broader.22\nFor example, using the CPS definition, college students away\nfrom home count as members of their family's household.\nOutcome Variables\nOur central data definition concerns unaffordability. We\ndefined it as a dichotomous variable on a household level\nusing a series of access to care questions. A family is defined\nas having an unaffordability concern if any member of that\nfamily reported either delay or loss of medical care, prescrip-\ntion medication, or dental care for financial reasons. We\nassume that family members typically pool resources used\nfor medical care and that therefore unaffordability concern\nfor any member of the family extends to others within that\nfamily. This accords with recent publications using unafford-\nability as a measure of financial barriers.16,17,18 Exact MEPS\nquestions used to compute the unaffordability metric are\nfound in Online Appendix A.\nA second key variable is health care financial burden,\nwhich estimates financial barriers facing families. We defined\nhealth care financial burden as the proportion of total OOP\nmedical expenditures divided by total income for each family.\nPrevious work that quantifies health care financial burden\nusing MEPS data sometimes includes individual contributions\nto premiums in addition to OOP expenditures for the privately\ninsured population.7 Our measure of health care financial\nKielb et al 3\nburden in this article only includes OOP expenditures for 2\nreasons. First, because we model unaffordability, which\nfocuses on care decisions made at the margin, OOP expendi-\ntures may best represent the spending that is made for a mar-\nginal unit of medical care. Second, the MEPS data contain\npremium expenditures only for the privately insured popula-\ntion; therefore, only including OOP health care financial bur-\nden best allows for comparison across insurance types.\nA final important outcome variable is the presence of an\nHDHP. MEPS separates out insurance plans according to\ntheir deductible within the privately insured population,\nallowing us to define a dichotomous variable as 1 for persons\na single/family plan, respectively, and 0 otherwise. This dis-\ntinction has been used in recent literature indicating a link\nbetween HDHPs and high health care financial burden.10\nAnalytical Methods\nOur first aim was to characterize unaffordability concerns\nacross the US population. To accomplish this, we broke\ndown the US population into subgroups differentiated by\ninsurance type and income bracket. We then analyzed the\nrelationship between unaffordability concerns and high\nhealth care financial burden within each group, to determine\nthe overlap between the two.\nUsing these subgroups, we calculated a range of summary\nstatistics, including using MEPS family weights to calculate\nthe number of families within that group across the US popu-\nlation, unaffordability concerns, and health care financial\nburden. Next, we calculated how unaffordability problems\nwithin these subgroups have varied over time.\nFinally, we set out to determine factors that had an impact\non unaffordability among the privately insured, and included\nthem into a model of families who would be most likely to\nhave financial concerns regarding OOP medical expendi-\ntures. We thus developed a series of predictive logistic mod-\nels of unaffordability on a household level to achieve this\ngoal. A logistic model measures the percentage change in the\nodds of a dependent variable based on a 1-unit increase from\na given baseline in each individual independent variable. We\ncategorized indicator variables into 4 groups: income indica-\ntors, demographic indicators, psychological and health indi-\ncators, and insurance plan indicators. We then modeled\nunaffordability using income and each other indicator cate-\ngory, with one overall model including all significant indica-\ntors from our first three. The rationale behind the chosen\nindicators within each group was based on the authors' intu-\nition, MEPS data availability, and ensuring that the chosen\nindicators provided a comprehensive basis for each group.\nof statistical significance of the relationship between inde-\npendent indicators and unaffordability in each model, using\n.01 as a cutoff for indicator inclusion in our overall model.\nResults and Analysis\nOur first aim was to compare unaffordability with health\ncare financial burden as a measure of financial barriers for\nthe US population. Figure 1 shows that not only are financial\nconcerns relatively nonoverlapping with high health care\nfinancial burden but also that reliance on health care finan-\ncial burden misses a large portion of the population that is\nforegoing care and therefore potentially not spending much\nFigure 1. Relationship between affordability and high OOP financial burden by insurance type and income level, 2014.\nNote. `Burden & Affordability' refers to the percentage of families facing 10% or more in OOP financial burden who reported affordability concerns.\n`OOP Burden Only' and `Affordability Only' refer to the percentage of families who either faced a 10% or higher OOP financial burden or who reported\naffordability concerns, but not both. OOP = out-of-pocket.\nmoney on health care. The correlation coefficient r is\nunaffordability and is not statistically significantly different\nfrom 0 (indicating independence).\nSummary statistics of unaffordability across all insurance\ntypes and income groups are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1 demonstrates that low-wage (income <200% of\nthe FPL), privately insured families, a group that encom-\npasses more than 14 million households, face high unafford-\nability barriers to receiving medical care, with between 14%\nand 16% of such families reporting foregoing medical care\nas a result of cost. This stands in stark contrast to higher\nwage, privately insured families, which tend to face among\nthe lowest unaffordability barriers to receiving care of any\ngroup. The low-wage, privately insured groups also have\nvery high levels of average financial burden, even sometimes\nexceeding annual income, particularly when premium costs\nare included. In the low-wage, privately insured population,\nfinancial burdens above 100% of annual income are most\nlikely a result of families relying on savings to pay for their\npremiums and OOP expenses.\nTrends of financial barriers over the past 4 years are\nshown in Figure 2. Unaffordability barriers facing privately\ninsured families with the lowest incomes (0-100 FPL)\nreached a 4-year high in 2014, while consistently surpassing\nMedicare and approaching the concerns reported by public-\nonly insured families. It is noteworthy that both the number\nof uninsured families as well as the rate at which uninsured\nfamilies report financial concerns have decreased substan-\ntially over the past 4 years.\nTo better understand the results shown in Table 1 and\nFigure 2, we tested a series of models looking for a set of\nindicators that had statistically significant relationships with\nunaffordability within the privately insured population\n(Table 2). Indicator definitions not found in the text can be\nfound in Online Appendix C.\nTable 2 displays the parameters of a series of predictive\nlogistic models. For example, a 1-unit change in family\nincome in our model refers to 10 000 dollars; in our Income\n+ Demographic indicators model, for example, for every\ndecrease in the odds of that family reporting a financial\nconcern.\nEvery model indicates that family income is signifi-\ncantly correlated with unaffordability using a P value of\n.001. In addition, this correlation is relatively stable\nregardless of which other independent indicators are held\nconstant. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis\nthat low-wage families are more likely to forego medical\ncare due to its cost.\nPerceived health has a strong positive correlation with\nunaffordability--the poorer someone's perceived health, the\nmore likely they are to report unaffordability concerns. This\nindicator was significant using a P value of .001.\nDepression in a family's reference person demonstrated a\nstrong correlation with likelihood to report unaffordability\nTable 1.

Using HDHPs as an indicator was statistically\nsignificant using a P value of .001.\nDiscussion\nBy implementing a metric for health care unaffordability, we\nare able to demonstrate the importance of considering both\nunaffordability and health care financial burden concerns in\nat-risk populations. The relative lack of intersection between\nfamilies with financial concerns and those with high health\ncare financial burden (Figure 1) indicates that these 2 con-\ncerns represent distinct and complementary problems of\npotential underinsurance. The substantial proportion of fami-\nlies that avoid or delay care, despite not reaching a 10% or\n20% financial burden threshold, emphasizes the importance\nof a qualitative unaffordability metric. Avoided or delayed\ncare, which our results show is surprisingly common among\nlow-income and uninsured families, represents a significant\npublic health concern. Delaying and avoiding care likely\nresults in poorer management of chronic health conditions,\nincreases the chance health problems go undiagnosed, and\nlikely increases future health care costs by failing to prevent\nmore severe health conditions. Avoidance of care due to\nfinancial concerns is necessary to consider alongside health\ncare expenditures, and with increased patient cost-sharing\nand the rising prevalence of HDHPs, low-income families\nare at an even greater risk for both high health care financial\nburden and unaffordability concerns.\nIn our model of unaffordability risk, we identify factors\nthat compound to put a privately insured family at risk for\navoiding or delaying medical care even beyond income\n(Table 2). In particular, we find large and significant\nreported risks of avoiding care when a family is covered\nunder an HDHP, when their reference person has worse\nperceived health, and when their reference person reports\ndepression. These results both support recent findings that\nHDHPs result in significant increased financial barriers to\nobtaining care and invite several possible psychological\nexplanations.10 The first is that those who are depressed or\nperceive themselves to be unhealthy are more likely to\nreport negative experiences, such as foregoing medical\ncare due to its cost.23 The second is that persons who can-\nnot afford medical care become depressed or unhealthy as\na result of the financial barriers they are facing.24 While\nthe latter represents a possible reverse causality wherein\nunaffordability results in depression, the true directionality\nis unknown. Previous work into this relationship has dem-\nonstrated that depression may directly influence access to\ncare through multiple mechanisms.25 The percentage of\nfamily income spent on OOP expenditures is not predictive\nof reporting unaffordability concerns, likely due to the\nindependence between unaffordability and health care\nfinancial burden.\nWhen using our unaffordability definition to identify indi-\nviduals who are significantly underinsured, it is important to\nnote the risk of false-positives. Our unaffordability metric is\nbased on qualitative survey responses within the MEPS\nquestionnaire, which is more ambiguous than calculated\nmeasures of expenditure burden. We can observe this possi-\nble false identification of at-risk families by looking at the\nresults in the >400% FPL privately insured population.\nWhile we typically would not define these families as finan-\ncially at risk, our unaffordability metric shows a larger-than-\nexpected percentage who report avoiding or delaying medical\ncare due to cost. This may be a result of those who, even at\nhigh income levels, are particularly price sensitive.26 It could\nalso be a result of those who have a distaste of high medical\ncosts or by the politicization of recent health care debates.\nOur multiyear analyses indicate a slight downward trend\nin unaffordability concerns in some of the most at-risk\ngroups, including both the privately insured population\nresult of Medicaid expansion under the ACA.27 We find that\nthe low-wage, privately insured population remains more\nvulnerable to reporting foregoing medical care due to finan-\ncial barriers than the Medicare population and is almost as\nvulnerable as the Medicaid population. These results add an\nimportant rationale to refocus research and policy on this\ngroup.\nConclusion\nLow-wage, privately insured individuals present a unique\nresearch and policy opportunity for improving medical care\naccessibility and unaffordability in the United States. To\nexamine financial barriers within this population, we applied\na measure of unaffordability and demonstrated its distinct\nand complementary relationship with the established health\ncare financial burden measure of barriers to accessing care.\nFrom our unaffordability measure, we created a model of\nbarriers facing the privately insured population. This model\npointed to both vulnerability of low-wage populations to\nunaffordability concerns and HDHPs having a strong nega-\ntive impact on families reporting being able to afford medi-\ncal care. These results highlight the value of increased\nresearch on low-wage, privately insured persons, as well as\nfurther investigation into the impacts of high-deductible\nhealth plans on financial barriers to obtaining medical care.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.
