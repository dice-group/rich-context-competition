Moreover, studies\non candidate-gene-based association are still very popular\nfor identifying genetic components of EH.3\nRenin, as the first enzyme of the RAAS cascade, is an\naspartyl protease synthesized by the juxtaglomerular cells of\nthe kidney. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I,\nwhich is further catalyzed to angiotensin II by ACE.\nAngiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and effective stim-\nulator of aldosterone release, thus affecting blood pressure\nand electrolyte homeostasis. Thereby, the gene encoding\nHaplotype-based association of renin gene\npolymorphisms with essential hypertension\nin Han population of northern china\nGuoping Zhang1, Xueyan Li2, Keyong Zhang2, Jingbo Zhao1*\nand Changchun Qiu2,3*\n Keywords\nRenin gene, intron, single-nucleotide polymorphism, haplotype, essential hypertension\n1Department of Epidemiology, Harbin Medical University, China\n2Institute of Polygenic Disease, Qiqihar Medical University, China\nNational Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Chinese Academy\nof Medical Sciences/Peking Union Medical College, China\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\nCorresponding author:\nJingbo Zhao, Department of Epidemiology, Public Health School,\nHarbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150081, China.\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nrenin is a good candidate for the study of EH etiology. The\nlength with 10 exons and nine introns in coding region.4\nIn the past two decades, a number of association stud-\nies between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of\nREN and EH have been performed, but unfortunately,\nresults have been inconsistent. Frossard et al.5\u00ad7 discov-\nered MboI and BglI polymorphisms, and their haplo-\ntypes had a significant association with EH among the\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) and US Caucasian popula-\ntions. Ahmad et al.8 also found MboI was implicated in\nthe pathogenesis of EH in Emirati people. However,\n1303G>A (BglI) had no association with EH in the popu-\nlations of Mexicans and Germans. Mohana Vamsi et al.10\nindicated that REN MboI polymorphism was not associ-\nated with EH in the South India population. Fu et al.11\nshowed that there was lack of correlation between MboI\npolymorphism and essential hypertension in Japanese.\nAfruza R et al.12 found that there was not any distinct\nassociation between BglI, TaqI, MboI, and EH in the\nBangladeshi population. The above-mentioned studies\nwere all about the REN intron. There were some studies\nabout other regulatory regions of the REN. In 2010,\nphism was associated with increased blood pressure in\nthe Irish population. Park et al.3 suggested that carriers\nhypertension amongst Korean women. Another aspect of\nREN variation was insert/deletion (I/D). Ying et al.14\nfound REN I/D polymorphism was associated with EH\nin the Chinese Mongolian population. Among these\nstudies, the SNPs in the first and ninth introns were hot\ntopics. Collectively, the research results were sometimes\ninconsistent and contradictory.\nIn our previous investigation,15 we found that SNPs\nwere clustered in intron 1. In order to explore the contribu-\ntion of this clustered feature to EH and the association of\nin the Han population of northern China.\nMethods\nSubjects\nThree thousand and ninety Han farmers of northern China\nwere selected from a large scale of field survey in the Lanxi\ncounty of Heilongjiang province, including 1533 EH\nyears old. The inclusion criteria for EH were: (a) average\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP)140 mm Hg and/or average\ndiastolic blood pressure (DBP)90 mm Hg tested on three\nseparate occasions; (b) although the blood pressure in three\ntests had not reached the required scale, the individual had\ntaken anti-hypertension drugs within the past two weeks.\nSubjects with diabetes, stroke, and secondary hypertension\nwere excluded. The inclusion criteria for controls were:\nattending the same field survey, with normal blood pressure,\nand not having taken any antihypertensive drugs, excluding\nthose for diabetes and stroke. All data were collected via\ndemographic questionnaire, direct measurement, and labo-\nratory examination.\nAll of the participants were independent and gave\ninformed consent. The study protocol was approved by the\nethics committees of Harbin Medical University.\nGenotyping\nGenomic DNA was extracted from leukocytes of periph-\neral venous blood using a commercial Blood Gen Midi kit\n(CWBio,China).\nGenotyping of 451bp DNA fragment in REN intron 1.Prim-\ners were designed via Primer Premier 5.0 software. The\nreference sequences were described in GenBank of human\nase chain reaction (PCR) system was 25 l (Supplemen-\ntary Material Table 1). An amplification was performed in\nMycycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, USA). The primer\nnucleotide sequence and cycle reaction conditions are\nreferred to in Supplementary Material Table 2. After the\namplification, PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose\ngel electrophoresis for quality detection. The distinct and\nbright gel with single band of 451 bp was collected and\nthen delivered to the commercial company (Huada Gene\nCompany, Beijing, China) for DNA sequencing via the\ndideoxy chain termination method. Sequencing results\nwere read with two software packages, DNAStar and\nChromas respectively.\nFrossard et al. study.5 The cycle condition is summarized\nin Supplementary Material Table 2. Subsequent to amplifi-\ncation, PCR products were subjected to 1% agarose gel\nelectrophoresis to detect the quality. The clear band of 250\nbp could be subjected to digestion using restriction endo-\nnuclease MboI. A quantity of 20 l of digestion mixture\nincluded 10 l PCR products, 0.6 l MboI restriction endo-\nnuclease (3U), 2 l New England Biolabs (NBE) buffer\nand 7.4 l double distilled water (ddH2\nO), which was incu-\nbated at 37\u00b0C for one hour. The digested products were\ngenotyped on 3% agarose gel electrophoresis using the\nData analyses\nData analyses were performed with Statistical Analysis\nSoftware (SAS) version 9.1.3. Values were expressed as\nnumbers, percentages, mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD).\nDemographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed\nZhang et al. 3\nby Student's t-test (enumeration data) or 2 test (measure-\nment data). Genotype frequencies were measured via\nSHEsis online software (http://analysis.bio-x.cn/myAnal-\nysis.php), to confirm whether they accorded with Hardy-\nWeinberg equilibrium (HWE). If they corresponded with\nHWE (p>0.05), further analysis could be carried out by\nsubsequent 2 test and logistic regression, which were uti-\nlized to analyze the genotypes and alleles distribution in\nboth case and control. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nanalysis was adopted to evaluate the distributional differ-\nences of SBP or DBP in three genotypes, based on SNP\nand group. SHEsis online software was employed to ana-\nlyze the haplotype distribution in both groups. The false\ndiscovery rate (FDR) was applied to correct multiple\nhypothesis testing.16\u00ad18 The FDR significance threshold\nResults\nDemographic and clinical characteristics of\nsubjects\n1557 controls, participated in this study. Their demo-\ngraphic and clinical characteristics are illustrated in\nTable 1. Variables with significant differences between\nthe two groups were age, abdominal circumference\n(AC), body mass index (BMI), triglyceride (TG), high-\ndensity lipoprotein (HDL), and fasting blood glucose\n(FBG). It was demonstrated that age, AC, BMI, TG,\nFBG were the risk factors for EH, whereas HDL was a\nprotective factor for EH.\nGenotyping\nPCR/sequencing of the 451bp DNA fragment in REN\nogy was used to identify homozygous or heterozygous\nshown in Figure 2.\nAnalyzing distribution of genotype and allele in\ntwo groups\nAt first, all genotypes of the six SNPs in the control group\nwere fitted to the HWE (p>0.05).

The result in Table 2 shows that, compared to\nGG genotype, GA and AA genotypes were statistically\nassociated with the risk of EH, with odds ratios (ORs)\nmodel analysis disclosed that the dominant model (GG\nversus AA+GA) had a statistically significant difference\nbetween EH and NT groups (FDR=0.00).

All the participants in this study were from\nrural areas of Lanxi County located at 46.27\u00b0N latitude,\nwhere the prevalence rate of hypertension was high (the\nas subjects in our study, which could rule out the interfer-\nence of population mobility that might affect the accuracy\nof this study.

More so, the\nresearch results could not be repeated for the geographical\nand genetic heterogenicity of EH. There was a lot of previ-\nous research on the REN intron 1 polymorphism with EH,\nbut almost no study involved the clustered variants that\nwere shown in the current investigation.

However, the analyses of genotype and\nallele of the other five SNPs clustered in the intron 1\nshowed no association with EH.\nBy the analysis of haplotype, 26 haplotypes were found\nin whole subjects. But there were only six haplotypes, of\nwhich frequencies were more than 3% in EH or NT. The\ndistributions of haplotypes H3, H4, H5, and H6 between\ncases and controls revealed a significant association\nH5 were more than 1.2, which were consistent with the\nrisk factor for EH. Moreover, the five clustered SNPs\ncould increase the risk of single allele A for EH, because\nboth more than 1.8. The OR values of haplotypes H4 and\nH6 were less than 0.9, which also proved that allele G was\nthe protective factor for EH. The analysis of haplotypes\nimplied that taking six SNPs simultaneously could enable\nus to find the association with EH. Haplotypes H3 and H5\nwould increase the risk of EH, while haplotypes H4 and\nH6 would protect people from getting EH.\nThere were several limitations in our study. First, it is\nbetter to randomly select SNPs in the whole gene when\nanalyzing the contribution of haplotype to disease.\nHowever, in order to explore the contribution of clustered\nSNPs in intron 1 to EH, we chose five SNPs that were clus-\nthe next step we need to do is to study the SNPs sited in the\n5'-control region and other introns. Second, confirmative\nstudies in other ethnic groups need to be performed.\nIn conclusion, we have preliminarily shown the signifi-\nfor EH in the Han population of northern China.\nFurthermore, we found that haplotypes A-T-C-G-C-A,\nA-T-C-G-C-G, G-C-T-G-T-A and G-C-T-G-T-G out of\nREN intron 1 and intron 9, contributed to the development\nof EH in the Han population of northern China. We believe\nthat further studies about the interaction of more SNPs in\nRAAS can help to elucidate the genetic mechanism of EH.\n"
