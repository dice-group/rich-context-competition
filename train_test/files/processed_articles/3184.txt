The compensation mechanism for counterparty credit risk is captured by a\nprotection contract contingent to the default arrival time and to the exposure at default\n(EAD). In the particular case of debt transactions, the cost of carry of the contingent\ndefault protection liability is the cost of funds above the riskless rate. In the case of\nderivative contracts, the cost of carry of default protection is either captured by a credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA), or by the cost of posting collateral, or a combination thereof.\nIn the past two decades, financial markets witnessed the implementation of different\nstandards for valuation of counterparty credit risk. The evolution of these standards was\ndriven by a desire to achieve a consistent valuation, an objective still not fully achieved\nin Basel III regulatory documents and ISDA Master Agreements. The current standards\nfor bilateral credit valuation adjustments are also plagued by various paradoxes related to\nown default risk (debit valuation adjustments, DVA) accounting which encourages anti-\neconomical behaviour by incentivising firms with poor credit policies and penalising firms\nwith good credit policies. Moreover, these paradoxes place an insurmountable limitation\nto the ability of replicating dynamically the price process of derivative transactions, a\nserious problem that hampers the role of banks as financial intermediaries.\nOur first proposal regarding a logically and financially consistent valuation framework\nfor CVA and DVA involves an inclusion of a first-to-default clause in default protection\ncontracts. This modification however represents a substantial deviation from the unilat-\neral CVA (UCVA) specification in Basel III. To remedy in part, we introduce the new\nnotion of a portable CVA (PCVA) which is logically and financially consistent and also\nvery close to the UCVA.\nWe next deviate from bilateral contracts and consider three counterparty credit risk\nmitigation structures based on margin lending and full collateralisation. We conclude\nthat the quadri-partite structure is the most promising one, whereby two margin lenders\nprovide hypothecs to ensure full collateralisation at all times to cover the open mark-to-\nmarket value of derivative transactions. These structures do not require a bank to carry\nout CVA trading, and hence would eliminate a source of significant market risk. Moreover,\nconditional counterparty spread volatility risk is transferred to the counterparty. Pure\ndefault risk is retained by the margin lenders that can securitise it in a straightforward\nmanner without being hampered by CVA volatility risk. We continue by introducing a\npenta-partite structure which is a variation of the quadri-partite structure above with\nthe inclusion of a central counterparty. In the penta-partite case, we conclude that,\nif a replication strategy between non-defaultable entities exists, then this strategy can\nbe implemented also by a defaultable structurer until its default time and the cost of\nreplication is the risk-free fair value, independently of the credit quality of the structurer.\nWe finish our paper with a short illumination of the case where finite liquidity is\nincluded.\nNicht-technische Zusammenfassung\nImmer dann, wenn ein ausfallgef\u00a8\nahrdetes Institut eine finanzielle Transaktion aus\u00a8\nubt,\nmuss es seinem Gesch\u00a8\naftspartner (Kontrahenten) Haltekosten zwecks Kompensation eines\nzuk\u00a8\nunftig m\u00a8\noglichen Risikos der Nichterf\u00a8\nullung der eigenen vertraglichen Verpflichtungen\nzahlen.

Die Entwicklung dieser An-\ns\u00a8\natze wurde von dem Wunsch angetrieben, eine global einheitliche Bewertung zu realisie-\nren; eine Zielsetzung, die weder durch die regulatorischen Basel III-Dokumente noch durch\ndie ISDA Master Agreements bewerkstelligt wurde. Das gegenw\u00a8\nartige Richtma\u00df bez\u00a8\nuglich\nder bilateralen Kreditbewertungsanpassung wird zudem noch durch unterschiedliche Para-\ndoxien belastet, die sich im Zusammenhang mit dem eigenen Ausfallrisiko und einer damit\nverbundenen Bilanzierung der\n\"\nSchuldenbewertungsanpassung\" (\n\"\ndebit valuation adjust-\nment (DVA)\") ergeben. Dadurch wird ein anti-\u00a8\nokonomisches Verhalten erzeugt, da aus-\nfallbehaftete Institute durch DVA noch weiter ermutigt werden, risikobehaftete Gesch\u00a8\nafte\nzu betreiben und die nicht (oder nur schwach) ausfallgef\u00a8\nahrdeten Institute stark benach-\nteiligt werden.

Diese Modifikation stellt jedoch eine signi-\nfikante Abweichung von der Spezifizierung eines nur unilateralen CVA (UCVA) in Basel\nIII dar. Um diesen Sachverhalt teilweise zu mildern, stellen wir den neuen Begriff der\nportablen Kreditbewertungsanpassung (\n\"\nportable CVA (PCVA)\") vor, der logisch und fi-\nnanzierungsm\u00a8\na\u00dfig konsistent ist und zudem eine hinreichend gute Approximation an das\nUCVA darstellt.\nAls N\u00a8\nachstes weichen wir von bilateralen Vertr\u00a8\nagen ab und betrachten drei weitere\nkontrahentenausfallrisikomindernde Modelle, die auf der Bereitstellung eines Kredits von\nSicherheitsleistungen und vollst\u00a8\nandiger Besicherung basieren.

The compensation mechanism for counterparty credit risk is captured by a\nprotection contract contingent to the default arrival time and to the exposure at default.\nIn the particular case of debt transactions, the cost of carry of the contingent default\nprotection liability is the cost of funds above the riskless rate. In the case of derivative\ncontracts, the cost of carry of default protection is either captured by a credit valuation\nadjustment (CVA), or by the cost of posting collateral, or a combination thereof.\nA number of different structuring styles for counterparty credit risk have so far been\nproposed and several market standards have emerged. Nevertheless, renewed efforts to\narrive at a stable market standard are still under way, particularly as counterparty credit\nrisk management is an element of key importance to the financial reforms enacted on the\nTraditionally, counterparty credit risk has been retained on banks' balance sheets along\nwith the risk implied by the CVA mark-to-market volatility. The CVA risk is transferred\ninternally within banks from business desks to CVA desks by transacting a Contingent\nCredit Default Swap (CCDS). A CCDS offers (to the protection buyer) protection against\ndefault of a reference entity, the nominal being given by the valuation of a reference\nportfolio at time of default. The valuation of the CVA for derivative books is described in\nAlbanese, Bellaj, Gimonet, and Pietronero (2011) while individual CCDS contracts are\nanalysed in Brigo and Pallavicini (2008).\nAn open market for CCDS contracts never established itself. The Financial Times\nRudimentary and idiosyncratic versions of these so-called contingent credit\ndefault swaps (CCDS) have existed for five years, but they have been rarely\ntraded due to high costs, low liquidity and limited scope.\nAs a consequence, counterparty credit risk has traditionally been managed with bilateral\nstructures, whereby two parties agree to bear each other counterparty credit risk, being\nremunerated each by a price adjustment.\nIn intuitive terms, if both parties B and C (say a bank and a corporate) have a relevant\ndefault probability, the following happens. B, having a choice, would trade the relevant\nportfolio with a default-free counterparty rather than with C. Therefore, in order to\ntrade with default risky C, B requires a reduction in the price of the trade from C to be\ncompensated for the additional default risk of C. This reduction is the credit valuation\nadjustment (CVA(B, C)) B measures on C. However, seen from the point of view of C,\nthis is an increase in the price C has to pay to enter the trade, because of C's own default\nrisk. Hence from C's point of view this is a debit valuation adjustment, or DVA(C, B),\nthat increases the price of the trade.\nOn the other hand, B may default too. Hence, C will require a discount in price as\nwell, the CVA(C, B) seen by C on B. This second CVA, when seen by B's point of view,\nwill be a DVA(B, C) increase in price to be paid to C, making the price higher to B\nitself. We will see that CVA(B, C) = DVA(C, B) and CVA(C, B) = DVA(B, C). This is\nclarified later on in the paper. Overall, when B computes the price of the trade, B will\nadd to the trade price\nDVA(B, C) - CVA(B, C) = CVA(C, B) - CVA(B, C).\nWhen C computes the price of the trade, C will add\nDVA(C, B) - CVA(C, B) = CVA(B, C) - CVA(C, B)\nwhich is the opposite of the adjustment added by B. In this sense there is agreement on\nthe price.\nThis is equivalent to a contractual exchange of mutual default protection without the\nintervention of third parties, remunerated at each other CVA. However, as we discuss in\nthis paper, the move towards central counterparty clearing (CCP) in OTC markets opens\nnew venues for counterparty credit risk transfer through multi-party arrangements.\n1.1 From unilateral CVA and CCDS to bilateral CVA\nPrior to 2007, counterparty credit risk was accounted for in terms of the so called unilateral\nCVA (or UCVA), a valuation methodology which stems from the modeling premise that\nthe party carrying out the valuation is default free, when it typically is not. See for\nexample Brigo and Masetti (2005) for the general framework under netting, and Brigo\nMorini, and Tarenghi (2011) for applications of this framework to various asset classes.\nClearly if both parties are defaultable and each pretends to be default free in doing the\ncalculation, each will try to have a reduction in price equal to the CVA. B will ask for a\nreduction equal to CVA(B, C), whereas C will ask for a reduction equal to CVA(C, B).\nWhat they should do is agree to have an adjustment (possibly positive or negative) equal\nto CVA(B, C)-CVA(C, B) and the opposite from C. This would be a bilateral valuation\nadjustment on which the two parties would agree and where, as in a swap, the total value\nof the trade to B is the opposite of the total value of the trade to C.\nThe unilateral adjustment UCVA is faulty as the valuation is asymmetric between the\ntwo parties and breaks the basic accounting principle according to which a liability for\none party (such as default protection sold to the counterparty) represents an asset for the\ncounterparty itself. Only monetary authorities are in a position to evade this accounting\nprinciple, which we refer to as money conservation. Accounting standards such as FAS 156\nand 157 remedied the inconsistency by prescribing that banks have to mark a unilateral\ndebit valuation adjustment (UDVA) which is equal in amount to the unilateral CVA\nbalance sheet entry realised by the counterparty but sits on the opposite side of the\ndouble entry ledger (cf. equation (2.1)). The CVA and DVA thus give contributions of\nopposite signs to the portfolio net asset value (NAV).\nThis reflects \"money conservation\" and applies to all forms of CVA including unilateral\nCVA and the other variants described below such as first-to-default CVA and portable\nCVA. In the unilateral case, the combination\nBCVA := UCVA - UDVA (1.1)\ndefines the so called bilateral CVA, see for instance Picoult (2005). The omission of the\nUDVA term is justified only when one of the two parties in the trade can be considered\nas being default-free, an assumption that was easily granted to a number of financial\nWhile restoring money conservation, accounting for the DVA introduced another valu-\nation inconsistency as close-out conditions ignored the UDVA and the loss of UDVA upon\ncounterparty default was not properly priced and accounted for. Indeed, if prior to the\ndefault of say C, B used to mark to market its trade with C by adding its DVA(B, C),\nnow that C has gone, the liquidators of C will ask B to pay the mark to market of the\ntrade without B's DVA(B, C) = CVA(C, B), so that the value of the trade to B since\npre-default days has decreased exactly by B's unilateral DVA(B, C). To lessen the im-\npact of the inconsistency, in 2009 the ISDA modified the wording of the close-out rule in\nthe Credit Support Annex (CSA) portion of master swap agreements, see ISDA (ISDA).\nUnder the new rule, the unilateral DVA (which is the UCVA for the other side) is recov-\nerable through the liquidation process on the same footing and with the same seniority\nand recovery rate of the mark-to-market valuation of the underlying transaction. Since\nthe UDVA is not recoverable entirely but only in part, this modification roughly halves\nthe impact of the mispricing and accounting inconsistency, without however eliminating\nit entirely.\nIn this paper, we consider a number of alternative contractual specifications which\ninstead are fully consistent from an accounting viewpoint and correctly price the possible\nloss of a fraction of DVA.\n1.2 First-to-default CVA and First-to-default DVA\nThe first consistent structures introduced historically are bilateral versions of the CVA and\nDVA which include a first-to-default contingency clause and are denoted with FTDCVA\nand FTDDVA. According to this clause, upon defaulting an entity is relieved of all the\nliabilities resulting from the default protection contracts it sold derivative counterparties\non their own default risk. The first-to-default clause appears in Duffie and Huang (1996),\nBielecki and Rutkowski (2002) and was made explicit in Brigo and Capponi (2008) in\nthe case of an underlying CDS. See also Brigo and Morini (2011) and Brigo and Morini\n(2010). It was considered in the case of interest rate portfolios in Brigo, Pallavicini, and\nPapatheodorou (2011) and also appears in Gregory (2009). In this context, the paper\nBrigo, Capponi, Pallavicini, and Papatheodorou (2011) extends the bilateral theory to\ncollateralisation and re-hypothecation and Brigo, Capponi, and Pallavicini (2011) shows\ncases of extreme contagion where even continuous collateralisation does not eliminate\ncounterparty risk.\nThe first-to-default CVA is consistent from an accounting standpoint. However, this\ndefinition does not come without shortcomings. One problem is that, if the credit of\nthe computing party is low, the FTDCVA can be substantially lower than the UCVA.\nAt default, the first-to-default CVA even vanishes. These material discrepancies between\nthe first-to-default CVA and the unilateral CVA contemplated in the Basel III accord\nhave undesirable side effects, such as for instance giving a competitive advantage to those\nfinancial institutions which are the slowest at endorsing the banking reform. In Watt\n\"I would say the top 10 banks in the market are all aware of this, are discussing\nit between themselves and are making the appropriate pricing changes\", says\nChristophe Coutte, global co-head of flow fixed income and currencies at\nSoci\u00b4\net\u00b4\ne G\u00b4\nen\u00b4\nerale Corporate and Investment Banking (SG CIB) in London.\n\"However, there are many smaller, regional banks that are not fully charg-\ning for the extra CVA capital in derivatives transactions. As we've prudently\nstepped up our prices, the tier-two and tier-three firms have filled the gap\nwe've left. They weren't competing before because they couldn't offer enough\nliquidity or the tightest bid-offer spreads, but now they can.\"\nA second problem is that the first-to-default CVA is unhedgeable since, to hedge it,\na bank would have to short its own credit, an impossible trade. This aggravates the\nalready serious problem of unhedgeability of the unilateral DVA term as it appears in the\ndefinition of the BCVA. A bank who is foreseeing a dramatic increase in its own credit\nquality may fear that DVA will decrease dramatically. We have seen that the typical\nDVA gains in the market have been of the order of magnitude of billions, see for example\nBrigo (2011). Hence banks try to prepare for the opposite moves by trying to hedge DVA,\nand they tend to do that by proxying, see again Brigo (2011) and Brigo, Morini, and\nPallavicini (2013) for the details and references.\nFinally, if the first-to-default CVA is used for pricing while the unilateral CVA is\nused to determine capital requirements, the material mismatch between the two makes\nit difficult to optimise risk management strategies. Furthermore, if a bank charges the\nFTDCVA to clients but then has to provision a higher amount given by the UCVA, the\ndifference needs to be provisioned either by separate fundraising or from Tier 1 capital.\nThe Basel III accord prescribes that banks should compute unilateral CVA by assuming\nindependence of exposure and default. The advanced framework allows banks to imple-\nment the effect of wrong way risk (i. e., the risk that occurs when the bank's exposure\nto its counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty)\nin the calculation of their exposures by using own models, while under the standardised\napproach the Basel III accord accounts for the effect by means of a one-size-fits-all mul-\ntiplier. Examples in Brigo and Pallavicini (2007), Brigo and Bakkar (2009), Brigo and\nChourdakis (2009), Brigo et al. (2011) indicate that the actual multiplier (the so called\n\"alpha\" multiplier) is quite sensitive to model calibration and market conditions and that\nthe advanced framework is more risk sensitive.\nInterestingly, the Basel III accord chooses to ignore the UDVA in the calculation for\ncapital adequacy requirements. Although consideration of the UDVA needs to be included\nfor accounting consistency, no such principle exists as far as capital requirements are\nconcerned.\nDue to the variety of possible different definitions of CVA (unilateral CVA, bilateral CVA,\nfirst-to-default CVA) combined with boundary conditions such as risk free or replacement\ncloseouts and the option to use either exact or approximate treatment of wrong way risk,\nthere appears to be material discrepancies in CVA valuation across financial institutions.\nThis was pointed out recently in the article Watt (2011). The most significant discrepancy\nis between UCVA and FTDCVA. Both are used in the industry for valuation, while only\nthe former is endorsed for regulatory purposes in Basel III.\nIn this paper, we introduce consistent structures called portable CVA and DVA (or\nPCVA and, respectively, PDVA), defined so that, upon counterparty default, the PDVA\nreduces exactly to the unilateral DVA by definition. These structures have not been\ndiscussed previously in the literature and are introduced here because we find them in-\nteresting from the point of view of facilitating novations in case of a default of clearing\nmembers clearing their OTC trades through a CCP.\nLooking at the point of view of B for example, portable CVA is obtained when party B\nmarks to market the position by subtracting from its fair value calculation the discounted\nvalue of the DVA of C that B would be liable to pay upon defaulting, in case B defaults\nprior to C. This is a definition that places portable CVA right in between unilateral CVA\nand first to default CVA. It addresses the inconsistencies of UCVA in a less dramatic way\nthan full-fledged FTDCVA. This is rather subtle to appreciate and Section 5 provides the\ndetails.\nFrom a quantitative standpoint, the difference between UCVA and PCVA is minimal.\nThe portable CVA assessed by an entity converges to the unilateral CVA whenever the\ncredit-worthiness of the entity is perfect. Portable CVA and portable DVA are bilateral\nstructures in that they are contingent on the credit process of both parties. They are also\nmore conservative than the unilateral structures in the sense that PCVA  UCVA.\nAs we discuss in Section 5, an approximate upper bound for the difference between\nthe portable CVA and the unilateral CVA is given by the product between UDVA and the\nprobability of default. Unlike the situation in the case of the FTDCVA, this difference is\nnearly immaterial in most circumstances.\n1.5 CVA VaR and periodic resets\nThe CVA, i. e., the price of default protection contracts exchanged by parties in unsecured\nderivative transactions, needs to be marked-to-market on a daily basis and is thus volatile.\nThe management of CVA volatility risk is crucial to mitigate the CVA VaR capital\ncharge. A proposal is to trade long dated swaps with an embedded obligation for both\nparties to restructure the trade to equilibrium periodically while exchanging a payment\nto settle the mark-to-market difference at the reset date. However, this sort of modified\nswap is not economically equivalent to the original long-dated swaps.\nA not very practical but conceptually interesting alternative is to structure CVA and\nDVA so that they are reset periodically to equilibrium leading to a floating rate variant\nof CVA and DVA. As a simple example, let's consider the case of a bilateral transaction\nbetween the default-free bank B and the defaultable counterparty C. Instead of charging\nCVA upfront at the start date for the entire maturity of the transaction, the bank may\nrequire a CVA payment at the start date for protection over the first 6 months period.\nAfter 6 months, the bank would require a CVA payment for protection for a further six\nmonths period and so on, up to the final maturity of the trade.\nThe benefit of having periodic resets would be that this would mitigate the volatility of\nthe CVA by forcing it periodically to equilibrium. However, the difficulty in implementing\nsuch a structure is that fixing the CVA premium in future semi-annual protection windows\nwould be subject to model risk and could be the cause of legally unresolvable controversy\nFigure 1: General quadri-lateral scheme including as special cases bilateral arrangements\n(just B and C), tri-lateral arrangements (such as A, B and C) and quadri-lateral arrange-\nments with all four. The margin lenders A and D post collateral.\nbetween the two parties. Although there is no regulatory framework surrounding this case\nyet, there is also no precedent (to our knowledge) of bilateral contracts with contingent\nfixings which are influenced by one of the two parties' discretionary decisions regarding\nmodeling choices.\nA more robust implementation of the floating rate CVA paradigm from the viewpoint\nof financial stability and mitigation of systemic risk involves having third parties intervene\ncompetitively in the valuation process. The floating rate structures in the next subsection\nincludes the case of full collateralisation and gives examples of such solutions where fixings\nare controlled by offer and demand.\n1.6 Full collateralisation and margin lending\nNew classes of structuring styles emerge whenever one introduces the notion of full collat-\neralisation and margin lending, see also Albanese, Pietronero, and White (2011), Albanese\nand Pietronero (2011) and Albanese, D'Ippoliti, and Pietronero (Albanese et al.). Full\ncollateralisation is known to be a very effective remedy to reduce counterparty risk. Be-\ncause of the existence of gap risk and to counteract the volatility of mark-to-market\nvaluations, one actually requires haircuts and overcollateralisation schemes to reduce the\nrisk to almost nil, see again Brigo et al. (2011).\nThe incentive towards full collateralisation is built into the regulatory framework it-\nself. The recent article Watt (2011) reports that uncollateralised trades are expected to\nconsume up to four times more capital under Basel III. The same article reports of the\ncase of Lufthansa, saying\n\"The airline's Cologne-based head of finance, Roland Kern, expects its earn-\nings to become more volatile - not because of unpredictable passenger numbers,\ninterest rates or jet fuel prices, but because it does not post collateral in its\nderivatives transactions.\"\nTraditionally, the CVA is typically charged by the structuring bank B either on an\nupfront basis or by the sake of being built into the structure as a fixed coupon stream.\nMargin lending instead is predicated on the notion of floating rate CVA payments with\nperiodic resets and is designed in such a way to transfer the credit spread volatility risk\nand the mark-to-market volatility risk from the bank to the counterparties. We may\nexplain this more in detail by looking at Figure 1.\nCollateral is most effectively allocated by margin lenders not by transfering the own-\nership of qualifying collateral assets, but in the form of hypothecs on qualifying collateral.\nA hypothec is a contract written on underlying assets that transfers neither the ownership\nnor the possession of the assets, but simply a lien contingent to specific default events\noccurring.\nThe counterparty C is concerned about the amount of collateral she may have to\npost periodically in order to trade derivatives with bank B. To avoid posting collateral,\nC enters into a margin lending transaction. C pays periodically (say semi-annually) a\nfloating rate CVA to the margin lender A (`premium' arrow connecting C to A). In turn,\nthe margin lender A distributes the premium to investors according to a seniority hierarchy\n(`premium' arrow connecting A to the investors). In exchange for this premium, the\ninvestors provide the margin lender A with transferable hypothecs to qualifying collateral\nassets over a six-months period (`collateral' arrow connecting the investors to A). In turn,\nA passes the hypothecs to a custodian (`collateral' arrow connecting A to the custodian)\nto meet collateral calls from the counterparty B. If C defaults within the semi-annual\nperiod, B has a claim to the hypothec posted at the custodian and A apportions the\nloss to its investors in increasing order of seniority, e.g. first to the equity investor, then\nto the mezzanine, then to the senior, then to the super-senior, etc. In this fashion, A\nprovides protection to B on its derivative exposure with respect to C (`protection' arrow\nconnecting the custodian to B) and the default risk is transferred to the investors of the\nmargin lender on whose collateral the hypothecs had been written.\nAt the end of the six months period, the protection contract needs to be renewed, thus\nforcing a reset to an updated premium that keeps the structure at equilibrium. At the\nend of the period, the margin lender has no residual obligation and may decide whether to\nbid for a renewal or abstain from it. In turn, C may opt to renew the protection contract\nwith the same margin lender or another or even to syndicate the required coverage across\na number of margin lenders. Thanks to the periodic resets, the counterparty C is bearing\nthe CVA volatility risk, whereas B is not exposed to it. This is in stark contrast to the\nsituation which could happen in the case of traditional upfront or fixed rate CVA charges.\nThe various structuring styles that can be devised for margin lending are predicated\non the separation between default risk on one side, market risk and spread volatility risk\non the other. As a consequence, these structures are in general multi-lateral. A tri-lateral\nstructure involves only one margin lender and only one party that posts full collateral.\nIn a quadri-lateral structure, collateral posting obligations are symmetric and there are\ntwo lenders, one for the buy-side party and one for the sell-side party. The margin lender\nfor the sell-side party takes up concentrated bank risk and is likely to be distinct from\nthe margin lender specialised in non-banks. Structuring can also be penta-lateral in case\nthere is a central counterparty (CCP) that stands as a universal counterparty to both\nsides. The presence of a CCP favors the novation process but still requires a market\ninfrastructure to facilitate margin lending. From a contractual viewpoint, multi-party\nstructures still consist of a series of two-party contracts, hence there are no complexities\nassociated to multi-party legal agreements.\nIn this paper, we first consider three examples of structures with margin lending: a\nquadri-lateral one with daily resets, a quadri-lateral one with periodic resets over longer\ntime intervals and a tri-lateral one also with periodic resets. All these structures are\nconsistent from an accounting standpoint and the principle of arbitrage freedom.\nBeing based on floating CVA payments that reset periodically and are proportional to\nthe counterparty's conditional credit spreads and open exposure, quadri-lateral structures\nremedy the unhedgeability issue that plague all the various forms of bilateral CVA by ef-\nfectively ensuring that CVA volatility risk is absorbed by the party that is responsible for\ngenerating it. Default risk instead is passed on to the investors who finance the margin\nlenders. We suggest this structuring style gives rise to a more resilient market infras-\ntructure than the traditional one based on bilateral long-term CVA and DVA structures\nwhich are left to the bank to hedge. If in addition CCPs are present, the effectiveness\nof margin lending benefits of the greater degree of netting which reduce the carry cost of\nderivative replication strategies, see Figure 2.\n1.7 Macro-economic impact\nThe traditional CVA and DVA bilateral structures are based on the mutual exchange\nof long-term default protection contracts. This effectively embeds credit exposures in\neach and every derivative transaction. Given the size of global derivative markets, the\nembedded credit optionality effectively transfers wealth on a global scale with a substantial\nmacro-economic impact.\nAll participants in derivative markets, by transacting interest rate swaps or FX op-\ntions or any other derivative, credit-linked or not, have acquired automatically credit\nprotection on themselves and sold credit protection on their counterparties. This implies\nthat whenever an entity's credit worsens, it receives a subsidy from its counterparties in\nthe form of a DVA credit protection asset which can be monetised by the entity's bond\nholders upon their own default. In fact, the acquired protection on itself by the defaulted\nentity mitigates the carry cost of derivative positions and ultimately does not drain cash\nas rapidly as would happen otherwise as the entity approaches default. Whenever an\nentity's credit improves instead, it is effectively taxed as its DVA depreciates. Wealth is\nthus transfered from the equity holders of successful companies to the bond holders of\nfailing ones, the transfer being mediated by banks acting as financial intermediaries and\nimplementing the traditional CVA/DVA mechanics.\nRewarding failing firms with a cash subsidy may be a practice of debatable merit as\nit skews competition. But rewarding failing firms with a DVA asset is without question\nsuboptimal from an economic standpoint: the DVA asset they receive is paid in cash\nfrom their counterparties. However, it cannot be invested and can only be monetised by\nbond holders upon default. The portion that is not monetised by bond holders, ends up\nsitting as a CVA reserve on banks' balance sheets. Either way, these capitals are largely\nsterilised.\nMargin lending structures reverse the macro-economic vicious circles engendered by\nDVA mechanics by effectively eliminating long term counterparty credit risk insurance and\navoiding the wealth transfer that benefits the bond holders of defaulted entities. This has\nseveral effects: (i) it accelerates the default of failing firms by extracting cash payments\nproportional to their credit spread and the fair value of the positive derivative exposure,\n(ii) it reduces recovery rates without damaging derivative counterparties but only bond\nholders of the defaulted entities, (iii) it gives an incentive to failing firms to orderly unwind\ntheir derivative position as they approach default, (iv) it reduces the carrying costs for\nderivatives trades to those more successful firms whose spreads tighten and gives them a\ncompetitive advantage by strengthening their ability to hedge.\nThe impact of monetary and government policy in times of crisis is also radically\ndifferent. Prior to the crisis, banks used to set aside a CVA reserve which is just the\nexpected level of loss due to counterparty credit risk. Losses in excess of the CVA were\nnot budgeted for and fell back to the banks' treasury departments. When the crisis\narrived, the firms whose credit deteriorated had DVA claims that overwhelmed banks\nand forced governments to intervene with major cash injections. These funds selectively\nbenefited failing firms whose DVA gains were the highest. High quality names with\nrelatively tighter credit spreads instead did not draw any benefit. The government policy\nof providing subsidies in terms of DVA financing perhaps inadvertently favoured only the\nbond holders of defaulted entities who monetised the subsidy at the time of recovery.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this policy did not prove to be a particularly efficient allocation\nof resources and was unable to help reverting the economic recessionary phase.\nThe Basel III accord improves on the pre-crisis situation by allowing for CVA VaR\ncharges which effectively raise the bar for capital adequacy and strengthen provisioning\nstrategies. More importantly, the Basel III accord also offers the alternative of full col-\nlateralisation which solves the problem of counterparty credit risk at the root (except in\ncases of extreme contagion), thus eliminating the anti-economical DVA subsidies to the\nbond holders of bankrupt firms. However, full collateralisation raises the spectrum of\nheightened liquidity risk unless a robust and extensive market infrastructure for margin\nlending is established.\nAssuming an infrastructure for margin lending extensive enough to cover the entire\nscope of derivative markets, a systemic financial crisis could still be caused by a mismatch\nbetween offer and demand in the hypothecs market. This would happen if margin lenders\ncannot provision sufficient hypothec capital buffers from investors to lend to participants\nin derivative markets so that they can meet their collateral posting obligations in full. The\nexistence of a fully developed market infrastructure for margin lending would help averting\na systemic crisis by providing a new tool for monetary authorities to inject liquidity\ntemporarily in the form of short-term, super-senior hypothec financing to margin lenders.\nThis sort of intervention would still be an exceptional occurrence, but would arguably be\nless intrusive from a macro-economic standpoint than quantitative easing and the heavy\ninjection of government funding into the banking system. While a crisis could be mitigated\nby granting super-senior hypothecs, it would still lead to a widening of credit spreads and\nextract wealth from failing firms in the form of insurance premia, thus accelerating or\neven triggering defaults and ultimately reducing recovery rates on defaulted debt, to the\ndetriment of debt holders.\nWe foresee margin lenders in OTC markets to be financial intermediaries negotiating\nhypothecs. While on the asset side there are insurance wraps on netting sets created\nthrough full collateralisation by hypothecs to qualifying collateral, on the liability side on\nFigure 2: Multi-party scheme involving a central counterparty.\nthe balance sheet of margin lenders there are investors providing transferable hypothecs to\nqualifying collateral of which they retain ownership. The hypothec notes issued by margin\nlenders will arguably be ranked by seniority and be similar to a securitisation structure\nintermediate between a cash and synthetic CDO. Similarly to synthetic CDOs, hypothec\ntranche payments do not include riskless interest rates but are only based on credit spreads\nas the beneficial owners of the assets underlying hypothecs are receiving interest payments\nindependently. However, similarly to a cash CDO, hypothecs are fully collateralised and\nunlevered. Unlike both traditional synthetic and cash CDOs, we envisage hypothecs to be\nshort term instruments with maturities of about 6 months as their objective is to ensure\nthat CVA volatility risk is not transferred as with standard CVA/DVA structuring, but\nrests with the originating counterparty.\nThe CDO market played a trigger role in the crisis started in 2007 in part because\nof the inadequate, over-simplistic and non-rigorous local valuation methodologies such as\nthe one-factor Gaussian copula model which did not take advantage of modern comput-\ning technologies, see for instance Brigo, Pallavicini, and Torresetti (2010). The insistence\non bilateral CVA structuring with the consequent large scale wealth transfer and anti-\neconomical misallocations are similarly not due to a conscious policy decision. Instead,\nthey derive from the use of inadequate and simplistic methodologies that are not techno-\nlogically current and only allow the valuation of linear risk metrics which are indifferent to\ncredit-credit correlations across counterparties such as the traditional forms of CVA. Mov-\ning toward margin lending will thus require a wave of renewal and a realignment between\nmathematical modeling and computing technologies along with rigorous and consistent\nglobal valuation methodologies.\n1.8 Organisation of the paper\nThe paper is organised as follows. Section 2 contains definitions and axioms that ac-\nceptable counterparty credit risk structures need to satisfy. Section 3 reviews the three\nhistorical standards for counterparty credit risk that dominated in the periods prior to\nthe accounting and valuation standpoint. As we explain, inconsistencies have gradually\nbeen recognised and reduced through time but were not entirely eliminated. In Section\n4, we discuss the first-to-default CVA, the first fully consistent structure that has been\nproposed. In Section 5, we introduce two alternative forms of portable CVA. In Section 6,\nwe discuss collateralised transactions based on a market infrastructure for margin lending.\nEach of the Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 includes a comparison in terms of consistency from\nan accounting and valuation standpoint, hedgeability, numerical complexity, portability\nupon default, induced behaviour and macro-economic impact. In Section 7, we discuss\ndynamic replication and in Section 8 we consider the case of finite liquidity. Section 10\nconcludes.\nFinally, we would like to point out that this is not meant to be a fully rigorous\nmathematical paper. We believe the mathematics to be sound but we have not formalised\nit fully as our objective is to provide an informal introduction. We will formalise the\nframework in full technical and rigorous detail in future work.\n2 Definitions and axioms\nFor the probabilistic setup and our use of arbitrage freedom we refer to the appendix.\nConsider two defaultable entities B and C, exchanging stochastic cash flows from time\n0 and up to the future final time T. Let B\nand C\nbe the stopping times for default of\nB and C respectively. Also, let Rt\n(B) and Rt\n(C) be the recovery rates in case B and C\ndefault at time t, respectively. Finally, let rt\nbe the risk-free rate and let's agree to work\nunder the risk neutral measure for pricing.\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Finance (cf. e. g. de Finetti (1931), Del-\nbaen and Schachermayer (1994), Harrison and Pliska (1981)) there is no arbitrage if and\nonly if all market transactions between any pair of non-defaultable entities, i. e., entities\nwhere B\n= C\n=  with probability one, are valued as the discounted expectation of\nfuture cash flows under a globally defined valuation measure. Therefore, in the default-\nfree case, we denote the related fair value to B by Mt\n(B) = -Mt\n(C). We assume this\nfair value has been obtained through the risk neutral valuation formula as an expectation\nof future discounted cash flows under one and the same globally calibrated measure used\nacross all instruments (cf. e.g. Bielecki and Rutkowski (2002), Definition 8.1.2.). We also\nassume that there is a final maturity T <  such that no cash flows occur after time T,\ni. e., Mt\n(B) = Mt\n(C) = 0 t > T\nThe process rt\nis the short-term interest rate and is assumed to be adapted to the\nmarket filtration at time t. Similarly, Et\ndenotes expectation conditional on the same\nfiltration1.\nLet Vt\n(B) and Vt\n(C) denote the fair values to parties B and C respectively of the trans-\naction. Defaultable transactions are not directly covered by the Fundamental Theorem\nsince the life of a valuation agent is limited by its own default arrival time.\nIn Brigo (2005) the case of the CDS options market model is analysed, where equiv-\nalence of measures is restored through a complicated approach based on a restricted fil-\ntration which takes out the default singularity when taking expectations, see also Morini\nand Brigo (2011) for the multi-name version of the same technique.\nWe can nevertheless avoid such technicalities and reduce the problem of fair valu-\nation to the Fundamental Theorem by decomposing a defaultable transaction in terms\n1Mathematical modeling of filtration and processes will be made explicit in a subsequent paper.\nof an economically equivalent portfolio of hypothetical transactions exchanged between\ntwo hypothetical non-defaultable entities and which explicitly includes default protection\ncontracts on B and C. This is similar, in the bilateral case, to B and C buying protec-\ntion through contingent CDS from default-free parties to perfectly hedge the respective\nunilateral CVA's with respect to C and B.\nDefinition 2.1 In case at least one of the two parties B or C is defaultable and there are\nno collateral posting provisions ensuring a 100% safe level of overcollateralisation, i. e., if\nthe recovery rate on the fair value of a derivative transaction is not one by construction,\nthen the transaction is called uncollateralised. If B and C are obligated to post full\ncollateral as a guarantee through a margin lender with a safe buffer of overcollateralisation\nthat is safe with probability 1, the transaction is collateralised. We use this extreme\nnotion of collateralisation to simplify exposition but the assumption can be relaxed.\nIf only two parties B and C are involved and they exchange protection with each other,\nthe transaction is called bilateral. If in addition C buys protection on its own default\nfrom a margin lender A while still B buys protection on its own default from C, the\ntransaction is tri-lateral. If B buys protection from a margin lender D and C buys\nprotection from a margin lender A, the transaction is quadri-lateral. Finally, if there\nis a central counterparty (CCP) that stands as the counterparty to all trades as in Figure\n2, the transaction is penta-lateral.\nRemark 2.2 In a traditional bilateral transaction one may be used to CVA and DVA\nterms being calculated in a standard way. Such terms are equivalent to the positions\nmentioned above in the following sense.\nThe CVA term B charges to C is given by the loss given default fraction of the residual\nexposure measured by B at default of the counterparty C if such exposure is positive. This\nis the loss faced by B upon default of C. If C does not pay such loss to B, this is like\nsaying that B is condoning such loss to C, or in other terms B is selling protection to\nC on the traded portfolio contingent on C's own default. This would be like B offering\na contingent CDS to C, offering protection against default of C to C and referencing\nthe traded portfolio between B and C. A similar analogy holds for the DVA term and C\nselling protection to B against B's own default.\nWe now move to analyse more in detail the axioms that CVA and DVA price processes\nshould satisfy. In the following we are not referring to a particular formulation of CVA\nor DVA, unless explicitly mentioned. We are rather writing down the requirements that\nany sensible definition of CVA and DVA should satisfy.\n2.1 Uncollateralised bilateral transactions\nIf the transaction is bilateral and uncollateralised, then party B sells to party C default\nprotection on C contingent to an amount specified by a close-out rule. Vice versa on\nthe default of B, party C sells protection to B on the default of C.\nIn formulas:\nVt\n(B) = Mt\n(B) - CVAt\n(B, C) + DVAt\n(B, C),\nVt\n(C) = Mt\n(C) - CVAt\n(C, B) + DVAt\nwhere\n\u00b7 Mt\n(B) is the mark to market to B in case both B and C are default-free;\n\u00b7 CVAt\n(B, C) is the value of default protection that B sells to C contingent on the\ndefault of C, as assessed by B at t.\n\u00b7 DVAt\n(B, C) is the value of default protection that C sells to B contingent on the\ndefault of B, as assessed by B at t.\n\u00b7 Similar definitions extend in case we exchange B and C, i. e. B  C.\nThe above two valuation formulas reflect the decomposition of the trade as a sum of\na riskless derivative transaction and reciprocal default protection contracts. For all the\nspecific definitions of CVA or DVA that we examine below, we require that the valuation\nis decomposed as in the both equations (2.1).\nIt will occasionally be helpful to write (2.1) exactly at a default time. For instance, in\nthe scenarios where B\n< C\n, we write\nDVAB\n(C, B) - CVAB\n(C, B) = VB\n(C) - MB\nIn order for the valuation of an uncollateralised, bilateral transaction to be fully consis-\ntent, the axioms (A1\n) below must be valid along with one of the close-out conditions\nbelow, either (C1\n):\n) Discounted martingale condition until default: The process CVAt\n(B, C) is defined\nfor all t  B\n C\nand satisfies the equation\n(B, C) = Et\ne- BC\nt\n) Money conservation until default:\n(B, C) = DVAt\n(B, C) = CVAt\nfor all t  B\n C\n.\n) Risk-free close-out rule: If B\n< C\n, then\nVB\n(C) = -(MB\n(C))- + RB\n(B)(MB\n(C))+ = MB\n(C) - (1 - RB\n(B))(MB\n(C))+ .\nHere a+ := max{a, 0}, a- := a+ - a = (-a)+ for all reals a. VB\n(C) is interpreted\nas the value to C of the transaction at the time when B defaults. Consequently, due\nto (2.2) we can recast (2.6) as follows:\nCVAB\n(C, B) = (1 - RB\n(B))(MB\n(C))+ + DVAB\nSimilar conditions with B  C also hold.\n) Replacement close-out rule: If B\n< C\n, then\nVB\n(C) = -(MB\n(C) + DV AB\n(C, B))- + RB\n(B)(MB\n(C) + DVAB\n(C, B))+.\n= MB\n(C) + DV AB\n(C, B) - (1 - RB\n(B))(MB\n(C) + DV AB\n(C, B))+ .\nEquivalently (due to (2.2)) we have that\nCVAB\n(C, B) = (1 - RB\n(B))(MB\n(C) + DV AB\nSimilar conditions with B  C also hold.\nIn condition (C2\n), notice that the amount (1-RB\n(B))(MB\n(C, B))+ can\nbe interpreted as the novation cost, i. e., the loss amount to C deriving from the default\nof B and assuming that the same derivative transaction is novated with a default-free\ncounterparty at time B\n. A similar financially motivated interpretation is not available\nin the case of a risk-free close-out as in (C1\n) as this rule does not reflect correctly the\nnovation cost to the surviving party.\n2.2 Collateralised quadri-lateral transactions with high frequency\nresets\nCollateralised transactions are best interpreted as transactions which reset periodically\nin time whereby C buys default insurance from a margin lender A and B buys default\ninsurance from a margin lender D. See Figure 1.\nThe case of high frequency time resets on short periods t is mathematically the\nsimplest, although not quite realistic as very frequent credit spread resets would imply\nmajor liquidity risk. We assume here that there is no jump in the risk free valuation M\nof the contract when default happens. This is not the case for Credit Default Swaps as\nunderlying instruments under a variety of models, see for example Brigo et al. (2011). In\nour case, though, we assume there are no jumps and there is no instantaneous contagion\nand as a consequence the contractual structures are designed in such a way to periodically\nreset valuations with (equidistant) period t > 0 at the following equilibrium levels\n(i = 0, 1, . . . , n = T\nt\n}):\nVit\nVit\n(B) = Mit\nVit\n(C) = Mit\nVit\nTo achieve this objective the margin lender A secures in a segregated custodian account\na sufficient amount of collateral to guarantee that the amount (Mt\n(C))- is paid to B in\ncase C defaults at t, thus offsetting the counterparty credit risk that C would otherwise\npose to B. In return, C pays to A a stream of premia payments t\n(A, C) with period\nt. Symmetrically, B pays a cash flow stream t\n(D, B) to D so to ensure that C is\nimmunised from the risk of default of B.\nIn the case of this structure, the arbitrage free valuation axiom reads as follows:\nFigure 3: tri-lateral scheme whereby the counterparty C posts collateral to the bank B\nby borrowing the collateral from the margin lender A.\n) Discounted martingale condition until default:\nEt\n[Vt\n(A) + 1t<C <t+t\n(C))(MC\n(C))- + t\nEt\n[Vt\n(D) + 1t<B<t+t\n(B))(MC\n(B))- + t\nfor all t < B\n C\n. Here, Vt\n(A)  Vt+t\n(A) - Vt\n(A) and we neglect discounting\nas is legitimate in the asymptotic limit t  0.\n2.3 Collateralised tri-lateral transactions with periodic resets\nThe tri-lateral case is described in Fig. 3 and correponds to a situation where the coun-\nterparty C has the obligation to post collateral in full to the bank B, while the bank B\ndoes not have a similar obligation.\nIf resets are periodic and occur at times Ti\n, i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, the fair value of the\nposition to the margin lenders is zero only at the reset dates Ti\n. However, the margin\nlender A sells default protection to C, a contract whose value is CVAt\n(A, C). Similarly,\nD sells default protection to B.\nVt\n(A) = e\nt\nTi\nrsdsTi\n(A, C) - CVAt\nVt\n(B) = Mt\n(B) + DVAt\nVt\n(C) = Mt\n(C) - CVAt\n(C, B) + DVAt\n) Discounted martingale conditions until default: For all t  [Ti\n], the CVA terms\nsatisfy the equation\n(A, C) = Et\n[e- C\nt\n(C))(MC\n(C))-], t < C\n(C, B) = Et\n[e- B\nt\nrsds(1 - RB\n(B))(MB\n(B))-], t < B\nand the premium received by A from C is computed so that\nTi\n(A, C) = CVATi\n) Money conservation until default:\n(A, C) = DVAt\n(C, B) = DVAt\nfor all t < B\n C\n,\n2.4 Collateralised quadri-lateral and penta-lateral transactions\nwith periodic resets\nThe quadri-lateral case is described in Figure 1 and correponds to a situation where both,\nthe counterparty C and the bank B have a contractual obligation to post collateral in full\nto each other.\nIn the case of periodic resets at times Ti\n, i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, the fair value of the position\nto the margin lenders is zero only at the reset dates Ti\n. However, the margin lender A sells\ndefault protection to C, a contract whose value is CVAt\n(A, C) at t. In return, A obtains\nfrom C premium payments Ti\n(A, C) at times Ti\n, i = 0, 1, . . . , n. Similarly, D sells default\nprotection to B and receives periodic premium payments Ti\n(D, B) at Ti\n, i = 0, 1, . . . , n.\nAssuming t  [Ti\n],\nVt\n(A) = e\nt\nTi\nrsdsTi\n(A, C) - CVAt\nVt\n(B) = Mt\n(B) + DVAt\nVt\n(C) = Mt\n(C) + DVAt\nVt\n(D) = e\nt\nTi\nrsdsTi\n(D, B) - CVAt\n) Discounted martingale conditions until default: For all t  [Ti\n] the CVA terms\nsatisfy the equation\n(A, C) = Et\n[e- C\nt\n(C))(MC\n(C))-], t < C\n(D, B) = Et\n[e- B\nt\n(B))(MB\n(B))-], t < B\nand the premia are computed so that\nTi\n(A, C) = CVATi\nTi\n(D, B) = CVATi\n) Money conservation until default:\n(A, C) = DVAt\n(D, B) = DVAt\nfor all t < B\n C\n.\nThe penta-lateral case where a CCP provides a clearing service is described in Fig.\n2. If the CCP accepts segregated collateral posted at custodian accounts for variation\nmargin this case is economically equivalent to the quadri-lateral case above. In case the\nCCP insists on receiving variation margin in cash instead (as is the case for instance\nwith the LCH) then one requires an additional intermediary that provides a collateral\ntransformation service, i. e., issues a revolving line of credit backed by the segregated\ncollateral.\n3 Inconsistent structures for uncollateralised trans-\nactions\nPrior to FAS 156-157, standard structuring of counterparty credit revolved around incon-\nsistent formulas that did not satisfy the conditions in the previous section. The standard\nwas to consider the unilateral CVA defined as follows:\n(B, C) = Et\ne- C\nt\nrsds(MC\n(C))-(1 - RC\n(C)) , t < C\nwhile the UDVA term was set to zero. In this case, the discounted martingale condition\n) is satisfied by construction. The risk-free close-out rule (C1\n) is also satisfied since,\nin case B\n< C\n, we have that\nUCVAB\n(C, B) = (1 - RB\n(B))(MB\n(C, B) = 0. By the same token, also condition (C2\n) is trivially satisfied as\nthe UDVA is zero. However, the money conservation condition (B1\n) is not satisfied in\nthis case.\nAfter FAS 156-157, the standard changed to include the UDVA, i. e.\n(B, C) = UCVAt\nand accordingly B  C. This modified definition satisfies condition (B1\n) but compromises\nthe validity of (C1\n) as the DVA term is now non-zero.\nNotice that the close-out condition (C1\n) fails because of a mismatch equal to\nUDVAB\n(C, B) between the right hand sides of equation (3.2) and equation (2.7).\nIn 2009, the ISDA introduced the replacement close-out condition in (C2\n) with the\nintent to replace the risk-free close-out condition (C1\n) that prevailed until then, thus\nreducing the mismatch to\n(B)) (MB\n(C, B))+ - (MB\nNotice however that this mismatch is still non-zero and the accounting inconsistency was\nnot entirely eliminated: the impact of the loss of DVA upon default was reduced by a\nfactor equal to the loss-given-default 1-RB\n(B), but still this loss was not properly valued\nand accounted for.\nBesides all being plagued by one inconsistency or another, these three heritage struc-\ntures have the following characteristics:\n(i) Hedgeability:\n\u00ad The UDVA terms are problematic as hedging their variation would involve a\nparty selling protection on itself, an impossible feat. The practice of hedging\nby proxying, namely selling protection on a name that is strongly correlated,\ncan partly reduce spread risk but exacerbates jump to default risk and systemic\nrisk. Indeed, if the name on which protection is sold actually defaults, the seller\nwho was hedging her DVA needs to make the protection payment, and this\ncould push the seller herself into a worse credit situation and closer to default.\nFor example, back in 2008, a hypothetical top investment bank that had been\nhighly correlated with Lehman Brothers and who had decided to hedge her\nDVA by selling protection on Lehman would have been in deep troubles. For\ninformal comments on DVA hedging see for example Brigo (2011).\n\u00ad The UCVA variability instead can in principle be hedged, assuming the ability\nto accurately value sensitivities and to assess gap risk. For an example on the\nassessment of the pricing component of gap risk see for example Brigo et al.\n(ii) Numerical complexity: Valuing the UCVA involves modeling only one credit dynam-\nically along with all market factors affecting the derivative portfolio. The UCVA is\nnot sensitive to credit correlations, unless the underlying portfolio contains credit\ninstruments. In particular, UCVA is not sensitive to default correlation between B\nand C. However, the UCVA is sensitive to credit-market correlations.\n(iii) Portability: The structures with replacement close-out are relatively more portable\nthan the structures with risk-free close-out. However, since there is a mismatch in\ncondition (C2\n) and the loss of UDVA is not correctly priced and hedged dynami-\ncally, a novation transaction in case of default involves a net unhedged loss for the\nsurviving party.\n(iv) Induced behaviour: As the credit of one party deteriorates, its UDVA raises and the\nparty can realise a gain. On the other hand, as the credit of one party improves,\nits UDVA lowers and the party needs to realise a balance sheet loss. This effect\nrewards credit degradation and is an incentive on banks not to have a top credit\nrating as achieving a high rating would force to realise accounting losses.\n(v) Macro economic impact: The forced mutual sale of default protection embedded in\nall derivative transactions, implicit in the CVA and DVA practices, is a mechanism\nto transfer wealth from the equity holders of profitable companies with good credit\nto the bond holders of companies with bad credit. This is a consequence of the\nearlier point (iv).\n(vi) Bank capitalisation: Substantial bank capital needs to be allocated to UCVA re-\nserves. In absence of collateral capital also needs to be allocated to compensate for\nUCVA volatility which is reflected in the UCVA VaR capital charge in Basel III.\nFinally, there is a third charge against default risk due to the presence of substantial\ngap risk and hedging inefficiencies, as we hinted at above.\nBy definition, the UCVA is the expected loss due to defaults and the loss distribution\nis highly skewed and very fat tailed. Hence, a UCVA provisioning strategy gives\nrisk to systematic small gains for the UCVA desk and occasional large losses which\nare apportioned unexpectedly to banks' treasury departments.\n4 First-to-default CVA\nFirst-to-default clauses appear in Duffie and Huang (1996), Bielecki and Rutkowski (2002)\nand are made explicit for CVA and DVA calculations in Brigo and Capponi (2008), Brigo\nIn the first-to-default bilateral structure, the CVA and DVA are defined as follows:\n(B, C) = FTDDVAt\n(C, B) = Et\ne- C\nt\nrsds(MC\n(C))-(1 - RC\n(C))\nfor all t < C\n, and B  C. If B\n< C\nwe have that FTDCVAB\n(C, B) =\n0. Hence, conditions (C1\n) are actually equivalent in this case and they are both\nsatisfied. (To avoid confusion this claim is not in contradiction with what is stated in\nBrigo and Morini (2011): in Brigo and Morini (2011), the first-to-default bilateral CVA\nis shown to be inconsistent under a replacement closeout rule which is different from the\nrule we consider in this paper, in that the payout is expressed in terms of unilateral DVA).\nThe FTDCVA structure is consistent from a valuation standpoint. Other characteris-\ntics include the following:\n(i) Hedgeability: Unlike the unilateral CVA in the previous section, the first-to-default\nCVA of one entity is sensitive to the entity's own distance to default and decreases\nwith this distance tending to zero in the limit where the entity itself defaults.\nSince the FTDCVA is typically much larger than the FTDDVA of a bank, the\nnon-hedgeability issue is potentially highly problematic, more so than the already\nworrisome unhedgeability of the UDVA in the unilateral case.\n(ii) Numerical complexity: The FTDCVA is sensitive to credit correlations between B\nand C as these have an impact on the first-to-default clause. Hence a fully correlated\ncredit-market simulation is necessary.\n(iii) Portability: The structures are less portable than in the unilateral case with replace-\nment close-out rules as the first-to-default DVA is null in case the default of one\nof the two entities occurs. Hence, a novation against a non-defaulted counterparty\nentails a loss equal to the DVA of the surviving entity.\n(iv) Induced behaviour: As the credit of one party deteriorates and approaches default\nwhile the credit of the counterparty stays stable its FTDCVA goes to zero but not\nits FTDDVA. Hence, the valuation of a derivative transaction raises and ends up\nabove the risk free level. In particular, entities approaching default benefit from\nentering derivative transactions.\n(v) Macro economic impact: The wealth transfer from the equity holders of successful\ncompanies to the bond holders of defaulted entities is more pronounced than in the\nstandard inconsistent structures in the previous section because of the wrong-sign\nsensitivity of the FTDCVA to the credit of the assessing entity.\n(vi) Bank capitalisation: Currently, the Basel III accord insists on using the unilateral\nCVA as a metric to determine capital requirements. The possibly large discrepancy\nbetween the first-to-default CVA and the unilateral CVA is problematic when the\nformer is used for valuation purposes as it generates conflicting priorities for risk\nmanagement. Moreover, the FTDCVA collected from clients is not sufficient to\nprovision UCVA capital.\nIn a hypothetical scenario where the regulators were to endorse the FTDCVA for\nregulatory purposes, banks with higher credit worthiness would be forced to allocate\nmore capital than banks with lower credit worthiness and would be less competitive.\nIn the limit of a bank approaching default capital allocation requirements would\ntend to nil. Finally, as one goes through the credit cycle bank reserve requirements\nwould be anti-cyclical, i. e., lower during recessionary periods in a higher credit\nspread environment and higher otherwise.\n5 Portable CVA\nThe unilateral process UCVA(B, C) does not provide a consistent definition of CVA as it\ndoes not take into account the closeout conditions under neither (C1\n). A way to\navoid this inconsistency is to resort to full fledged bilateral CVA, i. e., the first-to-default\nCVA we have seen earlier. However, we may also eliminate the inconsistency with a less\ndramatic change than going from UCVA to FTDCVA, as follows.\nLet us start with the risk free closeout (C1\n). How can we depart as little as possible\nfrom unilateral CVA while having condition (C1\n) satisfied? Consider equation (2.7) for\n), and notice that it can be rewritten in terms of unilateral CVA, in scenarios where\nB\n< C\n, as\nCVAB\n(C, B) = UCVAB\n(C, B) + DVAB\n(C, B).\nThis holds at time B\n. If we try and write the analogous equation at time t, then we\nobtain the following definition of CVA, which implies that party B subtracts from its fair\nvalue calculation the discounted value of the DVA of C that B would be liable to pay\nupon defaulting, in case B defaults prior to C. We thus introduce the portable CVA as\nthe following process:\n(C, B) := UCVAt\n(C, B) + t\n(C, B), t < B\nwhere\nt\n(C, B) := Et\ne- B\nt\nto satisfy the risk-free close-out condition in (C1\n). The important difference with FTD-\nCVA is that here we have a UCVA term where we do not check who defaults first.\nUnder the replacement close-out, the reasoning is analogous. We start from equation\n(2.9) and add and subtract UCVAB\n(C, B) from the right hand side. We obtain, in\nscenarios where B\n< C\n,\nCVAB\n(C, B) = UCVAB\n(C, B)+ (MB\n(C, B))+-(MB\n(C))+ (1-RB\n(B)).\nAt this point the most obvious version of this equation at time t is obtained as in (5.1)\nwhere, this time,  is defined as\nt\n(C, B) = Et\ne- B\nt\nrudu (MB\n(C, B))+ - (MB\n(C))+ (1 - RB\n(B)) .\nAgain, the important difference with FTDCVA is that here we have a UCVA term where\nwe do not check who defaults first. Similar equations apply to the case B  C.\nOne can double-check that conditions (C1\n) are indeed satisfied because, in\ncase C\n< B\n, we have B\n(C, B) = 0 in both cases, so that\nPDVAB\n(B, C) = UCVAB\nNotice that under both (C1\n) we have that t\n(C, B)  0. Hence,\n(B, C)  UCVAt\nfor all t, the equality being attained only at the stopping time B\n.\nAs a ballpark estimate of order of magnitude and neglecting correlations between credit\nand market risk, the difference t\n(C, B) between the portable CVA and the unilateral CVA\nis equal to the product between UDVA and the probability of default in case the UDVA\nand the default arrival time are uncorrelated. Due to the triangular inequality, in general\nthe difference t\n(C, B) is smaller than this amount. This estimate indicates that the\ndifference t\n(C, B) is relatively immaterial in most circumstances.\nTo conclude, this structuring style has the following properties:\n(i) Hedgeability: The portable CVA is larger than or equal to the unilateral CVA and\nit is equal to the unilateral CVA in two opposite limits: when the entity's credit-\nworthiness tends to infinity (i. e., in the non-defaultable limit) and when the entity\ndefaults. Similarly to the first-to-default bilateral structure FTDCVA, the sensitiv-\nity with respect to the credit of the entity assessing the PCVA could have the wrong\nsign for hedgeability. However, this sensitivity is quantitatively much smaller as it\nderives only from the term t\n(C, B), whose order of magnitude is roughly given by\nthe product between the DV At\n(C, B) and the probability to default before time t.\n(ii) Numerical complexity: The exact evaluation of portable CVA is more complex than\nthe valuation of UCVA as it involves a nested simulation. However, approxima-\ntion schemes can be devised to avoid the nested simulation and marginalise the\ncomputational impact of moving from UCVA to PCVA.\n(iii) Portability: The structure is nearly as portable as the unilateral case with replace-\nment close-out rules as the portable DVA is equal to the UDVA upon counterparty\ndefault and the PDVA of the surviving entity against a novation counterparty does\nnot deviate much from the UDVA.\n(iv) Induced behaviour: The portable CVA and PDVA are slightly larger than the unilat-\neral CVA and UDVA. The incentive to enter into derivative transactions as default\nnears that is caused by the FTDCVA structure is absent in this case.\n(v) Macro economic impact: Similar to the standard case, just marginally better because\nof the consistency from an accounting standpoint.\n(vi) Bank capitalisation: Both the PCVA and the PCVA VaR capital charges are slightly\nmore conservative than those corresponding to the unilateral CVA. As a conse-\nquence, if a bank collects PCVA from a counterparty, then it can use these funds to\nfulfill in full the UCVA capital adequacy obligation.\n6 Collateralised transactions and margin lending\nValuation formulas in the tri-lateral and quadri-lateral cases are not ambiguous as the\nones for the uncollateralised structures above. In fact, the valuation formulas have already\nbeen given as part of the risk neutrality conditions in Section 2.\nThe margin lenders A and D can procure hypothecs on qualifying collateral and place\nit in segregated accounts. A would typically lend to several counterparties C and obtain\nfunding from various investors in tranches ranked by seniority. A tranche is characterised\nby an attachment level L and a hypothec amount N. If in a (small) time interval t\nthe transaction covered by the hypothec suffers losses in excess of L, the investor will\nsustain these losses up to a maximum amount of N. In the quadri-lateral case the fair\npremium (\"CVA tranche spread\") to which an investor of the lender A is entitled is valued\nas follows:\nV (A, L, N) =\ne-\nrsds XA,[L,L+N]\n) - XA,[L,L+N]\n(Ti\n)\ne-\n- Ti\n) N - XA,[L,L+N]\n)\nwhere\nXA,[L,L+N]\n(t) := min\nCA\n(C))-(1 - RC\n, L + N - L\n+\n,\n0  t  T, and C  A denotes that the sum is over all the counterparties served by A. A\nsimilar equation holds for B  C and A  D.\nIn the tri-lateral case where C is insured as opposed to B the formula is different as\nit includes the DVA of B:\nV (A, L, N) =\ne-\nrsds YA,[L,L+N]\n) - YA,[L,L+N]\n(Ti\n)\ne-\n- Ti\n) N - YA,[L,L+N]\n)\nwhere\nYA,[L,L+N]\n(t) := min\nCA\n(-MC\n(B, C))+(1-RC\n, L+N -L\n+\nfor all 0  t  T.\nThe comparison between the case of collateralised transactions with margin lending\nand the previous uncollateralised structures reveals striking differences. In the quadri-\nlateral case we have that:\n(i) Hedgeability: One should distinguish between intra-period hedging and inter-period\nhedging. On an inter-period basis, since collateralised transactions reset, B and C\nare short their own credit. As a consequence, B and C can hedge their inter-period\nvolatility by buying protection on themselves. On an intra-period basis instead,\nB and C are long a protection contract on themselves and this sensitivity is not\nhedgeable. However, the intra-period risk can be reduced by reducing the length of\nthe reset period itself.\nThe margin lenders A and D are exposed to default risk and to gap risk. They can\nhedge default risk by securitisation, while gap risk requires model driven strategies\nto allocate sufficient capital buffers made up of hypothecs and emergency revolving\nlines of credit in case a buffer overshoot event occurs. In the uncollateralised case\ninstead, the ability to securitise is severely limited by the necessity to manage CVA\nvolatility.\nWith collateralised structuring, the market risk caused by changes in fair value\nadverse to C stays with C. Also the risk originating from the volatility of the credit\nspread of C stays with C. The same can be said about B. Only the default risk for\nB and C are transferred to the margin lenders A and D.\nIn a scenario where B is the structuring bank, B is left with replication risk and\nthe risk on its own spread volatility. The two sources of risk are quite separate and\ncan be hedged individually. As we discuss in the next section, the spread volatility\nrisk suffered by B in the course of dynamic replication can actually be eliminated\nin a penta-lateral structure whereby the replication portfolio is cleared within the\nsame netting set of the replication target. In the case of uncollateralised structures\ninstead, CVA hedging is best performed within the trading book, a task which is\nvery complex, delicate and error prone.\n(ii) Numerical complexity: Securitisation requires the joint simulation of credit and\nmarket factors and the calculation of cumulative loss distributions. This task is just\nmarginally more complex than the calculation of first-loss FTDCVA.\n(iii) Portability: collateralised contracts are portable by construction.\n(iv) Induced behaviour: Since B and C are short their own credit, if their credit improves\nthey are rewarded with lower insurance payments while if their credit degrades they\nare subject to higher insurance payments. In particular, in case their credit degrades\nor there is an adverse move in the fair value of the transaction, they have an incentive\nto unwind or otherwise reduce their exposure. This behaviour mitigates systemic\nrisk.\n(v) Macro economic impact: As compared to the uncollateralised structures considered\nabove, the collateralised ones avoid entirely the transfer of wealth from the equity\nholders of successful companies to the debt holders of defaulted companies, thus\nrewarding successful firms.\n(vi) Bank capitalisation: The CVA and CVA VaR charges are avoided entirely because\nthe credit based derivative exposures have been replaced by asset based hypothecs.\nBanks do not need to provision CVA capital and do not need to hedge the CVA\nand DVA. Bank capital requirements are reduced but their counterparty risk is also\nmassively reduced. Systemic risk would only resurface in case of a breakdown in the\nmargin lending market infrastructure, a situation that liquidity provision facilities\ncould be arranged to prevent.\nIn the tri-lateral case, the same remarks apply but with the following few exceptions\nand differences:\n(i) Hedgeability: B still has a long term DVA term that entails an unhedgeable credit\nexposure to the spread of B itself.\n(ii) Numerical complexity: The same considerations in the quadri-lateral case apply here\nalso.\n(iii) Portability: If C defaults, the contract is portable from B's standpoint. If B defaults,\nthe contract is still portable as the DVA on the balance sheet of C is short term\nand it is against the margin lender A, not B.\n(iv) Induced behaviour: B would behave as in the case of unilateral CVA while C would\nbehave as in the case of quadri-lateral margin lending.\n(v) Macro economic impact: If the derivative exposures of buy-side firms were fully col-\nlateralised by tri-lateral margin lending agreements, there would still be no transfer\nof wealth from the equity holders of successful companies to the bond holders of\ndefaulted ones. There would however be a transfer of wealth from successful banks\nto defaulted ones.\n(vi) Bank capitalisation: The same considerations in the quadri-lateral case apply here\nalso.\n7 Derivative replication by defaultable counterpar-\nties\nAn initial analysis of the problem of replication of derivative transactions under collater-\nalisation but without default risk and in a purely classical Black and Scholes framework\nhas recently been considered in Piterbarg (2010). The fundamental impact of collateral-\nisation on default risk and on CVA and DVA has been instead analysed in the already\ncited Brigo et al. (2011) and Brigo et al. (2011). These works look at CVA and DVA\ngap risk under several collateralisation strategies, with or without re-hypothecation, as\na function of the margining frequency, with wrong way risk and with possible instanta-\nneous contagion. Minimum thresholds amounts and minimum transfer amounts are also\nconsidered. The fundamental funding implications in presence of default risk have been\nIn this section, we address this question from the angle adopted in this paper, i. e., we\nanalyse transactions at the structuring level, resolve the defaultability features by express-\ning them as embedded options and ultimately make use of the Fundamental Theorem of\nFinance. The Fundamental Theorem does not assume replicability but makes only the\nmuch weaker hypothesis of absence of arbitrage. However, in the particular case where\nreplication is possible, the valuation does coincide with the cost of replication.\nLet's consider a derivative transaction for which, in case it is struck between two\nnon-defaultable entities, there exists a perfect replication strategy for it. Having made\nthis hypothesis, we then suppose that the same transaction is actually struck between two\nentities which can possibly default, a bank B and a client C, and we ask the question: can\nthe counterparty risk agreement be structured in such a way that the bank has available\na strategy of perfect replication up to the stopping time of first default? If so, what is\nthe cost of replication?\nIf the counterparty credit risk structure is inconsistent as in the three cases in Section\n3, then there are multiple prices for the same payoff and the Fundamental Theorem does\nnot apply. Inconsistent structures are a non-starter as the possibility of replication itself\nis an ill posed question.\nIn the remaining 6 structures discussed above, a fairly priced derivative transaction\nbetween defaultable entities is replicated by a portfolio of transactions between non-\ndefaultable entities. The portfolio includes mutual default protection contracts whose\nvaluation is given by the CVA and DVA. Notice that from this viewpoint, the CVA and\nDVA are not empirical adjustments which invalidate the Fundamental Theorem and thus\nrequire an entirely new theoretical framework for Finance not based on the principle of\narbitrage freedom. From the viewpoint we have adopted, the Fundamental Theorem still\napplies also to the defaultable case, just as long as the CVA and DVA are interpreted\nthemselves as the fair value of financial contracts. Hence, replication is possible if and\nonly if the entire portfolio including the risk-free transactions and the CVA and DVA\nprotection contracts can be replicated by the defaultable entities.\nA necessary condition for replication is that the portfolio containing the risk-free\ntransaction and the CVA and DVA terms for the structurer B can be replicated at least in\nprinciple by a non-defaultable entity. This condition is necessary but not sufficient since\na defaultable entity has at its disposal a reduced set of replication strategies as compared\nto non-defaultable entities. Particularly limiting is the fact that, if B is defaultable, then\nB cannot sell credit protection on itself.\nThe impossibility for an entity to sell protection on itself is a fundamental obstruction\nto replicability that applies in particular to the bilateral first-to-default CVA structure in\nSection 4 and the portable CVA structure in Section 5. In this case, due to the wrong\nsign of the dependency of both the CVA and the DVA on the credit of the structurer, the\ncombined CVA-DVA term cannot be replicated by a defaultable structurer.\nSimilar considerations apply to the tri-lateral structure in Section 6, where the struc-\nturer B is also affected by a DVA term he himself cannot hedge.\nThe quadri-lateral structure in Section 6 does not have an issue with DVA unhedge-\nability. However, unless the replication target and the hedging instruments are covered\nunder a single overarching netting agreement, collateral posting obligations do not net\nand give rise to non-zero carry costs to a defaultable replicating entity.\nTo resolve the netting issue, the structure we can envisage that is most appropriate for\nreplication purposes is a penta-lateral variation to the quadri-lateral structure. See Figure\n2 for an illustration. In the penta-lateral case, the CCP is a central counterparty and B is\na structuring bank that engages in the replication of an exotic derivative custom designed\nfor a particular client C. In case a dynamic replication strategy for the given transaction\nbetween non-defaultable entities exists, then the same strategy is also available to B at\nthe condition that B clears through the same CCP both the exotic derivative transaction\nand the replicating portfolio. In this case, the net value to B of the exotic derivative and\ncorresponding hedges is zero and so is the DVA and the collateral funding cost.\nNotice that:\n\u00b7 B can replicate dynamically only up to the time of its default or the maturity date\nof the transaction,\n\u00b7 the replication cost to B is precisely equal to the risk-free value of the transaction,\neven if B is defaultable and its cost of funding has a non-vanishing spread,\n\u00b7 if counterparty C chooses not to replicate with positions within the same netting\nset, it has a non-vanishing carry cost for the derivative replication strategy due to\ncollateral posting obligations.\nIn case there are hedge slippages, then B may possibly need to post collateral and\nsustain the corresponding cost of carry. Furthermore, a CVA and DVA term will emerge\non the balance sheet of B. The combination of these three effects results in net costs that\nB needs to transfer to the client ex-ante and price it as part of the structuring fee. Once\nreceived, this portion of fee needs to be set aside and provisioned as a risk reserve without\nbeing reflected in the fair valuation of the transaction.\n8 The case of finite liquidity\nThere are two situations that would lead to losses over and above the open mark to\nmarket value at time of default: the case where the fair value process has a jump at time\nof default and the case whereby at least some of the derivative transactions in a netting\nset are not liquid and there is an extended close-out period to novate transactions over\nwhich the fair value may change. In both cases, if C's defaults prior to B the transaction\nmay be novated or unwound by B at time C\nnot at the fair value Mt\n(B) but at the higher\nlevel Mt\n(B) + LC\n(B) where LC\n(B)  0 is a random variable giving the price correction\nderiving from the novation process.\nUnder a risk-free close-out rule, if MC\n(B) > 0, B recovers the amount (1-RC\n(B),\nwhile if MC\n(B) < 0 then B pays this amount to C. Either way, novation costs are non-\nnegative, i. e., LC\n(B)  0. Also, under a replacement close-out, the novation cost is the\nsame.\nIn the case of bilateral transactions, the close-out rules are modified as follows in the\npresence of liquidity corrections:\n) Risk-free close-out rule: If B\n< C\n, then\nVB\n(C) = -(MB\n(C))- + RB\n(B)(MB\n(C))+ - LB\nHere, VB\n(C) is interpreted as the value to C of the transaction at the time when B\ndefaults. Equivalently, we can recast these equations as follows:\nCVAB\n(C, B) = (1 - RB\n(B))(MB\n(C))+ + DVAB\n(C, B) + LB\nSimilar conditions with B  C also hold. Equivalence of the two formulas is ob-\ntained by\n) Replacement close-out rule: If B\n< C\n, then\nVB\n(C) = -(MB\n(C) + DVAB\n(C, B))- + RB\n(B)(MB\n(C) + DVAB\n(C, B))+ - LB\n(C).\nEquivalently, we have that\nCVAB\n(C, B) = (1 - RB\n(B))(MB\n(C) + DVAB\n(C, B))+ + LB\nSimilar conditions with B  C also hold.\nIn multi-lateral structures with margin lending, liquidation costs would typically be\npartially borne by the margin lender up to a pre-assigned haircut level HC\n(B), and\npartly by either the novating party B or the CCP that is responsible for losses in excess\nof MC\n(B) + HC\n(B). Losses in excess of the haircut engender a CVA and DVA term\nwhich tends to zero as the haircut level tends to infinity. To keep things simple, in the\nfollowing formulas we assume that HC\n(B) =  and pretend the margin lender absorbs\nall the losses. Under this simplifying assumption, we have that:\n) Secured quadri-lateral transactions with high frequency resets:\nEt\n[Vt\n(A) + 1t<C <t+t\n(C))(MC\n(C)- + LC\n(C)) + C\n(A, C)] = 0\nand (A, C)  (D, B), for all t < B\n C\n;\n) Secured quadri-lateral transactions with periodic resets: For all t  [Ti\n], the\nCVA satisfies the equation\n(A, C) = Et\n[e- C\nt\n(C))(MC\n(C)- + LC\n(C))]\nand (A, C)  (D, B). Premia are still computed so that\nTi\n(A, C) = CVATi\nand (A, C)  (D, B).\nHaving made these modifications in the close-out conditions, the corrected CVA and\nDVA which account for liquidity gaps are defined accordingly as discounted martingales\nconsistently with the applicable stopping time conditions, i. e., either (8.2), or (8.4) or\nAs an example of how liquidity considerations may impact valuation, consider the case\nof two treasury bonds which, after a given valuation date entail precisely identical future\ncash flows. Suppose also that one of the two bonds is on-the-run and highly liquid while\nthe other bond is off-the-run and illiquid. Suppose that B and C exchange a repurchase\nagreement on a long-short combination in these two bonds, i. e., B has the obligation\nto repurchase the on-the-run bond from C while C has the obligation to repurchase the\noff-the-run bond from B.\nThe framework in this paper allows one to determine the fair value of the transaction\nto either B or C in accordance with the Fundamental Theorem of Finance, i. e., in an\narbitrage free fashion. To do so, one needs to account for the cost of carry of transactions\nof finite liquidity. More specifically, when valueing a transaction one should also specify\nthe time horizon over which the transaction will be held and add the expected carry cost.\nIn case C wishes to value a strategy whereby the transaction is held until maturity or\nuntil either B or C default, the net cost is\nEt\nBC\nt\nEs\n1s<C <s+ds\n(C))LC\nHence, the strategy to holding a direct REPO in an off-the-run bond and an inverse\nREPO in an equivalent on-the-run bond has a positive arbitrage free cost to C. The total\nexpected cost to C is zero if one includes the putative gain that C would make in case\nof its own default. The opposite strategy has a zero cost to B assuming that C posts\ncollateral in full through a margin lender. The strategy of the margin lender has zero fair\nvalue at equilibrium.\n9 Bank funding strategies\nSegregated collateral cannot directly be used as a source of funding for the bank. If\nre-hypothecation was allowed, then the investors would inherit bank credit risk. This is\ninefficient from the clearing standpoint as CCPs require variation margin to be posted\nin cash. It is also inefficient from the point of view of the bank that would favour fully\nfungible cash collateral that can be re-hypothecated.\nBoth problems can be solved by using segregated collateral to secure overnight cash\nREPO agreement of a slightly new kind. See Fig. 4 for an illustration. The upgrade\nstrategy involves re-writing the CSA agreement between B and C in such a way the\ncounterparty C posts segregated collateral to cover both initial and variation margin on\na netting set of OTC transactions with bank B. Furthermore, C writes a `transferable\nnovation guarantee' to B stating that upon the default of B, the counterparty C is obliged\nto settle the variation margin to B in cash.\nThe margin lender A takes up the commitment to post initial and variation margin on\nbehalf of C in segregated form by handing over a hypothec to C which then C transfers\nover to bank B. The hypothec references assets in a pool which are liquidated upon\ndefault of C. The margin lender does not take any bank risk. Upon default of B, the\nmargin lender A still makes available the hypothecs to C so that C can transfer them\nover to another bank during the novation process. The only instance when A liquidates\nassets is when C defaults.\nThe liquidity provider L is asked to provide overnight funding to bank B in an amount\nequal to the variation margin posted by C on any given day. B pays to L funding costs\nappropriate for a fully secured line of credit (i. e., a line of credit not subject to bank\ncredit risk).\nThe overnight funding line by L is secured by two layers of protection: the novation\nguarantee written by the counterparty C and the hypothecs written by the margin lender\nA. To explain why the revolver is fully secured, one needs to analyse various scenarios.\n\u00b7 In case neither the counterparty C nor the bank B default prior to the termination\nof the margin lending contract, then the cash line is renewed overnight every day\nuntil maturity.\n\u00b7 In case the counterparty C defaults prior to maturity and prior to bank B, then\nthe margin lender liquidates assets in the investors' pool in an amount equal to the\nvariation margin and pays L in full. In addition, the margin lender A liquidates\nassets in the pool up to a maximum amount equal to the initial margin in order to\ncover for gap risk and make B whole.\n\u00b7 In case the bank B defaults prior to maturity and not after the counterparty C, then\nthe novation guarantee written by C and held by the liquidity provider L, entitles\nL to demand payment of the variation margin in full from counterparty C. At this\npoint there are two sub-cases:\n\u00ad In case C pays the variation margin in cash as required, then the overnight\ncash line by L is closed with no loss to L and the investors in the margin lender\nA don't suffer losses.\n\u00ad In case C fails to pay the variation margin, then the lender L raises a failure\nto pay condition on C and counterparty C defaults. Since default of C is a\nmateriality condition for the margin lender A and L holds the hypothec, A\nliquidates assets in the investors' pool in amounts sufficient to cover for the\nvariation margin and closes the revolver without losses to the lender L.\nThere are issues about timing that should be carefully accounted for. For instance,\nupon the default of B, the overnight lender L may need to grant a grace period to C in\norder to be refunded of the variation margin in full. In case of bank default, one should\nalso ensure that the margin lending protection is extended beyond the date at which L\nmay potentially have to ask to liquidate the segregated collateral. This is just an example\nof a subtlety due to timings, but we think this sort of mechanics can be nailed down\nwith some work. It is important to notice that the availability of cash collateral allows\nfacilitates clearing at CCPs. In turn, CCP clearing facilitates the novation process and\nstreamlines the recovery of the overnight cash line by the liquidity provider and decreases\nthe probability that a bank default could trigger a counterparty default.\nIn conclusion, a bank can benefit from having segregated collateral posted to cover\nvariation margin for funding purposes. The presence of these assets would allow the bank\naccess to low cost cash funding at fully secured rates, i. e., rates that are indifferent to the\nbank's own credit spread and unsecured funding costs.\nWe have reviewed 10 different structuring styles for counterparty credit risk sensitive\ntransactions. In our analysis, we reduce to the Fundamental Theorem of Finance by\ninterpreting the CVA and DVA terms as prices of embedded contractual obligations con-\ntingent to the event of default. As such, the various different definitions of CVA and DVA\nare precisely identified as corresponding to different contractual structures.\nFigure 4: Upgrade scheme of segregated collateral into overnight cash.\nIn the past two decades, financial markets witnessed the implementation of three\nseparate standards. The evolution of these standards was driven by a desire to achieve a\nconsistent valuation, an objective still not fully achieved in Basel III regulatory documents\nand ISDA Master Agreements. The current standard is also plagued by various paradoxes\nrelated to DVA accounting which encourages anti-economical behaviour. Moreover, these\nparadoxes place an insurmountable limitation to the ability of replicating dynamically the\nprice process of derivative transactions, an impossibility that hampers the role of banks\nas financial intermediaries.\nThe first proposal for a consistent valuation framework for CVA and DVA involves\nincluding a first-to-default clause in default protection contracts. This modification of the\nstandard however represents a substantial deviation from the unilateral CVA specification\nin Basel III. To remedy in part, we introduce a new notion of portable CVA which is\nconsistent and also very close to unilateral CVA.\nWe next consider three structures based on margin lending and full collateralisation.\nWe conclude that the quadri-lateral structure whereby two margin lenders provide hy-\npothecs to ensure full collateralisation at all times to cover the open mark-to-market of\nderivative transactions is promising. These structures do not require a bank to carry out\nCVA trading as market risk and counterparty spread risk are transferred to the coun-\nterparty. Pure default risk is retained by the margin lenders that can securitise it in a\nstraightforward fashion without being hampered by CVA volatility.\nFinally, we consider the problem of dynamic replication for derivative transactions\nbetween defaultable entities. We introduce a penta-lateral structure which is a variation\nof the quadri-lateral structure above with the addition of a central counterparty. In the\npenta-lateral case, we conclude that, if a replication strategy between non-defaultable\nentities exists, then this strategy can be implemented also by a defaultable structurer\nuntil its default time and the cost of replication is the risk-free fair value, independently\nof the credit quality of the structurer.\nFor more detailed references on consistent global valuation, on DVA accounting con-\ntroversies, on Basel III, on the ISDA Master agreements and closeout protocols, on Col-\nlateralisation, Wrong Way Risk, Gap risk, DVA hedging, the first-to-default clause, and\nexamples across asset classes we refer to the CVA FAQ Brigo (2011).\nA Probabilistic Framework and Absence of Arbitrage\nWe denote by B\nand C\nrespectively the default times of the bank and counterparty. We\nfix the portfolio time horizon T  R+, in that all default-free cash flows will be assumed to\nbe zero after T, and fix the risk neutral pricing model (, G, Q), with a filtration (Gt\n)tR+\nsuch that B\nand C\nare G-stopping times. Given that all cash flows go to zero after\nT, we can limit ourselves to the finite stopping times min{B\n, T} and min{C\n, T} for all\npractical purposes.\nWe denote by Et\nthe conditional expectation under Q given Gt\n, and by Ei\nthe condi-\ntional expectation under Q given the stopped filtration Gi\n. We exclude the possibility of\nsimultaneous defaults, assuming that Q(B\n= C\nThe pivotal theoretical result for asset valuation is the Fundamental Theorem of Fi-\nnance, formulated in 1931 by Bruno de Finetti de Finetti (1931), see also Albanese and Li\n(2009) for a modern account. The mathematical expression of the principle of arbitrage\nfreedom can be stated as a set of linear inequalities. The Fundamental Theorem indi-\ncates how to find all solutions to these equations and how to express them via transition\nprobabilities which can be estimated, or implied, from market prices. This framework\nhas been formulated under a discrete setup, and the notions of replication and hedging\nstrategy play no role in the related characterisation of arbitrage freedom. The evolution\nof this result has been considered for example by Dalang, Morton, and Willinger (1990),\nup to the most modern results on arbitrage free theory such as Delbaen and Schacher-\nmayer (1994). It is debatable whether the continuous framework is really needed or adds\nclarity for a realistic representation of no arbitrage conditions in actual markets, see also\nAlbanese and Li (2009) and Albanese, Gimonet, and White (2010) for a related discus-\nsion. Nonetheless, for the mainstream purposes of this paper, we stick to the standard\ncontinuous time version of arbitrage freedom as formulated for example in Harrison and\nKreps (1979) and Harrison and Pliska (1981), and specialised to the credit context in\nBielecki and Rutkowski (2002), to which we refer for more details on arbitrage freedom\nunder default risk.\nReferences\nAlbanese, C., T.
