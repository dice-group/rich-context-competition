    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis multiple case study explored early childhood educators' implementation of a suite of play-based mathematics activities\nwith children aged 3 to 5 years in six different early childhood education and care programs in Melbourne, Australia.\nEducators approached the enactment of the activities differently; however, those educators who used the activities reasonably\nfrequently and with attention to the underpinning mathematical concepts reported an increase in their self-confidence in\nsupporting children's mathematical thinking. For these educators, increasing self-confidence, in conjunction with children's\nenthusiasm, led to increased frequency and further gains in self-confidence. Some educators did not implement the activities\nand no change in attitude was observed. New ways to support early childhood mathematics teaching practice, as a means to\nchallenge entrenched attitudes and beliefs, are needed.\n",

In the context of early childhood educa-\ntion, this influence occurs very early in a child's learning tra-\njectory and thus potentially affects children's perception of\ntheir own abilities as they continue into formal school-based\neducation (Lake & Kelly, 2014; Tschannen-Moran &\nMuch of an educator's attitude toward teaching mathe-\nmatics derives from memories and experiences relating to\ntheir own mathematics learning, and is likely to influence\ntheir teaching practice in some way (Brown, 2005).\nDescribing the \"framing\" function of cognitive schemas,\nBruner (1990) states that the prominent aspect of a memory\nis often the attitude attached to that memory. Educators'\nbeliefs have been defined as \"tacit, often unconsciously held\nassumptions about students, classrooms, and the academic\nmaterial to be taught\" (Kagan, 1992, p. 65), which are stable,\nresistant to change, and manifest in their pedagogical prac-\ntice. Changing beliefs and attitudes requires an individual to\nmake personal, cognitive adjustments to incorporate new\nideas. This is particularly difficult in the teaching environ-\nment if the changes do not align with the individual's per-\nsonal beliefs and goals for children's learning (Curby et al.,\n2009). The resistance may be a personal response to negative\nmemories rather than denial that supporting children's math-\nematical thinking is in children's interests (Ginsburg, Lee, &\nBoyd, 2008). This is important, because studies have found a\nconnection between educators' attitudes to mathematics and\nthe attitudes of their students to mathematics (Bellock et al.,\nChanges in recent years in early childhood education in\nAustralia have resulted in educators being mandated to imple-\nment a recognized early years learning framework (Australian\nChildren's Education and Care QualityAuthority [ACECQA],\n2011). This requires educators to support children's mathe-\nmatical thinking and their acquisition of mathematical lan-\nguage. A significant association has been found between the\nfrequency and duration of play-based mathematics activities\n1The University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nCaroline Cohrssen, Melbourne Graduate School of Education, The\nUniversity of Melbourne, 4/100 Leicester Street, Melbourne, Victoria\nEmail: ccoh@unimelb.edu.au\nPlay-Based Mathematics Activities\nas a Resource for Changing Educator\nAttitudes and Practice\nCaroline Cohrssen1, Amelia Church1, and Collette Tayler1\n Keywords\nearly childhood, mathematics, teacher attitudes, teacher beliefs, curriculum, maths talk, play-based mathematics\n2 SAGE Open\nenacted within early childhood programs and children's\nlearning outcomes (Cohrssen, Tayler, & Cloney, 2015).\nHowever, new ideas are inevitably filtered through existing\nconceptual change is difficult. Consequently, some aspects of\neducators' practice remain unaltered (Spillane & Zeuli, 1999;\nStigler & Herbert, 1998). Variability of early childhood prac-\ntitioners' knowledge, attitudes, and professional practices\nleads to inconsistency in fidelity of implementation (Zvoch,\n2009), a situation which is further confounded by variables\nsuch as individual educators' own mathematics knowledge.\nNonetheless, whereas educators' attitudes, beliefs, and confi-\ndence in their mathematics abilities affect the extent to which\nthey intentionally teach mathematical ideas (Lee & Ginsburg,\n2009), educators' confidence is a variable that can be\naddressed by targeted professional learning (Chen, McCray,\nAdams, & Leow, 2014), and changes to teachers' practices,\nwhen observed to contribute to changes in children's learning\noutcomes, have been associated with changes in teachers'\nEducators need to have a clear vision of how curriculum\nmaterials are intended to help children learn and faith that\nthe curriculum materials provided will equip them to sup-\nport students achieving the intended learning objectives;\nfurther, curriculum materials need to support teachers'\nlearning along with children's learning (Drake & Sherin,\n2009). Increased educator self-confidence is likely to be\nassociated with more frequent mathematics talk in early\nchildhood settings. This is important because learning\nmathematical language is an important tool for exploring\nmathematical ideas and the amount of educators' maths talk\nhas been found to be significantly related to growth in chil-\ndren's mathematics knowledge (Klibanoff, Levine,\nHuttenlocher, Vasilyeva, & Hedges, 2006). One of the aims\nof this study--and the focus of this article--was to observe\nthe effect of providing teaching materials in the form of a\nsuite of play-based mathematics activities with clear learn-\ning objectives, step-by-step explanations for the activities,\nand a description of the mathematical thinking that under-\npins each activity, on early childhood (EC) educators' atti-\ntudes toward mathematics in early childhood. We\nanticipated that supporting educators' pedagogical prac-\ntices may contribute to an increase in their self-confidence\nand a more positive attitude toward intentionally support-\ning mathematical thinking during play-based activities.\nMethod\nChanges in children's learning outcomes, observed to be\nassociated with the frequency and duration of the play-based\nactivities presented by the educators in this study, have\nalready been reported (Cohrssen et al., 2015). The aim of this\narticle is to explore the mechanisms at work that contributed\nto the change in teachers' attitudes.\nParticipants\nThis implementation study was positioned within a broader\nlongitudinal study, the E4Kids study (Tayler, Ishimine,\nCleveland, Cloney, & Thorpe, 2013). Potential participants\nwere selected according to room-level Instructional Support\nscores recorded for educators employed at early childhood\neducation and care (ECEC) centers in the state of Victoria\nduring the first round of E4Kids' data collection. For the pur-\npose of this sample, the room that received the lowest\nInstructional Support score using the Classroom Assessment\nScoring System pre-K to K (Pianta, La Paro, & Hamre, 2008)\nwas the start of the \"low\" category and the median score was\nthe start of the \"mid range\" category. Although all room-level\nreadings of Instructional Support were relatively low, for the\nmid range category, the first author contacted one center\nimmediately above the median score, followed by one center\nbelow, repeating this pattern to remain as close to the median\nscore as possible. The room with the maximum Instructional\nSupport score was the start of the \"high\" category. Minimum\nand maximum scores are presented in Table 1.\nMany of the 128 educators involved in the E4Kids study\nin Victoria during the first round of data collection were\nexcluded. Grounds for exclusion included, for example, the\nconsented educator having resigned or retired, the majority\nof the children in the room being aged below 3 years, educa-\ntors were employed at family day care centers1 or sessional\nkindergartens,2 and in one instance, a potential conflict of\ninterest was identified as the lead educator worked with the\nfirst author in a different capacity.\nAfter approaching remaining potential participants by\ntelephone, the first author met with center coordinators and\neducators to describe the study and the implications of par-\nticipating in the study in more detail. Participation consent\nwas then sought at center level and from educators.\nFive participants were female and one was male.\nEducators' qualifications ranged from a 2-year diploma in\nearly childhood services to a master's degree in early child-\nhood education (see Table 2). All participants held full-time\nappointments. The first educator in Room 4 unexpectedly\ntook long leave mid-way through the study; however, the\nassistant educator in the room stepped up immediately to the\nlead role and undertook to continue with the study. None of\nthe participants had attended any post-qualification EC\nmathematics professional learning sessions. A remark made\nby the lead educator in Room 5 illuminates this point:\nTable 1. CLASS Scores (Emotional Support and Instructional\nM SD Median Minimum Maximum Range\nInstructional\nSupport\nEmotional\nSupport\nCohrssen et al. 3\n. . . there's not a lot of professional development for early\nchildhood workers in maths, like you know, at the conference\nthat we went to in June there was none, but there's sessions\nabout literacy, there's sessions about incorporating indigenous\nculture, there's sessions about social emotional development,\nbut there's no sessions about maths or science . . . there's a lot of\nstuff I suppose that they do in early years in primary schools that\nwould relate to us as well.\nPlay-Based Mathematics Activities\nThe play-based mathematics activities included in the study\nwere drawn primarily from the American Navigations Series\nCavanagh, Dacey, Findell, & Small, 2001; Sheffield et al.,\n2002) as no early childhood mathematics curriculum had\nbeen formally validated with young children in Australia.\nAdditional activities that provided play-based number word\nand counting activities more appropriate to an Australian\nearly childhood context were adapted from an additional\nearly years mathematics text (Wright, Stanger, Stafford, &\nMartland, 2006). Activities related to number and opera-\ntions; data collection, organization, and display; and geome-\ntry and algebra. Mathematical concepts underpinning the\nactivity were described in each case, and clear learning\nobjectives facilitated formative assessment of children's\nunderstanding.\nActivities explicitly encouraged educators to talk about\nthe activity and to encourage children's problem solving,\nexperimentation, and investigation, for example,\nTalk about how the patterns are different and how they are the\nsame\nand\nWhen children are about to place their card on the washing line,\nask questions such as \"Is it before or after this number?\" and\n\"Which two numbers should it go between?\"\nWith the exception of a teddy bear, as one activity required a\nfamiliar toy to be used in an activity focusing on language of\nlocation, educators were provided with all necessary equip-\nment (from numeral cards to clothes pegs), an instruction\nmanual that described the delivery of each activity, including\nlearning objectives and the mathematical concepts underpin-\nning each activity, and an abbreviated card each educator\ncould keep beside them as a prompt when presenting an\nactivity. Educators were at liberty to implement the activities\nin the order that best suited the broader room curriculum.\nAlthough not \"free play\" activities, the activities were\nplanned, \"playful explorations\" (Yelland, 2001, p. 6), enacted\ninitially as educator guided, small group learning experi-\nences. For example, one counting activity required each\nchild to roll a die, identify the number rolled by subitizing or\ncounting the dots, and count a corresponding number of col-\nored counters from a pile in the center of the table. Players\nthen compared how many counters they had \"won\" and\ntalked about who had \"more than,\" \"less than,\" and \"the\nsame as,\" articulating their reasoning. Some educators spoke\nof playing games with the children and then making the\ngames available to children to use independently. Further\nexamples of the activities are provided in the appendix.\nData\nSelf-reported data were obtained from two sources--\nimplementation logs and semi-structured interviews. Semi-\nstructured interviews with participants at three points over a\n7-month period were audio-recorded, transcribed, and ana-\nlyzed thematically to explore participants' reported imple-\nmentation approach and to gain insight into the participants'\nattitudes at the start and at the end of the study toward play-\nfully yet intentionally teaching mathematical concepts in\ntheir programs.\nFirst-round interview questions were the same for each\neducator. Second-round interviews explored issues raised by\ndifferent educators or observed mid-way through the study.\nThird-round interviews were very similar in content as issues\nraised by most participants were in fact similar.\nAt the start of the study, participants undertook to use one\nactivity each day with a small group of children.

Educators were asked to complete\nthe log after the implementation of an activity noting the\ndate, how many children participated in the activity, how\nlong the activity was sustained, and what changes were\nmade, if any, to the delivery of the activity. The implementa-\ntion logs provided an indication of frequency, duration, and\nfidelity of implementation of the suite of learning activities.\nResults and Discussion\nTable 3 provides a summary of the educators' engage-\nment with the activities and an indication of reported\nself-confidence at various points throughout the project.\nNotable is the relationship between the consistency and fre-\nquency of implementation--that is, engaging small groups\nof children in the activities--and educator attitude toward or\nperception of the merit of the play-based opportunities for\nmathematical thinking. Specifically, those educators who\nused the activities reasonably frequently, intentionally focus-\ning on the underpinning mathematical concepts as set out in\nthe description of each activity, reported an increase in their\nself-confidence in supporting children's mathematical think-\ning. For these educators, increasing self-confidence com-\nbined with the enthusiasm with which children took part in\nthe activities, led to changes in their practice. Activities were\nimplemented more frequently and children's learning was\nobserved. Supported by growing familiarity with the activi-\nties, implementation frequency increased and further gains in\neducators' self-confidence were reported. Educators' reports\nof self-efficacy are also included in the summary, and the\nimplications are considered in the discussion to follow.\nImplementation of Activities\nWide implementation variability, in enactment and fre-\nquency, was observed among participants in this study\ndespite their initial undertakings to present at least one activ-\nity each day to a small group of children. First, we discuss\nlow implementation cases. The discussion will then address\nreports from teachers who implemented the play-based\nactivities with greater frequency and consistency.\nAfter 4 weeks, the educator in Room 1 withdrew from the\nstudy. In this program, the activities (designed to be small\ngroup activities) were presented to groups as large as 17,\nresulting in children spending a lot of time waiting for a turn.\nThe educator selected activities based on perceived ease of\ndelivery, rather than their \"fit\" to children's observed skills\nand understanding. Taking both characteristics of delivery into\naccount, it is not surprising that children's engagement was\nsub-optimal and may have contributed to the teacher's report\nthat the children did not \"respect the equipment\" (see Table 3).\nThere was a change in staff in Room 4. The second educator in\nRoom 4 set up activities in the room after recalling that they\nwere in the storeroom; however, the selection of activities\nappears to have been unsystematic. The educator in Room 5\nrarely implemented the activities and similarly kept them in\nthe storeroom. Finally, the implementation strategy employed\nby the educator in Room 6 cannot be established, as this\nteacher did not complete implementation logs.\nOur attention now turns to the educators in Rooms 2 and\n3, and the first educator in Room 4. These educators took a\nsystematic approach to implementing the activities. In\nRoom 2, activities were used as an add-on to the program\nthroughout the study, however in response to children's\ndemands--and the educator's recognition that the activities\nafforded opportunities for social and emotional learning--\nthe activities were used with increasing frequency. The edu-\ncator reported that she came to see that learning priorities in\nthe broader program were supported by the play-based\nmathematics activities. Consequently, not only were they\nused more frequently, but the educator also deliberately\nrevisited some of the activities that had been presented ear-\nlier in the year:\n. . . not everyone's had the opportunity to do every game . . .\nbecause some are here five days, some are here one day, some\nare two days . . . maybe sometimes it's to give someone else an\nopportunity to do that. Or maybe . . . I thought, \"oh no, I do\nunderstand that a bit better now\" or what the outcome (should\nhave been). (Room 2, Round 3 interview)\nThe educator in Room 3 described uncertainty about how to\ngo about teaching mathematical ideas in her program and\nconsequently enacted the activities with a high degree of\nfidelity; she followed instructions provided for each activity\nclosely. Children's enthusiastic participation in the activities,\ncoupled with the educator's growing confidence and famil-\niarity with the suite of activities resulted in more frequent,\nflexible, and open-ended use of the materials.\nThe first educator in Room 4 incorporated the activities in\nthe program plan from the start of the study, selecting activi-\nties that aligned with children's interests:\nIf the children are really . . . interested in Snakes and Ladders\nand using the dice, so that would be something that comes out,\nand then . . . you can explain to children how you use the dice in\nthat situation and how you use it when you're playing Snakes\nand Ladders . . . (Room 4, Educator 1, exit interview)\nOne activity was set up each week on a designated table in\nthe room. Although each activity involved small groups of\nchildren, the educator usually waited for children to initiate\nthe play at this table and most activities were then teacher\ndirected in their delivery.\nHaving provided a broad brush stroke description of how\neducators approached the incorporation of the suite of activi-\nties in their curricula, the next section narrows our focus to\nCohrssen et al. 5\nTable 3.

I suppose my opinion has changed a little bit, that I didn't\nrealise, I hadn't thought how much they might enjoy it and how\nmuch they're still doing all those things I'm wanting them to do,\nyou know, like the sharing and . . . [interruption] . . . when\nthey're interested in something, often they will put a little bit\nmore effort into that socio-emotional stuff, yeah I will wait for\nmy turn, yeah I will let them have their turn, do you know what\nI mean? Cause I want to have my turn. So yeah, I have found\nthat that's a real positive. (Room 2, Round 2 interview)\nIn addition, the children's response to the activities was\nremarked upon several times during the course of the study:\n. . . they've really enjoyed them . . . you know, it's been\nchallenging for them, and they've enjoyed having the play-\nbased maths . . . yeah, they've enjoyed having the activities.\nCause when I pull out a game, I say, \"I want to play a game,\"\nthey're very eager to do that. Like, a lot of the board-type games,\nand then they will . . . I say, \"Well, we're not gonna fight over\nthis pink card\" or something,3 and they have to agree, yes we\nwon't, because we really want to play the game. (Room 2,\nRound 2 interview)\nExplicit learning objectives focused the educator's observa-\ntions and were used to assess whether children had mastered\nunderpinning mathematical concepts and were ready to\nexplore extension activities, or whether further rehearsal or a\ndrop-back activity would be appropriate. Conversations with\nfamilies were informed by the educator's assessment of the\nextent to which children achieved learning objectives embed-\nded in activities, supporting meaningful conversations with\nfamilies about their children's learning.\nYeah, some have found it easy; others of the same age and same\nskill in counting and making patterns still found that difficult . . .\nthey do sort of patterns in music and we do, like, beading.\nThey've done a lot of patterns and stuff like that, so I thought\nthey had an understanding of patterns, but then sometimes with\nthe clowns like sitting there in front of them, it's almost like . . .\nReported attitude at start of\nstudy\nReported attitude\nat end of study\nImplementation\napproach\neducator\nPositive. \"I feel really good\nabout it . . . it will give us\n. . . a greater understanding\nof some of the language and\nsome of the concepts that\nwe can use.\"\nPositive.

(continued)\nCohrssen et al. 7\nthey didn't realise they know how to do it, you know. They\nthought this is more complicated or something. (Room 2, Round\n2 interview)\nThe educator in Room 3 spoke of increasing self-confi-\ndence and excitement at her growing ability to observe,\nassess, and support children's learning by using the learn-\ning objectives for each activity to assess children's under-\nstanding. Encouraged to persevere by the children's positive\nresponse to the games, this educator described having pre-\nviously over- or underestimated different children's\ncompetency.\nI've got one child who has been in care [child care] since she\nwas a baby five days a week, and very proactive at home, very\nproactive here. Whenever we do any of these activities, she\nknows straight away. I watched her the other day. She goes,\n\"You've added an extra two there.\" She was explaining it to one\nof the other children, because they couldn't quite figure it out.\nShe goes, \"Well, you've added an extra two, so that makes six.\"\nAnd I'm just looking at her . . . And then we did the patterning,\nand straight away, after, I said, \"You can come up with your own\npattern and picture,\" she was the first one to sit there, put all the\npieces together, figured out her pattern, drew it up, and said, \"It\nreminds me of a mouse\" and then continued pattern making.\n(Room 3, Round 1 interview)\nBut also the children are the ones who are driving it, because\nthey have particular games in there that they love, so they won't\nlet me do the other ones. (Room 3, Round 2 interview)\nAt the start of the study, the first educator in Room 4\ndescribed intentionally using learning objectives to assess\nchildren's mathematical understanding as a new approach:\nWriting down all that--how they went and what happened and\nall that--and observing all that is more what we normally do.\n(Teacher 1, Room 4, Round 1 interview)\nThis issue was pursued at the second (exit) interview with\nthe first lead educator. It appears that the learning objec-\ntives contributed to formative assessment of children's\nknowledge and using learning objectives to support written\nobservations demonstrates a shift in this educator's teach-\ning practice:\nAt times, yeah, at times I did feel, oh I didn't know he could\ndo this, and that kind of helped plan further in the sense how\ncould it be more challenging for that child . . . So would you\nwrite up observations based on what you'd seen from these\nmaths activities? Some of them, yes . . . because we have them\nin daily reflections . . . (Teacher 1, Room 4, Round 2, exit\ninterview)\nThe second lead educator in Room 4 reported not having\nused the activities as an opportunity to assess children's\nlearning:\nNo, I didn't personally, but I think . . . Actually I think (the\nassistant) did. Another educator in the room, I think she saw an\nactivity that was happening and some concepts that were being\nused, I think it was the geometry patterns one. (Teacher 2, Room\n4, Round 3 interview)\nThe second lead teacher commented further:\n. . . we thought (some of the activities) would be a bit too\ndifficult in that it would be more one-on-one, like teacher and\nchild, or we didn't really understand what the concept . . . or like\nhow to implement it, or we just didn't get time because we used\nthe same . . . sometimes we use the same activities later on in\neach week . . . we feel that in our room it's just . . . like we'd love\nto do one on one things but it's just too busy in our room to be\nable to sit down and do that with other children . . . (Room 4,\nRound 3 interview)\nIn summary, the educators in Rooms 2 and 3, and the first\neducator in Room 4 remarked that many children's demon-\nstrated skills and understanding either exceeded or, con-\nversely, did not yet meet the educators' expectations, when\nassessed against the learning objectives provided for each\nactivity. It is well established in research and in practice that\nchildren's mathematical understanding varies substantially\nand much may be attributed to environmental stimuli (see,\nRecognizing this variability points to the critical importance\nof authentic and accurate assessment to differentiate learning\nopportunities for children.\nReported Changes in Attitude\nWe now consider how enacting the activities impacted on\neducators' attitudes toward intentionally teaching mathemat-\nics in early childhood. Two participants (Rooms 1 and 2)\nraised concerns about incorporating another element in their\nprograms.\nThe educator in Room 1 withdrew from the study.\nThe educator in Room 2 recognized that incorporating\nthe activities into the program provided opportunities to\nextend children's mathematics learning and social and\nemotional learning. Her attitude underwent a significant\nchange and the activities were enacted more frequently.\nRather than needing to unlearn existing understanding to\nwould have required a significant change in cognitive\nschema, this educator quickly recognized benefits of imple-\nmenting the activities and was open to a more intentional,\nevidence-based approach:\nI think I have definitely been more mindful of the mathematics\nin the children's play because . . . I know that they understand so\nmuch more about it, about numbers now, so we have been able\nto extend a little bit like when we're playing, you know, in\ndifferent . . . (Room 2, Round 3 interview)\n8 SAGE Open\nIt made me more focused and broadened (my) understanding of\ndifferent aspects of maths that can be taught to preschoolers,\nthat's my short answer. (Room 2, Round 3 interview)\nThe educators in Rooms 2 and 3 expressed concerns at the\nstart of the study about using \"the right language.\"\nMathematics language-related uncertainty inhibited their\nself-confidence and consequently their willingness to engage\nchildren in such activities. Using the activities directly\naddressed these concerns, as examples of questions and rel-\nevant language to model were provided with each activity.\nReading the provided step-by-step explanations of each\nactivity was reported to equip the educators with sufficient\nknowledge to feel more confident and consequently, to\nmodel the language in conversations with children. This con-\ntributed to an upward spiral of increasing self-confidence\nand more frequent enactment of the activities and the educa-\ntors' practice changed.\nEchoing Bruner's (1990) statement that it is frequently\nthe attitude attached to a memory that persists, the educator\nin Room 3 reflected on her own mathematics education:\n. . . it was about right and wrong, and if you were wrong, there\nwas a consequence for getting it wrong at school with maths, I\nfound. Or they made it very competitive, you know, who could\nget it quicker could get this, could have this prize, or whatever it\nwas, so that already would put anxiety there about getting it\nright, and then . . . I don't know what everyone else's experience\nis, for me it would be about I just shut down so I wouldn't think\nat all. (Room 3, Round 2 interview)\nThis educator's personal experience of mathematics differed\nsubstantially from the play-based approach in which enact-\nment of the activities demanded, and required, personal\nmemories and deep-seated, learned attitudes toward mathe-\nmatics to be set aside (Bruner, 1990) to learn new ideas\neducator's attitude turned around was remarkable. By the\nend of the study, the conversation was more light-hearted\n(evidenced by her laughter). Rather than focusing on a per-\nceived skills deficit, the educator spoke of improving her\nown skills to influence children's regard for mathematics\npositively:\nYes, I think I don't know enough (about mathematics). (Laughs.)\nAnd also because I don't have that confidence in mathematics as\nwell and I think that's something I need to work on because I'm\ntrying to give something to the next generation, to give them the\ngroundwork and the interest in maths, not just literacy . . . (Room\n3, Round 3 interview)\nA marked change in attitude was apparent at the end of the\nstudy:\nFor me, I think it is because this is not something that I'm going\nto stop now just simply because we've done the study. So to me,\nit's a lifelong journey. And I think well if I take this activity,\nwhere can I take it? Can I take it to something else, or can I keep\nusing it over and over again because it's a useful tool as well for\nassessing where children are also, and helping them with\nnumeracy. I'd like to keep going and see when I've got that extra\ntime that I can make to work on it, what will the difference be for\nme as a teacher as well? And then for the children, what will\nhappen? (Room 3, Round 3 interview)\nThe educators in Rooms 4 and 5 waited for children to initi-\nate interactions around the activity or request an activity--\nalthough the activities were not always accessible to the\nchildren as they were stored in a different room. Their atti-\ntudes remained unchanged throughout the duration of the\nstudy, reflecting their persistent pedagogical beliefs about\nthe role of the early childhood educator. Although all three\neducators in these rooms stated a belief in the importance of\nsupporting children's emerging mathematics skills, none\nbelieved this to include purposeful formative assessment to\nplan systematically to support and extend children's devel-\noping mathematical thinking. Somewhat ironically, both\neducators in Room 4 were observed to engage in highly\nteacher-directed, question-and-answer interaction patterns,\nthus creating or perpetuating the pressure for children \"to get\nit right,\" an approach that both educators reported intending\nto avoid. Research has demonstrated that educators filter\nnew ideas through existing knowledge (Curby et al., 2009;\nKagan, 1992) and when exposed to new ideas, are inclined to\nfocus on superficial similarities to familiar knowledge and\nunlearning may be required to gain new knowledge (Snider,\nnot always successful and practice may not change (Spillane\nchoosing to join in with children's play only when requested,\nrather than guiding children's use of the play-based activities\nin a purposeful manner, these educators limited their oppor-\ntunities to observe the gains in children's learning that when\ncoupled with a change in teaching practice, contribute to\nchanges in teachers' beliefs and attitudes (Guskey, 2002a,\nThe educator in Room 6 did not provide implementation\nlogs, but reported in interviews that using the activities\nprompted her awareness that she did not lack the necessary\nskills and understanding to deliver the resources. This aware-\nness proved empowering, and her anxiety at the start of the\nstudy was reportedly replaced by an increasing sense of\nself-confidence.\nConclusion\nEarly childhood educators have reported a need for increased\nprofessional learning in early childhood mathematics\n(Barber, Cohrssen, & Church, 2014). We know that educa-\ntors' mathematics content knowledge predicts children's\nlearning and engagement in mathematical thinking (Hill,\nCohrssen et al. 9\nFurthermore, educators' attitudes, beliefs, and confidence\nimpact on how mathematics teaching is (or is not) purpose-\nfully incorporated in early childhood programs (Lee &\nthat educators' confidence can be addressed by targeted pro-\nfessional learning. In this study, we observed the impact of\nimplementing play-based mathematics activities with small\ngroups of children on some early childhood educators'confi-\ndence, beliefs, and attitudes toward purposefully teaching\nmathematics in early childhood.\nWhen educators persevered with play-based activities\nthat clearly set out the intended mathematics learning and\nprovided examples of questions for teachers to ask to suit\nchildren's emerging understanding, their confidence\nincreased. It appeared that this was a collaborative and itera-\ntive process: reviewing the objectives of each activity famil-\niarized the educators with the underpinning mathematical\nideas and supported their ability to recognize when children\nachieved the learning objectives. As their confidence grew,\nand spurred on by children's enthusiastic response and\nobserved learning gains, activities were enacted more fre-\nquently. When the suite of activities was enacted with rea-\nsonable fidelity and frequency, children's made gains in\nProfessional learning and change in teacher practice,\nwhen observed to contribute to change in children's learn-\ning outcomes, contributes to change in teacher attitudes and\nmented the activities systematically reported a change in\nattitude and beliefs, as the activities-as-resource (a) demon-\nstrated opportunities for supporting social and emotional\nlearning, (b) provided educators with the explicit language\nto both enact the activities and to share the aims of this\nplay-based learning with children's families, (c) equipped\neducators with strategies to facilitate children's learning by\nproviding greater specificity in learning objectives, which\nsubsequently (d) supported gains in children's learning\n(Cohrssen et al., 2015), and (e) facilitated formative assess-\nment of and for learning.\nAlthough the suite of activities was not designed as a pro-\nfessional development resource per se, providing educators\nwith information about specific mathematical concepts as\nwell as step-by-step instructions for the implementation of\nthe games, in effect supported the educators' professional\nlearning. Those educators who implemented the activities\nchanged their teaching practice. When the learning objec-\ntives were used to support formative assessment of children's\nknowledge, educators observed the efficacy of their practice.\nThis positive outcome, coupled with children's observed\nenthusiasm in taking part in the activities encouraged educa-\ntors to change their beliefs and to offer further activities from\nthe provided suite of activities.\nIncreasingly positive attitudes to the activities and greater\nself-confidence led to more frequent use of the activities, and\nthus more systematic implementation. Importantly, an\nincrease in educators' self-confidence in teaching mathemat-\nics is likely to lead to educators modeling positive attitudes\nabout mathematics to children, encouraging children to feel\npositive about mathematics (Kalder & Lesik, 2011).\nChildren's positive responses to educators initiating these\nactivities encouraged educators to persevere, and thus, the\ncycle of teaching and learning continued.\nFamiliarity with the learning objectives of activities and\nincreased self-confidence enable educators to approach the\nactivities in a more purposeful manner, facilitating the\nlearning in play-based learning, reflecting an imperative in\neffective early childhood education (ACECQA, 2011;\nCohrssen, Church, Ishimine, & Tayler, 2013; Department\nof Education Employment and Workplace Relations,\n2009). Specific learning objectives also provided educa-\ntors with competencies against which to assess children's\ndeveloping understanding in an objective manner. This in\nturn facilitated accurate, evidence-based teaching. In short,\nby providing a range of play-based activities that were rel-\nevant and interesting to the children, along with accompa-\nnying instructions, prompts, and suggestions for extending\nactivities, educators were better equipped to enact child-\ncentered practice.\nThe over-arching goal of early childhood education is\nto provide optimal learning opportunities for children.\nImplementation of a suite of play-based early childhood\nmathematics activities provided early childhood educa-\ntors with the resources needed to support and extend pre-\nschool children's mathematical thinking and mathematical\nlanguage. Implicit in this process is ongoing formative\nassessment of children's learning. This not only enables\neducators to tailor learning experiences to support chil-\ndren's demonstrated interests and skills but also provides\neducators with regular feedback on the efficacy of their\nefforts, increasing the likelihood that they will persevere\nwith the new practices and contributing to a change in\nteacher beliefs regarding early childhood mathematics\nOur findings show that the provision and enactment of\na purposefully designed suite of play-based mathematics\nactivities may enable educators to develop increasing con-\nfidence in the intentional teaching of mathematics in early\nlearning environments. This is encouraging evidence of\nthe potential impact of an evidence-based, play-based, val-\nidated early childhood mathematics curriculum. Finding\nways to challenge educators' beliefs and to encourage new\nways of thinking about mathematics teaching and learning\nare crucial if educators are to meet the demands of early\nchildhood education and the future learning needs of\nchildren.\nAppendix\nExcerpt From Instruction Manual\nAppendix (continued)\nAppendix (continued)\nAuthors' Note\nE4Kids was led by Professor Collette Tayler at the Melbourne\nGraduate School of Education, The University of Melbourne, in\npartnership with Queensland University of Technology.\n"
