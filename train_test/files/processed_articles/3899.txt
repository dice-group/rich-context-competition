BCR-ABL\nconfers cells with a survival advantage due to the continu-\nous activation of many downstream signaling pathways\nincluding the signal transducer and activator transcription\n(STAT) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathways,\nrendering cells resistant to apoptosis.\nThe PI3Ks are a family oflipid kinases that catalyze the\nphosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the 30-hydroxyl\ngroup. A critical product of this reaction is phosphatidylino-\nsitol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a vital second messenger,\nwhich recruits downstream signaling proteins including\nAKT and the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1\n(PDK1).1Earlier studies have indicated that the treatment of\ncells with emodin negatively affects the PI3K/AKT signal-\ning cascade.2 The PI3K signal transduction pathway has\nbeen investigated extensively for its role in oncogenic\ntransformation and in the prevention of apoptosis.3-5 The\nfact that AKT overexpression is found in many human\ncancers, that active AKT promotes resistance to chemo- and\nradiotherapy, and that AKT activity is sufficient to block\napoptosis induced by a number of death stimuli has resulted\nin intensive studies on the role of AKT as a mediator of the\nPI3K survival signal. These observations suggest that the\ninhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway might be therapeuti-\ncally important for cancer patients.\nEmodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is a\nnatural anthraquinone derivative isolated from Rheum pal-\nmatum L. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that\nemodin possesses various biological functions, such as anti-\nbacterial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer, and is a potent\ninhibitor of casein kinase 2.

The\nresults demonstrated that emodin can trigger apoptosis\nthrough the inhibition of PI3K/AKT level, upregulating the\nexpression of PTEN and deleting BCR-ABL.\nMaterials and Methods\nReagents and Antibodies\nEmodin (purity >98%) was purchased from Calbiochem Inc\n(San Diego, CA) and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide\n(DMSO; Sigma, Shanghai, China). Antibodies against\nc-ABL (C-19), PI3K, AKT, and PTEN were from Santa\nCruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal\nantibody against actin was from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis,\nMO).Anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and anti-rabbit immu-\nnoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies\nwere from Pierce Biotechnology (Rockford, IL). Trizol\nreagent was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).\nCell Culture\nChronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells were obtained from\nthe Cell Bank of Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry & Cell\nBiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and grown in\nRPMI1640 culture medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) contain-\ning 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 100 U/mL\nbenzyl penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin in a regular\nCell Viability Assay\nmide (MTT; Sigma) was used to determine cell survival in\na quantitative colorimetric assay. Cells were plated in\n96-well tissue culture plates and allowed to attach for 24\nhours. Cells were then incubated with fresh medium con-\nhours, respectively. Twenty microliters of MTT (5 mg/mL)\nwas added to the culture medium 4 hours before harvesting.\nThe medium was then aspirated carefully without disturb-\ning the blue formazan crystals. Then 150 \u00b5L DMSO was\nadded to each well to dissolve the formazan crystals while\nslightly agitating the cells on an automated shaker. The\nabsorbance of the suspension was measured spectrophoto-\nmetrically at 490 nm by a Benchmark microtiter plate reader\n(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The results were\nexpressed as a percentage of the absorbance present in\ntreated cells compared to control cells.

After treatment, the cells\nwere harvested for total protein extraction. Protein con-\ncentration was then determined using the Bradford\nmethod. For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of pro-\ntein were loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels\nwere equilibrated in transfer buffer (50 mM Tris, 40 mM\nphoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore).\nThe membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST\n0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with spe-\ncific primary antibodies at 1:500 dilution (antibodies\nagainst c-ABL [C-19], PI3K, AKT, and PTEN). After\nwashing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with\nhorseradish peroxidase\u00adconjugated secondary antibodies\nvisualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detec-\ntion kit (ECL kit, GE Healthcare).\nNude Mouse Xenograft Model\nBALB/c nude mice were bred at the animal facility of Chong\nQing Medical University. The mice were housed in barrier\nfacilities with a 12-hour light-dark cycle, with food and water\navailable ad libitum. Transplantable tumors (induced by K562\ncells subcutaneous inoculation of a mixture of 2 \u00d7 107 actively\nthe dorsal side of each nude mouse) were chopped into frag-\nments (about 1.5 mm3), each of which was transplanted into\nthe right or left axillary fossa of 25 nude mice. Palpable\ndays and the mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (with\nmg/kg groups and HU120mg/kggroup. The negative control\ngroup received 0.9% normal saline containing 1% DMSO.All\nof these drugs were injected intraperitoneally every day up to\n12 days. Tumor size was measured once every 2 days in 2\nperpendiculars, and tumor volume (TV) was calculated using\nthe formula: (ab2)/2, where a and b refer to the longer and\nshorter dimensions, respectively. The body weight of the ani-\nmals was measured 3 times a week at the same time as the\ntumor dimension measurement and the mortality was moni-\ntored daily. The tumor growth inhibition rate was calculated\nusing the following formula: inhibition rate (%) = (mean\ntumor weight of negative control group - mean tumor weight\nof treatment group)/mean tumor weight of negative control\ngroup. This experiment was conducted in accordance with the\nguideline issued by the State Food and Drug Administration\n(SFDA of China). The animals were housed and cared in\naccordance with the guidelines established by the National\nScience Council of Republic China.\nHistopathological Analysis\nTumor tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, paraffin\nembedded, cut into 4-\u00b5m sections that were placed on glass\nslides, stained with hematoxylin/eosin, and these sections\nwere reviewed under optical microscope.\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)\nAnalysis of K562 Cell Apoptosis In Vivo\nTEM studies were performed as described earlier.11 In brief,\nsmall pieces of tumor tissue (1 mm3) from control and treated\nmice were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaral-\ndehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 4 hours\nat room temperature (24\u00b0C).This was followed by washing the\ntissue pieces in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and\nthen placing them in 2% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M sodium\nphosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 hours at room temperature.\nDehydration was done in an ascending grade of ethanol, fol-\nlowed by embedding in Epon 812 and polymerization at 60\u00b0C\nusing an Ultracut Ultra microtome (Leica Microsystems\nGmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) and picked up onto 200-mesh cop-\nper grids. The sections were double stained with uranyl acetate\nand lead citrate, and then analyzed under an FEI Tecnai-12\ntwin transmission electron microscope equipped with an SIS\nMega View II CCD camera at 80 kV (FEI Co, Hillsboro, OR).\nWestern Blot Analysis In Vivo\nPBS and minced into small pieces using bistouries.

Total RNA was isolated from\nhomogenate using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,\nCA). The next steps are in line with the aforementioned.\nStatistical Analysis\nIn vitro, all experiments were performed at least 3 times, and\nresults are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error (SE), unless\notherwise stated. GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad\nSoftware, San Diego, CA) was used for statistical analysis.\nComparisons between 2 groups involved 2-sided Student's\nttest, and comparisons among multiple groups involved 1-way\nANOVA with post hoc intergroup comparison using Tukey\ntest. P< .05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults\nEmodin Inhibits K562 Cell Viability In Vitro\nTo investigate the inhibitory effect of emodin on K562\ncells, MTT assay was used to quantify the effect of emodin\non K562 cell growth. Through pre-experiment, we deter-\nmined the time interval in the MTT experiment (data not\nshown). As shown in Figure 1A and B, emodin caused a\ndecrease of cell viability in K562 cells in a dose- and time-\ndependent manner when compared with the control. DMSO\nalone showed no effect on viability of K562 cells.\nEmodin Induces K562 Cell Division Cycle Arrest\nPhase In Vitro\nThe inhibition by emodin of cell growth was further\ninvestigated with flow cytometric analysis of cellular\nDNA content. As shown in Figure 2A and B, the number\nof cells in the G1\nphase was increased after treatment with\ncentage of cells in the G1\nwhereas it was increased to 66% to 82% after treatment\nalso observed that the cells in the S phase decreased while\nthe concentration of emodin increased. More important,\nwe noted a significant decrease of cells in the S phase\nafter treated with 50 \u00b5mol/L of emodin. As shown in\nFigure 2B, emodin resulted in a dose-dependent inhibi-\ntion of cell cycle. These results suggested that emodin\nhad a prominent ability to inhibit the cell cycle and cause\ncell cycle arrest at the G0\nphase.\nEmodin Causes K562 Cell Morphological\nChanges In Vitro\nUnder control conditions, the untreated K562 cells grew well\nand the skeletons were clear. The cells appeared in a normal\ncircular shape and the nucleoli were evident when observed\nunder optic microscope (Figure 3A) and electron microscope\n(Figure 3C).After treatment with 40 \u00b5mol/Lof emodin for 48\nFigure 1.

In addition,\nmorphological characteristics of apoptosis including cellular\nshrinkage, chromatin margination, condensation, and vacuol-\nization were observed under electron microscope (Figure 3D).\nFigure 2. Cell cycle distributions of emodin-treated K562 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Based on the appearance of\nthe sub-G1\npeak in cell cycle analysis, we further character-\nized the emodin-induced apoptosis by Annexin V/PI dual\nstaining. This assay divided apoptotic cells into 2 stages:\nearly (Annexin V+/PI-) and late apoptotic/necrotic\n(Annexin V+/PI+). As shown in Figure 4A, Annexin V/PI\ndouble-parameter method is a sensitive detection method\nfor apoptosis. The cells stained mainly by Annexin V-FITC\nwere regarded as the early apoptotic cells. Early apoptosis\nemodin for 12 hours, and a concentration gradient was\nshown. The apoptosis rates of treated groups were 8.89%,\n2.09% (Figure 4B). There were statistically significant dif-\nferences between the treated groups and the control group\n(P < .001). In an attempt to further clarify the mechanisms\nunderlying the inhibitory action of emodin on leukemia\ncells, its effect in the induction of apoptosis on human\nchronic myelocytic leukemia K562 cells was determined by\nDNA fragmentation analysis. Emodin-induced apoptosis\nwas found at all tested dosages with 48 hours of incubation.\nThe characteristic apoptotic DNA ladders with multiple\nbands were observed in these drug-treated groups, while no\nsuch DNA ladders were detectable in the negative controls\n(Figure 5). With increased concentrations of emodin, mul-\ntiple bands became more and more clear, which indicated\nthat apoptosis occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Our\nresults indicated that emodin inhibited the growth of\nK562cells, at least in part, by induction of apoptosis.\nEmodin Inhibits Tumor Growth in Nude Mice\nThe results showed that after 12 days of treatment with\nemodin, no significant variation in body weight was\ndetected (data not shown), suggesting that emodin did not\nproduce significant nontumor toxicity in tumor-bearing\nFigure 3. Morphological changes induced by emodin in K562\ncells. K562 cells were seeded in culture bottles and treated\nwithout (A and C) or with 50 \u00b5mol/L emodin (B and D) for\n48 hours. Apoptotic cells (in B) were characterized by cellular\nshrinkage (light microscope, 100\u00d7). Under a transmission\nelectron microscope, the apoptotic cell (in D) was characterized\nby marked condensation and margination of chromatin (5000\u00d7).\nmice. But in the hydroxyurea treatment group, the weight of\nnude mice (data not shown) was significantly lower than in\nthe negative control group, accompanied by the formation\nof cachexia. However, the average weight of tumors (Figure\n1.66 g of negative control tumors, which corresponds to\naddition, the tumor volume of tumors treated with emodin\nand HU also significantly decreased when compared with\nthe nontreated group (Figure 6A and B). These results sug-\ngest that emodin was able to effectively inhibit tumor\ngrowth in vivo, and no obvious side effects were found.\nEffect of Emodin on Transplanted Tumor\nHistology\nThe histopathological changes were observed under optical\nmicroscope. The result showed that a large area of necrosis\nlocated in periphery of tumors was observed in emodin-\ntreated mice but not in normal saline-treated mice. In normal\nsaline-treated mice, tumors with normal demarcation revealed\ncomplete cell shapes with clear cytoplasm and typical nuclei.\nIn contrast, the cell shape was completely destroyed in\nnecrotic tumor tissue derived from emodin-treated mice\n(Figure 7). In the negative control group (Figure 7A), tumor\ncells with normal demarcation revealed complete cell shape\nwith clear cytoplasm and typical nuclei. Tumor cells with\nkaryomegaly and anacheromasis were observed. Abnormal\ndivision of the nucleus and abundant vessels could also be\nfound. The tumor cell growth was active. There was a small\namount of necrotic tissue in the central block of tumor. In the\nlow-dose group (Figure 7B), some cell shape was destroyed in\nnecrotic tumor tissue, and mitotic tumor cells could be found.\nThere were significantly more hemorrhage and necrosis than\nin the control group. A larger number of tumor cells were\napoptotic. In the medium dose group (Figure 7C), several\nmacrophages were approaching to and phagocytosing tumor\ncells, mitotic figures were seen, and necrosis and hemorrhage\nwere found more easily than in the low-dose group (Figure\n7B). In the high-dose group (Figure 7D), the tumor cells with\nabnormal nuclear division decreased; there were some apop-\ntosis and necrosis and fewer vessels. A large area of necrosis\nwas observed easily. Obvious lymphocytic infiltration, deeply\nstained cells, and pyknosis were all observed. In the positive\ncontrol group (Figure 7E), tumor load decreased; some tumor\ncells necrosed and part of these cells were replaced by con-\nnective tissue.\nEmodin Induces K562 Cell Apoptosis In Vivo\nThe morphological features of apoptoticK562 cells in vivo\nwere observed by transmission electron microscopy.\nNegative control group (Figure 8A): the normal tumor cells\nwith abundant euchromatin had large nuclei, and chromatin\nmargination in the clumped K562 cells was little or none.\nTEM studies clearly showed intact mitochondria with the\ndouble membrane clearly visible, cristae structurally intact,\nand intramitochondrial matrix consisting of electron-dense\ngranules. All this indicated rapid cell proliferation. Positive\ncontrol hydroxyurea group (Figure 8E): the main changes\nof most cells are cellular necrosis, swelling, and heterochro-\nmatin margination. The cells with irregular membrane were\nlumping with apoptotic bodies. Macrophages were begin-\nning to phagocytose tumor cells. Cell microvilli were\nreduced or absent; mitochondria and other organelle struc-\nture were unclear; some nuclei were pyknotic or dissolved.\nElectron-dense granules ranging from large to small in size\ncould be seen in some cytoplasm, indicating that cell necro-\nsis was serious. In the low concentration emodin treatment\ngroup (Figure 8B), many karyopycnotic cells and a few\nwith lumping chromatin were found. Chromatin margin-\nation and apoptotic cells were observed. The macrophage\nspine enclosed tumor cells. In the middle concentration\nemodin treatment group (Figure 8C), cytoplasm condensa-\ntion and primary apoptosis were observed. Chromatin mar-\ngination and the apoptotic cell became more common, and\nthe mitochondrial double membrane was absent. The mac-\nrophage spine was enclosing the apoptotic body and was\nbeginning to enclose the tumor cells. In high-concentration\nemodin treatment group (Figure 8D), the cell membrane\nwas destroyed, and obvious karyopycnosis and margination\nwere observed. Apoptotic bodies formed, and macrophages\nbegan to phagocytose the tumor cells. The expansion of\nFigure 5. The effect of emodin on the induction of apoptosis\nin K562 cells was determined using DNA fragmentation analysis.\nDNA was isolated from the cells and analyzed using 2% agarose\ngel electrophoresis with 1 \u00d7 TBE buffer and ethidium bromide\nstaining. The apoptotic characteristic laddering pattern of\nDNA fragments with multiple bands indicated the induction of\napoptosis in emodin-treated cells at various conditions but not\nin the untreated control.

In conclusion, emodin\ncould result in the apoptosis of K562 cells in a dose-depen-\ndent manner in vivo.\nEmodin Decreased the BCR-ABL Level\nTo address the mechanism of the emodin-mediated growth inhi-\nbition in CML cells, we analyzed the expression of BCR-ABL\nin CML cells treated with or without emodin by RT-PCR and\nWestern blotting. Our study showed emodin dose-dependently\ndecreased BCR-ABL level in vitro and in vivo (Figures 9-11).\nEmodin Inhibits PI3K/AKT Level\nEmodin inhibited the PI3K/AKT level, which correlated with\nthe enhancement of emodin-induced apoptosis.AKT has been\ndescribed as a downstream effector of PI3K in a number of\nmodels that involve activation of PI3K in survival signaling.\nWe investigated whether AKT could be inactivated in K562\ncells in response to emodin. To demonstrate that emodin\ninduced apoptosis by repressing the PI3K/AKT survival path-\nway, we measured levels of PI3K and AKT by RT-PCR and\nWestern blotting.As shown in Figures 9 to 11, emodin caused\na decrease of PI3K and AKT in a dose-dependent manner\nEmodin Upgraded PI3K-AKT Signaling Upstream\nof PTEN Gene\nThe tumor suppressor PTEN was originally identified as a\nnegative regulator of PI3K signaling, a main regulator of cell\ngrowth, metabolism, and survival. Yet this function of PTEN\nis extremely relevant for its tumor-suppressive ability, albeit\nthe recent characterization of many PI3K-independent\ntumor-suppressive activities. The phosphatase and tensin\nhomolog deletion on chromosome PTEN was originally dis-\ncovered as a candidate tumor suppressor, mutated and lost in\nvarious cancers.12,13 The major function of PTEN is the buff-\nering of PI3K signaling. The loss and mutation of PTEN in\nvarious cancers lead to hyperactive PI3K signaling. PTEN is\na main player in the regulation of PI3K signaling. As shown\nin Figures 9 to 11, our study showed emodin dose-depend-\nently upgraded PTEN level in vitro and in vivo.\nDiscussion\nThe search for new chemopreventive and antitumor agents\nthat are more effective and less toxic has stimulated great\ninterest in phytochemicals. Emodin, a natural anthraqui-\nnone derivative isolated from Rheum palmatum L, is one\nsuch compound.

But in the\nhydroxyurea treatment group, the weight of nude mice (data\nnot shown) was significantly lower than in the negative\ncontrol group, accompanied by the formation of cachexia.\nAll these results show that emodin is a potentially powerful\nanticancer drug with low toxicity and very few side effects.\nThe poor prognostic outcome of CML is due to its resis-\ntance to current therapies, maintaining it as a leading cause\nof cancer-related death. Successful treatment with chemo-\ntherapeutic agents is largely dependent on their ability to\ntrigger cell death in tumor cells. Therefore, novel inducers\nof apoptosis provide a new therapeutic approach for anti-\ncancer design. Several previous studies have demonstrated\nthat emodin exerts antitumorigenic activity by inducing\napoptosis in cancer cells,14-19 and sensitizes prostate cancer\ncells and gallbladder cancer cells to chemotherapeutic\nagents.20,21 Apoptosis is an important way to maintain cel-\nlular homeostasis between cell division and cell death.22\nApoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is char-\nacterized by a variety of morphological features, including\nchanges in the plasma membrane such as loss of membrane\nasymmetry and attachment, cell shrinkage, chromatin con-\ndensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation, so induc-\ntion of apoptosis in cancer cells is one of the useful strategies\nfor anticancer drug development.23 In this respect, many\nstudies were performed for screening of apoptosis inducing\ncompounds from plants.24-26 In the present study, we found\nthat emodin showed significant antiproliferative activity\nand induction of apoptosis in K562 cells. We demonstrated\nthe inhibition of proliferation of K562 cell growth in vivo\nwith a corresponding reduction the tumor volume and\nweight of xenografted tumor in nude nice with emodin\ntreatment. Preliminarily, we tested the role of emodin in\ninduction of apoptosis by observing cellular morphology\nsuch as nuclear condensation, fragmentation of genomic\nDNA, and Annexin-V binding. Consistent with other stud-\nies, our results showed that there was an induction of apop-\ntosis in K562 cells with emodin treatment. Induction of\napoptosis and/or cell proliferation inhibition is highly cor-\nrelated with the activation of a variety of intracellular sig-\nnaling pathways to arrest the cell cycle in the G1\n, S, or G2\nphase. In malignant tumors, cell population in the G1\nphase\nappears less frequent (<70%) than in normal tissue (>90%).\nThe damage that causes G1\n-check point arrest is believed to\nbe an irreversible process and the cells ultimately undergo\napoptosis. Our data indicated that emodin caused the\nincrease of cells in the G1\nphase in a dose-dependent man-\nner with the decrease of cells in diploid regions (G2\nand S\nphases). Thus, it could be concluded that emodin had the\nability to induce apoptosis in proliferating cells. However,\nthe cells in diploid regions seemed to have accumulated at\nphase before shifting to the sub-diploid region as the\npercentage of cells at the diploid G1\nregion greatly increased\nwith the decrease of cells in the S and G2\nphases.\nThe Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, first identified by\nNowell and Hungerford in 1960, is the cytogenetic hall-\nmark of CML.27 The Ph chromosome is a shortened chro-\nmosome 22 that is a by-product of a reciprocal chromosomal\ntranslocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and\ntranslocation is the replacement of the first exon of the\nFigure 11.

The most commonly occurring form of BCR-ABL is\na 210 kDa oncoprotein that is found in most cases of CML\nand 5% to 10% of adults with acute leukemia. The other 2\nare associated with chronic neutrophilic leukemia and acute\nlymphocytic leukemia, respectively.31 Various studies have\nestablished that the BCR-ABL 210 kDa protein is onco-\ngenic and is essential for the pathogenesis of CML.\nThe PI3Ks are a family oflipid kinases that catalyze the\nphosphorylation of phosphoinositides at the 30-hydroxyl\ngroup. A critical product of this reaction is phosphatidylino-\nsitol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), a vital second messenger,\nwhich recruits downstream signaling proteins including Akt\nand the PDK1.32 PDK1 phosphorylates and activates AKT.\nThe PI3K pathway is frequently upregulated in human\ntumors.33The activation of the PI3K pathway is relatively\nwell understood and is known to be a multistep process\ninvolving the PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of phospho-\nlipids localized at the plasma membrane, and the subse-\nquent membrane localization of PDK1 and Ser/Thr kinase\nAKT (also known as protein kinase B) via their pleckstrin\nhomology (PH) domains. The activation of PI3K ultimately\nActivated AKT controls fundamental cellular processes\nsuch as cell survival by phosphorylating and inactivating\nseveral downstream pro-apoptotic target molecules. The\nfact that AKT overexpression is found in many human can-\ncers, that active AKT promotes resistance to chemo- and\nradiotherapy, and that AKT activity is sufficient to block\napoptosis induced by a number of death stimuli has resulted\nin intensive studies on the role of AKT as a mediator of the\nPI3K survival signal. Elevated levels of phosphorylated\nPI3K/AKT can protect cells from undergoing apoptosis and\ncontribute to drug resistance.34 Therefore, inhibition of the\nPI3K/AKT pathway by pharmacological or genetic\napproaches may improve the response of cancer cells to\nchemotherapy.35As mentioned above, the treatment of cells\nwith emodin alone or in combination with other chemother-\napeutic agents has been shown to effectively counteract\ntumor progression, although the emodin-mediated molecu-\nlar mechanism responsible for this effect remains to be fully\nelucidated. Given the importance of the aforementioned\npathway in the modulation of tumor progression, the aim of\nthe present study was to examine in detail how emodin\naffects the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, leading to a cell\ndeath that biochemically resembles the typical features of\napoptosis. We propose a model that supports the therapeutic\nvalidity of emodin in the treatment of human malignancies\nand other pathological conditions, since the emodin-medi-\nated regulation of components of the PI3K pathway\nupstream of AKT leads to an effective downregulation of\nAKT kinase activity.\nPTEN/PI3K/AKT constitutes an important pathway reg-\nulating the signaling of multiple biological processes such as\napoptosis, metabolism, cell proliferation, and cell growth.\nPTEN is a major lipid 3-phosphatase, which signals down\nthe PI3 kinase/AKT pro-apoptotic pathway. Furthermore,\nPTEN is a protein phosphatase, with the ability to dephos-\nphorylate both serine and threonine residues. The protein-\nphosphatase activity has also been shown to regulate various\ncell-survival pathways, such as the mitogen-activated kinase\n(MAPK) pathway. It is well established that PTEN's lipid-\nphosphatase activity, via the PI3K/AKT pathway, mediates\ngrowth suppression functions.36 Our results demonstrated\nthat emodin can trigger apoptosis throughupregulating the\nexpression of PTEN.\nIn brief, our results provide new insights that emodin can\ntrigger apoptosis through the inhibition of PI3K/AKT level,\nupregulating the expression of PTEN anddeleting BCR-ABL.\nThus, in our findings emodin remarkably showed potent\neffects on the inhibition of K562 cells growth by inducing\napoptosis. These results suggest that emodin may be devel-\noped as a promising chemotherapeutic agent in chronic\nmyelocytic leukemia therapy in the future. The data also\nstrongly support the view of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway\nas an important target for drug discovery.\nAuthors' Note\nAll applicable international, national, and/or institutional guide-\nlines for the care and use of animals were followed.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nstudy was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of\nReferences\n1.
