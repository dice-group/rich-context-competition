Counts in the United\nStates within the last 10 years are hampered by the fact that\nin key data sources, such as the National Child Abuse and\nNeglect Data System and the Federal Bureau of Investiga-\ntion's National Incidence-Based Reporting System, perpetra-\ntors who are youth-serving workers are not specifically cat-\negorized as such, leaving a vacuum of information about this\nproblem.\nPopulation surveys offer another way to develop informa-\ntion on the epidemiology of abuse in YSOs; however, because\ntheseoffensesmaybelesscommonthanabusebyfamilymem-\nbers, large samples may be required to estimate their inci-\ndence. This study uses combined population surveys to cal-\nculate prevalence rates for YSO abuse and compare them with\nfamily and other nonfamily, non-YSO abuse.\nMethods\nThe data for this analysis came from the aggregation of 3\nrepresentative samples of US children: the National Surveys\nof Children's Exposure to Violence, carried out in 2008,\nabout the abuse, crime, and violence experiences of children\nyears were interviewed directly about their experiences,\nwhile information about the experiences of children aged 0\nto 9 years was obtained through interviews with a caregiver.\nDetails of the methodology are provided elsewhere.10-12 All\nprocedures were authorized by the institutional review\nboard of the University of New Hampshire.

The survey participants included youths\naged 10 to 17 years and caregivers of children aged 0 to 9 years.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Items from the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire.\nRESULTS In the combined sample of 13 052 children and youths aged 0 to 17 years, the rate of\nabuse by persons in youth-serving organizations was 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2-0.7) for the past year\nabuse and only 6.4% was any form of sexual violence or assault.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Abuse in youth-serving organizations was a relatively rare\nform of abuse, dwarfed by abuse by family members and other adults.\nSupplemental content at\njamapediatrics.com\nAuthor Affiliations: Crimes Against\nChildren Research Center, University\nof New Hampshire, Durham\n(Shattuck, Finkelhor, Turner);\nSewanee the University of the South,\nSewanee, Tennessee (Hamby).\nCorresponding Author: David\nFinkelhor, PhD, Crimes Against\nChildren Research Center, University\nof New Hampshire, 125 McConnell,\n15 Academic Way, Durham, NH\nResearch\nOriginal Investigation\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

The ques-\ntionnaire items used in this analysis were identical across all\n3 survey administrations except for 2 items that were not pres-\nFor this analysis, only items representing physical\nassault, sexual abuse, verbal aggression, and neglect were\nincluded and only if they were committed by an adult from a\nYSO. Twenty Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire items\nwere used to assess these abuse types (eAppendix in the\nSupplement). Although cases of YSO abuse could come to\nattention in response to any of the 20 questions, the main\nquestions eliciting these cases asked: \"At any time in your\nlife, did a grown-up you know touch your private parts when\nthey shouldn't have or make you touch their private parts?\"\nand \"Did a grown-up you know force you to have sex?\"\n(sexual abuse); \"did a grown-up in your life hit, beat, kick, or\nphysically hurt you in any way?\" (physical abuse); or \"did\nyou get scared or feel really bad because grown-ups in your\nlife called you names, said mean things to you, or said they\ndidn't want you?\" (verbal abuse). Follow-up questions asked\nwho the perpetrator was. The survey definition of YSO\nworker was \"a grown-up (your child/you) know(s) from\nsome organization, such as a teacher, coach, or youth group\nleader.\" The adult's role was not broken down into any more\nspecific categories.\nResults\nThe proportion of children and youths with exposure to any\nThis compares with rates of abuse by any family adult of 11.4%\n6.6) in the past year. The total rate for nonfamily adult, ex-\nBreaking down the lifetime exposures into categories,\nsexual abuse was one of the least frequent categories, occur-\nring in 6.4% of YSO survivors. Verbal abuse was most fre-\nquent, experienced by more than half (63.2%) of YSO survi-\nvors. Physical abuse was reported by 34.6% of survivors.\nMost episodes (67%) occurred at school or daycare. They\nwere spread across the developmental spectrum, occurring\neven among preschool children. Rates were somewhat higher\namong older than younger children. The experience of a YSO\nabuse in general was not disproportionate by sex, racial group,\nor family type, but children who had experienced such abuse\nhad also experienced a higher mean number of adverse events\nin their lifetime (3.3 for YSO survivors compared with 2.0 for\nnon-YSO survivors) (Table). Lifetime adversity was assessed\nusing 15 questions that asked about major adverse events\n(eg, serious unintentional injuries or illnesses involving the\nchild or a family member, parent imprisonment, family drug\nor alcohol problem, and/or parent unemployment).\nDiscussion\nThis analysis of national survey data on maltreatment expo-\nsure suggests that the overall rate of YSO maltreatment is\nmodest; YSO maltreatment is dwarfed by family maltreat-\nment and other categories of nonfamily adult abuse, which\nare comparatively much more common; and sexual abuse in\nYSOs is a small proportion of all YSO abuse and also of all\nsexual abuse. These conclusions are not that surprising\ngiven that most interactions in YSOs occur in the presence of\nmultiple children and often the proximity of other adults. In\naddition, many YSOs have made efforts in recent years to\nimprove training, staff selection, and implement abuse-\nprevention programs.\nHowever,lowcomparativeratesofexposurestoYSOsexual\nabuse in this survey should not be interpreted to mean that\nsuch events are rare in absolute numbers. The rate found in\nthis analysis could translate to a population estimate of 36 000\ndren and youths younger than 18 years, certainly worthy of ad-\nditional prevention efforts. Levels of exposure of this magni-\ntude are difficult to measure precisely, even with large samples\nlike the one aggregated for this analysis. More targeted stud-\nies using cases coming to professional attention, such as the\nNational Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect, may be\nneeded to assess change over time.\nAnother important finding from the study was the de-\ngree to which verbal abuse predominated in reports about YSO\nabuse. The fact that most abuse in YSOs was categorized as\nverbal abuse in this survey is a reminder that this kind of\nmaltreatment can occur in contexts other than the home and\nschool. Much of the current prevention training and screen-\ning within YSOs is oriented toward sexual abuse,16 but YSOs\nmayalsobenefitfromtrainingstaffabouthowtorecognizeand\nprevent verbal abuse. This should include outbursts of anger,\nshaming, and rejecting that can cause psychological harm.\nIn many of the cases of YSO abuse coming to public atten-\ntion, disclosure of abuse has been delayed by dozens of years,\npossibly suggesting that those experiencing abuse are not yet\nwilling to reveal abuse to interviewers or parents who would\npass it on to interviewers. However, it is noteworthy that the\nrates of abuse by family members, another difficult to dis-\nclose form of exposure, were substantially more numerous in\nthis survey.\nKey Points\nQuestion: How many children and youths are abused by staff\nassociated with youth-serving organizations such as schools and\nreligious/recreational groups?\nFindings: The rate of abuse by persons in youth-serving\norganizations was 0.4% for the past year and 0.8% over the\nlifetime. Most of the maltreatment (63.2%) was verbal abuse, and\nonly 6.4% was any form of sexual violence or assault.\nMeaning: Additional attention should be put on psychological\nmaltreatment of children in youth-serving organizations.\nResearch Original Investigation Abuse in Youth-Serving Organizations\n \nDownloaded From: http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

Instead, YSO abuse was were identified using more\ngeneral abuse questions, including some on abuse by adults\nand caregivers, and a follow-up question asking for more spe-\ncifics on perpetrator identity. A more targeted YSO question\nmayhaveelicitedmoreepisodes.Narrativedescriptionsofepi-\nsodes might have also identified more offenders who could\nhave been classified as YSO connected. In addition, perpetra-\ntor identity in our protocol only asked about the most recent\nexperience for children who had more than 1 of that type of\nepisode. This could also mean that some YSO experiences were\nnot counted. This would be less true, however, for the less fre-\nquent kinds of episodes, such as sexual abuse, that tended not\nto have happened with multiple perpetrators.\nConclusions\nThis analysis suggests that maltreatment of children and youth\nin YSOs is a problem, but not nearly as much as maltreatment\nin the family. It is important that publicity about cases that\nTable.
