This question has rarely been investigated, despite the classic book on\nHistorical and Geographical Influences on Psychopathology [6]. It concerns the\nstrength of the relationship between risk factors and offending, not the prevalence,\nlevel or magnitude of risk factors. For example, numerous childhood (age 8\u00ad10) risk\nfactors for offending (especially measured by convictions) have been identified in the\nCambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD), which is a prospective longi-\ntudinal study of 411 London boys born mostly in 1953 (see later). To what extent can\nthese results be generalized to other times and places? For example, broken homes have\nincreased in the UK since the 1960s, and family size has decreased. Nevertheless, are\nthe relationships between broken homes and offending, and between large family size\nand offending, similar for the next generation, and specifically for the children of the\nThe importance of historical context was emphasized by Elder [8]. He stated (p.2)\nthat \"historical forces shape the social trajectories of family, education, and work, and\nthey in turn influence behavior and particular lines of development\". He also empha-\nsized the importance of life events and life transitions (e.g. early childbearing and\njoining the military) on development. Cohen et al. [6], in their Preface (pp. ix-x), argued\nthat, if incidence rates are stable across time and place, this suggests that biological\nfactors are more important than environmental factors. If incidence rates vary over\ntime, researchers should focus on historical events as possible explanations. If inci-\ndence rates vary across nations or cultural groups, researchers should focus on risk\nfactors that differ across these groups.\nIn order to investigate the replicability of risk factors for delinquency over time and\nplace, Farrington and Loeber [20] compared results in the CSDD for the 411 boys aged\nwere comparable to those measured in the earlier survey. In both cases, the strength of\nrelationships between childhood risk factors (usually dichotomized, for comparability,\ninto the \"worst\" quarter vs the remainder), and court appearances for delinquency\nbetween ages 10 and 16, were compared. They found that most childhood risk factors\nwere similarly related to delinquency in the 1960s in London and in the 1990s in\nPittsburgh.\nThis article compares risk factors for offending in two successive generations. To a\nlarge extent, it focusses on changes over time and holds constant other (e.g. geograph-\nical) influences. In studying risk factors in successive generations, it is important to\nhave comparable measures. It is also important to measure risk factors prospectively, in\norder to avoid retrospective bias. Most early studies of intergenerational transmission\n(at least up to the special section of Developmental Psychology edited by Serbin and\nStack [37]) compared retrospective reports in one generation with prospective reports in\nthe next generation.\nBy the time of the next special section on intergenerational transmission, in the\nJournal of Abnormal Child Psychology edited by Capaldi et al. [4], most of the articles\nDavid et al.\nwere based on prospective reports in successive generations. The major studies by\nCapaldi et al. [5] in Oregon and Thornberry et al. [39] in Rochester investigated the\nintergenerational transmission of antisocial behaviour and the extent to which it was\nmediated by parental and other (e.g. socio-economic) risk factors. Later special sections\n(e.g. [2]) and special issues (e.g. [3]) also focussed on mediating factors that might\nexplain intergenerational transmission. For example, Bailey et al. [1] in Seattle and\nFarrington et al. [16] in the CSDD investigated the extent to which family risk factors\nmediated the intergenerational transmission of antisocial behaviour and offending.\nWe have not found any prospective longitudinal study that explicitly compared risk\nfactors with offending in successive generations. This requires a three-generation study,\nsince family risk factors in generation 1 need to be compared with children's offending\nin generation 2, and family risk factors in generation 2 need to be compared with\nchildren's offending in generation 3. The most relevant studies are probably those by\nMenard and Johnson [34] and Johnson et al. [31]. Both analysed the National Youth\nSurvey-Family Study to investigate the extent to which particular theories of offending\nwere applicable in successive generations. Menard and Johnson [34] tested the appli-\ncability of the integrated theory proposed by Elliott et al. [9]. They found that the most\nimportant risk factor in both generations was delinquent peer bonding but that school\nstrain (low grades and low academic expectations) was more important for the second\ngeneration. Johnson et al. [31] tested the importance of general strain theory in\ntwo generations and concluded that strain variables (e.g. low expectations of\ngetting a good job and graduating from college) were directly related to delinquency in\nboth generations.\nThe present article examines the replicability of risk factors for offending in three\nsuccessive generations in the CSDD: the original 411 boys, their biological parents and\ntheir biological children. The original boys are called generation 2 (G2), while their\nbiological parents are generation 1 (G1), and their biological children are generation 3\n(G3). This article compares parental, family and socio-economic risk factors in G1 with\noffending by G2, and parental, family and socio-economic risk factors in G2 with\noffending by G3. It also compares childhood individual (attainment, impulsiveness and\nbehavioural) risk factors in G2 with later offending by G2, and similar individual risk\nfactors in G3 with offending by G3.\nA great deal is known about the most important childhood risk factors for\noffending by the G2 males (e.g. [17]). These include parental and family\nfactors such as a convicted parent, poor parental supervision and a disrupted\nfamily; socio-economic factors such as low family income, poor housing, and\nlarge family size; individual factors such as low intelligence, low school\nattainment, high daring/risk-taking and hyperactivity/poor concentration; and\nbehavioural factors such as troublesomeness and dishonesty. The main aim in\nthis article is to measure, as far as possible, similar risk factors in the next\ngeneration and to compare them with offending by the G3 males. In both\ngenerations, the strength of relationships between dichotomized risk factors and dichot-\nomized convictions is measured using the odds ratio (OR). As far as possible, risk\nfactors and offending are measured at the same ages. The independently important\npredictors are assessed using forward stepwise logistic regression analyses.\nIntergenerational similarities\nMethod\nAs mentioned, the CSDD is a prospective longitudinal survey of the development of\noffending and antisocial behaviour in 411 London males from age 8 onwards. The\nCSDD began in 1961, and for the first 20 years, it was directed by Donald West. David\nFarrington started working on it in 1969 and began directing the CSDD in 1982. The\nmost recent data collections have been jointly directed by David Farrington and Jeremy\nCoid. Results of the Study have been described in six books [22, 36, 40\u00ad43], and in five\ninformation about the CSDD.\nliving in a working-class area of South London. The vast majority of the\nsample was chosen by taking all the boys who were then aged 8\u00ad9 and on\nthe registers of six state primary schools within a 1-mi (1.6 km) radius of a\nresearch office which had been established. In addition to 399 boys from these\nsix schools, 12 boys from a local school for educationally subnormal children\nwere included in the sample, in an attempt to make it more representative of\nthe population of boys living in the area. Therefore, the boys were not a\nprobability sample drawn from a population, but rather a complete population\nof boys of that age in that area at that time.\nMost of the G2 boys (357, or 87 %) were Caucasian in appearance and of British\norigin, in the sense that they were being brought up by parents who had themselves\nbeen brought up in England, Scotland, or Wales. Of the remaining 54 boys, 12\nwere Afro-Caribbean, having at least one parent of West Indian (usually) or\nAfrican origin. Of the remaining 42 boys of non-British origin, 14 had at least\none parent from the North or South of Ireland, 12 had parents from Cyprus,\nand the other 16 boys were Caucasian and had at least one parent from another\nWestern industrialized country.\nOn the basis of their fathers' occupations when they were aged 8, 94 % of the G2\nboys could be described as working class (categories III, IV or V on the Registrar\nGeneral's scale, describing skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled manual workers), in\ncomparison with the national figure of 78 % at that time. The majority of the boys\nwere living in conventional two-parent families with both a father and a mother figure;\nat age 8, only 6 % of the boys had no operative father and only 1 % had no operative\nmother. This was, therefore, overwhelmingly a traditional Caucasian, urban, working-\nclass sample of British origin.\nInterviews\nand 48. At all ages except 21 and 25, the aim was to interview all the G2 males who\nwere still alive, and it was always possible to interview a high proportion: 405 (99 %) at\nDavid et al.\n(93 %) at age 48. The main focus in this article is on the information collected at age 32,\nwhen most of the G3 children were under age 10.\nBetween 2004 and 2013, efforts were made to interview the biological children of\nthe G2 males. These interviews were carried out over a 9-year period because of\nintermittent funding. There were 691 G3 children whose name and date of birth were\nknown. Only children aged at least 18 (born up to 1995) were targeted. The ethical\nrequirements of the South-East Region Medical Ethics Committee required that we\ncontact the G2 male and/or his female partner in trying to interview the G3 children and\nthat we only interview G3 children aged at least 18. Twenty children whose fathers\nrefused at age 48, and 7 children whose father was dead at age 48 (and where no female\npartner was available) were not eligible to be interviewed. An additional six G3 males\nwho had died and three who were disabled (one Down's syndrome, one mental health\nproblems, one severe attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder), together with two who\ndid not know that the G2 male was their father, were considered to be not eligible. Of\nOf the remainder, 39 children refused, 33 parents refused, 13 children could not be\ntraced, 14 were elusive (agreeing or not refusing but never being available to inter-\nview), and 3 were aggressive or problematic. Of the 29 children living abroad, 17 were\ninterviewed, usually by telephone.\nCriminal Record Searches of the G2 Males\nThese searches have been described in previous publications (e.g. [14, 19]). The\nminimum age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10. Recent\nsearches of criminal records of the G2 males took place in July 2002 and\nDecember 2004 in the Police National Computer (PNC), at which time most of\nthe males were aged 51. The Home Office report [15] and many previous\nanalyses were based on the criminal records up to age 50 derived from these\nsearches. A further search of the PNC was completed in March 2011, when\nmost males were aged 57. The criminal records of the G2 males are therefore now\nFor comparability with the G3 children, it was recently decided to count officially\nrecorded cautions as well as convictions in the PNC, since cautions were routinely\nthis article, \"convictions\" include cautions. Convictions were only counted if they were\nfor \"standard list\" (more serious) offences, thereby excluding minor crimes such as\nminor traffic infractions and simple drunkenness. The most common offences included\nwere thefts, burglaries and unauthorized takings of vehicles, although there were also\nquite a few offences of violence, vandalism, fraud and drug use. The definition of what\nis a \"standard list\" offence changed over time. In particular, common assault became a\nstandard list offence in July 1995, drunk driving was added to the standard list from\nJanuary 1996, and being drunk and disorderly was added in April 1997. All of these\ntypes of offences were counted.\nIntergenerational similarities\nCriminal Record Searches of the G3 Children\nAs mentioned, there were 691 children whose name and date of birth were known.\nTheir median year of birth was 1981, and more than half were born between 1977 and\n1985. They were first searched in the microfiche records in 1994, and they were then\nwere last searched was 30, and more than half were last searched between ages 25 and\nremaining 662 were searched. (In the other four cases, the identity of the convicted\nperson was not clear.) These included 344 G3 males and 314 G3 females. The focus in\nthis article is on the G3 males. Nearly all G3 males were searched up to age 21 at least,\nat risk (33.9 %) were convicted up to age 21 (excluding 7 males who emigrated before\nage 21 and were not searched abroad). It is known that the probability of conviction has\ndecreased over time in England and Wales (see e.g. [18]).\nFor comparability, all risk factors were dichotomized, as far as possible, into the\n\"worst\" quarter versus the remainder (see [21]).\nParental Convictions of the G1 father and G1 mother up to age 32 were obtained from\ncriminal record searches. (Age 32 was chosen for comparability in different genera-\ntions.) Authoritarian attitudes to parenting by G1 fathers and G1 mothers were based on\nthe Parental Attitude Schedules created by Gibson [27]. Example items are \"Strict\ndiscipline develops a good strong character in children\" and \"Children who are made to\nobey will thank their parents later\". Young G1 mothers were those who had their first\nchild before age 21, and young G1 fathers were those who had their first child before\nage 23. These ages were also chosen for comparability across generations. Nervousness\nof the G1 father was based on social worker ratings and psychiatric treatment.\nNervousness of the G1 mother was based on both of these measures together with\nthe Mother's Health Questionnaire [28].\nFamily Uninvolved G1 fathers were identified by a questionnaire on the extent\nto which the G1 father joined in the G2 boy's leisure activities (see [10, 38,\n42], for more information about all G1 and G2 measures). The uninvolved G1\nfathers rarely or never joined in the G2 boy's leisure activities. Harsh attitude\nand discipline at age 8\u00ad10 was based on social worker assessments of both G1\nparents, as was poor parental supervision, which referred to the extent to which\nthe G1 parents knew what the G2 boy was doing when he was out. Parental\nconflict was also rated by the social workers based on their interviews with the\nG1 parents, and it referred to chronic tension or disagreement in many fields, raging\nconflicts or estrangement. A disrupted family referred to the temporary or permanent\nseparation from a G1 parent before the G2 boy's tenth birthday for reasons other than\ndeath or hospitalization.\nDavid et al.\nSocio-economic Low G1 family income at age 8 was rated by the social workers. Large\nfamily size referred to five or more children born to the G2 boy's mother up to his tenth\nbirthday. Poor housing was rated by the social workers and referred to living in\ndilapidated slum premises. Low social class referred to G1 fathers who had an unskilled\nmanual job when the G2 boy was age 8\u00ad10.\nAttainment Low nonverbal IQ (90 or less) of the G2 boy was measured by the\nProgressive Matrices test, while low verbal IQ was based on verbal comprehension\nand vocabulary tests, all completed at ages 8 and 10. Low junior school attainment of\nthe G2 boy was based on school records of arithmetic, English and verbal reasoning\nImpulsiveness High daring was rated by parents and peers and identified G2 boys who\ntook many risks in traffic, climbing, exploring, etc. High impulsivity was based on the\nG2 boy's scores on three psychomotor tests, the Porteus Maze, the Spiral Maze, and the\nTapping test. High hyperactivity was based on ratings by teachers of whether the G2\nboy lacked concentration or was restless in class (at ages 8 and 10).\nBehaviour High troublesomeness was rated by peers and teachers and identified the G2\nboys who got into trouble most. High dishonesty was rated by peers.\nRisk Factors for G3 Male Offending\nParental Convictions of the G2 father and G2 mother up to age 32 were obtained from\ncriminal record searches. Authoritarian attitudes to parenting of G2 fathers and G2\nmothers were obtained from the same Parental Attitude Schedules used with the G1\nparents, completed by the G2 males and their G2 female partners when the G2 male\nwas age 32. As for G1, young fathers referred to G2 males who were under age 23 at\nthe time of the birth of their first child, and young mothers referred to G2 mothers who\nwere under age 21 at the birth of their first known child. (We only have records of\nchildren that the G2 female had with the G2 male.) Anxiety/depression of the\nG2 father was measured using the General Health Questionnaire [29], and depression of\nthe G2 mother was based on her reporting at least eight of the nine diagnostic criteria for\nmajor depressive disorder from the DSM-IV. (This was only available when the G2 male\nFamily Uninvolved G2 fathers were those who spent the least time in activities\nwith their children each week (according to their reports at age 32). Physical\npunishment referred to the G2 father hitting or smacking his children when they\nwere very naughty. Physical punishment was reported by both the G2 male at\nage 32 and by the G3 male (in retrospective questions about his childhood).\nPoor parental supervision referred to the G2 father not knowing where his\nchildren were when they were out, and this was also reported by the G3 male.\nParental conflict was based on the G2 father's report of frequent rows, and the\nIntergenerational similarities\nG2 father also answered about whether he had a child living elsewhere by age\n32. The G3 male, in his interview, reported on whether he had lived with his\nG2 father for the whole time period up to his 16th birthday or whether he had\nbeen separated.\nSocio-economic Low take-home pay was reported by the G2 male at age 32.\nLarge family size referred to five or more people living in the G2 male's\nhousehold when he was age 32. Poor housing of the G2 male at age 32 was\nrated by the interviewer, based on whether the home was dirty, smelly, damp,\nneglected, overcrowded and inadequately furnished, had vermin, or had struc-\ntural problems. Low social class at age 32 indicated that the G2 male had a\nsemi-skilled or unskilled manual job.\nAttainment Early school leaving was based on the report of the G3 male that he had left\nschool before age 16. He also reported on whether he had passed any advanced level\nexaminations.\nImpulsiveness The G3 male reported on whether he often or very often took many risks\nunder age 12, and on whether he always had difficulty paying attention at school.\nBehaviour The G3 male also reported on whether he had ever been suspended from\nschool and on whether he had been a frequent truant (1 day per week or more).\nResults\nAge 8\u00ad10 Risk Factors for G2 Male Offending\nTable 1 shows the strength of relationships between the age 8 and 10 risk factors and\nconvictions of the G2 males up to age 21. Three of the eight parental risk factors were\nsignificant predictors, and having a convicted G1 father was a somewhat stronger\npredictor than having a convicted G1 mother. Four of the five family risk factors were\nsignificant predictors: all except low G1 paternal involvement with the G2 boy. Three\nof the four socio-economic risk factors were significant predictors: all except low social\nclass. All of the individual risk factors (measuring attainment, impulsiveness and\nbehaviour) were significant predictors.\nLogistic regression analyses were then carried out to investigate independent pre-\ndictors. They were first of all carried out within categories of risk factors (e.g. parental\nor family), and the independently important variables were then included in a final\nlogistic regression analysis. Only explanatory risk factors were studied; behavioural\nvariables were excluded. Forward stepwise analyses were performed in order to\nminimize problems of multicollinearity. Table 2 shows that five risk factors were\nindependently predictive: one parental (convicted G1 father), one family (disrupted\nfamily), one socio-economic (large family size), one attainment (low junior school\nDavid et al.\nattainment) and one impulsiveness (high daring). (Large family size is included here\nalthough it was not quite significant on a two-tailed test. One-tailed tests are quite\njustifiable here in light of the directional predictions.) Numerous prior analyses of the\nCSDD have found that about five risk factors at age 8\u00ad10, typically drawn from\ndifferent categories, are independent predictors of later G2 offending (e.g. [17]).\nRisk factor (%) % NR % R OR CI\nParental\nFamily\nSocio-economic\nAttainment\nImpulsiveness\nBehaviour\n% R % convicted of risk category, % NR % convicted of non-risk category, OR odds ratio, CI 95 % confidence\ninterval\nIntergenerational similarities\nRisk Factors for G3 Male Offending\nTable 3 shows the strength of relationships between risk factors and convictions of the\nG3 males up to age 21.1 Of the parental risk factors, a convicted G2 father and a\nconvicted G2 mother were significant predictors. As with the G1 parents, G2 parental\nauthoritarianism and young parents were not predictive of G3 offending. Four of the\nfamily risk factors were significantly related: poor supervision according to both the G2\nmale at age 32 and the G3 male, physical punishment reported by the G3 male and\nseparation from a G2 parent before age 16 according to the G3 male.\nAll of the socio-economic risk factors at age 32, including low social class of the G2\nfather, were significantly predictive of G3 offending. Both of the G3 attainment risk\nfactors, together with early risk taking, suspension and frequent truancy, were related to\nG3 offending. Poor attention at school was not related to G3 offending.\nTable 4 shows the results of a logistic regression analysis predicting G3 male\noffending. As before, the behavioural variables were excluded. The strongest indepen-\ndent predictors were a convicted G2 father (a parental risk factor), risk-taking under age\n12 (measuring impulsiveness), low G2 take-home pay (a socio-economic factor) and\n1 1. Because all the children are not all independent, it is necessary to adjust the variance of the odds ratio to\ntake account of the clustering of children in families. It is easiest to do this by referring to the standardized\nmean difference d. Clustering has no material effect on the value of d but it increases the variance of d (see,\ne.g. [30]). The variance is increased by [1+(n - 1)*ICC], where n is the number of individuals in a cluster and\nICC is the intraclass correlation. This correction has been known for many years and has been called the\ndesign effect (e.g. [32]) or the variance inflation factor (e.g. [7]).\n\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc  * d = sqrt 3\n\u00f0 \u00de\nor Ln OR\nTherefore; SE Ln OR\n\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00f0 \u00de\nSince SE [Ln (OR)] increases in direct proportion to SE(d), it follows that the variance of Ln(OR), like\nthe variance of d, needs to be increased by [1+(n-1)*ICC] to take account of clustering. For the dichotomized\nmeasure of conviction, the ICC was .37, indicating a considerable degree of clustering of convictions in\nfamilies. Since there were 344 boys in 220 families, the average number of boys in a family was 1.56.\nTherefore, the variance of Ln(OR) was increased by [1 + 0.56*0.37], or by 21 %, to take account of the\nclustering of convictions. This is equivalent to increasing the standard error of Ln(OR) by 10 %.\nTable 2 Logistic regression analysis predicting G2 male offending up to age 21\nRisk factor LRCS change p Partial OR p\nLRCS likelihood ratio chi-square, OR odds ratio\np values two-tailed; N=377 (actual)\nDavid et al.\nthree family factors (physical punishment, poor supervision and separation). All six risk\nfactors were originally significant in the analysis, but only two were significant on a\ntwo-tailed test after the variance inflation factor described in Note 1 was applied.\nIn order to obtain a quantitative measure of the similarity of risk factors in the two\ngenerations, effect sizes for G2 offending were correlated with effect sizes for G3 offending\nTable 3 Risk factors for G3 male offending up to age 21\nRisk factor (%) % NR % R OR\nParental\nFamily\nSocio-economic\nAttainment\nImpulsiveness\nBehaviour\n% R % convicted of risk category, % NR % convicted of non-risk category, OR odds ratio, CI 95 % confidence\nInterval\nIntergenerational similarities\nover 20 similar risk factors. Because the ORs are ratio variables, the effect sizes were Ln\n(OR), which is an interval scale variable. Where there were both G2 and G3 effect sizes (for\nphysical punishment, poor supervision and separation), these were averaged. Remarkably,\nthe correlation between effect sizes was r=.80 (p<.0001), and the mean effect sizes for G2\neffect sizes were significantly different only for parental conflict (z=2.56, p=.010).\nDiscussion\nOf the parental risk factors, convicted fathers and convicted mothers were important for\nboth G2 and G3 offending. Authoritarian parental attitudes were not important. This\nmay be because the parental attitude questionnaire became increasingly out of date, and\nauthoritarian parental attitudes decreased considerably over time [38]. A young mother\nor father was not a significant predictor of offending, contrary to previous findings [35].\nNervousness or depression of parents was not very important for offending, although it\nwas previously found to be an important predictor of psychopathy [13].\nOf the family risk factors, poor supervision and disrupted families were important\nfor both G2 and G3 offending. Low paternal involvement with the child was not\nimportant for either G2 or G3 offending. Harsh discipline was important for G2 and\nphysical punishment was important for G3 (according to G3 males). The G2 risk factor\nincluded a cold attitude as well as harsh discipline. Parental conflict was important for\nG2 but not for G3. This may be because the earlier risk factor reflected more extreme\nconflicts, in an era when divorce was rare. The later risk factor reflected rows between\nparents, but G2 parents with the most extreme conflicts may already have been\ndivorced. In general, the family risk factors for G3 offending were problematic because\nthe information came from the father rather than from the mother, because the father at\nage 32 was answering for his children in general rather than for the specific G3 male,\nand because the G2 father may sometimes have been separated from the G3 male.\nOf the socio-economic factors, low family income, large family size and poor\nhousing were important for both G2 and G3 offending. However, the two variables\nmeasuring family size were not very comparable, as family size in the earlier time\nperiod referred to the number of children born to the G1 mother, whereas family size in\nTable 4 Logistic regression analysis predicting G3 male offending up to age 21\nRisk factor LRCS change p Partial OR p\nLRCS likelihood ratio chi-square, OR odds ratio\np values two-tailed; N=235 (actual)\nDavid et al.\nthe later time period referred to the number of people in the G2 male's household. Low\nsocial class was important for G3 offending but not for G2 offending. This may have\nbeen because, for the G1 males, some unskilled manual jobs had relatively high wages,\nwhereas this was less true for the G2 males. Indeed, the OR between low income and\nlow social class was significantly greater (5.66) in the later time period than in the\nOf the individual risk factors, measures of attainment and impulsiveness were\nimportant for both G2 and G3 offending. Unlike the earlier prospective measures, the\nG3 measures were obtained retrospectively from the G3 males. Therefore, the analysis\nof risk factors for G3 males is not always strictly predictive.\nThe logistic regression analyses (as with previous comparable analyses) indicated\nthat one risk factor from each of five categories independently predicted G2 offending.\nOne risk factor from four categories independently predicted G3 offending, but family\nfactors were relatively more important. All these results should be the starting point for\nformulating and testing developmental theories of offending (see [23]).\nSummarizing the main results, risk factors for G2 offending were highly correlated\n(r=.80) with risk factors for G3 offending. Eleven risk factors were significant predic-\ntors of both G2 and G3 offending: a convicted father, a convicted mother, harsh\ndiscipline, poor parental supervision, a disrupted family, low family income, large\nfamily size, poor housing, low attainment, daring/risk-taking and antisocial child\nbehaviour. A nervous/depressed mother was marginally significant for G2 offending\nbut not significant for G3 offending. Several risk factors were not significant predictors\nof either G2 or G3 offending: authoritarian parents, young parents, a nervous/depressed\nfather, and an uninvolved father. The findings were markedly different for only three\nrisk factors: parental conflict (the only significant difference between G2 and G3), low\nsocial class and hyperactivity/attention problems.\nWhile we did our best to measure comparable risk factors in the different genera-\ntions, it has to be admitted that some risk factors were not very comparable. For\nexample, hyperactivity in G2 was not the same as attention problems in G3. More\nefforts are needed to investigate the replicability of risk factors (and protective factors)\nover time and place. To the extent that risk factors are replicable in successive\ngenerations, this helps to answer objections that results obtained in one time period\nare not relevant to a later time period. Where results vary in different time periods, it is\nimportant to investigate cohort or time period effects that might explain the differences.\nIn our comparisons, we conclude that most of the findings in one generation were\nremarkably replicable in the next generation.\n"
