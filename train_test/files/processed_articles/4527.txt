Animals were\ndivided into four groups. Group 1 served as control group and received normal saline, group 2 served as toxic group and\nreceived 2 mg/kg tacrolimus i.p., group 3 served as treatment group and received 2 mg/kg tacrolimus i.p. followed by 2\nmg/kg aliskiren orally and group 4 served as drug per se group and received 2 mg/kg aliskiren orally. Tacrolimus-induced\nnephrotoxicity was assessed biochemically and histopathologically.\nResults: Treatment with aliskiren decreased the tacrolimus-induced changes in biochemical markers of nephrotoxicity\nsuch as blood urea nitrogen and creatinine. Aliskiren also attenuated the effects of tacrolimus on oxidative stress\nparameters such as malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione and catalase. Histopathological and ultrastructural studies\nshowed that aliskiren attenuated tacrolimus-induced renal damage.\nConclusion: These results suggest that aliskiren has protective effects against tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity;\nimplying that renin inhibitor may counteract nephrotic syndrome associated with immunosuppressant use.\n",

Previous literature suggests that the\nability of tacrolimus to produce reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) via activation of NADPH oxidase pathway and\ncause disturbance in antioxidant defense may be responsi-\nble for renal toxicity.10 Several studies suggest that the\nrenin\u00adangiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in the\nregulation of blood pressure (BP), volume homeostasis\nand development of cardiac hypertrophy, failure and reper-\nfusion injury.11,12 Subsequently, its importance in renal\nfailure has also been recognized and it has been established\nthat inhibition of RAS is an effective way to intervene with\nthe pathogenesis of these disorders.13\u00ad15 It is reported that\ntreatment with tacrolimus leads to impairment in RAS. It\nhas been shown previously that tacrolimus treatment sig-\nnificantly increases blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum\ncreatinine level, while it decreases endogenous creatinine\nTreatment with aliskiren ameliorates\ntacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity in rats\nNaif O Al-Harbi1, Faisal Imam1, Mohammed M Al-Harbi1,\nMuzaffar Iqbal2, Ahmed Nadeem1, Othman A Al-Shahrah1,\nHesham M Korashy1, Khalid A Al-Hosaini1, Mukhtar Ahmed3 and\nSaleh Bahashwar4\n Keywords\nAliskiren, tacrolimus, nephrotoxicity, renin inhibitor\n1Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy,\nKing Saud University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n2Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King\nSaud University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n3Department of Zoology, College of Science, King Saud University,\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia\n4Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy,\nTaibah University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nCorresponding author:\nFaisal Imam, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nEmail: fimam@ksu.edu.sa\nOriginal Article\nclearance and is inversely proportional to plasma renin\nactivity. The rise in plasma renin activity significantly cor-\nrelates with the increase in fractional excretion of Na.16,17\nSimilarly, renin mRNA levels are also increased in the\nrenal cortex in tacrolimus-treated rats.18 All these studies\nsuggest that tacrolimus disturbs the RAS and is also asso-\nciated with increased oxidative stress.\nAliskiren (ALK) is the first clinically used orally active\nrenin inhibitor, which selectively inhibits renin enzymatic\nactivity without affecting other systems.19,20 ALK attenu-\nates gentamicin-induced nephropathy by suppression of\ninflammatory, profibrotic and apoptotic factors through\ninhibition of the nuclear factor and mitogen-activated pro-\ntein kinase signaling pathways.20 Direct renin inhibition\nwith ALK prevents intra-renal RAS activation, leading to\nmitigation in the development of glomerulonephritis.21\nMoreover, transgenic mice overexpressing renin show dis-\nappearance of podocyte foot processes as well as perivas-\ncular and peri-glomerular inflammation in the kidney and\nthese changes are reversed by treatment with AT1 receptor\nantagonist.22 Based on these studies we hypothesized that\nALK may reduce/attenuate tacrolimus-induced renal dam-\nage and oxidative stress through renin inhibition. Therefore,\nthe present study was designed to investigate the effect of\nALK on tacrolimus-induced nephrotoxicity in rats using\nbiochemical markers of oxidative stress and renal function,\nand histopathological measures of cellular damage.\nMaterials and methods\nAnimal model\n(10\u00ad12 weeks old) were used. The animals were obtained\nfrom Experimental Animal Care Center, College of\nPharmacy at King Saud University. They were housed\nunder ideal laboratory conditions (12 h light/12 h darkness\n25\u00b0C), maintained on standard pellet diet and water ad\nlibitum throughout the experimental period. All experi-\nments were carried out according to the guidelines of the\nAnimal Care and Use Committee at King Saud University.\nDrugs and chemicals\nTacrolimus from Sigma Aldrich, USA and aliskiren from\nNovartis Ltd were used in the study. Biochemical param-\neters were done using kits (Dimension, Siemens, USA).\nAll of the other chemicals used were of analytical grade.\nExperimental protocol\nRats were randomly divided into four groups: Group 1,\ncontrol group, received normal saline for 14 days. Group\n2, toxic group, received tacrolimus (2 mg/kg, intraperito-\nneally (i.p.)) for 14 days.23 Group 3, treatment group,\nreceived tacrolimus (2 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14 days similarly to\ngroup 2, and also ALK [(50 mg/kg, dissolved in distilled\nwater administered per os (p.o.)] for 28 days.24 Group 4,\ndrug per se group, received ALK (50 mg/kg, dissolved in\ndistilled water administered p.o.) for 28 days.24\nTacrolimus administration (in group 2 and 3) started on\nday 15 and was continued till the end of the study. All the\nrats were sacrificed at the end of the study by decapitation\nunder ether anesthesia, as per the protocol. Blood samples\nwere collected followed by serum separation at 3000 g for\n10 min. Samples were then kept at \u00ad20 \u00baC until analysis of\nrenal function parameters.\nThe rats' kidneys were isolated and washed in ice cold\nphysiological saline and used for assessment of oxidative\nstress, histopathology and ultrastructural changes.\nBiochemical estimation\nBiochemical estimations were done by autoanalyzer\n(Dimension RXL MAX, Siemens, USA).\nDetermination of lipid peroxides, measured as\nmalondialdehyde (MDA)\nThe level of MDA, a product of membrane lipid peroxida-\ntion, was estimated by reacting it with thiobarbituric acid\n(TBA), by the method of Okhawa et al.,25 using the standard\ncalibration curve prepared from tetraethoxy propane. MDA\nwas expressed as nmoles of MDAper mg of protein. Protein\nwas estimated by the method of Lowry et al.26\nDetermination of reduced glutathione (GSH)\nGSH content was estimated by the method of Sedlack and\nLindsay.27 The absorbance of reaction mixture as read within\n5 min of addition of dithibis-2-nitrobenzoic acid at 412 nm\nusing a UV-spectrophotometer, against a reagent blank.\nDetermination of catalase (CAT)\nKidney tissue was homogenized and post-mitochondrial\nsupernatant (PMS) was used to assay CAT activity. CAT\nactivity was estimated using the method of Claiborne.28\nThe reaction mixture consisted of 1.95 ml of phosphate\nM) and 0.05 ml of PMS in a final volume of 3 ml. Changes\nin absorbance were recorded at 240 nm every minute for 5\nmin. The enzyme activity was calculated as nmoles of\nconsumed/min/mg protein.\nHistopathological studies\nKidneys were harvested from the rats and fixed in 10%\nbuffer formosaline. Paraffin sections of thickness 3\u00ad4 m\nwere prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E) for histopathological examination under light\nUltrastructural studies\nImmediately after removal of kidney from the dissected\nrats, tissues were sliced into small size (1 mm\u00b3) and fixed\nin 3% buffered glutaraldehyde. Tissue specimens were\nthen post fixed in 1% osmium tetaroxide (OsO4\nmin. Dehydration of the fixed tissue was performed using\nascending grades of ethanol followed by transfer of tissue\nto epoxy resin via propylene oxide. After impregnation\nwith the pure resin (SPI Resin), tissue specimens were\nembedded in the same resin mixture.31 Ultra-thin sections\nof silver shades (60\u00ad70 nm) were cut using an ultra-\nmicrotome (Leica, UCT, Tokyo, Japan) with a diamond\nknife; sections were then placed on copper grids and\nstained with uranyl acetate (20 min) and lead citrate (5\nmin). Stained sections were observed under Transmission\nElectron Microscopy (JEOL JEM-1011Tokyo, Japan)\nStatistical analysis\nAll results are expressed as mean\u00b1standard error of the\nmean (SEM). Comparisons among different groups were\nanalyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by\nTukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test to identify sig-\nnificance among groups. Values were considered statisti-\ncally significant when p<0.05. Statistical analysis was\ncarried out using GraphPad Prism 3.0.\nResults\nEffects of ALK on tacrolimus-induced\nparameters of renal function in serum\nIn this study, two weeks of treatment of rats resulted in\ntacrolimus-induced renal damage as evidenced by a sig-\nnificant (p<0.05) increase in serum creatinine and BUN\nlevels as compared to the control group. Treatment with\nALK significantly (p<0.05) decreased both serum creati-\nnine and BUN levels compared to the toxic group. A sig-\nnificant (p<0.05) decrease in serum total protein and\nalbumin was seen in the toxic group which was reversed\nby treatment with ALK. the drug group per se had no sig-\nnificant changes in any of parameters compared to control\ngroup (Table 1).\nEffects of ALK on tacrolimus-induced\nparameters of oxidative stress in kidney\nThe results are summarized in Figure 1\u00ad3. Two weeks\ntreatments of rats with tacrolimus (2 mg/kg) resulted in a\nsignificant (p<0.05) increase in kidney MDA contents\ncompared to the control group. Treatment with ALK\nshowed a significant (p<0.05) decrease in tacrolimus-\ninduced kidney MDA level (Figure 1). Consequently, a\nsignificant (p<0.05) decrease in kidney GSH level (Figure\n2) and catalase activity (Figure 3) was found in tacrolimus-\ntreated rats as compared to the control group. Treatment\nwith ALK showed a significant increase in tacrolimus-\ninduced kidney GSH level (p<0.05) and catalase activity\n(p<0.05). The drug per se group had no significant changes\nin any of parameters compared to control group.\nEffects of ALK on tacrolimus-induced\nparameters of histopathological changes in\nkidney\nNormal morphological structures of renal tissue were seen\nin the control group (Figure 4a). However two weeks treat-\nment with tacrolimus resulted in hypertrophy of epithelial\ncells and renal tubules epithelia degeneration. The dilatation\nof capillaries filled with erythrocytes was the most advanced\nchange all over the kidney. Renal glomeruli and epithelial\ncell enlargement in the cortical part of the kidney were also\nobserved. In a few renal tubules, single epithelial cells des-\nquamated from the lumen were also noted (Figure 4b). Four\nweeks treatment with ALK ameliorated tacrolimus-induced\ndamage in renal tissue to that observed in normal tissue\n(Figure 4c). No morphological changes were observed in\nthe drug per se group (Figure 4d).\nEffects of ALK on tacrolimus-induced\nparameters of ultrastructural changes in kidney\nUltrastructural changes in cellular structure were further\nvisualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nTable 1.

By con-\ntrast, nephropathic changes were observed in the\ncortico-medullary region of the toxic group which were\ncharacterized by glomerular damage, including dilatation\nof glomerular blood vessels, exfoliation and shedding of\nproximal tubular cells into the tubular lumen, thickened\nbasement membrane, and interstitial inflammation (Figure\n5b). Cellular damage was accompanied by `scarring' of\nsome glomeruli (focal glomerular sclerosis) and tubules\n(tubular interstitial fibrosis), as well as by tubular regen-\neration (Figure 5b). We also noticed degenerated mito-\nchondria, numbers of multi-vesicle bodies, glomerular\nepithelial injury, and cell debris. Under normal conditions,\ntubular regeneration serves to restore the loss of damaged\ncells by a transient increase of cell proliferation. However,\nin ALK-treated rats, the kidneys demonstrated massive\nand sustained regenerative renal cell proliferation, result-\ning in simple tubular hyperplasia, indicated by a broad\nincrease of cell number and multilayered tubules. ALK\ntreatment was associated with normalization of the tacroli-\nmus-induced renal cell damage and the treated rats showed\nnormal cellular features (Figure 5c). Normal cellular struc-\ntures were observed in the drug per se group (Figure 5d).\nDiscussion\nALK is one of a new class of orally active agents which\nselectively inhibits renin enzymatic activity without affect-\ning other systems involved in cardiovascular regulation.\nRecently, in some studies, the protective effects of ALK on\nnephrotoxicity were evaluated using animal models (acute\nmurine model)33 or drugs (such as gentamycin and doxoru-\nbicin).19,34 The concentration of creatinine and BUN\ndepend on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Renal dys-\nfunction reduces glomerular filtration of creatinine and\nBUN, and thus levels of creatinine and BUN rise. If the\nserum creatinine and BUN levels double, the GFR is con-\nsidered to have been halved.34,35 Previous reports have\nconfirmed that tacrolimus-induced nephropathy is mani-\nfested by elevation in the serum levels of creatinine and\nshowed elevated levels of serum creatinine and BUN.\nHowever, treatment with ALK caused a significant reduc-\ntion in creatinine and BUN levels which may be due to\nimprovement in glomerular filtration damage induced by\ntacrolimus. These results are in agreement with an earlier\nreport.38 Hypo-albuminemia is a characteristic feature of\nthe nephrotic syndrome.39 In this study, serum albumin\nFigure 2.

MDA: malondialdehyde.\nlevel was found to be low in tacrolimus-treated rats, simi-\nlar to the findings of previous studies.40\u00ad42 Treatment with\nALK reversed tacrolimus-induced hypo-albuminemia.38\nTherefore, it is suggested that ALK improves renal func-\ntion by counteracting tacrolimus-induced nephropathy.\nIn our study, we observed a significant increase in the\nconcentration of MDA level in renal tissues of tacrolimus-\ntreated animals as compared to the control group. The\nelevated level of MDA may be due to enhanced production\nof ROS (superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide and\nhydroxyl radicals). Ibrahim et al., also reported a signifi-\ncant increase in kidney MDA content in rats with a cumu-\nlative dose of tacrolimus.33 Similar studies were also\nthat tacrolimus enhanced production of ROS leading to\ncell death.17 In this study, treatment withALK significantly\ndecreased renal MDA level which suggests its role in com-\nbating oxidative stress generated by tacrolimus. As MDA\nis a secondary product of lipid peroxidation of unsaturated\nfatty acids, its decrease by ALK could be taken as an index\nfor decreased oxidative stress and subsequent reduction in\nTissue GSH depletion is one of the primary factors\nwhich permit lipid peroxidation.46 The decreased CAT\nactivity in renal tissue may be due to excess production of\nsuperoxide and hydrogen peroxide which promote lipid\nperoxide formation. In the present study, administration of\ntacrolimus decreased GSH level and CAT activity as com-\npared to the control group, while treatment with ALK\nreversed the tacrolimus-induced decrease in renal GSH\ncontent and CAT activity. Increased intracellular GSH\ncontent and CAT activity might be due to up-regulation of\nenzymatic/nonenzymatic antioxidants or decreased ROS\nproduction in the ALK-treated group. ALK has been\nshown to decrease oxidative stress in earlier studies.47,48\nIn histopathological examination of the toxic group, the\nepithelia of the renal tubules show degeneration with infil-\ntration of mononuclear cells, dilation of glomeruli as well\nFigure 4.

The dilata-\ntion of capillaries filled with erythrocytes was the most\nadvanced change all over the kidney. Further, the present\nstudy showed tubular vacuolization in toxic group.\nExamination of the renal cellular ultrastructure showed\nround, oval mitochondria within the tubular epithelium in\ntacrolimus-treated rats. Further ultrastructural analysis\nshowed disturbances in podocyte foot processes i.e. podo-\ncyte foot injury and podocyte foot process effacement.\nSimilar histopathological and ultrastructural changes are\nassociated with tacrolimus-related nephrotoxicity, includ-\ning tubular vacuolisation, arteriolar hyalinosis, interstitial\nfibrosis and juxtaglomerular hyperplasia which have been\nreported earlier.38,49\u00ad52 Tacrolimus-induced histopathologi-\ncal and ultrastructural changes were reversed by treatment\nwith ALK. There was restoration of podocyte architecture\nalong with epithelial integrity after treatment with ALK.\nTubular vacuolization induced by tacrolimus was also\nattenuated by treatment with ALK. Earlier studies have\nshown that RAS blockade leads to preservation of podo-\ncyte architecture, mitochondrial function and epithelial\nSome additional parameters like measurement of blood\npressure and plasma renin activity would have further\nstrengthened our findings, however these could not be\nmeasured and this is a limitation of the current study.\nTreatment with ALK ameliorated tacrolimus-induced\nnephrotoxicity implying that renin inhibition leads to\nimprovement in renal function. The protective effect ofALK\nwas accompanied by a significant attenuation of oxidative\nstress parameters in kidney (MDA, GSH and CAT), improve-\nment in renal function biochemistry in serum as well as res-\ntoration of renal structures as observed by histopathological\nand ultrastructural findings. Thus, the current study suggests\nthat ALK treatment may protect against nephrotic syndrome\nassociated with immunosuppressant use.\nFigure 5.
