Preferences have\nbeen found to shift as a function of parasite prevalence in the ecology, operational sex ratio,\nand other culturally variable factors (Gangestad and Buss, 1993; Stone, Shackelford, and\n1 All editorial decisions were made by Associate Editor Catherine Salmon\nSocioeconomics and mate preferences\nBuss, 2007). Previous research on the context sensitivity of mate preferences indicates that\nmen and women also place differential importance on certain characteristics in a mate\ndepending on the temporal context of the desired relationship (Buss and Schmitt, 1993;\nAlthough sex differences in importance of mate preference characteristics are\nfrequently predicted and discovered empirically, the effects of culture on mate preferences\nare potentially generally greater than those of biological sex (Buss et al., 1990; Gangestad,\nHaselton, and Buss, 2006). One variable that may serve as a baseline in comparing\ndifferent cultures is a country's level of socioeconomic development. Socioeconomic\ndevelopment is a variable that cuts across different modes of production, types of\ngovernment, and geographic regions to present a broad picture of problems people confront\nin daily life across cultures that would otherwise be incomparable. Men and women\nevaluating potential partners in different cultures face different problems associated with\nsocioeconomic development. We therefore expect that men and women may place\ndifferential importance on characteristics in a long-term mate that solve the different\nproblems encountered by individuals in each context.\nContextual Problem of Finding a Healthy Partner\nIn general, individuals in more socioeconomically developed countries are healthier\n(Marmot, 2005). Therefore, encountering a healthy potential partner is less likely in less\ndeveloped countries. We hypothesize that men and women in less developed countries will\nrate a potential partner's health as more important than those in more developed countries.\nAdditional characteristics indicative of good health are predicted to be more important to\nboth sexes in less developed countries than in more developed countries, including\npreferences for refinement/neatness and chastity. Men and women who are more refined\nand neat--conceptualized as clean--are more likely to be healthy, relative to individuals\nwho are less refined and neat. Although the sterile environments of some very developed\nnations may yield weakened immune responses, cleanliness (and refinement and neatness)\nis far more likely to be related to healthful outcomes than filthiness across a wide range of\ncultures. Also, men and women who are chaste, or who have had no previous sex partners,\nare much less likely to carry a sexually transmitted disease. In addition, because women are\ntraditionally associated with the performance of domestic labors, including a characteristic\nrelated to eating and living healthfully--cooking and housekeeping--we predict that only\nmen will increase importance ratings for a partner who is a good cook and housekeeper in\nless developed countries. The sexual division of labor is a feature found universally in\nhuman societies (Brown, 1991), and we mean only to note that these are tasks traditionally\n(and throughout cultures universally) adopted by women, and they should be especially\nimportant to men in less developed societies where women are indeed less likely to be in\nHypothesis 1: The importance that men and women place on characteristics indicative\nof good health will be negatively correlated with socioeconomic development.\nPrediction 1: The importance that men place on a potential partner's health,\nrefinement/neatness, chastity, and being a good cook and housekeeper will be negatively\ncorrelated with socioeconomic development.\nPrediction 2: The importance that women place on a potential partner's health,\nrefinement/neatness, and chastity, will be negatively correlated with socioeconomic\nSocioeconomics and mate preferences\ndevelopment.\nContextual Problem of Finding a Partner with Ample Resources\nIndividuals in less socioeconomically developed countries are less likely to have\naccess to resources, and so may place particular importance on associated characteristics in\na mate. These characteristics may include good financial prospects, status, ambition and\nindustriousness, and education and intelligence.\nHypothesis 2: The importance that men and women place on characteristics related\nto wealth, including good financial prospects, status, ambition and industriousness, and\neducation and intelligence, will be negatively correlated with socioeconomic development.\nContextual Problem of Finding a Partner Desirous of Children\nMen and women in less developed countries have more children than do men and\nwomen in more developed countries (Aarssen, 2005). This may be because children in less\ndeveloped countries are an economic asset to the extent they are able to help the household\nwith farming or herding, relative to more developed countries in which children may be a\nnet financial drain. Indeed, parents appear to explicitly perceive the value of children as a\ngreater net benefit (psychologically as well as economically) in less socioeconomically\ndeveloped countries (Kait\u00e7ibai, 1982). In addition, life history theorists studying the\ndemographic transition find that the cost of raising successful, competitive children\nnegatively affects the optimal family size and positively affects amount of resources\nallocated per child (Mace, 2000). Thus, men and women have more children in less\ndeveloped countries, and may do so because they perceive children to be a greater net\neconomic and psychological benefit to the household. In the current research, we\ninvestigate whether a greater valuation of children, as reported in Kait\u00e7ibai, extends to\ncharacteristics important in a mate among individuals in less developed countries. And to\nthe extent that children are a net benefit at the household level, individuals in less\ndeveloped countries are predicted to place greater importance on a potential partner's desire\nfor home and children than men and women in more developed countries.\nHypothesis 3: The importance that men and women place on a potential partner's\ndesire for home and children will be negatively correlated with socioeconomic\ndevelopment.\nContextual Problem of Finding a Partner with a Similar Religious Background\nKhallad (2005) suggests that religion may be particularly important in the day-to-\nday life of people in less developed countries, and some evolutionary psychological\naccounts of religion stress that it may function, in part, to allay people's anxieties about\ndeath (Atran, 2002; Atran and Norenzayan, 2004). To the extent that individuals living in a\nless socioeconomically developed country experience higher infant mortality, lower life\nexpectancy, and are less healthy (Marmot, 2005), people are predicted to place greater\nimportance on religion--and religious similarity in a potential mate--in less developed\ncountries if indeed religion serves, in part, to allay anxieties about death. We therefore\nhypothesize that men and women in less developed countries will place more importance\non finding a partner who shares their religious background.\nHypothesis 4: The importance that men and women place on a potential partner\nhaving a similar religious background will be negatively correlated with socioeconomic\ndevelopment.\nSocioeconomics and mate preferences\nWe used a descriptive measure of differences between countries--socioeconomic\ndevelopment--to test hypotheses and derivative predictions of variance in importance\nratings of 18 characteristics in a prospective long-term mate. Although this mate preference\ndatabase has been analyzed to produce several articles (e.g., Buss, 1989; Buss et al., 1990),\nthe current article presents the results of new analyses designed to test different hypotheses\nand predictions.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\ncontinents and five islands. Men ranged in age from 17 to 30 years, with a mean age of\nMaterials and Procedure\nThe survey used to assess mate preferences was adapted from Hill (1945). In this\nsurvey, participants rate the importance of 18 mate preference characteristics (see Table 1)\non the following 4-point scale: 3 points = indispensable, 2 = important, 1 = desirable, but\nnot very important, and 0 = irrelevant or unimportant. Instructions were provided to each\ncollaborator for translating the instrument into the appropriate language for their sample\n(see Buss, 1989, for additional details).\nWe calculated an index of socioeconomic development according to the method\nprescribed in South (1988), as he used four common development indicators and found this\nmeasure to strongly mediate women's marital opportunities. We summed standardized\nscores for the country's Gross National Product (GNP), infant survival rate, life\nexpectancy, and the percentage of the population that is urban, and achieved an acceptable\nalpha ( = 0.82). Because the mate preference data were collected in the mid-1980s, we\ncollected socioeconomic development data for a comparable year (i.e., 1985). GNP data\nwere obtained from the United States Bureau of the Census (2002) for the year 1990, and\nremaining demographic data were obtained from the United Nations (2004) for the year\nAdditionally, because Stone et al. found mate preference shifts according to a country's sex\nratio, we controlled for sex ratio in partial-order correlations (see Table 1).\nResults\nTable 1 presents the zero-order correlations and partial correlations between all of the\n18 preference characteristics, including those unrelated to the hypotheses, and the\nDevelopment Index. Predictions 1 and 2 of Hypothesis 1 were supported. Importance\nratings of health (p < .01 for men, p < .05 for women) and health-related characteristics,\nincluding refinement/neatness (ps < .01), chastity (ps < .01), and good cook and\nhousekeeper (for men, p < .001), correlated significantly and negatively with\nDevelopmental Index (see Table 1).\nSocioeconomics and mate preferences\nTable 1.

Partial correlations control for the country's sex ratio (see Stone, Shackelford, and\nBuss, 2007, for list of development indices and sex ratios).\nHypothesis 2 was partially supported: importance ratings for status significantly and\nnegatively correlated with Development Index for both sexes (p < .01 for men, p < .001 for\nwomen), as did the characteristic education and intelligence for both sexes (ps < .05). As\nhypothesized, ambition and industriousness was significantly negatively correlated with\nDevelopment Index for men (p < .05), but not for women (although the correlation was\nmarginally significant, p < .10). Finally, importance ratings for good financial prospects\nwere not significantly negatively correlated with Development Index (ps > .05), although\nthese relationships were in the predicted direction for both men and women, and for women\nthis relationship was marginally significant (p < .10; see Table 1).\nMen's and women's importance ratings for desire for home and children correlated\nsignificantly and negatively with Development Index (ps < .05), providing support for\nHypothesis 3 (see Table 1). Hypothesis 4 also was supported: across cultures, importance\nSocioeconomics and mate preferences\nratings for similar religious background correlated significantly and negatively with\nDevelopment Index for both men (p < .05) and women (p < .01; see Table 1).\nAn additional unpredicted significant correlation emerged: men's and women's\nimportance ratings for the characteristic \"mutual attraction--love\" correlated significantly\nand positively with Development Index (p < .001 for men, p < .01 for women; see Table 1).\nControlling for sex ratio did not result in partial correlations that differed significantly from\nthe corresponding zero-order correlations (see Table 1; by Fisher's r-to-z transformation;\nall zs < 1.50, all ps > .10; analyses available on request).\nDiscussion\nConsistent with Hypothesis 1, men and women in less developed countries placed\ngreater importance on health and health-related characteristics in a potential long-term\nmate. This corroborates the results of previous research indicating a positive relationship\nbetween the prevalence of parasites and the importance that men and women place on\nattractiveness in a potential partner (Gangestad and Buss, 1993). Gangestad and Buss found\nthat wealth may have confounded their results, and additionally, a country's level of\nsocioeconomic development is a conceptually distinct context from parasite prevalence.\nAccordingly, the current investigation of the relationships between importance ratings and\nsocioeconomic development yielded non-significant results for the characteristic of good\nlooks. Men's and women's relatively stable preference for attractiveness indicates that,\nalthough health (and healthy behaviors) in a prospective long-term mate is variably\nimportant, the value attached to attractiveness does not shift across this context.\nThe results partially supported Hypothesis 2: although men's and women's\npreferences for a mate with good financial prospects did not change, men and women in\nless developed countries rated a potential partner's status and education and intelligence as\nmore important, relative to ratings provided by individuals in more developed countries.\nThe failure to find support for a shift in preferences for good financial prospects might be\nattributable, in part, to the fact that men and women in less developed countries are less\nwealthy, and thus are not able to secure mates who do have good financial prospects. They\nmight instead place increased importance on related characteristics that are attainable in\npotential partners in less developed countries, such as status and education and intelligence,\na speculation corroborated by the current results. In addition, in less developed countries\nfinancial prospects may be less important indicators of resources than the possession of\ncows, sheep, and goats, for example, which those in high status may possess. It is worth\nnoting, however, that the correlation between good financial prospects and Development\nIndex is in the predicted direction, and is marginally significant for women. Finally, there\nwere sex-differentiated shifts in preferences for the characteristic ambition and\nindustriousness--men in less developed countries placed relatively more importance on\nthis characteristic. This may be somewhat unsurprising, given that in less developed\ncountries, men need women to work hard and to be industrious in gathering, housework,\nhauling firewood and water, and other important domestic tasks.\nThe results supported Hypothesis 3: men and women in less developed countries\nplaced greater importance on a potential partner's desire for home and children than did\nmen and women in more developed countries. These results corroborate the results of\nprevious research indicating that individuals living in less developed countries perceive a\nSocioeconomics and mate preferences\ngreater benefit from having more children, as they also place more importance on this mate\npreference characteristic. These results also suggest that there is a psychological foundation\nfor cross-cultural variation in family size--manifested in mate preferences--that eschews\nexplanations concerning a relative lack of contraception in less developed countries.\nThe results also supported Hypothesis 4, in that men and women in less developed\ncountries placed greater importance on a potential partner's similar religious background,\nthan did men and women in more developed countries. These results are consistent with\nKhallad's (2005) contention that people in less developed countries place greater\nimportance on religion than do people in more developed countries. These results also are\nbroadly consistent with evolutionary psychological arguments that highlight the role of\nreligion in reducing existential anxieties (Atran, 2002; Atran and Norenzayan, 2004). These\nresults appear not to be consistent with predictions derived from hypotheses that religious\nbeliefs are a by-product of other psychological mechanisms that serve no substantive role\nOne unpredicted result emerged: men and women in more developed countries placed\ngreater importance on \"mutual attraction/love\" than did individuals in less developed\ncountries. This cross-cultural shift in importance of mutual attraction/love might reflect\ncultural differences in the functions of long-term mating relationships (Smits, Ultee, and\nLammers, 1998). Men and women in less developed countries may perceive long-term\nrelationships as an economic transaction. In some less developed cultures, for example,\nmarriages involve a trade between families of cows, sheep, or goats for a valuable mate\n(Borgerhoff Mulder, 1988), or the formation of an economic alliance between two extended\nfamilies (Hart and Pilling, 1960). In some cultures, such as traditional India, married\ncouples do not spend much time together, preferring to socialize primarily with members of\ntheir own sex (Buss, 2003). Individuals in more developed countries often have more\nlatitude for individual choice, and perceive the functions of long-term mateships to include\nmutual socializing, companionship, and close emotional commitment (Buss, 2003; Fisher,\n2004). The somewhat different functions of long-term mateships in developed versus less\ndeveloped cultures may be responsible for the differential emphasis placed on mutual\nattraction/love--a hypothesis that awaits additional empirical testing. Future research might\ninvestigate directly cross-cultural differences in perceptions of the functions and benefits of\nlong-term mateships.\nAlternatively, the reported shifts in preferences may not reflect true differences in\nmate preference characteristics, but rather a limitation of the study design. Li, Bailey,\nKenrick, and Linsenmeier (2002) proposed a model of mate preferences that includes a\ntrade-off between necessities and luxuries. This trade-offs model suggests that real\nindividuals do not possess equal amounts of the characteristics measured in mate\npreference studies, but that these characteristics are unevenly distributed. In the real world,\nmen and women must choose certain characteristics over others. Accordingly, men and\nwomen in more developed countries may not find characteristics related to a potential\npartner's health and wealth to be any less important than do individuals in less developed\ncountries. Rather, men and women might universally consider characteristics of health and\nwealth to be necessities, but because men and women in developed countries may take\nthese characteristics for granted relative to individuals in less developed countries, they\nrated them as less important in the current study. Future research investigating cross-\ncultural mate preference shifts might profitably assess differences in the necessities and\nSocioeconomics and mate preferences\nluxuries of mate preferences.\nAdditionally, we note that, except for the one predicted sex difference in preferences\nfor healthiness operationalized in preferences for a good cook and housekeeper, we\nidentified few sex-differentiated mate preference shifts associated with socioeconomic\ndevelopment. The lack of sex-differentiated shifts according to the context of\nsocioeconomic development does not contradict previous research documenting sex\ndifferences in mate preference characteristics (e.g., for characteristics indicating access to\nresources or social status; Buss, 1989). Indeed, there is no theoretical reason for other sex\ndifferences to shift according to socioeconomic development--for example, women place\nrelatively more importance than men on indicators of potential resources across this\ncontext, although both sexes place more importance on this characteristic in less developed\ncountries than do individuals in more developed countries.\nFinally, because the nature of this study is correlational, a causal relationship between\nthese variables cannot be inferred. Future research might investigate other variables that\nmay be related to cross-cultural shifts in mate preferences, such as differences in women's\neconomic power, or a country's type of government (see Gangestad, Haselton, and Buss,\nIn summary, the results of the current study provide initial support for cross-cultural\nmate preference shifts according to differences in socioeconomic development. These shifts\npredictably occur in domains related to health, wealth, traditional values related to religion\nand the desire for children, as well as love. These findings contribute to a growing body of\nevidence that links important ecological, temporal, and cultural contexts with shifts in mate\npreferences.\nReferences\nAarssen, L. W. (2005).
