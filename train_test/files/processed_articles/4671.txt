    "abstract": "Abstract\nA number of recent studies suggest that individuals who exhibit high levels of racial animosity strongly support Donald\nTrump, while racial liberals strongly oppose him. This paper provides a new experimental analysis of the extent to\nwhich supporters and opponents of Trump respond differently to race-related stimuli. Specifically, we examine whether\nattitudes toward Trump moderate the political impact of racial cues in the environment. We find that white Trump\nsupporters randomly exposed to a black (versus a white) man in the context of soliciting their support for a housing-\nassistance policy were more opposed to the policy, angrier about the policy, and more likely to blame beneficiaries for\ntheir situation. The opposite pattern prevailed among whites with unfavorable opinions of Trump. Our results help\nprovide new insight into how Trump supporters and opponents differ in their responses to the salience of race in\nAmerican politics.\n",

He has no experi-\nence in elected office, a brash style, and policy positions\nthat often diverge from those traditionally espoused by\nRepublicans (e.g. on Social Security and Medicare).\nScholars have attempted to explain the basis of support for\nTrump as a product of feelings of economic anxiety, the\ngrowing populism of the Republican Party (with a focus on\nanti-immigrant sentiment), sexism, and authoritarianism\nPerhaps most important, analysts have focused on Trump's\nappeal to white Americans who harbor animosity toward\n\"undeserving\" racial minorities. Trump's lack of support\namong people of color and his popularity among white sub-\ngroups with less tolerant attitudes (such as whites without\ncollege degrees) provide suggestive evidence that support\nfor his candidacy was rooted in racial hostility. Moreover,\nTrump's call for law and order in the context of discussing\nurban unrest--to give just one example--is reminiscent of\nprevious racial appeals in American politics, including\nGeorge HW Bush's Willie Horton ad (Mendelberg, 2001)\nand Richard Nixon's \"Southern strategy\" (Hillygus and\nShields, 2008). More diagnostic still are studies showing\nthat variables measuring white in-group favoritism and\nthose measuring bias against racial and ethnic out-groups\nstrongly correlate with support for Trump (e.g., Cohen\nWhile previous work has shown that racial attitudes pre-\ndict support for Donald Trump, no studies that we are aware\nof have examined whether attitudes toward Trump moder-\nate the political impact of racial cues in the environment. In\nthis research note, we examine whether such effects are\nheterogeneous, and whether heterogeneity stems from eval-\nuations of Donald Trump as he sought to win the 2016\npresidential election. To do so, we directly examine the\nSupporters and opponents of\nDonald Trump respond differently\nto racial cues: An experimental analysis\nMatthew D. Luttig1, Christopher M.

Specifically, we randomly\nassign respondents to view a subtle image of either a black\nor a white man in the context of soliciting attitudes toward\na housing-assistance policy. As a social welfare issue, atti-\ntudes toward government housing assistance tap into per-\nceptions of deservingness that many see as central to the\ngrowing populism of the Republican Party, and upon\nwhich Donald Trump based his candidacy (e.g., Cramer,\nof racial cues on attitudes toward housing assistance, our\nstudy allows for an examination of whether attitudes\nrelated to perceptions of deservingness change upon\nexposure to an image of a black versus a white man, and\nwhether this effect varies depending on one's level of sup-\nport for Donald Trump. To the extent that Trump support-\ners and opponents differ in how they respond to racial\ncues, we hypothesize that:\nHypothesis 1: for Trump supporters, subtle presentation\nof a black racial cue--versus a white racial cue--will (a)\ndecrease support for government housing assistance, (b)\nincrease anger that some people receive government\nassistance, and (c) increase the belief that individuals\nare to blame for their situation.\nWe also hypothesize that Trump opponents will have the\nopposite reaction. Consistent with Tesler and Sears (2010)\nand Tesler's (2016c) finding of \"two-sided\" racialization in\nevaluations of President Obama (such that racially sympa-\nthetic whites held more favorable evaluations of Obama\nthan previous Democratic candidates, and that racially\nresentful whites held more negative evaluations of Obama\nthan previous Democrats), we hypothesize that:\nHypothesis 2: for Trump opponents, the presence of a\nblack (versus a white) racial cue will (a) increase sup-\nport for government housing assistance, (b) decrease\nanger towards people receiving government assistance,\nand (c) decrease their belief that individuals are to blame\nfor their situation.\nFinally, we examine whether it was Donald Trump\nalone--and not also Hillary Clinton--whose candidacy\ndivided the electorate on the basis of responsiveness to\nracial cues. Given his clear racial and ethno-nationalist\nappeals--for example, about President Obama's country of\norigin, his support for a Muslim ban, the state of theAfrican\nAmerican community, and negative comments about\nMexicans--Trump is similar to other explicitly ethnocen-\ntric white candidates who appealed to individuals high in\nracial resentment, such as Pat Buchanan (e.g., Sears et al.,\n1997). Thus, we expect that responsiveness to racial cues\nwill vary as a function of feelings about Trump, but not\nfeelings about Clinton. Finally, we examine the robustness\nof our findings by examining whether traditional political\npredispositions--partisanship and ideology--can account\nfor our Trump-moderated experimental findings.\nIn short, we examine whether Trump supporters and\nopponents exhibit distinct reactions to experimentally pro-\nvided racial cues when forming attitudes related to social\nwelfare and deservingness, and whether racial appeals can\nwork to further polarize Trump supporters from opponents.\nWe find strong support for both hypotheses; moreover, we\nfind that the impact of racial cues varies solely as a function\nof feelings about Donald Trump--and not feelings about\nhis Democratic opponent, partisanship, or ideology. In sum,\nwe provide causal evidence that when racial cues are sali-\nent in the environment, Trump supporters and opponents\nhave fundamentally different reactions and become even\nmore divided.\nData and methods\nTo provide a test of the theory that racial cues increase atti-\ntude polarization between Trump supporters and oppo-\nnents, we conducted an experiment using a national sample\nof 2020 respondents who completed the first two waves of\nan Internet panel study. The data were collected through\nSurvey Sampling International. Of the respondents who\ncompleted Wave 2, 964 were randomly assigned to receive\nthe stimuli for the current experiment.1 Given the very low\nsupport for Donald Trump among African Americans,\nAsian Americans, and Latinx, our analyses include only the\nwhite respondents who completed the experiment; this pro-\nduced a final sample of n = 746. Details about the study\nsample can be found in Appendix A, and details about the\nstimuli and measures can be found in Appendix B.\nExperimental stimuli and dependent variables\nTo examine the influence of racial cues, our experiment\nmeasured support for a federal mortgage-assistance pro-\ngram in the presence of either a black or a white racial cue,\nsignaled by the presence of a black man (n = 370) or a white\nman (n = 376) standing next to a foreclosure sign.\nAs Figure 1 shows, the activation of racial categories\nwas subtle; no attention was called to the photo, and neither\nthe instructions nor the dependent measures made any ref-\nerence to the individual depicted in the photo. Respondents\nwere randomly assigned to either the black or white photo\ncondition. The experiment was introduced with brief text\nLuttig et al. 3\nand was accompanied by a photo of a foreclosed home and\nthe black or white target individual. The introductory text\nread: \"Recently there have been proposals to help people\nwho are struggling with their mortgages and may lose their\nhomes.\" Participants then indicated their support for the\nmortgage-relief program, whether the possibility of such\nhelp made them angry, and the extent to which they blamed\npotential beneficiaries of the program for their own pre-\ndicament. Responses to these items served as the dependent\nvariables and were rescaled to run from 0 to 1, with higher\nscores indicating greater policy opposition (M = 0.52,\n0.28). We find no direct treatment effects of the white ver-\nsus black racial cue on these dependent variables: policy\nTo establish that our experimental treatment did, how-\never, polarize respondents on the basis of racial attitudes,\nwe estimated a series of models interacting treatment\nassignment with racial resentment, ethnocentrism, and per-\nceptions of white disadvantage (along with control varia-\nbles). These results show that our manipulation of race did\nlead to distinct reactions among racial liberals and conserv-\natives, as measured by multiple indicators of racial bias\n(see online Appendix Tables A2 to A4).\nIndependent variables\nBesides a dummy variable for experimental condition, we\ninclude the following independent variables (unless indi-\ncated, all were measured in Wave 1 and rescaled to run from\n0 to 1). Trump favorability was assessed using repeated\nfeeling-thermometer ratings from Waves 1 and 2 of the sur-\nvey; these items correlated highly (Pearson's r = 0.80), so\nbility was similarly assessed with repeated feeling thermom-\nWe control for basic demographics: age (left in its original\nmetric), income (rescaled to run 0 to 1), sex, education\n(seven ordered categories, rescaled to run 0 to 1), and\nemployment status (1 = unemployed). However, we note\nthat the results are not substantially changed when no con-\ntrol variables whatsoever are included (see online Appendix\nTable A1).\nResults\nTo test whether the effects of racial cues varied directly as\na function of white respondents' opinions of Donald\nTrump, we estimated a series of ordinary-least squares\nregression models. Each dependent variable was regressed\non Trump favorability, a dummy variable representing cue\ncondition (0 = white, 1 = black), and the interaction\nbetween the two, along with the aforementioned controls.\nWe also compare the extent to which responses to racial\ncues differed as a function of Trump favorability--as\nopposed to Clinton favorability--during the 2016 presi-\ndential election by including an additional interaction\nbetween cue condition and our measure of Clinton favora-\nbility. To guard against heteroscedasticity, HC3 robust\nstandard errors were used in all analyses (Long and Ervin,\nIn each model, the coefficient for the Trump Favorability\n\u00d7 Racial Cue interaction provides the critical test of our\nhypothesis that attitudes toward Donald Trump moderate\nthe impact of racial cues on political judgment. This interac-\ntion is significant and correctly signed for all three depend-\nent variables: opposition to mortgage assistance (b = 0.20, p\nblaming targets of the assistance for their own situation (b =\n0.21, p < 0.01). By contrast, attitudes toward Hillary Clinton\nfailed to moderate the impact of the racial cues for any of the\ndependent variables (i.e., the interaction between Clinton\nfavorability and cue condition fails to reach significance in\nany of the models). Furthermore, tests constraining the two\ncoefficients to equality indicated that the coefficient for the\ninteraction between Trump favorability and the racial cue is\nFigure 1. Stimuli from the racial-cue conditions: (a) white\ncondition. (b) black condition.\n4 Research and Politics \nsignificantly stronger than the coefficient for the interaction\nbetween Clinton favorability and the racial cue for anger\nstronger for opposing mortgage assistance (p < 0.10, one-\ntailed). These findings indicate that responses to the racial\ncue varied as a function of feelings about Donald Trump--\nbut not feelings about Hillary Clinton--during the 2016\npresidential election.4\nTo unpack these interactions, we estimated conditional\neffects for the racial-cue manipulation across the full range\nof Trump favorability values from the most negative evalu-\nation (0) to the most positive (1). These conditional-effect\nestimates are plotted in Figure 2; values on the y-axis rep-\nresent the effect estimates and can be interpreted as the pro-\nportion change in each dependent variable associated with\nmoving from the white-cue condition to the black-cue con-\ndition. For the mortgage help policy question, opposition\nwas greater in the black condition than the white condition\nwhen Trump evaluations were at their most favorable, b =\nblack versus the white condition when Trump evaluations\n0.10). Similarly, for the anger rating, anger was higher in\nthe black than the white condition when Trump favorability\nlower in the black condition than in the white condition\nwhen Trump favorability was at its minimum, b = -0.09\nvariable, respondents were more likely to blame beneficiar-\nies for their own plight in the black condition compared to\nthe white condition when Trump evaluations were at their\nlikely to do so in the black versus the white condition when\nTrump evaluations were at their least favorable, b = -0.10\nports both hypotheses 1 and 2.\nFigure 3 presents the conditional-effect estimates--\nmoving from the white to the black racial cue on all three\ndependent variables--across levels of support for Hillary\nClinton. As Figure 3 shows, at no level of Clinton support\ndoes cue condition affect support for government housing,\nanger at beneficiaries, or blaming beneficiaries for their\nTable 1.

Thus, it is support for Donald Trump--not Hillary\nClinton--that captures differences in reaction to racial cues\nin the environment.\nRobustness analyses. Does support for Donald Trump\nuniquely capture distinct reactions to our cue manipula-\ntion, or does this pattern of polarization simply reflect the\ndeep-seated partisan and ideological divide in American\npolitics? In Table 2, we present a model in which we also\ninteract our experimental treatment with partisanship and\nideology, two other central predispositions related to\nTrump support. Our results are highly similar with these\ninteractions included.5 Support for Donald Trump--not\npartisanship or ideology--uniquely captures distinct reac-\ntions to our experimental manipulation of race (i.e. neither\nthe partisanship-by-race-cue manipulation nor the ideol-\nogy-by-race-cue manipulation is significant).6 This indi-\ncates that Trump support is not merely a proxy for\nlong-standing ideological and partisan divides in respon-\nsiveness to racial cues. That is, support for Donald Trump\nappears to serve as a basis for polarized responses to racial\ncues in its own regard.\nFinally, we examine feelings about Donald Trump as a\nmoderator of our racial manipulation while controlling for\nthe interaction between the experimental manipulation and\nFigure 2. Effects of racial cue as a function of Trump support.\nNote: points on the lines represent the conditional effect of the racial cue on each dependent variable for respondents at a particular rating of\nDonald Trump; the black horizontal line in the graphs represents the zero point (i.e. no difference between the black and white racial-cue condi-\ntions); the dotted lines represent 95% confidence intervals around the conditional-effect estimate. Each conditional effect can be interpreted as the\nproportion change in the dependent variable associated with moving from the white-cue condition to the black-cue condition.\nFigure 3.

Each conditional effect can be interpreted as the propor-\ntion change in the dependent variable associated with moving from the white-cue condition to the black-cue condition.\n6 Research and Politics \nracial resentment, ethnocentrism, and perceptions of white\ndisadvantage. Because these racial attitudes measures are\nhighly correlated, we analyze these results with each racial\nattitude measure included separately (to protect against\nmulticollinearity). The results are presented in the online\nAppendix Tables A6 to A8. We find that the Trump\nFavorability \u00d7 Racial Cue interaction continues to be sig-\nnificant in each of these analyses. Moreover, in each case,\nthe interaction involving the racial attitude variable and the\ncue manipulation is reduced in significance. What are we to\nmake of these findings? In our view, they suggest that feel-\nings about Donald Trump mediate the effect of racial atti-\ntudes in response to racial cues in the environment. That is,\nTrump supporters and opponents may respond differently\nto racial cues because of prior differences in racial attitudes.\nBecause they are learned early in childhood and adoles-\ncence (Sears, 1993), racial attitudes should be exogenous to\nattitudes toward Donald Trump--who was a novel (but\nracialized and highly salient) political stimulus in the con-\ntext of the 2016 election. Therefore, attitudes toward Trump\nmost likely serve as a proximal variable--in the sense of\ncoloring other political judgments--in conveying the\nimpact of racial attitudes on downstream political judg-\nments. In sum, these results continue to show that feelings\nabout Donald Trump directly capture a distinct and highly\nsalient expression of differences between racial liberals and\nconservatives, as indicated by their polarized response to\nour subtle experimental manipulation of race.\nTable 2. Racialization of mortgage-program attitudes as a function of Trump favorability, not ideology or party identification.\nPredictors Oppose Help Anger Individual Blame\nHC3 robust standard errors in parentheses.\nNote: entries are ordinary least squares (OLS) regression coefficients.\nLuttig et al. 7\nDiscussion and conclusion\nAcross all three dependent variables, our hypotheses\nreceived clear support. Among citizens with favorable\nviews of Donald Trump, black racial cues increased oppo-\nsition to mortgage assistance, anger at such assistance, and\nthe tendency to blame policy targets for their own plight. In\ncontrast, among citizens with unfavorable views of Donald\nTrump, black racial cues had the opposite effect: decreased\nopposition to mortgage assistance, anger, and individual\nblame. Importantly, these effects were exclusive to atti-\ntudes toward Trump: effects of the racial cue did not differ\naccording to feelings about Hillary Clinton. Thus, Trump\nsupporters and opponents respond in fundamentally differ-\nent ways to racial cues in the environment.\nThese findings underscore the extent to which supporters\nand opponents of Donald Trump respond in a polarized fash-\nion to the salience of racial cues. These distinct dynamics of\nracialization suggest that when race becomes salient in pub-\nlic discourse, support for Donald Trump will serve as a ful-\ncrum for divergent policy judgments. Thus, to the extent that\nrace-related issues remain at the top of the public agenda,\nsupporters and opponents of Donald Trump are likely to\nbecome even more divided in their policy judgments, emo-\ntional reactions to policy proposals, and perceptions of social\ngroups that are likely to be helped (or hurt) by various poli-\ncies. Together with recent findings suggesting that racial atti-\ntudes are a key correlate of evaluations of Donald Trump\nthe continuing centrality of race as a contributor to polariza-\ntion in American political life. In this regard, we join other\nanalysts (e.g., Tesler, 2016c) in doubting that the develop-\nments of the present era--as momentous as they are--have\ntruly brought about a \"post-racial\" America.\nWe conclude with a few suggestions for future research.\nFirst, our study merely establishes that going from white to\nblack racial cues produces fundamentally distinct reactions\namong Trump supporters and opponents in their support for\ngovernment housing assistance, anger about said assis-\ntance, and blaming individuals for their struggles. However,\nit cannot determine whether Trump supporters and oppo-\nnents are differentially reacting primarily to the white or\nblack racial-cue condition (or both). This is an important\ndistinction that future work should investigate by examin-\ning reactions to black cues and white cues relative to an\nadditional non-racialized control condition. Second, future\nresearch should examine the effect of racial cues in the con-\ntext of policies Trump has expressed more support for. For\nexample, Trump--in contrast to other Republicans--prom-\nised to preserve Medicaid during the 2016 campaign. Thus,\nit would be interesting to see whether cues implying that\nthis program benefited disliked outgroups were as effective\nin reducing support among Trump supporters. A result of\nthis sort would suggest that the identity-based antecedents\nof Trump support may be capable of turning his voters\nagainst even those policies he has clearly endorsed. These\nand other questions await examination.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nSupplementary materials\nThe supplementary files are available at http://journals.sagepub.\nNotes\n1. Random assignment appears to have been successful, as we\nfind no significant differences across the black and white\ntreatment conditions in terms of age, income, gender, educa-\ntion, employment status, Trump favorability, Clinton favora-\nbility, ideology, or partisanship.\n2. Results were identical when using three alternate indices\nof Trump support: (a) a dummy variable indicating that the\nrespondent intended to vote for Trump (vs. Clinton) in a cat-\negorical candidate-choice question from Wave 2 (available\nin online Appendix Table A5); (b) a favorability measure\nbased only on the Trump thermometer from Wave 1; (c) a\nfavorability measure based only on the Trump thermometer\nfrom Wave 2 (these latter two results available upon request).\n3.

We once again find in this analysis that the coefficient for\nthe interaction between Trump favorability and the racial cue\nis significantly stronger than the coefficient for the interac-\ntion between Clinton favorability and the racial cue for anger\n(p < 0.05) and individual blame (p < 0.10), but in this case\nnot for opposing mortgage assistance.\n6. The one exception is a marginally significant and negative\ninteraction between partisanship and the racial cue on indi-\nvidual blame.\nCarnegie Corporation of New York Grant\nThis publication was made possible (in part) by a grant from\nCarnegie Corporation of New York.
