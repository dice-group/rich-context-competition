A higher proportion of females (25%) re-\nported depressive symptoms than males (10%). Preva-\nlence of depressive symptoms increased by age for both\nmales and females. Among American Indian youths, 29%\nreported depressive symptoms, as compared with 22% of\nof African American youths. Youths who were frequently\ninvolved in bullying, either as perpetrators or as victims,\nwere more than twice as likely to report depressive symp-\ntoms than those who were not involved in bullying.

In addition to an increased risk\nof suicide, youths who are depressed are at a higher risk\nfor mental disorders such as anxiety, conduct disorders,\nand substance abuse. They are also more likely than other\nyouths to engage in unsafe sexual practices and other risk\nto experience difficulty relating to peers and are more\nlikely than others to be involved in physical fights with\npeers.8,14,15 The difficulties they face in their peer rela-\ntionships and their tendency toward violent behavior are\nnot well understood; however, there is some overlap be-\ntween the issues faced by youths who are depressed and\nthose faced by youths involved in aggressive behaviors\nsuch as bullying.\nBullying has recently been recognized as a com-\nmon behavior among young adolescents.16 Like youths\nwho are depressed, those adolescents who are involved\nin bullying, both as victims and as perpetrators, experi-\nence poor psychosocial and emotional adjustment, dif-\nficulty making friends, and increased loneliness.16 Given\nthe high prevalence of bullying behaviors and the risks\nthat both the victims and the perpetrators of bullying en-\ncounter, the relationship between bullying and depres-\nsion merits examination.\nRecognizing depression as early as possible could\nbe a critical step to reducing the prevalence of depres-\nsion among older individuals, managing depression more\neffectively, and preventing negative outcomes. A num-\nber of important issues need further investigation to aid\nearly diagnosis. Because most studies on adolescent de-\npression have focused on high school students, the preva-\nlence of depressive symptoms in younger adolescents (ie,\nmiddle school children) is not well established. Few stud-\nies have included middle school youths, and each has had\nmethodological limitations, ranging from small sample\nsize and the inability to study certain ethnic groups to\nvaried indicators of depression.17-19 Thus, to recognize de-\npression among youths as early as possible, further re-\nsearch is needed.\nIn the present study, we use data from a school-\nbased national survey to explore the prevalence of de-\npressive symptoms in young adolescents. We sought to\nanswer the following questions1: What is the prevalence\nof depressive symptoms in US youths aged 11 to 15 years?2\nAnd to what extent are substance use, involvement in bul-\nlying, and somatic symptoms associated with depres-\nsive symptoms in this age range?\nMETHODS\nThe Health Behavior in School Children Study is a multina-\ntional, cross-sectional, school-based survey of adolescents in\nin collaboration with the World Health Organization Regional\nOffice for Europe (Copenhagen, Denmark). Data are collected\nthrough a cluster sample design in which schools and class-\nrooms are selected so that nationally representative samples are\nobtained. The anonymous survey includes questions on fam-\nily structure, diet, exercise, self-image, injuries, safety behav-\niors, academic performance and pressures, attitudes about\nschool, fighting and bullying, and substance use.\nIn 1996, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration (Rockville, Md) and the National Institute of\nChild Health and Human Development (Rockville) supported\na survey, conducted by Macro International Inc (Calverton, Md),\nof young adolescents that was based on the Health Behavior in\nSchool Children Study. Compared with previous and subse-\nquent Health Behavior in School Children surveys, the 1996\nUS survey included more detailed information than the inter-\nnational quadrennial surveys about mental health and behav-\nior, including depressive symptoms and risk behaviors. Thus,\ndata from this survey are used to report and characterize de-\npressive symptoms among US youths. Parents/guardians of stu-\ndents were sent a letter describing the survey and were given\nthe opportunity to decline their child's participation. Eighty-\nseven percent of the students responded. The survey was con-\nducted with the approval and oversight of the institutional re-\nview boards of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services\nAdministration and Macro International Inc.\nThis study applied a 3-stage cluster design in which the\nschool district was the primary sampling unit or first stage, the\nschool was the second stage, and the classroom was the third\nstage. The universe for the study consisted of public and pri-\nvate schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data\nself-administered questionnaire containing 114 questions. Ex-\ncluded from the study sample were students with substantial\nmissing data (n=25), multiple responses on or missing grade\ninformation (n=65), and multiple responses on or missing sex\ninformation (n=10). The final analytic sample consisted of 9863\nUS students. African American, Hispanic, and Asian Ameri-\ncan youths were oversampled to provide national estimates for\nunderrepresented racial and ethnic groups.\nThe weighted sample of 9863 students was split almost\nmajority of students were classified as non-Hispanic white youths\n(48%), followed by those classified as Hispanic (28.2%), non-\nHispanic African American (13.6%), non-Hispanic Asian Ameri-\ncan (8.7%), and non-Hispanic American Indian/Pacific Islander\nVARIABLES\nThe questionnaire included items on health-related behaviors\nin the context of students' families, schools, and peers. The fol-\nlowing variables were examined in the present study.\nDepressive Symptoms\nThe questionnaire included 2 items on depression. The first item\nasked students to indicate if they ever felt sad, blue, down, or\ndepressed almost every day for 2 or more consecutive weeks\nduring the past 12 months. The second item asked students to\nrespond yes or no to 10 statements describing what they might\nhave experienced when they were feeling depressed during the\npast 12 months. These statements were taken from the Diag-\nnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third\nEdition (DSM-III-R) criteria for depression.20 Using these cri-\nteria, we created a dichotomous indicator of depressive symp-\ntoms. According to the DSM-III-R, an individual is depressed\nif at least 5 of 9 criteria are met (ie, present during the past 2\nweeks). Two of the 9 criteria were excluded from this ques-\ntionnaire (psychomotor agitation or retardation and fatigue or\nloss of energy almost every day) because the authors of the ques-\ntionnaire believed that these criteria would be difficult to ac-\n\u00a92004 American Medical Association.

The remaining\n7 criteria were translated into the 10 response items (Figure).\nBullying\nStudents were asked to report the number of times per week\nthat they had been bullied or had bullied others at school dur-\ning the past 12 months.\nRisk Behaviors\nWith regard to substance use, students were asked if they ever\nsmoked tobacco, drank alcohol, or took other drugs (such as\nmarijuana, cocaine, inhalants, and hallucinogens). If they an-\nswered yes to the questions on alcohol and smoking, they were\nasked to indicate how often they used these substances in the\npast month.\nWith regard to somatic symptoms, students were pro-\nvided with a list of physical ailments (eg, headache, stomach-\nache, and backache) and asked to indicate whether or not they\nexperienced each ailment once a week.\nFor purposes of analysis, 2 sets of depression response items\nwere collapsed: the 2 dealing with lack of sleep and excess sleep\n(sleep disturbance) and the 2 dealing with weight loss and weight\ngain (weight disturbance). Individuals were classified as re-\nporting depressive symptoms if at least 5 of the 8 statements\nin the Figure were true. After depressive symptom status was\ndetermined, we calculated the prevalence of depressive symp-\ntoms for all grade, sex, and racial/ethnic subgroups. Next, we\ncalculated the prevalence of depressive symptoms according\nto the status of bullying behaviors. Finally, we calculated the\nprevalence of depressive symptoms for substance abuse and so-\nmatic symptoms and compared these by status of substance\nabuse and somatic symptoms. We stratified all analyses by sex.\nWe calculated 95% confidence intervals for the estimated preva-\nlence ratio to compare prevalence of depressive symptoms across\nbullying behaviors, substance use, and somatic ailments.\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS software (version\n8.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Analyses are weighted by the prob-\nability of the selection to produce national estimates. SUDAAN\n(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) was\nused for variance estimates to account for sample design.\nRESULTS\nAbout 1 in 6 US youths reported depressive symptoms\n(Table 1). Prevalence of depressive symptoms was higher\namong females than males; however, prevalence in both\nsexes increased with grade level. For boys, prevalence al-\nmost doubled between 6th and 10th grades. For girls,\nprevalence nearly tripled between 6th and 10th grades\n(Table 1). Prevalence of depressive symptoms varied by\nracial/ethnic group, and prevalence among females in all\nracial/ethnic groups was consistently higher than among\nmales. Among males and females, those classified as\nAmerican Indian/Alaskan Native and Hispanic had the\nhighest prevalence of depressive symptoms, followed by\nthose classified as white. Those classified as African Ameri-\ncan had the lowest prevalence, followed by Asian Ameri-\ncan youths (Table 1).\nWith regard to bullying and depression, the pro-\nportion of youths reporting depressive symptoms in-\ncreased with increased involvement in bullying, both as\nthe bullies and as the victims (Table 2). This was true\nfor males and females. Thirty-seven percent of females\nwho were bullied more than twice in the preceding year\nreported depressive symptoms, compared with nearly 18%\nof similar males. Nearly 46% of females involved in bul-\nlying others more than twice in the preceding year re-\nported depressive symptoms, compared with 15% of simi-\nlar males (Table 2).\nFemales and males who reported using substances\nhad significantly higher proportions of depressive symp-\ntoms than those who did not report using substances\n(Table 3). This pattern was true for all measured sub-\nstances. Prevalence of depressive symptoms was much\nhigher among female substance users than male sub-\nstance users. With regard to somatic symptoms, females\nand males who reported having somatic symptoms 1 or\nmore times a week had a significantly greater preva-\nlence of depressive symptoms than those who did not re-\nport having these symptoms as often (Table 4).\nCOMMENT\nThis study indicates that the prevalence of depression\namong young adolescents, particularly female adoles-\ncents, may be higher than previous estimates. Although\nprevious research has shown a high rate of depression\namong adolescents, most studies have been conducted\non older adolescents, particularly high school and col-\nlege students. We found that the prevalence of depres-\nsive symptoms among females in this age range was ap-\nproximately double that among males. Previous research\non sex differences and depression has also shown that\ndepression is more prevalent among females than males;\nhowever, this study suggests that sex differences among\nadolescents who are depressed may emerge earlier than\nprevious research has suggested.\nAs expected, the prevalence of depressive symp-\ntoms among adolescents increased with age. The in-\ncrease was far more severe for females than males, as was\nevidenced by the doubled prevalence from sixth to eighth\ngrade. The increase among males, though less striking,\nwas also notable, indicating a rapid emergence of de-\npressive symptoms among youths in middle school.\nAlthough Native American, Hispanic, and white stu-\ndents, especially girls, reported more depressive symp-\ntoms as compared with Asian American and African\nAmerican students, findings from previous studies on de-\nWhen you felt sad, blue, down, or depressed for 2 weeks or more, which of the following\nwas true about you?

Some stud-\nies have shown minimal differences among ethnic groups\nwith regard to depression,21 whereas other studies have\nfound depression to be more prevalent among African\nAmerican adolescents than other adolescents,8 and still\nothers have found it to be less prevalent among African\nAmerican youths.22 Data on depression among Hispanic\nyouths have been mixed,23,24 and previous research on\nAsian American adolescents has shown that Asian Ameri-\ncan adolescents are at a high risk for depression.25\nTable 1.

All rights reserved.\nGiven the variability in results, these questions warrant\nfurther research.\nThe association between bullying and depression is\nnotable. Although the prevalence of involvement in bul-\nlying both as victims and as perpetrators was high, those\nwho reported being involved more frequently had higher\nproportions of depression. Regarding those youths who\nare bullied, one might expect that an individual who is\nbullied frequently could develop feelings of social isola-\ntion, leading to depression. Further, those youths who\nare depressed might lack social skills, making them an\neasy target for bullying. The association between bullies\nand depression is less obvious. Previous research has\nfound that those who bullied do not appear to be so-\ncially isolated,16 nor do they appear to suffer from psy-\nchosomatic or depressive symptoms26; however, an-\nother study reported that those who bully are at an\nincreased risk for depression and suicide.27 One pos-\nsible explanation as to why those who bully may be at\nan increased risk for depression and suicide is that they\nmay have had more exposure to familial violence or abuse.\nClearly, this topic requires further investigation.\nThe association between risk behaviors and depres-\nsive symptoms in this study are consistent with previ-\nous research on older adolescents. Youths who reported\nusing substances were more likely to report depressive\nsymptoms than other youths, suggesting that those who\nuse substances might be self-medicating, even at this\nyoung age. We should also consider the possibility that\nsubstance use may actually precede the onset of depres-\nsive symptoms, as suggested by previous research.28 Fur-\nthermore, youths who reported suffering from frequent\nsomatic symptoms were more likely to report depres-\nsive symptoms than other youths. Previous research has\nfound that girls are more likely than boys to admit to in-\nternalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety.\nIn contrast, boys have a greater tendency to externalize\nsymptoms through \"acting out.\"29 Thus, the higher pro-\nportion of females reporting somatic symptoms is not\nsurprising.\nSeveral strengths of this study should be noted. First,\nthe large sample size of this study places it among the\nlargest nationally representative studies on youths and\ndepression. Also, the sampling strategy was designed so\nthat reliable estimates could be made for ethnic minori-\nties, including African American, Asian American, and\nHispanic individuals. Unlike several past studies, depres-\nsion was assessed using criteria outlined by the Ameri-\ncan Psychological Association. Although the data were\ncollected in 1996, we do not believe that the age of the\ndata has a bearing on the interpretation of the results.\nThe criteria used to diagnose depression have not changed\nin recent years. We do not suspect that any secular trends\nwould have affected the rates of reporting depressive\nsymptoms during the past 8 years; however, even if the\nprevalence of depressive symptoms has changed, the re-\nlationship between depression and associated risk fac-\ntors is unlikely to have been affected.\nReaders should note, however, that a DSM-III-R di-\nagnosis of MDD includes the stipulation that the de-\npressed mood was present \"most of the day, nearly ev-\nery day\" during a 2-week period and that the depression\ncaused significant distress or impairment in daily func-\ntioning. Additionally, the DSM-III-R was designed to as-\nsess depression among adults. Although the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has under-\ngone rigorous psychometric testing, this particular ques-\ntionnaire did not undergo such testing. Because of these\nfactors, combined with the fact that the present study did\nnot include a clinical examination of each respondent,\nreaders should note that the results of this study reflect\nthe prevalence of depressive symptoms, not clinical de-\npression. Given the self-report method of data collec-\ntion and the fact that only 7 of 9 depression criteria were\nincluded in the survey, it is possible that the data pre-\nsented in this study actually underreport the prevalence\nof depressive symptoms.\nResults from this study suggest that depression is a\nsubstantial problem facing young adolescents. The study\nhighlights the need for more intervention at the middle\nTable 4.

Because depressive symptoms are likely to\ncoexist with other adolescent problem behaviors, such\nas bullying and substance use, young adolescents who\nare involved in such behaviors might be depressed as well.\nYouths who suffer from frequent somatic symptoms (eg,\nfrequent absenteeism and/or complaints of headaches and\nother physical symptoms) are more likely to be de-\npressed. Practitioners who work with youths who have\nsuch symptoms/behaviors should consider screening them\nfor depression; successful treatment of depression could\nlead to many other positive health and behavioral out-\ncomes for these youths. Increased awareness of depres-\nsion among this age group is the first step toward imple-\nmenting effective intervention.\nCorrespondence: Gitanjali Saluja, PhD, Division of Epi-\ndemiology, Statistics, and Prevention Research, National In-\nREFERENCES\n1.

In the United States, studies estimate\nthe prevalence of depression among older adolescents\nto be as high as 8.3%. Much less is known about preva-\nlence of and risk factors for depression among young ado-\nlescents. Results of this study show that nearly 20% of\nyoung adolescents in the United States report symp-\ntoms consistent with depression. Furthermore, youths\ninvolved in behaviors such as bullying and substance use\nand youths who report frequent somatic complaints have\nhigher rates of depressive symptoms than other youths.\nResults of this study suggest that depression mani-\nfests itself in many ways that might not appear obvious\nin young adolescents. Thus, practitioners who work with\nyouths who have such symptoms/behaviors should con-\nsider screening for depression. Depression is a substan-\ntial and largely unrecognized problem facing young ado-\nlescents, and more intervention is needed at the middle\nschool level.\n\u00a92004 American Medical Association.
