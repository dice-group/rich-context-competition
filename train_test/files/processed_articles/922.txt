We examine age differences in adults' participation in, perceived barriers to, and institutional support for\neducational activities provided by schools, businesses, and community organizations in the 1990s.\nMethods. We conduct descriptive and logistic regression analyses on a sample of respondents aged 30 to 74 from the\nNational Household Education Surveys.\nResults. Adult education participation rates increased for all ages over the 1990s, but gains were proportionately\nlargest among people in later phases of the life course. Although age was a weaker predictor of engaging in educational\nactivities at the end of the 1990s than it was at the beginning of the decade, older adults continue to be less likely than\nyounger ones to participate in education and training provided by businesses and schools. Some of this age discrepancy\noccurs because employers are more likely to provide financial support for training to younger employees. Older adults,\nhowever, are less likely than younger adults to perceive obstacles to their participation in education and training.\nDiscussion. Although age-graded roles of student, worker, and retiree are becoming increasingly blurred, Ameri-\ncans' pursuit of education at the end of the twentieth century was still guided by age-related role expectations.\nVER the past 30 years, middle-aged and older adult\nlearners have emerged as a major constituency in vari-\nrollment of full and part-time students aged 35 and older in\ntion in vocational training and work-related courses has\ngrown at an even faster rate (Elman, 1998). Institutes for\nlearning in retirement, senior centers, and community col-\nleges have increased educational opportunities for senior\nadults, as well (Manheimer, 1998). This trend of expanding\nadult education suggests that we may be moving toward a\nmore age-integrated society in which people of all ages have\naccess to learning in universities, technical institutes, places\nof employment, and community organizations. We cannot\nassert this conclusion, however, because the paucity of\nscholarly attention to later life education leaves many unan-\nswered questions. Did education over the past decade be-\ncome a significantly more common experience for adults in\nlater life? Which education providers contributed most to\nthe trend in adult education participation rates and which\ncontributed least? What differentiates older adults who pur-\nsue educational activities from those who do not? Do older\npeople face particular barriers to adult education that\nyounger adults do not?\nEducation Surveys (NHESs), this article addresses those\nquestions by examining adults' participation in, perceived\nbarriers to, and institutional support of educational activi-\nties. We first examine the decade-long trend in adults' par-\nticipation in classes provided by schools, businesses, and\ncommunity organizations, and we compare trends across\nage categories. Next, we explore who is most likely to par-\nticipate in adult education, highlighting differences and sim-\nilarities by age group. Finally, we compare younger and\nolder adults' perceived barriers to adult education and ana-\nlyze differential institutional support for engaging in educa-\ntional activities.\nWhat Is Adult Education?\nAdult education is an expansive field and can be defined\negorization of learning systems has emerged, one that dis-\ntinguishes between formal, nonformal, and informal educa-\nUNESCO, 1972). Although boundaries between these defi-\nnitions may be blurry, the conceptual scheme reminds us\nthat education occurs both within and outside of school\nwalls. In this tripartite classification, formal education is the\nhierarchically structured, chronologically graded education\nsystem from primary school through university. It includes\ngeneral academic studies and a variety of specialized insti-\ntutes for technical and professional training. Nonformal ed-\nucation is any organized and intentional educational activity\nthat takes place outside of recognized educational institu-\ntions. Nonformal education occurs in libraries, businesses,\nsenior citizen centers, religious institutions, museums, labor\nunions, and various other organizations. Learners in these\nsettings may receive a certificate of completion, but are not\nusually seeking a degree or credential. Informal education is\na private process whereby individuals transform their daily\nexperiences and the educative resources in their environ-\nments into knowledge, skills, values, attitudes, and beliefs\n(Holford, Jarvis, & Griffin, 1998). Informal education tran-\nspires in the course of daily activity, such as from reading\nthe newspaper or interacting with family and friends.\nIn addition to examining the source and content of\nO\ninstruction, other researchers focus on adults' motivation\nfor pursuing education. Although some people engage in\nlearning for personal development (expressive orientation),\nothers direct their learning toward a specific outcome or ex-\nternal objective (instrumental orientation). A 1994 survey of\nadult learning, for example, found that 90% of Americans\naged 64 and younger who engaged in adult education did so\nfor career or job-related purposes (B\u00e9langer & Valdivielso,\n1997). Older employees, as well, are motivated to acquire\nnew skills and knowledge to remain productive workers\n(Bass & Caro, 2001). Older adults no longer in the work-\nforce may learn for personal enrichment and as a way to re-\nmain independent and socially engaged.\nAlthough we acknowledge the value of the multiple pur-\nposes for formal, nonformal, and informal education across\nthe life course, this paper does not examine people's motiva-\ntion to learn or informal educational activities. Self-directed\nlearning, social interaction, and \"edutainment\" through the\nInternet, how-to books, and informative TV programs are\nimportant ways to increase knowledge, awareness, and\nskills. Older adults especially may engage in and benefit\nfrom informal educational activities in which no instructor\nis involved. Because adult education is typically defined as\nstructured and institutionally based, however, our approach\nin this paper is to focus on adults' participation in formal\neducation provided by credential programs and nonformal\neducation provided by business, industry, and community-\nbased organizations.\nWho Participates and Why?\nucation provided by high school or college degree programs;\n1962 survey reported that 22% of adults participated in some\ntype of adult education (Johnstone & Rivera, 1965); reports\nfrom the 1990s indicate that more than 40% of adults partic-\nipated (Kim & Creighton, 1999). The most striking increase\nin adult education participation rates occurred among the\nnontraditional student population. In 1970, for example, less\nthan 10% of students in degree-granting institutions were\nThere are numerous reasons for this rise in the number of\nolder students. An upward shift in the age distribution ac-\ncounts for much of the change (Jacobs & Stoner-Eby, 1998).\nAs the baby boom cohort aged, the size of the adult popula-\ntion grew more rapidly than the population of traditional-\naged students. But age-specific rates of participation also\nincreased as the baby boom cohort moved into the stage of\nlife where education traditionally was uncommon. The baby\nboom cohort was more highly educated than preceding co-\nhorts, and education level is positively related to participa-\ntion in adult education. Furthermore, changes in jobs and\nthe development of new technology stimulated more inter-\nAs demand for later life education grew, new programs\noffered educational opportunities for older adults and exist-\ning institutions adapted to meet the changing sociopolitical\nclimate and older learners' needs and interests. During the\nto older adults, due in part to a general emphasis on youth\nculture and widely held expectations of age-related cogni-\ntive declines, which were supported by prevailing research\n(Manheimer, 1998). Since then, however, the creative and\nlearning potential of the aging population has become rec-\nognized. Viewing aging as a problem education could help\nprograms containing the knowledge and skills needed to\nhandle the challenges of aging. By the early 1980s, older\nadults could take tuition-free public college courses in 38\nstates. Since the 1980s, federal and state governments have\nplayed a limited role in the burgeoning growth of older\nlearners. Despite a 22% inflation-adjusted increase in spend-\ning by the U.S. Department of Education between 1990 and\n2000, federal funds for vocational and adult education de-\nfor adult education dries up, older learners have experienced\nthe national trend toward privatization in education. Increas-\ning numbers of private organizations--such as travel agen-\ncies, corporations, college alumni organizations, brokerage\nfirms, and computer network clubs--offer educational oppor-\ntunities to healthy, affluent older adults (Manheimer, 1998).\nIn fact, providing educative experiences to middle- and upper-\nincome older persons has become a lucrative industry.\nIn response to changing demographic, social, and eco-\nnomic conditions, institutions of higher education are in the\nprocess of opening their doors to a broader sector of stu-\ndents (Oliver, 1999). Influenced by prevailing ideals of\nsocial inclusion, universities seek to widen the participation\nof groups who have been traditionally underrepresented on\ncollege campuses. Older adults, for example, may for a\nsmall fee attend class through a college-based Elderhostel\nprogram or an Institute for Learning in Retirement.\nNot all people, however, seek or benefit from the growing ed-\nucational opportunities (Elman, 1998; Manheimer, Snodgrass,\nhave shown that rates vary greatly by educational attain-\nucation or less participated in some program of adult educa-\ntion, compared with 31% of high school graduates, 57% of\nbachelor's degree graduates, and 59% of people with mas-\nter's degrees (Snyder, Hoffman, & Geddes, 1997). The op-\nportunity to participate in adult learning is unbalanced\nbetween other social strata based on sex, race, and income\nIn addition to these influences on differential participa-\ntion rates, previous research has shown that older adults are\nnot as likely as younger people to engage in organized\nforms of adult education (B\u00e9langer & Valdivielso, 1997).\nOlder adults receive less training at work and are often dis-\nplaced by younger employees. These findings support Matilda\nWhite Riley's age stratification theory (Riley, 1987), which\nbegins with the assumption that age, like gender and race, is\na basis for grouping people into social categories and chan-\nneling them through different role expectations, opportunity\nstructures, and age-segregated social institutions (Riley,\ncourse (Kohli, 1986) into education, work, and leisure\nmapped onto the first, second, and last thirds of life is a\nsignificant barrier to educational experiences throughout\nadulthood (Settersten & Lovegreen, 1998). Our current ap-\nproach to education, for example, involves an intensive con-\ncentration in the first 25 years of life, but lacks systematic at-\ntempts to update skills and knowledge throughout adulthood.\nOther scholars (e.g., Settersten & Hagestad, 1996), how-\never, point to a growing relaxation of expected age-related\ntransitions and argue that age is becoming less relevant as a\ndeterminant of life course trajectories. Modell's (1989)\nwork, for example, examines the trend toward the loosening\nof the normative transition to adulthood. He highlights the\ncompeting forces that influence the sequencing and timing\nof life course transitions. On the one hand, people's lives are\nstructured by normative age expectations and roles, whereas\non the other hand there is a relaxation of expected age-related\ntransitions. In the case of education across the life course,\nwe predict that younger people are more likely to engage in\nformal educational programs, but that the association\nbetween involvement and age weakened over the 1990s.\nFurthermore, we predict that age differences are more\npronounced for enrollment in recognized educational in-\nstitutions (e.g., college courses) than nonformal educa-\ntion programs (e.g., Bible studies), which are more loosely\ntied to age-graded institutions.\nMETHODS\nData\nWe use data from the NHES to examine the relationship\nbetween demographic characteristics and participation in,\nperceived barriers to, and institutional support of adult edu-\ncation. The NHES is a system of telephone surveys that\nrandomly collects data representative of the noninstitution-\nalized U.S. civilian population. The Adult Education and\nLifelong Learning component of this survey was conducted\ninclude respondents aged 30\u00ad74 in both cross-sectional sur-\nvey years.\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES,\n1999) selected households using random digit dialing meth-\nods and collected data using computer-assisted telephone\ninterviewing procedures. To produce reliable estimates of\nthe targeted population's educational experiences, people of\ncolor and students were oversampled. Although 95% of all\nadults age 16 and older live in households with telephones\n(Brick, 1996), the failure to include persons who do not live\nin households with telephones could result in nonsampling\nerror. Because the complex sample design of the NHES de-\nviates from the assumption of simple random sampling and\nwould underestimate the variability of parameter estimates,\nwe use weighted data that adjust estimates for telephone\ncoverage and the oversampling of adult education partici-\npants and people of color. Based on the recommendations of\nthe NHES Data File User's Manual (1999), we adjust the\nsimple random sample standard error estimate by the root\ndesign effect.\nThere are several reasons why the NHES is an excellent\ndata source for exploring the decade-long trend of Ameri-\ncans' participation in adult education. First, it provides cur-\nrent data on adults' educational activities (the 1999 survey\nwas released in August 2000) that have not been thoroughly\nanalyzed. Second, the NHES is one of the few nationally re-\npresentative data sets that provides comprehensive informa-\ntion on adults' learning activities in organizations both inside\nand outside the formal education system. Although most\nsurveys of adult education neglect to examine the educa-\ntional activities of older adults, the NHES surveys respon-\ndents in their 60s and 70s. Finally, the repeated-measures\ndesign allows for trend analysis over the 1990s, and the\noversampling of racial and ethnic minorities increases the\nreliability of estimates for these groups.\nMeasures\nIn addition to extensive background, employment, and\nhousehold information, the surveys provide reliable estimates\nof adults' educational experiences in colleges, universities,\nvocational programs, basic skills classes, work-related train-\ning, and personal development courses. Because we are ex-\namining changes in participation across time, slight varia-\nnoted. In 1991, respondents were first asked about their full-\nand part-time enrollment in classes for credit toward a de-\ngree. Then they specified other adult education activities\nthey had participated in during the past 12 months. For the\nfour most recent classes, respondents identified who provided\nthe instruction. In 1999, respondents were asked about their\nparticipation in a series of education programs: English as a\nSecond Language, basic skills and General Educational\nDevelopment preparation, degree programs, job-related train-\ning, and personal interest courses. Similar to the 1991 sur-\nvey, respondents were then asked who provided the instruc-\ntion. For all survey years, we classify respondents as either\nparticipants (Yi\n 1) or nonparticipants (Yi\n 0) in adult edu-\ncation provided by schools (community colleges, vocational\nprograms, technical institutes, and 4-year colleges and uni-\nversities), business and industry, and community organiza-\ntions (public libraries, neighborhood centers, community\ngroups, and religious organizations).\nIn 1991, non-full-time students reported on barriers that\nprevented them from participating in adult education. For\neach of the following 10 potential obstacles, we created a\ndichotomous dependent variable to compare respondents\nwho perceived this barrier (Yi\n 1) to those who did not\n(Yi\n 0): too busy, family responsibilities, program costs, lo-\ncation of classes, class meeting time, limited course offer-\nings, lack of information about classes, no transportation,\nhealth problems or old age, and lack of interest in or desire\nto attend education programs.\nOur final set of dependent variables focus on the sources\nof financial support for adult education participants. For\neach educational activity, respondents specified whether they\npaid for the course(s) themselves (including loans), took\nfree classes, or received financial support from the govern-\nment or business and industry. Again, we created dichoto-\nmous measures of whether or not respondents (Yi\npaid for their educational activities through these various\nmeans. Independent variables of key interest are age, sex,\nrace/ethnicity (White vs. non-White), education level (no\nhigh school degree, high school degree, or college degree),\ntotal household income over the past year (10-point scale,\nmarital status (married vs. not married), and employment\nstatus (worked for pay or not).\nAnalytical Methods\nWe first use descriptive statistics to assess trends in adult\neducation over the past decade. Then we use multivariate re-\ngression analyses to explore the demographic determinants\nof participation in, perceived barriers to, and institutional\nsupport for various forms of adult education. Because we\ncode all dependent variables as dichotomous measures,\nwe use logistic regression analyses. In these models,\nwhere Pi\nis the probability that Yi\nis the\nprobability that Yi\n 0.  is the vector of estimated coeffi-\ncients, and Xi\nis the vector of observed linear predictors. The\npresented coefficients are exponentiated and refer to the\nodds of the dependent variable equaling one. Significant\npredictors with values greater than one multiply the odds,\nand significant predictors with values less than one decrease\nthe odds.\nRESULTS\nTrends in Adult Education During the 1990s\nThe rates at which adults in different age categories were\nshown in Table 1. Respondents are grouped in 8-year birth\ncohorts to facilitate answering questions about trends over\nthis decade. Looking across a row, one can see the age pattern\nin adult education in a particular year. Looking down the col-\numns, one can observe changes in participation rates for each\nagonals reveals changes for cohorts as they moved from one\nage category to the next over this time period.\nThe general age pattern of participating in adult educa-\ntion is similar in both years and for each type of program.\nlowed by continuous decline after that age (with one trivial\nlog\nPi\n\n---------------\n- \n~\nX\n~ i\n,\n\n~\n\nexception). The largest differences by age occur for educa-\ntion provided by schools or by business and industry, in\nwhich the oldest age category is only about one fifth as\nlikely to participate as the under 50 categories. Participation\nin the less formal educational activities provided by\nchurches and other community organizations also declines\nwith age, but not nearly so steeply. Despite the much her-\nalded dawning of a \"lifelong learning society,\" we find that\neven at the most recent date (1999), only one fifth of the\nyoung-old (66\u00ad74) reported that they had participated in any\neducational experience in the preceding year.\nhowever, suggests that considerable progress was made in\nextending the reach of adult education. With one minor ex-\nception, participation rates increased over the decade for\neach age category in each program type. By far the largest\nincrease in adult education occurred in programs provided\nby community organizations, where participation rates more\nthan doubled. Increases in these nonformal educational pro-\ngrams were fairly uniform across the age categories. For the\nother types (provided by schools or businesses), the largest\npercentage increases occurred for the two older age catego-\nries. Combining all types of adult education, the 66\u00ad74 age\ncategory experienced the greatest increase over the 1990s.\nIn 1991, 8.4% of the oldest age group had taken at least one\nadult education class in the previous year. By 1999, this\nnumber had increased to 19.9%. No doubt the strong econ-\nomy of the 1990s facilitated the expansion of adult educa-\ntion, but it is unlikely that there will be a future retreat for\nolder adults. Indeed, a majority of the older population's ed-\nucational activities seem to be motivated by personal devel-\nopment goals, not career goals.\nLooking down the diagonals allows us to see how educa-\ntional involvement changed within various cohorts as they\naged. In every educational category, the cohort aged 30\u00ad38\n1961) increased its level of participation in adult education\nas it aged over the 1990s. For example, the proportion of co-\nhort members taking courses offered by business or industry\nother cohort, participation rates in more formal types of ed-\nucation declined as they aged. It can be seen, however, that\ndecline (32%) occurred in the area of job-related education\nfor the cohort that moved into old age (66\u00ad74) over the de-\ncade. Each cohort more than doubled the rate at which it\nparticipated in community provided education.\nFocusing just on the older adult population (defined here\nas those aged 55\u00ad74), we observe a significant increase in\nparticipation in both formal and nonformal education pro-\ntaken a course in a school or university in the previous year\nbusiness and industry, older adults' participation rates rose\nfrom 5.7% to 9.7%. The most dramatic increase occurred\nfor participation in community-provided education, rising\nHow much of this increase can be attributed to a changing\npropensity of older people to take courses, and how much is\nTable 1. Adult Education Participation Rates\nby Age Group and Provider\nCredential program\nBusiness or industry\nCommunity organizations\nsimply a consequence of changing characteristics of the\nolder population? Compared with older adults in 1991, for\nexample, older respondents in 1999, on average, were more\neducated, had higher incomes, and were more likely to be\nemployed. Based on these demographics, we might expect a\nhigher proportion to pursue adult education courses in 1999.\nWe can provide a fairly direct answer to that question by\ncalculating the expected change that would occur simply be-\ncause of changing population characteristics. We calculate a\nlogistic regression analysis using the 1991 data to predict\nthe likelihood that a respondent had taken any course pro-\nvided by schools, businesses, or community organizations\nin the previous year (student  1, nonstudent  0). The in-\ndependent variables in this equation were age, sex, educa-\ntion, income, race, employment, and marital statuses. The\npredicted probability of being a student for the average\nolder person in 1991, that is a person with weighted mean\ncharacteristics of the 1991 sample, was .08. Substituting the\nweighted mean characteristics for respondents in 1999 into\nthe 1991 logistic regression, we find the probability of being\na student increased by only 0.02. We conclude that changes\nin population characteristics over this time period had little\nto do with the increasing involvement of older people in edu-\ncational programs. Only about one sixth of the increase can\nbe attributed to changes in the characteristics of the cohort oc-\ncupying the 65\u00ad74 age category. Although only a minority\nparticipates in any organized learning activity, there is a\ngrowing propensity for older people to be active learners.\nMultivariate Analyses\nHow much of the difference across age categories in adult\neducation participation rates is a result of differences in\ncharacteristics of older versus younger people? For exam-\nple, compared with younger adults, those over age 65 tend\nto have less education and lower rates of labor force partici-\npation. Previous studies report a positive relationship be-\ntween years of education and participation in adult educa-\ntion, and one obviously expects that employed people would\nbe more likely than nonemployed to take courses provided by\nbusinesses. Thus, one might expect that controlling for educa-\ntion and employment status would reduce differences in adult\neducation across age categories. Other potentially important\ndeterminants of engaging in adult education include race,\ngender, income and marital status, and age categories vary in\ncomposition related to each of these variables. Using a multi-\nvariate model, we can examine whether the relationship be-\ntween age and adult education is, at least to some extent, a\nconsequence of age-related differences in these various\ncharacteristics. Based on the results of the multivariate anal-\nysis shown in Table 2, we make three observations.\nFirst, many of the independent variables had a significant\neffect on the likelihood of engaging in adult education. As\nexpected, education and employment status were significant\ndeterminants of participation in adult education. In both\nnificantly more likely to participate in each type of adult ed-\nucation than those with a high school degree, whereas those\nwith less than a high school education were not even half as\nlikely to participate as those who graduated from high school.\nControlling for other factors, those who were employed were\nmore than four times as likely to have participated in an edu-\ncational program provided by business or industry as those\nwho were not employed. Employed persons also had greater\nodds of taking courses offered by schools in 1999, but em-\nployment status was not a significant predictor of participat-\ning in programs provided by community organizations.\nIn addition to employment and education, gender and\nincome tended to be significant predictors of engagement\nin adult education. Females had greater odds than males of\nparticipating in educational programs provided by schools\nand community organizations, and persons with higher\nincomes were more likely to engage in all types of adult edu-\ncation. On the other hand, controlling for other factors, partic-\nipation rates did not vary much by marital status and race.\nTable 2. Odds Ratios From Logistic Regressions Predicting Participation in Adult Education by Provider\nCredential Program Business or Industry Community Organizations\nThere was, however, one interesting exception. In 1991, non-\nHispanic Whites were more likely than others to participate\nin adult education provided by business or industry, but in\n1999 this distinction no longer existed. This finding sug-\ngests that employers' racial discrimination in the provision\nof training programs may have been declining over this time\nperiod. Other possible explanations include increasing edu-\ncational and occupational status among people of color and\nchanges in labor force composition because of immigration.\nSecond, the age discrepancy in taking courses offered by\nschools or businesses was reduced when other variables\nwere included in the model. The odds ratios for younger ver-\nsus older persons taking courses offered by schools are sub-\nstantially lower in the multivariate analysis than in the bivari-\nate analysis. For example, simple cross-tabulations indicate\ncourse offered by schools was 6.2 times that of those aged\n66\u00ad74. But, as shown in Table 2, this odds ratio is reduced to\n3.5 when other factors are included in the model. Controlling\nfor other variables consistently had a larger effect in 1999\nthan in 1991, although the odds ratios were lower in the\nmultivariate model than in the bivariate model for each\nyounger age category relative to the oldest one in both years.\nControlling for other factors has an even greater effect on\nthe differences across age categories in taking courses pro-\nvided by business. The odds ratio of someone aged 39\u00ad47\nversus someone aged 66\u00ad74 engaging in this type of adult\na bivariate to a multivariate analysis. The same comparison\nof course, primarily because of the tendency for business or\nindustry provided courses to be job related, so that retired\npersons are unlikely to participate. In contrast to other types\nof education, the relationship between age and taking courses\noffered by community organizations is hardly changed when\nother variables are taken into account.\nThird, controlling for other variables does not eliminate\nthe significant effect of age on participating in adult educa-\ntion provided by schools or businesses. The odds ratios\nshown in Table 2 indicate that, in 1999, net of other factors\nin the model, people aged 30\u00ad47 are about twice as likely as\npeople aged 66\u00ad74 to take courses offered by businesses,\nand about three times as likely to take classes offered by\nschools. It is only in programs run by churches, libraries,\nand other community organizations that age is not a signifi-\ncant predictor of participation. The results of this analysis\nalso suggest that the time in the life course when age begins\nto be a barrier to participating in adult education occurs be-\nfore old age. Indeed, the likelihood of participating in adult\neducation is not significantly different for those aged 57\u00ad65\nWe have seen that older adults have lower odds than\nyounger adults of participating in education programs pro-\nvided by schools and businesses. Such age differences do\nnot exist, however, in the likelihood of taking courses pro-\nvided by community organizations. Why? Do older adults in\ngeneral face more barriers to their participation in adult edu-\ncation than younger adults? One might speculate that older\nadults are more likely to have health problems that prevent\nthem from attending, or might find it more difficult to\narrange transportation to classes. These hypotheses can be\nexamined using data from the 1991 NHES, which asked re-\nspondents to identify personal reasons for not participating\nin adult education. Table 3 presents the odds ratios of\nyounger age groups perceiving specific barriers to their par-\nticipation, compared with those aged 66 to 74. These logis-\ntic regression models include controls for sex, education, in-\ncome, race, employment, and marital status, but here we\nfocus only on age differences.\nCuriously, although older adults are less likely to be stu-\ndents, they are also less likely to cite various obstacles to\ntheir participation. Respondents aged 30\u00ad38, for example,\nare almost 6 times as likely as those aged 66\u00ad74 to state that\nprogram costs prevent them from taking classes, even when\ncontrolling for household income. Younger age groups are\nalso more likely to cite family responsibilities, busy sched-\nules, and lack of information about classes. Interestingly,\nthose aged 57\u00ad65 are not significantly different from those\naged 66\u00ad74 in their odds of perceiving obstacles to adult ed-\nucation. Older adults are no more likely than younger adults\nto cite lack of interest, transportation, or good health as bar-\nriers to their participation in education programs.\nTable 3 reports individual perceptions of barriers or stated\nexplanations for not participating in adult education. But\nthere may be factors beyond individual impediments and\nmotivations that limit older people's involvement in educa-\ntional programs. Are there institutional forces that give\nyounger adults an advantage over older ones for engaging in\neducation programs? We investigate this through a series of\nlogistic regressions where the dependent variable is whether\nor not students received financial support for participating in\neducational programs. As shown in Table 4, several of the\ncontrol variables affect sources of support. Female students\nare more likely than male students to use their own funds to\npay for their education. Business and industry is more likely\nto provide financial support to non-Hispanic Whites, those\nwith a high school degree, and those with higher household\nincomes. Receipt of financial support from the government\nTable 3.

We conclude by highlighting four\nof these and discussing their implications. First, over the\n1990s, an increasing proportion of older people participated\nin educational activities. The rise in adult education affected\nall ages, but gains were proportionately largest among people\nin later phases of the life course. Almost certainly, the pro-\nportion of older people participating in adult education\nclasses in 1999 was unprecedented. This outcome might\nhave been expected simply because the general educational\nlevel of older people was increasing, and educational attain-\nment is positively associated with engagement in lifelong\nlearning. However, most of the gains in later life education\nin the 1990s cannot be explained by changes in cohort char-\nacteristics. Formal and nonformal educational programs ap-\npear to have succeeded in reaching adults who previously\nwould not have been involved.\nSecond, older adults continue to be less likely than younger\nones to participate in education and training provided by\nbusinesses and schools. In fact, about 90% of the young-old\npopulation was not involved. Some of this age discrepancy\noccurs because employers are more likely to provide finan-\ncial support for training to younger employees. But, there is\nevidence that much of the reason is associated with role ex-\npectations. Older adults' failure to cite barriers to participat-\ning in educational activities may reflect internalized age ex-\ndid not engage in structured learning. Of those respondents,\nonly one third provided a reason for their lack of engagement\nin educational activities when prompted. Older adults appear\nto accept the notion that engaging in formal education is a re-\nsponsibility and a right for the young. In contrast, younger\nadults are not only more involved than older ones in adult ed-\nucation, but also they are more likely to perceive family re-\nsponsibilities and work schedules as obstacles to participat-\ning in educational activities. Thus, Americans' pursuit of\neducation at the end of the twentieth century is still guided\nby age-related role expectations.\nThird, in contrast to their younger counterparts, older\npeople are more likely to engage in educational activities\nprovided by community organizations than in credential\nprograms or job related training. The priority of nonformal\nover formal education in later life is in keeping with the cul-\ntural expectation that older adults pursue leisure activities. But,\nthe importance of Bible studies, book discussion groups,\nand self-help classes as educational activities should not be\ndiscounted. It seems likely that the most promising way to\nextend the outreach of education in later life is to offer pro-\ngrams that older people identify as personally rewarding.\nIndeed, educators should be encouraged to find students\nwho are motivated by other than vocational concerns. If goals\nof lifelong learning are intellectual growth and engagement\nwith the world, there is no reason to assume that nonformal\neducation is inferior to formal education.\nFourth, age was a weaker predictor of participation in\nadult education at the end of the 1990s than it was at the be-\nginning of the decade. The multivariate analysis shows that\nthe odd ratios associated with age declined between 1991\nand 1999 for each type of adult education. These findings\nsupport the argument that age-graded roles of student,\nworker, and retiree are becoming increasingly blurred. If, as\nsome argue, the life course is becoming less rigidly struc-\ntured and experienced, we may be moving toward an age-\nintegrated society in which opportunities for education are\nopen to people of all ages and in which people of diverse\nages learn together. Before concluding that educational pro-\ngrams are breaking down age segregation, however, we will\nneed more information about the context in which education\nTable 4.

Elderhostel, discussion groups at senior centers, and\ngolden-age classes in churches may serve important educa-\ntional purposes, but they do not promote age integration.\nAge homogeneous groupings limit opportunities for learn-\ning to be enriched by interaction between people with di-\nverse life experiences, and they do not facilitate strengthen-\ning intergenerational relationships.\nLater life education has an important role to play both in\npromoting increasing age integration and in enlarging the\nproductive contribution of older people to society. Trends of\nincreased longevity, earlier retirement, and improved health\nwill provide increased opportunities for integrating educa-\ntion throughout adulthood. Expanding education across the\nlife course, however, is not simply a matter of removing eas-\nily identified barriers, such as lack of transportation or ex-\npensive tuition. Many older adults underestimate their own\ncapacity to learn and accept the notion that they should\nleave formal education programs at prescribed ages. To\ntruly become a \"lifelong learning society,\" cultural values\nmust be adjusted and educational institutions must be reor-\nganized to meet older adults' needs and interests. Further\ndevelopment of public policy and increased state and fed-\neral support for lifelong learning opportunities are needed.\n"
