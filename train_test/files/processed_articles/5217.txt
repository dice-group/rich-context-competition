To date, insufficient literature has\nbeen produced addressing the study of this issue in children\nwith borderline intellectual functioning (BIF) and gifted\nintellectual functioning (GIF). Nevertheless, in spite of their\nhigh occurrence, these two intellectual conditions are under-\ntreated and often misinterpreted. They hold heterogeneous\ngroups of children showing some similarities, despite their\napparent contrasting nature given by slowness in BIF and\nprecocity in GIF.\nFirst, an ample variety of names is used to label participants\nfalling into these two groups. More clearly, children with BIF\nare often labeled slow learners or backward learners (Vianello,\n2008). Similarly, gifted intellectual children are called chil-\ndren with high intellectual functioning or intellectual \"precoc-\nity,\" high-level potentialities, or talented children.\nThis overlapping of linguistic labels underlies complex\ntheoretical and methodological issues. We argue that these\nterms cannot be assumed as synonymous, because they differ\nin meaningful ways. For example, the expression BIF refers\nto a condition of boundary between typical and atypical\nintellectual level, while the expression slow learners taps the\nlong time spent in acquiring school skills or to complete\nachievement tasks. Similarly, gifted and talented children are\nnot terms to be used interchangeably; giftedness indicates an\naptitude in a specific domain (e.g., music, art, athletics, writ-\ning . . . ), while talent denotes the result of the giftedness\nSecond, other similarities between the two intellectual\nconditions can be found in their underestimated occurrence,\n1University of Palermo, Italy\nCorresponding Author:\nGaetano Rappo, Department of Psychology, University of Palermo, V.le\nEmail: gaetano.rappo@unipa.it\nEmotional Profile and Intellectual\nFunctioning: A Comparison Among\nChildren With Borderline Intellectual\nFunctioning, Average Intellectual\nFunctioning, and Gifted Intellectual\nFunctioning\nMarianna Alesi1, Gaetano Rappo1, and Annamaria Pepi1\n Keywords\nborderline intellectual functioning, gifted intellectual functioning, self-esteem, anxiety, depression\n2 SAGE Open\nwhich is largely based prevalently on their IQ values. BIF\ncan be commonly identified as scoring between one and two\nstandard deviations below the IQ mean (range = 70-85) and\nhas a prevalence of 13.6% in the general population.\nHowever, this rate decreases to 7% assuming the adaptive\nfunctioning as required by the Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; American\nPsychiatric Association [APA], 2013). \" . . . differentiating\nborderline intellectual functioning and mild intellectual dis-\nability (intellectual developmental disorder) requires careful\nassessment of intellectual and adaptive functions and their\ndiscrepancies, particularly in the presence of co-occurring\nmental disorders that may affect patient compliance with\nstandardized testing procedures.\"\nMoreover, the main features appear to be the delay and\nthe slowness in the acquisition of motor and cognitive com-\npetences. Specifically, children with BIF show late informa-\ntion processing abilities, narrow working memory capacity,\nlimited executive functioning, and selective-attention prob-\nlems (Ninivaggi, 2001; Schuchardt, Gebhardt, & Maehler,\n2010). Social abilities such as perspective taking and the\ninterpretation of social situations are particularly impaired.\nThe cause of this impairment would seem to be an inade-\nquate system of Social Information Processing (SIP) closely\nlinked to the slowness in selective attention, decreased work-\ning memory capacity, and increased inhibition processes\n(Van Nieuwenhuijzen, Vriens, Scheepmakerc, Smitc, &\nHowever, Gifted Intellectual Children commonly score\ntwo standard deviations over the IQ mean (more than 130)\nand have a prevalence of 2.3% in the general population.\nRevol and Bl\u00e9andonu (2012) outlined the profile of these\nchildren and have identified nine behavioral characteristics:\nvariety of interests, extraordinary curiosity, persistence in\nfront of difficulties, creativity or divergent thinking, leader-\nship, overdeveloped language abilities, high emotional com-\npetences, sensitivity, and sense of justice. On the whole,\nthese children show quicker development in one or more\nareas: physical, cognitive, linguistic, and social (Gur, 2011).\nGifted children are often described as intrusive and full of\nenergy; from early childhood, they are very curious, inquisi-\ntive, and keen to discuss concepts of their interest and create\nextensive descriptions. Moreover, they produce their first\nwords and sentences very early on, subsequently mastering a\nbroad vocabulary; they use their language in a creative way,\nand they produce complex sentences, making up stories, and\nare able to understand symbolic or abstract meanings. Often,\nthese children dislike cooperating with their chronological-\nage peers because they do not share similar interests.\nConsequently, they prefer working alone or with older chil-\nThird, the elevated co-occurrence between the above-\ndescribed intellectual conditions and school complaints such\nas learning disabilities (LD) and attention deficit hyperactiv-\nity disorders (ADHD; Vianello, 2008) is worth noting.\nAmple evidence has been found associating BIF and LDs,\nespecially dyslexia. This comorbidity paradoxically seems to\ncontrast the diagnosis criterion of exclusion of impaired\nintellectual level in children with LD. However, a close asso-\nciation between the two conditions has been postulated by\nVianello (2014), who argued that the comorbidity of BIF and\nof Consensus Conference (AA.VV., 2009). Karande,\nKanchan, and Kulkarni (2008) documented the academic\nhistory of 55 children with BIF and have found high rates of\ncomorbidity with poor school performance (89.1%) and dif-\nis consistent with results of Fernell and Ek (2010) who\nfocused a great amount of academic difficulties, namely, the\nstruggle to cope with school tasks and classroom demands,\nconduct disorders, and externalizing symptoms associated\nwith lower levels of inhibition. Through analyzing this issue\nin depth, several possible explanations for the comorbidity of\nBIF and LD can be hypothesized. First, an impaired process-\ning speed can be identified as a main factor that limits \"the\namount of information that can be processed in a given time\ninterval\" with longer reaction times (RTs) in cognitive tasks\nand slower performance in intellectual tasks (Bonifacci &\nSnowling, 2007). Second, the delayed cognitive develop-\nment and information processing characterizing the BIF cre-\nates memory or selective-attention problems, which in turn\ncompromise the capacity to successfully acquire school\ncapacities (Van Nieuwenhuijzen et al., 2011).\nMoreover, epidemiological studies have revealed in chil-\ndren and adolescents with BIF high rates of ADHD ranging\nbetween 20% and 30% as well as behavioral problems about\nHowever, the association between giftedness and LDs has\nbeen controversial (Kirmani, Al-Kadi, Iftikhar, & Mayat,\nDouret (2011) analyzed factors involved in the neuropsycho-\nlogical and psychopathological etiology of LDs in high-level\npotentialities children. The first factors included written lan-\nguage disorders such as dyslexia, spelling difficulties,\ndyscalculia, and dysgraphia. The second factors embraced\nunderperforming, psycho-affective immaturity, anxiety, and\nbehavioral fluctuations. The author therefore argued how the\ntypical precocity of this population could make these chil-\ndren more vulnerable in developing LDs because it consents\nto use compensation strategies, which, in turn, mask eventual\nlearning difficulties and make difficult the diagnosis in\nhighly gifted children.\nA certain number of studies reported the comorbidity\nbetween giftedness and ADHD (B\u00e9nony, Van Der Elst,\nKirmani et al., 2014). Specifically, multiple and contradic-\ntory causes have been identified in this population: (a) the\ntypical motor instability associated with hyperactivity and\nimpulsivity, (b) boredom in the classroom due to out-of-ordi-\nnary intellectual capacities determining a higher processing\nAlesi et al. 3\nspeed, (c) the quickness to complete school tasks before\nclassmates, and (d) the affective development and relational\ndifficulties with peers (Revol & Bl\u00e9andonu, 2012).\nFourth, a variety of authors documented children with\nBIF as a population at high risk of mental health disorders\n(Cooper, Smiley, Morrison, Williamson, & Allan, 2007;\ndemonstrated that a large number of children with BIF are\nmore likely to show higher rates of anxiety and depression as\nwell as developing neurotic and personality disorders as\nopposed to typically developing peers (Emerson, Einfeld, &\nAnxiety disorders are considered the most prevalent men-\ntal impairments in typical and atypical children (Kozina,\n2014). Anxiety is a discomfort reaction associated with\nunpleasant emotions and a state of distress occurring in\nresponse to situations or tasks that are perceived as threaten-\ning to self-worth (Pereira, Barros, & Mendon\u00e7a, 2012).\nMoreover, anxiety disorders are frequently in comorbidity\nwith depressive symptoms with rates ranging from 16% to\n50% increasing in chronicity and severity (Jacobson &\nNewman, 2014). A common core of high negative affects is\nthe leading cause of this comorbidity. The consequence is the\ninterference with daily functioning for a sizable population\nof children (Cooper et al., 2007; Wright, Banerjee, Hoek,\nRieffe, & Novin, 2010). However, scholars and practitioners\nagree that natural concerns clearly follow developmental\nwaves during the growth. Fears regarding separation anxiety\ndecrease during early childhood, whereas fears about school\nand school anxiety increase during later childhood (Grills-\nTaquechel, Fletcher, Vaughn, & Stuebing, 2012). So school\nanxiety is the most frequent fear occurring during school\nage. It describes a discomfort reaction associated with\nunpleasant emotions and a state of distress occurring in\nresponse to situations involving school learning tasks that\nare perceived as threatening to self-worth.\nAt this age, the close relationship between depressive\nsymptoms and anxiety is largely reinforced by lower levels\nof school self-esteem (Bernaras, Jaureguizar, Soroa, Ibabe,\nself-esteem by claiming the significant emotional distress\nlinked to difficulties in school, social, or vocational compe-\ntences. Often, lower levels of school self-esteem are associ-\nated to poor achievement at school. Specifically, higher\nachievers are more likely to develop positive school emo-\ntions and affects, which, in turn, reinforce their engagement\nand motivation in school activities, while students with\nschool underachievement are more likely to show lower\nglobal self-esteem and to report increasing anxious and\ndepressive symptomatology.\nSimilarly, gifted children were reported to be highly vul-\nnerable in developing mental health disorders. From a devel-\nopmental perspective, this risk already manifested during\nchildhood may grow and become significant in\nadolescence; gifted adolescents often show anxiety and\ndepressive symptoms associated with inhibition and academic\ndisinvestment as well as immature affective development and\nrelational difficulties with their peers. In turn, distress and\nanxiety reinforce a loss of interest in learning by creating intel-\nlectual inhibition and refuse to cope with challenging tasks\n(Vaivre-Douret, 2011). Mood and conduct disorders are the\ndirect consequence of this situation (B\u00e9nony et al., 2007;\ncally, the gift does not only bring joy and happiness, but it also\nbrings with it danger, anxiety and disappointment\" (p. 63).\nMoreover, giftedness can become a limit if the gap between\ncognitive and emotional development is too wide. This may\nlead to the phenomenon \"Shattered Idealism,\" which is char-\nacterized by a negative self-awareness and maladaptive moti-\nvational profile, which has an effect on disruptive behaviors\nGiven the literature findings and speculative interpreta-\ntions, comparisons of ratings of depression, school anxiety,\ninsecurity, and self-esteem at school endorsed by pupils with\ndifferent levels of intellectual functioning (BIF, AIF, GIF\ngroups) were assessed. In particular, the following hypothe-\nses will be tested in this research:\nHypothesis 1: The intellectual functioning, in our sam-\nple, would follow a normal distribution with the majority\nof children showing an average level of intellectual\nfunctioning.\nHypothesis 2: Pupils with AIF would have higher scores\non self-esteem at school and lower levels of school anxi-\nety, depressed mood, and insecurity than pupils with BIF\nand GIF.\nHypothesis 3: The correlations of rated school self-\nesteem, anxiety, depressed mood, and insecurity would be\nstatistically significant and would be shown by all the\nthree groups.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants were 104 non-clinical children whose mean age\nthere were 35 female and 69 male participants. They were\nselected from a sample of 265 pupils on the basis of their\nlevel of intelligence. All children were attending fourth\ngrade of the primary school and fell into three groups on the\nbasis of level of intelligence: (a) BIF, (b) AIF, and (c) GIF.\nThe BIF group was composed of 25 children, aged 9.6\npercentile and mental age greater than 8 years. The AIF\nFinally, the GIF group was composed of 17 children aged\n4 SAGE Open\nPrior to the start of the study, written informed consent\nwas provided by each participant's parents.

The Raven's (2008) Progressive\nMatrices were administered to measure general intelligence.\nThis test evaluates the development of logical thinking.\nGiven a matrix of geometric shapes, children were required\nto select the correct missing shape among a set of items. For\neach item, evaluation was binary, with a score of 1 being\nattributed to each correct item, and 0 to incorrect items.\nOL test. The Organizzazioni Logiche (OL; Vianello & Marin,\n1997) test was administered to determine mental age of the\nparticipants. The OL test consists of 18 items subdivided into\nthree areas of logical operation (ordering, numbering, and\nclassification). Evaluation was binary for each item, with a\nmark of 1 being attributed to each correct item and 0 to each\nincorrect item. The raw data thus obtained were then trans-\nformed into a measure of mental age (range = 4-8 years)\nusing appropriate conversion tables. The OL test shows good\nvalidity, with a .68 correlation with Wechsler Intelligence\nScale and a.78 correlation with the Columbia Mental Matu-\nrity Scale. The reliability of the OL test is .87.\nSchool self-esteem.The Test Multidimensionale Autostima\n(TMA)\u00adMultidimensional Test of Self-Esteem, realized by\nBracken (1992), was used to measure self-esteem at school.\nThis test assesses the global self-worth by means of six dif-\nferent scales of self-esteem (Social, Competence, Affect,\nSchool, Family, and Physical).\nThe administration was individual. In particular, for our\nresearch, we used the scale to evaluate the school self-\nesteem. This scale consisted of 25 items, positive and nega-\ntive, related to the way pupils feel about themselves in the\nschool domain. Participants were asked to express their level\nof agreement with statements such as I am proud of my\nschoolwork or I do not understand much what I read. Each\nitem was presented on a 4-point Likert-type scale from abso-\nlutely true to absolutely false.

The scales were Anxiety (SAFA A), Depression\n(SAFA D), Obsessive\u00adCompulsive Symptoms (SAFA O),\nSomatic Symptoms and Hypochondria (SAFA S), Phobias\n(SAFA F), and Psychogenic Eating Disorders (SAFA P).\nMoreover, each scale consisted of two versions suitable\nEach item was scored from 0 to 2.\nIn our study, SAFA A and SAFA D were administered.\nThe first measured the school anxiety, with 12 items, such as\nWhen I go to school I often feel very nervous. The second\nmeasured the depressed mood, with six items, such as I often\nfeel sad without any reason, and the insecurity, with six\nitems, such as I am sure of myself.\nEach item was presented on a 3-point scale from true to false.\nThe test\u00adretest reliability of the battery was r = .90.\nProcedure\nAt the beginning of the research, a screening was done on all\nfourth graders from two public schools located in quarters of\nmedium socioeconomic level. The screening was carried out\nin 3 months. All children were assessed with the Raven's\nProgressive Matrices to evaluate their level of intellectual\nfunctioning. To evaluate mental age in BIF group, children\nwere assessed with the OL test.\nAll children with Raven's scores lower than 15 percentile\nwere administered with the OL test to identify their mental\nage. Only the children who had a mental age greater than 8\nwere grouped with BIF.\nAll children with Raven's scores from 35 to 75 percentile\nwere grouped with AIF.\nAll children with Raven's scores higher than 88 were\ngrouped with GIF.\nAfter the screening, 104 children were selected and subdi-\nvided into 3 groups: group BIF (n = 25 pupils) characterized\nby low level of intellectual functioning, group AIF (n = 62\npupils) characterized by average level of intellectual func-\ntioning, group GIF (n = 17 pupils) characterized by high\nlevel of intellectual functioning.\nAll children were administered School Self-Esteem,\nSchool Anxiety, Depressed Mood, and Insecurity tests. The\norder of presentation of the four tests was balanced.\nThe administration modality was individual, and it did not\nlast more than 25 min.\nResults\nThe first goal of this study was to verify whether intellectual\nfunctioning, in our sample, would follow a normal distribution.\nThe Levene's test revealed that the distribution of intel-\nlectual functioning in our sample of 265 children with mean\nWe found a nearly normative distribution in which most\npupils (66.03%) showed average levels of intellectual func-\ntioning. Pupils with BIF were 15.47%, and pupils with high\nintellectual functioning were 6.42%.\nThe second goal of this study aimed to investigate the\nlevel of school self-esteem, school anxiety, depressed mood,\nand insecurity in the three groups of children with different\nlevels of intellectual functioning (BIF, AIF, GIF groups).\nAlesi et al. 5\nTo investigate this issue, a one-way ANOVA was per-\nformed using the level of intellectual functioning as an inde-\npendent variable, while the dependent ones were school\nself-esteem, school anxiety, depressed mood, and insecurity.\nThe one-way ANOVA was calculated.

Specifically, children with BIF were 15.47%, and chil-\ndren with GIF were 6.42%. These rates are consistent with\nother research, which found an occurrence for individuals\nwith BIF of about 12% to 13% in the general population if\nwe consider only the scores on the intelligence scales with-\nout measures of adaptive functioning (Ninivaggi, 2001;\nVianello, 2008). Other studies report the prevalence of 2.3%\nfor intellectual gifted children in the general population\nSecond, we found significant differences between our\nthree groups in the emotional profile. Children with BIF\nshowed the lowest level of self-esteem and, conversely, the\nhighest levels of school anxiety and depressed mood.\nThere are similarities between this emotional profile and\nthat described by previous work in this field highlighting how\nlow levels of school self-esteem and self-concept are com-\nmonly associated with intellectual functioning below the\nIndividuals who experienced repeated failure, such as those\nwith BIF, are more likely to show higher rates of anxiety and\ndepression as well as to develop neurotic and personality dis-\norders as opposed to their typically developing peers\nsome perceived or real threats, novel or ambiguous events,\nchildren with BIF are more likely to make cognitive errors or\ndistortions characterized by a negative bias in the interpreta-\ntion of facts (Pereira et al., 2012). Moreover, anxiety disor-\nders are frequently associated with depressive symptoms with\nrates ranging from 16% to 50% increasing in chronicity and\nseverity (Jacobson & Newman, 2014). The consequence is\nthe interference with daily functioning (Wright et al., 2010).\nNevertheless, gifted children show an emotional profile\ncharacterized by significant higher self-esteem and lower\ndepression levels than children with BIF. This is in contrast\nwith previous studies, which underlie the close association\nbetween the lack of school self-esteem and depressive disor-\nders in gifted children as the result of the asynchrony among\ntheir cognitive and emotional abilities (Karande et al., 2008).\nIn the attempt to explain our result, we raise a developmental\nissue. More precisely, this emotional profile in our group of\nchildren with giftedness may be explained by the young age\nof our participants. First, we hypothesize that deficits may\nbecome increasingly evident over the time when the gap\nbetween cognitive and emotional abilities increases and\nenvironmental demands enhance. Second, if we consider the\nchanges in self-worth across the life span and the age trajec-\ntory, self-esteem is generally quite elevated and not stable\nduring childhood (Pepi, Faria, & Alesi, 2006; Trzesniewski,\nOther findings to emerge from this research were the cor-\nrelations between the emotional variables. Consistent with\nour third hypothesis, in the groups of pupils with BIF and\nAIF, significant positive correlations between school anxi-\nety, depressed mood, and insecurity were observed. A possi-\nble explanation for this might be that anxiety and depression\nregularly co-occur with rates ranging from 0.40 to 0.70 both\nin clinical and non-clinical samples (Wright et al., 2010).\nThis comorbidity bases on common high negative feelings.A\nlower intellectual functioning enhances the perception of\nnegative self-competence and increases negative affects such\nas depressed mood, reduced pleasure and interest, irritability,\nfatigue, and weakened concentration.\nConversely, school anxiety and school self-esteem were\nnegatively correlated. As mentioned by Bernaras et al.\n(2011), lower levels of self-esteem reinforce the anxiety. In\nother words, negative self-perception and self-worth increase\nthe discomfort reaction occurring in response to threatening\nevents. Taken together, these results indirectly suggest the\nkey role of environmental factors such as family and school\nas sources of anxiety. Consistently, wide research shows that\nnegative parents'and teachers'behaviors or information pro-\nvided to children are associated with increased fear and anxi-\nety. Specifically, the following factors have been found to\npredict anxiety disorders in children: parents' or teachers'\nanxiety, parents' or teachers' criticism and rejection, adults'\novercontrol and overprotection, insecure parent\u00adchild attach-\nment, and maladaptive parenting behaviors, parental warmth,\nand family cohesion (Drake & Ginsburg, 2012).\nNo differences were found between children with BIF and\nGIF. The reason for this might be related to the fact that the\ndevelopment of negative thoughts and worries depends on\nlogical reasoning and elaborate decisional processes.\nTherefore, we have to acknowledge that children with BIF\nhave an IQ level not significantly below the median IQ. It is\npossible that, at this age, their intellectual level preserve their\nperception and awareness of their own abilities. Moreover,\nour results may be attributed to the age of participants and\nneed to be interpreted as evidence in favor of a linear increase\nof risk to develop anxiety and depression symptoms by age.\nIn other words, the development of negative thoughts and\nworries is not stable but increases over time and is largely\ninfluenced by failure experiences that accumulate with\nFinally, in the GIF group, we found a significant negative\ncorrelation between self-esteem and emotional insecurity as\nwell as a significant positive correlation between depressed\nmood and insecurity. These findings were unexpected and\nsuggest the key role of family to influence the emotional pro-\nfile of these children. According to the Emotional Security\nTheory (Cummings & Davies, 1996), children's emotional\ninsecurity is strongly influenced by environmental factors\nsuch as family sense of protection and safety. Therefore, the\ninsecurity is more likely negatively associated with self-\nesteem because it demonstrates the failure of the above-men-\ntioned process aimed at maintaining the sense of safety and\nsecurity. This failure results in emotional dis-regulation\nexperiences and a negative worth of self. In turn, emotional\ninsecurity is designated as an explanatory mechanism for\ninternalizing and externalizing problems (Cummings,\nCheung, & Davies, 2013; Cummings, George, McCoy, &\nDavies, 2010). It seems possible that the insecurity is related\nAlesi et al. 7\nto low self-esteem only in the GIF group given the typical\nsensitivity and psycho-affective immaturity of these chil-\ndren, which make them particularly sensitive to environmen-\ntal claims.\nHowever, it is interesting to note in all three groups of this\nstudy the positive correlation between insecurity and\ndepressed mood. A possible explanation lies in the nature of\nthese emotional conditions sharing a common basis of nega-\ntive feelings, which enables children at high risk of mental\ndisorders.\nTo sum up, it is crucial to acknowledge that future research\nis needed to build on the shortcoming of this study. The most\nimportant limitation lies in the fact that we did the assess-\nment of intellectual functioning only on the basis of the IQ.\nA further study to assess both IQ and adaptive behaviors is\ntherefore recommended. Moreover, in future investigations,\nit might be possible to investigate learning profiles of chil-\ndren with low, average, and high intellectual functioning.\nAnother source of weakness in this study is the participants'\nage ranging from 8.7 to 9.9 years. This range is small and not\nnecessarily representative of the population of Italian school-\nchildren, a factor that may limit the generalizability of the\nresults. Additional research should extend the sample to\nolder students to assess our hypothesis that the gap between\nintellectual and emotional functioning increases with age.\nNevertheless, challenges and future directions should\nincorporate research that addresses issues concerning envi-\nronmental factors and also examine mechanisms mediating\nfamily/school sources and children's temperamental vulner-\nability to develop maladaptive emotional profiles.\nDespite this, our work provides support for the need of a\nmultifaceted approach of study considering simultaneously\nintellectual and emotional functioning. To our knowledge,\nthe literature is lacking on the relationship between intellec-\ntual levels, anxiety, and depression in school-age children.\nThis is an intriguing one, which could be usefully explored in\nfurther research.\nImplications\nThe evidence from this study suggests the importance of the\nprevention programs aimed at identifying at an early age\nhigh-risk cases showing increased levels of depression and\nanxiety in children with lower or higher levels of intellectual\nfunctioning. These programs would result in positive signifi-\ncant effects to limit or reduce anxious or depressive behav-\niors and to prevent mental health problems or personality\ndysfunctions in adulthood (Allison, Nativio, Mitchell, Ren,\nJacobson & Newman, 2014). Generally, the intervention pro-\ngrams aim to train coping and problem-solving strategies to\nface controllable and uncontrollable problems and reduce the\nrisk of high anxiety by favoring the self-regulation and the\nmanagement of stressful school situations. Indeed, school is\nthe ideal context to provide preventive interventions to a\nlarge number of children before a disorder occurs in full\nscale. One of the most valued preventive programs is the\nFRIENDS for Life program. It is a short cognitive-behav-\nioral intervention, delivered by classroom teachers, and\naimed to reduce both anxiety and depressive symptoms\nIt is of worth to note another intervention program com-\nbining educational and clinical approaches. This is the cogni-\ntive-behavioral therapy (CBT)\u00adbased training. It is a program\nbased on coping and problem-solving strategies to reduce\ncognitive maladaptive strategies in schoolchildren aged 9 to\n10 years. This program is delivered in classroom by teachers\npreviously trained by school psychologists. The effective\nfindings highlight the importance to associate appropriate\neducational and clinical interventions.\nMore specifically, Shaw (2008) postulated the necessity\nto improve the education of students with BIF. The author\nplanned an educational program aimed at developing the\ninstructional practices to improve resilience skills. In turn,\nthese skills allow pupils with BIF to cope with emotional and\nbehavioral dysregulation as well as problematic social\nfunctioning.\nSecond, parental intervention programs are needed. Poor\nparenting profiles were often referred (Fenning, Baker,\nBaker, & Crnic, 2007). Specifically, mothers of children with\nBIF were found to be less positive and sensitive than mothers\nof typically developing children as well as lacking of explan-\natory models for their children's difficulties.\nHowever, the education of gifted children necessitates\nspecial programs and adapted school curricula able to ade-\nquately stimulate the cognitive abilities of these pupils. The\nPersonalized Model of Education for Gifted Children is an\nappreciated educational program, which takes into consider-\nation the psychological and behavioral characteristics of\ngifted children (Kelemen, 2010). It is a program to control\nand reduce emotional and environmental risk factors, which\nmay cause underachievement and social-emotional malad-\njustments. The goal is to develop an autonomous personality\nand improve the level of self-esteem resulting in the preven-\ntion of maladaptive self-awareness, perfectionism, and social\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAhlen, J., Breitholtz, E., Barrett, P.
