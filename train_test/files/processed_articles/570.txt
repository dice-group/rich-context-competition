In brief,\ntrained coders at each hospital review clinical records of every\nED visit to identify physician-diagnosed adverse drug events\n(ADEs) and report up to 2 medications implicated in each ADE\nand any concomitant medications listed in the medical rec-\nord. Coders also record narrative descriptions of the inci-\ndents, including physician diagnosis and clinical testing. Nar-\nrative descriptions are coded using the Medical Dictionary for\nRegulatory Activities (MedDRA), an international terminol-\nogy used to analyze ADE reports.\nFor this investigation, an ADE case was defined as an inci-\ndent ED visit made by a patient older than 17 years between\ndogrel, aspirin, or warfarin was implicated in the ED visit and\n(2) the ED visit was the result of either an unintentional over-\ndose from an antiplatelet or anticoagulant agent (as evidenced\nby hemorrhage, laboratory coagulation variable abnormality,\nor other toxic effects) or workup for hemorrhage in a patient\nreceiving an antiplatelet or anticoagulant agent (ie, an ED visit\ndue to a fall or injury while receiving an antiplatelet or anti-\ncoagulant agent). The Standardized MedDRA Query for hem-\norrhage, a grouping of relevant MedDRA terms that assists in\nretrieval of ADE terms related to a specific condition of inter-\nest, was used to identify cases involving hemorrhage. All im-\nplicated and concomitant medication fields were searched to\nidentify the presence of warfarin, clopidogrel, or aspirin. Cases\nwere excluded if the ED visit was unrelated to a patient's own\nmedication (eg, as with a patient mistakenly taking an anti-\nplatelet or anticoagulant medication prescribed to another in-\ndividual). The ED cases were categorized as being due to clo-\npidogrel plus aspirin if use of both drugs was documented and\nuse of neither an anticoagulant medication (warfarin, hepa-\nrin, or low-molecular-weight heparin) nor another antiplate-\nlet medication (dipyridamole or ticlopidine) was docu-\nmented. The ED cases were categorized as being due to warfarin\nif warfarin was implicated in the AE and use of no other anti-\ncoagulant medication (heparin or low-molecular-weight hep-\narin) or antiplatelet medication (aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyri-\ndamole, or ticlopidine) was documented.\nWe estimated the number of ambulatory care visits at which\nclopidogrel plus aspirin or warfarin therapy was prescribed or\ncontinued based on 2 national cross-sectional surveys of am-\nbulatory medical care services: the National Ambulatory Medi-\ncal Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambula-\ntory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS).22 These surveys involve\na multistage sampling design of ambulatory care visits to non\u00ad\nfederally employed office-based physicians and to EDs and out-\npatient departments of noninstitutional general and short-\nstay hospitals, exclusive of federal, military, and Veterans\nAdministration hospitals.22 For this investigation, we refer to\nall NAMCS/NHAMCS ambulatory care visits at which these\nmedications were prescribed or continued as \"outpatient pre-\n(the most recent available) to identify ambulatory care visits\nat which clopidogrel plus aspirin (with no concomitant war-\nfarin documented) or warfarin (with no concomitant clopido-\ngrel or aspirin documented) was prescribed or continued in pa-\ntients older than 17 years. Each drug was identified by searching\nthe 8 medication fields in each NAMCS/NHAMCS data set for\nthe Multum Lexicon Drug Database code for the generic in-\nEach selected NEISS-CADES, NAMCS, and NHAMCS\nrecord was accompanied by a sample weight based on inverse\nprobability of selection, adjusted for nonresponse and post-\nstratified to adjust for the number of annual hospital ED visits\n(NEISS-CADES) and adjusted for nonresponse and popula-\ntion changes incorporating weight smoothing (NAMCS/\ntient prescription visits and corresponding 95% confidence in-\ntervals (CIs) were calculated using the SURVEYMEANS pro-\ncedure in SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North\nCarolina) to account for the sample weights and complex sample\ndesigns. The resulting frequency estimates and CIs derived from\nNEISS-CADES data were divided by 3, and those derived from\nNAMCS/NHAMCS data were divided by 2, to obtain annual es-\ntimates. Estimates based on small numbers of cases (20 cases\nfor the NEISS-CADES project and 30 cases for the NAMCS/\nNHAMCS) or with a coefficient of variation greater than 30%\nwere considered statistically unstable and are noted in the tables.\nTo assess the risk of selected outcomes (ED visits for any acute\nhemorrhage; for epistaxis, skin, or other minor hemorrhages; and\nfor gastrointestinal tract hemorrhages and ED visits resulting in\nhospitalizations) associated with clopidogrel plus aspirin therapy\nrelative to the risk associated with warfarin use, we divided the\nproportion of selected ED visits (for all hemorrhage-related AEs,\nthose for acute hemorrhages, or those for gastrointestinal tract\nhemorrhages) resulting in each specific outcome for DAT by the\ncomparable proportion for warfarin. The 95% CIs for the com-\nponent proportions (risks) incorporated the inherent variability\nin the numerator and the denominator of each risk estimate by\napplying the domain estimation feature of the SURVEYMEANS\nprocedure. The 95% CIs for the risk ratios (RRs) similarly incor-\nporatedthevariabilityinthenumeratorsanddenominatorsofboth\ncomponent risk estimates.28 The risks of specific outcomes in the\n2 separate patient populations were treated as independent (and,\nthus, as having zero covariance). A sensitivity analysis indicated\nthat the conclusions based on the CIs for these RRs were in al-\nmost all instances robust against moderate to strong correlation\nbetween the 2 estimated risks.\nA similar approach was used to assess the relative risks of\nADEs per outpatient prescription visit. We first divided the es-\ntimated annual number of ED visits for ADEs (for hemorrhage-\nrelated AEs overall and for any acute hemorrhage from the\nNEISS-CADES project) by the estimated annual number of out-\npatient prescription visits at which clopidogrel plus aspirin or\nwarfarin was prescribed (from the NAMCS/NHAMCS) to ob-\ntain a risk estimate for each prescription group. These risk es-\ntimates were then used to calculate ratios of the risks associ-\nated with clopidogrel plus aspirin to the comparable risks\nassociated with warfarin. The accompanying 95% CIs for the\ncomponent risks and RRs again recognized variability in the\nnumerator and denominator of each risk estimate.28 The com-\nponent risk estimates were again assumed to be independent\nacross patient populations (and, as previously stated, this as-\nsumption was complemented by a sensitivity analysis that sug-\ngested robustness against nontrivial correlations).\nRESULTS\norrhage-related AEs by patients receiving clopidogrel plus\n\u00a92010 American Medical Association.

In absolute terms, the\nestimated number of ED visits for hemorrhage-related\ncomplications from DAT (7654 annually) was just more\nthan one-tenth that from warfarin (60 575 annually). Ac-\ncounting for prescribing frequency, this difference was\nless pronounced but remained statistically significant. We\nfound that, on average, for every 815 outpatient visits at\nwhich clopidogrel plus aspirin was prescribed, 1 patient\npresented to an ED for related bleeding or evaluation for\nbleeding; for every 274 outpatient visits at which warfa-\nrin was prescribed, 1 patient presented to an ED for re-\nlated bleeding or evaluation for bleeding. Treatment with\nwarfarin has demonstrated clear benefits in numerous set-\ntings in which DAT does not have an established role,\nand the choice to use warfarin as a comparator is not in-\ntended to imply that these safety data can dictate one\nchoice of antithrombotic strategy over the other; how-\never, these population-based data contextualizing the\nhemorrhagic risks of DAT relative to those of an agent\nsuch as warfarin help identify several important issues\nabout the scope and magnitude of hemorrhage-related\nAEs associated with clopidogrel plus aspirin use.\nFirst, we found that an estimated 60% of ED visits for\nclopidogrel plus aspirin\u00adrelated acute hemorrhages in-\nvolved epistaxis, skin, or other minor hemorrhages (eg,\nbleeding from the mouth, small cuts, bruising, pete-\nchiae, and ecchymosis). Although the immediate harm\nfrom these types of hemorrhages may not be severe, this\nfinding is concerning because these \"nuisance\" bleed-\nings have been linked to early discontinuation of clopi-\ndogrel therapy,29,30 which, in turn, has been associated\nwith in-stent thrombosis and poor clinical outcomes in\npatients who have undergone coronary stenting.31-34 Re-\ncent guidelines emphasize the need to educate patients\nregarding the potentially serious negative consequences\nof premature discontinuation of DAT after coronary stent-\ning.34 The high frequency of ED visits for these types of\nhemorrhages reinforces the need for practitioners to un-\nderstand the avoidance and management strategies for\nthese AEs and to incorporate information on minor hem-\norrhages into patient education so that patients know to\nanticipate and recognize such events, seek appropriate\ntreatment, and not discontinue therapy abruptly.34,35\nSecond, regarding the severity of AEs, life-threatening\nhemorrhages, including central nervous system and pul-\nmonary hemorrhages, seem to be less common with clo-\npidogrel plus aspirin therapy; however, a substantial pro-\nportion (almost one-third) of clopidogrel plus aspirin\u00ad\nrelated ED visits for hemorrhage-related AEs were serious\nenough to require hospitalization.

Direct\ncomparisonofthepresentfindingswiththoseofthesestud-\nies is made difficult by the heterogeneity of data sources\nand bleeding definitions used and by the patient popula-\ntions and indications for DAT under study. Likewise, few\ndata are available from clinical trials that have prospec-\ntively compared specific hemorrhagic risks of DAT with\ndomized controlled trials of secondary stroke prevention\nestimated total bleeding rates to be 10.1% with clopido-\ngrel plus aspirin therapy vs 16.8% with anticoagulation\ntherapy and annualized major bleeding rates (defined by\nthe authors as any bleeding necessitating hospital admis-\nsion) to be 1.7% with clopidogrel plus aspirin therapy vs\n2.5%withanticoagulationtherapy.Inthemostrecentclini-\ncal trials10,11 of DAT in patients with AF at high risk for\nstroke, major bleeding rates for DAT were 2.0% to 2.4%\nper year. Rates of major bleeding with DAT in these pa-\ntient populations were not statistically significantly differ-\nent than those with warfarin.10\nThis study's findings should be interpreted in the con-\ntext of the limitations of public health surveillance data.\nFirst, regarding ED visit data, information on medical his-\ntory is limited in the NEISS-CADES project, so all pa-\ntients, regardless of indication for antithrombotic therapy,\naspirin dose,53 or other known hemorrhage-related risk\nfactors, were included in this analysis. Second, because\nthese data are based on ED record review, medication his-\ntory may be incomplete; however, omission of antiplate-\nlet medication or warfarin during the workup for an ED\nvisit involving hemorrhage or evaluation for potential\nhemorrhage is likely minimal. Third, comparisons of ED\nvisits for epistaxis, skin, or other minor hemorrhages be-\ntween DAT and warfarin therapy may have been af-\nfected by the fact that patients receiving warfarin are more\nlikely to have longer durations of treatment (eg, lifelong\ntreatment in patients with AF) relative to patients re-\nceiving DAT (eg, 12-month treatment after percutane-\nous coronary intervention). For this reason, patients re-\nceiving warfarin may be more familiarized with minor\nhemorrhages and less likely to seek ED treatment for such\nhemorrhages than may patients undergoing DAT. Re-\ngardless, this does not negate the substantial contribu-\ntion of these types of hemorrhages to the overall burden\nof ED visits from DAT.\nRegarding prescription data, first, it is possible that as-\npirin use was underreported in patient medical histories\ngivenitsover-the-counterstatus;however,thisismuchless\nlikely for patients who have a clinical indication for DAT\ncompared with patients who are receiving aspirin mono-\ntherapy as primary or secondary prevention for other car-\ndiovascular indications.

Third, outpatient\nprescriptionvisitsareacrudemeasureofexposureforcom-\nparing warfarin use (likely associated with frequent fol-\nlow-up outpatient visits) with clopidogrel plus aspirin use\n(likely associated with fewer follow-up outpatient visits).\nHowever, reporting the number of AEs relative to the num-\nber of ambulatory care visits at which DAT or warfarin was\nprescribed or continued provides good context forthe risks\nthat DAT imparts with every patient encounter.\nThe beneficial role of DAT is well established in pa-\ntients with acute coronary syndromes and may poten-\ntially expand to a subset of patients with AF. Ultimately,\nfor each patient, the hemorrhagic risk associated with DAT\nwill be determined by his or her specific demographic\nand clinical risk factors, underlying diagnosis, treat-\nment setting, and quality of clinical care. Broadly, how-\never, these nationally representative findings on AEs in-\ndicate that the hemorrhagic risk of clopidogrel plus aspirin\ntherapy is substantial and suggest a need to approach that\nrisk with vigilance. The high frequency of minor hem-\norrhages with clopidogrel plus aspirin suggests that ef-\nforts targeted at educating patients to anticipate and rec-\nognize such events so as to optimize patient adherence\nto therapy will be important.\nCorrespondence: Nadine Shehab, PharmD, MPH, Divi-\nsion of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Centers for Dis-\nease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Rd NE, Mail\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design: She-\nhab and Budnitz.
