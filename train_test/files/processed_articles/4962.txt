Although the original\narticle itself had a difficult time coming to publication (see\nWest & Zimmerman, 2009, for more details), most sociolo-\ngists now expect graduate students (and likely undergradu-\nates, too) to be familiar with the concept and/or to have read\nthe original 1987 article. The symposium in Gender &\nSociety on the 20th anniversary of the article's publication\n(Gender & Society, Vol. 23(1)) asked whether \"doing gen-\nder\" was part of the sociological canon, a call to research, or\nsomething else. Indeed, the authors in the symposium docu-\nment the myriad of ways in which the concept of \"doing\ngender\" has informed research projects and theoretical\nexplications of social behavior.\nIn this article, I revisit the concept of \"doing gender\" as\nWest and Zimmerman (2009) implore in their response to the\nGender & Society symposium. I ask whether \"doing gender\"\nsociological theory. Building on Chafetz's (2004a) critique\nof much of feminist theory, I query whether the framework\nas directly articulated by the authors is meant to be a descrip-\ntion of social life (a social theory) or a testable and poten-\ntially falsifiable explanation of the empirical world (a\nsociological theory). I then show how the critiques that West\nand Zimmerman (2009) bring to bear on much of the research\nthat uses \"doing gender\" are due to researchers' use of the\nconcept as a social, rather than sociological, theory. This\nmisuse has yielded scores of publications providing valuable\nthick description on social life without direct tests of the\nmechanisms by which \"doing gender\" is purported to explain\nthe reproduction of gender inequality. I conclude by making\nthe case for the role of \"doing gender\" in, rather than as,\nsociological theory.\nDefining Sociological Theory\nI have been heavily influenced by Janet Chafetz's (2004a)\narticle (a symposium presentation subsequently published as\nan article alongside the symposium discussants' critiques),\nwhere she critically assesses the state of feminist theory in\nsocial science and in sociology as a discipline. Chafetz\n(2004a) argues that the goal of social science\nis to develop explanations (theories)--that is, attempts to answer\nquestions of why and how--of empirically documentable\nphenomena concerning human behavior and the structures and\nprocesses they create in the present and have created in other\nThere are, she argues, two key components to the discipline\nof sociology: (a) an emphasis on using systematic approaches\n1George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nShannon N.

Even Weber\n(1922) famously argued for sociology's usefulness as a sci-\nence and in society. Much in the discipline's history has been\nwritten about the extent to which sociology is a science, but\nmuch of that discourse has been derived from a \"positivist\"\nversion of science. That is, the truth, reality, can be discovered\nthrough objectivity, meaning removing the researcher's sub-\njective bias. Feminists have critiqued this approach to doing\nsociology is a science, we use systematic approaches to study-\ning the social world, and through those approaches, we both\nderive and test relatively abstract explanations for empirical\nphenomena.\nA sociological theory is not one that is philosophically ori-\nented that discusses the nature of social life--that would be\nwhat Chafetz (2004a) calls social theory. Sociological theory\nwould go beyond description and would be focused on\nexplaining how and why the empirical world operates as it\ndoes. This includes articulation of mechanisms (Hedstr\u00f6m &\ntheory itself is testable and falsifiable. Theories are evaluated,\ntherefore, not on their ability to completely explain one spe-\ncific set of experiences but instead their ability to explain (and\npredict as Smith-Lovin, 2000, would argue) the \"empirically\nthe contrary, provides thick description of social experiences,\noften elucidating the mechanisms to be included subsequently\nin sociological theories as they document social life in par-\nticular, ultimately leading to the refinement of sociological\ntheory. Both sociological and social theory are important in\nthe doing of our work as social scientists, as can be seen, for\nexample, in the case of Morris's (2012) examination of gen-\nder and education in a two low-income high schools.\nHighlighting the inadequacy of contemporary sociological\ntheories about educational attainment in explaining the edu-\ncational gender gap, Morris develops an argument about the\nimportance of how gender is constructed in a place, how it is\ncontextualized, as an additional mechanism that explains how\nyoung men and women are handicapped in the pursuit of edu-\ncation. His ethnographic work yields additional insight into\nmechanisms through which gender inequality is perpetuated.\nIn her critique of and response to Chafetz (2004a), Baber\n(2004) argues that theory should guide scholarship but should\nsimultaneously allow for the building of bridges between\nscholars and activists in the pursuit of reducing gender\ninequality. Therefore, social theory with its focus on how\ninequalities are experienced by individuals may be of more\nuse and value to practitioners than is sociological theory with\nits focus on prediction and explanation.\nMy view of the discipline of sociology is one that is based\non the distinction articulated by Chafetz (2004a). Our goal is\nto better understand the social world through the use of sys-\ntematic data collection and analysis. The creation of better\nexplanations (theories) is paramount. I also concur with\nincluded) who note that a feminist empiricist approach (one\nthat seeks to investigate power relations in a society through\nthe best methods and analysis techniques for the question at\nhand) is not at odds with the notion of the purpose of sociol-\nogy as a discipline nor the feminist epistemological frame-\nwork that seeks to eliminate gender (and other forms of)\ninequality. Some feminist sociologists have argued for the\nuse of \"different\" methodologies, pointing to the positivist\nstraw man as a part of the problem of the continuation of\nSprague and her colleagues (Sprague, 2005; Sprague &\nZimmerman, 1993), I disagree. If the goal of a feminist soci-\nology is to (a) systematically study the social world and\ndevelop explanations for empirical reality which then lead to\n(b) the elimination of gender inequality, then the methods\nthat we use to collect and analyze the empirical world must\nbe as diverse and responsive as the world itself. Indeed, those\nfeminist critiques of \"science\" and discomfort with \"more\nobjective\" approaches to studying the social world miss the\nbig picture. We cannot eradicate gender inequality by amass-\ning many thick descriptions of women's (or men's) lives\nbased on their standpoint, location in the matrix of domina-\ntion, or documentation of how their social location reflects\nThese examples of social theory are but one piece of a larger\npuzzle. The creation of systematic explanations for aspects\nof the empirically knowable world (here that aspect of the\nsocial world is gender inequality) that can be tested and\npotentially altered and/or falsified given empirical scrutiny is\nthe goal, and all approaches to understanding the social\nworld are needed to complete this task. As Walker (2004)\nrightly argues in her response to Chafetz (2004a), \"[c]\nompared with theory developed by so-called objective\nobservers, acknowledging our own perspectives and asking\nhow the world looks to others eventually will lead to rich\ntheory closely linked to social life\" (p. 991).\nThat said, theories must imply how they would be empiri-\ncally tested. We must have research methodologies in our sci-\nence that facilitate our testing of our theories. Theories about\nthe social world that do not readily lend themselves to empiri-\ncal scrutiny and potential falsification, that is, have no meth-\nodological implications for how researchers would go about\ncollecting and analyzing empirical materials, nor how the\ntheory's premises, postulates, mechanisms, and processes can\nbe evaluated and potentially falsified are not sociological\ntheories. In this case, the content of the empirical material is\nirrelevant. If a theory that purports to describe gender inequal-\nity and its reproduction cannot be potentially falsified, it\nwould not meet the definition of a sociological theory.\nThe Case of \"Doing Gender\"\n\"Doing Gender,\" the 1987 article, is the most cited article in\nthe discipline by most metrics (West & Zimmerman, 2009).\nThe argument, as restated by West and Zimmerman in 2009,\nis as follows. One's sex (female or male) is usually deter-\nmined by the possession of female or male genitalia (see\nnature of this categorization). Sex categorization, building\non Goffman (1956), occurs through \"the display and recog-\nnition of socially regulated external insignia of sex--such as\ndeportment, dress, and bearing\" (West & Zimmerman, 2009,\np. 113). Sex category and gender are related in that gender is\nabout being recognized as someone inhabiting a sex cate-\ngory--and \"being accountable to current cultural concep-\ntions of conduct becoming to--or compatible with the\n`essential natures' of--a woman or man\" (West &\nized as an ongoing process, a doing rather than a being.\nWest and Zimmerman's (2009) article was the conclusion\nto a symposium on their original piece. In it, they lament that\nauthors (including some in the symposium) have misused\ntheir concept, so much so that they felt the need to rearticu-\nlate its premises. One key critique was the use of \"doing gen-\nder\" as an explanation for the reproduction of gender\ninequality. This usage presumes that \"gender\" is a thing and\nthat \"doing it\" reproduces the status quo. Indeed, they argue\nthat because gender is done and that it requires individuals\nbeing held morally accountable to current cultural norms\nascribed to a sex category, the performance of gender should\nand must change over time--but that has little to do (directly)\nwith the reproduction of gender inequality.\nHowever, many authors, including myself, have invoked\n\"doing gender\" as a theory for why gender inequality is\nbeing reproduced. We have argued that, among other things,\nthe reason men do less housework than do women is because\nthey believe they are being held morally accountable to the\nsex category of \"male.\" Thus, not doing housework is \"doing\ngender.\" But as we use the language of \"doing gender,\" we\nare falling into the trap that West and Zimmerman argue is\ndiametrically opposed to how they had conceived of the con-\ncept. Gender is not a thing that is done, that is, a noun.\nInstead, \"doing gender\" is a verb phrase, a process.\nOther authors have noted that \"doing gender\" as a theory\nhas been misused. Deutsch (2007) recounts many examples\nof research that, she argues, utilize \"doing gender\" as a the-\nory of gender maintenance. Risman (2009) also notes that\n\"doing gender\" has been invoked to document multiple mas-\nculinities and femininities; she encourages researchers to\ninvestigate sites where women and men are \"undoing gen-\nZimmerman (2009) note, \"an emphasis on `undoing gender'\ndeflects attention away from the situational character of gen-\nder accountability, and circumstantial modifications\" (p. 118).\nus to talk about how we can \"undo gender,\" that is, to high-\nlight \"social processes that underlie resistance against con-\nventional gender relations and on how successful change in\nthe power dynamics and inequities between men and women\na presumption that gender is a thing that exists to maintain\ninequality between women and men. The focus is on the\ngerund--\"doing\" versus \"undoing\" rather than the phrase\n\"doing gender\" versus \"undoing gender.\" West and\nZimmerman (2009) argue that this semantic difference is one\nof the crucial points of their theory and the place where the\nusage of their theory has been problematic.\nThis process of \"doing gender,\" as described by West\nple behave as they do. People believe they are being held\nmorally accountable to a sex category and behave accord-\ning to their understanding of contemporary cultural norms\naround that sex category. This explanation for human\nbehavior fits the definition of a sociological theory on the\nface of it, in that it is potentially falsifiable. However, what\nare the testable hypotheses derived from this explanation?\nIs the underlying abstract process falsifiable? Is there ever\na circumstance that humans will not be behaving as they do\nat least in part because they believe they will be held mor-\nally accountable for their behavior? For example, Hirschi's\n(1969) social control theory highlights the centrality of\nbeing held morally accountable to a particular peer group\neven among deviants. Thus, the use of \"sociological the-\nory\" as a descriptor for \"doing gender\" may not be war-\nranted. This distinction is more than semantic, as a large\nbody of scholarship has been published that purports to find\nsupport for this theory. And much of this scholarship,\nincluding the articles in the 2009 Gender & Society sympo-\nsium, frames \"doing gender\" as an explanation for the\nreproduction of gender inequality, thus solidifying its posi-\ntion in the feminist sociological canon.\nHerein lies the irony. Based on the arguments presented\nhere, \"doing gender\" does not meet the definition of a socio-\nlogical theory that explains the reproduction of gender\ninequality. But West and Zimmerman never intended it to be.\nResituating \"Doing Gender\" Into\nSociological Theories\nWest andFenstermaker(1995)extendWest andZimmerman's\n(1987) argument to other forms of difference (and categori-\ncal inequalities; Tilly, 1998) by noting that distinctions\namong groups are not essential but must be created and\nmaintained. Interestingly, they argue that difference is a\nsocial doing, a mechanism that helps explain how categori-\ncal inequalities are reproduced. Following this logic, both\n\"doing gender\" and \"doing difference\" are themselves not\ntheories, but are mechanisms through which inequalities are\nreproduced.\n4 SAGE Open\nTherefore, \"doing gender\" (and \"doing difference\") is\nuseful for explaining the reproduction of inequality when\nincorporated as a mechanism into broader theoretical expla-\nnations. The notion of \"doing gender\" is a key explanatory\nmechanism invoked by Chafetz (1990) in her theory explain-\ning the links between macro- and micro-level gender\ninequality as well as by Ridgeway (2011) in her specifica-\ntion of status expectations theory as applied to gender\ninequality. Clearly articulated mechanisms, such as those\nimplied in the \"doing gender\" approach, provide insight into\nthe \"black box\" of sociological theory. These mechanisms\ndescribe the how and why of a theory. As Gross (2009)\nargues, mechanisms must be centered around social action.\nIn the case of Chafetz (1990), knowing one will be held\naccountable for one's behavior based on sex category leads\nwomen and men to behave in ways that reinforce patriarchal\nnorms at the micro level. Furthermore, these norms of moral\naccountability are part of the cultural ideology that con-\nstructs appropriate behaviors for women and men in institu-\ntional settings. Ridgeway, in some ways building on this\nidea, notes that gender is like a ghost in all interactions; it is\nthere even when it is not being directly invoked. Individuals\nare being held accountable to culturally constructed norms\nof behavior tied to sex categories even in situations when\ngender is irrelevant to the task at hand (Ridgeway, 2011).\nThus, \"doing gender\" as a concept is one of the mechanisms\ninvoked in Ridgeway's specification of status expectations\ntheory, as it is one of the explanations for how gender\ninequality is reproduced through everyday interactions.\nCalls for research focusing on \"undoing gender\" (Deutsch,\n2007), where scholars examine how behaviors reduce\nthat \"doing gender\" is not about the maintenance of gender\ninequality (although Deutsch (2007) is accurate in her\ndescription regarding how the theory is used). Instead, it is a\nset of explanations for the origins and maintenance of cul-\nturally constructed norms of behavior tied to sex categories.\nAs a mechanism, \"doing gender\" explains how culturally\nconstructed norms of behavior tied to sex categories are\nmaintained as well as challenged and modified, as people\nare held accountable to the contemporary norms.As Deutsch\n(2007) demonstrates, norms are modified through interac-\ntion and structural shifts but the processes of holding people\naccountable to those culturally constructed norms of behav-\nior tied to sex category remain the same. \"Doing gender\" is\nnot intended to explain the maintenance of gender inequal-\nnism that can be used to explain the reproduction of, and\npossibly the disruption of, culturally constructed norms of\nbehavior tied to sex category.\nWhat does this mean, then, for the disposition of research\nthat purports to test or utilize \"doing gender\" theory? I would\nargue that this voluminous body of scholarship is quite\nimportant to our understanding of the social world but as\nexamples of \"doing gender\" as a mechanism for the\nreproduction of gender inequality. Understanding the lives of\nmen and women as they are lived is important. We cannot\nignore how social location impacts lives, nor should we min-\nimize scholarship that has documented how oppression and\ndomination, as well as privilege and entitlement, operate in\npeople's lives. But as Schrock and Schwalbe (2009) argue,\nsimply documenting \"multiple masculinities\" or \"multiple\nfemininities\" based on interlocking axes of domination\nmasks the underlying processes that reproduce gender\ninequality structurally. For sociologists, both those of us\nembracing the label of feminist and those who do not, our\ngoal remains the same. If we want to change the world, we\nmust first understand it. And true sociological understanding\nis derived from the principles that make sociology the disci-\npline that it is--rigorous, systematic approaches for the col-\nlection and analysis of materials regarding empirically\nknown phenomena and \"relatively abstract explanations\" for\nthose phenomena that are empirically testable and falsifiable.\n\"Doing gender\" as a concept, and research invoking it, has a\nplace in our science, albeit one more in line with what the\nconcepts' originators had intended than how it has regularly\nbeen used.\nAuthor's Note\nThis article originated in, and benefited from, conversation with\nstudents in my graduate Gender and Social Structure course in Fall\nSemester 2012.
