The EF is the proportion of all\ncases of the outcome occurring in a\ngiven population that can be attrib-\nuted to exposure to the risk factor; it is\nsometimes referred to as the pop-\nulation-attributable risk.19 Because the\nEF is a function of both the RR and\nthe population prevalence of exposure\nto the risk factor, common risk factors\nAuthor Affiliations: Departments of Pediatrics and of\nEpidemiology and Biostatistics, McGill University, Fac-\nulty of Medicine, Montreal, Quebec (Drs Kramer and\nPlatt and Mr Yang); Bureau of Reproductive and Child\nHealth, Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, Health\nCanada, Ottawa, Ontario (Dr Demissie); Depart-\nment of Environmental and Community Medicine, Uni-\nversity of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Pis-\ncataway (Dr Demissie); Departments of Pediatrics and\nCommunity Medicine, University of Calgary Faculty\nof Medicine, Calgary, Alberta (Dr Sauve\n\u00b4); and De-\npartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of\nBritish Columbia, Vancouver (Dr Liston).\nContributing members of the Fetal and Infant Health\nStudy Group are listed at the end of this article.\nCorresponding Author:  , 1020\nPine Ave W, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 1A2\n(e-mail: mkrame@po-box.mcgill.ca).\nContext The World Health Organization defines preterm birth as birth at less than\n37 completed gestational weeks, but most studies have focused on very preterm in-\nfants (birth at 32 weeks) because of their high risk of mortality and serious morbid-\nity. However, infants born at 32 through 36 weeks are more common and their public\nhealth impact has not been well studied.\nObjective Toassessthequantitativecontributionofmild(birthat34-36gestationalweeks)\nand moderate (birth at 32-33 gestational weeks) preterm birth to infant mortality.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Population-based cohort study using linked\nsingleton live birth\u00adinfant death cohort files for US birth cohorts for 1985 and 1995\nMain Outcome Measures Relative risks (RRs) and etiologic fractions (EFs) for over-\nall and cause-specific early neonatal (age 0-6 days), late neonatal (age 7-27 days),\npostneonatal (age 28-364 days), and total infant death among mild and moderate\npreterm births vs term births (at 37 gestational weeks).\nResults Relative risks for infant death from all causes among singletons born at 32\nrespectively, at 32 through 33 gestational weeks and 6.3% and 8.0%, respectively, at\nthrough 36 gestational weeks exceeded those for births at 28 through 31 gestational\nweeks. Substantial RRs were observed overall for the neonatal (eg, for early neonatal\ntional weeks; EFs, 3.6% and and 6.2% for US and Canadian infants, respectively) and\npostneonatal (RRs, 2.1-3.8 and 3.0-7.0 for US and Canadian infants, respectively, born\nspectively) periods and for death due to asphyxia, infection, sudden infant death syn-\ndrome, and external causes. Except for a reduction in the RR and EF for neonatal mor-\ntality due to infection, the patterns have changed little since 1985 in either country.\nConclusions Mild\u00ad and moderate\u00adpreterm birth infants are at high RR for death dur-\ning infancy and are responsible for an important fraction of infant deaths.\naccount for much higher EFs than do\nrare risk factors. For example, an\nanomalous coronary artery is associ-\nated with a very high RR of myocar-\ndial infarction but (owing to its\nextreme rarity) a very low EF. By con-\ntrast, cigarette smoking, which is\nhighly prevalent, accounts for an\nappreciable portion of myocardial\ninfarctions despite its modestly\nelevated RR.\nWe hypothesized that mild and\nmoderate preterm births, which we\nof gestation, respectively, are associ-\nated with an increased risk of infant\nmortality relative to term births. We\nfurther hypothesized that mild and\nmoderate preterm births account for\nan important fraction of infant deaths.\nIn particular, we suspected that the\nincreased RRs and substantial EFs for\ninfant death would be most pro-\nnounced for specific groups of causes\n(infection, sudden infant death syn-\ndrome [SIDS], and external causes\nsuch as unintentional injuries and\nabuse) and would be concentrated in\nthe postneonatal rather than the neo-\nnatal period. Finally, we hypothesized\nthat these increased risks would be\nobserved in both the United States\nand Canada and would have dimin-\nished only slightly over time.\nMETHODS\nWe used 4 data sources for our analy-\nsis, all based on linked live birth\u00adinfant\ndeath cohort files. For the United States,\nince of Ontario because of docu-\nmented problems with data quality. We\nused 3 years for each time period in\nCanadatoincreasethenumberofdeaths\nin the file and thus provide more stable\nestimates of risk. Data from Newfound-\nlandwerenotavailablefortheearlierpe-\nriod. For the US file, gestational age is\nbased on the algorithm used by the Na-\ntionalCenterforHealthStatistics,which\nis calculated from date of the last men-\nstrual period unless the last menstrual\nperiod is not reported or birth weight is\nincompatible with the reported gesta-\ntional age, in which case the clinical es-\ntimate (as recorded on the birth certifi-\ncate) is substituted. For the Canadian\nfile, gestational age is that recorded on\nthe birth certificate by the responsible\nphysician, which, in recent years, ap-\npears to be based primarily on early ul-\ntrasound dating. For causes of death, we\nused the classification proposed by the\nInternational Collaborative Effort on\nPerinatal and Infant Mortality, which\ngroups the International Classification of\nDiseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes\nfor the underlying cause of death re-\ncorded on death certificates.20 The In-\nternational Collaborative Effort on Peri-\nnatal and Infant Mortality grouping\nincludes congenital conditions, imma-\nturity-related conditions, asphyxia-\nrelated conditions, infections, other spe-\ncific conditions, SIDS, external causes,\nand remaining causes.\nFor data analysis, we restricted the\nstudy sample to singleton live births and\ncategorized age at death as early neo-\nnatal (age 0-6 days), late neonatal (age\n364 days). We calculated risks for late\nneonatal death based on early neo-\nnatal survivors and risks for post-\nneonatal death based on late neonatal\nsurvivors. Cause-specific mortality risks\nare based on all infants at risk of death\nfor each cause; ie, they include infants\ndying of other causes in the denomi-\nnator. Effects were expressed as ad-\njusted RRs and 95% confidence inter-\nvals and EFs based on multiple logistic\nregression analyses; term (37 com-\npleted gestational weeks) births served\nas the reference group for these calcu-\nlations. Odds ratios were converted to\nRRs using the method of Zhang and\nYu.21 The US regression models were\nrous vs multiparous), race (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black,\nHispanic, and other), and education\nyears of school), while only age and par-\nity were available for adjustment in the\nCanadian file. All analyses were per-\nformed with SAS-PC version 6.12 (SAS\nInstitute, Cary, NC).\nEtiologic fractions for the poly-\nchotomous categories of preterm birth\non the method of Miettinen19 as fol-\nlows:\nEF =\nPi\n(RRi\nPi\n(RRi\nwhere Pi\nis the prevalence of the ith pre-\nis the\ncorresponding RR of mortality in that\ngroup relative to term (birth at 37 ges-\ntational weeks) infants and  indi-\ncates summation over the i preterm\ncategories.\nRESULTS\nInfant mortality rates and gestational\nage distributions among all live births\nare shown in TABLE 1 for both coun-\ntries and both time periods.

Separate estimates are shown for\ntotal infant mortality and early neona-\ntal, late neonatal, and postneonatal mor-\ntality. As expected, RRs and EFs were\nhighest for births at less than 28 ges-\ntational weeks. Infants born at 32\nthrough 33 gestational weeks were at\nhigh RR of infant death in both coun-\ntries. To our surprise, the largest RRs\nwere seen in the neonatal period. For\ntional weeks, the RRs were somewhat\nlower but still substantial and statisti-\ncally significant. In general, the RRs\nwere higher in Canada than in the\nUnited States. The EFs ranged from\n36 gestational weeks and were slightly\nhigher in Canada. The sum of the EFs\ngestational weeks exceeded those for in-\ntional weeks for all 3 ages at death.\nCongenital anomalies may lead to ei-\nther spontaneous or iatrogenic pre-\nterm delivery, but preterm birth can-\nnot cause these anomalies (although it\ncan increase the risk of death among in-\nfants with anomalies). TABLE 3 pre-\nsents a similar analysis to that shown\nin Table 2 after excluding deaths due\nto congenital conditions. The RRs and\nEFs are only slightly lower than those\nshown in Table 2.\nFewer moderately or mildly pre-\nterm infants died of asphyxia-related\nconditions, and this resulted in rather\nwide confidence intervals for the RRs.\nNonetheless, the risks were quite el-\nevated, especially for infants born at 32\nthrough 33 gestational weeks, as shown\nin TABLE 4. As expected for this group\nof causes, the excess deaths were con-\ncentrated in the neonatal period in both\ncountries. The EFs were substantial for\ntional weeks.\nFor deaths due to infection, we had\nhypothesized increased risks in the\npostneonatal period. As shown in\nTABLE 5, this hypothesis was con-\nfirmed for both mild and moderate\npreterm births in both countries,\nalthough we were surprised to ob-\nserve even higher RRs of death from in-\nfection in the early and late neonatal pe-\nriods than those in the postneonatal\nperiod. Etiologic fractions were 4.2% to\ntational weeks and ranged from 1.9%\ngestational weeks. Additional adjust-\nment for maternal smoking for the\nRRs. With adjustment for smoking, RR\nwas 8.0, the same as without adjust-\nment. For infants born at 34 through\n36 gestational weeks, EFs for early\nand late neonatal death due to infec-\ntion decreased between the 2 time\nperiods, eg, in the United States the\nlate neonatal death. These were the\nonly consistent temporal changes\nobserved.\nTABLE 6 summarizes the results for\npostneonatal deaths due to SIDS and\nall external causes. The RRs ranged\nate preterm category, and most were\nstatistically significant; for SIDS and\nall external causes, these RRs were\nslightly but nonsignificantly higher in\nCanada than in the United States. In\nboth countries, EFs ranged from 1.5%\ngestational weeks but rose to 3.8% to\n36 gestational weeks. The latter values\nexceeded the total EFs for infants\n31 gestational weeks. Additional\nadjustment for maternal smoking for\nthe RRs for SIDS. With adjustment,\nadjustment.\nCOMMENT\nMost of our hypotheses were sup-\nported by the data. Mildly and moder-\nately preterm infants did indeed have\nhigh RRs and appreciable EFs for\npostneonatal deaths due to infection,\nSIDS, and external causes, including\nabuse and maltreatment. We were\nsurprised,however,toobservethat their\nrisks were also elevated for neonatal\ndeath, especially neonatal death due\nto asphyxia and infection. Our results\nhighlight the difference between\nthe clinical and public health per-\nspectives, ie, between absolute risk,\non the one hand, and RR and EF, on\nthe other.\nDespite the low absolute risks of\ndeath in these gestational age groups,\nTable 1.

In\nfact, the combined impact exceeded\ngestational weeks for all causes and\nall 3 ages at death and even that of\ninfants born at less than 28 gesta-\ntional weeks for postneonatal deaths.\nThese findings do not in any way\ndiminish the clinical and public\nhealth importance of extremely pre-\nterm infants. Infants born at 27 ges-\ntational weeks or earlier account for\na very large proportion of neonatal\ndeaths despite their rare occurrence\nin Canada).\nOur results were fairly consistent be-\ntween the United States and Canada.\nThe RRs of mortality associated with\nmild and moderate preterm birth were\ngenerally higher in Canada. A small part\nof these differences in gestational age\u00ad\nspecific mortality was explained by the\nlower absolute and relative mortality\nrisks among US black vs white pre-\nterm infants, but the RRs for Canada re-\nmained substantially higher than those\nfor the United States even after restrict-\ning the US analysis to non-Hispanic\ntational weeks for total infant mortal-\nity among all singleton live births). An\neven smaller part of the difference was\nthe result of the slightly lower abso-\nlute risks for term (birth at 37 gesta-\ntional weeks) births in Canada (ie, to-\nare currently investigating other po-\ntential explanations and particularly\nwhether the differences might be arti-\nfacts caused by errors in estimation of\ngestational age.22 Regardless of the ex-\nplanation, however, the prevalence of\nbirths in these gestational age catego-\nries was much lower in Canada than in\nthe United States, and the EFs were\ntherefore similar in the 2 countries.\nExcept for a slight reduction in\nneonatal deaths attributable to infec-\ntion among infants born at 34\nthrough 36 gestational weeks, the\npatterns we observed have not\nchanged much over the last 10 years\nin either country. In other words,\ndespite the continued reduction in\ngestational age\u00adspecific mortality\nwith improvements in high-risk\nmild and moderate preterm births\ncontinue to contribute an important\nfraction of infant deaths from a vari-\nety of causes.
