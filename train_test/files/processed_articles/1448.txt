However, current methods for this test assume a simple random sample and may not\nbe appropriate for sample surveys with complex survey designs. In this paper, the authors present a test for Hardy-\nWeinberg equilibrium that adjusts for the sample weights and correlation of data collected in complex surveys. The\nauthors perform this test by using a simple adjustment to procedures developed to analyze data from complex\nsurvey designs available within the SAS statistical software package (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).\nUsing 90 genetic markers from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the authors found that\nsurvey-adjusted and -unadjusted estimates of the disequilibrium coefficient were generally similar within self-\nreported races/ethnicities. However, estimates of the variance of the disequilibrium coefficient were significantly\ndifferent between the 2 methods. Because the results of the survey-adjusted tests account for correlation among\nparticipants sampled within the same cluster, and the possibility of having related individuals sampled from the\nsame household, the authors recommend use of this test when analyzing genetic data originating from sample\nsurveys with complex survey designs to assess deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.\ncomplex survey design; design effect; genetic association studies; Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium\nAbbreviations: DA, design adjusted; HWD, Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium; HWE, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; NHANES (III),\n(Third) National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; RS, Rao-Scott; SRS, simple random sample.\nIncreases in the availability of genetic data have resulted\nin a growing number of studies attempting to characterize\ngenetic susceptibility to common complex diseases. How-\never, few genetic associations reported as significant are\nreplicated in multiple studies. Departures from Hardy-\nWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) in control populations may\nindicate systematic genotyping errors and other biases that\ncould lead to lack of replication (1\u00ad3). Therefore, testing\nHWE of marker genotype frequencies has been widely rec-\nommended as a crucial step in any population-based genetic\nassociation study (4).\nSeveral methods have been developed to test HWE in\nsimple random samples (SRSs). Emigh (5) compares vari-\nous tests for the goodness of fit of a population with HWE\nwith respect to their power and the accuracy of their distri-\nbutional approximations. Several exact tests for HWE have\nbeen proposed (6\u00ad8). Bayesian approaches to HWE tests\nhave been discussed recently (9\u00ad11). Still, the most com-\nmon way to test for departures from HWE is through a\nWhen data are expensive to collect for a population-based\ngenetic association study, it can be cost-efficient to sample\nin 2 or more stages. Whittemore and Halpern (13) described\nmultistage sampling in genetic epidemiology and used ge-\nnetic studies of US blacks and of prostate cancer to examine\nsome design issues involved in multistage sampling. Scott\nand Wild (14) examined logistic regression models in case-\ncontrol studies in which controls (and possibly cases) were\nobtained by using a complex sampling plan involving mul-\ntistage sampling. It is important to investigate the proper\nanalytic method when analyzing data from complex multi-\nstage surveys.\nSelection of samples in surveys rarely involves just sim-\nple random sampling. Instead, more complex sampling\nschemes are usually used, involving, for example, stratifica-\ntion and multistage sampling. Point estimates and the vari-\nance of population parameters are impacted by the value of\neach observation's analysis weight, adjustments for selec-\ntion probabilities, and other survey design features such as\nstratification and clustering. Hence, the assumption of sim-\nple random sampling can yield biased point estimates and/or\nan underestimation of the variance of the point estimates if\nthe complex sampling design is ignored.\nIn this paper, we derive and present an appropriate test for\ndeviations in HWE in the analysis of population-based ge-\nnetic data obtained from sample surveys with complex sur-\nvey designs. We compare this method with results from\ngoodness-of-fit v2 tests that assume an SRS by using data\nfrom the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\nTest for HWE\nSuppose n individuals are genotyped at a biallelic (Aa)\nmarker. We are interested in some basic properties of this\nmarker, such as genotype frequency, allele frequency,\n100(1 \u00c0 a) % confidence intervals of these frequencies,\nand whether it is in HWE.\nLet Yij\n\u00bc 1 if the jth allele of a marker of the ith individual\nis A; Yij\n\u00bc 0 otherwise (j \u00bc 1, 2, and i \u00bc 1, 2, . . ., n).

They showed\nthat the test statistic is asymptotically distributed as\na weighted sum of independent v2\nvariables and that the\nweights are the eigenvalues of a generalized design-effects\nmatrix. Their analyses showed that survey design can have\na substantial impact on the type 1 error. For one-way tables,\nthe SURVEYFREQ procedure in SAS software provides\na design-based goodness-of-fit test when null proportions\nare specified using the first-order and second-order correc-\ntions given by Rao and Scott. The Rao-Scott (RS) v2 test\nstatistic is computed as QRS\n\u00bc QP\n=d, where d is a design\ncorrection that requires knowledge of variance estimates (or\ndesign effects) for only individual cells in the goodness-of-\nfit test statistic. For a one-way table with k cells, QRS has\na v2 distribution with (k \u00c0 1) degrees of freedom. The\ncomputation of QRS\nusing the SURVEYFREQ procedure\nin SAS software is given in Appendix 1 (18).

Since we\nused the SURVEYFREQ procedure in SAS and substituted\nour design correction for the design correction in the pro-\ncedure, we expressed the design correction as a function of\ndesign-effects estimates of genotype frequency.\nApplication to NHANES III: US population-based survey\nwith complex design\nNHANES is a nationally representative survey of the US\npopulation conducted by the National Center for Health\nStatistics. Genetic data are available through the National\nCenter for Health Statistics on 7,159 participants from phase\n2 of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III). Linkage of the NHANES III pheno-\ntype data with this genetic information provides the oppor-\ntunity to conduct a vast array of outcome studies designed to\ninvestigate the association of a wide variety of health factors\nThe initial stage of sampling in the NHANES III design\nconsisted of stratifying and selecting primary sampling\nunits, which are counties or groups of counties in the United\nStates. The primary sampling units were assigned to a par-\nticular stratum based on health and demographic informa-\ntion such as age, sex, and ethnicity and are selected with\nprobability proportional to population size. After the pri-\nmary sampling units were selected, they were subsampled\nsuccessively in terms of census enumeration districts, clus-\nters of households, households, eligible persons, and, finally,\nsample persons. Specific populations including young chil-\ndren, older persons, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican\nAmericans were oversampled. Multiple sample persons\ncould be selected from the same household. Each sampled\nperson was assigned the inverse of his or her selection prob-\nability as the sampling weight. The final analysis weights\nincorporated the selection probabilities and include adjust-\nments for nonresponse. The nonresponse-adjusted weights\nwere further poststratified by age, gender, and race/ethnicity\nto account for noncoverage and to bring the final national\nestimates in line with population counts (21).\nWe examined 90 variants in 50 genes that may play a role\nin the etiology of several diseases or conditions of public\nhealth significance. In this study, we considered the 3 major\nself-reported race/ethnic populations in the United States:\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican\nAmerican. To explore the effect of differential sampling\nfrom multiple ethnic populations, we also considered these\n3 race/ethnicity groups combined. We removed any variants\nwith expected frequencies of less than 5 for each genotype\nunder the null hypothesis to avoid potential problems asso-\nvariants for non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,\nMexican Americans, and the combined race/ethnicity\ngroup, respectively. The expected frequency was calculated\nby multiplying the effective sample size by the genotype\nfrequency. The effective sample size is the sample size di-\nvided by the design correction for the genotype frequency\nunder the null hypothesis. To determine the origin and ex-\ntent of differences between the DA HWE tests that adjusted\nfor the NHANES III complex survey design with HWE tests\nconducted by assuming an SRS, we examined the differ-\nences in minor allele frequencies, HWD coefficients, and\nvariances of the HWD coefficient.\nRESULTS\nThe DA and SRS minor allele frequencies were not so\ndifferent in any of the populations. However, the range was\nlargest for the combined race/ethnicity group (combined--\nseparate races/ethnicities (non-Hispanic whites--median:\n(Figure 1).\nThe differences between the DA and SRS HWD coeffi-\ncients followed a pattern similar to that for the differences\nbetween the minor allele frequencies.

Genetic variants with significant DA test results\nbut nonsignificant SRS results, or vice versa, for non-\nHispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans,\nand the combined groups are presented in Tables 3\u00ad6. All 4\nmarkers in Table 3 resulted in HWE for the SRS test and\nHWD for the DA test. Fifty percent of the markers tested in\nTables 4 and 5 resulted in HWE for the SRS test and HWD\nfor the DA test. Of the 22 markers shown in Table 6, 18 were\nin HWD for the SRS test and HWE for the DA test.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this paper, we present a method of testing HWE of\ngenetic data obtained from large-scale population surveys\nthat incorporate design features such as clustering, stratifi-\ncation, and unequal weights. We found, within ethnic pop-\nulations, that our DA method provides similar estimates of\nHWD coefficients but different estimates of the variance of\nthe HWD coefficients compared with the unadjusted\nmethod. The test statistics derived from the 2 methods were\nnot significantly different in general, but, in a few cases,\ndifferent conclusions were possible. Choosing the results\nof the SRS test would not be appropriate in these situations\nbecause these results could be biased. Regarding the\nFigure 1.

Hence, all analyses of\nHWE need to incorporate sample weights and the cluster\ndesign to avoid misinterpretation of results.\nIn a recent paper, Li and Graubard (22) derived a test for\nHWE for complex sample designs by extending the standard\nPearson v2 test to a quadratic test statistic that converges in\ndistribution to a linear combination of independently iden-\ntically distributed v2 random variables. The coefficients of\nthe linear combination are eigenvalues (generalized design\neffects) of a generalized design matrix. The first-order RS\nadjustment corrects the asymptotic expectation of the Pear-\nson statistic by dividing the test statistic by the mean of the\nunknown eigenvalues. As shown in Appendix 1, the SUR-\nVEYFREQ procedure estimates this mean as a function of\nthe design-effect estimates of the cell proportions. In our\nmethod, we directly derived the approximate variance of\nFigure 2.

Li and Graubard also\nexamined the accuracy of type I error for the minor allele\nfrequencies and the number of degrees of freedom for esti-\nmating the covariance matrix that affect the asymptotic dis-\ntribution. The degrees of freedom for the variance estimates\ncan be rather small in some situations and thus using an F\ndistribution instead of a v2 distribution works much better,\nas noted by Thomas and Rao (23).\nTo our knowledge, NHANES is the first survey with a na-\ntional probability sample design to make population genetic\nTable 4.

Therefore, allele\nfrequencies, genotype frequencies, and associations be-\ntween disease and genetic variants are unbiased estimates\nof the respective population parameters. For example, gene\nvariant databases such as the International HapMap Project\n(http://www.hapmap.org) and the SNP500Cancer Database\n(http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov) are convenience samples\nand may not well represent the target populations (24, 25).\nPopulation-based estimates obtained from the NHANES III\nsurvey may help in estimating the US population that ben-\nefits from genomic-based tools, such as risk factor reduc-\ntion; disease screening efforts; or diagnostic tests, drugs, or\nother preventive or therapeutic interventions.\nThere have been discussions about whether the sampling\ndesign must be considered in the analysis of survey data\nfrom large-scale health surveys. Some guidelines are pro-\nvided for when to use sample weights and the features of the\nsample design in the analysis of survey data (26, 27). There\nare several reasons to take into account the sampling design\nin testing for HWE. First, the HWE test examines whether\nTable 6.

As-\nsuming the sample is selected by using an SRS design does\nnot result in testing HWE for the target population. Second,\nsome correlation is likely among participants sampled\nwithin the same cluster, such as the selection of multiple\nindividuals in a household in the NHANES III sample. The\nnumber of individuals selected in a household in the sample\nranged from 1 to 11 with an average of 1.6, and some of\nthem may be related. When the v2 goodness-of-fit test for\nHWE is used on samples with related individuals, the type I\nerror could be greatly inflated.\nWhen calculating the variance for DA estimates, the first\n2 stages of the sample design--strata and primary sampling\nunits--are considered. When there are more related people\nin households within a primary sampling unit, the intraclass\ncorrelation that measures the internal homogeneity for the\nprimary sampling units, and consequently the variance of\nDA, increases. This increase in variance is taken into ac-\ncount in the design correction. A test for HWE suitable for\nany samples with related individuals has been proposed\n(28). However, our method does not require prior knowl-\nedge of the pedigree structure and can account for the cor-\nrelation among the sampled members whether they are\nrelated or not.\nTests of HWE may be used to examine the associations\nbetween genetic variants and diseases. For example, Lee\n(29) proposed scanning the genome for disease-susceptible\ngenes by testing for deviations from HWE in a gene bank of\naffected individuals under the assumption that the source\npopulation from which the cases arise is in HWE. Chen\nand Chatterjee (30) proposed an alternative analytic strategy\nto assess the association between a binary disease outcome\nand a genetic marker by comparing the observed genotype\nfrequencies of cases with the expected genotype frequencies\nof controls, assuming HWE. Song and Elston (31) derived\nan HWD trend test by calculating the difference between the\nHWE test statistic for cases and controls to fine-map\na disease-susceptible locus.\nMethods to appropriately analyze genetic data from stud-\nies involving complex survey designs, such as the proposed\ngenome-wide association studies of NHANES III and the\nNational Children's Study (www.nationalchildrensstudy.\ngov), will be needed in the near future. The HWE test pro-\nposed in this paper represents an essential step in addressing\nthat need.\n"
