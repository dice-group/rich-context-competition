At the time\nof their appointment, executive directors from outside are less well informed about the\ncompany and its employees than those appointed from inside. Thus, promoting a suitable\ncandidate from any internal position to a senior management position may be preferable\nto bringing in an outsider. Therefore, banks may only risk hiring executive directors whose\nabilities are not well known if it is absolutely necessary to do so. They may appoint an\nexecutive from the outside either because no suitable internal candidate with the skills\nneeded is available (Dalton and Kesner, 1985) or because the bank is in dire financial\nstraits. In line with the latter reason, a large number of studies show that executive\nturnovers are often preceded by poor performance (e.g. Barro and Barro, 1990; Houston\nStolz, 2012). In times of financial difficulties, the incoming executive from the outside is\nexpected to catch up, revise the strategy and restructure the organization. For example,\nthe appointment of John Cryan as the new CEO of Deutsche Bank in 2015 was described\nas follows: \"Cryan is cleaning up\" (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, October 8, 2015).\nA key question in this context is which executive director will be of most help in\nturning around bad financial performance and whether it is possible to identify execu-\ntives who outperform others. We study this question by investigating appointments to\nthe executive boards of German universal banks from 1993 to 2014. The answer to this\nquestion is relevant for academics and practitioners alike. In the case of banks, whose\ngovernance mechanisms potentially differ from those of non-financial firms (Adams and\nMehran, 2003), it is even more relevant because regulatory authorities often order finan-\ncially distressed banks to replace (in whole or in part) the management team in the hope\nthat incoming executive directors will clean up the bank. The German banking system is\nan excellent playground to address this question because German companies, especially\nthe German Mittelstand (i.e. small and mid-sized companies), (still) rely heavily on bank\nlending (e.g. Koetter and Wedow, 2010). Therefore, one may argue that finding good\nsuccessors is of even greater importance in this country than in those where a firm's fi-\nnance is less tied to banks.\nWe focus on managerial ability, as executives with high ability are expected to do a\nbetter job than those with low ability. Unfortunately, managerial ability is not directly\nobservable. We use two proxies of managerial ability to differentiate among outside ap-\npointments. Both measures follow the literature that suggests information of the previous\nbanks as possible indicators of managerial talent (e.g. Kaplan and Reishus, 1990; Fee and\nthat labor markets use firm performance as an indicator of managerial ability and that\nexecutives from superior-performing firms have developed valuable management skills \u00ad\nin the sense that these managers have learned \"how to win\" (Fee and Hadlock, 2003, p.\n1324). Following this line of reasoning, we build our first measure with the performance of\nexecutive directors' previous banks observed directly before they are appointed to another\nbank. The second measure is based on risk-return efficiency, which we will describe below.\nIn line with the argument that external successors are often appointed in bad financial\ntimes, we find negative performance effects for banks after appointing executive directors\nfrom the outside. We extend the literature on post-turnover performance effects (Schaeck\net al., 2012) by showing that executives with low managerial abilities, which we call bad\noutsiders, underperform with their new banks in the post-appointment period whereas\nexecutives with high managerial abilities, called good outsiders, only did so at the very\nbeginning of the post-appointment period. These different performance paths indicate\nthat not all executive directors appointed from outside are equally capable of improving\nbank performance. To the best of our knowledge, our study is one of the first to inves-\ntigate the link between post-appointment financial performance and managerial abilities\nof executive directors appointed to German banks. Documenting this heterogeneity in\npost-appointment performance is our first contribution to the literature.\nOur second contribution is methodological in nature and relates to how our second\nmeasure of managerial ability is constructed.1 We extract managerial ability from risk-\nreturn efficiency of executive directors' previous banks. Many recent studies have distilled\nmanagerial ability from cost efficiency (e.g. Demerjian et al., 2012; Francis, Hasan, Mani,\nand Ye, 2016) and profit efficiency (Andreou, Philip, and Robejsek, 2016) by separating\nfull efficiency into a part caused by firm or bank characteristics and another part which\nis attributed to managerial ability. We use their approach of separating full efficiency,\nbut we do not rely on cost or profit efficiency. Rather, we follow another strand of the\nbanking literature arguing that risk, which is immanent in the banking industry, is not\nsufficiently controlled for in cost and profit efficiency measures (Koetter, 2008; Hughes,\nLang, Mester, and Moon, 1996). Therefore, we estimate bank risk-return efficiency and\ndetermine the proportion of efficiency that can be attributed to the management by using\na Tobit regression. In doing so, we enhance the existing literature of managerial ability\nwith a combination of two approaches that have thus far been unconnected.\nA built-in problem of studies dealing with the link between performance and man-\nagerial heterogeneity, for instance in terms of managerial ability, is that executives are\nnot randomly assigned to institutions (Chang, Dasgupta, and Hilary, 2010). Good out-\nsiders may outperform bad outsiders not because the former are necessarily the better\nmanagers, but because they, due to their previous track record, have the opportunity\nto select the better banks. In other words, the performance differential between banks\nappointing good and bad outsiders might be driven by the managerial ability of the good\noutsiders or, alternatively, by their self-selection into better banks. Not all executive di-\nrectors will accept job offers at high-risk banks because these positions may come with a\nhigher likelihood of failure (Bushman, Zhonglan, and Wang, 2010; Schaeck et al., 2012)\nand executive directors care about their market value and reputation in the job market\nfor bank managers. One potential source of selection is that good outsiders (who may\nreceive many job offers because of their managerial ability) select low-risk banks while\nfor bad outsiders (who may receive few job offers) high-risk banks may be the only viable\nemployment option. To disentangle the two lines of reasoning, we exploit cross-sectional\nvariation in the data. We build our regression model2 in such a way that we are able to\n1We thank an anonymous referee for this valuable suggestion.\n2We estimate performance effects with dynamic panel estimations on several risk-adjusted perfor-\ncompare the post-appointment performance effects of good and bad outsiders in banks\nwith similar risk profiles in the pre-appointment period. We find that good outsiders\noutperform bad outsiders especially, but not exclusively, at high-risk banks.\nStudies dealing with bank corporate governance (see, the literature review by Haan\nand Vlahu (2016)) can be distinguished into three strands: (i) boards, (ii) ownership, and\n(iii) compensation (e.g. Diamond and Rajan, 2009; Fahlenbrach and Stulz, 2011). Our\nstudy contributes to the first two strands. While recent literature deals with ownership\nstructures (e.g. Berger, Clarke, Cull, Klapper, and Udell, 2005) and shareholder activism\n(e.g. Roman, 2015), we can only measure performance differentials of outside appoint-\nments separately for savings and private banks (cooperative as well as private commercial\nbanks). This is because few German private commercial banks are publicly listed with\ndispersed ownership. Consequently, our main contribution to the bank corporate gover-\nnance literature is related to the boards. While most studies deal with firms and banks in\none-tier board systems, our study comes from a country with a two-tier system. There-\nfore, we use the term \"outsider\" in a different way. For instance, studies on US banks\ndivide the board of directors into inside and outside directors. In these studies, directors\nwho are employed full-time at the bank are classified as insiders, whereas directors who\nare independent of the bank are called outside directors (e.g. Adams, Hermalin, and\nWeisbach, 2010). By contrast, the German corporate governance system often requires a\ndual board structure with an executive board (first tier) and a supervisory board (second\ntier) (Hackethal, Schmidt, and Tyrell, 2003). Almost all German universal banks have\nan executive and a supervisory board, with only very few exceptions, for instance, among\nsmall private commercial banks. The members of the executive board who manage the\nbank are monitored and advised by the supervisory board, which appoints or dismisses\nmembers of the executive board and approves executive directors' salaries. The executive\nboard has to report to the supervisory board on a regular basis. The supervisory board's\nresponsibilities are similar to those of US boards (Kaplan, 1994; Fauver and Fuerst, 2006).\nIn this study, we deal with the first tier of the system and investigate the performance\nimplications of appointing executive directors from the outside.\nIn this two-tier bank board system, several measures developed in the context of one-\ntier systems to describe CEO entrenchment and the strength of the board of directors\n(independence, non-staggered boards, anti-takeover protections) are either not defined\nor are unknown. More specifically, CEO duality often used in US studies to measure\nCEO entrenchment (e.g. Pathan and Skully, 2010; Pathan, 2009) cannot be applied since\nCEOs serving on the executive board are not allowed to serve on the supervisory board\nat the same time. Also, many dimensions of strength of the board of directors (e.g.\nRauch, 2016; Roman, 2015) are not applicable. The supervisory board consists of share-\nholders' representatives and elected employees according to the German codetermination\nlaw. Representatives of shareholders are from the outside (one possible exception could\nbe former CEOs appointed to the supervisory board after having finished serving on the\nexecutive board) and therefore all of them have to be classified as independent. Thus,\nan independence measure of the supervisory board will show little variation across banks.\nmance measures, in which we reduce performance persistence by sampling every other year.\nWhile we cannot replicate board measures used in studies on US banks, we test whether\nour results are robust to several measures that capture different facets of the executive\nboard, such as executive directors' tenure, age and academic degrees. These robustness\ntests do not alter our conclusion: banks hiring good outsiders outperform those hiring\nbad outsiders.\nStudying bank corporate governance is of particular relevance because recent studies\nidentify it as a contributing factor to the financial crisis (e.g. Diamond and Rajan, 2009;\nBerger et al., 2016). Berger et al. (2016), for example, find that in the case of US banks\nnon-CEO managers with high ownership stakes take higher risks, which consequently\nincreases the probability of bank default. However, not all studies come to the same\nconclusion. For example, Beltratti and Stulz (2012) investigate performance implications\nof shareholder-friendly boards. During the crisis, banks with shareholder-friendly boards\nsignificantly underperformed other banks. We follow this literature by measuring outside\npost-appointment effects separately for the pre- and post-crisis period. We find that the\nperformance differentials between good and bad outsiders strengthen in the post-crisis\nperiod.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops our hypothe-\nses and introduces our study design. Section 3 describes the data, provides descriptive\nstatistics, and introduces our econometric model. Section 4 discusses the results of bank\nperformance in the post-appointment period, and delivers complementary results. Section\n5 provides a conclusion to the study.\n2 Hypothesis development and study design\nOur study deals with members of the executive board who are appointed from outside\nthe bank. Such outside appointees already possess board experience and have developed\na set of skills in managing a bank, for example, with respect to implementing strategies,\nhedging financial risks and supervising a large number of employees. Thus, hiring an ex-\necutive director from outside may inject additional expertise into the boardroom (Boeker,\n1997) and potentially enhances the current management quality (Huson, Malatesta, and\nParrino, 2004). This increase in management quality is expected to lead to an increase in\nperformance. In line with this, several studies document that operating performance of\nnon-financial firms improves following senior executive turnover events (Denis and Denis,\nexamine post-turnover effects in the banking industry, find negative post-turnover perfor-\nmance effects. They argue that turnovers incurred costs (by the turnover itself or by the\nongoing restructuring process) that may contribute to greater losses and reduced prof-\nitability in the post-turnover period.\nAn interesting and relevant question is whether all outside appointments entail similar\npost-appointment performance effects since the literature documents that the group of\ncorporate executives is not homogeneous. Executives have different managerial styles,\nand heterogeneity among them matters for corporate decisions (Bertrand and Schoar,\ninside directors in the US. They find that firms' post-appointing operating performance\nis higher when inside directors hold outside directorships (which is interpreted as a proxy\nfor experience and management quality). Examining individual characteristics, Kaplan,\nKlebanov, and Sorensen (2012) find that subsequent firm performance after the appoint-\nment of CEOs is strongly related to what they call the general talent of those CEOs.\nWe hypothesize that the group of executive bank directors appointed from the outside is\nnot homogeneous, and possesses varying levels of managerial ability. We expect outsiders\nwith good managerial ability to outperform outsiders with bad managerial ability in the\npost-appointment period.\nUnfortunately, managerial ability cannot be directly observed. However, several stud-\nies find evidence supporting the argument that past performance is an indicator of man-\nagerial ability. Chang et al. (2010) argue that if past performance reflects CEO ability,\nthen the stock market reaction to CEO departure should depend on past performance,\nwhich is the result they find. Higher past performance leads to more outside director-\nships, as shown by Kaplan and Reishus (1990) for senior executives, Ferris, Jagannathan,\nand Pritchard (2003) for corporate directors and executives, and Harford and Schonlau\n(2013) for CEOs and directors. Fee and Hadlock (2003) find that CEOs appointed from\noutside the company come from firms with above-average stock performance. The merger-\nrelated literature also delivers insights into the relationship between past performance and\nmanagement outcomes. Wulf and Singh (2011) and Bargeron, Schlingemann, Stulz, and\nZutter (2009) find that target CEOs who perform better have a higher retention proba-\nbility. We follow the idea of measuring managerial ability by past performance and use\nthe past performance of the executives' previous banks to distinguish between two types\nof outside appointments.\nIn addition to past performance, we follow the novel approach of Demerjian et al.\n(2012) and rest our second measure on managerial efficiency. Demerjian et al. (2012) find\nthat the strong negative relationship between equity financing and returns is substantially\nlower for managers with higher managerial cost efficiency. They argue that the managers'\nability enables them to select the most promising projects with positive net present values.\nThis implies that managers with high managerial efficiency use issue proceeds more effec-\ntively. Francis et al. (2016) use the values of managerial ability provided by Demerjian\net al. (2012) to build an index of relative peer quality. They find that firms with higher\nrelative peer quality tend to earn higher risk-adjusted stock returns and to have higher\nprofitability growth than firms with lower values. Using managerial profit efficiency, An-\ndreou et al. (2016) find that banks managed by executives with higher abilities create\nmore liquidity and take on more risk. Our hypothesis is consequently that executive di-\nrectors with higher values of managerial efficiency help the bank more in turning around\npoor performance than those with lower values of managerial efficiency.\nAn outside appointment is very likely not an exogenous event (Murphy and Zimmer-\nFerreira (2007) argue that directors who are appointed from the outside face an infor-\nmational disadvantage compared to those appointed from the inside. This reasoning also\nholds for appointing directors to executive boards. Insiders are already incorporated in\nthe business; they know the strategy in place as well as managers at lower management\nlevels. However, existing management may be responsible for poor performance. Parrino\n(1997) and Huson, Parrino, and Starks (2001) provide evidence that executives are much\nmore likely to be appointed from the outside when the corporation faces financially bad\ntimes. Bornemann, Kick, Pfingsten, and Schertler (2015) argue that external successors\nare more often appointed when the bank needs a clear revision of its strategy. Thus, poor-\nperforming and high-risk banks tend to appoint outsiders more often than other banks in\norder to bring in new talent, increase expertise in the boardroom and clean up the bank.\nThus, appointments of executive directors from the outside and bank performance are\nsimultaneously determined.\nIn such a setting, ordinary least square and fixed-effects regressions may deliver biased\nestimates (Wintoki, Linck, and Netter, 2012). To deal with this endogeneity issue, our\nstudy design contains three elements. First, we consider lagged performance measures\nin our estimations to control for as many unobservable effects as possible and reduce\nperformance persistence by considering every other year only. Consequently, we use an\nestimation method well suited to such a dynamic panel data model: we estimate the\nperformance effects of outside appointments using dynamic panel generalized method of\nmoments (GMM) estimations. This estimation method is well established in the context\nof board structure and performance and has also been employed in a number of recent\nia-Meca,\nGarc\u00b4\nia-S\u00b4\nanchez, and Mart\u00b4\nSecond, we use a large number of bank-specific and macroeconomic variables to con-\ntrol for differences in banks' financial situations, business models, ownership structures,\nand so forth to ensure that the post-appointment effect we measure is not driven by other\ncharacteristics of the banks. More specifically, we include several measures of capital-\nization, measures to capture credit and other risk exposures, as well as off-balance sheet\nitems. GDP growth and the government spread curve are used to control for the macroe-\nconomic environment. All these variables will be introduced in more detail later in the\ndata section. By using such a large number of control variables, we seek to minimize the\nproblem of omitted variables and control for the observation that outsiders are more often\nappointed to high-risk banks than insiders.\nIn addition to the aforementioned two elements, we attempt to deal with a potential\nselection issue of good outsiders. Candidates from high-performing banks and a proven\ntrack record may be unwilling to take job offers from risky banks (Dalton and Kesner,\n1985), while bad outsiders may receive job offers only from high-risk banks. Good out-\nsiders may forgo appointments to boards of high-risk banks because they may fear dam-\nage to their reputation and reduced chances in the job market for executive directors.\nExecutive directors who are fired may incur reputational damage both irrespective of\ntheir management qualities and of whether they were responsible for the poor perfor-\nmance. Jenter and Kanaan (2015) document that corporate boards do not filter out\nexogenous shocks to firm performance before deciding on CEO dismissal. In order to\nascertain whether post-appointment performance effects are driven by selection rather\nthan executives' managerial abilities, we create interaction terms in order to identify the\nperformance effects of good outsiders at high-risk banks, which we then compare with\nthe performance effects of bad outsiders at similarly high-risk banks. Thus, our strategy\nbasically builds on the insight that selection should involve a clear cross-sectional order of\nappointments. For these tests, we interact our key outsider variables with banks' risks in\nthe pre-appointment year and use several risk metrics to build interaction terms in order\nto provide robust findings.\nThe data used in this study is taken from the Deutsche Bundesbank's prudential database,\nBAKIS, which contains information on the financial statements and supervisory reports\nof German banks. We use this database to obtain balance-sheet information for all banks\nbelonging to the German universal banking system between 1993 and 2014. This system\ncomprises three different types of universal banks: private commercial banks, cooperative\nbanks and savings banks. These banking groups differ in terms of ownership structure,\nbusiness models and also regional focus. Savings banks operate not only commercially\nbut, in contrast to commercial and cooperative banks, they also have a public mandate\n(Brunner, Decressin, Hardy, and Kudela, 2004). Cooperative banks are established as\nmutual organizations and serve the interest of their owners. Commercial banks include\nlarge banks that are internationally active and listed on stock exchanges, and smaller\ncommercial banks, which are partnerships, private limited companies or sole proprietors\n(Brunner et al., 2004). We consider all three types of universal banks. BAKIS also con-\ntains information on executive board members which allows us to trace their movements\nfrom one bank board to another.\nTable 1 shows how we build up our sample. Overall we count 3,956 banks, which deliver\nas many as 53,285 bank-years. We exclude observations for which neither balance-sheet\ninformation nor information on the executive board is available for the current or previous\nyear. In our sample period, a large number of merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions\ntook place. The target bank is then integrated and no longer files reports under its\nformer institutional ID. Such an M&A transaction not only increases the acquirer's size,\nbut also influences risk and capitalization as well as returns. We control for these M&A\ntransactions by artificially creating a \"new bank\". The new bank is independent of its pre-\nM&A entities and begins its existence in the M&A year. When applying a dynamic model,\nthis M&A treatment removes appointments to the executive board in the year in which\nthe bank acquires another bank, which ensures that we do not commingle appointments\ndriven by mergers with those that result for any other reason. Our sample contains\nobservations.\nTable 1: Sampling.\nNo. of banks\nbank-years before after\nmerger treatment\nNote: The table shows the number of German universal banks and bank-years for the period 1993\nto 2014. We present all reasons as to why particular banks and bank-years do not enter the sample.\nThe M&A treatment artificially creates a \"new bank\" independent of the pre-M&A entities, which\nbegins operations in the merger year. This M&A treatment increases the number of cross-sections in\nour sample.\n3.2 Appointments from the outside and performance\nWe use board information for two consecutive years to identify new appointees to the\nexecutive board. When at least one new executive director shows up on the board, we\nclassify this as an appointment regardless of whether the total number of board mem-\nbers increases, remains constant or decreases. Table 2 provides the number of banks\nwith appointments to executive boards between 1994 and 2014. The number gradually\ndecreases over time, which is due to the reduced number of banks in Germany, a trend\nthat is related to the consolidation wave in the banking industry. Overall, we count 7,203\nappointments of executive directors including those from inside the bank as well as those\nfrom outside with an employment history at another bank. We call executive directors\nwho have boardroom experience at another bank and no previous employment history in\nthe boardroom of the appointing bank outsiders.3 At the bank level, an outside appoint-\nment occurs when at least one executive director from outside the bank is appointed to\nthe executive board. In contrast, inside appointments are those in which the appointee\nhas no boardroom experience at a German bank.\n3Denis and Denis (1995) and Berger, Kick, Koetter, and Schaeck (2013) also use previous employments\nto distinguish between appointments from the outside and inside.\nTable 2: Number of appointments.\nHistorical ROA Managerial RRE\nYear Appointments Outsider GOOD BAD GOOD BAD\nof which...\nNote: The table reports the number of appointments to German banks' executive boards. Outsider\ndenotes appointments in which at least one executive director with boardroom experience at another\nbank is appointed to the executive board. Historical ROA and managerial RRE denote the ability\nmeasures used to split the group of outside appointments into GOOD and BAD. GOOD (BAD)\nrefers to appointments in which at least one outsider with above-median (below-median) value in the\nability measure is hired.\nFurther, we classify outside appointments as good or bad by using either historical\nROA or managerial RRE. Historical ROA is based on balance-sheet information for the\nexecutives' previous banks. We employ risk-, size- and time-adjusted performance mea-\nsures of the previous bank and proceed as follows: first, we consider risk by using ROA\nrelative to its standard deviation. To control for size effects, we calculate a mean ROA\n\nfor ten deciles (peer group) formed on banks' total assets in each year. Calculating this\nfor each year removes time effects. Afterwards, we subtract the mean of the peer group\nfrom a bank's ROA\n\nto determine how the bank performed relative to its peer group in\nthe same fiscal year. We use up to four fiscal years before the outsider left the previous\nbank to calculate the average of her/his previous bank's adjusted performance. Then, we\nclassify appointments of outsiders as good (bad) if the average historical ROA of their pre-\nvious bank lies in the upper (lower) half of the previous-bank historical ROA distribution.\nOur second measure of managerial ability4 combines two strands of the literature,\nnamely the literature on bank efficiency and managerial ability. Bank efficiency considers\ninput prices, the output mix and provides an overall, objectively determined ranking value\n(Berger and Humphrey, 1997). It is often estimated with stochastic frontier analysis be-\ncause an important drawback of nonparametric frontier approaches like data envelopment\nanalysis, used to investigate firm efficiency (Demerjian et al., 2012), rest on the assump-\ntion of no random errors (Berger and Humphrey, 1997). Thus, the stochastic frontier\nanalysis is better equipped to accommodate noise in the measurement of input, output,\nand price variables (Andreou et al., 2016). Instead of estimating cost efficiency (e.g. De-\nwe estimate risk-return efficiency, hereafter RRE, because Koetter (2008) and Hughes\net al. (1996) argue that efficiency estimates control insufficiently for bank risk and may\nbe misleading especially when risk preferences differ. We follow banking efficiency studies\n2016), and choose the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to estimate the RRE frontier.\nThen, we use the intuition by Demerjian et al. (2012) to parse out managerial ability\nfrom full efficiency. For this, we regress the full bank RRE on various bank-specific char-\nacteristics, such as size and risk, to control for bank-specific efficiency determinants. The\nremaining residual from this regression is our second measure of managerial ability. We\nuse the managerial efficiency information from up to four fiscal years before the outsider\nleft the previous bank to calculate the average managerial RRE and classify outsiders as\ngood (bad) if the average managerial RRE lies in the upper (lower) half of the distribution.\nTable 2 shows that we identify as many as 1,756 bank-years with outside appoint-\nhistorical ROA (managerial RRE). We classify cases as bad outside appointments if both\ntypes of executive directors from the outside are appointed to the same bank board in the\nsame year.5 Our findings, however, do not depend on this classification. Since almost 90%\nof all outside appointments are appointments of one executive director only, we do not\ndiscriminate between cases with one and more executive directors appointed from outside\nin the same year. Our number of appointments is lower than that reported by Berger\net al. (2013) since we exclude executive directors appointed in merger years. Moreover,\nour number of outside appointments is lower than their number because our definition\nof outside appointments rests on identifying the previous bank of the executive director\nin the year directly before s/he is appointed. Thus, an executive director who has not\nserved on an executive board in the previous 10 years but served on an executive board\n11 years ago is classified as an insider in our study.\nWe consider two alternative proxies of bank performance: risk-adjusted return on\nequity (RROE) and risk-adjusted return on assets (RROA). We divide each performance\nmeasure by its standard deviation to obtain risk-adjusted performance measures. In Table\n3, we first present univariate tests on performance effects of good and bad outsiders, which\nwe compare with the performance effects around insider appointments. More specifically,\n4We describe the estimation procedure of managerial RRE in more detail in the Appendix.\n5When using historical ROA (managerial RRE), bad outside appointments include 14 (35) cases\nwhere the information of the executive's previous bank was not available.\nwe present performance measures averaged over various windows, from one year up to\nfive years, both before and after the event occurred. The table delivers two insights.\nFirst, before the event occurs, banks appointing an executive director from the outside\nhave significantly lower performance than those that appoint an insider to the executive\nboard. This holds regardless of whether we study performance in the one- or five-year\nwindow before the appointment. This is in line with the findings in the literature that\noutsiders are more often appointed to clean up banks. Second, differences in risk-adjusted\nperformance between insiders and bad outsiders after the event become less significant for\nhigher windows, indicating that banks appointing bad outsiders are catching up, relatively\nspeaking. For good outsiders and applying the historical ROA as an ability measure, we\neven see a change in the order: before the appointment event, insider banks performed\nbetter, on average, than banks appointing good outsiders, but after the event, the opposite\nholds when we measure performance over more than two years. When using managerial\nRRE as an ability measure, we also find that good outsiders catch up compared to insiders,\nhowever, the effect is less pronounced.\nTable 3: Performance before and after appointments.\nInsider versus\n(mean) (mean) (mean) (t - value)\nHistorical ROA Windows before RROE\nWindows after\nWindows before RROA\nWindows after\nManagerial RRE Windows before RROE\nWindows after\nWindows before RROA\nWindows after\nNote: The table displays mean values of RROE and RROA of banks that\nappoint insiders, and good and bad outsiders. Historical ROA and managerial\nRRE denote the ability measures used to split the group of outsiders. GOOD\n(BAD) refers to appointments in which at least one outsider with above-\nmedian (below-median) value in managerial ability is hired. Windows refers\nto the number of years considered when calculating the mean either before or\nafter the appointment. t - value comes from two-tailed t-tests.\n3.3 Econometric model and control variables\nWe use the following baseline econometric model, from which we derive all subsequent\nspecifications, to determine the effects of executive directors appointed from outside on\nbank performance:\nyi,t\n=  +\n\u00b7 Outsideri,t-j\n+\n\u00b7 Board Controlsi,t\n+\n\u00b7 Bank Controlsi,t-1\n+\n\u00b7 Mergeri,t\n+\n\u00b7 Macrot\n+\n\u00b7 Y eart\n+ \u00b5i\n+ i,t\n.\nwhere yi,t\ndenotes the performance measure of bank i in year t. To account for the high\npersistence in German bank profitability, we follow Wintoki et al. (2012) and only use\nbank-year observations.\nTable 4 delivers descriptive statistics of the performance measures, outsider variables\nand control variables, and a detailed definition of all variables used is given in Table 5.\nWe remove extreme values by winsorizing the performance measures and control variables\nat the 1st and 99th percentiles. We see that the sample mean (median) RROE is 2.04%\npresented in Busch and Kick (2015) for the German banking industry.\n6We also replicate our analysis on data for every year between 1993 and 2014. The results of our\nanalysis remain unchanged, but the outcomes of diagnostic tests become less significant, which may point\nto autocorrelation. These results are available upon request.\nTable 4: Descriptive statistics.\nOutsideri,t\nBADi,t\n Board Sizei,t\nBoard Diversityi,t\nShare Feei,t-1\nAcquireri,w3\nTargeti,w3\nGDP Growtht\nSpreadt\nNote: The table displays descriptive statistics for performance\nmeasures, outsider variables and explanatory variables. mean (sd)\ndenotes the mean (standard deviation) of each variable.

Additionally, we derive lags of this dummy variable to examine the\npost-appointment effects. We use four dummy variables for the post-appointment period\nspanning an overall time period of up to eight years after the outside appointment. Ac-\ncordingly, the dummy variable Outsideri,t-j\nequals 1 if the bank appoints an outsider in\nthe past t-j whereas each time step, j = 1, 2, 3 or 4, contains two years since we sample\nevery second year. Each lagged outsider dummy variable equals 1 in two years instead\nof one year to capture post-appointment performance effects of outsiders in the sampled\nand omitted years.\nBoard Controlsi,t\ncontains two variables to control for elements of corporate gover-\nnance. We follow recent literature of corporate governance (Berger, Kick, and Schaeck,\nia-Meca et al., 2015; Delis, Gaganis, Hasan, and Pasiouras,\n2016) and measure the diversity of banks' executive board structure with Board Diversity\n(ln), which was introduced by Anderson, Reeb, Upadhyay, and Zhao (2011) and imple-\nmented for German banks by Berger et al. (2013). Our board diversity considers the\nbanks' board dimensions in age, gender, education (measured by academic degrees), and\njob experience (computed by tenure). To yield this index, we first calculate coefficient of\nvariation (which equals the ratio of the standard deviation divided by the mean) for each\nof the four dimensions. For each of the four dimensions, we assign a value of 1 (2, 3, 4) if\nthe bank's value falls into the 1st (2nd, 3rd, 4th) quartile of the distribution. Finally, the\nindex of board diversity results from summing up the four different dimensions. We take\nthe natural log since the index is skewed. Our second board control measure is the change\nin board size from the previous to the current year with the variable  Board Size.7\nBank Controlsi,t-1\ncomprises the first lag of all bank-specific continuous and discrete\ncontrol variables. We justify the use of a large number of bank controls in light of en-\ndogeneity concerns. We use the capital adequacy ratio, CAR, to control for a bank's\nfinancial leverage measured in terms of regulatory equity. A higher CAR is likely to indi-\ncate a healthier bank. The sample mean (median) CAR is 10.59% (8.88%). We further\ninclude a dummy variable, DISSw3\n, to control for banks which receive capital injections,\nor are subject to severe regulatory interventions (i.e. moratorium) or exit the market\nin a distressed merger. We include fee income to total income, Share Fee. The mean\n(median) Share Fee in our sample equals 11.77% (10.85%) and higher than those for\nsavings banks in Bornemann et al. (2015) since our sample considers private commercial\nbanks, which are more active in fee business than savings and cooperative banks. We also\ninclude the ratio of off-balance sheet items to total assets, OBS, for two reasons. One is\nthat banks might use off-balance sheet items to reduce their risks. Another is that off-\nbalance sheet items themselves may include risky investment assets, which may decrease\nperformance when they materialize, in many cases at the same time (Kick and Prieto,\ncustomer loans to total assets, CL, because loans represent a main source of income for\nGerman banks (Memmel and Schertler, 2012). The sample mean (median) CL is 57.86%\n(59.82%). We use the ratio of non-performing loans to total assets, NPL, to proxy the\nquality of credit exposure (Meeker and Gray, 1987). The sample mean (median) NPL\na Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, HHI, for concentration in the loan portfolio, calculated\nwith 8 sectors and log-transformed because it is skewed. A high HHI indicates a more\nconcentrated loan portfolio and thus higher credit risk. The sample mean (median) HHI\nSize effects are controlled for using bank size, measured by the natural logarithm of to-\ntal assets (deflated), TA. This accounts for the fact that larger banks have more complex\nbusiness structures and networks, invest more resources in high-quality risk management,\nwork with a wider range of customers and can therefore better diversify their income struc-\nture than small banks. The sample mean (median) TA (ln) is 19.56 (19.47). Ownership\nstructures are controlled for using pillar dummy variables. The majority of banks in our\nsample are cooperative banks (70%) followed by savings banks (24%), private commer-\ncial banks (6%) and the very large commercial banks and head institutes of cooperative\nand savings banks (1%). We include the dummies D COOP, D PRIV and D BIG to\n7We only include board size as an additional explanatory variable in robustness tests (see Section 4.4)\nbecause it is highly correlated with bank size.\naccount for the bank pillar of cooperative and private commercial banks and for the very\nlarge institutes and omit the dummy for savings banks to avoid perfect collinearity.\nThe process of incorporating target banks may induce structural changes not only in\nthe year of the M&A transaction; it may, in fact, take much more than a year to integrate\nentities. Especially in savings and cooperative banks, M&A transactions are mostly con-\nducted with a strong eye on social comparability for the employees. This might be more\ncost-intensive and extend the time needed for integration. In most cases, the transaction\nis prepared in the pre-merger year and affects the financial situation of the acquirer in the\npost-merger years. In addition to our aforementioned treatment of M&A transactions, we\ninclude Mergeri,t\nwhich comprises two dummy variables. The dummy variable Targeti,w3\nequals 1 if the bank is the target of an M&A transaction in the current or following year,\nzero otherwise. We set the dummy equal to 1 in two years instead of one year because\nmost target banks no longer report data in the merger year. For the post-merger period\nof the acquirer bank, we use a dummy variable Acquireri,w3\nthat equals 1 in the first two\nyears after completion of the M&A transaction. Setting this dummy variable equal to 1\nonly in the post-merger year would remove it from the dynamic panel estimations.\nFinally, Macro Controlst\ncomprises GDP Growth and Spread (interest rate spread\nbetween 10-year and 1-year government bonds) with which we control for the macroeco-\nnomic environment. Y eart\nrefers to year dummy variables to control for remaining time\neffects. \u00b5i\nis a fixed effect for bank i, and i,t\ndenotes the remaining disturbance term.\nIn order to ensure that our specifications do not suffer from multicollinearity, we\npresent pair-wise correlation coefficients between performance measures and explanatory\nvariables in Table 6. Since the correlation coefficients between the explanatory variables\nare not higher than 0.30 (the highest value between TA and HHI and DISSw3\nand NPL\nis 0.30 and the next peak between CAR and Share Fee is 0.28), multicollinearity is not\na problem in our regression specifications.\nTable 6: Correlations.\nContinued from above\nNote: The table displays correlation coefficients between performance measures, outsider variables and explanatory\nvariables. All variables are defined in Table 5. * indicates the correlation coefficient is significant at the 1% level.\nTo further control for omitted variables and banks' past performance, we consider\na lag of the dependent variable in our model. Therefore, we estimate Eq. (1) by using\na dynamic panel estimator, which is a GMM estimator, with a finite sample correction\ndeveloped by Windmeijer (2005). An important aspect of this estimator is the use of\nhistorical values as instruments for current changes. For these instruments to be valid,\nthey must fulfill two criteria: the historical information must provide a source of variation\nfor current values, and the instruments must be uncorrelated with the error in the per-\nformance equation. This implies that there must be no additional information contained\nin the econometric model, which remains unexplained and correlates with the instruments.\nWe use two two-year sampled lags of the dependent variable as instruments. Since our\nregression sample includes every second year, we include the information from up to six\nyears before the outsider is appointed in our instruments. As suggested by Wintoki et al.\n(2012), two lags can be sufficient to capture the dynamic dimension between performance\nand board measures. Accordingly, we expect information from the previous six years to be\nsufficient. We check the reliability of GMM estimation results by performing two tests: the\nHansen test of instrument validity and the Arellano and Bond (1991) test of serially un-\ncorrelated error terms. The diagnostic tests of our various specifications show insignificant\ntest statistics for Hansen J-statistics of over-identifying restrictions, indicating that the in-\nstruments are valid. By way of construction, the specifications document a significant first-\norder autocorrelation (AR(1)); second-order autocorrelation (AR(2)) is absent, however.\n4 Empirical results\n4.1 Pre- and post-appointment bank performance\nIn Table 7, we present regression results from running Eq. (1) for our dependent variables\nRROE (Columns (1)-(5)) and RROA (Column (6)). The negative and significant coef-\nficient on Outsideri,t\nin Column (1) reveals that bank performance is significantly lower\nwhen executive directors with boardroom experience at other banks are appointed. More-\nover, lower performance of appointing banks is persistent as we find significant effects in\npost-appointment years. The negative and significant coefficient on Outsideri,t-1\nreveals\nthat banks with incoming outside executives perform significantly worse in the first and\nsecond years after appointing outsiders than banks without appointment events. Even af-\nter three and five years, as captured by the coefficients on Outsideri,t-2\nand Outsideri,t-3\n,\na bank with an outside appointment underperforms other banks. Only after seven years\ndo we no longer observe a significant performance differential between bank-years with\nand without outside appointments. We regard these negative performance effects as being\nin line with the findings of Schaeck et al. (2012), who document that executive turnovers\nat US banks correlate with lower profitability and greater losses over a post-turnover\nperiod of three years.\nTable 7: Pre- and post-appointment bank performance.\nContinued on next page\nContinued from previous page\nNote: Coefficients from dynamic panel estimations with Windmeijer (2005) corrected standard\nerrors below the coefficients. In Columns (1)-(5), the dependent variable is RROE, and in Column\n(6) it is RROA. In Column (1), we present the results of our baseline model given in Eq. (1)\nOutsideri,t-j\nwith j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. In Columns (2) and (4)-(6), we replace outsider variables with\ndummy variables for good and bad outsiders split up according to historical ROA. In Column (3),\nwe report the results for good and bad outsiders split up according to their managerial RRE.\nIn Columns (2)-(6) we add GOODt+1\nand BADt+1\nto control for the pre-appointment year.\nColumn (4) shows the results for savings banks and Column (5) for private banks. Variables are\nlisted in Table 5. Year dummies are included, but not reported. JPE (joint performance effect)\ndepicts the sum of all coefficients belonging to a particular outsider type. *, ** and *** indicate\nsignificance of the coefficients at the 10%, 5% and 1% level.\nNext, we test whether this initial insight holds for all outsiders. In Columns (2) and (3)\nof Table 7 we display results where all outsider variables are replaced by ten dummy vari-\nables: five variables for each outsider type, maintaining the lagged variables to tackle\npost-appointment effects. Column (2) is based on historical ROA, and Column (3) uses\nmanagerial RRE as an ability measure. The coefficient on BADi,t\nreveals that banks that\nappoint bad outsiders perform significantly more poorly in appointment years, whereas\nthe coefficient on GOODi,t\nis also negative but is only half the size of the bad coefficient.\nRROE of banks with bad outsiders is 0.301 lower (Column (2)), which is large in economic\nterms since it accounts for more than 21% of the RROE's standard deviation. Further-\nmore, coefficients on bad outsiders in the post-appointment period are significant whereas\nthe higher order lagged coefficients on good outsiders are insignificant. In unreported\ntests, we find an insignificant performance differential for the fourth lag of good and bad\noutside appointments, while all others are significant. Thus, only after seven years fol-\nlowing the appointment do banks appointing good outsiders no longer differ from those\nappointing bad outsiders. These findings hold regardless of the ability measure we employ.\nWe also calculate joint performance effects by summing up all coefficients of good and\nbad outsider dummy variables to determine how much lower the performance is overall\nfor banks appointing good and bad outsiders. For historical ROA (Column (2)), the\njoint performance effect of bad outsiders is -0.837 and is highly significant, while the joint\nperformance effect of good outsiders, which is -0.25, lacks significance. We test the null\nthat the joint effects of good and bad outsiders are equal and obtain significant F-values\nfor historical ROA (Column (2)) and managerial RRE (Column (3)), indicating that the\nperformance path of banks hiring good outsiders differs significantly from that of banks\nappointing bad outsiders.\nWe additionally include variables that indicate the pre-appointment year of good and\nbad outsiders to figure out whether the risk-adjusted performance differs before the ap-\npointment. GOODi,t+1\n) is a dummy variable which equals 1 in the year before\na bank appoints a good (bad) outsider. Thus, following the approach of Kaplan and\nMinton (1994), we extend the investigation to the pre-appointment year. Doing so means\nthat we control for an event that takes place in the future, which can be regarded as\neconometrically questionable. Therefore, the following findings should not be overstated.\nWe see that bad outside appointments based on historical ROA and managerial RRE\nare significantly worse in the pre-appointment year than in non-appointment years. This\nnegative effect of bad outsiders is in line with the finding in the literature that external suc-\ncessions are often preceded by poor accounting performance (e.g. Denis and Denis, 1995)\nand that external successors are expected to clean up banks (Bornemann et al., 2015).\nWe test the null that the coefficients on good and bad outsiders in the pre-appointment\nyear are equal and find insignificant F-values for both ability measures. Following from\nthis, we can conclude that the performance of banks appointing good outsiders does not\ndiffer from the one of banks appointing bad outsiders in the pre-appointment year.\nWe present results for the subsamples of savings banks in Column (4), and for private\nbanks in Column (5). Since our sample contains less than 140 private commercial banks\nwith no more than 70 outside appointments, we combine them with cooperative banks\nto the group of private banks as they have a similar ownership structure. From the sub-\nsample of private banks, we exclude the few very large commercial banks, and the head\ninstitutions of cooperative banks, since they differ too greatly in size, business models\nand governance for us to analyze their performance together with the huge number of\nsmall and medium-sized banks. Regarding our key variables of interest, we find that the\ncoefficients on bad outsiders are negative and significant while those for good outsiders are\nmuch lower. The subsample analysis highlights the fact that outsider effects differ some-\nwhat across savings and private banks. The negative performance effect of bad outsiders\nin the post-appointment years is somewhat stronger for private banks than for savings\nbanks. The joint performance effect of bad outsiders for savings banks is -0.673, while\nthat for private banks is even higher, at -0.943. We conclude that performance effects of\nappointing an outsider in savings and private banks have the same tendency, but joint\nperformance effects of good and bad outside appointments do not significantly differ in\nprivate banks.\nIn Column (6), we use RROA as the dependent variable and see that it leads to similar\nconclusions to our baseline in Column (2). The estimated joint performance effect for bad\noutsiders for RROA is somewhat higher than the one we find for RROE. The economic\neffects of bad outsiders are, however, very close to each other since the standard devia-\ntion of RROA is higher than that of RROE. Thus, it matters little which risk-adjusted\nperformance measure we use. We do not present subsample results for RROA, nor results\non our alternative ability measure because they resemble the results of RROE.\nSome control variables are also significantly and consistently related to risk-adjusted\nperformance measures. The change in board size,  Board Sizei,t\n, is significantly negative\nindicating lower performance when banks are in the process of extending their board.8\nThe negative and significant coefficient on HHI indicates that a more concentrated loan\nportfolio is associated with worse performance. The coefficient on bank size identifies\na positive relationship between a bank's total assets and performance. This is in line\nwith the argument that larger banks are more diversified (Chiorazzo, Milani, and Salvini,\n2008). Also the negative and significant coefficient on DISSw3\n, which indicates a bank\nbeing in distress, is in line with the findings of the other risk measures. The effect of\nM&A transactions has more to do with the pre-merger year of the targets than with\nthe acquiring banks. The effects of other bank-specific variables on performance depend\non the specification and sample chosen. For instance, higher off-balance-sheet items,\nOBS, are associated with poorer performance of private banks. Thus, an increase in such\nitems decreases bank performance. An increase in the volume of non-performing loans,\nNPL, which accompanies a lower credit quality (Meeker and Gray, 1987), is associated\nwith poorer performance of private banks. A higher CAR is associated with improved\nperformance for savings banks only, and an increase in Share Fee leads to better risk-\nadjusted performance but only when measured by RROE in the full sample. The positive\nand significant coefficients on GDP Growth and Spread suggest that bank performance\nincreases pro-cyclically and with a positive yield curve for both savings and private banks.\n8This variable also captures part of the effect stemming from inside appointments, which we investi-\ngate further in Section 4.4.\n4.2 Outsider and pre-appointment bank risk\nOur findings may indicate that good outsiders outperform bad outsiders. However, an\nalternative explanation for the performance differential between banks appointing good\nand bad outsiders may be that good outsiders select banks with lower risk, while bad out-\nsiders are more likely to be hired by banks in very bad financial shape. Thus, the outside\nappointment dummy variable may simply pick up where this effect left off. Although we\nhave already controlled for a large number of risk-related variables, this might be insuf-\nficient when these risk measures also determine which outsider accepts which job offer.\nOur next step, therefore, is to take into account risk differences between the banks before\nthe outsider is appointed to trace possible selection effects by distinguishing between low-\nand high-risk banks appointing good and bad outsiders.\nOur workhorse in this part of the analysis is a probability of bank distress (PD) of the\nbanks in our sample. This PD comes from an econometric model, which is explained in\ndetail in the Appendix, that considers balance-sheet as well as regulatory data on banks'\ncapitalization, funding, lending and investment behavior. We use this as a workhorse,\nsince it combines the different dimensions of bank risk into a single number for each bank\nand year. As alternative risk measures, we use the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of the loan\nportfolio (HHI, ln), and non-performing loans (NPL). However these measures consider\nrisk-bearing parts of balance-sheet composition and not a bank's risk exposure overall. A\nhigher PD, HHI and NPL indicate higher risk.\nIn Table 8, we list descriptive statistics of the three proxies of bank risk for the full\nsample, and for the sample of good and bad outside appointments in the pre-appointment\nyear. The numbers support the view that banks with outside appointments are riskier\nthan banks without these appointments, which is in line with the argument that executive\ndirectors from the outside are more often appointed to clean up. Moreover, the displayed\ncross-section variations of PD, HHI and NPL, and in the pre-appointment year indicate\nthat banks with bad outside appointments are more risky than those which appoint good\noutsiders. According to t-tests, the differences in risk are significant especially when we\nuse historical ROA as an ability measure. This supports the selection argument for good\nand bad outsiders: good outsiders, on average, are hired by less risky banks than bad\noutsiders.\nTable 8: Pre-appointment bank risk.\nHistorical ROA Managerial RRE\nFull sample Outsider GOOD BAD GOOD BAD\nNote: The table displays mean, median (p50) and standard deviation (sd) of three prox-\nies of bank risk for the full sample and subsamples of all, good and bad outsiders from\ntheir respective pre-appointment years. We use banks' probability of bank distress (PD), a\nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI, ln) that measures the concentration of the loan portfolio\nand the ratio of non-performing loans to total assets (NPL). t-value comes from two-tailed\nt-tests between good and bad outside appointments.\nTo test whether this selection accounts for performance differentials, we split the\ndummy variables of good and bad outsiders into two parts according to the bank risk\nin the year before the executive director is appointed. We build the PD interaction\nterm on the 90th percentile of the full sample distribution. This ensures that the group of\nhigh-risk banks includes those that are relatively close to financial distress; an alternative,\nsplitting at the median PD, delivers too few observations for bad outsiders in low-risk\nbanks. In Table 9, Panel A, we present the results for RROE with these PD interaction\nterms for good and bad outsiders. To save space, we only report joint performance effects.\nResults on our control variables and diagnostic tests are similar to those presented earlier\n(for all tables to come, we present the full version in the Appendix of this paper). For\nhigh-default banks, we find that good outside appointments significantly outperform bad\noutside appointments, but less so for low-default banks. Thus, especially in banks needing\nthe turnaround the most, good outsiders do a better job than bad outsiders.\nTo see whether this conclusion also holds for other risk measures, we employ HHI\nand NPL, and use the median of the aforementioned risk proxies of the full sample which\ndelivers a sufficient number of cases in each group. For banks with a high concentration\nin HHI or a high ratio of NPL in their loan portfolios, our two measures of ability point\ntoward the same conclusion as for the overall bank risk measure: good outsiders help the\nmost in turning around bad bank performance.\nTable 9: Outsider and pre-appointment bank risk.\nHistorical ROA Managerial RRE\nHigh PDi,t-1\nLow PDi,t-1\nHigh HHIi,t-1\nLow HHIi,t-1\nHigh NPLi,t-1\nLow NPLi,t-1\nNote: This table reports results from 18 GMM estimations with Windmeijer (2005) cor-\nrected standard errors.

Thus, we have an eye on\nwhether the years of the financial crisis changed the performance channel of appointing\ngood and bad executive directors from the outside. To determine whether the financial\ncrisis has implications, we measure the performance effect for good and bad outside ap-\n9Subsampling the data is not appropriate in a dynamic model with two-year sampling.\njoint performance effects of good and bad outside appointments using historical ROA\n(Columns (1)-(3)), and managerial RRE (Columns (4)-(6)). For the full sample (Columns\n(1) and (4)), we find that banks with bad outside appointments underperform those with\ngood outside appointments both in the pre-crisis and post-crisis period. The statistical\nsignificance is, however, always higher in the post-crisis period than in the pre-crisis pe-\nriod, but we do not find any significant differences between bad outside appointments\nbefore and after the crisis in the full sample.\nTable 10: Outsider in the pre- and post-crisis period.\nHistorical ROA Managerial RRE\nPre-crisis period\nPost-crisis period\nNote: This table reports results from 6 GMM estimations with Windmeijer (2005) corrected\nstandard errors. The dependent variable is RROE. Joint performance effects (JPE) of\nvarious outside appointments separately measured for the pre- and post-crisis period are\ndepicted. The pre-crisis period contains the years 1993-2006 and the post-crisis period the\nROA and in Columns (4)-(6) according to managerial RRE. Columns (1) and (4) represent\nthe full sample. Columns (2) and (5) show the results for savings banks and Columns (3) and\n(6) for private banks. All bank-specific, macro and year dummy variables listed in Eq. (1)\nare included, but not reported. *, ** and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1%.\nInteresting are the findings for private banks, as the separation in a pre-crisis and\npost-crisis period delivers new insights. Results in Table 7 seem to indicate that private\nbanks have a similar pattern of appointment effects than savings banks in the sense that\nthe joint performance effect of bad outsiders is more negative than that of good outsiders.\nHowever, we could not establish a significant difference of joint performance effects be-\ntween good and bad outside appointments of private banks. Splitting the appointment\neffect in a pre-crisis and post-crisis period indicates that private banks have the same ten-\ndency in the post-crisis period but not in the pre-crisis period. This tendency stems from\na change in the performance effects of good outside appointments. In the pre-crisis period,\nthe performance effect of good outside appointments is significantly negative, which is not\nthe case in the post-crisis period. According to an F-test, the performance effect of good\noutside appointments differs significantly between the pre- and post-crisis period, regard-\nless of the managerial ability measure used to classify good and bad outside appointments.\nWith respect to our results on the pre- and post-crisis period, a note of caution is in\norder. While we label the period from 2007 to 2014 as the post-crisis period, the split may\nnot capture effects stemming from the financial crisis as in other studies that primarily\ncapture US banks (e.g. Fahlenbrach and Stulz, 2011; Berger et al., 2016). The reason for\nthis is that the majority of banks in our sample are small and medium-sized banks with\nalmost no exposure to US subprime products. Therefore, these small and medium-sized\nbanks were not hit directly by the value drop in subprime mortgages, but most likely\nby the Euro crisis and monetary policy. Moreover, German banks are faced with higher\nregulatory requirements, which partly stem from the crisis. Thus, the post-crisis effect\nwe measure for outside appointments captures all these influences at the same time.\n4.4 Complementary results\nIn this section we present a number of robustness tests and extensions (detailed results\nare tabulated in the Appendix). First, we use difference-in-differences estimations to\ncheck whether our results are robust to an alternative approach, which has been used\nin many recent studies on manager and director appointments (e.g. Berger et al., 2014;\nMin, 2013). The treatment group are banks with newly appointed outsiders in which no\nfurther turnover, merger or distress event occurred in the three years surrounding the\nappointment year. The control group consists of banks without any turnover, merger\nor distress events in the preceding and following two years. For each bank in the treat-\nment group we match control banks with replacement from the same year and banking\ngroup, and from the same size and ROA deciles in the year before the treatment bank\nappoints the outsider. Results from this alternative approach confirm our findings. More\nspecifically, we find that banks with bad outside appointments significantly underperform\ncontrol banks, while banks with good outside appointments do not. We use this ap-\nproach as a robustness test rather than our main approach for the following reasons: first,\nfor many of the treatment banks, we are not able to find an appropriate match partner\nin terms of pre-event size and ROA, so the number of banks considered is much lower,\nwhich may raise concerns of sample selection. Second, with the difference-in-differences\napproach we cannot control for the fact that several appointments to the same executive\nboard occur in adjoining years. Also, difference-in-differences estimations require that\nthe event is exogenous. However, for outside appointments it can hardly be argued that\nthese events are exogenous since the risk-profile of banks may determine their outside ap-\npointment behavior. A natural exception to this rule is the unexpected death of a director.\nOur second set of robustness tests deals with the structure of the executive board.\nFirst, we find that our results hold when we exclude the board diversity index and the\nchange in board size. Second, we test whether adding inside appointments, i.e., execu-\ntive directors who have not accumulated any boardroom experience outside their current\nbank, has an effect. Consequently, we add variables of insider appointments to the list of\nvariables in Eq. (1). We find that appointments of insiders are associated with a negative\njoint performance effect, which is significantly weaker than the joint performance effect\nof bad outsiders in Column (2) of Table 7. Third, we consider the size of the executive\nboard, which has a significant negative effect on risk-adjusted performance. Fourth, we\nadd the boards' average age and experience, however neither are significantly related to\nthe bank performance. Fifth, we add the average tenure of bank executive directors,\nwhich turns out to be significantly positively related to the performance indicating that\neither directors with longer tenure generate more value or that executive directors stay\nlonger at banks with high performance. It is important for our conclusion that excluding\nor including these additional board characteristics does not change the post-appointment\neffects we find for good and bad outsiders.10\nFinally, we examine whether potential causes of the appointment event are related to\nperformance differentials. We distinguish three groups of appointments. The first group\ncontains turnover events triggered by the retirement of an executive director. We clas-\nsify an appointment as triggered by retirement when an incumbent executive director is\nolder than 60 years and when s/he stops serving on this board in the appointment or\nsecond group contains cases where outsiders are appointed to replace an incumbent execu-\ntive director who is not retiring. Consequently, these turnover events are triggered by any\nother reason, such as a resignation or dismissal. The third group consists of appointments\nwhere the board size increases. These three types may differ substantially because retire-\nment turnovers are a relatively orderly process (Khurana and Nohria, 2000) where the\nincumbent executive director might be involved in selecting her/his successors, which is\neven more likely when the CEO retires (Shivdasani and Yermack, 1999). Non-retirement\nturnovers are potentially less orderly and might be more disruptive events (Khurana and\nNohria, 2000), such as the (in)voluntary resignation of an incumbent executive. Thus,\nthese events might be characterized by a shortage of time to adequately structure the\nprocess. Appointments when the board size increases enhance the body of expertise in\nthe boardroom since all other members will continue serve on the board.\nTable 11 delivers information on the total number of outside appointments as well\nas the numbers of good and bad outside appointments based on the two ability mea-\nsures on the one hand, and of retirement, non-retirement turnover and board-increase\nappointments, on the other. In our sample, relatively few outside appointments are asso-\nciated with a replacement of incumbent executives who are not retiring. In only 15.72%\nof all outside appointments does an outsider replaces an executive director who is not\nretiring. We have no evidence that good outside appointments are more likely to be cho-\nsen during retirement turnovers, while bad outsiders are hired to serve on boards after\nnon-retirement turnovers, or vice versa. As shown for historical ROA, 44.57% of all non-\nretirement turnovers and 49.84% of all retirement turnovers are associated with hiring a\ngood outsider. Thus, good and bad outside appointments and replacement (retirement\nand non-retirement) and appointments with board increase seem to be fairly independent\nof one another.\n10One other robustness test might be worth mentioning. As the German banking sector is characterized\nby conglomerate structures, we run a model excluding all banks that belong to a concern and we find our\nconclusion confirmed.\n11Our classification differs from other studies such as Denis and Denis (1995) and Jenter and Kanaan\n(2015) where the retirement age is 64 years. We opted to use 60 years as the retirement age to have\na sufficient number of cases in the retirement group. Using a higher retirement age, however, does not\nchange our findings.\nTable 11: Appointment triggers.\nNon-retirement\nAbility measure Retirement turnover Board increase Total\nHistorical ROA\nManagerial RRE\nNote: The table relates GOOD and BAD outside appointments to retirement (i.e. when at\nleast one incumbent executive director is older than 60 years and when s/he stops serving on\nthis board in the appointment or pre-appointment year), non-retirement turnover and board\nincrease (i.e. the number of executive directors increases and no director leaves the board).\nGOOD (BAD) refers to appointments when at least one outsider is hired with above-median\n(below-median) historical ROA or managerial RRE. Column refers to the observations in\neach cell of the table as a percentage of the number of observations in the respective column.\nRow shows the total observations in each column as a percentage of the total number of\nappointments.\nTo see whether the potential triggers of the appointment events involve performance\ndifferentials between good and bad outside appointments, we run models with interaction\nterms of the trigger. In Table 12 we present the results for RROE with our previously\nused dummy variables for good and bad outsiders and the 3 different appointment trig-\ngers. Again, to save space we report only joint performance effects. The results confirm\nour findings from the full sample in Table 7: the joint performance effect for bad outsiders\nis significantly negative for retirement turnovers and appointments with board increase.\nThus, even in the case of a board increase when the outsider dummy variables capture\nthe infusion of additional expertise into the boardroom, we find negative performance\neffects of bad outsiders. Bad outsiders in non-retirement turnovers do not show signif-\nicantly negative performance effects; rather for savings banks we even find a positive\npost-appointment performance effect of good outsiders. This may indicate that in the\ncase of non-retirement turnovers, good outsiders are better equipped to turn around bad\nbank performance. However, the information we have available to classify appointments\ninto different types is limited. For instance, the percentage of forced turnovers (where\nthe former executive director was fired because of poor bank performance) in our cate-\ngory of non-retirement turnovers may significantly differ between good and bad outside\nappointments. We leave this open for future research.\nTable 12: Outsider and appointment triggers.\nHistorical ROA Managerial RRE\nRetirement\nNon-retirement turnover\nBoard increase\nNote: This table reports results from 6 GMM estimations with Windmeijer (2005) corrected\nstandard errors. The dependent variable is RROE. Joint performance effects (JPE) of\nvarious outside appointments interacted with various appointment triggers are depicted. We\nclassify outside appointments as retirement, non-retirement turnover and board increase.\nRetirement is when at least one incumbent executive director is older than 60 years and\nwhen s/he stops serving on this board in the appointment or pre-appointment year. Board\nincrease means the size of the board increases and no executive director leaves the board.\nIn Columns (1)-(3), we split up the group of outsiders according to historical ROA and\nin Columns (4)-(6) according to managerial RRE. Columns (1) and (4) represent the full\nsample. Columns (2) and (5) show the results for savings banks and Columns (3) and (6)\nfor private banks. All bank-specific, macro and year dummy variables listed in Eq. (1) are\nincluded, but not reported. *, ** and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level.\n5 Concluding remarks\nThe aim of this paper was to test whether executive directors appointed from outside\nthe bank are a homogeneous group of executive directors concerning post-appointment\nperformance effects or whether some outsiders are better predisposed than others to turn\naround poor bank performance and can do it more quickly than others. We use two\nmeasures of ability, the historical return on assets and managerial risk-return efficiency,\nto distinguish between what we call good and bad outside appointments. For a sample\nof German banks from 1993 to 2014, we find performance differentials after appointing\ngood and bad outsiders. Appointing outsiders with low ability creates lower performance\nthan appointing outsiders with high ability. This is in line with the reasoning that some\nexecutives are better than others at turning around bank performance. We put forth an\nalternative explanation that might also create the patterns in the data we attribute to the\nmanagerial ability of executives appointed from the outside. The performance differential\nbetween good and bad outsiders could be driven by a positive selection on the part of\ngood outsiders. All outsiders may want to maintain their individual reputation in the job\nmarket for bank executive directors. However, while good outsiders may decline offers\nfrom high-risk banks, bad outsiders may only receive offers from high-risk banks. We find\nthat the pattern in performance differentials is not driven by selection via bank risk.\nWe further test whether the performance differential between good and bad outside\nappointments differs in the pre- and post-crisis period. Our results indicate that the\nperformance differentials become more pronounced in the post-crisis period, especially\nbecause good outsiders do a much better job after than before the crisis. We find that\nbanks appointing bad outsiders perform in the post-crisis period as poorly as before\nthe crisis. As many of the banks in our sample did not have subprime exposure, the\ninterpretation of the post-crisis effects we measure differs from post-crisis effects measured\nin studies using US data. In our study, the post-crisis effects combine the effects of the\nEuro crisis, monetary policy changes, and changes in regulatory requirements in response\nto the crisis.\nA Appendix\nA.1 Managerial RRE\nManagerial RRE is our second measure of managerial ability and is based on banks' ef-\nficiency. Many studies have used cost efficiency (Demerjian et al., 2012; Francis et al.,\n2016) or profit efficiency (Andreou et al., 2016) to obtain information on managerial abil-\nity. However, an important drawback of using them for banks is that risk is not sufficiently\ncontrolled for (Koetter, 2008). Consequently, those efficiency estimates might be mislead-\ning. To get rid of this drawback in our measure of managerial ability, we follow Koetter\n(2008), who estimates risk-return efficiency (RRE) for German universal banks following\nHughes and Moon (1995) and Hughes et al. (1996). They start with a utility-maximization\nsetting based on an Almost Ideal Demand (AID) system consisting of profit and input\nshare equations. The idea is that a focus on profit maximization or cost minimization is\ninsufficient since bank managers may have different risk preferences and pursue alterna-\ntive objectives (Koetter, 2008). For a detailed description of this structural model of bank\nLang, Mester, and Moon (2000) and Deaton and Muellbauer (1980). Our estimation pro-\ncedure, for which we introduce and summarize all variables in Table 13, starts with such a\nstructural model of bank input and output equations (which is a 4-equation system as in\nKoetter (2008) and Hughes et al. (1996)), which we estimate with a seemingly unrelated\nregression equations (SURE) estimation and allow for heteroscedasticity.\nTable 13: Variables in the three step estimation procedure.\nFirst step: SURE estimation\n~\nSecond step: SFA\nD BIGi Large commercial banks and head in-\nstitutions of cooperative and savings\nbanks\nThird step: Tobit regression\nNotes: The table displays descriptive statistics for the variables used to estimate managerial RRE.\nmean (sd) denotes the mean (standard deviation) of each variable. The value px indicates the xth\npercentile of the distribution of the respective variable. The number of bank-year observations is\n50,123 and the number of banks is 3,567. * denotes values in millions of Euros; ** in percent and ***\nin thousands of Euros.\nOne of the 4 equations of the structural model delivers the input for the second step\nof our estimation procedure. We present this equation below:\n ln E\n ln wi\n=\np\n\np  y + m\n=\n ln P\n ln p\n+ \u00b5 [ln(p  y + m) - ln P]\n= \n+ \nln p\n+ p\nln ~\np +\nj\nj\nln yj\n+\ns\ns\nln ws\n+  z\nln z + \u00b5 [ln(p  y + m) - ln P] + p\nwhere\n+ p\nln ~\np +\ni\ni\nln yi\n+\nj\nj\nln wj\n+ \nln p\n+  ln z +\npp\n(ln ~\n+\ni j\nij\nln yi\nln yj\n+\ns t\n\nst\nln ws\nln wt\n+\n\n(ln p\nzz\nj\npj\nln ~\np ln yj\n+\ns\nps\nln ~\np ln ws\n+ p\nln ~\np ln p\n+ pz\nln ~\np ln z\n+\nj s\njs\nln yj\nln ws\n+\nj\nj\nln yj\nln p\n+\nj\njz\nln yj\nln z +\ns\n\ns\nln ws\nln p\n+\ns\nsz\nln ws\nln z + z\nln p\nln z.\nThis equation delivers the expected return and predicted risk, which are the key vari-\nables in the risk-return efficiency estimation. The expected return, ER, is the predicted\nprofit divided by equity, z, ER = E(p\n/z). The predicted risk, RK, is the standard error\nof the predicted profit, RK = S(E(p\n/z). Thus, both measures, which are bank specific,\ndepend on the bank's production plan and other explanatory variables of the bank. If the\nrisk preferences of bank managers differ, the expected risk-return relationship may also\nvary across banks. Following Koetter (2008), the curve of risk-return optimums slopes\nupward since risk is positively related to return, albeit with a decreasing rate. Therefore,\nthe RRE is estimated as an upper envelope of expected return of the following form:\nERi,t\n= i\n\u00b7 RKi,t\ni,t\n+ Bank Sectorsi\n+ i,t\nAfter imposing the necessary homogeneity and symmetry restrictions, we estimate\nEquation (4) using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). The banking structure in Germany,\nwith its large number of small and medium-sized cooperative and savings banks, requires\ncontrolling for heterogeneity in efficiency analysis (e.g. Koetter and Wedow, 2010). There-\nfore, we control for systematic differences across the bank sectors by adding dummies to\nthe deterministic kernel of the frontier. The results of this estimation are presented in\nBanks' total deviation from the best practice risk-return frontier, i,t\n, is due to random\nnoise, vi,t\n, which is assumed to be i.i.d. with vi,t\nv\n) and inefficiency, ui,t\n, which is\n12This is the second specification from Koetter (2008).

A point estimator of efficiency is\ngiven by E(ui,t\n| i,t\n), i.e., the mean of ui\ngiven i\n[exp(-ui,t\n)] to calculate RRE per bank and year. RRE of 1 implies a fully efficient bank;\na RRE of around 0.87 implies that the bank has realized only 87% of potential returns at\ngiven production plan and risks.\nVariables\nRKi,t\ni,t\nBank sector dummies YES\nYear effects YES\nu\nv\nNote: The table displays the coefficients\nfrom SFA estimations and standard er-\nrors below the coefficients in parenthe-\nses. All variables are defined in Table 13.\nThe number of bank-year observations is\n is defined as u\n/ v\n.\nThe third step of our estimation procedure delivers our managerial RRE. We regress\nvarious bank-specific characteristics on the RRE to determine the proportion which can\nbe attributed to the bank management (managerial efficiency). As in Demerjian et al.\n(2012), we use bank characteristics to parse out RRE into bank efficiency and managerial\nefficiency: bank size, bank market share, the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets,\nthe ratio of non-performing loans to total assets and dummy variables to account for the\nbank sectors. The model looks like this:\nFull RREi,t\n\u00b7 TAi,t\n\u00b7 Market Sharei,t\n+\n\u00b7 CARi,t\n\u00b7 NPLi,t\n+ Bank Sectorsi\n+\n\u00b7 Y eart\n+ i,t\n.\nThe residual from this estimation is our measure of managerial ability.\nWe report various specifications in Panel A of Table 15, where we cluster standard\nerrors by bank and year to control for cross-sectional and intertemporal correlation. In\ncolumn (1) we show our baseline results, where we do not consider board characteristics.\nIn columns (2)-(6) we consider various board characteristics such as age, academic degree,\ntenure and board diversity to control for possible influences on RRE. We show in Panel\nB descriptive statistics of managerial RRE from the various model specifications. We\nobserve that the 1st and 99th percentile values of the managerial RRE are very close to\neach other. To further support this proximity, we report correlations of managerial RRE\nfrom the various specifications in Panel C. The correlation coefficients are larger than 0.99,\nindicating that board characteristics do not significantly change the managerial RRE in\nour sample. Therefore, we rest our analysis on the baseline specification since this yields\na substantially higher number of observations for classifying outside appointments into\ngood and bad appointees.\nTable 15: Tobit regressions.\nBoard Academic Degreei,t -0.01***\nBank sector dummies Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nYear effects Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes\nPanel B: Descriptive statistics of managerial RRE\nPanel C: Correlation\nNote: The table reports coefficients from Tobit regressions and stan-\ndard errors below the coefficients.

The value px indicates the xth percentile of the distribution of the respective\nvariable. The number of bank-year observations is 46,138.\n13Similar models are also used in banking supervision as early warning tools and to determine the\nfrequency of on-site inspections (which is, of course, higher for poorly rated banks).\n14We wish to note that banks' real liquidity risk cannot be measured adequately with the data available\nat the Deutsche Bundesbank (Porath, 2006) and, in particular for small cooperative and savings banks, a\nhigh cash and interbank-loans to total assets ratio is rather an indicator of lacking business opportunities\nthan low liquidity risk. Therefore, we follow Kick and Jahn (2014) and proxy banks' liquidity situation\nat an aggregate level instead by including the yield curve in the bank rating model.\nTable 17: Logit bank rating model.\nVariables\nBank Reservesi,t-1\nReserves Reductioni,t-1\nShare Feei,t-1\nSpreadi,t-1\nGDP Growtht-1\nBank sector dummies Yes\nNote: This table shows regression coefficients with standard errors in parentheses\nfrom a bank rating model that is based on a Logit function which transforms a\nset of bank-specific and macroeconomic covariates observed in year t-1 into the\nprobability of bank distress (PD) of a bank in year t.

The control group\nconsists of banks without any turnover, merger and distress events in the preceding and following two\nyears. For each bank in the treatment group we match control banks with replacement from the same\nyear and banking group, as well as from the same size and ROA deciles in the year before the treatment\nbank appoints the outsider. Panel A shows the results on whether both groups differ regarding ROE,\nROA, RROE, RROA and TA in the pre-event year.\nPanel A: Historical ROA Managerial RRE\nTREAT Non-TREAT Treat vs. Non-Treat TREAT Non-TREAT Treat vs. Non-Treat\nmean mean t-value mean mean t-value\nIn Panel B, coefficients come from the following difference-in-differences equation:\n Performancei,t\n\u00b7 BADi\n\u00b7 POSTi,t\n\u00b7 BADi\n\u00b7 POSTi,t\n\u00b7\n+ i,t\n.  Performancei,t\ndenotes the annual change in RROE in columns (1)-(2) and (5)-(6) and\nRROA in columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8). POSTi,t\nequals 1 in the post-treatment period. BAD (GOOD) in\ncolumns (1)-(4) denotes appointments of outsiders with below-average (above-average) historical ROA,\nand in columns (5)-(8) with below-average (above-average) managerial RRE. We consider up to three years\nbefore and after appointment. All estimations include bank-fixed effects; therefore no estimate is reported\nfor BAD and GOOD. Standard errors reported in parentheses are corrected for heteroscedasticity and\nare clustered at the level of the bank. ***, **, and * indicate that coefficients are significant at the 1%,\n5%, and 10% level, respectively.\nPanel B: Historical ROA Managerial RRE\nTable 19: Board structure for historical ROA.\nBoard controls NO YES YES YES YES\nBank controls YES YES YES YES YES\nNote: Coefficients from dynamic panel estimations with Windmeijer (2005)\ncorrected standard errors below the coefficients. The dependent variable is\nRROE. We use historical ROA as an ability measure to separate good from\nbad outside appointments. In column (1) we present the results without\nany board variables. In column (2) we add 5 dummies to control for inside\nappointments. In column (3) we add board size, in column (4) we add the\naverage age of the executive board and the average academic degree, and in\ncolumn (5) we include the average tenure of the executive board members.\nAll bank-specific, macro and year dummy variables listed in Equation (6) are\nincluded, but not reported. JPE (joint performance effect) depicts the sum of\nall coefficients belonging to a particular outsider type. *, ** and *** indicate\nsignificance of the coefficients at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.\nTable 20: Board structure for managerial RRE.\nBoard controls NO YES YES YES YES\nBank controls YES YES YES YES YES\nNote: Coefficients from dynamic panel estimations with Windmeijer (2005)\ncorrected standard errors below the coefficients.
