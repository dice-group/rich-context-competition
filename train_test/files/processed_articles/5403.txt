Because the\ncharacteristics women desire in a mate vary based on relationship context, the mate\npreferences a woman articulates may reveal her underlying mating strategies. Furthermore,\nbecause women's mate preferences vary depending on their mate value, stated mate\npreferences may be a reliable indicator of her mate value. In the present study, women's\nvideo dating profiles were analyzed to determine if her advertised mate preferences\nrevealed information about her 1) desired relationship type (i.e., short-term or long-term)\nand 2) mate value.\nRelationship Interests and Advertised Mate Preferences\nCorrelates of advertised female mate preferences\nWomen engage in a variety of mating strategies and relationship-types, including\nexclusive, committed relationships, serial mating, short-term sexual relationships, and\nextra-pair copulations (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Gangestad and Simpson, 2000; Greiling\nand Buss, 2000; Symons, 1979). However, explicitly revealing an interest in certain\nrelationship-types, such as casual sex or a short-term mating relationship, may be costly for\nwomen. Because men value sexual fidelity in long-term mates (Buss, 1989; Buss and\nSchmitt, 1993) expressing an interest in casual sex may harm a woman's long-term mating\nprospects. Furthermore, women engage in indirect aggression and victimization towards\nother women whom they perceive to be sexually accessible to men (Leenaars, Dane, and\nMarini, 2008; Vaillancourt and Sharma, 2011). These costs may result in a woman being\nless likely to explicitly reveal her relationship interests, particularly short-term mating\ninterests.\nWomen's mating interests may be determinable by assessing other, more subtle,\ncues. Previous research has produced mixed results as to whether a woman's interest and\ninclination towards different relationship-types can be determined after only briefly\nobserving her physical appearance and behavior. Early work found that strangers can\naccurately assess men's inclination towards short-term mating after viewing a video of the\ntarget, but not women's (Gangestad, Simpson, DiGeronimo, and Biek, 1992). However,\nresearch examining facial cues suggests that both men's and women's faces contain\ninformation that people use to accurately predict their mating orientation (Boothroyd,\nCross, Gray, Coombes, and Gregson-Curtis, 2011; Boothroyd, Jones, Burt, DeBruine, and\nPerrett, 2008). In one recent study, observers viewed women who were video-taped while\ninteracting with a male confederate. Although the observers were able to accurately assess\nthe woman's inclination towards short-term mating, the researchers identified some cues as\nmisleading, such as laughing, sitting close to the confederate, clothing style, and physical\nattractiveness. These misleading cues were correlated with observer perceptions of mating\norientation but not with the woman's self-reported orientation (Stillman and Maner, 2009).\nThe existence of such misleading cues may contribute to the varied success in accurately\nassessing women's mating strategies.\nA woman's advertised mate preferences may provide another window into her\nrelationship desires. Specific mate preferences are differentially preferred by women\ndepending on their relationship orientation. Women more inclined towards long-term\nmating, compared to short-term mating, place greater weight on signals of commitment and\nresource acquisition potential in a mate (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Townsend and\nWasserman, 1998). Women interested in short-term mating increase the importance placed\non sex appeal, muscularity, physical attractiveness, facial masculinity, and immediate\ndisplays of resources (Buss and Schmitt, 1993; Frederick and Haselton, 2007; Gangestad,\nGarver-Apgar, and Simpson, 2007; Haselton and Gangestad, 2006; Haselton and Miller,\nand Simpson (2000) hypothesized that because women are unlikely to be able to acquire all\ndesired traits in one mate, they favor traits related to investment ability in long-term\npartners and choose short-term mates who display \"good genes\" qualities, such as physical\nattractiveness and intelligence. As a result of these differences, attention to the specific\ntraits a woman advertises as her mate preferences should reveal her relationship interests,\neven if she does not explicitly indicate an interest in a particular relationship type.\nCorrelates of advertised female mate preferences\nMate Value and Advertised Mate Preferences\nWomen's advertised mate preferences should also reveal her underlying mate value.\nStudies across cultures have demonstrated that women higher in mate value specify more\ntraits they desire in mates than women lower in mate value (Campos, Otta, and Siqueira,\nShackelford (2008) argued that because women high in mate value are most attractive to\nmen they can afford to maintain higher standards across all categories of mate preferences.\nThey classified women's mate preferences into four clusters of characteristics: 1) \"good\ngenes\" indicators, such as physical attractiveness and intelligence, 2) good resource\nacquisition potential indicators, such as ambition, education, and good earning capacity, 3)\ngood parenting indicators, such as fondness of children, kind and understanding, and\nmaturity and 4) good partner indicators, such as being a loving partner, loyal, and\ncommitted to her. They found support for their hypothesis in a sample of newly-married\nwomen who rated their desire for mate preferences in the above categories. In line with\ntheir results, it is expected that women higher in mate value will describe mate preferences\nacross all categories.\nPresent Study and Hypotheses\nThe present study investigated if a woman's advertised mate preferences were\ncorrelated with her relationship interests and mate value. Women created a video profile for\na hypothetical dating website. Their advertised mate preferences were coded into the four\ncategories hypothesized by Buss and Shackelford (2008) to test the following hypotheses:\nH1: Short-term mating interest would be positively correlated with stating a desire for good\ngenes indicators.\nH2: Long-term mating interest would be positively correlated with stating a desire for\nresource acquisition potential indicators, good parenting indicators, and good partner\nindicators.\nH3: Mate value would be positively correlated with stating a desire for indicators across all\ncategories.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nSixty heterosexual female university undergraduates participated in the study in\nreturn for partial course credit. Data from one participant was excluded because her video\ndid not record in its entirety due to equipment malfunction. The 59 remaining participants\nas single (n = 40), dating (n = 8), exclusive relationship (n = 10), married (n = 0). One\nparticipant did not report her relationship status.\nRelationship Interests and Mate Value Measures\nParticipants answered two questions to assess current mating interests. Some\nwomen were expected to be pursuing multiple mating strategies (Gangestad and Simpson,\n2000), and a woman seeking both long-term and short-term mates may be interested in\nattracting good genes in short-term mates and other characteristics in long-term mates.\nTherefore, participants responded to independent scales to assess short-term and long-term\nCorrelates of advertised female mate preferences\nmating interest to isolate the unique relationships between mating interests and advertised\npreferences, regardless of how many mating strategies an individual participant was\npursuing. To assess current desire for short-term mating, participants responded to the item,\n\"Please rate the degree to which you are currently seeking a short-term mate (e.g. one-\nnight stand, casual sex, etc.)\" and to assess current desire for long-term mating they\nresponded to the item, \"Please rate the degree to which you are currently seeking a long-\nterm mate (e.g. committed romantic relationship, spouse, etc.).\" Both items were scored on\na 7-point scale ranging from \"1-Not at all seeking\" to \"7-Strongly seeking.\"\nTwo methods were used to assess mate-value. Participants responded to one item\nassessing self-perceived mate value (SPMV) that read, \"What do you perceive your value\non the mating market is relative to other people of your same sex?\" It was scored on a 7-\npoint scale ranging from \"Very low\" to \"Very high.\" Because physical attractiveness is a\nSymons, 1979, 1995), third-party assessments of the women's physical attractiveness\nsupplied another measure of mate value. Five raters who did not take part in the video\ncollection process rated each woman's physical attractiveness. They viewed still images of\nthe women taken from the beginning of each video before they began speaking and rated\nfacial attractiveness, body attractiveness, and overall physical attractiveness, each on a 7-\npoint scale ranging from \"Very Unattractive\" to \"Very Attractive.\" The average measures\nintra-class correlations (ICC) indicated there was a high level of agreement between raters\non these items (face ICC = .86, body ICC = .89, overall ICC = .90). This allowed for the\nuse of the average of the rater's responses to the overall physical attractiveness question as\nVideo Recording and Coding Procedure\nA cover story was used to encourage sincere participation and to assuage any\nparticipant concerns that the videos would be made public. The recruitment ad explained\nthat the researcher was interested in creating a dating website for the university population,\nand each participant would create a video as though she were going to post it to her profile\non the site. Female research assistants blind to the study's goals and hypotheses filmed the\nvideos and interacted with the participants. The research assistant expanded on the cover\nstory when the participant arrived at the lab, explaining that the researcher was deciding\nwhether or not to include video profile options on the dating website and the participant\nvideos would be analyzed to determine what information women convey. She also\ninstructed the participant that the video should be about one minute long and assured her\nthat the videos would not be uploaded to the site for public viewing.\nAfter the consent process was completed, the research assistant allowed the\nparticipant to view a profile (containing only pictures and written information, no videos)\non a mock-dating website created to convince participants of the veracity of the cover\nstory. The research assistant then provided her with a list of potential topics that individuals\noften include in dating site profiles, such as describing their favorite books and movies,\nhow they like to spend their free time, their values and worldview, and what they want in a\nrelationship partner. The research assistant explained that the topics were designed to\nprovide ideas to the participant and she was not required to use any of the topics provided.\nEach participant was filmed from approximately mid-torso up, in the same room,\nwith the chair and tripod positioned in the same place. Participants faced the camera with a\nCorrelates of advertised female mate preferences\nneutral expression and when directed began their videos with the sentence, \"Hi, thanks for\nclicking on my profile.\" After one minute of recording, the research assistant signaled to\nthe participant to conclude her video and gave her as much time as she needed to finish.\nThe research assistant stopped the recording when the participant stopped speaking if she\nspoke for less than one minute. For all participants, the research assistant offered to\nrerecord if the participant was not satisfied with her video. Seven participants filmed twice\nand in all cases the second video was used in analyses. The research assistant then left the\nroom to allow the participant to privately respond to questions about the website she had\nviewed, her experience filming her video, and her relationship interests and self-perceived\nmate value. Upon completion, the research assistant debriefed her and explained that the\ncover story was designed to encourage sincere participation but that there was no website.\nShe also asked the participant if she had believed the cover story or had any knowledge of\nthe study's goals. Four participants reported that they suspected the cover story was not\ntrue and was designed to make them behave realistically; however, no participants reported\nany knowledge of the study's specific goals or hypotheses.\nVideos ranged in length from 36 to 75 seconds (M = 63.5). Two coders who did not\nfilm or rate the participants independently coded the videos for the presence of advertised\nmate preferences in each of the four categories (for a list of characteristics in each category\nsee Buss and Shackelford, 2008). This generated four binary variables, each reflecting the\npresence or absence of advertised mate preferences in one of the four categories. There\nwere three discrepancies in the coders' judgments that were resolved by a third coder. In all\nthree cases, the coders disagreed as to whether a woman was advertising a desire for good\nparenting indicators or good partner indicators. Fourteen of the women did not state any\ndesired mate preferences (rather, they only described themselves and their interests not\nrelated to their mate preferences). This was unexpected, and another binary variable was\ncreated to reflect whether or not a woman had advertised any mate preferences at all.\nResults\nFirst, the correlations between the measures of mating interest and mate value were\ncomputed to ensure their independence from one another, and the correlations between the\nmate value measures were computed to determine if they measured similar constructs.\nSpearman's rank order correlation coefficients were performed because of non-normal\np = .75) and long-term and short-term mating interest were not significantly correlated with\none another, rs(57) = .14, p = .28. Attractiveness was not correlated with long-term mating\nHowever, attractiveness and SPMV also were not correlated with one another, rs(57) = .13,\nTable 1 shows the correlations between choosing to describe any mate preferences\nand the different categories of preferences, and mating interest, SPMV, and attractiveness.\nBecause some women did not describe any mate preferences, correlations were computed\nbetween each of the measures of mating interest and mate value with the presence of\nCorrelates of advertised female mate preferences\nstating mate preferences at all. Stating any mate preferences was negatively correlated with\nshort-term mating interest. Stating any mate preferences was also positively correlated with\nobjectively observed physical attractiveness.\nThe 14 women who did not state any mate preferences were excluded from the\nanalyses examining relationships between specific categories of mate preferences and\nmating interests and mate value. Two correlations between mating interest or mate value\nand any of the categories of mate preferences were significant. Describing good partner\nindicators was positively correlated with long-term mating interest. SPMV was positively\ncorrelated with describing good genes indicators. Upon discovering this correlation, the\ngood genes characteristics were further delineated into two major categories: intelligence\nand physical attractiveness. SPMV was significantly positively correlated with describing\ncharacteristics related to physical attractiveness, but not intelligence.\nTable 1. Stated mate preferences correlations with short-term mating (STM) interest, long-\nterm mating (LTM) interest, attractiveness, and SPMV.\nMate Preference STM LTM Attractiveness SPMV\nPreference Type:\nThere were no relationships between the length of the women's videos or speed\nwith which they spoke and mating interest or mate value. Length and words per second\n(WPS) were unrelated to short-term mating interest (length: r(57) = -.12, p = .38, WPS:\nthe relationships between the relationship interests or mate value and mate preferences\ncould not be attributable to women speaking more slowly or for a shorter period of time.\nDiscussion\nThe data revealed differences in women's advertised mate preferences associated\nwith their relationship interests and mate value. The hypothesis that long-term mating\ninterest would be positively correlated with describing good partner traits in a desired mate\nwas supported. This demonstrates that long-term mating interested women's advertised\nmate preferences communicate their mating orientation. The relative youth of the sample\nmay explain why long-term mating interest was not correlated with desiring resource\nacquisition potential traits and good parenting traits. The women in this sample may be\nCorrelates of advertised female mate preferences\nconcerned that advertising those mate preferences may make them appear unattractive, or\ntoo demanding, to males of a similar age. Future research could benefit from examining a\nbroader age range of women to determine if and when these advertised preferences change.\nThe hypothesis that women interested in short-term mating would preference good\ngenes indicators was not supported. Researchers have hypothesized different functions for\nshort-term mating other than obtaining good genes, such as obtaining immediate resource\ninvestment, ending a relationship with a current long-term partner in favor of a new one,\nand engaging in a short-term mating relationship with the goal of converting it into a long-\nterm committed relationship (Greiling and Buss, 2000). Mate preferences should vary in\nservice of these functions such that assessing short-term mating interest alone provides\ninsufficient predictive value. Furthermore, short-term mating interested women were less\nlikely to describe any desired partner traits at all. Instead, they opted to use their time to\ndescribe themselves and their other interests. Short-term mating interested women may be\nbetter served by advertising themselves and their attributes to achieve their mating goals.\nThese results suggest that future research should focus on how the advertised preferences\nof short-term mating interested women will differ based on the different hypothesized\nfunctions of short-term mating.\nWomen's attractiveness was positively correlated with describing mate preferences\noverall, although each mate preference category was unrelated to attractiveness. This\npositive correlation supports the hypothesis put forward by Buss and Shackelford (2008)\nthat women higher in mate value will be more demanding in their mate preferences.\nInterestingly, SPMV showed a different pattern of results than attractiveness. The non-\nsignificant correlation between SPMV and attractiveness indicates that women's perception\nof their own mate value was unrelated to their physical attractiveness. SPMV was\npositively correlated with stating a preference for good genes traits. Women who had a\nhigh opinion of their relative mate value were more likely to describe traits they desired in\nmates related specifically to physical attractiveness. Perhaps these women preference these\ntraits as a misleading signal to their attractiveness. By being more demanding, they mimic\nwomen who are objectively more physically attractive. However, their focus on physical\nattractiveness is a cue that their SPMV differs from their other-observed mate value.\nLimitations regarding the assessment of mate preferences, mating interests and self-\nperceived mate value should also be noted. The single items assessing each construct may\nnot have comprehensively captured women attitudes and desires. Furthermore, women may\nnot always be consciously aware of, or willing to admit to, their mating interests or mate\nvalue. Future research would benefit from reexamining the hypotheses tested here using\nmore comprehensive measures and measures that rely less on self-report. Also, it is\npossible that the results of the present study do not comprehensively reflect women's mate\npreferences because participants were limited in the time they had to prepare and record\ntheir videos. Given the opportunity to consider all identified preferred mate characteristics,\nthese results may have been different. However, other studies using data sources in which\npeople generate descriptions of mate preferences have replicated findings of studies in\nwhich people are given the opportunity to rate comprehensive lists of traits (Dunn, Brinton,\nindicate that these data sources provide another method of accessing women's mate\npreferences.\nCorrelates of advertised female mate preferences\nIdentifying valid cues to mating interest and mate value benefits our understanding\nof women's mate preferences. Furthermore, this study identified important individual\ndifferences that predict how women will advertise themselves in a mate attraction scenario\nand provides unique knowledge as to how a woman's advertised mate preferences in a\nrealistic mate attraction context reveal more about her than what she explicitly says.\n"
