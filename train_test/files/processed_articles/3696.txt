Over the years, an\norganization's employees attain knowledge while perform-\ning their specific tasks. This knowledge resides in their\nminds and has not been put in structured, documented based\nform. The knowledge has been acquired along the years\nwhile taking the decisions in crucial situations, solving the\nproblems. It is one of the most difficult task to transfer this\nknowledge to others but, however, this knowledge is one of\nthe most valuable asset for any organization to lose.\nKnowledge management (KM) facilitates the retention and\ndistribution of knowledge within an organization to gain\ncompetitive advantage. Organizations are implementing\nKM to reserve and utilize this knowledge.\nKM is a broad concept that addresses the full range of\nprocesses by which an organization deploys knowledge.\nThese involve the acquisition, retention, storage, distribu-\ntion, and use of knowledge in an organization.\nThe basic components of educational institutions are CD\nand research and human resource, namely, the knowledge\nworkers can play a vital role for improving CD and research.\nThe growth in the number of internet users has given an\nadded impetus to globalization. Information patterns have\ntransformed the electronic information systems by the use of\ncyber technologies. As a result of this, knowledge transmis-\nsion patterns within academic organizations must develop\nand change the education systems for information to be\neffectively transmitted.

The knowledge revolution has\ninvaded India, and higher education institutions are recog-\nnized to be in the knowledge business. The higher educa-\ntionalinstitutesarebeingincreasinglyexposedtomarketplace\npressures and have to focus on new competitive strategies to\nremain ahead. Drucker (1993) has described knowledge,\nrather than capital or labor, as the only meaningful economic\nresource in the knowledge society. Thus, there is a need to\nfocus on knowledge and KM. Organizations that succeed in\nKM are likely to view knowledge as an asset and to develop\norganizational norms and values that support the creation\nand sharing of knowledge (Davenport, DeLong, & Beers,\n1998). KM is generally about the gathering, storing, dissemi-\nnating, and application of knowledge via the know-how and\ncreation of work by the individuals in an organization (Miller,\n1999). KM as a discipline encourages a mutually supported\nmethod to create, capture, organize, and use information\neasily measurable as well as more difficult to measure infor-\nmation that is either unspoken or informal.\nKnowledge is a gradual transition from data to informa-\ntion. According to Japanese author Nonaka (1994) with\nenough preparation, we should be able to tap into that reser-\nvoir--and ride the wave--by utilizing new ways to channel\nraw data into meaningful information. That information, in\nturn, can then become the knowledge that leads to wisdom.\nInformation is a relationship between data and, quite simply,\nwhat it is, with great dependence on context for its meaning\nand with little implication for the future (Alberthal, 1995;\nKM is defined as the process of transforming information\nand intellectual assets into enduring value. KM connects\npeople with the knowledge that they need to take action\nwhen they need it (Kidwell, Karen, & Johnson, 2000). KM\nconsists of explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge (Tiwana,\n2000). KM is generally about the gathering, storing, dissemi-\nnating, and application of knowledge via the know-how and\ncreation of work by the individuals in an organization (Miller,\n1999). Knowledge refers to the sum of what is known: A\nfamiliarity, awareness, or understanding gained through\nexperience that, in a business context, guide operations and\nadministrativeprocesses(Coukos&Eleni,2003).Knowledge\nrepresents a pattern that connects and generally provides a\nhigh level of predictability, for example, if the humidity is\nvery high and the temperature drops substantially, the atmo-\nsphere is often unlikely to be able to hold the moisture, so it\nA common way to discuss knowledge is by dividing it\ninto two dimensions, explicit knowledge and tacit knowl-\nedge. Explicit knowledge can be expressed in words and\nnumbers and is shared in the form of data, manuals, copy-\ntage of this type of knowledge is that it is easily accessible\nfor other people, and can therefore be reused to solve similar\nproblems (Smith, 2001). Explicit knowledge is documented\ninformation that can facilitate action. It can be expressed in\nformal, shared language (Kidwell et al., 2000).\nTacit knowledge is often seen as the iceberg below the\nsurface of the water, that is, unseen and embedded in our\nsocial identity and practice (Spender, 1996). Tacit knowl-\nedge is deeply rooted in actions and experiences as well as in\nthe ideals, values, or emotions that an individual embraces\n(Nonaka & Nishiguchi, 2001). Most business actions require\nthe guidance of explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge\nManagement consulting firms, which are considered as\nknowledge-based companies, have a high level of interest in\nKM because their capacity to compete on the basis of accu-\nmulated knowledge is important for their industry (Dunford,\nThe management consulting industry has experienced a\nultimate goal for a company is to ensure that the knowledge\n\"does not go home at night,\" that is, knowledge should\nbecome a part of the organization as a whole (Kreiner, 2002).\nThe aim of KM, for an organization, is to create a capable\norganization that measures, stores, and turns knowledge into\na capital, in other words, to create a learning organization\n(Bollinger & Smith, 2001). Researchers claim that the key\nfor this process of making individual knowledge a part of the\norganization is personal commitment (Goh, 2002; Nonaka,\nKM and Higher Education\nKM in education can therefore be thought of as a framework\nor an approach that enables people within the institution to\ndevelop a set of practices to collect information and share\nwhat they know leading to actions that improve services and\nImplementing KM practices wisely is what smartest orga-\nnizations are learning all over again (Kidwell et al., 2000).\nAccording to Coukos and Eleni (2003), in business sector,\nknowledge is now being perceived as a valuable asset.\nOrganizational knowledge refers to knowledge of the overall\nKiran et al. 3\nbusiness the organization is in, the organization's strengths\nand weaknesses, the markets it serves, and the factors critical\nto organizational success. Universities also rely on faculty-\ngenerated knowledge and traditional means of discovery and\ntransmission of knowledge. KM in higher education supplies\nus with a framework for understanding how good assessment\npractice, in fact, depends on effective information system\nKM system can create a common gateway to the data,\ninformation, and knowledge. People throughout the higher\neducational institutions need to effectively share information\nand work together on projects. When employees use KM sys-\ntem, best practices are stored throughout the organization,\nand each employee accessing the system has power similar to\nthe best employee (Markus, 2002). In academia, most of the\ntacit knowledge associated with an area of study lies with the\nfaculty who study it. The tacit knowledge of literature may be\nwhat characterizes much of the informal, side-conversations\nat academic conferences, in discussions between graduate\nstudents and their mentors (Hawkins, 2000).\nThe objectives of the present study are to\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 identify the key KM strategies acceptable to the two\ngroups of knowledge users--the senior academia,\nnamely, professors, associate professors, the thought\nleaders of KM, and junior academia consisting of\nassistant professors and lecturers, regarding KM\nstrategies;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 identify the key factors for KM-based portal for CD\nacceptable to senior and junior academia;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 identify the key factors for KM-based portal for\nresearch acceptable to senior and junior academia;\nand\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 assess the benefits of the proposed KM framework for\nCD and research.\nDesign and Method\nData have been collected through a survey questionnaire\nbased on Likert-type scale and supported by personal inter-\nviews. The questionnaire has been designed according to the\nfollowing research objectives and it contains these sections:\n1. Information and communication technologies (ICTs)\nstatus of IHTE\n2. KM implementation and knowledge-based techno-\nlogies\n3. KM portal for CD\n4. Benefits of KM-based portal for CD\n5. KM portal for research\n6. Benefits of KM-based portal for research.\nAs seen from the results, the Cronbach's alpha values\nReliability depicts internal consistency of questionnaire.\nAccording to Nunally (1978), the generally accepted\nstandard for reliability estimates are values greater than .70.\nThus, the results highlight the internal consistency of the\nquestionnaire (see Table 1).\nResults and Findings\nICT Scenario and Need for ICT\nThe initial part of research focused on knowing the ICT\ninfrastructure of the institutions (see Table 2).\nRegarding ICT status of IHTEs surveyed, there was\nalmost consensus among the senior and junior academia\nregarding ICT skills and applications needed to keep the\npace with world in the knowledge age and this got the first\nrank. The usage of ICT to improve knowledge sharing among\neducator and students was placed at second rank. There was\na difference of opinion regarding whether educators could\nuse the new technology to improve their teaching, to give it\nmore variety, for example, PowerPoint shows, web discus-\nsions, uniform resource locator (URL) collections, and web-\nsites. As most of the institutions are in the implementation\nstage of KM and have not switched to complete KM adop-\ntion, the levels of infrastructure at many IHTEs could be a\nreason for this.\nKM Policies\nBefore turning to KM portal for research and CD, it is essen-\ntial to know about the institute culture toward KM strategies.\nRegarding KM system in IHTEs, topmost priority by junior\nand senior academia has been given to values system or cul-\nture intended to promote knowledge sharing, followed by\nusing partnerships or strategic alliances to acquire knowl-\nedge. Least priority has been given to rewarding the employ-\nees monetarily or nonmonetarily (see Table 3).\nKnowledge Acquisition\nIHTEs by nature are the power house of knowledge. The\norganization should make an effort to acquire explicit\nTable 1. Reliability Index.\nS. No. Factor\nNumber\nof items\nCronbach's\nalpha\n1.

It can be accomplished by dedicating\nresources to detect and obtain external knowledge. IHTE's\ninterest to acquire knowledge and methods used is investi-\ngated to find out whether there is an acceptance regarding\nknowledge acquisition among the senior and junior aca-\ndemia (see Table 4).\nHypothesis 1: There is a significant difference among the\nsenior academia, namely, professors, associate profes-\nsors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior academia\nconsisting of assistant professors and lecturers, regard-\ning KM acquisition.\nFor KM strategies, knowledge technologies, knowledge\nacquisition, knowledge storage, and knowledge dissemina-\ntion of IHTEs have been considered.\nANOVA results for knowledge acquisition highlight that\nthere is a significant difference between senior and junior\nacademia, which is significant for all but one item of knowl-\nedge acquisition.\nKnowledge Storage\nTo utilize the acquired knowledge for future use, it should be\nstored systematically. The study attempts to inquire whether\nthere is a difference in opinion of senior and junior academia\nregarding the methods for storing knowledge (see Table 5).\nHypothesis 2: There is a significant difference among the\nsenior academia, namely, professors, associate profes-\nsors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior academia\nconsisting of assistant professors and lecturers, regard-\ning knowledge storage.\nFor KM storage, there is a significant difference between\nsenior and junior academia regarding knowledge storage by\nusing the portal system. Knowledge storage by having the\ndepartment-wise database and knowledge storage by main-\ntaining \"best practices and lessons learned\" database are not\nsignificant as seen from p ratio. Thus, the above hypothesis\nhas been partially accepted.\nKnowledge Dissemination\nThe process described so far encompasses the collection and\nstorage of knowledge generated, information gathered, and\nlessons learned to allow an organization to capitalize on its\nexperience and improve its performance. The stored knowl-\nedge has to be disseminated effectively for sharing the ben-\nefits. Knowledge can be shared in traditional ways and also\nwith technology-driven modes (see Table 6).\nHypothesis 3: There is a significant difference among the\nsenior academia, namely, professors, associate profes-\nsors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior academia\nconsisting of assistant professors and lecturers, regard-\ning knowledge dissemination.\nANOVA results for job status and knowledge dissemina-\ntion highlight that (a) regularly updating databases of good\nwork practices and lessons learned, (b) sharing via intranet\nshows significant difference, and (c) knowledge sharing\ncommittees. Thus for three items out of five, there is a\nKiran et al. 5\nTable 4.

IT and the advent of the per-\nsonal computer have greatly enhanced organizational\neffectiveness, interorganizational deployment, and cogni-\ntive advance (Grover & Davenport, 2001). In the age of\ntechnology, one has many options to opt from the available\nICTs. KM technologies considered in the present study are\nas follows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Internet: It is a worldwide system of computer net-\nworks--A network of networks in which users at any\none computer can, if they have permission, get infor-\nmation from any other computer.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Intranet: It is a privately maintained computer net-\nwork that can be accessed only by authorized persons,\nespecially members or employees of the organization\nthat owns it.\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 6.

A data-\nbase is specifically structured for information access\nand reporting.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Document management: It is the process of handling\ndocuments in such a way that information can be cre-\nated, shared, organized, and stored efficiently and\nappropriately.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Blog: It is a frequent, chronological publication of\npersonal thoughts and web links.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Decision support system (DSS): It is an interactive\nsoftware-based system intended to help decision mak-\ners compile useful information from raw data, docu-\nments, personal knowledge, and/or business models\nto identify and solve problems and make decisions.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Artificial intelligence (AI): It is the study and design\nof intelligent agents where an intelligent agent is a\nsystem that perceives its environment and takes\nactions that maximize its chances of success.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Groupware: It refers to programs that help people\nwork together collectively while located remotely\nfrom each other. Groupware services can include the\nsharing of calendars, collective writing, email han-\ndling, shared database access, electronic meetings\nwith each person able to see and display information\nto others, and other activities. Groupware provides a\nmechanism that helps users coordinate and keep track\nof ongoing projects together.\nHypothesis 4: There is a significant difference among the\nsenior academia, namely, professors, associate profes-\nsors, the thought leaders of KM, and junior academia\nconsisting of assistant professors and lecturers, regard-\ning KM technologies.\nANOVA results highlight that there is a significant differ-\nence between senior and junior academia as regards five out\nof eight KM technologies. These are (a) intranet (such as\ninternal portals), (b) document management, (c) blogs, (d)\nDSS, and (e) groupware (see Table 7).\nThus, the present hypothesis has been accepted.\nKM Framework for Research\nThe study considered opinions of senior and junior academia\non the following features for research framework:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Research interests within an institution or affiliated\ninstitutions\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Research results and funding organizations\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Commercial opportunities for research results\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Funding opportunities\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Prepopulated proposals, budgets, and protocols\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Proposal routing policies and procedures\nKiran et al. 7\nTable 7.

Thus, the above\nhypothesis has not been accepted (see Table 8).\nThus, the next section of the survey related to finding out\nfrom the academia the areas of education that will benefit the\nmost with the implementation of KM. The factor analysis\nmethod has been applied on the data. Principal components\nfactor analysis with varimax rotation and Kaiser normaliza-\ntion has been applied.\nThe results highlight three factors, namely (a) reduced\nturnaround time and cost of research and administrative\ntasks, (b) better curriculum and interdisciplinary research,\n8 SAGE Open\nand (c) improved services to cultivate future scientists'\nThese factors are explained below:\nReduced turnaround time and cost of research and admin-\nistrative tasks: This factor has emerged as a most\nimportant factor with a total variance of 42.020.

The above\nresults of factor analysis based on the perception of academia\nof IHTE support that KM portal for research will lead to bet-\nter curriculum and interdisciplinary research help in provid-\ning improved services to cultivate future scientists. These\ntwo factors are important benefits of research. The last fac-\ntor, that is, reduced turnaround time and cost of research and\nadministrative tasks, has lower mean compared with other\ntwo factors and is relatively low on priority list of academia.\nThus, there has been an overwhelming support from the aca-\ndemia for the implementation of KM in research as seen\nfrom the results of survey.\nTable 11.

The results of the study highlight that there is\na significant difference among the two knowledge groups of\nusers, the senior academia/thought leaders and junior aca-\ndemia/followers, regarding knowledge technologies, knowl-\nedge acquisition, knowledge storage, and knowledge\ndissemination.\nThe next objective has been to identify the key factors for\nKM-based portal for CD acceptable to senior and junior\nacademia. The results indicate that there is no significant dif-\nference regarding KM-based framework for CD.\nThe third objective has been to identify the key factors for\nKM-based portal for research acceptable to senior and\njunior academia. A positive finding has been that here also\nthe two groups have accepted the features of research to be\nincluded in KM framework for research. Thus, the features\nchosen by researchers for KM-based framework for CD and\nresearch are acceptable to both the groups.\nThe last and most important objective has been to assess\nthe benefits of the proposed KM framework for CD and\nresearch. The researchers also tried to assess the perceived\nbenefits of KM-based framework for CD and research.\nRegarding CD benefits, curriculum improvisation and fac-\nulty development and reduced turnaround time of CD are\nable to explain 77.35% of variation. Curriculum improvisa-\ntion is considered more important as it has higher factor\nloadings and mean. The results highlight three factors,\nnamely (a) reduced turnaround time and cost of research and\nadministrative tasks, (b) better curriculum and interdisciplin-\nary research, and (c) improved services to cultivate future\nscientists' account for 67.134 of total variance. Better cur-\nriculum and interdisciplinary research had higher loadings\nand higher mean score than other factors and is thus more\nimportant than other factors.\nSignificance of the Study\nThis study is useful for academicians as well as thought lead-\ners involved in policy making in academic institutions as it\nrelates to identifying the factors for research and curriculum\nportal in IHTE. Dimensions used for knowledge acquisition,\nknowledge storage, and knowledge dissemination have been\nidentified by the study. The study helps in analyzing the\nimportant KM technologies used for KM sharing by existing\nIHTE. The study is a successful attempt in revealing the fac-\ntors of research and CD that require more attention for\nknowledge sharing.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlberthal, L.
