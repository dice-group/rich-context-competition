    "abstract": "Abstract. Visual discomfort has been reported for certain visual stimuli and under particular viewing\nconditions, such as stereoscopic viewing. In stereoscopic viewing, visual discomfort can be caused\nby a conflict between accommodation and convergence cues that may specify different distances\nin depth. Earlier research has shown that depth-of-field, which is the distance range in depth in the\nscene that is perceived to be sharp, influences both the perception of egocentric distance to the\nfocal plane, and the distance range in depth between objects in the scene. Because depth-of-field\nmay also be in conflict with convergence and the accommodative state of the eyes, we raised the\nquestion of whether depth-of-field affects discomfort when viewing stereoscopic photographs. The\nfirst experiment assessed whether discomfort increases when depth-of-field is in conflict with coherent\naccommodation\u00adconvergence cues to distance in depth. The second experiment assessed whether\ndepth-of-field influences discomfort from a pre-existing accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict.\nResults showed no effect of depth-of-field on visual discomfort. These results suggest therefore that\ndepth-of-field can be used as a cue to depth without inducing discomfort in the viewer, even when\ncue conflicts are large.\n",

Images usually contain projections of objects at different\ndistances from the camera. The distance range of objects that are in acceptable focus in the resulting\nimage is determined by the optics of the camera, and is called the image's \"depth-of-field\" (DOF).\nStrictly speaking, the DOF is the range of real-world depth within which all objects are in acceptable\nfocus, as shown in Figure 1. The effects of DOF on the image will be referred to here as DOF blur.\nAll other things being equal, the smaller the DOF, the greater is the blur circle (more of the image\nis blurred). Blurring effects from DOF depend on both the distance from the observer to the focal point\n(termed here \"egocentric distance\"), and the aperture size (see Equation (1), based on that given by\ns\nd\nd\nd\nwhere b is the blur circle, the diameter of the part of the image determined to be blurred, A is the\npupil diameter, s\nis the axial length, d\n\"egocentric distance\" is the distance from the observer to the\nVisual discomfort and depth-of-field\nVisual discomfort and depth-of-field 157\nfocal point, and d\n\"flanker distance\" is the distance in depth from the observer to the blurred object\n(flanker). The diameter of the blur circle increases with increasing distance in depth from the point of\nfocus.\nAs can be seen from Equation (1), DOF depends on the aperture size relative to the viewing dis-\ntance. A shallow DOF occurs when the viewing distance is relatively small compared with the aperture\ndiameter and thus typically occurs at close viewing distances or large aperture sizes (see Equation (1)).\nA shallow DOF creates a large amount of blur in the resulting image with just a small depth difference\nbetween the focal plane and the object. This is demonstrated in the left photograph of Figure 2, which\nwas created using a large camera aperture, and therefore the resulting image has a shallow DOF, and\na large amount of image blur. The right photograph of Figure 2 was taken using a small aperture, and\ntherefore much of the image is in sharp focus.\nDepth-of-field as a cue to distance\nAs DOF depends on the viewing distance and aperture size, DOF blur could conceivably be used as a\ncue to egocentric distance (between the observer and the focal plane) as well as to the depth range (the\nrange of depths of the objects present in the scene). Empirical data suggest that observers indeed use\nDOF blur in this way. Vishwanath and Blaser (2010) showed that DOF blur affects estimates of ego-\ncentric distance; increasing blur gradients caused observers to report smaller estimates of egocentric\ndistance to the focal point. Held, Cooper, O'Brien, and Banks (2010) showed that perceived camera\ndistance was significantly affected by introducing blur gradients to photographs that simulated DOF\nblur. Nefs (2012) showed that perceived depth is greater with a shallow DOF than with a deep DOF\nin non-stereo photographs. Blur gradients also affect the perception of a plane slanted in depth under\nmonocular viewing conditions (Watt, Akeley, Ernst, & Banks, 2005). Currently, unpublished observa-\ntions by Zhang, Nefs, and Heynderickx (in preparation) indicate that observers are able to reliably\ndiscriminate differences in DOF, and that this ability depends on the scale of the scene in both stereo\nand non-stereo photographs. Additionally, Held, Cooper, and Banks (2012) found that just-noticeable\nFigure 1. A simplified diagram of depth-of-field and the blurring effects caused by DOF-related optics.

A is the aperture.\nFigure 2. Depth-of-field effects. Left: shallow depth-of-field, with large blur gradients. Although the background\nof the photograph on the left is mostly blurred, the focal point is sharp. Right: large depth-of-field: much of the\nimage is in focus, even the flanking objects, which are farther away than the focal point.\n158 O'Hare L, Zhang T, Nefs H T, Hibbard P B\ndifference (JND) for perceived depth from disparity and DOF blur was dependent on egocentric\ndistance--at closer egocentric distances, smaller JNDs were found with disparity cues, but at farther\ndistances, DOF blur cues specifying depth resulted in smaller JNDs. This suggests that DOF blur\nmight even represent a more useful cue to depth than disparity at these greater egocentric distances.\nEarlier research has shown that DOF blur can not only be detected but may also influence per-\nformance when using stereoscopic displays. Banks, Akeley, Hoffman, and Girshick (2008) found per-\nformance at an orientation detection task improved when blur was appropriate for the convergence\ndistance. Additionally, DOF blur can also reduce rivalry from monocular regions in stereoscopic\nimages (Hoffman & Banks, 2010). Hillaire, Lecuyer, Cozot, & Casiez (2008) showed that adding blur\ngradients to simulate DOF blur cues facilitated computer-game playing for inexperienced players, and\nthese players also judged the DOF blur gradients to add realism to the scenes. However, the perform-\nance of experienced players was not increased with the addition of these blur gradients. Some players\njudged the additional blur to increase fatigue and discomfort. Therefore, DOF blur can be judged as\nmore aesthetically pleasing and facilitate performance, but can also hinder performance and induce\nvisual discomfort.\nDiscomfort from stereoscopic displays\nStereoscopic viewing often involves conflicting accommodation\u00adconvergence cues that arise from\npresenting stimuli at non-zero disparities. This conflict can be a source of discomfort in stereoscopic\nimages (e.g. Hoffman, Girshick, Akeley, & Banks, 2008; Shibata, Kim, Hoffman, & Banks, 2011a;\nShibata, Kim, Hoffman, & Banks, 2011b; Wann, Rushton, & Mon-Williams, 1995). DOF blurring pro-\nvides an additional source of egocentric distance information, which can conflict with that from other\ncues. This raises the possibility that DOF blur could also affect discomfort in stereoscopic displays.\nThere are at least two ways in which this could occur. First, if the visual system has tacit knowledge\nof the appropriate DOF blur for the scene, given the instantaneous pupil size and the estimate of ego-\ncentric distance from accommodation and convergence, then inappropriate DOF blur gradients could\ncause visual discomfort through conflict with other cues. These situations can easily arise when view-\ning stereoscopic photographs if the camera aperture was larger than can possibly be achieved with a\nreal human pupil.\nSecond,DOFblurgradientsmightinfluencethediscomfortcausedbypre-existingaccommodation\u00ad\nconvergence conflicts. For example, DOF blur specifying that the focal plane is at the screen distance\nprovides additional evidence to support the accommodation response. If convergence specifies a dif-\nferent distance, this would increase the conflict between the combined-cue distance estimate and the\nconvergence-based distance estimate. Alternatively, DOF blur could erode the disparity signal from\nthe objects in the background, because precise estimation of disparity relies on high spatial frequency\ninformation (Smallman & MacLeod, 1997). Blurring the high spatial frequencies would then reduce\nthe reliability of the disparity-defined convergence cue, such that it would provide less precise infor-\nmation about convergence. This weakening may in turn affect the magnitude of the accommoda-\ntion\u00adconvergence conflict as well. Thus, DOF blur might reduce the effect of the accommodation\u00ad\nconvergence conflict on discomfort.\nVisual discomfort and blur\nIn addition to providing a potentially conflicting depth cue, blur itself can be a direct cause of discom-\nfort. Manipulations that decrease the relative power at high spatial frequencies, compared with the\npower typically present in natural images, increase visual discomfort (Fernandez & Wilkins, 2008;\nSuch manipulations tend to be perceived as a blurring of the image (Murray & Bex, 2010). These\nresults might lead us to expect that DOF blur gradients also cause discomfort. However, an important\ndistinction is that these studies have typically used global manipulations, which decrease the power\nat high spatial frequencies uniformly across the image, including the point of interest. This kind of\nglobal filtering is similar to the blurring that occurs when images are incorrectly focussed, which are\nblurred at all points in the image, including the point of interest. This situation is termed \"defocussed\"\nhere. The accommodation response of the human eye uses high spatial frequency information to pro-\nvide feedback for guiding responses (Charman, 1979; Charman & Tucker, 1977), so removing this\ninformation would impair accommodation control. Accommodation responses have been related to\nvisual discomfort--prolonged reading tasks can increase discomfort judgements and also increase\naccommodative lag for some individuals (Tosha, Borsting, Ridder, & Chase, 2009). Globally blurred\nVisual discomfort and depth-of-field 159\nimages could therefore be uncomfortable because they provide an insufficient signal for the control of\naccommodation.\nBy contrast, DOF blur gradients do not affect the accommodation response (Day, Siedel, Gray, &\nStrang, 2009): despite the majority of the image being blurred, the fixation point is in focus. It follows\nfrom this that, if DOF blur manipulations alone affect discomfort, then the cause must be blur per se,\nrather than its effect on accommodation responses. For this reason, DOF blur gradients are of theoreti-\ncal interest for understanding why blur can sometimes cause discomfort.\nSimilar considerations apply when we consider why accommodation\u00adconvergence cue conflicts\ncause discomfort. This could be due to a motor conflict, arising from the cross-coupling between\naccommodation and convergence (Wann et al., 1995), or a sensory discrepancy between the conflict-\ning estimates of distance from the two cues. If motor responses were responsible for discomfort, then\nDOF blur gradients would not be expected to directly contribute to this, as DOF blur does not affect\nthe accommodation response. However, if sensory discrepancies are the cause of discomfort, then\ninappropriate DOF blur gradients might be expected to affect discomfort judgements, as these will\nspecify a different depth from that specified by convergence and accommodation cues.\nCurrent study\nThe first purpose of the current study was to investigate the role of DOF blur as a potential source of\nvisual discomfort. The second purpose was to ascertain how DOF blur affects a known cause of visual\ndiscomfort, namely the conflict between accommodation and convergence. In Experiment 1, the dis-\ntance to the focal plane was defined by consistent accommodation and convergence cues. The focal\nplane thus remained at zero disparity, that is, at the screen distance. The magnitude of DOF blur was\nmanipulated by changing the camera aperture. DOF was either (1) appropriate for human optics (f11,\nappropriate levels of blur), (2) too deep (f22, too little blur), or (3) too shallow (f4, too much blur). We\ntested whether the appropriate level of DOF blurring for the assumed human optics would result in less\ndiscomfort than either too much or too little blur.\nIn Experiment 2, we assessed whether DOF blur acted on a pre-existing accommodation\u00adconver-\ngence conflict. The accommodative distance remained constant at the screen distance. The conver-\ngence-defined distance however varied with the depth of the objects in the scene. This had the result\nthat the disparity-defined focal point was projected to a closer distance than that specified by accom-\nmodation cues. In Experiment 2, the central object was always the one in sharp focus. However, it was\nno longer at zero disparity, thus creating a convergence\u00adaccommodation conflict.\nApparatus\nScenes were photographed using a Nikon D90 digital camera with a fixed focal length lens of 50 mm.\nPhotographs of the scenes were taken in a light box (Verivide Ltd., Leicester) to make the colour stereo\nhalf images. The direct illumination was from an overhead D65 840 lux daylight bulb. Stimuli were\npresented on a Wheatstone stereoscope consisting of two 17-inch NEC AccuSync LCD 72vm moni-\ntors, which were gamma corrected for colour using a Spyder pro 3 (Datacolor AG). Screen size was\nlength from the observer's eyes to the screens was 53 cm, via two front-silvered mirrors. The orienta-\ntion of the mirrors was set so that the distance specified by convergence to the screen was the same as\nthe accommodation-defined distance. Images were displayed using MATLAB 2006 (The Mathworks\nLtd.) and the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner, Brainard, & Pelli, 2007;\nPelli, 1997). A diagram of the experimental set-up is shown in Figure 3. Head movements were re-\nstricted using a chinrest.\nStimuli\nThe scenes consisted of three objects each, which were arranged in a V pattern in depth (see Figure 3).\nThe central object was a miniature book, a wind-up toy, or a packet of playing cards. Flanking ob-\njects were packets of tissues, highlighter pens, or stationary packets (paper-clips and drawing-pins).\nThumbnails of the nine scenes can be seen in Figure 4. Colour stereo half-images (JPEG) were resized\nto 550  880 pixels using bilinear interpolation, which resulted in an image 14.5 cm high on the\ndisplays, and subtended 15.3\u00b0 of visual angle vertically. Photographs were spatially vignetted with a\ncircular window of radius 300 pixels. Outside of this radius, the edges of this window fell off with a\n160 O'Hare L, Zhang T, Nefs H T, Hibbard P B\nGaussian profile of  5 1.81\u00b0. This was done to soften the edges of the circle, which would otherwise\nprovide a sharp luminance gradient that could be used to focus the images.\nThere were three levels of DOF blur for each flanker distance, namely (1) too shallow, (2) appro-\npriate, or (3) too deep given the convergence- and accommodation-defined distance. The mean lumi-\nnance of the images was 3.75 cd/m2. The amount of physical depth that would be needed to create this\namount of DOF blur (given the assumed optics) was calculated using Equation (1), and can be seen\nin Table 1. The central object was presented at zero disparity (i.e. the screen distance). Two flankers\nappeared at either side of the central object. The flankers were placed at a visual angle of 5\u00b0 either\nside of the target object in all cases. Thus, the objects moved further apart with increasing depth. The\nflankers had a disparity-defined depth away from the central object corresponding to distances of 60,\nFigure 3. Experimental set-up. The observer views the scene through a Wheatstone stereoscope. The photographs\nwere taken with the focal point and flankers in the V pattern in depth, with the flankers subtending 5\u00b0 of the visual\nangle for all three distances.\nFigure 4. The nine possible scenes, in each case showing the left image, taken with f4 at a 60-cm flanker distance.\nVisual discomfort and depth-of-field 161\n70, or 80 cm. Pupil diameter was assumed to be 4.5 mm, which is the expected size given that average\npresentation luminance was close to 3 cd/m2 (de Groot & Gebhard, 1952). Photographs were taken\nof the scenes using the corresponding camera aperture, namely f22, f11, and f4 for the 50 mm lens.\nF-numbers are strictly speaking not apertures, but specify the ratio of the focal length to the aperture\ndiameter. As focal length is constant in this experiment, f-number is used as a proxy for aperture, as\nit is a direct expression of the camera settings used. It should be noted that f11 in the current camera\nsetting would correspond to the human eye with a pupil diameter of 4.5 mm. Our modelling is based\non geometric optics and therefore does not contain any of the aberrations of the human eye (Thibos,\nHimebaugh, & Coe, 2006). This does not affect our experiment because the subject's eye would have\nintroduced the effects due to aberrations.\nThere were nine different scenes in total (see Figure 4). For each scene, there were three possible\nresulted in 81 different stimuli. Stimulus f-stop, blur circle, corresponding flanker distances, and the\nappropriate theoretical distance for that particular amount of DOF blur are shown in Table 1.\nIt can be seen from Table 1 that the blur circle from the optics of the eye (second column) is similar\nto f11 (fourth column) for a camera lens with a focal length of 50 mm and a focus distance of 53 cm.\nTaking the photograph with the same scene, but using a larger camera aperture (smaller f-stop: f4)\nresults in too much DOF blur given the distance and a 4.5 mm aperture for the eye. Taking the photo-\ngraph with a smaller camera aperture (larger f-stop: f22) results in too little DOF blur. Given the optics\nof the eye, this level of blur would correspond to the final column of flanker distances. For example,\nwith too much blur (resulting when the camera aperture is larger than the eye's pupil), DOF blur would\ndefine a flanker distance of 78 cm, whereas the disparity of the flankers still indicates a distance of 60\ncm based on the eyes' convergence angle and the accommodation distance to the screen. There thus\nexists a cue conflict between disparity-defined depth (60 cm) and DOF-blur-defined depth (78 cm)\ngiven the convergence angle and accommodative state of the eye.\nIn Experiment 1, stimuli were displayed with consistent accommodation\u00adconvergence cues. The\nstimuli were made with the cameras converged at the central object. In Experiment 2, stimuli with\nconflicting accommodation\u00adconvergence cues were created by taking photographs of the objects with\nthe cameras focussed at the distance of the central object, but converged at the distance of the two\nflankers instead of at the central object. This gave the central fixation point a disparity relative to the\nscreen, such that it moved forward in depth from the screen. The flankers would therefore be presented\nat zero disparity (screen distance), but be blurred as a result of DOF blur effects. In both experi-\nments, images were captured with converged cameras. Since the monitors in our stereoscope were not\nTable 1. Table of DOF blur calculations. The first column is the distance from the observer to the flankers. The\nsecond column shows the diameter of the blur circle for this distance, assuming the optics of the eye (given a hu-\nman 4.5-mm pupil), when the observer is focussed on the fixation point. (Optics are strictly geometrical and do\nnot take account of aberrations.) The fixation point is at 53-cm distance from the observer. The third column lists\nthe aperture sizes (f-stops) that were used to make the differing levels of DOF blur. The level of blur in the resulting\nphotograph from this aperture and distance combination is given in the fourth column. The corresponding dis-\ntances that the flankers would have in order to result in this level of blur with human optics is in the final column.\nFlanker distance\n(cm)\nEye (theoretical) blur\ncircle (arcmin) F-stop\nCamera (actual) blur\ncircle (arcmin)\nCorresponding flanker\ndistance (cm)\n162 O'Hare L, Zhang T, Nefs H T, Hibbard P B\ngaze-normal, this would have created an additional conflicting distance cue from vertical disparity;\nthese are discussed in the context of 3D cinema by Banks, Read, Allison, and Watt (2012). The effect\nof this conflict is expected to be relatively minor in our images, because the flanking objects were rela-\ntively close to the centre of the image, being positioned 5\u00b0 either side of the central object (Bradshaw,\nGlennerster, & Rogers, 1996). While this is another factor that could contribute to discomfort, it was\nconstant across our experimental manipulations.\nAlthough there is evidence that observers look at sharper areas in photographs rather than blurred\nones (Enns & MacDonald, 2012), it was important to the experiment that observers fixate the central\nobject. To encourage this, small red square dots were added on the central fixation object, and observ-\ners were asked to count the number of dots. A random number of dots between 9 and 21 were gener-\npresented within a circular region with a radius of 150 pixels (4\u00b0) across on the central focal object. In\nboth experiments, these red dots were given a disparity to match that of the central fixation object. In\nExperiment 1, the dots were thus all at zero disparity. In Experiment 2, dots were given a disparity to\ndistance in depth. This resulted in an accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict of either 0.22D, 0.46D, or\n0.64D. They thus appeared to be at the distance of the target object. Because some of the objects were\ncurved, this could not be set to be the same for all images, which resulted in slight variations between\nthe images: the mean of these fluctuations was 0.01\u00b0 (SD  0.01\u00b0). In the largest case, when the dis-\nparity was needed to simulate a depth of 80 cm, these slight fluctuations resulted in a mean simulated\ndepth of 79.8 cm with a standard deviation of 0.2 cm.\nObservers\nTwenty-two nave observers (mean age 5 22.7 years, SD 5 3.7), with normal or corrected-to-normal\nvisual acuity, participated in the study. We confirmed that all observers whose data are reported in the\ncurrent paper had at least normal stereo acuity according to the TNO (Netherlands Organisation for\nApplied Scientific Research) stereo test (Lam\u00e9ris Ootech B.V.). Four observers failed the TNO test,\nand their data were excluded from analysis. The experiments were approved by the University of St\nAndrews ethics committee.\nProcedure\nObservers were seated in a dark room in front of a mirror stereoscope. A white fixation cross against\na mid-grey background preceded each trial. Observers were asked to fixate the cross. The observer\ninitiated the first trial by pressing the \"ENTER\" key on the computer keyboard. The stimulus was then\npresented for 5 seconds followed again by the fixation cross. Dots were added to the central object in\nthe photographs, the number of which varied randomly between trials, from 9 to 21. The observers\nwere asked to count these dots. The counting task was used to encourage observers to fixate the focal\nobject, facilitate concentration, and, as the presentation was fairly long, allow for the build up of some\nvisual discomfort. The next trial was started after the observer entered their response.\nEach of the two experiments was conducted in three blocks of trials. Each block contained only\none f-stop, but a mixture of different scenes and flanker distances. Observers were presented with\nthe three repetitions of the nine possible scenes at the three distances in random order within a block.\nObservers completed the blocks in different orders to counterbalance any practice effects. Trials within\na block were randomised anew for each block and for each observer.\nAt the end of each block, each observer completed a short questionnaire based on the work of\nHoffman et al. (2008). Observers rated visual discomfort, dryness of eyes, headache, eyestrain, distor-\ntion, and clarity of vision on a 10-point scale. The dry eyes question was not included in the original\nHoffman et al. (2008) questionnaire. It was added as a control question because there is research to\nindicate that this is a separate cause of visual discomfort (Sheedy et al., 2003), so is not expected to\nvary with the experimental manipulations. The question on distortion was also not originally included\nin the Hoffman et al. (2008) questionnaire. This question was included because observers might have\nnoticed that the level of blur was incorrect for the depths defined by disparity. The discomfort question\nwas calibrated by asking observers to compare a score of 10 to staring at a bright light, for example\nsee Table 2. Additional explanation was given to the distortion question as well. This was to give the\nparticipants some indication of what was meant by these terms, and also to allow them to gauge their\njudgements against something tangible. At the end of each experiment, there was a questionnaire of\nVisual discomfort and depth-of-field 163\nfree responses relating to all three blocks. Following Hoffman et al. (2008), we asked observers four\nfinal questions, see Table 2.\nAnalysis\nOne observer's dot counting data were lost due to a technical error during the experiment, although\nthe participant had completed the written discomfort ratings. Initially, all data regarding subjective\nratings were analysed together. A second analysis was performed in which those who reported no\ndiscomfort were excluded. No discomfort was defined as those who did not report any score higher\nthan three on the 10-point scale. This resulted in 13 observers to be included in the analysis. The mean\nrating of these 13 participants' overall judgements was 3.56, with a standard deviation of 2.00. These\nresults were then normalised by converting individual scores into z scores for each observer in order\nto remove large effects of individual differences in scoring behaviour. Results from the dot counting\ntask were analysed by calculating the unsigned difference between the estimated and actual number\nof dots. The average of this was taken to obtain a measure of accuracy at the task. Post hoc power\nanalyses were conducted using the program \"G*Power\" (Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, & Lang, 2009;\nFaul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007).\nVisual discomfort\nFigure 5 shows the mean scores across all 18 participants for the six questions as a function of decreas-\ning DOF blur for photographs without an accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict (Experiment 1) and\nwith an accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict (Experiment 2).

We tested whether conflict arising from inappropriate cues\nfrom DOF blur (either too much or too little, given human optics) would have caused an increase in\nvisual discomfort judgements. However, no effects of changing DOF blur on discomfort judgements\nwere found. There was also no main effect of DOF on accuracy in the dot-counting task. The DOF\nblur added to our stimuli does not affect the accommodation response (Day et al., 2009), and here we\nfind that it does not create discomfort. This suggests that accommodation, rather than blur per se, is\nthe critical factor when discomfort arises from image blur.\nIn Experiment 2, we investigated the effects of DOF blur on existing accommodation\u00adconver-\ngence conflicts. Again, there was no effect of DOF blur on discomfort judgements in presentations\ncontaining an accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict. This conflict was either 0.22D, 0.46D, or 0.64D.\nWe did not investigate the accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict itself, as this is already well docu-\nmented (e.g. Shibata et al., 2011b), and we wished to avoid a large accommodation\u00adconvergence\nVisual discomfort and depth-of-field 167\nconflict masking any potential DOF blur effects. Therefore, the accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict\nsizes used in the present study were around the limits of Percival's zone of comfort (Percival, 1892), a\nset of values beyond which the levels of the accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict that cause discom-\nfort (and later diplopia). The maximum level of conflict suggested by the guidelines for stereoscopic\nested in the accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict, they deliberately set up conflicts much larger than\nthis \"rule of thumb\" based on Percival's zone of comfort, up to 1.2D. As the object of the present\nstudy was to investigate DOF effects on discomfort, we created a situation with very large DOF blur\nconflicts of around 1.54D. For example, in one of the experiments, the level of blur was such that the\nflanking stimuli would have to be at a depth of 8 m, while disparity defined a distance of 60 cm from\nthe observer to the flanker. However, even this very large DOF conflict did not increase discomfort\njudgements. Our methodology was similar to that used by Hoffman et al. (2008) and Shibata et al.\n(2011b), who found effects of the accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict in stereoscopic displays. If\nwe assume similar sensitivity in our methods and take account of the fact that the number of observers\n(11 and 23 respectively) used in these studies is similar to ours (18), it would appear that the effect of\nDOF blur is smaller than that of the accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict. We find no evidence that\nour relatively large cue conflicts cause discomfort. We cannot rule out the possibility that DOF blur\nmight contribute to discomfort in other circumstances. However, we have explored a broad range of\ncamera apertures, and provide no evidence to suggest that a change in DOF causes any discomfort.\nThe accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict might cause discomfort through a sensory discrepancy\nbetween the conflicting stimuli or by an attempt to make two different motor responses. The lack of\nan effect of DOF, despite the large conflict sizes, suggests that the sensory discrepancies alone are not\nthe cause of discomfort in conflict situations. As DOF blur does not affect motor responses (Day et al.,\n2009), this suggests that conflicting motor responses, rather than conflicting sensory cues, are the root\nof the discomfort in the case of an accommodation\u00adconvergence conflict.\nIn summary, there were no significant effects of DOF blur on subjective ratings of discomfort and\ndistortions in stereoscopic photographs. It has been shown that DOF blur affects perceived distance\nblur can be used to supplement perceived depth from disparity, with the result that smaller disparities\nare needed to create the same impression of depth (Wang, Barkowsky, Ricordel, & LeCallet, 2011).\nAs a result, Wang et al. (2011) suggested that one method of limiting the existing accommodation\u00ad\nconvergence conflict usually present in stereoscopic displays is to reduce the disparity, while DOF\nblur is increased to create the same percept of depth. This suggestion would only be useful if DOF\nblur gradients do not cause discomfort themselves. The results of the current study demonstrate that\nDOF blur does not cause discomfort, even when large conflicts are present. Therefore, future research\nmight be aimed at investigating the use of DOF blur, in order to limit the discomfort, but still retain the\nperception of depth, when using stereoscopic displays.\n"
