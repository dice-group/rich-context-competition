Furthermore, thigh circumference\nwas not measured so that only waist-to-hip but not\nwaist-to-thigh ratio was examined. Published studies\nof indices of body fat distribution and HDL choles-\nterol in children have been mostly in small samples of\nobese children. While generally showing some sig-\nni\u00aecant associations, they yielded con\u00aficting results\nregarding variation of the association by age, gender,\nethnicity and sexual maturity.7,8 Since adverse pat-\nterns of blood lipids and atherosclerosis itself begin in\nchildhood, studies of population and individual differ-\nences in the early onset and progression through\nadolescence of risk factors are important.9 Tracking\nof blood lipids, obesity, and body fat distribution over\nto test the hypothesis that circumference and skinfold\nindices of body fat distribution are signi\u00aecantly asso-\nciated with HDL cholesterol and the ratio of total\nserum cholesterol to HDL cholesterol independent of\noverall fatness, gender, ethnicity, age or maturity\nlevel, data from the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination   (NHANES III) were\nexamined.\n*Correspondence: Dr RF Gillum, Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, National Center for Health Statistics, 6525 Belcrest\nhttp://www.stockton-press.co.uk/ijo\nMethods\nThe Third  \non a nationwide multi-stage probability sample of\napproximately 40 000 people from the civilian, non-\ninstitutionalized population aged two months and over\nof the United States excluding reservation lands of\nThe descriptive analyses of body fat distribution in\nthis report are restricted to 7 987 children and young\nadults aged 4 \u00b1 19 y examined with valid circumfer-\nence measurements in the survey.

Examinations were carried\nout in a mobile examination center. For children aged\n8 \u00b1 18 y, the physician assessed sexual development\nby inspection as follows: pubic hair (male and\nfemale), genitalia (male), breast (grade of least devel-\noped breast, female).

Samples\nples were frozen at 7 20C and shipped on dry ice to\nthe Johns Hopkins University Lipoprotein Analytic\nLaboratory, Baltimore, Maryland. Serum total choles-\nterol (TC) determinations were measured enzymati-\ncally and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL) was measured in serum following the precipi-\ntation of other lipoproteins with a polyanionadivalent\ncation mixture (Hitachi 704 AnalyzeraBoehringer-\nMannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).15 \u00b1 17\nSerum cholesterol concentration is 3 \u00b1 5% higher\nthan in EDTA plasma, but no signi\u00aecant serum-\nplasma difference was observed for HDL cholesterol.\nThe ratio of TCaHDL was computed.

Thigh circumference was\nmeasured at midthigh in a plane perpendicular to the\nlong axis of the thigh. The following were computed:\nwaist-to-hip circumference ratio (WHR), waist-to-\nthigh circumference ratio (WTR), ratio of subscapular\nto triceps skinfold thickness (SFR), central-peripheral\nskinfold ratio (CPR  (subscapular skinfold  sup-\nrailiac skinfold)a(triceps skinfold  thigh skinfold);\nsum of the four skinfolds (SSF); and body mass\nindex (BMI  weightaheight2, kgam2).

Linear multivariate regression analysis was used\nto develop models for predicting HDL for each age,\nsex, ethnicity group.21 Only variables with prespeci-\n\u00aeed hypotheses were entered into the regression\nmodels. Following these preliminary analyses, \u00aend-\nings of the unweighted analyses were con\u00aermed using\ntechniques that incorporated sampling weights and\ndesign features of the survey.23 Population estimates\nfor means and percentiles of WHR were produced\nusing SUDAAN procedures.24 Pearson correlations of\nHDL with other variables were con\u00aermed by SAS\nweighted analysis, and statistical testing and variance\nestimation were performed using the PROC\nREGRESS procedure for linear regression models in\nResults\nWHR by age for each sex-ethnic group. Figure 3\nWaist-to-hip ratio at ages 4\u00b119 years\nRF Gillum\nshows mean WHR. Mean and median WHR declined\nslight additional changes at 16 \u00b1 19 y. At each age\nafter 4 \u00b1 5 y, WHR was higher in boys than girls.

For\nexample, at 6 \u00b1 11 y, means were Mexican Americans\nyoung women, mean WHR was slightly higher in\nMexican Americans than in other groups. The dis-\ntribution became increasingly skewed toward higher\nvalues in adolescents, particularly at 16 \u00b1 19 y in\nnon-Hispanic whites, 0.93 in non-Hispanic blacks,\nand 0.95 in Mexican Americans.\nDescriptive analyses of WTR revealed variation\nwith age, sex, and ethnicity similar to that described\nFigure 1 Selected percentiles of waist-to-hip circumference\nratio in boys and young men aged 4 \u00b1 19 y in the Third National\nHispanic white children, (b) non-Hispanic black children, (c)\nMexican American children.\nFigure 2 Selected percentiles of waist-to-hip circumference\nratio in girls and young women aged 4 \u00b1 19 y in the Third\n(a) Non-Hispanic white children, (b) non-Hispanic black children,\n(c) Mexican American children.\nWaist-to-hip ratio at ages 4\u00b119 years\nRF Gillum\nfor WHR.

No signi\u00aecant\ninteractions of WHR with Tanner stage were seen.\nDiscussion\nWHR, WTR, SFR and CPR showed consistent nega-\ntive associations with HDL cholesterol levels across\nage, gender, and ethnic subgroups in a national sample\nof children and young adults aged 4 \u00b1 19 y. These\nassociations were independent of age. When BMI\nwas controlled for, WHR remained signi\u00aecantly asso-\nciated with HDL in most female subgroups.\nMechanisms\nHigh density lipoprotein is secreted by the liver and\nsmall intestine as nascent particles which accept\ncholesterol from peripheral catabolism of chylomi-\ncrons and VLDL and from tissues.25 The cholesterol is\nreturned to the liver (reverse cholesterol transport). Its\nmajor protein is apoA-1. Blood HDL cholesterol level\nhas been shown to be inversely related to the risk of\ncoronary heart disease and stroke.26,27 The mechanism\nis postulated to be reverse transport of cholesterol\nfrom arteries to the liver, this inhibiting the promotion\nof atherosclerosis. It may play an important role in the\ninitiation of early atherosclerosis in children and\nadolescents. Levels of HDL have been noted to\ndecline during adolescence in males, especially in\nwhites.28 After early childhood, levels become\nhigher in females than males and in blacks than\nwhites.\nObesity and central or abdominal fat distribution\nhave been associated with decreased levels of HDL in\nmany studies of adults, and in studies of adoles-\ncents.7,8 In adults, abdominal obesity with increased\nvisceral fat is associated with increased levels of\ncirculating fatty acids, insulin and insulin resistance,\nwhich lead to increased synthesis of triglycerides and\nvery-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion by the\nliver. VLDL are negatively associated with HDL.\nAlthough WHR does not accurately re\u00afect intra-\nabdominal fat mass in children,29 \u00b1 31, SFR and CPR\nsurely re\u00afect distribution of subcutaneous fat, which\nis also related to cardiovascular disease occurrence in\nadults.32 \u00b1 34 In a study using computed tomography,\nsubcutaneous abdominal fat was at least as strong a\ncorrelate of insulin sensitivity as visceral fat, and\nretained signi\u00aecance after controlling for visceral\nfat.35 Furthermore an android pattern of skinfold\nthicknesses was associated with greater absolute and\nproportional amounts of visceral adipose tissue than a\ngynoid pattern.31 Use of dual-energy X-ray absorptio-\nmetry for accurate body fat measurement and assess-\nment of regional fat distribution in children might\nresolve some of these problems in future studies.36\nVisceral abdominal fat measured by MRI was strongly\ncorrelated with HDL cholesterol in 14 obese\nobese girls, subcutaneous abdominal fat and WHR\nwere not signi\u00aecantly correlated with HDL choles-\nabdominal subcutaneous fat was correlated with insu-\nlin concentration, lending some support to the use of\nSFR. Body fat distribution is consistently related to\nboth WHR and BMI may be correlated with TC but\nnot HDL, for example in white males and Mexican\nFigure 3 Mean waist-to-hip circumference ratio in children and\nyoung adults aged 4 \u00b1 19 y in the Third National Health and\nWF, white females; BM, black males; BF, black females; MM,\nMexican American males; MF, Mexican American females.\nWaist-to-hip ratio at ages 4\u00b119 years\nRF Gillum\nfemales. Several studies have suggested that only\noverall fatness but not body fat distribution is an\nimportant correlate of HDL prior to puberty. There-\nfore, it has been hypothesized that body fat distribu-\ntion becomes an important correlate of blood lipids\nonly after sexual maturity, while overall obesity may\nbe more important earlier.6 However NHANES III\ndata suggest an independent association of WHR with\nHDL also in prepubertal girls aged 6 \u00b1 11 y, and even\nat 4 \u00b1 5 y in non-Hispanic white girls.\nComparisons with previous reports\nFew previous reports assessed the association of WHR\nand with HDL cholesterol levels in samples of young\nsentative population samples. An association of WHR\nwith HDL cholesterol independent of overall obesity\ncould not be demonstrated in these small, highly\ndren, WHR was correlated with HDLaTC (but not\nHDL cholesterol) only in girls; controlling for overall\nfatness rendered the correlation nonsigni\u00aecant.38 In 74\ngrossly obese Austrian adolescents aged 10 \u00b1 15 y,\nWHR was signi\u00aecantly correlated with HDL only in\nboys controlling for age and in neither controlling for\nage and BMI.40 In further analyses, HDL-2 was\ncorrelated with WHR in both genders and increased\nin graded fashion across WHR tertiles.41 In obese\nJapanese children aged 6 \u00b1 12 y, WHR and WTR and\noverall obesity were correlated with HDL cholesterol\nin boys but not in girls.8 In 57 mostly obese black\nchildren aged 7 \u00b1 11 y, WHR was not associated with a\ncalculated atherogenic index.42 In a US sample aged\n6 \u00b1 18 y selected on the basis of VLDL and LDL\ncholesterol levels, HDL seemed more closely related\nto waist circumference than femoral skinfold.7 SFR\nwas not related to HDL in 214 US white adolescents,\nbut in a small group followed 5 y, change in HDL was\nrelated to the centripetal change in SFR which\noccurred in boys only.38 Therefore studies, mostly in\nobese subjects, reported signi\u00aecant correlations of\nWHR or SFR with HDL, but there was disagreement\nas to how these associations varied by sex, and ethnic\ngroup and as to the degree of independence from\noverall body fatness. The effect of WHR or SFR in\nprevious studies was observed chie\u00afy during and after\npuberty. NHANES III data are consistent with nega-\ntive associations of abdominal or central obesity and\nHDL found during and after puberty but also suggest\nindependent negative associations of body fat distri-\nbution in prebubertal girls.\nLimitations\nLimitations of this present study include possible bias\narising from survey nonresponse and from missing\nvalues for some variables. Several special studies of\nearlier HANES data have indicated little bias due to\nnonresponse.23 Adequate reliability has been demon-\nstrated for HDL cholesterol.15 However the lack of a\nsingle, generally accepted measurement protocol for\nbody circumference remains a problem for interstudy\ncomparisons, perhaps explaining in part inconsisten-\ncies among studies. Confounding by variables not\ncontrolled for cannot be excluded. No adequate data\non physical activity were available in NHANES III\nchildren. The large sample size in NHANES III\nprovided good statistical power. Exact P values are\ngiven; furthermore the number of tests was restricted\nto those of regression models. Interactions described\nabove make interpretation of regression models for\nsome subgroups problematic. The representativeness\nof the sample and the use of sample weights provides\nwide generalizability of the results to United States\nnon-Hispanic black and white and Mexican American\nchildren and young adults of the same ages.\nConclusions\nFuture research should include longitudinal studies of\nbody fat distribution and HDL in non-Hispanic white\nand black and Hispanic children followed to adult-\nhood. Body fat distribution and HDL in childhood and\nadolescence should be assessed as a risk factor for\nfuture noninvasively measured atherosclerosis, for\nexample, carotid intima-medial thickness, and the\nmechanisms of such an association evaluated.\n"
