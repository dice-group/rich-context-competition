You know a myriad of\nindividuals whom you could match. You have family members and non-family members;\nyou have those who are similar in age as you and those who are not; and you have the\nchoice between male and female relatives. How then do you decide who to help and who\nnot to help?\nEvolutionary matchmaking\nHelping behavior has been an area of major theoretical discussions in evolutionary\nbiology (Brown and Pimm, 1985) and social psychology (Berscheid and Reis, 1998). One\ntheory that has emerged to explain helping behavior is inclusive fitness theory or kin-\nstudy we will specifically be addressing willingness to help not altruism. While both are\nsimilar phenomenon they are not identical. Altruism is defined in terms of fitness and\nrequires a cost to the altruist, whereas helping behavior deals with observable features and\ntypically does not address fitness (Brown and Pimm, 1985). While altruism and helping\nbehavior are hallmarks of evolutionary psychology so is mating research. To date few\nresearchers have attempted to link these two.\nInclusive fitness as a theory of helping behavior\nInclusive fitness theory predicts, and numerous authors have found, that closer\ngenetic relatedness increases willingness to help (Burnstein, Crandall, and Kitayama, 1994;\nStewart-Williams, 2007) and helping (Essock-Vitale and McGuire, 1985; Korchmaros and\nKenny, 2006). By helping those relatives who are genetically close to them, individuals\nincrease their fitness both in terms of survival but also in terms of reproduction (Rushton,\nRussell, and Wells, 1984). For instance, a grandparent is likely to share genes with her/his\ngrandchild and is thus more likely to help the grandchild to increase her/his own inclusive\nfitness (Mace and Sear, 2005). This is especially the case for maternal grandmothers\nhelping granddaughters as compared to grandmothers helping grandsons or grandfathers\nhelping grandchildren (Euler and Weitzel, 1996; Michalski and Shackelford, 2005). It is\nassumed that people are not consciously aware of mechanisms of inclusive fitness. Genes\n\"encourage\" their hosts to make copies of themselves via reproduction and helping those\nwho share other copies of those genes (Dawkins, 1976).\nMost evolutionary research has supported an inclusive fitness approach to helping\nbehavior. Research on resource allocation within families has found that people share more\nof their wealth with closer genetic relatives than more distant genetic relatives or non-kin\nusing both probated wills (Judge and Hrdy, 1992; Smith, Kish, and Crawford, 1987;\nWebster, Bryan, Crawford, McCarthy, and Cohen, in press) and classroom experiments\n(Webster, 2003, 2004). Other research has found that in emergency situations individuals\nact more nepostically than in less dire situations (Shavit, Fischer, and Koresh, 1994). Other\nevidence shows that individuals are more likely to help kin with poor health over nonkin\n(Burnstein, Crandall, and Kitayama, 1994).\nLittle research, however, has been done on helping others find mates. In terms of\naiding conspecifics in their mating success, research has addressed how humans are\ncooperative breeders. Cooperative breeding refers to the tendency to help others rear\noffspring (Mace and Sear, 2005). Whereas cooperative breeding appears to be referring to\nhelping others breed, it is more accurately described as alloparenting or cooperative\nparenting. In fact, when dealing with actual mating, researchers have focused on the\nsuppression of reproduction of daughters by mothers (Voland, 1998, for a review of parent-\noffspring conflict see Trivers, 1974) not on reproduction itself. Voland (1998) noted that\nhuman strategies, including helping, depend on different circumstances or domains. One of\nthese domains is helping others find long-term mates and short-term mates (LTMs and\nSTMs, respectively; see Li and Kenrick, 2006, for a review). Unlike cooperative breeding\nand reproductive suppression, helping others find LTMs and STMs has been rarely\nEvolutionary matchmaking\naddressed. Helping others find LTMs and STMs likely entails acts such as formally setting\nindividuals up on dates but also initiating more impromptu introductions.\nWhen the costs are high, individuals tend to favor kin over nonkin; when costs are\nlow the individuals may help nonkin more (Burnstein, Crandall, and Kitayama, 1994;\nShavit, Fischer, and Koresh, 1994; Stewart-Williams, 2007). The pattern of helping\naccording to evolutionary psychologists is that when there is high risk involved in a given\ncourse of action individuals act more nepostically; act more in favor of their own genes\nover the genes of others. Thus the question of helping others relates to the balancing of\ncosts and benefits of that act of helping.\nWhen helping others find mates, individuals are investing effort and potentially\nlosing their own reproductive opportunities to help kin and nonkin find mates, which are\nexamples of costs involved in helping others (Stewart-Williams, 2007). The benefit of\nhelping others to find long-term mates is that pairbond formation increases group cohesion\nand decreases intragroup sexual conflict. As such, we predict that individuals should be\nmore willing to help others find LTMs over STMs.\nHowever, an added benefit may exist for helping kin over nonkin because the\narranger may also reproductively benefit from the act of helping. This is similar to the\nsexy-sons hypothesis (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000) in that when a mother helps her son\nmate, by increasing his level of attractiveness, she also reproductively benefits. In fact,\nsimilar sentiments have been expressed by Ackerman, Kenrick, and Schaller (2007), when\nthey stated that interactions among kin and nonkin had different functional consequences.\nThose differences lie in the lack of shared genetic material among friends, thus helping\namong them is not about genes but about ingroup functions. While short-term mating\nopportunities may increase reproductive success it comes with the cost of decreased social\nreputation. Individuals are more likely to adopt the sexual double standard for relatives\nover non-relatives (Sprecher, 1989), suggesting that individuals are attuned to the sexual\nacts of their kin and may actually be concerned more with the sexual acts of kin over\nnonkin. All in all, arranging long-term relationships is more beneficial to the arranger than\narranging short-term relationship because the formation of bonds and probably the sharing\nof responsibilities in child rearing lead to higher levels of reproductive success. Thus, we\npredict that individuals will be more willing to help kin find LTMs over STMs.\nReciprocal altruism as a theory of helping behavior\nA second and related theory of helping behavior is reciprocal altruism (Trivers,\n1971, 1985). From an evolutionary perspective, reciprocal altruism may help explain why\npeople help nonkin in addition to kin (Fehr and Henrich, 2003; Gintis, 2000; Richerson,\nBoyd, and Henrich, 2003). Over evolutionary time, natural selection may have favored\naltruistic acts directed towards nonkin so long as such acts were likely to be reciprocated in\nthe future (Brown and Brown, 2006; Stewart-Williams, 2007). This theory rests on the\nassumption that there is a system of mutual social contracts between individuals. Social\ncontracts facilitate helping behavior because they can promote feelings of indebtedness\namong those who have been helped; indebtedness in turn facilitates the return of the favor.\nReciprocity and equity are important in friendships, both of which can create a system of\nIf a reciprocal altruism model of helping behavior explains why individuals help\nothers find LTMs and STMs, then one would expect that individuals should be more\nEvolutionary matchmaking\nwilling to help those of a similar age-cohort than those of a different age-cohort, because\nthose of the similar age-cohort are best suited to help because they have access to potential\nothers of the same age-cohort to arrange pairings.1 Those who are of different age-cohorts\nare likely to not have access to numerous others to arrange such pairings. Alternatively, it\nmay be that individuals choose friends who are genetically similar (perhaps based on a\ngenetically assortative preference in friends) and thus are more likely to commit altruistic\nacts towards them (Rushton, Russell, and Wells, 1984). However, Maner et al. (2002)\nargued that we are more likely to help strangers who we perceive as genetically close to us:\noften calling these people friends. It may also be that those in an age-cohort may have\ninterdependence, it is meant that individuals are tied together; their reproductive futures are\nlinked. For example, two individuals may benefit reproductively or socially by going out to\na nightclub together as opposed to going solo.\nHelping others of an age-cohort find an LTM or an STM also comes with risks just\nas it does for kin. Costs involved in helping others find a mate can be the loss of mating\nopportunities themselves. By arranging a pairing between two others, the person is\nneglecting their own reproduction and perhaps other more tangential facets of their lives.\nReciprocal altruism would predict that individuals play matchmaker because they are\nhoping, to some degree, that the favor will be reciprocated. In fact, there is some evidence\nthat demonstrates that reciprocity is more likely among friends than kin (Essock-Vitale and\nMcGuire, 1985). We predict that individuals will be more willing to help those of a similar\nage-cohort than those who are of a different age-cohort.\nParental investment as a theory of helping behavior\nLastly, parental investment theory (Trivers, 1972) predicts that, as a result of\ndifferent levels of obligatory investment in a sexual encounter, males and females should\ndiffer in their mating behavior. For instance, since men can invest less in their offspring\nthan women, they are more likely to employ a short-term mating style as compared to\nwomen (Schmitt, Shackelford, and Buss, 2001). The parental investment hypothesis would\npredict that male relatives should be helped more than female relatives to find an STM.\nConversely, parental investment would predict that individuals should be more willing to\nhelp their female relatives find LTMs over male relatives because the reproductive success\nof females is increased more than males by the creation of pairbonds. Individuals may help\nthose who can benefit the most from their help in different mating domains. Males would\nbenefit more than females from help finding an STM, where females would benefit more\nthan males from help finding an LTM. In addition, the social costs of arranging a short-\nterm pairbond for women may be more costly for women than men and thus this pattern\nwould also emerge. We predict that individuals will be more willing to help their male\nrelatives than their female relatives to find STMs. We also predict that individuals will be\nmore willing to help their female relatives than their male relatives to find an LTM.\n1 This is in contrast to common usage of the term matchmaker that evokes images of a well-connected older\nwoman who arranges pairings. While it is true that older people may have played a role in the formation of\nlong-term paribonds, it is the contention of the authors that most of the matchmaking that actually occurs is\namong those of a similar age-cohort because they exist in similar if not the same peer groups.\nEvolutionary matchmaking\nThe current studies\nIronically, little attention has been paid to long-term relationships such as family\nand friends in the context of helping behavior and instead has focused on short-term or\neven non-existent relationships using college-student samples (Daly, Salmon, and Wilson,\n1997). The irony lies in the fact that few studies addressing inclusive fitness have actually\nused pre-existing long-term relationships like kin or friends and instead focus on\nexperimental methodologies to induce or reduce helping. Research on mating and helping\nare hallmarks of evolutionary psychology, yet few have attempted to integrate these\ndomains.\nThe present studies test three evolutionary theories of helping behavior and how\nthey relate to individuals' willingness to help others find both LTMs and STMs: inclusive\nfitness, reciprocal altruism, and parental investment. Individuals may help others who share\ntheir genes (inclusive fitness). Individuals may help those who they feel would be best\nsuited to return the favor (reciprocal altruism). Or individuals may be more inclined to help\nmales find STMs and females find LTMs (parental investment). This study will attempt to\ntest and differentiate between those theories in predicting willingness to help others find\nLTMs and STMs.\nMethod\nSample\nOne hundred eight participants (31% male) participated in this study for extra credit\nin a psychology class. The mean age of the participants was 24 years (SD = 7.15; Range =\nparticipants.\nMeasures\nParticipants were asked how much (1 = not at all; 5 = very much) they were willing\nto help a number of others (sister, brother, father, mother, friend, relative, cousin, parent,\nneighbor, stranger, and acquaintance) find either short-term (casual sex) or long-term mates\n(serious romantic relationship). Helping across each category of mating was calculated by\naveraging all the relationship types (LTM Cronbach's  = .88; STM  = .85).\nTo test for inclusive fitness effects, averaging items into indexes created six scales.\nThe helping of kin was composed of the items for willingness to help all those related to\nthe participant (brother, sister, father, mother, parents, relatives, and cousins) find an LTM\n( = .91) and an STM ( = .88). The willingness to help first-order kin was composed of\nthe items for those who were directly related to the participant (brother, sister, father,\nmother, and parents) find an LTM ( = .87) and an STM ( = .83). The willingness to help\nnonkin was composed of all items for those not related to the participants (friends,\nstrangers, neighbor, and acquaintance) find an LTM ( = .75) and an STM ( = .83). Two\nsingle-item measures were used to measure willingness to help second-order relatives (i.e.,\ncousins).\nTo test for reciprocal altruism effects, averaging items into indexes created four\nscales. The age-cohort group was composed of all of those who were most likely to be of a\nEvolutionary matchmaking\nsimilar age as the participant (friend, brother, sister, cousin, and acquaintance) on\nwillingness to help find an LTM ( = .76) and an STM ( = .82). The non-age-cohort group\n(which is essentially a parent group due to limitations in the different relationship types\nassessed) was created by averaging the items parents, mother, and father together (LTM \nTo test for parental investment effects, averaging items into indexes created four\ngroups. Items for brother and father were averaged to create indexes for willingness to help\na male relative (LTM  = .68; STM  = .71). Items for mother and sister were averaged to\ncreated indexes for willingness to help a female relative (LTM  = .71; STM  = .67).\nProcedure\nParticipants received a packet that contained the materials. Participants first\ncompleted an informed consent form. Participants were instructed to assume the individuals\nwho they will answer questions about are single (not involved in a romantic or sexual\nrelationship). They then completed the items regarding helping others find a long-term\ndating partner. In efforts to reduce any carry-over effects a distractor task that involved the\nparticipant counting backwards in threes from 35 was done next. Then participants\ncompleted the items for willingness to help others find a short-term casual sex partner.\nLastly, they completed a brief demographics questionnaire and were debriefed.\nResults\nThere were no main effects or interactions for sex of participant or dating status\n(single, married, or dating) on the willingness to help anyone find an LTM or an STM.\nYounger participants were less willing to help others find LTMs (r(102) = -.21, p < .05) or\nSTMs (r(102) = -.20, p < .05). Regardless of their relationship, participants were more\n=\n= .81). This relationship generally held across all\nrelationship types as can be seen in Table 1.

Of\nthese three however, the most convincing were the findings that individuals help kin find\nLTMs over nonkin and that an age-cohort effect was associated with reciprocal altruism.\nHowever, the non-age-cohort group was confounded in that it was simply a group of\nparents. Individuals may be unwilling to help or think about their parents becoming\nsexually or romantically involved and this might have affected the results. A further study\nwas conducted next to attempt to address this potential confound.\nSample\nThere were one hundred forty two participants (29% male) in this study who\nreceived extra credit in a psychology class. The sample consisted of single (28%), dating\n(57%), and married (15%) participants. Participants were randomly assigned to an age-\nEvolutionary matchmaking\ncohort (51%) or non-age-cohort (49%) condition. They were also randomly assigned to an\nSTM (47%) or an LTM (53%) willingness to help condition.\nProcedure\nA mixed design was used to assess helping those of the same age-cohort and those\nof a different age-cohort. Participants were instructed to assume the individuals who they\nwill answer questions about are single (not involved in a romantic or sexual relationship).\nParticipants were asked to think of two people (a man and a woman) they knew who were\nnot related to them and who were either no more than five years different than them in age\nor more than 15 years different. They were instructed to write the initials of that person in a\nspace provided to ensure that the participants actually knew someone from both cohorts.\nParticipants were asked 2 questions regarding how much they would help someone, either a\nman or a woman (the order of these items was varied), to find either an STM or an LTM (1\n= not at all; 5 = very much) for another person who was of their age-cohort or someone\nwho was not of their age-cohort. These two questions comprised a within-subject factor,\nwhile STM or LTM, and age-cohort or non-age-cohort were between-subject factors. After\nthese questions, the participants reported demographic information and were debriefed.\nResults\nThere were no order effects for sex of target on willingness to help. Degree of\nwillingness to help for the first person participants thought of was correlated with the\nsecond person they thought of (r(142) = .50, p < .01). There were no main effects for dating\nstatus (single, married, or dating) on willingness to help. There were no sex differences,\nthough male participants were more willing to help others find mates overall. There was no\neffect for helping to find an LTM or an STM, though individuals were more willing to help\nothers find an LTM over an STM.\nThere was an effect for the age-cohort condition. Individuals were more willing to\nhelp their age-cohort (M = 2.70; SD = 1.37) target to find a mate than a non-age-cohort (M\ncohort prediction for reciprocal altruism.\nGeneral Discussion\nTo date few researchers have attempted to integrate the domains of helping and\nmating from an evolutionary perspective. In an attempt to do this, these studies were\ndesigned to test three possible explanations of why individuals help others find short- and\nlong-term mates. First, supporting inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964), we found that\nindividuals were more willing to help their kin, and especially first-order kin, to find an\nLTM. Second, supporting the theory of reciprocal altruism (Trivers, 1971, 1985), we found\nthat individuals were more willing to help those who were proximally available and likely\nto reciprocate regardless of kinship. In this case, individuals were most willing to help\nthose of a similar age-cohort. Third, supporting parental investment theory (Trivers, 1972),\nwe found that individuals were more willing to help male relatives find an STM and\nfemales to find an LTM. Thus, all three hypotheses were partially supported.\nEvolutionary matchmaking\nInclusive fitness theory did not appear to apply to individuals' willingness to help\nothers find STMs. Participants were rather unwilling to help their first-order relatives find\nSTMs. Reciprocal altruism (Trivers, 1971, 1985) appears to be the more useful theory to\nexplain whom individuals help find STMs. Comparisons of age-groups reveal that it is not\nfamily members that individuals are willing to help find STMs, but rather those of a similar\nage group. Those of a similar age-cohort are best suited to be able to reciprocate such an\nact. Same-age cohorts have the most access to same-aged others to arrange such pairings. It\nmay also be that peers are in some way fitness interdependent (Brown and Brown, 2006),\nsuch that the reproductive success of individuals may be dependent, in part, on the\ncomposition of their peer groups. This theory predicts, and the data doubly confirms, that\nindividuals should be more willing to help those who are well suited to reciprocate the\nfavor of arranging a pairing. However, since all the relations used in Study 1, except\nstranger and acquaintance, denotes some level of familiarity, this familiarity may be in\nsome way responsible for the general support from all the predictions being tested.\nAlthough Figure 1 may suggest that individuals do not want to think about their\nclose kin having sex, individuals were generally less willing to help anyone find an STM\nthan an LTM. In fact, people were generally reluctant to help anyone, as can be seen in the\nmeans in Table 1, which show that individuals were not particularly willing to help their\nfirst-order relatives find an STM. However, this may not be the result of participant's being\nless willing to think about their first-order relatives having sex because they can clearly\nthink about it in terms of an LTM for first-order relatives. What may actually be happening\nis that forming long-term pairbonds is more beneficial for not only reproduction, but also\nfor forming alliances and maintaining group cohesion for family groups. This may be less\nof a concern for those who are not first-order relatives (see Table 1) because the genetic\ndistance between individuals may relate to social costs. So if I help my brother find a short-\nterm mate it may damage my social standing because he is my brother, whereas my genetic\ndistance from a friend lessens the impact of a social faux pa. The STM behavior of my\nbrother may be perceived as a reflection on myself. Thus, it may be more important to find\na first-order relative an LTM than an STM as can be seen in the results. Long-term\npairbonds aid in the cohesion of large-scale social groups and thus may be damaged by\nmore transient relationships. It may also be more costly to find first-order relatives an STM\nbecause of the potential dangers of illegitimate children in addition to the decrease of social\nbond strength. These costs may be less of a concern when dealing with cousins and nonkin.\nIt may be that the costs of an act moderate the relationship between relatedness and helping\nDifferent levels of obligatory investment for males and females lead to differences\nin their mating styles. Men tend to be more oriented towards short-term mating than\nwomen (Schmitt, Shackelford, and Buss, 2001). Individuals may be more willing to help\nthose who can benefit the most from certain types of help. Males would be able to benefit\nmost from help finding an STM. Females, on the other hand, would benefit more from help\nfinding an LTM, and thus, individuals may help female relatives more to find LTMs.\nIndividuals were more willing to help male relatives find STMs and females to find LTMs.\nHowever, these results are likely attenuated because the internal consistencies for the scales\nused to test these predictions were around .70. Results from Study 2 suggest that there may\nnot be a preference for helping males or females find LTMs or STMs.\nEvolutionary matchmaking\nOne sex difference emerged from the analyses of the parental investment\npredictions in Study 1. Females were more willing to help their sisters find STMs as\ncompared to males. Although this effect was not the focus of this study, we offer four\nspeculative explanations. First, it may be that brothers do not see their sisters as sexual\nbeings or that they adopt a sexual double standard and thus they do not consider helping\ntheir sisters find STMs. This explanation, however, seems unlikely because male\nparticipants were equally unwilling to help their sisters find LTMs as female participants.\nSecond, females may be involved in the romantic and sexual lives of their sisters more than\nmales; however, no data were able to substantiate this hypothesis. Third, the fact that this\ndifference was detected for female participants, but not males, may be an artifact of\ndifferential statistical power, since female participants outnumbered males by more than 2\nto 1. Fourthly, it may be chance that this difference emerged and is thus not theoretically\ninteresting.\nAnother interesting finding that emerged in this study, although not predicted, was\nthat younger participants were less willing to help others find mates than older participants.\nIn some ways this appears counterintuitive in that one would expect such sexual behavior\nto be localized in a younger generation where casual sex is likely more common. However,\nit may be that older individuals are more sexually liberal in that they have had more sexual\nexperiences and thus are more accepting of short-term sexual behavior. This acceptance\nmay then lead to a greater willingness to help in this domain. However, this is speculative\nat best and we feel that the weak correlations found may reflect sampling error more than\ngenuine correlations.\nFuture work should address the mediator of emotional closeness. Prior work has\nshown that emotional closeness is part of the psychological mechanisms that generate\nhelping or altruism (Euler and Weitzel, 1996; Korchmaros and Kenny, 2006; Michalski and\nShackelford, 2005). Emotional closeness may mediate the relationships between kinship\nand peer groups to predict willingness to help others find LTMs and STMs. However,\nresults shown in Figure 2 seem to run counter to that argument in that individuals are likely\nemotionally close with their parents whom they were rather unwilling to help find mates.\nThis is an empirical question that deserves further attention, but is beyond the scope of this\nstudy. Relatedly, there may be other mediators that will allow for better tests to\ndifferentiate these three theories in terms of willingness to help find mates that should be\nconsidered in future work. Some examples of other potential mediators are: (1) perception\nof likelihood the help will be returned, (2) familiarity with targets, (3) ease at completing a\nmatchmaking act for a conspecific, and (4) amount the help is needed.\nThere are a number of limitations in this study that are worthy of note. When\naddressing second-order relatives, Study 1 only considered cousins; other second-order\nrelatives, such as grandchildren, were irrelevant to our college sample. Willingness to help\nsecond-order relatives, such as uncles, aunts, nieces, and nephews has been address in the\nFuture work should examine willingness to find mates among these subdivisions of kin to\nperhaps replicate the functions found in work such as Jeon and Buss (2007) that suggest\ncousin-specific adaptations for helping and altruism. Similarly, male and female second-\norder relatives should be considered in future research on helping find a mate as well.\nAckerman, Kenrick and Schaller (2007) argued that females should be more likely to\nEvolutionary matchmaking\nperceive nonkin as kin than men, they may also perceive second-order relatives as\ngenetically closer than men do as well.\nMethodologically, this study used single-item behavioral intention measures to\nmeasure willingness to help. While single-item measures are generally problematic, we feel\nthat the approach that we have taken, using two studies to substantiate our points, mitigates\nconcerns about the limitations of single-item measures. Similarly, we focused on\nbehavioral intentions and not actual helping behavior. Related work (Burnstein, Crandall,\nand Kitayama, 1994) has used behavioral intentions as opposed to actual behaviors. In the\nabsence of behavioral measures, behavioral intention measures are considered to be\nadequate proxies for actual behavior (for review see Ajzen and Fishbein, 1980). While the\nmethods used in this study themselves are based on prior methodologies that have been\nshown successful at predicting behavior and predicting willingness to help, it is worthy of\nnote that these tried and true methods may be inadequate for testing helping behavior in the\ndomain of mating. The domain of mating-help may require new methodologies to\ninvestigate the evolutionary theories addressed here as well as addressing some of the other\npotential explanations and mediators that were discussed above.\nTheoretically speaking, there are other potential interpretations of the data. Our goal\nwas to tests the aforementioned evolutionary theories of willingness to help others find\nSTMs and LTMs. We feel that these theories may be more powerful than non-evolutionary\nmodels of helping behavior in that they are ultimate levels of explanations. While there are\nother social psychological models (for a review see Berscheid and Reis, 1998) of helping\nwe feel they provide more proximate explanation and can be subsumed under different\nevolutionary theories. For instance, there may be differences in how individuals perceive\nthreats across relatedness categories: individuals perceiving the same event more\nthreatening for kin over nonkin. So while perceptions of the threat matter (Buck, 1988), the\nperceptions are themselves colored by relatedness (Shavit, Fischer, and Koresh, 1994).\nIn conclusion, willingness to help others find LTMs and STMs can be explained by\ninclusive fitness, reciprocal altruism, and parental investment. When dealing with long-\nterm mating, inclusive fitness may be the appropriate theory; however, when dealing with\nshort-term mating, reciprocal altruism may be a better theory. This study appears to support\nall three theories. How then can one differentiate which theory was better at explaining\nhelping behavior in reference to mating? In addition to hypothesis tests, which have their\nlimitations (Trafimow, 2003), one can examine effect sizes. The strongest effect sizes can\nbe found in the main effects from the reciprocal altruism tests and the interaction from\ninclusive fitness results.\nWe started this article asking why one might play matchmaker for certain\nindividuals in their life and who those individuals might be. We end by saying that if you\nare looking for help in finding a marital partner; solicit help from your nuclear family. If\nyou want help finding a casual sex partner, solicit help from your friends.\n"
