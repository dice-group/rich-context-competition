The purpose of this analysis was to examine the differential impact of performance-based and self-\nreported lower body measures on 2-year mortality in Mexican American elderly persons.\nMethods. Data employed are from the Hispanic Established Population for Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly, a\nprobability survey of 3050 community-dwelling Mexican Americans aged 65 and older from the five Southwestern\nstates interviewed in 1993 and 1994. Of the baseline sample with complete data, 198 persons were confirmed deceased\n2 years later. A three-task, performance-based, lower body function measure consisting of a short walk, balance, and re-\npeated chair stands tests was used. Self-reported lower body function was measured by a 4-item Activities of Daily Liv-\ning (ADL) measure involving the lower body.\nResults. The three-task, lower body function measure was a significant predictor of 2-year mortality. The short walk\nalone was as predictive as the summary measure. The predictive ability of both measures was minimally reduced by the\ninclusion of the self-reported ADL measure and life-threatening medical conditions. Finally, the ADL measure was not\na significant predictor of mortality with all the other variables in the analysis.\nConclusion. Objective measures of lower body function were significant predicators of mortality in Mexican Ameri-\ncan elderly persons, as found in the general population. Unlike previous studies, the ADL measure was not an indepen-\ndent predictor of mortality after controlling for the objective measure and other risk factors. Additional research is\nneeded to address why objective measures of function are such strong predictors of death.\nT is becoming increasingly clear that poor lower body\nfunction is a major contributor to disability and loss of\nindependence among elderly persons. It has been found to\nbe associated with disability in Activities of Daily Living\n(ADL), both cross-sectionally and prospectively (1\u00ad4), and\nis also a major predictor of self-ratings of health, depressive\nsymptomatology (4), and institutionalization (5).\nDespite its importance as a major predictor of the health\nstatus of older people, few studies have examined the asso-\nciation of lower body function to mortality (6,7). In an anal-\nysis of data from three of the Established Populations for\nEpidemiological Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) studies,\nBrock and colleagues (6) found that self-report measures of\nlower body function were stronger predictors of mortality\nthan were measures of ADLs. Specifically, a portion of the\nRosow-Breslau (8) scale of lower body function (ability to\nwalk a half mile, to walk up and down stairs, and to perform\nheavy housework) was a significantly stronger predictor of\n3-year mortality than was the ADL scale developed by Katz\nand colleagues (9), with Branch's additions (10). The latter\nscale covers bathing, dressing, walking, grooming, transfer-\nring from bed to chair, using the toilet, and eating. Similar\nresults were obtained for both men and women in models\nthat included the measures of function separately as well as\nwhen they were included in the same model. In the latter,\nonly the Rosow-Breslau predicted mortality, while the ADL\nmeasure as well as a measure of function derived from Nagi\nIn a separate analysis of the same three EPESE data sets,\nGuralnik and colleagues (5) examined whether a short per-\nformance-based measure of lower body function predicted\nmortality over an average period of 1.39 years. They also\nexamined whether presence of one or more ADL limitations\nthat require lower body function (walking across a room,\nbathing, transferring from bed to chair, and using the toilet)\npredicted mortality. The performance-based measure was a\nsummary score of three lower body functions: standing bal-\nance, walking speed over an 8-ft distance, and repeated\nchair stands. When performance and self-reported measures\nwere entered in the same equation, both were significant\npredictors of mortality among men. However, only the per-\nformance score predicted mortality among women. Thus, at\nleast among women, this analysis provided evidence that a\nperformance-based measure of physical function was more\npredictive of mortality than was an ADL measure of lower\nbody limitations.\nThe purpose of this analysis was to examine the extent to\nwhich performance-based and ADL measures of lower body\nI\nfunction differentially predict mortality in a unique cohort\nof Mexican American elderly persons. We have previously\nshown (12) that performance-based measures of lower body\nfunction predict the incidence of ADL and mobility-related\ndisability over two years in Mexican American elderly per-\nsons as has been found in the general population (5).\nIn attempting to predict 2-year mortality in Mexican Amer-\nican elderly persons, we hypothesized that performance-\nbased measures of lower body function would be stronger\npredictors of mortality than self-reported lower body func-\ntion. Given what little is known about self-reported physical\nfunction (13\u00ad15) as well as more objective measures of\nphysical function in older Mexican Americans (16), assess-\ning their differential impact on mortality in this population\nshould generate much-needed knowledge. Finally, we went\nbeyond past research to examine the extent to which perfor-\nmance measures of physical function continue to be predic-\ntive of mortality after controlling for the presence of major\nlife-threatening diseases.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData employed are from the Hispanic EPESE. At baseline,\nThe sample was drawn using area probability sampling pro-\ncedures to be representative of the Mexican American elderly\npopulation in five Southwestern states: Texas, New Mexico,\nColorado, Arizona, and California. The sample and its char-\nacteristics have been described elsewhere (17,18).\nThe initial sample was followed up 2 years later in 1995\nremaining subjects, 224 (7.3%) were confirmed deceased\nthrough the National Death Index and reports from rela-\nwere reported to be living in Mexico. The status of 273 (8.9%)\npersons could not be determined (12).\nIn the analysis below we include persons with complete\ndata on the performance measures of physical function and\nother variables of interest at baseline; the subjects were de-\ntermined to be living or deceased at Time 2, two years later.\nMeasures\nOur performance-based measure of lower body function\nwas identical to the one employed by Guralnik and col-\nleagues (5) with other EPESE data sets [see also (19,20)].\nBasically, three separate tasks were assessed, and a com-\nbined score was created to represent lower body function.\nThe tasks were a timed 8-ft walk, timed repeated chair\nstands, and standing balance. The two timed tasks were di-\nvided into quartiles each and scored 1 (slowest) to 4 (fast-\nest). Subjects unable to complete each task were assigned a\nvalue of 0. The standing balance tests included tandem,\nsemitandem, and side-by-side stands. Individuals were scored\n1 to 3, with 3 indicating the highest performance. Those\nunable to perform any of the balance tests were assigned a\nvalue of 0 (12). The three scores were combined to form a\ntotal lower body function score ranging from 0 to 11. The\nscale was further categorized from 0 to 4 to approximate the\ntimed walk categorization (Table 1).\nSelf-reported lower body function was assessed with four\nADLs requiring lower body action: transferring from bed to\nchair, using the toilet, walking across a small room, and\nbathing [same as in (5)]. In the analysis reported below,\nsubjects were considered ADL disabled if they were unable\nto perform any of the four tasks without help.\ngender (male  1), and presence of a number of self-reported\npotentially life-threatening conditions. These were assessed\nby asking respondents if they had ever been told by a doctor\nthat they had any of the following conditions: heart attack,\ncancer, diabetes, hip fracture, stroke, and hypertension.\nAnalysis\nTwo-year mortality was assessed through a series of mul-\ntiple logistic regression models. Two sets of analyses were\nperformed, one involving the combined performance score\nand one involving the short walk. The latter was conducted\nbecause it has been suggested that the short walk is the most\npredictive of the three performance tasks of subsequent dis-\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents the distributions of all variables included\nTable 1.

On the summary\nperformance score, 12.7% were unable to perform any of\nthe three tasks and were assigned a value of 0. Similarly,\n14.8% were unable to perform the short walk. Approxi-\nmately 12.4% were ADL dependent at baseline, and 7.5%\nwere deceased by Time 2.\nAs in previous work (5), scores on the three performance\ntasks were significantly correlated: walk and balance, 0.53;\n(p  .0001 for all three). The internal consistency of the\n3-item scale was 0.75 using Cronbach's alpha. In addition,\nthe ADL item was significantly correlated with each perfor-\n0.41 with chair stands) as well as with the combined per-\nformance score (0.57). These correlations are similar to\nthose previously reported in the literature (22).\nTable 2 presents results of logistic regression analyses\npredicting 2-year mortality using the summary performance\nmeasure of function. Model 1 included as independent vari-\nables the summary performance score of lower body func-\ntion along with age and gender serving as controls. The per-\nformance score was entered as four dummy variables with\nscores 9 to 11 (best function) serving as the reference cate-\ngory. As can be seen, persons in lower categories were all\nsignificantly more likely to experience 2-year mortality.\nMoreover, there appeared to be a linear trend with persons\nin the 0 category (unable to perform any of the tasks) con-\nsiderably more likely to die than persons in the highest cate-\nbody ADL measure along with age and gender. Persons re-\nporting disability in any one of the four ADLs were signifi-\ncantly more likely to die within 2 years than persons report-\nincluded both the summary performance measure and the ADL\nmeasure to examine whether both continue to significantly\npredict mortality. Even though the ORs declined somewhat,\nthe performance measure continued to significantly affect\nmortality, and a linear trend continued to be observed. How-\never, the ADL measure was no longer a significant predictor\nthe clinical utility of the short performance battery of lower\nbody function in predicting mortality in Mexican American\nelderly persons as has been found in the general elderly popu-\nlation (5). At the same time, the self-reported ADL measure\nlost its predictive ability when the performance measure was\nentered into the equation.\nPrevious research linking performance measures of lower\nbody function adverse outcomes including mortality (5,23)\ntypically stops at this stage. We went a step further by re-\npeating our analyses controlling for common life-threaten-\ning conditions (hypertension, heart disease, cancer, diabe-\ntes, hip fracture, and stroke) in model 4. Interestingly, even\nthough the ORs for the performance measure declined some-\nwhat, the general pattern remained the same. As in the pre-\nvious model, the ADL measure was not a significant predic-\ntor of mortality.\nIt has been suggested that the short walk component of\nthe three-task summary measure of lower body function might\nbe as predictive or almost as predictive of subsequent dis-\nability as the summary measure and that it may be more pre-\ndictive than either chair stands or balance (2,12,21). How-\never, the predictive ability of the short walk has not been\ninvestigated with respect to mortality. We examined this re-\nlationship and report the results in Table 3.\nModel 1, which includes only the short walk in addition\nto age and gender, yielded results almost identical to those\nyielded by the summary performance measure (Table 2).\nSignificant ORs were computed for each of the four catego-\ncontained subjects unable to complete the task.\nModel 3 included the addition of the ADL measure. The\nORs were reduced somewhat, but, again, the results were al-\nmost identical to those for the summary measure in Table 2,\nwith the ADL measure being only marginally significant. Fi-\nnally, when the medical conditions were added to the equa-\nTable 2.

Similarly, with the scores on the\nshort walk and medical conditions entered into the equation,\nthe self-reported ADL measure was not a significant predic-\ntor of mortality.\nThus it appears that the short walk is as predictive of 2-year\nmortality as the summary measure. When we repeated the\nanalyses for chair stands and balance (results not shown),\nour findings were considerably weaker and less consistent\nthan those for the summary score or the short walk (results\navailable from the authors).\nDISCUSSION\nAs found in previous research, a simple three-task battery\nof lower body function was a significant predictor of short-\nterm mortality in Mexican American elderly persons. In addi-\ntion, the short walk alone was as predictive as the summary\nmeasure and more predictive than the balance and chair stand\ntasks. The predictive ability of both the summary measure\nand short walk were reduced only minimally by the addition\nof a self-reported lower body ADL measure and by the addi-\ntion of life-threatening medical conditions. Finally, the self-\nreported ADL measure was no longer a significant predictor\nof mortality when the summary performance measure and\nlife-threatening medical conditions were entered into the\nequation, as well as when the short walk and life-threatening\nmedical conditions were entered into the equation.\nOur findings are consistent with previous literature show-\ning that simple physical performance tests of lower body\nfunction are strong predictors of mortality (2,23). It also\nsupports the finding that lower body function may be a bet-\nter predictor of mortality than self-reported ADL function\n(6). Although previous research has found that both perfor-\nmance and ADL measures are significant independent pre-\ndictors of mortality (5,6,23), we found that the predictive\npower of self-reported ADL lower body function becomes\ninsignificant when performance measures and medical con-\nditions are entered into the equation.\nWhy are performance measures so much more predictive\nthan self-report measures in our analysis? Performance\nmeasures are fairly objective indicators of actual ability and\nprobably are an extreme manifestation of the disablement\nprocess (24) when individuals reach the point when they are\nunable to do a task. ADL measures are more subtle, but\nmore complex, and probably reflect individuals' adaptation\nto physical decline. Why ADLs appear to perform less well\nin this sample of Mexican American elderly persons than\npreviously reported with other groups is not clear. Perhaps\nthey are subject to more error in this population, although\nthey correlate at similar levels with performance measures\nas in the general population (22).\nAn important contribution of this study was the continued\nstrong influence of performance measures on mortality even\nafter controlling for life-threatening medical conditions.\nMoreover, their influence on mortality was stronger than\nthat of any disease, including cancer, at least for the extreme\nend of the distribution, which included those unable to per-\nform a task. Clearly, performance measures of function are\nuseful for identifying high-risk persons in the elderly popu-\nlation, which is better than simply relying on disease pro-\nfiles. Identifying high-risk persons using objective standard-\nized tests will assist in providing them with better medical\ncare and preventive interventions.\nAdditional research is needed to help us better understand\nwhy poor physical function is so highly related to death. Ex-\ncept for fatal falls and accidents, poor physical function does\nnot kill people. Obviously, it is a marker for poor health and\nthe adverse consequences of chronic disease. Although the\nassociation between chronic disease and physical function in\nthe elderly is an area of extensive research, our understand-\ning of this relationship remains limited, especially among\nMexican Americans and other minority populations (13).\n"
