These sex differences are the result of the asymmetry in reproductive\ninvestment between the sexes. The production of male gametes is considered to be\nrelatively cheap, and generally males in most non-human animals do not provide parental\ncare. Female investment in reproduction, however, is generally costly because they produce\nlarge, energy rich gametes and often are the sole providers of parental care. Thus, females\ncan increase Darwinian fitness by carefully selecting mates that provide good genes for\ntheir offspring or material benefits such as high quality parental care or resources that can\nSimilarly, in humans, females can enhance their Darwinian fitness by choosing\npartners who offer genetic benefits or resources (Buss, 1998). The assessment of mates in\nlight of genetic quality or resource-holding potential is thus critical and can occur in a\nnumber of contexts in which males must compete on some level (Buss, 1998). Physical\ncompetition through sport is an important and visible way that males compete amongst\neach other. In particular, sport may allow males to demonstrate athletic qualities such as\nspeed and strength (Manning and Taylor, 2001). The importance of sport in terms of mate\ncompetition has been self-reported by males. For example, they believe that traits such as\n\"acquire athletic ability\" and \"use risk in athletics\" are attractive to females and important\nto demonstrate when competing with other males (Walters and Crawford, 1993). Females\nfind males with athletic physiques to be more attractive than males with average physiques\n(Dixon, Halliwell, East, Wignarajah, and Anderson, 2003; Li and Kenrick, 2006; Singh,\n1995), and men have been shown to bias their exercise toward enhancing upper body\ndefinition and gaining muscle mass (Jonason, 2007). Men may focus on enlarging the\nupper body because females prefer males with a more pronounced V-shaped torso\n(Jonason, 2007). In sum, the level of performance that a male attains within a sporting\ncontext may provide an honest signal of his physical condition and ranking among other\nmales with respect to motivation, competitiveness and athletic ability. These signals may\nthus render successful males as more attractive to females.\nIf sport is an appropriate context for assessing male quality, then a number of\nhypotheses can be (and have been) tested. As one example, participants in sport should\nhave more sexual partners than non-participants, and the level of sport performance should\nalso predict the number of sexual partners. Faurie, Pontier, and Raymond (2004) provided a\nquestionnaire to French students who were either registered in sport courses or non-\nsporting courses and these predictions were confirmed. Male students that competed in\nsports self-reported more sexual partners than non-participants, and within athletes, higher\nlevels of performance were positively correlated with the number of partners (Faurie et al.,\nIf females are using participation in sport as a measure of male quality, the ability of\na male to display his quality may be dependent on the type of sport he participates in. For\nexample, male athletes that participate in team sports may be able to display more attractive\nqualities than athletes that participate in sports in which individuals compete against one\nanother. By being part of a team, an athlete may be able to reliably display attractive\nqualities amongst a group of males, a context that is not consistently available to individual\nFemale mate choice and sport\nsport athletes. The team sport context may thus provide females with a greater opportunity\nto assess a particular male's quality by providing a number of potential rivals for\ncomparison. Attractive qualities may include the ability to work with others and role\nacceptance (Li, Kenrick, Bailey, and Linsenmeier, 2002, Minervini and McAndrew, 2006).\nIn addition, qualities associated with physical dominance and prowess may be easier to\ndisplay in a team sport context because athletes must compete for status against their team-\nmates, as well as members of other teams.\nThere are a number of male traits other than sport participation that influence\nfemale mate choice. Both physical attractiveness and status are important factors that have\nbeen found to influence mate preferences (Bereczkei, Voros, Gal, and Bernath, 1997; Li et\nal., 2002; Rhodes, Chan, Zebrowitz, and Simmons, 2003; Rhodes, Simmons, and Peters,\n2005). Females tend to prefer physically attractive males, often for short term relationships,\nand males of high status, often for long-term relationships (Singh, 1995). Both\nattractiveness and status are thus important factors with which to compare the relative\neffects of sport participation on female mate preferences.\nIn the present study, we use a questionnaire with a population of females to test a\nseries of predictions based on the hypothesis that sport participation is used by females to\nassess male quality. We test three main effects, predicting that (a) females will prefer team\nsport athletes over both individual sport athletes and non-athletes, (b) males of high status\nwill be preferred over males of low status, and (c) attractive males will be preferred over\nless attractive males. We also test for interactions among the three main effects, predicting\nthat males participating in team sports, of high status, and physically attractive will be most\npreferred relative to other male types.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nThe participants were 282 female undergraduate students from a central Canadian\nuniversity enrolled in a variety of academic programs in the natural (e.g., biology,\nchemistry; n = 107) and social sciences (e.g., psychology, physical education, arts; n =\n175). The majority of participants were enrolled in their first year of study (n = 169) while\nthe remaining individuals were in their second (n = 45), third (n = 29), and fourth years (n\n= 39). The ages of the participants ranged from 18 to 29 years (Mage\nyears) and 114 participants indicated that they had some previous involvement in a sporting\ncontext. Finally, participants also provided information on their own ethnicity, ethnic\npreferences for mates, sexual orientation, and beliefs/behaviors regarding sexual practices.\nThose described above represent participants who self-categorized as Caucasian, had no\nspecific preference or a preference for a Caucasian mate, were heterosexual, and not\nopposed to sexual intercourse prior to marriage. Participants used in the analysis were\ndrawn from an initial pool of 374 participants.\nDemographic questions\nA series of demographic questions were asked of the participants: age, ethnicity,\nprogram of study, current year of study, sexual orientation, ethnic preferences for mates,\ncurrent and past sport involvement, and relationship history and beliefs. These latter\nquestions assessed, via yes/no response options, whether or not the participants (a) had past\nFemale mate choice and sport\nromantic relationships, (b) have a current romantic relationship, (c) believe in sexual\nintercourse prior to marriage, and (d) are currently sexually active. Finally, participants\nwere asked if they were currently taking oral contraceptives and to provide an estimate of\nwhen they expected their next menstrual period to begin.\nIndependent variables: Stimulus (picture) and description\nEach participant received a picture of one of two possible Caucasian males (either\nhigh or low in attractiveness) and one of six possible descriptions of this individual. To\nassess the physical attractiveness of the two individuals in the pictures, a pilot study was\nconducted with 35 female participants (who did not take part in the main study) similar in\ndemographic characteristics outlined in the Participants section above. The women were\nasked to rate the attractiveness of twelve males based on black and white, non-smiling,\nhead-shot pictures. Attractiveness was assessed on a 7-point Likert-type scale from 1 very\nunattractive to 7 very attractive. The two photos chosen for the main part of the present\nstudy consisted of the individual rated most attractive (M = 5.49, SD = 1.44) and an\nindividual rated low in attractiveness (M = 2.49, SD = 1.04) as determined by this pilot\nstudy. Mean rating differences among the pictures was found to be significant, Wilks'  =\ndifference between the two pictures utilized in the present study (p < .001). Thus, it can be\nreasonably concluded that the two pictures differed in physical attractiveness.\nThe information contained within the description was manipulated to highlight the\ntype of sport involvement of the individual (i.e., 3 levels; team sport vs. individual sport vs.\nno sport involvement) and the degree of status he has obtained in that particular context\n(i.e., 2 levels; high status vs. low status). Specifically, the description read:\nThis is Brian. He is a member of a(n) [either (a) varsity team sport, (b)\nvarsity individual sport, or (c) extra-curricular club that does not involve\nphysical activity and does not play sports]. He is ranked as one of the\n[either (a) more skilled players within his sport/club and is regarded\nhighly, or (b) less skilled players within his sport/club and is not\nregarded highly] by other members. He grew up in [location of study]\nand has a younger sister and an older brother. He loves to eat out and\nwatches television occasionally. He loves dogs.\nIt should be noted that similar procedures and stimulus constructions have been used in past\nresearch (e.g., Townsend and Levy, 1990). As a result of the above process, the main study\ncontained 12 independent conditions through the interaction of physical attractiveness (2\nlevels), sport involvement (3 levels), and status (2 levels).\nDependent variables\nSubsequent to examining the picture and reading the description given to them,\nparticipants responded to four 7-point Likert-type scales from 1 (not willing) to 7 (very\nwilling) assessing their willingness to engage in various levels of relationships with the\ndepicted male. These questions are similar to those used in previous research by Singh\n(1995) and Furnham, Moutafi, and Baguma (2002). Specifically, the participants were\nasked: (a) Please indicate your willingness to go on one date with this person, (b) Please\nindicate your willingness to engage in a short term relationship with this person (less than 1\nmonth), (c) Please indicate your willingness to engage in sexual intercourse with this\nFemale mate choice and sport\nperson, considering a situation where there is no risk of pregnancy or contracting an STD,\nand (d) Please indicate your willingness to engage in a long term/serious committed\nrelationship with this person (more than 6 months).\nProcedure\nEthical approval was obtained through the authors' university research ethics board\nto conduct the study. Subsequent to consent being provided by course instructors,\nparticipants were recruited through their undergraduate classes. At the conclusion of a\nlecture, females were asked to remain seated and the general purpose of the study was\nexplained to them. Participants read a letter of information and completed a consent form if\nthey were interested in taking part. Upon receiving the completed consent form, the\nresearcher gave the questionnaire to the participants consisting of demographic questions, a\npicture and description of a male (see above for details), and the Likert-style questions.\nParticipants were randomly assigned to one of the twelve conditions and were further asked\nto complete the questionnaire individually. The data collection context was monitored by a\nresearcher to ensure that no interaction took place among participants.\nResults\nA 3 (sport involvement) x 2 (status) x 2 (physical attractiveness) between subjects\nmultivariate analysis of covariance was performed on the four dependent variables\nassociated with females' willingness to engage in various levels of relationships with their\ndepicted male: one date, short term, sexual intercourse, and long term. Adjustment was\nmade for three covariates: age, menstrual phase, and previous sport involvement of the\nfemale participants.\nTable1. Means (Standard Deviations) for Females' Willingness to Engage in Various Relationships Based on\nSport Involvement, Status, and Attractiveness.\nNote. Scores for willingness variables range from 1 (not willing) to 7 (very willing).\nThese covariates were chosen based on previous research suggesting that mate\npreferences are potentially influenced by these variables. For example, a study conducted\nby Buunk, Dijkstra, Kenrick, and Warntjes (2001) demonstrated that preferences for mates\nof both males and females are somewhat dependent on age. Specifically, these investigators\nfound that women typically preferred partners who were a similar age to themselves. With\nregard to menstrual phase, for example, Scarbrough and Johnston (2005) noted that women\n\"tested during the high probability of conception phases of their menstrual cycle have been\nSport Involvement Status Attractiveness\nVariable Team Individual Non High Low High Low\nFemale mate choice and sport\nfound to prefer a more masculinized male face than their stated preference outside this\nfertile window\" (p. 511). Finally, there is a large body of literature suggesting that our\nchoices for friends and potential mates are highly influenced by perceived similarities (see\nJones, Pelham, Carvallo, and Mirenberg, 2004). Given the focus of the present study (i.e.,\nmale sport involvement), controlling for previous sport experiences of female participants\nwas imperative.\nFigure 1.

With regard to willingness to go on one date, the\nmean for the team sport condition (M = 4.56 + 1.68) was significantly higher than the\nrelation to individual sport involvement (M = 4.11 + 1.70, p = .06). For willingness to\nengage in a long term relationship, the mean for the team sport condition (M = 3.16 + 1.86)\nwas significantly higher in comparison to both the individual sport (M = 2.64 + 1.67, p =\nMain Effect for Status\nThe multivariate analysis indicated significant main effects for status, Wilks'  =\nengage in the various relationship levels based on high vs. low status.

Univariate analyses revealed that the\nfemales were more willing to engage in all four types of relationships with the high\nattractive male compared with the low attractive male (see Figure 3). Specifically, these\ngroups differed significantly with regard to willingness to go on one date, F(1,267) =\nDiscussion\nThe effect of sport participation on female mate preferences was modest relative to\nboth status and facial attractiveness. Both attractive males and males of high status\n(independent of sport involvement) were significantly more desirable in all social contexts\nconsidered. These results were expected given previous work (Bereczkei et al., 1997; Li et\nwhich to compare the effects of alternative factors influencing female mate preferences.\nOne of these alternative factors appears to be the type of sport a male may participate in.\nGenerally, the effects of sport involvement were significant but much smaller than physical\nattractiveness and status. For example, the effect sizes for physical attractiveness and status\nFemale mate choice and sport\nwere 3-12 times greater than sport involvement. Nonetheless, it is clear that sport\ninvolvement is a significant contributor to female mate choice in this study.\nOverall, sport participation may be an important cue for female mate choice\nbecause males can display qualities such as physical prowess and agility in this context\n(Manning and Taylor, 2001). These qualities can provide insight into male body condition\nand other components of phenotypic quality. More interesting, it was found in the present\nstudy that females preferred males that participate in team sports over those that participate\nin individual sports or non-participants. Two hypotheses can be constructed to explain\nthese apparent preferences. The first argues that team sport athletes exhibit behavioral traits\nassociated with good parenting skills and success at long-term relationships such as\ncooperation, likeability, and role acceptance (Li et al., 2002; Minervini and McAndrew,\n2006). Individuals exhibiting these characteristics would likely be better parents and long-\nterm mates.\nAlternatively, or perhaps concurrently, males may be better able to assert\ndominance in a team sport context because they can assume a high rank within the team as\nwell as in competition with other teams. In others words, a female may be able to better\nassess a male's quality if he participates in a team sport through his relative rank on the\nteam (i.e., is the focus male the captain of the team or a \"benchwarmer\"?). There is\nevidence that (a) females may use a mixed mating strategy when selecting a mate, (b)\ndominance reflects genetic quality, and (c) high quality males are less likely to invest in\noffspring (Havlicek, Roberts, and Flagr, 2005; Wayneforth, 1998). If this is the case,\nfemales may prefer dominant males as short-term partners and prefer males that are more\nwilling/able to invest in offspring as long-term mates. Team sport athletes were most\ndesirable as long-term mates in our study but only marginally more desirable in a \"date\"\nsocial situation, providing some support for the hypothesis that females prefer team sport\nathletes because their behavior may better indicate their abilities in terms of parental\ninvestment.\nIt is possible that females may be more attracted to team sport athletes than\nindividual sport athletes because of the perceived potential financial benefits team sport\nathletes may accrue should they pursue their sport at the highest level. The mainstream\nprofessional sports in North America are typically team sports, and professional athletes\noften earn much higher salaries than the average. However, this perceived scenario seems\nunlikely in the current study because of its context. The present study was conducted at a\nsmall Canadian university where the probability of an individual becoming a professional\nathlete is much less than for athletes in colleges and universities in the United States that\nparticipate in the National Collegiate Athletics Association (i.e., NCAA). Thus, it is\nunlikely that earning potential was a consideration when females assessed the desirability\nof the candidate males in our questionnaire.\nGiven on-going concerns regarding decreasing sport and physical activity rates in\ndeveloped countries, the results of the present study raise interesting questions surrounding\nmotivations for sport participation. For example, do males perceive participation in team\nsports (or sport in general) as a venue for displaying genetic quality? And, are motivations\nfor participation in team sports (or sport in general) driven in part by sexual selection? It is\nperhaps pertinent at this point to indicate that these questions delve into more distal or\nultimate explanations for sport participation favored by evolutionary psychologists. In\ncontrast, a review of relevant sport literature highlights numerous proximal reasons\nFemale mate choice and sport\nidentified by participants that include, for example, skill improvement/competition, social\nactivities, general physical fitness enhancement, and other reasons such as simply having\nsomething to do (Gill, Gross, and Huddleston, 1983). More specifically, decisions to\nparticipate in sport \"occur in connection with general socialization processes in people's\nlives...[and] are influenced by the availability of opportunities, the existence of social\nsupport, the processes of identity formation, and the cultural context in which decisions are\nmade\" (Coakley and Donnelly, 2004, p. 110). A greater understanding of participation\nmotivation may be greatly enhanced by considering both proximal and distal approaches.\nNonetheless, as it currently stands, motivations associated with sexual selection are not\nconsidered in the sport literature despite young male athletes being more sexually active\nthan non-athletes (Faurie et al., 2004). Although not yet explicitly tested, social factors\nidentified as being important for sport participation (e.g., Sirard, Pfeiffer, and Pate, 2006)\nmay include the acquisition of mating opportunities with females.\nAnother question of particular interest from an evolutionary perspective is the\nmotivations of parents for encouraging team sport participation in their male children.\nPresumably, if parents encouraged male children to participate in sport, and male athletes\nhave higher mating frequency than non-athletes, then parents of athletes would reap\ninclusive fitness benefits from their sons. Thus, evolutionary pressures may exist that have\nled to the encouragement of children, particularly boys, to participate and excel at team\nsports so that parents may maximize their fitness through the enhanced production of\ngrandchildren.\nThis study provides a number of interesting avenues to pursue. The first is the need\nto apply a within-subjects design to more clearly understand the effects of sport\nparticipation in female mate preferences. Second, specific delimitations were imposed on\nthis study. For instance, data analysis in the present study was limited to participants who\nself-categorized as Caucasian, had no specific preference or a preference for a Caucasian\nmate, and who were not opposed to sexual intercourse prior to marriage. Consequently, the\ngeneralizability of results is limited to a population similar in characteristics. However, this\naffords a number of research avenues to pursue in the future.\nThird, the specific types of sports males may participate in may be critical in a\nfemale's assessment of male quality. For example, the social profile of the sport that a male\nparticipates in may be more important than whether the sport is team or individual in\nnature. In North America, high profile sports also happen to be team sports, and so this link\nmay be a confounding factor in our study. In addition, some sports may require varying\ndegrees of muscularity and agility, and these traits may be more or less attractive to\nfemales. Further work should attempt to disentangle this relationship and assess whether\nthe profile of the sport is important in mate choice.\nFourth, a study of female perceptions of traits that are associated with success in the\ncontext of sport participants (both individual and team sports) is critical. We have\nhypothesized that team athletes are more attractive because of specific personality traits,\nbut this remains to be tested.\nFinally, our results may also have some impact on team dynamics from a sports\npsychology perspective. If males are motivated to participate in team sports at least in part\nto enhance mating opportunities, then managing team dynamics and encouraging role\nacceptance may benefit from evolutionary insights.\nFemale mate choice and sport\n"
