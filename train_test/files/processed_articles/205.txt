Aerial\napplication and real fear of pesticide drift enhance concerns\nof accidental pesticide exposure. In Yuma County, agricul-\nture is a year-round activity. The greatest amount of\npesticide is applied during the month of August when insect\npests are the most numerous (Merrigan and Baker, 1995).\nFor community members uninvolved with agriculture, late\nsummer may be the season of greatest exposure risk. Worker\nexposure, excluding pesticide mixers and handlers, is\nlimited during the summer because most of the fieldworks\nare mechanized. Excluding the risk of aerial drift, the\ngreatest potential for human contact with pesticide occurs\nduring the late fall and winter months when crops are tended\nby seasonal and migrant laborers.\nAgricultural worker residents receive job-related pes-\nticide safety training. The Worker Protection Standard of\npesticides used in farming, forestry, and nursery or\ngreenhouse operations (EPA, 1994). The standard\nrequires employers to prevent and mitigate exposure of\nagricultural workers to pesticides. Provisions require\nnotification of application, safety training of the workers\nand handlers, availability of decontamination facilities,\ntransportation to medical treatment, and provision of\nmedical treatment for workers accidentally exposed.\nTraining programs focus on issues related to worker\nsafety. Some information address transfer of pesticide\nfrom the field to the home environment (e.g., separate\nlaundering of field clothes). ``Paraoccupational'' or\nsecondary exposure to family members living in or near\nthe fields remains largely unevaluated (NIOSH, 1995;\nAddress all correspondence to: Dr. Mary Kay O'Rourke, PhD, Commu-\nwww.nature.com/jea\nFenske, 1997), but initial evaluation shows evidence of\nthese exposures (Simcox et al., 1995; Loewenherz et al.,\nOrganophosphate (OP) pesticides are used widely in the\nfields against agricultural pests (methyl parathion, oxyde-\nmeton methyl) and in homes to combat termites and\nroaches (chlorpyrifos, diazinon). Exposure can occur\nthrough all routes, and children are particularly vulnerable.\nChildren are not small adults; they have a high body surface\nto body volume ratio resulting in greater inhalation,\ningestion, and dermal absorption than adults. Further, rates\nof body processes like excretion and metabolism are greater.\nThese rates vary by developmental stage and among\nindividuals within a given stage (Bearer, 1995). Behaviors\nof children (e.g., mouthing surfaces and crawling) further\n1999). Collectively, these differences leave children more\nsusceptible to exposures (Goldman, 1995). Proximity to\nsource places children of farm workers at a greater risk for\nroutine exposure (Fenske, 1997). Demonstrating these\nprinciples with field data, recent studies by Loewenherz et\nmetabolites (dialkylphosphates) among children living in\nagricultural regions.\nUrinary biomarkers can be reported as concentration/unit\nvolume or as concentrations relative to a urine concentration.\nMany factors influence daily urinary output both within and\nbetween individuals. For instance, water, urea, salt, specific\ngravity, and osmolality will increase or decrease depending\non the amount of water consumed. Using a volumetric\napproach, toxicants or metabolites reported as units per liter\nof urine can vary independent of exposure (Elkins et al.,\n1974). Another approach employs a metabolic ``by-\nproduct'' generated by the human body, then the amount of\nmetabolite (e.g., a dialkylphosphate) is expressed in\nrelationship to the amount of ``by-product'' produced by\nthe body (e.g., creatinine, Cr). The assumption is that both\nthe metabolized toxicant and the metabolic by-product are\nresponding to the same processes. Cr is a metabolite\nproduced constantly in the body through the metabolism of\ntissue and protoplasmic molecules (i.e., creatine and\nphosphocreatine in muscle). Cr has little day-to-day and\ninterindividual variability among healthy, working, aged\nadults. Urine samples from the elderly frequently show a\ndecline in urinary Cr. Work evaluating glomerular filtration\nrates suggests that the decline is caused by insufficient\ndietary protein consumption andwhen values are adjusted for\ndiet, no Cr excretion decline is found (Kimmel et al., 1996).\nThe stability of Cr production and excretion among young\nchildren is assumed to be the same as for adults.\nThis paper reports initial results of Cr adjusted urinary\nmetabolite frequency using an OP screen. We focused on\nchildren living in small agricultural communities south of\nYuma, AZ; they were between the ages of 2 and 6 years and\npotty-trained. In the process of evaluating results, we\nexamined factors affecting urinary Cr concentrations and\nthe influence of Cr concentrations on ``exposure'' as\nmeasured by the biomarkers. Since the dialkylphosphates\nrepresent aggregate exposure across multiple pesticides\nwithin a class, calculations of ``theoretical'' absorbed daily\ndose(s) (ADDs) are presented to explore the meaning of\n``high'' laboratory results as they relate to locally used OP\npesticides.\nMethods\nStudy Area and Population Recruitment\nSeven Yuma County census tracts (1990) were selected for\nthe National Human Exposure Assessment Survey\n(NHEXAS) and the Arizona Border Survey (ABS) using\na population proportional to size study design (Robertson et\nal., 1999). We designed the Children's Exposure to Pesticide\nSurvey (CPS) to be performed in the same area. This\nenabled us to build CPS on a base of previously collected\ndata. The community of interest extends from the south side\nof the city of Yuma to the United States border with Mexico.\nThe community includes homes in unincorporated areas and\nthe villages of Somerton, Gadsden, and San Luis, AZ (Figure\n1). According to the 1990 census, this fastgrowing\nagricultural community was over 65% Hispanic.\nStudy subjects were recruited in two ways. (1) NHEXAS\nand ABS used a population-based probability design; 111\nhouseholds were contacted in Yuma County. Of these, 11\nfamilies with children 6 years in age were enrolled in the\nNHEXAS and ABS. Through strict adherence to the study\ndesign, these families were not selected for NHEXAS or\nABS environmental sampling (stage II or III). We\nrecontacted these families and enrolled seven of them in\nthe CPS. These families and families with eligible children\nsampled in NHEXAS and ABS provide a population base for\nbootstrap modeling. (2) We enrolled 143 additional families\nmeeting study criteria by focusing on services catering to\nchildren with the desired characteristics (2\u00b1 6 years and\npossessing bladder control). Participants were enrolled\nthrough Head Start, Migrant Head Start, and Women,\nInfants, and Children (WIC) programs located in San Luis\nand Somerton, AZ, by ``promotoras'' from the Western\nArizona Area Health Education Center (WAHEC). Using\nboth methods, a total of 150 families wereenrolled. Ten of the\nchildren celebrated birthdays prior to stage II sampling (see\nbelow). By the conclusion of the study, we sampled 140\nhomes with 154 children meeting the enrollment criteria to\nparticipate in the CPS.\nStudy Design\nOur study of children's pesticide exposure in Yuma County\ninvolves five stages. This report will evaluate results from\nPesticide exposure and creatinine in young children O'Rourke et al.\nthe first two stages. Stage I \u00d0 Enrollment. All families\nwere administered a descriptive questionnaire to determine\nthe characteristics of the participant population. Questions\naddressed household location, characteristics, and demo-\ngraphic information for each household resident. Stage II\n\u00d0 Screening. This stage required two visits to each enrolled\nhousehold. Interviews included a baseline questionnaire\nrelated to subject exposure, a 1-day record of typical\nactivities and their duration, and a 1-day record of all food\nand beverages consumed. The interview was conducted in\nthe language (Spanish or English) selected by the subject's\nparent/guardian. A first morning urine sample and a\nhousehold dust sample were collected. The remaining three\nstages (intensive sampling, subject education, and commu-\nnity education) are just concluding and will be reported\nlater.\nStage II Sampling, Handling, and Processing\nParents of all participating children were provided with a\nurine cup and basic written and verbal instructions on\nsample collection; they were asked to collect the first urine\nvoid of the day for participating children. Parents were\ninstructed to place all samples in their freezer until the field\nteam returned to retrieve the sample (usually the same day\nof the urine sample collection). Each urine sample was\nlabeled with the child's study identification number. Frozen\nurine samples were shipped to Tucson with cold packs by an\novernight express service. Once received, samples were\nlogged and held in a \u00c0208C freezer. Samples were held and\nshipped in batches of 20 samples to Pacific Toxicology\nLaboratories on dry ice for dialkylphosphate metabolites\nanalysis, with a detection limit of 25 g/l. Residual aliquots\nwere archived at \u00c0188C by Pacific Toxicology Labora-\ntories. Freezing does not appear to affect metabolite\nconcentrations (Ito et al., 1979). Urinary metabolites were\nevaluated and results were returned as raw values (g/l)\nand Cr adjusted values (g/g). Cr values were also\nreported separately in grams of Cr per liter of urine.\nCautions regarding measurement validity were reported if\nurinary Cr levels were <0.5 or >3.0 g/l. Dust samples were\ncollected, processed, and screened for pesticides. Those\nresults will not be discussed in this paper.\nUrine Sample Analysis A minimum of 25 ml of urine was\nplaced in test tubes for sample analysis. The urine was\nfreeze-dried and derivatized using benzyltolyltriazine\nsaturated salt solution was added to the tubes and the benzyl\nderivatives were extracted using cyclohexane and analyzed\nby gas chromatography with flame photometric detection\n(GC/FPD) (Shafik and Enos, 1969; Lores and Bradway,\nLaboratory Quality Assurance Procedures Calibration\nstandards were prepared from pooled blank urine collected\nfrom laboratory personnel. Aliquots of urine were fortified\non the first day of sample preparation from spiking solutions\nprepared from analytical grade salts of the dialkylpho-\nsphates. All standards were extracted and derivatized in the\nsame manner as patient samples and expired after 12\nmonths.\nControls were prepared by fortifying pooled blank urine\n(collected from laboratory personnel) with spiking solution\nusing analytical grade material of a different lot than that\nused to prepare the calibration standard spiking material.\nAfter spiking, the urine was aliquoted (2 ml) in separate\nscrew cap test tubes and frozen until use. Controls were\nprepared at two levels. The low control was prepared at the\nlimit of detection. The high control was prepared at 40\u00c2 the\nlow control.\nOne low control and one high control were extracted and\nanalyzed with each batch of subject samples. The ``control''\nrecoveries were compared to a ``QC range'' set by\nevaluating 10\u00b120 consecutive samples, determining the\nmean and standard deviation of those samples, and\nFigure 1.

Results were only valid when\nthe controls were within the QC range. Control samples are\ntracked across all batches run at the laboratory and\nevaluated for systematic trends and errors using the\nWestgard Rules.\nData Management and Analysis\nAll questionnaires used for this project were produced in\nTeleform and were scanned into SPSS2 portable databases\n(O'Rourke et al., 1999). Samples were labeled with\nbarcodes and logged in into a computerized system. The\nresults of the urinary dialkylphosphate metabolites were\nprovided in paper and electronic formats. Data were hand-\nentered twice, compared, and errors corrected. The final\ndatabase was 100% visually verified against the original\nlaboratory reports.\nCalculations\nData analysis was performed using SPSS2 version 9.0 for\nWindows.2 Exploratory values of ADD were calculated\nusing the formula:\nADD  g biomarker=g Cr\n  \u00c2 g Cr excreted=day\n \n\u00c2 compound wt=metabolite wt\n \n\u00c2 % cleared\n =childHs body weight in kg\nEmpirical data available for the analysis included the\nbiomarker concentration per gram of Cr, the compound\n(specific pesticide) and metabolite (DEP, DMP, DMTP)\nweights, the child's age and body weight as reported by the\nparent. To determine the grams of Cr excreted in a day, we\ntook the product of the Cr yield of the analyzed urine\nsample (g/l) and the age adjusted daily urinary excretion\nrate as reported by Snyder et al. (1975). We assume no\ngender differences in excretion rates for children 6 years\nResults\nDemographics\nOf the 140 households with stage II sampling, two children\nunder the age of 6 years were recruited in 14 homes for a\ntotal of 154 subjects under the age of 6. The study design\nalso called for evaluation of some older sibling for\ncomparison; 38 older children were recruited. Forty-six\npercent of the population was recruited from San Luis, AZ,\na town on the US\u00b1Mexico border; 49% of the population\nwas recruited from Somerton, AZ, a town $8 km northeast\nof San Luis. The remaining 5% was from Gadsden and\nYuma (city). These are the mailing addresses. Many of\nthese homes are in non-urbanized settings proximal to these\nsmall towns.\nAll children were Hispanic and most households were\nbilingual. Families were asked their preferred language.\nSubsequent contacts were made in that language, including\nreports of study results. Only 3% of the families preferred to\nbe interviewed in English. Spanish was the preferred\nlanguage for questionnaire completion in 97% of the homes\nsurveyed. About two thirds of the families spoke both\nlanguages to some extent. Fifty-one percent of the children\nwas comprised of male and 49% female. The majority of the\nchildren 6 years of age were 5 years of age (47%) with\nnear equal representation of 3 and 4 year olds (21% and\n25%, respectively). Each age group had about the same\ngender split.\nCr Concentrations and Sample Validity\nWe collected 196 urine samples from children of all ages;\nfour samples were lost to breakage during shipment. One\nhundred fifty-four samples were evaluated from children\n6 years \u00d0 the focus of this study. The mean Cr value for\nthe distribution of urine samples for each Cr class (g/l). We\nconsidered the effects of a child's age and urinary output as\npotential variables (Snyder et al., 1975) and adjusted the\ngrams per liter Cr measures (Table 1) to reflect daily\nexcretion of Cr (g/day). Figure 2 illustrates the paired Cr\nconcentration lines (g/l and g/day). The grams per liter\nvalues were sorted in ascending order and the case numbers\nwere fixed. The corresponding values in grams per day were\nadjusted using urinary output constants by subject age. The\ntrends of the two lines are similar. [The highest Cr value\n(7.5 g/l or 4.5 g/day) was excluded from Figure 2 for\npurposes of scaling.]\nThe analytical laboratory warned that metabolite results\nwere questionable for samples with Cr less than 0.5 or\ngreater than 3.0 g/l. Thirty-two of these samples were so\ndesignated by the laboratory. By most standards, the Cr\nlevels appeared low, especially since the samples were\nrepresented as first morning voids (g/l). Of the 121\n``valid'' samples, the mean Cr level was 1.05 g/l\n(SD=0.68). Of the 32 samples with low Cr yield, the\nTable 1.

Results are\npresented in Table 2. Only one parent admitted to having no\nrecollection of the sampling time frame. None of the\nchildren wore diapers to bed routinely. Sixteen percent of\nthe parents reported that their child usually wet the bed;\nparents confirmed one bedwetting event and two other\nparents considered bedwetting a possibility. Half of the\nparents believed that the child may have used the toilet\nduring the night without the parent's knowledge. If we\nassume that half of the children with unknown nighttime\ntoilet use actually urinated, then about three quarters of the\nchildren with low Cr yield probably conformed to the\nprotocol. Some other factors must account for the variable\nCr yield in these children.\nNext, we considered whether Cr content of urine varied\nseasonally as found by Freeman et al. (1995). The\nmaximum daily temperature in Yuma County varies\nbetween warm and hot. We divided the year into two\nthrough April 14 (warm). No difference was seen in\nurinary Cr levels during these seasons (0.90 g/l with an n of\nresults were divided into locally relevant seasons, the\nobserved Cr concentrations were significantly different by\nP=0.022). Significant differences exist between the autumn\nand spring Cr concentrations (Mann\u00b1Whitney U=469;\nfound between summer and autumn Cr concentrations\nother differences among seasonal Cr values were signifi-\ncant. Table 3 presents the seasonal values by both grams per\nliter and grams per day of Cr in first morning voids across all\nage groups. The seasonal distribution of 121 valid samples\n(excluding those with Cr <0.5 g/l) shows the same, albeit\nless pronounced, trend.\nFor further comparison, we examined the Cr results for\n6 year olds from the NHANES III survey (DHHS, 1996).\nThe range of Cr difference was under 0.1 g/l across all\nseasons and there was no statistically significant seasonal\nvariability (P=0.05). The NHANES III Cr data presented\nother interesting opportunities. By race, Cr values are\nsignificantly greater for African\u00b1Americans (mean=0.94\nHispanics had significantly greater Cr concentrations\nFigure 2. Cr concentrations for 153 urine samples from CPS.

Pesticide exposure and creatinine in young children\nyear-old children suggest that Cr variability needs to be\nconsidered not only in terms of age, but also in terms of\nrace and ethnicity.\nUrinary Metabolites Indicative of Pesticide Exposure\nThe dialkylphosphates were measured in the urine of 121\nchildren 6 years or younger who were able to urinate\ninto the specimen cup and whose Cr yield was sufficient\nfor laboratory analysis. Overall, at least one metabolite\nwas detected for 33% of the subjects. Many samples\ncontained multiple biomarkers. Only 5% of the subjects\nproduced any of the diethylphosphates (DEPs). None of\nthe other DEPs [diethylphosphorothioate (DETP) or\ndiethylphosphorodithioate (DEDTP) ] was reported from\nthe urine samples. Most of the detectable measures were\nfrom the dimethylphosphates (DMPs). DMP and DMTP\n(dimethylphosphorothioate) were frequently reported\n(25% and 26%, respectively). DMDTP (dimethylpho-\nsphorodithioate) was found in only 3% of the samples.\nHayes et al. (1980) indicate that DMTP had the greatest\nrecovery among the dialkylphosphates. Thus, in most\nstudies, DMTP appears most commonly. These values\nand results from other comparable studies are presented\nin Table 4. DMTP was the most frequently detected\nmetabolite by Azaroff (1999) and Loewenherz et al.\n(1997). The highest concentrations of dialkylphosphates\nwere reported among citrus growers by Griffith and\nDuncan (1985); results were compared with those of\nTable 4 contains the percent of dialkylphosphate\nconcentrations elevated beyond the reference range of\nthe specific analyte (DEP, DMP, DMTP). The laboratory\ndefined the reference range as the level experienced by\noccupationally exposed individuals for that analyte. Since\ndetection was unexpected among non-occupationally\nexposed individuals, the reference range is defined as\nzero at the limit of detection for the method (25 ppb).\nTherefore, anything above 25 ppb was considered above\nthe reference range and is a detect. Viewing all detectable\nlevels as ``high'' only serves to describe result levels\nrelative to other individuals \u00d0 a typical method used in\nclinical analyses. Detection does not imply any toxicolo-\ngical impact or risk. The non-specificity of the results\nlimits the utility of the test; there are no published levels\nof OP residues associated with any kind of toxicological\neffect.\nADD is usually calculated for a single pesticide with a\nspecific metabolite. We have identified pesticides com-\nmonly used in the Yuma area. Metabolism of each pesticide\nwould result in a class of metabolite (DEP, DMP, DMTP).\nTable 5 contains the ADD based on actual biomarkers\ncollected from this population of children. Three children\nare presented for each pesticide example, and each child\nexcreted the greatest concentration of biomarker for his/her\nage class. For these calculations, we assume that a single\npesticide was metabolized, it produced a single metabolite,\nand all of the metabolites were cleared.\nThe measured DEP could be derived from either\nchlorpyrifos or diazinon, among other pesticides not\ndiscussed. Both pesticides are reportedly used in the\nYuma area. For the highest DEP report, the ADD\nexceeds the permissible reference dose by 126 times, in\nthe worst case \u00d0 diazinon. Levels of DMP and DMTP\nas associated with methyl parathion exceed the reference\ndose by 385 and 61 times, respectively. In most cases,\nthere is a considerable difference between the greatest\nmetabolite concentration and the (still elevated) con-\ncentration at the 95th percentile of the distribution. Using\nthe same subject parameters (i.e., g Cr/day and subject\nTable 4.

Clearly, children face greater risks\nto non-occupational pesticide exposure than adults. Pound\nfor pound of body weight, children eat more, breath more,\nand have a faster metabolism. Behaviorally, they play on\nthe floor or lawn where pesticides are commonly applied\nand have more frequent hand-to-mouth contacts (Zartarian\nrange procedure, 5% exposure was expected. DEP\nmeasures met expectations. DMP and DMTP exceeded\nexpectations by 20% and 21%, respectively.\nSeveral factors may account for these numbers. (1)\nSubjects experience paraoccupational exposure as children\nof farm workers. Pesticides are used routinely near their\nhomes, and their parent's occupation promotes transport\nof pesticides from the field to the home. (2) As children,\ntheir behaviors and biology place them at greater risk. (3)\nThe reference population may not be comparable to the\nstudy population in terms of age, activities, and\ntemperature regimes experienced (region of the country).\nFurther, results from the NHEXAS studies indicate a\ngradual increase of chlorpyrifos exposure when compared\nwith NHANES III data. More people appear exposed to\nlow levels of pesticide as time progresses. If the\nlaboratory reference population for CPS was evaluated\nmore than 10 years ago, its relevance today may be\nquestionable.\nFew studies have focused on children's exposure to\npesticides, making comparisons difficult. Guillete et al.\nYaqui children with assumed low level chronic exposure\nto agricultural pesticides and compared them with children\nliving in a nearby community perceived as having less\npesticide use. They found that children who lived in the\nagricultural area had significant deficits in tests of\nstamina, eye\u00b1hand coordination, short-term memory,\nand ability to draw a person when compared with the\npresumably non-exposed children. There were no direct\nmeasures of pesticide dose from the children and\nenvironmental measures were few. The paper shows\ntrends, but has no evaluation, of metabolites indicating\ninternal dose.\nAzaroff (1999) conducted a study with farm workers\nfrom rural El Salvador. She found that nearly half of 358\nsamples had detectable levels of OP metabolites. Detectable\nmetabolite levels were found among 30% of the non-\noccupationally exposed subjects. Similar rates were found\nTable 5.

Pesticide exposure and creatinine in young children\namong children (any age younger that 18) and adults.\nAmong subjects, excretion of OP metabolites was predicted\nby performing fieldwork during the past 2 weeks, having the\nhead of household applying OP pesticides during the past 2\nyears, and reporting the use of OP pesticides in the house or\nyard.\nLoewenherz et al. (1997) measured urinary metabolites\nfrom two groups of children in Washington State.\nChildren (44%), with parents who were pesticide\napplicators had urinary metabolites above the detection\nlevel, while only 27% of the non-applicator's children had\ndetectable levels. The children of non-applicators also\nlived in agricultural environments. The method used by\nLoewenherz et al. (1997) was about twice as sensitive as\nthose of other studies (Table 4). The increased sensitivity\nlevels may influence the percentage reported. Non-\napplicator children may reflect the enhanced ``back-\nground'' measures. If lower detection levels were available\nto CPS, we would expect an increased percentage of the\nYuma population to respond.\nWhen assessing a urine sample for OP concentration, it is\nlogical to obtain the greatest accumulation of urine over a\nspecified time as is possible. The first morning void meets\nthese needs. The investigator must rely on the child and\nparent to make sure the sample is a first morning void. Age\nadjusted Cr concentrations are one approach to evaluating\ncompliance to the protocol. We found no relationship\nbetween low Cr levels and bedwetting or diaper-wearing.\nThe potential for children to use the toilet unbeknown to the\nparent appeared evenly split and remains a possibility for\nabout 10% of the population. In addition to protocol non-\ncompliance, elevated Cr concentrations in first morning\nvoids may impede the chemical assay. Cr values exceeding\n3.0 g/l were only found in one sample from the CPS. Other\nstudies counterelevated Cr by collecting spot urine samples.\nResearchers measure Cr and rely on it being more or less\nconstant.\nFreeman et al. (1995) found highly variable Cr levels\namong children under the age of 6 years living in a Jersey\ncity (NJ) neighborhood near a chromium waste site.\nOverall, Cr levels appeared low. Further, summer mean Cr\nseasonal variability in Cr concentration among young\nchildren.\nA variety of explanations abound for the seasonal trend\nin these two studies. Foremost among these is limited\nknowledge of norms for healthy children. Activity and\nincreased perspiration may play a role. Yet, CPS children\nspent 8 h sleeping prior to sample collection. Some\ndifferences might be caused by changes in household air\ncooling method (air conditioning versus open windows).\nAnother important factor is dietary intake. Elders with\nreduced dietary protein have a decline in urinary Cr\nclearance (Kimmel et al., 1996). Children may have a\ndiet with greater seasonal variation than adults. Ethnic\ndifferences in diet may relate to the racial and ethnic Cr\ndifferences in the NHANES III data. Lower Cr concen-\ntrations yield increased adjusted biomarker measures for a\ntoxicant. What is the impact of these adjustments on\nconcepts like environmental justice if different groups of\nchildren metabolize Cr at different rates or dietary issues\nconfound the Cr yield?\nThe classic paper by Elkins et al. (1974) clearly\ndemonstrates the need for some method of standardizing\ntoxicants in urine. Investigators carefully seek the labora-\ntory with the best detection limit for the analyte of interest\nalong with quality assurance procedures; less thought is\nprovided to the Cr standard. Our evaluation of the CDC Cr\nconcentrations among 6 year olds in NHANES III showed a\ntotal spread of only 0.09 g/l across all seasons. Six years of\nage marks a major change for children. They enter school\nfor a complete day and activities change. These changes\nmay affect Cr yield along with racial and ethnic factors. An\nalternative is the caliber of laboratory work done at CDC.\nThey may yield consistently better Cr measurements than\ncommercial laboratories.\nCr concentration is fundamental to the calculation of\ninternal dose and ADD. We calculated the ADD for a 4-\nyear-old child using daily Cr concentrations measured in\nthe field and using those reported by Snyder et al. (1975).\nAssuming exposure to methyl parathion of 179 g/g Cr\nand using the greater measures found for our population\nday\u00c01. Both measures exceed the RfD; the value based on\nour actual Cr measure is almost three times greater.\nLaboratory errors on Cr measures may result in erroneous\nconclusions regarding pesticide safety. Further, our results\nand those of Freeman et al. (1995) suggest that Cr yield\nmay be more variable among children. NHANES IV will\nevaluate children under the age of 6 years across all\nseasons. Results may better characterize Cr production in\nyoung children across a variety of temporal and spatial\nregimes.\nThe OP screen provides interesting, although non-\nspecific, results. It enables investigators to evaluate a\n``class'' of pesticides and not miss an important exposure by\na poor selection of specific metabolites. In our future stage\nIII evaluations of CPS, we can examine the relationships\nbetween the OP screen and metabolites specific to a\npesticide.\nConclusions\nIn Yuma County, one or more urinary metabolites to OP\npesticides were observed in 33% of the children 6 years\nPesticide exposure and creatinine in young children O'Rourke et al.\nof age. Paraoccupational exposure is a likely source.\nBedwetting or wearing of diapers did not appear to be a\nproblem in obtaining a first morning void. There may be a\nseasonal variation in Cr yield in young children. Cr yield\nper day is a critical component of ADD calculations.\nVariability in Cr measures will produce differences in\ninternal dose and estimates of ADD independent of\nexposure.\n"
