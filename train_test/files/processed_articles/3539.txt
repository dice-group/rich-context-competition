MP\nproduces the community-acquired respira-\ntory distress syndrome toxin, which most\nlikely aids in leading to inflammation and\nairway dysfunction. Formation of some viru-\nlence factors, such as lactoferrin, hydroxyl\nradicals, superoxide anions, and hydrogen\nperoxide, aggravate tissue damage. The\nimmunological responses by MP may cause\nother systemic symptoms.5\nMPP is usually characterized by a per-\nsistent dry cough and fever, and is con-\nsidered as a mild and self-limited disease that\nis cured with no medication. Nevertheless,\neven when MMP is treated with macrolide\nantibiotic in a timely manner, severe pul-\nmonary and extra-pulmonary complications\nmay lead to respiratory failure and hypoxia.\nThese complications can develop into severe\nlife-threatening pneumonia in some severe\ncases.6\u00ad10 Clinicians need to identify severe\nand complicated MPP at earlier stages.\nOther severe complications that have been\nidentified from fulminant MPP cases include\nacute organ embolism and infarction, such\nas carotid artery embolization and cerebral\ninfarction. The majority of acute cerebral\ninfarction cases have occurred in children\nwith MPP in recent years.11\u00ad20 Pulmonary\nembolism and paediatric femoral artery\nthrombosis have also been reported in chil-\nshowed that there were coagulation abnorm-\nalities in children with MPP.\nBlood coagulation might be abnormal in\ncases of MP infection and blood coagulation\nabnormalities can cause embolization.11\u00ad23\nStudies have shown that some cases of\nMMP show coagulation abnormal-\ncerebral infarction was reported in Weifang\nlevels in blood were significantly higher than\nnormal.15 The relationship between MP\ninfection and embolization is still unclear.\nFew multiple-case studies have reported\nchanges in coagulation in children with\ncase\u00adcontrol study to analyse the changes in\ncoagulation in children with MPP.\nMaterials and methods\nA case\u00adcontrol study was conducted in\nWeifang People's Hospital, Shandong\nDecember, 2014. All children who had symp-\ntoms and signs indicative of pneumonia, such\nas fever, cough, abnormal lung auscultation,\nand a new infiltrate on chest radiograph, were\nadmitted to the Department of Paediatrics\nand tested for mycoplasma by samples of\nthroat swabs within 3h by a quick method\n(MP 3h Culture Identification Kit, Wuhan\nShowtime Technology Co., Ltd). This study\nwas approved by the ethics committee of\nAll of the parents of the children who\nparticipated signed an informed consent form.\nAll of the children with pneumonia\nwho had MP-positive throat swabs had a\n5-ml sample of venous blood collected\n(Improve Medical Technology, Guangzhou,\nChina) before treatment. During 60min after\ncollection, blood samples were centrifuged\ncentrifuge (Baiyang Medical Instrument\nCompany, Beijing, China) and the plasma\nwas immediately separated. Indices of coagu-\nlation, including prothrombin time (PT),\nactivated partial thromboplastin time\n(APTT), thrombin time (TT), and plasma\nfibrinogen (FIB) and D-dimer levels were\ndetected in 2 h. The coagulation test and\nplasma D-dimer kit were from Mitsubishi\nChemical Corporation. Detection was\nperformed using the ACLTOP700 automatic\nblood coagulation analyser (Beckman\nCoulter). Other clinical indices, such as\nC-reactive protein (CRP) (IMMAGE 800\nTurbidimetric Inhibition Immunoassay\nSystem; Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA,\nAutomated Hematology System; Sysmex,\nKobe, Japan), and the erythrocyte sedimen-\ntation rate (Westergren's blood sedimenta-\ntion tube; Hull Medical Science and\nTechnology Co., Ltd., Hefei, China), were\nanalysed by routine methods.\nAfter approximately 2 weeks of symp-\ntoms, all of the children with pneumonia and\nMP-positive throat swabs had 2 ml of venous\nblood collected using IMPROVACUTER\u00d5\nEDTA K2 tubes. Blood samples were cen-\ntrifuged at 2500r/min at room temperature\nMedical Instrument Company) and the\nplasma was immediately separated, frozen,\nand stored at \u00c080C until later analysis. IgM\nantibody was detected by a diagnostic kit for\nmeasurement of antibodies to MP according\nto the manufacturer's instructions (passive\nparticle agglutination test, Serodia-Myco II;\nFujirebio Inc., Japan).\nPatients who were MP IgM-positive and\nhad an antibody titre ! 1:160 were selected\nas cases. Cases were divided into two sub-\ngroups: the low-titre group with an MP IgM\ntitre group with an MP IgM titre equal to\nwere selected as controls from the Health\nEvaluation Clinic at the same hospital\nduring the study period. Similarity of sex\nand age between the children with MMP\nand healthy children was considered when\nthe healthy children were selected. Samples\nof venous blood to detect MP IgM antibody\nand four indices of coagulation and plasma\nD-dimer levels were also collected. The IgM\nantibody of controls needed to be negative\n(IgM titre < 1:40). All of the children in\nthe case and control groups had a routine\nclinical examination. Sex, age, medical his-\ntory, and laboratory data were recorded by\nclinical doctors. Children with other respira-\ntory tract infections and tuberculosis,\nrheumatic diseases, haematological diseases,\nand immunodeficiency were excluded from\nthe case and control groups. Children who\ntook some medicine or other substances that\naffect the blood system were also excluded.\nSPSS 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,\nUSA) was used for statistical analysis.\nContinuous data are shown as mean \u00c6\nstandard deviation (x \u00c6 s). All continuous\ndata were tested for normality and homo-\ngeneity of variance. Analysis of variance or\nthe Student's t-test was used to determine\ndifferences in continuous variables among\nthe groups. The Student\u00adNewman\u00adKueuls\n(SNK) method was used to identify signifi-\ncant differences between group means.\nCategorical data are shown as frequencies.\nPearson's chi-square test or Fisher's exact\ntest was used to analyse differences between\ncategorical variables. P < 0.05 was desig-\nnated as the level of statistical significance.\nReceiver operating characteristic (ROC)\nanalysis was used to further assess differ-\nences in coagulation between children with\nMMP (cases) and controls. The areas under\nthe curves (AUCs) were calculated.\nResults\nBasic characteristics of the study subjects\nA total of 185 children with MPP-positive\nantibody (IgM antibody titre ! 1:160) were\nselected as cases and 117 healthy children\n(IgM antibody titre < 1:40) were recruited as\ncontrols.

We found that\nchildren with MPP had higher plasma FIB\nand D-dimer levels, and a shorter PT and\nAPTT than did healthy children. These\nfindings indicated that children with MPP\nwere more likely to have blood coagulation\nand a higher risk of thrombosis. There were\nno differences between the high-titre MP\nantibody group and the low-titre group.\nFIB is a glycoprotein in blood, and is\nsynthesized in the liver by hepatocytes and\nhelps in formation of blood clots.24 FIB can\nform bridges between platelets, by binding\nto their GpIIb/IIIa surface membrane pro-\nteins. FIB deficiency or disturbed function\nof FIB can lead to either bleeding or\nthromboembolic complications.25 FIB can\nfunction as a cofactor in aggregation of\nplatelets, and an increase in FIB indicates\neasier blood agglutination. An increase in\nplasma FIB levels is always identified in\nvarious diseases, such as diabetes, preg-\nnancy-induced hypertension, acute neph-\nritis, and cancer. An increase in plasma\nFIB levels can also be found in infectious\ndiseases and has a major effect on the\ncoagulation system. Nevertheless, few stu-\ndies have focussed on an increase in FIB\nlevels in children with MPP.\nD-dimer is a specific degradation product\nthat is produced in hydrolysis of fibrin,\nwhich is regarded as an important indicator\nof hyperfibrinolysis. Detection of D-dimer is\nable to reveal early thrombotic disease and\nreflect generation of thrombin and plasmin.\nPlasma D-dimer levels are a specific marker\nof the fibrinolysis process in the clinic.\nD-dimer is often elevated in many diseases,\nsuch as disseminated intravascular coagula-\ntion, venous thrombosis, coronary heart\ndisease, severe infection, tissue necrosis,\nand colorectal cancer.26 D-dimer levels are\nalso closely related to the inflammatory\nresponse and may reflect the effects of\ninfection on coagulation in infectious dis-\neases. Some studies have reported that\nplasma D-dimer levels are significantly\nincreased in children with acute MPP,\nwhich suggests that blood is in a hypercoa-\ngulable state and the presence of throm-\nbosis.27 A study in Taiwan reported that\nMP-infected adults were in a hypercoagul-\nable state and had a high risk of stroke\nthrough 5 years of observation among more\nThere have been many reports on MPP\nwith acute cerebral infarction or hemiplegia,\nmost of which were cases of MMP in\nchildren.11\u00ad23 However, the cause of abnor-\nmal coagulation function and thrombosis is\nnot fully understood.29 Some authors con-\ncluded that cytokines and mycoplasma\nTable 3.

In vitro experimental\nstudies have suggested that lipoglycans from\nsome mycoplasma can induce procoagulant\nactivity through human mononuclear cells.35\nMany studies have reported that blood\ncoagulation function in children with MP\ninfection and venous or arterial thrombosis\nreturn to normal after anticoagulant ther-\napy.36,37 Additionally, after this therapy,\nantiphospholipid antibodies disappear and\nanti-clotting factor activity normalizes.36,37\nTreatment of children with MPP should be\nconsidered for controlling thrombosis\naccording to mechanisms of thrombus due\nto MP infection. Thrombolytic therapies\nshould be considered as soon as possible\nwhen clinical circumstances arise.38\nThere are several limitations in the study.\nFirst, this study was performed in only\none hospital. The representativeness of the\nsample should be considered when the con-\nclusions are generalized. Second, the findings\nFigure 1.
