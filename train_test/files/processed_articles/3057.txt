We analyzed data using linear and logistic regres-\nsion models. Serum ascorbic acid, serum vitamin B12\n,\nhemoglobin, red blood cell mean corpuscular volume\n(MCV), and serum ferritin levels were measured using\nstandardized protocols. History of kidney stones was de-\ntermined by self-report.\nResults: After multivariate adjustment, serum ascorbic\nacid level was associated with higher serum vitamin B12\nlevels among women in regression models that assumed\na linear relationship; each 57-\u00b5mol/L (1.0-mg/dL) in-\ncrease in serum ascorbic acid level (range, 6-153 \u00b5mol/L\n[0.1 to 2.7 mg/dL]) was independently associated with\nmL) (P.001). Among men, serum ascorbic acid level\nwas marginally associated with higher serum vitamin B12\nlevels: each 57-\u00b5mol/L (1.0-mg/dL) increase in serum\nascorbic acid level was associated with a serum vitamin\naddition, serum ascorbic acid level was not associated with\ncorrelates of vitamin B12\ndeficiency, such as higher MCV\nlevels, macrocytosis (MCV 100), or lower hemoglo-\nbin concentrations.

How-\never, among women only, serum ascorbic acid levels were\nassociated in a nonlinear fashion with prevalence of el-\nevated serum ferritin levels (P = .02).

Men had higher\ndietary iron intakes and serum ferritin lev-\nels compared with women but roughly\ncomparable serum vitamin B12\nlevels. Ap-\nproximately 3% of women and 5% of men\nreported a history of kidney stones. Preva-\nlence of high serum ferritin levels was ap-\nproximately 5% among women and 8%\namong men. A varying number of sub-\njects in our sample gave a history of us-\ning vitamin C supplements, and, as ex-\nFrom the General Internal\nMedicine Section, Medical\nService, Veterans Affairs\nMedical Center, San Francisco,\nCalif (Dr Simon), and\nDepartment of Epidemiology\nand Biostatistics, University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco\n(Drs Simon and Hudes).\n\u00a91999 American Medical Association.

Approxi-\nmately 1% of participants in the lowest serum ascorbic\nacid quintile used supplements compared with 6% to 12%\nof participants in the highest quintile. Mean dietary ascor-\nbic acid intakes for women and men were 94 mg/d and\nWe examined whether serum ascorbic acid level was\nassociated with serum vitamin B12\nlevel in several models\n(Table 2). In univariate, age-adjusted, and multivariate\nmodels, serum ascorbic acid level was associated with\nhigher serum levels of vitamin B12\nin women; in the mul-\ntivariate model, each 57-\u00b5mol/L (1.0-mg/dL) increase in\nserumascorbicacidlevelwasindependentlyassociatedwith\nMETHODS\nSUBJECTS\nNHANES II was a national probability survey of more than\nticipants, whose age ranged from 3 to 74 years, were in-\nterviewed and examined by study personnel at 2 visits.19\nWe analyzed data from adult participants between the ages\nticipants who answered questions regarding a history of\nkidney stones. Serum vitamin B12\nlevels and serum ferritin\nticipants, respectively.\nMEASUREMENTS\nNHANES II questionnaire data included self-reported age,\nrace, sex, menopausal status, years of education com-\npleted, level of leisure time physical activity, history of smok-\ning, level of alcohol intake, gout, and use of diuretic medi-\ncations, hormones, and nutritional supplements. Nutrition\ndata were collected using a food frequency questionnaire\nand 24-hour diet recall. We calculated body mass index (a\nmeasure of weight in kilograms divided by the square of\nheight in meters) from weight and height data recorded dur-\ning the physical examination. The questionnaires, dietary\nmethods, and examination procedures used in NHANES\nII have been described elsewhere in detail.19\nSerum ascorbic acid levels were measured at the Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention by the dinitrophenyl-\nhydrazine method using a standardized protocol.20 Be-\ncause there were a small number of extreme serum ascorbic\nacid values of questionable validity (ranging as high as 1028\n\u00b5mol/L [18.1 mg/dL]), we excluded participants with ascor-\nbic acid levels in the top 0.5% of the sample (n = 54). Ascor-\nbic acid levels for the remaining 99.5% of the participants\nlevels were measured in a sub-\ngroup of participants using the radioassay method de-\nscribed by Gunter et al20 and Lau et al.21 Serum ferritin lev-\nels were measured at the University of Kansas Medical\nCenter, Kansas City. For both serum vitamin B12\nand se-\nrum ferritin assays, a subsample of persons was selected\nas follows: all persons whose NHANES II numbers ended\nin 8 and persons with 1 or more abnormal hematologic val-\nues (red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood\ncell mean corpuscular volume [MCV], white blood cell\ncount). An additional ferritin subsample of participants was\nalso randomly chosen at the end of the survey for ferritin\nanalysis.22 A 2-site immunoradiometric assay was per-\nformed and samples with high serum ferritin levels (200\n\u00b5g/L) and low serum ferritin levels (20 \u00b5g/L) were reas-\nsayed.22,23 To identify participants with elevated serum fer-\nritin levels, we used the age- and sex-specific cut points\npublished by the NHANES II Expert Scientific Working\nGroup on iron status of the US population.22 These cut points\nA history of kidney stones was established by a posi-\ntive response to either of the following 2 questions: \"Have\nyou ever had kidney stones?\" and \"Did a doctor ever tell\nyou that you had kidney stones or stones in the ureter?\"\nWe examined the distribution of ascorbic acid concentra-\ntions and other variables of interest using sample weights.\nWe used simple and multiple linear regression models to\nexamine the relation of serum ascorbic acid level to serum\nlevel, hemoglobin concentration, MCV, and se-\nrum ferritin level. For the dichotomous outcomes, ie, pres-\nence of elevated serum ferritin levels and kidney stones,\nwe used simple and multiple logistic regression models.\nLevel of education, level of physical activity, and alcohol\nconsumption were analyzed as ordinal variables in the mul-\ntivariate models.\nAnalyses were performed using Stata software that in-\ncluded survey commands for the analysis of complex sur-\nvey data.24 We calculated linear regression coefficients and\n95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate differences in\nlevel, hemoglobin concentration, MCV,\nand serum ferritin level associated with each 57-\u00b5mol/L (1.0-\nmg/dL) increase in serum ascorbic acid level. Odds ratios\nand their 95% CIs were calculated using logistic regres-\nsion to estimate the relative prevalence of elevated serum\nferritin levels and kidney stones. Hosmer-Lemeshow good-\nness-of-fit tests25 modified for weighted data were per-\nformed using a SAS macro program.26 Two-tailed P values\nof .05 were considered to be statistically significant, unad-\njusted for multiple comparisons.27\nFigures examining the relation of serum ascorbic acid\nlevel to serum vitamin B12\nlevel and hemoglobin concen-\ntration were calculated using linear and quadratic coeffi-\ncients derived from linear regression models. Predicted lev-\nels of the outcome variables were calculated within each\n6-\u00b5mol/L (0.1-mg/dL) serum ascorbic acid level and the low-\ness smoothing procedure was applied to produce the plots.28\nFigures that examined the association between serum ascor-\nbic acid level and prevalence of elevated serum ferritin level\nwere used to plot the adjusted prevalence of elevated se-\nrum ferritin level as a function of serum ascorbic acid level.\nLogistic coefficients were used to compute individual pre-\ndicted probability of elevated serum ferritin level. Next, we\ncomputed the mean of these probabilities within each 6-\n\u00b5mol/L (0.1-mg/dL) serum ascorbic acid level and then ap-\nplied the lowess smoothing procedure to produce the plots.28\n\u00a91999 American Medical Association.

In univariate mod-\nels, serum ascorbic acid level was significantly associ-\nated with serum ferritin level among women (P.01) but\nnot among men (P = .99) The association between ascor-\nbic acid and iron status among women was attenuated\nafter multivariate adjustment (P = .05) and further at-\ntenuated after controlling for the additional effects of\nmenopausal status and hormone use (P = .14).

We did, however, find a nonlinear relation\nbetween serum ascorbic acid level and prevalence of el-\nevated serum ferritin levels among women, which ap-\npeared similar to the relation between serum ascorbic acid\nlevel and hemoglobin concentration among women.\nLEVELS\nUsing the same vitamin B12\nradioassay used in NHANES\nII, Herbert and Jacob5 reported that the addition of ascor-\nbic acid to homogenized test meals resulted in the destruc-\n. These findings, however, could not be\nreplicated.16 Herbert and colleagues11 later reported that 4\nof 18 patients with spinal cord injury who received 2 g/d\nof ascorbic acid for periods up to several years were vita-\ndeficient. Others, however, have judged these find-\nings to be, at least in part, the result of an artifact of the\nassay used to measure vitamin B12\nlevels.2 Examination of\nthe relation of high intakes of ascorbic acid in 10 patients\nwith spinal cord injury29 and among 40 children with my-\nelomeningoceles30 failed to reveal an association between\nascorbic acid and vitamin B12\ndeficiency. To our knowl-\nedge, there have been no large population-based studies\nexamining the relation of ascorbic acid to vitamin B12\nsta-\ntus. We found no evidence that serum ascorbic acid levels\nare associated inversely with serum vitamin B12\nlevels. On\nthe contrary, it appeared that higher ascorbic acid serum\nlevels were, on average, associated with higher serum vi-\nlevels among women and men. These findings\ncould be the result of a correlated intake of these nutri-\nents, either in the diet or in nutritional supplements.\nAlthough serum ferritin levels may be elevated as a con-\nsequence of inflammatory conditions, they generally re-\nflect total body iron stores and are considered the best mea-\nsuretoassessironstatusinepidemiologicstudies.31 Ascorbic\nacidenhancestheabsorptionofnonhemeiron32 and,there-\nfore, may aid in the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia.\nHowever, ascorbic acid may be detrimental to individuals\nwho carry the gene for hemochromatosis.8 In assessing the\nprevalence of elevated serum ferritin levels based on age-\nand sex-specific cut points,22 we found no association be-\ntween ascorbic acid and prevalence of elevated serum fer-\nritin levels among men but observed a nonlinear relation\namong women.

Several reviews have concluded that, for most in-\ndividuals, high levels of ascorbic acid consumption are\nsafe.2-4 Furthermore, other analyses of NHANES data have\nreported improved health outcomes and lower mortality\nrates among individuals with high serum or intake levels\nMost kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate or\nstudies have reported that urinary oxalate and uric acid\nexcretion are increased by the ingestion or administra-\ntion of large amounts of ascorbic acid.2 Studies that ex-\namined the relation of ascorbic acid to oxalate and uric\nacid excretion have generally examined small numbers\nof subjects.2 We were able to examine the relation of se-\nrum ascorbic acid level to history of kidney stones among\nfound no evidence to indicate that high serum ascorbic\nacid levels increased the prevalence of kidney stones. On\nthe contrary, among men, each 57-\u00b5mol/L (1.0-mg/dL)\nincrease in serum ascorbic acid level was independently\nassociated with an approximately 28% decrease in the\nprevalence of kidney stones (P = .06). These findings agree\nwith the conclusions of others2 that in general, high lev-\nels of ascorbic acid ingestion do not result in increased\nkidney stone formation and may, in fact, be associated\nwith a decreased prevalence of kidney stones.38\nThe main limitation of our study derives from the\ncross-sectional nature of the analyses. Thus, we cannot be\ncertain that the outcomes did not affect ascorbic acid con-\nsumption and, in turn, serum ascorbic acid levels. For ex-\nample, it is possible that persons with kidney stone dis-\nease decreased their ascorbic acid intake and consequently\nlowered their blood ascorbic acid level, thereby produc-\ning the ostensible protective association between ascor-\nbic acid and kidney stones. Although we cannot exclude\nthis possibility, it is also biologically plausible that ascor-\nbic acid may, in fact, lower the risk of kidney stones by\ndecreasing urinary calcium excretion.13 Because most\npeople are unlikely to know their serum ferritin level or\nlevel, it seems less probable that these asso-\nciations resulted from individuals changing their ascor-\nbic acid intake. The serum vitamin B12\nradiodilution as-\nsay used by NHANES II measures both biologically active\nand inactive vitamin B12\nanalogs.39 Hence, we cannot be\ncertain that the higher levels of serum vitamin B12\nassoci-\nated with serum ascorbic acid levels reflect higher levels\nof the biologically active form of the vitamin.

Finally, because the geno-\ntype of participants is not known, we cannot comment on\nthe relation of serum ascorbic acid levels to elevated se-\nrum ferritin levels among individuals categorized by their\ngenetic susceptibility to iron overload.\nThere are 2 notable strengths to these analyses.

Sec-\nond, the measurement of serum ascorbic acid levels on\nsuch a large number of persons provides a more accu-\nrate and precise assessment of ascorbic acid status as a\ncorrelate of serum vitamin B12\nlevel, serum ferritin level,\nand history of kidney stones than studies using dietary\nand supplement estimates only.\nEstablishing the safety of high levels of ascorbic acid\ningestionisofpublichealthimportanceinviewofthelarge\npercentageofAmericansconsumingsupplementscontain-\ning ascorbic acid.
