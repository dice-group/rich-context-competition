An increasingly large proportion of patients were treated by physicians\nConclusions Between 1987 and 1997, there was a marked increase in the proportion\nof the population who received outpatient treatment for depression. Treatment be-\ncame characterized by greater involvement of physicians, greater use of psychotropic\nmedications, and expanding availability of third-party payment, but fewer outpatient\nvisits and less use of psychotherapy. These changes coincided with the advent of better-\ntolerated antidepressants, increased penetration of managed care, and the develop-\nment of rapid and efficient procedures for diagnosing depression in clinical practice.\nand first half of the 1990s was a period\nof significant change in the delivery of\nmental health services, including the\ngrowth of managed care and the devel-\nopment of selective serotonin reup-\ntake inhibitor (SSRI) medications.\nGiven these changes, there is a dearth\nof information regarding changes over\ntime in characteristics of persons treated\nfor depression.\nIn this article, we examine national\ntrends in the care of outpatients with\nNational Medical Expenditure Survey\nditure Panel Survey (MEPS).

Antidepressant medica-\ntions became established as a mainstay,\npsychotherapysessionsbecamelesscom-\nmon and fewer among those receiving\ntreatment, and physicians assumed a\nmoreprominentrole.Thesechangessug-\ngest that access to mental health ser-\nvices has increased and that there has\nbeen an increased emphasis on pharma-\ncologic treatments.\nSeveral factors may have contributed\nto these trends. Beginning with the in-\ntroduction of fluoxetine in late 1987 and\nfollowed by several other SSRIs and an-\ntidepressants with atypical mecha-\nnisms of action, there has been a steady\nbroadening of the pharmacologic op-\ntions available to treat depression.

An ABC News poll35\nof adults would be willing to take an-\ntidepressants for depression for an ex-\ntended period even though they were\ninformed that safety studies had not\nbeen conducted on long-term use of\nthese medications. This suggests that\nthe pharmacologic treatment of depres-\nsion is becoming less stigmatized.\nThe growth in managed mental\nhealth care and the concepts of dis-\nease management36 and medical neces-\nsity37 may have further spurred the\npharmacologic treatment of depres-\nsion. In many plans, comprehensive\npharmacy benefits encourage medica-\ntion management visits over psycho-\ntherapy visits, which are not reim-\nbursed as generously. Managed care\ngenerally seeks to shift patient care from\nspecialty to primary care physicians\nwho are able and may be more likely\nto use pharmacologic treatments rather\nthan psychotherapy to manage depres-\nsion.

For example, although the ECA\nfigures include treatment for any men-\ntal health or addictive symptoms by\nadults who meet criteria for an affec-\ntive disorder, the NMES figures in-\nclude only outpatient treatment re-\nported for depression. Methodologic\ndifferences between the studies stem\nfrom underlying differences in their pri-\nmary aims: to quantify psychopathol-\nogy in the community (ECA and NCS)\nand to measure service use over time\n(NMES and MEPS).\nOne consequence of increased phar-\nmacologictreatmentofdepressionisthat\nlarger numbers of depressed individu-\nals are being treated with both pharma-\ncotherapyandpsychotherapy.Recentre-\nsearch suggests that the combination of\nan antidepressant and cognitive behav-\nioral psychotherapy is more efficacious\nthan either treatment alone for chronic\nforms of major depression.41 In milder\ndepressions, psychotherapy alone may\nbe nearly as effective as the combina-\ntion of antidepressants and psycho-\ntherapy.42 The extent to which com-\nbined treatments confer meaningful\nadvantages over single-modality treat-\nments in clinical practice awaits de-\ntailed longitudinal practice-based out-\ncomes research.\nThe current study is constrained by\nseveral limitations. Both the NMES and\nMEPS collect data from household in-\nformants who may not be fully aware of\nall of the services used by household\nmembers. Stigma, recall problems, and\nproblems distinguishing the different\nprovider groups pose threats to the re-\nporting and classification of the survey\ndata.Somerespondents,especiallythose\nwith less education, may not be able to\nidentify \"psychotherapy/mental health\ncounseling\" when they receive it. With-\nout an independent measure of symp-\ntoms, it is not possible to determine\nwhether patients who received treat-\nment actually met diagnostic criteria for\nsurvey did not break out providers by\nphysician specialty, thereby limiting our\nability to determine whether the ob-\nserved changes in treatment patterns oc-\ncurred primarily in the general medical\nor specialty mental health sector.\nIn recent years, a growing number of\nAmericans have received treatment for\ndepression. During this period, anti-\ndepressant medications have gained\npopularity and physicians have ex-\ntended their involvement in care. For\nthe promise of increased access to treat-\nment to be fully realized, available treat-\nments must be provided in a safe,\ntimely, and effective manner. An im-\nportant challenge ahead is to charac-\nterize the community treatment of de-\npression with greater specificity and\nrelate variations in these treatments to\ncritical patient outcomes.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design: Olf-\nson, Marcus, Druss, Elinson, Pincus.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Olfson, Marcus,\nDruss, Tanielian, Pincus.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Olfson.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Olfson, Marcus, Druss, Elinson,\nTanielian.\nStatistical expertise: Marcus.\nObtained funding: Pincus.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Tanie-\nlian.\nStudy supervision: Olfson, Pincus.\nFunding/Support: Preparation of this article was as-\nsisted by a grant from The Robert Wood Johnson Foun-\ndation, Princeton, NJ.\n"
