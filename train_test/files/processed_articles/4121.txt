A shape bias for extending names to objects that look visually similar has been commonly\naccepted but it is hard to define which kind of shape dissimilarities are diagnostic for the identity\nof an object. Here, we present a transformational approach to describe shape differences that can\nincorporate many significant shape features. We introduce two kinds of transformations: one kind\nconcerns linear transformations of the image plane (affine transformations), generally limiting shape\nvariations within the borders of basic-level categories; the other kind concerns nonlinear continuous\ntransformations of the image plane (topological transformations), allowing all kinds of shape variation\ncrossing and not crossing the borders of basic-level categories. We administered stimulus pairs\ndiffering in these shape transformations to children of 3 years to 7 years old in a delayed match-\nto-sample task. With increasing age, especially between 5 years and 6 years, children became more\nsensitive to the topological deformations that are relevant for between-category distinctions, indicating\nthat acquired categorical knowledge in early years induces perceptual learning of the relevant generic\nshape differences between categories.\n1 ",

Variation in metric properties is generally\nallowed between different exemplars of the same basic-level category, whereas differences\nin other shape features are sometimes crucial to distinguish between objects belonging to\ndifferent categories. For example, bowls can be deeper or shallower and bottles can be longer\nor shorter and thinner or thicker, but bowls and bottles differ categorically in the curvature\nvariation along their contours. In this study, we hypothesize that children become more\nsensitive by age to shape changes that imply a category change (eg from bowl to bottle) than\nto shape changes that imply no category change (eg from a shallow bowl to a deeper one).\nTo test this idea we apply a transformational approach to shape perception. Specifically,\nwe use a procedure which was first introduced in computer vision (so-called thin plate\nsplines; see Bookstein 1989), which interpolates the contour changes from a primary contour\nto a target contour towards the whole image plane. Each planar transformation involves\ntwo components: a planar affine (linear) transformation and a (nonlinear) topological trans-\nformation. The latter kind allows contour changes that are relevant for making categorical\ndistinctions and the former kind allows variation in metric properties that are less relevant for\ncategorical distinctions. An interesting aspect of this procedure is that it can also be applied\nto random (nonexisting) contours, allowing us to contrast the sensitivity for these two kinds\nof transformations between everyday objects and similar nonsense shapes.\nSuppose that children become more sensitive to relevant shape changes (nonlinear\ntopological transformations) compared with irrelevant shape changes (linear topological\ntransformations). In principle, such a differential development of sensitivity can be localized\non two levels. First, category representations might enhance the detection of shape differ-\nences for two objects belonging to different categories. Then, we expect that our hypothesis\nholds only for contours derived from existing objects. However, when the hypothesis holds\nfor existing and nonexisting objects, we can conclude that children acquired different modes\nof shape processing for relevant and irrelevant shape properties independently from the\nrelevant category representations. In other words, relevant and irrelevant shape properties\nwould then be processed automatically and independently from interpretations resulting\nfrom identification or categorization processes. We test this hypothesis using a delayed\nmatch-to-sample task with outlines derived from everyday objects as well as with outlines of\nnonsense shapes, sharing similar properties and undergoing similar shape transformations.\nBefore we describe the study in more detail, we provide somewhat more background to\nsupport our hypothesis and to substantiate our design choices.\n1.1 Shape-based categorization\nIn several different tasks, it has been demonstrated that names are generalized to new objects\nthat preserve the shape properties of a category (Landau and Leyton 1999; Landau et al 1988,\n1998; Smith 2003). The shape bias for extending categories to new exemplars increases by age.\nFor instance, in Landau et al (1988) participants generalized from a reference object towards\nnew instances and they seemed to rely even more on shape cues when the reference objects\nwere labeled. These kinds of results have led to the consideration that shape perception\nforms a precursor for category development in children as well as adults. Nouns used in\neveryday language refer often to rather general classes (eg the noun `dog' to refer to a German\nshepherd or a golden retriever). General classes that are referred to by nouns in everyday\nlanguage have often been called the basic level of abstraction (Jolicoeur et al 1984; Rosch and\nMervis 1975; Rosch et al 1976). From the perspective of shape perception, the basic level of\ncategory inclusiveness is the level of shape abstraction that maximizes within-category shape\nsimilarity and between-category shape dissimilarity, and children might be predisposed to\nform perceptual categories that group objects together that look similar and to separate\nobjects that look dissimilar.\nIn contrast, other theories have indicated that the basic level might appear later in\ndevelopment through differentiation of more general classes and the generalization of deep\nproperties (Dewar and Xu 2009; Mandler and McDonough 1993). According to this alternative\nview, categories are formed on the basis of category membership and by a subdivision of\nobjects into kinds. Such a mechanism could also lead to a reliance on shape perception but\nthen only as a by-product of an acquired correlation between shapes and kinds that has been\nlearned through experience. Although the primacy of shape in language development is part\nof a long-standing debate, the weaker version of the shape bias--the expectation that same\nshaped objects are referred to by the same labels--is widely accepted.\nIn former views, word learning and language development were frequently thought of as\na gradual learning process based on some predispositions and some acquired skills. Contrary\nto language development, shape perception was often thought of as part of a granted and\nconsolidated skill in an early stage of development. In the present study, however, we focus\ninstead on the further development of shape perception in young children between the ages\nof 3 years and 7 years. Although children have acquired a massive body of language skills at\nthat age, it makes sense to believe that just like language skills the acquisition of perceptual\nskills is also subject to ongoing learning, and, furthermore, that both vital functions evolve in\nparallel and interact with each other throughout the life span. More specifically, we believe\nthat the abstraction process which underlies concepts and categories is also reflected in the\ndevelopment of children's sensitivity to perceive shape properties that are crucial for basic-\nlevel discrimination and abstraction (see Son et al 2008). However, before we can investigate\nthe interplay between language and visual perception, a good general description of shape\nperception is mandatory and in the next section we will devote a great deal of attention to a\ngeneral procedure to describe two-dimensional (2D) contour shape differences.\nDevelopment of differential shape sensitivity 123\n1.2 Within- and between-category shape changes\nWe will first describe our shape manipulations in the light of shape perception and object\nidentity. The most crucial information about shape is contained in the bounding contours\n(eg De Winter and Wagemans 2004; Feldman and Singh 2005). Closed contours can always\nbe transformed into any other closed contour through a smooth transformation. In line\nwith the generative approach by Leyton (1987) and the transformational approach by Graf\n(2002), and building on the mathematical framework of a hierarchy of transformations (Klein\n1939 [1872]), we can classify shape differences between any pair of contours in terms of\nthe transformations needed to match them (see also Todd et al 1998; Van Gool et al 1994;\nThe most general class of smooth transformations between two contours are topological\ntransformations. Some generic examples of topological transformations are illustrated in\nthe left-hand columns of figure 1. The direction of the arrows indicates the direction of the\ntransformations from one 2D vector space, the original image plane, towards another 2D\nvector space, the transformed image plane. As a consequence of the image transformations,\nthe contours deform in a specific manner in order to match the contours of the bowls\nonto the contours of the bottles and the contours of the cups onto the contours of the\npans. Projective transformations form a subgroup of the more general class of topological\ntransformations but they allow less freedom in matching two contours. They are perfectly\nsuitable for describing viewpoint differences between projections in the image plane from a\nthree-dimensional solid shape. Similarly, affine transformations form a subgroup embedded\nin the more general class of projective transformations. A contour match through affine\ntransformations is far from trivial and succeeds only for specific pairs of contours like the\nexamples illustrated in the right-hand columns of figure 1. The arrows represent the direction\nof the image transformation that is needed to match the bowl, bottle, cup, and pan on the left\nto the more sheared bowl, bottle, cup, and pan on the right. Finally, within the class of affine\ntransformations, metric transformations form a subgroup that is able to match identical\nshaped contours that differ only in orientation and position in the image plane (including\nreflections).\nWhen two objects are matched through a metric transformation, they are often inter-\npreted as identical images. A match in affine and projective transformations leads to object\npairs that are often conceived as identical objects or objects belonging to the same basic-\nlevel class. Also, some minor nonlinear topological transformations can create variation\nthat is still allowed in the same basic-level category. More generally, however, topological\ndeformations often lead to interpretations of objects belonging to different basic-level\nclasses--for example, like the left-hand columns in figure 1. In sum, the more constrained the\ngeometric freedom for matching two shapes, the more likely that two images are interpreted\nas similar objects (see also Feldman 2009). This proposal relates also to similar notions from\nbiologists who attempted to describe variations of form within and between different kinds\nWe should add two cautionary notes at this point. First, when we are referring to\ntopological transformations in this paper, we do not imply to make use of all degrees\nof freedom which are generally allowed by them (making all closed contours without\nholes essentially equivalent). We just want to refer to the larger class of transformations\ncontaining both the linear and nonlinear transformations. Second, by suggesting a rough\ncorrespondence between linear versus nonlinear shape transformations and within- versus\nbetween-category shape differences, we do not claim to have solved the deep and difficult\nquestion as to when exactly a nonlinear transformation (or a linear one for that matter)\nactually creates a shape change which is going to be perceived as a qualitative or basic-level\ndistinction. We use our approach as a first approximation, but we leave a thorough and\ndetailed examination of this issue for future research.\nIn the present study we will focus on two groups of transformations: the topological\n(nonlinear) deformations to generate contour differences for objects belonging to different\nbasic-level categories and the affine (linear) transformations to generate instances for objects\nbelonging to the same basic-level class. Note that the aim of describing shape differences\nthrough transformations is not to present a new theory on visual processing; rather, the aim\nof the introduced approach is to provide a general description of shape differences relevant\nfor many theories of visual processing. Indeed, many views of visual processing and shape\ndescriptions can be related to the invariants emerging from the transformational approach.\nIn the next section we will highlight some correspondences with some eminent theories on\nvisual processing.\nFigure 1. Examples of topological deformations (two columns on the left) and affine transformations\n(two columns on the right) between and within bowls and bottles (upper two rows), and between and\nwithin cups and pans (bottom two rows). The contours are derived from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart\ngrids shows how the space transforms from a straight rectangular grid into a nonrectangular grid.\nDeformation was accomplished through the thin plate spline procedure (Bookstein 1989; see appendix\nA). Note that the horizontal pairs depict contours from the same basic-level category, while the vertical\npairs show stimuli from different basic-level categories. Note also that each set of four contours on the\nleft is exactly the same as the corresponding four contours on the right.\n1.3 Planar transformations and theories on visual processing\nIn addition to being grounded in solid mathematical work, the distinction between affine\nand topological invariants also seems to correspond quite naturally to a number of relevant\nperceptual shape characteristics. First, it relates to the part-based view on object repre-\nsentations. Tversky (1989) found that 5-year olds detect missing parts faster when they\nbelong to the contour and when they affect shape (for the importance of parts in children's\nDevelopment of differential shape sensitivity 125\ncategorization, see also Rakison and Butterworth 1998). In structural description models\nsuch as Biederman's (1987) recognition-by-components (RBC) theory, object representations\nconsist of structural relations among volumetric parts. Objects are perceived by first analyzing\nthem into their volumetric constituents and then matching their configuration to memory\nrepresentations. The broader class of deformations depicted in the left-hand columns of\nfigure 1 can create new parts (eg a bowl consisting of one-part transforms into a bottle\nconsisting of two parts), while the linear transformations preserve the same kind and number\nof parts. The distinction between these two kinds of shape changes therefore seems to\ntake into account the importance of parts that are visible along the contour for category\nmembership.\nSecond, in Biederman's (1987) RBC theory, a distinction is also made between changes\nof metric properties of shape primitives (eg length, angle) and changes of so-called\nnonaccidental properties (NAPs) (eg symmetry, parallelism). In order to derive the basic\nprimitives quickly and robustly from the input images, some shape changes are treated in\na dichotomous or categorical way by the visual system (Kukkonen et al 1996; Wagemans\nand the edges can be straight or curved, parallel or not parallel, elongated or not elongated,\netc. It is obvious from figure 1 that the planar linear transformations preserve most of these\nNAPs (eg the edges of the bottle will be parallel and the axis will be straight for all exemplars\ncreated by affine transformations), while the nonlinear transformations cause categorical\nshape differences (eg from straight to curved lines, from parallel to nonparallel). The linear\ntransformations all preserve affine shape properties such as parallelism and straightness,\nwhile the broader class of topological transformations destroy such properties generally (eg\nstraight lines can become curved). In a recent study Kayaert and Wagemans (2010) have\nshown that infants and toddlers are more sensitive to categorical shape changes (eg the\ntransformation of a trapezium into a triangle) than to metric shape changes (eg changing the\naspect ratio of the shapes). Here, we extend this to much more subtle shape changes applied\nto more complex shapes, and tested with older children.\nThird, in a series of approaches (eg Bhatt et al 2006; Biederman 1987; De Winter and\nvisual system tracks the shape boundary and searches for concave regions and discontinuities\nalong the edges of objects that are thought to be significant for part decomposition. Such a\nmechanism for signaling the part joints can be achieved from bottom-up information alone\nand does not need any knowledge beforehand about the object and its part composition.\nA recent study from our laboratory demonstrated that points of maximal curvature along\nthe concave regions of the boundary are marked more easily as salient when the boundary\nmakes a sharp turn in a point and when the 2D part connected to the point is less compact\nand sticks out more (De Winter and Wagemans 2008). Furthermore, recognition speed for\nfragmented contours showed an early advantage in closure of contour fragments when\nthe presented fragments were located away from salient points (easier to view part shape),\nwhereas a converse advantage was found in later matching processes when the fragments\nwere located around salient points that could signal the part structure of the object (Panis\nand Wagemans 2009; Panis et al 2008a). Points of maximal curvature along the boundary are\npreserved for all variants of linear image transformations, while salient points are not always\npreserved among nonlinear image transformations. It should be noted that salient points\nare important not only in part-based theories of object recognition but also in theories of\ncontinuous shape spaces and holistic views (eg B\u00fclthoff and Edelman 1992; Edelman 1999).\nMoreover, the specific transformation procedure using thin plate splines (see methods and\nappendix A) makes use of a measure called bending energy which can be interpreted as a\nmeasure of similarity between different shapes in a shape space (see Edelman 1999).\nIn sum, the dichotomous shape manipulation that is presented here can embrace many\nfeatures that are believed to be of psychological importance in object recognition and\nalthough different theories on visual processing propose different crucial properties, they\nare all structurally related to each other.\n1.4 The present study\nIn the present study we investigate how shape sensitivity for two kinds of shape dissimilarities\ndevelops in young children: one kind of shape dissimilarity (see figure 1, left-hand two\ncolumns, changes in the vertical direction) can be related to shape differences between\nbasic-level categories, while the other kind of shape transition (see figure 1, right-hand two\ncolumns, changes in the horizontal direction) is rather generally restricted within a basic-level\nclass. As young children develop an impressive vocabulary and name objects preferably at\nthe basic level of abstraction, we expected that the use of basic-level abstractions should lead\nto an increase in sensitivity for relevant shape properties that are helpful for making these\ndistinctions in everyday life. That is, we predicted a more profound increase in sensitivity\nfor shape dissimilarities between members of different basic-level classes compared with\nshape dissimilarities between members of the same basic-level class. In other words, we\ninvestigated the influence of categorization on the development of shape perception.\nThe task we used was a delayed match-to-sample task using a single shape as target and\ntwo shapes (one identical and one similar) as test pair. The shape which was similar to the\ntarget shape was derived from it by one of the transformations of interest. The two shape\nclasses involved in the experiment are labeled LIN (see figure 1 and figure 2), referring to the\nlinear behavior of the planar grid for affine transformations, and NONLIN1, referring to the\nnonlinear behavior of the image grid for the broader class of topological transformations.\nA third shape class involved a more intense nonlinear transformation of the image plane\nconsisting of the shape differences combining the LIN and NONLIN shape differences.\nAlthough such a combination is also a nonlinear transformation, in order to distinguish it\nfrom the second class, NONLIN1, we referred to this class by the label NONLIN2. Hence,\nin the delayed match-to-sample task, children viewed a target stimulus followed by two\nsimultaneously presented stimuli located at random positions on the screen. One of the\ntwo stimuli consisted of the target, while the second stimulus consisted of a distracter\ncreated from three possible transformations: LIN, NONLIN1, or NONLIN2. In short, we\nmeasured children's ability to differentiate shapes defined by their contour at various ages\nand estimated the developmental trend for the three types of shape differences.\nEighty-one children between the ages of 3.2 and 7.1 participated in the study (mean 4.90, SD\n0.98). They were recruited from two schools in two communities near Antwerp in Belgium\n(Laerhof in Merksem and De Vlinder in Brasschaat). Participation was voluntary and the study\nwas conducted according to the American Psychological Association's guidelines (including\ninformed consent procedure). We focused on the age between 3 and 7 because vocabulary\ncontinues to develop rapidly at that age and children are identifying objects regularly by their\nbasic-level class nouns. Additionally, they already have the capability to participate in an\nexperiment that looks like a computer game.\nThree stimulus pairs were selected from our set of outlines (Wagemans et al 2008) derived\nfrom the Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) set: lamp and wineglass, bottle and guitar, and\nDevelopment of differential shape sensitivity 127\ndoll and ostrich (see figure 2, upper two rows). In addition, there were three artificial stimulus\npairs created by the addition of multiple line fragments randomly selected from contours\nof the Snodgrass and Vanderwart set. The additions of two successive line fragments were\ncarried out in such a way that the curvature in the joints was limited and smooth (almost\nstraight). The variable that distinguishes between these two kinds of contours (existing versus\nnonexisting) was labeled KIND.\nWarping algorithms are usually carried out on landmarks and these landmarks are chosen\ncomputationally or subjectively in correspondence to what someone believes to be important\ncorresponding points for matching two sets. For dissimilar contours of objects from different\nbasic-level categories, no satisfactory criteria are possible for choosing landmarks that\ncorrespond to each other (which is the reason why previous studies focusing on continuous\nshape changes working with real-world object contours were limited to within-category\n1500 locations on equidistant positions along the perimeter of the contour. Subsequently, we\ndetermined the corresponding points between a pair of to-be-matched contours by applying\nan alignment algorithm that minimizes the total Euclidean distances between corresponding\npoints and that is invariant for Euclidean similarity transformations (Marques and Abrantes\n1997). By choosing equidistant points on the contour and by matching the order of the\ncorresponding points in the most optimal way, the deformation appeared as a smooth 2D\ntopological transformation.\nA so-called pair of thin plate splines (PTPS) (Bookstein 1989) was used to match the\ntwo sets of 1500 counted contour points. Appendix A contains more technical details of the\nwarping procedure; here we sketch the main aspects of the procedure. The PTPS procedure\ndisentangles the deformation into an affine transformational component before initiating\na nonlinear deformation of the image plane. By means of an iterative procedure, affine\ntransformations were computed by the PTPS procedure and carried out partly in each step\nin order to obtain two contours for which the new PTPS affine component approached\nthe identity matrix. In other words, the PTPS procedure was actually used to obtain two\ncontours for which the affine component of the whole transformation was filtered out. The\ntwo modified contours served as target\u00addistracter pair for the condition NONLIN1 as they\ndid not involve any linear transformation between the sets of contour points (ie the two\nleft stimuli in each set of four, constituting one of six panels in figure 2). The modified\ncontour pairs within each set of four were then submitted to one custom chosen affine\ntransformation.(1) The affine transformations applied on the two modified contours created\ntwo new contours that formed the second pair in the condition NONLIN1 (ie the two right-\nhand stimuli in each panel of figure 2). The upper two and the lower two contours in each set\nof four constituted the target\u00addistracter pair for the condition LIN. In the condition NONLIN2\nwe paired the stimuli in each set that had linear and nonlinear planar shape differences (ie\nupper left and bottom right, upper right and bottom left in each set of figure 2).\nWe started with a preliminary pilot experiment (N = 7) to develop stimulus pairs for which\n3-to-7-year olds had comparable sensitivity for the LIN and NONLIN1 target\u00addistracter\npairs. The morphing distance between NONLIN1 pairs was adapted to obtain comparable\n(1) Regular affine transformations were chosen, such as a change in aspect ratio or a shear. The\naffine transformations chosen for each of the six panels, from left to right and from top to bot-\ntom in figure 2 were\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n, and\n\n\n\n, respectively.\nFigure 2. The stimuli that are used in the experiment after matching for their discriminability between\nLIN pairs (horizontal pairs) and NONLIN1 pairs (vertical pairs). Unlike figure 1, the coordinate\ntransformations are illustrated only for the NONLIN1 pairs. The diagonal pairs in each set were used\nin the NONLIN2 target\u00addistracter pairs. The upper three panels are derived from existing objects\n(lamp\u00adwineglass, bottle\u00adguitar, doll\u00adostrich); the lower three panels are assembled contour fragments\nfrom the Snodgrass and Vanderwart set constituting nonexisting objects.\nsensitivity between the LIN and the NONLIN1 pairs. Especially in the doll\u00adostrich set, we\nneeded to reduce the morphing distance substantially for the NONLIN1 pairs leading to\nstimuli that resemble the initial doll and ostrich stimulus from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart\nset to a lesser extent. In Kayaert and Wagemans (2010), metric (LIN) and categorical\n(NONLIN1) shape differences were matched for pixel dissimilarity and toddlers were much\nmore sensitive to the categorical shape differences. Here, by adjusting psychophysically\nthe absolute differences in sensitivity between the LIN and NONLIN1 pairs, we can focus\nbetter on the differences between the developmental trends for the LIN and NONLIN1\nshape differences when both trends are in each other's neighborhood with respect to overall\ndifficulty level.\nThe task was embedded in a game-like animation which contained a colored landscape with\na large white cloud as a natural part of the scene (see figure 3). This white cloud served as\nthe place holder for the stimulus shapes. An experimental trial began with the presentation\nof a blank cloud for 1000 ms followed by the target outline for 1000 ms presented in the\nmiddle of the cloud. An attentional cue in the form of a blue circle enclosing the target and a\nringing sound was added during the target presentation to capture the attention of the child.\nThe target interval was followed by a blank cloud for 1000 ms, and, subsequently, the two\noutlines (target\u00addistracter pair) were displayed at random positions inside the cloud. The\nchild was instructed to select the target outline between the two alternatives and responded\nby touching the chosen outline on a touch screen. The alternatives stayed on the screen until\nthe child responded. In the landscape an ascending hill was also pictured. A correct answer\nresulted in an upward jump of a kangaroo that could reach the top of the hill in seven jumps.\nAn incorrect answer had no effect on the animated kangaroo. When one kangaroo reached\nDevelopment of differential shape sensitivity 129\nthe top, a new kangaroo in a different color started at the base of the hill. The children tried to\nlead as many kangaroos as possible to the top of the hill by pointing out the correct contour\nfrom two alternatives.\nFigure 3. An example of a trial.\nEach child (N = 81) received two successive blocks of seventy-two trials and a pause of 5\nmin in between. The target\u00addistracter trials of existing and nonexisting objects were mixed\nand presented in random order. In each set of four outlines in figure 2, there were two LIN\npairs, two NONLIN1 pairs, and two NONLIN2 pairs. Within each block, each pair from each\nset was presented two times for which each outline served exactly one time as target stimulus.\nNote that all outlines were equally often involved in each condition as target and distracter\nbecause they were members of exactly one LIN pair, one NONLIN1 pair, and one NONLIN2\npair. Two presentations for six pairs of six sets makes seventy-two trials in each experimental\nblock.\nThe experiments were conducted on a Microtouch 3M Inc., 15-inch touch screen and a\nPentium IV 3.2 GHz computer. The experiment was programed in Eprime 1.3 and the stimuli\nThe delayed match-to-sample task was modeled by the ABX design in signal detection\ntheory (Macmillan and Creelman 2005). The advantage of transforming proportion-correct\nresponses into d' is the model-based possibility of comparing performances across different\nvalues of a physical linear sensitivity scale. Within a subject we measured six performance\nlevels, corresponding to the conditions LIN, NONLIN1, and NONLIN2, for existing and\nnonexisting objects, respectively.\nTo analyze the data we used the method of locally weighted regression or LOESS procedure\nplots, local linear fitting was used with a weight function specified by the tricube function.\nThis regression method uses similar assumptions as ordinary linear regression methods. To\ncompare the contribution of the variable KIND, we first aggregated the data of the existing\nand nonexisting shapes and we applied the LOESS procedure searching for the most optimal\nsmoothing parameter. Subsequently, we applied the LOESS procedure for the existing and\nnonexisting datasets separately by using the same smoothing parameter. We compared the\nresidual sum of squares for both procedures by means of an F-test. The results are displayed\nin table 1.\nTable 1. Existing versus nonexisting shapes (KIND).

However, by adding this variable in the experimental design, we are more confident that\nthe association between contours and former acquired category representations for existing\nobjects could play only a minor role in the discrimination of two contours. Naturally, children\nlearn specific shape properties that go together with specific categories like, for instance,\nthe shape of a dog tail or the shape of table legs. The aim of the study was to investigate\nabstract category-related shape properties like, for instance, strong concave regions in the\ncontour that can signal the existence of an important part for category ownership. When\nperceptual learning would involve only specific category-related properties, then a difference\nin sensitivity should be noticed between existing and nonexisting contour differences.\nAbstract shape properties are not explicitly related to one particular category but involve\nimportant a priori shape information before specific characteristics can be processed. When\nchildren learn to perceive abstract shape properties more successfully, then sensitivity should\ntransfer to nonexisting objects as well, as indeed was the case.\nIn a second series of analyses we applied the LOESS procedure to conduct tests on finding\ndifferences in sensitivity between the different sorts of shape differences. In the first column\nof table 2 the two sorts of shape differences that were compared are displayed. We used the\nLOESS procedure one time for the aggregated data of the two kinds of shape differences. The\nsame smoothing parameters were used a second time when applying the LOESS procedure\nfor each sort of shape difference separately.\nDevelopment of differential shape sensitivity 131\nTable 2.

Observations are depicted with empty circles.\nIn figure 4 we plotted the estimated curves separately with optimal smoothing parameters\naccording to the LOESS procedure in SAS with default settings. A larger smoothing parameter\nneeds fewer free parameters for curve fitting and LOESS reduces the smoothing parameter\nonly on condition that more variations can be captured in correspondence with Akaike's\nrespectively.

For each curve, a two-tailed 95% confidence interval was plotted in the same color\nas the trend lines. When there was no overlap between confidence intervals, the red, green,\nand blue (RGB) colors were used; when two or three confidence intervals did overlap, we\nused the mixture of the initial colors in the RGB color palette. The confidence intervals are\nwider at both ends of the trend lines because the smoothing windows take fewer measures\ninto account at the endings.\nFor the linear topological transformations, we found nearly a linear increase in sensitivity\nby age. In all plots we see that the NONLIN1 and NONLIN2 lines show a steeper increase\nin sensitivity compared with the LIN line starting around 4.5 years of age and becoming\nsignificantly different from the LIN line around 5.4 years of age. Qualitatively, the NONLIN1\nFigure 5.

Indeed, the NONLIN2 line represents sensitivity\nfor shape differences resulting from topological transformations just like the NONLIN1 line,\nand therefore it is not surprising that both curve paths are more or less parallel to each other.\nAdding the linear (affine) component seemed to have introduced only a constant additive\nincrease in sensitivity compared with the NONLIN1 line, although they are not significantly\ndifferent from each other.\nAll fitted curves in figure 5 seem to level off in the older age region suggesting a ceiling\neffect. However, because the curves level off at different d' levels, the scoring limits of the\ntask itself cannot cause the leveling off of the curves. It is rather a property of the different\nkinds of shape transformations, and, more specifically, it probably indicates different limits\nof extracting information from shape differences which are causing different asymptotes.\n4 Discussion\nWe found a sharper increase in sensitivity for the nonlinear topological transformation\naround 4.5 to 5 years of age compared with the linear topological transformations (affine\ntransformations) of the image plane. In general, the results provide evidence for an influence\nfrom object categorization on perceptual shape processing skills during development\u00ad\u00adthat\nis, children become more sensitive to the kind of shape differences that account for basic-\nlevel distinctions, and therefore become better experts in object recognition at the basic\nlevel of category ownership. The findings suggest that the shape differences that are useful\nto differentiate objects at the basic level of category ownership become more dominant in\ndevelopment. This is a plausible conclusion in the light of evolutionary functional needs\nas, for example, differentiating between a snake and a cow is probably more important\nthan differentiating between a shorter and a longer snake. Experience in categorization and\nrecognition might lead to a differentiation between relevant and irrelevant properties in\nshape perception at the most common level of abstraction, the basic level (Jolicoeur et al\n1984). Children might learn that they become more efficient when they omit the irrelevant\nshape differences (in the current study the planar linear transformations) in order to increase\ntheir capacity for more relevant salient properties like the proposed topological deformations\nDevelopment of differential shape sensitivity 133\nthat can account for some shape differences between different kinds. This view corresponds\nargued that abstraction is in part simplification and enables generalization because it requires\nthe removal of irrelevant information. Similarly, shape perception also involves abstraction\nof shape properties. Children learn to process shape better in respect to their functional\nneeds by abstracting shape properties like strong concave contour segments that signal the\nexistence of a characteristic features. Moreover, the lack of a difference between existing\nand nonexisting contours demonstrates that they have acquired a perceptual sensitivity for\ngenerically relevant shape features, not specific object features associated with one particular\ncategory.\nShape differences have been described by a transformational approach (Graf 2002, 2006).\nHowever, within the transformational framework there are an infinite number of possibilities\nto match two different shape configurations and the procedures differ in their criteria to\ntransform the space in the most optimal way. We adopted a computer vision algorithm, a\nPTPS (Bookstein 1989), and applied it to human perception for the creation of two different\nshape dimensions that we administered to young children in a behavioral research paradigm.\nWe showed in the introduction that this approach can capture many structural features\nthat are believed to be of importance in previous studies on visual processing. There are, of\ncourse, many more algorithms in computer vision that might provide a shape description\nthat captures many important features in human perception. A challenge from a vision\nscience perspective is to find a particular procedure that corresponds to the human mode\nof perceiving shape differences in magnitude and in shape kind. Such a procedure would\neventually lead to a parametric shape space that can serve as a mental shape space of\nsimilarity in humans to model categorization and identification (for similarity spaces, see eg\nIn a recent study it has been shown that categorization training in a laboratory context can\naffect perceived shape similarity related to specific category formations and its underlying\nspecific shape representations in the human lateral occipital cortex (see Gillebert et al 2009;\nPanis et al 2011). The current results add to this finding that abstract shape differences\nreflecting the class of overall shape properties between categories in everyday life affect\nperceptual discriminability too. More often than not, visual perception and language\ndevelopment are treated in separate fields of research. Nevertheless, both different aspects\nof human behavior seem to be involved in a dynamic interplay. Some studies demonstrate\nthat different shape kinds are innate or present very early in development (eg Haaf et al 2003;\nKayaert and Wagemans 2010; Quinn 2002), but within the present experimental context\nchildren's perceptual sensitivity seems to continue to develop between the ages of 3 and\n7. Moreover, the curves fitted to the data suggested a rather abrupt increase in sensitivity\nfor the nonlinear transformation relevant for basic-level distinctions and a rather steady\nincrease for the linear transformations. This is consistent with the hypothesized relevance of\nthe nonlinear type of transformation for distinctions between objects belonging to different\nbasic-level categories, which is developmentally quite important for learning different object\nclasses and their names.\n"
