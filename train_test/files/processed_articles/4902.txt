This study\nassessed what Togolese educated women know about cervical cancer and the accuracy of their knowledge. It also examined\nthe factors that correlate with accurate knowledge among the women. This study, like its previous ones, pointed out the lack\nof accurate knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors among educated women in Togo. However, unlike the earlier studies,\nit showed the beliefs and thoughts of educated women with regard to cervical cancer knowledge and explained some of the\ninaccuracies of the beliefs. It also showed the necessity of educating Togolese women, even the educated ones, about cervical\ncancer and its risk factors as these women hold inaccurate knowledge about the disease. Ideally, screening for cervical cancer\nis the primary means to control it. However, in an environment where screening is not readily available and accessible,\nknowledge of cervical cancer risk factors may aid women to change behaviors that put them at risk. Although health officials\nmay have their own priorities, it is very important to know that cervical cancer is a public health issue, which could be curbed.\n",

In fact, the age-standardized incidence rate of\ncervical cancer in sub-Saharan Africa is one of the highest in\n(Ferlay, Bray, Pisani, & Parkin, 2004). Although both cervi-\ncal cancer incidence and mortality rates have seen significant\ndecline in the developed world where 63% of women are\nscreened, this is not the case in developing countries.\nGakidou, Nordhagen, and Obermeyer (2008) reported that\nonly around 19% of women in developing countries had a\npap smear in the 3 years prior to the survey. Knowledge of\ncervical cancer risk factors and particularly knowledge of its\nstrong relationship to human papillomavirus (HPV), inde-\npendent of other factors (Bosch, Lorincz, Munoz, Meijer, &\nShah, 2002), have helped to combat this cancer in developed\ncountries through massive cervical cancer screening pro-\ngrams. This study examined knowledge of cervical cancer\nrisk factors among educated women in Lom\u00e9, Togo. The fol-\nlowing questions guided this research: (a) What do educated\nTogolese women know about cervical cancer? (b) How accu-\nrate is their knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors? and\n(c) What are the factors that correlate with accurate knowl-\nedge of cervical cancer risk factors? Although cervical can-\ncer screening is the best preventive method for cancer\nreduction, in an environment such as Togo, where health care\nis a significant challenge for the average citizen and screen-\ning programs are nonexistent, we believe that knowledge of\ncervical cancer risk factors will be necessary and beneficial\nfor women who may ultimately choose to change their risk\nbehaviors to minimize the odds of cervical cancer.\nThere are several risk factors for cervical cancer. Cervical\ncancer is commonly linked to sexual behaviors and risk fac-\ntors, such as unprotected sex, having multiple sexual part-\nners, and having a partner who has/had multiple sexual\npartners (Bosch et al., 2002; Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis,\nSTD, and TB Prevention, Division of STD Prevention, 2013;\nCooper et al., 2007).

Research has also\nshown that diet has an impact on the development of cervical\ncancer (Shannon et al., 2002). Poverty is another risk factor\nbecause women of lower socio-economic status have higher\nrates of incidence of cervical cancer (American Cancer\nSociety, 2013a; Teitelman, Stringer, Averbuch, & Witkoski,\nSingh, Miller, Hankey, & Edwards, 2004). Also, use of an\nintrauterine device (IUD) might act as a protective co-factor\nagainst the development of the disease (Castellsagu\u00e9 et al.,\n2011). Although cervical cancer itself is not hereditary, stud-\nies have reported that genetics may offer some insights into\nwhy some cases of HPV develop into cancer, while others do\nAlso linked to cervical cancer is exposure to diethylstilbes-\ntrol (DES), a hormone prescribed to pregnant women\nSmoking is another risk factor (Brinton et al., 1986; Hall,\nage at first sex and early age at first pregnancy have also\nbeen found to increase risk of cervical cancer (Louie, de\nSanjose, & Mayaud, 2009). Similarly, although some\nresearchers have suggested a causal relationship between\nlong-term use of oral contraceptives and cervical cancer\n(Smith et al., 2003), there has been some controversy over\nthese findings (Miller, Blumenthal, & Blanchard, 2004).\nHowever, all of these factors are recognized by the American\nIn the United States, recent studies have mainly examined\nwomen's awareness of cervical cancer with regard to HPV\nvirus and Pap smear testing. They reported low rates of\nknowledge of HPV causing cervical cancer and cervical can-\ncer risk factors (Baer, Allen, & Braun, 2000; Denny-Smith,\nTiro, Meissner, Kobrin, & Chollette, 2007).Also, studies that\nspecifically examined knowledge of cervical cancer risk fac-\ntors from around the world have shown low levels of knowl-\nedge in general. In Turkey, for example, Yanikkerem, Goker,\nPiro, Dikayak, and Koyuncu (2013) found that women had\ngenerally moderate knowledge that sexual behavior is related\nto risk of developing cervical cancer. In Ethiopia, Getahun,\nMazengia, Abuhay, and Birhanu (2013) found that more that\n78% of the 633 women they studied had heard of cervical\ncancer, yet only around 30% could name a risk factor for the\ndisease. In a recent study in Nigeria, around 40% of study\nparticipants (n = 360) were aware of cervical cancer, and\naround 30% knew that it was preventable. However, only\n0.6% had ever been screened (Eze, Umeora, Obuna,\nEgwuatu, & Ejikeme, 2012). In South Africa, Wellensiek,\nMoodley, Moodley, and Nkwanyana (2002) also reported\nthat socio-demographic factors played a role in knowledge of\nrisk factors. Participants from lower socio-economic back-\ngrounds were less likely to be aware of cervical cancer\nscreening.\nSetting\nTogo is a small Western African country with an estimated\nTogolese population was living in poverty in 2006\n(International Monetary Fund [IMF], 2008). Literacy rate\nWorld Bank Group, 2013). Formal education in Togo has a\npyramid shape whereby the number of pupils decreases as\nthe level of education increases. In addition, there are great\ndisparities between the number of females and males who\nattend school, and the differences become even more sig-\nnificant as one goes up the educational attainment ladder.\nstudents in Grades 7 to 10, but decreased to 40% for stu-\ndents in Grades 11 to 13 (Education Policy and Data Center,\n2012). Even a fewer number of women enroll and obtain a\nhigher education.\nCervical cancer is the second most common cancer among\nTogolese women. It was estimated that every year around\nfrom it (World Health Organization [WHO]/Institut Catal\u00e0\nd'Oncologia [ICO], HPV Information Center, 2014).\nHowever, note that women who do not seek modern medical\ncare may not be included in these numbers. In addition, a\nstudy on the general knowledge of cancer risk factors among\nTogolese reported low knowledge (Moore, 2013). In such an\nenvironment, we thought that targeting women with a higher\nlevel of education (university level of education) is war-\nranted as these women represent a special group of people\nand also education tends to significantly correlate with accu-\nrate knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors (Getahun et\nHealth care in Togo, just like in most developing coun-\ntries, is a substantial task given limited available resources.\nAlthough some improvements have been made in the past\nfew decades, mortality is still high in general, and women's\nhealth is still problematic (WHO, 2011). Affordability of\nhealth care services is another challenge. In fact, about 35%\nof Togolese have problems paying for medical prescriptions\n2014). Although urban dwellers may have a better access to\nhealth care services relative to rural residents, childhood\nmalnutrition, maternal health, and women's health are some\nurgent areas of health that need improvement in Togo regard-\nless of setting (The World Bank Group, 2014).\nMethod\nData Collection and Procedure\nA cross-sectional survey of 97 educated women was con-\nducted in Lom\u00e9, Togo, from October to December, 2012.\nThe study protocol was approved by the University of North\nTexas Institutional Review Board. The questionnaire was\noriginally in English and translated into French, the official\nMoore and Driver 3\nlanguage of Togo. The first author, with the help of a trained\nTogolese woman who had experience in data collection\nmethods, collected the data. We recruited women who were\nuniversity students or have graduated from university. The\nsurvey took on average 25 min. Participants were paid an\nParticipants were asked to freely list the risk factors for\ncervical cancer that they knew and explain the reasons why\nthey thought those factors were risk factors. Then, they were\npresented a list of established risk factors for cervical cancer\n(American Cancer Society, 2013) and were asked whether or\nnot these factors were risk factors. Questions about estab-\nlished risk factors for cervical cancer included the following\n11 factors: (a) HPV, (b) use of oral contraceptive, (c) multi-\nparity, (d) age, (e) sexually transmitted infections (STIs), (f)\nsmoking, (g) multiple sexual partners, (h) early sexual initia-\ntion, (i) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), (j) use of oral\ncontraceptives, and (k) cancer history in family. The women\nhad three options to choose from: \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"don't\nknow.\" These were later regrouped in two categories: \"Yes\"\n= accurate knowledge and \"Don't know\" and \"No\" = inac-\ncurate knowledge. In addition, they were asked whether they\nknew about Pap smear test and had ever had the test. Also,\nthey were asked whether they would like to be tested if Pap\nsmear test was readily available and accessible in Togo.\nData Analysis\nWe first presented all the risk factors that participants listed\nin a frequency distribution table (Table 2). Second, we then\ntranslated verbatim participants' explanations of why they\nthought their listed factors were risk factors. Third, the expla-\nnations were then analyzed and grouped according to each\nrisk factor. We also created a frequency distribution of par-\nticipants' knowledge of each of the established risk factors\n(Table 3). Fourth, we created a variable (knowledge scores)\nthat captured participants' knowledge of the established risk\nfactors as done by Ralston et al. (2003). Each knowledge\nscore is the number of risk factors a participant correctly\nidentified ranging from 0 (none correctly identified) to 11\n(all correctly identified). A multiple linear regression analy-\nsis was conducted in which knowledge of cervical cancer\nrisk factors was assessed controlling for participants' demo-\ngraphic, sexual history, and Pap smear knowledge variables.\nThe results are found in Table 4.\nResults\nSample\nThe women who participated in this study were all residents\nof Lom\u00e9, the capital city of Togo. Table 1 reports the descrip-\ntive statistics for the sample of 97 educated women who par-\nticipated in this study. The majority of the women were in\ncollege and university in Lom\u00e9 at the time of the study. The\nyears. They had 15.40 mean years of education. They were\nmostly unmarried (80%). They reported a mean number of\nabout 2 (1.98) lifetime sexual partners with a range of 1 to 6\npartners. Although 17% of the women had exchanged sex for\nvaluable resources, 18% had ever had a sexually transmitted\ninfection. Also, 74% of the women reported having had sex\nwithin the past 6 months of the study. Only 30% of the sam-\nple knew about Pap smear testing, but even fewer women\nhad ever had the test (8%). They all agreed that they would\nvolunteer for a Pap smear test to make sure they did not have\ncervical cancer if the test was readily available and\naffordable.\nKnowledge of Cervical Cancer Risk Factors\nStudy participants listed what they thought were cervical\ncancer risk factors. Lack of personal hygiene (including poor\nsanitation, poor sexual hygiene, and washing with dirty\nwater), botched induced abortions, and STIs were the top\nTable 1.

However, as shown in Table 2, the established risk factors\nsuch as having multiple sexual partners and early sexual ini-\ntiation were less listed. Some of the least listed risk factors\ninclude not having children, tumor in the breast, and mastur-\nbation. Ironically, HPV, the primary risk factor for cervical\ncancer, was not mentioned by any of the participants. This, in\nfact, shows the inaccuracy of the knowledge that our partici-\npants had regarding cervical cancer risk factors.\nParticipants' Explanations of Listed Risk Factors\nPoor personal hygiene.When asked to explain why they\nthought the listed factors were risk factors, participants gave\na variety of explanations. For instance, most of the women\nwho thought poor personal hygiene was a risk factor for cer-\nvical cancer expressed their views as shown in the following\ncomments. A 37-year old married woman who was a jour-\nnalist explained, \"When personal hygiene is not practiced,\nespecially around the genital area, microbes can enter the\nvagina and later cause cancer of the cervix.\"\nAnother respondent who was 49 years old, had 16 years\nof education, and was teaching at a high school simply\nexplained,\nA woman that lacks corporal hygiene and personal cleanliness\nof her clothing facilitate viruses to enter into her organism. The\norganism becomes weak and sick because cleanliness gives\nhealth and vigor to the body. And if a woman does not take care\nof herself (body), things become complicated and may lead to\ncervical cancer.\nTable 3.

Although it is true that cervical cancer is caused\nby a certain kind of virus (HPV), practicing proper hygiene\ndoes not shelter one from getting HPV if the risk factors such\nas having unprotected sex, having multiple sexual partners,\nand having a partner who had/has multiple sexual partners\nare present in one's life. This is important information that\nour study participants need to understand.\nInduced abortions.Some of the women who mentioned\ninduced abortions as a risk factor related it to infections. A\n26-year-old single woman with 15 years of education stated,\n\"Induced abortion create a disturbance for the uterus. And\nwhen abortions are botched, they cause huge infections that\nlead to cervical cancer.\" A college student with 15 years of\neducation also explained why she thought induced abortions\nare a risk factor for cervical cancer as follows: \"The cervix\ncan be infected during induced abortions. The infections\nhave to be well treated otherwise they later become the germs\nfor cervical cancer.\"\nThe comments above show another aspect of misconcep-\ntion that participants had about cervical cancer risk factors.\nNo study has linked induced abortions to cervical cancer.\nSexually transmitted infections.\nIn addition, participants\nreported that STIs were risk factors because when these\ninfections are not properly treated, they become cancerous. A\n24-year-old college student who had 15 years of education\nsimply explained, \"Improperly treated STIs become compli-\ncated and grave, and it degenerates in the worst case scenario\ninto cancer of the cervix.\" Another woman with 18 years of\neducation also reported, \"STIs are always dangerous for the\nfemale genital, and without the proper treatment can lead to\nfatal cervical cancer.\"\nOverall, participants had erroneous information about\ncervical cancer risk factors and hence their explanations\nwere inaccurate. There were a lot of misconceptions and\nhalf-truths. Although some were able to identify STIs as risk\nfactors, they mostly did not understand that HPV was the\nvirus that causes cervical cancer. Also, as shown in Table 2,\nbelieving that a lack of personal hygiene is a risk factor might\ngive these women a false sense of protection as some might\nadamantly practice personal cleanliness and then believed\nthat they were not at risk of getting cervical cancer. Also,\nthose who never had an induced abortion might falsely think\nthey were sheltered from getting cervical cancer. In addition,\ncontrary to some scientific studies, which reported that use\nof IUD may act as a protective factor against cervical cancer,\nsome of the participants thought the use of IUD is a risk fac-\ntor instead, as shown in the following comments. Safia, a\n25-year-old college student with 15 years of education\nexplained her belief, \"When IUDs are not properly main-\ntained, they accumulate microbes in the vagina and become\nsource of cancer.\" Carina, another college student, with 16\nyears of education also simply stated, \"having IUD in a\nwoman for months or a year can be a source of infection that\nmay lead to cervical cancer.\"\nIdentification of Established Risk Factors\nParticipants were given a list of the established risk factors\nand were asked whether or not these factors were risk fac-\ntors. There is also a variation in the proportions of partici-\npants who correctly identified an established cervical cancer\nrisk factor (Table 3). Only 4 of the 11 established risk factors\nwere accurately identified by most of the participants: STIs,\nmultiple sexual partners, HIV/AIDS, and multiparity.\nHowever, although almost 91% of the women correctly iden-\ntified STIs as a risk factor, only about 20% thought HPV was\na risk factor and was the least identified factor. Again, this\nshows that the educated women who we studied were poorly\nknowledgeable about HPV being the primary cause of cervi-\ncal cancer. Having multiple sexual partners was the second\nhighest identified risk factor (87.6%), followed by HIV/\nMultiple Linear Regression Results\nNext, before reporting the results of the multiple linear\nregression analysis of accurate knowledge of cervical cancer\nrisk factors, we presented some statistics on the knowledge\nscore. The knowledge score had a mean of 5.6 with a stan-\ndard deviation of 2.25 and a minimum of 1 and a maximum\nof 10. This means that although some participants were only\nable to correctly identify 1 risk factor, others were able to\ncorrectly identify 10 risk factors out of the 11 established\nfactors that were presented. The multiple regression analysis\nshowed that only two variables significantly affect knowl-\nedge of cancer risk factors among the educated women: age\nand years of education (Table 4). In fact, 1 year of education\nincreased the knowledge score by 0.694 whereas an addi-\ntional year in age increased a woman's knowledge of cervi-\ncal cancer risk factors by only 0.081. None of the other\nfactors significantly correlate with accurate knowledge of\ncervical cancer risk factors among study participants. In fact,\nthese results confirm the qualitative data presented earlier.\nDiscussion\nThis study attempts to assess what Togolese educated women\nknow about cervical cancer and the accuracy of their knowl-\nedge. It also examines the factors that correlate with accurate\nknowledge among the women. Cervical cancer is the second\nmost frequent cancer among women in Togo. It has a very\nwith cervical cancer die every year (WHO/ICO, HPV\nInformation Center, 2014). Also, oncology services are not\nonly cost prohibitive in Togo but also not supported by the\nhealth care infrastructure that was present at the time of the\n6 SAGE Open\nsurvey. Hence, Togolese who can afford cancer treatment\nusually go to the neighboring country of Ghana because\nTogo does not have cancer treatment facilities (International\nAtomic Energy Agency, 2008). Although early detection\nmakes a significant difference in cervical cancer as in other\ncancers, screening programs are unavailable in Togo. In such\nan environment, it is important for Togolese women to have\naccurate knowledge of cervical cancer risk factors to adopt\nhealthy behaviors that will help reduce their risks of acquir-\ning this cancer.\nKnowledge of cancer risk factors among the educated\nwomen sampled is low as found in other studies (Getahun et\nable to recognize and identify HPV as a risk factor. Also,\nmost of the women correctly identified only 4 of the 11\nestablished risk factors that were used for this study.Although\na significant proportion (91%) identified STIs as risk factors,\nthey were unable to explain how STIs facilitate HPV to\ndevelop into cervical cancer. None of the women listed HPV\nwhen asked to list cervical cancer risk factors.\nHowever, contrary to previous studies, because we asked\nthe women to explain the reasons for listing each of the fac-\ntors that they mentioned, we were able to see a pattern of\ncertain beliefs among them. First, some of the women\nbelieved that induced abortions are a risk factor, especially if\nthe abortion is not properly performed. The idea behind this\nbelief may stem from the fact that induced abortions are not\nperformed under safe conditions and lead to complications\nand even maternal deaths in Africa in general (Guttmacher\nInstitute, 2012). However, this belief of induced abortion as\na risk factor for cervical cancer is erroneous as no study has\nlinked cervical cancer to induced abortion. Second, some of\nour study participants associated cervical cancer with a lack\nof personal hygiene because they thought sanitary practices\npreclude one from getting the virus. This belief may have\ncome from the association of disease to germs, microbes, and\nviruses. Although there is an association between diseases\nand the different disease causing agents, cervical cancer is\nmainly caused by HPV, a sexually transmitted virus. Thus,\nthis shows substantial level of inaccuracy and misconception\nwith regard to cervical cancer risk factors, although the\nwomen we studied were quite educated compared with the\ngeneral population. In addition, contrary to some scientific\nthat reported that use of IUD may act as a protective factor\nagainst cervical cancer, some of the participants thought the\nuse of IUD is a risk factor instead.\nTo examine factors that correlate with cervical cancer risk\nfactors, we ran a multiple linear regression model. Results\nshow that only age and education positively correlate with\naccurate knowledge of the risk factors. We were surprised\nthat knowledge of Pap smear did not significantly correlate\nwith accurate knowledge as shown in other studies. However,\nit could be that some of the women just heard of the Pap\nsmear test; they did not know what it really does. Also, the\nresult could be explained by the fact that a very small percent\n(8%) had ever done the Pap smear.\nThere are a few issues that need to be mentioned about the\nstudy. There is a lack of firm evidence of causality as the data\nwere cross-sectionally collected. Also, findings may not be\ngeneralized to the whole Togolese population because a con-\nvenience sample was used. Finally, as any self-reported\nstudy, respondents may be biased in their responses because\nof social desirability. However, despite these limitations, we\nbelieve our study is important as it explains some of the\nbeliefs and thoughts of educated Togolese women about cer-\nvical cancer risk factors.\nThis study, unlike the previous ones, went beyond just\nascertaining accurate knowledge of cervical cancer among\neducated women. By asking the women to explain why their\nlisted factors were risk factors, we were able to fully under-\nstand misconceptions and half-truths about their knowledge.\nHence, as a first step, education programs about cervical can-\ncer risk factors are important to dispel these inaccurate\nbeliefs.Also, findings of this study may be relevant to women\nin other African countries as studies have indicated low level\nof knowledge in several countries such as Ethiopia (Getahun\n(Wellensiek et al., 2002). In addition, cervical cancer aware-\nness programs and campaigns must be carefully developed\nand must not assume accurate knowledge in any specific\nsubgroup if campaigns and programs are to be effective,\ngiven that educated women in our study had such inaccurate\nknowledgeoftheriskfactorsforcervicalcancer.Furthermore,\nwomen with different levels of education should be trained\nas opinion leaders who will diffuse the knowledge of cervi-\ncal cancer risk factors among their respective population\ngroups. As mentioned earlier, we understand that screening\nis the best approach to preventing cervical cancer; however,\nin most of low-income countries, including Togo, cervical\ncancer screening is not readily available and accessible to\nwomen, and hence, we believe that knowledge of cervical\ncancer risk factors will be beneficial in reducing risk behav-\niors among women.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAfrican Economic Outlook.
