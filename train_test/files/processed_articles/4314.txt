    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Functional respiratory imaging (FRI) uses three-dimensional models of human lungs\nand computational fluid dynamics to simulate functional changes within airways and predict the\ndeposition of inhaled drugs. This study used FRI to model the effects of different patient inhalation\nand drug formulation factors on lung deposition of an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting 2\n-agonist\n(ICS/LABA) combination, administered by a pressurized metered-dose inhaler.\nMethods: Three-dimensional models of the lungs of six patients with asthma (mean forced\nexpiratory volume in 1 s, 83%), treated with an ICS/LABA, were included. FRI modelling was\nused to simulate (1) the effects on lung deposition of inhalation duration and particle size [fine\nparticle fraction (FPF), proportion of particles <5 \u00b5m; and mass median aerodynamic diameter\n(MMAD), average size of inhalable particles]; (2) deposition of fluticasone propionate/formoterol\n(FP/FORM) 125/5 \u00b5g; and (3) how inhalation profiles and flow rates affected FP/FORM deposition.\nResults: Total lung depositions (TLDs) following 1-, 3- and 5-s inhalations were 22.8%, 36.1%\nand 41.6% (metered dose), respectively, and central-to-peripheral deposition (C:P) ratios were\n~36% at 40% FPF (metered dose); by contrast, MMAD had little effect on TLD, which was similar\nacross MMADs (1.5\u00ad4.5 \u00b5m) at each FPF. FP/FORM deposited throughout central and peripheral\nairways with gradual (sinusoidal) and sharp (rapid) inhalations. TLD ranged from 35.8 to 44.0%\n(metered dose) for gradual and sharp inhalations at 30 and 60 L/min mean flow rates.\nConclusions: These data provide important insights into the potential effects of inhalation\ncharacteristics (inhalation profile and duration) and aerosol formulation (FPF) on lung\ndeposition of inhaled therapies. FRI thus represents a useful alternative to scintigraphy\ntechniques. Future FRI studies will further our understanding of the deposition of inhaled\ndrugs and help improve the management of asthma.\n",

Nevertheless,\nthey remain an important and validated tool for\nresearchers, providing a time- and cost-effective\nmeans of predicting lung deposition under a\nrange of physiological conditions that may not\nalways be feasible to measure in vivo with\nscintigraphy.\nOne such technique is functional respiratory\nimaging (FRI), an advanced technology that\ncombines three-dimensional (3D) modelling of\nhuman lungs [taken from computerized tomog-\nraphy (CT) scans] with CFD, a branch of fluid\nmechanics that uses numerical analyses and\nalgorithms to simulate the motion of fluids and\ntheir interactions with surfaces. CFD is used in\nmany areas of research and design, such as in the\naviation, space and automotive industries, and is\nincreasingly being used in medical science (e.g.\nin the study of blood flow in cardiovascular dis-\neases).5 In respiratory medicine, FRI simula-\ntions, by combining CFD and 3D modelling\nfrom CT scans of patients' lungs, can predict\nhow changes in patient-specific anatomy (e.g.\nvariations in disease progression or treatment)\ncan impact on functional outcomes in the lungs,\nsuch as the deposition of inhaled drugs, or air-\nFRI allows precise manipulation of experimental\nconditions, including patient factors, and device\nand formulation characteristics, and therefore\nallows investigations that would be difficult or\nimpossible with in vivo techniques. Furthermore,\nmultiple assessments with different drug formula-\ntions can be made in the same patient's lungs,\nthereby controlling for anatomical differences,\nwhich would not be possible with in vivo scintig-\nraphy owing to the need to limit exposure to radio-\nactively labelled compounds. Patients would be\nexposed to multiple doses of radiation with in vivo\nlung scintigraphy (at least 2 mSv per exposure),\nwhereas a CT scan for FRI purposes results in a\nradiation dose of 1\u00ad3 mSv (lower than a regular\nCorrect inhaler technique is important to achieve\ngood asthma control.12 A study in patients with\nasthma who were treated with inhaled corticos-\nteroids (ICSs) administered via a pressurized\nmetered-dose inhaler (pMDI) showed that indi-\nviduals with an inadequate inhaler technique had\nless stable disease than those with a good tech-\nnique.13 Patients are advised to inhale slowly and\ndeeply when using a pMDI. The European\nRespiratory Society/International Society for\nAerosols in Medicine (ERS/ISAM) guidelines\nrecommend that patients should inhale for 4\u00ad5\ns,14 which should reduce the inhalation flow rate\nand allow more time to coordinate device actua-\ntion and inhalation. Many patients, however,\ninhale too quickly when using a pMDI.15 FRI\nallows the extent to which differences in inhala-\ntion duration and profile (e.g. different flow rates)\naffect lung deposition to be evaluated in detail.\nFormulation characteristics also affect lung depo-\nsition. Studies have suggested that a given dose of\nbeclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) delivered\nvia a hydrofluoroalkane (HFA)-based pMDI pro-\nvides the same degree of asthma control as 2.5\ntimes the BDP dose from a chlorofluorocarbon\n(CFC)-based inhaler.16,17 This is typically attrib-\nuted to the extrafine particle size formulation of\nHFA-based BDP18 compared with the larger par-\nticles of the CFC-based formulation, with a mass\nmedian aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of\n~1.3 \u00b5m or 4.3 \u00b5m, respectively. The two formu-\nlations also differ in their fine particle fraction\n(FPF; HFA-based BDP, 36%; CFC-based BDP,\n18%), which could contribute to the observed\ndifferences.18 The FPF is the proportion of the\ntotal dose comprising particles with a diameter\nsmaller than 5.0 m, including those that deposit\nin the `throat' of the apparatus; the calculation of\nMMAD excludes these particles, which usually\nconstitute the majority of the total dose. FRI\nallows the effects of variations in both MMAD\nand FPF on lung deposition to be assessed\nindependently.\nWe used FRI to investigate how variations in\ninhaler technique (such as inhalation duration and\nprofile) and formulation characteristics [such as\nparticle size (MMAD, FPF)] may influence the\nC Van Holsbeke, J De Backer et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 3\ndeposition of inhaled medications in the lungs.\nHere,wereportfindingsfromtheffluid(Fluticasone\npropionate/FormoteroL and improving our\nUnderstandIng of lung Deposition) study, which,\nto our knowledge, is the first study to use a series of\nFRI simulations to assess the effect of each of these\npatient and formulation factors independently on\nthe lung deposition of inhaled drugs, while keeping\nall other factors constant. The study involved 3D\nmodels of airways derived from six patients with\nasthma. It used theoretical models to evaluate the\neffects of inhalation duration and particle size\n(MMAD and FPF) on total and regional lung dep-\nosition for a representative pMDI. In addition, for\nthe first time, the study evaluated the total and\nregional lung deposition of a real-world HFA-based\npMDI formulation of fluticasone propionate/for-\nmoterol fumarate (FP/FORM; Flutiform\u00ae) and\nassessed how different inhalation profiles and flow\nrates affected its deposition. Overall, the study was\ndesigned to provide first theoretical insights into\nthe effects of specific formulation and patient char-\nacteristics on the deposition of inhaled drugs in the\nlungs, while keeping all other variables constant.\nMethods\nThe methodology for FRI studies can be divided\ninto four stages: (1) patient scanning and 3D air-\nway modelling; (2) determining inhaler charac-\nteristics; (3) setting the inhalation profile; and (4)\nmodelling of lung deposition using CFD simula-\ntions. All three of the sub-studies reported here\ninvolved the same patient group and employed\nsimilar CFD simulation strategies; inhaler\ncharacteristics and inhalation profiles differed\nbetween the sub-studies.\nPatients and airway modelling\nVolumetric, CT-based, 3D models of the lungs of\npatients with asthma were used in the studies.\nPatient CT scans were obtained retrospectively;\nno active patient recruitment was performed for\nthis study. All patients gave their informed con-\nsent and ethical approval was obtained from the\nEthics Committee of the University Hospital in\nAntwerp. The respiratory tract was reconstructed\ndown to the level of the airways with a diameter of\n1\u00ad2 mm, based on CT scans with a voxel size of\naround 0.5 mm3. The airways further down-\nstream of this could not be detected, so if the par-\nticle exited the 3D model, it was considered to be\ndeposited in the peripheral region. However, the\ncompliance in this region was taken into account\nby calculating the internal airflow distribution\nbased on the lobar volume change from expira-\ntion to inspiration. All participants had forced\nexpiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1\nthe predicted value and were receiving ICS/long-\n-agonist (LABA) therapy. Inspiratory\nand expiratory scans were performed for each\nparticipant to generate 3D models of the airways\nand lungs. Inspiratory scans were used to create\npatient-specific models of the upper and lower\nairways, up to the point where no distinction\ncould be made between the intraluminal and\nalveolar airways. An example of an inspiratory\nscan from a single patient with asthma is shown in\nFigure 1, where the extrathoracic region (mouth\nand throat), the central (large) airways and the\nperipheral (small) airways are depicted. Both\ninspiratory and expiratory scans were used to pro-\nduce models of the lung lobes.\nAll modelling operations were performed using\ncommercially available validated software pack-\nNV, Leuven, Belgium).\nInhaler characteristics\nIn order to evaluate the effect of specific inhaler\nand patient characteristics on lung deposition, all\nother variables associated with a representative\npMDI (including cone angle and spray velocity)\nwere kept constant during the simulations.\nCharacteristics relating to the aerosol plume were\nbased on measurements for a representative\nFigure 1.

Particle characteristics used were an\nMMAD of approximately 3.0 m [geometric\nstandard deviation (GSD): 1.6] and an FPF of\napproximately 40%, which were based on the\ncharacteristics of FP/FORM (MMAD 3.2\u00ad3.5\nSimulations were performed for three different\ninhalation profiles with durations of 1, 3 and 5 s,\nmatched for the same inspiratory volume (3 L),\nwith actuation at the start of inhalation\n(Supplementary Figure A). A sinusoidal inhala-\ntion profile (similar to that of tidal breathing) was\nemployed because this is routinely used to model\nbreathing rhythms. pMDIs are recommended to\nbe inhaled over 4\u00ad5 s, in order to achieve a flow\nrate of ~30 L/min and an inhalation volume of\n~2.5 L; we therefore chose an inhalation duration\nof 5 s to reflect this.14 Shorter inhalation dura-\ntions of 1 and 3 s that are associated with faster\ninhalation flow rates (and are executed by some\npatients who use pMDIs) were also modelled.15,21\ntively; peak flow rates for each profile were 343 L/\nInfluence of MMAD and FPF on lung deposition\nThe second sub-study assessed the effects of dif-\nferent MMAD and FPF values on modelled lung\ndeposition. The simulations were performed on\nvirtual monodisperse compounds using three\nand 10%). A GSD of 1.2 was chosen because this\nis typical of a monodisperse aerosol profile, such\nas those evaluated in a previous clinical study.22\nThe profiles were developed by taking a standard\nmonodisperse profile and scaling down its FPF to\na set value, with a corresponding increase in the\nproportion of large particles (>10 \u00b5m in diame-\nter); the distribution is scaled so that losses in the\npre-separator are taken into account. A sinusoidal\ninhalation profile (similar to that of tidal breath-\ning that is often used as a typical breathing pat-\ntern) of 30 L/min over 3 s was used for all CFD\nsimulations, with actuation timed as the start of\ninhalation (the timing of which can impact drug\ndelivery in real life). An inhalation duration of 3 s\nwas chosen because many patients who use\npMDIs inhale too quickly21 (ERS/ISAM guide-\nlines recommend that patients inhale over 4\u00ad5\ns).14 We recognize that some patients inhale faster\nat the start of inhalation, and so we also modelled\nan inhalation profile to reflect this in a separate\npart of the study (see the following paragraph), in\naddition to modelling a longer inhalation dura-\ntion to represent that recommended by ERS/\nISAM (5 s; see above).14 The simulation of other\ncomplex variables (e.g. droplet entrainment,\nevaporation, spray duration) was considered to be\nbeyond the scope of this initial study.\nInfluence of inhalation profile on lung\ndeposition of FP/FORM\nThe third sub-study evaluated the effects of dif-\nferent inhalation profiles on lung deposition of\nFP/FORM administered via an HFA-based\npMDI; both the FP and FORM components of\nthis formulation have an FPF of approximately\ntion of FP and FORM were modelled separately,\nbut deposition data are presented as a composite.\nAll deposition data are presented as a percentage\nof the metered dose and are therefore valid for all\nformulations. Simulations were performed with\ntwo different inhalation profiles: a sharp inhala-\ntion with peak flow shortly after the start [similar\nto the forceful inhalation when using a pMDI\nincorrectly and recommended when using a dry\npowder inhaler (DPI)] and a gradual inhalation\nwith peak flow midway through the inhalation\n(similar to the gradual inhalation recommended\nwhen using a pMDI; Supplementary Figure B).14\nProfiles were assessed using an inhalation dura-\ntion of 3 s (as described above), with actuation at\nthe start of inhalation, at mean flow rates of 30 L/\nC Van Holsbeke, J De Backer et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 5\nmin and 60 L/min. Peak flow values were 47 L/\nmin and 94 L/min for the gradual profile and 57\nL/min and 114 L/min for the sharp profile at\nmean flow rates of 30 L/min and 60 L/min,\nrespectively. The simulation of other complex\nvariables (e.g. droplet evaporation, spray dura-\ntion, initial ballistic velocities) was considered to\nbe beyond the scope of this initial study.\nCFD simulations\nThe 3D models of the respiratory tracts were sub-\ndivided into three regions (Figure 1): extratho-\nracic (from the mouth to the trachea at the top of\nthe sternum), central (from the trachea to airways\nreconstructed from CT data) and peripheral (air-\nways with a diameter of <2 mm, which were not\nvisible on CT scans). The combination of central\nand peripheral regions was used to determine the\ntotal amount of lung deposition.\nSurface meshes were created in 3-Matic and were\nconverted to tetrahedral, 3D volume meshes\nusing TGrid 14.0 (Ansys Inc, Canonsburg, PA,\nUSA). CFD simulations were performed using\nthe 3D models and applying the following bound-\nary conditions: selected inhalation profiles were\napplied at the inhaler inlet to account for device-\ngenerated turbulence; the percentage of flow exit-\ning the model towards a lung lobe equalled the\nrelative lobar expansion, as obtained from patient-\nspecific inspiratory/expiratory 3D models; when a\nparticle hit the airway wall, it was assumed to be\ntrapped at that location; any particle not depos-\nited in extrathoracic or central airways was\nassumed to be deposited in peripheral airways.\nAlthough extrafine particles have a greater poten-\ntial than larger particles to be exhaled, an in vivo\nstudy using extrafine beclometasone dipropion-\nate/formoterol showed that only a very small frac-\ntion (2\u00ad3%) of extrafine particles was exhaled\nfollowing a 10-s breath hold.23 This was most\nlikely due to the fact that extrafine particles\ndeposit by sedimentation, meaning the extent of\ndeposition of these particles is influenced by dura-\ntion of breath hold: the longer the duration, the\ngreater the deposition of extrafine particles and\nthe lower the amount that can be exhaled. In this\nstudy, owing to the limited resolution of the CT\nscanner, particles depositing in bronchioles <1\u00ad2\nmm in diameter could not be detected. Therefore,\nour results model the effects of a breath hold that\nis sufficient to allow deposition of particles in the\nperipheral airways. Further studies are required\nto fully explore the impact of breath hold on the\ndeposition of extrafine particles.\nTemporal discretization was accomplished using\na second-order implicit formulation with a time\nstep of 0.005 s. A pressure-based solver was used\nwith a node-based Green\u00adGauss gradient treat-\nment and a SIMPLE (semi-implicit method for\npressure-linked equations) pressure\u00advelocity cou-\npling. Large eddy simulations (LES) using the\nkinetic-energy transport subgrid scale model were\nperformed, and LES near-wall treatment was\nused. The spatial discretization options for pres-\nsure, momentum and subgrid kinetic energy\nwere, respectively: standard, bounded central dif-\nferencing and second-order upwind. An aggrega-\ntive algebraic multigrid solver was used in\ncombination with a Gauss\u00adSeidel smoothing\nalgorithm. Particle transport was modelled by an\nimplicit Runge\u00adKutta Lagrangian discrete parti-\ncle model, with one-way coupling of the forces\nfrom the flow to the particle and taking into\naccount the Saffman lift forces. The aerosol\nplume was modelled by additional species trans-\nport equations for a compressible mixture.\nStatistical analyses\nAll analyses were conducted using R version 3.2.5\n(The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,\nVienna, Austria), using linear mixed-effect mod-\nels with a random intercept for the subject.\nDepending on the residual plots, the outcome\nparameter was logarithmically transformed and\nhigher-order effects incorporated. To assess the\ngoodness of fit, marginal R2 values were calcu-\nlated and p values obtained by comparing the\nmodel with the null model using parametric boot-\nstrap with 1000 simulations. The estimate and\n95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated\nusing parametric bootstrapping with 200 simula-\ntions.

Our findings provide useful data in sup-\nport of ERS/ISAM guidelines, which recommend\na slow and deep inhalation lasting 4\u00ad5 s when\nusing a pMDI.14 A fast inhalation is the most\ncommon handling error observed with a\npMDI.15,21 Many patients also find it difficult to\ncoordinate actuation of their pMDI with inhala-\ntion, particularly if they inhale quickly;12,21\nindeed, the requirement for a slow inhalation is\nsupported by a study in 18 patients with obstruc-\ntive lung disease, in which a device in which a\nlaser aerosol photometer was combined with a\npiston-type ventilator was used, allowing the sub-\nject to inhale particles at controlled breathing pat-\nterns. A controlled, slow inhalation was shown to\nprovide significantly greater lung deposition than\nbehind the guidelines: for patients who inhale too\nrapidly with a pMDI, extending the inhalation\nduration to 4\u00ad5 s would reduce the inhalation\nflow rate (assuming the same inspiratory volume)\nand thereby improve lung deposition. It should\nalso reduce the number of coordination errors,\nbecause it allows more time for the patient to\ncoordinate pMDI actuation with inhalation.\nThe current study suggests that for the represent-\native pMDI (FP/FORM) model used in these\nsimulations, an inhalation duration of 5 s (recom-\nmended by ERS/ISAM guidelines14) leads to a\nhigh level of lung deposition, with good levels of\nperipheral and central deposition; however, our\nresults also showed that high levels of deposition\nwere achieved even with a 3-s inhalation (nearly\n90% of that seen with a 5-s inhalation). This\nimplies that while the recommended 4\u00ad5-s inha-\nlation should remain a goal for optimal deposi-\ntion, this perhaps should not be treated as an\nabsolute cutoff value below which inhalation is\nconsidered inadequate, and a shorter duration\nshould not necessarily be considered an error.\nNotably, the formulation assessed in this study\nsuggests that modern pMDIs have the potential\nto provide good deposition, even when peak flow\nfor the 5-s and 3-s inhalations, respectively), a\nflow rate previously suggested as being unsuitable\nfor pMDIs.21 Lung deposition with a 1-s, sharp\ninhalation, however, was markedly lower than\nwith longer durations, delivering approximately\nhalf the dose achieved with the 5-s inhalation.\nInterestingly, central deposition was similar for all\nthree inhalation durations (approximately 15%),\nwhereas peripheral deposition was improved with\nslower and longer inhalation. This suggests that,\nwhile the speed and duration of inhalation may\nmake little difference to the efficacy of bronchodi-\nlators (which act primarily in central airways),22 a\nslower and longer inhalation may be an advantage\nfor anti-inflammatory agents (which should be\ndistributed throughout the central and peripheral\nairways for optimal efficacy).29 This also raises\nthe question of whether this tenet applies to all\ntypes of devices, including DPIs. It is reasonable\nto assume that the same principles apply to all\nparticle types, and therefore that the fast and\nforceful inhalation manoeuvre required to\nC Van Holsbeke, J De Backer et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 11\ndeagglomerate the powder and generate respira-\nble particles with DPIs may limit the amount of\ndrug that can reach peripheral airways. Further\nwork should be conducted to assess whether this\nis the case.\nMMAD, FPF and lung deposition\nThe use of FRI allowed us to assess indepen-\ndently the effects of MMAD and FPF on lung\ndeposition for a specific, monodisperse fraction.\nA sinusoidal inhalation profile was used (similar\nto that of tidal breathing that is often used to rep-\nresent a typical breathing pattern), with actuation\ntimed as the start of inhalation (the timing of\nwhich can impact drug delivery in real life).\nHowever, we recognize that some patients inhale\nfaster at the start of inhalation, so we also mod-\nelled a `sharp' inhalation profile to reflect this\nwhen evaluating the lung deposition of FP/FORM\n(discussed above). By modelling a formulation\nthat contained a monodisperse fraction with a\nspecified particle size as well as a proportion of\nparticles that were greater than 10 \u00b5m, we could\nalter MMAD and FPF separately. This enabled\nus to assess the impact of each of these parame-\nters on TLD \u00ad which would be difficult to achieve\nwith real-world formulations. Our findings\nshowed that FPF had a large impact on TLD,\nwhereas MMAD had little effect at the same FPF.\nThere was a linear increase in TLD with increas-\nwas similar across all three MMADs (1.5, 3.0 and\nThe reasons underlying this observation are not\nfully elucidated. However, it is important to note\nthat the calculation for FPF includes all particles\nwith a diameter <5.0 m, including those that\ndeposit in the `throat' of the impactor. By con-\ntrast, MMAD excludes particles that impact on\nthe `throat', which usually constitute the majority\nof the total dose. The effect of other particle dis-\ntributions on these parameters is unknown.\nPrevious studies have suggested that aerosols\ncontaining extrafine particles provide greater\nlung deposition than those with larger particles;\nindeed, as noted in the Introduction, this is\noften used to explain the differences in doses\nrequired for asthma control between HFA-\nHowever, the marked difference in FPF between\nthe HFA- and CFC-based formulations (36%\nand 18% of metered doses, respectively)18 is\nrarely mentioned, even though the fine particle\ndose provided by a 100 \u00b5g dose of HFA-based\nBDP is similar to that from a 250 \u00b5g dose of the\n\u00b5g, respectively).30\nThe present study adds to the debate around the\nmost appropriate MMAD for particles to deposit\nin the lungs. In this study, TLD was consistent\n\u00b5m, with TLD highest when FPF was high (40%).\nOther studies also suggest that particles with an\nMMAD in the range 1.5\u00ad4.5 \u00b5m can achieve\ngood lung deposition, consistent with these find-\nings. For example, modest differences in TLD\nwere reported for monodisperse salbutamol aero-\nphy study.22 A separate study, which used mono-\ndisperse FP aerosols to evaluate the effects of\nparticle size on systemic bioavailability, showed\nthat although deposition was reduced at the larg-\nest particle size studied (MMAD 6.0 \u00b5m) com-\npared with smaller particle sizes, systemic\nbioavailability was similar for aerosols with\nused activated charcoal to block gastrointestinal\ndrug absorption evaluated the pulmonary bioa-\nvailability of monodisperse BDP aerosols and\nreported greater lung deposition for aerosols with\nMMADs of 3.0 \u00b5m and 4.5 \u00b5m than for those\nwith an MMAD of 1.5 \u00b5m.32 The reduced lung\ndeposition with the smallest particles was thought\nto be due to a large proportion of small particles\nbeing exhaled owing to the lack of efficient depo-\nsition mechanisms.32 This hypothesis was sup-\nported by a scintigraphy study that showed that\n22% of particles with an MMAD of 1.5 \u00b5m were\nexhaled, compared with 8% and 2% of particles\nwith MMADs of 3.0 \u00b5m and 6.0 \u00b5m, respec-\ntively.22 Taken together, these suggest that there\nis little difference in total deposition for particle\nsizes in the range of 1.5\u00ad4.5 \u00b5m for formulations\nwith a high FPF, but suggest a decrease in deposi-\ntion when particle size increases above 5.0\nMMAD may instead provide more information\nabout the relative regional deposition of particles.\nOur study showed that MMAD did indeed have\nsome influence on regional lung deposition. For\nsmaller particles (MMADs, 1.5 m and 3.0 m),\ndeposition occurred mainly in the peripheral air-\nways, whereas for larger particles (MMAD, 4.5\nTherapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 12\n12 journals.sagepub.com/home/tar\nm), deposition was mainly in the central airways.\nThis is consistent with findings reported by\nUsmani and colleagues, who showed that periph-\neral deposition decreased with increasing MMAD\nalthough central deposition was similar across the\ndid not influence regional lung deposition.\nOur study thus underlines the important influ-\nence of FPF on TLD and indicates that TLD is\nnot solely related to the MMAD of a drug; how-\never, it suggests that MMAD may have an effect\non regional lung deposition.\nInhalation profile and FP/FORM deposition\nOur FRI study provided a first insight into the\nlung deposition associated with FP/FORM. It\nshowed that a gradual inhalation profile and flow\nrate of 30 L/min were associated with significantly\nhigher TLD than a sharp inhalation profile at a\nflow rate of 60 L/min, although FP/FORM pro-\nof metered dose) with both inhalation profiles\nand flow rates. Importantly, deposition of FP/\nFORM occurred throughout the central and\nperipheral airways. FP/FORM has a high FPF of\napproximately 40% of the metered dose,19 and, as\ndiscussed above, this may explain the high levels\nof drug deposition seen with FP/FORM. Our\nresults also highlight that a formulation with an\nMMAD of >1.5 \u00b5m can reach the peripheral air-\nways; FP/FORM, with an MMAD of 3.2\u00ad3.5 \u00b5m,\nshowed a greater proportion of lung deposition in\nthe peripheral airways than in the central airways\nin all conditions tested.\nWith FP/FORM, lung deposition occurred\nmostly in the peripheral airways, although some\nvariation in peripheral distribution was observed\nacross the different inhalation conditions; cen-\ntral deposition showed little variation across\ninhalation profiles and flow rates. The reasons\nfor higher peripheral lung deposition with a\ngradual inhalation than with a sharp inhalation\nremain to be determined. However, this may be\ndue to an increased likelihood of particles\nimpacting the throat and walls of the proximal\nairways from the force of a sharp inhalation; this\nwould be less likely with a gentler, gradual inha-\nlation, thereby increasing the likelihood of\nperipheral deposition. Given the involvement of\nboth small and large airways in asthma, a bal-\nance between central and peripheral deposition\nmay be important, especially for ICS/LABA\ncombinations that provide both anti-inflamma-\ntory and bronchodilatory effects.33\nThe ability to provide high levels of lung deposi-\ntion despite variations in inhalation profile and\nflow rates may also be relevant given how pMDIs\nare used in real life: patients exhibit a diverse\nrange of inhalation profiles that vary not only\namong patients but also in successive breaths by\nthe same individual.34 FRI showed that the FP/\nFORM pMDI was forgiving at high inspiratory\nflow rates, providing consistent deposition even at\nthe high peak flow rates assessed in the study (94\nL/min and 114 L/min for gradual and sharp pro-\nfiles, respectively, for 60 L/min). Furthermore,\nthe inhaler characteristics of the FP/FORM\npMDI were similar to those used to assess the dif-\nferent inhalation profiles, suggesting that FP/\nFORM may provide some deposition even at\nexcessive flow rates.\nStudy limitations\nIn addition to the general modelling limitations\noutlined above, it is important to note that the\nmodelled distribution used in this study (a\nmonodisperse fraction with a fraction of >10\n\u00b5m) does not represent the complicated particle-\nsize distributions of pMDIs seen in real life. This\nwas intended to be a theoretical study, to pro-\nvide some initial insight into the effect of specific\ninhalation characteristics (inhalation duration,\nflow rate, MMAD and FPF) on lung deposition\nfor the theoretical formulation used, while keep-\ning all other variables constant; the effect of\nother particle distributions on these parameters\nis unknown. The influence of factors such as\nparticle evaporation and deceleration was not\naddressed specifically, as this was beyond the\nscope of this study. However, the particles went\nthrough evaporation and some deceleration\nbecause the model took the particle distributions\nfrom an Anderson cascade impactor. Further\nstudies are required to assess fully all of the\nparameters that may influence drug-deposition\npatterns in real life, including the full, complex\nphysics of aerosols. However, the findings from\nthis study may still provide useful information\nregarding the effect of some inhalation and\npatient characteristics on TLD for real-life\nformulations.\nC Van Holsbeke, J De Backer et al.\njournals.sagepub.com/home/tar 13\nAnother limitation is that, in this model, the\ninhaler was actuated at the start of inhalation,\nreflecting a good inhaler technique. Many\npatients, however, have difficulty coordinating\ninhalation with actuation, so our findings are\nmore representative of optimal use of a device\nthan may be of typical use in clinical practice.\nHowever, it should also be recognized that in vivo\nstudies with scintigraphy assess drug deposition\nonly in highly trained patients, so these studies\nare also reflective only of optimum technique and\ndo not necessarily indicate deposition achieved in\neveryday use. Further FRI studies could poten-\ntially evaluate the effects of differences in the tim-\ning of inhaler actuation on lung deposition.\nConclusion\nThere is a complex interplay between the factors\nthat affect lung deposition, and therefore clinical\nefficacy, of an inhaled drug. These include inha-\nlation profile and formulation characteristics, as\nwell as anatomical variation among patients and\nlung function. Although FRI carries general limi-\ntations associated with any mathematical model-\nling, it may still provide important insights into\nthe relative contributions of, and interplay\nbetween, these different factors. In particular, it\nreduces the need to dose patients with radioac-\ntively labelled compounds and facilitates testing\nthat would be difficult, costly and time-consum-\ning in vivo.\nThe results of our modelling study using FRI\nshow how inhalation characteristics and aerosol\nparticle size may affect lung deposition for a spe-\ncific particle-size distribution. Our data support\nthe ERS/ISAM guidelines, which recommend a\nlong, slow inhalation because this clearly improves\nboth TLD and peripheral deposition. The study\nalso demonstrates that, for the specific particle-\nsize distribution used, FPF can have a major\neffect on TLD, with deposition increasing as FPF\nincreases, whereas MMAD only influenced\nregional deposition at the same FPF. Finally, this\nis the first study to predict that the FP/FORM\npMDI should provide high levels of drug deposi-\ntion throughout the central and peripheral air-\nways, and that variation in inhalation profile and\nflow rate would be expected to have little effect on\ndeposition. Future studies using FRI will further\nour understanding of the deposition of inhaled\ndrugs and therefore help to improve the manage-\nment of asthma.\n"
