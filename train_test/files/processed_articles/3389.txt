If a man tolerates his\npartner having sex with other men, he loses opportunities to pass on his own genes and at\nworst may end up investing resources into the offspring of competitors. Likewise, if a\nwoman tolerates her partner having sex with other women, she may lose resources that\ncould be invested into her own offspring and may risk losing her partner. As such, humans\nhave evolved adaptions to dislike being the victim of infidelity, detect it, and guard against\nAnother consideration in human evolution that stems from inclusive fitness is kin\nselection (Hamilton, 1963, 1964). Humans and many other species increase the chances of\nInfidelity and kin selection\npassing on their genes by investing resources in their own offspring as well as their close\nrelatives, because relatives also share some of the same genes. Humans share 50% of their\ngenes with each child, as well as (on average) 50% with each sibling, 25% with each half-\nsibling, and 12.5% with each first cousin; thus, investing resources in close relatives can\nincrease one's inclusive fitness. In extreme cases, kin selection theory can explain social\ninsects, such as bees and ants, being sterile and devoting their lives to helping their queens\nproduce close relatives (Dawkins, 1976). In other more moderate cases, kin selection can\nlead to the evolution of alarm calls in birds or mammals, in which the individual making\nthe alarm call brings more danger to itself, but the danger is offset by the benefits it confers\nto its relatives. In primates (including humans), kin selection can also be used to explain\nwhy relatives are more likely to share food with one another than with nonrelatives, and\nwhy individuals are more likely to adopt orphaned relatives than nonrelatives (Wilson,\nHowever, the potential advantages offered by kin selection create an interesting\nconflict with the benefits of guarding against infidelity. Obviously, it is in person X's\ngenetic interest to prevent his or her partner from having sex with strangers, but what if\nperson X's partner had sex with person X's genetic relative? In this context, infidelity\noccurring with genetic relatives does not represent incest. The infidelity in this context\noccurs between a person's partner and that same person's genetic relative (e.g., a man's\nwife sleeping with his brother, or a woman's husband sleeping with her sister). Infidelity\nwith a relative would still present a threat to person X's inclusive fitness, but to a lesser\ndegree than if the infidelity occurred with a nonrelative because some of person X's genes\nwould still get passed on through their relative. This possibility can be described in the\nfollowing way: I don't want my partner to be unfaithful, but if it happened with one of my\nrelatives it wouldn't be as bad. Admittedly, this possibility is somewhat counterintuitive, as\nmost people likely experience a visceral reaction at the thought of their partners having\naffairs with close relatives. But this intuitive reaction appears to be at odds with what kin\nselection theory might predict, and it is the goal of these studies to examine this conflict.\nThere has been extensive research on infidelity from an evolutionary perspective.\nSome of the most influential work comes from Buss, Larsen, Westen, and Semmelroth\n(1992), in which they described the different costs of infidelity for men and women in\nterms of inclusive fitness, and showed that men and women have evolved distinct reactions\nto their partners being unfaithful. Both men and women report experiencing jealousy at the\nthought of any type of infidelity, but if forced to decide whether they would be more upset\nat the thought of sexual infidelity or emotional infidelity, men are more likely than women\nto select sexual infidelity. The theory underlying this phenomenon is that men and women\nexperience different threats to inclusive fitness as a result of their biological differences\n(e.g., women are forced to invest more heavily in unborn children, and men are less certain\ntheir children are truly theirs). The greatest threat to a man's inclusive fitness is to be\ntricked into investing resources in another man's children at the expense of his own.\nTherefore, men are more sensitive to sexual infidelity because it is a sign that their children\nmay not be their own. Women, on the other hand, are always sure that their children are\ngenetically related to them, but they benefit from the resources that their partners invest in\ntheir children. Therefore, women are more sensitive to emotional infidelity because it is a\nInfidelity and kin selection\nsign that their partner may begin diverting resources to another woman and her children.\nThese results have been replicated many times (Sagarin et al., 2012), though there is some\ndebate regarding the methodology and theoretical interpretations (Harris, 2003). There may\nbe limits to the effect, as well; for example, Buss et al. (1992) report that men are more\nlikely to indicate that sexual infidelity is more distressing if they have been in a \"committed\nsexual relationship in the past\" (p. 254), and the same is not true for women who have been\nin a committed sexual relationship--they reported more distress over emotional infidelity\nthan sexual infidelity and relationship history had no effect. Also, Lishner, Nguyen, Stocks,\nand Zillmer (2008) report that if participants are allowed to indicate that the sexual\ninfidelity and the emotional infidelity situations are equally distressing, most participants\nrespond that way (though men are still more likely than women to indicate that sexual\ninfidelity is more distressing).\nThere have been several studies on infidelity involving relatives (e.g., Bohner,\nEchterhoff, Gla\u00df, Patrzek, and Lampridis, 2010; Fenigstein and Peltz, 2002; Michalski,\nShackelford, and Salmon, 2007; Shackelford, Michalski, and Schmitt, 2004). These studies\nhave mostly built off the findings of Buss et al. (1992) in order to evaluate whether sex\ndifferences in jealousy could be explained by socialization theories (e.g., DeSteno and\nSalovey, 1996). Whereas these studies did involve gauging participants' perceptions of\ninfidelity involving relatives and nonrelatives, none of these studies specifically addressed\nhow people would feel when pitting their own reproductive interests against those of their\nrelatives. Only one study thus far has focused on how participants would feel if they\nthemselves were victims of infidelity that involved their own relatives. Fisher et al. (2009)\nexamined how degree of relatedness can affect distress from infidelity, and specifically\nmentioned the clash between the damage to social bonds vs. the potential benefits to\ninclusive fitness. Overall, they showed that people are more distressed when \"the other\nperson\" is closely related to them, and that genetic relatedness is a more important factor\nthan the type of sexual behavior, the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, and the damage\nto reputation. Fisher et al. (2009) concluded that infidelity with relatives is more distressing\nthan infidelity with nonrelatives because of the importance of maintaining social bonds\nwith relatives. These results are intriguing and convincing, but they do not address\nsituations in which the degree of social closeness varies between relatives and nonrelatives.\nIn fact, their results seem to suggest that if social closeness were held constant, infidelity\nwith relatives might still seem less distressing than infidelity with nonrelatives because of\nthe potential benefits to inclusive fitness. The goal of the current set of experiments was to\nexamine these issues.\nBuss et al. (1992) described the utility of evolutionary theory to generate\npredictions of sex differences in jealousy. The present study used this same approach to test\npredictions generated from kin selection theory by examining whether people would be\nmore distressed by their partners cheating on them with relatives or nonrelatives. In this\nframework, evolutionary theory would lead us to predict that, overall, people would be\nstrongly disapproving of infidelity, but people might experience less distress at the thought\nof their partners being unfaithful with relatives than with nonrelatives. In two experiments,\nparticipants answered questions about how they would feel if their partners had sex with a\nvariety of their (the participants') relatives and nonrelatives. Experiment 2 of Fisher et al.\nInfidelity and kin selection\n(2009) used Likert scale ratings to determine how much distress would be caused by\ninfidelity with siblings, best friends, prostitutes, and strangers. Experiment 1 attempts to\nreplicate and extend their findings by comparing more categories of relatives and\nnonrelatives while measuring social closeness.\nExperiment 1\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nMissouri State University undergraduates (83 total: 12 men, 71 women) consented\nto participate in exchange for extra credit in a research methods course. This experiment\nwas approved by Missouri State University's IRB. The average age for participants was\nnot indicate her age. Seventy-five participants reported being heterosexual. Because some\nprior work has suggested that sexual jealousy may manifest itself differently in same-sex\nrelationships (Sagarin, Becker, Guadagno, Nicastle, and Millevoi, 2003; Sheets and Wolfe,\n2001), all following statistics and analyses are restricted to participants who indicated they\nwere heterosexual.\nOn a question involving relationship status, 32 participants responded they were\nsingle, 37 were unmarried but in a relationship, four were married, and two were divorced.\nOf participants who reported currently being in some type of romantic relationship, the\naverage reported length of the relationship was 3.03 years (SD = 4.04). Of those who were\nin a relationship or married, no participants responded that they were involved with\nsomeone other than their current partners, and nobody reported that their partners were\ncurrently involved with someone else.\nProcedure\nParticipants received a packet with instructions and questions. The instructions read\nas follows:\nIn this study, please imagine that you are in a long-term relationship with\nsomebody, and you discover that your partner has cheated on you by having sexual\nintercourse with another person. On the following page there are different questions\nabout how you might feel if you learned your partner had cheated on you with\nvarious people. For example, you may be asked to indicate on a scale of -5 to +5\nhow you would feel if your partner had cheated on you with your neighbor. A\nnegative score indicates you would feel bad, and a positive score means you would\nfeel good, and a score of 0 would mean that you would have no feelings on the\nmatter. Even though being cheated on is probably a negative experience for most\npeople, please give some thought about how you would actually feel in each\nscenario; would you feel truly devastated, only a little upset, neutral, or possibly\nsomewhat positive about the experience?\nThese questions will ask about different types of relatives or friends. For example,\nyou will have to think about how you would feel if your partner cheated on you\nInfidelity and kin selection\nwith a relative or a coworker. Even if you do not have every type of relationship we\nwill ask about, try to imagine how you would feel if you did.\nThe subsequent pages contained the prompt \"How would you feel if your partner had sex\nwith...\" and participants circled their ratings for each item. Each scale included descriptors\nin which participants saw that a rating of -5 corresponded to \"Very bad\" and +5\ncorresponded to \"Very good\" (See Appendix for all relationship types in the current\nexperiment).\nNext, participants reported sexual orientation by circling Heterosexual,\nHomosexual, Bisexual, Prefer not to say, or Other (with space to write something in).\nParticipants then indicated the total numbers of male and female siblings, half-siblings,\nstep-siblings, first cousins, and distant cousins. Participants also indicated whether they or\nany of their siblings were adopted, and they were asked to write down the number of male\nand female adoptive siblings they had. Participants were also given space to write\nclarifications for their answers to questions about their family information.\nIn questions about their relationship history, participants were asked to indicate\nwhether they have ever been in a serious, committed romantic relationship. Participants\nalso indicated their current relationship status (single, unmarried but in a relationship,\nmarried, divorced, and widowed). For participants currently in some type of relationship,\nthey were asked how long they have been with their partner and whether their relationship\nis monogamous. Participants were again given space to write any additional information to\nclarify their answers about their relationship histories.\nNext, participants completed a series of items based on the Inclusion of Other in the\nSelf (IOS) scale (Aron, Aron, and Smollan, 1992). The following instructions appeared:\nFor the following questions, please circle the picture which best describes your\nrelationship with various other people. If you do not have such a person in your life,\nindicate so, but still circle the picture that you think would describe your\nrelationship with that kind of person.\nHere is how the questions will appear:\nDo you have a [relationship with some type of other person]? Yes No\nCircle the kind of relationship you have (or might have) with him/her:\nIf you have any questions, please ask them now. Otherwise, turn over the page to\nbegin.\nParticipants' responses were converted into ratings between 1 (not close) and 7 (very close)\ncorresponding to the picture that was circled. Means and standard deviations for each\ncategory are reported in the Appendix. Each of the IOS questions asked about same-sex\nrelationships, such as, \"Do you have a same-sex sibling?\" and \"Do you have a same-sex\nbest friend?\" For the item regarding a \"stranger who looks just like you,\" the question\nInfidelity and kin selection\nasked \"Have you ever seen a stranger who looks just like you?\" For the item regarding a\ncomplete stranger, participants were simply asked to think of a complete stranger without\nresponding yes or no to anything.\nAfter the IOS scale, participants completed the Attitudes toward Infidelity Scale\n(ATIS; Whatley, 2006).1 Finally, participants were asked optional questions about their\nactual experiences with infidelity. First, participants were asked whether they have ever\nbeen in a relationship in which their partner cheated on them. If they responded \"yes,\" they\nindicated the type of relationship and who the \"other person\" was, they provided a rating on\na scale of -5 to +5 of how the experience made them feel, they indicated whether the\nrelationship ended because of the infidelity, and they were given space to write any\nadditional details they wanted to provide. The last page included the same questions\nregarding whether the participants themselves ever cheated on their partners.\nResults and Discussion\nBecause prior work (Buss et al., 1992) has shown that sexual jealousy may operate\ndifferently for people who have been in committed sexual relationships, the following\nanalyses are restricted to participants who reported being in a relationship or married at the\ntime of the study (n = 44), although we achieve the same findings when including data\nfrom all participants. For the following three sets of comparisons involving the distress\nratings, the Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level is .017; for the two sets of comparisons\ninvolving the IOS ratings, the Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level is .025.\nIn a planned comparison of average ratings of feelings of distress for all relatives\nparticipants reported significantly greater feelings of distress for relatives, t(43) = 3.12, SE\nconduct a 2 (Related vs. Unrelated) x 7 (Type of Relationship) repeated measures ANOVA\non the distress ratings. This ANOVA confirms the t-test by showing a main effect in which\ninfidelity with relatives produces more distress than infidelity with nonrelatives, F(1,43) =\nA key question is how relatives and nonrelatives compare regarding feelings of\ncloseness. A 2 (Related vs. Unrelated) x 7 (Type of Relationship) repeated measures\nANOVA on the IOS ratings revealed a main effect in which IOS ratings were higher for\n1 Data from the ATIS are not reported in the current study.\nInfidelity and kin selection\nFigure 1. Average distress reported by participants when imagining that their partner has\nhad sex with a relative, adoptive relative, step-relative, or nonrelative\nNote. Category members are ordered based on the IOS ratings (see Figure 2). Error bars\nrepresent standard error of the mean.\nFigure 2. Average ratings of closeness on the IOS scale for each category of relatives,\nadoptive relatives, step-relatives, and nonrelatives\nNote. For each item, participants were asked to think of same-sex relationships. Higher\nratings indicate greater feelings of closeness. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.\nInfidelity and kin selection\nIn addition to comparing differences between relatives and nonrelatives overall,\nanother approach is to examine differences in reactions to infidelity with family members\nwho vary in degrees of genetic relatedness. This analysis would involve comparing\nreactions to different types of relatives (i.e., siblings and parents) who are biologically\nrelated, adopted, or step-relatives. A 2 (Sibling vs. Parent) x 3 (Biological vs. Adoptive vs.\nStep-Relative) repeated measures ANOVA on the distress ratings showed that distress is\npartial 2 = .15, and that there is no significant difference between all types of siblings vs.\nFigure 3. Average distress reported by participants imagining that their partner has had sex\nwith a sibling or parent that is a biological relative, adoptive relative, or step-relative\nNote. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.\nLikewise, the same type of ANOVA on the IOS ratings revealed differences\npartial 2 = .36, and no differences between all types of siblings and all types of parents in\nAn additional component of Experiment 1 is that participants received an optional\nquestion about their own experiences with infidelity. For the 24 people who reported ever\nhaving been a victim of infidelity, the other person was usually a friend, acquaintance, or\nstranger. The average rating of the experience when participants were victims was -4.58\n(SD = 0.72). Victims did not respond significantly differently from participants with no\nsuch experience (n = 20) on average ratings of distress for infidelity scenarios with\np = .43. For the 15 people who reported ever having committed infidelity themselves, the\nother person was usually a friend or former partner, and the average distress rating of the\nexperience was -3.47 (SD = 2.30). There were also no differences between participants who\nInfidelity and kin selection\nhad themselves committed infidelity at some time and participants who did not report such\nan experience (n = 29) on the same measures: distress over infidelity with relatives, t(42) =\nFigure 4. Average ratings of closeness on the IOS scale for a sibling or parent that is a\nbiological relative, adoptive relative, or step-relative.\nNote. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.\nThe main conclusion from Experiment 1 was that participants imagined feeling\nworse if their partners cheated on them with relatives compared to nonrelatives (including\nbiologically unrelated family members, such as adoptive relatives and step-relatives). The\ncurrent findings support and extend those of Fisher et al. (2009) in that they provide no\nevidence that kin selection attenuates reactions to infidelity with relatives. The current\nstudy also examined feelings of closeness for each type of relationship with the IOS scale,\nand found evidence suggesting that greater feelings of distress could be related to greater\nfeelings of closeness. In other words, participants may feel worse when imagining infidelity\nwith biological relatives simply because participants tend to feel closer to biological\nrelatives.\nThe goal of Experiment 2 was to compare various infidelity scenarios more directly\nby using direct comparisons between relatives and nonrelatives. Experiment 2 used a\nresponse format that may be more sensitive to detecting potential differences: a two-\nalternative forced choice. Although Experiment 1 showed that the average IOS ratings for\nall categories of relatives were higher than the average IOS ratings for all categories of\nnonrelatives, in Experiment 2 we only compared a subset of relatives and nonrelatives that\nwere matched on IOS ratings. We compared IOS ratings for siblings, half-siblings, cousins,\nand distant cousins against best friends, friends, acquaintances, and complete strangers in a\n2 (Related vs. Unrelated) x 4 (Type of Relationship) repeated measures ANOVA, and\nfound no significant difference in feelings of closeness between relatives and nonrelatives\nInfidelity and kin selection\nrelatives and nonrelatives in a two-alternative forced choice task.\nExperiment 2\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants\nMissouri State University undergraduates (79 total: 19 men, 57 women, 3\nunspecified) consented to participate in exchange for extra credit in a research methods\ncourse. None of the participants in Experiment 2 also participated in Experiment 1. This\nexperiment was approved by Missouri State University's IRB. The average age was 22.13\n(SD = 2.53). The range of ages was between 19 and 31, although two participants did not\nindicate their ages. On a question involving relationship status, 42 participants responded\nthey were single, 27 participants were unmarried but in a relationship, six participants were\nmarried, one participant was divorced, and one participant was widowed. Two participants\ndid not provide any relationship status. Of participants who reported being in some type of\nrelationship, the average reported length of the relationship was 2.52 years (SD = 2.34),\nalthough one participant who was in a relationship did not report the length of the\nrelationship. Of the participants who were in a relationship or married, 30 responded that\ntheir relationships were monogamous, two responded that their relationships were not\nmonogamous, and one did not respond. We did not ask participants to indicate their sexual\norientations. Of all participants, 49.37% reported having at least one same-sex sibling,\n20.25% had at least one same-sex half-sibling, 74.68% had at least one same-sex cousin,\nand 86.08% had at least one same-sex distant cousin.\nProcedure\nParticipants received a packet with instructions and questions. The instructions read\nas follows:\nIn this study, please imagine that you are in a long-term relationship with\nsomebody, and you discover that your partner has cheated on you by having sexual\nintercourse with another person. On the following page there are different questions\nabout how you might feel if you learned your partner had cheated on you with\nvarious people. For example, you may be asked which would make you feel\nworse--if your partner had cheated on you with your neighbor or with your\nroommate. Even though both possibilities would make you feel bad, try to think\nabout which possibility would make you feel worse.\nYou must make a decision for every question. \"Equal\" is not an option. If you\ncannot decide, simply pick one.\nThese questions will ask about different types of relatives or friends. For example,\nyou will have to think about how you would feel if your partner cheated on you\nwith your sibling or your best friend. Even if you do not have any siblings or\nanyone you would consider to be a best friend, try to imagine how you would feel if\nyou did.\nInfidelity and kin selection\nThe subsequent pages contained the prompt \"Which would make you feel worse--if your\npartner had sex with...\" and participants circled one of two options for each question (See\nTable 1 for all items in the experiment). Each item was directly compared against every\nother item, and every comparison appeared twice in mirror forms (e.g., sibling vs. best\nfriend and best friend vs. sibling), which created 56 total comparisons. The comparisons\nwere listed in a semi-random order in which mirror forms of the same question did not\nappear immediately adjacent to each other. The order of comparisons was the same for all\nparticipants.\nTable 1. Items in Experiment 2, ordered from closer to more distant relationships\nRelated Unrelated\nYour sibling Your best friend\nYour half-sibling Your friend\nYour cousin An acquaintance\nYour distant cousin A complete stranger\nAfter participants circled their responses for the comparisons, they answered\ndemographic questions about sex, age, numbers of same-sex relatives, current relationship\nstatus, and also filled out the ATIS.\nScoring. The responses were scored in the following way: In comparisons among\ndifferent categories of nonrelatives, when participants responded they would feel worse if\ntheir partner had sex with the closer of two relationships (e.g., selecting best friend instead\nof friend), the response was scored as +1 for that trial. When participants selected the more\ndistant relationship, the response was scored as -1 for that trial. There were six Nonrelative\ncomparisons possible, and because we included mirror forms of each comparison there\nwere 12 Nonrelative trials total. The same scoring scheme was used in comparisons among\ndifferent categories of relatives; when participants responded they would feel worse if their\npartner had sex with the closer of the two relationships (e.g., selecting sibling instead of\ncousin), the response was scored as +1 for that trial. When participants selected the more\ndistant relationship, the response was scored as -1 for that trial. Similar to the Nonrelative\ntrials, there were six Relative comparisons possible, and mirror forms of each created 12\nRelative trials total. Finally, in comparisons between nonrelatives and relatives, when\nparticipants responded they would feel worse if their partner had sex with the nonrelative\n(e.g., selecting best friend instead of sibling), the response was scored as +1 for that trial.\nWhen participants selected the relative, the response was scored as -1 for that trial. There\nwere 16 types of comparisons between nonrelatives and relatives, and mirror forms of each\ncreated 32 relative/nonrelative comparisons total. We then calculated the average score for\nall trials for each type of comparison. We refer to this average as an infidelity score.\nInfidelity scores are continuous, and they can vary between -1 and +1. Positive infidelity\nscores represent greater distress for closer relationships or nonrelatives, and negative\ninfidelity scores represent greater distress for distant relationships and relatives. When the\ninfidelity score for each type of comparison is 0 or near 0, it shows that participants varied\nin their responses--sometimes in favor of closer relationships, sometimes in favor of more\nInfidelity and kin selection\ndistant relationships, or sometimes in favor of relatives and sometimes in favor of\nnonrelatives.\nResults and discussion\nThree participants failed to provide a response on every trial (each only neglecting\none trial), and these participants' data were retained by giving their missing trials a score of\n0 instead of +1 or -1. The following analyses are restricted to participants who were in a\nrelationship or married at the time of the study (n = 33), but the same findings appeared\nwhen we included data from all participants. All t-tests are paired-samples, unless\notherwise stated. For the following two comparisons, the Bonferroni-adjusted alpha level is\nParticipants tended to be consistent in their responses in that they responded the\nsame way to mirror forms of the same comparison 92.32% of the time (SD = 6.81). The\nprimary research question dealt with the participants' infidelity scores, which indicated\nwhat types of infidelity participants thought would feel worse. See Figure 5 for the\ninfidelity scores for each type of comparison.\nFigure 5. Average infidelity scores for each type of comparison in Experiment 2\nNote. \"Nonrelatives\" indicates comparisons between different categories of nonrelatives. \"Relatives\"\nindicates comparisons between different categories of relatives. \"Comparison\" indicates comparisons between\ndifferent categories of relatives and nonrelatives. Error bars represent standard error of the mean.\nIn scenarios involving comparisons between different categories of nonrelatives,\nparticipants' average infidelity score was .84 (SD = .41). In other words, in situations when\none's partner commits infidelity with nonrelatives, participants most often responded that\nthey would feel worse when the \"other person\" is a closer social relation. In scenarios\ninvolving comparisons between different categories of relatives, participants' average\nInfidelity and kin selection\ninfidelity score was .87 (SD = .27). In other words, in situations when one's partner\ncommits infidelity with a relative, participants most often responded that they would feel\nworse when the \"other person\" is more closely related. There was no significant difference\ndetected in the infidelity scores for nonrelatives and the infidelity scores for relatives, t(32)\nan alpha of .025 for this sample size is .70. This is evidence that participants responded\nsimilarly to situations strictly involving relatives as they did to situations strictly involving\nnonrelatives. In other words, participants tended to use closeness as the determining factor\nin both types of situations.\nIn scenarios involving comparisons between different categories of relatives and\nnonrelatives, participants' average infidelity score was -.28 (SD = .39). This shows that in\ndirect comparisons between different types of relatives and nonrelatives (which produced\nmatched IOS ratings in Experiment 1), participants more often responded that they would\nfeel worse if their partners cheated on them with relatives than with nonrelatives. This\nscore was somewhat closer to 0 than the score for previous comparisons, although a one-\nsample t-test showed that the proportion is still significantly different from zero, t(32) =\n4.13, SE = 0.07, p < .001, which shows that participants show greater aversion to infidelity\nwith relatives.\nThe main conclusion from Experiment 2 was that participants perceived infidelity\noccurring with relatives to be more distressing than infidelity occurring with nonrelatives.\nThis supports the conclusions from Experiment 1 using a different response format.\nExperiment 2 also showed that participants find infidelity more distressing when the \"other\nperson\" is someone who is socially close (regardless of whether they are genetically related\nto the participant or not). Although Experiment 2 was designed to address the possibility of\nceiling effects from Experiment 1's continuous response format, one potential shortcoming\nof the two-alternative forced choice format is that it might create an artificial dichotomy.\nThe current instructions stated that \"`equal' is not an option,\" but Lishner et al. (2008)\nshowed that when given an option, many participants will respond that two different types\nof jealousy-invoking situations are equally upsetting. An important consideration is that\nLishner et al. provided the \"equal\" option for two different types of infidelity scenarios\n(emotional vs. sexual) for the same romantic partner, whereas the current study used only\none type of infidelity scenario (sexual) with two different romantic partners. Therefore, it is\nnot clear how an \"equal\" option might change the results of Experiment 2. However,\nExperiment 1 did provide participants with the ability to indicate that infidelity with two\ndifferent partners were equally distressing, and even with different response formats both\nexperiments reached similar conclusions: Infidelity with relatives is more distressing than\ninfidelity with nonrelatives.\nGeneral Discussion\nThe current study examined whether potential adaptations for kin selection affect\npeople's perceptions of infidelity by asking participants how they would feel if their\npartners cheated on them with a variety of the participants' relatives and nonrelatives. In\ngeneral, evolutionary theory predicts that people would feel negatively about being cheated\nInfidelity and kin selection\non (with anyone) due to the threat to inclusive fitness. More specifically, kin selection\ntheory might predict that people would feel better (although still negatively) about being\ncheated on with relatives than with nonrelatives because some proportion of the victim's\ngenes are shared with the relative and would be passed on to potential offspring. Being\ncheated on with a nonrelative would theoretically result in lower inclusive fitness, and\nshould therefore be perceived as worse than being cheated on with a relative. The results\nfrom the current experiments support the first prediction but not the second: The current\nevidence confirms that people dislike being cheated on, but if forced to choose between\ntwo alternatives people report they would feel worse about being cheated on with a relative\nthan with a nonrelative. These findings generally support the results of Fisher et al. (2009),\nin which people also reported greater distress for infidelity involving relatives than\nnonrelatives. Fisher et al.'s theoretical explanation was that the importance of maintaining\nsocial bonds with relatives outweighs the potential benefits to inclusive fitness; the social\nbonds explanation could also work well for explaining high distress when one imagines\none's partner having sex with one's best friend. Along these lines, we collected data on\nfeelings of closeness with various types of relationships and found that people generally\nfeel the most distress when infidelity occurs with the closest types of relationships. Both\nour findings and Fisher et al.'s (2009) findings are difficult to reconcile with the predictions\nof kin selection theory, although the results do not necessarily discount the possibility that\nkin selection can influence perceptions of infidelity. Below we propose several reasons\nwhy this pattern might have emerged.\nThe most likely reason is that the potential benefits to inclusive fitness that could be\nhad by tolerating infidelity with relatives might be overridden by a general aversion to\ninfidelity. In reality, there is probably no real benefit per se of tolerating infidelity with\nrelatives except that it is not as bad as the greater loss of inclusive fitness incurred by\ninfidelity with nonrelatives. The human ancestors who guarded against all forms of\ninfidelity likely had higher inclusive fitness than the human ancestors who guarded against\nsome forms while being tolerant of others. The tolerant individuals were perhaps more\nlikely to be taken advantage of by unrelated sexual rivals. Tolerating any form of infidelity\nin one's partner could have also led to loss of status, which could have led to further\ndecreases in inclusive fitness. Buss (1994, 1998) describes one function of sexual jealousy\nas to maintain one's status and reputation, which in this context would suggest that\nguarding against infidelity in any form benefits one's inclusive fitness.\nAnother possibility is that any tolerance for infidelity among relatives is overridden\nby aversion to betrayal for socially close individuals. Experiment 1 showed that feelings of\ndistress followed the same general pattern as feelings of closeness, and participants felt\nworse about infidelity when it occurred with socially close relationships. Experiment 2 also\nshowed that participants tend to report feeling worse when their partners cheat on them\nwith more socially close relatives and nonrelatives. Given that infidelity is an act of\nbetrayal, the perception of how bad the act seems to the victim could be a product of how\nmany other people are betraying him/her. If a partner has sex with a stranger, only one\nperson is betraying the victim (i.e., the partner). But if the partner has sex with a victim's\nfriend or sibling, two people are betraying the victim (i.e., the partner and the \"other\nperson\"). If relatives are seen as a general class of allies that are more socially close than\nInfidelity and kin selection\nnonrelatives, infidelity involving a relative will involve a greater degree of betrayal than an\nact of infidelity involving a nonrelative. The betrayal perspective could explain the\nrecurring finding in both experiments that infidelity involving nonrelatives is less\ndistressing than infidelity involving relatives, and the betrayal explanation is not\nnecessarily incompatible with kin selection theory. As Fisher et al. (2009) proposed,\ndistress over infidelity with relatives could be caused by the damage it causes to social\nbonds. The social bonds themselves could be a product of kin selection, so it is possible\nthat kin selection does not attenuate distress over infidelity with relatives because of the\ngreater advantages gained from maintaining good relationships. Being on good terms with\nrelatives may produce greater ultimate benefits to fitness than overlooking infidelity with\nrelatives. In other words, distress may be greater for infidelity with relatives because of the\ngreater incentive to keep social bonds strong.\nWith this disparity between predictions and outcomes, it is important to point out\nthat Hamilton (1963, 1964) described only the conditions under which kin-favoring\nadaptations could evolve. This does not guarantee that these adaptations always will evolve\nunder the specified conditions, or that species will evolve adaptations to maximize\ninclusive fitness in every way. The current results show what role (or lack thereof) kin\nselection plays in infidelity with relatives, and suggest that more research is needed before\nthe picture is complete. It is possible that kin selection has shaped attitudes towards\ninfidelity in ways not observed in this study. One possibility for future research could\ninclude dependent measures other than ratings of feelings of distress. Shackelford, Buss,\nand Bennett (2002) used likelihood of breaking up as a measure of reaction to infidelity.\nEven if the current study found no differences in feelings of distress over infidelity\ninvolving relatives and nonrelatives, future work might find that kin selection still\nmanifests itself by making victims of infidelity more likely to forgive relatives than\nnonrelatives or less likely to react violently toward relatives.\nIt is important to consider that the current results are largely based on participants'\nself-reported reactions to hypothetical scenarios. People may not be able to accurately\npredict how they would actually react if they discovered their partners were being\nunfaithful. For example, Harris (2003) claimed that sex differences in jealousy only occur\nfor hypothetical infidelity scenarios and not in real situations involving infidelity, although\nSagarin et al. (2012) disputed this. Studies have replicated sex differences in jealousy in\nresponse to actual, not hypothetical, infidelity experiences (e.g., Edlund, Heider, Scherer,\nFarc, and Sagarin, 2006). Regarding infidelity scenarios involving imagined relatives,\nBohner et al. (2010) reported that when participants rated their feelings of distress for\ninfidelity involving partners of their siblings, there was no difference in the responses\nbetween participants who actually had siblings and those who did not. This prior work\nsupports the use of hypothetical infidelity scenarios involving a variety of real and\nimagined relationships, although an ideal study would involve collecting data from people\nwho actually have experienced infidelity with a variety of relatives and nonrelatives. But\neven this study would have shortcomings: People may not honestly report how they felt or\nreacted, and their memories of the experience may not be accurate. Even so, in Experiment\n1 we attempted to collect some data on people's real-life infidelity experiences. These data\ndid not inform the study's main hypothesis, but they did confirm that people's experiences\nInfidelity and kin selection\nwith infidelity were negative overall and that people who had experienced infidelity did not\ndiffer from other people in their responses to hypothetical scenarios.\nAnother potential shortcoming of the current study is that demand characteristics\nmay have influenced participants' responses. By viewing contrasting targets such as a\nvariety of relatives and nonrelatives, the experiments may have implicitly suggested that\nreactions should be different in each of these scenarios. A between-groups comparison in\nwhich participants evaluate only one type of relationship might serve to alleviate some of\nthese concerns, although this design might also be susceptible to ceiling effects--if\nparticipants evaluate only one type of infidelity scenario they might report that any type of\ninfidelity produces the highest possible amount of distress. Future research could address\nthese considerations by perhaps emphasizing the potential for different infidelity scenarios\nto produce equal amounts of distress (Lishner et al., 2008).\nThere may also be concerns regarding the composition of the samples used in the\ncurrent experiments. Both samples were predominantly female, and the small number of\nmale participants likely does not allow for meaningful analyses of sex differences.\nAlthough the current study did not focus on sex differences, prior work on sex differences\nin jealousy (e.g., Buss et al., 1992) suggests that men and women react differently to\ninfidelity scenarios. One should therefore be cautious in generalizing the current work to\nmale populations, and future work could investigate sex differences directly by utilizing a\nlarger male sample. It may be that the impact of infidelity with relatives on fitness is\ndifferent for men and women depending on who the other person is, in that a man's wife is\nequally likely to be impregnated by his father, uncle, or brother, but a woman's husband\nmay have a greater chance of impregnating her sister than her mother or aunt. It is also\npossible that likelihood of impregnation is not a factor in how people perceive infidelity\nwith relatives, and the main consideration is betrayal.\nFinally, as with all psychological phenomena, explanations can focus on the\nproximate (\"how\") level, the ultimate (\"why\") level, or both (Scott-Phillips, Dickins, and\nWest, 2011). As Scott-Phillips et al. point out, behavioral scientists sometimes mistake\nproximate explanations for more ultimate ones, and the shorthand of talking about what\norganisms \"want\" is often misunderstood to describe those organisms' intentions instead of\ngenetically-predisposed biological drives. Natural selection could have produced\nadaptations sensitive to different forms of infidelity without humans necessarily being\nconsciously aware of those adaptations. Although the current study does attempt to explain\nreactions to infidelity at the ultimate level, explanations involving proximate mechanisms\n(such as reactions to betrayal and sensitivity to genetic relatedness) are difficult to rule out.\nIn conclusion, one of the major benefits of incorporating evolutionary theory into\npsychology is that it facilitates the generation of testable predictions. The downside to this\napproach is that we have to be careful of confirmation bias, which would lead us to search\nonly for evidence that supports our existing theories. In order to strengthen the field of\nevolutionary psychology we should also search for and report evidence that disconfirms our\npredictions. The current study represents an example of a prediction generated by\nevolutionary theory for which the results were not supportive, and its value lies in\ndemonstrating the limited influence of kin selection on infidelity scenarios.\nInfidelity and kin selection\n"
