Social mobility. Lineages . Inequality\nIntroduction\nMuch demographic research focuses on the behavior of individuals, including their\nfertility, sex practices, health, migration, intergenerational exchanges, socialization of\nchildren, contact with kin or other networks, residential mobility, and educational and\neconomic decisions and accomplishments. Yet it is ultimately our job to understand the\nimplications of these studies for population renewal and change. A concern with how\npopulations work, not just with representativeness of individual-level observations in\nR. D. Mare (*)\nDepartment of Sociology, University of California\u00adLos Angeles, 264 Haines Hall, Box 951551,\ne-mail: mare@ucla.edu\npopulations, is the distinguishing feature of population science. I am concerned with\nthe type of demography that deals fundamentally with the interdependence of\npopulation change and the kinds of causes and effects that are the bread and butter\nof empirical population studies. I focus on the problem of the generations in\ndemography--specifically, intergenerational processes and how our field should\nstudy them. My broadest theme is that in our portfolio of research, we may have\noveremphasized a concern with direct relations between parents and children in\nmicro-level studies of family behavior. Conversely, we have underemphasized a\nconcern with the influence of more remote kin and the role that parent-child\nrelations, in general, play in the transformation of populations. I suggest that we\nshould attend more closely to (1) the social connections more distant than parent to\nchild, especially those across three or more generations of kinship; (2) the\nmultigenerational effects of processes within the nuclear family, even when effects\nare transmitted almost solely by nuclear families; (3) not only to the personal\neffects of teaching, resource transmission, psychosocial influence between\nmembers of different generations but also to the demography of reproduction:\nfertility, mortality, marriage, and migration; and (4) new data and measures that\naccommodate multigenerational units of analysis, such as family lineages.\nIn the first part of this essay, I discuss concepts, such as \"multigenerational\"\nand \"inequality;\" the competing claims about whether or not there is evidence for\nmultigenerational effects; and our typical practice of looking at only one or two\ngenerations at a time, especially in the study of intergenerational social mobility.\nIn the second section, I suggest mechanisms that give rise to multigenerational\neffects, focusing mainly on how social institutions, broadly construed, give rise\nto multigenerational effects, because they transcend individual lives and\ndifferentially affect the wealthy, the middle class, and the poor. I also touch\nupon some biological mechanisms that may lead to a higher level of\nmultigenerational continuity than our typical two-generation models imply. In\nthe third section, I describe the interdependence of inter- and multigenerational\neffects with population renewal, and present examples of research that shows the\nfruits of taking a multigenerational perspective.\nWhy Study Multigenerational Effects?\nThis essay might be construed as a plea to study the demography of dynasties, that\nis, populations of family-based units that persist over many generations. However, I\navoid the term dynasty, largely because human mating patterns make the existence\nand identification of distinct dynasties demographically impossible in all but the\nmost inbred of island communities or in kinship schemes that accord unequivocal\nprimacy to one sex or the other (e.g., Bernheim and Bagwell 1988). Thus, I use\nterms like \"inheritance,\" \"multigenerational,\" and \"lineage.\" I am indeed interested\nin the possibility of social influence across more than two generations and the\nexistence of gradually changing yet persistent family entities, but I leave imprecise\nthe degree of interdependence among these multigenerational entities, which is likely\nto vary across populations with varying rules about marriage and other lateral social\nties. For the purposes of this essay, I regard a family as a group of individuals who\n2 R.D. Mare\nare descended from a common ancestor or connected through marriage or adoption.\nThe content of family life, including norms and practices of intrafamilial obligation,\nunderstandings of who is or is not a family member, and the emotional connections\namong kin, may vary considerably between and within populations.\nThat nuclear family\u00adbased research can be culture-bound and present-bound is\nhardly a new point. It underpins anthropological and sociological approaches that\ntreat kin ties as problematic and mysterious rather than given. Rather than analyzing\nprocesses within a fixed set of family relations, these types of research ask where\nand when different forms of kin-related behavior arise. Similarly, research on\neconomic development and ethnographic research on many topics address the\ncomplex social relationships within and between households and across multiple\ngenerations. But most of our core research, especially work focused on developed\nsocieties, is rooted in a paradigm of parent-to-child or parent-to\u00adadult offspring\nconnections. This is a typical assumption in one of my own research areas,\nintergenerational mobility--especially educational, occupational, and income\nmobility (see, e.g., Mare 1981)--but it pervades our field. We study parent-child\ninteractions and bequests and other transfers from elderly parents to adult offspring.\nWe study the effects of family background and social class on all manner of\n\"outcomes\" in our work. We may do this for good reasons, although we may also do\nit just because it is expedient. Either way, I suggest that we should attend to a\nbroader set of connections.\nThe reasonableness of a call for more attention to the effects of grandparents and\nother more remote ties notwithstanding, some careful skeptics have already\ninvestigated the presumed effects of grandparents and other ancestors on children\nnet of the effects of parents and found these effects weak or nonexistent. For\nexample, Cherlin and Furstenberg (1992), in their landmark study of grandparents,\nconcluded that grandparents are valued kin, but their influence on grandchildren\nbeyond what the parents can do is usually limited. Warren and Hauser (1997)\nshowed, in their analysis of three generations of families in the Wisconsin\nLongitudinal Study, that occupational status is transmitted from parent to child\nwithout net assistance from grandparents.\nDespite these null findings, however, we should still give further consideration to\nmultigenerational effects. The conclusions of these studies may not be invariant\nacross time and place; that is, they may depend on the particular institutional\narrangements, samples, or populations on which they are based. In later sections of\nthis essay, I review studies in a variety of contexts that provide highly suggestive\nevidence for grandparent effects. But even if nuclear families are the only key agents\nof influence and their effects are strong, they may persist beyond one generation. For\nexample, if parents' wealth strongly influences offspring's wealth, then the fortunes\nof a family in one generation propagate several generations down the road. The turn\nof our field toward careful specification of causal relations, the use of experiments,\nrandom assignments of roommates, \"natural\" instruments, or other devices to rule\nout spurious associations as an explanation for apparent effects should also address\nlonger-term impacts across generations. We may know how to change the lives of\nindividuals, but can we change families, lineages, or entire populations?\nThe impact of one generation on the next is not as straightforward as the simply\nestimated \"effect\" of parents on offspring. Even in a Markovian world, in which\nA Multigenerational View of Inequality 3\nindividuals affect their children but not their grandchildren, above and beyond their\nindirect influence through the characteristics and behavior of their own children, we\nshould not just multiply intergenerational correlations or elasticities together to\nestimate the multigenerational impact (though that is a rough and ready place to\nstart). Such effects are convoluted with those of reproduction. The demographic\nsignificance of our focus on intergenerational correlation lies in the interdependence\nof the effects of one set of individuals on another combined with the births, deaths,\nmarriages, and geographic mobility of individuals.\nA further theme is that the rigorous search for proof of causal links between the\nactions or traits of one set of individuals and the actions or traits of other individuals\n(e.g., the effects of the behavior or resources of parents on outcomes for children)\nneeds to be balanced by the multiple concerns of population science. In considering\nthe effects of families on outcomes for individuals, population research must also\nfocus on the creation of families. The latter is, of course, an abiding concern of many\nfamily demographers, but it tends to be neglected in studies that treat family\ncharacteristics as exogenous with respect to outcomes for the next generation. This\nconcern is related to, but distinct from, other key issues that arise when we try to\ngeneralize from samples of individuals to entire populations. One such issue is the\nimplications of proven causal relations for whole populations in experiments or other\nresearch strategies that approximate randomized studies: can we generalize from the\nlimited variation in a given study to the full variation observed in whole populations,\nor know how a social intervention that succeeds in a demonstration project will play\nout if applied to everyone, including people who live side-by-side and potentially\nA second issue is with the implications of average or local effects when treatments\ncontrast, my concern is that when we look at the effects of causes, we should not\nignore the causes of effects (e.g., Morgan and Winship 2007). Put differently, rather\nthan focusing exclusively at the effects of treatments, we need to ask, Under what\nconditions do these treatments occur? If many scholars are interested in the effects of\nfamilies on children, at least some demographers should ask, Where do these\nfamilies come from? But the latter question should not be considered in isolation\nfrom the former. The causes beget the effects, which beget the causes, and so it goes.\nBut how it goes depends critically on how multiple generations are connected.\nFinally, although the link between parent and child at various life stages is\ntangible and well worth studying, we should also widen our focus on what to\nmeasure, what to count, and what to be puzzled about. A true multigenerational\nperspective requires that we describe more than just individuals, parent-child pairs,\nor nuclear families.\nMultigenerational Effects and Inequality\nSocial and economic inequalities are foci of much population research, whether\nabout the effects of families on life chances; differences in family, fertility, and\nmarriage; residential segregation; disparities in health and mortality; poverty; or\nother topics. Taking a long view of inequality--longer than a single generation and\nenriched by an appreciation of demographic processes--there may be more than\n4 R.D. Mare\nmeets the eye. One of the key issues in our understanding of inequality is the role\nplayed by intergenerational mobility in loosening or tightening the link between the\nsocioeconomic positions, rewards, and statuses of one generation and those of the\nnext. High mobility lessens the sting of being at the wrong end of inequality if the\nlife chances of one's offspring are only loosely tied to one's own. Indeed, high rates\nof intergenerational mobility may undermine lineages if family members are not able\nto confer their advantages to their decedents. Averaged across generations,\ninequalities are smaller when mobility rates are high. Conversely, high rates of\nintergenerational persistence amplify the costs and benefits of one's socioeconomic\nposition, lead to higher inequalities when averaged across generations, and sustain\nfamily lineages. This is all the more true if intergenerational persistence is further\nreinforced by multigenerational effects--if, for example, children receive extra\nbenefits from having well-positioned grandparents, regardless of where their own\nparents stand in social hierarchies. Finally, because fertility, mortality, and migration\nare interdependent with socioeconomic position, they may amplify or dampen\nwhatever gross inequality effects are implied by rates of mobility alone. In short, the\nstrength of multigenerational effects is inherently an issue of inequality, whether in\nmoney, health, knowledge, or survival chances.\nThe Two-Generation Paradigm\nThe staple of research on the intergenerational transmission of inequality is the analysis\nof intergenerational correlations or associations or transition rates. The study of\neducational, occupational, and income mobility is a venerable subject in sociology, a\nsubject of lively interest in economics during the past 20 years, and periodically a topic\nfor historians. Multivariate versions of this work include multiple aspects of family\nbackground, including socioeconomic statuses; family size, structure, and stability; and\nmultiple outcomes. The outcomes extend to child development, delinquency, health\nbehavior, and health status, thereby involving other disciplines as well. Longitudinal\nextensions of this research document life transitions and trajectories.\nA good example of how central this type of work is to population research is\nprovided by Palloni's (2006) PAA Presidential Address, in which he showed how\nthe socioeconomic position of families affects the health of young children, and how\nhealth in early childhood may, in turn, affect later health and socioeconomic success.\nVariants of this approach apply to intergenerational transfers of encouragement,\nknowledge, money, time, space, and other assistance. They are a platform for\ndetailed description. And they are the basis for theories about how parents and\noffspring decide about schooling; marriage and divorce; childbearing; work; and\nretirement; and, along the way, they save, spend, transfer, and bequeath. In short, for\nmost of us, this is the familiar social science perspective.\nOur basic studies of fertility and mortality likewise tend to focus on only one or\ntwo generations. This is true whether we are conducting micro-level studies of levels\nand differentials in vital processes or making macro-level projections and studies of\npopulation dynamics. An occasional interesting paper on grandparent influence on\nfertility notwithstanding, our basic understanding of reproduction is that populations\nrenew through an independent sequence of two-generation relationships. In our\nempirical models, each generation of mothers bears children who, in turn, bear\nA Multigenerational View of Inequality 5\nchildren independently of the actions of the grandparents. In formal and applied\ndemography, we project populations by multiplying together Leslie matrices, which\nsummarize the fertility and mortality rates of each generation (e.g., Keyfitz and\nCaswell 2005). Of course, we do recognize that populations are heterogeneous in\nfertility and other vital rates. Much of our work is, in fact, about heterogeneity in\nvital processes. Microdemographers discover, describe, and explain differences\nin fertility and mortality rates; and macrodemographers, following the principle that\nheterogeneous populations always grow faster than a homogeneous population with\nthe average of the heterogeneous rates (e.g., Keyfitz and Caswell 2005), analyze the\nimplications of this heterogeneity for population dynamics. Our formal Markovian\nmodels of population renewal can be combined with our empirical models of\nintergenerational effects. Indeed, those of us who have worked on blending models\nof intergenerational transmission with population renewal make liberal use of this\nWhat unites this large body of work is an exclusive focus on one or two\ngenerations at a time: mother and daughter, father and son, sisters and brothers,\nhusband and wife, elderly and adult offspring. Whether focusing on parent-child\ncorrelation, husband-wife correlations, or sibling correlations, our models and\nresearch questions are concentrated in a tight web of first-order contacts, indeed a\nspecial subset of such contacts defined by close kinship.\nThe Significance and Sources of Multigenerational Effects\nWhy should we be concerned about the narrowness of this focus, and why should\nwe think otherwise? After all, this paradigm has been productive and, along the way,\nwe have had occasional reassuring empirical demonstrations that a two-generation\nrather than a multigenerational view of intergenerational mobility will suffice. In\naddition to the multigenerational studies that have yielded negative effects to which I\nhave already referred, one can go back to Hodge's (1966:33) conclusion that\nAlthough neither type of mobility [inter- or intragenerational] can be fully\ndescribed with Markov process, the observed similarity to such a process is\nindicative of the high degree of discontinuity which characterizes both the\ncareers of individuals over their working lives and the social position of\nfamilies over several generations.\nThis is an important claim about how societies and populations work. It implies\nthat hierarchies of families are relatively transitory. Whereas inequalities among\nsocial positions and the rewards associated with them may persist, the families\nwhose members occupy these positions and receive the associated rewards are\nshuffled substantially from one generation to next. Not only are rates of\nintergenerational mobility relatively high, but also families are unable to extend\ntheir influence by more than a single generation. In two-generation approaches to\nfamily influence, parents directly affect their offspring, just as they themselves have\nbeen affected by their own parents. When it comes to thinking about longer-run\nchange, following the Hodge conclusion, we think in terms of simple causal chains.\nThat is, grandparents do not directly affect their grandchildren. Rather, the influence\nof generation t on generation t + 2 is only indirect, via generation t + 1. The\n6 R.D. Mare\nalternative, however, is to consider lagged (legacy) effects of grandparents (and\nancestry more generally). In a three-generation model, the characteristics of\ngeneration t and t + 1 affect the characteristics of generation t + 2. More generally,\nwe can consider potential effects of the characteristics of generation t on those of any\nsubsequent generation t + k. In principle, whether a two-generational or a\nmultigenerational view of mobility and inequality is closer to the truth should, in\nconsidering any particular population, be a matter of empirical investigation.\nMarkovian and Non-Markovian Inheritance\nA high level of continuity from one generation to the next in the lives of families may be\nconsistent with either a Markovian or non-Markovian view of the world. In thinking\nabout families of great wealth that appear to persist from one generation to the next, we\nshould distinguish between two possibilities: (1) a high correlation between the wealth\nof parents and the (eventual) wealth of their children, yet a pattern of correlations across\nseveral generations that is nonetheless consistent with Markovian persistence (i.e., with\nthe net irrelevance of grandparent wealth for grandchild wealth); or (2) a high set of\ncorrelations among the wealth of several generations that is formally inconsistent with\nsimple Markovian inheritance and that imply effects across several generations. If by\nmultigenerational effects we mean a longer-run set of intergenerational connections than\njust a string of tight parent-to-child connections, then the bar is higher for establishing a\nconceptual basis for multigenerational effects and for empirical demonstration of their\nexistence. For most of my discussion, I focus on families connected by more than a\nstring of two-generation correlations, however strong they may be. Yet multigenera-\ntional and Markovian continuity of families may be hard to distinguish. In a world of\nabsolutely perfect status inheritance--for example, a pure caste system--parents,\ngrandparents, and earlier ancestors are, for the purpose of analysis, identical in their\nsocial and economic positions. The perfect correlations between each generation make\nalternative types of intergenerational effects indistinguishable. In most real populations,\nhowever, intergenerational associations are far from perfect, and it becomes an empirical\nmatter whether remote ancestors have an independent effect on one's social position net\nof the effects of one's parents. Further, whether multigenerational effects are present\nmay not be an all-or-nothing matter. An interesting case is one in which status\ninheritance is nearly perfect at the very top or very bottom of a hierarchy. Here, the usual\nmodels of two-generation association may apply to families in the middle of the\nsocioeconomic distribution, but at the extremes, an individual's fortunes may depend on\nthe actions and experiences of a more distant ancestor who was lucky or unlucky enough\nto achieve great wealth or abject poverty.\nMechanisms of Multigenerational Influence\nInstitutions and Intergenerational Persistence of Durable and Perishable Wealth\nIf we consider non-Markovian patterns of inheritance, we must ask, Where do\nlagged effects come from? A broad class of mechanisms that may give rise to these\neffects is the social institutions that sustain them. To understand how individuals\nA Multigenerational View of Inequality 7\nmay affect one another across more than one generational divide, we must consider\nhow institutions contribute to these effects. Institutions, which are formal or informal\nsocial arrangements that persist over time, are supported by demography, geography,\npower, and cultural legitimacy. Because children and their parents typically keep in\ntouch with each other and studying parent-child pairs is relatively easy, social\nscientists tend to maintain a two-generation view of the world. But institutions have\na key feature: in general, they outlive individuals. The maintenance of institutions\nand their enduring impacts on families and individuals may be an important source\nof multigenerational effects. Family institutions themselves are the obvious ones. If\nroles are prescribed for grandparents, this is by definition an institutional mechanism\nthat may provide grandparent support. But a broader set of institutions encompasses\nthe law, family, work, education, and finance. Importantly, the institutions that\ngovern multigenerational effects vary across social hierarchies.\nSocial scientists talk with varying degrees of rigor about different forms of\ncapital: for example, physical, financial, human, social, and occupational. It is useful\nto think about some of these forms of capital in terms of their perishability. That is,\nonce they exist, how long do they keep? A key potential multigenerational effect\nworks through great wealth amassed in a single lifetime but passed on from\ngeneration to generation. The accumulation of a stock of physical and financial\ncapital in one generation takes a family out of the middle-class mode of wealth\naccumulation and transmission. For the contemporary middle class, wealth\naccumulates in gradual phases of saving within a single lifetime: for buying a\nhouse, for paying for college, and for retirement. Parental wealth at midlife is largely\ntransformed into the human capital of the next generation--indexed by educational\nattainment and used in occupational settings--making possible the next generation's\nturn at wealth accumulation. Human capital and occupational incumbency may keep\nwell for most of a lifetime, but unless they are transformed into financial capital (a\nbig obstacle for most members of the paid labor force), they tend to perish thereafter.\nOn the other hand, physical and financial capital can, if substantial enough,\ntranscend individual lives.1\nIntergenerational Correlations\nIn this light, it is easy to understand the history of sociological and economic\nresearch on the intergenerational correlation of various socioeconomic statuses.\nStarting in the 1960s, sociologists showed that correlations between the educational\nattainments or the occupational attainments of fathers and sons (using various scales\nand measures) ranged from about .35 to .40 (e.g., Blau and Duncan 1967). Yet the\nintergenerational correlations of incomes, measured using the data available at that\ntime, were much lower, around .15 (e.g., Bielby and Hauser 1977). Stocks of human\n1 The perishability of capital may result in part from depreciation--that is, a reduction in value because of\nuse, age, and obsolescence. But it also results from consumption or investment losses (in the case of\nfinancial capital) and retirement or death (in the case of human and cultural capital). Strictly speaking,\nsome forms of human capital may \"survive\" beyond a single life. Specific forms of human capital (e.g.,\nthe skills of an artisan) may be directly transmitted from parent to offspring. In contemporary societies,\nhowever, where we rely heavily on educational institutions and on-the-job training, most forms of human\nand occupational capital tend to perish after the holder of these capacities or entitlements retires or dies.\n8 R.D. Mare\ncapital, indexed by educational attainment, and occupational entitlements are\nrelatively durable and can last most of an adult life. By contrast, income flows,\nunless exceptionally large, are comparatively highly perishable. However, in the\ndata in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), showed that averages of\nsequences of parent and of offspring incomes yield much higher correlations on the\norder of .4, about the same as the educational and occupational correlations\ndiscovered 30 years before. Since then, numerous econometric studies, using longer\nsequences of parent and offspring incomes in the PSID, as well as more reliable\nadministrative income data, have pushed estimates of the intergenerational\ncorrelations of incomes ever higher. For example, a widely cited study by Mazumder\n(2005), using Social Security earnings data, puts the estimate at around .6. Similar\nresults show up for other countries. The longer and more reliable the income\nsequences we use in such correlational studies, the closer we may approximate the\nintergenerational correlation of wealth. Studies of wealth transmission per se are\nrarer because of data and conceptual problems. It is beyond this essay to review\nthese difficulties, but suffice it to say that wealth presents hard issues about\nownership, fungibility, units of analysis, convertibility, and liquidity that go beyond\nour difficulties in thinking about and measuring incomes, occupations, or human\ncapital. These problems notwithstanding, wealth tends to be more unequally\ndistributed and more highly correlated across generations than the other three\ndimensions of inequality that have been studied so extensively.\nUpper- Versus Middle-Class Modes of Inheritance: Financial and Human Capital\nWhen it comes to wealth, high intergenerational correlations suggest multigenerational\ninfluence. Physical wealth can deteriorate, and financial wealth can be frittered away,\nbut both have the potential to last at least several generations. Not only is their shelf life\nless constrained by the limits to a human life, but also they can be augmented through\nfurther investment that is not tied to the lives of individuals. Some families are so\nwealthy that their fortunes could not be destroyed in several generations even if heirs\nwere perversely motivated to try. More important, financial wealth in the form of a\nfamily business, farm, or simply a large capital account frees subsequent generations\nfrom relying on the perishable and uncertain forms of wealth provided through\neducational and occupational pursuits. It breaks the middle-class cycle that dominates\nmost families' lives and, for that matter, most of our research.\nWealth is also sustained by legal and commercial forces. Although \"wealth\nmanagement\" is a service that has concrete meaning for the few, legal arrangements\nsuch as \"generation-skipping trusts\" are well-institutionalized mechanisms for\nassuring that wealthy grandparents will enrich their grandchildren.\nSocial and residential isolation can also reinforce wealth persistence. Exclusive\nneighborhoods, clubs, and social registers are visible trappings of wealth. Despite the\nlimited importance of educational competition for the very wealthy, elite educational\ninstitutions may consolidate family position across generations. The legacy system\nof college admissions, practiced in the nation's private universities during the first\nthree-quarters of the twentieth century, was a key mechanism of elite persistence.\nExploring the history of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton during the heyday of the\nA Multigenerational View of Inequality 9\nlegacy system, Karabel (2005) documented the benefit that applicants to these\nschools received from having a father who was an alumnus. In 1951, for example,\nrates of admission were 73% for sons of Yale alumni, 79% for Princeton sons, and a\nstaggering 94% for Harvard sons. By themselves, these data may be consistent with\na two-generation model, although the admission rates for Harvard sons were so high\nthat later generations owed a specific debt to the ancestor who became the first\nHarvard man in his family. But these rates were, in all likelihood, enhanced by\nmultigenerational effects. Young men whose fathers did not attend one of these\nschools but whose grandfathers attended or donated to the university were highly\nadvantaged in admission. Men whose Ivy League grandfathers had no sons and who\ncould not have an Ivy League mother in the pre-coeducation era drew legacy\nbenefits from grandfathers.\nThe demographic import of Ivy League colleges Harvard, Princeton, and Yale is\nlimited, both today and in the past. Nonetheless, we should attend to Karabel's\nobservations because, among other reasons, the legacy system illustrates an\ninstitutional mechanism of multigenerational influence. He also showed the uneasy\nrelationship between the direct inheritance of privilege by the wealthy and the\nindirect and less certain advantage via the more meritocratic educational pathway for\nthe middle class. Legacy admission to private colleges was and is a practice that\nextends well beyond the Ivy League (e.g., Kahlenberg 2010). And it may be on the\nrise in other types of schools as well. For example, some affluent Los Angeles\u00adarea\ncommunities have attempted to establish legacy systems in K-12 public schools that\nmake special provisions for grandchildren of area residents (Mehta 2009), paralleling\nsimilar practices already in place at private schools.\nAlthough I have stressed the importance of wealth inheritance among the very\nwealthy, a number of studies document transfers across multiple generations for\nfamilies that are not wealthy. For example, Quisumbing (1997) showed that\ngrandparents in the Philippines pass family wealth directly to grandchildren: land\nto grandsons and educational finance to granddaughters. Iglesias and Riboud (1988)\nreported strong net effects of grandparent effects on \"child quality\" in Spain.\nArdington et al. (2010) documented the subtle interdependence of three generations\nin South Africa, depending on whether grandchildren have been orphaned by parents\nwho died of AIDS and the availability and capacity of grandparents who may be\ncaregivers. Coate et al. (2010) used the PSID to investigate expenditures in extended\nfamilies (including, importantly, noncoresiding kin). Extended families do not\nbehave as a unit, nor do they behave as isolated individuals. Their analysis confirms\nthat for many families in the United States, grandparents play a big role in their\ngrandchildren's schooling options and decisions. And LaFave and Thomas (2010)\ndemonstrated that decisions about family resource allocation in Indonesia extend\nbeyond coresident household members, with positive effects of extrahousehold\nresources for children's health.\nNeeds for and Availability of Kin\nAnother set of mechanisms through which individuals may be affected by kin\nmore remote than their parents involves the needs for and the availability of kin,\nespecially when death, divorce, or migration take parents away or when\neconomic hardship weakens parents' capacity to provide for their children. In the\nUnited States, the mid-twentieth century was a unique time for children:\nUhlenberg (2009) showed that, compared with recent cohorts, children born in\nearlier eras were somewhat more likely to lose one or both parents as the result of\nhigher adult mortality. Children born in later eras were much more likely to suffer\nthe absence of a parent as the result of divorce, separation, and nonmarital fertility.\nBy themselves, these trends suggest potential socioeconomic needs of children and\nsingle parents during these periods. In the earlier era, children were somewhat less\nlikely to have living grandparents who could substitute for missing parents. The\ntrends suggest a greater, albeit highly variable role for whatever extra kin were\navailable. In the later era, in contrast, grandparents and possibly other older kin are\nmore likely to be available.\nKin need and kin availability are issues for the entire population, but their effects\nhave emphasized the growing inequality in the availability and quality of potential\nkin, owing to shifting differences in fertility, marriage, and assortative mating that\nfavor more-educated and prosperous families. Disparity in the socioeconomic\nstanding of grandparents has emerged in recent years, just when children may need\ntheir grandparents the most. The variations in patterns of kin availability and kin\nneed over the past 100 years in this country and even more so worldwide are strong\nevidence that parent-to-child correlations or transactions are too narrow a basis for\nthe study of intergenerational social mobility, intergenerational effects more\ngenerally, or the population dynamics that may result.\nThe changing living arrangements and availability of kin for children, while\nwell-known to demographers, exemplify a general phenomenon that has\nimportant implications for the study of intergenerational mobility. The conclusions we\ndraw about mobility, whether the amount of mobility, the inheritance of social position,\nor the position of people relative to their forebears, depends critically on how we think\nabout the web of kin who make up one's family background. Biblarz and Raftery (1993)\nsuggested that occupational mobility is greater (inheritance smaller) in single-parent\nfamilies and conjectured weaker intergenerational links in the black population\nthan among whites as a result. Beller (2009) showed that trend estimates of\nintergenerational occupational mobility that have focused only on fathers have, by\nignoring the growth in the combined influences of the socioeconomic positions of\nfathers and mothers, missed a sharp upswing in intergenerational persistence.\nWhen family position is indexed by both parents, occupational inheritance has, in\nfact, increased markedly across recent cohorts. The increased intergenerational\npersistence of occupational status reflects both the growing economic importance\nof women's work in the status of families and also secular increases in educational\nhomogamy (e.g., Schwartz and Mare 2005). These associations are not direct\nevidence of a multigenerational effect; they are simply the net associations between\nthe characteristics of parents and those of their offspring. That mothers have\nalways been important and have become economically more important is a useful\nthough familiar point (e.g., Sweeney 2002). But the greater point is the more\ngeneral one: our inferences about intergenerational effects depend on which\nrelationships we consider. Because the quantity and quality of these relationships\ndepend on evolving demographic patterns, no fixed set of family relationships\nA Multigenerational View of Inequality 11\nsuffices for summarizing intergenerational mobility. This conclusion undermines\nthe value of the usual practice of studying intergenerational socioeconomic\nmobility by focusing only on a single, predetermined parent-child association.\nSocial Isolation and the Persistence of Hardship\nAt the bottom of the socioeconomic distribution are extreme disadvantages for both\nindividuals and families over more than one generation. Institutionalized subjugation,\nsuch as slavery or serfdom, while in place, ensures intergenerational continuity at the\nbottom or even outside of a system of social stratification. But even when such\nsubjugation is removed, its effects may persist (1) through new institutions of\nsubjugation, (2) through such deep human and physical capital deprivation that\nupward mobility is nearly impossible, or (3) through extreme segregation that\nisolates the nominally free from mainstream systems of wealth acquisition and\nmobility. In the case of African American slavery and its aftermath, abundant\nresearch has documented each of these mechanisms. Blackmon (2008), for\nexample, described the regimes of indentured labor combined with corrupt law\nenforcement that bound black men to exploitive employers in the period between\nothers have documented the massive and persistent wealth disparities between\nblacks and whites. A long tradition of demographic research has documented the\nextreme spatial isolation of African Americans (e.g., Duncan and Duncan 1957;\nthat institutionalized residential isolation has weighed heavily on successive\ngenerations of some of the poorest members of society.\nMore direct evidence of the legacy of social isolation is contained in work by Sharkey\nand Elwert (2010) on residential immobility and strong deleterious effects on children\nof living in poor neighborhoods. Using the PSID, they isolated the impact of\ngrandparents' neighborhood conditions on grandchild outcomes. They showed the\nnegative impact of the poverty level of the neighborhood where a child's parents grew\nup, controlling for the neighborhood in which the child lives, on black children's\nreading performance. They showed independent effects of both neighborhoods that\ncombine to an estimated one-half of a standard deviation in reading performance. This\nwork not only suggests a pathway for multigenerational persistence of disadvantage at\nthe low end of the socioeconomic distribution but also suggests that we should cast a\nwider net in considering multigenerational effects. That is, grand-kin are important,\nbut \"grand-neighborhoods\" may be as well.\nCumulative Advantage and Disadvantage\nWhereas some of the effects of prior generations are mainly contingent on the\nconfiguration of available kin--that is, whether two parents are available or surrogates\nfrom elsewhere in the family, including grandparents, are called in--other effects are\nmore systematic and independent of kin availability. Yet even kin availability has a\nsystematic component to the extent that it reflects long-run trends in fertility, mortality,\nmarital disruption, women's work roles, and other patterns. These systematic\nmechanisms of persistent effects beyond one's own family of origin have in common\na principle of cumulative advantage or disadvantage--that is, that conditions established\nin the remote past have an enduring impact and cumulate rather than equilibrate across\ngenerations. In a two-generation model, families who are unusually well-off in one\ngeneration are likely to \"regress\" toward the average in the next. Conversely, families\nwho are unusually poor in one generation are more likely to \"bounce back\" in the next.\nThis is, from an egalitarian standpoint, a happy consequence of Markovian inheritance.\nBut in a multigenerational view, some families may be able to \"build on\" advantages\nthey already have and move up further in successive generations; other families may\nformalized the concept of \"cumulative advantage\" in careers or lifetimes. DiPrete and\nEirich unified Merton's classic ideas about scientific careers--past performance\nsignaling future productivity, the role of chance events, and the Matthew (reputation)\neffect--with more recent ideas about superstar markets, gene-environment\ninteractions, and other mechanisms. Yet whereas these authors are concerned with\nthe course of individual lives, related ideas and models may, with suitable\nmodifications, be applied to intergenerational processes as well. Cumulative\nadvantage can be an intergenerational process if we allow for multigenerational\neffects. Institutional mechanisms such as wealth accumulation and transfer, slavery\nand indentured employment, legacies in college admissions, kin need and\navailability, and segregation may amplify differences between individuals born\ninto different families. If they do so to a greater extent than would be expected on\nthe basis of a two-generation model of social mobility, this would imply\nintergenerational cumulative advantage.\nNon-Markovian Fertility\nOur world is even more complicated if we acknowledge the possibilities of\nmutigenerational effects on basic demographic processes. How this plays out in its\nfull complexity is beyond any single population scientist. But we should\nacknowledge creative and promising theoretical and empirical work on this subject.\nFor example, in Israel, Danziger and Neuman (1989) found intergenerational\n\"inheritance\" of fertility along the maternal line (i.e., the greater a woman's number\nof siblings, the higher her fertility), though not along the paternal line. Cox and Stark\n(2005) theorized about \"demonstration effects\"--that is, that grandparents motivate\ntheir children to bear them grandchildren, under whose watchful eyes the middle\ngeneration will be motivated to treat the grandparents well in their old age. Meroni\nand Pronzato (2010) exploited the four generations represented in the Survey of\nHealth, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and provided evidence that the\navailability of childcare help by potential grandparents raises the fertility of the\nmiddle generation. These types of effects present an extra challenge for\nresearchers on social mobility and population transformation. Whereas the formal\ndemography of Markovian population renewal is well worked out, both for\nhomogeneous populations and populations differentiated by levels of wealth in\nwhich intergenerational mobility occurs, more work needs to be done on the\nmacrodemographic implications of non-Markovian fertility (and perhaps other\nprocesses), both for homogeneous populations and where social mobility is an\nimportant part of the process.\nA Multigenerational View of Inequality 13\nBiological Mechanisms of Multigenerational Influence\nAlthough I have described a number of social institutions that may be implicated in\nmultigenerational effects, biological mechanisms such as epigenesis may play a role as\nwell. It is beyond my expertise to review the possible effects of epigenesis, processes\nthrough which environments contribute to inherited modes of gene expression across\nmultiple generations without modification of DNA. The extent and durability of these\neffects in humans is the subject of ongoing debate and research (e.g., Gluckman and\nmay arise through grandparent effects on genetic transmission and expression in the\nfemale line. Because a (second-generation) woman's eggs are created in the weeks\nshortly after her conception, the eggs that contain her (third-generation) children's\nmaternal genetic material experience almost nine months in their (first-generation)\ngrandmother's womb. This allows for intrauterine and, indirectly, broader\nenvironmental influences of grandmothers on their children's health and development\n(Gluckman and Hanson 2005). This biological pathway of multigenerational influence is\nwell-established, although its import for the kinds of outcomes that are the focus of our\nintergenerational mobility research has been the subject of very limited research.\nSuggestive evidence in support of the importance of these mechanisms, however, is\nprovided by recent studies of the combined effects of maternal and grandmaternal\nsocioeconomic status and health-related behaviors on infant birth weight (Astone et al.\nDemography and Socioeconomic Reproduction\nThe problem of multigenerational effects becomes a true demographic issue when\nwe see how the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status combines\nwith basic demographic processes to transform populations from one period or\ngeneration to the next. Population research fundamentally rests on knowledge about\ndifferential reproduction, encompassing marriage, fertility, migration, and mortality.\nSome dramatic evidence of these processes comes from observations of population\ngenetics. For example, Zerjal et al. (2003) conjectured that a haplotype on the Y\nchromosome, which is highly prevalent in many contemporary Asian populations,\nhas been carried through a lineage of male descendants of Genghis Kahn. Although\nthe claim that these are really Genghis Kahn's genes (as opposed to those of some\nother man) is debatable, it does illustrate ambitious multigenerational thinking about\nthe implications of differential fertility, mortality, marriage, and migration. This\nresearch shows that contemporary populations do not result from a high\nintergenerational correlation between the occupations or incomes of families in the\nKhan era or by the mechanics of genetic transmission alone. Rather, they result from\npopulation dynamics, subject to mechanisms of selection that include the\naccumulation and use of wealth and power combined with superior opportunities\nfor survival of progeny. Population genetic studies are ambitious and powerful,\nstudies of the coevolution of genetic and cultural traits (e.g., Cavalli-Sforza and\nFeldman 1981), or even in the enticing possibility that high-fertility counterparts to\nGenghis Kahn are yet to be discovered in recent populations. Despite the historical\nreach of these population genetic studies, genetic transmission is, ironically, mainly a\ntwo-generation proposition. Each of us genetically is, save for some possible\nepigenetic effects, a function of what was in the reproductive cells of our mothers\nand fathers and the environments to which we have been exposed during our\nlifetimes. But what we are and where we are socially are a function of history,\nintergenerational relations, and differential reproductivity over many generations.\nGenes are the endogenous variables in these studies. And the Mongol study offers\nstrong evidence for multigenerational social effects.\nMost social science population researchers are interested in intergenerational\nprocesses based on shorter time spans for people who are more directly observable.\nYet most social mobility research avoids this issue altogether by conditioning on the\ndistributions of parents' and offspring's traits (e.g., income or educational\nattainment) and describing these associations. This tradition of work has served\nwell for answering the narrow question, \"Who gets ahead?\" (Jencks et al. 1979). But\nit is inadequate for analyzing the population question of how a socioeconomic\ndistribution in one generation gets transformed into a distribution in later\ngenerations. And it is even inadequate for such causal questions as, What would\nhappen to the next generation if we made it easier for girls (the potential mothers of\nthe next generation) to stay in school (Mare and Maralani 2006)? The educational\nattainment of girls affects whether, when, and whom they marry; how many children\nthey have and when they will have them; whether they and their families migrate;\nand, ultimately, the health and success of their children. But recognizing these\nrelationships, however, is not just a matter of specifying the direct and indirect effects of\nmothers on children. Rather, it amounts to understanding how the parent-child pairs,\nwhich form the heart of two-generation research, come about. This can lead to surprising\nresults at the population level when the effects of maternal education and differential\nfertility combine. In Indonesia, for example, patterns of intergenerational educational\nmobility, assortative mating, and differential fertility imply that the effects of efforts\nto raise the educational attainments of women will depend on where in the\neducational process such efforts are applied and whether one focuses on effects on\nfamilies or on the populations. Because fertility is highest among women with\nintermediate levels of schooling, raising the schooling of girls who would otherwise\nreceive little or no schooling (to at least some elementary or secondary schooling)\nraises the average educational attainment of the population: not only will their\nchildren have better environments while growing up, but also the girls will grow up\nto have more children. However, raising the schooling of girls who would otherwise\nhave a high school education (to receive some higher education) will benefit their\nfamilies but will have a muted effect overall because these girls will, on average,\nbear fewer children. In the latter case, the effects on the education level of families\nand populations may differ (Mare and Maralani 2006).\nIn general, mobility studies should examine the associations between parents and\noffspring in a way that takes differential fertility, child and adult mortality,\nassortative mating, and migration into account. Such studies can take account of\nintergenerational effects of parents' social position that include not just the capacity\nof parents with more resources to confer socioeconomic advantages on their\noffspring but also the net reproductive capacity of the parents. Examples of work\nA Multigenerational View of Inequality 15\nthat is in this spirit include Lam's (1986) study of income mobility and fertility in\nBrazil; Preston and Campbell's (1993) study of differential fertility and inheritance\nof IQ; and my work with Musick on single-parent families in the United States\n(Musick and Mare 2004), with Maralani on women's education in Indonesia (Mare\nand Maralani 2006), and with Choi on women's education and migration in Mexico\n(Choi and Mare 2009). All these studies explicitly or implicitly build on Feeney's\nexploiting analogies between geographic and intergenerational mobility.\nA corollary of this perspective is that, Markovian or not, intergenerational effects\nare inherently multigenerational. Interventions that change the socioeconomic\nconditions of families or individuals also change their demographic behavior, that\nis, changes in the numbers, longevity, and characteristics of future progeny. I do not\nmean to minimize how hard it is to appraise such effects. Policies targeted at girls\nmay create marriage markets that differ from those produced by policies that change\noutcomes for both boys and girls. As we look beyond one generation, our capacity to\nproject what will happen is made more complicated by the need to take account of\nboth marriage market dynamics and family effects on children. But, as in many other\nareas of demographic inquiry, historical studies with adequate data and suitable\nmodels can give us some idea of the multigenerational implications of changes in the\nsocioeconomic characteristics of parents. To my knowledge, this style of research\nhas not incorporated individual- or family-level multigenerational effects of the sort\ndiscussed in the earlier parts of this essay, whether in social mobility or in basic\ndemographic processes. This will be an important future step.\nMultigenerational Studies of Social Mobility\nI have cited a number of studies that provide suggestive evidence for grandparent\neffects on a variety of outcomes, typically for children in the third generation. The\narguments in this essay imply that more of these types of investigations will be\nfruitful. In addition to these studies, it will be desirable to revisit studies of\nintergenerational socioeconomic mobility--along the dimensions of income,\neducational attainment, occupational status, and wealth--to determine the conditions\nunder which departures from Markovian patterns of intergenerational mobility come\nabout and how different fertility, mortality, and other demographic processes\ncontribute to intergenerational effects. Two closely related lines of inquiry are\nneeded: studies of the net (\"causal\") effects of grandparents on their adult\ngrandchildren and more descriptive studies that investigate whether intergenerational\nassociations of socioeconomic distributions are consistent with the Markovian\nassumption. An example of the former type of study is Warren and Hauser's (1997)\nanalysis of occupational status attainment in three generations of Wisconsinites.\nAlthough this study revealed no net effects of grandparents' occupational statuses on\nthose of grandchildren, mid-twentieth century Wisconsin families may be a\npopulation in which multigenerational effects are unusually weak. Thus, where data\nare available, we should carry out similar studies in a variety of times, places, and\ninstitutional circumstances. Potentially fruitful contexts for this research include\nSouth Africa, China, and central Europe, societies that underwent massive social\ntransformations during the middle and late twentieth century and for which sample\nsurvey data on social mobility across three generations are available. The extreme\nhardship and segregation of blacks in South Africa, both during and in the aftermath\nof apartheid, may be a source of longer-run multigenerational continuity at the\nbottom of the socioeconomic distribution than would be expected on the basis of\nMarkovian inheritance. The pre-Soviet, Soviet, and post-Soviet eras in central\nEurope potentially created circumstances in which, for some birth cohorts,\nindividuals' socioeconomic achievements may depend more on grandparents than\nparents. Although the disruptive effects of socialist revolution on patterns of\nparent-to-offspring socioeconomic mobility in some of these societies have been\ndocumented, the potential effects of grandparents who lived primarily in the\npre-Soviet era on grandchildren who came of age in the post-Soviet era require more\nresearch. Similarly, China, which has undergone massive transformations since the\nmiddle of the twentieth century, may exhibit substantial changes in intergenerational\nand multigenerational effects. Treiman and colleagues have gathered data for each of\nthese societies on multiple generations of educational and occupational attainment,\nrelying on the retrospective reports of members of the third generation (Szelenyi and\nAlthough such studies will be useful, they should also be extended in a variety of\nways. First, they should be supplemented by demographic data and models so that\nintergenerational effects are properly weighted by the differential fertility and survival of\neach generation (e.g., Mare and Maralani 2006). As discussed earlier, the effect of a\nchange in the characteristics of a parent or grandparent is not only the simple\nregression-based estimate of the net association with offspring's characteristics but\nalso the demographic effect of differential reproduction.\nSecond, these multigenerational studies should be supplemented with studies based\non better data. Although the retrospective surveys are unique and underexploited data\nsources, they potentially suffer from survivor and recall biases. The grandparent\ngeneration can be recalled only when they have both children and grandchildren. For\nanalyses of the determinants of outcomes in the grandchild generation, this may be\nsatisfactory provided that it is possible to ignore recall errors and ignorance of\ngrandchildren about the socioeconomic characteristics of grandparents. But from the\nstandpoint of the socioeconomic reproductivity of the grandparents' cohorts, it is\nnecessary to know about the fertility and survival of those cohorts, including persons\nwho were childless. Survival and recall problems are less serious with prospective and\narchival sources. Although high-quality prospective data are not available for societies\nthat have undergone radical transformations in the past half-century, they are\nincreasingly available for a variety of other periods and countries. The best of these\ndata obtain rich information on social mobility, demographic processes, and other\ncharacteristics and behaviors. In the United States, the PSID and Health and Retirement\nStudy are the best ongoing data collection projects of this kind, and they are being used\nas templates for the study of intergenerational relations in many other countries. Related\nstudies in less-developed nations, such as the Indonesian and Mexican Family Life\nSurveys, will also be valuable for this purpose provided that their panels are sustained.\nThird, it will be necessary to consider more than just three generations. For this\npurpose it will almost certainly be necessary to go beyond survey data and to rely\ninstead on ambitious archival and reconstruction efforts that permit a detailed\nexamination of family lineages over many generations. An outstanding example of\nA Multigenerational View of Inequality 17\nthis type of data is archival data on China. Campbell and Lee have assembled\nlineage data based on public registries for northeastern China from the eighteenth to\nthe twentieth century (Lee et al. 2010). The data permit rich connections among kin\nacross multiple generations and can be used to study multigenerational effects on\nboth demographic and socioeconomic outcomes (Campbell and Lee 2008). The data\nare prospective, meaning that lineages can be traced forward as they grow or become\nextinct, making it possible to study socioeconomic and demographic reproductivity\nin tandem.\nFinally, it will be necessary to attend to the identification of \"grandparent\" or\n\"lineage effects,\" when we almost always face the competing hypothesis of\nunmeasured characteristics of parents. One may be tempted to define away\ngrandparent effects by characterizing them as just another set of parental\ncharacteristics. This is satisfactory in practice only if we are truly confident that\nthe scope and characteristics of relevant ancestors are known and simple enough\nthat they can be reduced to a small number of variables and that ancestral effects\nare limited to two generations. More complex and distant ancestry effects may\nnot, in practice, be reducible to parent effects. Even in simple cases, moreover,\none has to measure the relevant ancestral characteristics; relying on parents alone\nis insufficient. The general issue is one of distinguishing \"unmeasured\nheterogeneity\" from \"state dependence\" (e.g., Bartholomew 1982; Heckman\nreasonably tight arguments about the presence or absence of institutional,\nbiological, and demographic support for multigenerational effects, their presence\nor absence can be rigorously adjudicated.\nA second type of study of multigenerational processes focuses on whether\npatterns of intergenerational socioeconomic mobility--whether for income, wealth,\noccupation, or educational attainment--follow the Markovian assumption. Such\nstudies are concerned with describing mobility patterns rather than with determining\nwhether grandparent characteristics are causes of grandchild outcomes. A simple\nversion of this type of study was provided by Hodge (1966) in the study discussed\npreviously. Hodge compared the observed intergenerational mobility rates from\ngrandfathers to grandsons with those that would be implied by the two sets of\nintergenerational rates, from grandfathers to fathers and from fathers to sons. The\nsize and pattern of discrepancies between the observed and implied rates of mobility\nprovide evidence for and against the Markovian assumption.\nSo far as data permit, modified versions of this approach should be replicated and\nextended to a variety of populations. As Hodge himself pointed out, his study ignored\ndifferential fertility levels and timing, which should be incorporated into the mobility\ntables (e.g., Mare 1997). Additionally, investigators should consider the possibility that\nmobility rates are heterogeneous. Although this is an obvious observation when we\nthink of variation among observable groups defined by gender, ethnicity, region, and\nso on, heterogeneous mobility processes may also arise from mixtures of unobserved\nor partially observed processes. For example, some families may follow a Markov\nprocess in that grandparents' and grandchildren's socioeconomic positions are\nconditionally independent given the positions of parents, whereas other families\nmay follow a more complex process in which grandparents' and grandchildren's\npositions are associated even after parents' positions are taken into account. This\nmixture may not map simply into fixed demographic categories, but rather may be\ngoverned by a complex set of cultural, economic, and other forces that are only\npartially observed by the analyst. The task for researchers is both to identify these\nsources of heterogeneity using direct measures of the institutional forces of\nmultigenerational effects (such as those proposed in this essay) and to develop\nstatistical models for representing these mixtures in mobility data.\nFinally, it is necessary to address the difficulty of determining whether\nintergenerational mobility data follow a Markov process or a more complex process.\nIf patterns of intergenerational mobility are constant over time, it is relatively\nstraightforward to discriminate between Markovian and non-Markovian patterns in\nmobility tables for three or more generations. However, if the mobility process is\nchanging, apparent net associations between the characteristics of grandparents and\ngrandchildren may be artifacts of changes in mobility patterns. In the latter case,\ngrandparents' characteristics may appear to be associated with those of their\ngrandchildren when, in fact, there is no net association. Rather, two-generation\nassociations, albeit in a form that changes across the generations, may suffice to describe\nintergenerational mobility patterns. Successful resolution of this identification issue may\nrequire data on more than three generations. It may also require careful substantive\nreasoning about which aspects of intergenerational mobility may be time invariant.\nDescriptive Statistics\nIn addition to the need for more and better data and models, we should also think\nabout describing different phenomena than we usually do. We are all members of\nsurviving multigenerational lines. Yet, as illustrated by archival data such as those of\nCampbell and Lee (Lee et al. 2010), many other lines have not been so fortunate.\nOur descriptions of patterns of social mobility and inequality are almost always\nconfined to survivors. A more rigorous approach to the multigenerational study of\ninequality is to describe the joint processes of reproductivity and socioeconomic\nprosperity and hardship. The success of a lineage is a moving average of the\nsocioeconomic well-being and health of its members, either in total or on a per capita\nbasis. The likelihood that this well-being outlives individuals (and leaves lineages\nwell-off or faring poorly) depends on whether it takes the form of durable physical\nor financial capital or of perishable human capital. As tough as the data requirements\nare, we need something analogous to individual or family permanent income\nmeasures of wealth, income, occupation, and human capital for lineages. The\ndistribution of these measures of success will dictate inequality among lineages.\nBoth the total and the per capita calculations depend on fertility and mortality, and\nthese, of course, depend on socioeconomic conditions. In short, to view inequality in\na multigenerational perspective, not only do we need data and models, but we also\nneed to describe new phenomena.\nConclusion\nWe ignore the effects of ancestors and higher-order social contacts at the peril of\nsound demographic research. It is likely that we have overstated intergenerational\nA Multigenerational View of Inequality 19\nmobility in this country and elsewhere or, at the very least, have misunderstood\nthe pathways through which it occurs. Our models of social mobility have a\nstrong mid-twentieth century American middle- and working-class bias. That is,\nthey emphasize the pivotal role of formal schooling in transmitting the\nadvantages conferred by parents on offspring and inducing new variation in the\nsocioeconomic positions of the next generation that is independent of those of\nthe previous generation (Blau and Duncan 1967). This is understandable given\nthe overwhelming dominance of these types of families in our best nationally\nrepresentative sources of data and the healthy aversion of demographically\ntrained social scientists toward drawing broad conclusions from observations of\nelite or marginal populations. Yet such an orientation limits our ability to see\nother types of intergenerational mobility and immobility patterns that may\ndominate the highest and lowest segments of social hierarchies and to envision\nthat the relative sizes of elite and underclass populations may change over time.\nWe should be open to pluralistic models of mobility that regard populations as\ncontaining mixtures of two-generational and multigenerational modes of\nsocioeconomic persistence.\nA corollary of this conclusion is that the \"correct\" family configurations for\nthe study of social mobility may vary across time and place. In some times and\nplaces, father-to-offspring associations may summarize adequately how families\npass their advantages and disadvantages on to the next generation. In others,\nmothers may be a key part of the process as well. In still others, nonresident kin\nor earlier ancestors may have large effects on new generations of children.\nPopulation heterogeneity in these modes of intergenerational mobility is always a\npossibility. Finally, social mobility is as much about family creation and\ndestruction as it is about associations between the characteristics of key kin in\neach generation. The \"effects\" of family background are almost always\nmechanisms through which some parts of the population grow faster than others,\nand social mobility itself is just one part of the picture. We need to study\nbiological and socioeconomic reproduction in tandem.\nMany of the pioneering researchers in this area came of professional age\nfertility was fluctuating, immigration was modest, most households had two\nparents with a well-defined division of labor, and inequality was stable (and\nmuch lower than today). The social science that emerged at that time was\nremarkably good and deservedly influential, but in some ways it reflected the\nethos and concerns of the middle class at that time. Times have changed, our\nresources have matured, and our capacities to see further into the past, around\nthe globe, and to the extremes of the distributions that we study have grown. In\ndue course, a more multigenerational perspective on inequality will seem a\nnatural way to look at things.\n"
