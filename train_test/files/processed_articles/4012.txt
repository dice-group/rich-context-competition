Theoretically,\npublic investment can affect private investment\neither positively or negatively. An increase in public\ninvestment is expected to increase private investment\nas it allows firms to have a broader access to markets\ndue to construction of roads, ports, railways, and so\non. An increase in public investment is also expected to\nincrease private investment by increasing the marginal\nproductivity of capital (Cavallo & Daude, 2011). At the\nsame time, public investment can also crowd out private\ninvestment because of a decrease in the availability of\nsavings to the private sector and/or increase in the cost\nof finance. As the theoretical relation between public\nand private investment is ambiguous, most studies\nresort to empirical evaluation to reach a conclusion.\nStudies report mixed results about the impact of public\ninvestment on private investment. For example, Blejer\nand Khan (1984) found that the public infrastructure\ninvestment was complementary to private investment\nAschauer (1989) reported that in the United States, an\nincreaseinpubliccapitalcrowdedintheprivatecapitalvia\nan increase in the marginal productivity of capital. Erden\nand Holcombe (2005) also found a positive correlation\nbetween public and private investment for 19 developing\nand Daude (2011) developed a theoretical framework to\nevaluate the conditions under which public investment\npromoted or hindered private investment and found that\npublic investment crowded out private investment in a\nSimilarly, Everhart and Sumlinski (2001) found a nega-\ntive correlation between public and private investment\n(consistent with crowding out hypothesis) in 63 devel-\nMost of the studies on the impact of public investment\non private investment use multi-country cross-sec-\ntional data and, therefore, the results of these studies\nare based on the assumption of \"homogeneity\" in the\nobserved relationship across countries. This could be\nan unrealistic assumption as there are a lot of variations\namong countries due to different structural and insti-\ntutional factors, which, in turn, might be determining\nthe impact of public investment on the behaviour of\nprivate investment in a particular country. Also, not\nmany studies consider the mediating role of economic\nliberalization, market-friendly political platform, and\nnet foreign direct investment in the impact of public\ninvestment on private investment. Few studies incor-\nporate structural break in the model when examining\nthe impact of public investment on private investment.\nWith this background, this study attempts to investigate\nthe impact of public investment on private investment\nDistributed Lag (ARDL) procedure (Pesaran & Shin,\nendogenously determined structural break in the\nmodel. The ARDL procedure corrects for possible\nendogeneity of the explanatory variables and reveals\nthe desirable small sample properties of estimators.\nWe find strong and robust evidence that public invest-\nment crowds out private investment in India. Our base-\nline estimates suggest that a 1 per cent increase in public\ninvestment as a ratio of GDP leads to 0.81 per cent and\n0.53 per cent decrease in private investment as a ratio of\nGDP in the long -run (about 4 to 5 years) and short-run\n(about 2 to 3 years)1, respectively, after controlling for\neconomic conditions. To address the concern that the\nresults might be driven by government consumption\nexpenditure, fiscal deficit, or inadequate infrastructure,\nwe repeat the analysis by estimating our investment\nfunction after including these variables and find similar\nresults. We also estimate the investment regression for\nresult. We find that the estimated effect of public invest-\nment is smaller in magnitude during the post-liberal-\nization period, indicating that economic liberalization\noffsets the crowding out effect of public investment\non private investment. We also find that a \"market\nfriendly\" incumbency and an increase in foreign direct\ninvestment dampen the magnitude of the crowding out\neffect of public investment on private investment.\nPrivate investment is also affected negatively by two\nother channels. The first channel is political uncer-\ntainty hypothesis. Political uncertainty is expected to\naffect private investment negatively because this leads\nto policy uncertainty. As a result, rational firms prefer\ndelaying the investment, until the political uncertainty\nis resolved (Julio & Yook, 2012). The second is the polit-\nical business cycle hypothesis. As per political business\ncycle theory, incumbent politicians manipulate fiscal\nand monetary policy instruments to influence macro-\neconomic performance prior to an election to enhance\ntheir chances of re-election (Nordhaus, 1975). Therefore,\nit is expected that an expansionary fiscal policy would\ncrowd out private investment. We conduct formal tests\nto know whether the crowding out effect is driven\nby these channels and find no evidence that they are\ndriving our results.\nAs can be seen from Figure 1 and Table 1, there is a\nsubstantial variation in the private and public invest-\nment rates. For example, the public investment rate fluc-\nrange and averaged 14.04 per cent in the same period.\nAs there is a considerable variation between both varia-\nidentify the parameters that explain the impact of public\ninvestment on private investment is justified.\nMean\nStandard\nDeviation\nMini-\nmum\nMaxi-\nmum\nSource: Economic Survey 2012\u00ad13, Ministry of Finance, Government\nof India.\nFigure 1 shows the trends in the public and private invest-\nvisible in public investment over time.

An increase in\npublic investment is expected to increase private\ninvestment through creating basic infrastructural facil-\nities such as highways, railways, ports, and so on. A\nErden & Holcombe, 2005) have found that an increase\nin public investment led to an increase in private\ninvestment. On the contrary, crowding out hypothesis\nsuggests that an increase in public investment may lead\nto a decrease in private investment either by increasing\ninterest rate or by utilizing financial and physical\nresources, which would otherwise be available for the\nprivate sector. A number of studies (e.g., Cavallo &\nUdomkerdmongkol, 2012) provide empirical support\nto this assertion from crowding out hypothesis.\nPrivate investment also depends on the lending rate.\nAccording to Keynesians, given the expected rate of\nreturn, a decrease in the lending rate increases invest-\nment, which, in turn, increases, economic growth\nvia multiplier mechanism. Peltonen, Sousa, and\nVansteenkiste (2012) found the real lending rate as\nan important determinant of investment in emerging\nmarket economies.\nInvestment also depends on the availability or supply\nof credit. In contrast to the neo- classical theory, which\nassumes that firms have access to unlimited supply\ncredit, most developing countries are often char-\nacterized by credit constraint. This is due to asym-\nmetric information, directed credit programmes, and\ncontrolled interest rates. These imperfections in credit\nmarkets prevent firms from borrowing as much as they\nwish and discourage investment. The removal of such\ncredit constraints increases the availability of funds for\ninvestment and is therefore expected to increase invest-\nment according to the debt intermediation view (Shaw,\n1973).Anumber of studies report bank credit as a signif-\nicant determinant of investment (Peltonen et al., 2012;\nAnother important determinant of investment is the\nrelative price of an investment. An increase in the price\nof capital goods relative to the price of all other goods\nand services is expected to have a negative impact on\ninvestment as it affects their profit. It is found that an\nincrease in the relative price of investment leads to a\ndecrease in private investment (Peltonen et al., 2012;\nThe deposit rate too has an impact on investment.\nAccording to McKinnon (1973), in a financially\nrepressed economy, it is difficult for economic agents to\nfind required resources from the external source to make\ninvestment on account of non-price credit rationing.\nSecondly, physical capital is often indivisible. Hence,\nit becomes necessary for potential investors (savers) to\naccumulate saving for some time in the form of mone-\ntary assets (mostly currency and deposits) before they\nuse it for lum sump investments. As long as the rate\nof return on deposit is less than the rate of return on\nphysical capital, an increase in deposit rate encourages\naccumulation of deposits (internal funds) by making\ndeposit accumulation more rewarding, which, in turn,\nincreases the investment subsequently according to\nMcKinnon's \"complementarity hypothesis.\" Therefore,\nan increase in deposit rate leads to an increase in invest-\nment. Previous studies (e.g., Athukorala, 1998; Moore,\n2010) report that increase in deposit rate leads to an\nincrease in private investment.\nAnother factor that affects private investment is the\naccelerator mechanism. As per the accelerator theory\nof business cycle, an increase in output and sales\nputs pressure on existing productive capacity. Hence,\nfirms decide to expand their productive capacity\nand hence investment. A few previous studies (e.g.,\nreported that the growth rate of GDP has a positive\neffect on private investment.\nOn the basis of the above discussions, we specify the\nempirical private investment function as follows:\n  =  ( , Lending\nRate, Bank Credit, Relative Price of Investment, Deposit\nRate, and the Growth Rate)\nThe independent variables with their expected signs in\nbrackets are given below:\n  (?)\nLending Rate (-)\nBank Credit (+)\nRelative Price of Investment (-)\nDeposit Rate (+)\nGrowth Rate (+)\nData and Econometric Procedure\nsources of all variables, is summarized in Appendix 1.\nTheassumptionsoftheclassicallinearregressionmodel\nrequire that both the dependent and independent\nvariables are stationary. In the presence of non-sta-\ntionary variables, there might be what Granger and\nNewbold (1974) called a spurious regression. A\nspurious regression has a high R2, significant t-sta-\ntistics, but the results are without any economic\nmeaning. Therefore, the first econometric step we have\ntaken is to test if the series are non-stationary by using\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests. The Akaike\nInformation Criterion (AIC) determines the appro-\npriate number of first differences of the dependent\nvariable for the ADF test. The null hypothesis of the\ntest is that the un-differenced form of the series is\nnon-stationary or contains a unit root.\nTable 2 presents the ADF unit root test results for all\nvariables. All variables do not have the same order of\nintegration. Variables such as private investment, public\ninvestment, bank credit, the relative price of invest-\nment are non-stationary, whereas real lending rate,\nreal deposit rate, and growth rate are stationary. But all\nnon-stationary variables are found to be stationary in\ntheir first difference I(1) (See Table 2).\nHowever, a well-known weakness of the ADF test is\nthat it may fail to reject the unit root hypothesis if the\nseries has a structural break. Perron (1989) showed that\nthe absence of an existing structural break leads to a\nbias that reduces the ability of the ADF test to reject\na false unit root null hypothesis. Figure 1 exhibits a\nstrong possibility of structural breaks in both public\nand private investment, particularly during the post-re-\nform period. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct the\nunit root test that allows for the structural break. Zivot\nand Andrews (1992) unit root test allows one structural\nbreak in the series which is determined endogenously.\nTable 2: ADF Test for Unit Root\nVariables\nt-statistics for Level\nwithout Time Trenda\nt-statistics for Level\nwith Time Trendb\nt-statistics for First\nDifferences without\nTime Trenda Decision\nAdditional Control Variables\nCentral Govt.

There are two\nadvantages of applying the unit root test that allows\nfor the presence of structural break. First, it prevents\nobtaining a test result that may be biased towards\nnon-rejection of the null hypothesis. Secondly, as it\nidentifies the date of the structural break, it becomes\neasier to analyse whether a structural break of a series\nis associated with a particular event such as a change in\ngovernment policy, a currency crisis and so on.\nThe results of Zivot\u00adAndrews unit root test are\npresented in Table 3. They suggest that private invest-\nment, public investment, bank credit, the relative price\nof investment have unit root with structural breaks,\nwhereas real deposit rate is stationary with a structural\nbreak. The results confirm the ADF test results except\nfor the lending rate. However, all non-stationary varia-\nbles are found to be stationary in their first differences,\nthat is, they are I(I) (See Table 3).\nAs expected, a structural break in private investment is\ndue to various structural reforms that were carried out\nduring the first half of the 1990s. The reforms included\ndecontrolling of private investment, opening up the\neconomy to foreign trade and foreign investment,\nfinancial sector reforms, etc. According to Parker (1995),\n\"the behaviour of investment in the post reform period\ncan be divided into three distinct phases: the crisis of\nment remained sluggish despite an easing of financial\nconditions and an improved economic outlook; and the\nof a robust and broad based investment recovery\" (p.\n28). Therefore, we conclude that private investment has\nAs most of the variables are found to be non-sta-\ntionary, the next step is to test the possibility of one\nor more cointegrating relationships among variables.\nThere are several approaches to carry out the cointe-\ngration test. The most commonly used methods are\ntwo-step residual-based procedure (Engle & Granger,\n1987) and the system-based reduced rank regression\napproach (Johansen, 1991). These testing procedures\nrequire that all variables to be integrated are of order\n1. Since this is not valid for our variables, we use an\nTable 3: Zivot\u00adAndrews Unit Root Tests with One Structural Break\nVariables\nZivot\u00adAndrews Test\nStatistic for Levela TB\nZivot\u00adAndrews Test Sta-\ntistic for First Differencesa TB Decision\nAdditional Control Variables\nCentral Govt.

(2001). The main advantage of the ARDL procedure\nis that it tests the existence of cointegrating relationship\nwhen variables are of a different order of integration\nthrough the bound testing approach.\nThe ARDL framework for a four variable model\ncan be expressed as follows:\nDY\nt\n=a+ b\ni\ni\np\n=\n\nDY\nt-i\n+ g\ni\ni\np\n=\n\nDX\nt-i\n+ m\ni\ni\np\n=\n\nDZ\nt-i\n+\nY\n+\nX\n+ \nZ\n+ \nDUM\n+u\nwhere, a is a constant, Y\nt\nis the endogenous variable,\nX\nt\nand Z\nt\nare explanatory variables, DUM is the break\npoint dummy variable, p is the maximum number of\nlag to be used, \ni\n, g\ni\n, \u00b5\ni\n, \n, \n, \n, and \nare parameters.\nThe variables with differences represent short-term\nrelationships whereas the variables with one period lag\nrepresent long-term relationships. The ARDL method\nestimates (p+1)k regressions to find out optimum lag (of\ndifferences) for each variable, where p is the maximum\nnumber of lags and k is the number of regressors in\nthe equation. The optimal model can be determined\nusing the model selection criteria such as the AIC and\nSchwarz-Bayesian Criterion (SBC). The null hypothesis\nof the cointegration test is that all estimated coefficients\nof lagged level variables are equal to zero, that is, there is\nno long-run relationship. In case of the above four-var-\niable model, the null hypothesis is l\n=l\n=l\n=l\n=0. If the\ncalculated F-statistic exceeds the upper bound of the\ncritical value reported in Pesaran and Pesaran (1997),\nthe null hypothesis of no long-run relationship can be\nrejected irrespective of the order of integration. On the\nother hand, if the test statistic is less than the lower\nbound of the critical value, the null hypothesis cannot\nbe rejected. However, if the test statistic falls between\nthe upper and lower critical values, no clear conclu-\nsion can be drawn. The diagnostic (serial correlation,\nnormality, functional form, heteroscedasticity) and\nstability (the cumulative sum of recursive residuals, the\ncumulative sum of squares of recursive residuals) tests\nare conducted to ascertain the appropriateness of the\nARDL model.\nThe next step is to test whether there is a long-run rela-\ntionship between the variables. Table 4 presents coin-\ntegration test results for our baseline specification.\nColumn 4.1 of Table 4 reports the cointegration result\nbetween private investment, public investment, bank\ncredit, the relative price of investment, and DUM.\ndeposit rate and growth rate, respectively, and report\nthe respective cointegration test results. Across all\nspecifications, the calculated F-statistics exceed the\nupper bound critical values implying that there exists a\nlong-run relationship between private investment and\nthe explanatory variables in all specifications.\nFigure 2: Structural Break in   in India\nSource: Author's analysis.\nTable 4: Bound Test for Cointegration Analysis\nSource: Author's analysis.\nNotes: The critical values are obtained from Pesaran and Pesaran\nnumber of regressors.\n***, **, and * denote rejection of the null hypothesis at 1 %, 5%, and\n10% level of significance, respectively. Column items are explained\nin the text.\nThe next step is to estimate the long-run estimates for\nprivate investment function. The lags in the models are\nselected on the basis of SBC. The long-run and short-run\nestimation results are reported in Tables 5 and 6, respec-\ntively. Table 5 represents our baseline specification for\nthe rest of the analysis. It is observed that across all\nspecifications in Table 5, private investment is posi-\ntively and significantly related to bank credit, the rela-\ntive price of investment, and real deposit rate, whereas\nit is negatively and significantly related to public invest-\nment and real lending rate. The magnitude of the coef-\nficients varies depending on the specifications. The esti-\nmates as reported in column 5.3 of Table 5 show that an\nincrease in public investment as a ratio of GDP by 1 per\ncent leads to a decrease in private investment as a ratio\nof GDP by 0.81 per cent after controlling for economic\nconditions. It also affects private investment in the short\nrun. For instance, an increase in public investment by 1\nper cent leads to a decrease in private investment by\n0.53 per cent in the short run (see column 6.3 of Table\n6). This implies crowding out of private investment in\nresponse to an increase in public investment.\nTable 5: Baseline Investment Regression (ARDL Model Long-run Results)\nARDL\nARDL\nARDL\nARDL\nConstant\n \n\nBank Credit\n\nRelative Price of Investment\nReal Lending Rate -\nReal Deposit Rate - -\n-\nGrowth Rate - - -\nDum\n\nDiagnostic Statistics\nF Statistic=\nSerial Correlation 2 (1)=\nFunctional Form 2 (1)=\nTable 5 continued\nHeteroscedasticity 2(1)=\nSource: Author's analysis.\nNotes: 1. ****, ***, and **, denote the level of significance at 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively, for two-tailed test.\n 2.

This suggests that there was\nvarious reform measures undertaken with regard to\ntrade and foreign direct investment. For example, total\nThese reform measures had a positive shock on private\ninvestment in India.\nThe coefficients of error correction term (ECM\n) are\nfound to be large in magnitude and are statistically\nsignificant (Table 6). For instance, the coefficient of\nECM\nfications. This implies that around 49 to 65 per cent of\nthe disequilibrium (deviation of private investment\nfrom their respective equilibrium level) of the previous\nyear's shock gets corrected this year. This suggests\nthat the disequilibrium in private investment func-\ntion occurring due to various shocks gets adjusted\ncompletely between 2.5 and 3 years.\nFurthermore, it is required that diagnostic statistics\nprovide support for our chosen specifications. Table 5\nreports the diagnostic test statistics of ARDL models.\nThe high values of R2 for all the specifications show that\nthe goodness of fit is satisfactory. The F- statistics which\nmeasures the joint significance of all regressors in the\nspecifications are also significant at 0.01 level of signifi-\ncance. The Durbin-Watson statistics are also close to 2.\nThe diagnostic test statistics also show that all the spec-\nifications pass the tests for serial correlation, functional\nform, normality, and heteroscedasticity.\nWe also test whether our baseline specification in column\n5.3 of Table 5 is driven by reverse causality and is biasing\nour results.

Hence, the right\nhand side variables in column 5.3 of Table 5 can be treated\nas long-run forcing variables for the explanation of private\ninvestment and reverse causation is absent.\nThe plot of the cumulative sum (CUSUM) and the cumu-\nlative sum of squares (CUSUMSQ) of recursive residuals\nfrom our baseline specification against the critical bound\nof the 5 per cent level of significance show that the spec-\nification is stable over time (see Appendix 2).\nAdditional Control Variables and Alternative\nSample Period\nWe perform several checks on the robustness of our\nresults. We start by examining whether the crowding out\neffect is driven by the central government balance as a\nshare of GDP. Fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP could\nbe an important variable and could affect the private\ninvestment. This is because an increase in fiscal deficit\nmay lead to a decrease in private investment on account\nof an increase in interest rate or a decrease in availability\nof loanable funds. Column 7.1 of Table 7 shows that the\ncoefficient of fiscal deficit has the correct (negative) sign\nbut it is insignificant. Hence, the crowding out of private\ninvestment is not driven by fiscal deficit.\nNext, we examine whether the crowding out effect is\ndriven by government final consumption expenditure.\nThe inclusion of this variable allows us to disentangle\nwhether public fixed investment or other types of expend-\niture crowds out private investment. Column 7.2 of Table\n7 reports that the government consumption expendi-\nture enters the regression with a positive sign but it is\ninsignificant. Moreover, our main finding is robust to the\ninclusion of government consumption expenditure.\nWe also test whether the impact of public investment\ndepends on inadequate public infrastructure (or inade-\nquate stock of public capital). Inadequate public infra-\nstructure hinders private investment, but at the same\ntime leads to an increase in public investment. If this is\nso, then there is a possibility that the crowding out effect\nmight be driven by insufficient public infrastructure.\nIn order to test this, we included kilometres of roads\nper capita in our baseline specification but no cointe-\ngration relationship was found between the variables.\nAfter excluding lending rate and DUM from the spec-\nification as they were insignificant, we found a cointe-\ngrating relationship between the remaining explana-\ntory variables and private investment. The coefficient\nof the roads per capita has positive signs in both long-\nand short-run equations (see columns 7.3 and 8.3 of\nTables 7 and 8, respectively), but it is significant only\nin the short run. This suggests that public investment\nis complementary to private investment in India, but\nthere are distortions in the process of creation of stock\nof public capital. This is similar to the findings reported\nby a few previous studies (Blejer & Khan, 1984; Cavallo\nwhile public infrastructure investment was comple-\nmentary to private investment, other types of public\ninvestment caused crowding out of private investment.\nThe investment function reported in column 5.3 of\nTable 5 was re-estimated for a shorter sample period\nTables 7 and 8, respectively.

Column\nitems are explained in the text.\nInteraction with Structural Characteristics\nHaving shown that public investment systematically\ncrowds out private investment, we now deepen our\nanalysis by incorporating various structural charac-\nteristics into the investment function. The impact of\npublic investment on private investment may vary for\ndifferent political regimes, different level of economic\nreforms, and different level of foreign direct investment\nbecause of the possibility of an interaction between\npublic investment and these characteristics.\nWe first examine the differential effect of public invest-\nment on private investment by economic liberalization.\nAfter the adoption of New Industrial Policy of 1991, the\nGovernment of India removed the industrial licensing\nrequirement for various industrial sectors, reduced\nthe number of activities for public sector, and opened\nup a large number of activities for foreign investors.\nA number of financial sector reforms like deregulation\nof interest rates, reduction of cash reserve ratio and\nstatutory liquidity ratio, and the introduction of various\nfinancial instruments were also carried out. Such a\ndramatic shift in policies is expected to have relaxed\nfinancing constraints and might have dampened the\ncrowding out effect of public investment. To examine\nthe impact of liberalization on crowding out effect, we\ninclude both reform dummy variable and its interac-\ntion with the public investment. Reform dummy takes\notherwise. The interaction term captures the differ-\nential effect of economic reform on the magnitude of\ncoefficient of public investment. Column 10.1 of Table\n10 shows that coefficient of the interaction term is posi-\ntive and significant. This suggests that the crowding\nout effect of public investment on private investment\nwas dampened during the post-reform period.\nWe now examine whether the political platform of the\nincumbent government affects the crowding out effect\nof public investment on private investment. If the\nincumbent government is market-friendly, it may lessen\nthe crowding out effect. In order to test this hypothesis,\nwe adopt the political platform classification by the\nWorld Bank Database of Political Institutions (Beck,\nClarke, Groff, Keefer, & Walsh, 2001). If the incumbent\ngovernment is classified as market-friendly, the dummy\nof Table 10 shows that the coefficient of the interaction\nterm between public investment and market-friendly\ndummy is large, positive, and significant. It is found\nthat a 1 per cent increase in public investment as ratio\nof GDP leads to 2.50 per cent increase in private invest-\nment as a ratio of GDP when the incumbent govern-\nment is market-friendly. This implies that the public\ninvestment crowds in private investment, if the govern-\nment is market-friendly.\nTable 10: Interaction with Liberalization, Political Platform, and Foreign Direct Investment (ARDL Model\nLong-run Results)\nARDL\nARDL\nARDL\nConstant\n \nReform\n\u00ad \u00ad\nReform*  \n\u00ad \u00ad\nMarket friendly \u00ad\n\u00ad\nMarket friendly* Pub Investment \u00ad\n\u00ad\nFDI \u00ad \u00ad\nFDI*  \u00ad \u00ad\nDum\nDiagnostic Statistics\nObservations=\nF Statistic=\nSerial Correlation 2(1)=\nFunctional Form 2(1)=\nHeteroscedasticity 2(1)=\nSource: Author's analysis.\nNote: Same as in Table 5.

Column 10.3\nof Table 10 shows that the coefficient of the interac-\ntion term between public investment and net inflows\nof foreign direct investment is positive and signifi-\ncant. This implies that an increase in net inflows of\nforeign direct investment dampens the crowding\nout effect of public investment.

K is the number of regressors. Column\nitems are explained in the text.\nAlternative Possible Explanations\nIn this section, we examine whether other potential\nchannels may contribute to the crowding out results.\nFirst, political uncertainty (i.e. situation in which inves-\ntors are unsure about which party will win election\nand form the government) may affect private invest-\nment negatively. This is because political uncertainty\nleads to policy uncertainty as each political party has its\nown policy preference regarding industry regulation,\ntaxation, and so on. As a result, rational firms prefer\ndelaying investment until the political uncertainty\nis resolved. Hence, political uncertainty may reduce\nprivate investment. Julio and Yook (2012) examined\nthe impact of fluctuations in political uncertainty in\n2005 in the context of national elections and found that\npolitical uncertainty leads to a reduction on investment\nexpenditure by an average of 4.8 per cent in the election\nyears relative to the non-election years. This suggests\nthat uncertainty associated with changes in national\nleadership causes firms to reduce investment rate.\nJulio and Yook (2012) used the timing of election\nas a measure of political uncertainty. It is based on\nthe assumption that political uncertainty is usually\nhigher during election time as compared to other time\nperiods. Empirical evidence suggests that uncertainty\nrelated to political changes is reflected in asset prices.\nFor instance, it is found that stock market volatility\nis significantly higher during an election period than\nduring non-election periods (Bialkowski, Gottschalk,\n& Wisniewski 2008; Boutchkova, Doshi, Durnev, &\nMolchanov, 2011). Similarly, Bernhard and Leblang\n(2006) found several changes in exchange rates,\nbond yields, and equity prices during elections. This\nevidence supports that political uncertainty is more\nthan normal during election years.\nWe also investigate whether the crowding out effects are\ndriven by the political uncertainty. In order to capture\nand to isolate the impact of political uncertainty, we use\nelection dummy variable. Election dummy takes the\nvalue of 1 both in pre-election year and election year\nand 0 otherwise. It is expected that election dummy\nwould have a negative sign. Column 13.1 of Table 13\nreports that the coefficient of election dummy has posi-\ntive sign but it is insignificant. This suggests that the\ncrowding out effect of public investment is not driven\nby the political uncertainty hypothesis.\nTable 13: Political Uncertainty and Political Business Cycle Hypotheses (ARDL Model Long-run Results)\nARDL\nARDL\nARDL\nARDL\nConstant\n \n\nElection Dummy\n\n- - -\nGrowth of Govt.

Bank credit,  Relative price of investment, and  Real lending rate are included as control variables. Column\nitems are explained in the text.\nAnother factor, which may contribute to crowding\nout effect of public investment on private invest-\nment, is the political business cycle. As per the polit-\nical business cycle theory, politicians successfully\nmanipulate fiscal and monetary policy instruments\nto influence macroeconomic performance prior to\nan election to enhance their chances of re-election\n(Nordhaus, 1975). The basic idea behind the theory\nis that voters make their decisions on the basis of the\nstate of the economy at the time of election. Therefore,\npoliticians use expansionary monetary and fiscal\npolicies to exploit the short-run trade-off between\ninflation and growth. An expansionary monetary\npolicy is expected to increase private investment and\nan expansionary fiscal policy is expected to crowd\nout private investment.\nWe test if political business cycle contributes to this\ncrowding out of private investment. We adopt the\napproach of Julio and Yook (2012) to test the political\nbusiness cycle theory and estimate the following speci-\nY\nt\n= a + b\nY\n+ b\nY\n+ b\nGR\nt\n+ b\nELECTION\nt\n+ u\nwhere, Y\nt\nis the macroeconomic policy variable, GR is\nthe growth rate of real GDPin the year t, and ELECTION\nis a dummy variable that takes the value equal to 1 in\nthe election year and pre-election year. Following Julio\nand Yook (2012), we examine four different macro-eco-\nnomic variables such as the growth rate of government\nexpenditure, growth rate in money supply (M3), real\nlending rate, and inflation rate.\nTable 15 represents the results of political business cycle\nregressions. Pre-electoral manipulation does not have\na significant impact on the growth rate of government\nexpenditure, growth in money supply, interest rate or\ninflation rate in the pre-election period. Besides this, as\nan alternative test, we also include growth in govern-\nment spending, growth in money supply, inflation rate in\nour private investment function. The long-run results are\nreal lending rate has already been included in all equa-\ntions. But the coefficient of public investment is still nega-\ntive and is of similar magnitude after including these vari-\nables. This implies that the opportunistic behaviour of\npoliticians is not driving our crowding out results.\nTable 15: Political Business Cycle Regressions\nGrowth in Govern-\nment Expenditure\nGrowth in Broad\nMoney Supply Rate of Inflation\nReal Lending\nRate\nConstant\nY\nY\nGrowth Rate of Real GDP\nElection Dummy\nDiagnostic Statistics\nF Statistic=\nSource: Author's analysis.\nNote: Same as in Table 5.\nTable 16 reports the cointegration results for each of the\nmodel specifications considered in Tables 13 and 14.\nTable 16: Bound Test for Cointegration Analysis\nComputed\nF-Statistic\nSource: Author's analysis.\nNotes: Same as in Table 4.

The results\nof this study reveal that public investment crowds out\nprivate investment. Our base line results imply that a\n1 per cent increase in public investment as a ratio of\nprivate investment as a ratio of GDP in the long run and\nshort run, respectively, after controlling for economic\nconditions. Moreover, a \"market friendly\" incumbency\nis found to dampen the magnitude of the crowding out\neffect of public investment. The results also reveal that\nan increase in the ratio of foreign direct investment to\nGDP offsets the magnitude of the crowding out effect of\npublic investment on private investment.\nFurther, public infrastructure (represented by the\nkilometres of roads per capita) is found to have a\npositive effect on private investment in the short\nrun. However, this complementarity may disappear\nif public investment projects are not of good quality\nand/or financing of these public projects have an\nadverse effect on the availability of bank credit or\nlending rate. Also, not all types of public investment\nhave the same positive effect. Public investment\nshould in fact be focused more on goods and services\nwhich are non-rival and non-excludable in nature\nwith significant positive externalities.\nIt is important to note that we included a single endog-\nenously determined structural break in our model,\nexcluding the possibility of multiple breaks. There is a\nscope to increase multiple structural breaks in the anal-\nysis and re-investigate the impact of public investment\non private investment in India in future studies.\nVariables Source Description\n  ES Private gross fixed capital formation to GDP ratio\n  ES Public gross fixed capital formation to GDP ratio\nReal Lending Rate\nHSIE Real lending rate is calculated as r=ln[(1+i)/(1+inf), where i is the SBI nominal advance\nrate and inf is the current rate of inflation measured by GDP deflator.\nBank Credit HSIE Total bank credit to GDP ratio\nRelative Price of Investment\nHSIE Investment deflator to GDP deflator ratio, in which investment deflator is ratio of\nnominal gross fixed capital formation to real gross fixed capital formation.\nReal Deposit Rate\nHSIE Real interest rate is calculated as r=ln[(1+i)/(1+inf), where i is the 1 to 3 years nominal\nbank deposit rate and inf is the current rate of inflation measured by GDP deflator.\nGrowth Rate HSIE Growth rate of real GDP\nFiscal Deficit HSIE Fiscal deficit to GDP ratio\nAppendix 1 continued\nCentral Govt.
