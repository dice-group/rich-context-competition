    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recent progress in developing social indi-\ncators is described in terms of six activities. In regard to\nsocial bookkeeping, we are expanding the number of\ndomains covered by population surveys, and survey data\nare being more widely disseminated. In social accounting,\ndemographic stock-flow schemes show promise of inte-\ngrating systems of social statistics. Social science theories\nhave provided models of achievement and other social\nprocesses. Social forecasting is potentially an important\ncomponent of work on social indicators, but a new defini-\ntion of the purpose of forecasting is needed. The practice\nof social reporting is best exemplified in the work of recent\ncommissions. Social advising, while it draws upon social\nindicators, involves functions that cannot be performed\nby any system of indicators alone. The most worthy\naspiration of the social indicators movement would be\nto contribute to the enlightenment of a changing society.\nThe current vogue of the term \"social indicators\" dates from\nthe publication of a book with that title by Raymond Bauer\nand associates in 1966 (1). Institutionalization of the label\nhas been carried forward by its incorporation into the titles of\nother, likewise influential books, by the general recognition of\nan international \"social indicators movement\" evidenced by\nsuch symptoms as conferences, symposia, foreign travel, and a\nnew journal, Social Indicators Research; by the establish-\nment in 1972 (under the auspices of the Social Science Re-\nsearch Council and with the support of the National Science\nFoundation) of a Center for the Coordination of Research on\nSocial Indicators; and, quite recently, by the appearance of an\nofficial Federal statistical publication, Social Indicators, 1973\nAmong the many antecedents of the contemporary social\nindicators movement, I mention only one: the monumental\nRecent Social Trends, released by President Hoover's Re-\nsearch Committee on Social Trends in 1933 (3). It was pre-\npared by a large group of collaborators under the research\ndirection of William F. Ogburn and set a standard for social\nreporting that has yet to be matched by subsequent efforts.\nThis paper is a review of current and recent developments\nthat may, one hopes, eventuate a few years hence in work\nthat does surpass the achievement of Ogburn and his co-\nworkers.\nOne salient feature of the social indicators movement,\nwhich is really implicit in its characterization as a social\nAbbreviations: CPS, Current Population Survey; ISR, Institute\nfor Social Research; NORC, National Opinion Research Center;\nOECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-\nmerit; SSRC, Social Science Research Council.\n* This paper was presented at the Annual Meeting of the National\nIt was presented in the session composed of Invited Papers Mainly\non the Social Sciences.\nmovement, is that it is many things to many people. Not a\nfew social scientists and practitioners have simply seized\nupon a popular label to justify or sanctify what they were al-\nready doing. Others have proposed innovations or departures\nfrom present practice in regard to diverse matters, ranging\nfrom the ways in which we collect data to our means of pro-\nviding advice to lawgivers and political executives. I find it\nuseful to describe the scope of work on social indicators in\nterms of how it relates to six distinguishable activities.\n1. Social Bookkeeping. The creation of social statistics by\ngathering information systematically and recording it; the\n\"bird watching,\" \"weather reporting,\" or analogous function\nwhich supplies the raw material for social indicators.\n2. Social Accounting. The invention and application of\nformal schemes of classification, aggregation, statistical de-\ncomposition, component analysis, and the like, which serve as\nstandard frameworks for the interpretation of data and pro-\nvide means of converting raw data into measures, indices, or\n\"readings\" of social conditions and trends. An example is the\nlife table, an actuarial accounting scheme that renders inter-\npretable the basic data on numbers of people and numbers of\ndeaths generated by the bookkeeping activities of census and\nvital statistics.\n3. Social Science. The explanatory function, or develop-\nment of theories which find expression in models to elucidate\nthe movements of indicators and relationships among in-\ndicators.\n4. Social Forecasting. The preparation of systematic antic-\nipations of the future, carrying forward values of social in-\ndicator magnitudes so as to be ready for what may happen, or\nto forestall what might happen if evasive or preventive action\nwere not taken, or to realize the benefits of favorable de-\nvelopments that are seen to be possible if appropriate actions\nare taken.\n5. Social Reporting. The preparation of formal though not\nnecessarily official documents communicating. the results of\nstudying social indicators. Social reports might be periodic, as\nis the Economic Report of the President, but thus far no\nperiodicity or even continuity of auspices for social reporting\nhas been established. There are, however, many special-pur-\npose and single-time social reports, such as the \"Coleman\nReport\" on educational opportunity (4) and the \"Moynihan\nReport\" on the Negro family (5). And we do have the ex-\nample of the prototypic Toward a Social Report (6), prepared\nby staff of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare\nwith the aid of an advisory board of social scientists.\n6. Social Advising. The use of social indicators in attacking\nproblems of public policy. In the minds of many, including\nSenator Walter F. Mondale-whose proposed legislation pro-\nSymposium: Developing Social Indicators 5097\nvided for both social reporting and a Council of Social Advi-\nsors, taking as a model the Council of Economic Advisors-\nthe natural vehicle for the development and use of social in-\ndicators is an official body created by statute and serving at\na high level in the Executive Branch of the Federal govern-\nment. Pending such a development, should it occur, we must\nrecognize that much de facto social advising goes on already,\nalthough in ways that are not well understood, with con-\nsequences that are not easy to assess, and quite possibly with\nlittle or no specific reference to social indicators as such.\nThe foregoing enumeration may serve in lieu of an explicit\ndefinition of \"social indicators.\" Clearly, we are talking about\nquantitative descriptions of social conditions and trends\nwhich are intended to inform public opinion and improve the\nconduct of public affairs. Some writers emphasize the \"social\"\nin social indicators, in the sense of \"non-economic\" or \"trans-\neconomic\"; their concern is to stress the need for kinds of in-\nformation not included in the national income and product\naccounts or in statistical series describing economic activity,\nprices, production, and the like. Interestingly, stress on the\n\"non-economic\" seems quite compatible with using the his-\ntory of economic indicators to suggest a strategy for social in-\ndicators development. Some also mention the need for direct\nmeasures of human welfare as distinct from statistics that\nmerely describe the operations of agencies and organizations\nthat provide services or the amounts of economic resources\nthey use. Either of these emphases may be conjoined with the\ndeclaration that social indicators are required by a society\nthat proposes to take seriously the \"quality of life,\" as dis-\ntinct from the mere augmentation of output implied by the\nconcept of \"growth.\" The conviction that something im-\nportant is missing from our conventional compendia of sta-\ntistics-the statistical abstracts and yearbooks-is voiced by\npractically all exponents of social indicators.\nSocial bookkeeping\nThe social indicators movement will have made a contribu-\ntion even if it accomplishes no more than an acceleration in\nthe rate of development of the social bookkeeping function. A\nconvenient baseline for measuring recent progress is the 1962\nreport of the Behavioral Sciences Subpanel of the President's\nScience Advisory Committee, Strengthening the Behavioral\nSciences (7). After noting that systematic collection of basic\nbehavioral data for the United States would assist both fun-\ndamental research and the application of scientific knowledge,\nthe panel suggested that:\nThe Social Science Research Council be invited to appoint\na standing committee to review and study present practices,\nneeds, and opportunities for gathering information about\nnoneconomic aspects of behavior in American society.\nThe Social Service Research Council (SSRC) Center for the\nCoordination of Research on Social Indicators, established 10\nyears later, has actually devoted much of its effort to stimu-\nlating improvements in \"gathering information.\" One of its\ninitiatives, long overdue, is an attempt to persuade the major\nsurvey and polling organizations to standardize their methods\nof ascertaining the usual social background information col-\nlected in surveys. Conferences of the parties concerned have\nproved productive to the extent that agreement was reached\non a plan to prepare and distribute a manual of recommended\nA second initiative of the Center is an experimental pro-\ngram to facilitate the development of social indicators from\nsurvey data archives. The Roper Public Opinion Research\nCenter has been commissioned to search its files for survey\nquestions that have been asked repeatedly. Once there is an\nindex of such questions, resources will be provided to selected\ninvestigators so that they can retrieve the basic data and\ncarry out time series analyses.\nThese projects of the SSRC Center are convergent with\nand supportive of several other steps taken in the last few\nyears to improve the supply of basic data.\n(1) Dissemination, of census data in the unit-record form\nbegan a decade or so ago. The breakthrough came with the\ndecision to issue a \"one-in-a-thousand\" sample data tape\nfrom the 1960 Census of Population. Somewhat later, the\nBureau of the Census adopted a policy of duplicating data\ntapes from the Current Population Survey for the use of\nother agencies and private research workers. In such cases,\nindividual identifying information is removed, so as to pro-\ntect confidentiality, and the costs of preparing the data for re-\nlease in this form are borne by the project acquiring them.\nThe importance of this innovation can hardly be overesti-\nmated. We have known for a long time that certain essential\nsocial indicators are available in principle from the Federal\nstatistical system. Yet all too often efforts to put information\ninto an appropriate form are frustrated by the inadequacy of\nthe published summary tables for the purpose at hand. With\naccess to the unit records, the social scientist may specify in\ndetail how variables are to be manipulated so as to produce an\noptimal estimate of the magnitude desired. To give one ex-\nample, because they had access to the data tape of a 1962\nsupplement to the Current Population Survey, Hauser and\nFeatherman (8) were able to produce estimates of the trend in\noccupational mobility to 1970 that are more detailed, precise,\nand reliable than any estimate that could have been assembled\nfrom published sources.\nFortunately, several other Federal agencies are following\nthe lead of the Bureau of the Census. The social indicators\nmovement suddenly faces the problem of how to live sensibly\nin a data-rich environment.\n(2) There is growing appreciation of the fact that to create a\n\"system of social indicators\"-whatever that might turn out\nto be-will require many years of preparatory work. In the\nmeantime, the desirability of a continuous monitoring of\nsocial change and the need for social reporting oblige us to\nmake the best use of existing social measurements. The po-\ntential utility of data archives for trend studies, alluded to\nabove, is greatly amplified by a strategy of replicating base-\nline measurements. Following the publication of a detailed\nadvocacy of this strategy (9), two major projects have dem-\nonstrated the feasibility of this strategy and some of its bene-\nfits. (i) A 1971 omnibus replication of parts of some eight\nsurveys done by the Detroit Area Study in the 1950's and\n1960's provides indications of social change in selected as-\npects of marriage, sex roles, childrearing, social participation,\nreligious behavior and beliefs, values, political orientations,\nand racial attitudes (10). Practically all of the 100 or more\nspecific items pertain to variables for which readings of\nchange hitherto were lacking. The argument is, therefore,\nthat many new and significant indicators can be developed\nand quickly put to work, merely by taking advantage of our\nquestion wordings and coding conventions.\nstock of present measurements and regarding them as base-\nlines for measures of change. (ii) A second project taking the\nargument seriously is the annual General Social Survey begun\nby the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) in 1972.\nMost of the questions in this survey are drawn from past\nsurveys, so that only the retrieval of the old data from ex-\nisting archives is needed to turn a cross-sectional study-as of\nfrom the NORC General Survey are made available to the\nresearch community at once, and at nominal cost. It is hoped\nthat wide dissemination will lead to a variety of uses and in-\nsights. There is also an associated project under way to gen-\nerate systematically the measures of change rendered possible\nby the survey.\n(3) The developments described thus far share the feature\nof taking advantage of existing mechanisms and the stock of\ninformation they have produced. But no one doubts the need\nfor new kinds of social data. To get some sense of the pace of\ndevelopment it is instructive to study Social Indicators, 1973,\nnoting examples of statistics forthcoming from more or less\nunconventional sources. I here classify as \"conventional\"\nsuch major sources of Federal statistics as the decennial\ncensuses, vital statistics system, Current Population Survey,\nNational Health Interview Survey--although it, too, was a\nnovelty not so many years ago-health and education sta-\ntistics compiled from administrative records, Uniform Crime\nReports, and employer records aggregated by the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics. \"Unconventional\" sources include both\nnon-Federal research organizations and Federal projects in\nnew domains. The examples include:\nthe Gallup Poll, for measures of confidence in ability to ob-\ntain health care and fear of crime,\nvictimization surveys, begun by NORC and continued in\nthe National Crime Survey, sponsored by the Law En-\nforcement Assistance Administration,\nthe National Assessment of Educational Progress, an\nelaborate series of measurements of educational achieve-\nment,\nthe Educational Testing Service \"Growth Study,\" pro-\nviding estimates of opportunity for college education by\nscholastic ability and family socioeconomic status,\nsurveys of job satisfaction and subjective quality of life by\nthe Institute for Social Research (ISR),\nsurvey of financial characteristics of consumers, including\nwealth distributions, sponsored by the U.S. Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System,\ntime budget survey of the ISR, the U.S. portion of an\ninternational comparative study,\nsurveys of expected future births in the Current Population\nSurvey (CPS), a continuation of series developed in stud-\nsurvey of outdoor recreation, CPS supplement sponsored\nby the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation,\nA. C. Nielsen Co. surveys of the use of television.\nSocial Indicators, 1973 did not include, though it might well\nhave done so, such series as:\nISR American Election Studies, for measures of political\nCPS series of voter participation studies, biennial from 1964\nISR Index of Consumer Sentiment, several times a year\nas of optimism in regard to strictly economic prospects),\nHarris survey measurements of public confidence in various\ninstitutions,\nNORC series of surveys on white attitudes toward Negroes.\nNow that the ice has been broken by the recognition in a\nFederal statistical publication of such exotic sources as Gallup\nand A. C. Nielsen, we should press for considerable expansion\nof the social indicators publication, consistent with its mission,\ninto subjects not covered in the first edition. This will raise-\nconstructively, one would hope-issues of statistical standards\nand standardization in non-Federal statistics, a topic discussed\n(4) Because the potential power of sample surveys to gen-\nerate social indicators has only lately been fully appreciated,\nthere is a somewhat hazardous tendency to ignore other pos-\nsibilities. Before the modern form of sample survey was in-\nvented, a good deal could be said in Recent Social Trends\nabout \"changing social attitudes,\" on the basis of statistical\nanalyses of the content of printed communications. Since then,\ncontent analysis has become a recognized subdiscipline in its\nown right. Its techniques have, in part, proved susceptible of\nincorporation into computer programs. We are beginning to\nsee ambitious proposals for construction of social indicators\nby means of content analysis of documents (12). Suggestive\nexamples of the possibilities of constructing rather long time\nseries are a study (13) of the extent and nature of press cov-\nof the trend of secularization in communications of a religious\nSocial -accounting\nIf one thrust of the social indicators movement is the demand\nfor new kinds of data, another is the aspiration to provide\nmore rational and effective means of ordering and reducing the\ndata. Currently available collections of social statistics are\nseen as lacking in conceptual systematization as well as com-\nprehensiveness. There is no clear sense in which the several\nitems in a congeries of social statistics are cumulative. In\nparticular, they cannot be aggregated into some global mag-\nnitude analogous to the Gross National Product, nor can they\nreadily be synthesized into composite indexes such as the\nConsumer Price Index.\nOne reaction to this situation has been to identify as a first\norder of business the construction of a comprehensive list of\ncategories of social indicators in order to control the analysis\nand presentation of currently available data and to prescribe\nthe measurements that need to be created to fill the gaps.\nThe rationales offered for such lists of categories are varied.\nOne proposal is to ground the classification in a classification\nof basic human needs. Another suggests that the kinds of data\nto be compiled be selected in terms of relevance to an abstract\nmodel of the structure and performance of the social system.\nA third suggestion, which eschews any pretentious theoretical\njustification, is to structure a system of social indicators in\nterms of a consensually derived \"list of social concerns.\" Such\na list actually constitutes the chapter outline of Social Indica-\ntors, 1978. It differs in mostly uninteresting ways-except for\nthe signal omission of a chapter on \"social opportunity and\nparticipation\" and the inclusion of one on population-from\nthe list proposed by the Organisation for Economic Co-opera-\ntion and Development (OECD) (15) as being \"common to\nsince 1952 (perhaps as much a measure of general morale\nmost OECD countries.\"\nSymposium: Developing Social Indicators 5099\nAn honest evaluation of the voluminous literature proposing\nclassificatory \"models\" for social indicators would have to be\nthat they are either sterile or stultifying. Most contributions\nto this literature are de facto sterile-they are simply ignored.\nBut the greater disservice is done by schemes of \"social con-\ncerns\" that prematurely foreclose alternatives, that imply a\nspecious consensus concerning values and goals, and that\nthreaten to divest the concept of social indicators of all its\nbenignly subversive connotations. What we are getting in the\nofficial lists of \"social concerns\" is a roster of the topics on\nwhich it is \"safe\" to issue statistics. If the \"social concerns\"\nrationale is pursued to its logical terminus, we shall not expect\nour social reports to contain much that is novel, newsworthy,\nsurprising, exciting, or controversial.\nOne may hope for a different kind of contribution to \"social\naccounting\"-the development of formal analytical structures\nto aid in discerning regularities in data and the significance\nthereof. One example is Richard Stone's proposal for integrat-\ning systems of social statistics by means of a stock-flow ac-\ncounting scheme (16, 17). In principle, such a scheme can\naccommodate most kinds of information on the states and\nmovements of members of a population. The formal apparatus\nis a matrix framework and set of accounting identities from\nwhich models based on outflow and inflow coefficients may be\ndeveloped. At the present stage of discussion, it is contem-\nplated that a statistical system organized on this principle\nwould cover population and migration, education, manpower,\nfamilies, delinquency, health, and intergenerational mobility-\nin short, most of the topics that turn up on the conventional\nlist of \"social concerns.\" It is a little startling to realize that\nprinciples of demographic accounting can be made to apply in\nall these fields.\nBut it will be a long time before a system like that Stone\ndescribes can be made fully operational. We will continue for\nthe foreseeable future to work with a miscellany of techniques\nand accounting schemes. For what they are worth, the social\nindicators movement has access to the various methods of time\nseries analysis developed in studies of economic fluctuations.\nThere is even the suggestion (18) that the formidable appara-\ntus of spectral analysis be brought to bear upon the study of\nsocial processes.\nOf more immediate utility are the new methods for analyz-\ning multi-way contingency tables (19). These will be especially\nserviceable in realizing the potential value of replicated base-\nline studies. In most of these replications the samples are\nsmall, so that efficient use of the data reliably to infer time\ntrends is of critical importance.\nIt could happen that the next important conceptual de-\nvelopment in social accounting will be an improved under-\nstanding of the problems of cohort analysis. We have recently\nseen the cohort concept applied to studies of social change in\nsuch domains as educational attainment, earnings, voting,\ndelinquency, epidemiology, migration, human development,\nand various social attitudes, not to mention mortality and\nfertility, the classical loci of cohort analysis. In most, though\nnot all, of these areas an improvement in our intuitive under-\nstanding of change does seem to result from making explicit\nthe role of the cohort as an intermediary in the process of\nsocial transformation (20). What is only beginning to -be\nrecognized, however, is that robust understanding is gained by\nmeans of cohort analysis only when it is supported by strong\nidentification problem (21), i.e., the problem of correctly al-\nlocating the observed variation in an indicator, classified by\nage and time, into components corresponding to theoretical\neffects of age, period, cohort, and their interactions. To realize\nthe promise of cohort analysis, we shall have to do much more\nin each subject-matter domain to clarify the theoretical basis\nfor inferring cohort effects (or the absence thereof).\nSocial science\nVirtually all writers agree that social indicators should be use-\nful in describing changing social conditions. Some also insist\nthat the descriptions have a normative component so that, in\naddition to showing how things are changing, indicators will\ndisclose whether they are changing for the better or worse.\nWe now consider another stipulation, that social indicators\nshould have an explanatory or theoretical function. Land (22)\nproposes to recognize as social indicators only those social\nstatistics that are components-variables or parameters-in a\nquantitative social system model. Acceptance of this criterion\nwould lead us to recognize, with Land, that specification of\nmodels of social processes and institutions and estimation of\ntheir parameters are major problems to be solved in develop-\ning social indicators. However, such a definition of our task\nmight- not require a wholesale modification of the present\ndistribution of effort. The specification of models will surely\nentail use of some formal accounting schemes; and estimation\nof parameters (or empirical testing of models) will require\nsupplies of data produced by social bookkeeping routines. Of\ncourse, we may modify our accounting schemes and our data\ncollection priorities in the light of the requirements of those\nmodels that seem most attractive.\nBoth the descriptive and the normative uses of indicators\ndepend ultimately upon some framework of theoretical as-\nsumptions. If these are only implicit in our interpretations of\nindicators, there is little hope of improving those interpreta-\ntions. If they are made explicit, we may be able to adjudicate\nthe claims of alternative interpretations. It makes a real dif-\nference, for example, whether a decline in fertility is a reflec-\ntion of the spread of information about birth-control tech-\nniques, or whether the main force behind it is a shift in repro-\nductive norms or ideals. If both the innovation and the ad-\njustment approaches, as Carlsson (23) terms them, are ex-\npressed in terms of models, even fragmentary collections of\ndemographic indicators may suggest that one of the two ap-\nproaches is to be preferred. Policy makers might then avoid\nthe mistake-if, as Carlsson suggests, it is a mistake-of\nseeking to reduce the rate of population growth merely by\nfostering diffusion of contraceptive knowledge.\nRegardless of how high a priority we put on model con-\nstruction, it is too much to expect that any large part of the\nsocial indicator domain will soon be covered by plausible\nmodels. For the time being we can only allude to a few ex-\namples of models; and these are best seen as primitive begin-\nnings rather than convincing illustrations of what models can\ndo for the development of social indicators.\nApart from the specialized field of formal demography-\nmodels in which have been reviewed by Keyfitz (24)-per-\nhaps the most popular models in recent sociological investiga-\ntions are structural equation systems depicting the process of\nsocioeconomic achievement as a function of social origins\n(ascribed-status), ability, motivation, social influences, earlier\ntheoretically based assumptions that serve to resolve the\nachievement, and stochastic error (\"lucky)). Coefficients in\nsuch models have been estimated for different birth cohorts,\npermitting some conclusions about time trends in inequality\nand opportunity (25). Summary figures from early work of\nthis kind appeared in Toward a Social Report. Thanks to re-\nsearch carried out more recently, including the 1973 replica-\ntion of the 1962 Survey of Occupational Changes in a Genera-\ntion, the next social report could appeal to more sophisticated\nversions of the achievement model and cite more voluminous\ndata in support of trend estimates. This field, incidentally, is\none where a great deal of lay, journalistic, political, and even\nprofessional opinion is given the lie by the matching of a sub-\nstantial body of reliable social facts to a reasonably cogent\nmodel. It thus illustrates the value of social indicators as such\nand also the role of models in constructing appropriate indica-\ntors of such an intrinsically complicated idea as \"opportunity\"\n(26). The achievement models are not, thus far, dynamic\nmodels of social change. But they are of service in studying\nchange, in that comparisons over time or for successive cohorts\nmay be decomposed into variation in achievement attributable\nto variation in exogenous variables and that due to structural\nchange, i.e., shifts in parameter values.\nAn interesting example of a more nearly dynamic model is\nafforded by Mueller's work (27) on presidential popularity;\nrevised parameter estimates were obtained by Hibbs (28),\nusing generalized least squares to take account of time series\nautocorrelation. The model yields surprising results, in that\neffects of war and economic recession do not emerge as statis-\ntically significant determinants of a president's popularity.\nThe social indicator here comprises 299 readings by the Gallup\nPoll on the percentage of the public approving the way the\npresident is handling his job, covering the years from 1945\nthrough January 1969. Perhaps this work will stimulate efforts\nto construct indicators and models for that important but\nelusive magnitude, level of general morale of the American\npublic.\nStill a different kind of model is advanced in Hamblin,\nJacobsen, and Miller's A Mathematical Theory of Social\nChange (29). On the empirical side they invest heavily in fitting\ntrend curves to a variety of time series, ranging from cigaret\nconsumption to airplane hijackings, from railroad passenger\nmiles to annual number of Ph.D.'s awarded. Attention is given\nto a limited number of equation forms: power function, ex-\nponential, decaying exponential, and logistic. But these are\nnot regarded merely as mathematically convenient ways to\nsummarize trends. Instead, an attempt is made to derive from\nbehavioral axioms the functional form that will apply to a\nseries, once that series is classified as belonging to one of a\nlimited number of kinds of basic cumulative processes: social\nadaptation (acquisition of expertise in collective efforts),\nadoption of innovations, use of innovations, modification of\ninnovations, and socioeconomic development. This work is too\nrecent to have been widely reviewed by competent specialists.\nBut it is, at least, a serious attempt to supply basic theory\nwhich explains the movements of some kinds of indicators.\nSocial forecasting\nThe tight symbiosis of economic indicators with economic\nforecasts may represent an unrealistically high level of as-\npiration for the social indicators movement. In any event, we\ndo not yet sense the demand for social forecasts as a stimulus\nto the improvement of social indicators in the way that the\ntwo endeavors have interacted in the economic realm. There is,\nof course, a great vogue for something called \"futures re-\nsearch.\" Despite the participation of such scholars as Daniel\nBell and Bertrand de Jouvenel, futurism has made little con-\ntact with the social indicators movement and has shown little\ninterest in the mundane problems of social indicator develop-\nment (30). It was not always so. The great pioneer of social\nindicators, W. F. Ogburn, was much interested in forecasting\nand saw it as a natural outgrowth of the effort to determine\nthe direction of social trends (31).\nWe do have as more or less continuous enterprises the prep-\naration of population projections and, based upon them, pro-\njections of marriages, households, school enrollment, educa-\ntional attainment, labor force, occupational manpower, and\nquantities derived from or used in obtaining these projections.\nIt is interesting that none of them, except for the age distribu-\ntion of the population to 2000, was shown in Social Indicators,\n1973; no reason was given for their omission, although it was\nexplicitly noted in the ",

USA\nSymposium\nDeveloping Social Indicators*\n(social change/social accounting/social statistics/social reporting/social forecasting)\nDepartment of Sociology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Ariz. 85721\n Introduction to the volume. One con-\njectures that this wealth of projections is seen primarily as\nsatisfying the routine needs of government agencies for as-\nsumptions to use in planning service programs, budget re-\nquests, and the like.\nQuite a different concept was communicated by President\nNixon in mid-1969, when he announced the establishment of\nhis short-lived National Goals Research Staff (ref. 32, pp.\nforecasting future developments, and assessing the longer-range\nconsequences of present social trends,\nmeasuring the probable future impact of alternative courses of\naction, including measuring the degree to which change in\none area would be likely to affect another,\nestimating the actual range of social choice-that is, what\nalternative sets of goals might be attainable, in the light of\nthe availability of resources and possible rates of progress,\ndeveloping and monitoring social indicators that can reflect the\nthe present and future quality of American life, and the\ndirection and rate of its change....\nThe first and only report of the National Goals Research\nStaff was quite disappointing in the light of expectations\nraised by the President's statement. How its work might have\ndeveloped is better suggested by the report of the Commission\non Population Growth and the American Future. The Com-\nmission took a fresh look at the way in which population pro-\njections are to be used. Instead of trying to calculate probable\nupper and lower limits on future population size, it presented\npopulation projections as the outcome of a hypothetical\nchoice of the nation between the 2-child and 3-child family:\n\"If families average two children in the future, growth rates\nwill slow, and the population will reach 300 million in the year\n33, p. 23). Much of the Commission's case rested on showing,\nby means of other projections and less formal arguments, that\nthe consequences of the former would probably be preferable\nto those of the latter demographic alternative, in terms of the\neconomy, impact on resources and environment, problems of\ngovernment, and social conditions.\nProjections and forecasts, therefore, have uses other than\nthat of merely anticipating and foretelling what is likely to\noccur. Indeed, an argument can be made that interpretation\nof past trends is equivocal in the absence of assumptions about\nwhat the future holds (34). In that event, forecasting had best\nSymposium: Developing Social Indicators 5101\nbe built into the structure of the social indicators system. We\nmay note, too, that a significant use of forecasts is to stimulate\nefforts to improve models. Thus, while the record of population\nprojections, interpreted as forecasts, is disappointing, Keyfitz\nobserves that their repeated failures provided insights and\nincentives for much of the progress in methods of demographic\nanalysis made in the last several decades (24).\nSocial reporting and advising\nIn many discussions, social indicators and social reporting are\nbracketed, as if to suggest that the two are nearly synonymous.\nBut social indicator publications are not necessarily social re-\nports. SocialIndicators, 1973, for example, contains (bydesign)\nlittle or no analysis, interpretation, evaluation, or recommen-\ndations, except as some of these may be assumed to underlie\nthe selection of indicators and the form in which they are pre-\nsented. Presumably a social report, by contrast, should feature\none or more of these components. Indeed, a practical test of a\nproposed indicator is its suitability for inclusion in an analyti-\ncal, interpretive, or policy-oriented social report.\nWe do not have much basis for anticipating what a social\nreport would look like if it were to be a Social Report of the\nPresident prepared with the aid of his Council of Social Ad-\nvisors. Toward a Social Report was not relevant as a trial run\nin this respect, since it did not simulate the situation in which\nthe Chief Executive is the nominal author of the document.\nOne can imagine that a President's Social Report would be\nused to launch major policy initiatives, as the Economic\nReport was used in launching the War on Poverty. It is\nequally possible that in any given administration the Social\nReport would be just one more routine document perfunctorily\nassembled by a tired staff to comply with a legislated require-\nment.\nIt need not be assumed, however, that future social reports\nwill be written by (or, rather, on behalf of) the President. The\ncommittee that produced Recent Social Trends foresaw the\npossibility of a \"National Advisory Council\" that would\nengage in a continuous consideration of \"basic social prob-\nlems.\" The suggestion was echoed, a third of a century later,\nby the National Commission on Technology, Automation, and\nEconomic Progress, which suggested the formation of a\n\"national body of distinguished private citizens-concerned\nwith 'monitoring' social change, forecasting possible social\ntrends, and suggesting policy alternatives...\" (ref. 35, p.\n106). A body of this kind might well produce social reports to\nthe President (as well as to the nation). In that case, we might\nguess that in regard to format and rhetoric, social reports\nwould resemble the reports of the several national and Pres-\nidential commissions that have investigated various social\nissues in the last few years, instead of being \"social\" versions\nof the President's Economic Report.\nOne possibility to conjure with is that future social reports\nwill not even be printed documents or will not be released only\nin that form. The Population Commission issued an official\nfilm version of its report, which was viewed first on television\nand then released for wide circulation. The film was successful,\nto judge from the response of reviewers, in conveying some of\nthe Commission's more controversial conclusions and recom-\nmendations. As a vehicle for communicating the import of\nsocial indicators, it left a good deal to be desired. This is not\nsurprising. A review of the state of the art in \"kinostatistics\"\npossibilities but also a great deal of uncertainty about how to\nbridge the gap between the social science disciplines that pro-\nduce the statistical content of a social report and the media\nspecialists who must express that content in audiovisual\ndisplays.\nAnother connection which is often assumed is a linkage of\nsocial reporting with social advising. Here, again, we should\nrecognize that the Council of Economic Advisors, charged to\naid in formulating economic policy as well as writing the\nEconomic Report, affords only one of several possible models\nfor social reporting and advising. We know from the example\nof Recent Social Trends that a group can prepare an excellent\nsocial report without having any advisory function and with-\nout issuing pronouncements on specific policies. In any event,\nit is now generally understood that formulating national goals,\nenunciating social policies, designing programs, evaluating\ntheir success, and allocating resources, all are functions that go\nbeyond social indicators and social reporting, however valua-\nble social indicators may be as aids to these functions (37).\nIndeed, we must continually ask ourselves whether the\nproper aspiration of the social indicators movement is to as-\nsume the mantle of the philospher-king. Do we really want\nmost to create the best-managed society that knowledge can\ndesign? Or would we prefer to serve as agents of enlightenment\nfor diverse societies that will perpetually be redefining their\nown ends and continually transcending their definitions?\nWhether we like it or not, the long-run effect of cultivating\nsocial indicators-like that of acquiring any other knowledge\n-is not calculable. We can only surmise that it may be pro-\nfound. Like the social science enterprise as a whole, social\nindicators have the power to alter \"our fundamental ideas\nabout human desires and human possibilities. When such\nconceptions change, society changes\" (ref. 7, p. 2).\n1. Bauer, R. A. (ed.) (1966) Social Indicators (M.I.T. Press,\nCambridge, Mass.).\n2.
