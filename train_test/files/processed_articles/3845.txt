    "abstract": "Abstract\nThese two studies tested the prediction that the group practice of a procedure for the development of consciousness, the\nTranscendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi program, by a sufficiently large group of individuals would be sufficient to reduce\ncollective stress in the larger population, reflected in two stress-related health indicators, infant mortality rate and drug-\nrelated fatality rate. Based on theoretical prediction and prior research, from January 2007 through 2010 (intervention\nperiod), this effect should have been measurable. Change in the rates of these two indicators during the intervention period\nwere estimated from 2002 through 2010 data using a broken-trend (or segmented trend) intervention model with time series\nregression methods. Significant changes in trend for both the infant mortality rate and drug-related fatality rate were evident\nat the predicted time and in the predicted direction, controlling for preintervention trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation.\nThe changes in trend were both statistically and practically significant, indicating an average annual decline of 3.12% in infant\nmortality rate and 7.61% in drug-related fatality rate. Diagnostic tests are satisfactory and indicate that it is unlikely that the\nstatistical results are attributable to spurious regression. The mechanism for these collective effects is discussed in view of\npossible alternative hypotheses.\n",

Previous research analyzed the impact of the\nsame intervention on homicide and violent crime (Dillbeck\n& Cavanaugh, 2016) and motor vehicle fatalities and fatali-\nties due to other accidents (Cavanaugh & Dillbeck, 2017).\nIn a broader context, this article expands a substantive\nbody of research on the collective effects of changes in con-\nsciousness and quality of life. In these studies, change in the\nquality of societal consciousness is measured by group prac-\ntice of the TM-Sidhi program, an advance practice of the\nTranscendental Meditation technique.1 Previous studies have\nfound that when practiced by a sufficient number of people,\nthese subjective procedures are associated with an extended\ninfluence on social behavior in society, a finding that has\nimplications for a broader understanding of consciousness.\nWe will first describe these procedures, then the theoreti-\ncal implications for the nature of consciousness implied by\nprevious research on these procedures, and then discuss the\nindicators chosen for the present studies.\nThe Transcendental Meditation technique is described by\nits founder as a simple, experiential mental procedure of\n\"turning the attention inwards towards the subtler levels of a\nthought until the mind . . . arrives at the source of the thought\"\nindicates a state of \"pure consciousness\" gained when the\nmind settles down to a mode of inner silence in which the\ndivision of knower, knowing, and known is transcended and\nawareness is open to itself alone (Roth, 2002).\n1Maharishi University of Management, Fairfield, IA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nMichael C.

Alertness is indicated by increased electroencephalo-\ngram (EEG) coherence during Transcendental Meditation\npractice; increased integration of brain functioning is also\nfound longitudinally (Dillbeck & Bronson, 1981; Travis\ning reduced cortisol during the practice and more effective\ncortisol response to stress, indicates that the physiological\nchanges during the practice are counter to those found during\nstress and support recovery from stress (Jevning, Wilson, &\nThere is a large body of research on the stress-reducing\neffects of this procedure for health, particularly cardiovascu-\nlar health (e.g., reviewed by Schneider & Carr, 2014), and on\npsychological variables, which can be considered in the con-\ntext of theories of human development (e.g.,Alexander et al.,\nIn the 1960s, based on the understanding of conscious-\nness contained in the Vedic tradition of India, Maharishi pre-\ndicted that even a small proportion of the society experiencing\nthis state of pure consciousness would be sufficient to enliven\ngreater order and positivity in the collective consciousness of\nsociety, reflected in decreased stress, resulting in decreased\nnegative behavioral trends such as crime and violence\nIn 1976, Maharishi introduced the advanced TM-Sidhi\nprogram, the purpose of which is described as accelerating\nthe integration of the inner silence experienced during\nTranscendental Meditation with daily activity outside of\nmeditation (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986). In discussions\nwith physical scientists in the light of the ancient Vedic\nknowledge, he formalized the prediction that when a group\npractices the TM-Sidhi program together, only the square\nroot of 1% (1%) of the population--as compared with 1%\npracticing Transcendental Meditation individually--would\nbe required to create a calming and orderly influence in soci-\nety (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986). The square root term is\nby analogy to coherent phenomena in physical systems in\nwhich the combined intensity of coherent elements can be\nproportional to their square (Hagelin, 1987). On that basis, it\nshould be possible to influence very large populations: for\nexample, the 1% of a city of 9 million is 300 individuals,\nand is near 1,800 for the current U.S. population.\nThe relatively small number of required TM-Sidhi pro-\ngram group participants permits quasi-experiments using a\ntime scale of analysis finer than that of annual data.\nA number of published studies have used time series (TS)\nintervention analysis or transfer function (TF) analysis (Box\n& Jenkins, 1976) to evaluate effects at the city, state, or\nnational/regional levels on indicators that reflect reduction of\nsocial stress, such as decreased crime and violence, or\nimprovement in comprehensive quality of life indices.\nFor example, Dillbeck, Cavanaugh, Glenn, Orme-\nJohnson, and Mittlefehldt (1987) found that when the size of\na group of TM-Sidhi program experts who had assembled on\ncourses exceeded the 1% of the populations of each course\nlocation (Delhi, India; Metro Manila, Philippines; Puerto\nRico), TS intervention analysis showed reduced crime2 inde-\npendent of alternative explanations. Using TS intervention\nmethods, similar results were found on monthly crime rates\nin Merseyside, United Kingdom (Hatchard, Deans,\nCavanaugh, & Orme-Johnson, 1996). Two studies in\nWashington, D.C., using TF methodology found predicted\nvariations between the size of a TM-Sidhi group in the city\nand decreased violent crime rate when the size of the group\nwas over the predicted threshold (Dillbeck, Banus, Polanzi,\n(Hagelin et al., 1999) was a prospective study with predic-\ntions registered in advance. Both studies in Washington,\nD.C., found no evidence for alternative hypotheses.\nAt both state and national levels, improvement was found\nusing TS intervention analysis on a comprehensive index of\nquality of life integrating multiple monthly behavioral and\nhealth-related variables (e.g., homicide or crime, motor vehi-\ncle fatalities, cigarette consumption) during months when the\nsize of TM-Sidhi group was larger than the required 1% in\nRhode Island (Dillbeck et al., 1987) or in the United States or\nthe United States plus Canada (Dillbeck & Rainforth, 1996).\nSimilarly, reductions in an index of national violent fatalities\n(homicide, suicide, and motor vehicle fatalities) were found\nusing TS intervention analysis over a multiple-year period\nduring weeks when the size of a stable, large TM-Sidhi group\nwas sufficient to predict an effect for either the United States\nA study in Israel, spanning multiple societal levels and\naddressing multiple outcome parameters for each, found that\nover a 2-month period, daily quality of life indices for\nJerusalem, Israel as a whole, and the Israel\u00adLebanon conflict\n(ongoing at that time) significantly improved during days\nwhen the size of a temporary group was sufficiently large to\nyield theoretically predicted effects at the city, national, or\nregional levels (Orme-Johnson,Alexander, Davies, Chandler,\n& Larimore, 1988). Comparable results were found using TS\nintervention analysis and TF analysis. A number of alterna-\ntive explanations and alternative analysis models were effec-\ntively considered both in the original article and in subsequent\nresponses to methodological questions (Orme-Johnson,\nIn a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of vio-\nlence due to the Lebanese conflict, Davies and Alexander\n(2005) looked at all seven intervention periods during a\nDillbeck and Cavanaugh 3\nprogram groups of sufficient size (on temporary courses) to\npredict an impact upon the conflict in Lebanon either from\nwithin Lebanon, near to Lebanon, or even at some distance.\nUsing daily event data from nine news sources that were\nblind coded by an independent Lebanese coder using scales\nderived independently for research on the conflict, TS inter-\nvention analysis indicated a significant impact of each of the\nseven temporary groups on reduced conflict. The analysis\ncontrolled for temperature, holidays, and weekends, and the\nfindings were independent of alternative TS noise models.\nMultiple indicators of reduced conflict also replicated this\neffect when combining intervention periods.\nIn these studies, there is an implied underlying connection\nbetween individuals that would permit such far-reaching\neffects of stress reduction beyond that which could be\nexplained by behavioral interactions. That is, as described by\nthe Vedic tradition of India (Radhakrishnan, 1953), pure con-\nsciousness is proposed to have a field-like character, as\nopposed to the isolated quality of individual consciousness.\nOn that basis, it is predicted that a calming or stress-reducing\ninfluence will be experienced in the broader collective con-\nsciousness of society (Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, 1986).\nIn extending these studies into the health area, we assume\nthat collective stress (or its reduction) can have an impact\nupon some stress-related health outcomes, not only upon\nbehavioral violence such as crime. Analyzing U.S. annual\ndata using a state stress index that combined economic, fam-\nily, and community stressors (Linsky, Bachman, & Straus,\ndicted violent crime rate and also maladaptive behaviors\n(Linsky & Straus, 1986). However, social stress so defined\nwas less associated with mortality due to illness, illnesses\nwhose morbidity at the individual level are exacerbated by\nstress. One of the possible reasons for this is the unknown\nand variable time lag between serious morbidity and mortal-\nity, not to mention between serious stress and morbidity\nThe health indicators selected for this study are those for\nwhich mortality is directly influenced by stress, rather than\nthose indicative of disease states that develop over time and\nwhose time course may be inconsistent and hard to specify.\nSpecifically, infant mortality (IM) and deaths due to drugs\n(DD) were selected for investigation. The following is a\nrationale for each outcome variable.\nIM is both a fundamental indicator of national health as\nwell as a stress-related phenomenon in the United States.\nCompared with other developed countries, IM rates are high,\nwith the United States ranking 26th among Organisation for\nEconomic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) coun-\ntries (MacDorman, Mathews, Mohangoo, & Zeitlin, 2014).\nPreterm birth is one of the major causes of IM; in 2005,\n36.5% of U.S. infant deaths were due to preterm-related\ncauses, and 68.6% of all infant deaths occurred to preterm\ninfants (MacDorman & Mathews, 2008). IM affects African\nAmerican mothers much more severely than White mothers\nor mothers of other racial/ethnic groups, and preterm birth is\nsubstantially higher among African American mothers\n(MacDorman & Mathews, 2011; Mathews, MacDorman, &\nThoma, 2015). Preterm birth risk has been shown to be\nrelated to perceived stress, pregnancy-related anxiety, and\nperception of racial discrimination (Dole et al., 2003). The\ncauses of IM are multiple; nevertheless, stress is one major\ninfluence, as described above. The cascade of physiological/\nhormonal events in the mother's body initiated by stress and\ntheir interaction with the physiology of labor initiation are\ndescribed in detail by Gennaro and Hennessy (2003) and by\nDD of all types also reflect to a great degree the immedi-\nate effects of stress and are affected by the degree of con-\nscious alertness or vigilance. The category of DD fatalities\nincludes all deaths for which drugs are the essential cause,\nirrespective of whether the drug was illicit or prescription,\nincluding acute poisoning and also medical conditions aris-\ning from chronic use. DD have increased substantially since\n1990, a period in which prescriptions for opioid analgesics\nfor pain management rose dramatically. Between 1999 and\n2002, deaths due to opioid analgesic poisonings rose over\n90%, becoming a larger source of drug poisoning deaths than\nthose due to heroin or cocaine (Paulozzi, Budnitz, & Xi,\ndose deaths, 57.7% involved pharmaceuticals, and of those,\n75.2% involved opioids (either alone or in combination with\nother drugs; Jones, Mack, & Paulozzi, 2013).\nOpioid analgesics have been increasingly prescribed as\npart of more aggressive pain management regimens.\nChemically, the opioids influence the body in a similar way\nas opium-derived opiates such as morphine and heroin\n(Volkow, 2014). For this reason, vigilance must be main-\ntained to avoid addiction to opioid analgesics. Chronic stress\nhas been found to increase the vulnerability to addiction\nhad become the most common type of accidental death, more\ncommon than auto-related deaths (Harmon, 2010). Recent\nresearch has found that the death rate for White non-Hispan-\nticularly among the least educated, reversing a trend of\nprevious decades (Case & Deaton, 2015). The authors\nhypothesize that this increase in mortality could be driven by\nfactors including deaths due to the increased availability of\nopioid prescriptions and, in some cases where addiction had\noccurred, transition to heroin when opioid restriction\nincreased. They note that financial stress and insecurity may\nhave contributed to these results, including wage stagnation\nand diminished retirement prospects. Morbidity also\nincreased in this group as indicated by self-reported level of\nphysiological and mental health as well as increased preva-\nlence of chronic pain. Increased DD and alcohol poisoning\n(as well as several other factors) also increased in other\n4 SAGE Open\nraise the overall mortality rate.\nIt is clear that the rapid rise of DD in the past two decades\nis a serious health concern in the American population as a\nwhole. At the same time, it seems likely that this variable is\ndirectly affected by perceived life stress and, in the case of\nopioid medication, is influenced by vigilance and self-aware-\nness to avoid addiction. It is in this context that change in DD\nis a potential reactive indicator of changes in the quality of\ncollective consciousness.\nThe two studies reported here evaluate the effects on U.S.\nDD and IM associated with the rapid creation of a large\nTranscendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi group sufficient in\nsize to create a hypothesized influence of reduced stress and\nincreased alertness in the collective consciousness of the\nUnited States. The rapid establishment of this group, approxi-\nmating in size a step function that could be appropriately mod-\neled by a binary variable, offered a straightforward opportunity\nfor quasi-experimental intervention research (Cavanaugh &\nThe hypothesis of the current research, consistent with\nprevious studies, is that there would be a significant impact\nof the independent variable measured in terms of decreased\nrates of IM and drug-related deaths.\nGeneral Method\nIntervention\nTo assess the predicted effect on these two fatality rates of the\nlargest group of TM-Sidhi participants in North America, the\nanalysis used a binary intervention variable based on the size\nof this group. The location of the group was in Fairfield, Iowa,\nat Maharishi University of Management, where students, fac-\nulty, staff, and community members assemble each day to\npractice the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi pro-\ngram together before and after school or work. The meditation\nhalls on campus record the morning and evening daily totals.\nTo expand the size of the TM-Sidhi program group from\nunder 1,000 to a number sufficient to create a predicted posi-\ntive influence for the whole United States (approximately\naccording to the 1% formula), a special course was held at\nthe University beginning in July 2006 for visitors from the\nUnited States or around the world.3 To further increase the\nnumber of participants, starting in November 2006, a large\ngroup of several hundred visiting Indian experts in the\nTM-Sidhi program were hosted nearby in their own facili-\nties.4 After that, the total number of TM-Sidhi participants\nbegan to exceed the predicted threshold in January 2007 and\nremained above or near that level throughout the interven-\nperiod of that length was adopted because when the first data\ncollection began to evaluate this intervention, 2010 was the\nmost recent data available for homicide and violent crime\n(Dillbeck & Cavanaugh, 2016), and this period was subse-\nquently extended to other variables for the sake of compari-\nson (Cavanaugh & Dillbeck, 2017).

For example, in the case of a nonstationary random\nwalk, the differencing parameter d = 1, and the series may be\ntransformed to I(0), or stationarity, by first differencing. The\nRobinson test rejects the null hypothesis (p < .001) that the IMR\nresidual series is nonstationary (see Table 1),11 supporting the\nconclusion that IMR is broken-trend stationary, exhibiting sta-\ntionary fluctuations around a broken trend.\nStationarity of the regression residuals is required for\nvalid statistical inferences regarding the estimated regression\nparameters in the intervention model (Banerjee, Dolado,\nNewbold, 1986). Broken-trend stationarity for IMR implies\nthat the OLS regression estimates in Table 1 have standard\ndistributions and thus the observed significant change in\ntrend is unlikely to be the result of \"spurious regression\"\nregressions can result when time trends are fitted to nonsta-\ntionary variables that contain a random walk component\n(\"stochastic trend\"). A key signature of spurious regressions\nis highly autocorrelated, nonstationary regression residuals.\nThe latter violate the distributional assumptions underlying\nstatistical inference for TS regression.\nTable 1 reports a formal test for broken-trend stationarity\nof a TS with a known (exogenous) structural break (Perron,\nhypothesis (p < .01) that the IMR TS is a nonstationary ran-\ndom walk with drift (Perron, 1989; Zivot & Andrews,\ntrend stationary, displaying stationary fluctuations around a\nlinear trend with a known, one-time break in the trend func-\nThe results of all other diagnostic tests for model ade-\nquacy are satisfactory.

Likewise, White's general test for heteroscedasticity\n(White, 1980) fails to reject the null hypothesis that the\nregression errors are homoscedastic or, if heteroscedasticity\nis present, it is unrelated to the regressors.

Thus, the diagnostic tests for model ade-\nquacy support statistical conclusion validity for the statistical\ninferences reported in Table 1.\nStudy 2: Results of Analysis of DFR\nPlot of DFR\nThe plot of DFR in Figure 3 displays monthly seasonal fluc-\ntuations and a rising preintervention trend followed by a\non preintervention data continues DFR's preintervention\nupward trend, rising substantially above observed DFR (see\nRegression Results for DFR\nWe estimate the following broken-trend intervention model\nto test the hypothesis of a shift to a reduced trend slope for\nDFR during the intervention period:\nt t t\njt j t\nj\nt DT\n= + + - + +\n+\n-\n\n    \n( )\n.\nwhere lag 1 of DFR\nt\nis included (with regression coefficient\n\n) to model its first-order autoregressive dynamics.

The statistical\nfindings reported in Table 2 suggest that these results cannot\nbe explained by autocorrelation, seasonal variation, or preex-\nisting trends in DFR.\nRegression Diagnostics for DFR\nAll diagnostic tests reported in Table 2 for adequacy of the\nestimated intervention model are satisfactory. That no regres-\nsion residuals exceed 3.5 standard errors indicates the\nabsence of extreme outliers. The LM tests for autocorrelation\nof residuals at lags 1 to 6 and lags 1 to 12 are not significant,\nand no autocorrelations at lags 1 to 36 are individually sig-\nnificant, indicating that the regression residuals appear to be\nserially uncorrelated, stationary white noise. The frequency\nrejects the null hypothesis (p < .001) that the residual series\nis nonstationary (see Table 2).19 The latter test, plus the\nabsence of significant residual autocorrelation, lend further\nsupport to the conclusion of the Perron test (see Table 2) that\nDFR is likely broken-trend stationary.20 Thus, the diagnostic\ntests for adequacy of the broken-trend regression model sup-\nport statistical conclusion validity for the statistical infer-\nences reported in Table 2.\nDiscussion\nThe results of the two studies indicate that, as hypothesized,\nthere was a significant and substantial reduction of the trends\nof IMR and DFR during the intervention period 2007 through\nvention. The null hypothesis of no effect of the intervention\non mortality trends was strongly rejected for both mortality\nrate series. Diagnostic tests for the broken-trend intervention\nanalysis indicate the appropriateness of the statistical\nassumptions underlying the analyses. These results are thus\nconsistent with the conclusion that the intervention may have\ncontributed to the observed trend shifts for both mortality\nrates.\nThe use of an intervention at the national level in a pro-\nspective quasi-experimental design is inherently stronger as\na design than an ex post analysis of archival data on the rela-\ntionship of interdependent factors using variants of multiple\nregression analysis (Glass, 1997). Nevertheless, it is neces-\nsary to consider possible threats to internal validity, namely,\nalternative possible causes of the reduction of the stress-\nrelated mortality variables investigated in these studies.\nA major societal impact that occurred during the interven-\nated with the subprime mortgage crisis.

The plot of the monthly rate of drug-related accidental fatalities for August 2002 to December 2010 displays monthly seasonal variation and a rising\ntrend in the preintervention period followed by a flattening of the trend during the intervention period 2007 through 2010 (see vertical line in the plot).\nDuring 2007 through 2010, the forecast of DFR (dotted line) continues its preintervention upward trend, rising substantially above observed DFR. DFR =\ndrug-related fatality rate.\nunemployment in October 2009) does not precisely track the\nintervention period. More importantly, the economic stresses\nassociated with the recession (e.g., unemployment) would be\npredicted, if anything, to increase rather than decrease the\nstress-related health indicators examined in these studies.\nOne specific factor to consider in the case of drug-related\ndeaths is that one might speculate that increased public and\nprofessional awareness of the hazards of opioid analgesics in\nrecent years might have contributed to a reduction in their\nprescription during the intervention period. As outlined in\nthe introduction, increased used of opioid drugs is consid-\nered to contribute substantially to the rise of DD. However,\ndata indicate that opioid sales increased throughout the base-\nline and intervention period of this research, reaching their\ning more available rather than less available through the\nintervention period.\nBecause of the national scope of measurement of these\nstudies, and the specificity of the intervention period and\nassociated changes in mortality rates, a viable alternative\nexplanation will require almost simultaneous implementa-\ntion of a treatment or medical technology or program that\nwould influence both the variables of these studies and dis-\nproportionately affect two different subpopulations of the\nUnited States (higher prevalence for African American\nwomen in the case of IM and for middle-age Whites in the\ncase of DD). We are unable to think of any such plausible\nalternative explanation that would satisfy these two require-\nments. In the absence of plausible alternative explanations,\nthe significant intervention impacts on both mortality vari-\nables found in this article suggest the possibility of some\nunderlying connection between individuals who are not\napparently behaviorally connected. As outlined in the intro-\nduction to this article, such a connection independent of\nbehavioral interaction is described as the collective con-\nsciousness of society. More specifically, the Vedic tradition\nof India identifies collective consciousness as having its\nbasis in an underlying level of pure consciousness, which is\npredicted to be influenced by the intervention examined\nhere, group practice of the advanced TM-Sidhi program.\nTable 2.

From a theoretical perspective, it is\nonly necessary that the members of the intervention group\nbe trained in the advanced TM-Sidhi program to stimulate\nthe hypothesized field of pure consciousness. It is under-\nstood that, as a practical necessity, the individuals who par-\nticipated in this project would be those with some prior\nexpertise/training to volunteer their time. But, in principle,\nfor this effect to be created, any group with basic stability,\nsuch as groups of students or the military, could be\nemployed once trained in the TM-Sidhi program. In some\ncountries, such groups are being created and future research\nwill be necessary to confirm their effects.\nThe result of these studies, if further replicated, provide\ngovernment leaders with a potential means to relieve stress\non a large scale in society that is independent of structural\nsocial change and benefits public health. Although social\nstress as a mediating variable was not directly measured,\nthe consistency of the present results with those reported\npreviously for reduced homicide and violent crime\n(Dillbeck & Cavanaugh, 2016) lends support to a hypothe-\nsis of such a mediating influence. In light of these results, it\nis suggested that when TM-Sidhi groups are established\nwith government support (most easily, with existing groups,\nsuch as military personnel), the potential impact of such\nTM-Sidhi groups be evaluated on stress-related public\nhealth parameters.\nAuthors' Note\nRaw data may be obtained from the first author.\n"
