    "abstract": "Abstract\nLittle is known about the thousands of people who take part in communal violence. Existing research is largely based on\ninterviews, impressionistic accounts and government records of arrestees. In contrast, this paper examines data from a\nnovel survey of a representative sample of residents of Alexandra, a township in South Africa where a 2008 nation-wide\nwave of anti-immigrant riots began. Data on participation in the attacks were collected using a method ensuring the\nprivacy of responses, thus potentially reducing response bias. In contrast to the conclusions of existing research, which\nemphasize the participation of young males, the survey data reveal that a significant number of participants were female\nand participants were not particularly young, being 34 years old on average. Participants are more likely to support an\nopposition party, attend community policing meetings and have a high-school education.\n",

Such communal riots may produce significant\nhuman rights violations and loss of life, and may even be a\nharbinger of more severe political or intergroup conflict\nAnumber of scholars, including Brass (1997), Dancygier\nquently provided careful analyses of the determinants of\ncommunal violence. They do so from the \"top down\", how-\never, treating riots as events and offering ecological-level\nexplanations. A newer group of researchers have comple-\nmented this research with microlevel examinations of indi-\nviduals' motivations for participation in attacks on other\nDespite this accumulation of research on why riots occur\nand why people participate, we still have little idea who the\nrioters are, and how many they number. There are both the-\noretical and policy reasons why we should want to know\nthe answers to these questions. Data on numbers might\noffer a challenge to policymakers who dismiss rioters as\na tiny criminal minority (see Misago et al., 2010; Sears\nand McConahay, 1969), while knowledge of who\nriots--the socio-demographic factors that correlate with\nparticipation--would seem to be a prerequisite to under-\nstanding why riots occur.\nThis paper uses recent survey data from South Africa to\ntackle both these questions: the numbers who take part in\ncommunal violence and the socio-demographic factors that\npredict who does. I use a survey of a sample of residents of\na South African township1 that was struck by communal\nviolence between locals and African immigrants in 2008\n(see Misago et al., 2010). Three features of the survey ren-\nder it useful for the task of describing riot participants.\nFirstly, the survey was conducted in Alexandra, the town-\nship where the 2008 violence began and where it reached its\ngreatest intensity. Secondly, interviews were conducted with\na representative sample of adult South African residents of\nthe area, permitting externally valid inferences about who\nactually participated in 2008. Thirdly, the participation\nquestions were asked using a method designed to ensure the\nprivacy of respondents, and thus the validity of responses.\nWho participates in communal violence?\nSurvey evidence from South Africa\nChristopher Claassen\n Keywords\nCommunal riots, violence, participation\nDepartment of Government, University of Essex, UK\nCorresponding author:\nChristopher Claassen, Department of Government, University of Essex,\nWivenhoe Park, Colchester, CO4 3SQ, UK.\nEmail: cclaas@essex.ac.uk\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nMy results are as follows. With respect to numbers, I\nfind that 8.5% of adult South African residents of the area\nparticipated in some way in 2008. In contrast to existing\ndescriptions of participants, my survey data show that a sig-\nnificant number of women took part in the 2008 riots in\nAlexandra (30% of participants). Moreover, and again in\ncontrast to existing accounts, participants were not particu-\nlarly young (median age: 34). Those who participated in\n2008 were more likely to support an opposition party and to\nhave a high-school (versus higher) education, particularly\namong the male subsample. Participants, particularly\namong the female subsample, also attended more commu-\nnity policing meetings, which were the sites where violence\nwas initially organized (Misago et al., 2010).\nCommunal riots\nResearchers have noted high levels of xenophobia in South\nAfrica, both in the form of pronounced anti-immigrant atti-\ntudes (Mattes et al., 1999) as well as widespread lynchings\nof immigrants (Harris, 2004). Such xenophobia is particu-\nlarly severe in the townships that ring South African cities,\nwhere many black South Africans live, and where many\nimmigrants from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and further\nafield have made their homes. In May of 2008 a wave of\nanti-immigrant violence swept these townships, lasting for\nThese attacks can be viewed as examples of communal\nriots, as they are: (1) a form of collective violence lasting\nhours, days or weeks; (2) incidents where violence is perpe-\ntrated by ordinary people, that is, not regular or irregular mem-\nbers of the armed forces; and (3) events in which the targets\nare some other social, national, ethnic, racial or religious\ngroup.As this definition suggests, communal riots are more or\nless synonymous with \"deadly ethnic riots\", as described in\nHorowitz's (2001) encyclopaedic book of the same name.\nA number of major studies--Horowitz's included--have\ninvestigated the causes of communal riots. Scholars have\ntypically treated riots as events, explaining their occurrence\nas an extension of competition, either between groups\nanti-immigrants riots (Misago et al., 2010) echoes this latter\nthread in the literature, finding that the attacks were insti-\ngated at township community policing meetings, often with\nthe involvement of the leaders of these informal institutions.\nParticipation in communal violence:\nwho and how many?\nAlthough the bulk of the existing scholarly effort has been\nexpended on explaining why communal riots occur, some\nscholars have also turned their attention to the participants\nwho make up the mobs. Horowitz's (2001) exhaustive\nreview of secondary sources concludes that participants are\nworking class and \"overwhelmingly male\" (258) with ages\nranging \"from the teens to the thirties, with the median\nsample of individuals arrested after the 1990 Osh riots in\nKyrgyzstan finds that all but one of the accused were male,\na majority were from 25 to 30 years of age with few older\nthan 40 and most had completed high school. Historical\nresearch on the European food riots of the 18th and 19th\ncenturies, in contrast, notes the participation of women,\nThese conclusions regarding participants in communal\nriots--contradictory as they are--are limited by the unrelia-\nble sources of data on which they rest: convenience samples\nand impressionistic accounts. Far preferable as a research\nmethod is a public opinion survey of a representative sample\nof residents of an affected area, which is the technique I\ndeploy. Surprisingly, there are only two other such surveys,\nas far as I am aware. The first is by Scacco (2010), and is a\nprobability survey of the riot-prone Nigerian cities of Jos and\nKaduna, conducted in 2008. Although Scacco does not sam-\nple women, based on the assumption that women did not par-\nticipate, she finds that 19% of adult males took part in the\n2001 riots. She finds, moreover, that participants tended to\nbe poorer and active in community policing organizations.\nThe second is the Los Angeles Riot Study of the neighbour-\nhoodsaffectedbythe1965Wattsriots(SearsandMcConahay,\nthe affected areas took part, 68% of respondents who admit-\nted taking part were under 30, and 62% were male. Indicators\nof socio-economic status, however, show little or no relation-\nship with participation.\nThus, in sum, the sparse evidence we have regarding\nnumbers of participants suggests that they are a minority,\nbut their absolute number is large. We know even less with\nrespect to the socio-demographic predictors of participa-\ntion: some sources suggest that rioting is carried out by\nyoung men; others note the participation of women and\nolder people. The data on participation and socio-economic\nstatus is similarly contradictory.\nData and methods\nData on participation in communal riots is best gathered\nusing a public opinion survey of a probability sample of\nresidents of an area recently affected by such a riot. In April\nand May 2011, I conducted such a survey of a representa-\ntive sample of 497 adult South African residents of\nAlexandra, where the 2008 violence began and where it\nreached its greatest intensity (Misago et al., 2010).\nSampling\nThere is no reliable list of addresses in townships like\nAlexandra, nor are landlines telephones or internet\nClaassen 3\nconnections common. To arrive at a representative sample.\nI stratified by the major housing types of government flats,\nhostels and houses and shacks. Then, using satellite photo-\ngraphs, I divided each stratum into equal-sized clusters and\nrandomly selected clusters from within each stratum.\nWithin each cluster, each interviewer was assigned a direc-\ntion in which to walk and used a randomly chosen sampling\ninterval to select dwellings (houses, shacks, flats or hostel\nrooms) for further investigation. The same sampling inter-\nval was used to select households from within each dwell-\ning. Finally, a specially constructed random number table\nwas used to select a respondent from the adult South\nAfrican members of the household. Face-to-face interviews\nwere conducted in or near the respondents' homes in\nAlexandra. One call-back was required for non-contact and\nno substitutions were permitted. The response rate (AAPOR\nSome 8% of the sample (N = 45) were not present in\nAlexandra at the time of the 2008 attacks. These respond-\nents were excluded from the analysis that follows, leaving\nMeasuring participation\nThe outcome of interest is individual participation in the\nattacks of 2008. Respondents may be reluctant to disclose\nsuch potentially incriminating information, but researchers\nhave asked similar questions of Alexandra residents--have\nreported success, suggesting that social desirability biases\nmay in fact be quite minimal.\nNevertheless, in an effort to reduce response bias as\nmuch as possible, I used a variation of the Gallup secret\nballot technique--first adapted for riot participation by\nScacco (2010)--when asking respondents about their par-\nticipation in the 2008 riots. Five questions were asked:\nwhether the respondent had (1) joined in one of the protests\nthat preceded some of the attacks, (2) threatened or intimi-\ndated anyone, (3) looted, (4) harmed anyone, or (5)\ndestroyed any shacks during the attacks of 2008.\nRespondents received a small card with five rows of the\nletters \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\", and were asked to circle the letter\nthat corresponded to the correct answer for each question.5\nWhen all five questions had been completed, respondents\nwere then asked to seal the card in an envelope that had\nbeen provided, ensuring that their responses remained hid-\nden from the interviewer.\nThe survey was conducted three years after the riots.\nAlthough such an interval would render many, if not most\nkinds of memories vague and unreliable,Alexandra residents\nwere very unlikely to have forgotten their participation (or\nnon-participation) by the time of the survey. The attacks of\n2008 are branded in the public imagination in Alexandra.6\nMoreover, immediately before gathering the measures of\nparticipation, I asked respondents if they remembered the\nattacks. Although there may be some social desirability bias\nin answering in the affirmative, it is revealing that not one\nrespondent claimed to have no knowledge of the attacks.7\nProducing estimates from complex survey\nsamples\nDescribing participants in communal riots requires making\ninferences from a sample to a population. Given that my\nsample is complex--featuring both stratification and\nclustering--this inference is somewhat complicated. I use\nvarious functions available in the survey library in R\n(Lumley, 2010), which (1) adjust estimates by the inverse\nof the probability of selection into the sample, (2) post-\nstratify the estimates,8 (3) calculate variances taking strati-\nfication, clustering and post-stratification into account, (4)\nestimate confidence intervals using a beta-binomial distri-\nbution, which Korn and Graubard (1998) recommend for\nsmall proportions and (5) combine estimates from the five\nmultiply-imputed datasets.\nResults and discussion\nI begin with the results regarding numbers of participants.\nFigure 1 displays my estimates of the proportion of the popu-\nlation of Alexandra who took part in various ways in the\n2008 attacks. In particular, I find that 8.5% of adult South\nAfrican residents of Alexandra report some form of partici-\n5.3% of women. Moreover, 3.6% of Alexandra residents\ntook part in one of the more aggressive behaviours: destroy-\ning immigrants' shacks or engaging in physical assault.\nProportion participating\nJoined\nprotest\nLooted Intimidated\nothers\nDestroyed\nshacks\nAssaulted\nothers\nAny\nbehaviour\nFigure 1.

Note that while participation is measured\nas a recollection of behaviours conducted in 2008, the\nother covariates were measured at their 2011 levels.\nAlthough this makes little difference for exogenous factors\nsuch as gender, home language and age, factors such as\nparty support and meeting attendance are potentially\nendogenous to earlier riot participation. Causal interpreta-\ntions of the effects of these latter variables may not be\nwarranted.\nFigure 2 displays the bivariate cross-tabulations. Each\nplot corresponds with the cross-tabulation of participation\nand one of the 11 socio-demographic variables. This explor-\natory analysis reveals that levels of participation in the 2008\nanti-immigrant riot in Alexandra vary considerably by\nsocio-demographic subgroup. Among some subgroups\n(such as those who live in hostels, support an opposition\nparty or attended two or three community meetings in the\nlast year), more than 15% participated. In other subgroups\n(such as being Tswana-speaking, living in a government flat\nor being older than 50), few individuals took part.\nI then include all the covariates in three logit models of\nparticipation, the first using the whole sample, and the sec-\nond and third utilizing just the male and female subsam-\nples.9 The results are presented in Table 1.\nParty support and age emerge as significant correlates of\nparticipation, with gender, meeting attendance and having a\nhigh-school--compared to higher--education significant\nat the 90% level. The use of logit coefficients, dummy vari-\nable contrasts and quadratic terms (for age) suggest that a\ngraphical display of predicted probabilities would be useful\nfor interpreting the results of these regressions (see Gelman\nand Pardoe, 2007). Thus, in Figure 3, I plot the predicted\neffects of all variables that show a significant effect (at the\n90% confidence level) in Table 1. These five plots show the\npredicted probabilities of having taken part (y-axis) when\nvarying each of the five significant covariates (x-axis),\nwhile holding all other variables at their means.\nReturning to the regression results, one of the strongest\nfindings that emerges from this analysis is the relationship\nbetween opposition party support and having participated\nin the 2008 riots. This association is even stronger in the\nmale subsample. The first plot in Figure 3 shows the effect\nclearly: Alexandra residents who support the ANC, with all\nother variables held constant, are estimated to have about a\n7% probability of having taken part. This predicted proba-\nbility rises threefold to over 22% for residents who support\nan opposition party.\nA second finding of note is the effect of age. The quad-\nratic term is negative and significant--both in the whole\nsample and the male subsample--indicating a concave\nTable 1. Logistic regression analysis of participation in 2008.\nWhole sample Men Women\naOmitted category is African National Congress (ANC) support.\nbOmitted category is employed.\ncOmitted category is formal house or flat.\ndOmitted category is higher education.\nEstimates are post-stratified by home language, employment status and age. Design-based standard errors in parentheses.\n6 Research and Politics \nslope. Figure 3 then provides a much clearer picture of how\nage is related to the probability of participation. This plot,\nthe fifth in Figure 3, shows this concave quadratic effect of\nage on probability of participation. The respondents most\nlikely to have participated are those who were around 34\nyears old in 2008. This is quite different to the angry young\nmen who are typically regarded as the protagonists of both\nprotest and communal riots (Horowitz, 2001). Indeed, the\nmodel estimates that respondents who were 20 years old in\n2008 had only half the likelihood of taking part in the\nattacks of respondents who were 34--5% versus 10%.\nThirdly, I find that the probability of participation in the\n2008 riots is associated with attendance at community\npolicing meetings. This correlation between participation\nand meeting attendance is strongest in the female subsam-\nple. Although the meeting attendance survey item asked\nrespondents to report their attendance in 2011, existing\nresearch suggests that participants in the 2008 riots were\nprobably drawn from attendees at policing meetings. As\nMisago et al. (2010) describe, these meetings were the\norganizing venues for the attacks on foreigners.10\nThe results are also interesting for socio-demographics\nthat are not significant covariates. In contrast to Scacco\n(2010), I find that participation is not a function of poverty,\nwith socio-economic status showing only a weak and insig-\nnificant relationship. In addition, in contrast to previous\nqualitative research on the anti-immigrant violence of 2008\nther being a long-term resident of the area nor being Zulu-\nspeaking is an important correlate of having participated.\nConclusion\nThis paper presents estimates for two unanswered ques-\ntions regarding communal riots: firstly, the question of how\nmany people participate in such violence; secondly, the\nquestion of who takes part. The evidence is obtained from a\nsurvey of a probability sample of residents from an urban\nslum in South Africa where anti-immigrant violence\noccurred in 2008. The advantages of this dataset for the\nquestions at hand are its representative sample and the\nmeasurement of participation using the privacy-enhancing\nGallup secret ballot technique.\nThere are six main findings. Firstly, like Scacco (2010),\nI find that around 9% of local residents of the affected area\ntook part in the violence of 2008. Secondly and thirdly, in\ncontrast to the conclusions of existing research (Horowitz,\ngender of participants, I find that although male partici-\npants predominate, a significant number of women\nalso join in attacks on another group. Neither were the par-\nticipants especially young, having a median age of 34.\nANC None Opposition\nParty Support\nPredicted Probability of Participation\nPrimary\nschool\nSome high\nschool\nHigh\nschool\nHigher\neducation\nLevel of Education\nMale Female\nGender\nNumber of Meetings Attended\nPredicted Probability of Participation\nFigure 3.

Firstly, there is a three-year gap between the riots in\nquestion and the survey fieldwork. Emigrants are also not\nsampled. Most importantly, the covariates of participation\nare measured contemporaneously to the survey, while par-\nticipation is measured retrospectively, limiting the causal\ninterpretations of many of the findings presented here. Our\nunderstanding of participants, and thus our understanding\nof communal riots, would benefit from a future study that is\ndesigned to overcome such limitations.\n"
