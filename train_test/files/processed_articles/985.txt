Patterns of overweight, inactivity, and snacking\nObjective: To examine patterns of inactivity and snacking\nand their relationship with overweight status in Chinese\nchildren.\nResearch Methods and Procedures: The study population\nwas drawn from the 1997 China Health National Survey\nrepresentative sample from nine provinces. The 2000 Cen-\nters for Disease Control and Prevention BMI charts were\nused to calculate \"at risk of overweight\" as those above the\n85th percentile. Three days of 24-hour recall dietary data\nand detailed questions on physical activity and inactivity for\nthe previous 7 days were used.\nResults: 9.4% of the children were classified as overweight.\nWeekly mean and range of hours spent watching television/\nvideos, playing video games, studying, and in inactive\nstudying did not differ in any meaningful manner between\noverweight and normal weight children. Snacking is incon-\nsequential in China, comprising only 0.9% of energy intake.\nDiscussion: Chinese children are less overweight, less in-\nactive, and less likely to ingest calories as snacks than\nchildren in the U.S. The absence of impact of these mea-\nsures of inactivity, which are below an hour per day for the\naverage Chinese child, indicate the possible value of limit-\ning television viewing and other types of inactivity in other\ncountries. Modern Western-style television programming\nand advertising started to come to China after 1997; there-\nfore, extensive changes in television viewing patterns are\nexpected to emerge.\n",

Popkin\n Key words: BMI, television, video games, studying, in-\nactive transport\nIntroduction\nExtensive research in the United States and a few other\ncountries has documented the effect of high levels of inac-\ntivity and television viewing on childhood obesity, but little\nresearch has been undertaken in countries where the expo-\nsure to television has not been long term and where levels of\ntelevision viewing have not been at very high levels except\namong selected children. China, where pediatric obesity is\nless prevalent but growing rapidly, is a most useful case\n(1,2). Obesity, in both children and adults, is associated with\nsignificant morbidity and mortality from chronic conditions\n(3). Perhaps surprisingly, increased physical inactivity, es-\npecially television viewing, has been found to be more\nclosely associated with obesity than increases in recall mea-\nsures of physical activity (4). In fact, only previous obesity\nis more closely associated with current obesity than is\ntelevision viewing in some studies (5). Theories to explain\nthis association stem from the decreased physical activity,\nincreased snacking and consumption of high-fat, high-sugar\nfoods, and decreased resting metabolic rate associated with\ntelevision viewing (6,7). Not only can television viewing\nreplace time spent in physically active pursuits, but it may\nalso condition the child who is not hungry to snack when-\never he or she is watching television (8).\nMost studies use children who watch 2 hours or less of\ntelevision per day as the reference group, but this is usually\na unique sample. Some investigators have found a variation\nin the risk of overweight at levels of inactivity less than 2\nhours per day. For example, Anderson et al. found that\nchildren ages 8 to 16 years who watched 1 hour or less of\ntelevision per day had statistically significantly lower BMIs\nthan children who watched 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 4 or more\nhours of television per day. (Boys and girls ages 8 to 10\nyears had the highest prevalence of television viewing in the\nCarolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North\nCarolina.\nAddress correspondence to Barry M.

Longitudinal and other research is needed to ex-\nplore such issues and to determine whether such a cause-\nand-effect relationship exists that warrants changing the\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics guidelines and other sim-\nilar recommendations.\nThe most consistent research on this issue comes from the\nUnited States, supplemented by studies from Mexico City,\nboth of which have very high levels of television viewing\nand childhood obesity (5,11). In the United States and\nMexico City, children watch 23 and 17 hours of television\nper week, respectively; this is more time than they spend in\nany other activity except sleeping (5,11,12). Not only is\ntelevision viewing felt to affect obesity through the reduc-\ntion of energy expenditure, but several investigators note\nthat children snack widely during their viewing of television\n(6,7). Snacking among U.S. children is an important source\nTelevision is in an earlier stage of incorporation into the\nculture in China than in the United States and Mexico.\nTelevision ownership and channel availability vary widely\nby geographic location in China. Except for the modern\nHong Kong Star network that provides TV programming\nequivalent to that found in the United States, other program-\nming is less focused on the modern shows and advertise-\nments that might encourage child viewing. (At the time of\nthis survey, only a very small proportion of Chinese house-\nholds in this sample had Hong Kong Star.) The purpose of\nthis study is to examine the prevalence of overweight and\npatterns of inactivity and snacking behavior, major contrib-\nutors to pediatric overweight in the United States and other\ncountries, in a population of children that has not yet as-\nsimilated television into its culture as profoundly as has the\nUnited States. Specific questions to be explored include the\nfollowing. \"What is the prevalence of overweight in Chi-\nnese children?\" \"How much time are Chinese children\ninactive?\" \"Do the inactivity patterns in Chinese children\ndiffer by overweight status?\" \"To what extent does snacking\nplay a role in the diet of Chinese children?\"\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nThe study population consisted of 1385 Chinese children\n6 to 11 years of age living in nine geographically diverse\nprovinces of China in 1997. All data were collected for the\nChina Health National Survey, an ongoing, longitudinal\nsurvey. The purpose of this survey was to assess the effect\nof socioeconomic change on health-related behaviors and\nhealth outcomes, including physical activity (and inactivity)\nand child overweight. Details on the survey design and data\nfor the children are found elsewhere (14,15). Dietary data\nwere based on 3 days of a combination of weighing house-\nhold food intake and three consecutive 24-hour recalls (15).\nPhysicians obtained the anthropometry in a clinical setting,\nand the remaining data were obtained from in-home inter-\nviews. BMI was calculated as weight divided by height\nsquared and compared with the 2000 National Center for\nHealth Statistics Growth Charts, the most recent U.S. ref-\nerence, which is recommended by the World Health Orga-\nnization for international comparisons (16). \"At risk of\noverweight\" and \"overweight\" were defined as greater than\nthe 85th or 95th percentile of BMI, respectively. Because of\nthe small percentage of the study population in the \"over-\nweight\" category, these categories were combined and are\nheretofore referred to jointly as \"overweight.\" Height,\nweight, and inactivity data were available for 880 of the\nAn eating occasion was defined as a \"snack\" if it oc-\ncurred outside of usual mealtimes. Inactivity was con-\nstructed by summing the total minutes per week spent\nviewing television, playing video tapes or games, studying,\nor in inactive transport such as car, bus, subway, or riding\non a bike pedaled by an adult. Activities at school were\nclassified as \"active\" or \"inactive\" time. For example, read-\ning was categorized as inactive time, but gymnastics was\ncategorized as active time. All data on physical inactivity\nwas collected by self-report from both the parent and the\nchild.\nParticipant characteristics, inactive time, and snacking\nbehaviors in the overweight and nonoverweight groups\nwere compared using Student's t tests. Children with miss-\ning dietary and physical activity data, representing 3% of\nthe sample, were excluded from analysis, and no systematic\nsample selectivity bias was found.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the overweight and nonoverweight\nsamples are presented in Table 1. Compared with children\nliving in rural areas, a higher percentage of urban children\nof the households of the overweight children was signifi-\ncantly lower than that of the households of the nonover-\nBMI z score of the overweight children was significantly\nhigher than that of the nonoverweight children (df  228,\nThe mean times spent in the various components of\ninactivity were similar for children ages 6 to 8 and 9 to 11,\nso these data are combined in Tables 2 and 3. As shown in\nTable 2, a significant proportion of the children never watch\ntelevision, and this proportion was considerably higher\namong the overweight group (78% vs. 59%), although this\nwas not statistically significant. The only statistically sig-\nnificant difference was the additional 1.8 hours per week or\nInactivity and Snacking in Chinese Children, Waller, Du, and Popkin\n15 minutes per day of television viewing among the\nnonoverweight group--a difference that is not behaviorally\nvery different. Of note, our data show that in 1997, almost\nnone of the households had access to modern television\n(e.g., Hong Kong Star programming that includes content\nfrom the West and the Chinese equivalent). Furthermore, a\nlarge proportion of the children did not engage in inactive\ntransportation when they traveled to school, so the mean\namount of inactive travel time was minuscule. Chinese\nchildren spent almost as much time studying (4.8 h/wk) as\nthey did watching television (5.3 h/wk), emphasizing the\nimportance of studying as a component of children's inac-\ntivity in China. Video tapes and games and inactive trans-\nport (such as car, train, bus, or riding on a bike pedaled by\nan adult) contributed to a small percentage of inactive time\nin this population (0.3 and 0.14 h/wk, respectively).\nAnalyses of snacking behavior found that 11.0% of the\nChinese participants reported consuming calories as snacks.\nThe mean percent of total energy from snacks for all chil-\ndren in the sample was 0.9% and that in snackers was 7.8%.\nMean percent of total energy from snacks among all chil-\ndren in the sample and among only those who snacked did\nnot differ significantly by overweight status or by urban vs.\nrural residence.\nDiscussion\nOne reason that it is important to study the relationship of\ninactivity to childhood obesity in various populations is\nTable 1.

This study has demonstrated that a country with\nvery low levels of television viewership and little snacking\ndoes not demonstrate the same levels of overweight nor the\nsame relationships with inactivity measures that are found\nin the United States. Inactive time and snacking behavior in\nthese countries are strikingly different. Whereas Chinese\nchildren spend a median of 5.1 h/wk watching television\nand a median of 0.3 h/wk playing video games, U.S. chil-\ndren watch a median of 23 h/wk of television and spend a\nmedian of 7.3 h/wk playing video games. Only 11% of\nChinese children snack, and both snackers and nonsnackers\nobtain a very small proportion of their total calories from\nsnacks (7.8% and 0.9%, respectively). However, Jahns et al.\n(13) found that 91% of U.S. children of the same age range\nsnack, and both snackers and nonsnackers obtain a large\nproportion of their daily calories from snacks (24% and\nstudy population walked to school, which is likely a greater\npercentage than in the United States, where many children\nare transported to school in a school bus or car. Elsewhere,\nwe have shown how important transportation is for child\nactivity patterns and for obesity among adults (17,18).\nWhatever the reason for these differences, they point to\npotential causes for inactivity and its negative effects in the\nUnited States.\nAside from the limited number of intervention studies, it\nis hard to unravel cause and effect in studying the role of\ntelevision viewing in the United States and other high\ntelevision-viewing societies. Whereas the choice to view\ntelevision is often linked causally with overweight status\nand overall activity level, even longitudinal observational\nstudies have difficulty in ascertaining causality. Moreover,\ntelevision viewing is an integral part of U.S. culture, and\nthere is a relatively high level of viewing among even the\nmost active children. Interventional studies that have dem-\nonstrated that decreasing inactivity is an effective means to\ncombat obesity in children assist us in interpretation, but\neven these studies might be limited by selectivity and im-\nplementation biases (5). Thus, decreasing inactive time is a\npromising target for intervention, and, therefore, the asso-\nciation between inactivity and overweight needs to be stud-\nied in depth.\nThe comparison of these Chinese results with studies\nfrom the United States suggests that there may be a thresh-\nold of hours of television viewing above which television is\nassociated with obesity and below which it is not. Andersen\net al. found that boys and girls ages 8 to 16 years who\nwatched 2 to 3 hours of television per day were at risk to\nhave a statistically significantly higher BMI than children in\nthis age range who watch 2 hours or less of television per\nday (9). Furthermore, girls who watched 4 or more hours of\ntelevision per day were found to be at risk to have a\nstatistically significantly higher BMI than children of this\nage range who watched 2 to 3 hours of television per day.\nOur results, that the children in our study watched a mean of\n1 hour or less of television per day, agree with the existing\nliterature, in which no studies to date have found a relation-\nship between television viewing and overweight in children\nwho watch 2 hours or less of television per day. In addition,\nthe total combined inactivity of the children in this study,\nincluding both television viewing and time spent in other\ninactive pursuits, was 2 hours per day. Thus, although the\ntime that the children in this study spent being inactive was\ndistributed differently among the possible means of inactiv-\nity than among children in the United States, obesity does\nnot seem to be associated with 2 hours or less per day of\ninactivity in any of the countries that have been studied so\nIn-depth studies of the relationship between television\nviewing and overweight in children have been conducted\nin the United States and Mexico (5,11). Studies that\ninclude television viewing in the analysis of childhood\nobesity have also been conducted in Canada and France\n(19,20). By studying other countries with different levels\nof television viewing and programming availability, we\nhope to learn more about the potential role of television\nviewing in childhood obesity. Thus, the greatest strength\nof this study may lie in the choice of population, because\nno other country studied has levels of television viewing\nand inactivity as low as China. Additional strengths in-\nclude the high quality of the diet data, the availability of\na full set of physical inactivity data, and the large study\npopulation.\nLimitations of this study include the cross-sectional\nnature of the study, the lack of availability of information\non the content of the television watched, and the fact that\nthe inactivity data were collected by self-report. The\ncross-sectional nature of the study is a major limitation\nbecause it is not possible to demonstrate a cause-and-\neffect relationship, as cross-sectional studies have been\nless likely to find an association between television view-\ning and obesity than longitudinal studies (21). We have\nno validation study for these inactivity measures for\nchildren, but similar measures on adults have produced\nimportant and statistically significant effects on adult\nobesity incidence (17,22). Finally, the calorie excess/\ndeficit needed to gain/lose weight can be very small.\nSelf-reported physical activity and, thus, inactivity, mea-\nsures may not be sensitive to this amount of variation\nThe importance of this study lies in its demonstration of\na lack of association between very low levels of inactivity\nand obesity. The results of this study provide grounds for\nfuture studies to identify the threshold of inactivity associ-\nated with an increased risk of obesity. Hopefully, the iden-\ntification of this threshold can be used to decrease the threat\nof obesity in the world's children.\nInactivity and Snacking in Chinese Children, Waller, Du, and Popkin\n"
