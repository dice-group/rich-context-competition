Taber1*, Jamie F. Chriqui1, Renee Vuillaume2, Frank J.

Kennedy School of Government, Harvard\nUniversity, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States of America, 3 Department of Economics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America\n Introduction\nSugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption has become one\nof the primary targets of childhood obesity prevention efforts in the\nUnited States (U.S.) [1]. The negative health effects of SSB\nconsumption are well-documented [2,3], including recent ran-\ndomized trials that found SSB consumption was associated with\nhigher weight gain [4,5]. Sodas are the most popular SSB among\nadolescents in the U.S. [6,7] and were the biggest source of\ncalories of any food/beverage group among 14\u00ad18 year-olds in\ngradually been replacing soda with other SSBs, but soda remains\nthe most heavily consumed sweetened beverage [6].\nNumerous policy initiatives have been proposed to reduce\nconsumption of soda and other SSBs, including taxes, marketing\nregulations, limits on portion sizes, and limits on sugar content [9\u00ad\n12]. One of the most widespread initiatives is banning the sale of\nSSBs within schools [13,14]. Evidence at all grade levels suggests\nthat policies that ban SSBs have succeeded in reducing students'\naccess to SSBs [15\u00ad18], though policies at the high school level\ntend to focus exclusively on soda. Nationally, the proportion of\nhigh school students who could purchase soda in school declined\nhigh school students could purchase some type of SSB in school in\nPolicies have achieved their direct goal of reducing SSB access,\nbut there is relatively little evidence that such changes influence\nstudents' consumption of soda or overall SSBs. Several studies\npolicies reduced in-school access [16]. These studies utilized\nseveral independent data sources that sampled students nation-\nwide. In contrast, however, studies in specific states or districts\nreported that sweetened beverage restrictions succeeded in\nreducing sweetened beverage intake [23,24].\nThese inconsistent findings could be explained by numerous\ndemographic, behavioral, environmental, or policy characteristics.\nPrevious studies have already suggested that the effects of policies\non student behavior may be modified by race/ethnicity [21,22], or\nwhether the policy targets SSBs other than soda [16] and whether\nit targets all school venues [24,25]. Additionally, experts have\npointed out that students can easily obtain SSBs from other\nsources (e.g., home, convenience stores) [10,20,26] and thus\nimprovements to the school food environment may be less\nsuccessful among students who have more access outside of\nschool. The impact of school nutrition policies could also depend\non whether school-based changes are complemented by policies in\nother sectors (e.g., soda taxes). Finally, health consciousness could\nplay a role, as a recent study of calorie labels found that this\ninitiative was more effective among consumers who were less\nhealth conscious [27].\nTo enhance school policy effectiveness, policymakers must\nconsider how effects are modified by factors at the individual,\nlocal, or state level. The objective of this study was to determine if\nthe association between school vending machine access and soda\nconsumption varies by demographic, environmental, or policy\nmeasures in a nationally representative sample of high school\nstudents. We further analyzed dietary behaviors outside of school\n(e.g., fast food consumption) to assess whether students who do not\nhave access to vending machines in school obtain more unhealthy\nfoods/beverages elsewhere.\nMethods\nThis cross-sectional study linked student data from the National\nYouth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study (NYPANS), con-\nducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nin Spring 2010, with state-level data on soda taxes, restaurant\ntaxes, and laws governing the sale of soda in schools, collected as\npart of the Bridging the Gap (BTG) research program. The study\nwas approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University\nof Illinois at Chicago and the University of Texas Health Science\nCenter at Houston.\nStudent sample\nThe objective of NYPANS was to measure diet, physical\nactivity, and sedentary behaviors, and environmental determinants\nof such behaviors, in a nationally representative of 9th\u00ad12th grade\nstudents [28]. Students were sampled using a 3-stage cluster\nsample design; school and student participation was voluntary, and\nlocal permission procedures were followed. The school response\nrate was 82%, the student response rate was 88%, and the overall\nparticipated in NYPANS.\nFor the purpose of our study, students were excluded because\nthey were missing data on vending machine access within school\n(n = 691), soda consumption (n = 42), fast food consumption\n(n = 10), lunch source (n = 496), or other variables of interest\n(n = 209), or if they were unsure if vending machines that sold\nsweetened beverages were available in school (n = 1194). Students\nwho were excluded did not differ from the study sample with\nrespect to weight status, soda consumption, or gender, but they\nwere more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities (p,0.001), tended\nto be in lower grade levels (p,0.001), were less likely to have\naccess to vending machines (p,0.001), were more likely to obtain\nlunch away from home/school (p = 0.02) and reported more fast\nstudents in 27 states.\nStudent-level measures\nAll data were obtained using a written questionnaire completed\nin class. The independent variable of interest was whether the\nschool had ``a vending machine that students can use to purchase\nsoda or pop, sports drinks, or fruit drinks that are not 100% juice,\nsuch as Coke, Gatorade, or Sunny Delight?'' Hereafter, we use the\nterm ``vending machines'' to refer specifically to this type of\nvending machine.\nOur dependent variables of interest were soda consumption, fast\nfood consumption, and whether students obtained their lunch\naway from home or school on schooldays. We focused only on\nsoda, not other SSBs, because soda has been the primary target of\npolicy changes on the high school level. Soda consumption was\nmodeled as both a continuous measure of the number of servings\nconsumed in the past 7 days (ranging from none to ``4 or more per\nday'') and a binary measure of whether students consumed at least\none soda per day in the past 7 days (hereafter referred to as ``daily\nconsumption''). The questionnaire explicitly told students to report\nconsumption of diet soda separately; analyses in this study only\nutilized data on regular soda consumption. Fast food was modeled\nas a continuous measure of the number of days in which students\nconsumed fast food in the past 7 days. Students were instructed to\ninclude consumption of soda and fast food from all sources\nregardless of time or location.\nAnalyses for this study also utilized data on race/ethnicity, sex,\ngrade, availability of food at home, and weight loss behaviors.\nStudents' race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic White\n(ref), non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Other.\nHome food access was categorized based on whether students\nusually or always had access to fruits/vegetables or unhealthy\nsnacks (``chips, cookies, or cake'') at home; we cross-classified\nstudents as having access to fruits/vegetables only (ref), unhealthy\nsnacks only, both, or neither. Weight loss behaviors were\nmeasured using a series of 10 questions that asked students if\nthey had tried to lose weight in the past 30 days through various\nbehaviors. For our purpose, we classified 5 of the 10 behaviors as\nhealthy (exercising, consuming less food or fewer high-fat foods,\nconsuming fewer calories, consuming more fruits/vegetables,\ndrinking more water) and the remaining 5 as unhealthy (skipping\nmeals, fasting, smoking, vomiting or taking laxatives, taking diet\npills/powders/liquids without a doctor's advice). Note that these\nclassifications reflect the general health of the behaviors, not the\nbehaviors' effectiveness as weight loss methods. Students were then\ngrouped into 3 mutually exclusive categories of weight loss\nbehavior \u00ad those trying to lose weight only through healthy\nbehaviors, those trying to lose weight through at least one\nunhealthy behavior, and those not trying to lose weight.\nWe considered analyzing whether the association between\nvending machine access and dietary behaviors varied by weight\nstatus (normal weight, overweight, obese) based on height and\nweight data obtained by CDC staff. However, this analysis was\ndropped because the quantity of missing height/weight data was\nrelatively large and exploratory analyses suggested that the\nassociations of interest did not vary by weight status.\nState Policies and School Vending Machines\nState data\nThe study included analyses of whether the associations of\ninterest varied by state tax rates for soda sold in grocery stores,\nstate tax rates for foods sold in restaurants, or state laws governing\nthe availability of soda in all school venues. Tax rates were\ncompiled from state statutory and administrative law using\nprimary legal research methods [29,30] and were confirmed by\nthe state [31,32]. They were modeled as a continuous measure of\nthe difference between soda/restaurant tax rates versus the general\nfood tax rates (i.e., ``disfavored'' amount) [33]. Laws regarding the\navailability of soda in high school vending machines, school stores,\nobtained from the Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis legal research\ndatabases and verified against secondary sources [34\u00ad36]. Laws\nfor the 3 venues were combined to create one binary indicator of\nwhether the state prohibited soda in all 3 venues. Of the 27 states\nthat were sampled as part of NYPANS, eight banned soda in high\nimplemented the ban prior to 2009\u00ad10. We explored categorizing\nstates based on the length of their ban, but judged that the sample\nsizes were insufficient for such an analysis.\nBoth the state tax rate data and the state laws governing soda\navailability in schools were compiled by the Bridging the Gap\nresearch program at the University of Illinois at Chicago.\nStatistical analysis\nDue to their respective distributions, the 4 dependent variables\nwere analyzed using different types of regression models \u00ad a\nnegative binomial model for total servings of soda in the past 7\ndays, a Poisson model for fast food consumption in the past 7 days,\nand a logistic model for daily soda consumption and lunch source.\nAll analyses accounted for the complex sampling design in\nNYPANS and utilized the `margin' command in Stata, Version\n12, to calculate the average marginal effects (AME) of interest.\nFirst, we estimated the association between vending machine\naccess and each dependent variable. Students with no access to\nschool vending machines were the referent, and thus the\nparameters of interest were hypothesized to be positive (e.g.,\nhigher soda consumption in students with access to school vending\nmachines). These models controlled for race/ethnicity, sex, grade,\nhome food access, state median household income (obtained from\nthe 2010 Census), and Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South,\nWest).\nSubsequently, we added interaction terms between vending\nmachine access and race/ethnicity, sex, grade, home food access,\nweight loss behaviors, disfavored soda tax (when modeling soda),\ndisfavored restaurant tax (when modeling fast food and lunch\nsource), and state law banning soda in all school venues.\nInteraction terms for each variable were modeled separately.\nWhen modeling interactions with variables that were not in the\noriginal model (e.g., soda tax), the main effect of these variables\nwas also added. Weight loss behavior was initially modeled as a 3-\ncategory variable, as described earlier, but we combined 2 of the\ncategories \u00ad students who were trying to lose weight through\nunhealthy behaviors and students who were not trying to lose\nweight \u00ad after analyses revealed that the associations of interest\nwere virtually identical in these 2 groups. When modeling\ninteractions with state taxes and state soda bans, Census region\nwas modeled as a 3-category variable (South/Midwest, Northeast,\nWest) due to the limited distributions of region within categories of\nstate taxes/laws. Home food access was removed from models that\nincluded state soda taxes because it may mediate any effect of taxes\non soda consumption.\nOne state, Colorado, was excluded from all analyses of lunch\nsource because it had an extraordinarily high proportion of\nstudents who obtained lunch away from school or home (42.0%,\nversus 6.1% in the remaining sample) and had unusually high\nleverage as a result.\nResults\nTable 1 displays characteristics of the study sample overall and\nby vending machine access. Nearly all categorical measures had\nsimilar distributions regardless of vending machine access. The\nexception was that students with vending machines were more\nlikely to be from the Midwest (30.0%) and less likely to be from the\nNortheast (11.1%) relative to students without vending machines\nmachines were less likely to be obese but more likely to be\noverweight, and they reported slightly more servings of fast food\nand soda, relative to students with vending machines.\nThe adjusted associations between vending machine access and\nsoda consumption, fast food consumption, and lunch source are\ndisplayed in Table 2. The negative associations indicate that,\ncontrary to the hypothesis, overall soda and fast food consumption\nwere lower among students who had access to vending machines\nin school. Most notably, students were less likely to report\nconsuming at least 1 soda per day if they had access to school\nvending machines (23.9%) compared to those who did not have\naccess (27.9%). Students also reported eating fast food on fewer\ndays per week, on average, if they had access to school vending\nThey were slightly less likely to obtain a lunch away from home or\nschool, but the difference was more modest.\nThe associations represented in Table 2 were consistently\nmodified by state tax rates and, to a lesser degree, state laws\nregarding soda sales in school (Table 3). Results suggested that the\nunexpected negative associations in Table 2 were generally limited\nto students in states with no disfavored taxes \u00ad i.e., states that taxed\nsoda and restaurant food at the same rate as other foods. For\nexample, in states with no disfavored soda tax, vending machine\naccess was associated with 1.14 fewer servings of soda per week\nsmaller as tax rates increased. The implications of this are\ndisplayed in Figure 1. In short, model estimates predict that the\ninverse association between vending machine access and soda\nconsumption is eliminated if the state tax rate for soda exceeded\nthe general food tax rate by 7.25% (the maximum amount in the\nstudy sample.) Similar patterns were observed across all four\noutcomes.\nSimilar patterns were also observed when modeling the\ninteraction between vending machine access and state laws\nbanning soda in all venues. In the lower portion of Table 3, the\n``main effect'' of vending machine access represents the association\nbetween access and the outcomes of interest in states that did not\nban soda; for example, the probability of students drinking soda\nevery day was 6.23 percentage points lower if they had access to\nwithout access, in states with no ban. However, the interaction\nbetween vending machine access and in-school soda ban was of\n11.6), essentially meaning that the inverse association between\nvending machine access and daily consumption was eliminated in\nstates that banned soda. The same pattern was observed for fast\nfood consumption and lunch source \u00ad i.e., the inverse ``main\neffect'' of vending machine access was balanced by the interaction\nState Policies and School Vending Machines\nTable 1.

The exception to this was student weight loss\nbehaviors. There was some evidence that the inverse associations\nnoted in Table 2 were limited to students who were not actively\ntrying to lose weight through healthy behaviors. For example,\nhaving access to vending machines was associated with 1.14 fewer\nservings of soda per week if students were not trying to lose weight\nDiscussion\nThe effectiveness of removing soda and other SSBs from schools\nhas been questioned by some [10,20,26] and advocated by others\n[14,37,38], in part because previous research on policies and in-\nschool SSB access has produced a mixed bag of results [15\u00ad18,20\u00ad\n24]. Our objective was to explore explanations for the discrepan-\ncies by identifying student, environmental, or policy measures that\nFigure 1.

We\nfound evidence that these associations were modified by three\nvariables that each has important policy implications.\nTwo of these variables were other state policies related to soda\nconsumption \u00ad taxes and laws that regulate the sale of soda in\nschool. The unexpected inverse association between vending\nmachine access and soda/fast food consumption was generally\nlimited to states that did not tax soda and restaurant foods,\nrespectively; likewise, the inverse association between vending\nmachine access and daily consumption was limited to states that\ndid not ban the sale of soda in school venues. These results\nunderscore the limitations of isolated changes to the school food\nenvironment. In the absence of any other change, children have\nnumerous sources of soda and other high-fat, high-calorie foods\nand beverages in most middle- and high-income countries [39]. It\nis unrealistic to expect a single target to have a positive impact\nwithin the obesogenic environment to which children are\ncontinuously exposed. This challenge is not unique to school\nnutrition policies or the U.S.; in any country and any domain,\nhealth-related or otherwise, policy resistance often occurs when\npolicies singularly focus on specific targets without considering the\nbroader context [40]. Unintended consequences often occur, and\nour results are an example of individuals possibly overcompensat-\ning for an isolated policy/environmental change and engaging in\nmore unhealthy behavior as a result.\nThis study focused on only one aspect of the school food\nenvironment without considering other changes (e.g., strengthen-\ning school meal standards). This was done intentionally because\nour objective was to identify variables that may explain why some\npolicy initiatives have been less successful than other. At a glance,\nthe results may appear discouraging to those who advocate for\nschool nutrition reform, but results should be interpreted in the\ncontext of existing literature on school nutrition policies. Studies\nthat evaluated more comprehensive policy changes (e.g., those that\nrequired specific limits on nutrition content of competitive foods\nand beverages) found stronger evidence [24,25,41]. The impor-\ntance of comprehensive change was exemplified by evaluations of\nschool nutrition policy changes in Texas, where minor changes to\nthe school food environment initially had little effect on diet\nbecause students compensated [42], but more comprehensive\nchanges later had a positive effect [24]. Furthermore, our study did\nnot analyze how long state policies had been in place, which has\nbeen shown to influence the impact of school-based nutrition\nWe also found evidence of unintended consequences among\nstudents who were not trying to lose weight. Students who were\nnot engaging in healthy weight loss behaviors consumed consid-\nerably more soda and fast food if they did not have access to\nvending machines at school. Students' healthy weight loss\nbehaviors, in themselves, were a strong, consistent predictor of\nsoda and fast food consumption in this study, but this association\nbecame even stronger when vending machines were not available.\nThis raises questions of whether school environmental changes can\ninduce behavioral change among individuals who are not\notherwise motivated to lose weight. With that said, this study did\nnot examine whether environmental changes increased students'\nmotivation to lose weight, and this question should be explored in\nfuture research.\nFuture research should examine the mechanisms through which\nsoda or fast food consumption may increase when school vending\nmachines are not available. It is impossible to ascertain from this\nstudy whether elevated intake of soda and fast food was a direct\nconsequence of not having vending machines. One could\nspeculate that students who desire soda and do not have access\nat school simply leave campus to obtain soda elsewhere. Not only\nwould this overcome the absence of vending machines, but it\nwould also lead students to rely on sources that are available 7 days\nper week (e.g., convenience stores), which could explain why daily\nconsumption was higher when vending machines were not\navailable. If that were the case, it would have important\nimplications for policies that limit students from leaving campus.\nAnother possibility is that schools with vending machines sold\nother SSBs in place of soda, a trend that has been observed\nthroughout the U.S. [19], and this led students to consume less\nsoda by replacing it with other SSBs. These are only two possible\nmechanisms, and longitudinal research is needed to study this\ntopic in greater detail.\nResults should be interpreted cautiously due to other study\nlimitations. Students were not asked which specific beverages were\nbeing sold in vending machines, so it is unknown if those with\naccess could even purchase soda. This is a crucial distinction that\nshould be addressed in future studies. We did not analyze intake of\nother SSBs because it was beyond the scope of this study, but this\nis a critical topic given that adolescents' SSB choices have shifted\nin the U.S. in recent years [6]. We did not analyze weight status\neither because this association may be confounded by many\nfactors, including the possibility that schools are more likely to\nremove vending machines if obesity is highly prevalent. The cross-\nsectional design limited our ability to control for such character-\nistics. Associations may have been biased by unmeasured variables\nsuch as socioeconomic status (SES), a potentially important\ncovariate given the socioeconomic disparities in obesity [43] and\nthe food environment outside of school [26,44,45]. Finally, all\nstudent data were self-reported and may be vulnerable to\nmeasurement error [46], nor did they contain specific measures\nof nutrient intake. The lack of specific nutrient data makes it\ndifficult to assess whether the associations that we observed were of\na sufficient magnitude to have a public health impact. For\nexample, a difference of 0.24 days of fast food, as presented in\nTable 2, may or may not have an important effect on students'\nhealth, depending on the composition of students' fast food\nconsumption.\nConclusions\nSchool nutrition policy research is a rapidly evolving science. As\nthe evidence base continues to grow, it is becoming apparent that\npolicy effects on student intake are partially determined by\ninteractions between policies and the broader environment in\nwhich students live. This study provided another example of where\nsmall-scale changes did not appear to improve students' diet,\nparticularly in the absence of other policies. Research suggests that\ncomprehensive changes can have a positive effect, but small-scale\nchanges may potentially backfire unless complemented with\nnutrition education and other initiatives to improve the nutritional\nquality of other foods and beverages within and outside of school.\nPolicymakers must be cognizant of how minor changes can have\nunintended consequences, and investigators should continue to\nstudy the dynamics between within-school changes and broader\npolicy and environmental measures.\nSupporting Information\nAppendix S1 Interaction between vending machine access and\nstudent weight loss, gender, race/ethnicity, and home food access.\na AME = Average marginal effect; average difference in outcome\nof interest associated with presence of vending machines that sell\nsugar-sweetened beverages in school. b Adjusted for race/\nState Policies and School Vending Machines\nethnicity, sex, grade, state median income, Census region, and\nhome food access.\n"
