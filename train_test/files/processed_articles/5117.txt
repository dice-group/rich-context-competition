In the years following its release, the Community has rapidly garnered\nmainstream media attention and subsequently grown into a multi-million dollar industry.\nInterestingly, many of its most prominent authorities claim to use insights and information\ngleaned through empirical research in evolutionary psychology. Indeed, one of the\nindustry's most well-respected authorities, the illusionist Erik von Markovik (also known\nby his stage name \"Mystery\"), promotes a three-phase model of human courtship, based on\nevolutionary psychology literature as well as his own \"field-tested\" interactions with\nthousands of women.\nThe primary conceptual domains, referred to by Markovik as the \"Mystery\nMethod\", promulgated to represent the various phases of human courtship include\nThe dating mind\nAttraction, building mutual Comfort and Trust, and Seduction (Markovik, 2007). Although\nfirst formally articulated by Markovik in his written work entitled The Mystery Method:\nHow to Get Beautiful Women into Bed (2007), this basic structure of courtship has now\nbeen endorsed and advocated by a steadily growing majority of the Community worldwide.\nHowever, despite the growing success of this industry, few psychologists and social\nscientists have taken a critical look as to whether or not the various concepts and teachings\npromoted by this Community can be substantiated by empirical psychological research.\nAlthough the Community has now expanded considerably into various different methods\nand schools of thought, we have selectively focused here on what we believe to be the most\nimportant and nearly-universal concepts within the industry.\nCommunity Literature on Human Courtship Strategies\nFor the present analysis, we examined several popular works from the Community.\nThe Community consists broadly of heterosexual men who market various tactics,\ntechniques, and methods to meet, date, and ultimately seduce women. Both published\nbooks and online forums offer opportunities to garner and share this information with a\nwide audience of people interested in improving their dating and romantic success.\nTwo main texts were chosen for this analysis. The first text, entitled The Mystery\nMethod: How to Get Beautiful Women into Bed (Markovik, 2007), is widely regarded as\none of the most important works in the Community. The second text, written by\nMarkovik's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and New York Times columnist Neil Strauss, also known on online\nforums as Style, is entitled Rules of the Game (Strauss, 2009). The two texts were selected\nmainly for the authors' prominence and popularity in the Community. Both authors have\nappeared on several cable television programs and interviews.\nMarkovik gained increased public eminence after the cable television station VH1\naired the program The Pickup Artist, starring himself, intended to showcase his methods to\na worldwide audience. Markovik (2007) situates his teachings within a Darwinian\nframework, arguing his \"science of social dynamics\" is firmly grounded in evolutionary\npsychology research, as well as the distilled first-hand experience garnered from \"field-\ntested\" interactions with thousands of women in bars, nightclubs and other public\ngatherings. In the preface to the text, Markovik (2007, p. xiii) ostensibly draws from\nDarwinian theory with the declaration, \"Nature will unapologetically weed your genes out\nof existence if you don't take action and learn how to attract women now\". Elsewhere in the\ntext, Markovik (2007, p. 15) highlights the adaptive discrepancy between the modern\nenvironment and the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptiveness (Tooby and Cosmides,\n1990) noting that, \"while unimaginably sophisticated and complicated, [we] are\nnonetheless an out-of-date model. Put simply, nature has not designed [us] for the world in\nwhich [we] live\".\nParental Investment Theory and Conflict between the Sexes\nThe general starting point for much of the Community's literature, whether\nexplicitly stated or not, often begins with Trivers' (1972) theory of parental investment.\nThe dating mind\nAccording to Trivers' (1972), the sex with higher parental investment (i.e., time and energy\nspent in gestation and rearing offspring) will be choosier with respect to mate selection. As\na consequence, women very rarely accept propositions for casual sex with strangers\n(Voracek, Hofhansl and Fisher, 2005), typically imposing a much more careful and\nrigorous screening process before consenting to sexual activity (Grammer, 1989;\nPawlowski and Dunbar, 1999; Pawlowski and Dunbar, 2001). On the other hand, human\nmales as the biologically less investing sex, often have little to lose by mating with as many\nfemales as possible (Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Indeed, Schmitt et al. (2001) have shown\nthat men desire more lifetime sex partners, seek sexual intercourse sooner, and are\nfrequently more motivated to seek casual sex than are women.\nIn the absence of a clear understanding of the biological bases of such differences,\nthe courtship process and ensuing relationship dynamics can often appear confusing,\nfrustrating and even debilitating. Such conflicts of interest in men and women's sexual\nstrategies (Buss and Schmitt, 1993), often coined \"the war of the sexes\", can be a\nsignificant cause of conflict and ultimately failure to find and maintain a lasting long-term\nrelationship. However, as we will argue, this conflict is not inevitable. The knowledge of\nour evolved sexual strategies gives us significant capability to improve interactions\nbetween the sexes by choosing appropriate actions and deactivating others \u00ad ultimately\nreducing conflict between men and women. In this respect, we argue that when properly\nand ethically understood, the dating and seduction industry, despite its provocative label\nand origins outside of academia, is founded on solid empirical research as well as first-hand\ncourtship and relationship experience. Ultimately, it is our suggestion that an informed\nappraisal of this information will ultimately help to lessen conflict and improve dating and\nrelationships between men and women.\nThe Three Phases of Human Courtship: Attraction, Comfort and Trust, and\nSeduction\nAttraction\nThe first reputed phase of human courtship, Attraction, is primarily concerned with\ncreating opportunities to exploit evolved cues for what women generally find attractive in\nmen. As defined by social psychologists, attraction is typically described as an individual's\npositive evaluation of another person and the desire to initiate contact or establish physical\nintimacy with them (Finkel and Baumeister, 2010). The Community generally concurs with\nthis definition, while further dividing the beginning courtship stage of Attraction into two\ndifferent types of conversational starters with an unacquainted romantic interest: direct and\nindirect conversational openers (Strauss, 2009). Direct conversational openers typically\nbegin with a very bold and straightforward proclamation, directly to one's prospective\nromantic interest. For instance, a typical example of this type of opener might be: Hi, I saw\nyou standing there, thought you looked attractive, and wanted to say hello. While\napparently awkward or unimpressive to the inexperienced, many Community enthusiasts\nwill swear by the ability of this approach to generate instant attraction in a prospective\nromantic interest. And indeed, there may in fact be psychological research to legitimate this\nclaim. For instance, research has shown that expressions of social dominance (Sadalla et al.\nThe dating mind\ncourageousness (Farthing, 2005; Kelly and Dunbar, 2001) are often attractive to women (as\nsuch an approach would clearly seem to demonstrate).\nThe second type of conversation starter, referred to as an indirect conversational\nopener, often begins with an off-handed opinion or question, at first merely designed to\ncapture attention. For example, indirect openers often include apparently random queries\nsuch as, Excuse me- a friend and I were debating something. Could I have a female opinion\non how a man should treat a lady on a first date? (Markovik, 2007; Strauss, 2009). In stark\ncontrast to a direct opener, the specific content of an indirect opener is often irrelevant; the\nmore important objective is often to smoothly get a conversation started. However, once a\nconversation is underway, enthusiasts of indirect openers will often casually move into\nmore intentional conversational material specifically designed to display attractive cues to a\nprospective romantic interest. For instance, the conversational content at this point\ngenerally moves into interesting personality conveying material, such as humor, an exciting\npersonal anecdote, a fun game, or even a simple piece of stage magic, intended to solicit\nattraction from a prospective romantic interest (Markovik, 2007; Strauss, 2009). Markovik\n(2007) describes the advertisement of such qualities as \"Demonstrations of Higher Value\"\n(DHVs), which it is claimed, cause an increase in mate value and create attraction, thus\nproviding the person access to more desirable mates. And indeed, psychological research\nhas shown that many of these qualities, when well-presented, can often be quite attractive\nto the opposite sex.\nFor example, in a recent sample of UK personal advertisements, women rated\ncharming social skills, wittiness, and a good sense of humor as among the most desirable\ntraits in a prospective date (Pawlowski and Dunbar, 1999; Pawlowski and Dunbar, 2001),\nwhich would seem to reinforce the claims made by the community (Markovik, 2007;\nStrauss, 2009). Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of humor in mate\ngood sense of humor considered universally appealing. Humor has been further argued to\nbe an honest signal of other cognitive abilities, such as intelligence (Howrigan and\nMacDonald, 2008) and therefore an indicator of higher mate value (Greengross and Miller,\nPsychological research has supported the importance of advertising other aspects of\npersonality toward mate attraction. For example, in a study of 37 cultures around the world,\nBuss (1989) and his collaborators found qualities such as having an exciting personality,\nintelligence, adaptability, and creativity as among the top ten most desirable traits for both\nmen and women. Bale, Morrison, and Caryl (2006) has further shown that \"pick up\" lines\nthat demonstrate qualities such as helpfulness, generosity, cosmopolitanism and wealth are\nsignificantly more attractive than straightforward propositions for sexual activity. In sum,\nas the Community maintains, these qualities are often best-presented with the right \"pick\nup\" line, interesting story or personal anecdote, game, magic, or various other types of\nThe Community further advocates a peculiar strategy known as \"pre-selection\"\nwhich is claimed to be often useful in crowded social gatherings (Markovik, 2007). Pre-\nselection is a strategy whereby a man in a public gathering will establish an innocent\nThe dating mind\nacquaintanceship with an attractive woman, gaining her trust, comfort, and friendship, only\nto later use her presence by his side to attract other surrounding women that are actually the\nintended object of his desire (Markovik, 2007). The phenomenon where females will copy\nor imitate the preferences of other females for a particular male mate has been documented\nin a wide variety of species, and is commonly referred to by evolutionary biologists as mate\nchoice copying (Bennett, Lim and Gilbert, 2008; Dugatkin, 1992; Freed-Brown and White,\n2009). Moreover, there is now increasing evidence to suggest that such strategies, whether\nintentionally practiced or consistently understood by those using them, are also found in\nhumans (Eva and Wood, 2006; Hill and Buss, 2008; Place, Todd, Penke and Asendorpf,\n2010). For instance, Place et al. (2010) found an increase in male attractiveness among\nwomen who observed mutually interested romantic couples, while Jones, DeBruine, Little,\nBurriss, and Feinberg (2007) found a similar effect if other women were observed smiling\nat male faces; a reverse effect was found for unsmiling faces (Jones et al. 2007) or\nuninterested romantic couples (Place et al., 2007). Markovik (2007) also suggests, in order\nto amplify this attraction cue still further, to bring and surround yourself with female\nfriends (known as \"pivots\") to social gatherings, wear female perfume, or have a\n(occasionally staged) lipstick kiss on your neck or cheek.\nComfort and Trust\nThe second reputed phase of human courtship, building mutual Comfort and Trust,\nfurther seems to have a significant degree of support by various psychological research\nstudies. Firstly, once Attraction has been established, community literature advocates the\nimportance of taking the time to build rapport, comfort and trust before proceeding with\nseduction (Markovik, 2007; Strauss, 2009). Indeed, psychological research has shown that\nmany particular moral virtues are not only sexually attractive, but also relationship-\nstabilizing (see Miller 2007, for a review). For example, many studies have demonstrated\nthe importance of honesty, niceness, agreeableness and nonviolence (Boon and McLeod,\nKilman, 2003), both in the early stages of a romantic encounter for soliciting Attraction, as\nwell as later in the sequence of courtship for establishing Comfort and Trust. Still further,\nas an acquaintanceship develops, empathy, fondness, forgivingness, trust, perspective-\ntaking, and kindness (Kilpatrick, Bissonnette, and Rusbult, 2002; Fincham, Beach, and\nDavila, 2004), , defined as emotional responsiveness to the needs of others (Jensen-\nCampbell, Graziano, and West, 1995; Li, Kenrick, Bailey, and Linsenmeier, 2002), have\nbeen shown to be critical for both establishing and maintaining an intimate relationship.\nTrust and comfort is often further established through the use of kinesthetic touch,\nor what the Community often refers to simply as \"kino\" (Markovik, 2007; Strauss, 2009).\nFor instance, from a study of courtship behavior in singles' bars, Moore (1985) found that\nincidental touching, prolonged eye contact, swaying the upper body towards a prospective\nromantic interest while talking, and a number of other tactical devices designed to attract\nattention were frequently implemented. Moreover, many community enthusiasts will\npractice and encourage the use of touch throughout the courtship process, evidently aware\nof its critical role in courtship and seduction (Markovik, 2007; Strauss, 2009). Touch has\nbeen found to be a diverse, adaptable and nontrivial modality, in that it can consistently\nThe dating mind\ncommunicate complex emotions such as happiness, surprise, gratitude, sympathy, and even\nlove among both opposite sex strangers and established couples (Thompson and Hampton,\nThe role of touch has also been argued to have an adaptive function in bonding,\nboth in human and non-human primates, involving complex psychopharmacological\nchemicals including oxytocin, endorphins, dopamine, and various other neuropeptides\n(Dunbar, 2010). Moreover, recent research has documented the ability of touch and bodily\naffection to increase feelings of trust and comfort, in that increased oxytocin levels and\ndecreased blood pressure are often found among couples with more frequent hugging\n(Light, Grewen, and Amico, 2005). Indeed, the hormone oxytocin has been shown to\npromote pro-social feelings of bonding and trust (Huber, Veinante, and Stoop, 2005;\nKosfeld et al., 2005), and put individuals at ease in social situations (Haxby, Hoffman, and\nSeduction\nThe final reputed phase of human courtship, Seduction, begins once mutual\nAttraction and Comfort and Trust have been established between two individuals. For\ninstance, women typically require more time and intimacy to develop the same amount of\npassion as men (Baumeister and Bratslavsky, 1999). Consistent with psychological\nresearch, the Community often advocates what is known at the \"seven-hour rule\"; the idea\nbeing that a woman typically needs a minimum of seven cumulative hours of rapport-\nbuilding in order to develop a strong emotional and intellectual connection (including\nshared interests, shared values, and a deep inter-subjective understanding) before\nconsenting to sexual activity (Markovik, 2007; Strauss, 2009). In order to accomplish this\nobjective, the community encourages a process of mutual self-disclosure, whereby each\ngets to know the other person on a very deep and intimate level (Markovik, 2007; Strauss,\n2009), reinforcing psychological research on the development of relationships (Collins and\nIn similar fashion, social psychologists have argued that, according to the self-\nexpansion model of motivation and cognition, people seek to expand and enhance the\nidentity of the self through close and intimate relationships (Aron, Aron and Norman,\n2003). More specifically, participants in close intimate relationships \"include each other in\ntheir selves in the sense that other's perspectives, resources, and identities are to some\nextent one's own\" (Aron, Aron and Norman, 2003, p. 490). In other words, the subjective\nfeeling of love that often, but granted not always, precedes intimate gestures of affection\nand sexual activity, may require further conversational exchanges and deeper rapport\nbuilding, as community devotees will maintain (Markovik, 2007; Strauss, 2009). Of course,\njust as touch and physical affection are important during the Comfort and Trust phase of\ncourtship, during the later stages of Seduction, both become increasingly more important\nfor solidifying the connection between two people, as well as escalating sexual activity. As\nsuch, physiological research has demonstrated that the bonding and trust hormone\noxytocin, which has been shown to increase in both men and women following sexual\narousal (Blaicher et al., 1999; Carmichael et al., 1987), and in the later stages of courtship,\nmay be integral to relationship maintenance and development (Bartz and Hollander, 2006).\nThe dating mind\nFuture Directions and Ethical Implications\nIn conclusion, it would seem clear that there is in fact a substantive degree of\npsychological research to support many claims made by the Community. The three reputed\nphases of courtship, Attraction, building mutual Comfort and Trust, and Seduction, are\nsupported by a significant and steadily growing literature based in physiological, social and\nevolutionary psychology research. Men and women have evolved opposing sexual\nstrategies, often leading to a conflict of interests, creating significant discord and confusion\nwith respect to mate selection (Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Given the frustration and\nconfusion many singles currently experience in the dating marketplace, this knowledge\ncould be an important aid to couples reducing conflict, frustration and finding fulfilling\nrelationships.\nIn light of these findings, it is equally important to note that many of the strategies\nadvocated by the community are not currently supported by peer-reviewed literature. For\nexample, one particular strategy known as \"peacocking,\" (in dubious reference to Zahavi's\n(1975) handicap principle) involves wearing very ostentatious clothing specifically\ndesigned to exploit evolved cues for what women find attractive (Markovik, 2007).\nAlthough research has shown that women generally find social status attractive in men\n(Buss, 1989; Pawlowski and Dunbar, 2001), thus far there is no direct evidence in support\nof this particular behavior. A similar strategy, known as \"negging\", has been claimed to\nincrease a male's attractiveness by demonstrating he has high standards (Markovik, 2007).\nFor example, a male might exclaim, Wow, those are great fingernails! Are they real? Oh,\nno? Well, they still look nice. Consistent with this argument, Eastwick, Finkel, Mochon,\nand Ariely (2007) have shown that men who appear to have high standards are considered\nmore attractive than males who do not; nevertheless, there is currently no direct evidence\nthat \"negging\" is universally effective. An important area for future research would be to\nmore closely analyze a broader spectrum of community literature and determine the\nscientific veracity of unsubstantiated claims.\nMoreover, there may be important unrecognized ethical implications from using\nportions of this material. For instance, it has been argued that the initiation of touch or\n\"kino\" throughout the courtship process and alleged prioritization of physical over verbal\nconsent may at times problematize interpretations of consent (Denes, 2011). To this end,\nwe do contend that such material has the potential for abuse and urge caution with the use\nof the Community's material, especially in the context of short-term relationships where\nsexual activity may be the sole objective. On the other hand, within the context of helping\npeople to initiate long-term, stable relationships, we argue that informed male behaviors are\nnot so unlike women attempting to manipulate perceived attractiveness through the use of\nperfume, cosmetics, clothing, liposuction and cosmetic surgery, and thus disrupt normal\nmate choice by men (Roberts, Miner and Shackelford, 2010). Therefore, if such practices\nallow men to approach, attract, and connect with women in similar fashion, we\nwholeheartedly endorse the ethical practice of such materials for establishing meaningful\nlong-term relationships.\nThe dating mind\n"
