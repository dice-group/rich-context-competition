Our objective was to determine factors\nassociated with self-reported health status in a national population-based sample with radiographic knee OA.\nMethods. Our sample included all of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES-III)\nparticipants who underwent a knee radiograph and were found to have radiographic OA (defined as Kellgren/Lawrence\ngrade 2 or higher). Self-reported health status was determined by asking the participant to rate their overall health as\nexcellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. Self-reported health status was analyzed as an ordinal variable using cumulative\nlogit regression, as a dichotomous variable (excellent/very good/good versus fair/poor) using logistic regression, and as a\ncontinuous variable after transformation using linear regression.\nResults. A total of 1,021 (42%) of NHANES-III participants with a knee radiograph were included in this analysis. The\nmultivariable analyses were performed on 1,009 (99%) of the eligible participants with complete data. We found that\nnonwhite race, lower income, more comorbidities, and greater functional limitation were associated with worse self-\nreported health status in all 3 multivariable analyses.\nConclusion. This study has quantified the role of clinical, radiographic, and socioeconomic factors associated with\nself-reported health status in a population-based sample of patients with knee OA. Self-reported health status in patients\nwith knee OA was associated with functional status and comorbidity.\nINTRODUCTION\nKnee osteoarthritis (OA) is painful, disabling, and costly,\nand diminishes a person's health status dramatically. Over\n10 million people in the US have knee OA (1) and OA of\nthe knee is one of the 5 leading causes of disability among\nthe elderly (2).\nHealth status is a multidimensional domain comprising\nbiologic, physical, and emotional functioning (3,4). Self-\nreported health status is a measure of how one perceives\nand reports one's own well-being. For example, partici-\npants may rate their health as excellent, very good, good,\nfair, or poor. This sort of self-reported information pro-\nvides an important indicator of a person's health status (4).\nA variety of methods have been proposed to express self-\nreported health status (5). One method is to classify the\nresponses into 2 groups (excellent, very good, or good\nversus fair or poor) (5). Another method is to analyze the\nresponses as an ordinal variable (5). Lastly, a particularly\ntransparent approach is to express self-reported health\nstatus on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 corresponds to the\nworst possible health and 1 corresponds to perfect health.\nSuch scales are easy to interpret, and the unitless 0 to 1\nresponse scale permits comparisons across medical condi-\ntions (3).\nMany studies have documented the effect of knee OA, as\nwell as other specific conditions, on the self-reported\nhealth status of patients' lives (6,7). Few studies, however,\nSupported by the National Institute of Arthritis and Mus-\nculoskeletal and Skin Diseases of the NIH (grants R01-\nwork was supported by an Innovative Research grant from\nthe Arthritis Foundation.\n1William M.

For\nexample, the Beaver Dam Health Outcomes Study exam-\nined the influence of dozens of conditions on self-reported\nhealth status, but only controlled for age. The study did\nnot examine the contribution of comorbidities, the severity\nof disease symptoms, or other patient characteristics on\nself-reported health status (6). Another study, conducted\namong subjects enrolled in Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical\nAssistance Contract for the Elderly (PACE), examined the\neffect of OA and rheumatoid arthritis on self-reported\nhealth status compared with no arthritis. This study con-\ntrolled for important factors, including age, sex, race, in-\ncome, and comorbidities. However, the diagnosis was not\nspecific to knees, and radiographs were not used to deter-\nmine the presence of OA (7).\nOur objective was to determine the factors associated\nwith self-reported health status in a national population-\nbased sample of persons with radiographic knee OA. We\nchose participants affected by radiographic knee OA so\nthat we could examine the impact of symptomatic OA on\na person's self-reported health status. We used data from\nthe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey (NHANES-III), which is the most recent NHANES to\nperform radiographs of the knee, in order to identify fac-\ntors that correlate with self-reported health status in indi-\nviduals in a population-based sample with radiographic\nknee OA.\nSample. The NHANES-III is a national population-\nNational Centers for Health Statistics of the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. The survey was con-\ndata were collected during a household interview. All\nparticipants were then asked to schedule an appointment\nat a medical examination center where additional data\nwould be collected. Additional details about patient re-\ncruitment and selection for the NHANES-III survey have\nbeen previously described (8).\nRadiographic assessment. The knee radiographs were\nperformed using a non\u00adweight-bearing anteroposterior ap-\nproach according to the NHANES-III protocol (9). Radio-\ngraphs were performed on both knees of all participants\nage and could transfer themselves to the radiograph table\nunder their own power. Severity of radiographic knee OA\nwas defined by Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grade, where 0 \nno knee OA, 1  a questionable osteophyte (doubtful knee\nOA), 2  a definite osteophyte but no joint space narrow-\ning (mild knee OA), 3  moderate narrowing of the joint\nspace (moderate knee OA), and 4  severe narrowing of\nthe joint space (severe knee OA) (10). K/L grades were\ncomputed for each knee by a trained radiologist. For our\nanalysis we used the greater of the right and left K/L\ngrades, and we defined radiographic knee OA as having a\nK/L grade of 2. This definition served as the inclusion\ncriterion for this analysis.\nOutcome: self-reported health status. Self-reported\nhealth status was determined by asking the participant to\nrate their overall health as excellent, very good, good, fair,\nor poor. Self-reported health status was analyzed using 3\ntechniques. First, self-reported health status was dichoto-\nmized as excellent, very good, or good versus fair or poor.\nNext, we considered self-reported health as an ordinal\nvariable. Finally, we assigned each possible response a\nrating. To address the issue of transforming ordinal vari-\nables into a rating scale using equal-length intervals, we\nused the rating scale proposed by Diehr and colleagues\nsigned to the 5 possible responses, respectively (11). The\nrating scale was then transformed to an estimate of stan-\ndard gamble utilities (0 to 1, representing the worst to the\nbest possible health) using the power transformation sug-\ngested by Torrance and colleagues to create a continuous\nself-reported health status score, which is often called a\nutility score in economic evaluations (12).\nCorrelates of self-reported health status. Sociodemo-\ngraphic characteristics. Sociodemographic factors such as\nage, sex, race/ethnicity, and income were hypothesized to\nbe associated with self-reported health status. Age was\nRace/ethnicity was classified into 3 categories: Hispanic,\nnon-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic white. Income was\nadded so that participants who did not report their income\ncould be included in the multivariable regression models.\nComorbidities. The NHANES-III included several\nclosed-ended questions about the participant's medical\nproblems at the time of the survey or in the past. A comor-\nbidity index was computed by counting the total number\nof self-reported medical problems. These medical prob-\nlems included asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema,\ncongestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, el-\nevated cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer\n(including skin cancer), fractures of the hip, wrist, or\nspine, gout, lupus, osteoporosis, back pain most days for\n1 month, goiter, urinary tract infection, pneumonia in\nthe last 12 months, blindness, cataracts, and thyroid dis-\nease. We then categorized the total number of comorbidi-\nties into 3 levels: 0\u00ad1 comorbidities, 2\u00ad3 comorbidities,\nand 4 comorbidities. Obesity status was considered as a\nseparate factor and was defined as nonobese (body mass\nmissing (13). The missing category for obesity status was\nadded so that participants with missing BMI values could\nbe included in the multivariable regression model.\nRadiographic severity, knee pain, and functional limita-\ntion. Severity of radiographic knee OA was classified us-\ning K/L grades. We analyzed K/L grade as a categorical\nvariable (grades 2, 3, and 4). Knee pain was defined as\nhaving knee pain on most days for at least 6 weeks. A\nSelf-Reported Health Status in a Population With Knee OA 1047\ncomposite functional limitation index was defined from 2\nquestions in the household interview: difficulty walking a\nquarter of a mile, and difficulty stooping, crouching, or\nkneeling. The participants were assumed to have reported\nzero limitations if they answered \"No\" to both questions, 1\nlimitation if they answered \"Yes\" to one of the questions,\nand 2 limitations if they answered \"Yes\" to both questions.\nWe performed internal validation of the index by examin-\ning its association with radiographic severity and the use\nof a walking aid, such as a cane or walker.\nStatistical analysis. The interview and examination\ndata sets were merged to produce a single data set that\ncontained all of the relevant information. Three analyses\nwere performed, one for each of the 3 techniques of exam-\nining the outcome of self-reported health status.\nFor self-reported health status as a dichotomous vari-\nable, multivariable logistic regression was performed on\nour dichotomous outcome to obtain odds ratios (ORs) of\nbeing in fair or poor health.\nFor self-reported health status as an ordinal variable,\nmultivariable cumulative logit regression was performed\non our ordinal outcome to obtain cumulative ORs. Cumu-\nlative ORs that were 1 were more indicative of worse\nself-reported health status.\nFor self-reported health status as a continuous variable,\nwe used 2-sample independent t-tests and one-way analy-\nsis of variance to compare unadjusted mean estimates of\nour self-reported health status score for our hypothesized\ncorrelates. We employed multivariable linear regression to\nobtain adjusted mean estimates of the self-reported health\nstatus score. Scheffe's procedure was used to adjust for\nmultiple comparisons where appropriate (14).\nWe tested for interactions to identify specific subgroups\nthat reported a worse self-reported health status for all 3\nvariants of the outcome. The interaction between radio-\ngraphic severity and knee pain was of particular interest,\nbut we also examined interactions involving functional\nlimitation with comorbidity, comorbidity with obesity,\nand sex with radiographic severity, comorbidity, and obe-\nsity. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SAS statisti-\ncal software, version 9.1 (SAS, Cary, NC).\nWe employed survey regression methods as a sensitivity\nanalysis to take into account the survey design. We did not\nuse the sampling weights in this analysis because the\nvariables used to determine the weights (age, sex, and\nrace/ethnicity) were also predictors of interest (15). The\nmethods used in our data analyses were consistent with a\nmore detailed discussion of the use of sampling weights\nfor the NHANES analyses (15,16). The results that took\ninto account the possible correlations between individuals\nwithin primary sampling units and strata were analogous\nto the standard multiple linear regression and are not\npresented here because the results would be redundant.\nRESULTS\nStudy sample.

Although we\nfound clear evidence that a greater number of comorbidi-\nties and a higher degree of functional limitation were\nassociated with worse self-reported health status, neither\nradiographic severity of OA nor knee pain influenced self-\nreported health status in analyses that adjusted for func-\ntional status. Furthermore, we did not find evidence of\nmodification of the effect of knee pain on self-reported\nhealth status by K/L grade. That is, although radiographs\nprovide the most widely acknowledged indicator of OA\nseverity, this parameter did not appear to influence self-\nTable 2.

Although the fact\nthat we found an association between functional limita-\ntion and self-reported health status was not surprising, the\nmagnitude of the decrement in self-reported health status\nfor those with 2 functional limitations was quite striking.\nAdditionally, we found that demographic and socioeco-\nnomic factors including nonwhite race and lower income\nwere also associated with lower self-reported health status\nin all 3 multivariable regression models.\nObese participants had, on average, lower self-reported\nhealth status scores than nonobese participants in the un-\ntionship was not seen when the other factors in the model\nwere adjusted for (P  0.35).

Finally, we\nexamined interactions involving functional limitation, knee\npain, radiographic severity, obesity, comorbidity, and sex,\nbut we were unable to find any that further explained the\nvariability in self-reported health status.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are no prior studies\nevaluating correlates of self-reported health status in a\npopulation-based sample of individuals with evidence of\nradiographic knee OA. The Beaver Dam Health Outcomes\nStudy derived age-adjusted mean estimates of a true health\nutility using the time trade-off technique in patients with\narthritis, but not specifically radiographic knee OA (6). In\ntheir age-adjusted analysis, which adjusted for the mean\nage of 64.1 years in their sample, they found that partici-\npants with arthritis had a health utility of 0.82 (95% CI\nmean self-reported health status score (0.81) that we de-\nscribed in this report, even though the mean age in our\nsample was 73 years. This is due to the fact that age was\nnot associated with self-reported health status in 2 of our\nanalyses. The association seen between age and our ordi-\nnal self-reported health status outcome is likely due to a\nhealthy survivor effect because patients age 80 years\nwere more likely to report being in better health than those\nwho were between the ages of 60\u00ad65 years. The advantage\nof our study is that it provides more detailed information\nabout factors that are associated with self-reported health\nstatus in patients with knee OA, which allows further\ndiscrimination of self-reported health status among per-\nsons with knee OA.\nOur results are consistent with other studies that exam-\nined the impact of race and income on self-reported health\nstatus (7,17\u00ad19). The study using subjects enrolled in\nPennsylvania's PACE demonstrated findings similar to\nwhat we found with regard to race, income, and comor-\nbidities, but not age. The authors analyzed the general\nhealth status question as a dichotomous variable (excel-\nlent, very good, or good versus fair or poor) as well (7).\nSubjects age 85 years were more likely to respond as\nhaving fair or poor health than those between the ages of\n65\u00ad74 years, but they were less likely to respond as having\nfair or poor health than those between the ages of 75\u00ad84\nyears (7). The authors also found that nonwhite race, lower\nincome, and more comorbidities were associated with\nworse self-reported health status (7), which is concordant\nwith our results. However, our sample is a national sam-\nple, whereas PACE is restricted to residents in Pennsylva-\nnia. Also, our additional use of a continuous measure\nallows for further discrimination and estimates that can be\nused in economic evaluations.\nThere are several limitations to our study, including that\nthe estimates provided in this manuscript are not popula-\ntion-based estimates. One is that NHANES-III used non\u00ad\nweight-bearing knee radiographs. This may lead to under-\nestimation of the presence and severity of radiographic\nknee OA (20), and could potentially reduce the influence\nof radiographic severity on self-reported health status.\nAlso, patellofemoral OA is not assessed formally in the\nK/L grading system. Since patellofemoral OA may be quite\npainful, this may adversely influence self-reported health\nstatus. We acknowledge that the cumulative logit regres-\nsion model may not meet the proportional odds assump-\ntion in this case. However, because the test for proportion-\nality of odds can be overly sensitive in the presence of\nlarge samples, we used it as a secondary analysis that\nconfirmed many of the same relationships as ordinary\nlogistic regression.\nAnother limitation of this study is that we were not able\nto determine causality or observe how self-reported health\nstatus changes over time due to the cross-sectional design\nof the study. As with any observational study, we ac-\nknowledge the possibility of not accounting for other con-\nfounders, which may explain additional variability in self-\nreported health status. This includes OA in other joints,\nwhich were not formally ascertained in NHANES-III. It\nwould be important to study the effect of changes in dis-\nease severity, symptoms, and comorbidities on changes in\nself-reported health status over time. We recognize that\nestimating the effect of missing obesity status and income\non self-reported health status may lead to biased estimates\nwith respect to these 2 variables if the data is not missing\ncompletely at random. We acknowledge that our continu-\nous outcome (the transformed rating scale) is an estimate\nand not a directly elicited standard gamble utility (12).\nFurther research should be done in samples in which\nutilities would be elicited using direct assessment. Lastly,\nwe recognize that the various comorbidities included in\nour summative index may not be equal contributions to\none's self-reported health status. However, creating a sin-\ngle comorbidity index with equal weights seemed to pro-\nvide adequate adjustment in our model while accounting\nfor the fact that each comorbidity was relatively rare. This\nsimplification, which has been done in other studies look-\ning at the impact of comorbidity on self-reported health\nstatus (4), would result in a conservative bias, making it\nmore difficult to detect the influence of comorbidities on\nself-reported health status.\nWe found that more comorbidities, a higher degree of\nfunctional limitation, nonwhite race, and lower income\nwere associated with a worse self-reported health status in\nFigure 2. Adjusted mean estimates of self-reported health status\nscores stratified by comorbidities and functional limitation. The\nerror bars represent 95% confidence intervals for the adjusted\nmean, and the width is adjusted using Scheffe's procedure.\nthis sample of participants with radiographic knee OA.\nThese results point to subpopulations of patients with\nknee OA at risk for experiencing worse health. From a\nclinical point of view, health-enhancing interventions\ncould be aimed especially at these subpopulations. From a\nresearch standpoint, these patient characteristics should\nbe noted as potential confounders in studies of self-\nreported health status in knee OA. Further research needs\nto be done to evaluate how self-reported health status\nchanges in patients as their disease severity and symptoms\nprogress or recede.\nAll authors were involved in drafting the article or revising it\ncritically for important intellectual content, and all authors ap-\nproved the final version to be submitted for publication.
