    "abstract": "Abstract\nSeveral individual differences including age have been suggested to affect the perception of slant.\nA cross-sectional study of outdoor hill estimation (N \u00bc 106) was analyzed using individual\ndifference measures of age, experiential knowledge, fitness, personality traits, and sex. Of\nparticular note, it was found that for participants who reported any experiential knowledge\nabout slant, estimates decreased (i.e., became more accurate) as conscientiousness increased,\nsuggesting that more conscientious individuals were more deliberate about taking their\nexperiential knowledge (rather than perception) into account. Effects of fitness were limited to\nthose without experiential knowledge, suggesting that they, too, may be cognitive rather than\nperceptual. The observed effects of age, which tended to produce lower, more accurate estimates\nof hill slant, provide more evidence that older adults do not see hills as steeper. The main effect of\nage was to lower slant estimates; such effects may be due to implicit experiential knowledge\nacquired over a lifetime. The results indicate the impact of cognitive, rather than perceptual\nfactors on individual differences in slant estimation.\n",

Very large distortions are evident in the conscious perception of slant (Kammann,\nFlint, 2011).

A preponderance of evidence now suggests that haptic\nperception of slant is just as exaggerated as visual perception (Durgin, Hajnal et al., 2010;\nDurgin & Li, 2012; Hajnal, Abdul-Malak, & Durgin, 2011). Systematic measurement biases\nsuch as anchoring (Feresin, Agostini, & Negrin-Salviolo, 1998; Shaffer, McManama, &\nDurgin, 2015; Shaffer, McManama, Swank, Williams & Durgin, 2014), postural effects (Li\n& Durgin, 2011), and reference frame bias (Coleman & Durgin, 2014) may all contribute to\nthe cognitive illusion that manual measures (e.g., palm boards) tap into an accurate\nrepresentation of hill slant (Durgin, Hajnal et al., 2010). In general, it appears possible that\nbecause action is calibrated to perception, stable distortions in perception can effectively\nsupport the control of action without requiring accuracy (e.g., Durgin, 2009, 2014). The\nexaggeration of perceived slant relative to horizontal may therefore be an adaptive coding\nstrategy that is useful even in the control of action (Durgin, 2009; Durgin & Li, in press).\nSome of the most puzzling results concerning slant perception are the individual\ndifferences that have been reported based on sex (Proffitt et al., 1995) and age (Bhalla &\nProffitt, 1999). In many studies, it has been found that slant estimates of hills are higher for\nfemale participants than for male participants, but it has not been clear whether this reflects a\n(perceptual) gender difference in how hills actually appear, or if it reflects a (cognitive) gender\ndifference in the cognitive transformation of perceptual experience into a spatial or numeric\nresponse. Second, the claim has been advanced that hills appear steeper to older adults\n(Bhalla & Proffitt, 1999). However, the data originally reported in support of this claim\nappear to better support the idea that older adults give lower (i.e., more accurate)\nestimates of hill slant (perhaps because of greater life experience; see Durgin, Hajnal et al.,\n2010, for a review): Bhalla and Proffitt's older participants only gave relatively high estimates\nfor a couple of very steep hills for which no direct comparison data were available from\nyounger participants, whereas for hills of 4 to 10 (which include fairly challenging, but\nwalkable slopes), the data of Bhalla and Proffitt (1999; Table 2) consistently show that older\nadults gave lower, more accurate, estimates than did younger participants. Recent data for\nsmall, near surfaces have also suggested that slant estimates given by older participants are\nalso lower and more accurate than the estimates given by younger participants (Norman,\nCrabtree, Bartholomew, & Ferrell, 2009).\nOne of the concerns that has complicated the interpretation of individual differences in\nslant perception is that the results of estimation tasks can be biased by subtle or not-so-subtle\ninstructional manipulations (see Durgin et al., 2009; Durgin, Hajnal et al., 2010). For\nexample, the data from older adults reported by Bhalla and Proffitt (1999) were collected\nin a very different experimental design than the ``normative'' data to which it was compared.\nMoreover, they were preceded by instructions that might be said to invoke stereotype threat\n(Steele & Aronson, 1995) or experimental demand (Durgin et al., 2009). That is, older\nparticipants were first asked how hard the hill would be to climb for someone of their age\nand physical ability. This initial question might well have affected older adults' subsequent\nestimates (e.g., Woods, Philbeck, & Danoff, 2009) for very steep hills. The younger\nparticipants in the normative study (Proffitt et al., 1995) to which Bhalla and Proffitt's\ndata from older adults were compared had not been asked any such (potentially biasing)\nquestion before making their estimates, so any comparison of the two sets of data ought to be\ndone with caution.\n2 i-Perception\nSimilarly, studies involving fitness, fatigue, or burden manipulations (Bhalla & Proffitt,\n1999) may also tap into individual differences in combination with biases introduced by\nexperimental demand. Durgin et al. (2009) and Durgin, Klein, Spiegel, Strawser, and\nWilliams (2012) found that most participants asked to wear a heavy backpack during a\nperception experiment assumed the backpack was intended to affect the slant estimates they\nwere asked to make while wearing the backpack. Participants asked to do strenuous exercise in\nadvance of making slant estimates (e.g., Bhalla & Proffitt, 1999; Proffitt et al., 1995) probably\ndraw similar inferences about the experimenter's intent. Durgin et al. (2009) found that only a\nsubset of participants indicated that they had cooperated with the experimental demand, and\nthis subset showed reliably higher slant estimates (see also Shaffer, McManama, Swank &\nDurgin, 2013). Bhalla and Proffitt reported that individual differences in physical fitness\naffected estimates of hill slant. However, their study of this confounded physical fitness with\nsex, which rendered the results hard to interpret (see Durgin et al., 2010, for discussion).\nTo try to minimize experimental demands of direct manipulation of fitness or age (Durgin\net al., 2009; Firestone, 2013; Firestone & Scholl, in press), we conducted an exploratory cross-\nsectional study on slant perception. We sought to be able to model our data not only with\nrespect to individual differences, such as age and gender, but also with respect to other forms\nof individual difference, such as personality variables that covary with sex (Schmitt, Realo,\nVoracek, & Allik, 2008), as well as cognitive differences, such as knowledge of slant bias\n(Durgin & Li, 2011; Stigliani, Li, & Durgin, 2013). A personality variable like agreeableness,\nfor example, is sex-linked, such that females tend to be higher than males on this trait\n(Schmitt et al., 2008). If many participants guess that experimenters want them to give\nhigh estimates, but more agreeable participants are more likely to cooperate with this\nimplicit demand, a sex difference in slant estimation (but not slant perception) could result\nfrom this personality trait. By testing for effects of agreeableness in a variable population, it\nmay be possible to test whether sex differences in slant estimation might arise from trait\ndifferences. Moreover, by sampling an off-campus population in a multidimensional study\nalong with on-campus participants, we sought to minimize experimenter bias effects\nassociated with null hypothesis testing.\nTo maximize sensitivity to population variables (individual differences), our study focused\nprimarily on a single hill, which was assessed with manual, visual, and verbal measures. All\nparticipants were first tested with this hill. In a classic study reporting sex differences, Proffitt\net al. (1995) collected three measures similar to these at a single hill for each participant.\nWe devoted our entire N to a single hill, though two further hills were tested with\nverbal measures. Our primary analysis is of the perceived slant of a paved path on a single\nsteep (9) hill.\nMethods\nParticipants\nOne-hundred and six adults (46 males), nai\u00a8ve to the purpose of the study, were successfully\nrecruited to participate in our study from the student body at Swarthmore College or from\nthe surrounding community. Forty-eight of the participants were nonstudent community\nmembers, ranging in age from 18 to 72 years old (15 males); 58 of the participants were\nSwarthmore College students, ranging in age from 18 to 22 (31 males). Recruitment materials\nindicated that participants were to wear corrective lenses if they needed them, that\nparticipants must be able to speak and read English, and that they must be able to stand\nwhile making their judgments. Visual acuity was measured using a Snellen chart for all but\none participant (with whatever corrective lenses they wore during the experiment); only two\nDean et al. 3\nmethods were approved by the local institutional review board.\nHills\nThree hills were tested in the same order for each participant. The primary hill, shown in\nFigure 1, left panel, is a steep campus path with a slant of 9 as measured by an inclinometer\nat the location marked by the orange cone off to one side. The second hill was a very steep\ngrassy embankment at the side of a nearby path, with a slant of 22.5. The third hill was a\nbroad campus path with a slant of 4.5. The to-be-judged portion of each hill was marked\nwith either a small orange cone (hills 1 and 2) or by an existing landmark to the side of the\npath (hill 3). Participants stood at a fixed location when making their estimates from the base\nof each hill, and the portion of the path or embankment to be judged was roughly at eye level.\nMeasures of Perceived Slant\nThree measures were used for the primary (9) hill. The measures were collected in a fixed\norder designed to minimize the risk of measure-to-measure bias. Participants were first asked\nto indicate the slant of the hill by holding their hand parallel to the hill (they held their hand\nup behind a vertical screen so that they could not see their hand). They wore a lightweight\ninclinometer on their hand so that we could measure the orientation of the back of their\nhand. We also measured the angular thickness of their hand when they placed it on a\nhorizontal level surface after holding it up. The calculated orientation of the midline axis\nof their hand relative to horizontal was used as measure of their intended orientation (see Li\n& Durgin, 2011). We call this the manual matching response (MMR).\nThe second measure used was based on the visual measure developed by Proffitt et al.\n(1995). In this case, the participant had to adjust a 2D depiction of a hill (see Figure 1, right\npanel). An estimate in degrees (relative to horizontal) was then read off a digital protractor\nmounted on the measure. This will be called the visual matching response (VMR). It was\nalways started from a slant of 0.\nFigure 1. The primary, 9, hill (left) and the two nonverbal measures depicted in use.\n4 i-Perception\nFinally, a verbal estimate was requested in degrees relative to horizontal. This measure was\ncollected last so that it would be less likely to influence the nonverbal measures. The\nreasoning for this was that if a participant first gave a verbal response, they might be\nlikely to try to match their visual and manual responses to the verbal response, which\nwould be easier to remember than would be the manual and visual matches. We call this\nthe numeric estimation response (NER). Note that for the 22.5 and 4.5 hills only an NER\nwas collected.\nMeasures of Individual Differences\nTo avoid influencing slant judgments, all demographic information and other measures of\nindividual differences were collected after the slant judgments were completed. An assessment\nof visual acuity was first performed using a Snellen eye chart viewed from 6.1 m. After this, all\nof the individual difference information was collected on computer by a custom program\nimplemented in E-Prime.\nThe personality variables were tested first. These were three scales of the Big Five\nInventory that are known to be sex-linked (Schmitt et al., 2008): Female participants tend\nto score higher than male participants on agreeableness (AG) and conscientiousness (CO)\nand lower on emotional stability (ES). Each scale consisted of 20 items. Participants indicated\nthe degree to which a trait word described them on a 9-point scale ranging from not at all (1)\nto extremely (9). Sample items for agreeableness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability\nare (a) ``helpful,'' (b) ``practical,'' and (c) ``moody'' (reverse coded), respectively. Note that a\npositivity bias might be expected for such scales, but such a bias would predict high\ncorrelations across all three scales, and this was not observed.\nWe intended to measure spatial ability by including a computerized mental rotation task\nwith Shepard and Metzler (1971) shapes (Peters & Battista, 2008). There is a great deal of\nevidence for sex differences in spatial tasks (e.g., D. Voyer, S. Voyer, & Bryden, 1995)\nincluding those related to slope (Nardi, Holmes, Newcombe, & Weisberg, 2015; Nardi,\nMeloni, Orlandi, & Olivetti-Belardinelli, 2014). However, data from this reaction time\ntask, which involved judging whether each of two imaged shapes was the same or different\nfrom another, were reliably correlated both with age and with conscientiousness.1 This\nrendered its value as a measure of spatial ability questionable; it was not used for analysis.\nParticipants were next asked whether they had prior experiences or special knowledge that\nwas relevant to the evaluation of hill slant (we gave as examples experience with skiing,\nmeasuring a slant with an inclinometer, or having had a driveway repaved); 36\nparticipants listed some form of such experience. We also asked participants whether they\nused any particular strategies in making their judgment, though this data were intended\nsimply to screen for unusual approaches to the task and were not included in statistical\nanalyses.\nFinally, we collected demographic information such as sex and age, and also self-reported\nweight and height, which was used to estimate body mass index (BMISR\n). BMI has been used\npreviously as a marker of fitness by proponents of embodied perception (e.g., Bhalla &\nProffitt, 1999; Sugovic & Witt, 2011). We used de-identified self-report of weight to avoid\nprivacy concerns where some of our participants were peers of the experimenters. Because we\nwondered if high-heeled footwear might influence slant judgments, we also asked them to\nindicate the height of the heels of their shoes, though there turned out to be insufficient\nvariance in this measure to use it as a predictor.\nThe correlations among our various predictor variables are shown in Table 1. It can be\nseen that the personality traits we expected to be sex-linked did not strongly covary with sex\nDean et al. 5\nin our sample, but that they did all tend to covary with age, with a particularly strong\ncorrelation (r \u00bc .38) between age and emotional stability, (p < .0001).\nProcedure\nOnce participants arrived at the lab, they signed a consent form and were paid in advance for\ntheir time. All participants were first involved in a separate study of distance perception and\nheight perception in a field near the Psychology building (Oh et al., 2015). Following this,\nparticipants were driven in a golf cart by an experimenter to a different part of campus where\nthey stopped at each of the three hills, made their five judgments (three at the first hill and one\nat each of the other two) and were then driven back to the Psychology building where the\nindividual difference measures were collected.\nAnalysis\nAs has been reported previously (Shaffer, McManama, Swank, et al., 2014; Stigliani et al.,\n2013), all three of the slant measures were reliably correlated with each other, suggesting a\ncommon underlying representation: MMR and VMR, r104\ntherefore averaged to produce a single estimate of perceived hill slant for the 9 hill for each\nparticipant (note that separate analyses are also reported for each measure below for\ncompleteness). We then used simultaneous multiple linear regression modeling to look at\nall of the data from the first hill using the individual difference scores as predictors.\nResults\nIn previous studies (e.g., Durgin & Li, 2011), prior experiential knowledge relevant to slant\nestimation (e.g., experience with skiing) has been a predictor of slant estimates, and the\npresent data replicate this observation. A simultaneous multiple linear regression model\nwas tested that included knowledge, conscientiousness, agreeableness, emotional stability,\nage, sex, and BMISR\nas predictors, as well as all two-way interactions between them (all\nvariables were first centered). This analysis showed main effects of knowledge, sex, and\nBMISR\n: Those reporting some knowledge gave lower (more accurate) estimates,\nTable 1.

The only reliable predictor of estimates among\nknowledgeable people was conscientiousness, which predicted reliably lower (and thus more\nnot anticipated, this pattern is consistent with the idea that knowledgeable people scoring\nhigher in conscientiousness were more likely to take the trouble to use their knowledge\n(rather than merely their perceptual experience) when asked to provide a slant estimate. A\nplot depicting the interaction between conscientiousness and knowledge is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Interaction between conscientiousness and knowledge on estimates of 9 hill.\nTable 2.

We will consider each of these observations in turn.\nAge. As shown in Figure 3, older participants gave estimates that were lower than those of\nR2 \u00bc 0.084. The direction of this effect differs from the claims of Bhalla and Proffitt (1999)\nwho argued that older people saw hills as steeper. However, for a hill of a similar magnitude\nto this one (as well as for all lower hills they tested), Bhalla and Proffitt found a similar pattern:\nOlder adults in their study gave lower estimates than younger observers (see also Norman et al.,\n2009). Thus, we have replicated the finding that older adults are more accurate than are younger\nadults in slant estimation of a typical walkable slope. It remains possible that these effects reflect\nan accumulation of world knowledge that is not detected by our experiential knowledge probe.\nFigure 3. Age effect on estimates of 9 hill among is present among those without knowledge, but not\namong those reporting experiential knowledge.\nTable 3. Model for Those With No Knowledge of Slant (N \u00bc 67).\nEstimate Standard error t value p value\nBMISR\nNote. AG \u00bc agreeableness; CO \u00bc conscientiousness; ES \u00bc emotional stability; BMI \u00bc body mass index.\n8 i-Perception\nWe note that measured visual acuity was, of course, correlated with age, but the age effect\nfound here remained even when visual acuity was included in the model as a covariate.\nSex. Consistent with previous reports, female participants gave estimates that were 4.2\nthat these effects are not due to sex-linked personality differences (which were included in\nthe model), nor by the forms of experiential knowledge measured by our probe. Note\nthat excluding sex as a factor in this model did not unmask any effects of sex-linked\npersonality traits.\nBMISR\n. As shown in Figure 4, participants with higher BMISR\ngave higher slant estimates,\nbehavioral potential (i.e., fitness) affects slant perception. However, a closer look at the data\nhere shows that the effect is limited to obese women, which may support the alternative\nperspective that knowingly having a particularly high BMI may influence how participants\nmake their estimate.\nOf the 67 people in the no-knowledge condition, seven can be classified as obese, and it is a\nsubset of these seven that drive the BMISR\neffect: If we eliminate the seven obese participants\n(without knowledge) from our analysis, not only does BMISR\ncease to be predictive,\nThus it seems possible that greater salience of body image among females is responsible for\nat least a portion of the sex differences found in previous studies. Among the nine obese\nparticipants in our overall sample, the six females gave reliably higher average estimates of\nthe influence of obesity on slant judgment is sex-linked, this would seem consistent with the\nidea that effects of obesity are based on sociocognitive factors rather than perceptual effects.\nDifferences between measures? There is a controversial claim in the literature that the three\nmeasures we used tap into different underlying representations (e.g., Creem & Proffitt, 1998,\n2001; but see Durgin, Hajnal et al., 2010). In particular, Creem and Proffitt suggested that\nmanual measures tap into dorsal (``accurate'') processing streams, whereas visual and verbal\nmeasures reflect conscious perception. Shaffer et al. (Shaffer, McManama, & Durgin, 2015;\nShaffer, McManama, Swank, et al., 2014) have argued that manual measures are just more\nsusceptible to anchoring effects.\nTo address this issue here, we tested whether manual measures were immune to individual\ndifferences. As we expected, however, given that the three measures are typically correlated,\nregression models computed for each of the three measures individually showed evidence of\neffects of age and of BMISR\namong those without knowledge of slant.\nThe pattern among those with knowledge of slant differed somewhat for the manual\nmeasure in a manner that might also indicate a role of sex-linked personality traits. The\nfirst estimate given by each participant was the manual estimate. When the manual estimates\nwere analyzed separately, they showed evidence of an interaction between knowledge and\nagreeableness (rather than between knowledge and conscientiousness). In fact, among those\nreporting some knowledge of slant, manual estimates tended to increase with agreeableness,\nis exactly the sort of pattern (an interaction of knowledge and agreeableness) that one would\npredict of participants who might be trying to co-operate with what they expect the\nexperiment to be about (Durgin et al., 2009). Insofar as their knowledge gave them some\nawareness that hill slant tends to be overestimated, those participants who were more\nDean et al. 9\nagreeable tended to give higher estimates in their very first estimate, perhaps believing that\nthe experimenters wished to measure overestimation of hill slant.\nThis evidence that agreeable participants were tempted to ``help'' initially, is not\ninconsistent with the further observation, that, when finally asked to give a verbal\nestimate, the conscientious participants (among those who had knowledge) now gave\nevidence that both agreeableness and conscientiousness interact with the presence of some\nknowledge about hill slant overestimation in determining responses.\nBecause the order in which the different types of estimates were collected was fixed, we\ncannot draw strong conclusions about whether this is indeed an order effect or an effect of the\nmanual nature of the measure. However, the present data are consistent with the idea that\npersonality variables can interact with background knowledge of participants both to elevate\nestimates (including manual estimates) and to rein them in.\nReplication with the steep embankment. For the 22.5 embankment, a preliminary analysis of\nverbal estimates showed a similar pattern to the data from the primary hill. There was a\nbetween knowledge and conscientiousness, t(74) \u00bc 2.02, p \u00bc .048. A separate analysis of the\nparticipants reporting some knowledge about hill slant indicated a marginal effect of\nprimary hill. The analysis of those without knowledge (Table 4) replicated the effects of age,\nparticipants gave judgments at the primary hill first, the replication of most of the patterns is\nreassuring, but perhaps unsurprising since participants were likely trying to remain consistent\nwith their previous estimate.\nReplication with the shallow path. For the 4.5 path, analysis of verbal estimates again showed\na reliable interaction between knowledge and conscientiousness, t(74) \u00bc 2.34, p \u00bc .022.\nHowever, a separate analysis of the participants reporting some knowledge about hill slant\ndid not detect any reliable main effects. The analysis of those who reported no knowledge\nshowed a marginal effect of BMISR\neffects were reliable. It seems likely that individual difference effects from the previous\nTable 4.

AG \u00bc agreeableness; CO \u00bc conscientiousness; ES \u00bc emotional stability; BMI \u00bc body mass index\nanalyses were not detectable at this hill simply because the mean estimates were compressed\nrelative to the variance.\nOne way of expressing differential proportional variance is the coefficient of variation\n(CoV), which is the standard deviation of a measure divided by the mean. For the verbal\nestimates of the 4.5 hill, the CoV was 0.69, which was substantially greater than the 0.36\nNote that CoVs of the individual measures for the 9 hill were somewhat higher than those\nof the combined response: They ranged from 0.43 for the visual matches to 0.52 for the verbal\nestimates, whereas combining these correlated measures effectively produced a more sensitive\nmeasure by reducing proportional variance. Durgin, Hajnal et al. (2010) have discussed\ndifferential proportional variance as an artifactual source of apparent dissociation between\ndifferent types of slant measure. The current result illustrates how differential proportional\nvariance can also affect analysis of data from different hills. The results also indicate the\nadvantage of combining correlated measures into a single measure for the purpose of\nreducing error variance.\nHow does aging affect slant perception? A comparison to the findings of Bhalla and Proffitt\n(1999). Bhalla and Proffitt (1999) collected hill slant estimation data from older\nparticipants (age 60 and above). Each older participant in their study saw four hills. They\ncompared these data with normative data collected in a prior study (Proffitt et al., 1995) with\ndifferent sets of hills, a different design, and different instructions. They concluded from this\ncomparison that older adults saw hills as steeper. However, their own data seem to contradict\nthis conclusion for the majority of hill slants tested, and their design leaves the comparisons\nbetween the two groups risky overall. The verbal estimation data used by Bhalla and Proffitt\nare replotted in Figure 5. It can be seen that for hill slants of 4, 5, and 10, their older\nparticipants gave lower estimates than were provided in the normative data. Proffitt and\nBhalla adopted the rather unusual statistical approach of comparing estimates that were\naveraged across the entire range of 2 to 10 and reported a null statistical effect.\nFigure 4. BMISR\neffect on estimates of 9 hill among those without knowledge is driven by obese\nparticipants (i.e., BMI > 30). BMI \u00bc body mass index.\nFor comparison with their results, we computed average verbal estimates at each of the\nthree hills we tested for all participants older than 59 years old (N \u00bc 11) as well as for\nparticipants younger than 23 years old (N \u00bc 70). These data are shown in Figure 6 along\nwith standard error bars. At each of the three hills we tested, the estimates of the older\nparticipants (M \u00bc 6.5, 14.6, 31.4) are less than the estimates of the younger participants\nIn summary, older adults gave lower (more accurate) estimates than younger adults for all\nthe hills we tested including a very steep embankment. Note that there is evidence that older\nAverage verbal estimate (deg)\nActual slant of hill (deg)\nFigure 5.

Note that their conclusion appears to be contradicted in the\nrange from 4 to 10. Standard errors of the means are shown.\nFigure 6. Verbal estimation data for the three hills we tested, divided into older and younger adults.\nStandard errors of the means are shown.\nadults are also more accurate at estimating egocentric distance (Bian & Anderson, 2013) and\nexocentric depth extents (Norman, Adkins, Norman, Cox, & Rogers, 2015), and knowledge\neffects have also been implicated for estimates of distance (Durgin, Leonard-Solis, Masters,\nSchmelz, & Li, 2012). The present age effect on slant estimation is consistent with cognitive\nfactors playing a significant role in slant estimation. We did not see any evidence that older\nadults gave higher slant estimates, as had been proposed by Bhalla and Proffitt (1999). Even\nfor our steepest hill (22.5), the older adults gave lower estimates than did the younger adults.\nIt might be objected that our sample was self-selected and thus cannot support strong\nconclusions about effects of aging. For example, Bhalla and Proffitt recruited some of their\nolder participants from a senior living community, and their participants may have differed\nfrom ours in health and fitness. These concerns, however, ought to be mitigated by the\nobservation that our data seem to agree with the majority of the data of Bhalla and\nProffitt (as well as the data of Norman et al., 2009 collected for small surfaces) in\nsuggesting that older adults are generally more accurate at estimating slant than are\nyounger adults. The two hills where the data of Bhalla and Proffitt suggest otherwise were\nnot tested with younger participants and were tested with potentially biasing instructions.\nDiscussion\nOur study sought to evaluate individual differences in slant estimation in order to\ndifferentiate between cognitive (e.g., modularist; Firestone & Scholl, 2016) and perceptual\n(e.g., embodied perception; Bhalla & Proffitt, 1999) interpretations of such individual\ndifferences. Two of the strongest and most consistent predictors we observed were age and\nexperiential knowledge. Experiential knowledge could involve a variety of activities, such as\nskiing, that might allow one to learn about the mismatch between perceived and actual slant.\nMore than a third of our population reported some experiential knowledge, and these\nparticipants gave lower, more accurate, estimates of hills. Age acted similarly in that older\nparticipants gave lower, more accurate judgments that were similar to those who explicitly\nreported having experiential knowledge (see Figure 3).\nOf particular importance, we found that conscientiousness could have a substantial role in\nestimating slant: Among participants explicitly indicating some experiential knowledge\nconcerning slant, conscientiousness seemed to predict whether they would use that\nknowledge to lower (improve) their estimates both for the steep path and for the steep\nembankment. This observation helps to show that cognitive effects of experience play an\nimportant role.\nWe found only circumstantial evidence that sex differences in slant estimation might be\ndue to personality differences in our study. First, for those with some knowledge,\nagreeableness seemed to elevate initial manual slant estimates. This is consistent with the\nidea that participants who suspected that we wanted to get overestimates tried to oblige us to\nthe extent that they were agreeable. Although agreeableness was not strongly correlated with\nsex in our study, it is generally regarded as a sex-linked trait, such that females tend to score\nhigher on measures of agreeableness than males. A combined role of agreeableness and\nknowledge might be a pathway whereby females would end up giving higher estimates\nthan males even though their perceptual experience might not differ on average.\nA second hypothesis for explaining sex-differences in hill slant estimation was suggested by\nour findings related to obesity. Obesity was a predictor of slant estimates among those who\ndid not report having any special knowledge of slant. However, this effect was limited to\nfemale participants. Future investigations may want to consider whether obese female\nparticipants are more likely to provide particularly high estimates for social reasons or\nbecause they actually perceive hills as geometrically steeper. That is, it seems unlikely that\nthese participants really meant that the 9 hill appeared to be tilted half way to vertical;\nperhaps their exaggerated estimates reflect stereotype threat or consciously taking imagined\neffort into consideration (Woods et al., 2009).\nOverall, our data suggest that age, knowledge, and personality differences produced\ncognitive rather than perceptual effects in this study. The effect of age, in particular, went\ncontrary to the widely cited claims of embodied perception. We have suggested that those\nclaims probably ought not to have been made in the first place given that the original data for\nolder participants were collected under such different circumstances than the data of younger\nparticipants to which it was compared. The effect of experiential knowledge, by seeming to\nremove age and fitness effects, strongly suggests that the age effects we have documented are\nmore cognitive than perceptual. That is, experiential knowledge did not simply act as an\nadditional factor, nor did it produce particularly accurate estimates on average, but it seemed\nto replace these other factors rather than combine with them.\nAlthough there may additionally be individual differences in the perceived slant of hills, it\nis hard to measure such individual differences because cognitive factors can easily overwhelm\nperceptual variation. The subject-wise correlations across measures we replicated here might\nmean that participants are reporting their individual and unique percept by each of the\nmeasures. However, correlations could also emerge as the result of individual differences in\nthe cognitive translation processes from perception to a reportable impression.\nMore striking to us than these possible individual differences is the success of recent\nquantitative models of hill perception, such as the angular scale expansion model proposed\nfor hill perception (Li & Durgin, 2010, 2012). This model uses one fixed parameter (an\nangular gain of 1.5, estimated across a variety of studies; Durgin & Li, 2011) and one free\nparameter that accounts for an additional logarithmic effect (see also Bridgeman & Hoover,\n2008) of viewing distance on slant perception measures both for explicit slant estimation (e.g.,\nthe classic hill data of Proffitt et al., 1995) and implicit (shape-based) measures of perceived\nslant (Li & Durgin, 2010, 2012). These models propose that the striking overall bias observed\nin slant perception may represent a species-wide functional (efficient) perceptual coding\nstrategy that effectively exaggerates the (shallow) range of slants most often encountered in\nperceptual experience.\nThe present findings regarding effects of age, knowledge, and personality suggest that a\ncomplete model of cognitive processes of slant estimation might profitably include a variety\nof postperceptual transformations and adjustments. These postperceptual processes clearly\ninvolve cognitive effects of experience and knowledge that appear to interact with personality\nvariables such as conscientiousness and agreeableness. Depending on context, estimation\nmay additionally be susceptible to social and cognitive biases including anchoring,\nstereotype threat, and experimental demand characteristics--which may also interact with\npersonality variables.\n"
