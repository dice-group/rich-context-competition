Page use statistical\nanalysis to adjudicate between four ideal-type theories of\nAmerican politics (Gilens and Page, 2014). Their main find-\nings are that \"economic elites and organized groups repre-\nsenting business interests have substantial independent\nimpacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens\nand mass-based interest groups have little or no independent\ninfluence.\" These findings provide support for theories\ncalled economic-elite domination and biased pluralism.\nAccording to several journalistic accounts but not\nGilens and Page themselves, the findings show that the\nAmerican system of government is best understood as\n\"oligarchy.\"1 Extensive press coverage of the article has\nsuccessfully drawn attention to one of the most important\nquestions in the study of contemporary American poli-\ntics: to what extent do the wealthy dominate average citi-\nzens in the formulation of government policy?2 In pursuit\nof an answer, Gilens and his team of researchers gathered\ndata over a long period, tracking 1923 instances between\noppose questions about proposed policy changes. This is\na commendable attempt to bring evidence to the study of\na timely and politically-loaded topic. Yet, as Gilens notes\nin his 2012 book based on a similar empirical foundation,\neven the most meticulously assembled dataset may not\nlend itself to straightforward inference.\nGilens and Page nevertheless draw several strong infer-\nences from their analysis. The authors do not argue that\npolicy outcomes correspond disproportionately to the pref-\nerences of the wealthy; in fact, their dataset reveals that the\nwealthy and the average have highly correlated prefer-\nences. Rather, the main inferences in the paper are about\ncausality: do we only have \"democracy by coincidence\" in\nthe United States? Gilens and Page claim that they can\n\"decisively reject\" majoritarian views of American democ-\nracy because they have found a way to determine which\ngroups have \"independent influence\" in policymaking.3\nAccording to the authors, \"[o]ur main point concerns causal\ninference: if interpreted in terms of actual causal impact,\nTesting Inferences about\nAmerican Politics: A Review of\nthe \"Oligarchy\" Result\nOmar S Bashir\n Keywords\nAmerican politics, representation, inequality, quantitative methods, replication\nPrinceton University, USA\nCorresponding author:\nOmar S Bashir, Department of Politics, Princeton University,130\nEmail: obashir@princeton.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nthe prior findings [supporting majoritarian theories] appear\nto be largely or wholly spurious.\"4 They point to a \"nearly\ntotal failure\" of majoritarian frames and assert that \"the\npreferences of economic elites... have far more independ-\nent impact upon policy change than the preferences of aver-\nage citizens do.\"5 They conclude that \"America's claims to\nbeing a democratic society are seriously threatened.\"6\nAfter summarizing the steps taken by Gilens and Page, I\nexamine the statistical basis for their central claim that\naverage Americans have virtually no influence on policy\noutcomes. I show that the result on which the original study\nis based is too likely to have been produced by chance\nbecause the income-based independent variables are highly\ncorrelated. I then evaluate three of the study's descriptive\nclaims about American democracy before concluding.\nSummary of original approach\nThis section outlines the steps taken to reproduce Table 3 in\nthe original paper. Reprinted here as Table 1, it features the\nmain result of the study. Several predicted probability plots\nand odds comparisons in the original article are based on the\ncoefficients in Model 4 of the table. Gilens and Page show\nin the first three columns that each of their independent vari-\nables, one at a time, seem to exert a positive and significant\neffect on policy outcomes.7 These independent variables\ninclude the preferences of average citizens (proxied by the\nestimated preferences of respondents at the 50th income\npercentile), the preferences of economic elites (90th income\npercentile), and the preferences of interest groups.\n\"But the picture changes markedly,\" the authors state,\n\"when all three independent variables are included in the\nmultivariate Model 4... The estimated impact of average\ncitizens' preferences drops precipitously, to a non-signifi-\ncant, near-zero level. Clearly the median citizen or `median\nvoter' at the heart of theories of Majoritarian Electoral\nDemocracy does not do well when put up against economic\nelites and organized interest groups.\"8 Note that the authors'\nbasis for causal inference is the inclusion of multiple vari-\nables in the same model.\nModel 4, the key result in the paper, does not reflect the\noutput of a typical logistic or linear regression test. The\nauthors pursue a rather non-standard approach because they\nidentify correlated survey error between the 50th and 90th\nincome percentile preference variables. As they explain in\ntheir Appendix 2, a typical multiple regression9 including\nboth those variables produces implausible coefficient esti-\nmates. These implausible estimates are attributed to the\ncorrelated survey error just mentioned.10\nGiven their diagnosis, Gilens and Page perform a multi-\nstep correction procedure. First, they quantify correlated\nsurvey error by exploiting groups of two, three, or more of\nthe 1779 survey questions which they code as addressing\nthe same basic concept in the same calendar year. The\nauthors claim that, based on their identification of 116 sets\nof similar survey questions, measurement error is responsi-\nble for 17% of the observed covariance between the meas-\nNext, using that estimate of correlated measurement\nerror, the authors \"estimated structural equation models in\nAMOS that purged of error the structural coefficients rep-\nresenting the associations of the predictors with [their] out-\ncome measure.\" The structural equations are not specified\nin the paper. AMOS features a graphical interface in which\nusers draw model diagrams. Unfortunately, the input dia-\ngram for the central statistical test is not included in the\npaper's replication repository,12 but one of the authors\nkindly shared it with me. The input diagram consists of two\nurement submodel which accounts for the aforementioned\ncorrelated error between the income-based variables and\nalso for measurement error in the interest-group variable\nalone (the authors estimate a reliability of 0.87 for that\nmeasure). Second, the core submodel linking the unob-\nserved but \"corrected\" versions of independent variables to\nthe dichotomous dependent variable is a linear regression\nmodel for which AMOS provides coefficients. These coef-\nficients are those reported in Model 4.\nFor presentational purposes, the authors use the coeffi-\ncients to compute predicted probabilities of policy change.\nThe plots in the study reveal a flat line of virtually zero\npolicy responsiveness to the preferences of average\nAmericans. Meanwhile, elites' preferences seem to swing\nthe predicted probabilities of policy change dramatically. I\nwas unsure about how to repeat the process of computing\nthose probabilities since Model 4 is a modified linear\nTable 1. Reprinted from Table 3 in Gilens and Page. From the original caption: the dependent variable is the policy outcome,\ncoded 1 if the proposed policy change took place within 4 years of the survey date and 0 if it did not. Predictors are the logits of\nthe imputed percentage of respondents at the 50th (\"average citizens\") or 90th (\"economic elites\") income percentile that favor the\nproposed policy change... All analyses reflect estimated measurement error in the predictors.\nregression, not a logistic regression. But because the pre-\ndicted probability plots are all based on the coefficients\nreported in Model 4, any problems with the divergent coef-\nficients representing the median- and high-income groups\nwould implicate the plots as well. The next section thus\nasks whether there is an alternative explanation for the dif-\nference in reported coefficients.\nDeceptively divergent income\ncoefficients\nRecall from Table 1, Model 4 above the striking differ-\nence reported between income-based coefficients. The\ncoefficient for 90th income percentile Americans is highly\ntimes larger than the coefficient of 0.03 corresponding to\nthe median-income group. Because the 50th percentile\ncoefficient takes on a \"near zero\" value, the authors claim\nthat the policy process is non-responsive to average\nAmericans.\nBut the original study relies on linear regression of a\ndichotomous dependent variable on two highly correlated\nindependent variables. Standard practice when dealing with\ndichotomous outcomes is to employ logistic regression to\navoid violation of the constant error variance assumption of\nlinear regression. In addition, high correlation between inde-\npendent variables violates an assumption of both linear and\nlogistic regression. The correlation coefficient between the\nincome-based variables is r = 0.78, even after the authors'\nprocedure to address correlated error reduces the coefficient\nfrom its observed value of r = 0.94. Another reason to\ninvestigate further is that the preference distributions of the\ntwo income groups are difficult to distinguish from each\nother when conditioned on policy outcome, as shown in\nFigure 1. The high correlation between variables already\nsuggests that the unconditioned distributions are similar to\neach other. Yet if one group is far more influential on policy,\none might expect distributions to diverge when conditioning\nin this way. Group means are within 0.02 of each other in\nboth plots.\nI employ a simulation to investigate whether the authors'\nlinear regression of a dichotomous dependent variable on\nhighly correlated independent variables can generate\nextreme but incorrect results. Online Appendix A lists the\nspecific steps in the simulation, which is implemented in R\nwith replication code accompanying this review.14\nWhile the steps are detailed elsewhere, here I provide an\noverview of the procedure. For each simulation iteration, I\nrandomly generate three independent variables, ensuring\nthat they each have the properties and mutual relationships\nthat the Gilens and Page variables have after the authors'\nerror corrections are applied. This means, for instance,\nensuring that two of the randomly generated variables are\nhighly correlated (r = 0.78). Next, I construct an outcome\nvariable for the iteration by first choosing a \"true\" coeffi-\ncient for each independent variable and then using a linear\nmodel to compute the left-hand side in the familiar regres-\nsion equation setup based on those coefficients. The out-\ncome variable is dichotomized to match the form of its\nanalogue in the study. Finally, I perform linear regression of\nthe outcome variable back on the randomly generated inde-\npendent variables, which should yield estimated coeffi-\ncients close to the three true coefficients that defined the\ndata-generating process. If linear regression fails to pro-\nduce accurate estimates of the true coefficients, this signals\na problem with the numerical conditions in the study.\nSpecifically, if I choose a true coefficient for the analogue\nto the median-income independent variable that is reason-\nably large, but the approach tends to produce a much\nsmaller and thus erroneous estimate along with high levels\nFigure 1. Histograms which illustrate the extent of overlap in the preference distributions of 90th and 50th income percentile\nAmericans, conditional on policy outcome. Left: only those 588 cases in which change ensues. Right: the 1191 cases in which no full\npolicy change is detected within 4 years.\n4 Research and Politics \nof apparent statistical significance, then the Gilens and\nPage result may not be reliable.\nAnother way to describe the simulation is that it com-\nputes regression coefficient estimates under a fixed set of\ntrue (chosen) coefficients. It allows one to ask, \"If the true\ncoefficients for the 50th and 90th percentile variables were\nin fact \nt and \nt , what kinds of estimates of those coef-\nficients, \nand \n, would the study's approach tend to\nproduce?\" The chosen coefficients \nt and \nt are true in\nthe sense that they are used in each simulation iteration to\nconstruct an outcome variable from randomly-generated\nversions of the independent variables, matching as closely\nas possible the conditions in the original study. One would\nexpect the estimated coefficients produced by subsequent\nregression to be close to the true coefficients chosen to seed\neach iteration.\nNote that I am not simply questioning the statistical sig-\nnificance of the difference between the 50th and 90th percen-\ntile coefficients, which would require only a test of the null\nhypothesis of coefficient equality. In other words, Gilens and\nPage do not merely argue that the income-based coefficients\nare statistically different from each other; indeed, prior\nresearch already holds that the wealthy have a moderately\ngreater impact on policy outcomes. The authors go further by\nstressing a drastic substantive difference in coefficient mag-\nnitude, with one coefficient being virtually zero.\nResults\nWhat if the 50th percentile coefficient were in reality not\nminuscule? Would the study's approach report that it was\nnear zero nonetheless? I run multiple simulations to answer\nthe question. Across simulations, I vary the true coefficient\n\nt corresponding to the median-income variable at values\nmuch larger than its reported value of 0.03. This allows one\nto examine the rate of erroneously small estimates as a\nfunction of the values that \nmight actually take. I hold\nthe true coefficient \nt corresponding to elites at its reported\nvalue of 0.76 in every simulation.\nThe results are displayed in Figure 2. If \nlarger than half of the high-income coefficient, the statisti-\ncal approach in the study mistakenly estimates it to be\nessentially zero in more than 20 percent of trials.15 We also\nsee the study's extreme divergence between \nand \nat\na rate greater than 10 percent when the chosen coefficient is\nset to that value.\nNot shown in the figure is that when the enforced cor-\nrelation between independent variables is reduced from\n0.78 (as in the study) to lower values, the simulation does\nnot produce extreme results by either criterion, \nnear\nzero or wide divergence between \nand \n, for any value\nof \nt tested. That reliable results are produced when this\nchange is made confirms that the simulation is not stacked\nagainst the original approach.\nWhen we return to the study's correlation level (Figure 2)\nand instead set \nt\nto 0.56, equal to the coefficient reported\nfor interest groups, the estimated coefficient is still\nfound to be essentially zero in more than ten percent of simu-\nlation trials even though it is known to be much larger. The\nextreme divergence found in the study is also still produced\nat a rate that exceeds the common 95% significance standard.\nEven if the median-income and interest group coefficients\nwere in fact equal to each other, the authors' approach would\ntoo often produce the numbers they report simply by chance.\nThe main point is not a single significance test, but\nrather that Figure 2 illustrates how multivariate regression\nunder these conditions is indeed prone to overstatement of\nthe importance of income. Furthermore, it makes sense that\n\nt (not shown) is more likely than any of the larger\nchosen coefficients tested in the figure to yield the wide\nBut it yields that divergence and corresponding statistical\nsignificance at a rate of only 0.3.

When the enforced correlation\ncoefficient between the first two independent variables is\nreduced from 0.78 to lower positive values, the performance\nof multivariate analysis improves. Thus, even though stand-\nard errors are reported to be small, the high correlation\nbetween the preferences of median-income and high-income\nAmericans seems to interfere with reliable estimation.\nOnline Appendix B gauges whether a simpler kind of\ntest can support the assertion that average Americans have\nno impact on policy. Conditional on interest group opposi-\ntion to change, the policy process seems more responsive to\nmedian-income citizens than to economic elites. On the\nother hand, the preferences of the wealthy seem to have\nmuch more impact when interest groups support change,\nthough the number of cases involved in the analysis is\nsmall.16 Future research might investigate this divergence\nfurther. The possibility that differences in income-based\nresponsiveness are conditional is another potential caveat\nto the study's findings.17\nDistinguishing and evaluating other\nclaims\nThe previous section shows that there is not yet enough evi-\ndence for the claim that average citizens have very little\nimpact on policy outcomes. Yet there are three descriptive\nclaims in the original paper which should be examined as\nwell. These assertions, some of which have been empha-\nsized in popular discourse, are more distinct from the central\nclaim and from each other than they at first appear to be.\nFirst, the authors state that \"even when fairly large\nmajorities of Americans favor policy change, they gener-\nally do not get it.\"18 Gilens and Page reference in their con-\nclusion their descriptive finding that, even if 80% of the\npublic favors change, that change occurs less than half of\nthe time.19 Readers of the concluding section may not real-\nize that \"public\" includes elites. In the original dataset,\nchange is enacted 47% of the time that median-income\nAmericans favor it at a rate of 80% or more. Yet change is\nenacted 52% of the time that elites favor it at that rate. The\ndifference between groups is smaller when one examines\nnot only strong preferences for change but strong prefer-\nences for either policy outcome.20 The authors mention but\ndo not emphasize that elites, too, seem to be affected by a\nstatus-quo bias. It is not clear how this finding is consistent\nwith a story of elite domination, especially because average\ncitizens tend to support the status quo more often when the\ngroups disagree.\nSecond, Gilens and Page claim that \"reality is best cap-\ntured by\" theories in which both economic elites and organ-\nized interest groups \"play a substantial part in affecting\npublic policy...\"21 Shortly after claiming that their model\ncaptures reality, the authors caution that the R2 value for\nModel 4 is 0.074. Roughly speaking, that means that their\nmodel, which accounts for the very groups that they say\nplay a substantial, even dominant22 role in determining\npolicy, explains less than 10 percent of the observed varia-\ntion in policy outcomes. The drastically different coeffi-\ncan be exchanged with each other and the resulting model\nstill successfully predicts almost the same number of policy\nchanges in the sample.23\nThe authors acknowledge the low R2 value and list\npotential reasons.24 The low value is not necessarily a prob-\nlem for hypothesis testing. Still, it provides useful informa-\ntion. For instance, when neither the rich nor the average\nfavor change, change still happens at a rate of 23% in the\ndataset. The policy process seems only weakly responsive\nto the preferences of the wealthy compared to variables\nmissing from the model.\nFinally, Gilens and Page claim that ordinary citizens get\nthe policies they favor \"only because those policies happen\nalso to be preferred by the economically-elite citizens who\nwield the actual influence.\"25 The authors' main focus is on\ncausality, but they also make the descriptive claim that\nwhen average citizens disagree with elites or organized\ninterests, \"they generally lose.\"26 To commentators, this\ninterpretation seemed to capture the essence of the project.\nOne prominent voice summarized the entire study in the\nfollowing way: \"when elite preferences and popular prefer-\nences are different, the elite almost always wins.\"27\nFigure 3. When independent variables are as highly correlated\nas they are in the study (solid curve), the 95% confidence\ninterval frequently misses the true coefficient value (low\ncoverage ratio). Performance of the study's approach improves\nat lower levels of correlation.\n6 Research and Politics \nYet, this is contradicted by the authors' dataset. There are\n185 cases in the data in which the average preferences of\nthe two income groups are on opposite sides of an issue.28\nMedian-income Americans receive their desired outcome\n47% of the time that the policy process must pick a winner\nbetween the average and the elite since the two groups disa-\ngree. The results are similar when the analysis is restricted to\nonly those cases of disagreement which also exhibit a large\npreference gap between groups.29 Nor do the results change\nif interest groups are incorporated as follows. The rich get\ntheir favored outcome despite the combined opposition of\nthe other two groups at a rate of 32%; meanwhile, average\nAmericans' favored outcome occurs 30% of the time that\nthey face combined opposition from interest groups and the\nwealthy. It is true that median-income citizens are more\nlikely to prefer the status quo when they and the wealthy\ndisagree, but this suggests that any status-quo bias embedded\nin the policy process favors average Americans.\nConclusion\nEven if I have not erred in this review, it would be wrong for\nreaders to conclude that the wealthiest Americans and busi-\nness interests do not enjoy advantages in influencing the\npolicy process. The Gilens and Page (2014) article is only\none part of a growing body of scholarship on this topic,30 and\nfurther work may uncover evidence that these advantages are\nin fact overwhelming. In addition, even if inequality were\nsomehow shown to have no bearing on who influences pol-\nicy, it would still be morally wrong to ignore it.\nYet, what this review aims to highlight is that the original\nstudy exhibits weaknesses in its main causal claim and\nin three of its descriptive claims. The statistical approach\nemployed in the study's central test seems too unreliable to\ngauge how much influence median-income citizens enjoy\nrelative to elites and interest groups. The combination of a\nlinear model, dichotomous dependent variable, and high cor-\nrelation between independent variables yields misleading\nestimates. The coefficient representing the influence of\nmedian-income citizens could be as large as the coefficient\nfor interest group influence. The more important issue is that\nthe study's approach has poor resolution on the median-\nincome coefficient. The approach also often produces confi-\ndence intervals which do not contain true coefficient values.\nIn short, the analysis is prone to underestimating dras-\ntically the causal impact of median-income preferences,\nassuming that regression coefficients even capture causality\nin this context: the authors' claim to causal inference is\nbased only on the fact that they perform multiple regression.\nThe authors have not yet shown that prior findings more\namenable to majoritarian theories are \"largely or wholly\nspurious,\" nor do their results seem to enable adjudication\nbetween competing conceptions of American democracy.\nI also evaluated a set of secondary claims in the study.\nThe notion that the American system is mere \"democracy\nby coincidence\" must contend with the finding that average\nAmericans have received their desired outcome roughly as\noften as the richest have when the two groups have been on\nopposite sides of an issue. Any status-quo bias in the policy\nprocess affects both income groups to a similar extent, and\nit may favor average citizens, who prefer the status quo\nmore often in the data. In addition, the authors' model\nexplains little of the variation in policy outcomes, so eco-\nnomic elites and interest groups cannot be said to \"domi-\nnate\" policymaking on the basis of this research even if\nthey do have a greater impact than average citizens.\nAlthough the authors' potentially fruitful distinction\nbetween different types of interest groups was not the focus\nof this review, the original study's result regarding the\nadvantage of business groups over mass-based groups is\nunclear. Gilens and Page emphasize a much larger regres-\nsion coefficient for business groups than for mass-based\ngroups in their Table 4. Yet they then report that, after they\nadjust for the number of actors of each kind, the two inter-\nest group types have roughly equal influence. The predomi-\nnance of business interest groups in the study thus rests on\nthe fact that there are more of them included in the analysis,\nwhich is partly a result of the authors' choice to add busi-\nness groups they felt were missing from Fortune maga-\nzine's\"Power25\"lists.31 Itisnotclear,then,thatmass-based\ngroups (labor organizations but also, by the authors' defini-\ntion, the National Rifle Association, Christian Coalition,\nAmerican Israel Public Affairs Committee, and National\nRight to Life Committee) have little influence. We also\nknow from Gilens's (2012) book that mass-based groups\nhave been largely responsible for the fact that social wel-\nfare policy seems to reflect the preferences of low- and\nmedian-income citizens more strongly than does govern-\nment policy in other areas.32\nThe tests in that book may provide a better way forward\non the question of influence. For instance, some analyses in\nthe book examine not \"disagreement\" between groups but\nrather issues on which different income groups diverge in\ntheir imputed preference level by more than 10%. I only\ncaution that divergence does not imply low correlation. In\naddition, frequent overlap between survey questions in the\ndataset may be a problem for large- N analysis. Some issues\neach generate several similar observations because there are\nmultiple surveys about them. Repeated observations include\nbut are not limited to at least nine questions about NAFTA\nwhich all appear as separate victories for the wealthy despite\nbeing based on the same policy outcome.33 For further illus-\ntration, I provide code that simplifies the presentation of\nobservations for which elites and median-income citizens\ndiverge by 10 points or more.34 It seems difficult to make\nnormative judgments about the policy process without\npaying attention to which policies median-income citizens\nsupported or opposed more strongly than elites during the\ntime period in the study.\nIn closing, \"Testing Theories of American Politics\" is\nbest where it emphasizes the tentative and imperfect nature\nof its analysis and where it motivates others to explore\nfurther the question of who really governs. I am grateful for\nthe clarifications that one of the authors was willing to pro-\nvide. Yet, given existing evidence, average Americans\nshould not believe that it is hopeless to confront or redress\nthrough political participation those unfair advantages that\nelites and organized groups surely do enjoy.\n"
