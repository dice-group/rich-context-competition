We used linear and logistic regression models to predict log-transformed PbB and the odds\nthat PbB was  5 and  10 \u00b5g/dL at a range of floor PbD.\nResults: The population-weighted geometric mean (GM) PbB was 2.0 \u00b5g/dL (geometric standard\nerror = 1.0). Age of child, race/ethnicity, serum cotinine concentration, poverty-to-income ratio,\ncountry of birth, year of building construction, floor PbD by floor surface and condition, windowsill\nPbD, presence of deteriorated paint, home-apartment type, smoking in the home, and recent renova-\ntion were significant predictors in either the linear model [the proportion of variability in the depen-\ndent variable accounted for by the model (R2) = 40%] or logistic model for 10 \u00b5g/dL (R2 = 5%). At\nfloor PbD = 12 \u00b5g/ft2, the models predict that 4.6% of children living in homes constructed before\nConclusions: Lowering the floor PbD standard below the current standard of 40 \u00b5g/ft2 would\nprotect more children from elevated PbB.\nKey words: blood lead, dust lead, housing, lead poisoning, National Health and Nutrition\nChildren's blood lead levels and dust lead\nthe analysis of the influence of floor PbD on\nChild, household, and housing character-\nistics. NHANES interviewers collected data\non age, race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic\nmeasures [family and household income and\npoverty-to-income ratio (PIR)], and other\nself-reported health data through a struc-\ntured household interview. Participants\nself-reported their race and ethnicity. In this\nanalysis, we used a composite race/ethnic-\nity variable: non-Hispanic white, non-His-\npanic black, Hispanic, or other race. These\nvariables, as well as the housing characteris-\ntic variables, are described in the compan-\nion article. The PIR is the ratio of income\nto the family's poverty threshold (Office of\nues < 1.00 are below the poverty threshold,\nwhereas PIR values of  1.00 indicate income\nabove the poverty level. Variables on smoking\nbehavior included the presence of smoking in\nthe home, number of smokers, and the num-\nber of cigarettes smoked in the home per day.\nDuring their visit to the mobile examina-\ntion center, NHANES participants provided\nvenous blood samples, which were analyzed\nfor PbB, serum cotinine, ferritin, iron, and\ntotal iron binding capacity.\nNHANES measured PbB using graphite\nfurnace atomic absorption spectro\nphotometry.\nThe laboratory detection limit (DL) was 0.3\n\u00b5g/dL. Only 0.23% of the sample results were\nbelow the DL. The DLs for cotinine were\n2002, there was a mixture of these two DLs.\nTwenty-six percent of the cotinine samples\nwere below the DL. For all NHANES labora-\ntory measurements, results below the DL were\nassigned the value of DL/\n\u00ad\nStatistical methods. Data were ana-\nlyzed using SUDAAN (version 9.0.0; RTI\nInternational, Research Triangle Park, NC)\nand SAS (SAS System for Windows, version\n9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). We used\na linear regression model to predict natural\nlog-transformed PbB and logistic regression\nmodels to predict the probability that a child's\nPbB exceeded either 5 or 10 \u00b5g/dL. The mod-\nels adjusted the parameter estimates for the\nclustering and unequal survey weights within\nNHANES. The modeling employed Taylor\nseries expansion theory without degrees of\nfreedom adjustments. Backward elimina-\ntion of insignificant independent variables\n(p > 0.10) was followed by additional steps to\nallow addition and/or removal of variables. To\nprovide an accurate prediction of children's\nPbB without eliminating large fractions of the\nstudy sample because of missing values, we fit\nan intercept term for each variable that had a\nmissing value. The overall p-value is the type 3\nF-test that captures the overall statistical\nsignificance of each variable included in the\nmodel. For categorical variables with missing\nvalues, the missing level was not included in\nthis hypothesis test.\nBecause NHANES collected serum\ncotinine only for children  3 years of age,\nmany more children had questionnaire-based\nsmoking data available than serum cotinine\nmeasurements. Therefore, we gave question-\nnaire-based smoking variables priority over\nmeasured serum cotinine levels.\nGeometric mean (GM) PbB peaks\nbetween 18 and 36 months of age and slowly\ndeclines over the next few years, with the\nrate of decline varying in different popula-\nWasserman et al. 1997). Based on the rela-\ntionships between age and PbB observed in\nthese studies, we determined that a quartic\nfunction of age of the child fit best.\nAlthough most other analyses of the rela-\ntionship between log PbB and log floor PbD\nwere based on a linear relationship, the rela-\ntionship may not be linear across the relatively\nlow ranges observed in NHANES (Lanphear\ntigate this further, we analyzed other data sets:\nthe National Evaluation of the HUD Lead-\nBased Paint Hazard Control Grant Program\n(the Evaluation) (Galke et al. 2001; HUD\nand the HUD National Risk Assessment Study\n(the RA Study) (Wilson et al. 2007). For each\nof these data sets and NHANES, we predicted\nlog-PbB based on a cubic function of log floor\nPbD for children < 6 years of age (Table 1).\nThe NHANES model accounted for clustering\nand unequal survey weights.\nWe predicted PbB at different PbD levels\nfor children living in homes built before 1978\nwhile controlling for other predictors of PbB\nusing the aforementioned linear and logis-\ntic regression models and the population-\nweighted averages of covariates (except floor\nand sill PbD). For categorical variables, the\nlevels were weighted according to their pop-\nulation-weighted relative frequency distribu-\ntion.

Although the mod-\nels to predict log-PbB based on a cubic func-\ntion of log floor PbD indicated that the cubic\nterms are not significant for two of the three\ndata sets (the HUD Evaluation and Rochester),\nthe quadratic terms were significant for all\nfour data sets (Table 1).

Differences in the effect of\nPbD on PbB for uncarpeted smooth and clean-\nable, low-pile carpet and high-pile carpet were\nnot significant, so these surfaces/conditions\nwere combined.

Although most of the variables\nthat were significant in the linear regres-\nsion model were also significant in the 5 \u00b5g/\ndL logistic regression model, the 10 \u00b5g/dL\nlogistic regression model identified fewer sig-\nnificant predictors. The proportion of vari-\nability in the dependent variable accounted\nfor by the model (R2) for the 5 \u00b5g/dL and\n10 \u00b5g/dL logistic models were much lower\nthan for the linear model (16% and 5% vs.\n40%, respectively). This result was attribut-\nable to the loss of information from using the\ndichotomous PbB outcomes in the logistic\nregression models and to the small number of\nchildren observed with PbB  10 \u00b5g/dL.

The odds of having a PbB\n 5 \u00b5g/dL were more than three times higher\nfor children living in pre-1950 housing with\nrenovation than for children living in other\nhomes (OR = 3.33). The odds of having a\nPbB  10 \u00b5g/dL were more than three times\nhigher for children living in pre-1950 housing\nwith deteriorated paint inside than for chil-\ndren living in other homes (OR = 3.53).\nFloor PbD thresholds. Table 6 presents\nthe model predictions for average children\nliving in a pre-1978 home for a range of\nfloor PbD after controlling for the covariates\ndescribed above. At a floor PbD of 6 \u00b5g/ft2,\nthe models predict that 2.7% of children have\ndL, and that the GM PbB is 3.4 \u00b5g/dL. When\nfloor PbD is 12 \u00b5g/ft2, the models predict\nthat 4.6% of children have PbB  10 \u00b5g/dL\nand 26.8% have PbB  5 \u00b5g/dL, and that the\nGM PbB is 3.9 \u00b5g/dL. The upper bound of\nthe 90% confidence interval (CI) for a predic-\ntion approximates the 95% upper bound for\nthe prediction. For example, when floor PbD\nthat PbB is  10 \u00b5g/dL is between 2.7 and\n7.9%. This means that we are approximately\n95% confident that the probability that PbB\n 10 \u00b5g/dL is < 7.9%. The information pre-\nsented assumes that floor PbD is equal to the\nspecified value. If floor PbD is less than the\nspecified value, the predicted GM PbB and\nprobabilities would be lower than those in\nDiscussion\nmonths of age in the United States between\nstudy analyzing NHANES data collected\nhad PbB  10 \u00b5g/dL (Bernard and McGeehin\nper thousand had PbB  5 \u00b5g/dL.

(Cowan et al. 2006). This finding\nmay reflect continued use of lead-containing\nitems imported from Mexico (e.g., pottery,\nfoods, folk medicine) by families that recently\nresided there. Research has documented that\nuse of these items can result in elevated PbB\nAdditionally, our study supports the asso-\nciation between PbB and renovation and floor\nand sill PbD, as expected. Other studies have\nshown that renovation activities can influence\nfloor PbD (Reissman et al. 2002) and that\nfloor PbD is a strong predictor of a child's\nThe U.S. EPA (2008) recently promulgated a\nregulation intended to control lead exposures\nfrom renovation.\nThe rate of change in PbB with respect to\nfloor PbD levels observed in this most recent\nNHANES analysis is similar to that found\nin three other studies analyzed here: the\nEvaluation, the RA Study, and the Rochester\nStudy (Table 1). These other data sets are\nfrom higher-risk populations and therefore\nhave higher PbD and PbB levels. The simi-\nlarities in the PbB/PbD slope in the different\nstudies indicate that it is reasonable to use the\nNHANES data to make inferences at higher\nfloor PbD and PbB.\nThe current federal floor PbD standard\nof 40 \u00b5g/ft2 was established based on pre-\n1995 data from the Rochester Lead-in-Dust\nStudy and a pooled analysis of 12 older epide-\nmiologic studies using slightly different meth-\nmost of the studies comprising the pooled\nanalysis were based on high-risk children and\nhousing.

In\nthe U.S. EPA analysis, the floor standard of\n40 \u00b5g/ft2 was established jointly with stan-\ndards for lead in windowsill dust, soil, and\ninterior paint to protect at least 95% of chil-\ndren 12\u00ad30 months of age from developing a\nPbB  10 \u00b5g/dL when the windowsill and soil\nlead standards were also met (U.S. EPA 1998,\ndard was based on protecting children from\ndeveloping high PbB (i.e., PbB  10 \u00b5g/dL\nTable 5.

In\nfact, these new data made the logistic model\nto predict PbB  10 \u00b5g/dL problematic,\nwere  10 \u00b5g/dL. Consequently, the percent\nof variation (R2) explained by the predictors\nin the 10 \u00b5g/dL logistic model was much\nlower than that of the linear model (R2 = 5%\nvs. R2 = 40%). We present the logistic regres-\nsion model for 5 \u00b5g/dL because no other PbB\nthresholds have regulatory significance, and\n(2008) suggest that the threshold for elevated\nPbB may be lowered from 10 to 5 \u00b5g/dL and\nexamines the impact of this reduction.\nNHANES collected both health and\nenvironmental data from a nationally repre-\nsentative sample of children between 12 and\n60 months of age; however, the NHANES\ndata are not necessarily representative of the\nU.S. housing stock. Iqbal and collaborators\na large number of children 1\u00ad5 years of age\nin NHANES (16.3%) had missing PbB val-\nues. Non-Hispanic white children, homeown-\ners, and children from households with high\nincome levels and with health insurance had a\nhigher percentage of missing PbB values. This\nmay have inflated the estimates of GM PbB\nand overestimated the prevalence of PbB  5\n\u00b5g/dL and PbB  10 \u00b5g/dL.\nIn addition, NHANES collected only a\nsingle floor PbD measurement in each house.\nAlthough the single measurement was from\nthe room in which the children spent the\nmost time, the average of several floor dust\nsamples would likely provide a more precise\nestimate of a child's total exposure.\nIn this article we examined PbB across\na range of floor PbD. An analysis of expo-\nsure pathways found that floor PbD has a\ndirect effect on children's PbB, whereas sill\nPbD has an indirect effect on children's PbB\nthe NHANES data analyzed in this article,\nfloor PbD is more predictive of PbB than\nfor sills; R2 = 23.0% for floors and sills com-\nbined). When floor PbD = 12 \u00b5g/ft2, we show\nthat 4.6% of children have PbB  10 \u00b5g/dL\n(Table 6). Based on the logistic model for\nPbD = 90 \u00b5g/ft2, and other covariates are at\ntheir national averages, the model predicts\nthat 95% of children have PbB < 10 \u00b5g/dL.\nIf homes have floor PbD below 12 \u00b5g/ft2 and\nsill PbD below 90 \u00b5g/ft2, less than 5% of chil-\ndren would have PbB  10 \u00b5g/dL.\nThe national estimate of the GM floor\ndata from high-risk houses in the HUD evalu-\nation study showed that PbD on floors contin-\nued to decline after the intervention, dropping\nfrom a GM of 14 \u00b5g/ft2 immediately after\nintervention to a GM of only 4.8 \u00b5g/ft2 6 years\nafter hazard control (Wilson et al. 2006).\nTogether, these data demonstrate that floor\nPbD is well below the current federal standard\nof  40 \u00b5g/ft2 for the vast majority of houses.\nHistorically, allowable PbD levels have\ndeclined as research has progressed. In the\nearly 1990s, Maryland enacted a floor PbD\nstandard of  200 \u00b5g/ft2 (Code of Maryland\nlowering the floor PbD level to  100 \u00b5g/ft2,\nmulgated a floor PbD standard of  40 \u00b5g/ft2,\nwhich has remained unchanged. Our find-\nings suggest that floor and windowsill PbD\nshould be kept as low as possible. Levels\nof PbD on floors between 6 \u00b5g/ft2 and\n12 \u00b5g/ft2 can be expected to protect most\nchildren living in pre-1978 homes from hav-\ning PbB  10 \u00b5g/dL. Protection at lower PbB\nwould require lower PbD.\nCorrection\nThe values given in the first sentence of\n\"Results\" were incorrect in the original\nmanuscript published online.
