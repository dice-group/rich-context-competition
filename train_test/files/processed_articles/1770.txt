Our objective was to assess the test performance\nof A1C against single and repeat glucose measurements for diagnosis of prevalent diabetes and\nfor prediction of incident diabetes.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We conducted population-based analyses of\n12,485 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and a subpopu-\nlation of 691 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) with repeat test results.\nRESULTS -- Against a single fasting glucose 126 mg/dl, the sensitivity and specificity of\nA1C 6.5% for detection of prevalent diabetes were 47 and 98%, respectively (area under the\ncurve 0.892). Against repeated fasting glucose (3 years apart) 126 mg/dl, sensitivity improved\nto 67% and specificity remained high (97%) (AUC 0.936). Similar results were obtained in\nNHANES III against repeated fasting glucose 2 weeks apart. The accuracy of A1C was consistent\nacross age, BMI, and race groups. For individuals with fasting glucose 126 mg/dl and A1C\n6.5% at baseline, the 10-year risk of diagnosed diabetes was 88% compared with 55% among\nCONCLUSIONS -- A1C performs well as a diagnostic tool when diabetes definitions that\nmost closely resemble those used in clinical practice are used as the \"gold standard.\" The high\nrisk of diabetes among individuals with both elevated fasting glucose and A1C suggests a dual\nrole for fasting glucose and A1C for prediction of diabetes.\nAlthough A1C is now recommended\nfor the diagnosis of diabetes (1,2),\nits precise test performance is un-\ncertain. The lack of a single, clear \"gold\nstandard\" poses a challenge for determin-\ning the performance of A1C. Previous di-\nagnostic studies of A1C have relied\nexclusively on a single elevated fasting or\n2-h glucose values as gold standards (3\u00ad\n5). However, because glucose determina-\ntions are inherently more variable than\nA1C (6), these convenient gold standards\nare likely to reduce the apparent accuracy\nof A1C as a diagnostic test. A stronger\ngold standard would rely on repeated glu-\ncose determinations on different days (2),\ni.e., the recommended approach to diag-\nnosis of diabetes in clinical practice. Al-\nternatively, A1C and fasting glucose can\nbe compared head-to-head against the\nsubsequent development of clinically di-\nagnosed diabetes as the gold standard.\nWe hypothesized that 1) A1C would per-\nform well as a diagnostic and prognostic\ntest for diabetes across its full range and at\nthe American Diabetes Association\u00ad\nrecommended threshold of 6.5% and 2)\nthat its performance would be best when\njudged against stronger, most clinically\nrelevant gold standards.\nMETHODS\nAtherosclerosis risk in communities\nstudy\nThe Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities\n(ARIC) study is a community-based co-\nfrom four U.S. communities.

Oral\nglucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were\nonly performed on individuals who were\nexaminations; all analyses of 2-h glucose\nmeasurements were limited to the smaller\nsample of individuals with valid OGTT\nMeasurement of glucose and A1C\nIn the ARIC study, serum glucose was\nmeasured from blood collected at each\nvisit using the hexokinase method. We\nthawed and assayed frozen whole blood\nsamples collected at ARIC study visit 2\nusing high-performance liquid chroma-\nporation, Tokyo, Japan) (standardized to\nthe Diabetes Control and Complications\nTrial [DCCT] assay) (11). Because A1C\ndata are only available at visit 2 in the\nARIC study, this was used as the baseline\nexamination in the present study.\nIn addition to plasma glucose mea-\nsurements, the NHANES III examination\nincluded a 2-h 75-g OGTT in adults aged\nobtained using the Diamat high-\nperformance liquid chromatography as-\nsay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) (standardized\nto the DCCT assay). Because variant he-\nmoglobins can interfere with A1C mea-\nsurement by the Diamat assay, samples\nwith evidence of interference were reana-\nlyzed by affinity chromatography. The\nNHANES III repeat examinations were\nconducted approximately 2 weeks after\nthe first examination by trained personnel\nfollowing the same standardized proto-\ncols (6). Detailed information on data col-\nlection and laboratory procedures in\nNHANES III are described elsewhere\nPrevalent undiagnosed diabetes\nIn the ARIC and NHANES III studies, we\nused the repeat glucose values available to\ncompare different definitions of prevalent\nundiagnosed diabetes (Table 2). In the\nARIC study, we generated two principle\ndefinitions of prevalent diabetes (defini-\ntion 1: a single fasting glucose value 126\nmg/dl at baseline [visit 2]; and definition\ntwo separate examinations). In the ARIC\nstudy, the two fasting glucose measure-\nments took place at the clinical examina-\ntions that were 3 years apart. In the\nNHANES III subpopulation, the two clin-\nical examinations took place 2 weeks\napart (mean 17 days). In the NHANES III\nsubpopulation, we also examined indi-\nviduals with undiagnosed diabetes de-\nfined by single and repeat 2-h glucose\nIncident diabetes in the ARIC study\nOn-going longitudinal follow-up of ARIC\nstudy participants also provided us the\nopportunity to assess the performance of\nbaseline A1C for classification of incident\ndiabetes. We used two definitions of inci-\ndent diabetes: a visit-based definition\n(definition A) and an interview-based def-\ninition (definition B). For definition A, we\nused a standard time-to-diabetes defini-\ntion based on glucose measurements, self-\nreported diagnosis, or medication use for\na maximum of 6 years of follow-up (14).\nFor definition B, we used self-reported in-\nformation on diabetes diagnosis and\nmedication use during the visits and sub-\nsequent annual telephone calls for a max-\nStatistical analyses\nWe examined population characteristics\nby diagnostic categories of A1C (6.5%\nand 6.5%) among individuals without a\nhistory of diagnosed diabetes in the ARIC\nand NHANES III populations. We calcu-\nlated the sensitivity, specificity, and posi-\ntive and negative likelihood ratios at all\ncutoffs of A1C for each definition of prev-\nalent and incident diabetes. We calcu-\nlated the area under the receiver operator\ncharacteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for\nA1C overall and by subgroups of the\npopulation in the ARIC study only (the\nsample size for the NHANES III subpopu-\nlation was insufficient for subgroup anal-\nethnicity (white or African American),\n30 kg/m2). We also conducted sensitiv-\nity analyses in individuals with anemia.\nWe used data from the ARIC study to es-\ntimate the subsequent risk of diabetes\nduring follow-up (15). Using the Kaplan-\nMeier method, we estimated the 10-year\ncumulative incidence of diagnosed diabe-\ntes according to clinical categories of\nbaseline fasting glucose and A1C.\nRESULTS -- The characteristics of the\nstudy populations by A1C 6.5% and\n6.5% are shown in Table 1.

We observed that those with\nhigh A1C but without elevated fasting\nglucose had a lower incidence of diag-\nnosed diabetes than those meeting both\nthe glucose and A1C criteria. Such results\nsuggest a dual role for A1C and glucose\nfor the prediction of diabetes.\nNew guidelines for the use of A1C for\nthe diagnosis of diabetes recommend that\nan elevated A1C or fasting glucose or\nOGTT results be confirmed on a second\noccasion or that the diagnosis be con-\nfirmed by a different test on the same oc-\ncasion. Analyses of short-term (6) and\nlong-term reliability (17) have demon-\nstrated that A1C is significantly less vari-\nable than fasting glucose or 2-h glucose.\nOur data suggest an A1C 6.5% con-\nfirmed by a fasting glucose 126 mg/dl\non the same occasion has a high positive\npredictive value (88%) for 10-year diabe-\ntes risk. We observed a substantial risk of\ndiagnosed diabetes at high levels of A1C\nregardless of the baseline fasting glucose\nlevel, consistent with previous analyses of\nthese data (15). However, the observed\ndiabetes risk among individuals in discor-\ndant A1C and fasting glucose risk catego-\nries suggests the utility of using both A1C\nand fasting glucose to reduce misclassifi-\ncation and accurately identify individuals\nat risk of future diabetes.\nAn A1C cut point of 6.5% is highly\nspecific but has low sensitivity for the\nidentification of prevalent undiagnosed\ndiabetes by these definitions. The low\nsensitivity of A1C does not necessarily\nmean that A1C has poor test perfor-\nmance; it may be that A1C is more appro-\npriately distinguishing those individuals\nat risk for subsequent complications. Rec-\nommendations for use of A1C for diagno-\nsis, monitoring glycemic control, and\nguiding therapy in diabetes are largely\nbased on the association of A1C with\nlong-term microvascular outcomes (2).\nEpidemiological studies have also dem-\nonstrated associations among A1C and\nrisk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease,\nand all-cause mortality in nondiabetic in-\ndividuals (15), with substantial increases\nin risk observed at A1C values 6.0%.\nProspective epidemiological data demon-\nstrate that A1C is a stronger predictor of\nvascular complications than fasting glu-\nAs has been shown in previous stud-\nmore likely to have elevated A1C values\nthan whites. Nonetheless, we did not ob-\nserve substantial racial differences in the\noverall performance of A1C for the iden-\ntification or prediction of diabetes.\nThis study highlights a weakness in\nthe literature related to diabetes diagno-\nsis: the lack of confirmatory glucose test-\ning to replicate the typical clinical\nscenario in which multiple tests are con-\nducted before a diagnosis is made. In\nstudies with no confirmatory testing, A1C\nwill seem to miss a proportion of fasting\nglucose-defined cases of diabetes. This is\npartly a function of the short-term vari-\nability in fasting glucose. When repeat\ntesting is used, this discordance is re-\nduced. We have shown previously that\nA1C has substantially lower within-\nperson variability compared with fasting\nand 2-h glucose (6). Whereas repeating\nfasting glucose tests can substantially\nreduce misclassification, the high reliabil-\nity of A1C suggests that a single measure-\nment is sufficient for diagnostic\nclassification unless laboratory error or\ninterference is suspected.\nFor diabetes and other asymptomatic\nconditions that are clinically defined,\ndiagnostic testing studies should use\nmultiple reference standards, ideally em-\nphasizing those that most closely replicate\nthe clinical setting. Previous studies have\nhighlighted the low sensitivity of A1C for\ndetecting diabetes defined by a single fast-\ning or 2-h glucose measurement\nproved performance of A1C compared\nwith stronger gold standards that relied\non repeated glucose determinations on\ndifferent days.\nA number of limitations of this study\nshould be considered. This study was not\na traditional diagnostic testing study, and\nwe did not conduct a head-to-head com-\nparison of the accuracy of glucose com-\npared with A1C; for this, a third reference\nstandard would be needed. The small\nnumber of cases of diabetes by any defi-\nnition among participants in the\nNHANES III subsample resulted in im-\nprecision of our estimates and prevented\nfurther subgroup analyses in this popula-\ntion. We also did not have information on\n2-h glucose at the time of A1C measure-\nment in the ARIC study. Nonetheless, the\nARIC study is one of the largest U.S. co-\nFigure 1--Area under the ROC curve for A1C (%) for the detection of glucose-based definitions of\ndiabetes, the ARIC study (n  12,485), adults without a history of diagnosed diabetes. ----, ROC\ncurve for definition 1 (fasting glucose 126 mg/dl at baseline), AUC 0.892; \u00ad \u00ad \u00ad, ROC curve for\ndefinition 2 (fasting glucose 126 mg/dl on two separate occasions, 3 years apart), AUC 0.936.\nSelvin and Associates\nhort studies of A1C with information on\nthe development of diabetes. The addi-\ntional analyses of NHANES demonstrated\nconsistency across populations and al-\nlowed us to examine definitions of diabe-\ntes based on short-term repeat glucose\nmeasurements (weeks apart).\nIn summary, we found that A1C per-\nforms best when more stringent glucose\ncriteria are used to define diabetes (i.e.,\nfasting glucose 126 mg/dl on two\nseparate occasions), similar to clinical\npractice. Our data support current rec-\nommendations for use of A1C in the di-\nagnosis of diabetes and demonstrate that\nan A1C cutoff of 6.5% is highly specific\nand may be reasonably sensitive in the\ncontext of evidence linking A1C to risk of\nlong-term microvascular and macrovas-\ncular outcomes in nondiabetic adults. We\nalso found that A1C and fasting glucose\nboth strongly predict subsequent risk of\ndiagnosed diabetes, but the very high risk\nobserved for individuals with both ele-\nvated fasting glucose and A1C suggests a\ndual role for fasting glucose and A1C for\nprediction of diabetes.\n"
