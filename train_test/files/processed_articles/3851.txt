According to Beer and Moneta\n(2010), \"the adaptive use of object and metacognitive modes\nrequires metacognitive beliefs of an agentic type that support\nidentification of alternative pathways and flexible goal\nrestructuring\" (p. 978). Moreover, the authors propose that\nsuch adaptive metacognitive beliefs require meta-emotions\nof interest and curiosity in an individual's own emotional\nresponses to challenging situations.\nBeer and Moneta (2010) identified adaptive metacognitive\nbeliefs that foster success in facing challenging situations\namong highly self-regulated and resilient individuals.\nThematic analysis revealed three main metacognitive factors\nthat helped them to manage challenges successfully: aware-\nness of the need to free attention resources and experience\npositive emotions, confidence in interpreting emotions as cues\nthat help to solve the problem, and confidence in setting a\nsequence of goals even in long-term hierarchies that make suc-\ncess plausible. The latter means that a person is able to system-\natize the hierarchy of goals--from elementary to final ones.\nFurther analysis permitted constructing the Positive\nMetacognitions and Positive Meta-Emotions Questionnaire\n(PMCEQ; Beer & Moneta, 2010). Beer and Moneta clearly\nsupport the three-factor structure of the PMCEQ in two\nindependent studies. Factor 1 is called the \"Confidence in\nExtinguishing Perseverative Thoughts and Emotions\" with\nitems such as \"I tend to overreact when things are really going\nwrong\" (reversed). Factor 2, named \"Interpreting Own\nEmotions as Cues, Restraining From Immediate Reaction, and\nMind Setting for Problem Solving\" was assessed via items\nsuch as \"I can stop any `negative thinking spirals'and focus on\nwhat I can do in the situation.\" Factor 3, called \"Confidence in\nInterpreting Own Emotions as Cues, Restraining From\nImmediate Reaction, and Mind Setting for Problem Solving,\"\nwas represented by items such as \"If I were overwhelmed by a\nbig task, I would stop and take smaller steps.\"\nBeer and Moneta (2010) not only produced the clear fac-\ntorial structure of the instrument but also provided an\nassessment of the concurrent validity of the PMCEQ. Each\nof the three factors of the PMCEQ was negatively corre-\nlated with the five factors of the Maladaptive Metacognitions\nQuestionnaire (MCQ-30) developed by Wells and Cartwright-\nHatton (2004). Moreover the three factors of the PMCEQ\ncorrelated positively with intrinsic motivation, but they cor-\nrelated negatively with extrinsic motivation (Work Preference\n1University of Gdansk, Poland\nCorresponding Author:\nRoman Konarski, University of Gdansk, ul.

To this end, we\nexamined the factor structure of the Polish version of the\nPMCEQ, and we hypothesized the exact three-factor struc-\nture of the original PMCEQ (Beer & Moneta, 2010). We\nextended our analysis of construct validity by establishing\nconvergent validity with a popular Big Five measure: the\nInternational Personality Item Pool - Big Five Markers - 20\non Goldberg, 1992), and the Neuroticism-Extraversion-\nOpeness Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO-PI-R; Costa\nWe also aimed to examine the reliability and concurrent\nvalidity of the instrument. This was done by correlating the\nthree factors of PMCEQ with another adaptive metacogni-\ntive measure (Metacognitive Self Questionnaire [MSQ-24],\nBrycz & Konarski, 2016) and another maladaptive metacog-\nThe metacognitive-self pertains to accurate knowledge\nabout an individual's own biases and psychological regu-\nlarities that foster self-regulation, such as pathetic illusion\nsocial learning theory (Bandura, 1977), the perception of\nnonverbal behavior (Argyle, 1991), and others. Each psy-\nchological law, or bias, is presented in an episodic way, for\nexample, for positivity bias \"I tend to judge other people\npositively rather than negatively.\" The MSQ-24 measures\naccurate self-insight in an individual's own biased behavior.\nA person acquires this specific kind of insight while think-\ning about his or her own biased behavior and experiencing,\neven at first glance, negative emotions. An individual with a\nhighly developed metacognitive-self accepts, over time,\nbiases or psychological regularities as immanent aspects of\nhuman behavior. Thanks to a high degree of metacognitive\nself-insight, an individual is more persistent in the face of\nchallenge, accepts uncontrollability (Brycz, Jurek, Pastwa-\nWojciechowska, Pepliska, & Bidzan, 2014), and exhibits\nbetter self-regulatory functions (Brycz, Wyszomirska-G\u00f3ra,\nBar-Tal, & Wisniewski, 2014). However, there is no correla-\ntion between MSQ-24 and self-esteem (Rosenberg & Gara,\n1985). We hypothesize either a negative correlation or a lack\nthereof between PMCEQ Factor 1 and MCQ-24. If our sup-\npositions are true, this might result from the necessity of\nengaging in perseverative thoughts or negative emotions as\nthe first step of accurate self-insight knowledge acquisition.\nMCQ-24 allows for better goal attainment and flexibility of\nbehavior in concordance with current affect, while current\naffect is treated as a cue in concordance with the meaning of\nPMCEQ Factor 2. Moreover, because we know that a higher\nmetacognitive-self fosters self-regulation and goal attain-\nment, we hypothesize a positive correlation between\nPMCEQ Factors 2 and 3 (mind setting for problem solving)\nOur further suppositions are related to correlations\nbetween five factors of the MCQ-30 and the three of the\nwas created to measure maladaptive metacognition. Results\nof numerous studies (Wells, 2009; Yilmaz, Gencoz, & Wells,\n2011) indicate that negative beliefs about worry concerning\nuncontrollability of thoughts and danger, and cognitive\nresource limitations are crucial for Cognitive-Attentional\nSyndrome (CAS). Moreover, the results of these studies\nshow that positive beliefs about worry and the need to con-\ntrol thoughts are strong predictors of both anxiety and\ndepression. The MCQ-30 consists of the five following fac-\ntors: (a) cognitive confidence that measures confidence\nregarding beliefs about the need to control attention and\nmemory, (b) positive beliefs about worry that measures the\ntendency of a person to monitor his or her own thoughts and\nfocus attention inward, (c) cognitive self-consciousness that\nmeasures the extent to which a person thinks that persevera-\ntive thinking is useful, (d) negative beliefs about the uncon-\ntrollability of thoughts and danger that assesses the extent to\nwhich a person thinks that perseverative thinking is uncon-\ntrollable and dangerous, and (e) beliefs about the need to\ncontrol thoughts that assesses the extent to which a person\nbelieves that certain types of thoughts need to be suppressed.\nIn accordance with the results of Beer and Moneta (2010),\nwe expect the same negative correlations between MCQ-30\nversion--Dragan & Dragan, 2011) and the three PMCEQ\nfactors in the Polish population.\nMoreover, it is plausible to predict positive correlations\nbetween the three PMCEQ factors and at least two of the\nIPIP-BFM-20 factors of conscientiousness and emotional\nstability, which are personality traits that favor personal and\nprofessional success.\nMethod\nParticipants\nA nationally representative sample of n = 600 adult Poles\nbetween the ages of 17 and 85 participated in the study.\nyears, SD = 17.10 years).

Each fac-\ntor is measured by six items with a four-point response scale:\n1 = do not agree, 2 = agree slightly, 3 = agree moderately, and\n4 = agree strongly. The questionnaire was translated to Polish\nand then back-translated into English by an individual not\npreviously involved in the translation process.

Responses\nfollowed a six-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (defi-\nnitely not) to 6 (definitely yes).\nThePolishversionoftheMetacognitionsQuestionnaire\u00ad30\nHatton & Wells, 1997) developed to assess five correlated\nmetacognitive factors: (a) cognitive confidence, (b) positive\nbeliefs about worry, (c) cognitive self-consciousness, (d)\nnegative beliefs about uncontrollability of thoughts and dan-\nger, and (e) beliefs about need to control thoughts.

Each factor\nis measured by four items with a five-point response scale\nranging from 1 (completely inaccurate as a self-description)\nto 5 (completely accurate as a self-description).\nResults\nPsychometric Analyses\nThe first task in the current study was to confirm the con-\nstruct validity of the PMCEQ in the Polish population. The\nthree-factor structure developed by Beer and Moneta (2010)\nfor the PMCEQ was evaluated by confirmatory factor analy-\nsis (CFA) for discrete indicators using LISREL 8.8 (J\u00f6reskog\n& S\u00f6rbom, 2006). The CFA model was tested using the\nrobust (diagonally) weighted least squares estimator with a\npolychoric correlation matrix. Because the value of the chi-\nsquare model-fit test statistic is inflated by large sample size,\nfit was also assessed using three widely used indices of fit:\nthe root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the\ncomparative fit index (CFI), and the adjusted goodness of fit\nindex (AGFI).\nPrior to the assessment of convergent validity, the reli-\nability of the measures was estimated. It is widely known\nthat traditional internal consistency reliability indices such as\nCronbach's alpha underestimate reliability when items are\nnot essentially tau equivalent (when they have unequal factor\nloadings; Graham, 2006) or when the item response scale is\nnot continuous (Gadermann, Guhn, & Zumbo, 2012). As the\nassumption of tau equivalence is unlikely to hold for our\nmeasures and the item response scales are ordinal, we uti-\nlized internal consistency reliability based on nonlinear CFA\nutilizing polychoric correlations.\nConcurrent validity was assessed by correlating the three\nsubscale scores of the PMCEQ with measures of related\nmetacognitive constructs (MSQ-24, MCQ-30), whereas con-\nvergent validity was assessed by correlating the three sub-\nscores of the PMCEQ with five personality factors\nTesting the PMCEQ Factor Structure in the\nPolish Population\nPrior to performing the statistical analyses of the PMCEQ,\nthe direction of the response scale of the six items of the first\nfactor (Item 1 to Item 6) was reversed to be congruent with\nthe remaining items.

However alternative goodness-of-fit\nmeasures indicated acceptable fit (RMSEA = 0.043, CFI =\ntheir standard errors are shown in Table 1, which indicates\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 2.

Moreover, as expected, the two remaining\nfactors of the PMCEQ--PMCEQ-F2 and PMCEQ-F3--show\nrelatively high positive correlations with MSQ-24 and the five\nDiscussion\nWe demonstrated construct validity and acceptable measure-\nment reliability for the PMCEQ (Beer & Moneta, 2010) in a\nnationally representative sample of Poles.

As can be\nseen in Table 3, all five factors of the MCQ-30 negatively\ncorrelated with the three factors of the PMCEQ, which indi-\ncates the difference between maladaptive (MCQ-30) and\nadaptive (PMCEQ) metacognition. The more participants\nwere immersed in positive meta-emotions and thoughts\nTable 1.

Both Factors 2 and 3 are more associated with cogni-\ntion, social cognition, and rational thinking about self-regula-\ntion and goal pursuit in the face of challenging circumstances.\nThe MSQ-24 is also a good indicator of the adaptive metacog-\nnition. However, the MSQ-24 was not created to assess emo-\ntions. Positive meta-emotions embedded in Factor 1 of the\nPMCEQ correlated negatively with the MSQ-24. The\ndirection of the correlation obtained was as predicted. It is\nevidence based that a person who tries to acquire accurate\nknowledge about his or her own biases has to experience a\nlong process during which negative emotions about his or her\nbehavior are balanced by the acceptance of his or her social\nbehavior as typical behavior of human beings. However, once\na person possessed high metacognitive self-knowledge, she\nor he has the self-regulation ability to foster goal pursuit and\nto undertake challenges.\nConvergent validity was assessed by correlating the\nPMCEQ factors with the Big Five (IPIP-BFM-20) personality\nfactors. As predicted, the PMCEQ factors correlated positively\nwith the conscientiousness and emotional stability factors.\nEmotional stability correlates highly with all three PMCEQ\nfactors. Conscientiousness correlates positively with PMCEQ\nFactors 2 and 3. The positive correlations found between\nPMCEQ Factors 2 and 3, and extraversion, agreeableness, and\nintellect of the IPIP-BFM-20 seem very interesting. The IPIP-\nBFM-20 recognizes extraversion as a trait in which cordiality\nplays an important role (Ashton & Lee, 2001). A similar\napproach to agreeableness saturates the trait in question more\nwith morality and modesty. Positive emotions embedded in\nextraversion and agreeableness are in concordance with Beer\nand Moneta's (2010) understanding of the adaptive and posi-\ntive role of meta-emotions. Moreover, intellect/imagination\npositively correlates with the three PMCEQ factors.\nThe results suggest that the Polish version of PMCEQ has\ngood psychometric properties, and it appears to be a valid\nand reliable instrument for research in the area of adaptive\nmetacognition.\nHopefully, the Polish version of the PMCEQ will help\nresearchers in further inquiries on the role of metacognition\nand adaptive positive meta-emotions in prohealth behavior\nand goal attainment, and in general adaptive behavior.\nMetacognition is one of the most studied psychological phe-\nnomena, and it is crucial to distinguish the positive role of\nmetacognition (PMCEQ) from the maladaptive (MCQ-30).\nTable 3.
