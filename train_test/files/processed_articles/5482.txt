    "abstract": "Abstract\nMangroves thrive in the intertidal areas (interface between land and sea) of tropical and sub-tropical belt and play an\nimportant role in overall attenuation of nearshore waves. Multiple interactions of waves with mangrove trunks and\nroots and bottom friction are the two primary mechanisms responsible for wave attenuation in mangrove forests.\nEarlier studies, comprising both analytical and experimental, reported an exponential decay in wave height for waves\npropagating over vegetation with idealized bottom topography and a few on sloping bottom. But hardly studies have\nattempted to characterize the wave attenuation by vegetation over varying seabed slopes since mangroves generally\ngrow luxuriantly on gradual topography having large tidal amplitudes. Nowadays, several studies are being carried out on\ndevelopment of artificial mangroves to reduce the coastal hazard risks; thenceforth, there is an imperative requirement\nto study the wave damping characteristics of mangroves on varying seabed slopes. Consequently, this study performs\nsensitivity experiments to analyze the wave attenuation over mangroves with different sea-bottom slopes using a third-\ngeneration wave model. The study exposes sensitivity of wave attenuation characteristics to different beach slopes in\nthe presence of mangroves and aims at understanding how the wave attenuation characteristics by mangroves differ\nwith varying bottom slopes. The total percentage energy reduction for waves reaching the shoreline after propagating\nslope (1:10). The study reveals that the wave height decays exponentially for the mild slope and found to be consistent\nwith the earlier studies, but as the degree of bottom steepness increases, the wave height reduction becomes gradual,\nand this can be attributed to the water depth variation, shoaling, breaking, and reflection characteristics associated with\ndifferent slopes, in the presence of mangroves.\n",

In a global perspective, Naskar and\nMandal (1999) reported that small pockets of mangrove\nwoodland are widely distributed even in steep slope shore-\nland near Tupi Island and swampy areas at Tigak\nArchipelago between New Ireland and New Hanover.\nEven though mangrove forests on steep slopes are rarely\nreported, one cannot ignore the possibility of mangroves\nthriving on steep slopes, and it opens up a new prospect of\ncoastal hazard risk reduction by reducing the wave attack\non high wave energy coasts. By mimicking the essential\nconditions, mangroves can be grown or artificial man-\ngroves/patches/island can be implemented on high-energy\ncoasts that can potentially replace the existing conven-\ntional coastal structures for coastal protection. There are\nvarious natural mangrove rehabilitation techniques devel-\noped to adapt the mangrove seedlings to different condi-\ntions in the field. Nevertheless, wherever the above\ntechniques fail, the artificial mangroves made of biode-\ngradable and environmental friendly materials can be used\nafter experimental and field studies. However, it is impera-\ntive to understand how these mangrove structures behave\non a steep topography and its efficiency in wave damping\nencountering high-energy waves. Also, in certain man-\ngrove locations, the natural slope of the coast (bathymetry)\nis subjected to varying climate change and associated envi-\nronmental factors and it can adversely affect the attenua-\ntion efficiency of mangroves and its ecosystem. Hence,\nthis study finds its importance on mangrove coasts that\neventually may turn steeper in future due to severe erosion\ncaused by climate change and natural and anthropogenic\nOude, 2010) have conducted extensive sensitivity analysis\nof wave attenuation by vegetation where the role of waves\nand vegetation characteristics on the wave damping were\nanalyzed, but scarcely studies have paid attention to the\nvariation of wave attenuation pattern resulting from vary-\ning bottom slopes and sediment characteristics. Therefore,\nin this study, we have conducted synthetic experiments to\nsimulate the characteristics of wave attenuation through\nvegetation over varying bottom topography using a third-\ngeneration numerical wave model. It exposes the sensitiv-\nity of wave attenuation characteristics to different bottom\nslopes in the presence of mangroves and aims to under-\nstand how the wave attenuation characteristics by man-\ngroves differ with varying bed slopes during extreme\nwind-wave climate.\nReview of the literature\nWave attenuation by vegetation has been studied analyti-\nMclvor et al.

Motivated by the concept on the ability of man-\ngrove plants to convert the mean kinetic energy into tur-\nbulent kinetic energy, Fatimah et al. (2008) proposed a\nnumerical modeling approach for artificial mangrove root\nsystem (ArMS) as an alternative solution to solve coastal\nengineering problems in cohesive soil coastlines; the\neffort investigated the effect of mangrove-roots-like sub-\nmerged breakwater. Kathiresan (2003) attempted on the\ntidal flows around mangrove vegetation and their role in\nthe process of sedimentation. His study has provided a\nplausible mechanism on the role of mangrove forest on\nsedimentation.\nMethodology\nSeveral sets of numerical experiments have been con-\nducted in this study to evaluate the impact of mangroves\non wave height under varying bottom topography, that\nis, the influence of sea-bottom slopes on wave attenua-\ntion through mangroves using a third-generation wave\nmodel, SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore). The per-\ncentage rate of wave attenuation by mangroves, r, is\ndefined by\nr\nH\n=\n-\nis the incident significant wave height at the\noffshore boundary and H is the significant wave height at\nthe extreme nearshore end of the selected domain.\nThe SWAN model\nThe SWAN is a third-generation wave model developed at\nthe Delft University of Technology, Netherlands that com-\nputes random, short-crested wind-generated waves in\ncoastal regions and inland waters. The SWAN wave model\nis a discrete spectral model based on the action balance\nequation (Booij et al., 1996), which is mathematically\nexpressed in the form\n128 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)\n\n\n+\n\n\n( )+\n\n\n( )+\n\n\n( )\n+\n\n\n( ) = =\n+ +\nN\nt x\nc N\ny\nc N c N\nc N\nx y\ntotal in nl\n\n \n\n\nd\nds bot\nS\n+\n\nwhere N( )\n \n, represents the total action density defined as\nN E/\n=  in which E is the energy density and  is the\nintrinsic frequency, t is the time,  is the wave direction,\nand cx\nand cy\nare the propagation velocities along the x\nand y directions, respectively.

The open\nocean boundary condition in the experiment assumes a\nJONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) spectrum\nwith the default peak enhancement factor,  = 3.3.\nThe waves are considered to approach the coast from\noffshore with a significant wave height and wave period\nof 9 m and 12 seconds, respectively. The model consid-\nered an extreme wave condition and used the boundary\ncondition as specified in the work by Nayak et al. (2012).\nThe effect of tides and current interaction with wave and\nvegetation are excluded assuming a small tidal range.\nImplementation of mangroves in model\nThe first set of numerical experiments considered the case\nwithout vegetation for all the selected slopes and subse-\nquently repeated after including the vegetation component.\nIn the latter, the hypothetical mangroves were arranged in\na tandem order in two vertical segments for a distance of\n500 m from the coast. In this study, the mangrove forest\nhas been provided for 500 m considering 10% of the total\ndomain. As mentioned in a review work by Hashim et al.\n(2013), some Asian countries have outlined the minimum\nrequired width for mangrove forests. According to\n1000 m width has been set as a buffer zone in Vietnam\nalong the Mekong delta coastline. In Philippines, the\nbuffer zone is 20 m and can reach up to 50 m in storm-\nprone areas. In Malaysia, the 1950s regulation specified\n200 m mangrove buffer zone before any structures protect-\ning agricultural land (Othman, 1994). The lower layer with\na height of 0.5 m and diameter of 3 cm represented the root\ncharacteristics of the mangroves. The lower layer repre-\nsents special roots known as pneumatophores or breathing\nroots. The heights of these aerial roots are reported differ-\nently for each region. Therefore, an average value of 50 cm\nhas been selected for this study. It corresponds to a density\nof 100 no/m2, and the upper layer consisted of a single\nmangrove stem having a height of 5 m and diameter of 0.2\nm. Asano et al. (1993) proposed an adaptation to the for-\nmulation by Dalrymple et al. (1984) to include the sway\nmotion of plants and thereby expand the range of the appli-\ncation from only stiff to flexible vegetation. The conclu-\nsions of physical modeling studies showed that varying the\ndrag coefficient is sufficient to model flexible vegetation\n(Burger, 2005). This study has referred the previous litera-\ndrag coefficient of 1 to mangrove stem and 1.25 to roots in\nview of the flexibility of stem to account for swaying\nmotion and the rigidity of roots.\nResults and discussions\nThe simulated significant wave height corresponding to\nvarying bottom slopes without mangroves and with man-\nand 3, respectively.\nMangroves act as a buffer to the water surface from the\neffects of wind, thereby reducing the generation of wind-\nwaves and wave setup and run-up, which make a substan-\ntial contribution to storm-surge flood levels and damage\n(Mclvor et al., 2012). From the synthetic experiments\n(Figures 2 and 3), it is clearly evident that the energy of the\nincoming waves is significantly dampened while propa-\ngating through the mangroves. The transmitted wave\nheight across the mangrove forest on steep slope also\nexhibits considerable decrease in wave height in the pres-\nence of mangroves. However, the vegetated mild slope\nexhibits higher wave dissipation when compared to the\nsteeper slopes having mangrove vegetation. Figure 4\ndetails the variation in characteristics of wave attenuation\nfor bottom slopes varying from mild to steep, with and\nwithout mangroves, respectively.\nIt is clearly evident from this study that the type of\nwave attenuation is different for each case. The shoaling\nand breaking characteristics are different for various beach\nslopes. The relative contribution of damping by vegetation\nand breaking is represented in Figure 4. The breaker zone\ncharacteristics essentially depend upon the bottom slope,\nincident wave, and tidal variation. The distance of breaker\nzone from the coastline is dynamic in nature and changes\nwith instantaneous water level variations. This study does\nnot consider the time variation of water level elevation and\nassumes that the breaker zone for the respective beach\nslopes to remain constant. However, in the field, it changes\nfor each tidal cycle that may alter the wave decay pattern\ndepicted in Figure 4. For mild slopes, the waves propagate\nfor longer distances. Tsai et al. (2002) found that the shoal-\ning distance on steep slope becomes short, and the surface\nwaves may be partially reflected from the steep bottom.\nGenerally, spilling breaker dissipates the energy at a slower\nrate (Dally et al., 1985). The wave decay on mild slope\noccurs prior to the propagation of waves through the man-\ngrove forest. In Figure 4(a), the wave height decays gradu-\nally for the mild slope, and in the presence of mangroves,\nthe wave height decays exponentially. The presence of\nvegetation results in a drag force which greatly enhances\nwave attenuation compared to a smooth bed (Mclvor et al.,\n2012). In the case of steeper slopes, waves are found to\ndecay at the entrance of the mangrove area, which is\nlocated before the breaker zone (Figure 4(d)). It is also\nnoted that when the waves propagate through the man-\ngroves on steep slope, the wave height reduction becomes\ngradual and the effect is similar to the attenuation on mild\nslope without mangroves.\nFor a mild slope (1:80), where the beach slope gradu-\nally varies, the percentage energy reduction is found to be\n98% as the waves approach the shoreline from the offshore\nis indicated as 93% and 84%, respectively. As the bed\nslope gets steepened, the rate of wave dissipation due to\nmangroves on 1:10 slope marked an increase of 20% when\ncompared with that of no mangroves. The attenuation rates\nFigure 1. Schematic representations of bottom topography (in meters) used in sensitivity experiments (from left to right 1:80;\n130 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)\nare likely to differ with the variation in the incident wave\ncharacteristics and the vegetation parameters such as spac-\ning, dimensions, and species. The study also solidifies the\nfact that the wave dissipation rate on mild slope is maxi-\nmum for the first few 100 m of the mangrove forest,\nwhereas the trend is reverse on the steep slope. The unique-\nness of wave attenuation characteristics for each slope can\nbe attributed to the water depth variation in different\nslopes. There exists an inverse relationship between water\ndepth and rate of wave dissipation by mangroves. Since\nexperimental setup without mangroves.\nexperimental setup with mangroves.\nthe water depth is lower in the nearshore regions of mild\nslope, the waves are attenuated more rapidly as they prop-\nagate through the exposed roots which offer more drag\nresistance. But in the case of a steep slope, the water level\nis higher and the roots are in submerged condition, and the\nwaves are encountered on stem resulting in lesser attenua-\ntion rate. A similar kind of disparity in wave attenuation\ncharacteristics is observed in mangrove environments with\nhigh tidal range.\nKobayashi et al. (1993) assumed an exponential decay\nof local wave heights for the small amplitude waves propa-\ngating over vegetation\nH H exp k x\n= -\nwhere H is the local wave height (in meters), H0\nis the\ninitial wave height at x = 0 , ki\nis the exponential decay\ncoefficient, and x is the horizontal coordinate considered\npositive in the direction of wave propagation. Anderson\net al. (2011) also reported that the wave heights were\nobserved to decay exponentially through vegetation beds\nwith the most rapid reduction occurring within the first\nfew meters of permanent vegetation cover. This study has\ncomputed the local wave height from model simulations\nand estimated the wave height decay as H H\ni o\n/ that was\nplotted against the distance of wave propagation ( X ) as\nshown in Figure 4. The results obtained for mild or gradu-\nsistency with the earlier studies, but contradict with that of\nsteeper slopes. As the seabed slope steepens, the trend\nshifts from the expression as suggested by Kobayashi et al.\nFigure 5 explains the dissipation due to mangroves on\nmild slope and steep slope, and also the dissipation by\nmangroves on steep slopes can be expressed.\nFor mild slope\nf x a*exp bx\n( ) = -\nFor steep slope\nf x a*exp bx\n( ) = ( ) (7)\nwhere f(x) is the total energy dissipation, \"x\" is the width\nof mangrove forest, and \"a\" and \"b\" are constants. The dis-\nsipation rate by vegetation is high on mild slope for the\nfirst 100 m of vegetation width, and for the steep slope, the\ndissipation rate increases exponentially as it moves through\nthe vegetation, and the highest wave dissipation is observed\n100 m away from the landward edge of mangrove forest.\nThe mangrove-dominated Ganges Delta--the\nSundarbans--is a complex ecosystem comprising one\nof the three largest single tracts of mangrove forests of\nthe world. The Sundarbans mangrove forest which is a\npart of the head bay region situated in the north of Bay\nof Bengal is a low wave energy coast with gentle bottom\nslopes and high risk to extreme events, namely, cyclones,\nstorm surge, sea level rise, so on, and vulnerable to\nchanging climate. One of the recent studies by Patra and\nBhaskaran (2016) provides clear evidence on the dipole\nFigure 4. Wave height decay computed with and without mangroves under breaking and non-breaking conditions for varying\n132 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)\nnature in the wind-wave climate over this region. The\neastern side of the head Bay region bordering Myanmar\nexperiences an increased activity of both wind and wave\nclimate, unlike the western side that borders the main-\nland of India. Interestingly, there is a shift observed in\nthe mean sea-level pressure patterns over this region.\nMore research is warranted to understand these observed\ntrends in wind-wave activity over the head Bay region,\nconsidering both the atmospheric and oceanographic\ncomponents together. Higher wave activity in the coastal\nregions along the eastern side is directly linked with\nchanges in the bathymetric profile. Complex sedimenta-\ntion patterns and sediment transport mechanisms play\nan important role in dynamic changes in the shoreline\npatterns and also the seabed slope. It is felt that some\nareas in the nearshore regions off Sundarbans are in a\nstate of continuous change due to sediment transport\nprocess and tidal action. In the long run, these localized\ncoastal processes can significantly change the topogra-\nphy resulting in steepening of the bottom slope in some\nregions. This may adversely affect the mangrove eco-\nsystem, and the characteristic wave energy attenuation\nfor the region may also vary. Therefore, the present\nhypothetical experiment has addressed on how the wave\ndissipation varies with abrupt change in natural slope of\nthe region and quantified the wave height reduction for\nvarying slopes during extreme waves. The flow field\nwill be different for each slope and it further affects the\nsedimentation in that region. Implementing artificial\nmangroves on a steeper beach will significantly improve\nthe devastating effect of erosion caused by high-energy\nwaves and further helps in sedimentation.\nConclusion\nThe key findings from synthetic experiments reveal that\nthe energy of the incoming waves significantly dampens\nwhile propagating through mangroves for all slope con-\nditions considered in this study. The vegetated mild\nslope exhibits higher wave dissipation when compared\nto the steeper slopes having mangrove vegetation.

The quantitative and qualitative characteristics of\nwave dissipation by mangroves differ for each slope due\nto which the water depth, shoaling, breaking, and reflec-\ntion phenomenon for each slope varies. This study high-\nlights that the characteristics of wave height decay\nsignificantly depend upon the slope of sea bottom, and\nhence, bottom topography plays an important role in\nwave dissipation characteristics by vegetation. This\nstudy is an initial effort to understand how the wave\nattenuation characteristics change from mild to steep\nslopes in the presence of mangroves, and furthermore, it\ndevelops an idea about the efficiency and behavior of\nartificial mangroves on a high wave energy coast.\nFigure 5.
