It is very common for investors to use\nthem in conjunction with other technical indicators. In fact,\naccording to a survey by Menkhoff (2010), fund managers\napply it in their shorter term forecasts. Candlestick charting is\nunique in the sense that it concurrently plots daily open, high,\nlow, and close price movements (Morris, 2006). As such, it\nreveals demand and supply changing balance (Caginalp &\nLaurent, 1998) and also investor sentiment and psychology\n(Marshall, Young, & Rose, 2006). Proponents of candlestick\nbelieve that investors could use these chart patterns to predict\nshort-term price movements or future turning points.\nSurprisingly, despite its long history and popularity, there\nare not many academic studies on candlestick patterns. There\nis still no agreement whether this approach is profitable.\nSome studies find that it is useless (Horton, 2009; Marshall,\nleast in the U.S. and Japanese stock markets. However, other\nstudies find that applying certain candlestick patterns is\nprofitable at least for short-term trading (Goo, Chen, &\nTaiwanese and Chinese stock markets. Interestingly, Lu,\nChen, and Hsu (2015) even find significant positive returns\nin the U.S. stock markets if investors follow the Caginalp\u00ad\nLaurent (CL) exit strategies (Caginalp & Laurent, 1998) but\nnot the Marshall\u00adYoung\u00adRose (MYR) exit strategies\n(Marshall et al., 2006). The MYR applies a prespecified date\nto exit the market, whereas the CL sets an exit price equal to\nan average holding period closing price.\nThis article tests the profitability of candlestick trading\nstrategies both without technical filtering and with technical\nfiltering by applying the skewness adjusted t test (Johnson,\n1978) and the binomial test.

The study on an individual stock data set has an advan-\ntage over a study on a stock index in a sense that each stock\nis tradable unlike a nontradable stock index. Moreover, the\nuse of individual stock data avoids potential biases intro-\nduced by nonsynchronous trading within an index.\nAs previous literature focuses on the mature markets of\nthe United States and Japan and the emerging markets of\nonly Taiwan and China, this article extends the literature to\ninclude the Southeast Asian emerging market of Thailand.\nMoreover, the article investigates further the impact of dif-\nferent exit strategies. This important issue has not been\ninvestigated outside the U.S. market or after Lu et al. (2015).\nIn addition, the use of Thai stock data to test candlestick pat-\nterns, which were developed using Japanese rice data and\nformerly tested only in the U.S., Japanese, and Chinese stock\nmarkets, is clearly an ex ante evaluation. This mitigates the\nissue of data snooping (Marshall et al., 2006). In addition,\nthis study also tests profitability of filtered candlestick pat-\nterns, which is the use of candlesticks in combination with\nother technical indicators. The applied technical filters are\nStochastics (%D), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Money\nFlow Index (MFI). Basically, the buy or sell signals must be\nconfirmed by other indicators before they are acted upon to\navoid false signals. This test has not been done in previous\nstudies which focus exclusively on candlestick patterns.\nThe empirical results reveal that most candlestick reversal\npatterns do not generate statistically significant mean returns.\nMoreover, even some patterns that do have significant mean\nreturns usually have very high risks in terms of standard\ndeviations. The binomial tests also confirm that most candle-\nstick patterns, even the ones with significant mean returns,\ncannot reliably predict market directions. In addition, this\narticle finds that filtering either by %D, RSI, or MFI gener-\nally does not increase profitability nor prediction accuracy of\ncandlestick patterns.\nThe organization of this article is as follows. The\n\"Introduction\" section provides a brief summary. \"Literature\nReview\" section discusses both theories and existing empiri-\ncal evidences. \"Candlestick Methodology\" section provides\na background of candlestick methodology. \"Method\" section\ndiscusses the statistical method. The \"Data\" section provides\na discussion about data. \"Empirical Results\" and \"Filtered\nCandlestick Patterns\" sections provide empirical results\nwithout technical filtering and with technical filtering,\nrespectively. Finally, the \"Conclusion\" section concludes\nand suggets further studies.\nLiterature Review\nTheory\nThe Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that secu-\nrity prices already reflect all available and relevant\ninformation (Fama, 1970). As a result, technical analysis\nincluding charting patterns, which use only historical\ntrading data, cannot generate positive abnormal returns.\nInvestors could make money from charting patterns only\nif the market is inefficient.\nHowever, later theories start to challenge the EMH.\nGrossman and Stiglitz (1980) theoretically demonstrate that,\nif the market is perfectly efficient, then there is no benefits in\nobtaining and analyzing costly information. The question is\nthen how could security prices reflect information when no\none is willing to process it. Therefore, the market cannot be\nperfectly efficient. More recently, behavioral models, such as\nnoisy rational expectations models (Brown & Jennings,\n1989), feedback models (DeLong, Shleifer, & Summers,\n1990), and herding models (Froot, Scharftstein, & Stein,\n1992) challenge the EMH. These models argue that price\nadjusts slowly to new information due to noise, feedback\nmechanism, or herding behavior. In these models, it is pos-\nsible for trading strategies based on past data to generate\npositive abnormal returns. As such, charting patterns may\nstill be useful for profitable trading.\nEmpirical Studies\nThe earliest test of candlestick trading strategies is Caginalp\nracy of candlestick patterns. Their binomial tests, as approxi-\nmated by the normal distribution, indicate statistical\nsignificance and an almost 1% return over a 2-day horizon.\nHowever, later work by Marshall et al. (2006) and Marshall\net al. (2007) found the opposite conclusion. Their results\ncould not find profits from the use of candlestick patterns\nonDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stocks over the\nstrapping methodology that accommodates open, high, low,\nand close prices. They conclude that the candlestick patterns\nhave no forecasting power. Results are based on the assump-\ntion that a trade is executed at a close price on the day after a\nsignal. Stocks are generally held for up to 10 days. Horton\n(2009) confirms these results. His article finds little value in\nthe use of candlestick.\nUnlike previous studies which focus on daily data,\nDuvinage, Mazza, and Petitjean (2013) test 5-min intraday\ndata of 30 component stocks of the DJIA index. After a cor-\nrection for the data snooping bias, no single candlestick rule\non the double-or-out market timing strategy outperforms the\nbuy-and-hold strategy after transaction costs.\nFollowing Marshall et al. (2006), Marshall, Young, and\nCahan (2008) used a similar approach in analyzing the larg-\nest 100 stocks listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Their\nresults show that candlestick charting could not generate\npositive abnormal returns in the Japanese equity market dur-\nbefore transaction costs.\nTharavanij et al. 3\nLu et al. (2015) are later able to reconcile the conflicting\nresults from Caginalp and Laurent (1998) and Marshall et al.\n(2006) by investigating profitability of two different exit\nstrategies. The first one is the CL exit strategy (Caginalp &\nLaurent, 1998) and the other one is the MYR exit strategy\n(Marshall et al., 2006). The MYR applies a prespecified date\nto exit the market. On the contrary, the CL sets an exit price\nequal to an average holding period closing price, assuming\nthat investors liquidate their positions evenly within this\nperiod. They apply candlestick trading strategies to the 30\nperiod and find that candlestick patterns with the CL exit\nstrategy are profitable even after transaction costs and cor-\nrections of data snooping bias. In sharp contrast, candlestick\npatterns with the MYR exit strategy are not profitable. They\nreason that positive abnormal returns of the CL exit strategy\nis a result from a risk sharing mechanism when stocks are\nliquidated over the holding periods. They also find that the\nbullish patterns are more profitable than the bearish ones. In\naddition, they note that a short holding period of 3 days is\nmore profitable than a long holding period of 10 days.\nOutside of the U.S. and Japanese stock markets, research\non candlestick trading strategies are done only in the\nTaiwanese and Chinese stock markets. Most of them find\npositive results. Goo et al. (2007) analyze daily data of 25\ncomponent stocks in the Taiwan Top 50 Tracker Fund and\nfind a strong evidence that certain candlestick trading strate-\ngies are profitable. In addition, they notice that different\ncandlestick patterns require different holding periods to be\nprofitable. Shiu and Lu (2011) investigates the profitability\nof candlestick 2-day patterns. The data set includes daily\nprices and volumes for 69 securities listed at the Taiwan\nHarami signals generate significant positive abnormal\nreturns. In another study, Lu and Shiu (2012) use the Taiwan\nprofitability of candlestick patterns. They find that certain\nbullish candlestick patterns consistently outperform others.\nMoreover, they notice that buying signals are generally more\neffective than selling signals. Unlike previous studies which\nines the profitability of 1-day patterns by using daily data of\nfinds significant evidence that, after transaction costs, some\n1-day candlesticks with the correct trend are profitable.\nInstead of using fixed holding periods, Lu et al. (2012)\napply a variable holding period where stocks are bought after\nbullish patterns and then held until bearish patterns happen.\nThe sample includes stocks included in the Taiwan Top 50\nish reversal patterns (but not bearish ones) generate positive\nabnormal returns even after transaction costs.\nIn a more recent work, Zhu et al. (2016) use the two\nChinese exchange's data (Shanghai and Shenzhen stock\naccuracy of candlestick reversal patterns. They find that for\nstocks of low liquidity, bearish harami, and cross signals quite\naccurately predict reversals, whereas for highly liquid or\nsmall stocks, bullish harami, engulfing, and piercing patterns\nperform well. Additional evidence is provided by Chen, Bao,\nand Zhou (2016). They study the prediction accuracy of 2-day\nbullish and bearish candlestick patterns in Chinese stock mar-\nkets. They find that the bullish and bearish harami, and the\nhoming pigeon are most accurate, whereas bullish and bear-\nish engulfing are good short-term forecasts (less than 2 days).\nCandlestick Methodology\nCandlestick Charting\nThe Japanese candlestick methodology is credited to\nMunehisa Homma, a Japanese merchant, who applied them\nstick chart involves simultaneously plotting of open, high,\nlow, and close prices. The box of a candlestick chart is called\na \"real body\" and it measures a difference between the open\nand close prices. If a close price is higher (lower) than an\nopen price, then the body is white (black). In other words, a\nwhite (black) body means rising (falling) prices during a day.\nIf the close and open prices are the same, then the real body\nwould be just a horizontal line called a \"doji.\" The vertical\nlines above and below the candlestick's body are \"shadows.\"\nThe above one is called the upper shadow, whereas the below\none is called the lower shadow. They represent the high and\nlow prices respectively within a specific time frame. See\nFigure 1 for candlestick charts.\nThe candlestick charting is best suited to daily price series\n(Nison, 1991). The rationale is that daily open and close\nprices would also incorporate overnight information, rather\nthan only intraday information (Morris, 2006).\nTrend Definitions\nMorris (2006) argues that a candlestick pattern can generate\na valid trading signal only if a trend is identified. There are\nthree trend definitions in the literature.\nThe first type of trend is the MA3 (Moving Average over\n3 days) introduced by Caginalp and Laurent (1998). An\nuptrend happens when a 3-day simple moving average is\nmonotonically increasing for at least 5 of 6 successive days.\nSimilarly, a downtrend occurs when a 3-day simple moving\naverage is monotonically decreasing for at least five of six\nThe second type of trend is the EMA10 (Exponential\nMoving Average over 10 days) suggested by Marshall et al.\nclose price is higher (lower) than its EMA10, an upward\n(downward) trend is identified. The key advantage of EMA10\n4 SAGE Open\nis that a market is always in either an uptrend or a downtrend.\nThe EMA is calculated by the following formula, whereas\n\"C\" denotes a close price and N is the averaging period. In\nthis case, N is 10 trading days.\nN t t N t N t\nN\nC\n, , ,\n.\n=\n+\n\n\n\n\n\n -\n( )+\n- -\nZhu et al. (2016) apply an alternative version of this sec-\nond type of trend. In this version, the short-period (5 days)\nmoving average (MV5) and the long-period (10 days) mov-\ning average (MV10) are calculated. If MV5 is higher (lower)\nthan MV10, then an upward (downward) trend is detected.\nThe third type of trend is the Levy trend introduced in Levy\n(1971). This is, in fact, the first proposed definition. A reversal\npoint of a trend can be detected by a percentage incremental\nprice move over 6 days (the slope). Then, the averages of clos-\ning price changes over the most recent 131 days (the average\nchange) are calculated. An uptrend is defined as the periods\nwhen the slope is higher than 6-time the average change. The\nidentification of a downtrend is just the opposite.\nLu et al. (2015) investigate the above three definitions of\ntrend and its impact on the profitability of candlestick pat-\nterns. They find that the results do not depend on which defi-\nnition of trend is used. As such, this article sticks with the\nsecond definition for its simplicity. In this research, close\nstock prices on the first trading days in the sample are used to\ninitialize the above EMA recursion.\nCandlestick Patterns\nCandlestick patterns can be classified into 1-day, 2-day,\nand 3-day patterns (Figures 2, 3 and 4). Normally, a 1-day\nrepresents a daily candlestick. If a pattern signals a con-\ntinuation of an existing trend, then it is a continuation pat-\ntern. In contrast, if it signals a change in a trend, then it is\na reversal pattern. Nison (1991) argues that reversal pat-\nterns are more meaningful because it would help traders to\nbuy at the bottom and sell at the peak. Therefore, he sug-\ngests that traders should pay more attention to reversal pat-\nterns than continuation ones. Previous academic studies\n(e.g., Caginalp & Laurent, 1998; Marshall, Cahan, &\nCahan, 2008) also focus solely on reversal patterns. These\nreversal patterns can be grouped into bullish and bearish\nones. The bullish (bearish) patterns predict future prices\nincrease (decrease). This article would summarize these\n1-day, 2-day, and 3-day patterns in turn.\nThere are six bullish and six bearish 1-day patterns\n(Marshall et al., 2006). The bullish patterns are White\nMarubozu (WM), Closing White Marubozu (CWM),\nOpening White Marubozu (OWM), Long White Candle\n(LWC), Dragonfly Doji (DD), White Paper Umbrella (WPU),\nand Black Paper Umbrella (BPU). The bearish patterns are\nBlack Marubozu (BM), Closing Black Marubozu (CBM),\nLong Black Candle (LBC), Opening Black Marubozu\n(OBM), Gravestone Doji (GD), Black Shooting Star (BSS),\nand White Shooting Star (WSS). The patterns are ordered\naccording to signal strength.\nThere are five well-known 2-day bullish reversal patterns.\nThey signal a change at the end of a downtrend. They are HP,\nbullish engulfing, piercing line (PL), BullH, and bullish\nkicking. There are also five well-known 2-day bearish rever-\nsal patterns. They signal a change at the end of an uptrend.\nThey are descending hawk (DH), BearE, dark cloud cover\n(DCC), bearish harami, and bearish kicking.\nFigure 1. Candlestick charts.\nTharavanij et al. 5\nThere are four popular 3-day bullish reversal patterns. They\nsignal a change at the end of a downtrend. They are three white\nsoldier (TWS), three inside up (TIU), three outside up (TOU),\nand morning star (MS). There are four popular 3-day bearish\nreversal patterns.They signal a change at the end of an uptrend.\nThey are three black crows (TBC), three inside down (TID),\nthree outside down (TOD), and evening star (ES). All 3-day\npatterns are just extension of 2-day patterns with an extra 1\nday for confirmation (Marshall et al., 2006).\nIn general, there are three approaches for an exit strategy.\nThe first one is the MYR exit strategy introduced by Marshall\net al. (2006). The second one is the CL exit strategy sug-\ngested by Caginalp and Laurent (1998). The third one is the\nLu-Shiu-Liu (LSL) exit strategy proposed by Lu et al. (2012).\nThe MYR exit strategy assumes that investors liqui-\ndate their positions at the end of the holding period. In\ncontrast, the CL exit strategy assumes that investors liq-\nuidate their positions during the holding period. As such,\nexit prices are average prices over the holding period.\nThe typical holding periods are 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, and\n10-day. The candlestick trading strategy should not be\nUnlike other methods, the LSL exit strategy has a vari-\nable holding period. The LSL exit strategy assumes that\ninvestors buy (sell) on bullish (bearish) signal and liqui-\ndate their position when bearish (bullish) patterns hap-\npen. The purpose is to study profitability from a long-term\nperspective.\nFigure 2. One-day candlestick patterns (Morris, 2006).\nSource.

He argues that filtering would\nimprove trading profitability of candlesticks because it\nremoves premature patterns and confirms trading signals. In\nfact, he finds that by filtering, the number of trades is signifi-\ncantly reduced but the average gain per trade increases.\nA presignal is generated when a technical indicator gives\nan overbought or oversold signal. If the indicator gives an\noverbought (oversold) signal, then only bearish (bullish)\ncandlestick patterns are filtered. This article uses Stochastics\n(%D), RSI, and MFI as candlestick filters. They have the\nadvantage of ranging from 0 to 100 and give a clear over-\nbought or oversold signal.\nStochastics (%D). The stochastic oscillator indicates a relative\nposition of a current price when compared with its price range\nover a period. The range is used as indicators of support and\nresistance levels. The oscillator itself is expressed as a per-\ncentage of this range. The number 0% and 100% would indi-\ncate the bottom and the peak within the range, respectively.\nThe idea is based on the observation that turning points tend\nto be at the extremes of the recent price range. Normally, the\nnumbers greater than the 80 level or lower than the 20 level\nare in an overbought or oversold territory, respectively.\nFigure 3. Two-day candlestick patterns (Morris, 2006).\nSource.

The MFI is an approximation of a trading value over sev-\neral days. It ranges from 0 to 100. Normally, the numbers greater\nthan the 80 level or lower than the 20 level are in an overbought\nor oversold territory, respectively (Wikipedia, 2017a). The MFI\nis similar to the RSI in the sense that both measure positive\nchanges against total changes. However, the MFI uses volume,\nwhereas the RSI uses amounts of price changes.\nThe MFI is computed by the following steps. First, calcu-\nlate the \"typical price\" according to the formula below. Then,\nmultiply typical price and volume to derive the money flow.\nThe money flow is grouped into positive and negative types.\nThe positive (negative) money flow is defined as the 14-day\nsummation of money flow when the typical price is increas-\ning (decreasing). More specifically, the MFI is defined by the\nfollowing equation:\nTP\nMF TP Volume,\n=\n+ +\n( )\n= \u00d7\n= >\n=\n\n\n-\nt t\n,\n,\nP\nMFI\nPMF\nt t\n<\n=\n+\n\u00d7\n,\n[ ]\n,\nwhere H, L, and C are high, low, and close price, respec-\ntively; TP = typical price; MF = money flow; PMF = positive\nmoney flow; and NMF = negative money flow.\nWhen MFI goes above 80, it gives an overbought signal\nand the sell filter is turned on. Any candlestick pattern that\ngives a sell signal when MFI is above 80 will be recognized\nas a filtered sell signal. Similarly, whenever MFI is below 20,\nit gives an oversold signal and the buy filter is turned on.Any\ncandlestick pattern that gives a buy signal when MFI is\nbelow 20 will be recognized as a filtered buy signal.\nMethod\nThe article applies a skewness adjusted t test (Johnson, 1978)\nto test the null hypothesis that the mean return is zero, and\nuse the binomial test to test the null hypothesis that the win-\nning rate is just 50%. The \"Winning Rate\" represents the pro-\nportion of positions with positive (negative) returns for\nbullish (bearish) signals.\nAs stock return distributions may not follow a normal dis-\ntribution, the use of a skewness adjusted t test is more appro-\npriate than a normal t test. The details of a return calculation,\na skewness adjusted t test, and a binomial test are as\nfollows.\nReturn Calculation\nThis article assumes that traders buy a stock at its opening\nprice on the day after a bullish signal is detected. The stock\nis held over a fixed period and then sold at the closing price\nof a period. A holding period return is calculated. Similar to\nraw returns instead of excess returns.\nThe returns calculated are holding period returns. The\nholding periods are 1, 3, 5, and 10 trading days. Then, this\narticle calculates the means of all signaled returns of various\nstocks with the similar holding periods to determine the opti-\nmal holding periods for bullish and bearish signals. The\nreturn formulae depend on the employed exit strategy.\nFor the MYR exit strategy, the holding period continuous\nreturn is calculated by the following formula:\nr C O\nt h\nc\nt h t\n+ +\n= -\nln ln .\nFor the CL exit strategy, the holding period continuous\nreturn is calculated by transforming a corresponding discrete\nreturn. The specific formula is the following:\nr\nC\nh\nO\nO\nr r\nt h\nd\nt j\nt\nj\nh\nt\nt h\nc\nt h\nd\n+\n+\n=\n+ +\n=\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= +\n( )\n\n,\nln .\nThe superscript \"c\" denotes a continuous return, whereas\n\"d\" denotes a discrete one. The variable \"h\" is the number of\ntrading days in a holding period. The variables \"O\" and \"C\"\nmean open and close prices, respectively.\nTharavanij et al. 9\nSkewness Adjusted t Test\nThis article uses a skewness adjusted t test developed by\nJohnson (1978) to test profitability of candlestick patterns.\nThe skewness adjusted t test is a valid nonparametric test\neven with biased distributions of return rates. This statistic is\ncalculated using the following formula:\nt n s s\nn\ns\nr\nsa\nr\n= + +\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n \n\n,\n= standardized mean of return\nns,\n= estimated skewness of returns.\n\n\n=\n-\n( )\n=\n r r\nn\ni\nr\ni\nn\nBullish (bearish) signals are valid only if their mean\nreturns are positively (negatively) significant. The one-tail t\ntest is applied.\nNeyman and Pearson (1928), and Pearson andAdyanthya\ndistribution of the t statistics than kurtosis. A positive (nega-\ntive) skewness in the return distribution would lead to a neg-\natively (positively) skewed sampling distribution of t\nstatistic. Sutton (1993) concludes that when the population\ndistribution is asymmetrical, the use of Johnson's statistics is\npreferred to the t test.\nBinomial Test\nThe probability of correct predictions or winning probability\nis defined as the number of correct signals divided by the\ntotal observed signals. A binomial test is used to check\nwhether candlestick patterns have a predictive power. The\nprobability of correction should be higher than .5 if candle-\nstick patterns signal the future short-term returns.\nThe exact interpretation of winning probabilities\ndepends on the type of an exit strategy employed and\nwhether it is a bullish or bearish pattern. In the case of\nMYR exit strategy, it is the probability that the holding\nperiod return would be positive (negative) for a bullish\n(bearish) signal. In the case of CL exit strategy, it is the\nprobability that the average price over the holding period\nwould be higher (lower) than the entry price, resulting in a\npositive (negative) holding period return for a bullish\n(bearish) signal.\nThe difference between the two means \"np\n\" (the expected\nnumber of success where p\n= .5) and \"np\" (the actual num-\nber) is divided by the standard deviation to get the Z statistic\nto test the null hypothesis:\nZ\nn p p\n=\n-\n( )\n\n.\nUsing the central limit theorem, the Z statistic has a nor-\nmal distribution. The standard error is given as follow:\n = -\n( )\nnp p\nData\nMarshall et al.

Tables 1 to 6 pro-\nvide statistics of each pattern. The overall picture is that both\nbullish and bearish candlestick reversal patterns are not use-\nful. The mean returns of most patterns are not statistically\ndifferent from zero. Even the ones with significant returns\nhave relatively low mean returns (from 0.07% [BPU\n3D-MYR] to 0.84% [BullH 5D-MYR]) compared with risks\nas measured by standard deviations (4.36% [BPU 3D-MYR],\n7.04% [BullH 5D-MYR]). The binomial test results confirm\nthe finding that normally candlestick patterns cannot reliably\npredict market directions. The rest of this part would be sepa-\nrated into results from single-day patterns, 2-day patterns,\nand 3-day patterns, consecutively.\nIn the case of bullish single-day patterns, most candlestick\npatterns could not generate statistically significant positive\nmean returns. The ones that did are WM, OWM, LWC, and\nBPU. Only OWM has significant mean returns over all hori-\nzons. The BPU comes close as its mean returns are significant\nover all horizons except for 1 day. The WM and LWC have\nsignificant mean returns only for a 10-day holding horizon.\nThe binomial test results show that the winning probability is\nnormally not significant. The notable exception is the OWM\nfor a 5- or 10-day holding horizon. Overall, the OWM has the\nbest performance. Its adjusted t statistics are highly signifi-\ncant in all holding periods and for both MYR and CL exit\nstrategies. The mean returns are also the highest. This is a\nsurprise given that according to candlestick textbooks (e.g.,\nstrongest bullish signal (in fact, that one belongs to WM). The\nOWM, in fact, only gives the third strongest bullish signal\n(after WM and CWM). This may indicate that signal strength\ndoes not necessarily follow what is specified in candlestick\ntextbooks and may vary among stocks and stock markets.\nInterestingly, the supposedly second strongest bullish signal,\nTable 1.

Interestingly, like the case\nof bearish single-day patterns, the TBC and TID patterns\nhave significant positive mean returns (for a 10-day horizon)\ninstead of expected negative ones. They behave, in fact,\nmore like bullish signals.\nIn summary, most candlestick patterns are not very useful\nin terms of investment timing. Even the ones with statistically\nsignificant returns do have high risks in terms of standard\ndeviations. For example, the OWM pattern, a single-day bull-\nish pattern, has the highest holding period return of 0.71% (10\ndays with MYR) with the associated standard deviation of\n8.04%. In addition, the signal strength or direction (bullish or\nbearish) do not necessarily follow those suggested in candle-\nstick textbooks. For example, the CBM pattern, a 1-day bear-\nish pattern, has no significant negative mean returns as\nexpected but instead has significant positive mean returns. It\nbehaves more like a bullish pattern. In terms of exit strategies\n(MYR vs. CL), this article does not find much difference but\nthe general observation that mean returns and standard devia-\ntions of MYR tend to be higher than those of CL.

The overall picture is that even\nwith filtering, candlestick patterns are still not useful.

Among unprofitable unfiltered patterns, they\nare still not profitable even with filters. The binomial test\nresults reveal that even with filtering, most candlestick pat-\nterns cannot reliably predict market directions.

Similar to the unfiltered case, nearly all\nfiltered single-day bearish patterns could not generate sig-\nnificant negative returns. The binomial tests confirm the\nresult that they could not reliably predict market downturns.\nAmong 2-day bullish patterns, the best unfiltered and fil-\ntered strategy is consistently the BullH.

Two exit strategies are studied. One is the MYR\nexit strategy (Marshall et al., 2006) and the other is the CL exit\nstrategy (Caginalp & Laurent, 1998). The MYR applies a pre-\nspecified date to exit the market. In contrast, the CL sets an exit\nprice equal to an average holding period closing price, assum-\ning that investors liquidate their positions evenly within this\nperiod. In terms of methodology, this study uses the skewness\nadjusted t test (Johnson, 1978) and the binomial test.\nThe statistical analysis finds little use of both bullish and\nbearish candlestick reversal patterns since the mean returns\nof most patterns are not statistically different from zero.\nEven the ones with statistically significant returns do have\nhigh risks in terms of standard deviations. The binomial test\nresults also indicate that candlestick patterns cannot reliably\npredict market directions.\nFurthermore, this study finds that the signal strength or\ndirection (bullish or bearish) do not necessary follow those\nsuggested in candlestick textbooks. For example, the CBM\npattern, a single-day bearish pattern, has no significant nega-\ntive mean returns as expected but instead has positive mean\nreturns. In terms of exit strategies (MYR vs. CL), this article\nobserves that results from MYR tend to have both higher\nmean returns and higher standard deviations compared with\nthose from CL. In addition, this article finds that filtering\neither by Stochastics (%D), RSI, or MFI generally does not\nincrease profitability nor prediction accuracy of candlestick\npatterns.\nThis article has the following limitations. First, we do not\ninvestigate the roles of trend, support, and resistance lines.\nSecond, our sample includes only components of the largest\n50 stocks in the SET. It is possible that candlestick pattern is\nmore effective for smaller capitalized stocks.
