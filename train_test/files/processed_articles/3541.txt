(i) Caciagli et al. (1988) found that elec-\ntrical stimulation of cultured astrocytes pre-loaded with\n[3H]adenosine released approximately equal amounts of nu-\ncleosides and nucleotides to the medium in a Ca2 + - and\nK+ -dependent manner. (ii) Release of ATP from cultured as-\ntrocytes by glutamate, or by NMDA, AMPA or kainate-specific\nagonists was described by Queiroz et al. (1997). With addi-\ntion of 100 M glutamate they found an average ATP release\nof 0.3\u00ad0.4 pmol/min per mg of protein, but higher gluta-\nmate concentrations raised this value. (iii) Maienschein et al.\n(1999) confirmed release of ATP from cultured astrocytes\nby receptor-mediated mechanisms and suggested vesicular\nexocytosis as a potential mechanism of the release. These\nobservations are important for astrocytic function, since one\nmechanism for the propagation of Ca2 + waves in astrocytes\nis by release of ATP (Leybaert and Sanderson, 2012), which\nsubsequently activates purinergic receptors on adjacent cells\n(Cotrina et al., 2000). (iv) ATP release from cultured astro-\ncytes was again found to be Ca2 + -dependent by Bal-Price\net al. (2002), who also described that a portion of astro-\ncytic ATP is packaged in secretory granules. (v) Pangsric et al.\n(2007) showed punctate expression in cultured astrocytes of\nATP-containing vesicles, which after glutamate stimulation\nfused with the plasma membrane in a Ca2 + -dependent man-\nner, leading to release of ATP. (vi) Pryazhnikov and Khi-\nroug (2008) showed that exocytosis of ATP from cultured\nastrocytes was triggered by receptor stimulation or Ca2 +\nJ. Xu and others\nuncaging, but occurred after a delay, with only approximately\n4% of the release during the first 30 s. (vii) In intact brain\nslices the time interval is even longer (Heinrich et al., 2012)\nsuggesting activation of Ca2 + -dependent signaling. (vii) Re-\nlease of ATP from astrocytes gently isolated from brain slices\nFor studies of the role of glycogen in ATP release from brain\nslices or astrocytes obtained from brain slices it is important\nto remember that glycogen content may become drastically\nreduced when the animal is killed and only recover in the\nslices after at least 2 h of incubation (LeBaron, 1955).\nGlycogenolysis is Ca2 + -dependent, not only in muscle\nan astrocyte-specific process (Gibbs et al., 2006), which is\nimportant for brain function both on account of its require-\nment for formation of transmitter glutamate (Gibbs et al.,\n2006) and because Na+ ,K+ -ATPase-mediated K+ uptake\nin cultured astrocytes require glycogenolysis-dependent sig-\nnaling (Xu et al., 2013). An intense K+ uptake triggered by\nextracellular K+ concentrations above 15 mM, which is me-\ndiated by activation of the Na+ , K+ , Cl- and water trans-\nporter NKCC1, and is secondary to depolarization-mediated\nopening of L-channels for Ca2 + (Yan et al., 2013), also re-\nquires glycogenolysis. We therefore wondered whether K+ -\nstimulated and perhaps also transmitter-stimulated ATP re-\nlease might require glycogenolysis.\nIn the present paper this was studied by measuring ATP\nrelease from cultured astrocytes by a luciferin/luciferase\nmethod in the presence and absence of the glycogenoly-\nsis inhibitor 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB), with\nand without stimulation. In addition to testing the generally\nused but pathologically high K+ concentration of 45 mM we\nalso tested whether a smaller effect could be obtained after\naddition of 10 mM K+ , reaching a less pathological extra-\ncellular K+ concentration of 15 mM, and whether this effect\nmight be increased by -aminobutyric acid (GABA) which is\ndepolarizing in astrocytes and causes an increase in [Ca2 + ]i\nalone, as were the two other transmitters glutamate and\nadenosine.\nReagents\nChemicals for preparation of medium and most other chem-\nicals, including DAB, adenosine, glutamate, the glutamate\nreceptor antagonist MPEP [2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-\npyridine], GABA and the ecto-ATPase inhibitor ARL67156\nwere purchased from Sigma. The inhibitor of MEK [MAPK\n(mitogen-activated protein kinase)/ERK (extracellular-signal-\nregulated kinase) kinase] U0126 was obtained from Cal-\nbiochem.\nCell culture\nPrimary cultures of astrocytes were prepared from the\nneopallia of the cerebral hemispheres as previously described\n(Juurlink and Hertz, 1992) with minor modifications (Xu et al.,\nEssential Medium (DMEM) with 7.5 mM glucose (to allow\nsome decline between feedings) and the 5.4 mM K+ tra-\nditionally used in our cultures. After the age of 2 weeks,\n0.25 mM dibutyryl cAMP (dBcAMP) was included in the\nmedium. Such cultures are highly enriched in astrocytes\n(>95% purity of glial fibrillary protein- (GFAP-) and glu-\ntamine synthetase-expressing astrocytes (Hertz et al., 1985).\nThe addition of dBcAMP at this specific stage of culturing\nis a crucial component of our culture preparation. It leads\nto a morphological and functional differentiation, as evi-\ndenced by the extension of cell processes, increases in sev-\neral metabolic activities and expression of voltage sensitive\nL-channels for calcium (Ca2 + ), features which are charac-\nYan et al., 2013). Use of astrocyte cultures has recently been\nauthoritatively reviewed (Lange et al., 2012), and in our own\ncultures drug-induced changes in gene expression and edit-\ning have recently been confirmed in freshly isolated cells\nfrom mice treated with the same drugs (Li et al., 2012b; Song\nthe glutamate/aspartate exchanger component aralar shows\nsimilar developmental patterns in the two preparations, with\nan increase in the cultured cells after dBcAMP administration\nLuciferin/luciferase ATP assay\nFor determination of the extracellular ATP, a lu-\nciferin/luciferase assay (ENLITEN ATP Assay System Biolumi-\nnesecence Detection Kit, Promega) and a Tecan infinite M200\nMicroplate Analyzer were used to record relative light units\n(RLU) as described by Liu et al., (2008). Firefly luciferase cat-\nalyzes the oxidation of luciferin in the presence of ATP to\nproduce light. For determination of ATP release the culture\nmedium in 24-well plates was replaced with 180 l of DMEM\nwithout pH indicator and serum but retaining its normal glu-\ncose content. To most of the incubation media an inhibitor\nof ecto-ATPase (ARL67156) was added at the beginning of\nthe incubation. At the same time the glycogenolysis inhibitor\n(DAB) was added to some cultures. Fifteen minutes later a 60\nmin-incubation with drugs or excess K+ was begun by gen-\ntly adding 20 l of glutamate (1 mM in DMEM, to achieve\na final concentration of 100 M), of adenosine (1 mM in\nDMEM, to achieve a final concentration of 100 M), of GABA\n(1 mM in DMEM, to achieve a final concentration of 100 M),\nor of KCl (either 450 mM in DMEM to achieve a final K+\n2 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nRole of glycogenolysis in stimulation of ATP release from cultured mouse astrocytes\nconcentration of 50 mM or 100 mM in DMEM to achieve a\nfinal K+ concentration of 15 mM).\nAt the end of the 60-min experimental period a 100 l\naliquot of the incubation medium was quickly removed and\nits temperature reduced to 37C for the ATP assay. It was\nmixed with a 100 l aliquot of luciferin/luciferase reagent\ndissolved in dilution buffer provided with the assay kit, and\nchemiluminescence values (RLU) were recorded. Ionic salt\nsensitivity of the luciferase reaction was negligible, and it\nwas not sensitive to DAB or other drugs employed in the\npresent study (J. Xu, L. Hertz and L. Peng, unpublished work).\nHowever, even in the absence of any known ATP, consider-\nable relative high RLU readings were caused by the medium\nand/or cultures (ATP is found in many compounds), and this\nvaried slightly between experiments. A correction for RLUs\nthat were independent of ATP release was introduced by\nadjusting the baseline of each figure, assuming that the rel-\natively small ATP release under control conditions remained\nconstant. This procedure ensures that relative changes are\nmeasured reasonably accurately. For calculation of absolute\nATP levels, sample RLU readings were in some cases compared\nwith RLU values obtained from standard solutions of ATP.\nStatistics\nThe statistical values of the differences between individ-\nual groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by\nFisher's LSD test. The level of significance was set at P < 0.05.\nRESULTS\nEffects of DAB\nWithout any tissue the incubation medium caused RLU values\nlished work) for the reasons discussed above. In Figure 1 all\nvalues are therefore indicated from a baseline of 1500. Un-\nder control conditions, without any ecto-ATPase inhibitor,\nthere is virtually no visible increase in RLU (Figure 1). How-\never, in the presence of the ecto-ATPase inhibitor ARL 67156\nthere is an increase of 300 units, suggesting that a nor-\nmally occurring small ATP release is obscured by ecto-ATPase\naction. An effect similar to that of ARL 67156 was caused by\nDAB, which might suggest that ecto-ATPase action requires\nglycogenolysis. This possibility was not further investigated,\nexcept by showing that the effects of ARL 67156 and DAB\nwere not additive. In all remaining results of Figure 1 ARL\nglutamate, 100 M adenosine or an elevation of the extra-\ncellular K+ concentration by 45 mM (to a total of 50 mM). In\nthe absence of DAB either agent increased RLU by up to 1000\nRLU units, and this effect was almost completely inhibited by\nFigure 1 Glycogenolysis is required for the increase of ATP release from\nwell differentiated astrocyte cultures induced by the addition of\nglutamate to a final concentration of 100 M, adenosine to a final\nconcentration of 100 M or elevation of the extracellular K+\nconcentration by 45 mM\nThe presence of any of these stimuli during incubation for 60 min in\nglucose-containing (7.5 mM) DMEM supplemented with the ecto-ATPase\ninhibitor ARL67156 increased the content of ATP, measured as RLU by a lu-\nciferin/luciferase technique. This increase was almost abolished in the addi-\ntional presence of the glycogenolysis inhibitor (DAB). Results are the averages\nof RLU values from three to five individual cultures. S.E.M. values are indicated\nby vertical bars. *Statistically significant (P < 0.05) difference from all other\ngroups, but not from each other.\nA standard curve (not shown) was used to estimate the\ncorresponding amounts of ATP. It showed that 300 RLU units\nunder control conditions corresponds 0.3 nM and that a\nfurther increase of 1000 units under stimulated conditions\nequals 5 nM. Since this value was obtained after a 1:1 di-\nlution and the total volume of incubation was 200 l, the\ntotal amount of ATP in the incubation medium must have\nincreased by about 2 pmol. With a protein content of 35 g\nper culture the amount of ATP released in response to glu-\ntamate during 60 min would thus amount to 60 pmol or\n1.0 pmol/min per mg of protein. In the following two fig-\nures, ARL 67156 was present in all experiments to prevent\necto-ATPase activity. The ATP release shown in Figure 2 in re-\nsponse to glutamate was somewhat smaller than in Figure 1,\nperhaps reflecting differences in protein content in the cul-\ntures. However, it was still at least as high as the release\nmate. Addition of either the glutamate receptor antagonist\nMPEP or U0126 completely inhibited the glutamate-evoked\nincrease in extracellular ATP. We have previously shown that\nMPEP inhibits glutamatergic signaling in astrocytes (Peng\nphosphorylation of ERK1/2. ERK1/2 phosphorylation must ac-\ncordingly constitute an important part of the glutamate-\nstimulated pathway leading to ATP release.\nFigure 3 shows that addition of 10 mM K+ caused a\nsmaller release of ATP (about 300 RLU or 0.3 pmol ATP/min\nper mg of protein) than exposure to higher K+ concentra-\ntions, and it made little difference whether or not GABA was\nalso present.

Some experiments were performed in\nthe additional presence of either 25 M MPEP, an antagonist of mGluR5 and\nGluK2 receptors, or 10 M U0126, a specific inhibitor of ERK phosphorylation\n(by inhibition of MEK). For undetermined reasons the ATP release in response\nto glutamate was smaller than in Figure 1, but the main result is that it was\ncompletely prevented by either inhibitor. Literature data indicate that mGluR5\nis not functioning in differentiated cells. Results are averages of RLU values\nfrom three individual cultures.

GABA alone seemed to cause a very small increase in\nATP release, but it was far from being statistically significant.\nDISCUSSION\nAbrogation of K+ -stimulated release of ATP by inhibition\nof glycogenolysis could have been expected, since the L-\nchannel-mediated pathway opened by the addition of 45 mM\nK+ (Cai et al., 2011) is inhibited when glycogenolysis is pre-\nvented (Xu et al., 2013). L-channel function is also known to\nbe dependent on energy metabolism (Kostyuk, 1984). Eleva-\ntion of extracellular K+ concentrations cause an increase in\nglycogenolysis both in intact brain tissue (Hof et al., 1988) and\nin cell cultures that have been treated with dBcAMP (Sub-\nbarao et al., 1995). The present study showed that also K+\naddition resulting in a more physiologically relevant K+ con-\ncentration (10 mM) caused a significant release of ATP, which\nwas completely inhibited by nifedipine. GABA alone had no\nsignificant effect and only slightly and non-significantly in-\ncreased that of elevated extracellular K+ concentrations. The\nrelatively small depolarization it causes seems insufficient to\nevoke ATP release.\nThe glycogenolysis-dependent pathways activated by glu-\ntamate and adenosine in astrocytes are unknown. The present\nstudy showed inhibition by the glutamate antagonist MPEP\nand by an ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibitor. MPEP is gener-\nally known as an inhibitor of mGluR5, a metabotropic glu-\nFigure 3 The cells were treated as described in Figure 2 but instead of\nadding glutamate the extracellular K+ concentration was increased by\n10 mM, in some experiments together with the addition of GABA to a\nEither the addition of 10 mM K+ alone or the combined addition of K+ and\nGABA increased ATP release, although to a smaller degree than the higher,\nmore depolarizing K+ concentration used in Figure 1.

GluK2 is equally distributed\nin freshly isolated neurons and astrocytes (Li et al., 2012a).\nThe signaling pathway for the GluK2 receptor in astrocytes\nhas not been determined, but glutamate increases [Ca2 + ]i\nin the presently used astrocytes (Li et al., 2011). However, in\nastrocytic transmitter pathways examined so far ERK1/2\nphosphorylation is downstream of an increase in [Ca2 + ]i\nand subsequent transactivation of the epidermal growth\ninhibitor of ERK1/2 phosphorylation abolished glutamate-\ninduced release of ATP, and we have evidence that inhi-\nbition of post-transamination signaling does not interfere\nwith pre-transactivation signaling (J. Xu, L. Hertz and L.\nPeng, unpublished work). Accordingly, it can be concluded\nthat increase in [Ca2 + ]i\nis necessary, but not sufficient, for\nGluK2-mediated ATP release. Precise identification of the\nglycogenolysis-dependent step is therefore a major under-\ntaking, beyond the scope of the present study.\nGlutamate has been reported not to cause glycogenol-\nysis in cultured astrocytes (Sorg and Magistretti, 1991).\nConsistent with this observation, 100 M glutamate (the\nconcentration used in this study) causes relatively little\nglycogenolysis also in our cultures, although it had a pro-\nnounced glycogenolytic effect at 1 mM (J. Xu, L. Hertz\nand L. Peng, unpublished work), perhaps due to massive\nglycogenolysis-requiring extrusion of K+ accumulated to-\ngether with glutamate. In this context it is of interest that\n4 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nRole of glycogenolysis in stimulation of ATP release from cultured mouse astrocytes\nQueiroz et al.

A2A\nadenosine\nreceptors mediate their effects predominantly through cou-\npling to adenylyl cyclase, but at least in some cells their acti-\nvation might also induce formation of inositol phosphates, a\nrise in [Ca2 + ]i\nand activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (Of-\nfermanns and Simon, 1995). This is important because cAMP\nas previously described can not induce glycogenolysis in the\nabsence of an increase in [Ca2 + ]i\nalso enter the cell through receptors (Neary et al., 1988).\nSuch a mechanism might perhaps explain why Kanno and\nNisizaki (2012) found the release of glutamate and increase\nin [Ca2 + ]i\nin cultured astrocytes in response to adenosine to\nrequire protein kinase A function but not Ca2 + release from\neither InsP3\nor ryanodine receptors.
