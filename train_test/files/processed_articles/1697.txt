The effect of PFCs on glucose homeostasis is not known.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We examined 474 adolescents and 969\nadults with reliable serum measures of metabolic syndrome profile from the National Health and\nRESULTS -- In adolescents, increased serum perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) concentrations\nIncreased serum PFNA concentrations also have favorable associations with serum HDL choles-\nIn adults, increased serum perfluorooctanoic acid concentrations were significantly associated\nwith increased -cell function ( coefficient 0.07  0.03, P  0.05).

Further clinical and animal studies are warranted to clarify putative causal\nrelationships.\nThe perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs)\nare a family of perfluorinated chem-\nicals that consist of a carbon back-\nbone typically 4\u00ad14 carbons in length\nand a charged functional moiety (1). PFCs\nhave been used extensively since the\nas inclusion as a component in surfac-\ntants, lubricants, paper and textile coat-\nings, polishes, food packaging, and fire-\nretardant foams (2). Some of these PFCs,\nincluding the most widely known exam-\nples, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and\nperfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS), persist in\nhumans and the environment and have\nbeen detected worldwide in wildlife (2).\nThe routes of human exposure to PFCs\nare currently being investigated. Possible\nexposure pathways that are being exam-\nined include drinking water, dust in\nhomes, and food or migration from food\npackaging and cookware. Animal studies\nhave shown that these compounds are\nwell absorbed orally but are poorly elim-\ninated; they are not metabolized and\nundergo extensive uptake from enterohe-\npatic circulation and are distributed\nmainly to the serum, kidney, and liver (1).\nAlthough some PFCs have been voluntar-\nily removed from the market by manufac-\nturers, PFOA and PFOS and their\nderivatives are still produced commer-\ncially, and the potential risk to humans\ncontinues to be evaluated.\nIn animal studies, exposure to PFOS\nand PFOA is associated with adverse\nhealth effects, including carcinogenicity\n(3,4), hepatotoxicity (4,5), and develop-\nmental and reproductive toxicity (4). For\nhumans, PFC exposure has been shown\nto be associated with certain types of can-\ncers (6). Maternal exposure to PFOS and\nPFOA also has been linked to low birth\nweight (7).\nThe causal biochemical mechanisms\nleading to the adverse health outcomes\nafter exposure to PFCs are largely un-\nknown. However, recent studies using\nadvanced technologies in genomics and\nbioinformatics have shown that several\ncategories of genes are commonly altered\nby some PFCs including those for peroxi-\nsome proliferation, fatty acid metabolism,\nlipid transport, cholesterol synthesis, pro-\nteosome activation and proteolysis, cell\ncommunication, and inflammation (1).\nThe agonistic properties of PFCs on per-\noxisome proliferator-activated recep-\ntors- [PPAR-] are well supported and\nare thought to be a major mechanism\nleading to PFC-mediated liver damage\n(8,9). Because activation of PPAR- can\ndecrease serum triglycerides, normalize\nLDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cho-\nlesterol, we hypothesized that PFCs might\nhave favorable effects on lipid homeosta-\nsis and may also be associated with re-\nduced insulin resistance, an improved\nserum lipid profile, and lower prevalence\nof the metabolic syndrome. The goal of\nthe present study was to test this hypoth-\nesis by examining data from the National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n                                                \nFrom the 1Department of Internal Medicine of Nephrology, En Chu Kong Hospital, Taipei County, Taiwan;\nthe 2Institute of Occupational Medicine and Industrial Hygiene, National Taiwan University College of\nPublic Health, Taipei, Taiwan; the 3School of Medicine, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei County,\nTaiwan; the 4Department of Pediatrics, Taipei City Hospital, Zhongxiao Branch, Taipei, Taiwan; and the\n5Department of Internal Medicine of Cardiology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.\nCorresponding author: Lian-Yu Lin, hspenos@yahoo.com.tw.\n\u00a9 2009 by the American Diabetes Association.

The survey data\nare released every 2 years. Detailed survey\noperations manuals, consent documents,\nNHANES Web site (10).\nparticipants at least 12 years of age who\nhad a blood test for PFCs. Among these\nsubjects, only 1,788 subjects had a morn-\ning examination and had fasting plasma\nglucose, insulin, and triglyceride data\navailable. Of these 1,788 participants, we\nincluded the 1,443 subjects without miss-\ning data for further analyses.\nAnthropometric and biochemical\ndata\nAccording to the statements on the\nNHANES Web site, data were collected at\nall study sites by trained personnel fol-\nlowing standardized procedures. Socio-\ndemographic information such as age,\nsex, race/ethnicity, education level, and\nhousehold income was collected during\nthe household interview. Alcohol intake\nwas determined by the questionnaire (\"in\nany one year, have you had at least 12\ndrinks of any type of alcohol beverage?\")\nand was dichotomized. For adolescents,\nbecause there were too many missing\ndata, alcohol intake was not entered for\nanalysis. Smoking status was categorized\nas active smoker, former/passive smoker,\nand nonsmoker by the smoking question-\nnaire and serum cotinine levels as de-\nscribed previously (11). Laboratory\nmeasurements were performed in a mo-\nbile examination center. Weight and\nheight were measured using standard\nmethods and digitally recorded. Three\nand sometimes four blood pressure deter-\nminations were collected by a physician\nusing a mercury sphygmomanometer.\nBlood pressure was measured in the right\narm unless otherwise specified. Averaged\nsystolic blood pressure (SBP) and dia-\nstolic blood pressure (DBP) were ob-\ntained. Blood specimens were processed\nlocally and then stored and shipped to\ncentral laboratories for analysis. Levels of\nserum total cholesterol and triglycerides\nwere measured enzymatically. Levels of\nHDL cholesterol were measured after pre-\ncipitation of other lipoproteins on a Hitachi\nmodel 704 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, In-\ndianapolis, IN). Serum C-reactive protein\n(CRP) levels were measured by latex-\nenhanced nephelometry. Plasma insulin\nwas determined by an immunoenzymo-\nmetric assay. Insulin resistance status (ho-\nmeostasis model assessment of insulin\nresistance [HOMA-IR]) and -cell function\nwere estimated by the updated homeostasis\nmodel assessment (HOMA2) (12).\nDefinition of metabolic syndrome\nFor subjects 18 years old, presence of\nthe metabolic syndrome was calculated\nby sex as defined by the National Choles-\nterol Education Program Adult Treatment\nPanel III (13) guideline of presenting with\nat least three of the following qualifica-\ntions: waist measurement 88 cm for\nwomen and 102 cm for men; serum\ntriglycerides 1.69 mmol/l; serum HDL\ncholesterol 1.03 mmol/l in men and\nmmHg or DBP 85 mmHg or a self-\nreport of taking antihypertensive medica-\ntions; and fasting glucose 6.10 mmol/l\nor a self-report of taking antihyperglyce-\nmic medications.

In brief, without protein pre-\ncipitation, only dilution with 0.1 M for-\ninjected into a commercial column switch-\ning system allowing for concentration of the\nanalytes on a C18 solid-phase extraction\ncolumn. This column was placed automat-\nically in front of a C8 analytical high-\nperformance liquid chromatography\ncolumn for chromatographic separation\nof the analytes.

In this study, we showed that\nPFCs were differentially associated with\nglucose homeostasis in adolescents and\nadults. We should consider carefully the\nextrapolation and interpretation of data\nbetween laboratory animal studies and\nthe corresponding biological effects (at\nhigh parts per million range) compared\nwith general human populations (at low\nparts per billion range). We found that the\nconcentrations reported for PFCs in the\noccupational studies have been 2 and 3\norders of magnitude higher than those\nmeasured in the general population.

Our results might suggest that\nlow-dose PFC exposure may have ef-\nfects on glucose metabolism in the gen-\neral population.\nOur analysis showed that the serum\nPFOA and PFOS concentrations were not\ndifferent between adolescents and adults.\nUnlike other lipophilic persistent pollut-\nants that display increasing serum con-\ncentrations as individuals age, the lack of\nthis general trend in PFOS and PFOA\ncould be explained by intrauterine trans-\nfer, exposure early in life with ongoing\nexposures being much higher than earlier\nhistorical exposures, or a combination of\nthese factors (18). In contrast, the mean\nconcentrations of PFHS were higher for\nadolescents than for adults, as reported\npreviously (2,19). The higher concentra-\ntions of PHFS in children and adolescents\ncould be related to their increased contact\nwith carpeted floors containing PFHS,\nwhich is used for specific postmarket car-\npet treatment applications (2,19).\nWe showed that in adolescents, in-\ncreased serum PFNA concentrations were\nassociated with decreased blood insulin,\nimpaired -cell function (borderline sig-\nnificance), and clinical hyperglycemia.\nOn the other hand, we found that increased\nserum PFNA had a favorable correlation\nwith serum HDL cholesterol. Overall, in-\ncreased serum PFNA concentrations were\ninversely associated with the prevalence of\nmetabolic syndrome in adolescents. In\nadults, serum PFOS concentrations were\nindependently associated with increases in\nboth blood insulin and insulin resistance\nstatus (HOMA-IR). Interestingly, both se-\nrum PFOA and PFOS were also positively\ncorrelated with -cell function. The balance\nbetween increased insulin resistance and\n-cell function has a neutral effect on blood\nglucose. Increased PFOS also showed an\nunfavorable association with serum HDL\ncholesterol in adults. Overall, the PFCs in\nthe present study had neutral effects on the\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome in\nadults.\nThere has been a great deal of\nprogress in the last few years in under-\nstanding the toxicology and distribution\nof PFCs in the environment, in wildlife,\nand in humans. However, there is a pau-\ncity of information pertaining to many\nspecific PFCs (1). Thus far, there are no\npublished reports of either in vitro or in\nvivo data pertaining to effects of PFCs on\nglucose homeostasis. The underlying\nmechanisms of this linkage are unknown\nand might partially be related to peroxi-\nsome activation. The liver toxicity of\nPFOS and PFOA has been linked to their\nPPAR- agonist property (8,9). PFNA\nalso has been shown to be a strong perox-\nisomal -oxidation inducer in animals\n(20,21). Fibrates, amphipathic carboxylic\nacids that activate PPAR-, can decrease\ntriglycerides, normalize the LDL choles-\nterol profile, and increase HDL choles-\nterol (22). However, our results are not\nentirely consistent with previous animal\nfindings, suggesting alternative or even\nmultiple pathways in association among\nPFCs, glucose, and lipid metabolism. For\nexample, Luebker et al. (23) have demon-\nstrated that both PFOS and PFOA can in-\nterfere with the binding affinity of liver\nfatty acid\u00adbinding protein in rodents. In-\nterestingly, they also found that among\nthe PFCs tested, PFOS exhibited the high-\nest level of inhibition of liver fatty acid\u00ad\nbinding protein, which might partially\nexplain the unfavorable association be-\ntween increased serum PFOS and HDL\ncholesterol.\nOur study has several limitations. First,\nthe cross-sectional design does not permit\nany causal inference. Second, because of\nmissing data, drinking status was not in-\ncluded in our analyses of adolescents.\nIn summary, we present the first re-\nport of a relationship between serum\nPFCs, glucose homeostasis, and metabolic\nsyndrome. Because PFCs have been widely\nused worldwide in a variety of consumer\nproducts, further longitudinal clinical and\nin vitro studies are urgently needed to\nelucidate the putative casual relationships\nbetween PFCs and metabolism.\n"
