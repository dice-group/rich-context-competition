In multivari-\nable analyses, women who became obese before age 16 were more likely to have diabetes than\naccounting for current BMI, waist circumference, and age at menarche. Persistent (vs. adult\nonset) obesity was associated with increased likelihood of diabetes in men (2.27 [1.41\u00ad3.64])\nCONCLUSIONSdDiabetes risk is particularly high in individuals who were obese as ado-\nlescents relative to those with adult-onset obesity, thus highlighting the need for diabetes pre-\nvention efforts to address pediatric obesity.\nDiabetes prevalence has risen sub-\nstantially over the last few decades,\ndisproportionately affecting racial/\nlion Americans had diabetes; nearly 6\nmillion were undiagnosed (3). The total\nto be $174 billion (4), and this economic\nburden is likely to escalate over time. The\nadverse health and economic consequen-\nces combined with significant racial/\nethnic disparities and high rates of undi-\nagnosed diabetes emphasize the critical\nneed to address this disease.\nAlthough the links between current\nobesity and type 2 diabetes are clear, some\nresearch suggests that a history of obesity\nduring childhood (5,6) and young adult-\nhood (7) increases diabetes risk later in\nlife. However, the differential and cumu-\nlative effects of obesity during different\nperiods of the life span on the develop-\nment of diabetes are not well documen-\nted. In particular, adolescence may be a\nsensitive period for the development of\ndiabetes given the substantial decreases\nin insulin sensitivity associated with pu-\nbertal development (8). This period has\nthe potential for alterations in insulin me-\ntabolism, which might increase diabetes\nrisk later in life, and there is the potential\nthat a longer duration of obesity might\nelicit additional metabolic changes that\nincrease future diabetes risk (9,10).\nWith obesity, pancreatic b-cells initially\nincrease insulin release to overcome the\nreduced efficiency of insulin action, al-\nthough over time compensation may be-\ncome insufficient, ultimately leading to\nthe development of diabetes (9,10). Nev-\nertheless, epidemiologic research specifi-\ncally examining the relationship between\nduration of obesity with diabetes in adult-\nhood has yielded inconsistent results\nrelationship of obesity timing and dura-\ntion to diabetes in adulthood is needed to\ndetermine important periods for diabetes\nintervention, particularly in diverse eth-\nnic groups.\nIn this article, we use nationally\nrepresentative, longitudinal data to ex-\namine racial/ethnic differences in rates of\ndiagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes in\nyoung adults. In addition, we capitalize\nupon longitudinal data to examine how\nadolescent-onset obesity and adult-onset\nobesity might differentially relate to di-\nabetes risk in young adulthood and\nwhether these associations differ by sex\nand race/ethnicity. We hypothesize that\nindividuals who experienced adolescent-\n(vs. adult onset) obesity would be more\nlikely to have diabetes in young adulthood,\nindependent of current body size, with the\nhighest risk among those with persistent\nobesity from the teen to adult years.\nMETHODS\nNational Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Ado-\nlescent Health (Add Health) is a cohort of\nyears), representative of the U.S. school\nc c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c\nFrom the 1Department of Health Sciences, Furman University, Greenville, South Carolina; and the 2De-\npartment of Nutrition, Gillings School of Global Public Health, and the Carolina Population Center, Uni-\nversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\nCorresponding author: Penny Gordon-Larsen, pglarsen@unc.edu.\nA slide set summarizing this article is available online.\n\u00a9 2013 by the American Diabetes Association.

Undiagnosed diabetes defined as A1C $6.5% with no report of a diabetes diagnosis. Percentages of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes do\nnot sum to percentage of total diabetes because of rounding. Timing of obesity was determined using the individual's age at the wave of initial obesity classification\nand categorized as follows: 1) never obese; 2) adolescent obesity (defined as initial classification of obesity before 16 years of age); 3) adolescent obesity (between 16\nand 18 years of age); and 4) adult obesity (obesity onset at or after 18 years of age). Obesity duration from adolescence to adulthood was based on obesity status\nat waves II, III, and IV and categorized as follows: 1) never obese; 2) incident obesity (nonobese at baseline and became and remained obese through last examination);\n3) fluctuating obesity (any shift in classification from obese to nonobese); and 4) persistent obesity (obese at all waves). xOf the participants, 256 women had missing\nadult weight status/WC because they were pregnant at the time of measurement.\nDiabetes: obesity timing and duration\nOur final analytic sample included\nour analytic sample with the missing\n5,120, we observed significant differences\nby race/ethnicity, education, age, and sex.\nTo assess selection bias, we used in-\nverse probability weighting (IPW), which\nassigns a weight to each subject in the\nanalytic sample so each subject accounts\nfor himself or herself in the analysis as\nwell as those with similar characteristics\nwho were not selected into our final\nanalytic sample (19). For each partici-\npant, we estimated a weight proportional\nto the inverse of the probability of being in\nour analytic sample. We used two sepa-\nrate multivariable, logistic models to pre-\ndict diabetes at wave IV as a function of\nobesity (timing or duration), race/ethnic-\nity, education, age, and sex: one model\nincluded the IPW and the second model\ndid not include the IPW. The b coeffi-\ncients from the two models were nearly\nidentical, suggesting an absence of selec-\ntion bias by race/ethnicity, education, age,\nand sex in our final models.\nMeasures\nOutcome measure. At wave IV, diabetes\nwas identified using self-reported previ-\nous diagnosis and A1C (from whole-\nblood spot assays collected from finger\npricks, which have achieved the same\nlevel of precision and reproducibility as\nother standard methods of collecting\nblood, such as venipuncture [20]). We\ndefined diagnosed diabetes as a \"yes\" re-\nsponse to the question, \"Has a doctor,\nnurse, or other health provider ever told\nyou that you have or had high blood sugar\nor diabetes [if female, when you were not\npregnant]?\" Individuals who responded\n\"no\" and had an A1C $6.5% were con-\nsidered to have undiagnosed diabetes.\nIn addition, we conducted sensitivity\ntesting of an alternative classification\nstrategy in which we take account of med-\nication use, given that some researchers\nhave defined diagnosed diabetes as self-\nreported diabetes or self-reported use of\ndiabetes medication (21). Yet some par-\nticipants may have used diabetes medica-\ntion (e.g., metformin) for the treatment of\ndiseases other than diabetes (e.g., poly-\ncystic ovary syndrome or obesity). For\nthis reason, we did not use diabetes med-\nication as a criterion for diagnosed diabe-\ntes in our primary analysis. Nonetheless,\nwe conducted a sensitivity analysis, in\nwhich diagnosed diabetes was defined as\nFigure 1dPrevalence of diabetes in adulthood by obesity timing (A), obesity duration from\nadolescence to adulthood (B), and diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes stratified by race/ethnicity\n(C), from wave IV (2007\u00ad009) of the Add Health study.

Height and weight\nwere measured in waves II through IV\nduring in-home surveys using standard-\nized procedures. As recommended by\nexpert panels, obesity was defined for\nadolescents as a BMI equal to or greater\nthan the 95th percentile of the age- and\nsex-specific Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention growth reference or BMI\nadults (22). For women who were preg-\nnant at time of measurement (wave II: n =\nBMI was coded as missing.\nObesity timing was determined using\nindividual's age at the wave of initial obe-\nsity classification and categorized as fol-\nlows: 1) never obese; 2) young adolescent\nobesity (initial classification of obesity be-\nfore age 16 years); 3) adolescent obesity\n(between the ages of 16 and 18 years); and\n4) adult obesity (obesity onset at or after\nthe age of 18 years). Duration of obesity\nfrom adolescence to young adulthood\nwas based on obesity status at waves II,\nIII, and IV and categorized as as follows:\n1) never obese; 2) incident obesity (non-\nobese at baseline and became and re-\nmained obese at last examination); 3)\nfluctuating obesity (any shift in classifica-\ntion from obese to nonobese); and 4) per-\nsistent obesity (obese at all waves). We\nselected adult-onset obesity and incident\nobesity as our referent categories because\nof our primary interest in understanding\nthe effect of obesity timing and duration\non diabetes risk among obese individuals.\nWe include findings for individuals who\nwere never obese to allow comparison\nwith results of other studies.\nWaist circumference (WC), obtained\nat wave IV, was measured midway be-\ntween the lowest rib and the superior\nborder of the iliac crest at end-expiration.\nWe defined central obesity according to\nthe criteria set by the Third Report of the\nNational Cholesterol Education Program\nExpert Panel on Detection, Evaluation,\nand Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol\nin Adults (men, $40 inches; women,\n$35 inches). For women who were preg-\nnant at the time of measurement (n =\n256), WC was coded as missing.\nControl measures. Covariates were mea-\nsured using traditional survey methods\nand included age; sex; education (less\nthan high school, high school degree,\nsome college, college or more); smoking\n(nonsmoker, former smoker, current\nsmoker); parental history of diabetes\n(mother or father [yes/no]); and race/\nethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, Asian).\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were conducted using\nSTATA (release 12.0, Stata Corp., College\nStation, TX). To account for the stratified\nsampling strategy and clustered sampling\ndesign and nonresponse bias (18), longi-\ntudinal sample weights and survey analy-\nsis techniques were used in all analyses.\nPercentages were calculated for categori-\ncal variables, whereas means were calcu-\nlated for continuous variables. We used\nan F statistic to test statistical differences\nbetween individuals with diagnosed dia-\nbetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and no dia-\nbetes. Given the low prevalence of\ndiabetes in our cohort, we collapsed cat-\negories of undiagnosed and diagnosed di-\nabetes together for multivariable analyses.\nFurthermore, 57 individuals with diabe-\ntes at wave IV (by self-report, A1C diag-\nnosis, or both) also self-reported diabetes\nat wave III. Because diabetes diagnosis\ncould result in purposeful changes in\nBMI resulting from diagnosis, use of med-\nications to improve A1C, or both, we\nconducted a sensitivity analysis, exclud-\ning individuals classified with diabetes\nbefore wave IV (results not shown); we\nfound almost identical results.\nWe used two separate multivariable\nlogistic regression models to examine the\nassociation between obesity timing and\nduration with prevalent diabetes. Effect\nmeasure modification by sex was exam-\nined using interaction terms and Wald\ntests (criterion, P , 0.15). We did not\nfind evidence of modification by sex for\nthe association between obesity duration\nand prevalent diabetes (P = 0.35), but we\ndid find evidence of modification by sex\nfor the association between obesity timing\nand prevalent diabetes (P = 0.03). For\ncomparability across timing and duration\nmodels, we included interaction by sex\nterms in all models. Given observed ra-\ncial/ethnic disparities for whites and\nblacks, we also used race interaction\nterms to determine whether the relation-\nin whites versus blacks. The low preva-\nlence of diabetes precluded our ability to\nexamine racial/ethnic disparities in His-\npanics and Asians and to examine a\nthree-way interaction between our main\nobesity exposures of race/ethnicity and\nsex. The final model predicted odds of\ndiabetes (undiagnosed and diagnosed)\nby obesity (timing or duration) and in-\ncluded confounders that met change-\nin-estimate criterion (.10% change in\nmain effect coefficient) or conceptual ra-\ntionale: age, sex (in race-stratified models),\nrace/ethnicity (in sex-stratifiedmodels),ed-\nucation, and parental history of diabetes\n(smoking was not included because it did\nnot meet change in estimate criterion). The\nfinal models were repeated with control for\ncurrent BMI, current WC, and age at men-\narche (women) to assess changes in esti-\nmates for obesity timing and duration\nonce current body size and menarche\nwere considered.\nRESULTSdApproximately 4% of the\nsample had diabetes; half of these cases\nwere undiagnosed (Table 1). Further-\nmore, the prevalence of diagnosed and\nundiagnosed diabetes varied signifi-\ncantly by race/ethnicity, with blacks and\nHispanics disproportionately affected.\nAmong whites, 2.2% had diagnosed dia-\nbetes and 0.6% had undiagnosed diabe-\ntes. In contrast, among blacks, 2.9% had\ndiagnosed diabetes and 9.6% had undiag-\nnosed diabetes. Among Hispanics, 3.5%\nhad diagnosed diabetes and 2.6% had un-\ndiagnosed diabetes.\nparticipants (37.2%) had been classified\nas obese at least once in the 13-year study\nperiod, and only a small percentage fluc-\ntuated in obesity status (Table 1).\nage 16 to before age 18); and 4) adult obesity (onset at or after the age of 18 years). B: Obesity duration from adolescence to adulthood was based on\nobesity status at waves II, III, and IV and categorized as follows: 1) never obese; 2) incident obesity (nonobese at baseline and became and remained\nobese through last examination); 3) fluctuating obesity (any shift in classification from obese to nonobese); and 4) persistent obesity (obese at all\nwaves). Prevalence of diabetes was based on total diabetes, which includes (C) both diagnosed diabetes (self-reported health care provider diagnosis\nof diabetes) and undiagnosed diabetes (A1C $6.5% with no reported diabetes diagnosis) unless otherwise noted.\nDiabetes: obesity timing and duration\nDiabetes prevalence during young adult-\nhood was highest among individuals who\nwere persistently obese from adolescence\ninto young adulthood.\nTotal diabetes prevalence differed\nacross categories of obesity timing (Fig.\n1A) and duration (Fig. 1B), and blacks\nand Hispanics were disproportionately\naffected. Although the prevalence of diag-\nnosed diabetes did not differ by race/eth-\nnicity, there were differences in rates of\nundiagnosed diabetes, which was highest\nin blacks (Fig. 1C).\nMultivariable analysis showed that the\nlikelihood of diabetes for individuals with\nadolescent obesity relative to those with\nobesity onset at or after 18 years of age\nWomen with onset of obesity during early\nadolescence (before 16 years of age) were at\nmore than a twofold higher risk of diabetes\nin early adulthood (odds ratio [OR] 2.77\nobesity onset at or after 18 years of age,\neven after controlling for current BMI\nonset of obesity between 16 and 18 years\nof age had slightly higher odds of diabetes\nthan those with onset at or after 18 years of\nage, but this association was not statistically\nsignificant. Men who had onset of obesity\nbefore 16 years of age had similar odds of\ndiabetes in young adulthood as men with\nobesity onset at or after age 18 years.\nAlthough individuals who were never\nobese were less likely to have diabetes\nduring young adulthood than those who\nbecame obese during young adulthood\n(Table 3), this relationship was signifi-\ncantly attenuated in blacks compared\nsity conferred a higher likelihood of dia-\nbetes during young adulthood than\nincident obesity in whites, but not blacks,\neven after controlling for current BMI (OR\nfor blacks were attenuated after control-\nbut became statistically significant after\n3.03]). Limitations of the sample sizes\nprecluded multivariable analyses for His-\npanics and Asians. However, unadjusted\nanalyses suggest that the relationship be-\ntween duration of obesity and prevalent\ndiabetes in Hispanics was similar to that\nin whites. In sensitivity analyses, includ-\ning diabetes medication as a criterion for\ndiagnosed diabetes yielded a similar pat-\ntern of results, albeit with larger confi-\ndence intervals around the estimates\n(results not shown).\nCONCLUSIONSdTaking advantage\nof nationally representative data, we ob-\nserved that 4.4% of our study population,\nslightly higher than estimates from indi-\nviduals enrolled in the National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey\nindividuals 20\u00ad39 years of age have dia-\nbetes (1). From SEARCH, a population-\nbased study of diabetes, approximately\nestimated to have diabetes diagnosed\nby a physician (23). Our nationally repre-\nsentative estimates suggest that approxi-\ntes; thus, the transition from adolescence\nto young adulthood is a sensitive period\nfor the development of diabetes. In addi-\ntion, our estimates suggest approximately\n$6.5% but have not been told by a health\ncare professional that they have diabetes,\nand a significantly higher proportion of\nthese individuals are black. These results\nare particularly concerning in that racial/\nethnic minorities may be at greater risk of\ncertain diabetes-related complications\n(e.g., end-stage renal disease, lower limb\namputations, and arterial stiffness [as a\nmarker of cardiovascular disease]) than\nings underscore the need for individual\nawareness of diabetes risk, access to\nhealth care, and physicians to screen for\ndiabetes in at-risk populations.\nAlthough current obesity is associ-\nated with diabetes risk (7,9,10) and some\nresearch suggests that adolescent obesity\nis associated with diabetes during young\nadulthood (27,28), history of obesity may\nprovide additional information about fu-\nture risk. Obesity during adolescence may\nbe more deleterious for insulin resistance\nand diabetes than obesity during other\nperiods of the life span. There are notable\nchanges in insulin sensitivity during pu-\nbertal development, and the adolescent\nTable 2dAdjusted OR (95% CIs)* from separate logistic regression models predicting\nprevalent diabetes in young adulthood (wave IV, 2007\u00ad2009) as a function of obesity timing\nand obesity duration, stratified by sex, from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent\nTotal Men Women\nObesity timing\nAdolescent obesity\nAdolescent obesity\n(onset at or after age 16 to\nAdult-onset obesity (at or\nafter age 18) Referent Referent Referent\nObesity duration (waves II,\nIII, and IV)\nIncident obesity Referent Referent Referent\n*Adjusted logistic regression model predicting odds of diabetes (total diabetes, which includes both di-\nagnosed diabetes and self-reported health care provider diagnosis of diabetes) and undiagnosed diabetes\n(A1C $6.5% with no reported diabetes diagnosis) by obesity (timing or duration), age, race/ethnicity, ed-\nucation, and parental history of diabetes. Timing of obesity was determined using the individual's age at the\nwave of initial obesity classification and categorized as follows: 1) never obese, 2) adolescent obesity (defined\nas initial classification of obesity before 16 years of age), 3) adolescent obesity (defined as initial classification\nof obesity between 16 and 18 years of age), and 4) adult obesity defined as obesity onset at or after 18 years of\nage. Significant effect measure modification by race/ethnicity (Wald test, P = 0.03). Obesity duration from\nadolescence to adulthood was based on obesity status at waves II, III, and IV and categorized as follows: 1)\nnever obese, 2) incident obesity (nonobese at baseline and became and remained obese through last exam-\nination), 3) fluctuating obesity (any shift in classification from obese to nonobese), and 4) persistent obesity\n(obese at all waves). Effect measure modification by race/ethnicity not statistically significant but is shown by\nstrata for comparability (Wald test, P = 0.35).\nThe, Richardson, and Gordon-Larsen\nperiod is one of increased insulin resis-\ntance, particularly for women (8). How-\never, duration of obesity likely plays a\nrole as well. We addressed this issue by\nexamining adolescent obesity onset be-\nfore 16 years of age as well as onset at or\nserved a significantly higher prevalence\nof diabetes in young adulthood among\nwomen who became obese before the\nage of 16 years compared with those\nwho became obese during young adult-\nhood, even after controlling for current\nsize and age at menarche. Our results sug-\ngest that the influence of early-onset obe-\nsity (before 16 years of age) may be\nparticularly deleterious for future diabe-\ntes risk for women and could potentially\nbe related to biological factors associated\nwith being obese during pubertal matu-\nration. Disentangling sex differences re-\nlated to the association between obesity\nand diabetes risk is an area with great po-\ntential for future research.\nObesity duration may also provide\nmore information about diabetes risk\nlonged duration of obesity may result in\nadditional metabolic changes, leading to\nthe development of hyperglycemia and\nliterature is mixed: whereas most studies\nreport a positive association between obe-\nothers report null associations (12,14). In\nour study, individuals with persistent\nobesity had the highest likelihood of di-\nabetes during young adulthood, even\ncompared with individuals with adult-\nonset obesity. Yet we observed attenuated\nrisk in blacks relative to whites that must\nbe put in context with the higher propor-\ntion of diabetes in nonobese blacks rela-\ntive to that in whites, which is consistent\nwith findings from another large multi-\nethnic study (33). Given that, on average,\nblacks have lower adiposity at a similar\nBMI than whites (34), we speculate that\nthe observed ethnic difference in the like-\nlihood of diabetes is attributed to other\nfactors beyond obesity. However, further\nresearch is needed to understand these\nracial/ethnic disparities.\nOur study has several limitations.\nFirst, Add Health uses A1C measure-\nments and self-report to classify diabetes.\nSecond, in our regression models we\ncollapsed all categories of diabetes. The\nresulting heterogeneous group includes\nthose with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and\nindividuals with undiagnosed diabetes (ei-\nther type 1 or 2 diabetes). It is unfortunate\nthat data limitations precluded us from\ndisentangling individuals with type 1 and\ntype 2 diabetes. The inclusion of individ-\nuals with type 1 diabetes may have atten-\nuated our results, although there is\nincreasing evidence that suggests a link\nbetween obesity and type 1 diabetes\n(35,36). The small proportion of individ-\nuals with undiagnosed diabetes precluded\nseparate multivariable analyses with this\ngroup. However, the inclusion of individ-\nuals with undiagnosed diabetes is not\nlikely to change our results because these\nindividuals would not have had a pur-\nposeful change in their weight as a result\nof diabetes diagnosis.\nGiven the schedule of examinations,\nwe were unable to determine exact age at\nthe onset of obesity or the exact duration\nof obesity. Instead, we know only the age\nof a given individual at each wave and that\nthe individual became obese before the\nwave II survey, became obese between the\nwaves of Add Health, or was not obese at\nthe time of the wave IV survey. In some\ncases (n = 586), we did not know whether\nan individual became obese before or after\n18 years of age (e.g., individuals who were\n16.5 years and nonobese at wave II and\n21.5 years and obese at wave III). For our\nmain analyses, these individuals were cat-\negorized with adult-onset obesity. We\nconducted a sensitivity analysis whereby\nwe reclassified these individuals as having\nadolescent-onset obesity and found larger\nestimated effect sizes in identical multi-\nvariable analyses, suggesting that our re-\nsults using the original categorization may\nbe conservative estimates.\nWe take advantage of rich longitudi-\nnal data from a racially and ethnically\ndiverse population followed over a period\nof increased risk for weight gain, but the\nsmall number of individuals with diabetes\nprecluded our ability to fully interrogate\ndifferences in Hispanics and Asians in\nmultivariable analyses. Nonetheless, our\ndescriptive analyses indicate that Hispan-\nics have a higher prevalence of diabetes\nduring young adulthood than whites,\nregardless of differences in onset and\nduration of obesity, which is consistent\nwith findings from National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey cross-\nsectional data, which examined concurrent\nBMI and diabetes (37). Our longitudinal\ndata also show that the association be-\ntween duration of obesity and diabetes\nmay be different in blacks versus whites.\nTo better understand the potentially differ-\nential effect of obesity on diabetes by race/\nethnicity, future research is needed using\nTable 3dAdjusted ORs (95% CIs)* from separate logistic regression models predicting\nprevalent diabetes in young adulthood (wave IV, 2007\u00ad2009) as a function of obesity timing\nand obesity duration, stratified by race/ethnicity, from the National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health, waves II through IV (N = 8,314)\nWhites Blacks\nObesity timing\nAdolescent obesity (onset at or after age\nAdult-onset obesity (at or after age 18) Referent Referent\nObesity duration (waves II, III, and IV)x\nIncident obesity Referent Referent\n*Adjusted logistic regression model predicting odds of diabetes: total diabetes, which includes both di-\nagnosed diabetes (self-reported health care provider diagnosis of diabetes) and undiagnosed diabetes (A1C\n$6.5% with no reported diabetes diagnosis) by obesity (timing or duration); age; race/ethnicity; education;\nsex; and parental history of diabetes.

Our find-\nings suggest that, in addition to current\nobesity, information about timing and\nduration of obesity are needed to fully\nunderstand and predict diabetes risk.
