Beto Criminal Justice Center, College of Criminal Justice, Sam Houston State University,\npublic incivilities have been an important part of theory and research on both\necological explanations of crime and explanations of citizen fear of crime.\nIncivilities are typically divided into two primary dimensions: social and\nphysical. Physical incivilities often include such things as broken windows and\nvacant lots, while social incivilities include loitering, loud parties, drug sales\nand prostitution. Within contemporary theories highlighting the importance of\nincivilities, social and physical incivilities are unique characteristics of neigh-\nborhoods causally linked to a number of important outcomes including crime\nRecently, the research incorporating measures of incivilities have been called\ninto question. Taylor (1999) notes that the discriminant validity of measures of\npublic incivilities has not been established in the literature. Despite this impor-\ntant challenge only two studies have directly addressed the discriminant validity\nof incivilities measures. These include Taylor's (1999) own work and a recent\ntest by Worrall (2006). While each of these studies represent an important\ncontribution, the discriminant validity of incivilities measures remains at issue.\nHere we contribute to this limited body of research by offering an additional\ntest of the discriminant validity of physical and social incivilities measures.\nThe Relationship between Incivilities, Crime, and Fear of Crime\nPublic incivilities or disorders have been linked to a number of outcomes includ-\ning fear of crime, crime and neighborhood decline. Early work emphasizing\nincivilities argued that citizen fear of crime was partially determined by incivil-\n(1978) theorized that signs of incivilities and crime have a reciprocal relation-\nship with each in turn influencing fear of crime. The interactive influence of\nincivilities and crime and fear of crime was further emphasized by Lewis and\nSalem (1986) who argued that citizen fear of crime will be particularly\npronounced when both crime and incivilities are high, and low when either fear\nof crime or crime itself is low.\nOther theoretical models ascribing an important causal influence to incivili-\nties have focused on the explanation of crime. In their Broken Windows theory,\nWilson and Kelling (1982) argue that public incivilities have an important\ninfluence on crime through informal social control. Incivilities are thought to\nlead to citizen withdrawal from public spaces, reducing informal social control\nand emboldening offenders. This in turn leads to fear of crime, additional\nwithdrawal and an increase in serious offenses. Extending the scope of\noutcomes influenced by incivilities, Skogan (1990) incorporates incivilities in an\nexplanation of urban decline. In this model, incivilities influence urban decline\nthough three primary mediating processes: (1) informal social control, (2)\ncommunity morale, contributed to by concerns about neighborhood safety or\nfear of crime, and (3) instability in the housing market.\nNot all scholars agree that incivilities cause crime. In work largely devoted to\ndeveloping and argument against order maintenance policing, Harcourt (2001)\nsummarily rejects the link between incivilities and crime specified by Wilson\nand Kelling. In a more moderate dissenting voice, Sampson and Raudenbush\n(1999) acknowledge incivilities have important implications for neighborhood\ndevelopment, while arguing both incivilities and crime are a result of the same\nexplanatory process. In this process, community structural characteristics,\nincluding concentrated disadvantage and residential instability, impact neigh-\nborhood collective efficacy, a mix of informal social control and social cohesion.\nThis general process then influences both incivilities and crime.\nThe Validity of Incivilities Measures\nSupport for a link between incivilities and crime and the link between incivili-\nties and fear of crime can be found in a growing number of studies (reviews and\nrecent studies include Brown, Perkins, & Brown, 2004; Covington & Taylor,\nquestion as to the validity of incivility measures used in studies testing the link\nbetween incivilities and crime.\nTaylor (1999) argues that theories specifying a link between incivilities and\ncrime \"propose that incivilities represent a construct separate from other\nrelated features of the individual, street block and neighborhood. But research-\ners have not yet examined the discriminant validity of incivilities indicators\"\n(p. 65). Discriminant validity, popularized through Campbell and Fiske's (1959)\nmultitrait-multimethod matrix technique for assessing construct validity, holds\nthat measures of multiple constructs taken with a single measurement method\nshould be empirically distinguishable from each other.\nIts not hard to imagine why it might be difficult to distinguish measures of\nincivilities from measures of fear of crime or measures of crime itself. As it is\ntypically defined in the literature, incivilities have much in common with crime.\nSome of the indicators of incivilities such as drug sales and prostitution, typically\nincorporated in incivilities measures, are less serious forms of crime. In theoret-\nical models it is anticipated that these less serious forms of crime, which are\nconceptualized as an element of a larger incivilities construct, will lead to serious\ncrime. While conceptually distinct, it remains to be seen of indicators of incivil-\nities, including forms of less serious crime can be empirically distinguished from\nmeasures of serious crime. It may be that perceptions of incivilities and percep-\ntion of crime are both driven by a more global impression of one's neighborhood.\nConcerns regarding discriminant validity of incivilities measures are particu-\nlarly relevant when measures of crime and incivilities are measured with a\nsingle survey. When addressing research on the relationship between incivilities\nand fear of crime, Taylor (1999) notes that the strong association between fear\nand incivilities may be in part attributable to shared method variance. Shared\nmethod variance occurs when two constructs are measured with the same\nmethod, and this shared measurement method increases the strength of\nconcerns regarding the influence of shared survey method variance on the\nrelationship between incivilities and fear can be extended to the relationship\nbetween incivilities and crime, further highlighting the need to establish the\ndiscriminant validity of incivilities measures.\nA handful of studies have addressed the discriminant validity of perceptual\nincivilities measures. Perceptual incivilities measures typically refer to incivili-\nties measures based on citizen perceptions of incivilities through a survey.\nStudies providing results relevant for a discussion of the validity of perceptual\nincivilities measures include work testing the association between incivilities\nand other non-crime neighborhood characteristics and work with a direct focus\non testing the discriminant validity of perceptual incivilities measures by assess-\ning the extent to which incivilities measures can be empirically distinguished\nfrom perceptual crime measures.\nWork exploring the relationship between incivilities measures and other non-\ncrime neighborhood characteristics provides mixed evidence regarding the\ndiscriminant validity of perceptual incivilities measures. Taylor (1995) found\nthat the racial composition of a neighborhood had a heavy influence on\nresidents' perceptions of graffiti prevalence. Other work by Taylor, Koons,\nKurtz, Greene, and Perkins (1995) has found perceptions of incivilities loaded on\nseparate factors than land-use features, but were not distinct from measures of\nterritorial signage and defensible space.\nSampson and Raudenbush (2004) explored the neighborhood characteristics\nthat influence resident perceptions of incivilities using data describing approxi-\nmately 500 block groups from 196 census tracts in the city of Chicago. Among\npotential predictors of perceived incivilities, the authors included measures of\nsocio-demographic characteristics and an observation measures of incivilities\n(for a full description of this measure see Sampson & Raudenbush, 1999).\nResults showed that the observational measure of incivilities predicted\nperceived incivilities, but \"racial and economic context matter more\" (p. 319).\nCollectively the work of Sampson and Raudenbush and that of Taylor show that\nit is difficult to discriminate between citizen perceptions of incivilities and\nother neighborhood characteristics including indicators of race, economic\ncontext, territorial signage and defensible space.\nRecently two studies have offered direct assessments of the discriminant\nvalidity of incivilities relative to crime. These studies are particularly important\nas they test the validity of measures of the incivilities construct. The incivilities\nconstruct has played a central role in causal models that have served as the\ntheoretical underpinning of order maintenance policing. Should the results of\nthese studies show that measures of incivilities are indistinguishable from\nmeasures of crime it would undermine weight that may be given the causal\nmodels that have been used to support order maintenance policing.\nAs part of a broad assessment of theory measurement and policy regarding\nincivilities, Taylor (1999) assessed the relationship between perceived incivili-\nties and official measures of crime using neighborhood level data from five\ncities. Indicators of incivilities included vandalism, rowdy teens and abandoned\nbuildings. Crime measures included rates of robbery and assault. Exploratory\nfactor analysis found incivilities measures and official crime rate measures\nloaded on separate factors. These results suggest that at the neighborhood level\nincivilities measures may be discriminable from official crime rate measures.\nWorrall (2006) offers the sole test of the discriminant validity of measures of\nperceived incivilities relative to measures of perceived crime and reports of\nvictimization. For this test, analyses were based on survey data from approxi-\nmately 14,000 respondents across 12 cities where police departments were\npracticing community policing.1 Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses\nprovided mixed results. Survey respondents were able to distinguish their\nperceptions of physical incivilities from their reports of victimization; however,\nthey were unable to distinguish their perceptions of social incivilities from their\nreports of victimization.\nResults for the discriminate validity of incivilities measures relative to\nrespondents' perceptions of crime did not support the discriminant validity of\nincivilities measures. Confirmatory factor analysis found that crime measurers\nand incivilities measures did not always load on distinct factors. Exploratory\nfactor analysis based on structural equation models yielded model fit statistics\nthat indicated that both factor models provided a poor fit to the data. Worrall\n(2006) concludes \"Thus additional research is called for before it can be known\nfor sure whether people can separate perceptions of crime from perceptions of\nMethod\nDespite its importance for ecological theories of crime and for police policy,\nrelatively little attention has been paid to the discriminant validity of measures\nof incivilities used in tests of neighborhood characteristics associated with\ncrime. In the current work we extended the limited literature on the discrimi-\nnant validity of perceptual incivilities measures by building on the work of\nWorrall (2006). Our analysis was based on data from a major Southwestern city.\nImportantly these data have a key methodological feature distinguishing them\nfrom the data used by Worrall (2006). The data used herein include indicators of\nperceived incivilities and perceived crime gathered with ordinal response\ncategories, while indicators of incivilities, and crime used in Worrall's (2006)\nstudy were dichotomous. We anticipate that this difference might lead to\ndifferent results. Ordinal response categories preserve information lost in\n1. Data collected with the Bureau of Justice Statistics Survey entitled \"Criminal Victimization and\ndichotomous response categories. This additional variation may make it possible\nto discriminate between responses to two closely linked but conceptually\ndistinct constructs such as incivilities and crime.\nSample\nAnalyses are based on data from Mesa, Arizona. Mesa has a relatively low level\nof unemployment (2.2%) and high median household income ($33,676), although\na number of its residents still live below the poverty line (10%). Mesa experi-\ncomposition of the community is diverse, with Caucasians making up approxi-\nAsians, 1.6%; and American Indians, 1.2%. Mesa's crime rate is somewhat higher\nthan that of some Southwestern cities (e.g., Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Diego),\nbut lower than that of others (e.g., Albuquerque, Phoenix).\nData were gathered with a survey of citizens residing in Mesa, Arizona. The\nsurvey sample consisted of 800 randomly selected respondents.2 Survey data\nwere collected using a telephone survey conducted in September and October\n2002. Households included in the sample were drawn at random, with any\nmember over the age of 17 eligible to complete the interview. The survey took\napproximately 20 minutes to administer. It included questions about the respon-\ndents' perceptions of physical and social incivilities, perceptions of crime, and\nreports of victimization. Sample characteristics are presented in Table 1.\nVariables\nData included indicators of respondents' perceptions of incivilities and crime as\nwell as respondent reports of victimization.\nPerceived incivilities\nRespondents were asked to indicate the extent to which 14 indicators of incivil-\nities were prevalent in their neighborhood. Responses were: \"not a problem,\"\n\"somewhat of a problem,\" and \"big problem.\" Incivilities measures included\nseven indicators of physical incivilities and six indicators of social incivilities.\nIndicators of physical incivilities included broken windows, unkempt property,\n2. About 75% of those contacted agreed to participate in the survey. Just fewer than 2% were unable\nto complete it due to language barriers; all others who refused stated that they were not available\nto complete the survey at the time, or asked that the interviewer call back at another time. Our\nsample contained slightly more Whites and included a greater number of older persons and women\nwhen compared with the city's general population.\nvandalism/graffiti, vacant lots, vacant houses/buildings, abandoned cars and\ntrash. Indicators of social incivilities included groups of loitering teenagers,\ndrunks or tramps, harassment, people fighting or arguing, noisy neighbors, and\ndrug dealing.\nPerceived crime\nRespondents' perceptions of crime in their neighborhood were based on\nresponses to questions regarding the prevalence of four crimes: burglary, car\ntheft, robbery and assault. Response categories were: \"not a problem,\" \"some-\nwhat of a problem,\" \"a big problem.\" For each crime type respondents were\nasked two questions. The first addressed respondents' perceptions regarding\nnon-gang related crime, the second addressed respondent perceptions regarding\ngang related crime. For example, the first question addressing respondents'\nTable 1 Sample characteristics\nVariable Characteristic Percentage\nEducation Below high school 5.7\nSome postgraduate 4.9\nMean Standard deviation\nperceptions of robbery in their neighborhood asked \"in your neighborhood is\nnon-gang related robbery, not a problem, somewhat of a problem, or a big\nproblem.\" The second question asked how much of a problem gang related\nrobbery was. To create a single indicator of respondent perceptions of each\ncrime type, responses to both questions addressing a single type of crime were\nsummed and then returned to their original metric.\nVictimization\nVictimization measures included general indicators of direct personal victim-\nization and indirect vicarious victimization. Personal victimization was\nmeasured with a question asking the respondent to indicate whether or not in\nthe past 12 months they have been \"verbally harassed, physically intimi-\ndated, assaulted, robbed or had their property vandalized or stolen.\" Indirect\nvictimization was measured by asking respondents to indicate whether or not\nsomeone in their household or a neighbor had been \"verbally harassed, physi-\ncally intimidated, assaulted, robbed or had their property vandalized or\nstolen.\"\nAnalysis\nFollowing Worrall (2006), we conducted a two-stage test of the discriminant\nvalidity of measures of perceived incivilities. The first stage was an exploratory\nfactor analysis based on traditional factor analytic techniques. The second stage\nwas a confirmatory factor analysis based on structural equation measurement\nmodels. This approach is widely used in fields with an emphasis on the demon-\nstration of the discriminant validity of key constructs (for examples and key\n1989; Marsh & Bailey, 1991). Prior to our test of discriminant validity we split\nthe overall sample into two randomly selected subsamples (Hayduk, 1987).\nExploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were each based on a distinct\nsubsample.\nIn the first stage of analysis, traditional factor analytic techniques were used\nto determine whether or not measures of incivilities loaded on a factor distinct\nfrom measures of perceived crime and reports of victimization. In this stage,\nmeasures of perceptions of incivilities have discriminant validity relative to\nmeasures of perceived crime when each set of measures loads on a distinct\nfactor.\nIn the second stage of analysis, structural equation measurement models\nwere used to confirm the results of exploratory factor analysis. Fit statistics\nfrom structural equation models evaluate the overall fit of distinct factor struc-\ntures. In this stage, discriminant validity is indicated when a model specifying\ntwo distinct factors, for example perceived incivilities and perceived crime, has\nadequate model fit and represents an improvement in fit over a one-factor\nmodel.\nIn each stage of our data analysis, we use analytical techniques that can\naccommodate ordinal and dichotomous measures. Traditional factor analysis and\nstructural equation modeling techniques assume that indicators are continuous.\nOur measures of perceived incivilities and perceived crime were ordinal and our\nmeasures of reported victimization were dichotomous. When data are measured\nat the ordinal level, factor analysis and structural equation models can be based\non the polychoric correlation matrix. Similarly, when data are measured at the\ndichotomous level, factor analysis and structural equation models may be based\non the tetrachoric correlation matrix.3 Both the tetrachoric and polychoric\ncorrelations approximate the Pearson correlation that one would obtain if data\nwere measured continuously. For the current analysis, tetrachoric and poly-\nchoric correlations were obtained using LISREL 8.80.\nAn initial review of the data revealed that across all measures of respon-\ndents' perceptions of crime in their neighborhood just over 22% of the sample\ndid not provide a valid response to at least one of the crime measures. Across\nthe other types of measures included in our data--social and physical incivilities\nand reports of victimization--missing data were much less common ranging from\n3.25% to 8.36%. Among measures of respondents' perception of crime missing\ndata were largely attributable to responses of \"don't know\" to queries regard-\ning the prevalence of different types of crime.\nTo assess the potential impact of missing data on the generalizability of our\nresults, we compared those having missing data for any crime measure to those\nwith responses for each crime measure across a number of demographic charac-\nteristics. Those missing data for any crime measures were not significantly\ndifferent from those with complete data for crime measures with regard to\nhomeownership, income, marriage, and age; however, those missing data for\nany crime measure were more likely to have reported a higher level of educa-\ntion, had lived in their neighborhoods longer and were more likely to be White.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics for measures of perceived incivilities, perceived crime and\nreported victimization are presented in Table 2. For measures of perceived\nsocial incivilities mean values were highest for noisy neighbors and loitering.\nAcross indicators of perceived physical incivilities unkempt property and vandal-\nism/graffiti had the highest mean values. Mean values for perceived crime show\nthat perceptions of property crime were elevated relative to perceptions of\nviolent crime. With regard to victimization, means for these measures show that\n3. For a discussion of the derivation of polychoric and tetrachoric correlations, see Drasgow (1988)\nand Harris (1988). Schumacker and Beyerlein (2000) review the use of polychoric and tetrachoric\ncorrelations in confirmatory factor analysis, and Bollen (1989) details the use of polychoric and\ntetrachoric correlations in structural equation modeling.\nreports of indirect victimization were more common than reports of personal\nvictimization.\nExploratory Factor Analysis\nThe discriminant validity of measures of perceived incivilities was assessed with\nan exploratory factor analysis, where measures of physical incivilities and\nmeasures of perceived crime were initially constrained to load on a single\nfactor. Subsequently, these measures were allowed to load on two factors.\nResults for these factor analyses are presented on the left half of Table 3. The\nfirst column of coefficients are factor loadings for both physical incivilities and\nperceived crime on a single factor, the second and third columns of coefficients\nare factor loadings for physical incivilities and perceived crime for two distinct\nfactors.\nIn an exploratory factor analysis of this type discriminant validity is indicated\nwhen measures of physical incivilities and measures of perceived crime load on\ntwo distinct factors. Results show that this was largely the case for our\nmeasures of perceived physical incivilities and perceived crime. Six of seven,\nTable 2 Descriptive statistics\nVariable M SD Minimum Maximum Observations\nPerceived incivilities\nPerceived crime\nReported victimization\nmeasures of perceived physical incivilities had elevated values for the first\nfactor in the two-factor model (second column of coefficients) and had low\nvalues for the second factor (third column of coefficients) in the two-factor\nmodel. In a single noteworthy exception to this general pattern, the indicator of\nrespondent perceptions of vandalism/graffiti had a lower loading on the first\nfactor.\nMeasures of perceived crime had low values for the first factor in the two-\nfactor model (second column of coefficients) and high values for the second\nfactor in the two-factor model (third column of coefficients). Overall, these\nresults indicate that with the exception of perceptions of vandalism/graffiti the\nindicators of physical incivilities included in our factor analysis had discriminant\nvalidity relative to measures of crime perceptions.\nThe procedure outlined above was also applied to measures of social incivili-\nties and measures of crime perceptions. Results are presented in the right half\nof Table 3. In the two-factor model, factor loadings for indicators of social\nincivilities were all elevated for the first factor and lower for the second factor.\nFactor loadings for three measures of perceived crime--burglary, car theft,\nTable 3 Exploratory factor analysis results for perceived incivilities and perceived crime\nPhysical incivilities Social incivilities\nIndicator 1 factor 2 factors 1 factor 2 factors\nPhysical incivilities\nSocial incivilities\nPerceived crime\nrobbery--are all low for the first factor and high for the second factor. In\ncontrast, factor loadings for respondent perceptions of assault are similar across\nthe first (.62) and second factor (.59). These results show that measures of\nsocial incivilities are discriminable from measures of burglary, car theft and\nrobbery.\nExploratory factor analysis was also used to test the discriminant validity of\nindicators of perceived incivilities relative to reports of personal and indirect\nvictimization.4 Results are presented in Table 4. In the two-factor model for\nperceived physical incivilities, six of seven measures of perceived physical\nincivilities have large factor loadings on the first factor and relatively small\nfactor loadings for the second factor. A single indicator of perceived physical\nincivilities, vandalism/graffiti, has a factor loading that is slightly lower on the\nfirst factor than on the second factor. Victimization reports have small factor\nloadings on the first factor and large factor loadings on the second.\n4. For the exploratory factor analysis of perceived incivilities and reported victimization measures,\nindicators of perceived incivilities were dichotomized to match the level of measurement of victim-\nization reports.\nTable 4 Exploratory factor analysis results for perceived incivilities and reported\nvictimization\nPhysical incivilities Social incivilities\nIndicator 1 factor 2 factors 1 factor 2 factors\nPhysical incivilities\nSocial incivilities\nPerceived crime\nFor the two-factor model with perceived social incivilities and victimization\nreports, all indicators of perceived social incivilities have high factor loadings on\nthe first factor and lower factor loadings on the second factor. This pattern is\nreversed for victimization reports. This pattern suggests that measures of social\nincivilities have discriminant validity relative to reports of victimization.\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis\nStructural equation models used in our confirmatory factor analysis are\npresented in Figures 1 and 2. When we explore the factor structure of measures\nof perceived physical incivilities relative to measures of perceived crime, there\nare 11 observed in indicators (from X1 to X11). These observed indicators are our\nseven indicators of perceived physical incivilities and four indicators of\nperceived crime. In the first model, depicted in Figure 1, each of the observed\nindicators is jointly determined by a single underlying latent factor (), in\ncombination with a unique error term (from 1 to 11). The magnitude of\nexpected change in each of the observed indicators attendant to change in the\nlatent factor is indicated by lambda ().\nFigure 1 Confirmatory factory analysis: One-factor model.\nFigure 2 Confirmatory factory analysis: Two-factor model.\nModel fit and identification\nIn confirmatory factor analysis, discriminant validity is indicated when two-\nfactor models provide a fit to the data that is better than the fit of the one factor\nmodel and above the threshold for adequate fit. There are a number of indices\nFigure 1 Confirmatory factory analysis: One factor model.\nof fit for structural equation models. In assessing model fit no single statistic\nnecessarily indicates the fit of a structural equation model. Rather model fit is\nby assessing values on a number of distinct fit statistics (Hu & Bentler, 1999;\nJaccard & Wan, 1996; Kline, 1998). Here we utilize the same four measures of fit\nFigure 2 Confirmatory factory analysis: Two factor model.\nused by Worrall (2006). These measures are the ratio of Chi-square to the degrees\nof freedom (CMIN/DF), the adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), Hoelter's\n(1983) Critical N, and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).\nThese measures represent a reasonable cross-section of available fit statistics\nand will jointly allow a comprehensive assessment of model fit.5\nThough there is some variability in the literature, it is generally accepted that\nCMIN/DF ratios smaller than three indicate that the model provides a good fit to\nTypically values over .9 are regarded as having good fit (Bentler, 1990).\nHoelter's (1983) Critical N represents the largest sample size at which you would\nfail to reject the hypothesis that the model provides adequate fit. Critical N\nvalues over 200 are indicative of good fit. The RMSEA is described by Browne and\nCudeck (1989) as asking the question \"How well would the model, with unknown\nbut optimally chosen parameter values, fit the population covariance matrix if it\nthat RMSEA values less than .05 are indicative of good fit (MacCallum, Browne, &\nSugawara, 1996), but recently Hu and Bentler (1999) have argued that this crite-\nria should be relaxed with values below .06 indicating good fit.\nIn confirmatory factor analysis, the unmeasured latent variables, perceived\nphysical incivilities for example, have no predetermined scale. As a conse-\nquence, it is necessary to specify structural equation models in such a way as to\ndetermine the scale of the latent factor(s). The most straightforward and\ncommon method for determining the scale of a latent factor is to constrain the\nvalue of one-factor loading to one for each latent factor included in the\nstructural equation model. In our confirmatory factor analyses there is a single\nlatent factor in the first model, and therefore one-factor loading constrained to\nbe one, and two latent factors in the second model and therefore two-factor\nloadings constrained to be one.\nConfirmatory factor analysis results\nResults for the confirmatory factor analyses based on indicators of perceived\nphysical incivilities and indicators of perceived crime are presented on the left\nhand side of Table 5. Fit statistics show that the one-factor model provided a\nmediocre fit to the data. Some fit indices indicated adequate model fit (CMIN/\nDF and Critical N), while others indicated model fit is unsatisfactory (AGFI,\nRMSEA). When a two-factor model was used, model fit improved somewhat but\nthe AGFI was still relatively low. A similar pattern of results was found in\nstructural equation models testing the factor structure of perceived social\nincivilities indicators relative to perceived crime indicators. Again some fit\n5. With four fit statistics we meet the recommendation of Jaccard and Wan (1996) who recommend\nthe use of at least three fit statistics and the more stringent recommendation of Kline (1998, p. 130)\nwho suggests the use of four or more.\nindices indicated adequate model fit, while others indicated model fit is unsat-\nisfactory. Model fit improved with the two-factor model but the AGFI remained\nlow.\nNext, we explored the extent to which model fit for the two-factor models\npresented in Table 5 could be improved by allowing errors to correlate. The\ntwo-factor models specified in Table 5 assumed error terms were uncorrelated.\nHowever, it seems reasonable to suggest that the unmeasured characteristics\nthat determine respondents' perceptions of the prevalence of vacant lots may\nalso influence respondent perceptions of vacant houses, or in structural\nequation modeling terms, the errors terms for the indicators of perceptions of\nvacant lost and perceptions of vacant houses are correlated.

When two-factor models were estimated, model fit improved and fit\nstatistics indicated that these models provided a good fit to the data. The\nRMSEA for the two-factor model incorporating indicators of perceived physical\nincivilities reached the cut off point advocated by Hu and Bentler (1999) and the\nRMSEA for the two-factor model incorporating indicators of perceived social\nincivilities meet the more stringent criteria advocated by others (MacCallum,\nDiscussion\nThe results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis provide mixed\nevidence regarding the discriminant validity of measures of perceived incivilities\nrelative to measures of perceived crime and victimization reports. Overall, we\nfind fairly consistent evidence that measures of incivilities enjoy discriminant\nvalidity relative to victimization reports. Our results for the discriminant validity\nof perceptual incivilities measures relative to respondents' perceptions of crime\nwere less consistent. Below we first discuss our results for analyses testing the\ndiscriminant validity of measures of perceived incivilities relative to victimization\n6. Correlations among error terms for physical incivilities measures were between error terms for\nbroken windows and unkempt properties and between error terms for unkempt property and vacant\nlots. Correlations among error terms for perceived crime were between error terms for burglary and\nassault and between error terms for car theft and robbery.\n7. The correlation among error terms for social incivilities measures was between error terms for\nloitering and drunks/homeless. The correlation among error terms for perceived crime indicators\nwas between the error term for car theft and the effort term for burglary.\nreports. We then discuss results for analyses testing the discriminant validity of\nmeasures of perceived incivilities relative to measures of perceived crime.\n  and Victimization Reports\nThe majority of results for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis showed\nthat perceptual incivilities measures and victimization reports loaded on distinct\nfactors. The single exception to this general pattern came in exploratory factor\nanalysis where an indicator of physical incivilities--vandalism/graffiti--had a\nfactor loading opposite of other indicators of physical incivilities and consistent\nwith victimization reports. Regarding the discriminant validity of social incivili-\nties measures relative to victimization reports exploratory and confirmatory\nTable 7 Confirmatory factor analysis results for perceived incivilities and reported\nvictimization\nPhysical incivilities Social incivilities\nIndicator Est. SE Est. SE Est. SE Est. SE\nPhysical incivilities\nSocial incivilities\nReported victimization\nFit statistics\nfactor analyses both indicated incivilities measures and victimization reports\nloaded on distinct factors.\n  and Perceptions of Crime\nExploratory and confirmatory analysis of perceived incivilities measures and\nmeasures of perceptions of crime provided equivocal results. Exploratory factor\nanalysis showed that perceived incivilities indicators and crime perceptions\nindicators loaded on distinct factors with two important exceptions. A single\nindicator of physical incivilities--vandalism/graffiti--had a higher factor loading\non the factor favored by each of the crime perceptions indicators. As noted\nearlier, factor loadings for this same indicator of physical incivilities were also\nreversed when indicators of perceived incivilities were included in exploratory\nfactor analyses with victimization reports.\nIn the second exception the pattern outlined above, exploratory factor\nanalysis showed that one of our crime measures, perceptions of assault, had a\nfactor loading consistent with loadings from social incivilities measures. This\nresult shows that respondents were unable to discriminate perceptions of\nassault from perceptions of social incivilities. Respondents may be unable to\ndiscriminate perceptions of assault from perceptions of social incivilities due\nto the content of some of the social incivilities measures. One measure in\nparticular, fighting/arguing seems to index a range of behaviors that overlaps\nconsiderably with the behaviors that would qualify as assault in the eyes of\nthose responding to the survey.\nIn confirmatory factor analysis of perceived incivilities measures and\nmeasures of perceived crime, we were able to estimate two-factor models that\nprovided what can be regarded as an adequate fit to the data by allowing a\nlimited number of correlations among errors for perceived incivilities measures\nand among errors for perceived crime measures.\nComparing Our Results with those of Worrall (2006)\nIn our analyses we extended Worrall's (2006) work by using perceived incivili-\nties measures and perceived crime measures taken at the ordinal level. As a\nwhole, our results are more supportive of the discriminant validity of percep-\ntual incivilities measures. At this time it seems reasonable to attribute this\ndifference, at least in part, to differences across the two studies in the level of\nmeasurement for incivilities measures. We use ordinal level data, while\nWorrall's (2006) analysis was based on binary data. Therefore when contrasted\nwith the work of Worrall (2006), our results suggest that the measures of\nperceived incivilities taken at higher levels of measurement will provide stron-\nger evidence of discriminant validity. We recognize, however, that other\ndifferences between our study and that of Worrall (2006) may also play a part\nin explaining differences in results across the two studies. Other important\ndifferences include differences in measures of incivilities and differences in\nmeasures of crime perceptions.\nIn both studies, the measures of perceived physical incivilities included indi-\ncators of abandoned cars/buildings, unkempt property, trash and vacant lots.\nUnique indicators of perceived physical incivilities included in our study were\nbroken windows, vandalism, and vacant houses. Unique indicators of perceived\nphysical incivilities in the work of Worrall (2006) were poor lighting and over-\ngrown shrubs/trees.\nIndicators of perceived social incivilities held in common by the respective\nstudies included drug sales, loitering, drunks/tramps, and harassment. Items\nused to measure perceived social incivilities in the current work but not\nemployed in the measure of perceived social incivilities used by Worrall (2006)\nwere fighting and arguing and noisy neighbors. Items used by Worrall (2006) to\nmeasure perceived social incivilities, but not included in the measure of\nperceived social incivilities employed in the current work were vandalism/\ngraffiti, prostitution, and truancy/skip school. It is important to note, differ-\nences across the results presented here and those of Worrall (2006) may be\ninfluenced by the differences in measurement outlined above. Similarly,\ndifferences in results across the two studies may also be influenced by differ-\nences in the types of crime assessed by perceptual crime measures.\nThough still best described as equivocal, the results of our exploratory and\nconfirmatory factor analysis of perceived incivilities measures and perceived\ncrime measures suggest that these two sets of measures load on distinct factors.\nIn contrast, Worrall (2006) concluded that the poor fit of two-factor models\nindicated \"respondents were unable to distinguish between perceived crime and\neither physical or social incivilities\" (p. 376).\nWhile some of the differences between the results of our factor analysis\nand those of Worrall's (2006) may be attributable to differences in level of\nmeasurement and differences in incivilities measures, differences may also be\nattributable to the type of crime perceptions measured in the two respective\nstudies. Worrall (2006) included measures of respondents' perceptions of auto\ntheft, theft of property, breaking and entering, violent attacks, gun crime, and\nsexual assault/rape. In our study we included measures of respondent percep-\ntions of burglary, car theft, robbery and assault.\nWorrall's (2006) exploratory factor analysis showed that respondents were able\nto clearly distinguish perceptions of theft of property and breaking and entering\nfrom both physical and social incivilities. Perceptions of violent attacks and gun\ncrime were also distinct from both but to a lesser degree. In our exploratory factor\nanalysis, respondents were able to distinguish perceptions of burglary, car theft\nand robbery from perceptions of both physical and social incivilities.\nDifferences across the two sets of results under consideration here can also\nbe found for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of perceptions of inci-\nvilities relative to victimization reports. Our results showed that measures of\nboth physical and social incivilities and reports of victimization tended to load\non distinct factors. Worrall (2006) reported that \"exploratory and confirmatory\nfactor analysis revealed that perceptions of incivilities (of the physical variety)\nloaded on factors separate from personal victimization\" (p. 360), but found\ntwo-factor confirmatory factor analysis models for measures of social incivilities\nand victimization reports provided a poor fit to the data.\nTo summarize, our results advance the literature by testing the discriminant\nvalidity of perceptual incivilities measures with ordinal data, while previous\nwork relied on binary data. Contrasting the results of our work with that of\nWorrall (2006) suggests that ordinal measures of perceptual incivilities provide\nstronger evidence of discriminant validity than binary measures. We also\nadvance the literature by testing the discriminant validity of perceptual incivili-\nties measures relative to a different set of crime measures than that used in\nearlier research. This proves to be an important extension of the earlier litera-\nture when exploratory factor analysis shows that our measure of perceptions of\nrobbery, a measure not included in earlier work, is distinct from measures of\nperceptions of both physical and social incivilities. Finally, we find that\nevidence for the discriminant validity of perceptions of incivilities is strongest\nwhen these measures are contrasted with victimization reports rather than\nmeasures of crime perceptions. We should note that this finding is consistent\nwith the work of Worrall (2006), suggesting that future work incorporating\nperceptual incivilities measures should also incorporate measures of crime that\ninclude victimization reports.\nConclusions\nOverall, the pattern of results discussed above suggests that the answer to the\nquestion, \"Do measures of perceived incivilities have discriminant validity\nrelative to measures of perceived crime,\" depends on just what we mean by\nperceived incivilities and perceived crime. To the extent to which these\nmeasures tend to overlap conceptually, we may anticipate that they will also\nlack discriminant validity. This is illustrated in our data by the fighting/arguing\nindicator of social incivilities and of respondents' perceptions of the prevalence\nof assault. Conversely, we may anticipate that conceptually distinct measures\nmay provide stronger evidence for discriminant validity.\nWhat is used as an indicator of incivilities and what is used as an indicator of\ncrime is a particularly nuanced issue among theories specifying a relationship\nbetween incivilities and crime. In what is perhaps the foremost of these theo-\nries, Wilson and Kelling (1982, 2006) argue that incivilities include pubic order\ncrimes such as drug dealing and prostitution can lead to more serious crime.\nWilson and Kelling go so far as to specify that robbery is the crime that should\nbe most influenced by variation in incivilities. If this is the case we should antic-\nipate that incivilities and robbery, though related, should enjoy discriminant\nvalidity relative to each other. Indeed our analysis provides some evidence that\nthis is indeed the case (see factor loadings for robbery Table 3).\ninfluence other forms of serious crime including burglary/breaking and enter-\ning. Results from exploratory factor analysis and those of Worrall (2006) suggest\nthat respondents are able to distinguish between perceptions of burglary and\nbreaking entering and perceptions of incivilities. These results, in contrast with\nresults showing respondents have a difficult time distinguishing other measures\nof crime from perceptions of incivilities, underscore the extent to which the\ndiscriminant validity of perceptions of incivilities relative to perceptions of\ncrime depends heavily on what are included as indicators of crime and what are\nincluded as indicators of incivilities. This variability in turn underscores\nthe need to further assess the extent to which we can use exploratory factor\nanalysis to inform confirmatory factor analyses.\nWhen we use exploratory factor analyses to inform confirmatory factor\nanalysis, perceived crime measures with factor loadings inconsistent with\ndiscriminant validity are dropped when we estimate confirmatory factor analy-\nsis models. Such an analysis moves beyond testing the discriminant validity of\nexisting sets of indictors of crime perceptions and perceptions of incivilities, in\nan attempt to develop guidance regarding the creation of measures that actu-\nally have discriminant validity.\nRecently scholars have called into question the discriminant validity of\nWhile far from closing the question, results to date suggest respondents'\nperceptions of physical incivilities are distinct from their reports of victimiza-\ntion. Results regarding the extent to which respondents are able to distinguish\nbetween social incivilities and victimization reports and between incivilities in\ngeneral and crime are far less conclusive.\nExploratory factor analyses presented here and in the work of Worrall (2006)\nshow that the relationship between perceptions of incivilities and perceptions\nof crime varies across different crime types. Further, analyses presented here\nprovide modest evidence for the discriminant validity of incivilities measures\nrelative to particular types of crime. Future research should employ additional\nconfirmatory factor analyses outlined above in an attempt to determine\nwhether or not more conclusive evidence for the discriminant validity of\nperceptions of incivilities relative to perceptions of crime may be developed.\nReferences\nAnderson, J.
