The first dimension is the\nmotivation to selectively attract or avoid interactions with different people. The second\ndimension is the behavioral display of either personal capacity or trustworthiness cues,\noften through the expression of dominant and submissive behaviors, respectively (Vigil, in\npress). Sex differences in affect behaviors (e.g., externalizing vs. internalizing displays)\nmay reflect developmental sensitivities to advertise capacity and trustworthiness cues\nsomewhat differently, due to the unique social dynamics and relational constraints under\nwhich males and females evolved. In this study, I use a series of self-report questionnaires\nto examine two basic assumptions of the framework. The first assumption is that sex\ndifferences in nonverbal affect behaviors (aggression vs. crying) reflect the desire for, and\nare effective for causing other people to either avoid or comfort the individual, respectively.\nI hypothesized that males would report a greater likelihood of responding to various\ndistress moods with aggressive, rather than crying behaviors, and that males would desire,\nand believe male peers similarly desire distancing responses from others when feeling these\nmoods. Instead, females were hypothesized to report more crying behaviors, and to desire,\nand believe female peers desire more comforting responses from others. The second\nassumption is that people are more accurate at inferring the desired social responses (i.e., to\nbe left alone or comforted when experiencing distress) of same-sex, rather than opposite-\nsex peers. I hypothesized that people's beliefs of same-sex peers are more similar to the\nself-reported desires of the male and female participants, themselves, than their beliefs of\nopposite-sex peers. The results are consistent with the first assumption, but show that only\nmen were more accurate at inferring same-sex, rather than opposite-sex desires. In general,\nthe findings are consistent with the socio-relational framework that suggests that humans\nmay have evolved specialized expressive behaviors and interpersonal styles for\ncommunicating and interacting with same-sex affiliates.\nSex differences in affect behavior\n",

Girls and women, in contrast, express higher levels of behaviors, such as\ncrying, that are instead associated with the perception of nurturance, submissiveness, and\ncompassion (Montepare and Dobish, 2003; Van Tilburg, Unterberg, and Vingerhoets,\n2002; Williams, 1982). In this article I describe a meta-theoretical framework that attempts\nto help understand the social properties (socially relevant information) that may underlie\nvariation in the expression of affect behaviors (e.g., expressed anger vs. sadness), as well\nas the social, evolutionary constraints that may have selected divergent expressive styles in\nmales and females. I then examine some basic assumptions of the framework, including the\nhypotheses that sex differences in distress behaviors may be effective for causing other\npeople to react in systematic and distinct (e.g., sex-typical) ways, and that people are more\naccurate at inferring the desired social responses (i.e., to be either left alone or consoled\nwhen distressed) of same-sex, rather than opposite-sex peers.\nThe Socio-Relational Framework of Expressive Behaviors\nI recently proposed a Socio-Relational Framework of Expressive Behaviors (SRFB;\nVigil, in press), which suggests that variation in the expression of discrete affect behaviors,\nsuch as anger and sadness, can be understood in terms of two primary dimensions of\nbehavioral responses. The first dimension is based on the basic (\"reptilian\") motivational\nsystem designed to either approach or withdraw from environmental stimuli (Buck, 1999;\nDavidson, 1993; Davidson, Jackson, and Kalin, 2000; see also, Cacioppo, Klein, Berntson,\nsystem may be especially sensitive to evaluate potential benefits and dangers of interacting\nwith different people and engaging in different types of relationships (Andersen and Chen,\nCaldwell, and Conley, 2005). Interactions that signal the potential to provide reciprocated\ninvestment should stimulate affiliative responses (e.g., interpersonal attraction, bonding,\nprotection, and comforting behaviors) and associated emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, and\nsympathy). Instead, interactions that are perceived to be non-reciprocal, and thus\npotentially exploitive, should stimulate avoidant responses (e.g., expressed hostility) and\nemotions (e.g., fear, disgust, and anger) designed to protect the individual. In this sense, all\nsocial (expressive) behaviors should be identifiable along an affiliative/avoidant dimension\nof behavioral response, depending on whether the behavior usually results in social\nbonding or in social distancing, across individual relationships. Importantly, some affect\nSex differences in affect behavior\nbehaviors such as sadness are pleiotropic (resulting in multiple outcomes), and can result in\nboth social bonding (e.g., among intimate affiliates) and in social distancing (e.g., among\nless familiar affiliates), depending on the context of the relationship (Vigil, in press).\nThe second dimension that may help explain variation in expressive behaviors is the\ndisplay of the two most fundamental properties of reciprocity potential, or attractiveness as\na social partner (e.g., mate, friend, community member, etc.). Specifically, I previously\nhypothesized that that these essential properties can be conceptualized as the individual's\n(a) perceived capacity to either help or hurt other people, and their (b) perceived\ntrustworthiness or probability of actually reciprocating altruism (Vigil, 2007). These two\nelementary concepts (capacity and trustworthiness) may be the most parsimonious\nproperties (irreducible characteristics) by which social evaluations and expressive\nbehaviors are based. This is because insufficient levels of either of these constructs (e.g.,\nhaving a lot to offer but being unwilling to do so, or being willing but having nothing to\noffer) results in little impact to others. This thesis is supported by recent research showing\nthat people are particularly sensitive to process cues of competency and trustworthiness in\nhuman faces (Todorov, 2008, Todorov, Mandisodza, Goren, and Hall, 2005; Willis and\nFrom the perspective of the SRFB, humans should also be sensitive to advertise\ncues of capacity and trustworthiness to other people through myriad expressive behaviors,\nand especially through behaviors that are perceived as dominant or submissive. Traits (e.g.,\nhealthiness and independence) and affect behaviors that are perceived as dominant, such as\nexpressed joy and anger, may be functional for signaling the capacity to reciprocate with\nother people (affiliation) and the ability to protect oneself (avoidance), respectively. Traits\n(e.g., feebleness and dependence) and affect behaviors that are perceived as submissive\n(e.g., fear and sadness) may instead operate (in part) to exaggerate the display of\nvulnerability in order to reduce the perception of threat (avoidance) and to signal deference\n(affiliation), and hence the trustworthiness component of reciprocity potential to other\npeople (Vigil, in press).\nResearch on social relationships suggests that people adjust preference for\n(affiliative) capacity attributes (e.g., physical healthiness, intelligence, material resources)\nand trustworthiness attributes (e.g., kindness, responsibility) in relation to the expected\nduration of the relationship. For example, research on mate preferences shows that both\nmen and women place greater emphasis on preference for high capacity traits rather than\nhigh trustworthiness traits when anticipating short-term relationships. In contrast, people\nincrease preference for higher levels of trustworthiness traits than personal capacity\nattributes when seeking long-term or more exclusive partners (e.g., Cottrell, Neuberg, and\nOther research shows that people adjust the display of affect behaviors in relation to\nsocial situational factors, such as the perceived social status, group size, familiarity, and\nrelationship history of audience members (e.g., Chapman, 1973; Fridlund, 1991; Kraut and\nJohnston, 1979). Several studies, for example, have shown that people increase the display\nof externalizing behaviors (e.g., aggression) and overall capacity cues (e.g., expressed\nconfidence) in larger group settings, and instead increase the expression of internalizing\nbehaviors (e.g., sadness and worrying) and overall trustworthiness cues (e.g., expressed\ncompassion) in more intimate (e.g., dyadic) social settings (Benenson et al., 2002;\nSex differences in affect behavior\nLaFrance, Hecht, and Paluck, 2003; Leaper and Smith, 2004; Vingerhoets, Cornelius, Van\nHeck, and Becht, 2000). Collectively, these studies suggest that subtle detection and\nexpression of capacity and trustworthiness cues of reciprocity potential may be specialized\nand functional for facilitating the formation of strategic, fitness-enhancing relationships in\nhumans (Vigil, in press).\nEvolution of Sex Differences in Affect Behaviors\nFrom the perspective of the SRFB, phenotypic variation in the expression of\ncapacity and trustworthiness cues are predicted to covary with the fundamental dynamics of\nindividuals' social networks (Vigil, in press). These dynamics can be summed up as the\nquantity, quality, and expected extent (e.g., short-term vs. long-term) of interpersonal\ninvestment across one's relationships. Research in the social developmental literature\ndescribes similar distinctions in the prototypical social networks and relationship styles of\nmales and females. These studies show that girls and women spontaneously form, and\nreport a preference for fewer, but more intimate relationships with their same-sex peers.\nMales, in contrast, evidence the opposite pattern by usually forming and reporting a\npreference for larger, but less intimate social networks on average (Geary et al., 2003;\nOne model that has the potential to explain these sex differences in relationship\ndynamics is based on a human evolutionary history characterized by male-biased\nphilopatry and male-male coalitional competition. In this type of social system, males tend\nto remain in closer proximity to their male-kin--this allows them to form strong, kin-based\ncoalitions--while females tend to emigrate into the social networks of their husbands upon\nand Peterson, 1996). With this system, males would have been exposed to and reliant upon\nmore daily interactions with kin. In contrast, females would have been dependent upon\nmore daily interactions with non-kin or distantly related kin (de Waal, 1993; Geary, 2002;\nRelationships between non-kin operate differently than relationships among kin,\nbecause the former are based on reciprocal altruism (equal exchange of resources), whereas\nthe latter are based on inclusive fitness (equal sharing of genes; Hamilton, 1964; Trivers,\n1971). In the context of a SRFB, the necessity for females to solicit more committed and\nsecure relationships among non-kin may have co-evolved with the sensitivity to exaggerate\nthe display of submissive behaviors vis-\u00e0-vis explicit demonstrations of vulnerability (e.g.,\nexpressed sadness) and appeasement (e.g., expressed compassion). These behaviors may\ntherefore reflect an expressive bias for females to signal higher levels of the trustworthiness\ncomponent of reciprocity potential than males (Vigil, 2007, in press; see also Geary and\nnetworks in females may in turn enable greater allocation of intimate investment behaviors\n(requiring time and empathy) and thus trustworthiness cues into fewer, but more reliable\nInstead, as a result of more daily exposure to kin-related peers, there is predicted to\nbe an overall relaxation of the selection pressures for males to exaggerate the expression of\nvulnerability and intimacy behaviors within their relationships (Geary et al., 2003; Vigil,\n2007). In theory, this would have enabled men to form a greater number of total\nSex differences in affect behavior\nrelationships, and thus larger and more functional coalitions (Geary and Flinn, 2001, 2002).\nAt the same time, men may have evolved a sensitivity to rely more heavily on the\nbehavioral advertisement of dominance behaviors (e.g., aggression, denial of pain, flashy\nbody movements) and thus the capacity component of reciprocity potential (Vigil, 2007, in\npress). Capacity cues are more observable (visible from a distance and through limited\ninteractions) than trustworthiness cues, and may be more effective for maintaining larger,\nless intimate (e.g., time-investing), and less exclusive peer networks among males. From\nthis perspective, sex differences in the propensity express higher levels of dominance\ndisplays (e.g., impulsivity, risk-taking, inflated self-evaluations, and physical aggression) in\nmales and submissiveness displays (e.g., cautiousness, conscientiousness, modest self-\ndescriptions, and expressed sadness) in females may reflect asymmetries in the social\necologies and relationship demands in which humans evolved. More specifically, these\nbehaviors may reflect the associated sensitivity to interchange the capacity and\ntrustworthiness components of reciprocity potential within these social ecologies, among\nCurrent Study\nThe plausibility of the SRFB for understanding variation in sex-general and sex-\ntypical expressive behaviors rests on several testable assumptions. One assumption, for\nexample, is that males and females express distress through behaviors that project the\nperception of dominance and submissiveness, which may ultimately operate (in part) to\ncause peers to either distance from, or to comfort the individual, respectively. Expressed\nanger is associated with the perception of dominance, whereas fear and sadness are\nassociated with the perception of submissiveness (e.g., Marsh, Adams, and Kleck, 2005;\nMontepare and Dobish, 2003; Zuroff, Fournier, and Moskowitz, 2007; see also Mondillon\net al., 2005). Higher levels of physical aggression among males may signal the individual's\nstrength, prowess, and hence capacity to hurt others and to defend oneself. Anger facial\nexpressions are inversely associated with the likelihood of receiving sympathetic responses\nfrom others (Strayer and Roberts, 2004), which may further enhance the perception of\ncapacity (e.g., toughness) by causing peers to distance themselves from the individual and\nthus demonstrate the ability to defend oneself in times of stress. Instead, sadness behaviors\namong females may display high trustworthiness cues (e.g., via expressed vulnerability) in\norder to evoke reciprocal displays of trustworthiness (e.g., via expressed compassion) and\nhence investment into the relationship from peers. Trustworthiness interchanges may be\nespecially adaptive under conditions in which individuals experience decreased capacity\nresources (i.e., negative life events), when they are unable to effectively advertise these\nqualities to others, and when reliable social support is most essential. Another assumption\nof the framework is that prototypical male and female expressive styles (e.g., masculine\nand feminine distress behaviors) are used to communicate with same sex affiliates.\nAccording to this assumption, people should be better at inferring (understanding) the\nsocial desires of same-sex, rather than opposite-sex peers.\nIn the current study, I examine these assumptions through a series of self-report\nquestionnaires designed to assess 4 predictions. According to the first assumption above,\npeople should (a) be more likely to respond to dominant mood states (e.g., anger and\nfrustration) with aggressive behaviors and to respond to submissive moods (e.g., sadness,\nSex differences in affect behavior\nfear, worrying, embarrassment) with crying behaviors. These responses should differ by\nsex such that males and females should exaggerate reports of aggression and crying\nbehaviors, respectively. Likewise, people should (b) desire others to respond to one's\ndominant distress moods with distancing (avoidant) reactions and to respond to submissive\nmoods with comforting (affiliative) reactions. These desires should again differ by sex,\nsuch that males should desire more distancing reactions from others, whereas females\nshould desire more comforting reactions. In order to support the hypothesis that sex-typical\ndistress behaviors are effective for communicating the desire to evoke distancing and\ncomforting responses from peers, I also needed to demonstrate that people (c) believe their\npeers similarly desire to be left alone and comforted when feeling dominant and submissive\ndistress moods and expressing aggression and crying behaviors. These beliefs should differ\naccording to the sex of the respondent and sex of the peer. Female respondents are expected\nto believe that peers desire more comfort than believed of male respondents, and both sexes\nshould infer that female peers desire more comfort than male peers. Finally, to examine the\nsecond assumption, I hypothesized that (d) people are better at inferring the social desires\nof same-sex, rather than opposite-sex peers. I examine this hypothesis by directly\ncomparing the believed social desires of same-sex and opposite-sex peers (to receive\ncomfort vs. distancing when experiencing distress moods) and the reported desires of the\nmale and female participants, themselves.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Procedures\nTwo hundred participants (125 males) were recruited from the University of\nMissouri-Columbia (mean age for men = 19.1, SD = 0.9 years; mean age for women =\n18.9, SD = 1.3 years). In a 30 to 40 minute testing session, participants completed a series\nof questionnaires designed to measure \"stress behaviors\" in a classroom setting.\nMaterials\nThe questionnaires were designed specifically for this study, and consisted of 56\nitems across three broad sections. Items in the first section were designed to assess the\nassociation between common nonverbal distress behaviors (crying vs. physical aggression)\nand three dominant mood states (anger, frustration, and hot-temperedness) and five\nsubmissive moods (sadness, embarrassment, worry, fright, and stress). Participants were\ntold to think about their behaviors when they felt different emotions, and were given eight\nforced-choice items that asked \"when I am feeling (mood state), I am most likely to\n______\" (choices: \"start crying\" vs. \"hit, bang, or slam a nearby object\"). The second part\nof this section consisted of 10 items designed to measure desired social responses from\nother people when experiencing the eight mood states and nonverbal distress behaviors\n(crying and hitting). Participants were asked to imagine how they wish other people would\nrespond to their emotions, and were given eight forced-choice items that asked \"when I am\nfeeling (mood state), I wish people would ______\" (choices: \"leave me alone for awhile\"\nvs. \"come over and give me comfort\"). Two additional items asked participants how they\nwished others would respond when the participant is \"crying\" and when they are \"hitting,\nslamming, or banging objects\".\nThe second section was designed to assess how people respond to negative life-\nSex differences in affect behavior\nevents, the perceived impact of the events on individuals' life, and how they wish others\nwould react to them, under the conditions. Participants were asked to imagine experiencing\nsix negative life-events that consisted of 1) stepping in a mud puddle, 2) receiving an\nofficial letter from the Undergraduate Dean stating that the participant was accused of\ncheating on an exam and would be expelled from the University, 3) locking their keys\ninside their car or house, 4) receiving a phone call from the police saying that their parent\nhad been killed in a car accident, 5) receiving a failing grade on an important exam, and 6)\nstubbing their toe on a metal chair. For each of the six hypothetical events, participants\nwere asked three questions; the first question asked participants to report what their \"first\nreaction would most likely be\" (choices: \"start crying\" vs. \"hit, bang, or slam a nearby\nobject\"); the second question asked how much \"this event would impact my life\" (choices:\n\"not at all\", \"a little\", or \"very much\"); and the third question asked how they \"wish people\nwould respond\" to their reaction (choices: \"leave me alone for a while\" vs. \"coming over to\ngive me comfort\").\nThe third section was designed to assess knowledge of desired responses of same-\nsex vs. opposite-sex peers. In the first part of this section, participants were asked to \"think\nabout how you think a male friend might want you to respond to his emotions\".\nParticipants were then given eight questions that asked to \"imagine a close male friend is\nfeeling very (each of the eight emotions from Section 1), he probably wants me to ______\"\n(choices: \"leave him alone for awhile\" vs. \"go over and give him comfort\"). Two\nadditional questions asked how they think their male peers would want the participant to\nrespond if the peer was crying and hitting nearby objects. The entire set of 10 questions\nwas then repeated to refer to the social desires of female peers.\nResults\nPrediction (a) People respond to dominant moods with physical aggression and to\nsubmissive moods with crying behaviors, and these responses are exaggerated in males\nand females, respectively. Percentages of males and females that reported either crying or\nhitting behaviors in response to the 8 mood states (sadness, anger, frustration,\nembarrassment, worry, hot-temperedness, fright, and stress) are presented in the first set of\ncolumns of Table 2. Nonverbal responses across mood states were assessed by McNemar's\nchi square tests; for these comparisons, a conservative cutoff point ( = .002) was used to\ntest mood differences. As shown in Table 2, males reported the highest likelihood of hitting\nin response to dominant moods that included feelings of hot-temper, anger, and frustration.\nIn contrast, females reported the highest likelihood of crying in response to submissive\nmoods that included feelings of stress, fright, embarrassment, worry, and sadness. Chi\nsquare tests revealed sex differences in nonverbal responses for each of the mood-states (ps\n< .001), due to higher reports of crying behaviors in women and aggressive behaviors in\nmen. These findings indicate a male-bias to respond to dominant moods with aggressive\nbehaviors that are suggestive of capacity displays, and a female-bias to respond to\nsubmissive moods with sadness behaviors that are suggestive of trustworthiness displays\n(Vigil, in press).\nSex differences in affect behavior\nTable 2.

Frequencies of the responses of male and female participants are shown for crying and hitting behaviors (first set of columns), for desiring distance (D) or\ncomfort (C) responses from others (second set of columns), and for the believed desires of male and female peers (third and fourth sets of columns). Underlined\nvalues indicate significant differences (p < .05) between the responses of male and female participants. Different superscript letters indicate significant mood\ndifferences in crying/hitting and distancing/comforting responses ( = .002).\nSex differences in affect behavior\nPrediction (b) People desire others to react to one's dominant distress behaviors\nwith avoidant responses and to react to one's submissive distress behaviors with\ncomforting responses, and these desires are moderated by sex. Percentages of males and\nfemales that desired either distancing or comforting responses from others are shown in the\nsecond set of columns in Table 2. Examination of the social desires across mood states ( =\n.002) revealed that, collectively, males and females report the greatest desire for others to\navoid rather than comfort them when feeling hot-temper and anger, followed by frustration,\nstress and embarrassment, sadness, worry, and fright. Chi square tests revealed sex\ndifferences in desired responses for fright, worry, and crying behavior (ps < .05), due to\ngreater desires of females to receive more social comforting than males.\nIn order to further examine the hypothesis that males and females differentially\nprefer others to react to one's distress with avoidant and comforting responses,\nrespectively, I assessed distress behaviors and desired social responses to six negative life-\nevents (stepping in mud, expulsion from school, locked keys in car, parental death, failing\ngrade, and stubbed toe). Chi square tests, again, revealed a higher likelihood of males\nresponding to each negative life-experience with hitting than crying behaviors and females\nwith more crying than hitting behaviors (ps < .001), except for parental death (p = .17), of\nwhich both sexes reported a greater likelihood of crying to this event. These group\ndifferences emerged despite no sex differences in the perceived impact of the events on\nparticipant lives (ps > .29). Examination of desired social responses revealed sex\ndifferences for each event; males desired others to react with more avoidant than\ncomforting reactions and females desired others to provide more comforting than avoidant\nbehaviors (ps < .05), except for parental death (p = .13) and getting a failing grade (p =\n.30), of which both sexes reported a greater likelihood of desiring comfort and avoidance\n(respectively) to these events. Collectively, these findings indicate that people desire others\nto respond to self-expressed anger and hot-temper with avoidant reactions and respond to\nself-worry and especially fright with comforting reactions and that males and females\ndifferentially prefer avoidant and comforting social responses from others.\nPrediction (c) People believe their peers similarly desire others to respond to the\npeer's dominant and submissive distress behaviors with avoidant and comforting\nresponses, respectively, and these beliefs differ by sex of the respondent and sex of the peer.\nThe believed social desires (avoidance vs. comforting) of male and female peers are shown\nin the third and fourth set of columns in Table 2. Examination of believed social desires of\nmale peers for each of the mood states ( = .002) revealed that both male and females\nparticipants believed male peers desired to be distanced from when experiencing dominant\nmoods such as hot-temper and anger, and desired to be comforted when experiencing\nsubmissive moods such as fright and worry. Examination of the believed social desires of\nfemale peers again revealed that both male and female participants believed female peers\ndesired distance when experiencing dominant moods such as hot-temperedness, and desired\nto be comforted when experiencing submissive moods such as sadness, fright, and worry.\nChi square tests revealed differences in believed desires of male and female peers\namong male and female participants. Chi square tests revealed that more males than\nfemales believed that male peers desire comfort when experiencing embarrassment and\nhitting behaviors, and that female peers desire comfort when experiencing hot-\ntemperedness, stress, and hitting behavior. These tests also revealed that both male and\nSex differences in affect behavior\nfemale participants believed that female peers desired more social comforting than male\npeers when experiencing each of the 8 mood states and distress behaviors (ps < .05), except\nfor worrying among women (p = .06). These findings indicate that people believe their\npeers want others to respond to the peer's dominant moods with avoidant reactions, and to\nrespond to submissive moods with comforting reactions. Both sexes believe female peers\ndesired more comforting behavior than male peers; however, male participants were more\nlikely to infer that peers desire more comfort than female participants for some of the\nmoods and aggressive behavior.\nPrediction (d) Males and females are more accurate at inferring the social desires\nof same-sex, rather than opposite-sex peers. This hypothesis was examined by comparing\nparticipants' self-desired social responses (for others to avoid or provide comfort; second\nset of columns in Table 2) and participants' believed social desires of male and female\npeers (third and fourth set of columns of Table 2), separately by sex. Due to the possibility\nof carry-over effects in reporting self- and other-desired responses, McNemar's chi square\ntests were used to test significant (p < .05) differences. These tests revealed a same-sex\nadvantage at inferring the social desires of others among males, but not among females.\nSpecifically, male participants believed their male peers' social desires were similar to their\nown social desires for every mood state, crying, and hitting behavior (ps > .05). In contrast,\nmale participants believed female peers desired more comforting responses than the male\nparticipants, themselves, self-desired for every mood state, crying, and hitting behaviors (ps\nFor female participants a different pattern emerged, such that female participants\nbelieved their female peers' social desires were only similar to their own social desires for\nhot-temper (p = .09) and hitting behavior (p = .15). For the remainder of the mood states\n(except for fright) and for crying behavior, female participants self-desired less comforting\nresponses than they believed their female peers desired (ps < .001). Comparisons for fright\ncould not be computed due to the uniformity of belief that females' peers desired comfort\nwhen frightened. In contrast, female participants self-desired more similar responses to the\nbelieved desires of male peers for sadness, anger, frustration, worry, hot-temper, stress, and\ncrying behavior (ps > .17); and self-desired less distancing responses than believed of male\npeers for embarrassment, fright, and hitting behavior (ps < .05).\nFurther examination of the bivariate correlations between self-reported desires\n(coded 1 for social comfort and 2 for social distancing) and inferred social desires of same-\nsex peers confirmed a male advantage at within-sex inferences. Males evidenced significant\ncorrelations between self-reported desires and inferred desires of male peers for each of the\n8 mood states and crying behavior (rs ranged from .19 to .42, ps < .05). In contrast, female\nparticipants' only evidenced significant correlations between self-reported desires and\ninferred social desires of female peers for hot-temper (r = .37, p < .01), frustration (r = .30,\np < .05), and hitting behavior (r = .25, p < .05); for the remainder of the mood states and for\ncrying behavior, the correlations were non-significant (ps > .05).\nDiscussion\nAccording to the socio-relational perspective, sex differences in distress behaviors,\nsuch as higher levels of physical aggression in males and crying behaviors in females may\nreflect the selective advantage of advertising the capacity (via dominant behaviors) or\nSex differences in affect behavior\ntrustworthiness (via submissive behaviors) components of reciprocity potential across\nsame-sex relationships (Vigil, in press). I used this thesis to examine two broad\nassumptions of the framework. The first assumption is that males and females display\nhigher levels of aggressive and crying behaviors in order to cause peers to either distance\nthemselves from, or to comfort the individual, respectively. For males, receiving emotional\nsupport from others may reduce the perception of capacity attributes (e.g., toughness). This\nhypothesis is consistent with observational research showing that people are less likely to\nprovide comforting behaviors to, and are more likely to distance themselves from peers\nthey perceive as angry and aggressive (e.g., Strayer and Roberts, 2004; Xu and Zhang,\n2007). Males may thus express higher levels of aggression in part to cause peers to distance\nthemselves from the individual, and demonstrate the ability to protect oneself in times of\nstress. Some research suggests that males (particularly during adolescence and young\nadulthood) are attracted to male peers that are perceived as aggressive and dominant (e.g.,\nChang, 2004; Farmer et al., 2003).This research suggests that males may have evolved the\nsensitivity to express higher levels of aggressive behaviors in order to attract the affiliation\nof potential coalition members and avoid interactions with potentially dangerous\nadversaries. In contrast, females were predicted to exaggerate the expression of submissive\ndistress behaviors (i.e., crying) in order to attract the affiliation of others. Female peers may\nrespond to these displays with the reciprocation of intimate comforting responses and hence\ntrustworthiness displays of their own (Vigil, in press; see also Hagen, 2003). The second\nassumption I examined is that people are better at inferring the desired social responses of\nsame-sex, rather than opposite-sex peers. These sensitivities, should they exist, would\nsupport the hypothesis that nonverbal affect behaviors have evolved, primarily, to\ncommunicate with same-sex affiliates.\nThe results of the study are generally consistent with these hypotheses and showed\nthat both sexes were more likely to respond to dominant moods (e.g., anger, hot-temper,\nand frustration) with higher levels of aggression then they responded to submissive moods\n(e.g., sadness, fear, embarrassment, worry, and stress). Likewise, both sexes were more\nlikely to respond to submissive moods with higher levels of crying behaviors than they\nresponded to dominant moods. These behavioral proclivities were in turn moderated by\nsex; males were more likely to respond to mild and significant stressors and variant mood\nstates with aggression, and females were more likely to respond with crying behaviors.\nThese findings are consistent with cross-cultural studies showing that females cry an\naverage of 2\u00bd times more frequently than males (Becht and Vingerhoets, 2002), and report\ncrying in response to a greater variety of emotions and personal and interpersonal\nexperiences in general (e.g., Williams and Morris, 1996). Other research suggests that sex\ndifferences in behavioral reactivity may be rooted in distinct neuroendocrine (e.g.,\nsympathetic nervous system) mechanisms for moderating affect behaviors in males and\nfemales (e.g., see Vigil, Geary, Granger, and Flinn, in press). Indeed, the female\nparticipants in this study reported a greater likelihood of crying than hitting behaviors when\nfeeling each of the dominant and submissive moods, except for feelings of hot-\ntemperedness. Sadness behaviors result in increased social support provided by intimate\nconfidantes (Terwogt, 2002). Females may have therefore evolved a sensitivity to display\nhigher levels of these behaviors than males in order to consolidate the intimacy and\nreliability of their social networks. In contrast, males evidenced the reverse pattern by\nreporting a greater likelihood of producing aggressive behaviors (hitting) when feeling each\nSex differences in affect behavior\nof the dominant and submissive mood-states, except for feelings of sadness. Males may\nhave evolved a sensitivity to display higher levels of these behaviors in part to cause others\nto distance themselves from the male and thus enable him to demonstrate the ability to\nprotect himself in times of stress.\nThe findings are also consistent with the prediction that both sexes desire, and infer\npeers to desire, social avoidance when experiencing more dominant distress moods and\ninstead desire and infer peers to desire comforting responses when feeling more submissive\ndistress moods. These findings suggest that dominant and submissive distress behaviors\nmay be effective for causing others to either avoid or solicit affiliation with the individual.\nAccording to the SRFB, affective responses are manifested as expressive behaviors that\noperate in part to modify the formation and maintenance of different types of relationships.\nBy modifying the quantity and intimacy level of peer relationships, individuals may be able\nto optimize their social networks in ways that facilitate recovery from adverse experiences\n(Vigil, in press).\nThe findings also suggest that males and females desire different responses from\ntheir peers when experiencing various life stressors and discrete moods. Males reported a\ngreater desire for other people to respond to their distress with avoidant rather than\ncomforting responses, and especially when experiencing fear, worrying, and crying\nbehaviors. In contrast, females overwhelmingly desired comforting over distancing\nresponses from others to these types of submissive distress behaviors. Previous research\nsuggests that males are more likely to explicitly deny experiencing submissive emotions,\ncompared to females, and instead report a greater likelihood of experiencing dominant\nmoods such as contempt (e.g., Stapley and Haviland, 1989; Timmers, Fischer, and\nManstead, 1998). Other studies have shown that self-reported masculinity in males is\nassociated with acute anxiety over expressing displays of submissiveness (e.g., felt pain\nand sadness), but not dominance (e.g., anger; Gold, Fultz, Burke, Prisco, and Willet, 1992;\nJakupcak, Salters, Gratz, and Roemer, 2003; see also Updegraff, McHale, and Crouter,\n2000). By disregarding submissive emotions, males may increase the perception of\ndominance to peers. When men do experience these feelings, they appear to be motivated\nto distance themselves from others, conceal their vulnerability, and deny the comforting\nresponses of others. Likewise, both males and females believed that male peers desire more\nsocial distancing responses than female peers in general. This effect was quite robust, and\nsuggests that both sexes are intuitively aware of the distinct social desires described above.\nThese findings provide tentative support for the hypothesis that nonverbal distress\nbehaviors are both specialized (e.g., distinguished across males and females) and functional\n(e.g., for effectively communicating social desires), and hence phenotypically adaptive.\nOne finding that was not expected, however, was the pattern for female participants, rather\nthan male participants, to believe both male and female peers desired more social\ndistancing to some moods and distress behaviors. This finding is inconsistent with the\nhypothesis and previous results and are consequently paradoxical (see thoughts below).\nFinally, I predicted that males and females were more accurate at inferring or\nunderstanding the desired social responses of same-sex, rather than opposite-sex peers.\nResults were only partially consistent with this hypothesis, and showed that only men were\nbetter at predicting the social desires of same-sex peers for every mood and distress\nbehavior, compared to inferences among women. The similarity between men's self desires\nand the believed desires of male peers suggest that males are using their own motivational\nSex differences in affect behavior\ndrives as an anchor or model for their beliefs about other males. In contrast, males believed\nthat females desired more comforting responses than the males themselves desired across\nevery mood and distress behavior. These findings suggest that males are taking into\nconsideration the general tendency of females to usually desire comforting responses to\nsubmissive mood states.\nEqually interesting is the finding that the majority of females, with the exception of\nhot-temperedness and hitting behaviors, did not believe their female peers' desires were\nsimilar to their own. This pattern emerged due to greater beliefs that female peers desire\nmore comforting responses that the female participants, themselves, desired. Thus, whereas\nmales appeared to use their own desires to make inferences about other males, the females\nin this study did not. One possibility is that these findings reflect a broad expressive bias\nfor women to ubiquitously provide (or desire to provide) more comforting responses (e.g.,\nsympathy) to distressed peers, compared to males. However, if this is the case, then the\nsame bias should be shown toward males (i.e. females should believe that males also desire\ncomfort more than distance). This finding is not supported by the data (with exception of\n\"worry\" in which 91% of females believed males desire comfort). Another possibility is\nthat both males and females are sensitive to the types of submissive distress behaviors (e.g.,\nsadness facial expressions, reserved body language, crying) that females display more\novertly than males, and subsequently react with compassionate (comforting) responses.\nThe finding that males are better at inferring the desires of same-sex peers than are\nfemales and that male participants believe peers desire more comforting responses to some\nmoods than do females, runs contrary to previous research suggesting that females are more\nempathetic than males in general (Baron-Cohen and Wheelright, 2004; Davis, 1994; Geary,\nadvantage in empathetic awareness is strongest for studies that use self-report measures,\nmodest for observations of empathetic behaviors, and nonexistent for studies that rely on\nphysiological measures of affective arousal (Eisenberg and Lennon, 1983). Thus, it is\npossible that females may not be more understanding of, or physiologically reactive to, the\nvisceral distress and desires of other people than males, per se. Rather, females may simply\nbe biased to express (self-report) higher levels of altruistic dispositions, compared to males\nin general. Because the items in this study were designed to measure behavioral actions\n(i.e., comforting or distancing from peers) rather than subjective dispositions (e.g.,\nsympathy), it is likely that the current findings reflect this important distinction. Instead, the\ntendency for male participants to believe that female peers desire more social comfort than\nthe female participants themselves expressed may reflect an overcompensation for the\ndissonance between male's own desires (often to be distanced by peers) and the general\ndesires of women to be comforted. Another possibility is that the participants in this study\nwere influenced by their own interpersonal experiences or experiences that are unique to\neach sex (e.g., greater sexual victimization experiences and associated avoidant\ndispositions in women).\nUnfortunately, individual differences in past experiences and intentions were not\nmeasured in the current study. This was a significant limitation and may have altered\ncertain aspects of the current findings. It is certainly possible, for instance, that without\nreferences to specific contextual and interpersonal cues that guide social interactions, the\nparticipants may have chosen their responses (e.g., to provide comfort to female peers) by\ndefault. Still, the results of the study are interesting and provide a preliminary investigation\nSex differences in affect behavior\nof specific socio-relational functions or selective advantages of common nonverbal\nbehaviors. In particular, the results show that these functions may differ for males and\nfemales, and that humans may be equipped with specialized interpersonal behaviors for\ncommunicating and interacting with same-sex affiliates.\n"
