Yet work conditions are still poorer for\nhome care aides than for the other types of aides.\nImplications: Work conditions need further improvement,\nparticularly for home care aides. More accurate data to\ndescribe paraprofessional care workers are also neces-\nsary to address the serious worker shortage problems.\nKey Words: Hospital aides, Nursing home aides, Home\ncare aides, Paraprofessionals\nThe United States has been facing a serious short-\nage of direct care workers in long-term care settings in\nthe last few decades. Several factors, including the ag-\ning population and changes in health care systems,\nhave resulted in a dramatic increase in the demand for\ndirect care workers. The combination of persistent\nworker shortages, increasing demands, and record-\nlow unemployment rates has exacerbated the short-\nages of direct care workers in the late 1990s. A recent\nnationwide survey found that for 42 states recruit-\nment and retention of paraprofessional aide workers\nwas a major workforce issue in 1999 (North Carolina\nDivision of Facility Services, 1999). Another study,\ncomposed of 86 telephone interviews of a variety of\nlong-term care providers in New York state, found\nthat the direct care worker shortage has hit all set-\ntings, including 92% of nursing homes, 82% of home\nhealth agencies, and 70% of adult care facilities\n(New York Association of Homes and Services for the\nPrevious studies suggest that recruitment and re-\ntention of direct care workers are closely associated\nwith a number of factors, including workers' demo-\ngraphic characteristics, work conditions, organizational\nculture, and macroeconomic conditions (Banaszak-Holl\n& Hines, 1996; Friedman, Daub, Crisci, & Keyser,\nman, Carner, & Berkenstock, 1984). However, little\nis known about these workers, such as basic demo-\ngraphic characteristics and work conditions. Most\nexisting studies profiling the characteristics of para-\nprofessional care workers are limited to particular\nagencies or local areas with very limited generaliz-\nability (Crown, Ahlburg, & MacAdam, 1995). Since\nthose variables appear to affect recruitment and re-\ntention of the paraprofessional care workforce, accu-\nrate information gathering and reporting on key char-\nacteristics of these workers are essential to identify\nstrategies to address this growing labor shortage\nproblem.\nThe only studies with nationally representative\nsamples of direct care workers were undertaken by\nLeon and Franco (1998) and Crown and colleagues\n(1995). Leon and Franco developed a profile of agency-\nbased and self-employed home health care workers at\na national level. They conducted telephone interviews\nwith 623 home care workers identified by the respon-\ndents of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey\n(MCBS). Despite the seemingly sufficient sample size,\nLeon and Franco (1998) pointed out that the response\nrate was lower than preferred (1,368 MCBS clients\nThis research was substantially supported by the Center for Health\nWorkforce Studies at University at Albany. I wish to thank Dr. Paul Wing,\nMr. Edward Salsberg, Dr. Susan Sherman, and Dr. Philip McCallion for\ntheir encouragement and helpful comments.\nAddress correspondence to Yoshiko Yamada, MSW, Center for Health\nWorkforce Studies, University at Albany, One University Place, Rensselaer,\n1 Center for Health Workforce Studies, University at Albany, Rens-\nselaer, NY.\nwere originally contacted) due in part to concurrent\ngovernment investigations in the industry and the\nhigh turnover rate among home care workers. Hence,\ntheir estimates should be interpreted with caution.\nAnother study, conducted by Crown and col-\nleagues (1995), compared demographic characteris-\ntics and work conditions for three types of aides: hos-\npital aides, nursing home aides, and home care aides.\nThis study used data from the Current Population\nSurvey (CPS) March supplement. The CPS is a\nducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics (BLS; BLS, 1996). The sample is rep-\nresentative of national civilian noninstitutional popu-\nlations aged 15 and older. The March supplement is\nthe primary source of detailed information on in-\ncome, work experience, geographic mobility, educa-\ntional attainment, and poverty status (BLS, 2001).\nDespite difficulties in identifying different types of\naides, particularly home care aides, in the CPS data,\nCrown and colleagues' study provides comparisons\nof different types of aides.\nGiven the growing labor force problem, it seems\nopportune to examine more recent data and facilitate\ncomparisons with earlier studies. For these reasons\nthis study will replicate the approach taken by Crown\nand colleagues (1995). This study will also examine\nthe continued usefulness of the CPS to describe direct\ncare workers.\nMethods\nment. The present study used a similar approach\ndemographic characteristics and work conditions of\nmake the variables as consistent as possible with\nCrown and colleagues' study, I used the same defi-\nnitions to identify the three types of aides from the\nCPS data by using the cross tabulation of occupa-\ntional (OCC) and industry (IND) codes. Table 1\nsummarizes the definition of each aide group in the\npresent study.\nThe sample size for each type of aides is presented\nin Table 2. For the 1990s data, I used chi-squared for\ncategorical variables (e.g., marital status, educational\nattainment), and analysis of variance for quantita-\ntive variables (e.g., income, wages). Because the 1980s\ndata were available only in the aggregated form, I\nconducted no statistical tests to compare the signif-\nicance of differences in data for the two different\ntime periods.\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nTable 2 provides demographic characteristics of\nnursing home aides, home care aides, and hospital\naides. The age distributions of each occupation group\nshow that home care aides tended to be older than\nboth nursing home and hospital aides in both the late\ncare aides declined in the 10 year period. As for gen-\nder distribution, although the proportion of males in-\ncreased somewhat in the nursing home and home care\nindustries during the 1990s, the direct care workforce\nis still predominantly female. Hospital aides who\nwork as orderlies may be a possible explanation for\nthe higher proportion of males in hospital settings\nRacial distributions did not change dramatically\nin the last decade, and the 1990s data showed no sig-\nnificant differences in racial characteristics among\nthe occupations. However, the data showed that\nhome care aides were significantly less likely to be\nnative-born U.S. citizens than were nursing home\ndata also showed that nursing home aides were more\nlikely (52%) to have children younger than age 18\nthan were home care aides (40%) or hospital aides\nThere were consistent differences in educational at-\ntainment among the occupation groups in the two pe-\nriods studied. Despite overall improvement in educa-\ntional attainment in the last decade, home care aides\nstill have less education than other aides. Yet it should\nalso be noted that almost one third of nursing home\naides and home care aides now have at least some col-\nlege education, which seems contrary to the public\nperception of aides.\nTable 1.

Although the proportions of full-\ntime, full-year aides did not change for hospital and\nnursing home aides, home care aides were more likely\nhowever, home care aides were still less likely to work\nfull time and full year than nursing home aides (55%)\nand hospital aides (63%). Home care aides were also\nsomewhat more likely to work part time and part\nyear (16%) than nursing home aides (11%) and hos-\npital aides (8%). Whereas more than half of part-time\nhospital aides (54%) and nursing home aides (50%)\nsaid they wanted part-time jobs, only 42% of part-\ntime home care aides reported a preference for part-time\njobs. Similarly, part-time home care aides were more\nlikely (18%) than hospital aides (12%) and nursing\nhome aides (14%) to report that they could only find\npart-time jobs. Although the differences in reasons\nfor being part-time workers were not statistically sig-\nnificant (p  .286), one should not ignore the fact\nthat a significant minority of home care aides would\nhave preferred a full-time job but worked part time\ninvoluntarily.\nThe number of weeks worked per year and the\nweekly work hours for each occupation did not\nchange dramatically. In the late 1990s, home care\naides spent fewer weeks (41) at work than nursing\nhome aides (43) and hospital aides (46), reflecting the\nhigher proportion of part-year workers. Consistent\nshowed no statistically significant difference in the av-\nerage work hours per week. Data from the 1990s also\nshowed that home care aides were somewhat more\nlikely to have earnings from other work (23%) than\nwere nursing home aides (20%) and hospital aides\nNursing Home Aides Home Care Aides Hospital Aides\nCharacteristic\nAge, %*\nGender, %*\nRace, %***\nMarital status, %*\nEducation, %*\nWith children under age 18, %*\nCitizenship, %**\nplement; Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2001).\ngested, many home care aides seemed to hold more\nthan one job and work full-time hours but without\nthe benefits of full-time status.\nOne puzzling finding is that despite the increase in\nhome care aides who work full time and full year, the\naverage number of weeks worked per year and hours\nusually worked per week declined slightly in the de-\ncade studied. Although there is no definite explana-\ntion for this finding, one possibility is that home care\naides are more likely now than 10 years ago to have\none full-time full-year job instead of two part-time\njobs. Hence, the increasing proportion of full-time full-\nyear home care aides did not necessarily result in an\nincreasing number of weeks and hours worked. An-\nother possible explanation is the decline of work\nweeks and hours among part-time workers in the last\ndecade, which may have brought down the mean\nnumber of weeks and hours worked. Future research\nis needed to test these hypotheses.\nWages and Income\nTable 4 shows wages, earnings, and family income\nfor different types of aides.

The decline was particularly steep\namong hospital aides. Nonetheless, hospital aides\ncontinue to have the highest wages, annual earnings,\nand family incomes, followed by nursing home aides\nand home care aides. As Crown and colleagues\n(1995) pointed out, wage information in the CPS is\navailable only for a minority of the sample, which\ncould be problematic. (Only a 25% subsample of\nworkers reported their wages in the 1980s, compared\nthe reported CPS wage data are similar to data\nfrom the Occupational Employment Statistics, a\nlarger survey with wage data conducted by the BLS.\nThe 1990s data also presented a poverty ratio for\neach occupation.

Yet compared\nwith the other two occupations, home care aides are\nstill substantially less likely to receive health insur-\nance from their employers or unions, and are more\nlikely to receive health insurance through government\nprograms such as Medicaid and Medicare.\nTable 5 also shows that the nursing homes and hos-\npitals that provide health insurance to their employ-\nees are less likely now than they were 10 years ago to\npay all of the premium, while home care employers\nare more likely now than a decade ago to do so.\nNonetheless, it should also be noted that about 1 in\nevery 11 nursing home and home care employers who\nprovide health insurance do not pay any premium.\nConsidering the low income of nursing home and\nhome care aides, it is very likely that such benefits are\nout of reach for these aides without financial support\nfrom employers.\nAs for pension coverage, nursing homes and hospi-\ntals showed a slight increase in pension provision by\nemployers in the last 10 years, while the proportion\nstayed the same for home care providers.

Source: Crown and\nistics and work conditions over the last 10 years, the\npicture looks quite different for home care aides.\nCompared to the late 1980s, home care aides in the\nlate 1990s were younger, more educated, and more\nlikely to have children. Also, home care providers\nwere more likely to offer full-time/full-year jobs and\nhealth insurance for aides in the late 1990s than in the\nlate 1980s. Nevertheless, compared to nursing home\naides and hospital aides, home care aides are still less\nlikely to hold full-time jobs and receive benefits.\nHome care aides are also more likely than other aides\nto be poor and to hold more than one job. Moreover,\ndespite the real wage decline among hospital and\nnursing home aides and the slight wage increase\namong home care aides, data showed that hospital\naides still tend to have the best paying and benefited\njobs and home care aides have the least. Given the\ngrowing and continuing labor shortages for nursing\nhome aide and home care aide positions, these data\nconfirm the need to improve work conditions for\nlong-term care aide workers.\nWage and benefits are not the only factors contrib-\nuting to recruitment and retention of aide workers.\nAs mentioned before, studies have found a number\nof nonmonetary factors that are closely associated\nwith turnover rates of care aides. These studies do\nnot negate the potential to improve recruitment and\nretention of care aides through individual employers'\nefforts to address these issues. However, research\nalso shows that a significant proportion of care aides\nwho have left or who are considering leaving their\njobs reported money and benefits as reasons for job\nThere is also evidence that programs that provided\nadditional benefits, such as a career ladder with en-\nhanced status and wages, more affordable benefits,\nand guaranteed hours, improved retention of care\nMondoux, 1996; Moffatte, Stefanini, & Hardke-\nAddressing wages and benefits appears to be criti-\ncal. However, employers argue that they have very\nlimited control over wages and benefits because the\ngovernment is the major payer of nursing home and\ncare expenditures and 60% of nursing home expendi-\ntures were paid through public funds, mostly from\nMedicare and Medicaid (Health Care Financing Ad-\nministration, 2000). Hence, wages and benefits for\ncare aides are largely influenced by public health care\nreimbursement policies. Several states have passed\nlegislation to address the labor shortage in the long-\nproved or implemented some form of a wage pass\nthrough (WPT), which mandates that certain amounts\nor percentages of the increased reimbursement for\nMedicaid and/or state long-term care programs be\ngiven to care paraprofessionals as wages and/or ben-\nefits. By 2000, at least two additional states had\nstarted to implement WPT (North Carolina Division\nsuch a new initiative in most of the states that its im-\npact on recruitment and retention of care workers\ncannot yet be judged (North Carolina Division of Fa-\nThe data also suggest that a significant minority of\nhome care aides is not U.S. citizens. Some observers\nhave suggested that federal policy makers reconsider\ncurrent restrictions on immigration to increase the\nsupply of direct care workers (New York Association\nof Homes and Services for the Aging, 2000). This ap-\nproach may be particularly effective in addressing the\nshortage of home care aides, considering the higher\nproportion of noncitizen workers than for the other\ntwo types of aides. Although fewer limitations on im-\nmigration may solve the labor problems in the short\nterm, this strategy may not address the fundamental\nproblems identified in this study for direct care workers:\nlow pay and poor benefits. Because immigrants are\nmore likely to accept lower-paying jobs with poor\nbenefits, there is even a danger that the growth of\nnoncitizen care aides will lead to even lower wages\nand poorer benefits.\nLimitations of the Present Study and CPS\nData Set and Recommendations\nIn this study, paraprofessional care workers were\nidentified in the CPS March supplement based on oc-\ncupation and industry codes. Although CPS is one of\nthe few national data sets that provides valuable na-\ntionally representative data on various occupations,\nthere are several data limitations. Crown and col-\nleagues (1995) pointed out that because the CPS in-\ndustry and occupation codes were not sufficiently\nwell defined, some aides may have been excluded\nand people who are not aides may have been in-\ncluded. Although Crown and colleagues (1995) be-\nlieved that the misclassifications were small in num-\nber, closer examination in the present study found\npotential problems in both occupation and industry\ncodes in CPS related to the study of direct care\nworkers.\nFirst, CPS data set does not distinguish between oc-\ncupation codes for home health aides, who provide\nassistance with both activities of daily living and\ninstrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and per-\nsonal care aides, who mainly provide IADL assistance.\nAccording to the BLS's Occupational Employment\nStatistics (n.d.), personal care aides make much less\nmoney per hour (average $7.40) than home health\naides (average $8.08). Hence, the CPS data may be\nmissing this potentially significant distinction. An-\nother potential problem in CPS occupation codes is\nthe inclusion of orderlies in the same occupation\ngroup as nursing aides. The present study found a\nhigher proportion of males in hospital settings, which\nis perhaps a result of the inclusion of orderlies as care\nworkers. However, orderlies tend to have a different\nnature of work and different demographic character-\nistics. By mixing dissimilar groups of workers, the\nsurvey data may not provide precise pictures of each\noccupation.\nAs for the industry codes, the CPS data set\ncombines several long-term care settings with other\nindustries, which makes it harder to identify parapro-\nfessional care workers in relevant settings. For exam-\nple, identification of paraprofessional care workers in\nrelatively new residential settings for the elderly,\nsuch as assisted living facilities, is extremely diffi-\ncult in the current CPS industry coding system. The\nnumber of assisted living facilities has increased\ndramatically in the last decade, but the CPS data\nset does not provide a clear definition of what in-\ndustry category the aides in those facilities should\nbelong to (e.g., residential care, nursing and per-\nsonal care facilities). As assisted living facilities\ngenerally rely much less on government funding\n(e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) than other health and\nlong-term care providers, the employers may have\nmore freedom to improve the work conditions of\nstaff, including care aides.\nAnother problem with the CPS industry codes is\nthat home health care agencies, which are the major\nemployers of home care aides, are combined with\nseveral other industries in CPS industry codes (IND\n840). Despite the fact that most of the direct care\nworkers in the IND 840 belong to home care agen-\ncies (BLS, n.d.), the present study does not include\nhealth aides (OCC 446) and nursing aides (OCC\nunderrepresentation of agency-based home care\naides in the present study. Another limitation, more\nof the present study than the CPS data itself, is the\nlack of adequate definitions of home care aides. For\nthe purpose of data consistency in the two time pe-\nriods, the present study used the same occupation\nand industry codes as Crown and colleagues (1995)\nto define the three groups of aides. As Table 1 shows,\nalthough the CPS has separate industry codes for pri-\nvate-duty (IND 761) and agency-based (e.g., IND\nstudy made no distinctions. Leon and Franco (1998)\nfound that agency-based and self-employed home\ncare workers showed differences in some demo-\ngraphic characteristics and working conditions.\nHence, distinctions between agency-based and self-\nemployed home care workers may be critical to un-\nderstanding home care workers in different settings.\nIn short, the present study has two limitations in\ndefining home care aides: not including workers who\nare employed by home care agencies, and not distin-\nguishing between agency-based and self-employed\nworkers. In order to make the best use of the existing\ndata set, it is recommended that future analyses of\nhome care aides using CPS include aide workers in\nIND 840 (health services, not elsewhere classified)\nand separate IND 761 (private home) from other\nhome care industries.\nResearch on direct care workers will be greatly fa-\ncilitated if care workers are properly distinguished\nfrom other occupations and industries. Therefore,\naccurate occupation and industry classification is\ncritical. The workforce crisis in health and long-term\ncare should encourage efforts to make more accurate\nclassifications.\nConclusion\nThis study examined the characteristics and work\nconditions of different types of care aides in the late\n1990s and compared this data to similar data from\nthe late 1980s. Some work-related improvements were\nnoted but too many care aides are still at or below\npoverty level with limited benefits. This is particularly\ntrue for home care aides and, to a lesser degree, for\nnursing home aides. Existing national data sets, al-\nthough useful, were found to be at risk of missing key\ngroups of workers; this should be considered in\nplanned revisions of occupation and industry codes.\nAs worker shortages continue and demand for care\nservices increases, a number of efforts have been made\nat organizational, local, state, and national levels to\nimprove recruitment and retention of care staff. Yet\nwithout accurate data on current conditions, such ef-\nforts may be targeted at the wrong concerns and\nissues and may fail to bring the desired results. Con-\ntinued attention to systematic data collection about\ncare workers at various levels (e.g., demographic\ncharacteristics, work conditions, and issues workers\nface) seems essential to secure the quantity and\nquality of care.\nReferences\nBanaszak-Holl, J., & Hines, M.
