All-cause mortality (n = 2850) was recorded from the\nNHANES III linked mortality file.\nResults: Lower PIR was associated with mortality after adjustment for lifestyle, clinical risk factors, and SRH in all\nracial-ethnic groups (P-trend <0.005). In contrast, after adjusting for lifestyle and clinical risk factors, lower\neducation was not associated with all-cause mortality in non-Hispanic whites (P-trend = 0.16), whereas the\nassociation remained significant after adjustment for SRH and lifestyle and clinical risk factors in other race-\nethnicities (P-trend = 0.005; P-interaction between education categories and race-ethnicity was 0.02).\nConclusions: Our results suggest that lower PIR was associated with mortality in all racial-ethnic groups. In\ncontrast, lower education was significantly associated with mortality only in racial-ethnic groups other than non-\nHispanic whites. Our results indicate that, beyond lifestyle and clinical risk factors, adjusting for SRH resulted in only\na modest change in the association of SES and mortality.\n",

Major socioeconomic variables\ninclude income, education, occupation, and insurance status,\nall of which may dictate differential access and control of\nmaterial and social resources in a society. Of particular interest\nis the manner in which other global inequalities, such as ethnic\nand sex inequalities, interact with socioeconomic inequalities\nto modify associations with health. Although ethnic and sex\ndisparities in health have been observed and extensively\nstudied,1\u00ad5 a side-by-side comparison of race-ethnicity, sex,\nand socioeconomic disparities would likely better illuminate\nthe particular effects on specific segments of a population,\nwhich is crucial for targeted public health decision-making.\nAn understanding of the pathways and mechanisms through\nwhich health is affected is of value to public health. To\ndate, research suggests that individual health behaviors (eg,\nsmoking) and clinically diagnosed health status (eg, high\nblood pressure)6 are variables that might partially explain the\nobserved social gradient in health, as these variables also\ndemonstrate a similar socioeconomic gradient.7\u00ad9 However, it\nis possible that subjective factors such as psychosocial and\nemotional components of health are also determinants of the\nGlobal self-rating of health has been widely advanced as\na reliable predictor of mortality in several studies.12,13 As\nopposed to conventional objective assessments, self-rated\nhealth (SRH) considers a more holistic approach to health\nassessment by accounting for physical, social, and emotional\ninfluences on health.12\u00ad15 Socioeconomic differentials have\nbeen established in SRH16\u00ad18: self-rated health in lower\nsocioeconomic groups is generally worse than that in higher\nsocioeconomic groups, and several studies have also\ndemonstrated SRH variations across sex and ethnicities.12,13\nHowever, little research has evaluated the role of SRH in\nexplaining socioeconomic differentials in mortality. A study\nconducted in the EPIC-Norfolk cohort concluded that SRH\nAddress for correspondence. Dr. Anoop Shankar, Department of Medicine, West Virginia University School of Medicine, P.O.

It has been suggested that income may be a better\nsocioeconomic status (SES) variable of health than occupation\nstatus.20 Furthermore, no studies have examined this relation\nin US cohorts. In this context, we examined the association\nbetween SES and all-cause mortality after adjustment for\nSRH, in addition to behavioral and clinical factors, in a\nlarge, nationally representative sample of US adults. We also\nperformed stratified analyses by race-ethnicity to examine if\nthere are racial differences in the observed associations.\nMETHODS\nStudy participants\nThe third National Health and Nutrition Examination survey\n(NHANES III) collected data on a nationwide probability\nsample of the civilian noninstitutionalized US population.\nStandardized questionnaires were administered at home,\nfollowed by detailed physical examinations at a mobile\nexamination center. Detailed descriptions of the complex\nsurvey design, interviewing procedures, and physical\nexaminations conducted have been published before and are\navailable online.21 In brief, NHANES III uses a stratified\nmultistage probability sample of households, with over-\nsampling of Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks to\nensure adequate sample size for analysis. The study protocol\nwas approved by the institutional review board of the National\nCenter for Health Statistics of the US Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.\nparticipated in the interview and examination components of\nNHANES III, mortality assessment data were available for\n18 800 participants. We excluded those with missing data on\npoverty-income ratio (PIR, n = 1978), education status (n =\n96), and certain other variables included in the multivariable\nOutcome of interest\nThe main outcome of interest was all-cause mortality.\nMortality was recorded from the NHANES III linked\nmortality file provided by the National Center for Health\nStatistics (NCHS).22 Mortality assessments were conducted\nDecember 2006. Mortality ascertainment was based on a\nprobabilistic match between NHANES III and National Death\nIndex death certificate records.\nMeasurement of exposure\nPIR and educational status were chosen as measures of SES.\nPIR was computed as the ratio of the midpoint of the observed\nfamily income category to the family's appropriate poverty\nthreshold set by the US Census Bureau in a given calendar\nyear. PIR is one of the best available indicators of SES and is\nwidely used as an indicator of SES in many studies using the\nNHANES data.23,24 PIR is a more sensitive SES measure than\nincome because it allows income data to be compared across\nNHANES survey years as the income thresholds are adjusted\nfor inflation. A PIR of 1 indicates the official federal poverty\nthreshold. According to the 2009 Federal Poverty Guidelines,\nthis corresponds to an individual earning $10 830 per year, a\nas poor, 1 to 1.9 as near poor, 2 to 3.9 as middle income, and\n4 or higher as higher income. Educational status based on\ncompleted years of education was ascertained from the\nfollowing questions, \"What is the highest grade/year of\nregular school you have ever attended?\" and \"Did you finish\nthat grade/year?\", with the response categorized as less than\nhigh school graduate (<12 years), high school graduate (12\nyears), and more than high school graduate (>12 years,\nincluding college degree). We also assessed insurance status, a\nstrong correlate of income,26 as an alternative SES indicator.\nParticipants were considered to have insurance coverage if\nthey answered affirmatively to the question, \"During the last\nmonth were you covered by one or more health insurance\nplans obtained privately or through an employer or union?\"\nMeasurement of covariates\nAge, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, alcohol intake,\nself-reported history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary\nheart disease, stroke, cancer (excluding skin cancer), and\nintake of oral hypoglycemic drug or insulin administration\nor antihypertensive medication were assessed using a\nstandardized questionnaire at home interview. Individuals\nwho had smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes during their\nlifetime were considered never smokers, those who had\nsmoked 100 or more cigarettes during their lifetime but did\nnot currently smoke were considered former smokers, and\nthose who had smoked 100 or more cigarettes during their\nlifetime and currently smoked were considered current\nsmokers. Current alcohol drinking was defined as con-\nsumption of 1 or more alcoholic drink in the past month.\nof wine, or 30 mL of hard liquor. SRH was assessed with the\nquestion, \"Would you say your health in general is excellent,\nvery good, good, fair or poor?\" with the responses collapsed\ninto 3 categories: excellent/very good, good, fair/poor.\nInformation on anthropometric, physical, and laboratory\nmeasurements was obtained during the mobile examination\ncenter (MEC) examination.27 Blood pressure (BP) was\nmeasured using a mercury sphygmomanometer, and the\naverage of 3 measurements was used as the systolic\nand diastolic BP values. Patients were considered to have\nhypertension if they reported taking antihypertensive\nSES and Mortality\nmedication, had a systolic BP of 140 mm Hg or higher, or a\ndiastolic BP of 90 mm Hg or higher. Body mass index (BMI)\nwas calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of\nthe height in meters. Diabetes was defined as a serum glucose\nlevel of 126 mg/dL or higher after fasting for a minimum of 8\nhours, a serum glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher after\nfasting less than 8 hours before their NHANES visit, self-\nreported physician-diagnosed diabetes, or current use of oral\nhypoglycemic medication or insulin. Serum total and high-\ndensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were measured\nenzymatically. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined\nas self-reported history of coronary heart disease, myocardial\ninfarction, angina, or stroke. Participants were considered\nphysically active if they walked a mile or more without\nstopping at least 20 times in the past month.\nStatistical analysis\nIn the current analysis, PIR values were categorized into\nquartiles. We compared selected characteristics of the\nparticipants by quartiles of PIR using the chi-square test or\nanalysis of variance, as appropriate. We examined the\nassociation between PIR and all-cause mortality using\nlogistic regression models. We calculated the odds ratio\n(OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of all-cause mortality\nassociated with PIR quartiles using the highest quartile\n(quartile 4) as the referent in 3 nested models: (1) age-\n(years) and sex-adjusted model, (2) multivariable-adjusted\nmodel 1 additionally adjusted for race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic\nwhites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, others),\nsmoking (never, former, current), alcohol intake (absent,\npresent), hypertension (absent, present), diabetes (absent,\npresent), cancer (absent, present), CVD (absent, present),\nmean arterial BP (mm Hg), BMI (kg/m2), HDL cholesterol\n(mg/dL), and physical activity (absent, present), and (3)\nmultivariable-adjusted model 2 adjusted for all variables in\nmultivariable model 1 plus SRH (excellent/very good, good,\nfair/poor). We then examined the association between\neducation and all-cause mortality using \"more than high\nschool graduate\" as the reference category, using similar\nmultivariable models. In subgroup analyses, we examined the\nassociation between the 2 SES indicators (PIR and education)\nand all-cause mortality stratified by sex and race-ethnicity. To\nexamine the dose-response association between SES and all-\ncause mortality, we carried out statistical tests for linear trend\nby modeling each SES indicator category as an ordinal\nvariable separately in the corresponding multivariable model.\nInteractions between SES measures (PIR and education) and\nsex and race-ethnicity were formally evaluated by including\ncross-product interaction terms in the corresponding multi-\nvariable models. In a supplementary analysis, we examined\nthe association between SES and all-cause mortality using\ninsurance status as an alternative SES indicator in the same\nmultivariable models. Sample weights that accounted for\nthe unequal probabilities of selection, oversampling, and\nnonresponse were applied to all analyses, using SUDAAN\n(version 8.0; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle\nPark, NC, USA) and SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute,\nCary, NC, USA) software; standard errors (SEs) were\nestimated using the Taylor series linearization method.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the characteristics of the study population\nby quartiles of PIR. Adults in the lowest PIR quartile: were\nmore likely to be younger, female, less than high school-\neducated, and current smokers; had higher BMI and HDL\ncholesterol; had higher prevalences of diabetes, hypertension,\nand poor SRH; and were less likely to be non-Hispanic\nwhites, physically active, and have insurance coverage.\nTable 2 shows the characteristics of the study population by\neducational categories. Adults with less than a high school\neducation: were more likely to be older and current smokers;\nhad higher BMI, systolic BP, and HDL cholesterol; had higher\nprevalences of diabetes, hypertension, CVD, cancer, and poor\nSRH; and were less likely to be non-Hispanic whites, current\ndrinkers, physically active, and have insurance coverage.\nThe association between PIR and all-cause mortality is\nshown in Table 3. The crude mortality rate was highest among\nthose in the lowest PIR quartile and lowest among those in the\nhighest PIR quartile. In logistic regression models, lower PIR\nquartiles were associated with mortality in both the age-\nand sex-adjusted model and multivariable model 1 (which\nadditionally adjusted for lifestyle and clinical risk factors).\nAlthough additional adjustment for SRH in multivariable\nmodel 2 attenuated this association, it remained significant.\nWhen stratified by race-ethnicity, the association between\nPIR quartiles and mortality was consistently present in\nall categories of race-ethnicity (P-interaction between PIR\nquartiles \u00d7 race-ethnicity = 0.3 in multivariable model 2). The\nassociation between education and all-cause mortality is\nshown in Table 4. Similar to PIR, the crude mortality rate\nwas highest among those with less than a high school\neducation and lowest among those with more than a high\nschool education. In logistic regression models, decreasing\ncategories of education were associated with mortality in both\nthe age-and sex-adjusted model and multivariate model 1.\nHowever, in contrast to the findings for PIR, additional\nadjustment for SRH in multivariable model 2 considerably\nattenuated the OR for low education, and the association\nbecame nonsignificant. When stratified by race-ethnicity,\neducation was not associated with mortality among non-\nHispanic whites after adjustment for lifestyle and clinical risk\nfactors, whereas the association remained significant after\nadjustment for lifestyle and clinical risk factors and SRH\nin other race-ethnicities (P-interaction between education\ncategories \u00d7 race-ethnicity = 0.02 in multivariable model 2).\nThe association between SES indicators (PIR and\neducation) and all-cause mortality stratified by sex and race-\nTable 2.

This association between lower PIR and mortality was\nsignificant in all racial-ethnic groups. In contrast, an initial\nassociation between lower education and mortality that was\npresent after adjustment for demographic factors was not\nstatistically significant after adjusting for lifestyle and clinical\nrisk factors in non-Hispanic whites; however, it remained\nsignificant in other race-ethnicities even after multivariate\nadjustment.\nWith regards to the income-mortality association, our\nresults are consistent with past studies that identified an\nindependent dose-response relationship between lower\nincome and all-cause mortality.7,28\u00ad33 Our study contributes\nto the existing literature by showing that income is associated\nwith mortality even after adjusting for SRH and lifestyle\nand clinical factors, suggesting a relatively independent\nrole. This is similar to the findings from the EPIC-Norfolk\nstudy, which showed that occupation has a modest residual\neffect on mortality even after adjusting for SRH.19\nConcerning the education-mortality association, past\nresearch has mostly been inconclusive regarding the\nassociation between lower education and mortality, with\nmore studies reporting an independent association34\u00ad37 than\nnot.7 Our result that adjusting for SRH and lifestyle and\nclinical risk factors in the multivariable model mostly\nexplained the education-mortality association in non-\nHispanic whites, but not in other racial-ethnic groups, is a\nnew addition to the literature.\nIn contrast to the education-mortality association, which we\nfound to be mostly explained by SRH and lifestyle and\nclinical risk factors, the residual association with mortality for\nincome indicates the influence of factors that may not easily\nbe conceived by individuals responding to the question on\nSRH. These may include contextual factors38 or political,\neconomic, cultural, or historic factors39 that may shape an\nindividual's exposure and access to public infrastructure and\nhealth care, which are not captured in SRH. Therefore, there is\na need for more research in this field to elucidate the role of\nTable 5.

In contrast, among other\nrace-ethnicities, an educational gradient was still apparent\nafter adjusting for SRH and clinical and lifestyle factors. It is\npossible that increased awareness of the role of lifestyle and\nclinical risk factors in health among non-Hispanic whites\nresulted in the narrowing of educational differences in\nmortality in this population.40 In minority ethnicities, it may\nbe that education's role in health is greater than that perceived\nand influenced by the individual. In this sense, the residual\neffects of education in minority ethnicities after adjustment\nfor SRH may be an indicator of differential availability\nof educational resources across ethnicities in the society. A\ncorollary observation is that health inequalities, including the\neducation-mortality differences that we observed, are still\nheavily influenced by racial/ethnic differences in the United\nStates. Therefore, it is vital to formulate active federal and\nstate policies that expand health and educational services and\nopportunities across all race-ethnicities, along with improving\nattitudes and promoting lifestyle changes.\nThe association between lower PIR and mortality was\nsignificant in both non-Hispanic white men and those of\nother race-ethnic groups, but not in women. It is possible\nthat men with low income may be exposed to more\nwork-related deaths or indulge in unhealthy lifestyle,\nincluding excessive alcohol,40 or cigarette smoking.41 Our\nresults are consistent with a previous systematic review of\nobservational cohort studies from developed countries, which\nfound that socioeconomic inequalities in mortality were more\npronounced in men than in women, using absolute measures\nof inequality.42 However, it is also understood that sex\ndifferences in the SES-health association may depend on the\nSES measure employed in a study and its characteristics\n(eg, relative or absolute SES terms) and that the association\nis also highly context-oriented, largely due to differences\nin cultural or societal characteristics among countries and\npopulations (eg, by age groups).\nWe found that lack of health insurance coverage--an\nindicator of access to care--was associated with mortality,\nindependent of SRH or demographic, clinical, or lifestyle risk\nfactors. Two thirds of uninsured persons in the United States\nare from low-income households that are unable to afford\neither healthcare insurance or out-of-pocket healthcare costs.43\nStudies have shown that lack of health insurance is associated\nwith increased risk of mortality due to difficulty in accessing\nhealthcare services and poor quality of healthcare in both\npreventive services and management of chronic diseases.44,45\nAn important contribution of our study is the fact that\nwe had adequate sample size and ethnicity-specific data,\nwhich permitted detailed stratified analyses by race-ethnicity.\nWe found that even after adjusting for SRH and demographic,\nlifestyle, and clinical risk factors, PIR was significantly\nassociated with mortality in non-Hispanic whites as\nwell as other race-ethnicities. In contrast, education was\nindependently associated with mortality in other race-\nethnicities only. In non-Hispanic whites, the association\nbetween education and mortality that was initially evident\nafter adjusting for age and sex was substantially attenuated\nand lost statistical significance after additional adjustment\nfor lifestyle and clinical risk factors. After additional\nadjustment for SRH, the magnitude of the association was\nfurther weakened. Our results are thus consistent with the\nhypothesis that various SES variables may interact differently\nwith race-ethnicity in complex ways to cause health effects\nand higher mortality. For example, our results suggest that\nlower education is independently related to mortality in\nracial-ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic whites; whereas,\nlow PIR was related to mortality in both non-Hispanic whites\nand other race-ethnicities. A corollary observation is that as\na public health intervention strategy, improving education\nmay be more beneficial in other race-ethnicities than in non-\nHispanic whites, whereas improving income may be equally\nbeneficial in both groups.\nThere are several limitations in our study. Firstly, lower\nsocioeconomic status has been significantly associated with\nhigher morbidity for chronic diseases such as diabetes,46\nhypertension,6 cardiovascular diseases,47 and end-stage renal\ndiseases,48 all of which can increase mortality. Our adjustment\nof these variables may have been inadequate, and residual\nconfounding from these factors may lead to overestimation of\nthe effect of socioeconomic variables on mortality. Secondly,\nascertainment of SES, clinical conditions, health behavioral\naspects, and SRH was performed only once, at the time of\nNHANES III. Due to variability in these factors over time, our\nresults may be biased due to time-varying confounding by\nthese factors. Finally, we excluded occupation as measure of\nSES in our analysis, as it was imprecise among women and\nretirees in the sample. However, we believe that exclusion of\noccupation status from the analyses is unlikely to have biased\nthe study findings, as it was previously established that\nincome might be a better SES indicator of health, given that\nemployment status is a subset of income.20 The availability of\na large and nationally representative sample, along with rich\ncovariate information, is a major strength of our study.\nIn conclusion, we found that lower PIR was associated with\nmortality in all racial-ethnic groups, independent of SRH\nor demographic, lifestyle, or clinical risk factors. In contrast,\nlower education was not significantly associated with\nmortality in non-Hispanic whites, although the association\nremained significant in other race-ethnicities. While our\nresults suggest that adjusting for SRH resulted in only a\nmodest change in the SES-mortality association beyond\nlifestyle and clinical risk factors, our findings also highlight\nthe significance of racial-ethnic variations in socioeconomic\ndisparities in health in relation to education.\n"
