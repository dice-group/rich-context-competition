    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis study explores the experiences of aging among gay men to further explain the phenomenon of gay male aging in\ncontemporary terms, to put those experiences into a historically relevant context, and to expand upon previous findings\non aging within the gay male population. Nineteen self-identifying gay men from a metropolitan area in South Florida were\ninterviewed. The data collected were analyzed using grounded theory method. Findings from the study indicated that a great\ndeal of optimism was revealed by the participants of the study in spite of their past adversarial experiences related to their\nsexuality and current challenges related to gay male sexuality and aging. Based on these findings, professionals working with\nan older population should consider the supportive environments that can most benefit this population in the community\nand even consider partnering with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) oriented organizations to better serve the\nneeds of their clients.\n",

Reports have\nshown that little is known about the health care needs of\nolder gay men and lesbians (Anetzberger, Ishler, Mostade, &\nand lesbians are an understudied population worthy of fur-\nther attention (Fredriksen-Goldsen & Muraco, 2010; Institute\nof Medicine, 2011). Understanding the scope of gay men's\naging is further complicated by the U.S. Census Bureau\nNational Population Estimates (2010) not providing statistics\nestimating the number of gay men living in the United States.\nThe \"Healthy People 2020\" (U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services, 2011) report addresses the health dis-\nparities of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT)\nindividuals linked to societal stigma, discrimination, and\ndenial of many civil and basic human rights. The report also\nstates that discrimination against LGBT persons has been\nassociated with high rates of psychiatric disorders, substance\nabuse, and suicide. The minority stress model (Brooks, 1981)\nundergirds the premise that gay men may find aging particu-\nhave less social support, while experiencing stigmatization\nand internalized homophobia. Older gay men have also wit-\nnessed the devastating effects of the AIDS epidemic, either\nas long-term survivors of the disease themselves or experi-\nencing the loss of life partners, close friends, and others\nwithin their community to the illness. While older gay men\nshare with their heterosexual counterparts common concerns\nrelated to aging, declining health, and the need for future\ncare, there is evidence to suggest that they have unique chal-\nlenges related to self-perception, provider relationships,\nsociocultural support systems, and medical\u00adlegal bureau-\n2006). The purpose of this study was to explore the experi-\nences of aging among gay men to further explain the phe-\nnomenon of gay male aging in contemporary terms, to put\nthose experiences into a historically relevant context, and to\nexpand upon previous findings on aging within the gay male\npopulation. Historical context is of particular relevance here\nas it may influence how study participants may perceive their\nexperiences of being gay and aging. At the time of the collec-\ntion of data for this study, Don't Ask, Don't Tell military\npolicy had been repealed, employer-based same-sex benefits\namong private as well as governmental entities continued to\nexpand, and same-sex marriage was legal in six states includ-\ning Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, Maine,\nNew Hampshire, as well as the District of Columbia.\nLiterature Review\nAs an area of scholarly inquiry, the phenomenon of gay aging\nis relatively new (Fredriksen-Goldsen & Muraco, 2010;\nMuraco & Fredriksen-Goldsen, 2006).

Prior to the 1970s, the stigma related to homo-\nsexuality was so great, and with the origins of homosexuality\nstill classified as a psychiatric disorder and illegal in many\njurisdictions, many social scientists were reluctant to pursue\nresearch for fear of being themselves identified as homosex-\nual or having ties to homosexuality. Needless to say, chang-\ning demographics, public policy, and societal attitudes\ncontinue to alter the current perception of the aging experi-\nences of gay men. From a legal perspective, sodomy laws\nwere only invalidated as recently as 2003 by the U.S.\nSupreme Court decision of Lawrence v. Texas (2003).\nAlthough progress has been made in social policy, legal\nbureaucracy, and public sentiment, particularly as it relates to\nchanging attitudes toward marriage equality, older individu-\nals who identify as gay continue to be a population that often\nis stigmatized for both their increasing age and their sexual\norientation (Brotman et al., 2007; Brown, Alley, Sarosy,\nAs previously documented in a comprehensive review\n(Fenkl, 2012), five domains have been identified (Fredriksen-\nGoldsen & Muraco, 2010) for organizing the literature on\ngay aging: (a) psychosocial adjustment to aging, (b) identity\ndevelopment, (c) social support, (d) health, and (e) aging-\nrelated community needs and services. Regarding psychoso-\ncial adjustment to aging, Price (2005) noted that the sexuality\nof older people, and gays and lesbians in particular, has been\nlargely overlooked resulting in the particular experiences,\nneeds, and concerns of older gay adults being unrecognized\nfrom policy, practice, and research perspectives. Other\nauthors have argued that the contemporary image of gay men\nmay favor younger adults (Acquaviva, de Vries, & Quam,\ncommon observation of the gay community as explicitly\nyouth oriented, hypothetical predictions of inferior psycho-\nsocial adjustment to aging among gay men have been largely\nunfounded. In fact, significant findings over the course of\nmultiple studies have revealed encouraging conclusions.\nWhile the earlier findings of both Bennett and Thompson\ngay men were disengaged from the social aspects of the gay\ncommunity and experienced especially negative mental\nhealth consequences of aging (Bennett & Thompson, 1980;\nBerger, 1984), other research studies have consistently dem-\nonstrated that gay men might even fare better than their het-\nerosexual counterparts with regard to being prepared to\naccept the realities of aging (Brown et al., 2001; Butler,\nhaving successfully overcome adversity in younger years. It\nis also equally important to acknowledge that the positive\nattitudes toward aging and the lessening of mental health\nissues among older gay men can likely be attributed to the\nincreasing acceptance of LGBT persons and the greater self-\nacceptance among gay men as a result of coming out.\nIdentity development was the focus of studies conducted\non Erikson's (1959) developmental stages as a theoretical\nframework, these authors suggested that the traditional sched-\nules of developmental issues addressed across the life span\nfor heterosexuals may not realistically apply to gay men.\nSpeaking to the differences that may prevail between gay\nmen and their heterosexual counterparts as well as between\nand among gay men, the authors found that recognizing that\nolder gay men may not be at the traditional developmental\nstage as their heterosexual age peers was as important as rec-\nognizing that older men who have lived openly gay lives may\nbe at a different developmental stage from their gay male\ncounterparts who have lived most of their lives closeted.\nThese findings were further underscored by Lee (2004), who\nsuggested that Karp's (1988) framework used for the exami-\nnation of identity development in the aging process was het-\nerosexist and not applicable to gay men.\nThe significance of a social support network for aging\npopulations is readily familiar to professionals working\nacross the spectrum of health care. However, it has been sug-\ngested that social support is of particular importance to popu-\nlations that have been marginalized or who might otherwise\nperceive an isolated existence due to a lack of familial ties or\nsupport (Beeler, Rawls, Herdt, & Cohler, 1999; Christian &\n(2004) suggested that previous research has shown that the\nneeds of older gay men are no different than those of their\nheterosexual counterparts. Other research studies point to the\nAIDS epidemic as a contributing factor in the further isola-\ntion of many gay men. This isolation ultimately resulted in\nthe provision of care and social support to friends and part-\nners becoming a major focus of the gay community\nPerhaps as a result of the AIDS epidemic, matters of\nhealth appear to play a significant role among the aging gay\nmale population. In a critical review of the medical literature\nrelated to the older HIV-positive adult, Martin, Fain, and\ninfections were occurring in adults over the age of 50 years.\nRobinson, Petty, Patton, and Kang (2008) argued that aging\nwith HIV can be confusing and may include times of grief,\ndespondency, and loneliness. Advances in antiretroviral ther-\napy are increasing survival and longevity for people living\nwith HIV. Vance, Moneyham, Fordham, and Struzick (2008)\nasserted that depression and suicidal ideation represent sig-\nnificant problems for many older adults living with HIV who\nalso may be particularly vulnerable to the influences of age-\nism and stigma, loneliness and decreased social support,\nneurological changes, declining health, fatigue, changes in\nappearance, and financial distress.\nFenkl and Rodgers 3\nIndividuals approaching retirement, both gay and hetero-\nsexual, are likely to anticipate the financial and health care\nchallenges that lie ahead. However, the challenges facing\ngay men have been compounded by the institutionalized het-\nerosexism that exists within the systems of health care, gov-\nernment, and society. Institutionalized heterosexism refers to\nan ideological system that denies, denigrates, and stigma-\ntizes any nonheterosexual form of behavior, identity, rela-\nAs with institutional racism and sexism, heterosexism per-\nvades societal customs and institutions. Operating through a\ndual process of invisibility and stigma, the primary conse-\nquence of heterosexism is marginalization for those not part\nof the mainstream heterosexual culture. This marginalization\nprecludes the individual members of the gay community\nfrom real or perceived meaningful participation in society\nand perpetuates, among the marginalized, the perception that\ntheir individual needs are not being recognized or met.\nMethod\nThe method of grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006; Glaser,\nconstruct a substantive theory of the experience of aging\namong gay men. Grounded theory focuses on the perspec-\ntives of study participants in regard to their experiences\nwith a phenomenon rather than applying an existing theory\nto those experiences. Existing theories might be applicable\nto specific aspects of the experience of aging among gay\nmales but would not address the processes of aging that\nmay be uniquely specific to this population. Grounded the-\nory results in a substantive theory that reflects and is\ngrounded in the experiences of the participants in the study\nand can expand existing theoretical approaches to the\nphenomenon.\nThis study was conducted in a metropolitan area in South\nFlorida with a large population of men who identify as gay.\nAlthough it has been historically difficult to estimate the\nactual size of any gay population, recently released data from\nthe 2012 census designates the city of Fort Lauderdale as\nhaving the highest concentration of same-sex couple house-\nholds in the country with 2.8% of all households. After\nobtaining approval from the Institutional Review Board of\nthe investigator's university, the researcher distributed flyers\nat a variety of locations in the area that were frequented by\ngay men including churches, clinics, nightclubs, community\ncenters, and local retail establishments.\nThe investigator conducted 19 face-to-face interviews\nwith those who responded and who gave their informed con-\nsent to participate in the study. Eligibility criteria included\nmale participants between the ages of 55 and 70 who\nself-identified as gay. Interviews of approximately 60 to 90\nmin in length were conducted with each participant in a pri-\nvate location of the participant's choice. Following each\naudio-recorded interview, the recording was transcribed ver-\nbatim by a transcriptionist skilled in the confidential han-\ndling of research transcripts. The investigator checked each\ntranscript for accuracy by comparing it with the original\naudio recording. NVivo 8.0 software was used for data man-\nagement and the analysis proceeded from initial open, sub-\nstantive coding through category construction. Using the\nconstant comparative analysis approach described by Glaser\nprocess of analysis began with open, substantive coding. In\nthis first stage, code words or phrases were used to capture\nthe substantive content of each idea presented in the data.\nMore than one code was assigned if necessary to capture as\nmany ideas as possible without premature closure. When\nappropriate, codes were the actual words used by the partici-\npants. The next phase of analysis involved working with the\ninitial codes to identify categories of similar content and\nideas. Using the constant comparative analysis process that\nis the hallmark of grounded theory, the researcher compared\ncontent within codes and codes with other codes to identify\nsimilarities and develop a system of categories that captured\nthe experiences of the participants. These categories next\nwere examined to determine patterns and consistent ideas in\nthe categories as well as to identify areas of overlap of con-\nflict. The categories were continually reworked until a con-\ncise system of categories was developed that captured the\nexperiences of the participants in a clear, meaningful, and\nparsimonious way. The final stage of analysis involved the\nidentification of the core variable that illustrated the Basic\nSociopsychological Process present in the experiences of the\nparticipants. This was accomplished by reviewing the cate-\ngories, examining the content within categories, and ulti-\nmately determining the core or unifying thread that tied the\ncategories together. While this analysis process is described\nhere as occurring in stages, the actual work of analysis is\niterative and involved the researcher continuously reexamin-\ning the raw data, exploring questions in the data and the\nanalysis, challenging his own conceptions, and ultimately\narriving at a core variable and category system that is based\nin the experiences of the participants and that captures those\nexperiences in a meaningful way.\nThe researcher utilized a number of strategies to enhance\nthe rigor of the research throughout all of the steps of the\nprocess. Throughout the research, the investigator main-\ntained an audit trail (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) to document all\nof the aspects of the study and ensure that the findings were\nbased in the words and experiences of the participants and\nnot the ideas of the researcher (Glaser, 1978; Lincoln &\nGuba, 1985). The audit trail consisted of the actual research\ndata along with memos regarding theoretical insights gener-\nated during analysis and field notes documenting the condi-\ntions of the interview and the researcher's initial impressions.\nUsing these materials as documentation of the research pro-\ncess, the researcher engaged in extensive peer review and\ndebriefing with the coauthor in which analytic ideas and\n4 SAGE Open\nTable 1. Study Participant Demographics.\nDemographics n % Range M SD\nconclusions were challenged to ensure that results were\ngrounded in the experiences of the participants.\nFindings\nThe findings of this study were developed from 490 pages of\ninterview transcripts obtained from 19 self-identifying gay\nmale study participants (Table 1). It is important to note that\nthe study participants were for the most part White (89.4%)\nwith the majority reporting having a college degree (63.1%),\nHowever, socioeconomically, the sample was not as homo-\ngeneous with study participants reporting a wide range of\nincome levels. Overall, participants of the study perceived\ntheir experiences of aging to be overwhelmingly optimistic\nFenkl and Rodgers 5\nin spite of the adversities they have encountered in the past\nand the realities of aging that they currently face or anticipate\nencountering in the future. \"Optimistically engaging in the\npresent,\" as a core category and basic social process, is the\nculmination of three social processes that have developed\nover the course of the participants' lives, either through a\nlearned or serendipitous process, that involve resolving\nadversity, negotiating the realities of aging, and developing\nresources (Figure 1). Resolving adversity refers to the social\nprocess of coming to terms with and/or overcoming issues in\none's life that were challenging such as the stigma related to\none's sexual orientation. Negotiating the realities of aging\nrefers to the process of being cognizant of those elements of\naging that one may encounter as one ages and cannot realisti-\ncally change. Developing resources refers to the process of\nrecognizing what can be done to improve one's life and the\nexperience of aging, whether as an internal process of self-\nperception or attitude toward aging or as an external process\nof seeking out resources available in the community. The\nprocess of resolving adversity has meaning and applicability\nfor the study participants because of the unique challenges\nthey reported encountering in their lives, not exclusively, but\noften related to the stigmatization and victimization of indi-\nviduals identifying as or perceived as being gay. It should be\nfurther noted that the sample of men who participated in this\nstudy may be representative of a subset of the gay male pop-\nulation that, by virtue of their willingness to participate in\nsuch a study and self-identify as gay, may in fact be more\nwell adjusted in terms of their perceptions of self and self\nworth and have a more positive outlook on life than a sample\nof men who are not willing to self-identify as gay outside of\ntheir own social network.\nResolving adversity involves the study participants\nresolving the past and utilizing the knowledge, strength, and\nwisdom that come from such resolution in the present. When\nasked to describe their experiences of aging, study partici-\npants would often begin by saying that they did not think\nabout themselves as aging. Instead, they began by describing\nthe resolution of past conflicts and coming to terms with self\nand self-acceptance as part of their aging experience. One\nparticipant, who reported being retired as a high school crisis\ncounselor and being long-term partnered, described his satis-\nfaction with life in the present, as well as the internalized\nhomophobia he struggled with as a young man. He went on\nto describe how he resolved his conflict with his sexual ori-\nentation and how that may have contributed to his personal\nand professional development:\nOh, I feel like I've had a very good life. Yeah. I wish that I didn't\nhave the issues earlier on from like 14 to 25 of not accepting\nmyself, because really that's what it was. I just could not accept\nthat I was gay. I just thought I was a sick individual. And our\nso that was like a lot of waste of energy also. But, I guess it made\nme more observant about people and it made me study more\nabout psychology and it made me become a psychologist.\nThis study participant described how, in part, resolving\nthe internal conflict he had with his sexual orientation took\nthe form of learning to accept himself as a gay man. His\nacceptance of self as a gay man fostered an interest in psy-\nchology and that interest developed into a professional\nendeavor as a school psychologist. In turn, his chosen profes-\nsion put him in a position to help other young people who\nstruggled with their own sexual orientation, and provided\nhim with greater career and personal satisfaction knowing he\ncould make a difference in others' lives.\nThe process of negotiating realities is the second of the\nthree processes that emerged as foundational to the basic\nsocial process of optimistically engaging in the present.\nNegotiating realities involves the interplay between the chal-\nlenges anticipated by all individuals as they get older--such\nas financial burdens, declining health and health care, loss of\nindependence, retirement, and the need for care in older\nage--and the challenges the study participants may encoun-\nter that are more consistent with a gay male culture. Those\nchallenges include an overemphasis on appearance and\nyouth, isolation due to lack of familial or social support, and\nvulnerability to homophobia and victimization. Negotiating\nrealities is characterized by study participants acknowledg-\ning changes as they related to aging, including how aging has\ninfluenced their perceptions of self and getting older and the\npossibility of declining health. One study participant, age 62,\na nurse who also was a well-known female impersonator in\nthe community, was interviewed shortly after having a\nbelow-the-knee amputation as a consequence of a diabetic\ninfection. He described his perception of health and health\ncare and aging as a gay male:\nWhen you're young you don't really worry about health care.\nYou know, it's just not on the top of your priority list. Being\nolder and gay you kind of learn that the future is very unsure\nbecause, you know, so many gay people are alienated from\nfriends and family because they are gay, and that the older they\nget, it's much more frightening to think that they're gonna be\nalone. So, prepare, tell, people, especially gay people because\nthey have that tendency of not doing that because they live the\ncarefree life all their life, that this is part of their way of living,\nprepare, prepare, 'cause you don't know, and it's not easy being,\nOptimistically\nEngaging in\nthe Present\nResolving\nAdversity\nNegotiating\nRealities\nDeveloping\nResources\nFigure 1. Optimistically Engaging in the Present.\n6 SAGE Open\na charity case now when I'm used to asking people for help and\nnow I have to survive. So that's a big change in my life right now\nis that I have to ask people for help.\nAlthough study participants described the realities related\nto aging in terms of what they perceived to be the challenges\nconfronting them as they age, they generally did so with an\noptimistic perspective. However, optimistically engaging in\nthe present requires more than just an optimistic perspective;\nit also involves resources that facilitate the successful nego-\ntiation of the realities of aging. Study participants described\na variety of resources that facilitated that process.\nThe process of developing resources, third of the three\nprocesses, emerged as another important category of the\nbasic social process of optimistically engaging in the present.\nThe process of developing resources has meaning and appli-\ncability for the study participants as the resources were\ndeveloped over the course of a lifetime and were often devel-\noped in response to having to resolve the adversities they\nencountered, either as individuals or as members of a poten-\ntially stigmatized population. The development of these\nresources and their usefulness in application to the chal-\nlenges of aging contribute to the basic social process of opti-\nmistically engaging in the present and are inherently\nconnected with the processes of resolving adversity and\nnegotiating realities. Study participants described a variety\nof resources. These resources included being active in the\ncommunity, having a sense of faith or spirituality, having\nfeelings of acceptance both of oneself and by one's commu-\nnity, seeking out gay-friendly health care providers, main-\ntaining a positive outlook on life, having a strong social\nsupport network, being satisfied with one's life, having a\npositive perception of self, and acknowledging the signifi-\ncance of being partnered. One participant, aged 67, described\nfaith and spirituality in terms of the unique opportunity he\nperceived gay men to have over their heterosexual counter-\nparts from a more secular angle:\nI want to be 80 and I want to be enjoying life. I see a lot of\nspiritual groups. I see a lot of weeklong retreats, a lot of, you\nknow, organizations that are doing positive things for the gay\ncommunity and people are involved with, and I think all of that\nis because we are demanding more. We're demanding that life\nbe good, we're demanding that we're fulfilled in this world. And\nbecause of that, all these things are popping up that will allow\npeople to get together and discuss issues like that and, you know,\nthe straight world may have that, but I think the straight world\nhas it probably through religious organizations. And because so\nmany gay people aren't tied into specific religious organizations,\nI think we're freer to create the secular organizations that treat\nour spiritual needs.\nAgain, this participant provides further insight into how\ngay men perceive themselves in the aging process and subse-\nquently describes how their needs in advanced age can be\nmet in a more culturally competent approach. Cultural\ncompetence is also relevant to the health care needs of older\ngay men. When asked about health care, most study partici-\npants described being most comfortable with what they\ndescribed as \"gay friendly\" providers. Gay-friendly provid-\ners were providers that were either gay themselves or provid-\ners that served a population of gay men. Gay-friendly\nproviders were perceived as being more open to discussion\nrelated to gay male sexual health and more aware of the psy-\nchosocial challenges that may be specific to older gay men\nsuch as loss of a partner. Table 2 provides an overview of the\nspecific categories and components that emerged as part of\nthe process of optimistically engaging in the present. These\ncategories and components are relevant and particularly\nhelpful as a framework for assessing the needs of older adults\nwho identify as gay, as well as relevant for other older adults.\nImplications for Research and Practice\nThe population of self-identifying older gay men is growing.\nThis is the result of both the growing population of older\nadults in general as well as the growing visibility of people\nwho identify as gay (Cahill, South, & Spade, 2000; Grant,\nboth size and visibility, so too will the need for an evidence-\nbased understanding of the issues that are unique to this popu-\nlation. The findings of this qualitative study are unique to the\nparticular time and place in which the study data was col-\nlected and no claims can be asserted with regard to the gener-\nalizability of these findings to other samples of gay men in\nother geographic area. However, these findings do in fact\nreinforce the argument that sexual minorities such as gay men\nare more optimistic about their lives when living in an envi-\nronment that is supportive, more inclusive, and less stigmatiz-\ning. In spite of the optimism that was evident in participants\nin this study, it is important to note that LGBT Americans are\nrecognized by The U.S. Department of Health and Human\nTable 2.

In addition, there are long-lasting effects on the indi-\nvidual and the community from frequent experiences of\nviolence and victimization, as well as struggling with issues\nof acceptance, personal, family, and societal (Simone &\nAppelbaum, 2011). The question that begs an answer for\npractitioners is how to make environments more supportive\nand inclusive, and less stigmatizing when the community at\nlarge is not necessarily so. In terms of research, perhaps the\ngreatest threat to the health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual\nAmericans is the lack of scientific information about their\nhealth and the lack of knowledge related to LGBT patient\ncentered outcomes. While the findings of this study contrib-\nute to an increased understanding of the health and psychoso-\ncial needs of gay men in a geographic location that is\nwelcoming to gay men and provides a supportive environ-\nment, both through the resources available and the sheer num-\nber of gay men living in the geographical area, further similar\nresearch is warranted that targets more diverse gay male pop-\nulations in less supportive environments, particularly among\nmen who are not openly gay and live closeted lives. Such\nresearch is likely to reveal a myriad of findings related to gay\nmale aging experiences. This is important as the expansion of\nthe knowledge base to include groups who have been over-\nlooked, such as gay men, provides health care professionals\nwith a heightened awareness of the challenges encountered\nby such groups, and is foundational to culturally appropriate\nand individualized care. It is also important to note that in\nspite of the optimism revealed in the findings here, stigma\nstills plays a prominent role in the delivery of LGBT health\ncare. The potential stigmatization that older gay men encoun-\nter in health care settings can be decreased when health care\nprofessionals have a greater understanding of the life experi-\nences and perspectives that this population brings into the\nhealth care setting. This is a pivotal point as the local health\ncare environment determines one's experiences and is highly\nvariable. For example, the findings of the study presented in\nthis article demonstrated that the sample population preferred\ngay-friendly health care providers and thrived in a supportive\nsocial environment. Gay men who are not comfortable dis-\nclosing their sexual orientation to health care providers may\nbe at risk of not receiving an appropriate health care screen-\ning. In addition, participants of this study reported concerns\nrelated to physical changes, financial status, isolation, loss of\nindependence, and sexual relations and functioning. This\ngreater understanding of the superimposed conditions that\naccompany aging among gay men is imperative for health\ncare and other professionals across a spectrum of practice.\nBased on these findings, strategies for addressing sexual ori-\nentation with clients that promote feelings of acceptance and\nunderstanding should be considered, as disclosure of one's\nsexual identity is often related to perceived safety, and the\npervasive expectation of gender conformity on the part of\nhealth care professionals can be alienating. In addition,\nassessments that may be of concern to older gay male clients\nsuch as alterations in physical appearance, perceptions of\nfeeling isolated or lonely, relationship status, and sexual func-\ntioning and satisfaction should be considered. Equally impor-\ntant is the assessment of caregiver-role stress of the older gay\nmale client. As this population ages, the likelihood that they\nwill find themselves in a caregiver role is also likely to\nincrease, particularly for those who have been long-term part-\nnered. Within the context of this study, agencies and organiza-\ntions were identified that were geared specifically toward the\nneeds of older LGBT individuals. Based on these findings,\nprofessionals working with an older population should con-\nsider the supportive environments that can most benefit this\npopulation in the community, and even consider partnering\nwith these organizations to better serve the needs of their cli-\nents (Rosenfeld, Bartlam, & Smith, 2012). These interven-\ntions would include an understanding of the resources that are\navailable in the community that can facilitate peer support as\nwell as the referral to agencies and organizations that are best\nsuited to meeting the needs of an older gay population.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAcquaviva, K.
