    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground/aims: During the 2014\u00ad2016 West African Ebola epidemic, clinical trials were fast-tracked in order to\nidentify prophylactic vaccines and experimental treatments that might be useful in preventing or treating Ebola. These\ntrials included the ongoing EBOVAC-Salone study, which was established and implemented in Sierra Leone to assess the\nsafety and immunogenicity of the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo prime-boost Ebola vaccine regimen.\nMethods: This article describes the experiences of the EBOVAC-Salone research team in setting up and implementing\nthe trial, and provides recommendations for research teams aiming to conduct clinical trials in future outbreak situations.\nResults: Establishing a clinical trial during an outbreak brought some unique challenges, including those related to trial\ndesign and the regulatory environment, operational issues, and community engagement. The situation was further com-\nplicated by the weak infrastructure and limited experience of clinical trials in Sierra Leone. However, operating in an out-\nbreak context also brought some benefits to the research team, including strong stakeholder support. The EBOVAC-\nSalone study recruited participants both during and after the outbreak, leading to additional challenges to trial implemen-\ntation during the post-outbreak transition.\nConclusion: Many lessons have been learned about setting up and implementing a clinical trial during a devastating\nEbola epidemic, and some of the experiences of the EBOVAC-Salone team were mirrored by those of other researchers\noperating in the region. Common to several of these research groups is a recommendation that research should be\nmore closely incorporated into outbreak response planning, which could expedite the establishment of timely and\nappropriate research projects. We recommend that the lessons learned by researchers during the West African Ebola\nepidemic are built into programmes and strategies to improve the responses to future epidemics, wherever they occur.\n",

Vaccination of adult trial participants began on\n9 October 2015. The study is ongoing and has recruited\nand vaccinated participants both before and after the\nend of the Ebola epidemic, declared by the World\nThis article offers observations on some of the chal-\nlenges encountered and lessons learned while setting up\nand recruiting participants into a clinical trial during\nand after an epidemic, and makes recommendations on\nhow these could be addressed in the future should a\nsimilar public health emergency arise. Several research\ngroups have published their own experiences of con-\nducting clinical trials during the Ebola outbreak, and\nthe literature paints a picture of the context within\nwhich the EBOVAC-Salone trial was established. A\nnumber of researchers have described the difficulty of\ndesigning a robust yet ethical trial during an outbreak5,6\nand then having to amend or abandon their original\nstudy objectives as the epidemic waned.5,7 Others high-\nlighted the limitations imposed by the infrastructure of\nthe country in which they were operating.5 The chal-\nlenges were not just for researchers: the burden on local\nethics committees, dealing with huge increases in work-\nload, was also noted.7\u00ad9\nWhile many of the challenges and lessons described\nin this article have been shared by other researchers,\nthis article makes a novel contribution to the literature\nas one of the few trials to enrol participants both dur-\ning and after the epidemic. This gives the authors an\nadditional perspective into issues such as community\nengagement, participant recruitment and trial design,\nall of which were affected by the end of the outbreak.\nMethods and results\nTrial design\nThe design of the EBOVAC-Salone study was revised\non several occasions in response to the evolution of the\nEbola epidemic. During the epidemic's peak in 2014, an\n80,000-person, individually randomised, controlled trial\nwas considered briefly that aimed to determine the effi-\ncacy of the Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo regimen com-\npared to a control vaccine. However, administration of\na placebo during a viral outbreak with such a high case-\nfatality rate had never been done before, and the ethics\nof this were hotly debated.10\nAlternative trial designs were considered, including a\ncluster-randomised trial and a stepped-wedge design.11\nIn January 2015, taking into account ethical concerns,\nthe epidemic circumstances, field conditions, and statis-\ntical considerations, the trial was redesigned as a large\nticipants to be randomised to receiving either immedi-\nate or delayed vaccination. Regulatory authorities in\nSierra Leone requested a staged approach to recruit-\nment to first determine the safety of the vaccine, with\ninitial enrolment of 40 adults who were to be offered\nimmediate vaccination (Stage 1), followed by enrolment\nof 400 adults (Stage 2) before commencing the main\ncluster-randomised trial.11\nSite visits and mathematical modelling were used to\nhelp determine both the sample size and geographical\nlocation of the study. By the first quarter of 2015, the\nepidemic was slowing and it was important to determine\nwhether there would be a sufficient number of cases to\ndetermine vaccine efficacy. Kambia District in northern\nSierra Leone was chosen as the site for the study because\nno other prophylactic vaccine trial was underway in that\npart of the country and because modelling data pre-\ndicted a 50% probability of the epidemic being over in\nlikelihood in Port Loko and Western Area, the other\ndistricts under consideration, by August 2015.\nHowever, the epidemic declined at a faster rate than\nexpected during the first quarter of 2015 throughout\nSierra Leone. By May 2015, it was clear that the study\nwould be unable to determine vaccine efficacy. The\ncluster-randomised trial protocol was therefore aban-\ndoned before it was approved by the regulatory author-\nities, and the primary objective for the study was\nchanged to determination of the safety and immuno-\ngenicity of the regimen,11 with an estimated sample size\nof approximately 3500 participants. Stage 1 was kept as\nopen label vaccination of 40 healthy adult participants.\nIn December 2015, following the end of the outbreak,\nthe use of placebo was reintroduced to the study design.\nStage 2 was formally amended to a double-blind rando-\nmised controlled trial assessing the safety and immuno-\ngenicity of the vaccine regimen, with follow-up for\n12 months and a sample size of approximately 730 par-\nticipants. Enrolment of 400 adults (randomised in a 3:1\nratio of Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN-Filo to MENVEO\u00d2)\nhas been followed by an age de-escalation component\nfor paediatric participants.\nThe changes to the trial design affected many\naspects of the study beyond what is typically\nencountered in the setup phase of a trial. As the trial\ndesign evolved, budgets underwent multiple revisions,\nand project plans changed significantly while the team\nwaited for approvals, with associated amendments to\norders and procurement of equipment and consum-\nables. The expectations of stakeholders and community\nmembers had to be managed as the study enrolment\ntarget was significantly reduced which shrank the\nstudy's geographical footprint from an initial district-\nwide catchment area, to just the inhabitants of two of\nthe district's main towns.\nPartnerships\nThe time pressures of operating during an outbreak\ninfluenced how partnerships in Sierra Leone were\nestablished, and the study was implemented by organi-\nsations which had not previously worked together.\nPartners in-country were needed quickly to provide\nlocal leadership and expertise, and to implement field\nactivities for the trial. After discussions with Sierra\nLeone's Ministry of Health and Sanitation and other\nstakeholders, a research partnership was established\nwith the University of Sierra Leone's College of\nMedicine and Allied Health Sciences. However,\nCollege of Medicine staff had limited experience of clin-\nical trials and therefore significant technical support\nwas required from the London School of Hygiene &\nTropical Medicine and the trial sponsor.\nTwo non-governmental organisations also worked\non the trial. Goal joined as the trial's logistics partner,\nwhile World Vision were engaged to provide commu-\nnity engagement and IT support, amongst other activi-\nties. Clinical research is outside of the usual remit of\nthese organisations, and therefore it was essential that\nall partners understood others' requirements and lim-\nitations from the beginning of the project.\nRegulatory and ethics reviews\nEBOVAC-Salone study approvals were required from\nthe London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine\nEthics Committee, the Sierra Leone Ethical and\nScientific Review Committee, and the Pharmacy Board\nof Sierra Leone the national regulatory authority.\nDuring the Ebola epidemic, the African Vaccine\nRegulatory Forum, with support from the World\nHealth Organization, established a platform for con-\nducting joint reviews of clinical trial applications with\ninput from international regulatory agencies. This\naimed to achieve rapid comprehensive reviews of clini-\ncal trials in the context of potentially limited regulatory\nand ethics review capacity in the sub-Saharan African\ncountries participating in Ebola vaccine trials.12 The\nEBOVAC-Salone study team engaged with the African\nVaccine Regulatory Forum review process at a meeting\nin April 2015 that was also attended by the Pharmacy\nBoard of Sierra Leone and the Sierra Leonean ethics\ncommittee.\nDuring the epidemic, the ethics committees and the\nPharmacy Board implemented an expedited review pro-\ncess for Ebola-related studies. Both Sierra Leonean\nauthorities experienced a dramatic rise in workload in\nfor Ebola-related research. Despite this, the authorities\ncontinued to give thorough reviews and completed\nmost reviews within 1 month following submission.\nThe sponsor and study team engaged the authorities\nfrom the start of the project, to prepare them for the\npossibility of study design changes in response to the\nevolving epidemic.\nEthical considerations\nShortly after the Ebola epidemic was declared a Public\nHealth Emergency of International Concern, the World\nHealth Organization established a panel of experts to\ndiscuss ethical questions relating to the use of unproven\ninterventions, with discussions held around appropriate\ntrial designs during an outbreak.13 Both the World\nHealth Organization's ethics panel and a group of\nexpert anthropologists issued guidance to research\ngroups planning to conduct clinical trials during the\nAn overarching ethical concern was that clinical\nresearch should not impact on the health system or the\nemergency response. The World Health Organization\ncoordinated prioritisation of the most promising\nresearch, so as not to overburden the health systems in\nthe affected countries.15 In Sierra Leone, planning for\nthe EBOVAC-Salone study was undertaken in partner-\nship with the College of Medicine and Allied Health\nSciences, and a criterion was set that healthcare work-\ners involved in the emergency response would not be\nrecruited to the study team. Senior staff were therefore\nrecruited from overseas to provide technical support,\nwhile also building the experience of more junior\nnational staff who had not previously been involved in\nclinical research.\nThe question of whether trials should be placebo-\ncontrolled was particularly contentious,16\u00ad19 although\nnot a new debate.19 During initial discussions held in\nSierra Leone in early 2015 by the EBOVAC-Salone\nteam, the country's authorities did not favour a rando-\nmised placebo-controlled trial, and this ethical concern\ninformed the study design as discussed above. In com-\nmon with some other Ebola vaccine trials taking place\nin the region, the research team therefore developed an\ninnovative trial design to study efficacy without the use\nof a placebo. This trial design was never implemented,\nbecause the epidemic's decline made it impossible to\nestablish vaccine efficacy before this study could be\ninitiated.\nFurther ethical issues became apparent once the\nstudy began. EBOVAC-Salone social science research\nindicated that one of the motivating factors for partici-\npation in the trial was an expectation that the vaccine\nwould be effective. The research team addressed this by\nplacing additional emphasis on the investigational\nnature of the vaccine during community outreach activ-\nities and the informed consent process. The latter\nincluded a test which participants had to pass before\nbeing enrolled to demonstrate their understanding of\nthe trial.\nInitial participant recruitment took place prior to the\nend of the epidemic, and demand to participate in the\nstudy at that time was greater than the number of parti-\ncipants needed. To ensure fair subject selection, a lot-\ntery system was devised, whereby households were\nselected and prioritised in an open ballot.20 An age de-\nescalation approach was adopted with safety data being\nreviewed by an independent data monitoring committee\nprior to the enrolment of each cohort of children.\nPregnant women were excluded because of concerns\nover the safety of viral vaccines given during pregnancy.\nThis exclusion criterion was common to all Ebola vac-\ncine trials in the region, although some authors have\nargued that, in future, pregnant women should not be\ndenied the potential benefits of participating in clinical\nresearch in an outbreak of such high mortality.21\nCommunications and engagement\nThe normal processes of engaging with communities\nprior to a trial of a new investigational medical product\nwere given an additional layer of complexity by the\nEbola outbreak. The challenges of community engage-\nment and building trust and awareness in a setting with\nno experience of clinical trials, such as Kambia, were\nexacerbated by the urgency to commence the research.\nFormative, qualitative research into community\ndynamics and perceptions around Ebola and the clini-\ncal trial were especially important during a period that\nwas characterised by a lack of trust in both national\nand international organisations.22 This research, and\nongoing tracking of rumours and concerns, helped tar-\nget engagement approaches and community messaging.\nFor example, a rumour that the vaccine trial was bring-\ning Ebola back to the community, nicknamed `Ebola\nPhase Two', was identified by the social scientists. The\ncommunity liaison team responded by visiting the mar-\nket where the rumour had originated and initiating\nmeetings to address the concerns with the support of\npre-briefed local stakeholders.\nEstablishing the study while the emergency response\ninfrastructure was in place was challenging for the\nstudy's community engagement in some ways, but\nfacilitated it in others. The Ebola response centres\nbrought stakeholders together, providing an efficient\nmechanism through which these individuals could be\nbriefed. Because many stakeholders were already\nengaged in the fight against Ebola, they were often par-\nticularly receptive to research teams.\nHowever, in an environment where people were des-\nperate for solutions, the study's community engage-\nment had to clearly differentiate the research project\nfrom the Ebola response to avoid possible misinterpre-\ntations that the trial was delivering a licenced vaccine\nas part of the humanitarian response.\nParticipant recruitment\nDuring the outbreak, community interest in participat-\ning in the first stage of the study was high. EBOVAC's\nsocial science research indicated a range of motivating\nfactors behind participation in the early stages of the\ntrial, including the notion of `sacrifice' or duty as a citi-\nzen; and hope or belief in the power of the vaccine to\nprevent Ebola.\nContrary to the experience of some groups conduct-\ning research during the outbreak, generous financial\ncompensation was not necessary to stimulate participa-\ntion in the trial in Kambia.8 Study partners sought\nadvice from the national ethics committee before agree-\ning to rates that would fairly recompense a participant's\ntime and transport without providing undue induce-\nment, based on estimated lost earnings and transport\ncosts to and from the clinic.\nHuman resources\nThe limited pool of clinicians in Sierra Leone was\nseverely affected by the outbreak as Ebola-related mor-\ntality among health workers was particularly high.23\nPrior to the epidemic, Sierra Leone ranked fifth from\nbottom among 193 countries in terms of numbers of\nphysicians per head of population.24 As discussed\nabove, so as not to further weaken the wider health sys-\ntem, the research team committed not to recruit any\nhealthcare workers employed in the government health\nsystem or involved in the Ebola response without the\napproval of the appropriate authorities.\nBecause limited clinical research had been conducted\nin Sierra Leone prior to the Ebola epidemic, there were\nvery few individuals in the country with appropriate\nresearch experience, and those that had this were gener-\nally involved in other Ebola-related studies. Technical\nand scientific support was therefore provided to the in-\ncountry team, facilitated by the London School of\nHygiene & Tropical Medicine's response to the epi-\ndemic that allowed staff to temporarily leave their cur-\nrent post to work on the Ebola response.\nIt proved challenging to attract suitably qualified\nand experienced applicants to work in longer term posi-\ntions on the trial. This may have been due to the per-\nceived risk of working in an Ebola-affected country,\nbecause the trial site was in a relatively undeveloped\ndistrict, and because people with the relevant skills\nwere not available to apply for posts at short notice. In\naddition, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical\nMedicine is not an emergency response organisation\nand therefore did not provide hardship or risk allowan-\nces to staff employed on the study.\nOperational issues\nMany operational challenges arose because the epi-\ndemic occurred in a region with a low level of develop-\nment; Sierra Leone remains among the world's poorest\ncountries and suffers from poor infrastructure.25\nOutside an outbreak situation, a rural district like\nKambia would not be a natural choice for an urgent\ntrial due to the extensive requirements and costs of deli-\nvering a Good Clinical Practice\u00adcompliant study in this\nsetting.\nKambia is not on the national power grid and there-\nfore a 24 hour generator-based power supply was\ninstalled for vaccine storage, offices, and laboratories,\nand a fuel supply chain and fuel store were established.\nWhile it was possible to rent, renovate, and equip exist-\ning buildings for the research clinics and offices, it was\nnecessary to construct a vaccine storage facility and\nestablish a research laboratory. Logistics became hugely\ntime-consuming, necessitating dedicated operations\nstaff to oversee construction, electrical installations,\nand laboratory setup. In common with many emer-\ngency situations, the cost of accommodation, rental and\nconstruction of buildings, and goods such as furniture\nrose substantially with the arrival of Ebola response\npartners.\nEmergency public health restrictions implemented to\ncurtail the spread of Ebola affected the establishment of\nthe study. For example, nightly curfews limited working\nhours, including on the study-related construction and\nrenovations, and restricted the movement of people and\nvehicles throughout the country.\nHowever, engagement with the Ebola response\nauthorities allowed the team to gain special dispensa-\ntion to assist with setting up the research project. These\nincluded securing permits to allow team members to\ntravel during curfew periods in Kambia; and a blanket\nexemption on import tax for equipment and\nconsumables.\nPost-outbreak transition\nThe EBOVAC-Salone trial is now in the age de-\nescalation stage of the trial and has experienced the\ntransition from working in an outbreak setting to a\npost-outbreak setting, and the return to `business as\nusual'.\nThe response infrastructure in Sierra Leone was\nquickly dismantled once the outbreak ended and the\nstakeholder landscape changed almost overnight as\nroles and responsibilities at national and district level\nreverted to their pre-Ebola position. The study team\nhad to reassess the potential influence of various indi-\nviduals or institutions on the trial and adjust relation-\nships accordingly.\nThe dispensations related to the emergency situation\nwere suspended rapidly once the outbreak was declared\nover. This included the waiver on importation taxes,\nwhich was not clearly communicated to the research\nteam, thereby complicating the clearing of a subsequent\nshipment.\nAfter the outbreak had ended, interest in study par-\nticipation decreased, in part due to a shift in the risk/\nbenefit perception of members of the community, many\nof whom felt that Ebola had been eradicated perma-\nnently. The household lottery method for recruiting\nparticipants was therefore expanded and a broader `first\ncome, first served' approach was adopted.\nPost-outbreak, many of the logistical challenges\nremain such as the lack of a mains power supply, and\nstaff recruitment and retention to a relatively remote\narea of the country. Despite these challenges, the study\ncompleted enrolment of adult participants in October\n2016 and is recruiting participants into the age de-\nescalation component of the trial. Over 100 Sierra\nLeonean study personnel, including some Kambia\nGovernment Hospital staff, have been trained in essen-\ntial research skills and clinical management. This will\nhopefully provide a legacy and a platform on which to\nbuild further research in the district.\nRecommendations\nFollowing the experiences of establishing the\nEBOVAC-Salone trial and the lessons learned between\nfor teams aiming to conduct research during epidemics.\nTrial design\nResearch teams, funders, regulatory authorities, and\nethics committees should be flexible and prepared for\nadditional workloads when initiating and implementing\nclinical trials in outbreak settings, as trial designs may\nneed to be adapted and submitted for review several\ntimes over a short period. Modelling can be utilised to\npredict trends and help identify research sites as the\nepidemic unfolds. For trials of investigational medical\nproducts, study design changes may continue after an\nepidemic ends as the advice of international regulatory\nauthorities may also change if the results of the trial\nare part of the submission for licensure. There is now a\nsubstantial body of information regarding the accept-\nability of outbreak-specific trial designs from the Ebola\nepidemic that could be used to inform template trial\ndesigns in advance of future outbreaks.\nPartnerships\nIdentifying partnerships with established, on-the-\nground organisations may require urgent networking\nand meetings to build trust and agree goals if partners\nhave not worked together before. Linkages with orga-\nnisations that are not necessarily `classical' research\npartners can be extremely valuable for implementing\nresearch in an emergency situation.\nRegulatory and ethics reviews\nEthical and regulatory authorities in countries with lim-\nited experience of clinical trials or other studies con-\nducted during an epidemic may need to be supported\nby regional and international bodies to develop guide-\nlines for study submissions during epidemics.\nAdditional funding may be required to increase capac-\nity for urgent reviews. The African Vaccine Regulatory\nForum and similar bodies can usefully support ethics\ncommittees and regulators to facilitate the review and\napproval of clinical trials conducted during an epidemic\nif utilised at the right time, and sponsors and research-\ners should engage early with such a forum.\nEthical considerations\nExperiences around ethical issues pertaining to the\ndesign and implementation of clinical trials during the\nEbola epidemic should be considered for future out-\nbreaks. As soon as an outbreak is declared, the poten-\ntial need for appropriate research should be considered\nas an integral part of the response planning to ensure\nthat possible ethical concerns come to the fore and are\ndebated at the first possible opportunity. Research\nmust not have a detrimental impact on either the out-\nbreak response or health systems.\nCommunications and engagement\nSocial scientists should be considered an integral part of\nany large clinical trial team, particularly for trials in an\noutbreak situation where it is vital to understand com-\nmunity dynamics and concerns that may change fre-\nquently. During an outbreak, additional efforts may be\nneeded to explain and reinforce the distinction between\nan investigational medical product and a licenced treat-\nment or vaccine, especially when fear of infection may\nbe more likely to influence participant decision-making.\nParticipant recruitment\nInterest in participation may fluctuate based on com-\nmunity perceptions of risk associated with the outbreak\nand the benefits of participation, and recruitment stra-\ntegies may therefore need to be adapted as epidemics\nevolve or wane.\nHuman resources\nResearchers should engage local health authorities to\nestablish guidelines for recruiting staff to prevent weak-\nening outbreak responses or health systems.\nRecruitment of certain cadres of staff from countries or\nareas not affected by the outbreak may need to be con-\nsidered, at least temporarily.\nOperational issues\nDuring an outbreak, researchers may need to choose\nstudy sites that are not ideal in order to conduct the\nstudy in a suitable target population while avoiding\nother research projects. Researchers should respect\nemergency restrictions, but may be able to explore dis-\npensations with the public health authorities if they do\nnot pose a risk to outbreak control activities.\nResearchers should establish what happens to these dis-\npensations should the outbreak end.\nPost-outbreak transition\nResearchers should ensure that they identify and engage\nboth routine and response structures and government\nregulations to help ensure continuity of support and\ntrial activities once an outbreak is over.\nConclusion\nMany challenges have been identified while setting up\nand implementing clinical trials during the West\nAfrican Ebola epidemic. We found that, despite imple-\nmenting a study with new research partners in a district\nwith poor infrastructure and health services, where clin-\nical research is in its infancy, interest in participation\nwas high. The EBOVAC-Salone study has enrolled a\nstudy continues to enrol younger cohorts of partici-\npants. However, in common with other research\ngroups, we recommend that research should be more\nclosely involved in outbreak response planning, which\ncould expedite the establishment of research projects\nand maximise their chances of success.\nWhile many of the lessons learned from the\nEBOVAC-Salone experience will be specific to the con-\ntext of the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, it is hoped\nthat the principles behind them are transferable to\nresearch teams in other outbreak situations. These rec-\nommendations could be added to programmes and\nstrategies to improve the responses to future epidemics.\n"
