    "abstract": "Abstract\nIn this article, we describe a knowledge translation symposium focused on rehabilitation research for older adults. The\nsymposium consisted of presentations on rehabilitation research, followed by roundtable discussions designed to solicit\nperspectives of public stakeholders. Eighty-eight people attended the event, most with backgrounds in health care service\nprovision. The participants evaluated the event and provided feedback on research topics related to rehabilitation of older\nadults. Lessons learned from this event may be useful in the design of future knowledge translation symposia and to facilitate\ninvolvement of public stakeholders in design, implementation, and dissemination of rehabilitation research for older adults.\n",

This process is known as citizen engagement and is\nintegral to translating knowledge generated from research\ninto health care practice and policy (Boote, 2011; CIHR,\n2010). CIHR use the term citizens to refer to any individuals\nwho are stakeholders in research, including patients, caregiv-\ners, advocacy groups, members of the general public, health\ncare professionals, and other service providers.\nAt citizen engagement events, researchers and citizens\ncome together to discuss, deliberate, and make decisions\nregarding research processes. This type of collaboration\nhelps to ensure the outcomes of research will be relevant,\nwidely disseminated, and readily implemented into policy\nand practice (CIHR, 2010). Through citizen engagement,\nstakeholders may have a sense of ownership in research.\nAlso, research organizations may be better able to dedicate\nresources to priority areas identified by stakeholders (CIHR,\nOlder adults (i.e., individuals older than 65 years) are the\nfastest growing segment of the population in Canada and\nmany other countries of the world (United Nations, 2002). As\na result of this growth, age-associated health conditions that\nrequire rehabilitation are also more prevalent. Thus, health\nand rehabilitation research with older adults are receiving\nincreased attention (Chappell, McDonald, &Stones, 2008).\nCitizen engagement can help with determining the direction\nengaged the public across Canada in discussions about direc-\ntions for research for older adults during their Regional\nSeniors'Workshops on Research. At these workshops, public\nstakeholders were primarily older adults (65+ years). In their\nsummary document, CIHR reported the following topics as\npriorities among participants: access to health services\n(including rehabilitation), determinants of health related to\nlifestyle, transportation and mobility issues, and knowledge\ntranslation (KT) (CIHR Institute of Aging, 2007). The\nreported interest of older adults in rehabilitation research\nprompted an interdisciplinary group of researchers at\nUniversity of Alberta to develop a citizen engagement event\ngeared to stakeholders in Edmonton, Alberta.\nRehabilitation Research and KT\nThe ability to carry out basic activities of daily living (i.e.,\nfunctional abilities) can make the difference in how, where,\n1Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton,\nCanada\nCorresponding Author:\nCary A.

Functional abilities\ndetermine the choices individuals have and the satisfaction\nthey take in daily life (Chappell & Cooke, 2010).\nRehabilitation disciplines, including occupational therapy,\nphysical therapy, speech\u00adlanguage pathology, and recre-\national therapy, play key roles in the management of many\nchronic conditions experienced by older adults. Clinical\nresearch in rehabilitation of older adults is focused on func-\ntional issues arising from a wide spectrum of biomechanical,\nneurological, cognitive, and mental health conditions.\nThe findings of rehabilitation research can be used to sup-\nport policy and guide practice such that interventions are evi-\ndence based, effective, and fiscally efficient. However,\nstakeholders (including older adults and professionals who\nwork with them) first need to become aware of research find-\nings and the role of researchers in knowledge creation. The\ndissemination, exchange, and application of knowledge are\ncollectively referred to as KT (CIHR, 2013). To date, KT\nresearch in rehabilitation is still sparse and largely unex-\nplored (Jones, Roop, Pohar, Albrecht, & Scott, 2014; Menon,\nKorner-Bitensky, Kastner, McKibbon, & Straus, 2009; Scott\net al., 2012). The traditional practice of KT involves research-\ners focusing their dissemination activities toward other\nresearchers and health care professionals through scholarly\npublications and presentations. Ideally, researchers should\nwork toward KT models that involve a genuine collaborative\nprocess founded on valuing exchange among a variety of\nstakeholders through citizen engagement.\nThe primary purpose of this article is to describe the\nimplementation of a citizen engagement event, the\nKnowledge Translation and Network Engagement (KTNE)\nsymposium. This symposium was carried out by a group of\nresearchers that comprise the Special Interest Group on\nAging at the University of Alberta. The secondary purpose of\nthis article is to present a summary of the participants' per-\nspectives on rehabilitation research gleaned from roundtable\ndiscussions and written feedback, as well as their opinions\non the process and content of the KTNE symposium.\nThe KTNE Symposium\nThe Special Interest Group on Aging (SIGA) in the Faculty\nof Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta\nincludes researchers from speech\u00adlanguage pathology, occu-\npational therapy, and physical therapy, whose area of research\nspecifically involves rehabilitation of older adults. The man-\ndate of this group of researchers is research collaboration\n(i.e., \"the working together of researchers to achieve the\ncommon goal of producing new scientific knowledge\"; Katz\n& Martin, 1997, p. 7), trainee mentorship and consultation.\nMembers conduct research in areas such as arthritis, sleep,\npain, communication, swallowing, mental health, resiliency,\nhealth-related quality of life, and the use of technology to\npromote activities of daily living. Although diverse, these\nresearch areas are linked by an overriding theme: protecting,\nmaintaining, and improving older adults' functional\nabilities.\nThe KTNE symposium was focused on exchanging\nknowledge and ideas related to rehabilitation research\ninvolving older adults. The goals for the KTNE event were\nas follows:\n1. Disseminate information--provide evidence-based\ninformation about recent advances in older adult\nrehabilitation to citizen stakeholders;\n2. Exchange ideas--enable citizens' access to informa-\ntion that is relevant and applicable to functional abili-\nties and quality of life of older adults; solicit ideas\nfrom stakeholders to guide researchers in developing\nresearch hypotheses and objectives to meet the reha-\nbilitation needs of older adults;\n3. Develop collaborative partnerships--foster trust and\nmutual respect between researchers and stakeholders\nto ensure citizens will advise and collaborate to guide\nfuture rehabilitation research projects; and\n4. Gather feedback from participants--collect partici-\npant feedback about meaningfulness and usefulness\nof the pilot activity to improve future KTNE events.\nSymposium Format and Participants\nThe KTNE symposium was advertised to the public with the\ntitle \"Seniors' Rehabilitation: An Update on Research That\nMatters to You.\" Researchers sent out notification of the\nevent via email to local organizations who serve older adults\nand/or have connections such organizations. Ninety-one\nindividuals preregistered and provided information about\ntheir backgrounds (see Table 1). The majority of the regis-\ntrants indicated that they were health care providers or other\nservice providers who worked with older adults. Eighty-\neight citizens attended the event (including 1 member of the\nmember of the general public). The event was held at a local\ncommunity center and there was no charge for attendance.\nThe symposium was approximately 3 hr in length.\nResearchers began with six, 15-min presentations in which\nSuleman et al. 3\nthey shared the scope and findings of recent research on\nolder adult rehabilitation. After the presentations, attendees\nmoved to round tables to work in groups of 8 to 10 people.\nThe group members discussed their views on research priori-\nties, as well as potential barriers and facilitators of rehabilita-\ntion research with older adults, using guiding questions (see\nFigure 1). Each group nominated a scribe who wrote\nresponses to the guiding questions. After answering each of\nthe guiding questions, each small group had a spokesperson\nwho shared their responses in a large group discussion. Each\ngroup's written responses were collected at the end of the\nsymposium and then summarized according to guiding\nquestion.\nAt the completion of the event, participants were asked to\ncomplete individual rating forms related to the usefulness of\nthe KTNE symposium on a scale of 0 (of no use) to 10 (very\nuseful), and provide written feedback on the event.\nResults\nParticipant Perspectives on Rehabilitation\nResearch\nPriorities for rehabilitation research.Participant groups were\nasked to create a list of important research topics relevant to\nolder adults and subsequently identify three priority areas\nfrom the list they generated (Figure 1). Collectively, the\ngroups generated more than 20 areas of priority for research\nincluding research related to specific populations of older\nadults (i.e., Aboriginal people), diagnosis groups (e.g.,\nstroke, dementia), and symptoms (e.g., independence, resil-\nience, quality of life, sleep, pain management and bariatric\ncare). Transportation and driving were also reported as top\npriorities for research, as were health service issues such as\nfactors that would support patient adherence with treatment\nprograms, discharge planning, and falls prevention pro-\ngrams. Other categories of research priorities were as\nfollows:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Seniors' social participation in leisure/community\nactivities (accessibility and engagement)\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Health management outcomes and measurement\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Building physical environments to meet seniors'\nneeds\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Nutrition/hydration issues\nBarriers to rehabilitation research with older adults.Numerous\nbarriers related to the research process were identified,\nincluding complexity of aging and research topics (i.e., one\nparticipant wrote \"It [aging] is a huge multifactorial area\"),\nthe multidisciplinary nature of rehabilitation research in\nolder adults, and difficulty measuring outcomes. Others per-\nceived barriers were limited research funding for rehabilita-\ntion research for older adults, lack of public interest to\nFigure 1. Questions for guided participant discussions organized by topic.\n4 SAGE Open\nsupport such research, and the perception that few research-\ners seemed interested in conducting studies with older adults.\nParticipants acknowledged that research with older adults\nrequires extensive investments of effort and time by research-\ners, administrative and clinical staff in health care, and com-\nmunity contexts. They highlighted a lack of time for\nclinicians to partner in research; \"How can clinicians partici-\npate in research/data collections with already heavy work-\nloads?\" Participants stated that their priorities for study\ndiffered from the priorities of researchers.\nParticipants also identified difficulties that they thought\nwere common in research involving older adults with health\nand rehabilitation needs, such as recruiting individuals for\nresearch, obtaining informed consent, understanding the\ninfluence of diverse cultural backgrounds in the research\nprocess, varying literacy levels, the presence of multiple\ncomorbid health conditions, and increased risk of mortality\ncompared with other groups. Finally, attitudinal barriers\nrelated to the aging population such as stereotyping and pub-\nlic misperceptions were reported; \"they're going to fall any-\nway\" and \"it's a part of normal aging.\"\nPotential solutions to barriers. Participants were asked to iden-\ntify solutions to ameliorate the barriers they identified. Par-\nticipants suggested that improving the quality and quantity\nof collaboration between researchers and health care provid-\ners/service providers could be a key strategy to overcome\nbarriers to research with older adults. Participants stated that\nimproved KT, through sessions such as the symposium,\nwould be an effective approach to promoting collaboration.\nParticipants also identified the need to obtain funding for\nresearch projects as a solution to cost-related barriers. Finally\nparticipants recommended improving public awareness\nthrough advocacy movements and more involvement of stu-\ndents in rehabilitation research for older adults during their\ntraining programs.\nParticipant Feedback on the Symposium.Thirty-four partici-\npants provided numerical ratings of the usefulness of the\nsymposium, and 23 participants provided written comments.\nThe median of the scores of participants' ratings of the use-\nfulness of the symposium on a scale of 0 (no use) to 10 (very\nuseful) was 7 (mode = 8). Written feedback was positive and\nconstructive, for example, \"I think sessions like this will pro-\nvide the link between research and practice.\" Participants\nalso indicated that information presented was relevant:\n\"Loved the research updates--brief, concise, applicable to\nour population.\"\nOther Outcomes: Engagement. Attendees were invited to sign\nup to the Special Interest Group on Aging's online database\nof stakeholders who wished to be informed about opportuni-\nties to be involved in identifying, developing, implementing\nand using research that matters to older adults. The invitation\nto join the database was provided on professionally printed\npostcards that briefly explained the special interest group,\nthe purpose of the database, and provided the URL link to the\nregistry. Attendees were encouraged to take and distribute\nextra postcards to their own networks. Of the 88 KTNE event\nparticipants, 32 joined the database to act as stakeholders in\nolder adult rehabilitation research. Since the KTNE event,\nmore than 50 other individuals have joined the database.\nMost of the registered stakeholders are health care\nproviders.\nDiscussion\nFindings from this preliminary citizen engagement and\nknowledge translation symposium were encouraging and\nmembers of the Special Interest Group on Aging are plan-\nning to continue with other KTNE symposia across the prov-\nince of Alberta. The findings from this study provided\nresearchers with knowledge of specific issues of rehabilita-\ntion and aging from a citizen perspective, thus extending the\nfindings of the CIHR Regional Seniors' Workshops on\nResearch. This current KTNE symposium was attended by\nmany people from a variety of backgrounds (health care stu-\ndents, health care providers, researchers, service providers).\nHowever, members of the public and seniors were largely\nabsent from this event, which is a limitation of the current\nstudy. Future symposia will include modifications to ensure\na breadth of stakeholders, including members of the general\npublic. For example, advertising for the event could be con-\nducted with guidance from communications and media\nexperts, using strategies such as more frequent event notices\nover longer periods of time and the use of a variety of media\noutlets, including print newspapers and weekly news bulle-\ntins/publications for older adults. Also, family members/care\npartners of older adults may be more likely to attend if care\nprograms were provided for older adults who could not stay\nalone while family members attended the symposium. Future\nsymposia will also focus on specific issues of rehabilitation\nand aging as identified by the participants from this KTNE\nsymposium (e.g., falls prevention).\nIn subsequent events, researchers may also collect data on\nthe effectiveness of such gatherings in meeting the goals of\ncitizen engagement in research. Data collected may also be\nused to compare responses on research priorities for older\nadults on the basis of stakeholder group affiliation (i.e., older\nadults, health care providers, policy makers). The format of\nthe event may also be changed to ensure a wide reach to\naudiences in different geographical locations. Because it is\nnot practical, nor cost-effective, to have several researchers\ntravel to multiple rural and/or remote locations, the Special\nInterest Group on Aging is planning to develop prerecorded,\nmultimedia presentations. These will be presented to audi-\nences across the province of Alberta. Two trained facilitators\nwill attend each of the sessions and guide the postpresenta-\ntion small group discussions. The Special Interest Group on\nAging will also be able to provide continuity between KTNE\nSuleman et al. 5\nsymposia so as to better understand the scope of issues aris-\ning across the province. This model is a relatively low-cost\nstrategy to maximize opportunities for older adults and fam-\nily members outside of large urban settings to have access to\nup-to-date research knowledge and provide input regarding\nfuture studies.\nConclusion\nAt the University of Alberta, a group of researchers inter-\nested in rehabilitation research in aging developed and\nimplemented a citizen engagement symposium. The event\nwas well attended although the diversity of citizens who\nattended the event was limited. Attendees provided research-\ners with feedback on issues in rehabilitation research for\nolder adults, including priority topics for research and dis-\ncussion at future symposia. Continued refinement and testing\nof this promising event will be the focus of upcoming citizen\nengagement endeavors.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nBoote, J.
