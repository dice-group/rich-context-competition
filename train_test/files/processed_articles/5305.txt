    "abstract": "Abstract\nQuestions about climate change elicit some of the widest political divisions of any items on recent U.S. surveys. Severe\npolarization affects even basic questions about the reality of anthropogenic climate change (ACC), or whether most scientists\nagree that humans are changing the Earth's climate. Statements about scientific consensus have been contentious among\nsocial scientists, with some arguing for consensus awareness as a \"gateway cognition\" that leads to greater public acceptance\nof ACC, but others characterizing consensus messaging (deliberate communication about the level of scientific agreement)\nas a counterproductive tactic that exacerbates polarization. A series of statewide surveys, with nationwide benchmarks,\nrepeated questions about the reality of ACC and scientific consensus many times over 2010 to 2016. These data permit tests\nfor change in beliefs and polarization. ACC and consensus beliefs have similar trends and individual background predictors.\nBoth rose gradually by about 10 points over 2010 to 2016, showing no abrupt shifts that might correspond to events such as\nscientific reports, leadership statements, or weather. Growing awareness of the scientific consensus, whether from deliberate\nmessaging or the cumulative impact of many studies and publicly engaged scientists, provides the most plausible explanation\nfor this rise in both series. In state-level data, the gap between liberal and conservative views on the reality of ACC did not\nwiden over this period, whereas the liberal\u00adconservative gap regarding existence of a scientific consensus narrowed.\n",

Reports from the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; 2013)\nbring much of this evidence together. National science acad-\nemies, and organizations representing hundreds of thousands\nof scientists, have issued their own statements or reports on\nthe risks of anthropogenic climate change (ACC; National\nAeronautics and Space Administration [NASA], 2016).\nDirect surveys of scientists find levels of agreement on the\nreality of ACC ranging from 87% among American\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science members gen-\nerally, to 93% among working PhD Earth scientists (Pew\nresearch scientists (Anderegg, Prall, Harold, & Schneider,\nlished research similarly report high-90s agreement on the\nSynthesizing recent studies, Cook et al. (2016) observe that\nthe level of consensus rises with expertise of the scientists\nconsidered: Agreement is strongest among the most active\nresearchers.\nIn contrast to the overwhelming consensus among scien-\ntists, acceptance of ACC remains stubbornly lower among\nthe U.S. public--until recently, polling mostly in the mid-\n50s on surveys (e.g., Hamilton, Hartter, Lemcke-Stampone,\nMoore, & Safford, 2015; Leiserowitz, Maibach, Roser-\nRenouf, Feinberg, & Rosenthal, 2015). Similar fractions of\nthe public concede a scientific consensus on the reality of\nACC. Individual perceptions that ACC is real, and that most\nscientists agree on this point, correlate with each other and\nhave similar background predictors (e.g., Hamilton & Saito,\n2015), to such an extent they could be two indicators for one\nunderlying dimension (Kahan, 2015a; Kahan, Jenkins-\nSmith, & Braman, 2011). Other researchers have argued that\ntheir correlation reflects causality. According to this view,\n1University of New Hampshire, Durham, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLawrence C.

Experimentally, consensus\nmessaging or providing information about the extent of sci-\nentific agreement can increase subsequently expressed\nacceptance of ACC (Lewandowsky, Gignac, & Vaughan,\nLeiserowitz, Feinberg, & Maibach, 2015; van der Linden,\nLeiserowitz, & Maibach, 2016). Some analyses of survey\nquestions about consensus and climate report findings con-\nsistent with this gateway role (Ding, Maibach, Zhao, Roser-\nRenouf, & Leiserowitz, 2011; McCright, Dunlap, & Xiao,\nExperimental and survey approaches have complementary\nstrengths and limitations. Experiments can show that certain\nresponses change after exposure to information, which pro-\nvides good evidence for causality in that context, but does not\nanswer how effects scale up over longer periods in uncontrolled\nsocial environments where contrary information is abundant.\nNon-experimental surveys sample views from such uncon-\ntrolled environments, but provide mainly indirect evidence\nabout causality. The gateway and same-dimension hypotheses\nneed not be mutually exclusive, however. That belief in agree-\nment among scientists might in some instances or for some\npeople influence beliefs about ACC, whereas in other cases\nthey measure essentially the same thing, is quite plausible\nalthough analytically intractable.\nKahan (2016) takes a position against consensus messaging:\n\"All the `social marketing'of `scientific consensus'does is aug-\nment the toxic idioms of contempt that are poisoning our sci-\nence communication environment.\" In part, his view is based on\ndata in which public perceptions about the scientific consensus\nshow less polarization than perceptions about ACC itself. Also,\nthe degree of polarization (the gap between people with oppo-\nsite ideologies or worldviews) tends to be widest among those\nwith higher education or information by several measures. More\nbasically, he argues that there has been little movement in con-\nsensus or ACC perceptions despite \"a decades-long social mar-\nketing campaign\" to inform people (Kahan, 2015b).\nBut has there been recent movement on either question?\nIs polarization consistently rising? These questions are test-\nable with data from a lengthening time series of random-\nsample surveys covering one northeastern U.S. state since\n2010. The surveys carried two basic questions assessing pub-\nlic thoughts on the reality of ACC and agreement among sci-\nentists. Benchmarked by nationwide surveys that asked the\nsame questions, the statewide data provide unique temporal\nresolution for tracking change.\nSurvey Data\nSince spring of 2010, the Granite State Poll (GSP), run by the\nSurvey Center at the University of New Hampshire, has car-\nried the same basic climate-change question alongside its\nusual mix of political and other topics including science and\nenvironment.1 Table 1 gives the wording of the climate-change\nHamilton 3\nquestion (climate); the order of response choices is rotated by\ntelephone interviewers to avoid possible bias. One of these\nchoices--climate change is happening now, caused mainly by\nhuman activities--corresponds to the central point of many\nstatements by scientific organizations (e.g., the first sentence\ninAmerican Geophysical Union [AGU], 2013).As of summer\nviews in 26 New Hampshire surveys, plus a similar number of\ninterviews in other regional or national surveys (Hamilton\nA second question with parallel wording (consensus) asks\nwhether respondents think most scientists agree that climate\nchange is happening now, caused mainly by human activi-\nties. This question appeared on 11 of the New Hampshire\nsurveys. Table 1 gives probability-weighted response per-\ncentages for climate and consensus from the most recent year\nof New Hampshire surveys (2016), and for comparison also\nthe same questions on the U.S. nationwide Polar,\nEnvironment, and Science (POLES) survey conducted in\nage, gender, education, and ideology are summarized for\nboth surveys as well.\nFigure 1 graphically compares the climate and consensus\nresponses. Sixty-three percent of both New Hampshire and\nU.S. respondents think that climate change is happening\nnow, caused mainly by human activities; and 64% or 66%\nthink that most scientists agree on this point. The visual simi-\nlarity between climate and consensus beliefs is striking, and\nits implication of substantial overlap is true. Of those who\nthink that climate change is happening now, caused mainly\nby human activities, 85% (New Hampshire) or 86% (United\nStates) also think that most scientists agree on this point.\nHow representative are the New Hampshire data? In\nterms of the overall percentages, Figure 1 suggests they are\nclose. Hamilton et al. (2015) show overlapping confidence\nintervals across a larger set of New Hampshire and national\nsurveys that asked the same climate question. A Gallup sur-\nvey in March 2016, with differently worded questions, pro-\nvides another national benchmark: 59% \u00b1 4% believe the\neffects of global warming have already begun and 65% \u00b1 4%\nbelieve that increases in global temperatures over the past\ncentury are due more to human activities than to nature (Saad\n& Jones, 2016). Although mildly inconsistent with each\nother, either Gallup result roughly agrees with the 63% \u00b1 2%\nof New Hampshire respondents choosing now/human. Both\nGallup percentages in 2016 were the highest for at least 8\nPOLES survey likewise is notably higher than on national\nNew Hampshire results conform to a similar pattern, with\n2016 percentages that are highest in the 7-year history of this\nquestion.\nFigure 1. Response to climate-change and scientific-agreement questions on New Hampshire and U.S. nationwide surveys in 2016.\nNote. DK/NA = Don't know/no answer.\n4 SAGE Open\nFrom these comparisons and others, it appears that New\nHampshire provides a usable proxy, giving similar-to-national\noverall percentages on climate issues although generally\nwider-than-national divisions by political party (Hamilton\net al., 2015). The regional scope of the New Hampshire sur-\nveys is a limitation, but they also have strengths: sharper\n(quarterly) temporal resolution than national counterparts,\nwith consistent frames, wording, and methods under the same\ninvestigators throughout the whole series.\nChanging Views on Climate and\nConsensus\nFigure 2Agraphs the percentage of now/human responses to cli-\nNew Hampshire survey and the August 2016 U.S. POLES sur-\nvey form the two rightmost data points in Figure 2A.

For the New Hampshire\ntime series, Figure 2B breaks down the percentage of now/\nhuman responses to climate by ideology, on a 5-point scale\nfrom liberal to conservative.2 Percentages based on the\nsmaller subsamples forming each ideological category exhibit\nmore random variation, but show a persistently wide gap\nbetween conservatives and liberals. Figure 2B visualizes the\nstrong polarization of climate-change responses in surveys.\nFigure 2. Percentage who think climate change is happening now, caused mainly by human activities.\nNote.

It bears emphasizing that this consensus ques-\ntion asks whether respondents think that most scientists agree\nabout the existence of ACC, not about all of its details where\nscientific disagreements and new advances naturally occur.\nveys for New Hampshire, along with the NCERA, IME, and\nPOLES national surveys), the consensus results in Figure 3\ngenerally resemble those for climate in Figure 2. There is an\nuneven upward drift of roughly 10 points overall (Figure 3A).\nAgain, the confidence intervals of New Hampshire results\noverlap with those of contemporary national surveys. The lib-\neral\u00adconservative gap in Figure 3B is slightly narrower than\nthat in Figure 2B: Beliefs about agreement among scientists are\nmarginally less polarized than beliefs about ACC itself.\nIndividual Background and Ideology Effects\nIn Figures 2 and 3, climate and consensus beliefs exhibit\nsimilar patterns of slow upward drift. To test formally\nwhether the percentage accepting ACC or recognizing agree-\nment among scientists has risen, we can include year in a\nstandard regression framework that has been widely used to\nmodel individual-level predictors of climate beliefs.\nTable 2 gives results from weighted logit regression of\nclimate and consensus on respondent age, sex, education,\nand ideology (questions and coding defined in Table 1).3\nModels 1 and 2, based on New Hampshire data, also test for\nusing data from all 26 New Hampshire surveys that carried\nthe climate question (estimation sample, n = 14,265),\nwhereas Model 2 employs only the 11 surveys that asked the\nconsensus question (estimation sample, n = 5,313). Models 3\nand 4 give results from the POLES survey for a national\ncomparison (2016 only). The fit of each model is summa-\nrized by probability-weighted versions of the count R2 and\nadjusted count R2 statistics described in Long and Freese\nInteraction effects involving education and ideology have\nbeen detected in many survey and experimental data sets.\nTheir common form is that ideological divisions regarding\nclimate change widen with education, such that the best edu-\ncated partisans stand the farthest apart. This occurs not only\nwith education but also with other information indicators\nsuch as self-assessed understanding, or more objective tests\nFigure 3. Percentage who think most scientists agree that human activities are changing the climate.\nNote. Plotted by median interview date on three U.S. and 11 New Hampshire surveys (A); and separated by ideology on the New Hampshire surveys\n(B).

It occurs also whether ideology is indicated by\nrespondent's self-identification on a liberal to conservative\nscale, political party, religiosity, or more elaborate measures\nKeim, Garland, & Hamilton, 2014). Finally, such interac-\ntions affect some non-climate views too--for example,\nregarding evolution, vaccines, scientists, or environmental\nprotection in general (e.g., Hamilton, Colocousis, & Duncan,\nThe models in Table 2 fit reasonably well (adjusted count\nR2 from 18%-34%) and confirm that climate-change and\nconsensus beliefs have mostly the same individual-level pre-\ndictors. Coefficients shown are odds ratios, or multiplicative\neffects on the odds of thinking that humans are changing the\nclimate (climate = 1) or that most scientists agree (consensus\n= 1). The odds of thinking that humans are changing the cli-\nmate, or that most scientists agree on this, decline with age.\nWomen more often than men accept that humans are chang-\ning the climate, but gender makes little difference in percep-\ntions of the scientific consensus. Odds ratios significantly\nabove 1.0 for the main effect of education indicate that\namong moderate respondents (ideology = 0), the odds of\naccepting ACC, or that scientists agree, increase with higher\neducation. Odds ratios below 1.0 for the main effect of ideol-\nogy indicate that among respondents with technical school or\nsome college education (education = 0), the odds of accept-\ning ACC, or that scientists agree, decline as ideology\nbecomes more conservative.\nFigure 4 visualizes the New Hampshire education \u00d7 ide-\nology interaction effects, which are significant and similar in\nthe U.S. POLES data as well. These adjusted marginal plots\nintervals. Their right-opening megaphone shapes resemble\nthose found in many studies cited above. Here, we see that\namong liberals and moderates, the probability of thinking\nthat humans are changing the climate, or that most scientists\nagree on this point, rises with education. Among moderately\nconservative respondents, however, education has virtually\nno effect. Among the most conservative, belief that humans\nare changing the climate or that most scientists agree declines\nwith higher education.\nViewing plots of this general type, some analysts have\nconcluded that information itself causes polarization. Given\nthe occurrence of similar patterns with diverse information\nor education indicators, however, it seems more plausibly\nattributed to general processes of biased assimilation\n(Corner, Whitmarsh, & Xenias, 2012; McCright & Dunlap,\nDarmofal, 2005), and related concepts (Campbell & Kay,\nVedlitz, 2007). Better educated or informed individuals more\nactively acquire information, which sometimes involves fil-\ntering to support ideological beliefs. In reactions to experi-\nmental scenarios, such processes might appear left/right\nsymmetrical, with opposite bias affecting both ends of the\nspectrum. In practice, however, it is much easier to find top-\nics (such as climate or evolution) where liberal and moderate\nviews align with a major scientific consensus, whereas con-\nservatives oppose it, rather than the reverse. A corresponding\nasymmetry appears in survey findings that liberals and mod-\nerates express greater trust than conservatives regarding sci-\na source of information in specific domains including not\nonly climate and evolution but also vaccines, nuclear power\nsafety, and genetically modified organisms (Hamilton, 2015;\nTable 2. Ideology, Background Characteristics, and Year of Survey as Predictors of Climate-Change and Scientific-Agreement\nResponses (Variables Defined in Table 1).\nModel\nPredictor 1. NH Climate 2. NH Consensus 3. U.S. Climate 4. U.S. Consensus\nNote. Odds ratios from weighted logistic regressions using NH or national POLES (U.S.) survey data. NH = New Hampshire; POLES = Polar,\nEnvironment, and Science.\nHamilton 7\nTime plots in Figures 2A and 3A suggest that public\nacceptance of ACC and a scientific consensus have drifted\nupward over the past 7 years. Models 1 and 2 in Table 2 test\nthis hypothesis by including survey year along with respon-\ndent characteristics among the predictors. Both find signifi-\ncant (p < .001) positive effects. The odds of thinking that\nhuman activities are changing the climate increased about\n6% (multiplied by 1.06) per year over this period, whereas\nthe odds of thinking that most scientists agree increased\nsomewhat faster, by about 9% per year. If awareness of the\nscientific consensus acts as a gateway cognition, then we\nmight expect acceptance of ACC to change a bit more slowly\nas it seems to do here.\nTrends in Polarization\nThe New Hampshire analysis agrees with national reports\nthat public belief in the reality of ACC, and of a scientific\nconsensus on this point, have recently risen (Saad & Jones,\n2016). There also is evidence that national polarization con-\ncurrently increased (Dunlap, McCright, & Yarosh, 2016), but\nin New Hampshire, it appears to have decreased. Figure 5\nquantifies polarization as the distance between climate views\nof liberal and conservative respondents, or between those of\nmoderately liberal and moderately conservative respondents.\nGraphed points correspond to distances from lowest to high-\nest lines (or from second lowest to second highest) in Figure\n2B. Averaged by simple regression in the graph, the liberal/\nconservative gap narrows slightly, and not significantly, from\n66 to 58 points. The moderately liberal/moderately conserva-\ntive gap remains unchanged at about 36.\nFigure 6 performs a similar analysis addressing the more\ncontentious (among researchers) issue of polarization about\nthe scientific consensus. In this case, both trend lines show\nmild but statistically significant narrowing, by about 10\npoints, of the gap between liberals and conservatives. Thus,\nour New Hampshire time series indicate that contrary to\nnational trends (Dunlap et al., 2016), polarization regarding\nACC did not increase over this period, and regarding the sci-\nentific consensus it clearly declined.\nAlthough trends in ideological polarization are inconsis-\ntent, national and state data agree that overall public accep-\ntance of ACC and consensus has been rising through small\ngains across the ideological spectrum. Whether ideological\ndivisions have decreased from high levels (as in New\nHampshire), or increased from somewhat lower levels (as\nnationally), they remain presently quite wide. Ideological\nindicators dominate the variation in individual views, and\nideology moderates effects from education, otherwise the\nsecond most important background predictor.\nFigure 4. Interaction of education and ideology affecting respondents' beliefs about the reality of ACC (A), and whether most scientists\nagree on this reality (B).\nNote. Adjusted marginal plots based on Models 1 and 2 in Table 2. ACC = anthropogenic climate change; NH = New Hampshire.\n8 SAGE Open\nDiscussion\nThe scientific case for ACC was well developed before these\nsurveys began (Weart, 2008), with evidence from many disci-\nplines that seemed persuasive to most scientists (Oreskes,\n2004). Incremental advances have continued over the past 7\nyears, but from a public perspective, the contributions of indi-\nvidual studies are hard to judge, and prominent new studies are\nquickly dismissed with scientific-sounding counterarguments\nfrom contrarians (Dunlap & McCright, 2015). Recognizing\nFigure 5. Liberal\u00adconservative and moderately liberal\u00admoderately conservative gap on acceptance of ACC, 26 New Hampshire surveys\nNote. ACC = anthropogenic climate change.\nFigure 6. Liberal\u00adconservative and moderately liberal\u00admoderately conservative gaps on whether most scientists agree, 11 New\nHamilton 9\nthat the general public has limited ability to evaluate research,\nor weigh contradictory but scientific-sounding claims, a grow-\ning number of science organizations and individual scientists\nengaging with the public have moved to emphasize the extent\nof scientific agreement (consensus messaging). This is meant\nas a useful heuristic to help non-scientists sort through com-\npeting claims, without asserting that whatever scientists agree\nupon must be true--broad agreement on the reality of ACC\nreflects scientists'own evaluations of the evidence, rather than\nbeing evidence for climate change in itself.\nSome commentators have proposed that people acknowl-\nedge a scientific consensus, while rejecting the reality of ACC,\nbecause they think most scientists are not credible--and that\nthis group of doubters is growing.Accusations of hoax and con-\nspiracy fuel such a narrative (Dunlap & McCright, 2015;\nLewandowsky, Gignac, & Oberauer, 2013), although the parti-\nsan sources making those accusations tend also to deny the exis-\ntence of a scientific consensus, painting climate research instead\nas the project of relatively few individuals and organizations.4\nIn terms of background characteristics, however, survey\nrespondents who say they think that ACC is not happening,\nbut also think most scientists agree that it is (i.e., respond\nclimate = 0 but consensus = 1) resemble an unsure and pos-\nsibly transitional group, rather than committed believers. In\nseveral data sets, those with mixed views tend to be some-\nwhat younger, less educated, and more likely to identify as\nmoderate or liberal, compared with more \"consistent\"\nrespondents who reject both ACC and consensus (i.e., cli-\nConclusion\nTracked by a series of closely spaced statewide surveys (bench-\nmarked by nationwide surveys), public acceptance of the real-\nity of ACC and of scientific agreement rose gradually from the\nacceptance ofACC and consensus both increased is compatible\nwith the proposition that implicitly or explicitly communicat-\ning evidence of agreement among scientists encourages public\nacceptance of ACC itself. It appears incompatible with the\nreverse, that communicating evidence of scientific agreement\ncould depress overall public acceptance of ACC.\nAt the individual level, perceptions regarding the reality\nof ACC and consensus have similar background predictors.\nIdeology is the strongest of these predictors. Moreover, ideo-\nlogical differences on ACC and consensus tend to be greatest\namong respondents with higher education. Over 2010 to\n2016, the gap between consensus perceptions of liberals and\nconservatives decreased in New Hampshire, although it\nincreased nationwide, and in both cases remains large.\nHas deliberate or incidental communication reinforcing\npublic awareness of the scientific consensus helped to shift\npeople's views, or raised acceptance ofACC itself? Our survey\nresults cannot establish causality. But given the lack of visible\nimpacts from events, cumulative efficacy in communicating\nthe scientific consensus appears a plausible explanation for\ngradually rising public acceptance of the reality of ACC.\nAlthough public acceptance of ACC rose over the years\nstudied, it remains well below the level of agreement among\nscientists. Public concern also has not translated into voting\nbehavior because parties have become social identities in the\nUnited States. People's social commitment to keeping the\nother party from power overcomes the mixture of views they\nmight hold on particular issues (Dunlap et al., 2016; Mason,\n2015). Our findings give encouragement but no cause for\ncomplacency among scientists engaged with the public; if\npublic engagement has had some success, it still has a long\nway to go. And public opinion, unlike melting ice sheets, can\nreverse course very quickly. Future surveys in this series will\ncontinue monitoring, for good or bad news.\nAuthor's Note\nOpinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations in this\narticle are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the\nviews of supporting agencies.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nClimate questions on the Granite State Poll have been supported by\na grant from the National Science Foundation (New Hampshire\nand the Sustainability Institute at the University of New Hampshire.\nSupport for the POLES survey was provided by the PoLAR\nPartnership grant from the National Science Foundation (DUE-\nsurvey was supported by a grant from the Ford Foundation.\nNotes\n1.

It has proven to be a\ncapable platform for basic research (e.g., Hamilton, 2012).\n2. The GSP asks respondents to place themselves on a 9-point scale\nfrom extremely liberal (1) to extremely conservative (9), with mod-\nerate (leaning neither way) in the center (5). Detailed analysis finds\nthat in practice, some of these are not very different. For example,\nthe distinction between moderate, leaning a little more toward the\nconservative side (6 on the scale where 5 is simply moderate) and\nsomewhat conservative (7) does not seem to be sharp in many\npeople's minds, judging by the similar answers these two groups\ngive to other questions. We obtain more consistently interpretable\nresults using a simpler scheme with five categories: liberal (origi-\nnally 9 or 8), moderately liberal (7 or 6), moderate (5), moderately\nconservative (4 or 3), or conservative (2 or 1). People who say they\ndo not know or otherwise declined to answer the ideology question\n(about 7% of the total) do not appear to form a coherent group, so\nare set aside for analyses involving ideology.\n3. Some studies employ much longer lists of predictors, but\nthese often reduce precision (raise standard errors and reduce\nsample size) while showing inconsistent effects. In contrast,\nthe compact set of predictors used here has proven replicable\nacross dozens of independent data sets, often with agreement\nnot only on statistical significance but effect magnitudes (e.g.,\nodds ratios) as well. For example, Hamilton et al. (2015) apply\nthis general regression framework to the climate question\nasked in 35 separate surveys.\n4. Michael Mann (2013) characterizes the politically focused\nattacks on individual scientists (rather than large organiza-\ntions or disciplines that hold similar views) as a \"Serengeti\nstrategy,\" referencing the way African predators separate indi-\nvidual prey animals from the herd.\n5. Similar observations apply to the mirror-image group (about\nthe same size) who accept anthropogenic climate change\n(ACC) but do not think most scientists agree (climate = 1 and\nconsensus = 0). They likewise tend to be younger, less edu-\ncated, and more ideologically diverse than others who share\ntheir acceptance of ACC.\nReferences\nAklin, M., & Urpelainen, J. (2014).
