Pierce, Cancer Prevention and\nControl Program, University of California, San Diego, Cancer Center,\nThere is increased recognition that smoking behavior is\nstrongly influenced by the social environment (1). Thus,\ntobacco control efforts are now generally focused on entire\ncommunities in addition to the traditional approaches aimed\nat individuals. Community-based efforts generally take the\nform of comprehensive US state-level tobacco control pro-\ngrams (1\u00ad7). Such programs require careful evaluation so\nthat they can be improved and to justify the level of\nresources committed to them. Since evaluative efforts\ninvolve comparisons across states to account for secular\ntrends that occur independently of any specific program, an\nindex to rank states according to their tobacco control activ-\nity would be useful (8).\nComprehensive tobacco control programs include\nresources (both monetary and human) to employ a wide\nvariety of efforts aimed at influencing the social environ-\nment. These efforts include 1) working to educate the pub-\nlic (via paid mass media programs, public service announce-\nments, or media advocacy), 2) encouraging enactment of\nnew legislation or policies (to increase tobacco taxes, create\nsmoke-free workplaces, or regulate tobacco advertising), 3)\nfostering smoking cessation (by increasing awareness of and\naccess to existing programs or developing new cessation\nmethods or programs), and 4) advocating for increased\nenforcement of existing laws (including youth access laws\nor laws restricting smoking). The immediate results of these\ntobacco control efforts are what we have labeled \"initial out-\ncomes.\" These outcomes can be quantified and can serve as\nearly indicators of tobacco control efforts (8). Examples of\ninitial outcomes include greater population exposure to anti-\ntobacco messages or news coverage, increased tobacco\ntaxes, stronger laws for regulating smoking in public places,\nmore smokers receiving smoking cessation assistance,\nincreased compliance checks, and assessment of penalties to\nprevent illegal tobacco sales to minors or for violations of\nworkplace smoking restrictions. Initial outcomes can be\nviewed as the first steps along a continuum of change that\nultimately should result in reduced tobacco use by the gen-\neral population. To rank states according to these initial out-\ncomes requires uniform measures for each state, some assur-\nance that these outcomes can influence smoking behavior,\nand some variability in the measures among states.\nAppropriate measures currently are not available for all of\nthese initial outcomes. However, all states include tobacco\nexcise taxes in the retail price paid by the consumer, and\neach year the tobacco industry uniformly reports the price of\ncigarettes in each state to the Federal Trade Commission.\nThe average price per pack differs considerably among\nstates, and there is ample evidence that price affects smok-\ning behavior (9, 10). Community concern about the harmful\neffects of secondhand tobacco smoke has led to local and\nstatewide ordinances restricting smoking in public places as\nwell as in the workplace (11, 12). Adoption of workplace\nsmoking restrictions has not been uniform across all states\n(11, 12), but when these restrictions are in effect, they have\nbeen shown to modify smoking behavior (13\u00ad18). Concern\nabout the health consequences of secondhand smoke also\ncan lead to considerable pressure against exposure to smoke\nin one's personal environment (19). One form of this pres-\nsure is imposition of home smoking restrictions, and com-\nplete home smoking bans have also been associated with\nsmoking behavior (20). State-level measures of the propor-\ntion of the population working or living under smoking bans\nare available from the tobacco use supplement to the\nmeasures vary considerably. As standard measures become\navailable for other initial outcomes, they may also prove to\nbe candidates for inclusion in the index. For the present\nstudy, we focused on three initial outcomes: cigarette price,\nworkplace smoking bans, and home smoking bans.\nWe ranked the 50 US states and the District of Columbia\n(referred to in this paper as the 51 states) according to each\nof these three initial outcomes; in this paper, we report the\ncorrelation of each outcome with common measures of\nsmoking behavior: per capita cigarette consumption and\nsmoking prevalence. We also created z scores for the initial\noutcomes, summed each of the standardized variables to\nform an index, and correlated the resulting initial outcomes\nindex (IOI) with the smoking behavior measures. Finally,\nwe divided the 51 states into three groups determined by IOI\ntertiles and examined the group mean smoking prevalence\nand trends in per capita cigarette consumption.\nData sources\nCurrent Population Surveys. Data were gathered from\nMay 1993) that included a special supplement on tobacco\nuse. The US Bureau of the Census continuously conducts\nthe CPS to monitor the labor force, covering the civilian,\nnoninstitutionalized population of persons aged 15 years in\nthe United States (21). These household surveys select a\nstratified probability sample of clusters of households iden-\ntified from the Census Bureau and other sources (22). The\nCPS design calls for surveying about 56,000 households\neach month, and each household is part of a panel that is\ninterviewed eight times over a 16-month period. All respon-\n1993. About a quarter of the interviews were conducted in\nperson (first or fifth time in a panel); the remainder were\nconducted by telephone (second, third, fourth, sixth, sev-\nenth, or eighth time in a panel). Except for the tobacco use\nsupplement, for which every effort was made to interview\neach person aged 15 years residing in the household, one\nknowledgeable member responded for all others. To maxi-\nmize the proportion of self-respondents to the tobacco use\nsupplement, three attempts were made to reach each respon-\ndent, either in person or by telephone depending on the\nhousehold's panel order, before a proxy interview with\nanother household member was accepted (22). Response\nrates for the tobacco use supplement for eligible CPS\nSeptember, January, and May, respectively. Overall, 82 per-\ncent of supplement respondents for smoking status (preva-\nlence) were self-respondents.\nBecause the public-use data files for these three surveys\ninclude weighting variables for all respondents (n \ntion estimates could be determined. The weights are com-\nputed to be consistent with 1990 US Census totals based on\nstate population and are representative of the US population\nby gender, age, and race/ethnicity distributions. Persons for\nwhom data were missing (<1 percent) for smoking status\nwere omitted from the analysis.\nCigarette price. Each November, The Tobacco Institute\npublishes the weighted average price per pack of cigarettes\nfor each US state and the District of Columbia (23). The\nprice analyzed includes state and federal (but not local)\nexcise taxes and state (but not local) sales tax. The weight-\ning reflects the brand mix, whether the cigarettes were pur-\nchased by the pack or the carton, and the type of store in\nwhich the cigarettes were purchased. However, the weights\nare national rather than state specific. We did not attempt to\nadjust cigarette price by a cost-of-living indicator for each\nstate because there is no agreed-upon method for accom-\nplishing such an adjustment.\nCigarette sales. The Tobacco Institute also compiles\ndata and reports on tax payments from all packs of cigarettes\nremoved from wholesale warehouses to retail outlets within\neach state (24). The reporting unit is the number of cigarette\npacks on which taxes were paid in any given month. The\npresent analysis included data from February 1983 through\nMarch 1997. While consumption estimates obtained from\nthis source are subject to monthly and seasonal variations\nthat are business related rather than reflect variation in con-\nsumption patterns, these data are gathered uniformly across\nstates and are the usual source for estimates of national per\ncapita cigarette consumption. This data source is used by\nboth the US Surgeon General's Office for its reports on\nsmoking and health and by the US Department of\nMeasures of smoking behavior\nSmoking prevalence. CPS respondents were asked,\n\"Have you (or the person responded for) smoked at least\n100 cigarettes in your (his or her) entire life?\" Those with\n\"yes\" responses were considered ever smokers and were\nasked a second question: \"Do you (or the person responded\nfor) now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at\nall?\"\nWe computed the percentage of current smokers (defined\nas those who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime\nand indicated at the time of the survey that they smoked\neither every day or some days) among adults aged >24 years\nTobacco Control Initial Outcomes Index 729\nand also considered the percentage of current smokers\namong young people aged 15\u00ad24 years. Both self- and\nproxy reports of smoking status were included in the deter-\nmination of smoking prevalence.\nPer capita cigarette consumption. Changes in total ciga-\nrette sales within a state may not be related to changes in\nsmoking behavior if the population of that state has\nchanged. We estimated per capita consumption for a given\nstate in any given year by using US Bureau of the Census\nestimates for the state population aged 18 years. We fol-\nlowed the Surgeon General's age criterion of 18 years (9)\nbecause only about 1 percent of the cigarettes sold in the\nUnited States are smoked by people aged 18 years (26). We\nused decade US Census population data computed as of\nestimates computed as of July 1 of each year (27, 28). To\nobtain monthly estimates of state populations, we interpo-\nlated from regression lines fitted to the yearly census data.\nOur per capita consumption estimates were based on the\ntotal number of packs removed from wholesale warehouses\nin a given month divided by the population estimate for that\nmonth. Since retail outlets appear to stock up on cigarettes\nin the last month of both the fiscal and calendar years, we\npartially removed this source of variation by considering\nbimonthly averages (e.g., December/January, February/\nMarch). To further distinguish the underlying or deseasonal-\nized trends, we applied the SABL procedure (available in\nthe statistical package S-Plus) to the bimonthly data (29,\n30). As a point estimate of per capita cigarette consumption\nsumption for the 10-month period from August/September\nthe CPS tobacco use supplements.\nMeasures of tobacco control initial outcomes\nCigarette price. We used the mean of the weighted aver-\nage price of cigarettes for November 1992 and November\n1993 to adjust for price fluctuations during the period corre-\nsponding to the interval during which CPS data were col-\nlected. During this period, 16 states increased their tobacco\nexcise taxes (13\u00ad65 cents), and the federal excise tax on cig-\narettes increased by 4 cents on January 1, 1993. However, in\nmost states, the weighted average per-pack price of ciga-\nin November 1992 as a result of a tobacco industry price cut\nfor premium brands of cigarettes (31).\nWorkplace smoking bans. CPS tobacco use supplement\nself-respondents were asked, \"Which of these best describes\nthe area in which you work most of the time?\" A response\nindicating that the person worked indoors and outside the\nhome and was not self-employed led to a further question,\n\"Does your place of work have an official policy that restricts\nsmoking in any way?\" Those who answered \"yes\" were then\nasked, \"Which of these best describes your place of work's\nsmoking policy for work areas?\" and \"Which of these best\ndescribes your place of work's smoking policy for indoor pub-\nlic or common areas?\" Those who reported that smoking was\n\"not allowed\" (one of the response choices) in any work areas\nand was \"not allowed\" in any public areas were considered to\nbe covered by a workplace smoking ban. State workplace\nsmoking ban status was calculated as the percentage of self-\nrespondent ever smokers aged 15 years who were eligible to\nbe asked the questions regarding a workplace smoking ban.\nPercentage of ever smokers was used because smoking bans\nwould be more likely to influence current and former smokers\nthan never smokers. The only possible behavioral effect on\nnever smokers would be to prevent smoking uptake in some\nyoung people (aged 15\u00ad24 years) by making it difficult for\nthem to establish nicotine tolerance. Current smokers may\nmodify their smoking behavior in response to bans, and for-\nmer smokers may be less likely to relapse if they work where\nthey cannot smoke. Recent former smokers may also have\nquit in response to smoking bans.\nHome smoking bans. CPS tobacco use supplement self-\nrespondents were also asked about the existence of smoking\nrestrictions in their homes: \"Which statement best describes\nthe rules about smoking in your home?\"We considered a home\nsmoking ban to be in place if the respondent indicated that \"no\none is allowed to smoke anywhere.\" As defined for workplace\nsmoking bans, state home smoking ban status was taken as the\npercentage of self-respondent ever smokers aged 15 years\nthat reported a home smoking ban. Since all household persons\naged 15 years responded to the full tobacco use supplement,\ndiscrepant reporting was possible about the existence of a\nhome smoking ban. Although agreement concerning the exis-\ntence of a home smoking ban was high, it was not perfect.\nStatistical analysis\nFor each of the three index factors--cigarette price per\npack, workplace smoking bans among ever smokers, and\nhome smoking bans among ever smokers--we computed z\nscores for each of the 51 states. Next, we summed the z scores\nfor the three factors to form a tobacco control IOI and com-\nputed a Cronbach's alpha coefficient (32). The IOI was then\ncorrelated (Pearson's) with adult and youth smoking preva-\nlence and the point estimate of per capita cigarette consump-\ntion. Correlation coefficients were also computed for the\nindex component variable z scores among themselves and\nwith prevalence and the point estimate of per capita cigarette\nconsumption.\nFinally, we classified the states into three groups based on\ntertiles (n  17 each) of the IOI. Mean smoking prevalence\nand per capita cigarette consumption (from the point estimates\nfor each state) among the three groups of 17 states were com-\npared by using analysis of variance with correction for multi-\nple comparisons (two-tailed Bonferroni's method). As\ndescribed above, we also plotted the bimonthly raw per capita\neach tertile group along with the deseasonalized trends.\nRESULTS\nTobacco control IOI\nCigarette prices varied considerably among the 51 states;\nthey ranged from a high of 229.7 cents per pack in Hawaii to\na low of 147.6 cents per pack in Kentucky. The mean cigarette\ncentage of ever smokers living in households with a home\nsmoking ban varied more than threefold, from a high of 42.2\npercent in Utah to a low of 12.5 percent in Kentucky. The\noverall mean was 26.6 percent. Finally, the percentage of ever\nsmokers working in an indoor setting with reported work-\nplace smoking bans also varied by about a factor of 2.5, from\npercent in Kentucky; overall, the mean was 46.6 percent.\nWhen the z scores for all three factors (cigarette price per\npack, workplace smoking bans, home smoking bans) were\nsummed, Washington State had the highest IOI, indicating the\nmost evidence of tobacco control activity. California was a\nclose second, Utah was third (despite its relatively lower\naverage cigarette price), and Kentucky ranked by far the low-\nest. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the IOI was 0.78.\nTable 1 shows the correlations among the index factors' z\nscores that comprise the IOI and for each factor with adult\nsmoking prevalence, youth smoking prevalence, and the\npoint estimate of per capita cigarette consumption. The rel-\native level of ever smokers in each state who were indoor\nworkers with workplace smoking bans was highly corre-\nlated with the relative level of ever smokers with home\nsmoking bans. The correlations of these factors with ciga-\nrette price were not as strong. All three index factors showed\na significant relation to the outcome measures of adult\nsmoking prevalence and per capita cigarette consumption.\nHowever, the relations were weaker for youth smoking\nprevalence, and only the correlation of home smoking bans\nwith youth smoking prevalence was statistically significant.\nOf note is that price correlated highly with per capita ciga-\nrette consumption but less strongly with adult smoking\nprevalence.\nCorrelation of the IOI with prevalence and consumption\nThe IOI scores for the states were highly correlated with\nthe statewide prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults\nless well correlated with the prevalence of smoking among\nure 2). There was also a strong and significant relation\nbetween the IOI and the point estimate of per capita ciga-\nKentucky was omitted from the correlation analysis, the\ncorrelations of IOI with adult smoking prevalence, youth\nsmoking prevalence, and per capita cigarette consumption\nGrouping of states by IOI tertiles\nTables 2\u00ad4 show the US states in each of the three tertile\ngroups and the data used to determine the state z score, the\nresultant z score, and the final index, which is the sum of the\nz scores for each of the three factors. Also displayed are esti-\nmates of the prevalence of smoking in individual states\nmates of per capita cigarette consumption. At the bottom of\neach table is the mean value for each of the index factors and\nthe smoking behavior measures (refer to the Materials and\nMethods section).\nFigure 4 plots the state-specific estimates of smoking\nprevalence for adults (aged 25 years) in the states in each\ntertile group. The dashed line shows the overall prevalence\nestimate for this age group in the United States as 24.0 per-\ncent. The mean adult smoking prevalence was not signifi-\ncantly lower for the states in the highest IOI tertile (23.3 per-\ncent) compared with the prevalence over all states in the\nmiddle tertile (24.2 percent), but the smoking prevalence\nestimates for both the highest and middle tertile groups were\nsignificantly lower than the prevalence estimate for the low-\nest tertile group (26.9 percent). In the highest IOI group, the\nstate-specific smoking prevalence ranged from a high of\nsmoking prevalence estimates for five states in this group\nwere higher than the overall US prevalence estimate. In the\nmiddle group, prevalence ranged from a high of 29.1 per-\ncent in Nevada to a low of 21.4 percent in Massachusetts. In\n10 states in this group, the prevalence estimate was higher\nthan the overall US average. The state-specific prevalence in\nthe lowest group ranged from a high of 32.1 percent in\nKentucky to a low of 23.4 percent in Iowa. In 15 states in\nTABLE 1.

The mean adult smoking preva-\nlences for the highest and middle tertiles were significantly\ndifferent from that of the lowest tertile (overall analysis of\nvariance, followed by pairwise comparisons, p < 0.05).\nAs the relatively weak correlations in table 1 suggest, the\ntertile group means for youth smoking prevalence were not\nsignificantly different, and prevalence varied considerably\nwithin groups. For instance, in the lowest tertile group (table\n4), youth smoking prevalence ranged from a high of 26.4\npercent in West Virginia to a low of 14.1 percent in\nMississippi. California and Utah, both in the highest tertile\ngroup (table 2), were the only other two states whose youth\nsmoking prevalences were lower than that in Mississippi.\nThe prevalence for Maine, also in the highest tertile group,\nwas 25.5 percent, close to that for West Virginia.\nIn the highest tertile group, per capita cigarette consump-\ntion ranged from a low of 6.3 packs per month in Hawaii to\na high of 12.7 packs per month in Vermont, with a mean of\n9.1.

Between\nmiddle groups continued, but the downward trend for the\nlowest IOI group seemed to diminish. After 1994, the trend\nfor the lowest tertile group indicated an increase in con-\nsumption, the middle tertile group no longer showed a\ndownward trend, and the trend for the highest group was\nstill downward.\nDISCUSSION\nOur analyses indicate that tobacco control initial out-\ncomes are substantially and inversely correlated with smok-\ning prevalence and per capita cigarette consumption. It is\npossible that states that have a high level of tobacco control\nadvocacy produce initial outcomes that affect smoking\nprevalence and cigarette consumption, but it also may be the\ncase that states that have lower levels of prevalence and con-\nsumption are politically more able to advocate for tobacco\ncontrol policy that produces initial outcomes. The diverging\ntrends for tobacco consumption in the tertile groups deter-\ndata used in the correlation analysis, suggest that the level of\ninitial outcomes does influence final outcomes rather than\nvice versa. A more comprehensive time-series analysis that\naccounts for secular trend and population differences is\nneeded to demonstrate that initial outcomes lead to lower\nconsumption over time. Nonetheless, when one state is com-\npared with others in the evaluation of its tobacco control\nprogram, it would be important to know each state's IOI\nstanding.\nTABLE 3.

The multiple\ninterventions may exhibit some degree of synergy. For\ninstance, a smoker who works where smoking is banned\nmay be more likely to agree to a smoking ban at home.\nWhen additional standard and widely available measures for\ninitial outcomes become available, it is likely that they will\ncorrelate with these components and among themselves. It\nwill be important to keep the index parsimonious and add\nonly those variables that have been demonstrated to be\nrelated to smoking behavior and that vary considerably\namong the states. Other possible additional factors include\nassessment of actual state or local antitobacco legislation\nand a measure of exposure to antitobacco-related media (8).\nAlthough there were significant and strong correlations\nbetween both the IOI components and the overall index with\nper capita cigarette consumption and adult (aged 25 years)\nsmoking prevalence, only home smoking bans were corre-\nlated with smoking prevalence for young people aged\n15\u00ad24-years. The youth smoking prevalence estimates were\nless precise than the adult ones because of small state-level\nsample sizes. Also, proxy reports of smoking status for\nyounger people may be more likely to be in error, because\nmore people in this age group are occasional smokers (33).\nBoth of these factors may hinder detection of any underly-\ning relation that might exist between prevalence and work-\nplace smoking bans or cigarette price. The fact that only\nabout 16 percent of the younger people in our study were\nindoor workers further limited the possibility of detecting a\nrelation. The lack of a significant relation between price and\nyouth smoking prevalence is more difficult to explain. Most\nevidence of a price effect on youth smoking comes from\neconometric analyses of cross-sectional data (34\u00ad36). A\nnumber of research projects are currently investigating this\nissue further, some in the setting of multistate longitudinal\nstudies. Perhaps it will be essential that initial outcomes\nmore directly related to youth smoking, such as success in\nrestricting access or tobacco advertising and promotions,\nwill be required to develop a useful index for the younger\npopulation.\nWe considered using different definitions of tobacco con-\ntrol initial outcomes in the index. The amount of new state\nhave been a fairly direct measure of an initial outcome from\ntobacco control activity. However, the price data we used\nTABLE 4.

Dotted lines, bimonthly raw data; solid lines, deseasonalized trends obtained by applying the SABL procedure to the bimonthly data\nincluded both federal and state excise taxes and sales taxes.\nFurthermore, since the tobacco companies can manipulate\nthe price of cigarettes (31), tax increases may not always be\nreflected in cigarette price. The CPS data provided a rea-\nsonably accurate estimation of workplace smoking bans\nbased on workers' self-report of the types of smoking\nrestrictions at their workplace. In the future, information\nfrom the National Cancer Institute's State Cancer\nLegislative Database (12) could also be included; this data-\nbase would provide information concerning the type of state\nlegislation restricting workplace smoking in effect in each\nstate.\nInterestingly, as in previous analyses (37), current smok-\ners who worked indoors were less likely to report workplace\nsmoking bans (36 percent) than were former or never smok-\ners (both 49 percent). We repeated the entire analysis by\nconsidering all indoor workers, regardless of smoking sta-\ntus, and just current smokers (rather than ever smokers), and\nthe results were only slightly different. Another potential\ndefinitional problem was an inconsistency in the report of\nhome smoking bans. Reanalyzing the data (counting a report\nby an ever smoker of a home smoking ban only if all other\nadults in the home also reported the ban) did not improve the\ncorrelation of this variable with smoking prevalence.\nBecause both workplace and home smoking bans might be\nconsidered an indication of societal norms rather than a\ndirect influence on smoking behavior, home smoking bans\nwere also analyzed for the entire population, not just for\never smokers. Since there was a very high correlation (r \n0.96) between the two measures, the results changed only\nslightly. Finally, we examined the percentage of ever smok-\ners in each state with workplace and home smoking bans\ncomputed only for those aged 25 years, which would cor-\nrespond to the adult population considered in the present\nstudy; again, the results changed very little.\nAs one measure of smoking behavior, we used the num-\nber of packs of cigarettes removed from wholesale to retail\noutlets as a surrogate measure of per capita cigarette con-\nsumption. However, some cigarettes sold are probably never\nsmoked, and cigarettes that smokers acquire from other than\nretail outlets (e.g., military bases, Indian reservations, state\nor national cross-border smuggling) are not included.\nEconometric models could potentially account for the\nimpact of these and other factors (e.g., differences in state\ndemographic composition) on consumption (38), and such\nrefinements might improve the correlation of per capita con-\nsumption with the IOI. When the mean self-reported daily\ncigarette consumption for smokers included in the CPS was\nused instead of the sales data as a measure of cigarette con-\nsumption in each state, the correlation with the IOI was\nreported daily cigarette consumption and per capita con-\nsumption computed from the sales data were substantially\nthat smoking prevalence may vary among states more\nbecause of demographic factors than because of tobacco\ncontrol activity. However, a partial correlation analysis that\nadjusted for the state population percentages of females,\nTobacco Control Initial Outcomes Index 737\nAfrican Americans, and Hispanics and for median age\nchanged the results only slightly.\nDespite these potential limitations, the correlations\nbetween the tobacco control IOI and the adult smoking\nprevalence and per capita cigarette consumption are signifi-\ncant, fairly strong, and robust with respect to variations in\ndefinition and analysis. The observed trends in per capita\nconsumption (figure 5) support the hypothesis that those\nstates that have more tobacco control initial outcomes are\nreducing consumption more than states with lower levels of\nthese outcomes. It is interesting that tobacco-growing states\n(e.g., Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina,\nand West Virginia) were all included in the lowest tertile\ngroup, which suggests that if there is significant economic\ndependence on tobacco, there also may be more resistance\nto efforts to reduce tobacco use.\nWhether the IOI will be associated with changes in state-\nlevel adult smoking prevalence must await further data and\nanalyses. However, our findings that price was related more\nstrongly to per capita consumption than to adult smoking\nprevalence and that the correlation of the IOI with con-\nsumption was marginally greater than it was with preva-\nlence suggest that the relation of the IOI to declines in\nprevalence may be less strong than for consumption.\nSmokers may take many years to quit successfully (39) but\nrespond in the short term to tobacco control interventions by\nreducing their consumption (40).\nRanking of tobacco control activity by the IOI should,\nover time, prove useful in determining whether statewide\ntobacco control efforts are producing initial outcomes that\nshould eventually lead to reduced smoking. It is expected\nthat states with the relatively highest IOI scores will eventu-\nally see the greatest declines in smoking. Furthermore, low\nscores may provide an incentive for some states to adopt\nnew tobacco control measures.\n"
