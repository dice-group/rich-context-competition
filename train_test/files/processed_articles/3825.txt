These preferences may then reflect adaptations for selecting mates with\nhigh reproductive value (Fisher, 1930). Consistent with this proposal, several studies have\nreported positive correlations between attractive facial characteristics in women and\nmeasures of their physical health (see Gray and Boothroyd, 2012, for a recent review).\nCues to female reproductive value\nAdditionally, body characteristics that are particularly important determinants of women's\nbody attractiveness (e.g., their body mass index [Tov\u00e9e and Cornelissen, 2001; Tov\u00e9e,\nHancock, Mahmoodi, Singleton, and Cornelissen, 2002], waist circumference and breast\nsize [Jasi\u00e9nska, Ziomkiewicz, Ellison, Lipson, and Thune, 2004]) are also associated with\nhealth measures (Flegal, Kit, Orpana, and Graubard, 2013). Many researchers have\nsuggested that fertility may be a particularly important component of women's mate value\n(e.g., Gangestad and Thornhill, 2008; Grammer, Fink, Juette, Ronzal, and Thornhill, 2001,\nfor correlations between physical characteristics in women and fertility.\nTo date, the majority of studies that have investigated possible links between\nwomen's attractiveness and measures of their fertility have tested for changes in young\nadult women's attractiveness over the menstrual cycle (see Haselton and Gildersleeve,\n2011 for a recent review). For example, studies have found that men judge face\nphotographs (Puts et al., 2013; Roberts et al., 2004), recordings of women's voices (Bryant\n(Gildersleeve, Haselton, Larson, and Pillsworth, 2012; Havlicek, Dvorakova, Bartos, and\nobtained during the fertile (i.e., late follicular) phase of the menstrual cycle to be more\nattractive than those obtained during low-fertility phases. Studies of men's perceptions of\nthe facial and vocal attractiveness of women taking hormonal contraceptives did not find\nany of the above reported systematic differences across the menstrual cycle (see Alvergne\nand Lummaa, 2009, for a review), consistent with the proposal that these findings reflect\nassociations between fertility and attractiveness. Although it is unclear whether changes in\nwomen's attractiveness during the menstrual cycle necessarily reflect signals of women's\nfertility (see Thornhill and Gangestad, 2008 for discussion), they complement findings\nfrom other research that has linked between-subject differences in young adult women's\nfacial and body attractiveness to between-subject differences in their fertility, as estimated\nfrom measured hormone levels (face: Law-Smith et al., 2006; body: Jasi\u00e9nska et al., 2004).\nThe majority of research that investigated the relationship between women's\nattractiveness and fertility has done so in samples of young adult (i.e., college-aged)\nwomen. This emphasis on young adult women may be warranted because women's\nfecundity is generally highest between 18 and 25 years of age, at least in Western societies\n(Balasch, 2010; Wood, 1989). However, it is also clear that female fecundity is not limited\nto this life-stage but should rather be seen as a function of age (Pawlowski and Dunbar,\n1999), beginning at menarche and ending at menopause. This raises the question of\nwhether men's judgments of women's attractiveness are sensitive to these age-related\nchanges in fertility.\nThe current research explored this question by investigating whether men judge the\nattractiveness of faces, body odors, and voices from three different groups of women\n(young girls, adult women, and circum-menopausal women) to be significantly different\nfrom one another. Given the inverse J-shaped relationship between age and fecundity\n(Jones and Lopez, 2006), we hypothesized that face, odor, and voice stimuli collected from\ncircum-menopausal women would be judged to be less attractive than the other groups.\nSince previous work demonstrated that men's preferences for putative facial, olfactory, and\nCues to female reproductive value\nvocal fertility cues are correlated across modalities suggests that men respond to fertility\ncues in these domains in similar ways (Collins and Missing, 2003; Feinberg et al., 2005;\nFraccaro et al., 2011; Rikowski and Grammer, 1999; R\u00f6der, Fink, Feinberg, and Neave,\n2013; Saxton, Burriss, Murray, Rowland, and Roberts, 2009; Thornhill and Grammer,\n1999), we predicted similar patterns of results for men's judgments of women's facial,\nodor, and body attractiveness. In addition to investigating between-group differences in\nwomen's attractiveness, we also tested for between-group differences in men's perceptions\nof women's femininity. Since previous research suggests that femininity is an important\ndeterminant of women's attractiveness (Feinberg, DeBruine, Jones, and Perrett, 2008;\nPerrett et al., 1998), we predicted that analyses of men's ratings of women's femininity\nwould show a similar pattern of results to our analyses of men's ratings of women's\nattractiveness.\nMaterials and Methods\nFemale participants\nFacial photographs, body odors and voice recordings were collected from a total\nsample of 121 heterosexual women from three different age groups: young girls (n = 50;\nrecruited from the local population of G\u00f6ttingen (Germany) and all reported to be native\nGerman speakers. To control for possible effects of exogenous hormones on attractiveness,\nonly participants who reported not using any kind of hormonal contraceptive or\nsupplements at the time of data collection were recruited. All participants received 30 euros\nfinancial compensation.\nFacial photographs\nA digital image of the face in front-view was taken of each woman under\nstandardized light, from a fixed distance and with fixed focus, and against a constant black\nbackground. Images were captured using a 6.2-megapixel digital single-lens reflex camera\nTokyo, Japan) and stored in JPEG file format at a resolution of 3168 x 4752 pixels. The\nwomen were instructed to adopt neutral facial expressions and remove make-up, glasses\nand any other facial adornments (e.g., facial jewellery). All participants were asked to tie\nback their head hair with a black hair-band. In post-processing, faces were isolated from\nremaining other visible features (such as hair and the neck) by colouring these features\nblack in Adobe Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, USA). Finally, all digital\nimages were scaled to a resolution of 433 x 600 pixels for presentation in the rating\ncomponent of the study.\nBody odor samples\nWhite cotton T-shirts were used for body odor collection, following previous\nprotocols (e.g., Lenchova, Roberts, and Havlicek, 2009; Rikowski and Grammer, 1999;\nCues to female reproductive value\nSingh and Bronstad, 2001). Each participant received a number coded bag containing one\nunworn white, 100% cotton T-shirt, a box of unscented washing powder for washing\nclothes and bed sheets, and a bottle of unscented body soap and hair shampoo. All T-shirts\nwere washed with the same unscented washing powder before giving them to the\nparticipants and were then put into plastic zip bags immediately. Participants were\ninstructed to refrain from using perfume, engaging in sexual activity, sharing their bed with\nanother person (or their pet) for the three consecutive nights of wearing the T-shirt. They\nwere also instructed not to eat onions, garlic or spicy foods during this period. They were\nfurther instructed to wash their bed sheets and pillow covers with the unscented washing\npowder before the three nights of wearing the T-shirt. Participants were told to use the\nunscented soap and hair shampoo for bathing or showering each evening to assure similar\npersonal hygiene practices between participants. They were instructed to put the T-shirt\nback into the plastic bag each morning and take it out only before going to bed again. After\nthree nights, participants were told to put back the T-shirt into the plastic bag, seal it and\nkeep it in the freezer until their appointment with the experimenter. At this appointment,\nthe bags with the T-shirts were collected and kept frozen at -20\u00b0C until the body odor\nratings took place. We checked reported compliance with experimenter instructions using\nprotocols described in previous studies (Rikowski and Grammer, 1999; Singh and\nBronstad, 2001; Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999) by asking female participants after\ncompletion of the body odor sampling procedure (via a questionnaire) to report any\nviolations of the instructions, such as the use of perfume/deodorants, cigarette smoking,\nusage of provided unscented soap and shampoo. ANOVA statistics revealed that none of\nthe requested possible violations of the protocol had a significant effect on men's\nperceptions of female attractiveness and femininity (all F > .84, all p > .05).\nVoice recordings\nVoice recordings were collected with a unidirectional microphone (Rode NT1-A,\nwith phantom power and Rode SM6 pop filter), positioned approximately 10 centimetres in\nfront of the head of the participant, using computer software (Apple Logic Studio\u00ae; Apple\nInc. Cupertino, USA) and at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz with 16-bit amplitude. A digital\ninterface (M-AUDIO 8x8 Audio-/MIDI-Interface Fast Track\u00ae) was used to encode the\nrecording. Participants were requested to speak the five vowels (A [a], E [], I [i], O [o], U\n[u]) repeatedly and for one minute. To ensure a constant speech rate, the vowels were\npresented visually on a computer screen in front of them (via a video clip), one after the\nother, and in two seconds intervals. Participants were asked to speak each vowel when it\nwas presented on the screen. The serial order of the visual presentation of vowels changed\nsix times within one minute of presentation in order to avoid habituation effects. For the\nsubsequent rating study, a sequence of approximately nine seconds of the vowels I [i], E\n[], O [o], U [u], A [a] (in that order), was digitally isolated from the entire stream and\nsaved in MP3 audio format (Constant Bit Rate Mode, 128kbps).\nRating studies\nDigital facial photographs, body odor samples (via T-shirts) and voice recordings\nwere presented in three independent rating studies to a total sample of 450 male\nCues to female reproductive value\nattractiveness and femininity. All participants received 5 euros compensation for their time.\nFace and voice perceptions\nrated 24 facial photographs that were randomly selected out of the total sample, 12 of them\non attractiveness and another 12 on femininity. Attractiveness and femininity were rated in\nseparate blocks of trials and trial order was fully randomized. Another 150 men (age range\nrecordings on attractiveness and femininity using the same procedure. Medialab 2008\nsoftware (Empirisoft Inc., New York, USA) was used for face and voice presentation and\nratings were made on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all attractive/feminine to 5 = very\nattractive/feminine). For the assessments of voice recordings participants listened to the\nsamples using circum-aural earphones (Superlux HD681F). All voice recordings were set\nto constant amplitude, and participants were instructed to judge the voices spontaneously as\nthe samples were played only once before they were prompted to make a decision.\nBody odor perceptions\nwas recruited to judge the smell of 12 T-Shirts, randomly selected from the total sample,\nfor attractiveness and femininity. The T-shirt rating took place in separate sessions, over a\ntime period of three weeks. At each session, 12 T-Shirts were defrosted three hours before\nthe rating and put into 5 litre glass jars with clamp lids, numbered from 1 to 12 and judged\nby 10 participants. They were told to pick one jar after the other (the order differing\nbetween participants), shake it, open it and smell it without touching the T-Shirt, then rate\nthe smell of the T-Shirt for attractiveness and femininity on a 5-point scale (1 = not at all\nattractive/feminine to 5 = very attractive/feminine). Participants provided their ratings\nusing paper questionnaires that were placed next to each jar.\nResults\nA one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicated that the mean values of men's\nattractiveness and femininity ratings for women's faces, body odors and voices within each\nage group did not show a significant deviation from the normal distribution (all Z < 1.12,\nTo test for differences between mean values of men's judgements of women's\nfacial, olfactory and vocal attractiveness and femininity, a series of analyses of variance\n(ANOVA) was conducted. Separate analyses were carried out for each combination of\nrating type (attractiveness or femininity) and characteristic (face, body odor, or voice).\nMean ratings were the dependent variable and age group (young girls, adult women,\ncircum-menopausal women) was the factor.\nAnalyses showed a significant effect of age group for ratings of both facial\nCues to female reproductive value\n.007; Figure 1). For facial attractiveness, young girls received the highest attractiveness\ncircum-menopausal women (M = 1.43, SD = 0.34). Both, young girls and adult women\nwere judged to be significantly more attractive than circum-menopausal women (both p <\n.001), whereas the difference in attractiveness ratings between young girls and adult\nwomen was not quite significant (p = .06). For vocal attractiveness, adult women received\nhigher attractiveness ratings than did young girls and circum-menopausal women (adult\nwomen: M = 1.99, SD = 0.50), and attractiveness ratings for each of the three groups\ndiffered significantly from one another (all p < .01).\nFigure 1. Men's attractiveness judgements of young girls, adult women's and circum-\nmenopausal women's faces, body odors and voices.\nPairwise comparisons of body odor attractiveness ratings between the age groups\ndid not show any significant difference (all p = .99).\nThe ANOVAs for femininity ratings also showed a main effect of age group for\nof young girls received higher femininity ratings than those of adult women and circum-\nCues to female reproductive value\nFigure 2. Men's femininity judgements of young girls, adult women's and circum-\nmenopausal women's faces, body odors and voices.\nPairwise comparisons showed that femininity ratings of young girls' faces were\nsignificantly higher than those of adult (p < .05) and circum-menopausal women's faces (p\n< .001), but that adult women and circum-menopausal women did not differ in rated\nfemininity (p = .63). Analyses also showed that vocal femininity ratings of adult women\nwere higher than those of young girls and circum-menopausal women (adult women: M =\nSD = 0.66). Pairwise comparisons showed that femininity ratings of circum-menopausal\nwomen's voices were significantly lower than those of young girls' or adult women's\nvoices (both p < .001), but no significant difference between femininity ratings of young\ngirls' and adult women's voices (p = .91). Pairwise comparisons of body odor femininity\nratings between the age groups did not show any significant difference (all p > .05).\nFemale age was positively correlated with vocal attractiveness in the group of\nyoung girls (r = .49, p < .001) and negatively correlated with vocal attractiveness in the\ngroup of adult women (r = -.39, p < .05). The correlation between age and vocal\nattractiveness in the group of circum-menopausal women was not significant, however (r =\n.08, p = .69). Although female age was also positively correlated with facial attractiveness\nin the group of young girls (r = .31, p < .05), it did not predict facial attractiveness in the\ngroups of adult (r = .04, p = .81) or circum-menopausal (r = -.30, p = .12) women. Female\nage did not correlate with body odor attractiveness in any of the three groups (all absolute r\nCues to female reproductive value\nDiscussion\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the significance of women's faces,\nbody odors and voices as cues to age-related differences in female reproductive value. We\nstudied men's perceptions of the attractiveness and femininity of these features in three\ngroups of women: young girls, adult women, and circum-menopausal women. Our results\nshow that men judged the attractiveness and femininity of young girls and adult women to\nbe significantly higher than that of circum-menopausal women. However, we did not detect\nsignificant differences in attractiveness and femininity assessments of body odor among the\nthree groups of women. Thus, our results suggest that both women's faces and voices\nprovide cues to women's reproductive value, but also indicate that body odor may not\nnecessarily provide similar information about women's age-linked fertility. Moreover,\nthere were differences in regard to men's attractiveness and femininity perception of\nwomen's faces and voices, particularly for the group of young girls and adult women.\nYoung girls' faces were judged to be more attractive and feminine than those of adult\nwomen while adult women's voices were judged to be more attractive and feminine than\nthose of young girls. These latter results suggest that men's perceptions of women's vocal\nand facial attractiveness may be more closely tied to femininity than youth, per se (see also,\ne.g., Feinberg et al., 2008). Indeed, among the group of young girls, age was positively\ncorrelated with both facial and vocal attractiveness, suggesting more mature girls may be\njudged as more attractive.\nStudies of the role of facial, olfactory and vocal cues in human mate preferences\nand choice have suggested that certain features in women are particularly attractive to men\nbecause they signal aspects of women's phenotypic and genotypic condition (Grammer et\nal., 2003; Thornhill and Gangestad, 2008). Health and youth are considered to be the\npredominant qualities men employ in their assessment of female attractiveness and\nfemininity because of their link with fertility and reproductive value (Grammer et al., 2003;\nWood, 1989). Most evidence for this proposal has come from studies of young adult\nwomen (typically college-age students), although the hypothesis receives additional support\nfrom the medical literature on age-related changes in female endocrinology and the\nassociated decline of fecundity (e.g., Jones and Lopez, 2006). Evolutionary psychologists\nhave suggested that men are sensitive to even subtle hormone-related changes in female\nfacial, olfactory or vocal characteristics (e.g., those occurring across the menstrual cycle),\nand there is accumulating evidence that this is indeed the case (see Haselton and\nGildersleeve, 2011 for a recent review). A typical finding is that men judge women's faces,\nvoices, and also body odor collected during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle higher\non attractiveness than those obtained during low-fertility phases (but see Mitro, Gordon,\nOlsson, and Lundstr\u00f6m, 2012 for people's ability to discriminate age based on body odor).\nOur data expand on these studies of men's sensitivity to female menstrual cycle\nrelated changes in facial appearance, body odor and voice quality by investigating men's\nattractiveness and femininity assessments of women from three age groups that cover a\nlarger age range than was the case in previous studies. Considering a women's life span, it\nis obvious that, although female fecundity declines with age, it is not limited to a certain\nperiod in early adulthood (Pawlowski and Dunbar, 1999). Nonetheless, we hypothesized\nCues to female reproductive value\nthat the pattern of differences in men's perception of the attractiveness of facial, vocal, and\nolfactory cues in different groups of women (young girls, adult women, and circum-\nmenopausal women) would be similar to that reported in studies comparing fertile and non-\nfertile phases of the menstrual cycle, such that circum-menopausal women would be judged\nto be less attractive and feminine than the other groups. This hypothesis was supported by\nour data for attractiveness and femininity judgements of female faces and voices, but not\nfor the assessment of body odor. While this latter null result clearly does not imply that\nbody odor conveys no information about women's reproductive value, it does seem to\ncontrast with Mitro et al. (2012), who reported that humans are sensitive to age-related\nintensity of body odor and that this relates to pleasantness ratings. Fundamental differences\nin the design of our and Mitro et al.'s studies may explain this discrepancy, however. For\nexample, Mitro et al. (2012) collected `supra-donor' stimuli by combining body odor\nsamples from same-sex and same-age group individuals, in order to control for the potential\neffects mediated by individual body odor, while our study presented individual samples of\nbody odor to men and considered mean ratings in the statistical analysis. In addition, Mitro\net al. (2012) found that participants' ability to extract age-related cues from body odor\ndepends on the sex of the donor, such that participants' discrimination performance was\nhigher for male body odor than for female body odor whilst pleasantness ratings were\nhigher for female body odor than for male body odor. Except for the difference in\npleasantness ratings of middle-age (45-55 years) and old-age women's (75-95 years) body\nodor (the former being rated as more pleasant), no other significant differences were\ndetected with female donors. The difficulty in detecting age-related differences, especially\nin female body odor, may explain our finding of no significant differences in attractiveness\nand femininity rating among the three age groups.\nAlthough some studies of women's vocal and facial attractiveness have found that\nwomen's voices and faces may be more attractive around ovulation than during other\nphases of the menstrual cycle (Bryant and Haselton, 2009; Roberts et al., 2004), other\nstudies have not observed this pattern of results (e.g., Bleske-Rechek et al., 2011; Fischer et\nal., 2011). Our data showing that circum-menopausal women's voice and faces are\nperceived to be less attractive than those of women with greater reproductive potential,\ntogether with other recent work linking vocal and facial attractiveness to measured\nhormone levels in adult women (Puts et al., 2013), present converging evidence for the\nproposal that women's facial and vocal attractiveness are cues to their reproductive\npotential, even if evidence from studies exploring the effects of fertility over the menstrual\ncycle may be equivocal.\nAn interesting result of this present study is that men's attractiveness and femininity\nassessments of young girl's faces were highest whereas with voices adult women received\nthe highest ratings. There is probably more than one way to interpret this finding and in\nlack of additional attributes and/or hormonal data from our female participants we can only\nspeculate on the actual cause that has created it. We did not ask male judges to explicitly\nrate sexual attractiveness of the women when presenting their faces, body odor and voices.\nThus, the highest ratings of facial attractiveness and femininity of young girls may be\nexplained by a general aesthetic assessment, which is likely influenced, but not necessarily\ncaused, by the mating context. We hypothesize that this result could be an expression of the\nCues to female reproductive value\nfundamental selection pressure operating on male assessments of female quality, resulting\nin preferences for features that signal youth rather than a true preference for young girls'\nfaces. On the contrary, women's voices may be a more accurate cue to female fecundity\nthan faces, given that men's judgements of adult women's vocal attractiveness in particular\nwere highest. With reference to age-related hormonal effects (particularly around puberty\nand menopause) upon female faces and voices, it seems sensible to conclude that the\nstrength of these actions favour voice over facial attractiveness when it comes to the\nassessment of female fecundity.\nIn summary, our data show that female facial and vocal attractiveness (but not body\nodor) serve as age cues and suggest that men are sensitive to these cues when assessing\nwomen's attractiveness and femininity. In considering women of three age groups, i.e.,\nyoung girls, adult women, and circum-menopausal women, we found a significant effect of\nage group on men's assessments of female facial and vocal femininity, which was primarily\ndriven by less positive ratings for circum-menopausal women. Furthermore, our data\nsuggest a general preference for female youth, which finds differential expression in terms\nof attractiveness and femininity assessments of women's faces and voices. In considering\nthe strong link between age and fertility in women, we propose that facial and vocal cues\nmay serve as cues to female reproductive value and that voice quality may particular\nadvertise fecundity. Future studies should employ hormonal data and render men's\nassessments of female features more precisely (e.g., by comparing attractiveness judgments\nin mating and prosocial contexts) in order to disentangle mate preferences from other forms\nof evaluation. Such studies could also more carefully consider the possible effects of the\ntype of relationship for which men judged female attractiveness (e.g., long-term versus\nshort-term, platonic versus sexual) and the possible role that cosmetic procedures may have\nin influencing perceptions of women's reproductive value, particularly when assessing the\nattractiveness of older women.\n"
