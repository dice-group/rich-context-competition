U.S. and Cebu youth consume about\none-fifth of their total daily energy from snacks, but snacks\nprovide a much lower proportion of energy in Russia\n(16%) and China (where snacks provide only 1% of\nenergy).

Popkin\n Key words: away from home eating, fast food, snacking,\nchild diet trends\nIntroduction\nOver the past 15 years, there is increasing evidence that\nthe structure of dietary intakes and the prevalence of obesity\namong children around the world have been changing at an\nincreasingly rapid pace (1). Most available evidence, espe-\ncially in the area of dietary behavior, comes from the United\nStates and other higher-income countries. Among the prom-\ninent trends in these settings are increased snacking and\naway from home consumption and a shift toward more fast\nfood and calorically sweetened beverages. There has been a\nrapid global shift toward increased availability of fast foods\nand processed foods, as well as changes in food distribution\nand marketing, but it is not clear how these changes have\naffected child diets.\nAmong U.S. children, changing dietary patterns are as-\nsociated with concomitant increases in energy intake and a\nhigher percentage of calories from energy-dense nutrient-\npoor foods and snacks (2\u00ad7) eaten at greater frequency\nthroughout the day (3,8). Additionally, an increasing num-\nber of meals are consumed away from home (2,4,6). From\nrestaurant and fast food sources jumped from 9.6% to\n23.5% for the average American. This represents an in-\n17% of their total daily caloric intake from fast food estab-\nlishments (9). The rise in food consumption away from\nhome is paralleled by the increase in commercial eating\nplaces (89%) and fast food restaurants (146%). Using\nspending as a measure of consumption, recent reports show\nthat \"eating out\" now accounts for nearly 40% of food\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed, in part, by the payment of page\ncharges.

Popkin, Carolina Population Center, University of\nE-mail: popkin@unc.edu\nAssociated with the rise in fast and convenience food\noutlets has been a shift in the types of foods being consumed\nin the United States. Consumption of soft drinks, other\nsweetened beverages, and fast food has increased dramati-\ncally for adolescents (2\u00ad4,10,11). Although availability and\nconsumption of fruits and vegetables has been increasing\nremains far below the recommended levels (2). Lytle et al.\n(13) found that, as children moved from the third to eighth\ngrade, fruit and vegetable consumption decreased by 41%\nand 25%, respectively, whereas soft drink consumption\nmore than tripled. Concomitant decreases in milk and fruit\njuice intake were also observed (13).\nThese patterns and trends are important because of their\npotential health consequences for children. Past and ongo-\ning U.S. research is beginning to document how away from\nhome eating, including restaurant and fast food consump-\ntion, and snacking and soft drink consumption increase total\nenergy intake and, thus, have consequences on child obesity\nThere is limited information about children outside of the\nUnited States and Europe (20\u00ad23) and little comparative\nstudy of trends in other parts of the world. In particular, we\nlack information about countries undergoing rapid socio-\neconomic change. The focus of this paper is on changes in\nthe structure of diet among youth in Russia, China, and the\nPhilippines compared with the United States. We examined\ntrends in away from home consumption, snacking, and the\nlevel of modern \"Western\" foods consumed. We used na-\ntionally representative dietary data from the United States\nand Russia, along with an eight-province survey from China\nand a survey of a large metropolitan area in the Philippines\nThese countries were chosen for comparison for several\nreasons. First, they represent different levels of moderniza-\ntion and exposure to globalization of diet patterns. Of the\nfour settings, China is the poorest and was the most isolated\nfrom modern food services such as fast food restaurants\nuntil the 1990s. The United States represents the other end\nof the spectrum. Second, our ongoing longitudinal studies in\nChina, Russia, and Cebu (Philippines) allow us to track\ndietary changes over time in countries undergoing very\nrapid socioeconomic transitions. Third, our long history and\nintensity of research in these populations provides us with a\nbetter understanding of the contexts in which change is\noccurring. Given the potential health effects of trends in\nsnacking and away from home food consumption, our com-\nparative research is important for its worldwide program\nand policy implications.\nResearch Methods and Procedures\nSurvey Design and Sample\nTable 1 summarizes broad similarities and differences\nacross the four studies.\nUnited States. We used data from 2- to 18-year-old par-\nticipants in nationally representative surveys of the U.S.\nFood Intake by Individuals (CSFII96). The latter is com-\nstratified area probability samples of non-institutionalized\nU.S. households in the 48 contiguous states and, in 1996, all\n50 states. These surveys were self-weighting, multistage,\nstratified area samples of the U.S. population. We used all\ndays of 24-hour recall data available from each survey.\nDetailed information pertaining to each survey has been\npublished previously (7).\nTable 1.

The Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey is a\nhousehold-based survey of individuals and is the first na-\ntionally representative sample from the Russian Federation.\nthere was a longitudinal component to the survey, we used\nthe nationally representative cross-sectional sample in each\nround. As with the U.S. data, sample weights and design\ncorrections were used for the Russian data. The Russia\nsample was 76% urban, which corresponds to the national\naverage. One 24-hour recall was available from each survey\n(26). Energy intake was calculated using food composition\ntables developed by Skurikhin and Volgarev (28).\nChina. Analysis was based on data from the China Health\nand Nutrition Survey (CHNS), an ongoing longitudinal\nmultistage, random cluster procedure was used to draw the\nsample in eight provinces. While not designed to be nation-\nally representative, coverage was national. Counties in the\neight provinces were stratified by income (low, middle, and\nhigh), and a weighted sampling scheme was used to ran-\ndomly select four counties in each province. In addition, the\nprovincial capital and a lower income city were selected.\nVillages, townships within the counties, and urban and\nsuburban neighborhoods within the cities were selected\nrandomly. The survey included 190 primary sampling units\nconsisting of 32 urban neighborhoods, 30 suburban neigh-\nborhoods, 32 townships, and 96 villages. Overall, the sam-\nple was 36% urban. Survey design controls, but not sample\nweights, were used with these data.\nThe Chinese diet data were derived from 24-hour recalls\non 3 consecutive days, combined with cooking oil weighed\nand measured at the household level. The latter provides an\naccurate measure of the total edible oil used in household\ncooking and, thus, a better measure of fat intake (29,30).\nEnergy intake was calculated using food composition\ntables developed by the Institute of Nutrition and Food\nCebu. We use data from the Cebu Longitudinal Health\nand Nutrition Survey (CLHNS). In 1983, all pregnant\nwomen living in 33 randomly selected urban and rural\ncommunities of Metro Cebu, Philippines, were asked to\nparticipate in this study. Their singleton infants, born within\na 1-year time period, were included and have been followed\nsince birth. The sample is 73% urban. Here, we used data\n2040) surveys when dietary intake was collected using two\n24-hour dietary recalls. Cooking methods for each food\nwere noted, and fat and energy intakes were estimated for\noil added in cooking. Energy intake was calculated using\nyear-appropriate Philippines Food Composition Tables pro-\nvided by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute (32). As\nwas the case for the China data, survey design controls, but\nnot sample weights, were used with these data. In contrast to\nthe other data sets, the CLHNS is a regional sample focused\non a large urban center and surrounding rural areas, some of\nwhich are on remote islands and in mountainous areas.\nAge Groups\nFor China, Russia, and the United States, we analyzed\nage), as well as the total sample. The CLHNS is a cohort\nstudy, and we used data from three survey rounds, when\nEating Behaviors\nMothers served as proxy informants for children under 10\nyears of age in Russia and China, under 12 years of age in\nthe United States, and under 14 years of age in Cebu. For\neach food listed in the 24 hour recalls, information was\ncollected on the eating occasion (whether considered by the\nrespondent to be a meal or snack) and place of preparation\nand/or consumption. We were interested in place of prepa-\nration primarily to understand the extent to which there was\na pattern of increased consumption of foods fully prepared\naway from home, particularly in the form of fast foods or\nready-made meals. The surveys were not directly compara-\nble in how food source was identified. For the United States,\ninformation was available on where food was obtained and\nwhether it was ever in the home. We distinguished vending\nmachines, stores, and restaurants (including fast food) as\naway from home sources. For Cebu, we collected only place\nof preparation and identified restaurants, street vendors,\nstores, and school feeding programs as away from home\nsources. It should be noted, however, that school feeding\nprograms are limited and typically provide only bulgur as a\nbreakfast food to the poorest children. Place of consumption\nwas not known for Cebu. Thus, we could not determine the\nextent of home consumption of foods prepared elsewhere\n(e.g., take out foods consumed at home).\nFor Russia, data were derived from questions that asked\nwhere each food was consumed and whether it was home\ncooked or not. For place of consumption, we could differ-\nentiate restaurant, school, and work from home. However, a\nlarge number of foods were not home-cooked and, in these\ncases, we could not determine where preparation took place.\nHowever, we know from our experience in Russia and from\nother analyses (33) that items such as bread purchased at\nstores fall into this category. There is little or no tradition of\ntake-out food (i.e., purchase of ready-made foods that were\neaten at home) in Russia.\nChina is the only case where we have identically coded\ninformation on place of preparation and place of consump-\ntion. We, therefore, used China data to show how results\nwere affected by these distinctions.\n1 Nonstandard abbreviations: CLHNS, Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey.\nComparative Child Dietary Trends, Adair and Popkin\nTo examine the thousands of foods contributing to energy\nintake, food groups were developed for each country, with\nU.S. groups serving as a model (34). The food groups were\nstructured to represent the main behaviors of interest.\nWe were interested in three main behaviors. The first was\nconsumption from specific food groups that represent po-\ntentially unhealthy trends. We, therefore, defined groups\nthat represent the following: 1) fast food (pizza, hamburg-\ners, french fries, and other deep-fried items); 2) modern\nsnacks (salty snacks such as potato or corn chips, pretzels);\n3) traditional snacks (for Russia, these include items such as\npumpkin and sunflower seeds; for China, these typically\ninclude mixtures of preserved, salted, or roasted beans and\nplums, and peanuts or sunflower seeds; for Cebu, these are\nusually small rolls and similar bakery products); 4) candies\nand desserts; and 5) soft drinks (calorically sweetened car-\nbonated beverages and fruit drinks). Collectively, these\nitems are typically high in calories but low in micronutri-\nents. The second was meal patterns, with a focus on snack-\ning. The third was place of preparation and/or consumption,\nexamining the extent to which there was a trend of increased\nintake of foods prepared entirely outside of the home.\nStatistical Analysis\nGiven our focus on changing food patterns and eating\noccasions rather than energy intake, all intakes are ex-\npressed as a percentage of total daily energy intake. Foods\nwere first categorized by food group and eating occasion\n(snack vs. non-snack meal according to local definitions).\nWe calculated the percentage of total daily energy intake\ncontributed by each food group and further subdivided these\nintakes into snacks and non-snack meals. For example,\nsnack calories are the total of all snack calories consumed\nby the relevant population divided by the total calories\nconsumed by that population. Values represent average per\ncapita consumption for the sample, not intakes only among\nconsumers. Similarly, we calculated the percentage of daily\ncalories derived from foods prepared and/or consumed\naway from home vs. prepared and consumed at home.\nValues were averaged across the number of days available\nfor each child at each survey. Results were stratified by age\ngroup within each survey year for China, Russia, and the\nage). Because Cebu participants were part of a cohort study,\nall were similar in age at each survey round. The samples\nwere stratified by urban and rural residence to provide\nadditional data for the figures.\nFor the United States and Russia, survey means were\ncalculated using SAS 8.1 to control for survey design ef-\nfects. Because our focus was on time trends, we assessed\ndifferences by survey year within food groups, meal type,\nand eating location using t tests, denoting statistical signif-\nResults\nAre There Shifts in Away from Home Dietary Intake?\nThe source of food (home vs. away from home) by meal\ntype (meal or snack) for children and adolescents from the\nUnited States, Philippines, Russia, and China are presented in\nTable 2. Children in Cebu and the United States consumed the\nmost calories from foods prepared away from home. Cebu\nyouth consumed nearly 40% of total calories from foods pre-\npared away from home. Snack foods in Cebu were predomi-\n1998). The foods prepared away from home and consumed as\nsnacks were typically small rolls and soft drinks purchased at\nsmall stores or bakeries, whereas the away from home foods\nconsumed as meals more typically came from street vendors or\nsmall cafeterias and included rice and vegetable dishes and\nfried foods such as egg rolls. Home preparation of snack foods\nincreased over time, with levels in 2002 being 7 percentage\npoints higher than in 1994. This seems to represent an age-\nrelated trend of consuming morning coffee with milk and\nsugar, which was reported as a pre-breakfast snack.\nIn all age groups in the United States, the percentage of\ncalories consumed away from home increased significantly\nof calories were from away from home sources. While\nyoung children (2 to 5.9 years of age) typically consumed\nfewer calories from away from home sources, their increase\nin time was substantial (e.g., nearly doubling from 13.3% of\nwas similar for both meals and snacks, was accounted for\nprimarily by an increase in the percentage of calories con-\nsumed at restaurants and fast food establishments.\nBy contrast, in 2003, Russian youth consumed only\nries, away from home. There was no significant trend in\nIn China, we found differences in the percentage of\ncalories prepared vs. consumed at home because some fam-\nilies consumed foods at home that were prepared elsewhere.\nFor total calories and meal calories, estimates based on\nplace of preparation and place of consumption were similar\nbecause very few meals were purchased or consumed away\nwere prepared away from home, but 6.6% of calories were\nconsumed away from home. Snack foods were more typi-\ncally prepared away from home, even though they may have\ncalories were prepared away from home, but only 22.7% of\nsnack calories were consumed away from home.\nAge differences were apparent in all countries. In the\nUnited States, preschoolers consumed less food away from\nhome than older children. The opposite was found in China\nand Russia, where younger preschoolers were fed a larger\nproportion of their calories away from home, especially in\nschool programs.\nComparative Child Dietary Trends, Adair and Popkin\nTable 2.

In the Philippines, snacking is very common, with an\nafternoon snack a typical feature of the Cebu eating pattern.\nApproximately 86% of Cebu sample youths reported con-\nsuming at least one food item as a snack in the 2002 survey,\nand, on average, 18% of daily calories came from snacks,\nmostly in the form of bakery products, soft drinks, and milk\nand sugar added to coffee. The percentage of calories from\nsnacks declined as the cohort aged (with total energy from\nsnacks remaining relatively constant, but total energy intake\nincreasing, as would be expected as body size increases with\nage). This trend reflects a decline in the percentage of youth\nwho consumed snacks and lower intakes among consumers.\nUnfortunately, we cannot distinguish whether the overall\ndecline in percentage calories from snacks reflects an age\ntrend or a secular trend.\nIn the United States, snacking is also highly prevalent:\n93.2% of youth reported consuming any food as a snack in\nTable 2.

This represents a large increase since 1977, reflect-\ning both an increase in the percentage of youth who reported\nconsuming a food as a snack and an increase in amount per\nconsumer. The prevalence of snacking is much lower in\nrespectively. With so few snackers, 1% of total energy\ncomes from foods consumed as snacks, with no significant\nallow us to examine snacking trends over time. In the 2003\nsurvey, 70.7% of youth reported consuming any food as a\nsnack, and 16% of energy was derived from snacking.\nAre the Food Shifts Found in the United States\nCommon across the Globe among Children?\nWe defined food groups to capture potentially unhealth-\nful eating trends. The food groups account for different\nproportions of all foods consumed, depending on the coun-\ntry. From the most recent surveys in each country, the\n\"other\" category (foods not captured by the designated\ngroups) is smallest for the United States and Russia (32.2%\nand 34.1% of total calories, respectively), intermediate for\npattern reflects the high consumption of staples (rice in\nCebu, rice and wheat products in China), which fall into the\n\"other\" category. The percentage of snack foods not falling\ninto one of the named food groups is much smaller in each\ncountry.\nThe United States is characterized by marked increases in\nsoft drinks and fruit drinks, fast food (french fries, ham-\nburgers, cheeseburgers, pizzas, and Mexican food are the\nmajor ones), and salty snacks (Table 3A\u00adD). Intake of these\nsignificantly increase over time, but soft drinks consumed as\nIn Russia, these modern items represent only 1.3% of intake\nitems was negligible in China.\nIn the most recent survey data, soft drinks represented\n8.5% of U.S. youth's total energy, 3% in Cebu, and less than\n0.5% in China and Russia. In the United States, soft drink\nconsumption with meals showed a greater increase than as\na snack. Overall, consumption of fast food remains quite\nlow except in the United States.\nAre the Food Shifts Found in the United States Linked\nto Children Residing in Urban Areas?\nThe key results presented above for the total sample of\neach country are stratified by urban or rural residence in\nFigures 1\u00ad4. In China and Cebu, where there is rapid\neconomic growth, the proportion of energy from foods\nprepared away from home was higher in urban areas in both\ntime periods, but the urban\u00adrural difference declined over\ntime (Figure 1). In Cebu, there was a 12% urban\u00adrural\nresult of increasing away from home consumption among\nrural youth and decreasing consumption among urban\nyouth. In China, the urban\u00adrural difference was halved from\nequality is great and minimal economic progress has oc-\ncurred in rural areas, we find a widening gap as the urban\u00ad\nrural difference in percentage of away-from-home calories\nthe United States were also in the direction of more away\nfrom home intake in rural areas.\nSnacking behaviors also differed between urban and rural\nareas. In all countries, a higher percentage of urban resi-\ndents reported consuming snacks, and the urban\u00adrural dif-\nference remained similar over time (Figure 2). Consistent\nwith the higher percentage of youth who reported consum-\ning snacks in urban areas, the percentage of calories from\nsnacks was also higher among urban youth (Figure 3).\nAn urban\u00adrural difference in the consumption of calori-\ncally sweetened beverages and fast foods is apparent in\nCebu but not in the other countries (Figure 4). In China and\nRussia, consumption of these foods was quite low in all\nareas, preventing any meaningful comparisons. In the\nUnited States, soft drink consumption was slightly higher\namong urban than among rural youth.\nDiscussion\nWhile the expansion of global fast food franchises and\nproliferation of local fast food establishments is a well-\nrecognized phenomenon (35,36), these data from large sur-\nveys in China, Russia, and Cebu, Philippines, show that\nthere is not yet widespread consumption of fast food and\nsoft drinks among youth in these settings. Our comparison\nof results across all four countries provides an indication of\nthe enormous heterogeneity of dietary patterns and trends\nacross the world. By no means do these results represent the\nuniverse of patterns. We have examined, in the case of\nChina and Russia, countrywide trends and trends stratified\nby a census-based urban\u00adrural dichotomy. While one might\nexpect more consumption of modern, fast food in urban\nareas, our data show only small urban\u00adrural differences in\nsoft drinks and fast food use among youth in these countries.\nIt is possible that further analysis would reveal important\ndifferences by region and in the most rapidly modernizing\ncities compared with rural areas. In cities such as Moscow,\nBeijing, and Shanghai, American fast food franchises sell-\ning hamburgers, pizza, and fried chicken are clearly visible\nand proliferating. In Metro Cebu, the second largest urban\narea of the Philippines, American and Cebu fast food es-\ntablishments are common. However, the ratio of these to the\ntotal population is very small relative to the United States,\nComparative Child Dietary Trends, Adair and Popkin\nTable 3.

U.S. and Cebu youth consume\nmore than one-third of their total daily calories from foods\nprepared away from home. In the United States, away from\nhome sources contribute similarly to meal and snack calo-\nries, whereas in Cebu, most snack calories (in the range of\n80% to 90%) are from away from home sources. U.S. and\nCebu snack foods are typically processed or fast food\n(United States), bakery products (Cebu), or soft drinks\n(United States and Cebu). In addition, more meals are\npurchased away from home and either eaten away (in res-\ntaurants or fast food establishments in the United States) or\nbrought home from small cafeterias and street vendors\n(Cebu). In the United States, this trend has been attributed to\nFigure 1: The proportion of total daily energy from foods consumed and/or prepared away from home by urban\u00adrural residence.\nFigure 2: The percentage of participants who reported consuming any food item as a snack by urban\u00adrural residence.\nComparative Child Dietary Trends, Adair and Popkin\na wide range of factors, including reduced food prices,\ninnovations that have reduced non-market household food\npreparation time, increased access to the fast food and\nrestaurant sector, and unemployment (37\u00ad40). In Cebu,\nsmall eateries are ubiquitous and for a long time have\nprovided an inexpensive and convenient alternative to home\nfood preparation.\nIn contrast, Chinese children consume very little of their\ntotal energy from foods prepared or eaten away from home,\nalthough more snack foods are purchased away from home.\nChinese snack foods are typically a biscuit, some peanuts,\nor fruit. Eating in restaurants is rare in Chinese families, and\nthere is not a tradition of purchasing inexpensive foods from\nstreet vendors as is the case in Cebu. Similarly, in Russia,\nFigure 3: Trends in snacking behavior. Percentage of total daily energy consumed from snacks by urban\u00adrural residence.\nFigure 4: The percentage of total daily energy derived from modern fast foods (pizza, hamburgers, Mexican foods such as tacos) and soft\ndrinks or fruit drinks by urban\u00adrural residence.\nComparative Child Dietary Trends, Adair and Popkin\nthere is not yet a tradition of bringing ready-prepared foods\ninto the home nor is there a prevalent practice of taking\nchildren to restaurants to eat.\nSnacking\nSnacking is common in the United States, Cebu, and\nRussia, but few Chinese youth reported consuming snacks.\nThe contribution of snacks to total energy intake varies\nsubstantially across the four settings, because the percent-\nage of total calories derived from snacks for the entire\nsample reflects differences in the both the number of snack\nconsumers and the amount consumed among snackers.\nThus, for China, the low prevalence of snacking translates\ninto only a trivial contribution of snacks to total energy\nintake in the population of youth. The United States and\nCebu are characterized by a high level of snacking, with the\nvast majority of youth consuming at least one food as a\nsnack on a daily basis. Snacking in these settings contributes\nabout one-fifth of total daily energy. Snacking can be an\nimportant way to meet the energy and nutrient needs of\ngrowing children, or it can lead to excess energy intake. For\nexample, whereas Cebu snackers had higher total energy\nintakes, in many cases, these still fell below the current\nrecommended daily intake. In contrast, there is evidence\nfrom the United States that snack calories contribute to\nintakes in excess of needs and may contribute to obesity\nTypes of Foods Consumed\nFast food plays a much more dominant role in the Amer-\nican diet. U.S. youth consume close to one-fifth of all their\ncalories from sweetened beverages and fast food, whereas\nyouth in other countries consume 2% to 7% of their calories\nfrom such food items. Nonetheless, as we have shown\nelsewhere, the sweetening of diets reflected in total caloric\nsweeteners consumed is a worldwide trend (10). Salty\nsnacks are increasingly important in the United States and\nRussia, whereas soft drinks are increasingly consumed as\nsnacks by Cebu youth.\nThe low overall intake of modern fast foods in Russia and\nparts of Asia may be partly accounted for by the relative\ncost of these foods. The Cebu and China samples comprise\nboth urban and rural residents, many of whom live in quite\nlow-income households. Fast food remains relative expen-\nsive, particularly in comparison with local home-based eat-\neries and street vendors and when fuel and time costs are\ntaken into account. For example, in Cebu, a fast food meal\nof a small burger, french fries, and a soft drink costs about\n$0.90, whereas a traditional meal of rice and a mixed meat\nand vegetable dish purchased at a local eatery would cost\nmuch less. In China, a burger, fries, and soft drink would\ncost about $4.00 (30 Chinese Yuan), which is about four\ntimes the cost of an equivalent traditional meal of rice and\na mixed meat and vegetable dish. Availability is also a\nfactor, with modern fast food options found primarily in the\nmost urbanized areas.\nUrban\u00adRural Residence\nAs expected, urban residents engage more in the modern\neating behaviors as they consume more food away from\nhome, snack more often, and consume more fast foods and\nsoft drinks. The trends are mixed, and if anything, for away\nfrom home behavior, there is a narrowing of the urban\u00adrural\ndifference, and in many cases, there is no clear trend.\nHealth Implications\nThere is certainly growing evidence of the increase in\nchild obesity across the world (22), and some scholars have\nshown how components of these dietary trends are part of\nA recent emphasis by the World Health Organization on\ndiet, activity, and obesity has highlighted the influence of\nmodern food processing and production and marketing in\nchanging worldwide diets (45,46). Among the World Health\nOrganization recommendations to governments were: 1)\ndiscourage advertising of unhealthy dietary practices and\nphysical inactivity and 2) work with consumer groups and\nthe private sector to deal with marketing of food to children,\nsponsorship, and advertising.\nThe results of this study do not invalidate this effort.\nFirst, we do not provide evidence here on the penetration of\nmodern marketing and advertising into all of these coun-\ntries. Second, we do not focus on modern urban areas such\nas Moscow and Shanghai, where the penetration of modern\nmarketing techniques and fast food concerns is faster. Our\nanalysis has focused on population level trends rather than\ntrends within subgroups that might be at greater risk (e.g.,\nhigher income, more urban households). Our results for\nChina and Russia show, as yet, a minimum invasion of fast\nfoods and soft drinks on a countrywide level. Even in Cebu,\nwhere there is an obvious proliferation of fast food estab-\nlishments, there is relatively little consumption of fast food\nitems (aside from soft drinks) by Cebu youth in our sample.\nTo provide further context for our results, it is important to\nnote that the prevalence of overweight, using the definition\nof the International Obesity Task Force (20) for children or\nrelatively low in our samples compared with the United\nStates.
