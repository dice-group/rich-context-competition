    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe study found out the role that some selected science curricula of the pre-tertiary level of education in Ghana played with\nrespect to climate change education. Content analysis was used to analyze four science curricula of the pre-tertiary levels\nof education in Ghana, namely, the curriculum for primary, Grades 1 to 3 (age = 6-9 years); integrated science curriculum\nof primary, Grades 4 to 6 (age = 9-12 years); integrated science curriculum of the Junior High School (JHS; age = 12-13\nyears); and the integrated science curriculum of the Senior High School (SHS; age = 13-16 years). It was found that of the\nfour curricula, it was only in the integrated science syllabuses of the SHS and that of the JHS that climate change as a topic\nfor study had been stated categorically, but, even then, the teaching and learning methods needed to be improved on. It\nwas practically non-existent in the natural science curriculum of Primary Grades 1 to 3. There were topics in some of the\ncurricula such as \"Ecosystems,\" \"Photosynthesis,\" and \"Energy\" that can provide links to climate change education but were\nnot linked to it. Some of the suggestions made to make these curricula play their roles in climate change education are that:\n(a) topics that lend themselves to climate change education in the various curricula could be linked to it in the teaching\nand learning situation to reinforce learning and (b) teaching and learning methods should be improved upon for effective\nattitudinal and behavioral changes to help mitigate climate change and its impact.\n",

Different meth-\nods are being used to find solutions to this menace. Education\nis one of the methods that have been recommended (Anderson,\n2011). Although there are many advocates of having climate\nchange education incorporated in the educational system,\nthere are counter arguments against that (Fortner, 2001;\nTomasevic, 2013). The reasons given by the opposers are: (a)\nthe real cause of climate change is not known, so why teach\nstudents what is not fully established (Conger, 2013;\nTomasevic, 2013), (b) overloading of school curricula (Smith,\nple, in the United States, the controversial nature of its inclu-\nsion led to the slashing off of some of the content of climate\nchange from the science curriculum and emphasis on its\nanthropogenic nature was also reduced (Tomasevic, 2013).\nUnited Kingdom removed it from its curriculum (Tomasevic,\nLiterature reveals that opposition to climate change educa-\ntion comes mainly from non-scientists and are found in non-\nrefereed journals and are often funded by special interest\nrounding the inclusion of climate change in school curricula\nhas made it difficult for its integration in the curricula of some\nschools (Tomasevic, 2013). That notwithstanding, it has been\nincluded successfully in the curricula of some schools\n(Roehrig, Campbell, Dalbotten, & Varma, 2012) because it\nequips the young who have more years to live and therefore\nwill have longer exposure to the effects of climate change.\nAlthough recent research has shown that knowledge about\nclimate change does not automatically mean concern toward\nit (Battistoni, 2012), the reasons for learning about climate\nchange far outweigh the reverse. This is also because there is\nevidence that students equipped with such knowledge show\n1University of Cape Coast, Ghana\nCorresponding Author:\nCecilia Boakye, Institute of Education, University of Cape Coast, Cape\nCoast, Ghana.\nEmail: pomboakye@gmail.com\nClimate Change Education: The Role of\nPre-Tertiary Science Curricula in Ghana\nCecilia Boakye1\n Keywords\nclimate change, action-oriented teaching, education\n2 SAGE Open\nFor climate change education to be effectively imple-\nmented in schools, there is the need to find out the extent of\nits integration into school curricula so that any deficiencies\ncan be addressed. Research into the extent of integration of\nclimate change in school science curricula has been done in\nboth cases, content analysis was used to analyze curricula\nand syllabi. Findings from both studies stated abysmal inte-\ngration of climate change in the curricula of the schools and\nthe non-action-oriented nature of the teaching and learning\nmethods. Action-oriented methods make students active par-\nticipants in the lesson or have the potential to sensitize stu-\ndents to take action (Carboschools Consortium, 2010; Filho,\nPace, & Manolas, 2010). There is the need to do the same for\nthe curricula of other countries so that climate change educa-\ntion can be integrated effectively in school curricula. In this\nstudy, I also sought to find out the extent of integration of\nclimate change into science curricula of pre-tertiary schools\nin Ghana so that if there was a need for improvement, this\ncould be done to promote effective climate change education\nin Ghana. This is necessary because Ghana is experiencing\nthe impact of climate change, and she needs to educate her\ncitizens to help mitigate climate change and its effects.\nContext of the Study\nThere have been reported cases of environmental catastro-\nphes in Africa due to climate change (AllAfrica, 2013; Ofei-\nBank Group, 2013), and Ghana has her fair share of it (Badu-\nlot of problems in Ghana such as (a) change in rainfall pat-\nterns, (b) a rise in the incidence of pests and diseases of crops\nand livestock, (c) reduction in crop yield, and (d) destruction\nof lives and property caused by floods and droughts (Kunateh,\n2013). All these have negative effect on income generation\nactivities. Some of the human activities that contribute to the\nclimate problems in Ghana are deforestation caused by bush\nburning and the use of wood as fuel and charcoal making\n(GhanaCentric, 2010). This situation has demanded that\nefforts must be made in Ghana to combat climate change. To\nthis end, a National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) has been\nmade, and it has been approved by parliament to help combat\nthe effects of climate change in Ghana (OmgGhana, 2013).\nThe University of Ghana on its part has introduced two post-\ngraduate programmes in climate change and sustainable\nthe programmes \"are to contribute to the development of\nexpertise in Ghana and Afrclimate change and development\nissues and to promote research on climate change impact\nassessment, adaptation and mitigation\" (University of Ghana,\n2013, p. 1). The president of Africa University College of\nCommunication (AUCC) also expressed the desire to restruc-\nture its curriculum to integrate climate lessons to equip their\nstudents so that they can educate ordinary citizens, including\nfarmers (OmgGhana, 2013). Ghana needs to integrate climate\nchange education into the curricula of the basic to the tertiary\nlevels of education after reviewing them (GhanaCentric,\n2010). This according to Ghanacentric, will produce the local\nexpertise to manage crisis and reach out to the entire popula-\ntion.Also as a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, it is also oblig-\natory for Ghana to control her own greenhouse emission\nIn Ghana, the pre-tertiary education consists of pre-\nschool, followed by 3 years of lower primary and 3 years of\nupper primary. The next level is the Junior High School\n(JHS) that is of 3-year duration. Successful candidates enter\nthe Senior High Schools (SHSs). At all these levels, science\nis taught except at the pre-school level. One objective for the\nteaching and learning of science at these levels is to equip the\nstudents to solve environmental problems. Is climate change,\nwhich is a very important environmental problem, factored\ninto the science curricula at these levels? Knowing the state\nof climate change education in the pre-tertiary curricula is\nimportant so that it can be made more effective if there is that\nneed. Students can be better equipped in that way so that\nthey, in turn, can educate the populace.\nThe purpose of the study was, therefore, to find out the\nextent of integration of climate change education in the\npre-tertiary science curricula and to make suggestions if\nnecessary. The study answered specifically the following\nquestions:\nResearch Question 1: To what extent is climate change\nintegrated in the science curricula at the pre-tertiary levels\nof education, if at all?\nResearch Question 2: If climate change has not been\nintegrated, how can it be improved upon?\nLiterature Review\nThe Need for Climate Change Education\nAlthough natural phenomena such as ocean currents, emis-\nsions from volcanoes, or normal climate variability can\ninfluence climate change to a great extent, it is also influ-\nenced by some of these activities of humans: deforestation,\nintensive farming, and intensive use of fossil fuels (Sharma,\n2012). The anthropogenic nature of global climate change\nStanford University, 2011). There is, therefore, the need for\nsomething more than technology to address it. Sharma\nargued that if it were the consequences of individual actions,\nas shared by Pettenger, cited by Feirabend and Eilks (2010),\nthen the logical thing to do to address global climate change\nwas to educate individuals to behave in environmentally\nresponsive ways. As a social solution, Sharma suggested that\nthe preparation of students in schools should equip them with\na better understanding of climate change to enable them to\nact in ways that will sustain the environment. According to\nUniversity (2011), and United Nations Educational, Scientific\nand Cultural Organization [UNESCO] (2009), education is\nan indispensable component of any program to combat cli-\nmate change and its effects. For example, if one considers\n\"adaptation\" and \"mitigation,\" which are the two current\napproaches in responding to climate change (Ofei-Nkansah,\n2013), not much can be done to combat climate change and\nits effects without education.\nThe need for education is clarified by Dyster (2013):\nEducation is the most powerful tool and can engage young\npeople in the debate, prepare them for working with the green\neconomy, and give the definitive science and facts about the\nbiggest issue facing young people. To quote H.G. Wells: \"Human\nhistory becomes more and more a race between education and\ncatastrophe.\" (p. 3)\nResearch shows that pupils are empowered to do some-\nthing about climate change and feel positive and less wor-\nried about it when they are given accurate information about\nit (Bryan, 2011). Examples abound in the literature where\neducation has been helpful in addressing issues with respect\nto climate change such as: (a) when a 15-year-old student\nopposed the removal of climate change from the geography\ncurriculum of the United Kingdom by writing eloquently\nabout the dangers of its removal. Thirty thousand signatures\nsupported her petition in a matter of weeks (Dyster, 2013)\n(b) pupils made a great impact in their communities regard-\ning the reduction of global warming gas emission with\nresultant great monetary savings through school carbon\nreduction initiatives (Cherry, 2011) and (c) The League of\nConservation Voters Education Fund found in a study that it\nwas information from educational materials that their chil-\ndren brought home from school that even environmentally\nminded citizens received most of their \"green\" information.\nMoreover, it was pressure from their children that caused\nthem to act in a responsible way toward their environment\nAlthough children are vulnerable, they are agents of\nchange in climate change issues (Anderson, 2010; UNICEF,\n2012). Thus, if children are empowered by providing them\nwith the necessary education on disasters and climate change\nin a conducive environment, their vulnerability is reduced,\nand, at the same time, they contribute to sustaining the envi-\nronment. Such knowledge and empowerment given to chil-\ndren through the school curriculum results in reduced\nvulnerability to risk, and, at the same time, it promotes the\nachievement of children's environmental rights as is con-\ntained in the numerous articles of the Convention on the\nDifferent definitions have been given to climate change\neducation, but they mainly stress on knowledge, attitudinal,\nand behavioural change. One such definition is:\nclimate change education is about helping learners understand\nand address the impacts of global warming today, while at the\nsame time encouraging the change in attitudes and behavior\nneeded to put our world on a more sustainable path in the future.\nTherefore, some of the characteristics of a climate literate\nperson are that the person is: (a) knowledgeable enough\nabout climate change to take informed decisions that will\nhelp mitigate climate change, and (b) has desirable attitude\nand behaviour toward climate adaptation and mitigation\nchange education should therefore move from awareness, to\nunderstanding, and finally taking action (Carboschools\nTeaching and Learning Methods in Climate\nChange Education\nBecause climate change education involves learning that\nshould change attitude and behaviour, the teaching and learn-\ning method is very important. Literature supports active\ning and learning methods should touch the heart as well as\nthe mind. Cherry (2011), through her Young Voices on\nClimate Change project, used methods that touched the\nhearts as well as the minds of the young people, and this had\na great impact in the community in which the young people\nlived. Cherry used motivational Young Voices on Climate\nChange films in which children were involved in activities to\ncombat climate change.\nWith respect to climate change \"the main emphasis of any\neducational campaign should be on learning not on teaching\"\nrecommended that to enable pupils to become active mem-\nbers of society in future, action skills in which a situation is\ncreated for pupils to experience the democratic process of\nthinking up, agreeing, implementing, and evaluating con-\ncrete changes individually and in a group should be used in\nclimate change education.\nClimate Change Education and the Science\nCurriculum\nSome of the causes of climate change such as greenhouse\neffect, bush burning, and deforestation make it science\nrelated. According to Tomasevic (2013), climate change is\nscience. Science lessons have been used to teach climate\nchange and some of such lessons are found in the literature\nics that have been used in climate change lessons are energy\nsynthesis (Mr. Green Lesson Plan, 2010), and the forest (Job\n4 SAGE Open\nCorps Lesson Plan, 2008; Kindlmannov\u00e1 & Semer\u00e1kov\u00e1,\n2010). In the U.S. curriculum, climate change forms part of\nthe science curriculum (Tomasevic, 2013). In Ethiopia, it is\nintegrated into the Biology curriculum (Dalelo, 2012).\nHowever, the literature reveals that science alone is not\nvery effective in the teaching and learning of climate change.\n\"Climate change science is one of the first science topics that\nsocial science physical science collaboration is required\"\n(Semper, 2010, p. 8). Many suggestions have been given as\nto what should constitute a climate change curriculum. Some\nexamples are that it should be (a) multidisciplinary/interdis-\nthe science curriculum (Conger, 2013). The interdisciplinary\napproach to climate change education has been used success-\nfully in the CYCLES approach. The approach blended inte-\ngrative science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to\nteach climate change. That approach motivated the students\nand engaged them in meaningful problems within their com-\nmunities. The conclusion drawn from the approach was that\nthere is the need for new approaches to science teaching and\nlearning that can promote the kinds of skills and critical\nthinking needed to address the global and multidisciplinary\nproblems facing our planet (Roehrig et al., 2012).\nMethod\nIt was a content analysis research in which I purposively\nsampled and analyzed the natural and integrated science cur-\nriculum documents of the pre-tertiary institutions to find out\nto what extent climate change as a topic had been included.\nThe documents were the syllabuses, the textbooks, and the\nteachers' guides. The pre-tertiary documents selected for the\nlower primary to JHS were implemented in 2012 and those\nof the SHS were implemented in 2010. They are: (a) lower\nprimary, Grades 1 to 3, natural science syllabus (Ministry of\nEducation, 2012a); (b) lower primary, Grades 1 to 3, natural\nscience teachers'guides (Asiedu, Baah-Yeboah, & Domptey,\nmary, Grades 1 to 3, natural science textbooks (Asiedu et al.,\ngrated science syllabus (Ministry of Education, 2012b); (e)\nupper primary, Grades 4 and 6, integrated science textbooks\n2012d); (f) upper primary, Grades 4 and 6, integrated science\n(g) JHS, Years 1 to 3, integrated science syllabus (Ministry of\nEducation, 2012c); (h) JHS, Years 1 to 3, integrated science\n2012f); and (j) SHS integrated science, Years 1 to 3, syllabus\n(Ministry of Education, 2010). I chose the natural science\nand integrated science curricula because they were core cur-\nricula. Other curricula in the Ghanaian pre-tertiary education\nthat had some element of climate change are the (a) SHS\nbiology, (b) SHS chemistry, and (c) SHS geography.\nHowever, they were elective curricula and besides, the aspect\nof climate change (greenhouse effect) and the teaching and\nlearning methods were almost the same as those found in the\nscience core curricula that I chose for this study. The curri-\ncula that had the potential to be used for the teaching and\nlearning of climate change at the pre-tertiary level were the\nsocial studies curricula of the basic schools and SHSs.\nHowever, no element of climate change was incorporated in\neither of them. The textbooks and teachers'guides that I used\nwere based on the syllabuses. Because the syllabuses were\nteaching syllabuses, what they contained was not much dif-\nferent from how the curricula were enacted. The content of\nall the syllabuses that I used had been arranged in units (see\nthe appendix). I also analyzed the West Africa Examination\nCouncil (WAEC) test items for Basic Education Certificate\nExamination (BECE), West Africa Senior Secondary School\nCertificate Examination (WASSCE), and Senior Secondary\nSchool Certificate Examination (SSSCE) to find out if cli-\nmate change items were included. WAEC is the principal\nexamining institution for the West African sub-region. BECE\nis the final examination at the end of basic school (primary\nand JHS) education that qualified one to enter the SHS.\nSSSCE and WASSCE are the examinations at the end of\nSHS education that qualified one to enter a higher (tertiary)\ninstitution. SSSCE has been phased out, and it has been\nreplaced with WASSCE. For BECE, the papers I analyzed\nmethods in this study.\nTo establish the extent of the integration of climate change\nin each curriculum, I based my analysis on: (a) the propor-\ntion of climate change topic(s) in the syllabus, (b) the nature\nof the information the climate change topic(s) provided, (c)\nthe nature of the teaching and the learning methods associ-\nated with the topics, (d) potential climate change topics that\nhave not been related to it, and (e) the frequency of assess-\nment based on climate change.\nTo establish the proportion of the curriculum that made up\nclimate change, the units in the syllabuses served as units of\nanalysis. I counted the units that contained climate change\ntopics for each syllabus and proportions were established\nusing percentages. The percentage was calculated by divid-\ning the number of climate change unit(s) I identified by the\ntotal number of units in the syllabus and multiplied the result\nby 100. For the nature of the content, it was found out\nwhether they promoted climate change education by provid-\ning knowledge about climate change that will help a person\nto make informed decisions with respect to adaptation and\nmitigation (Semper, 2010). Because climate change knowl-\nedge demands attitudinal change, teaching and learning\nmethods must have the potential to foster that. I therefore\nanalyzed the teaching and learning methods to see whether\nthey were action-oriented by using methods that involve (a)\nactive participation of the students (Bryan, 2011;\nRoehrig et al., 2012) and/or (b) methods that have the poten-\ntial to promote active participation in the fight against cli-\nmate, such as observing other children involved in climate\nchange activities (Cherry, 2011). The fourth criterion for the\nintegration was whether there were topics that have the\npotential to be used to teach climate change and whether they\nhave been used for that purpose. Relating such topics to cli-\nmate change can have the potential to reinforce learning\nbecause of the repetition and also enhance adaptation and\nmitigation. For the fifth criterion that is on assessment, I ana-\non climate change was assessed and the kind of knowledge\nthat was assessed. I solicited the assistance of another col-\nleague, science educator, to do the same analysis using the\nfive criteria, and the two outcomes were reconciled so that\nthe analyses were objective.\nResults and Discussion\nThe Extent of Integration of Climate Change Into\nthe Pre-Tertiary Science Curricula\nTable 1 shows the integration of climate change in the four\ncurricula.\nThe content analysis revealed that climate change was\nnon-existent in the curricula of the lower primary, Grades 1\nto 3, and upper primary, Grades 4 to 6, but was present in the\nJHS and SHS curricula.\nAs can be seen from Table 1, at both the JHS and SHS levels\nthe proportion of climate change integrated into both curricula\nwere the same, 2%. The 2% climate change content of both the\nSHS and JHS leaves much to be desired considering the fact\nthat there were potential topics in the curriculum that could\nhave been related to it to reinforce learning. Nonetheless, the\n2% is higher than what was found in Kenya (Republic of\ncurriculum addressed directly or indirectly climate change\nissues. The absence of climate change in the primary school\ncurriculum in Ghana is worrisome. The situation is unlike\nKenya and other places where teaching and learning of climate\nchange start in the primary school (Cherry, 2011; Republic of\nment of children with climate change information.\nLower and upper primary curricula and climate change integration.\nAlthough climate change was not integrated into the curri-\ncula of the lower and upper primary, there were topics in\nboth curricula that lent themselves to climate change as can\nbe seen in Table 1. The science curriculum of the lower pri-\nmary consisted of topics in the major branches of science.\nThe purpose of the lower primary science curriculum was to\nprovide a strong foundation for further study of science at the\nupper primary level and beyond (Ministry of Education,\n2012a). That climate change was absent in the science curri-\ncula of the lower and upper primary is worrisome. This is\nbecause children form a large part of millions of people\nneeded to mitigate climate change and its impact (Cherry,\n2011). This situation is not in conformity with the suggestion\nof Stanford University (2011) about children's knowledge of\nclimate change. Moreover, it is the opposite of what is being\ndone in the American school system (Tomasevic, 2013).\nIn the upper primary integrated science curriculum, the\ntopic \"Flooding\" in the syllabus could have provided a good\nlink to climate change, but content analysis of the syllabus,\npupils' textbooks, and the teacher's guide revealed that that\nlink was absent. Table 2 shows the teaching and learning activ-\nities and evaluation as given in the upper primary syllabus on\nthe topic \"Flooding.\"\nThe role of climate change in flooding should have been\nincluded. Prevention of flooding was included in the content\nof the textbook, but it was not related to climate change. The\npreventive measures to flooding that were stated in the\npupil's textbook, such as not building in waterways are good,\nbut it should not end there. Children must learn about climate\nchange adaptation and how to be safe during disasters. Skills\nsuch as first aid, swimming, and water safety can be learned\nthrough simulation and drills. Then, through theater and\nmusic activities, they can educate their communities.\nTraining children in disaster skills has been done in the\nPhilippines and has proved useful. In Liloan and San\nFrancisco villages, knowledge learnt that way saved both\nadults and children from a landslide (Anderson, 2010).\nTable 1.

In the\nJHS syllabus, climate change was integrated in the JHS 2\nunder \"carbon cycle.\"\nContent analysis of the pupil's science textbook on \"car-\nbon cycle\" showed that pupils were supposed to be intro-\nduced to the following terms: \"greenhouse effect,\"\n\"greenhouse gas,\" \"climate change,\" photosynthesis, com-\nbustion, atmosphere, carbon cycle, deforestation. This is\ngood, because they are all related to climate change. They\nwere also supposed to learn about the negative effects of cli-\nmate change and the activities that can cut down on green-\nhouse emission such as the use of less fossil fuel, and the use\nof renewable sources of energy such as solar and wind power.\nPupils were supposed to carry out a role-play to represent the\ncarbon cycle. These activities can empower the pupils with\nknowledge on climate change as recommended by (Anderson,\nmation in their notebooks/textbooks may sensitize others\nsuch as their parents who may read them as was reported by\nCherry (2011). It can also empower them with some knowl-\nedge on mitigation. However, action-oriented teaching and\nlearning methods where students learn by doing as suggested\nby Carboschools Consortium (2010) and used successfully by\nCherry (2011) were lacking. This situation does not augur\nwell for the acquisition of attitudinal and behavioural changes\nthat are needed for combating climate change. The teaching\nand learning methods can be improved upon to help the pupils\nmake more impact on their environment as was done by\nCherry (2011) and learn adaptation methods as was reported\nby Anderson (2010). The evaluation activities and student\nactivities in Table 3 are not action-oriented. There was one\nitem in the science textbook that asked the pupils to find out\nhow climate change may affect Ghana and how the impact\ncould be reduced. This is good because it is sensitizing them\nto mitigation. It can however be improved upon , for example,\nby asking the pupils about the effect of climate change on\ntheir school compound and in the communities they live and\nthe action they can take if there is a negative impact. Then\nstudents can be engaged in action-oriented activities.\nAlthough the climate change content in the JHS curriculum\nwas 2%, it is higher than what was found in Ethiopia (Dalelo,\ntion in this study is that the textbook and teacher's guide for\nPrimary Grade 5 were not available to be analyzed. However,\nthe syllabus reflected what should be in the textbook and\nteacher's guide, because it was a teaching syllabus.\nThe analyses of the BECE test items revealed that from\nchange formed part of the assessment. That item demanded\nof the candidates to mention two ways in which the carbon\ncycle can be maintained and to state one environmental\neffect when the carbon cycle is disrupted. This formed two\nseparate subsections of an item with four subsections. The\nindication from this observation is that climate change does\nnot feature much in the assessment at the BECE level. This is\nto be expected because the BECE is based on the whole of\nthe basic school syllabus in which the component of climate\nchange is only 2% of the JHS curriculum.\nTable 2.

The climate change com-\nponent of the SHS integrated science syllabus is one unit out\nof 50 (2%) of the total content of the SHS integrated science\nteaching syllabus. It formed part of the SHS 1 syllabus under\n\"interactions in nature.\" Table 4 shows the content of the cli-\nmate change in the SHS syllabus.\nFor the SHS, one limitation was that only the teaching syl-\nlabus was analyzed. The SHS syllabus is also a teaching syl-\nlabus, and it reflects the content to be taught in the curriculum.\nIn the SHS syllabus, similar to the JHS, students were sup-\nposed to be equipped with knowledge on the effects of cli-\nmate change. This is in line with Anderson (2010), Semper\nthe syllabus are: (a) differentiate between the troposphere and\nstratosphere in terms of the following: temperature, air com-\nposition, and pressure; and (b) outline five effects of climate\nchange on biodiversity resources. In terms of action-oriented\nactivities (Carboschools Consortium, 2010) that promote atti-\ntudinal and behavioral changes, these were lacking in the sug-\ngested evaluation. The latter evaluation on biodiversity is\ngood but can be made better if students transfer the knowl-\nedge to their community by finding out the effect of climate\nchange on biodiversity in their community. After that, they\ncan be engaged in activities in their community to mitigate or\nprevent climate change and its impact depending on the out-\ncome of their investigation. That will make it action-oriented\nrelated to climate change in the SHS curriculum (Table 1) can\nalso be used to reinforce knowledge on climate change.\nThe analysis of the SSSCE and WASSCE items (1993-\nWASSCE; and (e) 2014, WASSCE. Thus, within that\nperiod, items on climate change had been assessed in 4 out\nof the 14 years. This is to be expected because climate\nchange forms only 2% of the SHS curriculum. The items\nmainly focused on the gas responsible for the greenhouse\neffect and how global warming can be minimized. The test\nitems reflected the nature of the climate change content that\nwas stated in the syllabus.\nConclusions and Implications\nOn the whole, the extent of integration of climate change into\nthe pre-tertiary science curricula in Ghana leaves much to be\ndesired. The content analysis of the four science curricula\nrevealed that climate change is factored into the JHS and\nSHS curricula, but it is non-existent in the lower and upper\nprimary curricula. Leaving the upper and lower primaries out\ncuts off children whom literature shows are very effective in\nthe fight against climate change (Cherry, 2011). For the JHS\nand SHS curricula, climate change formed 2% in each case\nbut there are topics in both curricula that lend themselves to\nclimate change education some of which have been used in\nthat respect in the literature (Climate Change Live, 2013;\nProbably, relating those topics to climate change may over-\nload the curricula (Smith, 2013). The climate change content\ngenerally provides factual knowledge to the students which\nare not in line with the expectation of the nature of climate\nchange education (Anderson, 2010; Carboschools\nTable 4. Climate Change in the SHS Syllabus.\nSpecific objectives Content Teaching and learning activities\nIdentify the various regions of\nthe atmosphere\nOutline the effects of human\nactivities on the atmosphere\nDescribe the major pollutants\nof the atmosphere and their\neffects\nLayers of the atmosphere: Troposphere,\nstratosphere, mesosphere, and\nthermosphere/ionosphere\nHuman activities and their effects on the\natmosphere\nMajor atmospheric pollutants: Sources\nand effects\nBrainstorm to bring out the layers of the atmosphere\nDescribe the characteristics of each layer in terms of\nthickness, temperature, air quality and composition,\npressure, and support for human activities\nGather information from the Internet and scientific journals\non the effects of human activities on the atmosphere, i.e.,\nair transport, defense, industrialization, agriculture, etc.\nDiscuss the sources and the effects of the following\npollutants: Oxides of lead, nitrogen and sulfur; ozone,\nhalons (carbon and halogen compounds, etc.)\nExplain Greenhouse effect on\nclimate change\nGreenhouse effect and climate change\nDesertification, drought\nMelting of ice and polar ice caps, rising\nsea levels\nIncrease in number and intensity of\nhurricanes (cyclones), effects on\nbiodiversity resources, etc.\nGive examples of Greenhouse gases, e.g., Carbon (IV)\noxide, methane\nDiscuss what a \"greenhouse\" is and its effect: Global\nwarming and climate change\nProject:\nStudents to interview people in the community to find out\nand report on climate change in the community over the\npast 30 to 50 years and its effect on the community\nNote. SHS = Senior High School.\n8 SAGE Open\nactivities are generally inadequate because they are not\naction-oriented as has been suggested in the literature (Bryan,\nvide students with knowledge about climate change but can\nhardly help the students in the adaptation and mitigation of\nclimate change.\nClimate change items are factored into the BECE and\nWASSCE/SSSCE. The implication is that it is deemed to be\nimportant and for that matter, the students must have knowl-\nedge on it. However, the frequency of the incorporation of\nthe test items is higher at the WASSCE/SSSCE level than at\nthe BECE level. This shows the less emphasis given to it at\nthat level. This is to be expected because at that level, there\nis a total absence of climate change content at both the upper\nand lower primary curricula.\nSuggestions\nFor the curriculum to play its role in climate change educa-\ntion properly and for Ghana to play a more effective role as a\nsignatory to the Kyoto Protocol (GhanaCentric, 2010), there\nis the need to infuse climate change content into the curricu-\nlum of the lower and upper primary to make the students\nknowledgeable and be able to take part in debates and deci-\nsions on it (Dyster, 2013) and also equip them with the skills\nneeded for mitigation and adaptation (Anderson, 2010;\nThe topics that lend themselves to climate change in the\nfour curricula can be used for reinforcement of knowledge\non climate change if that will not overload the curriculum\n(Smith, 2013). The \"application\" aspect of the Ghanaian pre-\ntertiary science lesson plan (Arhin & Asimah, 2006) where\nthe knowledge gained in a lesson is applied to everyday life\ncan be used for that purpose. That aspect takes up only 2 to 4\nminutes of the lesson. The literature has lessons on science\ntopics and how they are related to climate change, and teach-\ners can avail themselves of such lessons.\nThe teaching and learning activities should be improved\nupon to provide opportunities for students to acquire skills\nfor adaptation and mitigation with respect to climate change\nas has been done in other places (Anderson, 2010). All these\nhave implication for facilities and resources. Facilities and\nresources must be made available to engage the students in\nactivities that will give the students knowledge about climate\nchange. Teachers who are the implementers of the curricu-\nlum must be knowledgeable about climate change and be\nprepared to engage students in action-oriented activities.\nPupils can be engaged in greening activities on their school\ncompound.\nAn interdisciplinary approach to the teaching and learn-\ncan be adopted to effectively groom the students for adapta-\ntion and mitigation because the science curriculum alone\ncannot do that effectively. This has implication for research.\nResearch can be done by analyzing all the Ghanaian basic\nand SHS curricula that lend themselves to climate change\neducation so that a better approach to the teaching and learn-\ning of climate change that meets all the conditions specified\ncan be developed.\nAppendix\nTable A1.
