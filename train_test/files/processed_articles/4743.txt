We examine the model of environmental governance that is emerging in Kosovo,\nwithin the context of its limited statehood and Vattelian sovereignty (Krasner, 2005). Since\nthis model of environmental governance appears thoroughly institutionalised on paper, we\nexamine whether the corresponding distribution of power is reflected in practice. We explore\nthe extent to which Kosovo's hierarchy and networks are weak, despite external efforts at\nstrengthening both. In order to assess the effects of external involvement, we examine the\nroles of the European Union (EU), USA, and Serbia, each of which appear to have divergent\npolicies and goals. Taking into account the competing governance agendas \u00ad the EU aiming\nto strengthen hierarchical governance, the US focusing on market liberalisation, and Serbia\nacting as a `spoiler' (Menkhaus, 2007) \u00ad we examine the extent to which this helps to create\na government more responsive to external incentives than domestic pressures, thereby\nweakening local non-governmental actors. Lastly, we examine whether Kosovo's limited\ndomestic sovereignty (Krasner and Risse, 2014) and extensive external actor involvement\nhelp to further weaken non-state actors.\nWe are particularly interested in exploring the roles of three external actors: the EU,\nUSA, and Serbia. This is because Kosovo has `limited statehood' (Risse, 2011) and lacks\ncapacity to implement and enforce decisions and laws, which in turn leads to a higher degree\nof external intervention and non-hierarchical coordination (B\u00f6rzel and Risse, 2010; Risse,\n2011). Kosovo has been administered and supported (practically and financially) by external\nactors since 2000, and thus offers an exceptional opportunity for exploring: (a) how those\nexternal actors seek to facilitate environmental governance in the context of statebuilding;\n936 J Obradovic-Wochnik, A Dodds\nand (b) external actors interact and compete in the Kosovan space. The EU and the USA\nare of special interest for our analysis, as they have been the key drivers of Kosovo's post-\nconflict stabilisation and to an extent, its independence.\nOur key argument is that the EU and the US are helping to build hierarchical governance\nin Kosovo by strengthening its state capacities, which are currently weak. At the same time,\nthis type of external statebuilding interferes with Kosovo's Weberian/Vattelian sovereignty\n(Krasner, 2005), since donor conditionality and international `trusteeship' of states like\nKosovo has a marked impact on domestic authority structures, decision making, and the\nEU and US efforts at strengthening Kosovo's own hierarchy are carried out through\nnon-hierarchical steerage. The EU is involved through capacity building and conditionality,\nwhilst American involvement is mainly operationalised through donations aimed at building\nstate institutions, but also helping to facilitate privatisation of state industries. These two\npositions converge and diverge: as we explore below, donations from the US are not as\nexplicitly tied to bargaining and normative change in environmental and energy issues to\nthe extent that EU assistance is. The US also plays a strong role in market liberalisation,\nwhich at times undermines the EU's efforts at strengthening state capacity for environmental\ngovernance. The influence of key external actors is often exerted through non-hierarchical\nmodes of coordination such as negotiation, lobbying, informal challenges to implementation,\nand normative pressure, with formal rules often interacting with informal practices.\nThe emergent unconsolidated model is the result of an unsystematic involvement of\nexternal actors, seemingly with no overall agreement or goal for the direction of Kosovan\nenvironmental governance, interference from Serbia, little support from domestic political\nelites, no meaningful opportunities for non-state actor involvement and, to an extent, informal\npractices such as corruption which are prevalent in the energy sector across the Western\nchange in environmental governance, primarily through monitoring Kosovo's compliance\nwith the environment acquis, this has often been in cooperation and competition with other\ninternational actors. We find that non-state actors, such as non-governmental organisations\n(NGOs), have very little lobbying capacity in environmental and energy policy making in\nKosovo, reflecting broader Western Balkan trends.\nThis paper is based on the analysis of documentary resources, including institutional reports\nfrom the main energy provider in Kosovo, local civil society organisations, EU, and domestic\nlegislation. These are complemented by data from elite interviews and informal, non-recorded\ndiscussions with professionals within the field of regulatory governance in Kosovo.\nThe article first outlines the key concepts used and discusses the definitions of governance,\nand hierarchical and non-hierarchical coordination. Following Risse (2011) and Schneckener\n(2011), we also outline how these may be affected in areas of `limited statehood' such as\nKosovo. We then explore environmental governance in Kosovo, focusing on the energy\nsector and its regulation as a key component. The article then examines the extent to which\nexternal actors \u00ad the EU, USA, and Serbia \u00ad impact non-hierarchical coordination of this\npolicy area and its implementation.\nHierarchical and non-hierarchical modes of coordination in areas of\nlimited domestic sovereignty\nEmerging modes of environmental governance in Kosovo must be viewed in the broader\ncontext of post-Communist energy transitions (Bouzarovski, 2009) discussed below, and\ngovernance and statebuilding since the 2000 UN intervention. Kosovo is an apt example\nof an `area of limited statehood' (Risse, 2011): It has strong but not universal international\nrecognition, and this has direct impact on its `domestic sovereignty'as its authority structures\nEnvironmental governance in a contested state 937\nare not autonomously determined (Krasner and Risse, 2014: 545). Such areas of limited\nstatehood are also defined by the state's lack of capacity to `implement and enforce central\ndecisions, and a monopoly on the use of force' (Risse, 2011: 2).\nIn areas of `limited statehood', modes of governance and coordination may deviate from\nthe models seen in Western liberal democratic states. Whereas the latter will typically involve\nhierarchical steering and `authoritatively enforcing the law' through `\"top-down\" command\nand control' (Risse, 2011: 11), governance in areas of limited domestic sovereignty tends to be\nstatehood, as Krasner and Risse (2014: 546) argue, external involvement is significant, since some\nof the functions `traditionally associated with the state, have been assumed by external actors'.\nStatehood and sovereignty can be limited territorially (i.e. the government not exercising authority\nor control over a part of the country) or sectorally (i.e. specific policy areas maybe under the direct\njurisdiction of external agencies). Both types apply in Kosovo's case: Kosovo has only limited\nterritorial control (in virtually all policy areas) of North Kosovo, where Serbia intervenes actively;\nthe Pristina government also has limited sectoral autonomy in a number of policy domains in\nwhich there is a high level of external involvement. Environmental governance is one such policy\narea, since change has often been initiated and led by the UN or the EU.\nDue to a lack of capacity to enforce decisions, Risse argues, international actors frequently\n`interfere authoritatively' in areas of limited statehood, thus making non-hierarchical modes\nof coordination `more common' (B\u00f6rzel and Risse, 2010: 211). Frequently, as in Kosovo,\nthese interventions are framed in terms of `state building', designed to `tackle limited\nstatehood directly' through capacity and institution building (Krasner and Risse, 2014: 551),\nand `trusteeship' of external actors temporarily executing authority in the state (Lake and\nFariss, 2014: 571). Previously, under the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK),\nKosovo was subject to trusteeship. However, the current arrangements and involvement of\nthe EU through the Rule of Law Mission (EULEX) are more in line with what Krasner and\nRisse label as `contracting': external control through delegation or agreement (2014: 552).\nThe reality of statebuilding `on the ground' is the involvement of a number of external actors\nand organisations each attempting to influence governance and pursuing different and at\ntimes conflicting agendas (Schneckener, 2011). We identify such tensions between the EU\nand the US in terms of their priorities for the Kosovan energy sector.\nWith regard to defining governance, we follow B\u00f6rzel and Risse's (2010: 114)\nconceptualisation of a process that `pinpoints the modes of social coordination by which\nactors engage in rulemaking and implementation', norm adoption, and social learning.\nGovernance is also exercised through informal practices existing outside of the hierarchy and\ncan be shaped by local interests and governance `spoilers'(Menkhaus, 2007). In the Kosovan\ncase, formal rules are subject to and compete with informal practices, including corruption,\nclientelism, and non-consensual interference from Serbia.\nWe also adopt B\u00f6rzel and Risse's (2010: 114) distinctions of hierarchical and non-\nhierarchical coordination, in which hierarchical coordination `usually takes the form of\nauthoritative decisions with claims to legitimacy', such as laws. Non-hierarchical coordination\nis `based on voluntary commitment and compliance'and other dispute-resolving mechanisms\nsuch as bargaining and arguing (B\u00f6rzel and Risse, 2010: 114). Importantly, according to the\nauthors, in non-hierarchical coordination, actors may have unequal bargaining power but `no\nactor is subject to the commands of others' (B\u00f6rzel and Risse, 2010: 114).\nEnergy as an area of environmental governance\nGiven that environmental governance can be defined as a `broad range of political, economic\nand social structures and processes that shape and constrain actors' behaviour towards the\nenvironment' (Levy and Newell, 2005: 2), it follows that the energy sector and its regulation\n938 J Obradovic-Wochnik, A Dodds\nform an important part of this process, since energy policies have an immediate and long-\nterm impact on the domestic and regional environment (cf. Cast\u00e1n Broto et al., 2009).\nEnvironmental governance implies both `rule creating, institution building...monitoring and\nenforcement' but also a `soft infrastructure of norms, expectations and social understandings\nof acceptable behaviour towards the environment' (Levy and Newell, 2005: 3).\nThe impact of the energy sector on the environment is especially evident in areas where\nthis sector and related businesses contribute significantly to pollution (c.f. Levy and Newell,\n2005: 1). In Kosovo, old and inefficient power plants are the largest source of air pollution\nand have not until recently been subjected to the legal regulation applied within Western\nEurope. Efforts to regulate, modernise, and clean up the key polluting agents in the energy\nsector have coincided with Kosovo's recent push for EU membership.\nThe modernisation of Kosovo's energy sector and the development of environmental\ngovernance have both been hindered by the country's history of conflict and post-Yugoslav\neconomic transition. Kosovo's energy supply was part of theYugoslav network until the 1990s\nand was shaped by Communist economic practices during this time. Most post-Communist\ncountries, Bouzarovski (2009) argues, share general features of centrally planned energy\npolicies and their subsequent transitions. This initially included attempts to lessen reliance\non Soviet imports (and therefore a heavy use of domestic natural resources such as lignite)\nand a system of cross-subsidised tariffs which ensured low prices for domestic consumers\n(Bouzarovski, 2009: 457). As with other post-Communist states, Kosovo is subject to\nneoliberal restructuring, `reinforced' by EU accession (Bouzarovski, 2009: 458) of which\nenergy policy is part. This includes `\"unbundling' integrated energy companies', `removing\nsubsidies, liberalizing the tariff structure and allowing free access to the energy market',\nwith foreign companies often envisaged as the buyers of formerly state-owned energy assets\nmet with political resistance and state interference by governments `unwilling to relinquish\ncontrol of...key political and economic instruments of power' (Bouzarovski, 2009: 458).\nWithin this context, the availability of lignite in Kosovo was used to develop two power\nplants, Kosovo A and B, during the Yugoslav times. Other plants were developed using fuel\noil and (to a limited extent) hydropower. Plans have been developed for the closure of the\nhuge Kosovo A plant in 2017 once alternative generating capacity comes on stream, although\nthe timetable for this is currently unclear (Balkan Investigative Reporting Network, BIRN,\nMeasures to improve the stability of the highly erratic supply and increase its volume\nhave involved further developing the use of hydropower. This has required the construction\nof additional power plants, including the Zhur plant and other plants in Belaja, De\u00e7an, and\nLumbhardi. It has also resulted in the adoption of renewable energy (which until now has\nbeen limited, partly due to the failure of international investors to carry out wind surveys\nor to have agreed a feed-in tariff with the regulator, prior to installation). Aside from small\ngeneration plants, the Kosovan Energy Corporation (KEK), which was established in 2005,\ngenerates almost all of the energy. In an attempt to liberalise the sector and attract investment,\nboth the Kosovan energy transmission network (KOST) and Kosovo Electricity Distribution\nand Supply, which covers distribution and supply, have been unbundled from KEK. The\nlatter was privatised in 2012 and sold to the Turkish \u00c7alik-Limak consortium of companies.\nThe energy sector is by far the largest polluter in Kosovo, with claims that KosovoAis the\n`worst, single-point source of pollution in Europe' (BIRN, 2014). The Environment Ministry\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (KEPA) report (2011: 24) states that CO2\nemissions from\nthe total coal use for operating Kosovo A and B are estimated at five million tonnes per\nyear, with additional pollutants such as dust, sulphur dioxide (SO2\n), and NOX\ncontributing\nconsiderably to air pollution. These emissions are significantly above those suggested by the\nEnvironmental governance in a contested state 939\nEnergy Community's Athens Memorandum, a 2002 document which governs South East\nEurope's electricity market integration.1 For instance, dust emissions from the Kosovo A\npower plant are some 18 times higher than the Athens limits, whilst NOX\nlevels from Kosovo\nB are some 1.6 times higher (KEPA, 2011: 24). This situation reflects general Western\nBalkan trends, where concerns over energy supply and growing domestic demand are often\nprioritised over environmental issues (c.f. Hakala and J\u00e4rvinen, 2012: 40).\nEnvironmental governance and energy policy in Kosovo\nAt first glance, Kosovo appears to have a model of environmental governance in which a\nnumber of state and non-state actors coexist in an institutionalised2 and emergent hierarchy.\nHowever, as this section illustrates, the hierarchy is, in fact, weak. Moreover, the formal\ndistribution of power is not reflected in practice, due to the involvement of external actors\nand their incentives, which make the government of Kosovo responsive to international\nrather than domestic demands.\nWithin the formal legal and regulatory environment (i.e. hierarchical coordination)\nin Kosovo, interactions among state and non-state actors are governed by a complex and\nfragmented web of legislation. Hierarchy is obvious among state actors, including: the\nAssembly of the Republic of Kosovo; the Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning\n(MESP); its agency, KEPA; and municipalities. The overall legislative role of the\nKosovan Assembly (parliament) defines the remits of MESP and monitors its functions\nand administration of environmental resources (Assembly Support Initiative, 2007). The\nAssembly passes environmental laws and legislation which are translated into policies by\nMESP. Each environmental sector such as water, air, and waste has its own legal framework.\nThe creation of this hierarchy involved a degree of external, non-hierarchical steering: the\nMESP was one of the ministries established through UNMIK regulation in 2002.\nThe majority of Kosovo's energy and environmental laws were adopted by the National\nAssembly after Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008. Until 2000, Kosovo was a\nby the UNMIK and through the Provisional Self-Government. Whilst the institutional context\nof the MESP existed prior to 2008, political debates throughout this period were dominated\nby independence-related issues, marginalising all other discussions, including environment\nand energy. Whilst it can be argued that the legislative context and architecture prior to 2008\nwere lacking in capacity to implement environmental governance, they nonetheless enabled\nthe adoption of several key laws in the areas of both environment and energy. For instance,\nlaws on air protection, energy, electricity, and water were passed in 2004, with laws on\nnature conservation, waste, and plant protection following in 2005 and 2007, respectively.\nAdditionally, the MESP prepared a Kosovo Environmental Action Plan 2006\u00ad2010 in April\nsteered non-hierarchically by an external actor, the Swedish International Development\nCorporation Agency. It is geared towards environmental improvement and protection, within\nthe framework of the policy harmonisation required by the environmental acquis and EU\nThe Memorandum is officially known as the `Memorandum of Understanding on the Regional\nElectricity Market in South East Europe and its Integration into the European Union Internal Electricity\nMarket', signed by countries of the Western Balkans, as well as Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, and the\nEuropean Commission.\n2Institutions in this context can be broadly perceived as all forms of formal and informal rules that\ngovern actors' interactions within Kosovan environmental governance, which includes environmental\nlaws, regulations, and forms of informal interaction.\n940 J Obradovic-Wochnik, A Dodds\nThe MESP has significant authority in environmental governance: it is responsible for\ndeveloping standards to control emissions and for promoting sustainable environmental\npractices and use of natural sources. Current environmental priorities, stated in the 2010\u00ad\n2015 Environmental Strategy and Action Plan, are meeting the EU acquis, partly through\nnew and strengthened institutions, capacity building, and financial incentives for domestic\nindustries (World Bank, undated).\nThe Energy Regulatory Office (ERO) was also established under UNMIK as a self-\nfinanced and independent body responsible for drafting secondary legislation, with the\ngovernment only responsible for setting overall strategy. The ERO issues licenses to energy\ngenerators and transmitters, and reviews electricity tariffs. Other related bodies include\nnon-majoritarian institutions such as the Kosovo Privatisation Agency and the Independent\nCommission for Mines and Minerals. In common with energy policy in many developing\nnations, these non-majoritarian institutions have been created whilst state ownership remained\nof much of KEK and KOSTT.\nA number of non-state actors operate within this energy governance landscape, including\nNGOs and international private consultancy companies (discussed below). Whilst many\nenvironmental NGOs, such as Millennium and Ecocult, appear to be well established\nand efficacious, our research found no evidence that they undertook effective lobbying\nof key decision makers. In general, civil society in Kosovo has only just begun to engage\nin advocacy (USAID, 2013: 2), and this is reflected in the lack of organised lobbying.\nAdditionally, international donations for NGOs have declined in recent years, as the donor\nfocus has shifted from Kosovo to the Middle East and the Caucasus (Freedom House, 2013).\nHowever, the absence of a strong tier of lobbying organisations is also due to the fact that\nmost environmental NGOs are primarily involved in local conservation projects or education\nactivities.Moreover,thevalueoflobbyingisperhapsnotimmediatelyclear:theenvironmental\ngovernance institutions, which are the obvious focus of lobbying, are not seen as key decision\nmakers, but as implementing partners for EU rules and demands. Furthermore, there is some\nevidence of the ability of NGOs to mobilise around certain issues. In particular, the alleged\ninvolvement of the government and other key elites in corruption often acts as a focus for\ncivil society protest. For instance, one case in which NGOs have demonstrated a capacity to\nmobilise large-scale public protest has been the dispute over high energy tariffs and alleged\ncorruption at KEK.3\nDespite some civil society activism around environmental issues, political interest\nand debate still focuses primarily on issues of sovereignty, nationhood, and minority\nrights. Amongst political elites there appears to be little or no interest in environmental or\nenergy issues, and thus do not respond to these pressures. Political power is won and held\naccording to party, ethnic, or regional loyalty (i.e. informal practices resulting in governance,\nc.f. Menkhaus, 2007). This, together with alleged corruption amongst the political elite,\nespecially where it relates to the energy sector and privatisation (Freedom House, 2013;\nPrelec, 2014) leaves little room for civil society actors to influence political agendas on\nalready marginalised issues such as the environment. This supports the findings of Tosun and\nShulze (this volume), who suggest that the emergence of forms of environmental governance\nis dependent on domestic interest constellations, and their ability to exert leverage within\nthe policy process. In Kosovo, domestic interest groups are weak, because: their power\nis undermined by informal practices of key power holders, which makes lobbying almost\n3According to ERO staff (authors' interview with ERO official, Pristina, 15 April 2013), the majority\nof Kosovan consumers find that the electricity bill constitutes their single largest monthly expense.\nKosovo's official unemployment rate is 35.1%. Moreover, 34.5% of the population live in `general\npoverty', whilst 12.1% live in `extreme poverty'.

This is most obvious in the case of the EU, which is helping to build and\nstrengthen hierarchy. However, the involvement of external actors is not linear and is at times\ncontradictory. As this paper demonstrates, USA (with its focus on privatisation and market\nliberalisation) and Serbia (with its informal practices), often weaken Kosovo's hierarchical\ngovernance, which, in turn, undermines EU efforts.\nDomestic mechanisms of environmental governance operate within a complex formal\nframework derived from the EU's extensive involvement. Kosovo is a typical `environmental\nnewcomer' with lower levels of environmental regulation, higher industrial pollution, and\nhigh implementation costs for meeting EU environmental rules and norms (B\u00f6rzel, 2009: 33).\nBroadly speaking, the EU helps to build hierarchical governance in Kosovo by strengthening\nstate institutions and enhancing domestic sovereignty. This is predominantly carried out\nthrough rule and norm transfer, some of which takes place via the Energy Community\nAs Padgett (2011) explains, the Energy Community and the internal market are at the\ncentre of the EU's framework of cooperation with neighbouring suppliers and consumers.\nThe overall aim is to ensure a steady and reliable energy supply. The Community is not an\nextension of the EU, but it is `ingeniously designed to bind non-Member States to EU law\nwithout admitting them to EU institutions' (Padgett, 2011: 1077) and has helped to create\nan integrated regional electricity market across the Western Balkans. Whilst governance\nis concerned with norms and learning as well as with rules (B\u00f6rzel and Risse, 2010), the\nEnergy Treaty places a strong emphasis on rule adoption; it is an example of non-hierarchical\n`external governance' (Renner and Trauner, 2009: 458) where participation helps countries\nKosovo's record in meeting requirements such as establishing stable regulatory and\nmarket frameworks is patchy. Environmental issues are still largely neglected by domestic\nstate actors. Opinion polls indicate that 69.9% of the public is dissatisfied with Kosovo's\nefforts to preserve the environment (Gallup Balkan Monitor, 2012). This is despite the fact\nthat, on paper, Kosovo has already started to harmonise its environmental laws with EU\nstandards, for example, through the 2009 Law on Environmental Protection, which stipulates\nexplicitly that the government will `adapt the legal requests and procedures' on environment\nand sustainable development to fit with the EU environmental acquis. The government\nof Kosovo and the MESP are obliged to mainstream environmental protection into their\nrespective policies within the framework of EU integration (European Commission, 2012).\nWhilst the EU sets this out as a condition of membership, this too represents an example of\nnon-hierarchical steering, since the EU does not `command and control' Kosovo (B\u00f6rzel and\nRisse, 2010: 115). Although conditionality means that sanctions (e.g. denial of membership)\ncan be applied to states that do not comply with EU's demands, the role and effectiveness\nof conditionality in compliance are contested (e.g. Aybet and Bieber, 2011; Pickering, 2011;\nSpoerri, 2011; Subotic, 2009). The existing literature suggests that domestic actors frequently\n`go through the motions' of compliance whilst neglecting normative change (Subotic, 2009:\n167), and that conditionality sometimes leads to `short term changes that the EU would\nOne effect of the EU's involvement is that the model of environmental governance\nemerging in Kosovo is highly institutionalised, but `on paper' only. Post-independence\ngovernments `go through the motions' of adopting environmental protection laws (and\n942 J Obradovic-Wochnik, A Dodds\nresponding to non-hierarchical steering) but without really remaining committed to the issues\n(i.e. not responding to EU environmental norms), or creating meaningful opportunities for\nnon-state actors, such as NGOs, to participate in debate and decision making (c.f. USAID,\n2013: 2\u00ad3).This has the effect that the Kosovan governments will respond only selectively to a\nwhole range of environmental challenges, prioritising only those that align with EU demands.\nFor instance, the spate of additional environmental and energy laws post-2008 closely reflect\nEU concerns regarding the environmental impact of lignite use in Kosovo as documented\nin earlier Commission reports (European Commission, 2012). As recently as 2012, the\nCommission made an explicit link between air quality, the energy sector, and environmental\ngovernance in its Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo. It was explicitly\nstated that the adoption of the energy acquis, reform of KOSTT, and the establishment of\na more efficient energy regulator were necessary to improve overall environmental quality,\nsince `lignite power plants are the main source of air pollutants' (2012: 46). Whilst the\nCommission noted that laws and frameworks in the fields of energy and the environment\nare in place, it criticised the (lack of) `capacity to implement and enforce legislation (which)\nneeds to be strengthened'. The report adds that Kosovo needs to `close the Kosovo A power\nplant, in line with its Energy Community Treaty obligations' in order to improve air quality\n(2012: 46) and that `environmental considerations need to be mainstreamed into other\nthat this has not been done: the Commission stated in 2014 that Kosovo's implementation of\nenvironmental laws remains weak, as does the administrative capacity of institutions in the\nenvironmental sector (Commission, 2014: 40\u00ad41).As an example highlighting the disconnect\nbetween environmental laws and their implementation, the Commission (2014: 41) noted\nthat an `eco tax' collected during car registrations contributes to the Kosovo budget but `is\nnot allocated to any environmental projects'. In 2014, the EU also warned that Kosovo's\nfailure to close Kosovo A is jeopardising the 60m `green energy grant' set aside for the\nThe EU also seeks to shape environmental and energy governance through institution\nbuilding to increase Kosovo's own capacities. In the energy sphere, the EU (together with\nthe US and others) is partly responsible for the creation of KOSTT out of KEK (European\nCommission, 2009). The effect of this involvement has been a limited domestic capacity\nfor enforcing authority structures, since the unbundling and creation of various ministries\nwere not wholly locally initiatives. Generally, EU's statebuilding focus in Kosovo can be\ndescribed, following Schneckener (2011), as a mixture of `Liberalisation first', `Security\nFirst', and `Institutionalisation First'. Through EULEX, the EU aims to strengthen both\nsecurity and domestic institutions such as the judiciary; additionally, its norm promotion\nin the region means that an emphasis is also placed on political and market liberalisation\n(Schneckener, 2011: 236). At times, these priorities have differed to those of the US donors,\nespecially in the field of energy, where market liberalisation rather than environmental norms\nis pursued, as discussed below. This illustrates that international actors involved in local\ngovernance often `pull' in different directions (Schneckener, 2011: 230). This also applies to\nlocal actors, since governance is often underscored by `evolving interests' and struggles for\nThe EU's non-hierarchical shaping of environmental governance in Kosovo extends in\nother capacity-building and `learning' (B\u00f6rzel and Risse, 2010: 11) directions as well. The\nEU financed several environmental projects and collaborated with different state and non-\nstate actors in an attempt to build up the capacities of the environmental sector.

As\nB\u00f6rzel and Risse (2010: 11) point out, incentives and benchmarking are important aspects\nof non-hierarchical steering, together with `communicative learning processes', which are\nnot as explicitly articulated in American involvement in statebuilding in Kosovo. The EU is\ninvolved in environmental governance in Kosovo through this exchange and norm diffusion,\nor broadly speaking, `Europeanisation'(B\u00f6rzel and Risse, 2000). For Europeanisation to take\nplace, B\u00f6rzel and Risse (2000: 2) argue, there must be some `misfit' between European and\ndomestic policies. Due to the legacies of conflict and Communism, the Western Balkans are\nthought to diverge from EU policies and structures in more comprehensive ways than CEECs\n(Juncos, 2011). Kosovo's energy sector pollution levels are an instance of this divergence.\nThe effect of the EU's carrot and stick approach has largely been felt in the evolution of\ndomestic environmental institutions, laws, and hierarchies, which still lack the necessary\ndomestic capacity or willingness for their full implementation.\nExternal actors: United States\nThe US is also concerned with building hierarchical governance in Kosovo by strengthening\ninstitutions: this often takes place through development aid aimed at building institutions\nsuch as ministries. However, the US also encourages market liberalisation, and the policies\nhere are not always complementary to the EU's \u00ad and its own \u00ad attempts at strengthening\nthe hierarchy. The US has been heavily involved in Kosovo since the late 1990s and is still\nable to exert influence on domestic politics and determine key policy decisions, largely via a\nsignificant donor presence in the country and within the region.\nHowever, American non-hierarchical steering in Kosovo does not closely resemble that\nof the EU, since bargaining, incentives, and conditionality are not as evident, or at least, not\nas explicitly stated (e.g. in USAID (2013)). Some of Kosovo's key institutions \u00ad such as the\nMinistries of Finance and Energy and Mining (now defunct), the Central Bank of Kosovo,\nKEK, and ERO (USAID, 2010: 10) \u00ad were set up with significant input from USAID and\nother US donors. A large number of mainly US-funded consultants, including Deloitte,\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, Advanced Engineering Associates International, Mott MacDonald,\nand others operate in the Kosovan energy and regulatory space. For instance, the consultancy\nTetra Tech (funded by USAID) advises KEK on privatisation and operations, illustrating that\nin contrast to the EU, American assistance does not only go to NGOs, but also to businesses.\nAlthough figures for total US disbursements to Kosovo declined in 2010 and 2011,\naccording to the Balkan Civil Society Development Network (BCSDN), USAID is still the\nlargest bilateral donor, and its donations are exceeded only by multilateral aid from the EU\n(67m) and the World Bank (50m) (BCSDN, 2012). Significantly, compared to the other\ntwo large bilateral donors, Germany and Norway, far more of US aid to Kosovo is earmarked\nfor specific projects (including within the energy sector) \u00ad 73% in 2009 compared to 3.5% for\nGermany and 0% for Norway (OECD, 2012: 12), suggesting a greater degree of US control\nover aid in Kosovo.\nAmerican influence in Kosovo is not separate from the process of Europeanisation; rather,\nthe two interact through both cooperation and competition. For instance, USAID highlights\nthat the US government's goals are: `building institutions', encouraging `democratic process',\n944 J Obradovic-Wochnik, A Dodds\npromoting economic development, and the rule of law and European Integration (USAID, 2010:\n4). USAID specifically highlights that `all our assistance will contribute to support Kosovo's\nintegration into Europe' (USAID, 2010: 6, added emphasis). These goals resonate with EU\npolicy for the region and adopt the `Europeanisation'narrative. In contrast, other major non-EU\ndonors, such as the Norwegian government, focus less on European integration, and more on\npromotion of peace and human rights (The Norwegian Embassy Fund, 2011).\nDespite US support for EU integration, however, its policy preferences for Kosovo in\ngeneral, and the energy sector in particular, have not always coincided with those of the\nEU. For instance, within its broader goal of capacity building, USAID (2013: i) identifies\nof law and governance, (2) increased investment and private sector employment, and (3)\nenhanced human capital. This contrasts EU involvement, whose priorities are much more\ndiverse. The EU's priorities for Kosovo range from the political (normalisation of relations\nwith Serbia, minority rights, regional and international obligations) to economic and justice\nconcerns (including corruption and money laundering) (European Commission, 2014). In\nthe Commission progress reports, for instance, investment is integrated into economic and\ninternal market categories, suggesting that whilst the EU deems investment an important\nfactor for a functioning market economy, it is not singled out as a priority in its own right (e.g.\nThe different emphasis placed on investment and privatisation by EU and the USA\nhas, at times, had a knock-on effect on the energy sector. Developments surrounding the\nprivatisation of Kosovo B and rights to the new Kosovo C (`Kosova e Re') plant illustrate\nthis. Initially, the Kosovan government planned the development of a 2100 MW Kosovo C\nplant, which would have greatly increased energy generating capacity. It also planned that\nthe ownership and running of the new plant should be transferred together with ownership\nof Kosovo B and mining rights on a long-term basis (up to 40 years) to one single provider.\nHence, privatisation would have occurred without competition. This contrast with the EU's\nobjective of opening up electricity markets and limiting natural monopolies whilst at the\nsame time ensuring efficient regulation and `increased competition across and within borders'\n(Pollitt, 2009: 15). The EU criticised the plan on the basis that a foreign firm would hold a\nvirtual monopoly on Kosovo's electricity market, leading to higher tariffs (Xharra, 2012).\nHowever, the plans were allegedly supported by the US Embassy.4 The government made\nattempts to remove the Energy Regulator Office's involvement in the process of assigning\ntenders for the construction of this new generating capacity that were, however, rebuffed\nwithin the Parliamentary Assembly (International Civilian Office, 2009: 8). Nonetheless, the\nKosovan government has made little progress in the privatisation and construction of Kosovo\nC. The plans were later reviewed by the World Bank (2011) with suggestions for a mix of\nthermal and renewable sources, a scaled-down 600 MW Kosovo C, the opening of a new\nlignite mine, closure of Kosovo A, and the refurbishment of Kosovo B. Even the new plans,\nhowever, involve only a limited degree of liberalisation and are the focus of civil society\nThis episode illustrates the influence of US involvement in Kosovo in general, and energy\nand environmental governance in particular. The originally proposed Kosovo C would have\nrequired 15% of Kosovan landmass for open cast mining, ash dumps, and power plants. This\noriginal plan matches with investors' focus on lignite which is the `least expensive thermal\noption, even when the ... higher environmental costs are priced in' (World Bank, 2011:\nv). In addition to the environmental degradation, the pollution resultant from this project\nwould have violated the Athens agreement and would not have been in line with EU's vision\n4Authors' interview with civil society activist, 29 June 2011, Pristina.\nEnvironmental governance in a contested state 945\nfor liberalised electricity markets (c.f. Pollitt, 2009). This was used as the legal basis for\nopposition to the plan by civil society organisations, which persuaded the EU to support their\nposition against the plan.5\nA further source of tension between the EU and US, which has an impact on\nenvironmental governance in Kosovo, is that American donors appear to place less emphasis\non the environment in their programming. For instance, whilst USAID prioritises energy\nsupply projects in Kosovo, and is still committed to Kosovo C, it does not place as much\nemphasis on environmental issues, or encourage and require Kosovo to strengthen its energy\nlaws and regulation. In fact, a number of actors, notably the World Bank and the European\nBank for Reconstruction and Development \u00ad where the US is a major donor \u00ad have been\ncriticised for investing heavily in Western Balkan energy projects that deviate from EU\nenvironmental standards (Gallop, 2013). This concerns the proposed Kosovo C plant, which\nwould disincentivise Kosovo from reaching its 2020 renewables target (25%), committed to\nthrough the Energy Community (Gallop, 2013).\nThe case of Kosovo C illustrates the divergence between EU and US agendas. Whilst\nthere is a shared commitment to stabilising Kosovo through EU integration, US donors focus\nmore on market liberalisation through investment, with far less concern with environmental\ngovernance. The overall effect of this for environmental governance is that a lack of\ncoherence \u00ad and the absence of consistent normative pressure from both actors \u00ad weakens\nthe environmental governance `message'. It also undermines EU efforts to build hierarchical\ncapacities in this sector.\nExternal actors: Serbia\nTheEU'sattemptsatstrengtheninghierarchicalenvironmentalgovernancearealsoundermined\nby Serbia's non-consensual and informal involvement in the Kosovan energy space. Unlike\nthe EU and the US, Serbia does not have an interest in enabling governance in Kosovo, but\nrather, sabotaging domestic governance efforts. The implication of this for environmental\ngovernance is the further weakening of (already weak) Kosovan hierarchical steerage.\nSerbia's involvement stems from its non-recognition of Kosovo's independence, and its\nsubsequent attempts to limit Kosovo's statehood and capacity to enforce decisions (c.f. Risse,\n2011). Since 2000, Serbia has had no formal decision-making power in Kosovo. Nevertheless,\nSerbia has continually attempted to interfere in Kosovo's domestic affairs and thus limit its\nstatehood.\nSerbia's contestation of Kosovo's independence has informal effects on Kosovo's ability\nto enact domestic sovereignty on parts of its territory (c.f. Krasner and Risse, 2014: 549).\nFor instance, Serbia finances informal `parallel institutions' in Serb majority areas of North\nSerbia's influence means that Kosovan institutions (which govern over all their assigned\ncompetencies such as regulation) have little or no authority, legitimacy, and significance in\nthe routine running of the North (see Krasniqi, 2012). Whilst this is most visible in elections\n(whereby Northern Kosovo Serbs tend to vote in Serbian, rather than Kosovan elections)\nand public service provision, it also has important consequences for the energy sector and\nenvironmental governance.\nOne instance where informal practices undermine formal rules is in the case of electricity\nbill non-payment, which is particularly acute in the North according to ERO officials.7\n5Authors' interview with civil society activist, 29 June 2011, Pristina.\n6This figure is likely to have decreased since 2011; however, it is difficult to find a precise, up-to-date\nnumber as this funding is often unclear and contested.\n946 J Obradovic-Wochnik, A Dodds\nof the total electricity consumption (ERO, 2012: 34). Three areas of electricity supply have\nbeen created by KEK \u00adA, B, and C \u00ad corresponding to the degree of non-payment. In `A'areas,\nelectricity is less frequently cut off than in B and C areas. Mitrovica (partly in Serb-majority\nNorth Kosovo) is reported to have commercial losses of 48% in 2009, largely due to KEK's\n`inability to carry out billing and collection activities' in North Mitrovica (ERO, 2012). Non-\npayment in Serb majority areas, whilst partly due to the region's high unemployment rate and\na relatively poor population, is also encouraged by the official Serbian policy of contesting\nand denying the authority of all Kosovan institutions and (public) services. Furthermore,\nthere is also a `Serbian power utility maintaining an unlicensed branch' in the North which\nhinders Kosovo's management of its power system (European Commission, 2012: 45).\nIn addition, the Kosovan energy sector is shaped by its connections with the former\nYugoslav grid, some of which is effectively controlled by Serbian actors. For instance,\nthe North includes power facilities such as those on Mount Kopaonik and the `Ujmani'\nhydropower plant. Furthermore, water from Gazivoda Lake (bordering Serbia) is used to cool\nthe Kosovo B power plant. Kosovo thus has to rely on good relations with Serbia to ensure\nthe smooth running of these operations. Kosovan policy makers have tried to overcome the\nconstraints this imposes on independent decision making on energy by creating an energy\nsupply connection with neighbouring Albania (Sahiti, 2012: 11).\nFurthermore, in 2010, the Energy Community Secretariat ruled that Serbia is in breach of\nagreed regulations, since it had not paid the relevant electricity transit fees to KOSTT, despite\na set of mutual agreements governing the relationship between KOSTT and the Serbian\ntransmission network operator, EMS (BIRN, 2014).\nIn 2014, EMS and KOSTT signed a framework agreement regarding commercial and\noperational relations between the two companies, which should also help resolve energy\nissues in the North (BIRN, 2014). However, the agreement is not yet fully operational (BIRN,\n2014), and the energy sector thus remains one of the last remaining spheres through which\nSerbia can infiltrate Kosovo and create challenges to governance.\nSerbia's non-consensual involvement in the energy space in Kosovo is informal and\nis often denied by Kosovo's energy officials.8 It does not form an attempt at governance\nas such: Serbia has no authority to unilaterally impose decisions on Kosovo, nor does\nit offer positive incentives, bargaining, and learning opportunities. However, in some\ncases, for instance, running parallel institutions in the North, Serbia behaves as though it\nhas authority to govern hierarchically. This has predominantly resulted from an attempt\nto project its power and control into its former province and less from any real interest\nin local affairs. This illustrates clearly the notion that governance is not simply about\nthe establishment of hierarchies, rules, and steering but often involves localised power\nAlthough Serbia has no real authority in Kosovo and its decision making, its non-\nconsensual involvement in energy matters decreases Kosovo's capacity to implement all\nrules and decisions pertaining to this sector. Serbia is, in effect, a governance `spoiler'\n(see Menkhaus, 2007). This also politicises the energy sector, drawing both parties into\nprotracted debates over resource control and revenue and detracting Kosovan authorities'\nattention further away from mainstreaming energy into environmental policies. The effect\nof Serbia's informal practices is a reduced ability of Kosovo to autonomously operate and\nregulate its energy market and supply, further destabilising an already unconsolidated model\nof environmental governance.\nEnvironmental governance in a contested state 947\nConclusion\nWhen the variety of different institutions and actors and their formal and informal inputs\ninto policy making are considered, energy policy as an aspect of environmental governance\nin Kosovo appears exceedingly complex. The emerging model of environmental governance\nseems to be characterised by a weak hierarchy, mainly as a result of external actor involvement,\nwith policy change being driven primarily by donor preferences and EU conditionality, rather\nthan domestic debate and demands. Above all, the weakness of hierarchy reflects a lack of\ndomestic state capacity \u00ad further weakened by the informal and non-consensual involvement\nof Serbia \u00ad and the weakness of non-state actors.\nWhilst it might be assumed that the presence and influence of international actors would\nprovide an opportunity for non-state actors to exert influence and to lobby at multiple\nlevels, the case of Kosovo C demonstrates that this is not necessarily the case. Rather than\nempowering domestic non-state actors, the presence of multiple external actors actually\nenables the Kosovan government to respond directly to the particular external agenda it\nfavours and to resist the demands of civil society or indeed other external interests. Yet,\nas our case study demonstrates, despite a broad consensus shared by donors regarding\nthe need for liberalisation and greater environmental regulation, the critical divergence\nbetween the EU and the US has stymied the Commission's attempts to achieve more\nprogressive environmental reforms.\nWhat the case study seems to confirm is that the extensive involvement of external actors\nis no substitute for the weakness of state institutions and the lack of hierarchy. Domestic non-\nstate actors seem to suffer most: they appear to be excluded from the critical (and somewhat\ncovert) interaction between external actors and the Kosovan government. Thus, what may\nat first glance appear to be a model of progressive multi-level steering is in fact a mirage:\nextensive external involvement and the lack of domestic sovereignty and capacity leaves\nenvironmental governance in Kosovo vulnerable to informal practices which undermine\nstatebuilding efforts and external actors' attempts at strengthening hierarchy. Informal\npractices such as interference from Serbia, and clientelism inherent in domestic politics,\ncreate a context in which environmental interests are subordinated to local power struggles\nor are irrelevant for political campaigns and re-election, and thus further weaken hierarchical\nsteerage of environmental governance.\n"
