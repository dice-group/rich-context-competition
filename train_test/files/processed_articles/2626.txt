At an extreme, this takes the form of substantially higher female\nmortality rates than male mortality rates, as well as the increasing use\nof sex-selective abortion to remove daughters from a household before\nbirth. To give a sense of the magnitude of the excess female mortality\nproblem, Daniel Rosenblum (2013) finds that the mortality rates for\nchildren between 1 and 60 months of age is 5.8 percent for girls and 3.9\npercent for boys. The problem is even more striking than the almost 2\npercentage points difference in mortality rates would suggest because boys\nare biologically weaker than girls. In developed countries, men have higher\nmortality rates than women at all ages. That is, without discrimination, we\nshould observe higher male than female mortality rates.\nARTICLE\nSeveral recent papers have estimated the large number of female sex-\nselective abortions in India. Prabhat Jha, Rajesh Kumar, Priya Vasa, Neeraj\nDhingra, Deva Thiruchelvam, and Rahim Moineddin (2006), Prabhat\nJha, Maya A. Kesler, Rajesh Kumar, Faujdar Ram, Usha Ram, Lukasz\nAleksandowicz, Diego G. Bassani, Shailaja Chandra, and Jayant K. Banthia\nestimates of close to 500,000 selective abortions per year in India \u00ad\nabout 2 percent of annual pregnancies. Sex selection and excess female\nmortality are prevalent enough to skew the sex ratio of men to women far\nabove the rates seen in developed countries and are a major concern for\npolicymakers.\nAlthough it is not a new idea that discrimination against women occurs\nfor economic reasons, this article is the first to estimate the magnitude of\nthe private economic benefits of a son relative to a daughter in India. I\ntest these economic benefits using the plausibly exogenous sex outcome\nof a first birth in India. If parents in India are not selectively aborting\ntheir first pregnancies, then the average difference between economic\noutcomes of households with a first-born boy and those with a first-born\ngirl is an unbiased estimate of the average effect of giving birth to a son\nat the first pregnancy rather than a daughter. The overall goal of this\nresearch is to determine how economic incentives cause discrimination.\nThus, I also investigate whether patterns in the relative value of sons can\nplausibly explain the variation across India in the prevalence of sex-selective\nabortion.\nI estimate that having a first-born son instead of a daughter increases\nper capita yearly income, per capita monthly expenditures, and household\nassets, while reducing the probability that the household is below the\npoverty line. The economic value of a son is likely different at higher\nparities. And, in particular, the economic value of a son likely rises with\nthe number of previously born daughters and falls with the number of\npreviously born sons. Thus, one can think of the estimated economic\nbenefit of a son versus a daughter at the first parity as a lower bound on the\neconomic benefit of a son for a household with no previously born sons.\nThere are a number of hypothesized mechanisms for the benefits of sons\nin India. Mary Elizabeth Shepherd (2008) summarizes several of these,\nincluding greater men's participation in agriculture and in the labor force\nin general, lower marriage costs for sons,1 and the cultural convention of\nsons rather than daughters providing financial support in old age. There is\nwide variation in cultural practices across India. For example, some groups\npractice bride price rather than dowry, and some groups have a tradition\nof matrilineal rather than patrilineal inheritance rights. I compare the\nestimated net economic benefits of a son across regions to investigate some\nof these cultural differences. What we call \"economics\" and what we call\n\"culture\" are interrelated here. For example, the cultural conventions of\njoint households where sons live with their parents even after marriage and\ndaughters move sometimes a great distance to live with their in-laws could\nbe the reason for the strong relative economic value of sons. I take the\ncultural context as given, and examine the economic value of sons within\nthis context.\nAlthough the determination of the exact mechanisms that cause sons\nto be valuable is outside the scope of this paper, I investigate two related\nmechanisms by comparing the relative economic value of a first-born son\nfor younger and older parents. The first mechanism is the additional\nhousehold labor supplied by a son. I find that if older parents have a\nfirst-born son, they have more workers in the household and are, thus,\nsignificantly better off in terms of household income and wealth than\nparents with a first-born daughter. The second mechanism is the effect of\na son on household composition. Parents with a first-born son have fewer\nchildren on average, and this is one reason that parents are better off in\nper capita terms when their son is young. Shelley Clark (2000) shows that\nmany parents in India follow son-preferring fertility-stopping rules, where\nthe birth of a daughter causes parents to have more children in the hopes\nof having one or more sons. Although a first-born son causes fewer children\nto be born, this son also increases the number of household members when\nparents are older because a daughter leaves when married, and a son adds a\ndaughter-in-law and grandchildren to the household, which may decrease\nthe economic benefits of a son in per capita terms. I compare different\nequivalence scales to examine how these composition effects change the\ninterpretation of the estimates. Regardless of the equivalence scale, a first-\nborn son always has a positive average economic effect on the household\nfor some age groups and never has a negative effect.\nIn addition, I examine heterogeneity in the benefits of a son relative to a\ndaughter across regions and demographic groups. I use these estimates to\nexamine whether patterns in economic incentives can help to explain the\nobserved variation in sex selection across Indian regions and demographic\ngroups. Last, I focus on economic differences between households with\na second-born son compared to a second-born daughter, conditional on\nthe sex of the first-born child. I find that a second-born son provides no\neconomic benefit if the first-born child is male. This finding of diminishing\nreturns to sons helps to explain why parents do not sex select at the first\nparity and why there is no demographic evidence in India of sex selection\noccurring conditional on the birth of a previously born son.\nBACKGROUND\nMany researchers have found bias against girls in South Asia (Pravin\nARTICLE\nFrancesca Lamanna, and Stephen Klasen 2010; Siwan Anderson and Debraj\nRay 2010). There are fewer attempts to determine or measure the specific\neconomic incentives causing this discrimination. Rosenblum (2013), for\nexample, hypothesizes that the future economic benefits of sons and costs\nof daughters drive son-preferring fertility-stopping rules that exacerbate\ndiscrimination against girls. Mark R. Rosenzweig and T. Paul Schultz (1982)\nargue that the relatively high future wages of sons cause parents to invest\nin sons over daughters in India. They explain part of the excess female\nmortality in India by these wage differences. More recently, Eliana Carranza\n(2014) shows that increased women's employment in agriculture in India\nreduces the male\u00adfemale sex ratio.\nOverall, however, the economic causes of son preference and sex-\nselective abortion in India have not been deeply explored. This article's\nmain contribution to the existing literature on gender discrimination\nin India is that it is the first to estimate the extent to which a son\nimproves the household economy relative to a daughter. These estimates\nprovide empirical evidence to support a plausible economic explanation\nfor the missing women phenomenon in India and support some of the\nhypothesized mechanisms for the economic value of sons. In addition, the\nestimates show which subgroups have the most to gain from a son and, thus,\nwhere sex selection or discrimination against daughters is likely to occur.\nI use the detailed economic data from the 2005 India Human Development\nSurvey (IHDS). The data are nationally representative of India and cover\nthree states and union territories. The IHDS contains data on household\nspending, income, labor supply, and assets as well as demographic\ncharacteristics such as household members' age, education, caste, and\nreligion. Ever-married women between the ages of 15 and 49 are asked\nadditional questions, and in particular are asked to report their full birth\nhistory. Of these, 31,062 women report having one or more children.\nHowever, to simplify the analysis, I only use the birth histories of heads\nof household or their spouse and not, for example, of daughters-in-law.\nSome households are dropped from the analysis if the head of household\nhas no children, birth history was not recorded, the head of household\nhas multiple wives, or the head of household has first-born twins, bringing\nthe sample size down to 24,158 households. Although the IHDS is a cross-\nsection, the detailed economic data make it more informative than, for\nexample, the multiple waves of the Indian National Family Health Surveys\n(NFHS), which only contain a household wealth index.2\nOne may worry that the missing birth histories create bias because they\nare of women who used selective abortion. Most of the birth histories\ndropped from the analysis are daughters-in-law living with the household\nhead. Analyzing them is complicated by the many households with more\nthan one daughter-in-law, making it difficult to match children to their\nmother and to attribute the effects of the sex of a first-born child. However,\nto address the possibility of such bias, I perform several tests that show that\nparents of first-born sons are not initially different, and in particular not\nwealthier, than parents of first-born daughters.\nThe estimation strategy uses the observation that the sex outcome of a\nfirst birth in India is a random event. As shown in Bhalotra and Cochrane\nin India, first births have a biologically normal sex ratio \u00ad that is, parents do\nnot use sex-selective abortion for their first pregnancies. Given the large\namount of evidence that sex selection is not influencing the first birth\nparity, we can treat a first birth as a natural experiment where parents are\nrandomly giving birth to a son or a daughter. Thus, the following equation\nestimates the private effect on the household economy of having a son\ninstead of a daughter at the first parity:\nYij\n=  + FirstBoyij\n+  Xij\n+ Sj\nwhere Yij is the economic variable of interest for household i in\nstate/territory j. FirstBoyij is a 0/1 variable equal to 1 if parents have a first-\nborn boy and equal to 0 if parents have a first-born girl. Xij is a vector of\nhousehold variables, including parents' age at the time of the survey, years\nof schooling, religion, caste, and whether the household is in a rural or\nurban part of India. Sj are state/territory fixed effects, and eij is the error\nterm.  is the estimated economic value of a first-born son compared with\na first-born daughter. Since the data is a cross-section, I can only measure\nthe 2005 relative value of a son and not how that value changes over time\nfor a specific household. However, a subanalysis focusing on different age\ncategories of parents gives an indication of how the economic benefits of\nhaving a son change as parents age.\nI estimate the economic benefits of a first-born son over four measures\nof economic well-being: the (natural) log of per capita yearly income (PCI)\nin Indian rupees, log of per capita monthly expenditure (PCE) in Indian\nrupees, as well as a household asset index, and whether the household is\nbelow or above the poverty line. There is a strong economic argument\nfor using household expenditure as a measure of long-term household\nwelfare (Angus Deaton 1997).3 I include income as well, even though it\nmay represent a more short-term measure of welfare in addition to having\npotentially more difficult measurement problems. I also use per capita\nARTICLE\ninstead of total income or expenditure to help to account for differences\nin household composition (Gautam Datta and Jacob Meerman 1980). Per\ncapita measures ignore potential economies of scale in the household.4\nBecause having a son affects household size via son-preferring fertility-\nstopping rules, I investigate how different household equivalence scales\naffect the interpretation of the estimates. Due to data limitations I cannot\naccount for all forms of private economic benefits derived from children.\nMany household-produced services, while mainly produced by women, lack\nmarket prices and thus are likely to go unaccounted for in household\nincome or expenditure aggregates (for example, childcare, elder care,\ncooking, and cleaning). Thus, women's contributions to the household\neconomy are likely to be underestimated.\nThe IHDS household asset index is based on the household's ownership\nof durable items (vehicle, sewing machine, computer, and so on) and\nthe quality of the home (flush toilet, quality of the walls, roof, and floor,\nelectricity, and so on). The index ranges from 0 to 30, with 30 indicating\nthe highest level of assets. The asset measure can be thought of as a measure\nof household wealth. As Deon Filmer and Lant H. Pritchett (2001) argue,\nan asset index can also be interpreted as a long-term measure of household\nwelfare. Last, I estimate the effect of a first-born son on poverty status. The\npoverty line is determined by the Indian Planning Commission's official\nper capita expenditure poverty lines for 2005, which varies by location.\nIf parents of first-born boys in the IHDS were systematically different than\nhouseholds with a first-born girl in unobservable ways prior to having their\nfirst child, it would be a threat to the empirical strategy. The population\nweighted ratio of male to female first births in the IHDS is 1.09, with a\nHowever, even with more than 24,000 observations, the sample size is too\nsmall to reject the hypothesis that the sex ratio at birth is normal.5 The\nlarger data sets used in previous studies find that the sex ratio at birth for\nfirst-borns is biologically normal in India (Bhalotra and Cochrane 2010; Jha\nevidence to ensure that there is no bias from sex selection at the first parity\nin the IHDS.\nOne test to detect such a bias is to estimate whether first-born boy and\nfirst-born girl households are systematically different in characteristics that\nshould be exogenous to the sex of their first-born child. Table 1 presents\npopulation-weighted means for IHDS household variables separated into\nmale and female first-birth households. These variables include parents'\nage and education, religion, caste, and whether they live in a rural or urban\nTable 1 Descriptive statistics by first-birth outcome\nFirst-born boy First-born girl Difference\nIndependent variables (1) (2) (3)\nDependent Variables (4) (5) (6)\nNotes: ***, **, * denote statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

There are almost no statistically significant differences between first-\nborn boy and first-born girl households.6 This table shows that if there is\nbias in the dataset, it is likely small.\nIf, as Bhalotra and Cochrane (2010) show, wealthier households are\nmore likely to use sex selection, and parents use sex selection at the first\nparity, then it would not be surprising if I find that a first-born boy predicts\nbetter economic outcomes. For parents of older children, it is impossible to\ndisentangle this selection bias from the true increase in wealth generated\nby a son. However, ultrasound only started to become prevalent in the\n1990s and, hence, older parents were much less likely to have access to sex-\ndetection technology than younger parents. For parents of young children,\nif the sex of a first-born is truly exogenous, then sons should have no effect\non wealth, which takes time to accumulate.\nI test for the existence of this selection bias in young households in two\nways. First, focusing on households where the first-born is age 5 or under,\nI examine whether there are significant differences in the sex ratio of first-\nborns for wealthy versus poor households. Because of the limited sample\nsize, I only test the difference between households above the median\nhousehold asset index and those below. The survey-weighted proportion of\nyoung wealthier households with a first-born son is 0.520 (standard error\nassets. Hence, there is no detectable difference in the probability of giving\nbirth to a first-born son based on initial wealth.\nSecond, I estimate the effect of a first-born son on household assets\nand poverty status using Equation 1, again only for parents of children\nage 5 years or younger. As shown in Table 2, I find no statistically\nsignificant difference between the two types of young parents, providing\nadditional evidence that households who have a first-born boy are not\ninitially wealthier than households with a first-born girl.\nAlthough it is unlikely that sex selection occurs at the first parity, an\nadditional problem with the estimation strategy, as indicated in Rosenblum\nrecall and survival bias in the data that causes first-born girl households\nto appear better off than they really are. Recall bias occurs when parents\ndo not accurately report their birth history. In particular, parents may\nfail to report daughters who died when very young. Survival bias happens\nbecause mothers of first-born daughters have more children on average\nthan mothers of first-born sons. Since death during childbirth is not\nuncommon in India, this difference in number of children means that\nmothers of first-born girls are more likely to die than mothers of first-\nborn boys and, therefore, are not available to be surveyed. In either case,\nthe worst-off mothers of first-born girls are those not being surveyed or\nwrongly reporting that their first-born child is a son. Thus,  may be\nan underestimate of the true economic benefits of having a first-born\nTable 2 OLS: Correlation of a first-born son with household assets and poverty\nstatus, first-born age 5 or younger\nAsset index Below poverty line\nControls no yes no yes\nNotes: ***, **, * denote statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

Household demographic variables\nare included in the estimations to reduce this bias. However, there is\nlittle change to the coefficients if demographic controls are omitted. This\nprovides further evidence that there is little bias in the estimates and that\nthe sex of a first-born can reasonably be treated as exogenous.\nOn average, households with a first-born boy have better economic\noutcomes than first-born girl households. Columns 1 and 2 of Table 1\nshow the mean dependent variables of interest with the sample separated by\nthe sex of the first-born child. The average household in the IHDS is very\npoor, with per capita income of Rs. 9,700 annually,7 per capita monthly\nexpenditures of Rs. 840,8 and 22 percent of households living below the\npoverty line. These numbers indicate the intense poverty of many of the\nhouseholds in the survey as well as the potential for large increases in\nhousehold welfare from small increases in income or wealth.\nThe full estimation results indicate a strong positive effect on the\nhousehold economy of having a son instead of a daughter. Columns 1 and\n2 in Tables 3\u00ad6 show estimates of the average economic difference across\nIndia of a household with a first-born son versus first-born daughter. As\nseen in column 2, where controls are added to reduce bias, a first-born son\nincreases annual per capita household income on average by 6.9 percent\nacross India, increases monthly household per capita expenditure by 2.1\npercent, increases the household asset index by 0.2, and decreases the\nprobability that a household is in poverty by 0.7 percentage points. The\nestimates for income, expenditure, and assets are statistically significant\nat the 1 percent level. The estimates for below poverty line status are\nARTICLE\nTable 3 OLS: Effect of a first-born son on log (per capita annual income)\nControls no yes yes yes yes yes no yes\nNotes: ***, **, * denote statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

These findings show that there are\nsubstantial economic gains from a son.\nBecause many parents in India follow son-preferring fertility-stopping rules,\nparents who have a first-born son will have fewer children on average.9\nThis may be the reason that per capita income and expenditure are larger\nfor these households. In India joint households are prevalent, and it is\ncommon for sons to live with their parents after marriage, while daughters\nlive with their in-laws after marriage. Hence, older parents of sons gain\nhousehold members, while parents of daughters lose household members,\npossibly causing per capita income and expenditure to fall for older\nparents of first-born sons.10 If household economies of scale are important,\nthen household demographic changes may cause per capita measures to\noverestimate the effect of a first-born son on the household economy when\nchildren are young and underestimate the effect when children are old.\nWealthy households may wait longer to have a child than poor\nhouseholds. Thus, the relative age of a child to his parents may\nbe endogenous to economic outcomes. However, the mother's age is\nexogenous to household economic outcomes; that is, economic outcomes\ncannot affect a mother's current age. Therefore, I use age of the mother\nrather than age of the first-born to investigate changes to demographic\nstructure. The sample is stratified by the mother's age (under 30, between\nthe effect of a male first-born on household composition. Since the data\nis a cross-section, the differences in the effects of a first-born son on the\nhousehold economy for younger versus older households cannot tell us\nwhat will happen to currently younger households or what happened in the\npast to currently older households. For example, given the rapid decline in\nfertility in India, we should expect the future effect of a son on household\ncomposition to be weaker. Nonetheless, the estimates are the best we can do\nwith the current data limitations to determine how a first-born son affects\nthe household economy at various life stages.\nTo give a better sense of the demographic make-up of the household for\neach mother age category, the mean age of first-born children is shown in\nTable 7, column (1). The mother age categories also indicate the marital\nstatus of children. Less than 1 percent of sons are married below the age of\nmarried between the ages of 21 and 25. Only the marital status of current\nhousehold members is observed in the IHDS. Thus, a daughter's marriage\nstatus is generally not observed because they usually leave the household\nafter marriage. For example, less than 1 percent of daughters living in their\nTable 7 OLS: Effect of a first-born son on household size and household labor by\nmother's age (MA) categories\nCoefficient on First-Born Boy\nMean age Depend.\nfirst-born Children Teens Adults Workers Total ratio\nNotes: ***, **, * denote statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.\nRobust standard errors are clustered by state in parentheses for all regression estimates. All\nregressions include the following independent variables: parents' age and education, caste/religion,\nurban/rural and state. Column 1 presents the mean age of first-born children within each mother\nage category. Columns 2\u00ad7 show the estimated effect of having a first-born son on the total number\nof children, teens, adults, workers, total household members, and the dependency ratio (the number\nof household members under age 15 and over age 64 divided by the number of household members\naged 15 through 64). \"Total\" is the number of children plus teens plus adults. \"Workers\" are the\nnumber of household members that have worked at least 240 hours per year.\nparents' household are married under the age of 20, and only 6 percent\nare married between the ages of 21 and 25.\nTable 7 shows the effect of a first-born son on the number of children\n(ages 0\u00ad14) in column 2, number of adolescents and young adults (15\u00ad\n21) in column 3, number of mature adults (21+ ) in column 4, number\nof workers in the household in column 5, total household members in\ncolumn 6, and the dependency ratio in column 7. As predicted, a first-born\nson reduces the total number of household members when parents are\nyoung and raises it when they are old. Furthermore, a first-born reduces\na household's dependency ratio across age categories. These effects on the\nhousehold demographic composition are due to a reduction in the number\nof children for younger mothers and an increase in the number of adults\n(and workers) for older mothers.11\nARTICLE\nFigure 1 Estimated household expenditure benefits of a first-born son relative to a\nfirst-born daughter for three levels of household economies of scales: per capita\nexpenditure (PCE), total expenditure/\n\nN (where N is the total number of\nhousehold members), and total expenditure.\nNotes: The sample is stratified by mother's age categories. See Online Appendix for\nestimation tables. Larger shapes indicate statistical significance at the 5% level.\nColumn 3 in Tables 3\u00ad6 includes interaction terms between having a\nfirst-born boy and the mother's age categories. They show that younger\nhouseholds (mother's age 30\u00ad35) with a first-born boy are less likely to be\nin poverty, while older households (ages 40 and older) have significantly\ngreater assets. It is the younger households that appear to gain the most\nfrom a son in per capita income or expenditure.12 In order to better\nunderstand the changes in the economic gains from a son as households\nage, I stratify the sample by mother's age categories and compare the\neffect of a first-born son on the log of per capita income and per capita\nexpenditure, the log of total income and total expenditure, and the\nlog of income/\n\nN and expenditure/\n\nN, where N is the total number\nof household members. These measures represent both extremes of\nequivalence scales, no economies of scale (per capita) versus full economies\nof scale (total), and the in-between measure that is used as an equivalence\nscale in most industrialized countries (total/\n\nN ). The estimates of  for\nthe five mother age categories and three equivalence scales are shown in\nFigures 1 and 2. See Online Appendix for a more thorough discussion of\nequivalence scales and their corresponding estimates.\nThe figures show how per capita measures can underestimate the\neconomic gains from a first-born son for older parents and overestimate\nthem for younger parents. For per capita measures of economic well-\nbeing, the benefits are the largest when mothers are in the 30\u00ad35 age\nrange, when households with a first-born boy have fewer children. For\nFigure 2 Estimated household income benefits of a first-born son relative to a\nfirst-born daughter for three levels of household economies of scales: per capita\nincome (PCI), total income/\n\nN (where N is the total number of household\nmembers), and total income.\nNotes: The sample is stratified by mother's age categories. See Online Appendix for\nestimation tables. Larger shapes indicate statistical significance at the 5% level.\ntotal income or expenditure measures, the largest benefits accrue when the\nmother is age 45 or older, when households with a first-born son have more\nadults. In addition, these estimates provide insights into the two proposed\nmechanisms for the economic benefits of sons. As indicated in Table 7,\ncolumn 5, in the long run, because of the joint household structure in\nIndia, having a son instead of a daughter increases the number of workers\nin the household when parents are older. Indeed, these households are\nsignificantly better off in terms of total, if not per capita, income and\nexpenditure. In other words, these graphs illustrate that regardless of the\neconomies of scale, there are large economic benefits from a first-born son\nat some age categories.\nTable 5 shows that older mothers with a first-born son live in households\nwith significantly higher assets. These findings show that old-age support\nis a significant economic reason to want a son in India. Thus, the short-\nrun mechanism for the economic value of sons is that they reduce desired\nfertility, increasing expenditure and income per person. This is enough to\npush some households above the poverty line. Having fewer children may\nfree up parents' labor, which would increase total and per capita income.\nOr, as in the United States and West Germany, fathers of sons may increase\ntheir labor supply simply because they have a son (Shelly Lundberg and\nElaina Rose 2002; Hyung-Jai Choi, Jutta M. Joesch, and Shelly Lundberg\nARTICLE\n2008). The two mechanisms are interrelated in that parents' desire for\nsupport in old age may cause parents to follow son-preferring fertility-\nstopping rules in the first place.\nDifferent types of household likely benefit in different ways from having\nsons, if they benefit at all. Columns 4\u00ad8 in Tables 3\u00ad6 include interaction\nterms between having a first-born son and observable household\ncharacteristics and location in order to understand the heterogeneous\neffects of a son on the household economy. This section has two goals. First,\nit provides policymakers with information on which population groups\nhave the largest economic benefits from a son and, hence, the strongest\nincentives to use sex selection. Second, it informs us about whether\neconomic incentives can explain observations from prior research about\nwhich subpopulations are using sex-selective abortion in India.\nIn particular, this section examines the following observations: (1)\nSelective abortion happens more often among those with more years of\n(2) There are substantial regional differences in the extent of sex selection;\nhowever, regional differences (in particular, north versus south India) in\nthe number of selective abortions disappear when demographic differences\nare controlled for (Bhalotra and Cochrane 2010); (3) Selective abortion\ndoes not occur for a given birth parity if there were any previously born\ninclude the heterogeneous economic benefits of a son for urban versus\nrural households and for the various caste and religious groups of India.\nMother's education\nI estimate Equation 1 with interactions between having a first-born son and\nthe mother's education groups used in Jha et al. (2006) (no education,\nless than primary, primary below grade 10, and grade 10 or higher). These\nestimates are presented in column 4 in Tables 3\u00ad6.13 The estimates using\nthese cutoffs do not exactly fit the pattern of the more educated using\nsex selection. Per capita expenditure gains appear largest for the most\neducated, but the pattern is not monotonic, with mothers with primary\neducation also having large relative gains. There is no detectable additional\nbenefit from a son based on the mother's education for assets, income, or\npoverty status.\nThe broader cutoffs used by Portner (2015; above and below grade 8)\nfit the pattern of sex selection, with more education associated with higher\nper capita expenditures (a 3 percent increase, statistically significant at the\n5 percent level). However, in general there are large economic gains to\nhaving a son, even for the less educated. Thus, the findings do not entirely\nexplain why, for example, Portner (2015) finds that less-educated parents\ndo not use sex-selective abortion. Perhaps it is a matter of access to sex-\ndetection technology. If this is the case, then the estimates would predict a\nfuture rise in sex selection among those with less education as sex detection\nbecomes cheaper and more widespread.\nRegional differences\nIn India there are large differences in the male\u00adfemale sex ratio across\nregions. In particular, richer north India has a higher male\u00adfemale sex ratio\nthan poorer south India.14 Furthermore, there are substantial differences\nin marriage practices and labor outcomes for women across India that\nmay affect the relative value of sons (Tim Dyson and Mick Moore 1983;\nBina Agarwal 1994). For example, in north India, exogamous marriage\nis prevalent, while in south and northeast India, endogamous marriage\nis more common. Up until a 2005 amendment to the Hindu Succession\nAct, there were differences across India in Hindu women's legal rights to\ninherit ancestral property across India, with most women unable to inherit.\nA handful of states, mostly in south India, passed laws granting equal legal\ninheritance rights for sons and daughters many years before this. Even\nwithin states, there is variation in cultural practices. For example, although\ndowry is prevalent in north India, the Girahya in south Rajasthan practice\nThat north India has more discrimination against girls may be because\nnorth Indian households have larger economic gains from a son compared\nto south Indian households. To test whether there is large variation in the\nvalue of a son versus a daughter across India, the sample is split into six\nsubgroups: North, Central, West, East, South, and Northeast.15 If economic\nincentives are causing selective abortion, then the gains from a son should\nbe larger in the areas with a high male\u00adfemale sex ratio at birth. The\nfollowing estimation equation is used for the regional estimates:\nYik\n=  + FirstBoyik\n+ kFirstBoyik\n Rk\n+ kRk\n+  Xik\nwhere the economic outcome for household i in region k depends on the\nsex outcome of the first-birth, region fixed effects (Rk), region interacted\nwith the sex outcome of the first birth, and a vector of household\ncharacteristics. The omitted region is the South.\nEquation 2 is estimated with and without Xik, the vector of demographic\nvariables. Without these controls, the estimates show which states have\nthe largest incentives for sex selection on average. These are the relevant\nARTICLE\nestimates for policymakers who want to target the places in India with the\nlargest incentives for sex selection. With the demographic control variables,\nthe estimates show whether the average incentives for sex selection in\na region can be explained by the particular demographic make-up of a\nregion. That is, we can test whether the region itself or characteristics\nof those who live in the region explain the economic incentives for sex\nselection.\nThe estimates are presented in columns 7 and 8 in Tables 3\u00ad6. In\ncolumn 7, without demographic controls, the North, East, Center, and West\ngenerally show greater gains from a son compared to the South, while the\nNortheast shows lower gains than the South. Using the estimated number\nof sex-selective abortions in Jha et al. (2006), one can rank these regions by\nthe number of sex-selective abortions per pregnancy.16 The North has the\nmost sex-selective abortions, followed by the West, East, Center, South, and\nthen the Northeast with the smallest sex-selection problem.\nIn general, the coefficients show higher gains from a first-born son for\nregions with more sex selection. The estimated effect size for Center is\nstatistically smaller than the East and West for PCI, and from the North\nand East for poverty status. Only the Northeast and South's estimated\neffects are consistently less than the other regions at a statistically significant\nlevel. Although we cannot precisely determine the pattern in incentives\nat the regional level, without demographic controls, there appear to be\nstronger economic incentives for sex selection for the regions with high\nlevels of sex selection (the North, West, and East) than for those with\nlittle sex selection (the South and Northeast). If household demographic\ncontrols are added to the regional estimates, as shown in column 8,\nthe estimated differences across regions are generally reduced and less\nstatistically significant. However, the effects do not disappear when controls\nare added and do not always decline (the effect on poverty status gets\nstronger for north India when controls are added). These mixed results\nindicate that regional incentives to have sons go beyond demographic\ndifferences and that there are regional cultural differences that affect the\nprivate economic value of sons and daughters. In the Online Appendix,\nthe estimates are further broken down by individual states to illustrate\nthe complexity of the relative value of sons and daughters across India.\nAlthough patterns in the estimated effect of a first-born son on the\nhousehold economy are generally consistent across states within a region,\nthere are several states that differ significantly from one another, even\nwithin regions.\nOther heterogeneous effects: Urban/rural and caste/religion\nPortner (2015) shows that sex selection has spread to both urban and rural\nareas of India. In accord with these findings, there is little difference in\nthe economic benefits of a first-born son between urban and rural parts of\nIndia (column 5, Tables 3\u00ad6). In addition, estimates including interactions\nwith caste and religion in column 6 do not appear to have an effect on\nthe economic values of sons. There is a large positive effect of a first-born\nson on assets for Christian households and a lower likelihood of being\nin poverty for Other Backwards Classes. However, there are no consistent\nbenefits of a son across economic variables for any particular subgroups.\nThis lack of evidence may simply be due to the small sample size of any\nsingle caste or religion.\nDiminishing returns to sons\nAlthough fertility decisions can be influenced by economic outcomes, most\nparents in India eventually have two or more children.17 As indicated by\nselective abortion is only likely to occur among second pregnancies if the\nfirst child is a daughter.18 Assuming that the sex of the second-born child\nis unaffected by the household economy conditional on having a first-born\nson, we can test whether having an additional son has any effect on the\nhousehold economy. Table 8 shows the OLS estimates for the value of this\nsecond son. There are no statistically significant economic benefits from\nhaving a second son, indicating diminishing returns to sons.\nThe estimates for the effect of a second-born son conditional on a\nhousehold having a first-born daughter are also presented in Table 8.\nThe economic gains from a second-born son are similar to those found in\nTable 8 OLS: Effect of a son at the second parity on the household economy\nBelow\nConditional on first-born son log(PCI) log(PCE) Asset index poverty line\nConditional on first-born daughter\nNotes: ***, **, * denote statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10 percent levels, respectively.

With the presence of sex selection for this group, it is difficult\nto make anything conclusive of these effects, since they could be coming\nfrom a selected sample of richer households using sex-selective abortion.\nHowever, if this bias is small, the estimates indicate that there are strong\neconomic incentives for sex selection at the second parity, conditional on\na first-born daughter. These results suggest that having two boys, or a boy\nand girl (in any order), have similar effects on the household economy.\nThus, these findings help to explain the observation that parents do not\nuse sex-selective abortion in India if they already have one son, and that sex\nselection does not occur at the first parity even though a first-born son has\na substantial positive effect on the household economy.\nCONCLUSION\nThese estimates paint a multihued picture of the economic gains from a\nson in India. A first-born son improves the household economy in several\ndifferent ways depending on the type and age of the household. Some\nhouseholds gain income, while others gain assets. Some types of household\nare pushed out of poverty, but others are unaffected. That almost all of\nthe statistically significant results show positive gains from a son indicates\nthe general robustness of the finding that a son creates a large economic\ngain for a household. In addition, the economic benefits of a son coincide\nwith observed patterns of sex selection in India. Thus, economic incentives\nprovide a plausible explanation for the prevalence of sex-selective abortion\nin India. Furthermore, policymakers can use these findings to inform\npolicies that aim to reduce the economic incentives for sex selection.\nThis article explores two of the possible mechanisms that create the\neconomic benefits of a first-born son. In the short run, a first-born son\nreduces the number of children in the household increasing the amount\nof resources available per person. The increase in household labor supply\nprovided by an adult son is a likely mechanism for the economic benefits\nof a son in the long run. There are no doubt other possible mechanisms\nthat may explain the economic incentives, such as dowry and the lack of\nopportunities for women's employment.\nThe estimates show that there are strong economic incentives for sex\nselection even in groups that have not recently been using sex-selective\nabortion. Recent estimates show that selective abortion is still on the rise\nin India (Stephan Klasen and Claudia Wink 2003), although it is starting\nto decline in northern India, where the sex ratios are already very high\n(Monica Das Gupta, Woojin Chung, and Li Shuzhuo 2009; Jha et al.\n2011). This should serve as a warning to policymakers that as access to sex\ndetection and abortion improves, the strong economic pressures to have a\nson will increase the prevalence of sex-selective abortion.\nWhile this article estimates the private returns to parents of having a son\nversus a daughter, it does not measure the positive externalities of having\na daughter. At the household level, sisters may improve the outcomes of\ntheir siblings (William L. Parish and Robert J. Willis 1993; Ashish Garg and\nJonathan Morduch 1998). At an aggregate level, there are potentially huge\ncosts of having an extremely skewed sex ratio. Not only will there be tens\nof millions of men unable to marry, but these men could cause large-scale\ncrime and security problems (Valerie M. Hudson and Andrea M. Den Boer\nFor policymakers, this article suggests that eliminating discrimination\nthat favors sons and hurts daughters may be an expensive and difficult\ntask. However, any marginal increase in the benefit of a daughter relative\nto a son may help to internalize the aforementioned positive externalities\nof daughters, which would decrease the use of sex-selective abortion\nand reduce excess female mortality. Such policy interventions could\ntake the form of conditional or unconditional cash transfers for parents\nof daughters, subsidized schooling and healthcare for daughters, and\nimproving women's property and labor rights.\nDaniel Rosenblum\nDalhousie University - Economics\nCanada\ne-mail: Daniel.Rosenblum@dal.ca\nDaniel Rosenblum is Associate Professor in the Department of Economics\nat Dalhousie University.
