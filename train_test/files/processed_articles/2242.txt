Lippert\n* Correspondence to Dr. Michelle L. Frisco, Department of Sociology and Population Research Institute, The Pennsylvania State University,\nAdolescent Health, we investigated the association between young women's body weight and depression during\nage during wave 3. We used Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale scores to classify young women\nas never depressed, consistently depressed, experiencing depression onset, or experiencing depression recovery\nfrom wave 2 to wave 3. Results from adjusted multinomial logistic regression models indicated that respondents\nwho experienced significant weight gain were at risk of depression onset. Normal weight (adjusted odds ratio =\n1.15, 2.99) adolescent girls who were obese by young adulthood, as well as young women who were consistently\nobese during adolescence and young adulthood (adjusted odds ratio = 1.97, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 3.26),\nhad roughly twice the odds of depression onset as did young women who were never overweight. We concluded\nthat weight gain and obesity are risk factors for depression onset during the transition to adulthood.

Estimates of depression prevalence based on broad\nassessment criteria indicating debilitating sadness suggest\nthat roughly one-third of all female US high school students\nare depressed compared with one-fifth of male students (4).\nEstimates based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders-IV are lower and suggest that 12% of\nfemale and 5% of male adolescents are depressed (5).\nPrevious research has examined whether body weight is a\nrisk factor for depression among all adolescents and among\nfemale adolescents in particular, because obesity is a stigma-\ntized status that can lead to social isolation and discrimina-\ntion (6, 7). These studies have produced mixed findings (8).\nAmong clinical adolescent samples, obesity is a risk factor\nfor depression (9\u00ad11). Among representative national and\ncommunity samples of adolescents, obesity is generally not\nassociated with depression (12, 13), especially in studies\nthat adjust estimates for confounders (14, 15). Even longitu-\ndinal studies that examine how adolescent obesity at baseline\npredicts depression 1 year later produce modest (16) or null\nAlthough representative studies have found little evidence\nthat obesity is a risk factor among all adolescents, this rela-\ntionship has been found among national samples of younger\nadolescents.

Instead, it is a\nrisk factor during the transition into adolescence. Previous\nstudies have not examined whether weight is also associated\nwith depression as young people transition out of adoles-\ncence, a life course stage commonly referred to as the \"tran-\nsition to adulthood\" (19). During this time, young people\nundergo many life changes, including high school exit and\nentrance into the labor force or postsecondary educational\ninstitutions (18). Young women are also more likely than\ntheir male peers to exit parental residences, enter cohabiting\nand marital unions, and become parents (20). Weight gain\nand continued obesity in the midst of these transitions may\nbe particularly stigmatizing and distressing because these\nlife events place young women in new social settings and\nnetworks at a time when social relationships undergo exten-\nsive transformation (21). This leads us to hypothesize that\nobesity and weight gain may be associated with depression\nas young women transition to adulthood. To our knowledge,\nthis is the first study to assess whether weight and weight\nchange during the transition to adulthood influence the devel-\nopment of, recovery from, and \"consistent\" depression mea-\nsured at 2 distinct time points.\nData for the study were drawn from the restricted-use ver-\nsion of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health\n(hereafter referred to as \"Add Health\"), a longitudinal,\nnationally representative survey of students in the 7th\u00ad12th\ngrades from 134 schools (22). Respondents were selected\nfrom a stratified random sample of students. Four waves of\nDuring wave 2, the 12th-grade students from wave 1 were\nnot followed up, and the response rate among followed-up\nused wave2 ratherthanwave1 tocaptureadolescence because\nwave 2 included interviewer-measured assessments of res-\npondents' height and weight; wave 1 did not (data are self-\nreported).\nwomen. We retained female respondents in the analysis if\nyears of age in wave 3 (n = 5,695). This ensured that we were\nestimating associations between weight (and weight change)\nand depression between adolescence and early adulthood.\nThis sample selection strategy has been used in a study that\nuses Add Health data to estimate weight gain and stability\nduring the transition to adulthood (24). We excluded women\nwho were pregnant during either the wave-2 interview or the\nwave-3 interview (n = 447) because their estimated weight\nclassifications while pregnant would be biased by pregnancy\nweight gain, leading to potential misclassification of body\nweight change during the transition to adulthood. The final\nMeasures\nDepression change. Waves 2 and 3 of the Add Health\nincluded modified versions of the Center for Epidemiologic\nStudies Depression Scale (CES-D) (25). Wave 2 included a\n19-item version of the instrument and wave 3 included a 9-\nitem version. Modified, shortened forms of the CES-D are\ncommonly used by researchers (26\u00ad28), and versions that use\nas few as 4 items are reliable (27). Because we were inter-\nested in changes in symptomatology, we created comparable\nindicators of depressive symptoms in waves 2 and 3 by\nsumming responses (ranging from 0 to 3) from the 9 CES-D\nitems found in both the wave-2 and wave-3 surveys. Items\nasked respondents how often in the last week they were both-\nered by things not normally bothersome, could not shake the\nblues, felt like they were not as good as others, had trouble\nfocusing, were depressed, were too tired to do things they\nenjoyed, and were sad. Higher scores (range, 0\u00ad27) indicated\nmore depressive symptoms (in wave 2,  = 0.78; in wave\nclassified as depressed. Previous research that used the 9-item\nscale has indicated that scores of this magnitude predict a\ndiagnostic definition of depression for female respondents\n(29, 30). Other studies have used lower scores on the 9-item\nscale to signify depression--either 10 or a score that was 1\nstandard deviation above the mean (15, 31, 32). We tested the\nsensitivity of study results to these cutoffs, and results were\nconsistent across all of them.\nWave-2 and wave-3 depression indicators were used to\ncreate a 4-category variable signifying depression during ado-\nlescence and early adulthood. Respondents were classified\nas never depressed (not depressed in either wave 2 or 3), con-\nsistently depressed (depressed in both waves 2 and 3), recov-\nered from depression (depressed in wave 2 but not in wave\n3), or as experiencing depression onset (depressed in wave 3\nbut not in wave 2). Category names are used for brevity\nonly; they are not clinical assessments, and these classifica-\ntions capture depression at 2 time points only, not possible\nbouts of depression or recovery between the survey waves.\nBody weight change. Early adult BMI scores are based\non interviewer-measured height and weight data collected in\nwave 3. We used calculated BMI scores to classify young\nwomen as not overweight (BMI <25), overweight (BMI\nFor adolescent subjects, we used wave-2 height and weight\ndata to calculate age- and sex-specific BMI percentiles\naccording to guidelines of the US Centers for Disease Control\nWeight and Depression in the Transition to Adulthood 23\nand Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia). We then classified young\nwomen as not overweight, overweight, or obese by using\nguidelines of the International Obesity Taskforce (London,\nUnited Kingdom) for matching adolescent BMI percentiles\nto adult BMI scores. After this conversion, we classified ado-\nlescents as not overweight, overweight, or obese by using\nthe guidelines foradults (33). This approach accounted for the\ndiscrepancy in assessments of overweight and obesity for\nadolescents and adults and has been used in prior studies\nthat examined weight gain during the transition to adulthood\n(24). Results from supplementary analyses that did not trans-\nform adolescent BMI percentiles to adult BMI scores before\nclassifying respondents into weight categories are consistent\nwith the results presented here.\nWe used adolescent and early adult weight categories to\nclassify young women as never overweight (referent), con-\nsistently overweight, consistently obese, or as weight losers\nor weight gainers. Weight gainers were further decomposed\ninto categories indicating a transition from normal weight to\noverweight, from normal weight to obese, or from overweight\nto obese. Weight losers were not decomposed because few\nsample members (3.7%) lost weight.\nCovariates. Several variables were treated as confound-\ners because of their relationships with body weight and depres-\nsion. These included race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic black,\nHispanic, and \"other\" vs. the referent, non-Hispanic white);\nnativity; age; total family income; parents' highest level of\neducation measured as a continuous variable ranging from 1\n(no formal schooling) to 8 (graduate/professional school);\nfamily structure (living in single-parent, step-parent, or other\ntype of household vs. living in a household with 2 biological/\nadoptive parents); fair/poor self-reported health; physical\nactivity (i.e., frequency of activities such as jogging, walking,\nand dancing in the past week); and whether women were ever\npregnant prior to wave 2 or between waves 2 and 3. All covar-\niates were constructed by using wave-2 data except for family\nincome, which was assessed at wave 1 only, and pregnancy\ndata, which were retrospectively reported by women.\nData analysis\nAll variables had missing data for 5% or fewer cases, with\nthe exception of family income (22% of cases). When omit-\nting cases with missing data on any variable, we lost roughly\n30% of the sample, and the retained sample was not repre-\nsentative of the Add Health's wave-3 female respondents on\nkey variables, including depression and weight gain.\nThe use of multiple imputation to handle missing data is\nmore efficient and less biased than the use of listwise dele-\ntion (34). Given the sample selection bias that listwise dele-\ntion produced, we multiply imputed missing data by using\nthe imputation for changed equations (ICE) procedure for\nStata, version 12.0, software (StataCorp LP, College Station,\nTexas). The procedure iteratively replaces missing values on\nall variables with predictions based on random draws from\nthe posterior distributions of parameters observed in the sam-\nple, creating multiple complete data sets (35). We averaged\nempirical results across 5 imputation samples and accounted\nfor random variation across samples to calculate standard\nerrors (36). In supplementary analysis, we estimated statisti-\ncal models on the sample observed after listwise deletion of\nmissing data. Results were similar to those shown here, but\nestimates here are slightly more conservative. These results\nalso better represent the national sample of female Add Health\nparticipants.\nAll statistical analyses were conducted by using Stata,\nversion 12.0, software (StataCorp LP). Survey commands\nwere used to weight estimates and to account for the Add\nHealth survey design. We first calculated weighted means\nand proportions for study variables to show characteristics\nof the total sample and of young women in different weight\ncategories (Table 1). We then used multinomial logistic-\nregression models to estimate unadjusted odds ratios, adjusted\nodds ratios, and 95% confidence intervals that show how\nweight change is related to changes in depression between\nadolescence and early adulthood (Table 2).\nRESULTS\nTable 1 describes the study sample's characteristics. Most\nyoung women were never depressed during the transition to\nadulthood (77.6%). Among young women with some\ndepression incidence, 4.2% were depressed during adoles-\ncence and early adulthood, 11.1% recovered from depres-\nsion by early adulthood, and 7.0% experienced depression\nonset by early adulthood. With respect to weight change,\n51.4% of the sample was never overweight. Another 20%\nwas not overweight during adolescence, but three-quarters\nof these young women were overweight by early adulthood\nand the other 25% were obese. Consistently overweight young\nwomen represented 6.2% of the sample, and 8.9% of young\nwomen transitioned from overweight to obese. Nearly 10%\nof young women were obese during adolescence and early\nadulthood. The smallest proportion of young women included\nthose who lost enough weight to be classified into a lower\nBMI category (3.7%). Sociodemographic characteristics of\nthe sample show that 68.5% of the included subjects were\nwith both parents during adolescence, the average level of\nparental education was slightly more than high school, and\nOnly 7% of young women reported fair/poor health. On\naverage, young women reported participating in physical\nactivities infrequently (1.7 times per week), and 30% reported\nat least 1 pregnancy between waves 2 and 3 or prior to\nYoung women's characteristics varied across weight cate-\ngories. With respect to depression, a greater proportion of\nyoung women who were never overweight (80.0%), consis-\ntently overweight (80.6%), and classified as weight losers\n(81%) were never depressed compared with peers who were\nobese during adolescence and early adulthood (70.0%) and\nthose who became obese by early adulthood (72.2% of those\nwho were not overweight during adolescence and 70.6% of\nthose who were overweight). Consistent depression during\nthe transition to adulthood was most common among consis-\ntently obese young women (7.1%) and least common among\nthose who were never overweight (3.5%).

Surprisingly, depres-\nsion recovery was most common among young women who\nwere overweight as adolescents and obese as young adults\n(14.8%). Young women in different weight categories also\nhad disparate background characteristics. For example, black\nand Hispanic young women were disproportionately under-\nrepresented among the subsample that was never overweight.\nYoung women reporting fair/poor health were dispropor-\ntionately overrepresented among consistently obese sample\nmembers.\nTable 2 shows results that were obtained from multinomial\nlogistic regression models that estimated depression change\nduring the transition to adulthood. \"Never depressed\" was the\nreference category.

The final set shows how weight change was related to\nconsistent depression. \"Never overweight\" was the reference\ncategory for weight change.\nResults from models estimating depression recovery indi-\ncated that girls who transitioned from overweight to obese\nwere more likely than peers who were never overweight\nto recover from depression by early adulthood.

Supplementary analyses indi-\ncated that self-rated health explains the estimated association\nbetween consistent obesity and consistent depression, sug-\ngesting that the poor physical health of consistently obese\nyoung women explained their elevated risk of depression\nduring the transition to adulthood.\nWe conducted supplementary analyses to further assess\nthe meaning and robustness of these findings. These analy-\nses showed that the relationships between weight change\nand depression change described above are unique to young\nwomen. Multinomial logistic regression models showed no\nsignificant relationship between weight change and depres-\nsion change among young men. Supplementary analyses also\nsuggested that study results were unique to the transition to\nadulthood. We replicated the analyses presented here by using\nTable 2.

Neither weight gain nor obesity predicted depres-\nsion consistency, recovery, or onset between survey waves.\nWe also tested whether results were robust to the inclusion of\nstress-related confounders in statistical models. Addition of\neither a binary measure of experiencing a stressful life event\nor a count of such events to the models did not statistically or\nsubstantively change the estimated associations shown in\nmodel 2 (Table 2). Finally, to test whether results were driven\nby reverse causation (with depression causing weight gain),\nwe conducted supplementary analyses testing whether wave-2\ndepression predicted weight change. It did not, regardless of\nwhether we operationalized weight change by using the cate-\ngories we used here or a difference score between BMI in\nDISCUSSION\nOur findings showed that weight change was related to\ndepression during the transition to adulthood. Young women\nwho became obese and those who were consistently obese\nhad roughly double the odds of depression onset during\nearly adulthood as did their peers who were never over-\nweight. Although this is the first study to focus on weight\nchange and depression during the transition to adulthood,\nthe findings are in line with those of previous studies of weight\nand depression among young people. Analyses of nationally\nrepresentative and community data have consistently found no\nassociation between obesity and depression during the adoles-\ncent years as a whole (12\u00ad16). Instead, obesity and weight\ngain are related to depression as children transition into ado-\nlescence regardless of whether this transition is defined by\npubertal development (18) or entry into the teen years (ages\nweight gain is especially salient for depression during major\nlife-course transitions.\nSupplementary analyses showing that weight gain and\nconsistent obesity are not associated with depression onset\nduring adulthood offer furtherevidence that obesity is not uni-\nformly consequential for depression across the life course.\nThese findings highlight the need to heed recent calls for\nhealth researchers to use a life-course framework (37). Failing\nto do so may lead researchers and practitioners to overlook\nkey moments in time when intervention strategies are needed\nmost.\nOur findings also showed that consistent obesity was asso-\nciated with consistent depression, but this association was\nexplained by fair/poor self-assessed health during adoles-\ncence. These findings dovetail with previous research showing\nthat obese adolescents have lower health-related quality of\nlife (38) and poorer self-assessed health (15) than do their\nnormal-weight counterparts.\nOur findings also reveal that weight gain is a significant\npublic health concern in the transition to adulthood. We\nfound that 9.8% of young women were consistently obese\nduring adolescence and early adulthood, and 13.8% of young\nwomen became obese by early adulthood. This is consistent\nwith previous research examining weight change during the\ntransition to adulthood (24). Our study's major contribution is\ndocumenting that this physical health risk also jeopardizes\nmental well-being during a life-course stage when depression\nonset is common (1).\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the\nrelationship between weight change and depression during\nthe transition to adulthood. It has several strengths. Data for\nthe study were drawn from a nationally representative, longi-\ntudinal US sample of young people followed from adoles-\ncence through early adulthood. Studies of physical and mental\nhealth during the transition to adulthood are also important\nbecause this life-course stage marks a time when young\npeople experience transitions that can reshape their physical\nhealth, mental health, and, as our study shows, the relationship\nbetween the 2. Finally, the BMI categories we used were\nbased on interviewer-assessed height and weight data. These\ndata are often self-reported in large population-representative\nsamples.\nThe study also has limitations. We operationalized depres-\nsion by using the CES-D. This instrument is often used in\nepidemiologic studies (39\u00ad41), but it is not a diagnostic\ntool. Accordingly, results reflect depression as indicated by\nself-reported symptomology rather than by clinical diagno-\nsis. In addition, weight and depression were measured at\nonly 2 time points. Given that depression is largely episodic,\nour indicator of depression change was somewhat limited.\nBMI scores and categories also have strengths (e.g., the indi-\ncators of height and weight that are used to create them are low\ncost and easily measured in large, population-representative\nstudies) but also limitations for capturing body fatness (42).\nIn addition, we could not measure all possible confounders\nof the relationships this study identifies, as is often the case\nwhen analyzing secondary data. Stress is an obvious example.\nAlthough we included a measure of stressful life events in\nsupplementary models, it was a fairly limited measure that\ncould not fully capture the stress universe.\nFuture research should examine what roles stress and\nsocial support have in relationships between weight change\nand depression change. Both may be important mechanisms.\nPrior research has shown that social support helps over-\nweight and obese women cope with the stress of weight\nstigma (43). As young women take on new social roles and\nare thrust into new social settings and networks during the\ntransition to adulthood (19\u00ad21), they may face increased\nweight stigma, increased stress, and reduced social support,\nthus increasing their odds of becoming depressed. Nearly 1\nin 4 US adolescent girls becomes or remains obese by early\nadulthood, making it critical to understand how stress, social\nsupport, and other possible mechanisms explain why these\nyoung women are at risk of depression onset during the tran-\nsition to adulthood.\n"
