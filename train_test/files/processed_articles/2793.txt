Introduction\nAcross the last half century, the scientific study of religion and its intersections with crime,\ndeviance, and crime control policy has undergone massive growth. More recently, the early decades of\nthe 21st century have also seen two largely independent literatures emerge within sociology, examining\nthe ways that (1) religious contexts and (2) immigration are related to macro-level patterns of violence.\nResearch on religious contexts and crime--which remains small but growing--has generally shown\nthat religious adherence is associated with lower rates of violence (Lee 2006; Lee and Bartkowski 2004;\nUlmer and Harris 2013). Likewise, a separate and generally much larger body of scholarship on\nimmigration and crime consistently reports that places with larger immigrant populations have\neither similar or lower levels of violence than places with relatively few foreign-born residents\nlevels of immigration and religious affiliation both appear to make communities safer or (at worst) no\nmore crime-prone than comparable places with less immigration or religious adherence.\nHowever, two issues remain unresolved. First, research has yet to fully explore the relationships\nbetween religious adherence and immigration, especially as they intersect to shape macro-level patterns of\ncrime and violence. Indeed, religion has long been viewed as a distinct cultural force within communities,\npurveying moral norms of behavior backed by sacred meanings and occasional sanctions (Smith 2003).\nFocusing on immigrant populations, both theoretical and empirical research on religious transmission\nacross countries (Van Tubergen 2006), as well as scholarship on immigrant assimilation, suggest that\nthe church is a central institution of support in immigrant communities that reinforces traditional\nvalue systems and strengthens social networks (Hirschman 2004; Yang and Ebaugh 2001). Likewise,\nfrom a related structural position, the \"immigrant revitalization\" perspective suggests that attachment\nto pro-social institutions (including religious ones) among foreign-born individuals helps to stabilize\nimmigrant communities in ways that strengthen informal social control and insulate them from social\nYet, few studies have empirically examined these relationships to identify the potential connections\nbetween immigration, religious contexts, and crime (for an exception, see Harris and Feldmeyer 2015).\nSecond, there is a need to better contextualize the effects of both community religious permeation\nand immigration on crime by exploring how these relationships vary across (a) different types of\nreligious adherence and (b) unique immigrant contexts. Although research on religion and crime at the\nmacro-level remains underdeveloped, preliminary findings suggest that adherence to specific religious\ntraditions1 and includes such denominations as Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Methodist. may have\nunique effects on community rates of crime and related social problems (Beyerlein and Hipp 2005).\nSimilarly, research on the immigration-crime nexus observes that immigration impacts violence\nin unique ways depending on a community's history of immigrant settlement (Painter-Davis 2016;\nRamey 2013; Shihadeh and Barranco 2013). In particular, immigrants settling in the U.S. over the\npast decade have increasingly bypassed traditional urban points of entry in favor of towns, rural\nareas, cities, and states with little or no established history of foreign-born settlement (Frey 2006;\na demographic shift intersects with patterns of religious adherence and, in turn, crime remains\nwholly unexplored.\nTaken together, empirical research is needed that (1) establishes the ways in which immigration\nand religious contexts shape community patterns of crime; and (2) identifies whether these macro-level\nrelationships vary across different types of immigrant contexts or are contingent upon the type of\nreligious adherence present in a community. The current study seeks to fill this gap by examining the\nrelationships between mainline Protestant, evangelical Protestant, and Catholic adherence and rates of\nserious violent crime across emerging, established, and other immigrant destinations throughout the\n1.2. Religion and Crime at the Macro-Level\nSocial scientists interested in patterns of crime across communities have overwhelmingly focused\non structural features of communities, especially measures of disadvantage, to explain differences in\ncrime across place. Over the past several decades, measures of poverty, unemployment, and mobility\nhave been found to be \"among the strongest macro-level predictors of crime\" (Pratt and Cullen 2005,\np. 397; see also Peterson and Krivo 2005). Increasingly, however, prominent scholars, both within the\nsociology of religion and criminology, have supplemented and extended such research by examining\n1 Religious traditions are typically delineated using the RELTRAD scheme (Steensland et al. 2000), in which denominations are\ngrouped into Catholic, Jewish, evangelical Protestant, mainline Protestant, black Protestant, and \"other\" religious traditions.\nFor clarity, evangelical Protestantism emphasizes a personal relationship with Christ, the inspiration of the Bible, the\nimportance of sharing faith with non-believers (i.e., evangelism), and is usually seen as being more theologically and socially\nconservative. Examples of such denominations include Baptist, Pentecostal, and Church of God. In contrast, mainline\nProtestantism is considered theologically liberal or moderate (though this \"tradition\" is quite a bit more heterogeneous than\nevangelical Protestantism),\nthe way macro-level patterns of crime are shaped by cultural and civic characteristics of communities,\nespecially religious ones, which are thought to buffer against crime and other social problems as\nFor example, religious organizations and their adherents promote cultural belief systems\nemphasizing morality, benevolence, and support for laws and societal rules that should work to\nreduce crime (Hirschi and Stark 1969) and, in some cases, may encourage intergroup contact, civic\nengagement, and informal supervision that reduces offending (Putnam 2000). Likewise, drawing\ntheoretically from classic Chicago School themes, civic community perspectives stress that local\nreligious organizations augment social networks and aid in the production of social capital that\ncan, among other things, foster informal social control among community residents (Lee 2006) in\nways consistent with Putnam (2000) emphasis on \"bridging\" residents of communities through faith\nworks. Moreover, systemic models of social disorganization suggest that the permeation of religion at\nthe macro-level strengthens social ties (both parochial and private) by increasing community-wide\ninstitutional engagement and social interaction (Bursik and Grasmick 1993). In turn, these social\nnetworks can increase community levels of collective efficacy and guardianship in ways that reduce\nand material support (e.g., assistance with food, clothing, finances, transportation, housing, counseling,\nas well as physical and mental health care) that helps counter the disadvantages residents face and\nthat are commonly linked to strain and crime (Merton 1938). Indeed, research by Johnson et al. (2000)\ndemonstrates the critical role played by religion, especially in disadvantaged contexts, in reducing\ncriminal behaviors. Finally, drawing from institutional anomie theory, greater religious adherence is\nthought to decrease crime rates by strengthening the role of non-economic institutions that provide\nnormative control in communities (Chamlin and Cochran 1995; Messner and Rosenfeld 1994) or\nthat provide conventional social bonds, as well as cultural belief systems that emphasize morality,\nbenevolence, and support for laws and societal rules consistent with social bonding theories of crime\nIn support of these theoretical perspectives, research to-date finds that places with a greater\npresence of religious adherents have lower rates of juvenile homicide (Lee and Bartkowski 2004)\nand violent crime more broadly, net of other key structural features (Harris and Feldmeyer 2015;\ngroups (namely mainline Protestants and Catholics) are more likely to promote \"bridging social capital\"\nthat enhances social networks, strengthens between-group ties, and encourages community-wide\ncoordination (Sampson and Raudenbush 1999) than other religious groups (namely evangelical\nProtestants), which can foster \"bonding social capital that creates strong ties among in-group members\nbut does less to encourage wider outreach to the community\" (Putnam 2000). Consistent with\nsuch expectations, several studies report either null or negative associations between mainline\nProtestant or Catholic adherence and crime, but find that evangelical Protestant adherence is positively\nShihadeh and Winters 2010). However, outside of these few exceptions, research offers little insight\nabout macro-level religion and crime relationships, especially across distinct religious traditions.\n1.3. Religion and Crime in Immigrant Destinations\nParalleling this macro-level religion-crime literature, questions remain as to how religious\nadherence, especially to specific traditions, is linked to crime in different types of communities,\nincluding those into which immigrants migrate. Indeed, there is a growing consensus among\nsocial scientists that immigration does not contribute to crime in the manner often espoused in\npolitical and public rhetoric, and, in fact, is often negatively associated with community levels of\nviolence (for a recent meta-analysis, see Ousey and Kubrin (2018)). In turn, scholars have suggested\n(but rarely tested) that religion may be a key protective mechanism through which immigration\ninsulates communities from crime (Harris and Feldmeyer 2015; Shihadeh and Winters 2010). Certainly\nthe immigrant assimilation literature and leading \"immigrant revitalization\" perspectives emphasize\nreligious institutions and their adherents as sources of social support, familiar cultural traditions, and\nsocial ties that help new (and not so new) immigrants overcome the barriers they face in their new\nreligious context may provide a \"shot of morality\" (Harris and Feldmeyer 2015, p. 229) or function as\na central spoke in the \"umbrella of social control\" (Shihadeh and Winters 2010, p. 628) that insulates\nimmigrant communities from social problems.\nYet, beginning around the turn of the 21st century, immigrant settlement within the United States\nbegan to expand outside the traditional, urban locales near the border in favor of emerging destinations\nwithin counties and states without much history of immigrant reception, including smaller cities,\nCertainly, the story of immigrant population growth has been a profoundly uneven one in which\n\"the immigrant population more than doubled in 19 states, many of which had little prior experience\nwith the foreign born\" (Terrazas 2011, p. 1). Still other communities fall somewhere in between,\nexperiencing some small but steady immigrant population growth different than in traditional or\nemerging destinations. Central to our purposes here, the result is that immigrant communities differ\ngreatly in their histories of settlement in ways that might condition the relationship between religion\nand crime at the macro-level, especially as it regards the three largest religious traditions: Catholic,\nevangelical Protestant, and mainline Protestant.\nIndeed, there are good reasons to suspect that religious adherence as a milieu effect may operate\ndifferently across immigrant communities. First, a large proportion of immigrants arriving over the\npast several decades are of Hispanic origin, with many having long participated in the Catholic faith\nmay look to the Catholic Church for help in organizing their social lives and for orienting themselves\nin their new communities. However, this may work differently in emerging destinations as compared\nto more traditional ones, with competing expectations as to whether Catholic adherence protects\nagainst crime more in one or the other types of contexts. On the one hand, emerging immigrant locales\nhave fewer alternative civic organizations for new Hispanic immigrants (Shihadeh and Winters 2010)\nand, as such, the Catholic Church may function as a vehicle for assimilation and protection in more\npronounced ways in such places. On the other hand, traditional immigrant communities have longer\nhistories of Hispanic settlement and a larger \"critical mass\" of Catholic adherents (and more established\ninstitutions and places of worship). As a result, the Catholic Church may be more established as a\npillar of the community in traditional immigrant destinations and may be better positioned to provide\nsocial capital and protective benefits to help minimize crime in established immigrant communities.\nSecond, while previous research has found evangelical Protestantism to be positively associated\nwith crime (Beyerlein and Hipp 2005; Shihadeh and Winters 2010), it may have stronger effects in\nsome types of immigrant communities than others. For example, the relative presence of evangelical\nadherents has been linked to greater bonding capital that promotes in-group solidarity and insularity\nand that creates barriers to forming broader community-wide social networks (or exacerbates tension\nwith outgroups that undermines cooperation and social control efforts across groups). As such, we\nmight expect evangelical Protestantism to yield few (if any) benefits to crime prevention in emerging\nimmigrant destinations because few immigrants arrive in the U.S. already attached to or seeking\nconnections with such institutions. At the same time, evangelical adherence may not be associated\nwith increased rates of crime in emerging immigrant communities, simply because the kinds of\nin-group/out-group tension suggested by prior research (e.g., Beyerlein and Hipp 2005) have not\ndeveloped given the relatively recent presence of immigrants in such communities. In traditional\nimmigrant destinations, however, evangelical adherence might be positively associated with crime, as\nobserved in prior research, because the longer history of immigrant settlement and more established\nreligious participation patterns engender more of the bonding capital dynamics that undermine\ncommunity social control capacity (Putnam 2000).\nFinally, there are reasons to suspect that mainline Protestantism may either (a) be negatively\nassociated with crime in both emerging and traditional immigrant destinations; (b) be negatively\nassociated with crime only in traditional immigrant communities; or (c) have little or no impact\non crime in either traditional or emerging immigrant destinations. Specifically, mainline Protestant\ndenominations are thought to produce more bridging capital than evangelical adherence at the\nmacro-level, suggesting that such adherence is negatively associated with crime in all contexts\n(see Beyerlein and Hipp 2005). However, mainline Protestants represent only a small fraction of\nthe religious landscape compared to evangelical Protestants (see Table 1 below) and are especially\nheterogeneous in their community outreach, with only a small proportion that are classified as \"civically\nengaged\" (Tolbert et al. 1998; see also Lee and Bartkowski 2004). As such, mainline Protestantism may\nbe negatively associated with crime only in traditional immigrant destinations where civic outreach\nhas had time to extend to the foreign-born population. In contrast, such adherence may also offer\nlittle crime-prevention benefits, regardless of destination type, because adherence to other religious\ntraditions (e.g., Catholicism) matters more.\nIn sum, there are reasons to suspect that adherence to specific religious traditions could link to\neither higher or lower community crime rates (or null relationships) and that these associations may\ndiffer widely across established and emerging immigrant destinations. Yet, to our knowledge, only a\nsingle study has directly examined the link between religious contextual characteristics and crime in\nimmigrant destinations. Using year 2000 Latino homicide victimizations, Shihadeh and Winters (2010)\nfound that Catholic participation is unrelated to Latino homicide in emerging and traditional\ndestinations, while mainline Protestant adherence is positively associated with rates of Latino\nhomicide in emerging destinations (but not in traditional communities). Although it offers numerous\ncontributions to this line of inquiry, their analysis is limited to the assessment of Latino homicide\nvictimization and uses year 2000 data. Thus, our goal here is to extend the seminal work of\nShihadeh and Winters (2010) and the broader religion-crime literature to examine how various types\nof religious adherence predict serious violence (both lethal and non-lethal) in emerging as compared\nto established immigrant communities. We now describe the parameters of the current study.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Sources of Data\nData for the current study are drawn from three sources. First, we utilize the Uniform Crime\nReporting (UCR) program's county-level database of offenses known to law enforcement for the years\n2009\u00ad2011 that record the number of offenses reported or detected by the police for each agency. Second,\nwe pair our crime data with measures of macro-structural characteristics, including immigration\nand key control variables, derived from the United States Census summary files and American\nCommunity Survey for the year 2010. Third, characteristics of the religious context are drawn from\nthe Religious Congregations and Membership Survey (RCMS) for the year 2010. The RCMS provides\na county-by-county enumeration of religious bodies in the U.S. as tallied by the National Council of\nChurches and the Glenmary Research Center with each participating religious body supplying the\nnumber of churches, full members, adherents (affiliated members of a congregation or those who\nregularly attend services), and other church population estimates (Jones et al. 2002).\nThough we are unaware of any viable alternative data sources for assessing the link between\nthe religious context and crime across a large number of units at the macro-level, we recognize\nseveral caveats in using the RCMS. One limitation is that it likely undercounts some religious\nadherents, especially minorities (Finke and Scheitle 2005), even though the 2010 RCMS data\nhave devoted considerable effort to alleviating this problem relative to prior data collection\nefforts (Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies 2012).2 Additionally, the RCMS\ndata cannot capture degrees of participation or more nuanced aspects of adherence (e.g., level of\ninvolvement, belief, attachment, or race/ethnic-specific adherence). We acknowledge that these are\nimportant nuances impacting the religious milieu in a given community, and that should be explored.\nAs such, we highlight these in our concluding discussion as important avenues for future research.\nNevertheless, we rely on the population of religious adherents because it is an established measure\nof the institutional permeation of religion in a locale and because it captures the type of collective\nadherence that is thought to shape normative cultural milieu and foster social control, as suggested in\n2.2. Units of Analysis\nOur unit of analysis is the county, which we use for three reasons. First, counties are the\nsmallest aggregate units for which religious contextual data via the RCMS are available. Although\nsome scholars might prefer smaller study units, many of the theoretical frameworks supporting\nmacro-level research (e.g., civic community, social disorganization, institutional anomie) are not\nrestricted to neighborhoods or smaller units, but have in many instances been applied to larger units\nof varying sizes (e.g., counties, states, and even nations) (see for example Lee and Bartkowski 2004;\nOgsood and Chambers 2000). Second, counties provide a large enough sample size to include an\nadequate number of covariates while retaining statistical power to detect effects. Third, most prior\nresearch examining religion and crime at the macro-level has used counties as a unit of analysis and\nhas illustrated that they are well-suited for identifying macro-level patterns of religious participation\nWe restrict our sample of counties to those that provide violent crime estimates to the FBI's UCR\nforeign-born persons residing within them in 2010.3 There are approximately 1359 counties meeting\nthese criteria, together covering the majority of the U.S. population and violent crime in the United\nStates (Federal Bureau of Investigation 2010). Following prior research (Harris and Feldmeyer 2013;\nLichter and Johnson 2009), we partitioned these counties into \"traditional\" and \"emerging\" immigrant\nlocales: traditional destinations were defined as those counties in which the foreign-born population in\ndelineated as those counties where the percentage of foreign-born persons was less than the national\nbetween 1990 and 2000. All counties not fitting into either of these two categories but which met our\nbasic population requirements were considered \"other\" immigrant destinations and are presented\nalongside our findings for the traditional and emerging destinations as a point of comparison. Our final\n2 Some attempts have been made to correct the undercount problem in the 2010 RCMS, but minorities in marginal\ndenominations (or those which are non-denominational) are often overlooked because they lack resources for data collection\nefforts. Though few alternative data sources exist, it is important to keep in mind that some adherents may still be missing\ndespite efforts to capture them. This also hinders our ability to construct a longitudinal database for examining change over\ntime, since there is an issue of reliability across multiple points.\n3 We also ran a full battery of diagnostic tests to assess the impact of influential cases in our sample of counties.\nNo outliers were identified using standard DFFIT cut-off points, and Cook's D tests revealed several potential outliers\nthat did not substantively influence the results when removed from supplemental models. We also conducted\nBreusch-Pagan/Cook-Weisberg tests and visually assessed plots of residuals versus fitted values, which revealed little\nindication of heteroskedasticity. In addition, we inspected the geographic distribution of counties to assess whether spatial\nautocorrelation could be a problem. Preliminary analyses using Moran's I statistics revealed no significant effects of spatial\nautocorrelation in our models with many spatial \"islands\" appearing in the subsamples of emerging, traditional, and other\nimmigrant destinations.\n4 None of our counties were classified simultaneously as emerging, established, or \"other\" immigrant destinations\n(see Painter-Davis (2016) for a discussion of this issue). Alternative methods of defining immigrant destinations resulted\nin some of the counties in our \"other\" category being reclassified as \"emerging\" or (in fewer cases) \"traditional\"\n(see Harris and Feldmeyer (2013); Painter-Davis (2016) for similar alternative specification tests). Our primary results\n2.3. Dependent Variables\nThe dependent variables for this study are county-level homicide, robbery, and aggravated assault\ncounts centered on the year 2010. Following prior research, violence counts are averaged across a\nthree-year period (2009\u00ad2011) to provide greater stability to our measures as well as to ensure adequate\noffense counts for statistically rare offenses like homicide.5 Data drawn from official justice agency\nsources are subject to well-known critiques, namely that they (a) underestimate true levels of offending\nand (b) are confounded to some degree by enforcement efforts, attention, and policies of state and\nlocal police. We recognize these caveats, but note that the current study's measure of crime includes\n\"offenses known\" to law enforcement (through report/detection), rather than only those that result in\narrest. Our analysis also focuses on established measures of serious violence (especially homicide and\nrobbery) that are more reliably measured and less subject to police discretion or enforcement practices\nacross locales (Lafree et al. 2008; Steffensmeier and Haynie 2000). Finally, we include a control for\npolice force size using a measure of logged police per capita.\nAlthough some macro-level studies of immigration and crime have examined race/ethnic-specific\nWadsworth 2010). The current study relies on overall or total county rates of violence for several\nreasons. First, race/ethnic-specific crime data that code Latinos separately from Whites and Blacks\nare not widely available for all of the offenses and U.S. counties examined here. Second, those that\ndo are generally limited to either a single offense, like homicide (e.g., the mortality files from the\nCenters for Disease Control; Supplemental Homicide Reports, see Shihadeh and Winters (2010)), or to\narrest figures from a few select states (e.g., California or New York databases--see Ulmer and Harris\n(2013)). Last, prior research has already provided analyses of religious context and Latino homicide\nvictimization in immigrant communities (Shihadeh and Winters 2010). Yet, questions remain about\nwhether these relationships apply to (1) serious violent offending; (2) other non-lethal measures of\nviolence (e.g., robbery and aggravated assault); and (3) broader or overall populations (including but\nnot limited to Latinos) in both new and established destinations.\n2.4. Independent Variables\nIn light of our focus on the link between recent immigration, religious contextual characteristics,\nand violent crime, we include several key independent variables. First, we include a measure of the\npercent foreign born, defined as the proportion of the total population that is foreign born (hereafter,\nreferred to interchangeably as immigration and immigrant presence). We use this measure because a\ncareful review of prior literature demonstrates that this is one of the most common measures used to\ndelineate the relative presence of foreign-born arrivals (Ousey and Kubrin 2018). Second, following\nprior research on religion and crime at the macro-level, we utilize three measures of religious adherence:\nmainline (Protestant) adherence, evangelical (Protestant) adherence, and Catholic adherence, with\neach defined as the percentage of the total population of the county that adheres to each religious\ntradition (see also footnote 1).6\nremain the same regardless of how we classify communities by their recent histories of immigrant settlement (see our\nsupplemental models and robustness checks section).\n5 Because we rely on three years of data (2009\u00ad2011), there are relatively few counties reporting zero offenses (only 128 out\nof 1359--or about 9%--report zero values for homicide). Diagnostic tests regarding the appropriateness of zero-inflated\nmodels revealed that standard negative binomial models were more appropriate.\n6 Relevant for our discussion of key religious contextual measures, we rely on estimates of adherents because (a) including\nonly full members misses a large proportion of the religiously-affiliated population who might help to exert social control\nin the community; (b) prior research on religious contexts has almost exclusively used counts of adherents (e.g., Lee 2008;\nLee and Bartkowski 2004; Ulmer and Harris 2013); and (c) membership is determined by the by-laws of each participating\ncongregation, making the estimation of the member population sensitive to the particularities of congregations present to a\ngreater degree than the measuring the adherent population (Jones et al. 2002).\nIn addition to our religious contextual variables, we include several measures to control for social\nand demographic characteristics of counties that may be linked to immigration, religious adherence,\nand violence. To account for county socioeconomic conditions, we created a concentrated disadvantage\nindex using principal components analysis to combine four commonly used disadvantage indicators\n(see Land et al. 1990; Harris and Feldmeyer 2013): poverty (percentage of population below\nthe poverty line), unemployment (percentage of the civilian labor force aged 16\u00ad59 years that\nis unemployed), female headship (percentage of families with children under 18 years headed\nby a female), and low education (percentage of residents aged 25+ years without a high school\ndegree). In addition, because of their demonstrated relevance in previous studies, we include as\ncontrols: residential mobility (percentage of households that experienced housing turnover during the\n2005\u00ad2010 period) and an entropy measure of racial/ethnic heterogeneity of the county population\n(Reardon and Firebaugh 2002). Additionally, to capture segregation/integration between immigrants\nand native-born residents, we also included a measure of immigrant-native segregation using the\nindex of dissimilarity (Feldmeyer et al. 2015; Massey and Denton 1988). To separate out the impact of\nreligious adherence from political conservatism, we also included a measure of the percent Republican\nvoting within the county (out of all votes cast in the 2008 presidential election). Finally, as basic\ndemographic controls, we also included variables for the logged population density, percent urban,\nlogged police per capita as a control for variations across counties in law enforcement activity, and\nregion dummy variables (the latter four measures are included in analyses but not shown given space\nconstraints; see note in Table 2).\n2.5. Analytic Techniques\nOur analysis unfolds as follows. First, we present descriptive statistics with an emphasis on mean\nlevels of violence, immigration, religious adherence, and our other key measures across traditional,\nemerging, and other immigrant locales. Second, because of the skewed distribution of known homicide,\nrobbery, and aggravated assault incidents across counties and their over-dispersion (see Osgood 2000),\nwe construct a series of multivariate negative binomial regression models regressing each of our three\nreligious adherence measures--mainline Protestant, evangelical Protestant, and Catholic--on each\nviolent offense along with our key independent variables. Each model includes exposure terms for\nthe population at risk (aged 18\u00ad64 years) and state-clustered standard errors to account for variation\nacross counties nested within the same states.\n2.6. Primary Results\nTable 1 displays the means and standard deviations for all of our key dependent and independent\nvariables broken out separately for emerging, traditional, and other immigrant destinations. We noted,\nfirst, that there are very small differences in mean violence rates across the different types of immigrant\ndestinations. Only aggravated assault rates (per 100,000 as shown in Table 1) are somewhat greater\ntraditional immigrant settlements (mean of 1122.86), a difference of over 20 percent. Both homicide\nand robbery rates differ by less than 10% across destination types.\nSecond, religious adherence differs substantially across destination type. Where evangelical\nProtestants make up the largest adherent share in both emerging and other immigrant destinations\n(means of 26.86 and 24.18 percent of the population, respectively), evangelical Protestant adherence in\ntraditional immigrant destinations is substantially lower as a share of the overall population (mean of\n15.23 percent). Instead, Catholic adherents, on average, represent the largest single adherent group in\ntraditional destinations (mean of 19.59 percent), whereas Catholic adherence in emerging destinations\n(mean of 9.54 percent) lags behind even mainline Protestantism (mean of 11.33 percent). Likewise, other\nimmigrant destination communities have, on average, less Catholic adherence (mean of 11.52 percent)\nthan traditional immigrant settlement communities.\nTable 1. Means and standard deviations (in parentheses) for key variables by destination type.\nEmerging Traditional Other\nDependent Variables: a\na Violence rates are displayed for ease of interpretation but all subsequent models use offense counts.\nThird, we also found some important differences in macro-social characteristics across immigrant\ndestinations. Emerging immigrant communities have higher mean levels of poverty and educational\ndeficits (i.e., the percentage of the population without a high school degree) than traditional and other\ndestinations, which is broadly consistent with the profile of new immigrants drawn to low-skill labor\nopportunities in these locales (Shihadeh and Barranco 2010). Additionally, emerging destinations have\nhigher levels of segregation and Republican voters as of the 2008 election cycle. In contrast, and as\nexpected given their different histories of settlement, traditional immigrant destinations have larger\nforeign-born population shares (mean of 13.14) than both emerging (mean of 8.12) and other immigrant\ndestinations (mean of 4.58). At the same time, traditional destinations tend to have somewhat higher\nresidential mobility and are significantly more urban than any other immigrant community type.\nWe turn now to the primary focus of the current study and examine the ways in which adherence\nto each religious tradition is associated with violence across different immigrant contexts. To that\nend, Table 2 displays the results of our negative binomial regression models predicting homicide,\nrobbery, and assault in emerging (panel A), traditional (panel B), and other immigrant destinations\n(panel C). Our focus here is on differences across religious traditions in their associations with violence,\nparticularly as they vary by immigrant settlement type.\nFirst, we found that, among our religious adherence measures, only Catholic adherence has a\nconsistent, statistically significant, and negative association with violence. Furthermore, the protective\neffect of Catholic adherence is found exclusively in traditional immigrant communities. Across all three\nviolence types, greater Catholic adherence is associated with lower incidence of homicide (b = -0.007,\ncommunities, but has no association with violence in emerging destinations and is negatively associated\nwith assault (but not homicide or robbery) in other immigrant settlements. In contrast, evangelical\nadherence is positively associated with both robbery and assault, but only in traditional immigrant\ndestinations (p < 0.05). Religious adherence to any mainline Protestant groups has no significant effect\non any forms of violence examined here. Similarly, we found no significant relationships between any\nform of religious adherence and crime (net of other key variables) in emerging destinations.\nSecond, the relative size of the foreign-born population is (when statistically significant)\nuniversally associated with lower rates of crime. This finding dovetails with a now sizeable literature\nshowing that immigrants are generally less crime-prone than the domestic population (Bui 2009;\nGreenman and Xie 2008) and that immigrant concentration is commonly associated with lower\nmacro-level rates of crime (see Ousey and Kubrin (2018) for a meta-analytic review). In short, there is\nlittle evidence that immigration coincides with elevated incidence of known violence, regardless of a\ncommunity's history of immigrant settlement. However, we do note that emerging destinations show\nsomewhat less consistent effects of immigrant concentration on violence (significant effects for robbery\nonly) than either traditional or other destination counties.\nThird, among our other control variables, disadvantage is the single most consistent and robust\npredictor: where disadvantages combine in a community, violence is more common regardless of\nimmigrant settlement history. Greater racial/ethnic diversity is also significantly associated with higher\nrates of violence in all models (except for assault in emerging destinations). Residential mobility is\nassociated with increased levels of robbery and assault, but only in traditional immigrant destinations,\nwhereas percent urban is fairly consistently associated with robbery and assault (but not homicide),\nregardless of destination type. Finally, immigrant segregation from the native-born population impacts\nviolence uniquely depending on the immigrant settlement type: greater levels of immigrant segregation\nfrom the native-born populations appears to protect against all types of violence in traditional\ndestinations (perhaps exhibiting an ethnic enclave effect), but greater segregation contributes to\nmore robberies in other destinations and more assaults in emerging locales. Notably, the consistency\nof our control variables and the strength of their associations with violence often surpass those of our\nreligious contextual measures.\nTable 2.

Supplemental Models\nIn addition to our primary models, we also conducted a number of robustness checks and\nconstructed supplemental models. Specifically, (a) we explored alternative portioning of counties\nwhereby traditional destinations were defined as those with immigrant growth rates exceeding the\ngrowth rates lower than the national average in 1980 and 1990, but greater than the national average in\n2000; similarly, we constructed models that (b) used logarithmically transformed crime rates rather\nthan counts; (c) included immigrant isolation rather than unevenness as a measure of segregation\n(Massey and Denton 1988); and (d) included interaction terms for the conditional effect of religious\nadherence by disadvantage (see for example Harris and Feldmeyer (2015)). All models provided\nsubstantively similar results and the interaction terms were non-significant across all destination types\n(available upon request).\n3. Discussion\nOur goal here was to address an underexamined issue both within the religion-crime literature\nbroadly, and immigration-crime research specifically: whether different forms of religious adherence\nare associated with crime and violence uniquely across immigrant settlement contexts. The United\nStates has seen recent demographic shifts of the foreign born toward \"emerging\" destinations within\nthe interior of the United States and to suburban/rural locations even within traditional settlement\nstates (Singer 2004). As such, there is a need to explore the role played by religious organizations and\ntheir adherents in providing social capital, norms and values, and social control in ways that might\nbuffer against crime in different communities.\nOverall, we found that religious traditions varied in their relationship with known violence across\ndestination types. On the one hand, Catholic adherence was protective against crime (net of controls)\nonly in traditional immigrant destinations. On the other hand, evangelical Protestant adherence\nwas associated with higher levels of robbery and aggravated assault in the same locales. Religious\nadherence had no links to violence in emerging immigrant destinations.\nBroadly, our results suggest, first, that religion plays an important role in shaping crime in\nimmigrant communities above and beyond the more traditional structural measures employed\nthroughout macro-level social science inquiry. However, not all contexts are the same. Theoretically,\nfor example, our findings lend more support to perspectives emphasizing the bridging social capital,\nsystemic social control, and social bonds engendered by widespread Catholic adherence (Putnam 2000).\nHowever, these effects appear to be limited to traditional immigrant communities, which are more\nlikely to offer a large \"critical mass\" of adherents that can help establish the types of civic outreach and\nsocial controls needed for community crime control. Likewise, that evangelical adherence produces\nthe kinds of bonding capital and in-group/out-group insularity thought to elevate rates of crime\nis bolstered by our findings, but only in communities without substantial histories of immigration.\nIn short, the impact of religion on crime depends greatly on the kind of community in question.\nSecond, relative to the immigration-crime literature, our findings suggest that religious milieus\noffer mixed resources to immigrant communities depending on the relative presence of specific religious\ntraditions. Our findings are consistent with prior research showing that Catholic adherence is linked\nto lower rates of crime and violence (e.g., Beyerlein and Hipp 2005; Harris and Feldmeyer 2015), as\nwell as those studies finding evangelical adherence to be associated with higher rates of crime\n(e.g., Beyerlein and Hipp 2005; Shihadeh and Winters 2010). Critically, however, such relationships are\nonly observed in traditional immigrant locales--the kinds of large, metropolitan, and historical points\nof foreign-born settlement that still receive the largest share of newly arriving immigrants today.\nThird, we observed that the relative size of the foreign-born population was associated with\nlower rates of crime, regardless of where immigrants settle. Such a finding is consistent with a now\nsizeable literature within the broader social sciences (Ousey and Kubrin 2018). Put simply, immigration\ncoincides with lower rates of known violence, regardless of a community's history of immigrant\nsettlement (though emerging destinations show somewhat less consistent effects of immigration on\nviolence).\nFinally, many of our key control variables included in each of the models were robustly associated\nwith violence, often having more impactful associations with violence than several of the religious\ncontextual measures. This is not altogether surprising given that prior research has consistently\nfound these variables to be among the strongest and most consistent predictors of macro-level\ncrime rates (Pratt and Cullen 2005). For example, disadvantage was the single most consistent\npositively-associated predictor, net of religious milieu characteristics and other key controls. Likewise,\ngreater racial/ethnic diversity was significantly associated with higher rates of violence in nearly\nall cases, while residential mobility was associated with increased levels of robbery and assault in\ntraditional immigrant destinations. Percent urban was also consistently associated with robbery and\nassault, regardless of destination type. Interestingly, immigrant segregation from the native-born\npopulation was positively linked to violence in emerging and other types of immigrant destinations, but\nnegatively associated with violence in traditional immigrant locales (even while overall racial/ethnic\ndiversity was positively associated). This latter finding may reflect the protective formation of ethnic\nenclaves in established settlement locales (see for example, Feldmeyer et al. (2015)), despite the\ndestabilizing and criminogenic impact of racial heterogeneity more broadly. In contrast, segregation\nof the foreign born from the native population provides no such benefits in emerging and other\ndestinations--and, in fact, is linked to higher rates of crime--because fewer co-ethnics and cultural\nresources are available in these more isolated circumstances with little history of immigrant assimilation\nand incorporation. In sum, our findings mirror prior studies in showing that factors like disadvantage,\nheterogeneity, and residential mobility are among the primary sources of macro-level crime rates\n(Steffensmeier et al. 2010). More importantly, our findings go beyond prior work and extend this line\nof scholarship by showing that religious adherence and its intersection with immigrant communities\nis also an essential, and to date, understudied, part of the macro-level story of communities and crime.\nAlthough we see our study as advancing research at the critical intersection of immigration,\nreligion, and crime at the macro-level, we also recognize a number of limitations that warrant attention\nin future research. For example, it is beyond the scope of the current study to explore the impact\nof tradition-specific adherence on race/ethnic-disaggregated crime. Given the data constraints in\ndoing so (e.g., limited types of crime, narrow geographic scope, etc.), questions remain as to whether\nreligious adherence affects violence (or other forms of crime) equally across all race/ethnic groups in\neach type of immigrant destination. Likewise, scholarship in this area would benefit greatly from more\nnuanced religious adherence measures, including those reflecting the degree of personal participation\nand religiosity, as well as measurable religious characteristics at other units of analysis (e.g., cities,\ncensus places, or even neighborhoods). As we acknowledged in our methods section, these alternative\ndimensions of religious participation are not available across a large number of units at the present\ntime, but would substantially bolster the unfolding story of how religion manifests in different types\nof locales, including immigrant communities.\nImmigration remains a hot button issue across our nation, increasingly so after the 2016\npresidential election. Amidst concern about how immigrant flows have reshaped communities and\nimpacted social problems like crime, research directed toward immigration and the types of structural\nand cultural processes unfolding around (and in conjunction with) it will remain central to informing\nthe broader public debate. However, the current findings reaffirm the growing consensus in social\nscience research that these concerns about immigrant crime are often misplaced. Rather than increasing\ncrime and violence, it appears that traditional immigrant settlement communities are home to strong\nnetworks of Catholic adherents that help to reduce, not generate, rates of serious violent crime.\nAuthor Contributions: The idea for this research was conceived by Casey T.
