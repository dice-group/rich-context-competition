Here, we char-\nacterized a subset of postnatal PRPs (PDGF-AA-responsive\nprecursors) that express functional PDGF and  receptors\nfrom birth to adulthood. When grown in PDGF-AA, dissoci-\nated neonatal rat SVZ cells divided to produce non-adherent\nclusters of progeny. Unlike the self-renewing EGF/FGF-2-\nresponsive precursors that produce neurospheres, these PRPs\nfailed to self-renew after three passages; therefore, we refer\nto the colonies they produce as spheroids. Upon differen-\ntiation these spheroids could produce neurons, type 1 as-\ntrocytes and oligodendrocytes. When maintained in medium\nsupplemented with BMP-4 they also produced type 2 as-\ntrocytes. Using lineage tracing methods, it became evident\nthat there were multiple types of PRPs, including a subset\nthat could produce neurons, oligodendrocytes, and type 1\nand type 2 astrocytes; thus some of these PRPs represent\na unique population of precursors that are quatropotential.\nSpheroids also could be generated from the newborn neo-\ncortex and they had the same potentiality as those from\nthe SVZ. By contrast, the adult neocortex produced less than\n20% of the numbers of spheroids than the adult SVZ and\nspheroids from the adult neocortex only differentiated into\nglial cells. Interestingly, SVZ spheroid producing capacity di-\nminished only slightly from birth to adulthood.

In the neonate, PDGFR is expressed by oligo-\ndendrocyte precursors and their PSA-NCAM + (polysialated\nneural cell adhesion molecule positive) pre-progenitors (Ben-\nHur et al., 1998). These PSA-NCAM + pre-progenitors have\nbeen isolated from P6 cerebral white matter by immunopan-\nning and shown to generate oligodendrocytes and astrocytes\nzation, these PSA-NCAM + cells lacked markers for O-2A\n(oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte) progenitors, such as GD3\nand yet were able to give rise to O-2A cells that differentiated\ninto type 2 astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Grinspan et al.,\n1990a). Other studies established that PDGF is a survival fac-\ntor for these PSA-NCAM + pre-progenitors (Grinspan and\nated, they produced large percentages of oligodendrocytes\nand astrocytes, as well as a few neurons. However, clonal\nanalyses were not performed to determine whether there\nwas a common bipotential precursor or whether there were\ntwo sets of glial-restricted precursors that each expressed\nSome studies suggest that there are other multipoten-\ntial precursors in the SVZ that are PDGFR + . Although\nPDGFR + SVZ cells are generally associated with gliogene-\nsis, there are PRPs (PDGF-responsive precursors) of the E14\nventral forebrain that are tripotential, giving rise to oligo-\ndendrocytes, astrocytes and neurons (Chojnacki and Weiss,\n2004). Furthermore, in the adult brain, it has been reported\nthat there is a subset of GFAP + (glial fibrillary acidic pro-\ntein) Type B cells that are also PDGFR + (Jackson et al.,\n2006). A more recent study, however, concluded that the\nPDGFR + precursors are not stem cells, and thus distinct\nfrom the GFAP + adult stem cells of both mouse and human\nMuch of the research investigating PRPs of the SVZ have\neither focused on the glial-restricted precursors or multi-\npotential cells of embryonic brain and some of these stud-\nies are contradictory (Jackson et al., 2006; Chojnacki et al.,\n2011). To date, the PDGFR + cells of the neonatal SVZ have\nbeen poorly characterized. Therefore, the goal of this study\nwas to investigate this interesting subset of SVZ cells. We\nsought to characterize their growth requirements, to deter-\nmine whether they are stem cells or progenitors, to evaluate\nwhether this is a homogeneous or diverse cell population and\nto assess their relative abundance across the lifespan.\nSpheroid cultures\nCultures were established from Wistar rat brains across\na spectrum of ages, from postnatal day 3 (P3) to\nadult (P70) as well as from SD (Sprague\u00adDawley) rat\npups that ubiquitously expressed GFP [Sprague-Dawley-\nTg(GFP)Bal/2Rrrc (RRRC:0065) (Missouri Research Animal Di-\nagnostics Laboratory)]. Newborn rats were decapitated un-\nder sterile conditions and their brains were placed into PBS\n. Adult rats were eu-\nthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation prior to decapitation.\nIncisions were made 2 mm from the anterior end of the\nbrain and 3 mm posterior to the first cut. These blocks\nwere transferred to fresh PBS-glucose-MgCl2\nand the SVZDL\nand dorsal cerebral cortex were grossly isolated. Isolated tis-\nsue was minced with a scalpel and/or forceps. The tissue\nwas then transferred to conical tubes and centrifuged at\n200 g for 5 min. The pellet was enzymatically dissociated us-\ning a 2:3 dilution of Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies)\nor an enzyme solution containing trypsin (0.25%), collage-\nMEM-Hepes. The neonatal tissue was digested for 5\u00ad10 min\nand adult tissue for 20 min at 37C with manual agita-\ntion during incubation. An equal volume of medium sup-\nplemented to 10% NCS (newborn calf serum) was added and\nthe mixture was triturated for several cycles using P1000\nand P100 tips, adding additional media during later cycles.\nThe single-cell suspension was passed through a 100 m cell\nstrainer and then a 40 m strainer to eliminate clumped\ncells from the final mixture. Then the cells were centrifuged\nat 200 g for 5 min and the supernatant removed.\nbecco's modified Eagle's medium)/F12 medium contain-\napo-transferrin and 50 g/ml gentamycin (all purchased\nfrom Sigma\u00adAldrich, except gentamycin that was purchased\nfrom Life Technologies)].

Untreated spheroids were collected at 15 min and\ntreated spheroids were collected at either 15 or 30 min\nafter PDGF-AA addition. OPCs (oligodendrocyte progenitor\ncells) were generated from mixed glial cultures prepared\nfrom neonatal rat brains. Meninges were collected from the\nsame animals prior to isolating deeper tissues. Cells were\ncollected by gentle centrifugation and then lysed with 1%\nand protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics) dissolved\nin PBS. The cells were sonicated then centrifuged at 9300 g\nfor 15 min at 4C. The protein concentration was quanti-\nfied with the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoScien-\ntific).

The cells were fixed for 5 min in\n4% PFA and sometimes 100% methanol, blocked, and then\nincubated with TuJ1 and GFAP. The cells were washed and\nfurther incubated with secondary antibodies.

We did not observe any bipoten-\ntial spheroids containing neurons and astrocytes or unipo-\ntential spheroids when cultured in B104 CM (Figure 4D3).\nWe next sought to determine whether the spheroids\ncould also produce type 2 astrocytes. For these experiments\nspheroids from the SVZ and neocortex were grown and differ-\nentiated in either 0.5% or 20% FBS (Figure 5). After 3 days,\ncells were stained for the oligodendrocyte marker, Rmab (Fig-\ndiate filament protein of both type 1 and type 2 astrocytes,\nRmab + oligodendrocytes and A2B5 - /GFAP + type 1 as-\ntrocytes. Confirming our predictions, there were few, if any,\nA2B5 + /GFAP + type 2 astrocytes when differentiated in\nthe presence of 0.5% FBS (Figure 4A4), whereas there was\na robust production of type 2 astrocytes from the SVZ (Fig-\nure 5B4) and neocortical (Figure 5C4) spheroids when differ-\nentiated in 20% FBS.\nAlthough a high serum concentration is optimal for type 2\nastrocyte differentiation, serum is toxic for neurons in vitro.\nTherefore, to verify that a single spheroid could produce\nneurons, oligodendrocytes, type 1 astrocytes and type 2 as-\ntrocytes we lowered the concentration of serum to 0.5%\nFBS and supplemented the medium with 10 ng/ml BMP-4, to\nsimultaneously promote neuron differentiation and type 2\nastrocyte production. These culture conditions permitted a\nsingle spheroid to produce all four cell types (Figure 5D).\nIn fact, the majority of spheroids from the neonatal SVZ\nwere capable of producing neurons (Figure 5D1), type 1 (Fig-\nure 5D2) and type 2 astrocytes (Figure 5D3), and oligodendro-\ncytes (Figure 5D4). By contrast, although spheroids could be\ngenerated from the neonatal neocortex, neurons were rarely\nproduced from neocortical spheroids.\nWhereas the spheroids produced neurons, astrocytes and\noligodendrocytes, these spheroids might be comprised of\nlineage-restricted progenitors, with separate precursors for\nastrocytes and others for oligodendrocytes or neurons, or\nthey might be comprised of multipotential progenitors that\ncould give rise to all cell types. To characterize the differenti-\nation potential of individual progenitors we used replication-\ndeficient retroviruses and infected a limited number of cells.\nThe fates of cells derived from single precursors were then\nanalyzed after 5 days of differentiation (Figure 6). A colony\nwas defined as GFP + cells that were at least 150 m from\nanother cluster.

The pseudocolor images\nshow an overlay of Rmab (magenta), A2B5 (green), GFAP (red), and DAPI (blue) (A4, B4, C4). When differentiated in 0.5% FBS and\n10 ng/ml BMP-4, a single spheroid produced neurons (TUJ1), type 1 astrocytes (A2B5 - /GFAP + ), type 2 astrocytes (A2B5 + /GFAP + )\nand oligodendrocytes (Rmab) (D). Examples of the four cell types from a single spheroid neuron (D1), type 1 astrocyte (D2), type 2\nastrocyte (D3) and oligodendrocyte (D4) within the spheroid. Scale bar represents 20 m.\nTUJI + /GFP + neurons were not observed in either experi-\nment, even though TUJI + /GFP - neurons were present in\nthe cultures.\nSince specific types of neurons are known to silence retro-\nviral vector reporter gene expression (Gaiano et al., 1999), it is\npossible that neurons produced from a PRP may have silenced\nGFP expression and thus eluded detection. Therefore, we used\na co-culture system where SVZ cells were isolated from the\nSVZs of P3 transgenic GFP + neonates and their GFP - litter-\nmates, and then mixed whereupon the GFP + cells comprised\na small proportion of the total. Single cells were suspended\ncultured in 50% conditioned media. After 8 DIV, spheroids\ncontaining a mixture of GFP + and GFP - cells were fre-\nquently observed (Figure 7A); however, small spheroids com-\nprised uniformly of GFP + cells were also observed. Spheroids\nwere scored as GFP + if they contained at least five or more\nGFP + cells, even if some of the cells in the spheroid were\nGFP - (Figure 7C).\nSince many of the spheroids contained GFP + and non-\nGFP + cells, that may have formed by PRP adhesion or\nspheroid fusion, we performed a statistical analysis using the\nhypergeometric probability model to determine the proba-\nbility that the GFP + cells within a spheroid were descended\nfrom a single progenitor (Ross, 2010). Given the number of\nGFP + to GFP - cells we initially plated (3\u00d7103 GFP + to\nwhich 11 were GFP + (containing at least five GFP + cells),\nit was possible to compute the probability that a single GFP +\nPRP formed a cluster of GFP + cells within the spheroid. The\nmodel concluded that for there to be a greater than 5%\nchance that more than two GFP + PRPs are giving rise to\ndaughter cells in a single spheroid, the number k of spheroid\nforming cells within a single spheroid would have to exceed\n15 parent cells. Although k is unknown, k exceeding 15 is\nhighly unlikely based on our limited dilution assay where\nthe percentage r of spheroid-forming cells is approximately\n1% (Figure 8B). Therefore, we can conclude that in our low-\nGFP + PRPs (r = 1% of 3\u00d7103) that were spheroid forming.\ncells where the vast majority were GFP - . Thus, the likelihood\nof two or more GFP + PRPs adhering to each other in these\nculture conditions are highly improbable and, therefore, we\ncan report with almost certainty that each GFP + cluster\noriginated from one GFP + cell.\nTo assess the developmental potentials of these PRPs, all\nof the spheroids from the lowest initial plating density of\nGFP + cells were plated on to PDL and laminin-coated cham-\nber slides and differentiated in the absence of growth fac-\ntors or serum for 5 days. Clusters of GFP + cells that were\nwidely separated from each other were stained for TUJ1 (Fig-\n90 colonies and found that 51% of the clones were astrocyte-\ngenerating, 21% were oligodendrocyte-generating, 3% were\nneuron-generating, 17% were bipotential astrocyte and\noligodendrocyte generating, and 3% were bipotential as-\ntrocyte and neuron generating.

(2006) suggested that some PDGFR +\ncells in the adult SVZ were stem cells. Therefore, to deter-\nmine whether the spheroids were formed by stem cells we\ntested their self-renewal capability (Figure 8). To determine\nthe number of cells within a sphere that were self-renewing\nand capable of giving rise to subsequent spheres we used the\nlimiting dilution assay. Using informative serial dilutions we\ndetermined the ratio of sphere-forming cells within spheroid\nand neurosphere cultures. To graphically represent the Pois-\nson distribution, we generated a graph with the semi-log plot\nof the negative logarithm of the fraction of negative wells\nas compared to cell plating density (Figure 8A). The Poisson\ndistribution line intercepts x at the reciprocal negative loga-\nrithm 1/e or 37% and defines  = 1, which is linearly pro-\nportional to the mean number of sphere-forming cells. This\nanalysis showed that the cells of the neurosphere that were\ncapable of forming new neurospheres was 1 in 800 as com-\npared to the PRPs which was 1 in >1000 cells. Next we grew\nthe cells as bulk cultures and analyzed self-renewal across se-\nrial passages (Figure 8B). Across the first two passages there\nwas an amplification of cells that formed spheroids. Approxi-\nmately 1% of the total cell population directly isolated from\nthe neonatal SVZ formed spheroids whereas 4.3% of the cells\nin the 2nd passage formed secondary spheroids. However,\nfrom passage 3 through passage 4 (tertiary to quaternary) the\npercentage of self-renewing cells within the spheroids plum-\nmeted. Cells able to form tertiary spheroids generated in the\n3rd passage declined to 3.5% of the total cell population and\nat the 4th passage less than 0.1% of the total cell population\nformed spheroids.

Furthermore, primary\nneurospheres and spheroids were morphological dissimilar.\nPrior to the 1st passage the neurospheres (Figure 8B1) were\nmore circular than the spheroids (Figure 8B2). Secondary neu-\nrospheres (Figure 8B3) and spheroids (Figure 8B4) were more\nsimilar. After three serial passages, the neurospheres consis-\ntently formed new symmetrical spheres (Figure 8B5), whereas\nthe spheroids were extremely small and irregularly shaped\n(Figure 8B6). Progenitors exist outside the SVZ that can gen-\nerate new glial cells (and neurons under non-physiological\nconditions) throughout adulthood; therefore, we evaluated\nthe capacity of neocortical progenitors to generate spheroids\nand assessed their potentiality (Figure 9). Single-cell suspen-\nsions from neonatal and adult neocortices were grown in\nB104 CM. The neonatal neocortical cells (Figures 9A1 and\n9A2) formed spheroids by 7 days while the adult neocorti-\ncal cells (Figures 9B1 and 9B2) required twice the amount\nof time to produce spheroids. Surprisingly, progenitors in\nthe adult neocortex only produced spheroids when the cells\n, unlike the neonatal cells that grew\nwell in more highly oxygenated medium.

By contrast progenitors isolated from the adult neocor-\ntex did not produce neurons. Finally, we assessed the relative\nnumbers of PRPs present across the lifespan. With age the\nnumber of spheroids produced from the neocortex decreased\n(Figure 9D). By contrast, the capacity of the SVZ to produce\nspheroids was maintained.\nDISCUSSION\nThe SVZ is a germinal matrix that contains NSCs and progeni-\ntors of various potentialities. These stem and progenitor cells\nare present in the brain throughout adult life. Evidence has\nemerged to suggest that a PDGFR + precursor, with similar\npotentiality to the NSCs, also resides in this niche (Jackson\net al., 2006). Whereas previous studies on the PDGFR +\ncells of the brain have focused on their roles in gliogenesis\nstudies of the PRPs in the embryo and adult have implicated\nthem in neurogenesis (Chojnacki and Weiss, 2004; Chojnacki\nof this study was to establish a well defined in vitro culture\nsystem to study the PRPs of the postnatal SVZ, to determine\nwhether the postnatal PRPs are stem cells or progenitors, to\nassay whether they are a homogeneous or heterogeneous\npopulation and to evaluate their relative abundance across\nthe lifespan.\nPDGF-AA is a growth factor that signals through PDGFR\nto stimulate cell proliferation and to also promote cell sur-\nthe well-established neurosphere procedure to amplify the\nPRPs of the postnatal SVZ. By culturing isolated SVZ cells in\nmedia supplemented with PDGF-AA we obtained colonies of\nnonadherent cells that grew as clusters.

Neonatal cells were grown for\n7 days while the adult cells where grown for 16 days in 2% O2\nin B104 CM. Spheroids were plated on to slides and differentiated for\n5 days then stained for oligodendrocyte (O4-green) and astrocyte (GFAP-red) markers (C1, C2). The average number of spheroids from\nclusters as spheroids to distinguish them from neurospheres\nformed in EGF/FGF-2 supplemented media. Morphologically,\nprimary spheroids have an asymmetric appearance versus\nprimary neurospheres that grow as tight symmetric spheres.\nSince PDGFR is known to be associated with glial dif-\nferentiation it seemed likely that the SVZ cells that were\nPDGF-AA-responsive would only produce glial progeny (Hill\net al., 2013). However, we found that PRPs of the SVZ\nwere not only a prominent source for forebrain macroglia,\ngiving rise to oligodendrocytes and two types of astro-\ncytes, but that they also produced neurons. Neurons are\nnot traditionally thought to develop from PDGFR + pre-\ncursors. Rather, they have been shown to develop from\nEGFR + or FGFR + precursors of the VZ and SVZ. How-\never, our experiments clearly demonstrate that PDGFR +\nSVZ cells can give rise to immature neurons at least un-\ntil postnatal day 12. Using FACS, we have recently estab-\nlished that Lex + /CD133 - /NG2 + /PDGFR + cells sorted\nfrom the neonatal SVZ and from neurospheres are capable of\ndifferentiating into A2B5 - /GD3 - /GFAP + polygonal as-\ntrocytes, A2B5 - /GD3 + /GFAP + radial glial-like astrocytes,\nTuJ1 + immature neurons and O4 + oligodendrocytes when\ncultured in the presence of PDGF-AA. Thus quatropotential\nprogenitors also exist in the mouse SVZ (Buono et al., 2012).\nMoreover, our studies on the composition of the mouse SVZ\nconfirmed that the multipotential PRPs are lost as the brain\nmatures (Buono et al., 2012). Other laboratories have used\ntransgenic animals and traced the fates of NG2 + /PDGFR +\ncells throughout the adult CNS and discovered that these\ncells are capable of giving rise to new projection neurons\nin the ventral forebrain and in the piriform cortex (Rivers\net al., 2008). More specifically NG2 + /PDGFR + cells have\nbeen shown to differentiate into functional pyramidal glu-\ntamatergic neurons in the piriform cortex (Guo et al., 2010).\nLike the SVZ, spheroids produced multiple cell types as\nassessed using a panel of markers that identified immature\noligodendrocytes, type 1 astrocytes, type 2 astrocytes and\nneurons. Surprisingly a majority of spheroids analyzed in\nthe B104 CM and PDGF-AA supplemented media produced\nspheroids that were capable of generating oligodendrocytes,\nastrocytes and neurons at the same ratio as the neurospheres.\nWe initially hypothesized that our culture conditions would\nbe optimal for growing glial lineage restricted progenitors\nbut our results contradicted that hypothesis. Not only were\nC 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nL. Moore and others\nthese PRPs tripotential, making neurons, type 1 astrocytes\nand oligodendrocytes, but they were also capable of gen-\nerating type 2 astrocytes. An important conclusion of our\nstudies is that there is a unique, quatropotential progenitor\nwithin the SVZ.\nDespite multiple attempts, we were unable to culture sin-\ngle PRPs to study their differentiation potentials. Therefore,\nto study single PRPs we used replication-incompetent retro-\nviral fate mapping. In these studies, over 96% of the virally\ninfected colonies contained identifiable glial cells. The ma-\njority of the colonies (65%) only generated astrocytes and\n20% contained only oligodendrocytes. A third subset, ap-\nproximately 10% of the progenitors, produced both oligo-\ndendrocytes and protoplasmic astrocytes. A small fraction of\nthe infected cells (3\u00ad4%) did not stain for either GFAP or\nO4. These clones were likely comprised of progenitors that\nhad not yet acquired lineage-restricted markers. Clusters of\nneurons and glia were not observed.\nSince subsets of neurons, and striatal neurons in particu-\nlar, can silence retroviral promoters (Gaiano et al., 1999), we\nperformed fate-mapping studies using mixtures of GFP +\nand GFP - PRPs. At the ratio analyzed for these studies,\nGFP + cells comprised only 0.6% of the total population, en-\nabling us to assess clonality. Many of the resulting spheroids\nwere a mixture of GFP + and GFP - cells, which is con-\nsistent with previous studies that showed that precursors\ncan adhere to each other to form spheres and that smaller\nspheres can aggregate and eventually fuse to become a single\nlarger sphere (Ladiwala et al., 2012). While spheroid fusion\ncan complicate clonal analyses, the results of the hyperge-\nometric probability model, using parameters matching our\nexperimental setup, indicate that there is a less than 5%\nprobability that two or more GFP + cells contributed to a\nsingle spheroid even when 15 cells contributed to the for-\nmation of a spheroid. Our limited dilution studies indicate\nthat this overestimates the number of spheroid forming cells,\nthus the probability that two or more GFP + cells formed a\nspheroid is even less.\nIn the PRP mixing experiments, 51% of the colonies\nwere astrocyte-generating, 21% were oligodendrocyte-\ngenerating, 3% were neuron-generating, 17% were bipo-\ntential astrocyte and oligodendrocyte-generating, 3% were\nbipotential astrocyte and neuron-generating, none produced\noligodendrocytes and neurons and 4% were tripotential,\ngenerating astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Thus,\nusing two different approaches for lineage analyses, we have\ndetermined that the PRPs are very heterogeneous with unipo-\ntential, bipotential, tripotential and presumably quatropo-\ntential progenitors capable of generating oligodendrocytes\nand two types of astrocytes, as well as a subset of neurons.\nMoreover, our results show that the PRPs of the SVZ re-\ntain their proliferative and multi-potentiality into adulthood\nwhereas PRPs in the neocortex become depleted and lineage\nrestricted. The adult neocortical spheroids did not produce\nneurons, unlike the spheroids from the neonatal neocortex.\nThis suggests that the PRPs in the adult neocortex, although\ncapable of proliferating, are glial lineage restricted and thus\ndifferent from the PRPs of the neonate. There is a contro-\nversy over whether some NSCs are PDGFR + (Jackson et al.,\nand the spheroids have similar differentiation potentials but\nthe PRPs have limited self-renewal capacity. After four serial\npassages, the neurosphere-forming cells retained their ability\nto form subsequent spheres, however, the spheroid-forming\ncells after repeated passages became depleted. Previous stud-\nies on mouse PRPs found that these cells could be passaged\nwhen FGF-2 was added to the media (Chojnacki and Weiss,\n2004). However, given that other studies have shown that\nFGF-2 de-differentiates cells in vitro we did not add FGF-2 to\nour medium (Kondo and Raff, 2000). Moreover, in our exper-\niments, rat PRPs could be grown as spheroids and passaged\nwithout FGF-2 for up to three generations. Therefore, PRPs,\nand even the quatropotential PRPs, appear to have a limited\nself-renewal capacity and, therefore, by definition are not\nstem cells. These data confirm and extend the work of Choj-\nnacki and colleagues (Chojnacki and Weiss, 2004; Chojnacki\nSpheroids formed at low plating densities, supporting the\nview that a spheroid can be derived from a single PDGF-\nAA responsive precursor. However, the spheroids grew more\nrobustly at high densities, and providing conditioned me-\ndia from high density spheroid cultures restored the growth\npotential of the low density plated cells. These observations\nsuggest that these PRPs secrete factors that exert autocrine\nand/or paracrine signaling effects. Although the exact mech-\nanism is unknown, it has been suggested that growth factor-\ndependent SHH (sonic hedgehog) signaling promotes sur-\nvival, growth and/or self-renewal of PRPs (Chojnacki and\nWeiss, 2004). When PRPs were grown in the presence of\ncyclopamine, an inhibitor of SHH signaling, colony size and\nnumber were reduced. Conversely, when the PRPs were grown\nin the presence of SHH their numbers increased. These data\nsuggest that SHH is promoting the ability of PRPs to produce\nspheroids.\nThe detection of increased levels of phosphorylated ERK-\n1 and 2 after PDGF-AA stimulation provides direct evidence\nthat these cells express functional PDGF receptors. Although\nspheroids that were constantly grown in PDGF-AA did express\nlow levels of the PDGF receptors, they responded poorly to\nPDGF stimulation with no significant change in downstream\ntargets molecules (data not shown). Since it has been well es-\ntablished that cells down-regulate growth factor receptors in\nthe constant presence of growth factors, we removed the in-\nsulin and PDGF-AA in the medium for 6 h prior to stimulating\nthe cells with PDGF-AA and collecting protein for Western\nblot analyses. Using this modified culture paradigm we were\nable to detect both PDGFR and PDGFR and demonstrated\nthat ERK-1 and 2 phosphorylation increased upon PDGF stim-\nulation.\nDespite the fact that the majority of cells within the\nspheroids were PSA-NCAM + , the spheroids were clearly\ncomprised of a mixed population of cells that expressed\n78 C 2014 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) which permits unrestricted use, distribution\nand reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nPDGF-responsive SVZ progenitors\nmarkers of both restricted and unrestricted progenitors.

This was unexpected given\nthat GD3 is highly expressed in the in vivo neonatal SVZ.\nSince an in vitro culture system has not been well es-\ntablished to grow PRPs of the postnatal SVZ, we evaluated\ncombinations of B104 CM and PDGF-AA +\n- noggin, as these\ngrowth supplements have been used to propagate neural pre-\nthese culture media formulations all generated 80% PSA-\nNCAM + cells, where PSA-NCAM is a marker established to be\nexpressed by both precursors capable of producing neurons,\nastrocytes and oligodendrocytes. There was no significance\nbetween the individual conditions. These in vitro results sup-\nport previous in vivo studies of postnatal SVZ-derived precur-\nsors, where 80% expressed PSA-NCAM (Levison and Gold-\nman, 1997). Spheroids produced in medium supplemented\nto 30% B104 CM generated the most equivalent balance\nbetween astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, while maintain-\ning the highest percentage of GFAP - /O4 - cells, which are\nlikely non-lineage-restricted progenitors.\nSpheroids grew larger when maintained in 2% O2\nversus\n. This observation is analogous to previous studies\nthat showed that O2\ntension is a critical determinant in NSC\net al., 2011). These studies also showed that growth in 5% O2\nexpanded nestin + /CD133 + /CD24 + precursors that read-\nily differentiated into all three neural lineages, whereas neu-\nral precursors maintained in 20% O2\npreferentially generated\nastrocytes regardless of the presence of other mitogens (Chen\ncreases in O2\ntension promoted oligodendrocyte maturation,\nwhich is similar to our findings. However, we did not observe\nthe ratio of oligodendrocytes to astrocytes being affected\nby the concentration of O2\n, likely because our studies were\nperformed on rat progenitors which are less sensitive to O2\nthan either mouse or human neural precursors (Chen et al.,\nAdult PRPs have been postulated to be tumor-initiating\ncells in the adult neocortex since they are slowly dividing cells\nthat can produce both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and\npersist across the lifespan (Assanah et al., 2009). Although\ngliomas are known to start from a single transformed cell\nand they are most frequently found in the adult neocortex,\nour data suggest that some tumor-initiating cells might also\nreside within the SVZ; however, were one of the SVZ PRPs to\nbecome transformed, it would more likely form a primitive\nneuroectodermal tumor rather than a glioma.\nThe experiments were conceived and designed by Jennifer\nBain, Lisamarie Moore and Steven Levison. Experiments were\nperformed by Jennifer Bain and Lisamarie Moore. Data were\nanalyzed by Jennifer Bain, Lisamarie Moore, Ji Meng Loh and\nSteven Levison. All authors assisted in crafting the text of the\nfinal manuscript.\n"
