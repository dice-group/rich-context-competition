Green, MD\nBackground: Significant investments and effort are being devoted to health care reform, yet little is\nknown about the costs of improvements. Practical tools are needed to allow for systematic assessment\nof practice expenses. We report here a field trial of a standardized expenditure data collection instru-\nment.\nMethods: Combining economic and primary care practice consultation, an expenditure data collec-\ntion instrument was created. The instrument underwent observed feasibility testing and was fielded by\n10 practice-based research networks in 30 practices conducting 10 different health behavior change\ninterventions.\nResults: Start-up and operating expenses were successfully collected for 87% and 97% of the prac-\ntices, respectively. Data collection time and effort were considerable but acceptable. Three elements\nwere necessary to collect expenditure data: (1) an intervention-specific data collection instrument, (2) a\nfield guide, and (3) economic oversight and assistance. Fully 90% of networks reported that they\nplanned to collect expenditure data in the future and study participation increased the likelihood of\ntheir participation in a future expenditure study.\nConclusions: It is feasible to systematically collect intervention-specific expenses in primary care\nusing formal expenditure methods. However, most practices and researchers lack the knowledge, ex-\npertise, and resources to collect such data independently. Further assistance and education is necessary\nto obtain reliable information about the expenses to transform and improve primary care. (J Am Board\nKeywords: Primary Health Care, Health Care Economics and Organizations\nQuality improvement, evidence translation, and\npractice redesign are necessary to improve the de-\nlivery of primary care in America. Examples range\nfrom payers incentivizing and mandating e-pre-\nscribing or quality performance reporting to calls\nfor transforming existing practices into patient-\ncentered medical homes.1\u00ad5 These changes have\ngreat potential for benefit, yet the costs and re-\nsources required for implementation remain un-\nknown. Without information about additional ex-\npenses associated with redesign, practices cannot\nstipulate the financial requirements they bear to\nimplement systems and services, payers can claim\nsufficient payment has already been made, and poli-\ncymakers can defer action because judgment about\nvalue is not possible.\nAs new models of care and revamped reimburse-\nment systems emerge,4,6,7 primary care practices\nneed to use established financial and economic\nmethods to understand the expenses associated\nwith the provision of care. These same methods\nwill also need to be used to understand comparative\neffectiveness. Collecting this information will re-\nquire primary care researchers and clinicians to\nbecome more knowledgeable and skillful in collect-\ning expenditure information. Currently there are\nfew tools designed to collect and analyze expendi-\nture data in primary care settings.\nThis article was externally peer reviewed.\nFrom the Department of Family Medicine, Virginia\nCommonwealth University, Richmond (AK); the Depart-\nment of Family Medicine, University of Colorado Denver,\nAurora (MC, LAG); and The Robert Graham Center,\nWashington, D.C.

Krist, MD, MPH, PO Box\nvcu.edu).\nPrescription for Health (P4H), a 6-year, 2-cy-\nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, funded\n22 primary care practice-based research networks\n(PBRNs) to develop and test 27 practical health\nbehavior change interventions.8 \u00ad10 The focus of\nthe initiative was to develop and test whether\nthese interventions improved patients' health be-\nhaviors.11\u00ad14 However, the funders recognized\nthat, for these interventions to be translated out-\nside of the research setting and into the real\nworld, an understanding of expenses incurred by\npractices to implement and field the interven-\ntions was necessary. As a result, credible practice\nexpenditure estimates were systematically col-\nlected using a standardized instrument by all 10\nPBRNs participating in the second cycle of the\ninitiative. These expenditure results, which have\nbeen previously published, clearly demonstrate\nthat implementing and fielding health behavior\nchange interventions is not free for primary care\npractices. In fact, practices bore a mean monthly\nparticipated in the intervention.15 This article\nreports on the development, feasibility, and our\nexperience using a standardized expenditure data\ncollection instrument as a model for systemati-\ncally gathering expenditure data for implement-\ning practice innovations.\nMethods\nWe conducted a 4-step practical field trial to create\nand field an expenditure data collection instrument\ncombining economic and primary care practice ex-\npertise. The steps included creating a preliminary\nversion of the instrument, pilot testing and modi-\nfying the instrument, fielding the final instrument\nin 30 practices from 10 PBRNs that were conduct-\ning different health behavior change interventions,\nand surveying the PBRNs after intervention to\nevaluate their experiences with the collection of\nexpenditure data.\nInstrument Development\nAn expenditure steering committee, with exper-\ntise in economics, primary care, and the P4H\ninitiative, was assembled to develop a common\nand generalizable method to assess expenditures\nthat would allow for aggregation and assessment\nof information across the 10 funded projects.\nThe steering committee consisted of an econo-\nmist, the primary care researchers conducting the\nP4H studies (PBRN members), and members of\nthe P4H National Program Office. Limited re-\nsources were available to fund the collection and\nanalysis of expenditure data ($5,000 per network)\nso a simple, generalizable, and actionable process\nwas required.\nThe overarching research question guiding the\nsteering committee was, \"What are the incremental\nin-practice expenses attributable to the P4H inter-\nventions?\" Guided by this central question and\nafter consideration of alternative standard eco-\nnomic and financial methods (cost minimization\nanalysis, cost-effectiveness analysis, cost utility\nanalysis, cost benefit analysis), the committee de-\ntermined that the most appropriate methodology\nwas an expenditure analysis.16 The committee did\nnot opt to use a more simple costing method; they\nchose instead a formal expenditure analysis ap-\nproach to generate more valid, reproducible, and\ngeneralizable findings. Similarly, the committee\ndecided not to use modeling, forecasting, or esti-\nmations; they chose instead to conduct a prospec-\ntive observational evaluation of actual practice ex-\npenses. The perspective adopted (ie, who bore the\nexpense) included only practice expenses and not\nresearcher, community, or patient expenses. Inter-\nvention development expenses were excluded, mak-\ning the assumption that once these interventions\nwere developed practices would only need to incur\nexpenses to tailor and implement the existing in-\ntervention to their location. We also elected to not\nassess opportunity costs.\nNext the committee combined formal ex-\npenditure methods with the language and needs of\nprimary care to create a standardized expenditure\ndata collection instrument.16\u00ad19 The instrument\nconsists of one figure (a patient flow diagram), 3\nExcel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) tables\n(\"Start-Up Expenses,\" \"Staff Salaries,\" and \"Oper-\nating Expenses\"), and a field guide. The instrument\nincludes an example of a patient flow diagram with\ninstructions in the field guide about how to create\na customized diagram for an individual interven-\ntion and use it to organize data collection in the 3\ntables. The patient flow diagram is used to record\nthe number of patients that complete each inter-\nvention step. From the diagram, the number of\npatient participants is transferred to the operating\nexpense table to calculate recurrent expenses (ie,\npatient care activities); additionally, information\nabout nonrecurrent expenditures on capital assets\nand overhead expenditures are recorded. Patient\nflow, operating expenses, nonrecurrent expenses,\nand overhead expenses are collected at baseline\n(before starting the intervention) and at 2 steady-\nstate time periods after intervention. By subtracting\neach steady state expense from baseline expenses\nand averaging the differences, the average incre-\nmental intervention expense may be calculated.\nThe field guide defines economic terms, clarifies\nthe steps needed to collect the expenditure data,\nand describes how to categorize expenses for ap-\npropriate incremental expenditure calculations. An\nexample of a completed intervention-specific pa-\ntient flow diagram and operating expense table are\nprovided in Figures 1 and 2. An example of the\ninstrument and a field guide, describing how to use\nthe instrument in detail, are available online.20\nPilot Testing\nThe preliminary instrument was piloted in 6\npractices that had previously implemented the\nsame health behavior change intervention during\nthe first cycle of P4H (a website with patient\nresources).21,22 Initially, one office manager was\nasked to complete the instrument while being\nobserved and timed (phase 1). After refining the\ninstrument based on phase 1 findings, all 6 of the\npractice's office managers were asked to com-\nplete the instrument (phase 2). Their responses\nwere compared with the practices' financial\nrecords for accuracy and they were surveyed\nabout the process; this information was used to\nfinalize the instrument for fielding during the\nsecond cycle of P4H.\nInstrument Fielding and Assessment\nTen PBRNs were funded during the second round\nof P4H. Each PBRN designed and evaluated a\ndifferent health behavior change intervention in a\ntotal of 75 practices across the nation.23 The prac-\ntices included private practices and community\nhealth centers, large (10 physicians) and small\npractices in rural, urban, and suburban locations.\nThe interventions included health information\ntechnology interventions, modified or new staff\nroles, and partnerships with existing community\nFigure 1. Completed patient flow diagram. This is a completed intervention-specific patient flow diagram for one\nof the participating Prescription for Health practices. The expenditure steering committee and the practice-based\nresearch networks created the flow diagram in Microsoft Excel. Each practice-based research network then asked\n3 representative participating practices to complete the diagram. Practices entered the number of patients\ncompleting each intervention step at baseline and during 2, 1-month steady-state periods of the intervention. Data\nin Figure 1 is for one 1-month steady-state period. The main purpose of this diagram was to organize and frame\nthe data collection for baseline and operating expense figures (Figure 2).

With the assistance of\nthe PBRN, each practice determined the specific\ndata sources necessary to complete the expenditure\ninstrument and collected the data. Either the prac-\ntice or the PBRN could enter the data into the\nexpenditure instrument. Throughout data collec-\ntion, the expenditure steering committee was avail-\nable to clarify the instrument and the economic\nmethods for the PBRNs and practices. In addition,\nthe committee reviewed all completed instruments\nwith the PBRNs to ensure accuracy and assist in\nfixing any errors. Data were collected for 1 month\nat baseline before fielding the intervention, during\nthe entire start-up period as practices prepared to\nfield the intervention, and during 2 separate\n1-month intervals during steady states of interven-\ntion delivery. After expenditure data collection\nwere complete, all PBRNs completed a brief survey\nabout the process of collecting expenditure data\nusing the standardized instrument.\nResults\nPilot Testing\nDuring the first phase of pilot testing, one office\nmanager was provided a generic flow diagram and a\ngeneric set of tables that included the entire range\nof potential expenses. The nonspecific flow dia-\ngram and extraneous cells in the comprehensive\ntables created substantial confusion and resulted in\nthe office manager only being able to complete the\ninstrument with detailed guidance. For the second\nphase of pilot testing, the instrument was modified\nto include only intervention-specific steps and ex-\npenses in the flow diagram and tables. Office man-\nagers were able to complete the instrument without\ndirection from the steering committee and re-\nported a mean of 93 minutes needed to assemble\nthe expenditure data and complete the instrument.\nThe expenditure data recorded by the office man-\nFigure 2. Completed operating expense table. This is a completed intervention-specific operating expense table.\nSimilarly, the structure of this table was created by the expenditure steering committee and the practice-based\nresearch networks. Practices then used the flow diagram (Figure 1) to complete the number of patients eligible for\nand completing each intervention activity in section A of this table. Practices used additional data sources to\ncomplete the remaining cells in sections A, B, and C. Data shown in here is for same 1-month steady-state period\nused in Figure 1. As with Figure 1, practices would complete this table for a baseline period and for 2, 1-month\nsteady-state periods. By subtracting expenses for each 1-month steady-state period (1 month shown in this table)\nfrom the baseline expenses (not shown) and averaging the values, the economist could calculate the incremental\nexpenses for each practice's intervention.

All\nPBRNs were asked to review these documents and\nreport any discrepancies and further customization\nthat was necessary. The steering committee assisted\nPBRNS that required changes to their instruments\nor field guides, at times developing several versions\nof these documents until the PBRNs deemed them\naccurately representative of their interventions. An\nexample of a completed patient flow diagram and\nsteady state expenditure table with a description of\nhow the instrument was used is provided in Figures\n1 and 2. Although PBRN input was essential to the\ncreation of the customized instruments, significant\nassistance was required from the steering commit-\ntee to clarify economic terms, create a flow diagram\nand expenditure list that captured all potential ex-\npenses and intervention steps (all networks initially\nneglected some potential expenses and intervention\nsteps), and categorize expenses for appropriate eco-\nnomic analysis (networks had difficulty differenti-\nating recurrent expenses, overhead, and capital as-\nsets).\nOnce the instrument was customized, the\nPBRNs asked the practices to collect the specific\ndata. At this stage, all practices required their\nPBRNs assistance with data collection. PBRNs\nneeded to clarify the economic terms and prompt\npractices to identify all potential expenses, similar\nto the prompting that the PBRNs needed from the\nexpenditure committee. Specific practice expendi-\nture data sources tended to vary based on the in-\ntervention and included office managers, clinicians,\nfinancial staff, financial records, electronic medical\nrecords, personnel activity logs, and direct obser-\nvation (see Table 1). Although all practices were\nable to provide expenditure information, most\nPBRNs provided assistance to record the data in\nthe expenditure data collection instrument and the\neconomist was needed to calculate the overall ex-\npenditures (see Table 1).\nUltimately, all 10 PBRNs were able to field the\nexpenditure instrument and collect expenditure\ndata. One PBRN was able to collect data from only\n2 of the requested 3 practices and one was unable to\ncollect start-up expenses, both because of work\npressures unrelated to the study that these partici-\npating practices were experiencing at the time of\ndata collection (eg, one practice was adopting a new\nelectronic medical record). Overall, start-up and\noperating expenses were successfully collected for\ntively.\nPBRN Survey Responses\nThe majority of PBRNs reported that the time and\neffort required for data collection was acceptable\n(with 1 being \"very acceptable\" and 5 being \"ac-\nTable 1.

The PBRNs consid-\nered that the expertise provided by the expenditure\nsteering committee was a necessary resource (8\nreported it was \"very important\" and 2 reported it\nwas \"important\"). Overall, 90% of the PBRNs re-\nported that they planned to collect expenditure\ndata in the future and that their participation in the\nP4H expenditure study increased the likelihood\nthat they would participate in a future expenditure\nstudy.\nDiscussion\nMore research is necessary to estimate the cost of\nprimary care and its value. The P4H expenditure\nstudy confirmed that it is possible to systematically\nmeasure primary care expenses, and the average\nreported P4H intervention practice expense--$58\nper participant--was substantially higher than cur-\nrent reimbursements.15 Most PBRNs and practices\nwere able to collect credible expenditure data while\ncreating, fielding, and assessing novel health behav-\nior change interventions. The time and effort were\ngenerally considered acceptable and the experience\nappreciably increased their likelihood of collecting\nexpenditure data in the future.\nHowever, both PBRNs and practices had dif-\nficulties with the formal expenditure methodol-\nogy, frequently reverting to simple cost analyses,\ncollecting absolute intervention costs rather than\nincremental expenses, and underestimating or\nneglecting real expenses. Practices frequently\nknew their general costs and revenue, but had\ntrouble attributing specific resources to specific\ninterventions. The nature of primary care makes\nsuch attributions difficult. Intervention expenses\nwere often intermingled with other noninterven-\ntion-related office and clinical activities. Com-\nmonly, staff time for intervention activities was\nbrief, lasting only several minutes, but was often\nrepeated by many staff members many times per\nday. These expenses were not only difficult to\nmeasure, but were often overlooked. However,\ncollectively these expenses represented signifi-\ncant resource requirements for practices.\nPractices and PBRNs both had difficulties as-\nsigning the correct financial category to expen-\nditures. Differentiating whether an expense was a\ndevelopment versus start-up expense or an inter-\nvention delivery versus research study expense\nwas a challenge. The PBRNs had extensive re-\nsearch and data collection experience but had\nminimal experience with collecting expenditure\ndata. The practices knew about their clinical ac-\ntivities and their expenses, but not about system-\natic data collection and expenditure methods.\nHowever, all these challenges were overcome by\ncreating an expenditure guide to define economic\nterms and describe incremental data collection\nmethods, providing a data collection instrument\nto standardize data collection, using the field\nexperience of the PBRNs to coordinate and over-\nsee data collection, and establishing a steering\ncommittee to provide external expertise and sup-\nport.\nThe observed challenges with collecting ex-\npenses in primary care are not unexpected. Sys-\ntematic collection of intervention expenses is not\npart of existing primary care research or practice\nculture. In the current relative-value scale reim-\nbursement model, even if a practice understands\ntheir expenses they have little power to modify\ntheir fees for more appropriate reimbursement.24\nLikewise, although lack of reimbursement is a\nfrequent barrier to the ultimate dissemination of\ninterventions created by primary care research-\ners, researchers are more focused on evaluating\nwhether interventions are effective rather than\nTable 2.

For example, the Fu-\nture of Family Medicine's financial task force re-\nported that group visits, team-based care, and clin-\nical practice guideline software could increase a\n5-physician practice's annual revenue by $5,664 to\nsimilar P4H interventions cost practices $2 to $63\nper patient participant.15\nIn this article, we described experiences of\nPBRNs and practices with collecting expenditure\ndata using expenditure methods. These experiences\nlead us to several suggestions to facilitate the col-\nlection of primary care expenditures:\n1. Funders should ask for and support expendi-\nture data collection as part of the outcomes\nassessment of interventions, similar to what\nthe Robert Wood Johnson Foundation did\n2. PBRN researchers, who have both primary care\npractice and data collection expertise, can\nserve as a resource for collecting expenditures,\nboth in educating practices and catalyzing\nchange through ongoing work.\n3. A standardized data collection instrument cus-\ntomized to specific interventions--such as the\none we used in P4H--can systematize data\ncollection, allowing for the collection of ex-\npenditures that are consistent, valid, and gen-\neralizable.\n4. External economic expertise and oversight is\nnecessary to assist with the collection and\nanalysis of expenditure data.\n5. Payers need to incentivize collection of expen-\nditure data and use this information to ensure\nappropriate practice reimbursement.\nThis article reports on a process and the ex-\nperiences of collecting expenditure data in pri-\nmary care practices for health behavior change\ninterventions. Fully, 30 practices from 10 PBRNs\nfrom across the nation participated in the study,\nproviding robust and generalizable findings\nabout the experience. An expenditure data col-\nlection instrument was used to standardize data\ncollection, which can serve as the groundwork for\nthe development of future expenditure data col-\nlection instruments. In addition, the instrument\ncould be used to collect additional expenses that\nwe chose not to collect (eg, intervention devel-\nopment, opportunity costs, etc) or expense per-\nspectives that we did not consider (eg, patient,\ncommunity programs, payer, etc).\nAlthough the reported findings have relevance\nto intervention dissemination and practice rede-\nsign, our study does have several important limita-\ntions. We conducted a prospective observational\nstudy with no comparison group. The PBRNs se-\nlected representative practices for participation and\nprobably selected practices that they presumed\nwould be successful with expenditure data collec-\ntion. Despite the participation of such practices and\nthe creation of the expenditure data collection in-\nstrument, we found that both practices and PBRNs\nhad difficulties with using expenditure methods.\nAlthough this seems like a limitation, meaning that\nthe average primary care practice could not take\nour instrument and field it in practice without as-\nsistance, this is a key finding that highlights the\nneed for enhanced knowledge and expertise in pri-\nmary care to generate expenditure data in the fu-\nture.\nConclusion\nEconomic and financial research can add value in\nprimary care and will be a necessary component of\nfuture work involving comparative effectiveness re-\nsearch, translation of evidence, and creation of\nmedical homes. Although more work is necessary\nto develop and refine data collection tools and pri-\nmary care practices and researchers need training\nand experience with systematically collecting ex-\npenses, the P4H experience suggests that collecting\nexpenditures is feasible.\nThe authors would like to thank the individuals who assisted\nwith the development and assessment of our expenditure instru-\nment (Doug Fernald, MA; Sue Flocke, PhD; Jodi Holtrop, PhD;\nAbhi Kole; Kurt Stange, MD, PhD; Tom Summerfelt, PhD;\nand Alfred Tallia, MD, MPH) as well as the innovating PBRNs\nand their participating practices, without whom this study would\nnot have possible.\nReferences\n1.
