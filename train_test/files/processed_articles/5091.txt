    "abstract": "Abstract\nBig Data research is currently split on whether and to what extent Twitter can be characterized as an informational or\nsocial network. We contribute to this line of inquiry through an investigation of digital humanities (DH) scholars' uses\nand gratifications of Twitter. We conducted a thematic analysis of 25 semi-structured interview transcripts to learn about\nthese scholars' professional use of Twitter. Our findings show that Twitter is considered a critical tool for informal\ncommunication within DH invisible colleges, functioning at varying levels as both an information network (learning to\n`Twitter' and maintaining awareness) and a social network (imagining audiences and engaging other digital humanists). We\nfind that Twitter follow relationships reflect common academic interests and are closely tied to scholars' pre-existing\nsocial ties and conference or event co-attendance. The concept of the invisible college continues to be relevant but\nrequires revisiting. The invisible college formed on Twitter is messy, consisting of overlapping social contexts (profes-\nsional, personal and public), scholars with different habits of engagement, and both formal and informal ties.\nOur research illustrates the value of using multiple methods to explore the complex questions arising from Big Data\nstudies and points toward future research that could implement Big Data techniques on a small scale, focusing on sub-\ntopics or emerging fields, to expose the nature of scholars' invisible colleges made visible on Twitter.\n",

Given the popular-\nity of Twitter among scholars in various disciplines\n(Holmberg and Thelwall, 2014; Nicholas and\nRowlands, 2011) and the importance of scholarly com-\nmunication to individual scholars and to communities of\nresearchers (Gruzd et al., 2011; Holmberg and Thelwall,\n2014), it is critical to understand how and why Twitter is\nbeing used and its implications in relation to scholar-\nship. Because of the dynamic nature of social media\n(see Hogan and Quan-Haase, 2010), research also\nneeds to consider that social media are not only used\ndifferently across platforms (Archambault and Grudin,\nciplines (Holmberg and Thelwall, 2014). Much of the\nliterature has tended to look at higher education\nlars as general groupings (Nicholas and Rowlands,\n2011), without adequately investigating the social ties\nthat connect scholars and make their interactions\nsocially relevant. For example, digital humanities\n(DH) and cognitive science scholars tend to use\nTwitter more for conversation than those in disciplines\nsuch as biochemistry and economics (Holmberg and\nThelwall, 2014). Current discussions on social media\nuse in academia would thus benefit from studies that\ninvestigate the adoption and usage of specific platforms\nby subgroups of researchers.\nThe use of Twitter is still relatively new, and thus\nresearchers are only beginning to grasp Twitter's\n``antecedents and consequences'' (Aladwani, 2015:\n15). One central debate in the literature, informed in\npart by Big Data research (Kwak et al., 2010; Myers\net al., 2014), has emerged around how Twitter\nexchanges provide informational or social benefits to\nusers. Kwak et al. (2010) suggest that Twitter is best\ndescribed as an information network rather than a\nsocial network. More recent work examining the topo-\nlogical features of networks found evidence that sug-\ngests Twitter acts as both an information and social\nnetwork (Myers et al., 2014). To discern the informa-\ntional and social gratifications obtained from Twitter\nnetworks, it is vital to study Twitter activity by users\nwho have shared interests and are bound by informal\nties. The aim of this paper is to inform and expand\nfindings based on Big Data analyses about Twitter's\ninformational and social gratifications.\nOur research contributes to the growing body of lit-\nerature on scholars' use of social media by examining a\nsingle group of scholars, those in the DH community\nwho use ``computational tools to do the work of the\nOur findings inform researchers, educators and policy\nmakers who strive to understand the use and value of\nsocial media in the context of scholarship (e.g. Gruzd\nstudy examines two research questions:\na. How are DH scholars using Twitter in the context\nof their scholarly practice?\nb. What informational and social gratifications do DH\nscholars obtain from their usage of Twitter?\nOur two research questions emerge from prior\nresearch in the area of Big Data analytics. We specific-\nally examine whether, in the context of DH, Twitter's\nuses and gratifications are more informational or social\nin nature. Big Data analytics are particularly well-\nsuited for identifying the topological features of a net-\nwork, but are myopic to the social context in which\ninteractions take place. The contribution of this paper\nis to demonstrate how a small scale study of Twitter\nuses and gratifications can inform and expand a debate\nunfolding in Big Data analytics. Thereby, this paper\nsheds light on the debate by taking a look at a small\nslice of the activity on Twitter from the perspective of\nDH scholars.\nBackground\nBig Data and Twitter use\nThough criticized for its biases and assumptions,\nBig Data informs our understanding of social phenom-\nena and, at the same time, creates ``a radical shift in how\nwe think about research'' (Boyd and Crawford, 2012:\n665). Even though the definition of Big Data is conten-\ntious and evolving, the term is generally used to describe\nlarge and complex data sets, including content generated\non social media sites (Big Data & Society, 2014).\nBig Data studies have compared a range of topological\nfeatures of Twitter networks; a study by Kwak et al.\n(2010) being ``the first to look at the entire\nTwittersphere'' (p. 599) for the purpose of investigating\nuser participation in trending topics, reciprocity and\nhomophily. Kwak et al.'s study demonstrates how the\nuse of Big Data techniques can provide new insights\ninto large-scale social processes. A key finding was that\nthe majority of ties on Twitter were one-way rather than\nreciprocal. Based on their study, the authors proposed\nthat Twitter's primary use is as a source of information\nand platform for information exchange rather than\nsocial networking. In another study, Myers et al. (2014)\nfound that while some of their results pointed to Twitter\n2 Big Data & Society\nas a social network, others were more consistent with\nTwitter as an information network, thus partially corro-\nborating Kwak et al.'s (2010) findings, but ultimately\nconcluding Twitter represents more of a hybrid network.\nMyers et al. (2014) further hypothesized that Twitter\nstarts off as an information network but over time\nevolves into a social network as a user becomes more\nselective of whom to follow: ``The user typically discovers\na community with which to engage \u00ad whether it be based\non real-world social ties, common interests, or other fac-\ntors \u00ad and Twitter starts behaving more like a social net-\nBig Data studies (e.g. Kwak et al., 2010; Myers et al.,\n2014) provide useful generalizations about patterns in\nhuman behaviour on Twitter. However, subsets of\nTwitter users may not exhibit the same patterns and\nthese nuances may be lost in analyses of large data\nsets. Holmberg and Thelwall (2014) selected researchers\nfrom 10 different disciplines, including DH, biochemis-\ntry and economics, based on their productivity and\npresence on Twitter. Based on an analysis of 200 ran-\ndomly selected tweets from these researchers, they\nfound significant differences among disciplines in\nterms of how links were shared, the number of conver-\nsational tweets, retweets and tweets for the purpose of\nscholarly communication. Understanding the role of\nsocial context in how different social groups make use\nof Twitter and the unique gratifications each group\ngains from their engagement will help researchers inter-\npret the `big picture' findings drawn from Big Data\nanalytics.\nThe DH community\nDH is an interdisciplinary, evolving field of study with\nroots in the humanities computing centres of the 1970s\nhave allowed for a much larger integration of technol-\nogy into the humanities, making possible the collection,\nanalysis and interpretation of Big Data that can span\nseveral centuries, time periods and data sources. The\ncentral tenet of DH is the utilization of computing\nresources as a means to aid scholarship, teaching and\ntheorizing around humanities subjects (e.g. language,\nliterature, history, art and philosophy) and there is a\ngrowing, international network of scholars who iden-\ntify themselves as members of the DH community\nDH and social media\nDefinitions of social media abound and tend to\ninclude a wide range of tools such as microblogging,\nsocial networking sites and video sharing websites\n(Hogan and Quan-Haase, 2010). What characterizes\nsocial media engagement is that it is global in nature,\nlinks loosely connected networks, facilitates the\nsharing of ideas and content in an interactive\nmanner and allows for high levels of engagement\nwith people and content (McCay-Peet and Quan-\nHaase, forthcoming).\nNot all scholars have adopted social media, but for\nmany it has become an integral component of their\nscholarly practice (Quan-Haase, 2012). Social media\nreduce the barriers of time and location to scholarly\ncommunication; scholars can tweet messages to their\nfollowers and have answers to questions in real time;\nthey can communicate with a co-worker who is away at\na conference; or they can follow activities of a confer-\nence they were unable to attend in person from afar\nscholars have been described as early adopters and avid\nusers of social media (Kirschenbaum, 2010; Ross et al.,\n2011) and many DH scholars embed Twitter in their\npractice to amplify scholarly communication (Howard,\n``iterative scholarship, mobilized collaborations, and\nnetworks of research'' (n.p.), which is illustrated\nthrough DH scholars' use of social media to communi-\ncate with their colleagues and share research results\nwith a broad audience (Terras, 2012). Twitter, for\nexample, plays a large role during DH events, work-\nshops, THATCamps and conferences as a platform for\nback channelling (Ross et al., 2011). Through a content\nanalysis of tweets by scholars from 10 disciplines,\nHolmberg and Thelwall (2014) found that DH scholars\ntend to engage in more conversations (@username),\nshare fewer links in their tweets and use Twitter for\nscholarly communication more than scholars in some\nother disciplines. Based on a sample of 200 DH scholar\ntweets, the study also found that the 10 most fre-\nquently-used words in tweets by DH scholars included:\n``need,'' ``thanks'' and ``thinking,'' as well as ``digital''\nand ``humanities,'' which suggests that DH scholars are\nsharing ideas and information related to DH in an\ninteractive manner.\nIn summary, scattered throughout the literature are\nindications that Twitter is an important tool for DH\nscholars. What is needed is a more holistic understand-\ning of DH scholars' motivations behind Twitter use\n(e.g. informational versus social), how they are using\nTwitter as a platform for scholarly communication,\nhow they are navigating the use of Twitter in the con-\ntext of their professional work, and to what effect.\nMethodology\nThis study employed semi-structured interviews to col-\nlect data from 25 DH scholars about their use of digital\ntools and social media for supporting their scholarly\nQuan-Haase et al. 3\nwork. Transcripts were analysed using the thematic\nanalysis technique and the uses and gratifications\nframework informed the coding process.\nParticipants\nBecause debate surrounds what DH entails as well as\nthe creation of arbitrary boundaries within the huma-\nnities, participant sampling was grounded in practical\ncriteria that would allow us to recruit widely and be\ninclusive. We were also concerned about recruiting\nindividuals with various DH experiences (e.g. faculty,\ngraduate students, and librarians). For this purpose, we\nrecruited at the international DH annual conference\n(DH 2013), which took place in Lincoln, Nebraska,\ntwo DH centres in the United Kingdom and Ireland\nively. Participants were recruited through four strate-\ngies: a) in person, b) Twitter, c) email prior to site visits\nand d) a booth set up at the DH 2013 conference.\nParticipants (N \u00bc 25) comprised an international set\nof scholars engaging in DH-related scholarship and\nincluded 14 females and 11 males. Eleven professors,\nsix PhD students, three managers, two librarians, two\npublic historians and a retired professor participated.\nThe majority had attained a graduate degree: 11 had a\nPhD and 11 had a MA degree, and three participants\nhad attained an undergraduate degree. Participants'\nfields of study varied and reflected the diversity existent\nwithin DH scholarship: classics, literature, English, his-\ntory, art history, information science, computer science,\nengineering, political communication and business.\nParticipants were from the US, Canada, Germany,\nEngland, Ireland and Australia.\nProcedure\nEach in-person, 45\u00ad60 min session followed the same\nprocedure, beginning with an introduction to the\nstudy and consent. The interviews were audio-recorded\nfor later transcription. Interviews were semi-structured\nto allow the interviewer the flexibility to clarify partici-\npant responses, probe for more detail and follow-up on\nunexpected topics (Berg, 2007). The interview was part\nof a broader study on the information behaviours of\ndigital humanists. The present analysis is limited to the\nsections on Twitter and general social media use (see\nAppendix A).\nThe uses and gratifications framework\nThe uses and gratifications approach was selected as a\nframework for analysis. Uses and gratifications is\n``a psychological perspective that examines how\nindividuals use mass media, on the assumption that\nindividuals select media and content to fulfill felt\nneeds or wants'' (Papacharissi and Mendelson, 2011)\nand is an ideal method for the study of social media\nin the context of everyday life (Quan-Haase and\nYoung, 2010). The uses and gratifications approach\nhas been used to identify predictors of time spent on\nsocial media such as 1) relaxing entertainment, 2)\nexpressive information sharing and 3) social interaction\n(Smock et al., 2011). In a similar vein, the uses and\ngratifications approach was used to examine the per-\nceived characteristics of Twitter as a motivating factor\nfor its continued use (Coursaris et al., 2013). The\napproach is also useful for making cross-platform com-\nparisons. A comparison of the uses and gratifications of\nFacebook and instant messaging revealed several rea-\nsons why young people integrate multiple digital tech-\nnologies into their daily lives (Quan-Haase and Young,\n2010). While a significant portion of prior research on\nsocial media has been grounded in the uses and gratifi-\ncations approach, we know of no prior study that has\napplied the uses and gratifications approach in the con-\ntext of scholars' use of Twitter.\nData analysis\nWe performed thematic analysis of the transcripts\n(Braun and Clarke, 2006), involving inductive and\ndeductive coding. Thematic analysis allowed the\nresearchers to use the uses and gratifications frame-\nwork to help guide the analysis and draw on prior\nresearch to identify pre-existing themes while at the\nsame time providing the flexibility to develop new\nthemes. Thematic analysis is an iterative process that\ninvolves familiarization with the data (via transcrip-\ntion, reading of transcripts), generation of initial\ncodes, a search for themes, review of themes and the\nnaming and definition of themes. Data analysis was\nguided by the two research questions and thus carefully\nexamined participant references to the uses and gratifi-\ncations of Twitter. To help ensure rigour in the data\nanalysis process, multiple coding was used (Barbour,\n2001). Multiple coding involved the analysis of the\ntranscripts by the second and third authors. The\nauthors completed the analysis separately while dis-\ncussing codes together after every five or so transcripts\nto help check for agreement and, more importantly, to\ndiscuss insights and alternative interpretations. Of the\n25 transcripts, 15 were coded using this method. A fur-\nther 10 transcripts were analysed using the codes and\nno further major themes were identified, thus reaching\nsaturation. Descriptive statistics drawn from the\nTwitter use set of questions (e.g. whether or not\nTwitter is used to connect with people within the DH\ncommunity) were relied upon to complement and\n4 Big Data & Society\ncorroborate the themes identified in this research.\nFollowing recommendations outlined in Braun and\nClarke (2006), writing-up the results section provided\na final opportunity for analysis, as representative\nquotes from participants were extracted from the tran-\nscripts to highlight key findings.\nFindings\nSocial media and Twitter use\nParticipants reported varying levels of use of social\nmedia. All 25 participants maintained at least one\nsocial media account (e.g. Twitter, Facebook,\nAcademia.edu), but many maintained several. All but\none participant had a Twitter account and one partici-\npant had a Twitter account but was not currently using\nit. When asked about their Twitter networks, 19 par-\nticipants recalled their number of followers, which\nrecalled the number of people they followed, which\n12 of these 16 participants reported following more\nthan 150. One hundred and fifty is generally considered\nthe maximum number of stable social relationships that\ncan be maintained at one time (Dunbar, 1992, as cited\nin Myers et al., 2014). This suggests that DH Twitter\nties are not entirely social in nature for the majority of\nDH scholars. While we did not collect data on the reci-\nprocity of the ties, 10 reported following more people\nor organizations than they were followed by, five fol-\nlowed fewer people or organizations than they were\nfollowed by, and one had an equal number of followers\nand follows.\nSeveral participants reported their time investment\nin Twitter in relative time spent (e.g. ``not a lot,''\n``probably too much''), others spoke of the quality\nof their investment (e.g. ``interstitial,'' ``constant,''\n``a lot, but uneven'') and yet others reported on the\ncontext of usage (e.g. ``only when not busy with\nwork'' or ``not until recently at the conference'').\nSeven participants reported tweeting on a daily\nbasis, five reported tweeting at least once per week,\nwhile three reported that it varies and one reported\nrarely tweeting. In other words, there was no single\npattern of Twitter usage among participants; they\nadapted the technology to their own social and pro-\nfessional needs.\nTwitter's informational uses and gratifications\nIn order to share information with or solicit informa-\ntion or feedback from those in their Twitter networks,\nDH scholars develop skills to do so effectively\n(Learning to Twitter). Likewise, to reap the benefits\nof a rich information network, DH scholars use\nTwitter to keep up with news and information in the\nDH community (Maintaining awareness).\nLearning to Twitter. In a recent article on `Twitteracy',\nGreenhow and Gleason (2012) described the multimod-\nality of microblogging: images, links, emoticons and\nstandardized language comprise the 140-character\ntweets users compose. The authors also noted that\nthere are a number of conventions (e.g. hashtags and\nretweets) that users need to know to effectively partici-\npate on Twitter. Our findings similarly suggest that\nlearning how to engage in a multimodal digital envir-\nonment is central to participants. P19 noted the import-\nance of selecting the ``right'' hashtag for a tweet to\nmaximize its reach. We found that simply learning to\nwrite in the allocated 140-character limit was critical for\nmeaningful engagement.\nThe 140-character limit was seen as beneficial to\nsome, forcing them to think through their ideas more\nclearly and to express themselves succinctly, but the\ncharacter limit was too restrictive for others. In most\ncases, our participants weighed both sides of this ``new\nliterary practice'' (Greenhow and Gleason, 2012): they\nrecognized the challenges, but were still willing to\nengage. Participants reported that the effort of\n``crafting tweets'' (P6) was worth it because they were\nlearning a new digital literacy. Several participants\nreferred to writing posts as a skill that could be\ntaught and improved through experience.\nGruzd et al. (2011) refer to `twitterspeak' as the lin-\nguistic conventions utilized to tweet. Participants in the\npresent study perceived twitterspeak as a new means of\ncommunicating that encouraged them to think through\ntheir tweets.\nI think there is a literacy here because it forces you to\nthink about being economical with your mode of\nexpression. What is the word that matters most?\nWhat happens if I move this? Is that going to, you\nknow, impact it in important ways? You can get the\nsense across, but do you get the nuance? [. . .] What are\nyou losing? (P6)\nThe word limit was also perceived as an opportunity to\n`boil down' ideas to their essence. Eleven participants\nindicated that they use Twitter to help them clarify\nideas, while two indicated that they use it for this pur-\npose `sometimes' or `somewhat'. The need to concisely\nexpress complex ideas seemed a welcome challenge to\nsome participants, one that allowed them to clarify\ntheir thinking and reflect upon their ideas. This suggests\nthat DH users of Twitter optimize the informational\nvalue of the platform and realize its potential for the\nexchange of information.\nQuan-Haase et al. 5\nSome participants stressed the shortcomings of the\nmedium by stating how it is difficult to write within the\n140-character format, how it stifles conversation and\nhow it leads to heavy reliance on links for additional\ninformation. In that regard, they saw their tweets inter-\nconnected with larger discourses occurring on blogs,\narticles and other web content. Twelve participants\ndescribed the constraints imposed by the 140-character\nlimit in expressing complex ideas and conveying large\namounts of information.\nI mean obviously a conversation is better face-to-face.\nSometimes it's hard for me to say what I want to say in\n140-character snippets. Especially if there are a lot to\nsay [sic]. (P3)\nAlthough several participants noted that there was an\ninteractive, conversational element to being on Twitter,\nseveral agreed with P3 that conversations were best left\nfor other media. This highlights the tensions in relying\non Twitter for the purpose of sustaining an imagined\ncommunity: Twitter facilitates the easy and convenient\nsharing of information, but it is also important for the\nmessages to make sense. Hence, to be a part of this\nimagined community, members must first share a\ncommon language (Anderson, 1983) and set of\nconventions.\nIn sum, while the majority of our participants have\nadopted Twitter, they continue to figure out how it best\nfits into their scholarly practice. They are willing to\nfurther push themselves to understand the intricacies\nof the medium and to learn how to engage with\nothers in creative and meaningful ways that will allow\nthem to take advantage of Twitter as an information\nnetwork.\nMaintaining awareness. Prior research (Coursaris et al.,\nlines the importance of Twitter for helping people main-\ntain awareness of news and information, a dominant\ntheme identified in our data set as well. Many partici-\npants noted the importance of maintaining awareness\nof DH-related research, conferences and projects via\nTwitter. One participant asserted Twitter was unri-\nvalled in this respect, and this confirms prior research\nthat stresses the centrality of Twitter as an information\nI would say that Twitter is probably the single most\nimportant place for me to keep up with new websites,\nnew projects. (P1)\nBut more than the passive type of information behav-\niour often described in the literature (Wilson, 1999) and\nthat the concept of `maintaining awareness' perhaps\nsuggests, one participant (P5) observed how useful\nTwitter was for quickly getting up to speed on a par-\nticular topic by employing a range of purposeful infor-\nmation tactics.\nWhen I first started on the [DH Project], I needed\nto know more, I needed to `skill up' very quickly.\nSo I actively followed people that I thought might be\nhelpful for extending my knowledge in that area.\nTwitter was more than just background noise. It pre-\nsented itself as an information space that could be\nmined for purposeful information seeking. The DH\ninformation that could be obtained from Twitter\nclearly motivated participants' continued use of the\nsite, and as new information needs emerged partici-\npants utilized Twitter strategically to fill their know-\nledge gaps.\nThree further interrelated sub-themes of maintaining\nawareness were identified: time, noise and serendipity.\nThese three sub-themes point to motivations for con-\ntinued Twitter use as well as potential reasons for\navoiding Twitter, at least at times (Makri et al., 2014).\nMaintaining awareness requires an investment of\ntime, and for some participants it was difficult to find\nthe time during a regular workday to check their\naccounts and thus reported using Twitter primarily\nduring conferences or events (see Engagement section).\nOthers reported how easy it was to maintain awareness\nof DH information by periodically checking their\nTwitter timelines. One participant noted how easy it\nwas to just ``slot it in'' (P25), and another mentioned\nusing ``it in those in-between moments when I am wait-\ning for things or walking down the hall on my way\nbetween meetings'' (P23). The way some participants\ndescribed how Twitter helped them maintain awareness\nhad a ubiquitous quality to it.\nWell for me, I have two screens. One of my screens is\npurely devoted to Twitter. It is on all talk, all the time.\n[. . .] I use it every single day [. . .] all day. People say\nthat's incredibly difficult and people don't really enjoy\nhaving it there constantly, but I find it a brilliant help\n[. . .] not only in procrastination, but in hooking into\nthings that I don't necessarily know about. (P21)\nP21's observations about her own use of Twitter\ntogether with her perception of how others would\nreact to having Twitter in the background at all times\nillustrate two sides of the same coin. The negative side\nis the distraction resulting from all the noise \u00ad the mas-\nsive amounts of diverse but not always interesting or\nuseful information that has a tendency to overload\nusers' timelines. This dissuaded some of our partici-\npants from being continuously connected to Twitter.\n6 Big Data & Society\nOne participant noted that what he did not like about\nTwitter was the inconsistent quality of content on his\ntimeline, which was often filled with uninteresting,\nirrelevant information.\nRidiculously long list, with ridiculously useless infor-\nmation and that's the danger of combining the personal\naccount with the professional. [. . .] Research ones are\nmuch more focused but I find that people just tweet all\nthe time and sometimes I don't need to read that. (P7)\nNoise also relates to the theme of the `imagined audi-\nence' (Marwick and Boyd, 2010) explored in the section\nto follow. People may imagine their audience and\nspeculate what posts people in their network would\nfind interesting, but it is difficult to optimize informa-\ntion for a diverse network. There is an inevitable dis-\nconnect, at least periodically, between the imagined\naudience and the actual audience.\nFinally, the positive side of this diverse and dynamic\ndigital environment is the serendipitous, unexpected\nexperiences it affords. Ten participants reported that\nthey use Twitter for making random and important\nconnections. Two participants specifically referred to\nthe serendipitous quality of their experiences. P5\nreported dealing with a problematic aspect of her\nresearch and `stumbling upon' a tweet directly related\nto the problem.\nIn summary, Twitter is an important, however\nimperfect, information network to our participants.\nInformal communication via Twitter \u00ad at times useful\nand others useless \u00ad helps participants maintain aware-\nness of developments in the field of DH. Next we dis-\ncuss how some of our participants not only use Twitter\nas a source of information, but as a social network to\nengage with fellow DH scholars.\nTwitter's social uses and gratifications\nComplementing the uses and gratifications of Twitter\nfor DH scholars as a critical yet informal, information\nnetwork was the use of Twitter as a social network.\nParticipants were keenly aware that others were reading\ntheir tweets (Imagined Audiences) and acted accord-\ningly. Moreover, many participants also recognized\nthe value of using Twitter's affordances to engage on\na personal level with their social network (Engaging\nother Digital Humanists).\nImagining audiences\nParticipants' adoption and continued use of Twitter\nappear motivated by the flexibility Twitter affords for\ncreating multiple profiles to reflect different aspects of a\nscholar's life. An important role played by Twitter was\nto help participants compartmentalize their various\nidentities, social roles and social networks through the\ncreation of multiple accounts, which could cater to dif-\nferent audiences. The concept of the `imagined audi-\nence' was coined to describe the difficulties inherent in\npredicting who will read a specific tweet and thus deter-\nmining who comprises one's audience (Marwick and\nBoyd, 2010). For Marwick and Boyd, ``[t]his audience\nis often imagined and constructed by an individual in\norder to present themselves appropriately, based on\ntechnological affordances and immediate social con-\ntext'' (p. 115). One participant reported having different\ngoals, vocabulary and subject matter to present to each\nof the audiences of his two Twitter accounts. He con-\nsciously crafted tweets (see Learning to Twitter section)\nand decided what to retweet based on who he imagined\nwould read these.\nI have two Twitter accounts. So I have myself as myself\n[@myself]. But then I also just decided when I became\nassociate dean, I decided to create a dean account\n[@deanTwitter] account. [. . .] I wanted a more official\nvoice, so on my [@myself] [. . .], I blur the boundary\nbetween my personal and professional identity. (P6)\nThough it is difficult to deduce from the findings of this\nstudy whether single or multiple Twitter accounts are\nthe norm among DH scholars, even those who main-\ntained a single account were aware of who their poten-\ntial audience could be. P24's maintenance of a single\naccount appeared to be for both a professional and\npersonal audience.\nI kind of `flag-up' whenever I see cool things by/about\ncomputing and be like `oh that's the stuff I retweet most\nof all,' so [. . .] if anyone is following me that doesn't\nknow much about digital humanities, they might get a\nflavour for it. (P24)\nP24 appears to reconcile posting information that may\nnot be relevant to her entire imagined audience with the\nbelief that those in her personal network, who most\nlikely are unfamiliar with DH, may find it interesting\nto learn more about it. This notion of posting informa-\ntion deemed relevant by an imagined audience is sup-\nported by our findings: most of our participants\nreported finding information useful to their research\n(n \u00bc 20) or information they were otherwise unaware\nof (n \u00bc 23). The informational benefits of Twitter are\nclosely linked to the crafting of an ``imagined audience''\nthat shares common interests and has overlapping\nprofessional and social roles.\nImagined audiences are an important part of the\ndevelopment of a DH scholar's voice on Twitter, but\nthe imagined audience changes over time as users get a\nQuan-Haase et al. 7\nsense of who is reading their tweets and how the audi-\nence responds to them. By taking notice of what con-\ntent is retweeted or favourited or sparks conversation,\nusers gain a better sense of who their audience is and\ncan adapt the content of their tweets accordingly.\nGaining a sense of one's audience over time was evident\nwhen P5 spoke of the different results obtained from\ncrowdsourcing using Facebook versus Twitter:\nI might throw a question out to both Twitter and\nFacebook and you will often get very different answers\nin those two communities. And so in that sense it can\nbe quite complementary. But they are also therefore\nquite separate because they are actually producing dif-\nferent things. (P5)\nIn this sense, imagined audiences can become more vis-\nible and tangible over time as a result of feedback\nobtained through interaction and engagement.\nEngaging other digital humanists\nFollowing or participating in a Twitter conversation\nrelated to a conference is termed backchannel and is\na common practice among academics (Knight and\ndone by following a hashtag related to the event\n(e.g. #THATCamp), and Ross et al. (2011) noted\nthat it is a central motivation for DH scholars to\nuse Twitter. Backchannel during conferences among\nthe DH community was a central sub-theme that\naddressed the gratifications obtained from engaging\nwith others on Twitter. In the interviews that took\nplace during the DH 2013 conference, participants\nnoted the use of social media throughout the event,\neven going as far as adopting separate social media\nmanagement tools, such as Tweetdeck or HootSuite,\nto be able to follow multiple, simultaneous Twitter\nconversations.\nI use it mainly at conferences, so I will break out the\nTweetDeck for the conferences, and then the rest of\nmy time I just check in on my phone maybe once a\nBackchannel also allows those individuals who are not\nphysically present at the event to follow the conversa-\ntion and engage at a distance. Our research supports\nthese findings, as conferences were one of the main\ntimes that our participants indicated relying on\nTwitter for engagement, and P14, for example, had\ndecided to join Twitter precisely to participate in\nthese online discussions. Reinhardt et al. (2009) found\nthat Twitter was used at conferences mainly for sharing\nresources and connecting with others, and also for\nfollowing parallel sessions. Our work supports this as\nAt the conferences they always exchange a URL or\nsomething. Yeah, that is really useful.\nCommunication and resource sharing via Twitter are\nforms of engagement that, for our participants, con-\ntinue to be important beyond the use around a specific\nevent. Twenty participants reported using Twitter for\nconnecting with other DH scholars on a regular basis.\nIt's like the de facto [. . .] I don't know many people in\nDH that aren't on Twitter. (P3)\nAs far as uses for Twitter within this community, all 23\nof those participants who reported using Twitter regu-\nlarly claimed to use it for sharing other's research,\nwhich is readily understood given the ease of the one-\nclick ``retweet'' button. Eighteen participants chose to\nengage with their audience by using Twitter to dissem-\ninate their own research, a practice that correlates with\nincreased readership (Terras, 2012). More informal\nexchanges also appear facilitated by Twitter. As previ-\nously mentioned, Twitter was used by DH scholars to\nseek input and advice. One participant (P19) com-\nmented on the usefulness of relying on hashtags to\ngain the attention of specific communities active on\nTwitter such as #twitterstorians.\nTwitter use served to expand participants' social net-\nworks by meeting new DH scholars and gaining famil-\niarity with their research interests. Seventeen of the 23\nparticipants who use Twitter claimed they had met new\npeople on Twitter, with P23 even claiming:\nThere are some people who I would count as my friends\nthat I've never met in real life.\nWhat is it about Twitter that promotes sharing\nresearch, asking questions and delving into conversa-\ntions with strangers? Perhaps, as Marwick and Boyd\n(2010) note, it is the shift from a broadcast audience,\na ``faceless mass,'' to a networked audience, which is\n``unidentified but contains familiar faces; it is both\npotentially public and personal'' (p. 129).\nWhen DH scholars engage with one another on\nTwitter, they are able to acquire more information\nabout a specific user by looking at their website or\nblog (usually linked to in their Twitter profile), examin-\ning other conversations they have had, and finding\nimages or pictures they have posted. This contextual-\nization moves the audience from one that is wholly\n`imagined' to one that is identifiable and easier to con-\nnect with. Also central to understanding the social\ngratifications of Twitter is the social context in which\n8 Big Data & Society\nscholars interact: DH scholars share similar interests,\nare part of overlapping networks, use a common lan-\nguage, and have shared goals. This social context allows\nfor the development of a loosely connected social net-\nwork that integrates both strong and weak ties.\nDiscussion and future work\nOur first research question examined how DH scholars\nuse Twitter. Twitter was often part of a broader `social\nmedia toolbox' that includes other social media sites\nsuch as Academia.edu (Quan-Haase and Young,\n2010). Twitter use varied in the study population:\nsome scholars did not use it a lot, while others felt\nthat they used it too much. DH scholars reported\ngreat variability in use: for some use was interstitial,\nwhile others said it was a daily activity, and yet\nothers said that they used it a lot, but in an uneven\nmanner. Our findings show that sheer numbers\ncannot reflect how DH scholars engage on Twitter;\nscholars' thoughts on their use of Twitter were always\nin relation to how Twitter fits with their current per-\nsonal and work context. Future research could develop\na typology of DH Twitter users, which could serve to\nmake comparisons across disciplinary fields.\nThe second research question investigated what\ninformational and social gratifications DH scholars\nobtained from Twitter. As Myers et al. (2014) suggest,\nTwitter is a hybrid network, exhibiting markers indica-\ntive of both an informational and social network. We\nfound that the uses and gratifications framework was a\nfruitful approach for shedding light on this debate. The\ngratifications obtained range from the more informa-\ntional gratifications of digital literacy and staying\nup-to-date on what is happening in DH to the more\nsocial gratifications of finding a voice and becoming\nan active member of the DH community, corroborating\nand expanding on Myers et al.'s (2014) original work.\nLearning to Twitter was perceived by DH scholars\nas a form of digital literacy on which many of them\nthrived. Often seeing the need to craft tweets as a chal-\nlenge, their ability to communicate via this platform\nand make their posts clear to others meant they were\nable to relay information and ideas and get their main\npoints across. As DH has been shown to be one of the\ndisciplines that relies on Twitter most (Holmberg and\nThelwall, 2014), the need to gain this digital literacy\nskill is critical for being a member of the community.\nAlso of importance is the need to be able to read and\ninterpret tweets in order to maintain awareness about\nthe intricacies of DH. Participants noted that Twitter\nwas the first place they went to when wanting to learn\nmore about DH. Having this ever-changing, constant\nfeed of updates about their DH colleagues, teaching\nand research was one of the main informational\ngratifications these scholars obtained from using\nTwitter. However, maintaining awareness inevitably\nleads to exposure to the noise of all of the information\nthose in a person's network deem interesting to share\nwith their `imagined audience.' Should we develop\nmore sophisticated tools for filtering the noise, to\nnarrow the gap between the imagined and real audi-\nence? Perhaps filtering tweets so that only those\ntweets directly related to a scholar's research interests\nappear in the scholar's Twitter feed. Or is the noise a\ndouble-sided coin, both a strength and a weakness of\nthe social media platform? While too much noise can be\nbad, noise is also a sign of a dynamic, information-rich\nenvironment (Makri et al., 2014). Our findings suggest\nnoise has the potential to facilitate serendipitous\nexperiences.\nStriving to communicate more effectively on Twitter\nalso points to ways in which DH scholars are trying to\nenhance the social part of the information/social net-\nwork equation. There is incentive for DH scholars to\njoin Twitter, evidenced from its current widespread\nadoption.\nWhat makes communication on Twitter challenging\nfor many of our DH scholars is that it is not only\ngeared toward exchanging information effectively, but\nalso toward engaging in deeper conversations, reaching\nout to others, providing and giving feedback, and\nacknowledging support from followers. Twitter for\nmany DH scholars is a conversation, one that takes\nplace through a single tweet or a series of interactive\ntweets, and in relation to other discourses online and\noffline, both inside and outside their disciplines.\nConversations, retweets and follows on Twitter all\nhelp DH scholars to feel they are part of the commu-\nnity, which keeps its strength through digital media.\nFuture research could examine whether Twitter gener-\nates new collaborations and innovative research out-\ncomes, key ingredients for a striving invisible college.\nTwitter adds to other means of interaction, enhancing\nthrough digital connection ties that are formed in other\nsocial spheres.\nConclusion\nWelles (2014) made the case for examining subsets of\nBig Data sets. She argued that while Big Data enables\nthe examination of human behaviour at unprecedented\nscale, it also provides an opportunity to examine mino-\nrities and outliers. While Big Data enables researchers\nto summarize human behaviour, researchers should not\nlose sight of a second major advantage of Big Data,\n``the plentiful representation of minorities'' (Welles,\nscholars are outliers with respect to their behaviour\non Twitter, Big Data analysis techniques could provide\nQuan-Haase et al. 9\nan opportunity to increase our understanding of the\ninner workings of the DH invisible college within\nTwitter.\nWe conclude that the concept of the invisible college\nas introduced by de Solla Price requires revisiting. The\ninvisible college formed on Twitter is messy, consisting\nof overlapping social contexts (professional, personal,\nand public), scholars with different habits of engage-\nment and both formal and informal ties. Future\nresearch could investigate how the invisible college\nformed on Twitter is associated with citation and co-\ncitation networks (Mutschke and Quan-Haase, 2001).\nWe also conclude that our findings support Myers\net al.'s (2014) notion of a hybrid network (social and\ninformational). Furthermore, our study informs and\nexpands Big Data research and illustrates that social\ncontext matters. Through its macro-level analysis, Big\nData has framed Twitter networks as a dichotomy \u00ad\ninformation versus social network. Our research pro-\nvides a more nuanced understanding of how shared\ninterests (e.g. common subject specialties), goals,\nunderstandings and pre-existing social ties can influence\nthe nature of the network. Within the context of DH\nscholarship, information networks do not function\nsolely as a means for broadcasting to and gathering\nfrom a large information network of followers.\nRather, it seems that ties that may start as informa-\ntion-based ties often become social ties in the context\nof finding shared ground.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis project was funded by a Social Science and Humanities\nReferences\nAladwani AM (2015) Facilitators, characteristics,\nand impacts of Twitter use: Theoretical analysis and\nempirical illustration.
