Existing research presents contradictory\nfindings concerning the sources of pro- and anti-immigration state legislation.

The findings are important because they show that partisan, demographic,\nand economic effects are often different within versus across states and may differently affect the volume versus the\nrelative tenor of legislative output.\n",

Existing research has yielded contra-\ndictory findings. Gulasekaram and Ramakrishnan find restric-\ntive legislation unrelated to state demographic change but\nrather a function of polarized partisan politics. By contrast,\nMonogan (2013), Nicholson-Crotty and Nicholson-Crotty\nsanship unrelated to state legislation, with Boushey and\nLuedtke presenting evidence that larger immigrant popula-\ntions induce more integrative state legislation. However, their\nresults also suggest that larger foreign-born populations were\nsignificantly related to restrictive legislation and that the\ngrowth of immigration was positively related to both integra-\ntion and control policies. Zingher (2014) finds that both legis-\nlative conservatism and the growth of immigration propelled\nrestrictive legislation while Marquez and Schraufnagel (2013)\nand Ybarra et al. (2016) present evidence of a more focused\nbacklash against Hispanic immigrants. However, Marquez\nand Schraufnagel's results again suggest a contradiction, with\nthe growth of state Hispanic populations also associated with\nincreases in pro-immigrant legislation.\nAn unresolved problem in existing research is the fail-\nure to address two sources of causal heterogeneity. First,\nexisting studies often fail to consider whether increased\nImmigrant legislation, across and within\nthe United States\nGary Reich\n Keywords\nImmigration policy, state politics and policy, immigration\nDepartment of Political Science, University of Kansas, USA\nCorresponding author:\nGary Reich, Department of Political Science, University of Kansas, 1541\nEmail: greich@ku.edu\nResearch Article\n2 Research and Politics \nlegislative activity necessarily alters the overall tenor of\nstate legislative output. Because immigrant legislation\nspans multiple issue areas (education, health care, law\nenforcement, labor laws, professional licensing, welfare\nbenefits), states produce varying mixes of accommodat-\ning and restrictive legislation. As a result, an increased\nvolume of one type of law (restrictive or accommodating)\nmay not necessarily change the relative tenor of state\nimmigrant legislation. Thus, research designs should\nconsider whether variable effects are presumed to affect\nthe volume of immigrant legislation, the overall tenor of\nlegislation, or both.\nSecond, researchers have generally ignored cross-state\nversus within-state causal effects at the state level.\nIndividual predictors at the state level often simultane-\nously encompass short-term changes observed within a\nstate over a given period of time--such as changes in the\ngrowth of immigrant populations or partisan control of\ngovernment--and cross-sectional effects that are static\nover the course of most observational studies: the same\nvariable also registers that some states are whiter, more\nRepublican, or have larger immigrant populations than\nothers. The problem is that in the presence of both causal\neffects, as Bell and Jones (2015) show, a single measure\nrepresents an uninterpretable, weighted average of these\ntwo effects. In situations where variables encompass both\na time-varying, \"within-unit\" process as well as a time-\ninvariant, \"between-unit\" effect, Bell and Jones argue for\na random effects estimation strategy that separately\nmeasures these two effects. This approach creates sepa-\nrate coefficients that distinguish time-variant and time-\ninvariant effects. \"Within-unit\" effects for each\ntime-varying independent variable are calculated by sub-\ntracting the (in this case) state mean from the value of\neach observation:\nx x\nij j\n-\nwhere each i represents an observation--here, a legislative\nyear--of variable x in state j and xj\nis the mean of that\nvariable across all observed years in state j. \"Between-unit\"\n(i.e., cross-state) effects can then be estimated using the\nmean value of the same variable at the state level xj\n, in\naddition to any other exclusively time-invariant meas-\nures, zj\n. In this manner, average contextual differences\nacross states can be distinguished from time-varying\nwithin-state effects. This \"between\" versus \"within\" hierar-\nchical approach is presented below for a dataset of state\nmodels separately measure the absolute number of each\ntype of law produced as well as the relative balance of\naccommodating versus restrictive legislation. At the same\ntime, variable effects are measured so as to distinguish\nwithin-state changes over time from more time-invariant,\ncross-state differences.\nIndependent variables\nBetween-state variables.Many variables that have figured\nprominently in recent research differ across states, but not\n(over the course of existing observational studies) within\nstates, including the following variables:\n(1) Institutions of direct democracy (Turner and Sharry,\nDifferences in the presence and strength of direct\ndemocracy are captured here via Lewis's (2011)\n\"Direct Democracy Impact\" measure, normalized\nto range from 0 (No citizen initiatives) to 5 (Highly\ninfluential direct democracy).1\nSquire's (2007) measure of legislative professional-\nism (measured here as 0 through 100) captures dif-\nferences between professional and citizen legislatures\nweighted combination of legislative salary, days in\nsession, and staff per legislator (as compared with\nmembers of Congress during the same year).\n(3) The growth of the state Latino population, 2000\u00ad\nSchraufnagel, 2013). This variable is included to\ncapture the specific effect of Latino immigration,\nwhich may differ from that of immigration among\nall nationalities (see below) and has been linked to\nrestrictive legislation.2\n(4) Citizen ideology (Monogan, 2013). This is meas-\nured as the percentage of the state population in\n2005 that self-identified as liberal, based on public\n(5) Immigrant State Welfare Eligibility (Filindra, 2013;\nResponsibility and Work Opportunities\nReconciliation Act (PRWORA) afforded states dis-\ncretion to define standards for immigrant welfare\neligibility. The welfare policies that states estab-\nlished in the period following PRWORAcan be seen\nas establishing a baseline level of accommodation or\nrestriction that may influence subsequent legisla-\ntion; thus, the direction of legislation between 2005\nand 2012 may display continuity with immigration\nwelfare policy regimes established post-PRWORA.\nState variations in defining immigrant welfare eligi-\nbility are captured via Hero and Preuhs factor-score\nmeasure, which is based on nine welfare-related\npolicy items and ranges from -1.11 (exclusive) to\nWithin-state variables.Other variables identified in recent\nresearch contain both a cross-sectional and a time-varying\neffect, with the time-varying component measuring changes\n(1) Percent foreign-born population (Nicholson-Crotty\nand Nicholson-Crotty, 2011; Boushey and Ludtke,\naverage measures the \"stock\" of immigrants between\nures changes in the size of the immigrant population\n(the \"flow\" component) during that same period.\n(2) Change in per capita state income, lagged one year\n(Filindra and Pearson-Moskowitz, 2013; Ybarra\nmeasures operationalize this effect: the percentage\nof Democratic state legislators (averaged over both\nstate legislative chambers), and Republican control\nof both the executive and legislative branches\n(measured dichotomously).\n(4) Latino legislative representation (Preuhs, 2007),\nmeasured as the percentage of Latino state legisla-\ntors, averaged over both legislative chambers.6\nDependent variable and estimation procedure\nThe dependent variables are derived from an original coding\nand 2012.7 The data is grouped by state and legislative year,\nyielding 371 observations across 8 years (see Table A1 in\nonline appendix for additional information on the coding\nprotocol and a summary of laws approved in each state).8\nTwo types of laws are analyzed.Accommodating legislation\nsought to make public services, employment, state licenses,\nand housing more accessible to immigrant populations,\nregardless of their legal status. Restrictive legislation sought\nto bar access to the same goods and outcomes and/or enlisted\nstate and local law enforcement in efforts to identify unau-\nthorized immigrants. Following most recent work on state\nimmigration legislation (Ybarra, 2015; Marquez and\nSchraufnagel, 2013; Nicholson-Crotty and Nicholson-\ncounts of each type of law are used; the presumption is that\ncounts of legislative output speak meaningfully to the\nimportance of immigrant-related issues across legislatures\nas well as the policy intentions of legislators.9\nAs is common with panel data, the counts of accommo-\ndating and restrictive state legislation are \"overdispersed\"\n(the variance is greater than the mean). Following Gelman\ndispersion is incorporated directly by including random\neffects at both the state and the observation level, yielding\na three-level, Poisson regression:\nY Poisson\nij\n~ e j j ij j ij ij ij j\nx x x x\n   \n+ -\n( )+ + -\n( )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00b5  \nj j j j\nX z u\n= + + +\nIn this model, the number of laws approved in legislative\nyear i in state j (Yij\n) is a function of the vector of \"between-\nstate\" (j\n) and \"within-state\" covariates, ij.\nThe between-\nstate components include the state-level means xij\n( ), time\ninvariant measures (zj\n), and a random state-level effect\n(uj\n). The variance at the observation level, , includes the\nadditional random effect \nx x\n-\n( ) that captures varia-\ntion beyond that explained by the Poisson regression (i.e.,\noverdispersion). The random effects are assumed to be dis-\ntributed normally.10 Posterior means and standard devia-\ntions are estimated via Bayesian Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) resampling.11 Because immigration-\nrelated legislation (both restrictive and accommodating)\nincreased steadily in almost all states between 2005 and\n2012, a linear trend is included, with each year indexed as\none through eight. The year index was statistically signifi-\ncant for both pro- and anti-immigration legislation, while\nalso improving the overall fit of the models, as indicated\nby a lower Bayesian deviance information criterion.12 The\nWoolridge test for autocorrelated errors in panel data\n(Woolridge, 2002) failed to reject the null hypothesis of no\nserial correlation.\nFindings: Revisiting state legislation\nTable 1 provides both the incidence rate ratio (IRR) and\nstandard deviations for each variable, with asterisks indi-\ncating particularly robust directional effects: for a positive\n(negative) posterior mean, it indicates that less than 5% of\nits posterior distribution contains negative (positive) val-\nues.13 Models 1 and 2 illustrate the importance of distin-\nguishing cross-sectional from time-varying effects. Model\n1 suggests that the count of accommodating legislation\nincreased with the share of Democratic legislators within a\nstate: each percentage increase in Democratic legislative\nrepresentation increased the count of accommodating laws\nby approximately 5% per year. However, the \"between\nstate\" coefficient shows that states that averaged higher\nwere actually associated with a 2% reduction in the annual\ncount of accommodating legislation.\nDemographic and economic effects are also marked by\ndifferent within- and between-state effects. Within states,\nrestrictive laws increased by 52% for every percentage\nincrease in the immigrant population. But states with\nlarger immigrant populations passed more of both types\nof immigrant legislation: the average size of the immi-\ngrant population was associated with a 5\u00ad7% annual\nincrease in both restrictive and accommodating legisla-\ntion. Changes in state per capita income were also related\nto immigration legislation, consistent with Ybarra et al.\n(2016). However, their study only examined punitive state\nlaws. By contrast, Models 1 and 2 show that each percent-\nage increase in per capita income (the \"within-state\"\neffect) is associated with, respectively, a 4% and 8%\n4 Research and Politics \ndecrease in both accommodating and restrictive legisla-\ntion, suggesting that immigrant legislation became less\nsalient to legislators as state income grew. These distinc-\ntions were not possible in existing research, either because\nresearchers collapsed state legislative output over multi-\nple years (losing the time component) or did not distin-\nguish within- versus between-state variable effects.\nOther variables in Models 1 and 2 are more closely\nassociated with one type law than the other. Citizen ideol-\nogy, direct democracy, and the share of Latino legislators\nare strongly associated with counts of restrictive legisla-\ntion, but less so with accommodating legislation. In\nModel 2, restrictive legislation increased by 21% for each\nunit increase in Lewis's six-point \"Direct Democracy\"\nTable 1.

The cred-\nible interval indicates a greater than 95% posterior prob-\nability of these directional effects. By contrast,\naccommodating legislation is closely associated with\nmore generous welfare benefits for immigrants: each per-\ncentage increase in the IW eligibility scale increased the\ncount of accommodating laws by 61%, which translates\ninto 1.7 more accommodating laws per legislative year\nfrom the lowest to highest observed values of the scale.\nStill other variables commonly cited in existing research,\nsuch as legislative professionalism, the growth in state\nLatino populations, and Republican control, had more\nambiguous effects, with wide credible intervals that\nencompassed both increases and decreases in each type\nof immigration legislation.\nOf course, as argued above, changes in the volume of each\ntype of law do not address shifts in the relative balance of\nlegislative output. Table 2 uses a multinomial logistic model\nto compare three legislative outcomes. In some instances, leg-\nislatures approved more restrictive (R) laws than accommo-\ndating (A) laws. This outcome, R>A, constitutes the base\ncategory in Table 2, and is contrasted to outcomes in which\naccommodating legislation predominated (A>R), and accom-\nmodating and restrictive laws were approved in equal num-\nbers (A=R).14 Relative risk ratios (RRR) estimate the effect of\na one-unit change in each variable on the probability of the\nA>R andA=R outcomes relative to the base category, holding\nall other variables constant.\nThe results suggest that partisan effects were important\ntotherelativebalanceoflaws,consistentwithGulasekaram\nand Ramakrishnan (2015), but in nuanced ways. In states\nwhere Republican control of legislative and executive\nbranches was more common, the odds of a relatively\naccommodating outcome (A>R) were 81% lower (RRR =\n0.19) compared to the \"restrictive dominant\" (R>A) out-\ncome, a directional effect with a greater than 99% poste-\nrior probability (PP). A similar, but weaker directional\neffect occurs between the \"neutral\" outcome (A=R) and\nthe R>A base category (RRR = 0.45, PP = 82%). Thus,\nalthough Table 1 suggests that Republican control of state\ngovernment was not strongly associated with the volume\nof either accommodating or restrictive legislation, Table 2\nsuggests that it moved the balance of legislative output in\na restrictive direction. Likewise, within states, each per-\ncentage increase in Democratic legislative representation\nincreased the odds of the accommodating outcome over\nthe restrictive base outcome by 8% (PP = 99%) and by 5%\nfor the A=R outcome (PP = 83%). However, legislatures\nthat averaged higher Democratic representation across the\ntoward a relatively more accommodating stance. Taken\ntogether, Tables 1 and 2 suggest an interesting legislative\ndynamic: more Democratic-leaning states were actually\nless likely to adopt a more accommodating tone toward\nimmigrants, except as the share of Democratic legislators\nwithin the state increased.\nTable 2 further clarifies the directional effects of eco-\nnomic and demographic variables. As the average size of\nthe foreign-born population increased, states were more\nlikely to be, on balance, accommodating (RRR = 1.06,\nthan restrictive. Likewise, each percentage increase in\naverage per capita income increased the odds of the more\naccommodating outcome (A>R) over the restrictive out-\ncome by 59% (PP = 99%), and the neutral outcome by\n90% (PP = 99%). Thus, larger average foreign-born pop-\nulations raised legislative output while higher average\nper capita income reduced output (Table 1); however,\nboth variables were positively associated with a shift\ntoward less restrictive outcomes, consistent with\nBoushey and Luedtke (2011) and Filindra and Pearson-\nTable 2 also suggests hypotheses regarding the politi-\ncal processes producing each outcome. The odds of the\nA>R outcome compared to the R>A base outcome approx-\nimately doubled (RRR = 1.96, PP = 99%) for each unit\nincrease in the Immigrant Welfare State and increased by\n5% with average Latino legislative representation (PP =\n99%). Each percentage increase in Latino representation\nwithin states further increased the relative probability of\nthe accommodating outcome over the restrictive outcome\nby 18% (PP = 88%). Thus, growing Latino representation\ndecreased the volume of restrictive legislation (Table 1)\nand tilted state legislation toward a relatively more accom-\nmodating balance (Table 2). By contrast, more direct\ndemocracy decreased the odds of the accommodating and\nneutral outcomes by, respectively, 11% (PP = 87%) and\n20% (PP = 92%) compared to the base outcome. In short,\na restrictive outcome was less likely where states imple-\nmented more inclusive post-PRWORA welfare benefits\nfor immigrants and where Latinos were a larger and grow-\ning share of state legislators. By contrast, stronger institu-\ntions of direct democracy reduced the odds of either the\naccommodating or neutral outcomes compared to the\nmore restrictive outcome.\nNaturally, the results here are time-bound, encompass-\ning an eight-year period when the forces of immigration\nrestriction were extremely influential in Republican state\npolitics; and because there is no uniform standard for clas-\nsifying state legislation, results may vary according to how\nresearchers classify state legislation. However, the find-\nings here suggest two guidelines that would provide more\nclarity and consistency to future research. First, given the\nmultidimensional nature of immigrant legislation, causal\narguments need to distinguish variable effects on the vol-\nume of legislation versus the relative balance of laws.\nUnderstanding whether states end up moving toward a\nrelatively restrictive set of policies (e.g., Arizona), more\naccommodating policies (California), or some\n6 Research and Politics \nintermediate outcome depends on this distinction. Second,\nresearch would benefit from a clearer distinction of within-\nand between-state variable effects where variables encom-\npass both processes. Substantively, many explanatory\nvariables simultaneously measure the \"pull of history\"--\nrelatively enduring contextual differences across states--\nas well as short-term economic, political, and demographic\nshifts. The forces may exert different directional effects on\nlegislation, a fact that is obscured when research designs\ninclude no time component or when variables measure an\nuninterpretable average of both effects.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nSupplementary materials\nThe replication files are available at http://thedata.harvard.edu/dvn/\ndv/researchandpolitics.\nTable 2.

The immigrant welfare (IW) scale is based on immigrant\neligibility for state health and welfare programs as of 1999,\nincluding Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (both\nbefore and after the federally-mandated five-year ban), state\ncash payments, food stamps, Medicaid funds, Supplemental\nSecurity Income, and state health care programs. While there\nis a six-year gap between the IW measure and the start of the\nlegislation examined here, the measure establishes whether a\npossible policy trajectory adopted after PRWORA (i.e., as of\n\n4.

Only laws approved by the legislature were considered,\nalthough the substantive results are substantially similar\nwhen resolutions are included. The data were obtained from\nNational Council of State Legislatures (2017).\n8. The N of 371 reflects the fact that not every state legisla-\nture produces legislation annually. Legislatures in Montana,\nNevada, North Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming legislatures\nmeet biennially, as did the Oregon legislature until 2012 and\nArkansas until 2010. Nebraska's non-partisan legislature is\nexcluded from the analysis.\n 9. Raw counts also avoid the problem of determining \"policy\nrelevance,\" which involves ambiguous criteria, such as: (a)\nthe share of immigrants likely to be affected; (b) effects on\ncurrent immigrants versus future arrivals; (c) gaps between\nlegislative intent and implementation/enforcement, and (d)\nsymbolic versus substantive effects.\n10. The variances are assumed to be normally-distributed in the\nmultilevel Poisson model. Alternatively, a negative bino-\nmial distribution can be used to fit overdispersed count data\nby including an overdispersion factor. However, such mod-\nels use a single parameter to calculate Level 1 and Level 2\noverdispersion, leading Rabe-Hesketh and Skondral (2008:\n394) to advise against them. Regardless, the distributional\nassumption does not appear critical here: coefficients and\nstandard errors reported below were virtually identical\nwhen the model was estimated via a negative binomial\ndistribution.\n11. Because the data represent a population, rather than a sam-\nple, the goal is to assess the goodness of fit of the models\nrather than infer a population value, as in classical hypothesis\ntesting (Gill, 2001). Posterior means and standard deviations\nfollowing a \"burn in\" period of 10,000 iterations.\nare not easily captured. For example, state legislation may\nreflect the growing politicization of immigration nationwide\nduring a period when Congress debated various immigration\nreform proposals or it may also reflect what Gulasekaram and\n13. The incidence rate ratio shows the change in the rate (count)\nof the dependent variable changes with each unit change in\nthe independent variable, holding all other variables con-\nstant: an incidence rate ratio above 1.00 represents a percent-\nage increase in the count, while numbers below 1.00 register\na percentage decrease in the count.\n14. For the purposes of this analysis, legislative years in which\nno immigrant legislation of any kind was approved are\nremoved, yielding an N of 286. Distinguishing legislative\noutcomes according to the three categories, reduced the\nmeasured state-level variance in both Models 1 and 2 to zero.\nThus, the multinomial logistic models in Table 2 are esti-\nmated as single-level models.\nCarnegie Corporation of New York Grant\nThis publication was made possible (in part) by a grant from\nCarnegie Corporation of New York.

Neutral\nlaws were defined as those that had no discernible restric-\ntive/punitive or accommodating/integrative intent.\nTo assess the reliability of the categories, two coders\nseparately classified all laws and legislation approved in\n2012. Their initial evaluations substantially overlapped (r =\n.77. p<.001). Discordant codings most often related to laws\nplaced in the \"Neutral\" category. Based on the initial cod-\ning, some clarifications were made to the categories. First,\nlaws that stipulated clarifications to previously approved\nlegislation, but that did not change the intent of the original\nlaw were coded as Neutral. Second, human trafficking laws,\nwhose intent could be construed as both accommodating or\nrestrictive, were to be classified as \"Neutral\" unless: (a) they\nonly contained punitive elements (e.g. punishments for\nhuman trafficking but no assistance for victims of human\ntrafficking), in which case they were coded as Restrictive; or\n(b) they only focused on providing relief to victims of traf-\nficking, in which case they were coded as Accommodating.\nThird, laws authorizing or releasing funds for programs pre-\nviously approved were coded as \"Neutral\" provided no\nchange was made to existing legislation.\nSubsequent coding was done separately by each coder\nfor each legislative year. In instances were coders had\ndoubts about the proper classification of laws, these were\nnoted and subsequent discussion among the research team\nfollowed, with the final decision made by the author. For\npurposes of the analysis here, \"Neutral\" were excluded\n(these comprised 244 of all laws over all states, or 17.4% of\nanalyzed in Table 1 was comprised of 1,149 laws that fell\ninto the \"Accommodating\" and \"Restrictive\" categories.\nThe three coding categories, and examples of laws placed\ninto each category, are as follows:\n1. Accommodating:\nExamples:\n- Laws protecting immigrants from fraud, theft, abu-\nsive labor/business practices (e.g. a \"notary public\"\ncannot present him/herself as a lawyer) or aiding\nimmigrants who are victims of some crime. -Laws\nthat ensure that legal immigrants are not denied\nrights or liberties.\n- Laws that state that immigrants and/or legal resi-\ndents are allowed to practice a profession and/or\nacquire a state license.\n- Laws that create a state program that targets or\nassists immigrants.\n2. Restrictive:\nExamples:\n- Laws that enlist state/local officials in identifying\nor apprehending immigrants or create partner-\nships with federal immigration law enforcement\nauthorities.\n- Laws that specifically exclude unauthorized or\nauthorized immigrants from any state program.\n-Laws that specifically exclude unauthorized or\nauthorized immigrants from any profession or\noccupation.\n- Laws that mandate verification of immigration sta-\ntus for employment or access to state services.\n-Laws that defund programs targeted toward\nimmigrants.\n3. Neutral:\nExamples:\n- Initiation of a cost study or information-gathering\nwith no predetermined policy objective (either\nrestrictive or accommodating).\n- Allocation of money for an expense incurred as\na result of immigration (either legal or illegal)\nor distributions of revenue accrued from\nimmigrants.\n- Human trafficking laws that provided some combi-\nnation of penalties for traffickers and assistance to\nvictims of trafficking.\n- Provisions upholding existing legal requirements/\nstandards (e.g. providing emergency first-aid ser-\nvices regardless of immigration status, banning of\ndiscrimination based on race, ethnicity). -Laws stip-\nulating legal or technical clarifications to previ-\nously passed legislation that leave the substance of\nthat legislation unaltered.\n10 Research and Politics \nState Accommodating Laws Restrictive Laws\nTable A2.
