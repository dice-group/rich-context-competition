In adults and children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, a polymorphism in the\ninterleukin 6 (IL-6) promoter at position 174 predicts illness magnitude. In addition, polymorphisms in the\ninterleukin 10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), and interferon g (IFN-g) genes are associated with\nimmune responsiveness and the frequency of complications. Here, the effect of these polymorphisms on illness\nand seroconversion during infection with rhinovirus type 39 (RV39) was evaluated.\nMethods. Seventy-two adults were genotyped for the selected polymorphisms, experimentally exposed to RV39,\nand followed to track infection, seroconversion, and symptoms and signs of illness. Regression analysis was used\nto determine whether these polymorphisms predicted seroconversion and illness magnitude in 57 infected subjects.\nResults. The low-production IL-6 174 phenotype (C/C genotype) was associated with greater symptom\nmagnitudes, and the IFN-g phenotype +874 predicted the frequency of seroconversion. No relationship between\nthe IL-10 or TNF-a polymorphisms and any measured outcome was documented. The concentration of IL-6\nprotein, as measured in nasal wash fluids from subjects, was positively correlated with symptom magnitude, but\nit was independent of the IL-6 174 genotypes representing the high- and low-production phenotypes.\nConclusions. These results document statistically significant associations between the IL-6 174 and IFN-g\n+874 polymorphisms and specific responses to experimental RV39 infection. For the IL-6 174 polymorphism,\nthe results replicate those for experimental RSV infection.\nColdlike illness (CLI) is the most common disease af-\nfecting humans. The majority of CLIs are caused by a\nviral upper respiratory tract infection (vURTI), which\ncould be due to any of a number of viruses, including\nrhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza\nvirus, coronavirus, and enterovirus, among others [1,\n2]. Although CLIs are usually self-limited, they cause\nsignificant morbidity and are known precipitants of\nPotential conflicts of interest: none reported.\nFinancial support: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (grant\nAI066367); Pennsylvania Department of Health (Commonwealth Research\nEnhancement grant); John D. and Catherine T.

The viral symptom and sign\ncomplex (vSSC) is a summary measure of the degree\nof illness defined by the magnitudes and durations of\nthose symptom and sign elements typically associated\nwith a vURTI [4]. The vSSC elements are similar for\nthe different causal viruses [1, 5] and are believed to\nrepresent the overt expression of the host immune and\ninflammatory responses to a vURTI [6]. This com-\nmonality suggests that these viruses provoke their vSSCs\nand cause CLIs via activation of similar immune and\ninflammatory pathways.\nCytokines are known to orchestrate and coordinate\nthe host immune and inflammatory responses during\na vURTI [7, 8]. For example, assays of serial nasal wash\nspecimens from adult subjects experimentally infected\nwith rhinovirus, RSV, influenza virus, and coronavirus\ndocument consistent patterns of interleukin 1 (IL-1),\ninterleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and interleukin 10\n(IL-10) production in nasal secretion that temporally track the\nvSSC and respond appropriately to interventions and factors\nIn the population of individuals with a vURTI, the vSSC is\nvariable, such that not all vURTIs are associated with a CLI\n[17], and past studies have documented a variety of factors\nthat modulate the vSSC and consequently CLI expression [18].\nRegarding the latter, a study of natural RSV infection in infants\n[19] and a follow-up study of experimental RSV infection in\nadults [20] reported that the C/C genotype of a single-nucle-\notide polymorphism in the IL-6 promoter at position 174\nwas associated with a greater vSSC. The primary hypothesis\ntested in the present study was that this IL-6 genotype is as-\nsociated with a greater vSSC and a more prolonged CLI during\nexperimental infection with another virus, rhinovirus type 39\n(RV39). Because the studies of RSV also documented the effects\nof polymorphisms in the IL-10, interferon g (IFN-g), and tu-\nmor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) genes on immune responses\nand complication expression, a secondary hypothesis tested in\nthe present study was that these polymorphisms also affect the\nMETHODS\nHealthy adult subjects were recruited by advertisement. The\nprotocol, study methods, and potential risks were explained to\nthe recruited subjects; written informed consent for study par-\nticipation and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\nscreening was obtained; and a general physical examination was\nperformed and a health history taken for each recruit at screen-\ning. From the subjects who were not excluded for medical\nreasons, standard demographic information was collected;\nblood was drawn for total and differential blood cell counts,\nclinical chemical analysis, and assays of serum RV39 neutral-\nizing antibody titer and HIV antibodies; urine was collected\nfor clinical urinalysis; and buccal swabs were collected for DNA\nisolation.\nSeventy-two healthy (according to history, physical exami-\nnation, total and differential blood cell count, blood chemistry,\nurine profile, and negative test result for HIV antibodies), sus-\nold) subjects were enrolled. Two days before admittance to\ncloister (day 2), blood was drawn from each subject for repeat\nassay of serum RV39 neutralizing antibody titer. Subjects were\nthen admitted to the cloister site, where they were confined to\nan isolated floor of a hotel for 6 days (day 0, 24-h preexposure\nperiod; days 1\u00ad5, sequential 24-h postexposure periods). On\nday 0, female subjects with positive urine pregnancy test results\nwere excluded, as were subjects presenting with a CLI. At the\nend of day 0, each subject was inoculated with RV39 by direct\ninstillation of course drops to the nasal mucosa at an estimated\ndose of 100 times the median tissue culture infective dose\n[21]. On each day of cloister, all subjects underwent a general\nphysical examination as well as an examination of the ears,\nnose, and throat and completed a symptom diary; in addition,\nnasal mucociliary clearance function was assessed, nasal secre-\ntion production was measured, and a nasal wash was per-\nformed, with samples aliquoted and frozen at 70C for later\nassay. Throughout the study period, subjects were not permitted\nto take prescription or over-the-counter medications, with the\nexception of acetaminophen (which was dispensed by study\npersonnel) and birth control drugs. At the end of day 5, the\nsubjects were interviewed by a physician, provided with specific\ninstructions for follow-up, and discharged from cloister. On or\naround study day 28, a convalescent blood sample was drawn\nfrom each subject. The study protocol and informed consent\nforms were approved by the institutional review boards at the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.\nVirology. The challenge virus was a safety-tested strain of\nRV39. RV39 serum neutralizing antibodies were assayed at\nscreening, on day 2, and on day 28 by a standard 2-fold\ndilution method, with titers reported as reciprocals of the final\ndilution [22]. Seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold increase\nin titer between days 2 and 28. A sample of nasal wash fluid\nfrom each subject on each study day was placed (3:1, vol/vol)\nin a cryovial containing 4 concentrated virus collecting broth\nand then frozen at 70C. For RV39 detection, the sample was\nthawed, 0.2 mL of the mixture was inoculated into tubes of\nhuman embryonic lung fibroblast cells, and the cells were ob-\nserved for rhinovirus cytopathic effect [22]. Infection was de-\nfined as detection of the challenge virus on any of days 1\u00ad5.\nA variable representing infection duration, \"days shed,\" was\nconstructed as the sum of the days on which RV39 was isolated.\nDNA isolation, genotyping, and phenotype assignment.\nGenomic DNA was isolated from the buccal cells by means of\na QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen), amplified using a Repli-g\nWhole Genome Amplification kit (Qiagen), and quantified with\na Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay kit (Invitrogen) [23]. The\nprimer and probe sequences for the cytokine genotype assays\nwere based on those used in previous publications for IL-6\nTaqMan Genotyping Master mix (Applied Biosystems) accord-\ning to a published protocol [27]. The 7300 System SDS software\n(version 1.4; Applied Biosystems) was used for instrument con-\ntrol, automated data collection, and genotype assignment.\nPhenotypes corresponding to in vitro cytokine production\ngenotype, using the convention published by Gentile and col-\ngenotypes were assigned to the high-production phenotype and\nC/C to the low-production phenotype; for TNF-a 308, the\nG/A and A/A genotypes were assigned to the high-production\nphenotype and G/G to the low-production phenotype; for IFN-\ng +874, the T/T genotype was assigned to the high-production\nphenotype, T/A to the intermediate-production phenotype, and\nhigh-production phenotype, GCC/ACC and GCC/ATA to the\nintermediate-production phenotype, and ACC/ACC, ACC/\nATA, and ATA/ATA to the low-production phenotype. For IFN-\ncoded as 1 for low production, 2 for intermediate production,\nphenotypes were coded as 1 for low production and 2 for high\nproduction.\nIL-6 protein assay. One aliquot of the nasal wash fluid\ncollected on each day from each of 65 subjects was thawed and\nassayed for IL-6 by means of a commercially available enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay (BioSource) [34]. The lower de-\ntection limit of the assay was 0.1 pg/mL. For each subject, a\nsummary variable for IL-6 production was constructed as the\nlog of the baseline-adjusted IL-6 concentrations summed over\nthe 5 postexposure days of cloister. Summed values that were\n!0 were assigned a value of .\nSymptom assessment. Thirteen vSSC elements were eval-\nuated by means of a self-completed diary on each study day,\nusing a 4-point scale (none, mild, moderate, or severe). These\nelements represented 4 symptom domains: nasal symptoms\n(rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and sneezing), throat symptoms\n(sore throat and cough), general symptoms (headache, malaise,\nchills, sweats, and fever), and complication symptoms (earache,\nchest congestion, and sinus pain). For each element, the base-\nline score on day 0 was subtracted from the score on each of\nthe 5 postchallenge days. Summary variables for each domain\nand for the total symptom score were calculated as the sum\nover all days of the baseline-adjusted scores for all contained\nelements (negative summed values were assigned a value of 0).\nThe daily diary included a question as to the presence or ab-\nsence of a \"cold.\" A continuous variable, \"cold days,\" was con-\nstructed by summing the yes responses over days 1\u00ad5.\nObjective sign assessment. On each cloister day, subjects\nexpelled their nasal secretions into preweighed tissues and\nsealed the tissues in plastic bags of known weight. At the end\nof each 24-h period, the bags with the expended tissues were\nweighed, and the secretion weight (ie, the nasal secretion pro-\nduction) was determined by subtraction [21]. Nasal mucoci-\nliary clearance function was measured by placing 20 mL of a\ndyed saccharin solution bilaterally onto the anterior aspect of\nthe inferior turbinate using a calibrated pipette. The nasal mu-\ncociliary clearance time was calculated as the difference between\nthe time when the solution was placed and the time when the\nsubject reported a sweet taste [35]. Summary nasal secretion\nproduction and mucociliary clearance time variables were cal-\nculated as the baseline-adjusted sum of the values over days 1\u00ad\n5. Because these summary variables were not normally distrib-\nuted, the data for both were log-transformed, and values that\nwere !0 were assigned a value of .\nData analysis. The 9 continuous outcome variables were\nthe log of the summary nasal secretion weight, mucociliary\nclearance time, and IL-6 concentration; the summary nasal,\nthroat, general, complication, and total symptom scores; and\nthe number of cold days. The presence or absence of serocon-\nversion was treated as a dichotomous outcome variable. The\npotential predictor variables consisted of the IL-6, IL-10, TNF-\na, and IFN-g phenotypes, day 2 RV39 titer, number of virus-\nshedding days, age in years, race (white was coded as 1, and\nall other races were coded as 2), and sex (female was coded as\n1, and male was coded as 2). To determine whether these var-\niables were statistically significant predictors of each continuous\noutcome variable, multiple regression analysis was used. To\ndetermine whether these variables were statistically significant\npredictors of seroconversion, logistic regression was used. The\nrelationships between the log of the baseline-adjusted IL-6 pro-\ntein concentration and the continuous outcome variables were\nevaluated using simple linear regression. All statistical proce-\ndures were performed using NCSS 2000 Statistical Package soft-\nware (Kaysville). Unless otherwise indicated, data are presented\nas mean  standard deviation.\nRESULTS\non study day 2 and were defined by the protocol as non-\nsusceptible. In addition, 5 subjects from whom RV39 was not\nrecovered on any day were defined as uninfected (no \"wild\"\nviruses were isolated from any nasal secretion sample), and 2\nsubjects did not have buccal samples available for cytokine\ngenotype analysis.

The distribution\nof cytokine phenotypes was as follows: for TNF-a, 12 for high\nand 45 for low production; for IL-6, 47 for high and 9 for low\nproduction; for IFN-g, 9 for high, 24 for intermediate, and 24\nfor low production; and for the IL-10 haplotype, 16 for high,\nTable 1.

Limiting the possible\npredictors to the cytokine phenotypes, number of days shed,\nand baseline RV39 titer produced no significant effect of any\nvariable on that outcome.

One study\nof RSV infection in hospitalized infants reported that the low-\nproduction IL-6 174 phenotype was associated with greater\nillness severity, and a study of experimental RSV infection in\nadults reported that the low-production IL-6 174 phenotype\nwas associated with a greater vSSC. The results of the present\nstudy of experimental RV39 infection in adults are consistent\nwith those findings and support our primary hypothesis. Spe-\ncifically, the low-production IL-6 174 phenotype predicted a\ngreater vSSC and greater symptom scores for most symptom\ndomains in the RV39-infected subjects, with the effect realized\nacross all postexposure days (Figure 1). Although the IL-6 174\nphenotype had no effect on the 2 objective illness measures\n(nasal secretion production and mucociliary clearance time),\nthese outcome variables were also not predicted by the IL-6\n174 phenotype in adults experimentally infected with RSV\nThe results of 2 other studies support the hypothesis that\nthe IL-6 174 phenotype has an effect on vURTI expression\nas reflected in the frequency of a common vURTI complication,\notitis media [36]. Specifically, in a cross-sectional study Patel\nand colleagues [37] reported that the low-production IL-6\n174 phenotype was significantly more frequent in children\nwith a history of recurrent acute otitis media compared with\nchildren without a history of otitis media, and in a longitudinal\nstudy of young children Alper and colleagues [23] reported that\nthe low-production IL-6 174 phenotype was a significant pre-\ndictor of the otitis media coincidence rate for rhinovirus\ninfections.\nA second objective of this study was to explore the effect of\npolymorphisms on the host responses to RV39 infection. These\npolymorphisms were shown to affect other host responses dur-\ning RSV infection [20] and the rate of vURTI complications\nthe IFN-g +874 polymorphism was shown to have a significant\neffect, with its phenotype being an inverse predictor of the rate\nof seroconversion during RV39 infection. In adults experi-\nmentally infected with RSV, the TNF-a 308 phenotype was\ndirectly related to the frequency of seroconversion, whereas the\nIFN-g +874 phenotype was indirectly related to the frequency\nof subjects developing a 2-fold increase in nasal RSV-specific\nsecretory immunoglobulin A antibody titers [20]. In the present\nstudy, the lack of significant effects of the other cytokine poly-\nmorphisms may be explained by their primary effects in pre-\nvious studies on vURTI complications such as the frequencies\nof otitis media and pneumonia [19, 23, 37], events that were\nnot observed in the present study.\nFrom these results, there is sufficient evidence to advance\nthe hypothesis that the IL-6 174 C/C genotype (low-pro-\nduction phenotype) is associated with up-regulated inflam-\nmatory responses to a vURTI as reflected in the vSSC and the\nfrequency of expressed complications. Although the mecha-\nnism(s) by which that polymorphism exerts these effects re-\nmains elusive, given the complex and poorly understood tem-\nporal interactions among the various cytokines and other\ninflammatory chemicals in provoking the vSSC and other ex-\npressions of a vURTI [4], the simplest hypothesis can be re-\njected. Specifically, as reported here and in past studies [12, 14,\n16], higher nasal IL-6 concentrations are positively correlated\nin both phase and magnitude with the expressed vSSC, leading\nto the expectation that the high-production IL-6 174 phe-\nnotype would predict higher nasal IL-6 concentrations and con-\nsequently greater illness magnitudes. However, neither of these\nexpectations was supported by the experimental data; that is,\nno statistically significant relationship was demonstrated be-\ntween the IL-6 174 phenotype and local IL-6 nasal secretion\nconcentration for either experimental RV39 or experimental\nRSV infection in adults [20], and for all studies reviewed the\nlow-production (not the high-production) IL-6 174 pheno-\ntype predicted greater illness and complications [19, 20, 23,\nIn interpreting these results, it should be recognized that the\ncytokine phenotypes were assigned on the basis of in vitro\nresults for stimulated cytokine release by leukocytes that may\n[28, 30, 38] or may not relate to in vivo cytokine production\nin the nasal mucosa, blood [39, 40], and local secretions [20]\nduring a vURTI. Moreover, there are a large number of poly-\nmorphisms in the genes for IL-6 and other cytokines that were\nnot assayed in the present study but that have the potential to\ninteract with the assayed polymorphisms to influence cytokine\nproduction [33, 41\u00ad44], and past studies have shown that the\nlocal production of specific cytokines was influenced by poly-\nmorphisms in the genes for other cytokines (eg, the TNF-a\n308 polymorphism predicted IL-6 and IL-8 protein concen-\ntrations in nasal secretions) [20]. These observations emphasize\nthe difficulties of predicting cytokine production for any bio-\nlogical compartment in response to a vURTI using the geno-\ntype-phenotype associations for a given cytokine polymorphism\non the basis of in vitro studies.\nIn conclusion, the present study documents statistically sig-\nnificant effects of certain cytokine polymorphisms on selected\nexpressions of RV39 infection. Limitations of this study include\nthe relatively few cytokine polymorphisms assayed, the assay\nof only IL-6 protein in nasal secretions, and the restriction of\noutcomes to seroconversion, provoked symptoms, and 2 ob-\njective measures of illness. In addition, because this study was\nlimited to adults, in whom the frequency of vURTI compli-\ncations is low, the effects of these cytokine polymorphisms on\ncomplication frequency could not be assessed. Nonetheless, it\nis highly likely that continued study of cytokine polymorphisms\nin the settings of natural and experimental vURTIs will yield\nimportant information regarding the genetic basis for CLIs,\nvURTIs, and vURTI complications.\n"
