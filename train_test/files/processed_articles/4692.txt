In most animal species, males compete for females\nbecause females usually invest more in offspring and are therefore selected to be more\ndiscriminating in selecting mates (Bateman, 1948). Sometimes male mating competition\ninvolves fighting other males for rank or territory; sometimes it requires traits and displays\nthat females prefer in their mates. Males who succeed in these competitions have more\noffspring, and this shapes traits that foster such success, even if those traits may also lead to\ndetrimental consequences (Darwin, 1871).\nPhysiological sexual dimorphism in humans indicates that male mating competition\nis substantial (Leutenegger and Kelley, 1977; Plavcan and van Schaik, 1997), yet paternal\nMale financial consumption\ninvestment is still much larger in humans than in other primates (Buss and Schmitt, 1993;\nGeary and Flinn, 2001). Children who grow up without a father present suffer higher\nmortality rates (Hill and Hurtado, 1996) and paternal investment in offspring may enhance\nthe offspring's reproductive success (Geary, 2005). Across cultures, women differentially\nevaluate male socio-economic status in considerations of partner suitability, as it may\nindicate paternal investment potential (Buss, 1989).\nDarwin was initially puzzled by costly traits such as peacock tails that could not be\naccounted for by survival advantage; he later concluded that these were features that led to\nreproductive advantage (1871). For humans, male displays of wealth may literally be a\ncostly signal analogue to the peacock's tail (Miller and Todd, 1998). Displays of\nprestigious consumer goods could be an honest signal of male mate value, as they would\nindicate available resources as well as skills at acquiring wealth (Colarelli and Dettman,\nconsumption of consumer goods and even suggested that inherited psychological\nmechanisms were responsible for this relationship. Colarelli and Dettman (2003) note that\nadvertisers are well aware of the importance of prestige when marketing products, and will\ntry to associate a product with prestige even when there is no functional relationship. An\nethnographic study of Amazonian foragers and slash-and-burn farmers found that those\nwho had greater monetary resources allocated a greater portion of expenditures towards\nluxury goods, and this tendency was stronger in men than in women (Godoy et al., 2007).\nMale displays of wealth and social status may facilitate mating competition. During\nancestral times, men with greater resource control married younger women, married more\nwomen, and produced offspring earlier (Low, 1998). Males who did not have substantial\nresources or status may have been unable to establish long-term relationships. Across a\nwide variety of societies, male reproductive success is a function of social and economic\nstatus (Hopcroft, 2006). Even in current foraging societies that are relatively egalitarian,\nmen with higher status have more mating opportunities (Chagnon, 1992; Hill and Hurtado,\nSeveral laboratory studies have demonstrated that situational primes making mating\neffort salient can induce male intentions to increase economic power as well as allocate\nfinancial resources to conspicuous products. Roney (2003) found that men reported\nstronger ambition and desire to earn money when in the presence of attractive women. This\neffect was even seen when the men simply viewed photographs of attractive women. In\nanother study, men who were shown photographs of attractive women had intentions to\nallocate more money to conspicuous products, but not inconspicuous products\n(Griskevicius et al., 2007). Neither men who viewed photographs of unattractive women,\nnor women who viewed photographs of attractive or unattractive men exhibited this\npattern. In a third study, men who viewed photographs of attractive women discounted the\nfuture more so when choosing between small monetary rewards than men who viewed\nunattractive women or women who viewed pictures of men (Wilson and Daly, 2004).\nVariability in male financial risk taking\nThe degree of male financial consumption may be related to variance in life history\nstrategy. Males who are relatively higher in mating effort may have a greater tendency to\nmaximize their display of economic power, saving little and even spending beyond their\ncapacity through the use of credit. These men may seek and possibly obtain a greater\nMale financial consumption\nnumber of sexual partners. There are several factors which may be related to both financial\nrisk taking and mating effort in men.\nFirst, both financial risk taking and mating effort may be related to age.\nIndependent of birth cohort effects, men exhibit financial strategies that are increasingly\nmore conservative as they age (Jianakoplos and Bernasek, 2006). In modern societies, male\nresource allocation for mating effort appears to shift towards paternal effort across\nadulthood, as indicated by fertility levels (Tuljapurkar, Puleston, and Gurven, 2007) and\nmortality rates from risky behaviors (Kruger and Nesse, 2004). Male testosterone levels in\nthe U.S. begin to decline in the late third or early fourth decade, and decline at a constant\nrate in later decades (Baker and Hudson, 1983). Male mating effort may peak in young\nadulthood in part because young men may not have partners or offspring to invest in. This\nmay increase their attractiveness to females because they would have more resources\navailable for prospective partners and their potential offspring (Hill and Kaplan, 1999).\nSecondly, entering into a committed relationship by definition implies a shift away\nfrom mating effort and towards investment in the relationship and potential offspring. This\nshift may be reflected in allocation of financial resources. Even among low-income\nhouseholds, married households had higher savings goals and greater frequency and\namounts of savings deposits, compared to unmarried households (Grinstein-Weiss and\nSherraden, 2006). Across ages, men who are unmarried demonstrate riskier behavior than\nthose who are married, as demonstrated by divergence in mortality rates (Kruger and\nNesse, 2006). Yet, marriage may not completely constrain mating effort, as both men and\nwomen may benefit from mixed mating strategies, investing in a stable partnership while\nsimultaneously taking advantage of opportunities for extra-pair relationships (Gangestad\nThird, Socio-Economic Status (SES) may influence both financial strategies and\nrelationship stability. Men and women with higher educational attainment have a reduced\nlikelihood of divorce (e.g., South, 2001). Individuals who develop in relatively uncertain\nenvironments are expected to develop riskier behavioral strategies to take advantage of\ninclude riskier financial strategies. Socio-economic position is related to the degree of risk\nin male behavioral strategies, as indicated by the inverse relationships between male\nmortality rates from external causes with educational attainment and income (Kruger, and\nNesse, 2006). Increases in the uncertainly of economic opportunities also elevated male\nmortality rates from external (behavioral) causes (Kruger, and Nesse, 2007). Those with\nrelatively less financial resources may also find it more difficult to save because of the\ncosts of expenditures for basic needs and non-luxury goods.\nFinancial consumption and mating success\nThe current study is designed to test the hypothesis that the degree of male financial\nconsumption, in terms of the tendency to maximize purchasing rather than accruing\nsavings, is associated with mating effort, as indicated by mating intentions and mating\nsuccess. Caloric models of resource allocation are appropriate for pre-industrial\npopulations, however male resource allocation in modern populations may be best\nmeasured in economic and temporal terms. In many modern societies, one can even\nallocate more resources than one has actually obtained through the use of credit and debt.\nMale financial consumption\nThis increases the potential level of consumption in financial strategies, as debts that are\nnot paid off promptly will accrue interest and increase overall costs.\nThe current analyses will examine the degree of risk in male resource allocation\nwith financial consumption measures appropriate for modern credit based economies.\nAnalyses will account for age, marital status, and educational achievement (as a SES\nindicator). These factors are not posed as alternative explanations, but rather are part of the\ncomplex set of relationships involving life history and behavioral strategies. The\nrelationships of financial consumption with mating intention and mating success are\nexpected to be substantially stronger for men than for women because female mate value is\nmore centrally related to cues of fecundity rather than resource provisioning potential (e.g.,\nMaterials and Methods\nData to test this hypothesis were provided by randomly selected male (M\u00b1SD age =\nincluded in a community health surveillance survey. Data from female respondents were\nanalyzed to provide a comparison with the results for men. The study was originally\ndesigned to provide a broad assessment of community health rather than to examine these\npredictions, so this study includes limitations typical for secondary analyses of data (see\nDiscussion).\nThe sampling plan was designed to compare demographically similar ZIP codes in\nthe cities of Flint and Saginaw, Michigan, and suburban areas surrounding these cities. The\nsampling frame was all adults ages 18-45 whose households were included in non-\ncommercial telephone sampling lists for seven designated ZIP Codes. Four men over age\n45 accidentally included in the sample were excluded in these analyses. Eighteen cases\nwere excluded due to missing data in the variables described below. Computer Aided\nTelephone Interviews (CATIs) were conducted by professional survey interview staff\nmembers at the Michigan Public Health Institute who were unaware of the hypothesis\ntested in this study.\nThree items assessed tendencies for financial conservation versus consumption: I\nalways live within my income range; Each income period, I set aside at least ten percent for\nsavings; I pay off my entire credit card bill each month (Cronbachs alpha = .77). These\nitems were reverse scored to create a scale of financial consumption. Three items adapted\nfrom the Sociosexuality Inventory (SOI; Gangestad and Simpson, 1992) indicated mating\nintentions and mating success. A timeframe was added to these items because part of the\npurpose of the study was to monitor trends across survey waves: With how many different\npartners have you had sexual intercourse within the past five years; How many sexual\npartners would you like to have in the next five years; In the past 12 months, how many\ndifferent partners have you had sex with on one and only one occasion. Data for these items\nwere not reliable as a scale (Cronbachs alpha = .41), so they were analyzed separately.\nResponses to these items were log transformed to guard against the influence of outliers.\nRespondent age was calculated from reported birth date and interview date. Marital\nstatus was assessed with the item, \"What is your current marital status?\" with response\noptions of single, married or partnered, separated, widowed, and divorced. Responses to\nthis item were transformed into binary categories for married or partnered vs. single,\nMale financial consumption\nseparated, widowed, or divorced. Educational attainment was assessed by the item, \"What\nis the highest grade or degree you completed in school?\" and responses were transformed\ninto years of education completed (e.g., High School = 12, Bachelor's degree = 16).\nStepwise linear regressions included age, marital status, years of education\ncompleted, and financial consumption as predictors of each log transformed SOI outcome\nvariable. Separate analyses were conducted for men and women, as the relationships\nbetween financial consumption and mating indicators were expected to be substantially\nweaker for women. Male and female samples were combined to provide a direct test of the\npredicted moderation by sex. Gender (1 = female, 2 = male) and financial consumption\nwere multiplied to create an interaction term predicting each log transformed SOI outcome\nvariable.\nResults\nFor men, older respondents were more likely to be married, have fewer sexual\npartners in the past five years, and have fewer one-time sexual encounters in the past 12\nmonths (see Table 1). Married respondents on average completed more years of education,\nhave fewer sexual partners in the past five years, and have fewer one-time sexual\nencounters in the past 12 months. The degree of financial consumption was directly related\nto the number of sexual partners in the past five years and the number of sexual partners\ndesired in the next five years. The number of sexual partners in the past five years was\ndirectly related to the number of one-time sexual encounters in the past 12 months and the\nnumber of sexual partners desired in the next five years. The zero order correlations\nbetween financial consumption and indicators of mating intention or mating success were\nnot significant for women.\nTable 1. Zero-order correlations and standard deviations among variables for men\nVariable Married Educ. Consumption Past One-night Future M SD\n= yes); Educ. = years of education; Risk = degree of financial risk taking; Past = number of\nsexual partners in the previous five years; One-time = number of sex partners on one and\nonly one occasion in the past 12 months; Future = number of sexual partners desired in the\nnext five years.\nFor men, financial consumption made a significant unique prediction of the number\nof sexual partners in the past five years and the number of sexual partners desired in the\nnext five years (See Table 2). Financial consumption was not uniquely related to the\nnumber of one time sexual partners in men. Age was inversely related to the number of\nMale financial consumption\nsexual partners in past five years, and men who were married had fewer one time sexual\npartners in the past 12 months. For women, financial consumption was not significantly\nrelated to any mating indicator. Women who were older, completed more years of\neducation, and were married had fewer sexual partners in the past five years. Women who\ncompleted more years of education had fewer one time sexual partners. Women who were\nolder and women who were married desired fewer sexual partners in the next five years.\nThe predictions using the interaction term for financial consumption and gender indicated\nthat the relationships between financial consumption and the number of sexual partners in\nthe past five years and the number of sexual partners desired in the next five years were\nsubstantially stronger for men than for women.\nTable 2.

Men who allocated\nmore financial resources to expenditures rather than to savings and were more likely to\nspend more than they earned reported having more sexual partners in the past five years\nand desired a greater number of sexual partners in the next five years. These relationships\nwere significant even when accounting for other possibly influential factors; age, marital\nstatus, and educational achievement.\nThese findings complement the results of typical psychological studies of students\nenrolled in introductory psychology courses. Whereas laboratory studies provide a higher\ndegree of experimental control, the current study is based on reports of actual behaviors in\na representative community sample. The randomly selected sample of men from the\ncommunity are likely to have a wider range in life history strategy than predominantly\nyoung and often relatively affluent university students, and the older average age of\nrespondents allowed for a greater degree of opportunity for the experiences and behaviors\nof interest. Behavioral measures were used for both financial strategy and mating success,\nin addition to measures of behavioral intentions.\nMale financial consumption\nThe results of this study do contrast with previous studies on psychology students,\nin that the laboratory studies demonstrated short-term induction effects from primes of\ndesirable mates on economic intentions. The current study examines relatively stable\nindividual differences in both mating and financial strategies. The laboratory studies\ndemonstrate the relationship between mating salience and financial strategies within\nindividuals, the current study documents a similar relationship across individuals.\nAlthough behaviors related to greater financial consumption predicted the number\nof mating partners in the recent past, it was not related to the number of one-time sexual\nencounters. These items adapted from the Sociosexuality Inventory (SOI) used different\ntime frames. The total number of recent partners was assessed from the past five years,\nwhereas sex partners for one and only one occasion were assessed only in the past 12\nmonths. This temporal difference may partially account for the differences in results,\nalthough one-time sexual encounters may also be qualitatively distinct from other types of\nsexual relationships. Male resource provisioning is more important factor in female mate\nchoice for long-term relationships than for short-term relationships (Gangestad and\nSimpson, 2000; Kruger, Fisher, and Jobling, 2003), so male resource displays may not be\nas influential as physiological Indicators of phenotypic quality.\nThe measures used in this study were quite brief compared to many psychological\nassessments. A more comprehensive assessment of financial strategies and mating effort\ncould potentially consume an entire questionnaire. The data originated from a community\nhealth survey that covered a broad range of issues and was limited in length, given the\nconstraints of telephone interviews with uncompensated respondents. Only three items\nwere used to assess financial risk taking, and mating intentions and success were assessed\nwith only three items from the SOI. Demographic measures utilized single items. Despite\nits brevity, the financial risk taking scale demonstrated high inter-item reliability and\nsignificant predictive power. The data were also collected from one geographic region in a\nsingle state in the USA. Future studies could attempt to replicate the results in additional\npopulations.\nMeasures of educational attainment have previously demonstrated their utility as\nsocioeconomic indicators. Educational attainment was also a significant predictor of\nfinancial strategies in the current study. Given the focus on financial risk taking, it would\nalso have been valuable to assess respondents' income levels. However, this is a sensitive\nissue in the focus communities, which are subject to economic hardships related to trends\nin the American automotive industry. Previous surveys conducted in the same region\nutilizing similar methodologies had refusal rates from 45 to 60% on income items, despite\nattempts to modify items to increase the response rate. Respondents would also\noccasionally terminate the interview when asked about income. Because of the relatively\nlow returns from income items in previous surveys, questions on income level were not\nincluded in the current study. A different survey conducted in the previous year in the same\ncommunity found that educational attainment and household income were related, r(1320)\nOne may argue that sexual behavior and financial risk taking would necessarily be\ncorrelated because of individual differences in generalized sensation seeking and risk\ntaking. However, this would require an explanation of why these individual differences are\nmaintained in populations, which would necessarily involve an explanatory framework\ncompatible with the current understanding of evolution and human behavior. Recent studies\nMale financial consumption\nhave demonstrated that there are distinct domains of risk taking, and distinguished between\nfinancial risks, physical risks, and social risks, for example (Kruger, Wang, and Wilke,\nthese relationships were significant for men but not for women, and resource control is\nmore centrally related to male than to female reproductive strategies. There was even\ngreater statistical power to uncover these relationships for the female sample, as it was\nslightly more than three times the size of the male sample.\nThe promising results of this study may inspire future research on the connection\nbetween life history strategy and financial risk taking. More sophisticated measures could\nassess the proportion of economic resources allocated to visible luxury goods versus\nnecessary staple goods. One could assess the degree of ostentation among various cars,\nclothes, and personal accessories. Longitudinal studies could assess developmental\npathways, and indicate the directions of causality, which cannot be inferred from the cross-\nsectional data in the current model. For example, the data do not reveal whether the greater\neconomic displays enabled by financial consumption were directly responsible for\nenhanced male mating success. Behavioral economics and social psychology have already\nbenefited tremendously from the adoption of evolutionary models. This study suggests\nfurther advances may arise with the integration of life history into research on economic\nbehavior.\n"
