In our study, we monitored arterial properties, body\nconstitution, school success, and motor skills in young adolescents.

PWV, AIx, and central systolic\narterial pressure (SBPao) were measured.\nResults: AIx and SBPao correlated negatively with school performance grades. Extremely high AIx,\nPWVand SBPao values were observed in 5% of children and these children had average to low school\nperformance. PWV correlated significantly with weight, height, and waist and hip circumference. AIx,\nPWV, school success, and BMI correlated strongly with certain motor functions.\nConclusions: Increased AIx and SBPao are associated with lower school and motor performance\nin children.

Obesity affects almost\nall areas of a child's life. Obese children are\nless successful in sport and social activ-\nities.1,2 However, a significant association\nbetween obesity and lower academic school\nperformance has not been reported yet.3\nA clear association between increased arter-\nial stiffness and cognitive decline was found\nin adults individuals.4\u00ad6 Executive cognitive\nfunctions were more disturbed than memory\nfunctions.7 A possible pathophysiological\nmechanism for this cognitive decline may\nbe impaired hemodynamic and microvascu-\nlar function of the brain caused by athero-\nsclerosis.8 An excessive accumulation of fat\nin visceral and other organs severely disturbs\nthe metabolism, leading to metabolic syn-\ndrome and atherosclerosis.9,10 However, ath-\nerosclerosis can also be found in children and\nadults with a normal body constitution.11,12\nEven minimal intima atherosclerotic damage\nchanges the properties of arterial walls.\nIncreased arterial stiffness can be measured\nby pulse wave velocity (PWV), but the aug-\nmentation index (AIx) and SBPao have\nalso been recognised as indicators of arterial\nhealth.13\u00ad14 The aim of our study was to\nfind children with subclinical changes in\narterial function, like atherosclerosis, among\nthe healthy school population. We tested\nwhether underlying changes in arterial prop-\nerties result in lower school and motor per-\nformance in children.\nMaterials and methods\nyears who attended periodic health checks\nwere recruited for our study. Approval was\nreceived from the ethical committee and\nwritten consent was obtained from the par-\nents. We acquired information about family\nhistory and socioeconomic status from a\nshort questionnaire presented to the partici-\npants and their parents. History of obesity,\nhypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, fatal\ncardiovascular disease (CVD) or stroke and\nmalignancy in the first and second line of\nthe family were recorded. The level of par-\nent education and the employment sta-\ntus (employed, unemployed, farmer) was\nalso noted. In addition, the number of\ndaily meals and the number of sweet or\nsalty snacks and fast food meals per week\nwere documented. We measured the height,\nweight, waist and hip circumference (waist,\nhip) of participants in the morning, while\nthey were in a fasting state and wearing light\nunderwear. Height was measured using a\nstadiometer (SECA) to the nearest 1 cm.\nBody mass was recorded to the nearest\n0.1 kg using a calibrated balance (SECA).\nThe waist was measured at the narrowest\npoint between the lower costal border and\nthe iliac crest, to the nearest 1 cm. The hip\nwas measured at the trochanteric region\nwith a classic tape. Body mass index (BMI)\nand standard deviation scores (SDS) BMI\nwere calculated according to the\nManchester SDS BMI calculator. Puberty\nwas checked according to the Tanner\npubertal score. The time of menarche was\nrecorded in girls. The general school per-\nformance grade was provided by the scho-\nlars, and the parents or guardians. The\ngeneral school performance grade is an\naverage of all subject grades obtained in\none school year on a scale of 1\u00ad5, in which\n5 is excellent and 1 is insufficient.\nArterial function assessment\nArterial function was assessed using the\nArteriograph (Tensiomed, Budapest,\nHungary), which is an easy-to-use, non-inva-\nsive occlusive oscillometric device for simul-\ntaneous measurement of arterial pressure\n(AP), AIx, PWV, mean arterial pressure,\ncentral systolic arterial pressure (SBPao), and\nother parameters such as ejection duration. A\nhigh fidelity pressure sensor within an upper-\narm cuff records very small pressure changes\nduring each cardiac cycle. At the beginning of\nsystole, the blood ejected to the arterial system\ngeneratesan early(direct) systolic wave(P1\n). A\nlate systolic pressure wave (P2\n) is likely a result\nof rebounded pressure waves. In the case of\nnormal arterial compliance, the direct P1\nis\nhigher than the reflected P2\n. If the arterial wall\nis stiff, e.g., because of atherosclerosis, a large\npart of the pressure wave is reflected from the\naorta bifurcation and peripheral arteries,\nresulting in a high amplitude P2\n. All data\nreceived by the Arteriograph are wirelessly\ntransmitted to a personal computer and\nanalysed using the device's proprietary soft-\nware. The AIx was calculated from the amp-\nlitude of P1\nand pulse pressure (PP)\nusing the following formula: AIx \u00bc (P2\n)/\nAIx depends on the peripheral resistance\nand PWV and gives complex information\nabout arterial wall properties. The PWV pro-\nvides information about increased arterial\nstiffness and is less influenced by the peripheral\nresistance. PWV is automatically calculated\nfrom the return time,the time intervalbetween\nthe systolic waves (P1\n), and the\ndistance between the throat Jugulum-symphy-\nsis(termin used to describe an even more\nprecise location and is also accepted with\nspecialised literature). and the symphysis.15,16\nCalculation of the PWV from the throat\njugulum\u00adsymphysis distance is not recom-\nmended, and the gold standard approach is\nto measure the carotid\u00adfemoral distance.17\nThe aim of our study was to identify children\nwith altered arterial function from a healthy\npopulation, which seems to be more effective\nwhen having reference values of investigated\nparameters. We used the Arteriograph because\nreference values for PWV, AIx and SBPao\nwere available for our participant age group.18\nMotor skills measurement\nSLOFIT is the national program for measur-\ning the body fitness of school children in\nSlovenia. Every year in April all primary and\nsecondary school children in Slovenia are\ntested by qualified sports teachers according\nto the official measurement protocol.\nThe SLOFIT programme includes eight\nmotor tests and three anthropometric meas-\nurements. We only used the motor test meas-\nurements: arm-plate tapping (APT), which\ntested the speed of alternate movement,\nstanding long jump (SLJ), which tested explo-\nsive strength power, polygon backwards (PB),\nwhich tested the coordination of whole body\nmovements, sit-ups (SU), which tested mus-\ncular endurance of the torso, standing reach\ntouch (SRT), which tested flexibility, bent\narm hang (BAH), which tested muscular\nendurance of the shoulder girdle and arms,\n60-meter run (RUN 60), which tested sprint\ntested general endurance.19\nStatistical analysis\nThe data were analysed with SPSS Statistics\n22.0 software (IBM Inc., Armonk, New\nYork) using the non-parametric Mann-\nWhitney U-Test and the non-parametric\nSpearman correlation after Shapiro-Wilk\ntest of normality. A p value of 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nCharacteristics of the total study population\nare listed in Table 1. Eighty-one children\nwere tested, including 34 girls and 47 boys.\nThere were no significant differences in age,\nbody weight (weight), waist circumference\n(waist), diastolic arterial pressure (AP diast),\nbetween the sexes. Boys were taller than girls\n(p < 0.01) and had a higher systolic arterial\npressure (AP syst) (p < 0.05). There were no\ndifferences in school success and APT\nbetween girls and boys, but boys showed\nsignificantly better results in all other motor\ntests. All girls had already reached puberty\nOn the Tanner scale for sexual maturity,\nfor pubic hair development. Three males\n(6.4 %) had a Tanner scale of grade 1\nNo significant correlation was found\nbetween family burden and CVD, PWV,\nAIx, SBPao, or between school success and\nmotor tests. Parent education level had a\nsignificant positive influence on their child's\nschool success. The employment status of\nthe parents did not influence their children's\nschool success, but the children were signifi-\ncantly less successful at school if their father\nwas a farmer. Eating habits, including the\nconsumption of sweet or salty snacks and\nfast food did not correlate with PWV, AIx,\nSBPao, or any other parameters investigated.\nWe found a statistically negative correlation\nof AIx with body height (p < 0.05). PWV\ncorrelated positively with body weight\nTable 1. Clinical characteristics of the study population according to sex and the whole group.

AIx was signifi-\ncantly associated with school success in boys\n(p < 0.05), but not in girls. In girls, SBPao\nassociated significantly with school success\n(p < 0.05), while PWV did not affect school\nsuccess. Results are listed in Table 2.\nMotor performance was related to AIx,\nPWV, and school success. School success\ncorrelated significantly with APT (p < 0.05)\nand the SRT (p < 0.01).

Structural pathology\nand hemodynamic abnormalities, like cere-\nbral hypoperfusion and impaired cerebral\nvasomotor reactivity, are the main causes of\ncognitive decline in patients with athero-\nsclerosis or other vascular diseases.8\nChildhood obesity and metabolic syn-\ndrome are epidemic in modern society.\nThere is a serious threat that the current\ngeneration of children will die before their\nparents.21 Increased arterial wall thickness22\nand increased PWV23 have been reported in\nobese children, but increased arterial stiffness\nand cognitive function has not been reported\nin healthy young populations. Our results\nshow that altered arterial properties affect\nacademic achievement in children. In addition\nto the effects of AIx and SBPao on school\nsuccess, we found high PWV, AIx, and\nSBPao values in 5% of our study population.\nThis group of children had average to low\nacademic attainment. Based on our findings,\nwe conclude that the vascular origin of cog-\nnitive deficits can be diagnosed early in\nchildhood. This may represent an important\ncontribution to the improvement of health\nand educational care in children. The early\nprethrombotic stages of atherosclerosis can\nbe completely reversed.10 Early diagnosis\nfollowed by effective prevention and treat-\nment may improve cognitive function and\nprevent fatal CVD later in life. In adults with\ncarotid atherosclerosis, cognitive execution\nbut not memory function was impaired.7\nUnfortunately, we did not obtain the grades\nfrom specific subjects and did not test specific\ncognitive functions, therefore we cannot com-\nment whether this is true in children.\nNonetheless, the correlations of school suc-\ncess, AIx, and PWV with SLOFIT motor\ntests in the present study were very interesting.\nChildren with higher school grades tend to\nhave a more flexible body and better coord-\nination of the hands and entire body.\nChildren with high AIx were not as successful\nat school and had slower alternating move-\nment of the hands. In addition, children with\nhigh PWV values had lower explosive\nstrength and general endurance. Based on\nour results, we conclude that subclinical\nvascular changes can affect some motor\nfunctions in children. Arm-plate tapping\nmay be a useful test in screening for early\nvascular abnormalities leading to cognitive\nimpairment, especially because it is not\ninfluenced by obesity.19\nEven though there is strong evidence that\nobesity and metabolic syndrome lead to struc-\ntural brain damage,24 most epidemiologic\nstudies have not found a direct connection\nbetween obesity and school performance.3\nSchool performance was not correlated\nto BMI or other body measures in our\nstudy. Although obesity increases the risk of\natherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome,\nprogress to CVD, while people with normal\nor even low body weight can die of stroke or\nMeasurement of arterial function is a\nmuch more effective than anthropometry at\nuncovering early atherosclerotic changes\nand their consequences, such as cognitive\ndeficits.13,14 Women have a higher risk for\nCVD than men.25 Increased arterial stiffness\nwas found in pre-pubertal girls and post-\nmenopausal women compared with men of\nthe same age.26,27 There are some signs of sex-\nbased differences in academic performance\nand CVD or stroke risk, with a stronger\nassociation in females.28,29 In our study, no\ngender differences were observed in general\nschool performance, but the strong associ-\nation between AIx and school success was\nonly found in boys. On the other hand, SBPao\nwas only related to school success in girls.\nDetailed analyses showed that all the females\nhad already reached puberty. Female sex\nhormones have a strong influence on vascular\ncompliance, which is significantly higher in\npost-pubertal than pre-pubertal girls.26 This\nmeans that discovering of altered arterial\nproperties are more effective in pre-pubertal\nor post-menopausal women. SBPao appears\nto be a more sensitive parameter than AIx for\nidentifying arterial pathologies in women who\nhave already reached menarche.\nPWV was not correlated to school suc-\ncess; smoothed percentile curves showed a\nslight increase (about 1 m/s) between 3\u00ad18\nyears of age.18 In our study, PWV correlated\nsignificantly with body height, weight, waist,\nand hip measurements. The interpretation\nof PWV as a sign of vascular pathology\nin children is probably more complex.\nThe body's constitution appears to affect\nPWV values. However, the extremely high\nAIx, PWV, and SBPao values we found in\n5% of our study population indicates a\nvascular pathology that should be investi-\ngated further.\nConclusions\nOur study has shown that altered arterial\nproperties may cause cognitive and motor\nimpairment in young adolescents and that\nPWV is influenced by body constitution.\nStrengths and limitations\nThe present study investigated general\nschool performance and no other specific\ncognitive measures. Insight into grades for\ndifferent subjects would give us a better\ninsight into specific cognitive deficits.\nFor the interpretation of increased arterial\nstiffness, the pre-pubertal period in girls\nwould be a better choice. Unfortunately,\nschool success is evaluated with grades from\nthe age of 8\u00ad10 years in Slovenia. In healthy\ngirls, puberty normally starts at around 8\u00ad12\nyears of age,30 therefore it was impossible to\ncheck school success in pre-pubertal scholars.\nThe PWV in our study did not correlate\nwith school success, although values far\nabove the published average were found in\n5% of children with average to low school\nperformance. PWV measured with the\nArteriograph measures stiffness of the bra-\nchial artery and not the aorta.31 Calculating\nthe PWV from the carotid\u00adfemoral distance\nmay have given different results.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of\ninterest with respect to the research, authorship,\nand/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of\nthis article.\nReferences\n1.
