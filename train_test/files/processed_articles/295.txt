This renewed focus is in no small measure due to aging of the\nworld population and related increases in family, clinical, and social burdens from\npatients with dementia. Epidemiology and other public health research approaches\nhave incorporated clinical and basic neuroscience into population-based research\nto begin to delineate the natural history of these syndromes and identify risk fac-\ntors for dementia development. Identification of preventable or modifiable factors\nthat influence the risk of dementia may lead to evaluation of preventive interven-\ntions. An estimated 4 million people in the United States are believed to suffer\nfrom Alzheimer's disease (AD) alone; if those with vascular dementia and other\ncommon dementias were included, the numbers might double (31). The World\nHealth Organization (WHO) estimates there are 18 million people with dementia\nin Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America and predicts there will be nearly 29\nDementia is not one biological condition, but rather is a syndrome defined by\nmeasurable cognitive decline to the point where physical, social, and intellectual\nfunctions are clearly impaired. Specific criteria for the diagnosis of the demen-\ntia syndrome and its components are available from several sources (84, 129).\nOver 200 types of dementia have been described, most of which are very uncom-\nmon, with some related to known genetic abnormalities. The heterogeneity of this\nsyndrome makes estimating its impact more complex.\nPopulation-based clinical and basic research all contribute to the identification\nof modifiable risk factors and the development of effective interventions. Clinical\ntreatments or rehabilitative interventions that retard or halt the progression of this\nchronic illness or result in regression of disease have the potential to be applied as\npreventive interventions. In this review, we emphasize identification of modifiable\nenvironmental risk factors. Treatments focused on proximal features of dementia\nare likely to be part of the pathology of the disease and less appropriate for a review\nof disease prevention.\nCosts of Care and Treatments\nTreating and managing dementia patients include direct medical care costs for\nacute care hospitals and long-term care. Some authors have recently projected an\nRice and colleagues estimated that formal care costs for dementia in the United\nStates averaged $27,672 per patient per year. Of these costs, long-term care is the\nmost expensive component and is primarily paid out of pocket by the patients'\nfamily. Indirect costs such as lost wages and productivity averaged $10,400 to\n$34,517 per patient per year, influenced by patient severity, and length of sur-\nvival with disease. Patients with AD are more likely to live in nursing homes\n(124) than other elderly individuals. Since most drugs currently available for AD\ntreatment have modest effects at best, these treatments do not substantially im-\npact progression of the disease in the overall population. Other treatments such\nas statins are in the early stages of evaluation as preventive treatments for AD.\nTreatments that prevent comorbid diseases, such as stroke or type 2 diabetes, may\naffect the rate of AD development or progression, and may be more cost-effective\nas preventive agents than current therapies. However all forms of primary and\nsecondary prevention as well as tertiary treatments need to be explored more\nfully.\nThe Population Burden of Dementia\nPREVALENCE The prevalence of major dementias, both AD and vascular dementia,\nthe prevalence of dementia in European studies of people aged 65 and older has\nranged between 5% and 10% and doubles every 4 years to reach 30% at age\nTABLE 1 Incidence of dementia in population-based studies\nIncidence per\nStudy Study design Population years\nNorth-American Studies\nelderly, U.S.\nEuropean Studies\nAfrican, Asian-Indian, Chinese, and Japanese Studies\nEpidemiology study (20) Rural elderly\nw = women, m = men.\n80 (113). Most European studies suggest a higher risk of dementia in women.\nDementiaprevalenceisconsistentlylowerinmostdevelopingcountries.InNigeria,\nprevalence of dementia in those aged 65+ was slightly over 2% (59); in Ballabgarh,\nIndia less than 2% (47); and in Shanghai about 5% (149). Nearly all population-\nbased studies report an increase in both prevalence and incidence of dementia with\nincreasing age.\nINCIDENCE In developed countries, dementia incidence is about 1% per year in\nthose aged 65 and older (113). Incidence varies across race/ethnic groups and\nwithin race/ethnic groups in different geographic regions. At the time of this re-\nview, very few incidence studies have been conducted in developing countries.\nThese include only India (47), Africa (58), and China (149). There has been some\npublished research on dementia in South America and Mexico (64); however,\nthey are not population-based cohort studies that can reliably provide estimates\nof dementia incidence. One barrier, among many, to doing dementia research in\ndeveloping countries or across cultural groups is the lack of relatively unbiased\nscreening and assessment instruments that are feasible for use in settings with\nminimal resources and populations with low literacy levels. A methodology for\nascertaining dementia in developing countries, which may make such research\nA consistent pattern emerges from comparison of dementia incidence rates\nacross populations: Rates appear to be lower in developing countries compared to\ndevelopedcountries.ThemajorityofallincidencestudieshavebeendoneinEurope\nand in the United States in populations of European ancestry. The single published\nstudy in Japan reported incidence rates similar to those found in the United States\namong those of European ancestry (46). Even among developed countries, there\nis considerable variation. For example, incidence in some European countries (4,\n6) is lower than in the United States. Some authors have postulated the existence\nof a European north-south gradient in dementia risks, with the highest incidence\noccurring in northern European countries and the lowest in southern European\ncountries (3). If this gradient exists, it may be owing to variations in exposure to\nlifestyle factors, such as diet, or to lower frequency of APO e4 or other dementia-\nrelated genotypes present in southern European populations.\nComparisons of immigrants to those remaining behind in the mother country\nare useful for distinguishing the effects of environmental exposures from genetic\nvulnerability. However, there are few studies comparing dementia in immigrants\nto genetically similar groups in their country of origin. Hendrie has reported inci-\ndence rates in African Americans 2.4 times higher than in Africans from Nigeria\n(58). An earlier report (141) suggested that dementia prevalence in Japanese men\nliving in Hawaii might be higher compared to Japanese men living in Japan; there\nare differences in diagnostic approaches between the two countries that may con-\nfound this finding. Meguro and colleagues (87) reported a similar prevalence of\nsenile dementia in Japanese men living in S~\nao Paulo, Brazil compared to those liv-\ning in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. Cross-national comparison studies are by nature\ncomplicated by differences in diagnostic methodology and cross-cultural biases\nin assessment tools. However, they capture differences in environmental and ge-\nnetic vulnerabilities that can be explored further to identify new approaches to\npreventing dementia. The lower rates reported in developing countries may point\nto selective survival differences related to competing risks or to higher exposure\nto dementia risk factors in the developed countries.\nINCIDENCE OF SUBTYPES The major subtypes of dementia are Alzheimer's\ndementia and vascular dementia. Diagnostic classification of vascular dementia\nremains controversial and is evolving. Vascular causes of dementia are widely\nregarded as modifiable through prevention and reduction of risk factors and may\noffer the most significant hope at this time for primary prevention of dementia.\nDementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) may be a separate syndrome from AD, but\nthe diagnostic classification of DLB is still evolving.\nNearly all studies of dementia that have, to date, addressed incidence of sub-\ntypes are in the United States, European countries, Japan, and China. In a cross-\nnational European study of dementia in 7 countries, Alzheimer's accounted for\nabout 70% of all dementia, followed by 15% for vascular dementia. A report from\nthe Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA) reported AD incidence rates of\nLobo (83) and colleagues have reported some variation in the proportion of all de-\nmentias attributable to vascular dementia compared to Alzheimer's. Finland and\nPamplona had the highest proportion attributable to other dementias, and Sweden\nhad the highest attributable to Alzheimer's. Reports from Japan (46, 63, 145)\nsuggest that vascular dementia accounts for a higher proportion of total demen-\ntia cases in that country: Estimates of the proportion of dementias classifiable as\nacross population groups, such as global regions, ethnicities, and genders, can\nbe broadly indicative of differences in genetic predisposition and environmental\nexposures that may influence risk or progression of disease. Further, detection of\ndisease may be affected by socioeconomic circumstances or cultural views and\npractices. Certainly, differences in the occurrence of dementia in developing and\ndeveloped countries or between disadvantaged and advantaged populations (for\nexample, African Americans versus European Americans) are necessarily subject\nto influence by differential selective survival related to disadvantage. Some work\n(91) has suggested that dementia incidence declines in very old ages. These views\nhave not yet been adequately evaluated in light of competing risks from earlier\ncardiovascular mortality or other causes of premature death in populations.\nAscertainment of Dementia for Estimating\nPopulation Burdens\nStudies that are based on community health care diagnosis of dementia may find\ninconsistent results owing to the variability in extent of patient evaluation and\ndiagnostic rigor by the health care system. Dementia is often not diagnosed or\nnot treated in typical community health care settings (43). Even when dementia is\nevaluated in the health care setting, verification of subtype by neuroimaging is often\nabsent and a differential diagnosis of dementia is incomplete. Dementia is chal-\nlenging to diagnose in older populations, and inter-rater discordance in dementia\nand AD diagnosis has been documented (61). Some older persons remain incom-\npletely diagnosed because of lack of access to medical care, residence in long-term\ncare institutional settings, decisions made by caregivers or others responsible for\ndementia patients that prevent a full evaluation, or by the confounding effects of\nsubstantial comorbidity.\nMild cognitive impairment (MCI), a possible early precursor of dementia, is\nvariously defined as the absence of dementia meeting Diagnostic Standards Man-\nual IV criteria with the presence of subjective memory complaints, normal general\ncognitive functioning, objective memory impairment, and autonomy in activities\nof daily living (53, 77). There are conflicting reports on how strongly current def-\ninitions of MCI predict the development of dementia. However, work that can\nsuccessfully define early predictors of dementia will be of importance for pre-\nventing the progression to later, less treatable phases. Despite these limitations,\nimportant and potential risk factors for dementia onset have been identified.\nPrevention of Dementia\nPrevention may be thought of in three nonexclusive stages: primary, secondary,\nand tertiary. Primary prevention generally refers to the prevention of disease be-\nfore its biological onset or to prevention of risk factors for disease (sometimes\ncalled primordial prevention). Secondary prevention refers to the early detection\nof asymptomatic disease, usually through screening that leads to early treatment.\nExcept for people at high risk for dementia, such as those with certain genotypes\nor high levels of identified environmental exposures, it is very difficult to precisely\nidentify asymptomatic individuals who are likely to acquire dementia at some\npoint in the future. A role for early dementia screening in primary care has been\nproposed. However, a recent report from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\nsuggests there is insufficient evidence to support instituting such a universal screen-\ning policy (138). Tertiary prevention generally refers to interventions that retard\nprogression of or rehabilitate overt clinical disease. In addition to existing drug\ntreatments for dementia that modestly retard progression of dementia, tertiary pre-\nventive approaches may include behavioral or rehabilitative patient interventions\nand improvement in the quality of supportive care in the community or the institu-\ntional setting for the patient, the family, and other informal caregivers. A previous\nreview in the Annual Review of Public Health (104) addresses existing evidence\nfrom observational studies on a set of potential lifestyle risk factors for Alzheimer's\ndisease that pointed the way toward potential interventions. The present review\naddresses population burdens of the major forms of dementia; variability in risk\nassociated with environmental exposures, lifestyle and behaviors, race/ethnicity,\nand genetic contributions; and existing evidence on clinical trials and interventions\nthat have the potential for directly preventing or treating dementias.\nGenetics and Dementia in a Population-Based Context\nFew candidate genes have so far been firmly identified in connection with\nAlzheimer's disease. The most established of these is the APOE lipoprotein geno-\ntype. The e4 allele of this genotype is associated with increased risk of both AD\nand vascular dementia. Homozygosity for e4 is usually more strongly associated\nwith both dementia and coronary artery disease than heterozygotic combinations\nwith only one e4 allele. The contribution of APOE to dementia risk varies by age,\ngender, and ethnicity or ancestral background. APOE may account for up to 40%\nof the genetic risk for sporadic late-onset AD (50). However, the fraction of AD\ncases that are attributable to APOE e4 is estimated at about 5% (69) in Mexican\nAmericans, whereas in Americans of European ancestry Evans has estimated that\nAD incidence would be reduced by 13% if the APOE e4 allele did not exist. Slooter\nhas estimated a 20% reduction in dementia (40, 125) with the elimination of e4 in\nDutch studies.\nPresenilin (PS1 and PS2) genes are also accepted as contributors to early onset\nAD, but these are probably far less common in populations than APOE e4 and\nfar fewer cases are attributable to these genes (80, 143). Other genetic factors that\nmay be related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, hypertension,\nstroke, or type-2 diabetes have implications for the risk of vascular dementia,\nprobably for AD, and might interact with APOE to influence the risk of dementia.\nEARLY EFFECTS OF APOE A number of reports have demonstrated higher LDL\nfrom the Bogalusa Heart Study (128) has reported that presence of the APOE e4\nincreased LDL more over a 15-year follow up compared to e3; further, those with\ne2 were more responsive to lifestyle changes such as obesity or dietary fat intake.\nTaken together, these findings support the notion that APOE e4 could increase\ncoronary heart or artery disease risks from birth onward. Whether this also holds\ntrue for cognitive outcomes is not known. In fact, little has been done to examine\neffects of APOE e4 on changes in cognitive status from youth to older adulthood;\nthe Scottish Mental Survey of 1932 (27) was able to report that APOE e4 predicted\nchange in cognitive ability from age 11 to age 80 but did not influence ability at\nage 11. It is likely that APOE e4 is associated with cumulative exposure over time\nto elevated LDL, amyloid deposition, and oxidative processes that affect vascular\ndisease and subsequent dementia risk later in life, rather than manifesting more\nimmediate, direct effects on cognition in childhood. Most research supports the\nnotion that those homozygous for the e4 allele experience greater loss of hippocam-\npal volume, changes in brain metabolism, and increased risk for cognitive decline\nand dementia. The various APOE allele combinations are associated with varying\nrates of atherogenesis, such that the risk of dementia and cognitive impairment\nis significantly higher among those with the ApoE e4 allele and higher levels of\nCROSS-POPULATION STUDIES OF e4 The e4 allele of the APOE gene has been\nlinked to an increased risk of both AD and vascular dementia in a variety of pop-\nulations. There is considerable variability in the allele distribution of the APOE\ngenotype by race, ethnicity, and nationality. Available studies are limited in two\nmajor ways: (a) Data on APOE allele frequencies, often taken from small, clinical\nsamples, can be biased by the high prevalence of demented subjects, the older age\nof these subjects, and the lack of representativeness of these samples and matched\ncontrols for general populations; (b) understanding of racial and ethnic diversity\nin the effects of APOE on dementia is hindered by inappropriate classifications\nof ethnic groups. For example, classification as \"Hispanic\" of people of Mexican,\nCaribbean, Central-American, and South-American ancestry mixes together\ngroups that are diverse from a historic, cultural, and genetic point of view. Sim-\nilar issues pertain to Asians and other ethnic groups. A 1997 review by Farrer\n(50) summarized the risk of AD associated with heterozygosity and homozygos-\nity for the APOE e4 allele; a higher risk of AD was consistently present across\nall ethnic groups associated with homozygosity for e4; heterozygosity was also\nassociated with an increased risk of AD with the exception of African Americans,\nwhere e4 heterozygosity was not associated with an increased risk of AD. More\nrecent work (33, 34) has suggested that certain APOD lipoprotein polymorphisms\n[APOD is a high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-associated glycoprotein] may mod-\nify the association between APOE e4 and AD. Desai's (33) work suggests that\nthe risk of AD associated with APOE e4 positivity was higher in those with the\nAPOD polymorphism Intron 12 allele; this allele combination was also higher\nin those with AD compared to control subjects. A few laboratory and pathology\nstudies have implicated APOD polymorphisms in neurodegenerative and neurore-\ngenerative processes (66, 131). This polymorphism may only occur in individuals\nof African ancestry compared to individuals of European ancestry in the United\nStates (34); however, no other studies have reported population-level distributions\nof APOD in non-European ancestry samples.\nGENETICS AND PREVENTION OF DEMENTIA Primary and secondary prevention of\ndementia related to genetic factors logically focuses on modifying environmental\nand lifestyle exposures that influence risk by interacting with genetic vulnerability.\nBecause none of the known genetic risk factors for dementia is determinative,\nscreening to identify high-risk cases may not be feasible, effective, or desirable,\nand universal screening is even less so.\nLipids are likely to be an important pathway in amyloid beta-protein deposition,\ntau phosphorylation, and disruption of synaptic plasticity and neurodegenerative\nmented, interventions that prevent exposure to dietary fat or other factors that are\nknown to increase LDL, or those that may reduce LDL through treatments (i.e.,\nstatins), may be effective in reducing dementia risk. The effectiveness of dietary\nmodifications or treatment with drugs that lower LDL has been evaluated in a few\nstudies involving children and adults (19, 140). Work by Pedro-Botet (99) and by\nCampos (19) have demonstrated that those with APOE e2 may be more responsive\nto lipid-lowering interventions compared to those who are e4+. Other work (56,\n144) has provided some evidence that APOE e4 modifies the effects of hormone\ntreatments on lipids such that e4+ individuals are less responsive to treatment. The\ncontribution of genetic variation to disease differences between populations may\nbe relatively small if a recent report by Rosenberg is supported (117). This report\nhas suggested that \"within-population differences among individuals account for\n93% to 95% of genetic variation\" and between-population differences account for\nEarly Versus Late Exposure\nA growing body of evidence points to early life exposures to factors in the child-\nhood socioeconomic environment, such as education, parental occupation, age at\nmenarche, and early nutritional intake, that may affect the risk of dementia in\nold age. The reserve hypothesis (49) represents the notion that early exposures in\nutero and in childhood affect brain size, synaptic plasticity, and dendritic density.\nAlthough this has been demonstrated in nonhuman primates and in rodents, depri-\nvation in humans in early life is correlated frequently with adverse exposures in\nadult life, such as occupational toxins and lifelong poverty. Disentangling the con-\ntributions of early exposures versus later exposures and their relative consequences\nfor dementia risk is difficult to accomplish in nearly all population-based studies.\nMoceri (92), for example, has provided evidence that a disadvantaged childhood\nenvironment characterized by area of residence in childhood and parental status\nis associated with a higher risk of AD. Similar work by Kim (71) and Hall (52)\nhas linked markers of early inadequate nutrition (e.g., as suggested by shorter\nlimb length) and rural residence with a higher risk of dementia. De Ronchi (32)\nreported a nearly fivefold increase in dementia risk associated with low education.\nFarmer (42) has also reported an inverse association between cognitive change\nand education in the Epidemiologic Catchment Area CA study. In a study of older\nMexican-American women, Haan reported an inverse association between educa-\ntion and dementia risk (69) and a higher risk of cognitive impairment in women\nwho reported a late menarche, an indicator of early nutritional deprivation.\ndence is emerging at the molecular, physiologic, clinical, and social levels that\nvascular disease and risk factors play important etiologic roles in both vascular de-\nmentia and Alzheimer's dementia. De la Torre (28, 29) has reviewed this evidence\nextensively, pointing out eight evidentiary themes at the population, clinical, and\nmolecular levels that support the role of vascular processes in dementia. The role\nplayed by ApoE and potentially other genetically driven lipoproteins also supports\nthis notion. Further, there is evidence linking traditional vascular risk factors such\ndiabetes (14) to both vascular and Alzheimer's dementia. Inflammatory factors\nsuch as homocysteine (13, 14) and c-reactive protein (120) are being investigated;\na growing body of evidence supports the notion that oxidative stress (44) is im-\nplicated in dementia. Clinical trials using anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid-lowering\ndrugs such as statins (24), and antidiabetic drugs (2) are underway. However, a\nrecent clinical trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (3) did not\nshow any benefit as a tertiary preventive treatment for progression in AD patients.\nChemical and Physical Environmental Exposures\nand Dementia\nSeveral types of environmental exposures have been explored as possible causes of\ndementia and AD in particular. Some work has been done to explore the relation of\nneurodegenerative diseases and cognitive function and prior pesticide exposure. In\na study in three regions of Quebec, Canada, the relative risk of developing AD was\n2.4 for men in occupations with pesticide exposure (7, 48). Clearly, more work is\nneeded with better exposure information to establish such associations and explore\nthe preventability of these exposures.\nBrain accumulation of aluminum in cases of dialysis-associated dementia was\ndemonstrated, raising the issue of whether aluminum exposure was associated\nwith the incidence of primary AD. However, this notion has not been proven (18),\nand there have not been any recently published investigations on this issue. Brains\nfrom AD patients have been reported to have abnormal accumulation of iron in\nsenile plaques, and some but not all studies have suggested that iron may mediate\nthe in vitro neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta peptide (12). Iron may play a role in the\naggregation of tau protein, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (146).\nLead, like iron, has been implicated in the genesis of neurofibrillary tangles (54).\nZinc has been postulated to have both pathogenic and protective roles in AD (26).\nThe role(s) of elemental metals or their complexes in AD and dementia seems to\nbe worthy of pursuit and may lead to treatments for dementia with metal-binding\nagents (17). Potential interventions to reduce or eliminate these exposures have no\nsubstantial basis yet for preventing neurodegenerative diseases.\nHEAD TRAUMA There have been reports of an increased density in A plaque in\nthe brains of individuals who died of head trauma, but Adle-Biassette (1) found that\nthere was no difference in density of A deposits between cases of head trauma\nand controls. A case-controlled study showed that a history of head trauma was\nsignificant for both AD and non-AD dementias, but the effect was limited to males\n(119). Several epidemiologic studies have reported increased risk of dementia\nin individuals with head trauma (103, 145). The Multi-Institutional Research in\nAlzheimer's Genetic Epidemiology (MIRAGE) project showed that the risk of\nAD was elevated with a history of head trauma when compared to family and\nspouse controls, and there was a smaller elevation in risk for those carrying APOE4\nalleles (50). However, the Canadian Study on Health and Aging and the Rotterdam\nStudy showed no change in dementia risk for those with a history of head trauma\nALCOHOL The relationship between alcohol consumption and dementia is com-\nplex, mediated by dose and type of alcohol. High levels of alcohol intake, usually\nassociated with clinical problem drinking and alcoholism, can lead to cognitive\ndecline, but the neuropathological findings in alcoholic dementia are distinct from\nAlzheimer'sdisease.Alcohol-associatedcognitiveimpairmentmaybeconfounded\nby other factors in these patients, such as smoking, dietary deficiencies of vitamins\nand antioxidants, or head trauma.\nModerate alcohol consumption may be protective (37, 62). For example, the\nRotterdam Study (118) and the Cardiovascular Health Study (96) showed light-to-\nmoderate alcohol consumption as significantly protective for all dementia (hazard\nwine consumption, but not other alcohol types, reduced the risk of dementia (134).\nDementia was more common in older alcohol abusers in the Canadian Study of\nHealth and Aging for all diagnosed types except probable AD (132). In a Japanese\nstudy of vascular dementia, alcohol consumption was a significant risk factor for\nvascular dementia but not AD (46).\nNeurologic effects of alcohol on the brain may be modified by genetic cofactors.\nThe Epidemiology of Vascular Aging study showed that the association between\nalcohol consumption and cognitive decline was modified by APOE e4 genotype\n(36). Noncarriers of APOE4 who drank were at decreased risk of cognitive de-\nterioration, whereas carriers of APOE4 who drank were at increased risk. The\nCardiovascular Health Study showed that the risk associated with very high alco-\nhol consumption was more pronounced among those with APOE e4 (96). Although\na growing body of epidemiological data from observational studies suggests that\nmoderate alcohol consumption is associated with protection from dementia, ab-\nstainers may include individuals too ill to consume alcohol or those with a family\nhistory of alcoholism.\nDIETARY FACTORS Nutritional factors have been investigated as potential mod-\nifiable risk factors for dementia. Much of this work focuses on lipids, oxida-\ntion, and inflammation. Modifiable exposures in these realms include dietary fat,\nantioxidants, and folate-vitamin B12-homocysteine metabolism. A number of\nstudies have reported that high intakes of total fat, saturated fat, and total choles-\nmay be protective for incident dementia and AD, with relative risks of 0.4 (95%\nfat and omega-6 fatty acid intake decreased the risk of AD, whereas saturated or\ntransunsaturated fats increased the risk.\nOne study of dietary antioxidant vitamins C and E showed that plasma levels\nof vitamin C were lower in AD patients with poorer cognitive function despite\nsimilar dietary intake (114). At least two studies (41, 94) have reported that those\nwith high levels of dietary vitamin C and E are at decreased risk of dementia (37).\nThe Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project found no association\nbetween vitamins C and E or the carotenes in the development of AD (86). A case-\ncontrol study of patients with AD found that patients with AD had a lower level\nof beta-carotene and vitamin A but not alpha-carotene when compared to controls\n(65). Studies of nutritional factors in AD patients are generally confounded by\nchanges in eating habits and weight common in AD patients. Several studies in\nhumans have reported an inverse association between homocysteine and cogni-\nincreasing interest in dementia research for this reason.\nEXERCISE Although it is clear that physical exercise offers health benefits for\nolder people, evidence supporting a specific effect of exercise for prevention of\ndementia is still under investigation. Mechanistically, exercise has been suggested\nto enhance brain neurotrophic factors (11) and modify apoptosis (101). Exercise\nmay benefit dementia by preserving muscle mass, preventing falls, and consequent\nhead trauma. Evidence that exercise can preserve optimal cardiovascular function,\ndeter stroke and microvascular disease, and improve regional cerebral blood flow\nhas been offered (23, 73). Given the substantial and diverse effects of exercise\non biological functions, the potential role of exercise for prevention of dementia\nshould receive further attention.\nSMOKING Cigarette smoking has been reported to both promote and deter de-\nmentia occurrence. For example, there is a selective loss of 4 subtype of nicotinic\nreceptors in the brains of AD patients, and this loss is related to the presence\nand density of amyloid-1-42 plaques (12). The degree of reduction in nicotinic\nreceptor binding is also related to the severity of dementia (12, 21, 102). Nico-\ntine has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis of neurons (60), and the idea of\nsmoking cessation as an intervention to prevent subcortical vascular dementia has\nbeen suggested (116). Even if smoking has a protective effect on AD, it could be\ncompletely or partially offset by an increased risk of vascular dementia (16, 98).\nSmokers may have decreased perfusion to both cortical and subcortical regions of\nthe brain, as well as acceleration of cerebral atrophy and ventricular enlargement\n(88). Reported associations between cigarette smoking and AD have been varied\n(15, 60). A study of a cohort of British male doctors showed no significant change\nin risk for dementia according to smoking status (35). A comparison of three\nCanadian datasets showed inconsistent positive, negative, and neutral findings for\nsmoking and AD (136). Subsequent analysis of these data showed a significant\ninteraction between smoking status and alcohol consumption on the risk of AD\nin two of the datasets, with the risk of smoking and drinking together having a\nsmaller increase in risk than either maineffect alone (135).Others (60) havefound a\nprotective effect of smoking on AD, limited to males and greater among those with\na positive family history. A meta-analysis (5) of 21 case-control studies showed a\nassociated with cigarette smoking in four cohort studies, although the estimate\nthat described the number of smokers at baseline who later developed AD (5).\nAs for other exposures (98), Apolipoprotein E genotype may modify the smoking\neffect on dementia and AD, such that those who are e4 positive are not affected\nby smoking with respect to AD risk. Four European prospective studies found that\namong those with a family history of dementia, there was no association between\nsmoking and dementia, whereas those without a family history of dementia had a\nRR of 2.28 (78). APOE4 carriers have fewer nicotinic receptors, and nicotine may\nhelp increase the density of the receptors or assist in the release of neurotrans-\nmitters. It is likely that survivor bias due to early smoking-related mortality may\naffect study outcomes by removing smokers from the population before they can\ndevelop later-stage dementia.\nInterventions and Treatments for Primary and Secondary\nPrevention of Dementia\nAt present, drug treatments for slowing or halting the progression of dementia\nare few and have limited effectiveness. Recent efforts to identify treatments that\nmight be efficacious for primary or secondary prevention have included NSAIDS,\nstatins, and antihypertensive medication.\nNSAIDS Several observational studies have reported an inverse association be-\ntween the use of NSAIDS and the risk of dementia (70, 112). The operative mech-\nanism may be the anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDS. Cache County study\ndata (148) suggested that long-term NSAID use reduced the incidence of AD.\nHowever, a recent clinical trial of NSAIDS (3) in AD patients did not find a benefit\nfor progression. The reduction in AD risk associated with use of NSAIDs may\nrepresent a role for primary prevention related to NSAIDS rather than treatment.\nANTIHYPERTENSIVE TREATMENT A positive association between systolic blood\npressure and dementia has been reported in a number of epidemiologic studies.\nSimilarly, stroke appears as a comorbidity or an etiologic factor for both vascular\nand AD in at least 10 studies. This has given rise to the reasonable notion that\nhypertension treatment may reduce the risk of dementia. Despite this potential,\nonly two randomized clinical trials have been attempted that directly address this\nquestion. The Syst-Eur randomized clinical trial (45), designed to examine primary\nprevention of stroke as an outcome of antihypertensive drug treatment, reported\na 53% reduction in vascular or mixed dementia and a 60% reduction in AD. The\nPROGRESS (137) clinical trial of prevention of recurrent stroke by treatment with\nantihypertensive medications reported a 34% reduction in a composite measure of\ncognitive impairment and dementia. Whether antihypertension treatment affects\ndementia by reducing A deposition or other hallmarks of AD is not known. Now\nunderway, the European SCOPE trial (n = 5000) (133) will examine the effects of\ntreatment with an antihypertensive medicine (candesartan cilexetil) versus placebo\non dementia outcomes.\nHORMONE THERAPY Accumulated evidence suggested that exogenous estrogen\ntherapy in postmenopausal women may be associated with increased risk of de-\nmentia (61). Despite varying methods and different types of estrogen therapy, with\nand without added progestational agents, most observational studies with a sig-\nnificant result showed protection associated with hormone replacement therapy\n(HRT). Unopposed estrogen was reported to have greater benefits for dementia\nthan opposed treatments. However, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a large,\nrandomized clinical primary prevention trial of conjugated equine estrogens and\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (Prempro\u00ae), found that dementia was twice as fre-\nquent in the active treatment arm compared to the placebo arm; there was no\nsignificant difference in the occurrence of cognitive impairment without dementia\n(108, 123). Both vascular dementia and AD were more common in the treatment\ngroup. The WHI HRT study was not able to evaluate the effects of HRT on de-\nmentia subtypes owing to small numbers of AD cases. The WHI trial has also\nconfirmed Prempro\u00ae as a cause of stroke (105); it is possible that the increased risk\nof all-cause dementia is related to the thromboembolic properties of HRT, which\nmay overwhelm any neuroprotective effects. A three-year clinical trial (97) failed\nto provide any evidence for Prempro\u00ae as an effective treatment for Alzheimer's\ndementia in hysterectomized women with AD.\nSTATINS Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), in\naddition to impeding large-vessel atherosclerosis and its consequences, have sev-\neral metabolic effects on the brain that may be related to AD pathogenesis (72).\nSome epidemiological studies have shown a negative association between statin\nuse and AD risk, and several mechanisms have been postulated (24, 115). Investi-\ngators in one epidemiological study searched for indication bias for treatment for\ncardiovascular disease as an explanation for association but failed to find it (115).\nA Cochrane review published in 2001 concluded that the evidence for a causal\nassociation was not yet present (121) but that this should be a high priority for\nfuture research. It seems likely that trials in the treatment of clinical AD and other\ndementias will appear in the next few years.\nlation-based, observational study (139) has reported a reduced risk of AD (OR =\n0.41) associated with vaccination for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, or influenza. Re-\ncent work done at Elan Pharmaceuticals (8) using a transgenic mouse model\nfor AD reported that antibodies against amyloid -peptide (A) injected\nintraperitoneally cleared plaques and stopped peptide degradation. A subsequent\nsmall trial in humans with AD provided evidence that this treatment increased\ninflammatory response in the brain and elevated neurotoxicity. Recent work by\nNath and colleagues (57) has found that AD patients have a higher immune (anti-\nbody) response to aggregated A compared to soluble A. However, aggregated\nA may be less neurotoxic than the soluble form. It is not yet clear whether the\nimmune response observed in AD patients is secondary to the development of\ndisease or is a proximal cause. It is likely that inflammatory and oxidative factors\nrelated to this response are involved in AD and probably in vascular dementia as\nwell. The single observational study may have been biased by residual confound-\ning related to the likelihood that older persons who routinely seek vaccinations\ndiffer by socioeconomic status and health behaviors from those who do not. The\ngeneral issue of infection and immunity in dementia has not been well explored\nas yet.\ntent pattern of results from recent trials of the above treatment interventions in AD\npatients has failed to show significant benefits (and in some cases shows harm).\nThese discouraging oucomes may be, in part, due to the advanced stage of demen-\ntia of study participants. Brain imaging studies show that most advanced dementia\npatients have brain and hippocampal atrophy and white matter hyperintensities;\nmost also have the hallmark pathologies of AD, that is, plaques and tangles. There\nare no studies at present that have addressed the reversibility of brain atrophy or\nwhite matter hyperintensities in response to any intervention, partly owing to the\ncurrent logistical, technical, and cost limitations of serial imaging studies.\nAt one time, it was common to think of dementia as an inevitable outcome of\naging; it is now clearer that dementia is the result of a set of underlying patholog-\nical processes at least some of which may be preventable or modifiable. Certain\nforms of cognitive decline, such as memory loss, are considered to be predictive\nof specific dementias, especially Alzheimer's. Despite this improved recognition,\nwe do not yet have approaches to early screening that can predict future dementia\nwith certainty or can differentiate the future risk of one dementia subtype from\nanother. Some of this is due to uncertainty about the etiology of Alzheimer's de-\nmentia and the role that vascular disease plays in its causation. Mounting evidence\npoints toward vascular disease as a major culprit for both Alzheimer's and vascu-\nlar dementia. Although still controversial, this finding would be good news: The\npast 30 years of public health and medical interventions have shown that we can\nprevent vascular disease and that clearly identified vascular risk factors exist that\nare modifiable.\nPrimary prevention of chronic disease depends on early identification of mod-\nifiable risk factors for which effective interventions exist and can be applied.\nThese may include dietary fat intake, dietary antioxidants, obesity, type 2 diabetes,\nhypertension, physical exercise, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Genetic vul-\nnerability related to APO e4 modifies many of these risks, and such interactions\nmayincreasethecontributionofgeneticfactorsinthecontextofexposuretohigher-\nrisk environments. Preventive activities aimed at changing individual behaviors are\noften expensive and difficult to execute in a population-based context. In a broad\nsense, public health interventions that restrict access to smoking (for example),\nincrease screening and control of hypertension or diabetes, or stem the rising tide\nof obesity may also reduce the population burden of dementias. Secondary preven-\ntion of dementia depends on effective screening and early detection of dementia.\nIf effective treatments exist, early detection can lead to modification of dementia\nrisk. Indeed, multiple efforts are now underway to differentiate, through cognitive\nscreening and neuroimaging, those who will progress to dementia from those who\nwill not. For those at high risk of progression to dementia, significant modifications\nin lifestyle and treatment of comorbid conditions, such as hypertension or diabetes,\nmay be effective strategies on the individual level. On the population level, inter-\nventions may include public and provider education regarding dementia or prac-\ntices and policies that support routine dementia screening for people over age 50.\nDementia is a preventable syndrome, and progression to dementia can be pre-\nvented or modified. In 20 years, if the WHO is correct, there will be close to\n100 million people with dementia in the world. Even in wealthy, developed coun-\ntries, the cost and burden of caring for these patients now falls on their families; in\nmost developing countries, there is no safety net at all and the future consequences\nof these policy failures are daunting to imagine.\nThe Annual Review of Public Health is online at\nhttp://publhealth.annualreviews.org\n1.
