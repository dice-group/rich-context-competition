Elevated blood pressure\n(BP) during childhood and adolescence increases\nthe risk of hypertension in adulthood (3,25), when more\nsevere forms of cardiovascular disease also occur quite\nfrequently. It is therefore important to prevent the develop-\nment of hypertension at young ages.\nPhysical activity (PA) is key component of the therapeu-\ntic lifestyle changes recommended for preventing and\ntreating prehypertension and hypertension in children and\nyouth (21,33). The American Heart Association recom-\nmends that children and youth participate in at least 60 min\nof moderate-to-vigorous PA daily for cardiovascular health\npromotion (16). The review of PA interventions completed\nduring the development of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention\u00adsponsored 2005 evidence-based PA guide-\nlines for children and youth suggests that at least 30 min of\nPA at a frequency of 3 times per week and intensity of 80%\nof maximal heart rate is required to lower BP (24).\nAlthough it is recognized that PA has important effects on\nBP, the specific PA guidelines and recommendations\nmentioned above were developed based on the best\navailable evidence, which in the case for BP and most\nother health outcomes in children and youth, is not the ideal\ntype and amount of evidence (14).\nDose\u00adresponse studies are particularly useful for deter-\nmining the minimal and optimal amount of PA required for\ngood health. To our knowledge, only two studies (11,23)\nhave examined the dose\u00adresponse relation between PA and\nBP in children and adolescent with only one study finding a\nrelation (11). This study found that for every 100 METIh\nincrease in PA, systolic BP decreased in a linear manner by\n1.15 mm Hg (11). Although a dose\u00adresponse relation was\nseen, the PA measurement unit (MET) does not provide\ninformation that can be transformed into an understand-\nable public health message (e.g., minutes of PA per day).\nThe self-reported PA questionnaire used in that study was\nalso subject to recall bias (12), and likely resulted in an\noverestimation of actual PA levels.

NHANES is a representative cross-\nsectional survey of the U.S. population (7). The secondary\nanalysis presented here was approved by the Queen`s\nUniversity Health Sciences Research Ethics Board.\nNHANES participants were identified using a complex,\nstratified, multistage, probability sampling design (7). The\npresent study was limited to those aged 8 to 17 yr who\ncompleted both the home and mobile exam center (MEC)\ncomponents of the survey required for the analysis.\nInformed consent was obtained from all the parents and\nparticipants, and the protocol was approved by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics.\nPhysical activity. PA was measured using Actigraph\n7124 activity monitors (Actigraph, Ft. Walton Beach, FL,\nUSA). Activity monitors can be used to objectively measure\nthe duration and intensity of PA under free-living\nconditions (27,32). Monitors were provided to subjects\nduring the MEC exam, were programmed to start recording\nat midnight of the day following the exam, and recorded\nactivity for the following 7 d. Participants were instructed to\nwear the monitor during waking hours except when it\nwould get wet. Monitors were attached to elasticized fabric\nbelts and worn on the right hip.\nThe Actigraph is a uniaxial monitor that measures the\nintensity of movement averaged over 1-min sampling\nepochs. Data from each monitor were downloaded by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and checked for\nspurious data (e.g., biologically implausible values), which\nwere subsequently removed. We did not remove additional\nspurious data; however, further data reduction was com-\npleted by the authors before analyses were performed.\nSpecifically, the current study only included subjects with\nat least 4 d of complete monitoring, including at least one\nweekend day. Four days of monitoring has a test\u00adretest\nreliability of 0.7 (27). A day was considered complete if it\nincluded at least 10 h of wear time (27). Wear time was\ndetermined by filtering activity monitor data and deleting\nsections of more than 20 min of zero counts indicating\nFor each complete day of monitoring, thresholds of 2000\nto walking ~5.6 kmIhj1) counts per minute were used to\ndenote those minutes where the participants were engaged\nin PA of at least a low intensity (total PA) and moderate-to-\nvigorous intensity PA, respectively (26). The measurement\nunit of counts per minute is generated based on the\nmagnitude and frequency of movement. The minutes of\ntotal and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA were averaged\nacross all complete days of monitoring to create the final\nPA variables used for analysis.\nThere is considerable discrepancy in the literature\nconcerning the accelerometry threshold that should be used\nto classify PA intensity, and the proposed thresholds often\nminute thresholds used in this study were selected based on\navailable evidence and best judgement of the authors.\nAlthough the thresholds used here were developed from a\nstudy conducted entirely in adolescent females, similar\nthresholds have been used for males and females (1,22) and\nin youth ranging in age from 6 to 16 yr (22). Thresholds\nwere based on METs achieved during regular child/youth\nactivities (e.g., threshold for moderate-to-vigorous PA\nbased on counts per minute for activity of 3 METs).\nBlood pressure. Measurements were completed at the\nMEC. Subjects were seated and rested quietly for 5 min\nbefore 3 BP measures were obtained on the right arm using\na mercury sphygmomanometer. Systolic BP was recorded at\nthe first Korotkoff sound, and diastolic BP was the point of\nthe last audible Korotkoff sound. Mean BP values were\nused for all analyses. BP z-scores were calculated based on\nreference values for age, height, and sex (21). Hypertension\nwas defined as having systolic or diastolic levels above the\n90th percentile for age, sex, and height (considered\nprehypertensive or hypertensive) (21).\nBody mass index. Height and weight were measured\nduring the MEC to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg,\nrespectively, and used to calculate the body mass index\n(kgImj2). Subjects were classified as ``at-risk of overweight''\nand ``overweight'' according to the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention age- and gender-specific cut-points\npercentile, respectively (19).\nStatistical analysis. All analyses were performed\nusing SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)\nand took into account the sample weights of the NHANES\nsurvey. Linear regression was used to examine the\nrelationship between total PA and moderate-to-vigorous\nPA with systolic BP and diastolic BP. Logistic regression\nwas used to examine the relationship between total PA and\nmoderate-to-vigorous PA with hypertension. In all\nstatistical models, PA was included as a continuous\nmeasure in minutes per day. Fractional polynomial models\nfor PA were run to obtain the models that best fit the dose\u00ad\nresponse relation between PA, BP, and hypertension. The\n36 fractional polynomial regression models recommended\nby Bagnardi et al. (2) for examining dose\u00adresponse\nrelations were used for the current analysis. This form of\nanalysis is concerned with finding the dose\u00adresponse curve\nhttp://www.acsm-msse.org\n1008 Official Journal of the American College of Sports Medicine\nCopyright @ 200 by the American College of Sports Medicine.

For\nthe linear regression analyses, the model with the highest R2\nand smallest error was considered to provide the best fit.\nFor the logistic regression analyses, the model with the\nlowest Akaike information criterion was considered to\nprovide the best fit. Sex, age, and race-ethnicity (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other)\nwere included as covariates in all statistical models.\nBootstrapping was used to estimate the 95% confidence\nintervals (CI) for the regression analyses.\nRESULTS\n2004 NHANES.

There\nwere no statistical differences in the body mass index or\ngender distribution in the participants who were included or\nexcluded from the analyses. However, the participants\nincluded in the analyses were younger and contained a\nhigher proportion of Hispanics.\nBasic demographic characteristics of the subjects\nincluded in the analyses are presented in Table 1.\nApproximately one quarter of the study participants were\nnon-Hispanic white, and 38.4% were classified as either at-\nrisk of overweight or overweight. Subjects participated in\nof total PA and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA, respec-\ntively. Mean systolic and diastolic BP values in males were\nT 10.6 mm Hg. Approximately 14% of the participants were\nhypertensive (18.1% in males, 9.4% in females). As shown\nin Table 2, a higher proportion of females participated in\nparticipated in less than 60 minIdj1 of moderate-to-\nvigorous intensity PA.\nRelations between PA and BP were modeled for PA\nvalues ranging from 0 minIdj1 to 2 standard deviations\nabove the population mean. An inverse dose\u00adresponse\nrelationship was observed between total (Fig. 1A) and\nmoderate-to-vigorous PA (Fig. 1B) with systolic BP. Total\nPA had no effect on systolic BP until approximately 40\nminIdj1, after which systolic BP decreased as total PA\nincreased, with no plateau in the effect. Although an inverse\nrelation was observed between total PA, moderate-to-\nvigorous PA, and systolic BP, the slope of the curve was\nmodest, indicating a minimal influence of PA on systolic\nBP measures. For example, the systolic BP z-score\ntotal PA, which is equivalent to 0.93 mm Hg. A similar\nmodest dose\u00adresponse relation was seen between total PA\n(Fig. 1C) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (Fig. 1D) with\ndiastolic BP. A plateau in the effect of PA on diastolic BP\nwas seen at approximately 75 and 40 minIdj1 for total and\nmoderate-to-vigorous PA, respectively.\nThe likelihood of hypertension decreased in a curvilinear\nmanner with increasing minutes of total PA (Fig. 2A) and\nmoderate-to-vigorous PA (Fig. 2B).

In a previous study of adolescents with\ndyslipidemia, a linear dose\u00adresponse relation was found\nbetween self-report PA and systolic BP; PA was not related\nto diastolic BP (11). That study did not consider whether\nthe relation between PA and BP was nonlinear in nature. Of\nthe two studies in children and youth that examined the\nrelation between PA and BP using an objective measure of\nPA (e.g., accelerometers) (1,5), only one (1) reported a\nsignificant correlation. Neither of these studies used an\nanalysis strategy that adequately explored the dose\u00ad\nresponse relation between PA and BP (1,5).\nA recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials\nreported a similar inconsistency in the effects of PA\ninterventions on lowering BP in children and adolescents\n(18). The authors suggested that the null effect of PA on BP\nmay have been in part related to the inclusion of\nnormotensive subjects in the intervention trials (18). Of\nthe 16 groups included in the meta-analysis, only two were\nlimited to hypertensive subjects (18). A similar observation\nwas made by the authors of an adult based meta-analysis on\nPA and BP. The adult meta-analysis found PA to have a\nthreefold greater effect on lowering BP in hypertensive\ncompared to normotensive individuals (10). The findings\nfrom these meta-analyses suggest that PA has a greater\neffect on high-risk BP values. Our results support this\ncontention. The slopes of the dose\u00adresponse curves between\nPA and mean BP values were modest, whereas the slope\nof the dose\u00adresponse curves between PA and hypertension\nwere quite steep. That PA has a greater effect on high-risk\nBP values is consistent with the effects of PA on other\ncardiovascular risk factors including blood lipids/lipoproteins\n(17) and insulin resistance (15). Perhaps it is only intuitive\nthat PA does not positively impact cardiovascular risk factor\nvalues that already fall within the normal healthy range.\nIn studies of adults, it has been reported that the\nintensity of PA does not significantly contribute to\nwhether or not a PA intervention is able to successfully\nbased PA guidelines for children and youth suggest that an\nintensity corresponding to 80% of the maximum heart rate\nis required in a PA intervention to reduce BP levels in\nhypertensive children and adolescents (24). In the current\nstudy, the nature of the dose\u00adresponse curve between PA\nand hypertension was similar for both total and moderate-\nto-vigorous intensity PA. However, considerably fewer\nminutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA were required\nto lower hypertension risk. For instance, the likelihood of\nhypertension was reduced by approximately 50% at 30\nminIdj1 of moderate-to-vigorous PA versus 90 minIdj1 of\ntotal PA. Thus, in the development of strategies aimed at\npreventing and treating hypertension in children and youth,\nboth time and intensity of PA are important factors to\nconsider.\nFIGURE 1--Relation between total PA and systolic BP z-scores (A), moderate-to-vigorous PA and systolic BP z-scores (B), total PA and diastolic BP\nz-scores (C), and moderate-to-vigorous PA and diastolic BP z-scores (D).

Specifically, we observed a\nplateau in the relationship between moderate-to-vigorous\nPA and hypertension risk at approximately 60 minIdj1. The\nabsence of a plateau in the relationship between total PA\nand hypertension risk also corroborates the Canadian PA\nguidelines for children and youth, which recommends that\nall children and youth, regardless of their current PA level,\nincrease overall PA by 90 minIdj1 (http://www.phac-aspc.\ngc.ca/pau-uap/fitness/downloads.html). Given the volume\nof PA recommended in the evidence-based PA guidelines,\nand the dose\u00adresponse relation between PA and hyper-\ntension observed here, it is very concerning that only\n11.7% of the male and 1.4% of the female participants in\nthis study were moderately or vigorously active for at least\n60 minIdj1 on average. These findings emphasize the need\nfor the implementation of public health interventions and\npolicies that will substantially improve the PA levels of\nmost children and adolescents. In the development of\nstrategies to increase PA participation, it is important to\nconsider the roles of the family, school, and community\nenvironments have on PA participation in children and\nThe strengths of this study include the use of a large and\nrepresentative study sample, the use of an objective PA\nmeasure, and the statistical modeling approach that allowed\nus to accurately characterize the dose\u00adresponse relation\nbetween PA, BP, and hypertension. The primary study\nlimitation was the cross-sectional and observational nature,\nwhich prevents us from making causal inferences about the\nrelation between PA and BP. Although objective in nature,\nPA accelerometers are not perfect measures of PA, and their\nmain limitation is the inability to capture certain types of\nPA such as swimming and bicycling (12). Another issue\nwith accelerometers is the discrepancy in thresholds used by\ndifferent investigators to denote those minutes where the\nparticipants were physically active, as discussed in more\ndetail in the Methods. Had different threshold been employed\nin the present study, the slopes of the dose\u00adresponse curves\nmay have changed. In addition, we considered all minutes of\nPA, not just those minutes that occurred within bouts of at\nleast a few minutes in length. Had we limited the physically\nactive minutes to those that occurred in bouts, the total\nminutes of PA in the study participants would have been\nreduced substantially, and the reduction in BP values or\nhypertension risk for a given increase in PA would have\nbeen larger. Finally, the slight differences in characteristics\nbetween the participants used in our analyses and the overall\nNHANES sample limit the generalizability of the results.\nIn summary, PA is a better predictor of hypertension than\nmean BP levels. Meeting the guidelines of 60 minIdj1 of\nmoderate-to-vigorous intensity PA greatly reduces the like-\nlihood of hypertension in the pediatric population. Unfortu-\nnately, few children and youth achieve this PA level.\nThis study was supported by an operating grant provided by the\nCanadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 84478).
