The proportion of energy consumed in the evening (after 5 pm) was estimated\nfrom a 24 h dietary recall obtained at baseline. Weight change was de\u00aened as the difference between the follow-up\nand baseline weights.\nRESULTS: Mean \u00c6 s.e. of percent energy from evening food intake was 46 \u00c6 0.29 in the analytic cohort. After\nadjustment for multiple covariates, percent energy from evening food intake and weight change were unrelated in\nboth men and women.\nCONCLUSION: Extent of evening eating was not a signi\u00aecant predictor of 10 y weight change in the NHEFS cohort.\nKeywords: meal patterns; evening eating; weight change; TEF; NHANES I; NHEFS; obesity; energy intake; energy\nexpenditure\nIntroduction\nDoes eating at night lead to weight gain? Evidence\nexploring this hypothesis in the scienti\u00aec literature is\nlimited. Halberg1, in his review on chronobiology of\nnutrition, reported that subjects consuming a \u00aexed\namount of energy for breakfast versus dinner\nshowed differences in the amount of weight change.\nThese data suggest that ef\u00aeciency of energy utilization\nshows circadian variability. Findings of Romon et al2\nsupport this notion. Thermic effect of food (TEF) of\nisocaloric meals differed according to time of day,\nwith TEF due to morning meal being signi\u00aecantly\nhigher than TEF attributed to afternoon or night\nmeals2. These observations suggest that dietary pat-\nterns where energy intake in the evening or night is\nhigher, may increase the risk of energy storage\n(weight gain) by decreasing daily energy expenditure.\nAnother popular hypothesis is that large evening\nmeals promote energy storage due to the customary\npractice of sedentary activities following such meals.\nWe recently reported the association of self-\nreported body weight with extent of evening eating\nin 1802 women3. In this cross-sectional study, body\nmass index and proportion of daily energy consumed\nin the evening were not related. We undertook the\npresent study to enable a prospective examination of\nthe relation of extent of evening eating with subse-\nquent weight change over ten years of follow-up in a\nlarge cohort of men and women.\nMethods\nThe \u00aerst National Health and Nutrition Examination\nthe National Center on Health Statistics (NCHS)4. The\nNHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS)\nwas initiated in 1982 by NCHS and other Public\nHealth Service agencies, including the National Insti-\ntutes of Health5. The aim of NHEFS is to relate\nmortality and morbidity at follow-up to nutritional,\nhealth, and other information collected in NHANES\nI5. Respondents who were 25\u00b174 y of age at the time\nof initial survey (n  14 407) were considered eligible\nfor follow-up5. The augmentation phase of NHANES\nwas not obtained. We excluded these respondents\nfrom the eligible cohort.\nAnalytic cohort\nFrom the entire NHEFS cohort exclusions were made\nfor: 24 h recalls judged by the interviewer to be\nunsatisfactory due to physical or mental limitations,\nnegative attitude, and incomplete interviews (205);\nCorrespondence: Dr AK Kant, Dept. of Family, Nutrition, and\nExercise Sciences, Remsen Hall, Room 306E, Queens College of\nthe City University of New York, 65\u00b130 Kissena Blvd., Flushing,\natypical intake due to illness on the day of recall\ntion errors in 24 h recalls (45); and recalls of pregnant\nand lactating women at baseline (125). Some respon-\ndents were in more than one exclusion category.\nThese exclusions based on validity of baseline 24 h\nrecall data yielded a cohort of 10 424 individuals.\nFrom this initial cohort, exclusions were made for\nlack of follow-up weight due to known or suspected\ndeath, or unknown status (n  3257); unreliable\nreported weight (n  5); and pregnant at follow-up\nA single 24 h dietary recall was administered to\neach respondent at baseline by a trained dietary\ninterviewer using three-dimensional food models to\nenable estimation of amount of food consumed4.\nEstimates of nutrient intake were obtained using US\nDepartment of Agriculture food composition data for\nthe amounts of food reported consumed in each\nrecall6. Information on age, income, education, smok-\ning status, level of physical activity, and health status\nwas obtained at baseline4.\nwere measured using standardized procedures in dis-\nposable uniforms and footwear in examination trai-\nin indoor clothing, without shoes, using a portable\nscale in subject's home5, but height was not measured.\nBecause sex, age, body size, and season-adjusted\nestimated weights of indoor clothing are not available\nfor this cohort, we did not adjust the follow-up weight\nfor weight of indoor clothing. Further, our purpose\nwas to examine the association of evening eating with\nweight change from baseline and not the extent of\nabsolute weight change over the period of follow-up.\nSuch analyses would be unchanged by subtraction of a\nconstant estimated weight of indoor clothing from the\nfollow-up weight.\nExtent of evening eating at baseline\nAs part of the baseline 24 h dietary recall, subjects\nwere asked to give time of day for each eating\noccasion. Eating occasions reported before or until\n10:59 am were classi\u00aeed as occurring in the morning\nperiod; eating occasions reported from 11:00 am\u00b1\n4:59 pm were in the afternoon period; eating occa-\nperiod; and those reported at or after 8:00 pm were\nin the night period.\nStatistical methods\nWeight change was de\u00aened as the difference between\nweight measured at follow-up and baseline. Propor-\ntion of daily energy intake from each of the de\u00aened\ntime periods (morning, afternoon, evening, and night)\nwas calculated for each respondent. Descriptive sta-\ntistics for baseline nutrient intake, baseline body mass\nindex (BMI), and weight change were obtained by\npercent energy from evening and night food intake.\nThe association of percent energy from evening and\nnight combined (all foods consumed after 5 pm), and\nnight (after 8 pm) food intake at baseline and weight\nchange was examined using sex-speci\u00aec regression\nanalyses. All regression analyses were run with and\nwithout adjustment for variables known to affect body\nweight. The potential confounders included race\nsmoking status (never, former and current smoker),\nage at baseline (continuous), length of follow-up\n(continuous), level of self-reported recreational phy-\nsical activity at baseline and at follow-up (a lot,\nmoderate, and little), energy intake (continuous),\nbaseline BMI (continuous), alcohol intake (none,\nlow and high), special diet status (yes and no), and\nparity (0, ! 1) (women only). Additionally, because\nchanges in body weight may be affected by the\npresence of certain medical conditions, a trend vari-\nable based on physician-con\u00aermed diagnosis of heart\ncondition, diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid disease,\nand hospitalization since 1970 for cirrhosis, colitis,\nchronic bronchitis or cancer was created, using the\ncriteria of Williamson et al7.

Percent energy consumed after 5 pm decreased\nwith advancing age (Table 3), but increased with the\nlevel of education (Table 4). Whites reported a higher\nlevel of after 5 pm eating that did non-whites. Current\nsmokers had higher level of after 5 pm eating relative\nto never-smokers. Women with a high level of base-\nline BMI ( b 27.2) reported a lower percent energy\nafter 5pm relative to those with BMI of 27.2. Men\nwith no or low morbidity had higher food intake after\n5 pm relative to those with greater morbidity. Percent\nenergy consumed after 5 pm varied little by the level\nof self-reported recreational physical activity at base-\nline or follow-up in both men and women.\nAssociation of extent of evening eating with weight\nchange\nTable 5 presents the regression coef\u00aecient \u00c6 s.e.\nassociated with percent energy consumed after 5 pm\nfrom unadjusted, age-adjusted and multiple-covariate-\nadjusted regression models.

In women, a posi-\ntive association of extent of after 5 pm eating with\nweight change was noted in unadjusted models, but\nnot after adjustment for age or multiple covariates.\nAssociation of night eating (after 8 pm) with weight\nchange was also not signi\u00aecant in men or women\n(data not shown).\nThe association of after 5 pm eating with weight\nchange was also examined after strati\u00aecation for\nweight loss or weight gain status.

(Data for strati\u00aeed analyses not shown).\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the \u00aerst study to pros-\npectively examine the relation of time of energy\nconsumption with long-term weight change. In unstra-\nti\u00aeed analyses, the association of evening eating and\nweight change was not signi\u00aecant in men or women.\nIn accordance with results of our previous study3,\nbaseline BMI and percent energy consumed after 5 pm\nwere also not related in multiple-covariate-adjusted\nregression models.\nThe biologic plausibility of the hypothesis exam-\nined in this study is dependent on time of day\ndifferences in TEF. The limited evidence on circadian\nvariability of TEF presents a mixed picture. For\nexample, Romon et al2 reported TEF after a night\nmeal to be lowest relative to iso-energetic meals\nconsumed in the morning or afternoon. Zwiauer et\nal10, however, noted no differences in TEF after a\nmorning versus an afternoon meal. More work, using\nreproducible methods to account for large intraindivi-\ndual variability in TEF measurements11, is needed in\nthis area.\nAnother hypothesis for increased risk of energy\nstorage is based on differences in level of voluntary\nenergy expenditure after consumption of meals at\ndifferent times of the day. It is argued that a large\nmeal in the middle of the day (usually followed by\nseveral hours of physical activities) will not lead to\nenergy storage, whereas due to the usual practice of\nsedentary activities following the evening meal, large\nevening meals increase the risk of energy storage.\nThese statements suggest a different mechanism,\ndependent on the interaction of exercise and TEF.\nHowever, the available evidence on the interaction of\nexercise and TEF is equivocal12,13. Different results,\ndependent on pre versus post meal exercise, adiposity,\nlevel of \u00aetness, duration of exercise, and energy\ncontent of the meal, have been reported12. In the\npresent study, no consistent pattern of association\nwas observed in men and women strati\u00aeed by level\nof baseline or follow-up physical activity. The\nobserved associations may simply be due to chance\nbecause of the number of multiple comparisons made.\nWe also noted a positive association of after 5 pm\neating with weight change in male never-smokers\nonly, which suggests an interaction of smoking with\nTEF. Although metabolic effects of smoking are\nknown to differ by gender, Perkins14 concluded that\nsmoking had either little effect on TEF or reduced the\nThe evidence of the effect of adiposity on thermo-\ngenic effect of food is equivocal. Some indicate that\nTEF is blunted in obese individuals15,16, others have\nreported no differences in TEF of obese versus non-\nobese individuals17,18. We examined the association of\nextent of evening eating with weight change within\ndifferent strata of baseline BMI. No association was\nevident in any strata in men or women, suggesting\nlack of effect of adiposity on the relation of evening\neating and weight change.\nThe estimated mean of 46% of energy intake after\nis similar to the estimate we reported for women in the\ndata)3. Few other published estimates are available,\nbut generally our results are consistent with these\nThe source of baseline dietary data for the NHEFS\ncohort is a 24 h dietary recall. Measurement error is\nknown to be associated with all dietary assessment\nmethods including recalls20. Under reporting and\nmisreporting of food intake has been recognized as a\nproblem in dietary survey20,21. A differential in the\nextent of under reporting by the level of adiposity has\nalso been reported in some studies.21 To improve\nquality of dietary intake data in future surveys, use\nof techniques such as double labeled water or other\nbiomarkers to validate estimates of energy intake in a\nsubsample should be considered. Also, replicate diet-\nEvening eating and long-term weight change\nAK Kant et al\nary measurements can be used to derive variance\nratios for dietary variables. However, biomarkers for\nvalidating dietary intake or estimates of intra- and\ninterindividual variability of the exposure variable\n(time of day energy intake) for the NHEFS cohort\nare not available to allow correction of our estimates\nof association.\nAnother possible reason for attenuation of the true\nassociation of time of eating with weight change may\nbe a differential ability or willingness to recall foods\nconsumed at different times of day. To our knowl-\nedge, no evidence is available to support or contradict\nthis hypothesis. Yet, it is possible that individuals may\nnot remember or choose to recall foods consumed late\nat night due to undesirability of this eating behavior,\nthereby leading to an underestimate of the extent of\nafter 5 pm eating. Furthermore, if there is a body\nweight related differential in estimates of extent of\nafter 5 pm eating, it may also diminish the true\nassociation.\nThe assumption of persistence of dietary patterns\nover the period of follow-up is inherent in epidemio-\nlogic studies that do not include repeated ascertain-\nment of changes in exposure. Repeated measures of\ndietary intake over the follow-up period are not\navailable for the NHEFS cohort. To test the validity\nof this assumption, it is useful to examine whether\ntime of day food consumption patterns persist in\nadults. A comparison of estimates of after 5 pm\nnot support the notion of dramatic changes in time of\nday food consumption patterns of Americans. How-\never, because the extent of after 5 pm eating declined\nwith age in this cohort (Table 3), it is reasonable to\nassume that as the cohort ages, time of day food\nconsumption patterns will change with retirement.\nThe effect of this possible change in exposure over\nfollow-up would be to further attenuate the true\nassociation.\nConclusions\nThe extent of evening eating and subsequent weight\nchanges were unrelated in the NHEFS cohort. The\nresults of this study point to a need for long-term\nfeeding trials with manipulation of time-of-day dis-\ntribution of iso-energetic intake in subjects serving as\ntheir own controls. Work on the relation of body\nweight with accuracy of dietary reporting by time of\nday as well as the extent of intra- and inter-individual\nvariability in estimates of extent of eating by time of\nday is needed. Further exploration of time of day\ndifferences in TEF, controlling for factors that con-\ntribute to large variability in measurement of TEF, is\nalso needed.\n"
