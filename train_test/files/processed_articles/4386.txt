This treatment\nwas not free from complications, especially in\npatients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, in\nwhom low rates of SVR were observed.9\u00ad11\nHowever, the introduction of new direct-acting\nantiviral agents (DAA) in the current treatment\nfor HCV patients have changed this paradigm,\nachieving high SVR rates with minimal side\neffects, even in patients with cirrhosis.12 In conse-\nquence, a huge number of patients with advanced\nchronic liver disease are achieving SVR, high-\nlighting the importance of monitoring fibrosis\nregression to identify those patients with a higher\nrisk of developing complications during follow\nup. Non-invasive methods such as transient elas-\ntography (TE) may be useful for monitoring these\nchanges. Liver stiffness has been correlated with\ndegree of liver fibrosis, the presence of clinically\nsignificant portal hypertension and with the risk\nof decompensation.13\u00ad15 On the other hand,\nrecently, spleen stiffness has been shown to be\nalso correlated with HVPG and the risk of decom-\npensation.16,17 However, it has to be taken into\naccount that non-invasive methods to evaluate\nliver fibrosis have not been validated in non-\nviremic patients and changes in liver stiffness after\na successful antiviral treatment might not accu-\nrately reflect a real change in residual fibrosis, but\nrather a reduction in inflammation.\nThe aim of our study was to investigate the early\nchanges in liver and spleen stiffness measurement\n(LSM, SSM) in HCV patients with compensated\nadvanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) treated\nwith new oral DAA in order to elucidate the fac-\ntors determining the initial changes in stiffness\nand their implications for the long-term follow up\nof HCV-cured patients.\nPatients and methods\nConsecutive compensated patients with baseline\nLSM 10 kPa who met the Baveno VI criteria for\ncACLD18 and in whom treatment with oral DAA\nwas approved were included in this prospective\nsmall-scale study.

Only LSMs with\nsuccess rate of 60% (with at least 10 valid meas-\nurements) and an interquartile-range-to-median-\nLSM ratio of 30% were selected as valid measures.\nMedium or extra-large probes were selected as per\ndevice indication and, for each patient, the same\nprobe was used during all study visits.\nSpleen stiffness measurement\nSSMs were performed with TE using Fibroscan\u00ae\n502 Touch at the same appointment, with the\nsame probe and the same software used for LSM,\nwith the patient in the supine position and the left\narm in maximal abduction. The spleen was local-\nized under ultrasound assistance (Vscan\u00ae, General\nElectric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA), and\nthe probe was positioned where the spleen was\ncorrectly visualized.

This rapid on\u00adoff response\nwith DAA becomes a very interesting model for\ninvestigating the dynamics of liver and spleen\nstiffness and learn about the contribution of the\ndifferent components causing increased tissue\nstiffness. The results of the present study clearly\nindicate that liver and spleen stiffness improve\nvery early during treatment, as early as at 4 weeks\nof therapy or even before, and more importantly,\nthat this initial decrease explains for most of the\nfinal liver and spleen stiffness observed for the\nfirst 48 weeks of post-treatment follow up.\nPrevious studies have shown improvement in\nliver stiffness during long-term follow up, espe-\ncially in patients who achieve SVR treated with\nTable 3.

Evaluation of LSM at\nweek 4 of treatment was rarely performed. H\u00e9zode\net al.20 studied patients treated with pegylated\ninterferon- plus RBV, and they found that\npatients with cirrhosis who achieved SVR pre-\nsented a median decrease in LSM of 4.1 kPa at\nweek 4 compared with a decrease of 0.7 kPa in\npatients with no cirrhosis. By contrast, Bernuth\net al.21 found that in patients with chronic HCV\ninfection receiving sofosbuvir-based treatment,\nLSM increased at week 4, from a baseline LSM\nof 8 kPa to 12.9 kPa: one of the reasons given by\nthe authors to explain these results is that patients\ndid not fast prior to TE and also that the anaemia\ncaused by combined therapy might have increased\nliver blood flow and liver stiffness.\nOne of the most remarkable findings of the pre-\nsent study is that the rapid liver and spleen stiff-\nness improvement observed at 4 weeks of therapy\nexplains most of the decrease in stiffness observed\nduring the total 15 months of follow up. Indeed,\nalthough there was a small decline in LSM from\nweek 4 to end of follow up (median change \u00ad1.5\nkPa), approximately 75% of the decrease was\nobserved during the first 4 weeks of therapy\n(median change \u00ad4.8 kPa).

First,\nthat in patients with HCV cACLD, 15\u00ad20% of\nthe observed liver stiffness is probably due to\ninflammation. In this regard, inflammation-\nadapted LSM cut-offs have been proposed, but\nthere is a controversy about its usefulness.22,23\nSecond, this explains in great part the observed\ndiscrepancies between liver histology and liver\nstiffness after HCV eradication. As seen in our\npatients, significant changes in LSM occur in 4\nweeks, while it has been well documented that\ndetectable changes in fibrosis require much more\ntime. In our sample, 78% of our patients had\nbaseline LSM  15 kPa and at the end of follow\nup, this percentage was reduced to 47%, while\nthe percentage of patients with LSM < 10 kPa\nand with LSM between 10\u00ad15 kPa increased pro-\ngressively. However, D'Ambrosio et al.24 demon-\nstrated that 21% of patients with LSM < 12 kPa\nafter an average of 61 months from SVR still had\ncirrhosis in liver biopsy, indicating less accuracy\nof TE for diagnosing cirrhosis in nonviremic\npatients. Thus, in order to validate the clinical\nmeaning of post-treatment LSM values, longer\nfollow-up studies will be needed, taking into con-\nsideration the information regarding basal LSM,\nchanges in LSM during follow up and post-ther-\napy time frames.\nIn addition to LSM improvement, SSM also\nremarkably improved in a similar (and even more\npronounced) pattern. All SSM improvement was\nseen during the first 4 weeks of therapy, with no\nadditional change for the rest of the follow up.\nAgain, this rapid decrease, along with the strong\ncorrelation with the decrease in liver stiffness (and\nliver inflammation), suggests that the main driver\nfor this improvement is not only spleen congestion\nand portal hypertension decrease. Although spleen\nand a reduction in HVPG during HCV treatment\nhas been demonstrated in previous studies,3,4,27 it\nseems plausible that other explanations are needed\nfor this rapid change in spleen stiffness. In that\nsense, the splenomegaly classically associated to\nportal hypertension could be considered as a com-\nposite of congestion, enlargement and hyperplasia\nof splenic lymphoid tissue (white pulp), and\nincreased angiogenesis and fibrogenesis.28,29 In\naddition, increased splenic inflammation might\nhave an additional role in HCV-infected patients,\nconsidering that spleen could be regarded as a\nlarge lymph node and HCV-infected patients con-\nsistently show hepatic perihiliar adenomegalies on\nliver imaging. Altogether, these findings point out\nto a rapid improvement in spleen inflammation or\nspleen remodelling due to a decrease in lymphoid\ntissue infiltration as the main cause for the initial\nspleen stiffness decrease. However, a very early\ndecrease in portal pressure due to reduced liver\ninflammation could also partially contribute to\ndecrease spleen stiffness.\nFinally, as expected, all analytical parameters\nimproved during follow up, and those not affected\nby RBV, improved also very early (4 weeks) dur-\ning therapy. Platelet counts also followed this pat-\ntern, and again, most of the improvement\nobserved during follow up occurred at 4 weeks of\ntherapy. Remarkably, patients in whom a signifi-\ncant improvement of SSM was observed pre-\nsented the greater increase in platelet counts, as\ncompared with patients without significant SSM\nimprovement (Fig. 5). Similar results were\nobtained comparing patients with or without\nLSM improvement. Although a correlation\nbetween changes in spleen size and increase in\nplatelet counts after HCV therapy has been\nreported,30 in our case, differences in spleen size\nwere not observed, probably due to the short fol-\nlow up. Platelet counts have been shown to\nincrease years after SVR due to improvement in\nthrombopoietin production, improvement in por-\ntal hypertension and reversal of splenomegaly.30\nIn our case, the rapid improvement and correla-\ntion with SSM changes suggests that platelets\nincrease mainly due to spleen release secondary\nto decreased spleen sequestration.\nThe limitations of the present study include the\nsmall sample size and the lack of external valida-\ntion. The small sample size limits the ability to\ncontrol confounding factors through multivariate\nregression analysis. Also the lack of simultaneous\nliver biopsy and HVPG information is a weakness\nof our study with a very difficult solution, since it\nwould be probably unethical to perform them at 4\nweeks of therapy. Moreover, SSM may be techni-\ncally difficult to perform in clinical practice due to\nthe need to carry out an ultrasound prior to TE to\nlocalize the spleen, and the fact that TE is not\noptimized for SSM. As a consequence of that, not\nall patients could be evaluated for SSM and the\nTherapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(8)\n628 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag\nresults might have been altered. However, we feel\nthat this is not the case, since SSM correlated\nvery well with LSM and platelet findings, and\nSSM values remained very constant after the ini-\ntial decrease. Another limitation is that most of\nthe patients (88%) were genotype 1 and all of\nthem were White. Both genotype and ethnicity\nhave been known to affect kinetics of liver fibrosis\nrelated to HCV.31 Finally, the lack of a longer fol-\nlow up limits the capacity to detect long-term\nchanges in LSM and SSM that are probably\nrelated to fibrosis improvement.\nIn conclusion, liver and spleen stiffness decrease\nsignificantly and very rapidly during DAA treat-\nment of HCV-infected cACLD patients and this\nimprovement accounts for most of the stiffness\nimprovement observed during follow up, suggest-\ning that it most probably reflects liver and spleen\nimprovement in inflammation and cell infiltra-\ntion. These findings have important clinical\nimplications for the follow up of cACLD HCV-\ncured patients, since changes in LSM after SVR\ncannot be interpreted just as a reduction of liver\nfibrosis (at least during the first year of follow up).\nConsequently, patients with cACLD prior to\nSVR cannot be discharged from follow up based\non LSM improvements. Until more information\nfrom patients with longer follow up and with liver\nbiopsy information is gathered, patients will have\nto remain under surveillance.\nFunding\nSalvador Augustin is a recipient of a Juan Rod\u00e9s\ngrant from Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Spain.\nM\u00f2nica Pons is a recipient of a PFIS grant from\nInstituto de Salud Carlos III.
