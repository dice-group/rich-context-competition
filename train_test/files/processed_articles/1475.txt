Partic-\nipants over the age of 12 years who did not have hemophilia or\nundergo recent cancer chemotherapy were eligible for\nvenipuncture.\nFor our analysis, we excluded participants who had acute\nor chronic diseases that could potentially affect their serum\nacid\u00adbase status and inflammatory biomarker levels. From an\nwe excluded 12 877 who had self-reported chronic disease,\nincluding arthritis, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic\nkidney disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery dis-\nease, myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular disease,\nliver disease and cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer).\nWe also excluded 1144 participants who were taking oral\nhypoglycemic therapy, insulin, antihypertensive therapy,\ndiuretics, cholesterol-lowering medications, nonsteroidal anti-\ninflammatory drugs or acetylsalicylic acid; 1983 participants\nwho reported having an infection within the month before the\nsurvey; 301 participants who reported donating blood within\nthe year before the survey; 935 participants without dietary\ninformation; and 507 participants without laboratory informa-\ntion. We excluded an additional 309 participants who had an\nalbumin level of less than 35 g/L, a calcium level of more\nthan 2.6 mmol/L or an estimated glomerular filtration rate of\nliers, we excluded 43 participants who had extreme values for\nserum anion gap. We included the remaining 4525 partici-\npants in our analysis.\nMeasurement of laboratory parameters\nSerum levels of electrolytes, albumin and creatinine were\nmeasured with the use of a Hitachi Model 704 multichannel\nanalyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis,\nUSA) and the Beckman Synchron LX20 (Beckman Coulter\nInc., Fullerton, USA). We calculated the anion gap according\nto the following equation: anion gap (mmol/L) = serum\nsodium level (mmol/L) \u00ad [serum chloride level (mmol/L) +\nserum bicarbonate level (mmol/L)].\nLeukocyte counts, platelet counts and mean platelet vol-\nume were measured with the use of a Beckman Coulter\nMAXM Analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc.). C-reactive protein\nlevels were measured with the use of a Dad Behring Nephelo-\nmeter II Analyzer System (Dad Behring Diagnostics Inc.,\nSomerville, USA). Serum ferritin levels were measured with\nthe use of the Quantimune Ferritin IRMA kit (Bio-Rad Labo-\nratories, Hercules, USA). Fibrinogen levels were measured by\nmeans of the Clauss clotting method on the STA-Compact\nanalyzer (Diagnostica Stago S.A., Asnieres, France). Serum\nferritin and fibrinogen levels were not available for individu-\nWe calculated the glomerular filtration rate according to\nthe simplified prediction equation in the Modification of Diet\nin Renal Disease Study (MDRD).13 We corrected serum crea-\nsurveys to align creatinine values with the creatinine assay\nused in the development of the MDRD equation.14,15 Serum\nsurveys did not require correction.\nStatistical analysis\nBecause older individuals, Hispanic and black individuals\nwere intentionally overrepresented in the survey populations,\nwe applied appropriate sample weights to obtain weighted\nregression estimates. The final results of our analyses are gen-\neralizable to the US population.\nWe divided values for serum anion gap into quartiles.\nWithin each quartile, we calculated the percentage of each cate-\ngorical demographic characteristic and the mean (and standard\nerror) of age, body mass index (BMI) and each laboratory mea-\nsurement. Ethnic background was predefined in the surveys as\nnon-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic or other. In\nlinear regression analyses, we included leukocyte count, neu-\ntrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, eosinophil\ncount, basophil count, C-reactive protein level, platelet count,\nmean platelet volume, ferritin level and fibrinogen level as\ndependent variables, with quartiles of serum anion gap (or con-\ntinuous anion gap) as the independent variable. We considered\nthe following covariates: age, sex, ethnic background, use of\nalcohol, BMI, dietary protein intake, and serum levels of creati-\nnine, albumin, urea, uric acid and cotinine. We calculated 95%\nconfidence intervals (CIs) for parameter estimates of the depen-\ndent variables. We calculated tests of trend across quartiles of\nanion gap values, with the median value of each quartile serv-\ning as an ordinal variable. All p values were 2-sided. We per-\nformed similar analyses with serum bicarbonate level, rather\nthan anion gap, as the independent variable.\nProtocols to recruit and examine participants of the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were\nreviewed and approved by the US National Center for Health\nStatistics Institutional Review Board.\nResults\nThe following mean values were all within normal limits: serum\nanion gap 11.6 mmol/L, bicarbonate level 24.2 mmol/L, leuko-\nistics of the 4525 participants included in our study, by quartile\nof serum anion gap, are shown in Table 1. The different numbers\nof participants in each quartile were a result of the high fre-\nquency of shared anion gap levels in our population. Because the\nassociations between serum anion gap and biomarkers of inflam-\nmation and between serum bicarbonate level and biomarkers of\ninflammation did not vary by sex or race, we combined results\nfor men and women and for different ethnic groups.\nSerum anion gap was positively associated with leukocyte\ncount and C-reactive protein level (Table 2). After multivari-\nable adjustment (for age, sex, BMI, ethnic background, use of\nalcohol, dietary protein intake, and serum levels of creatinine,\nalbumin, urea, uric acid and cotinine), we found that the leuko-\nevery increase of 1 mmol/L in anion gap.

Serum anion gap and bicarbonate level\nwere not associated with eosinophil count or fibrinogen level.\nThe results did not change significantly after further\nadjustment of multivariable models for serum levels of cal-\ncium, potassium and insulin, and dietary potassium intake.\nInterpretation\nAmong healthy adults who participated in the National Health\nfound that a higher anion gap and a lower serum bicarbonate\nlevel were associated with higher levels of several inflamma-\ntory biomarkers, including leukocyte count and C-reactive\nprotein level. These relations were independent of age, sex,\nBMI, ethnic background, use of alcohol, dietary protein intake,\nand serum levels of creatinine, cotinine, albumin, uric acid and\nurea. Because we excluded participants who had chronic dis-\neases, those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of less\nthan 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 and those who were taking a vari-\nety of medications, it is unlikely that illness or a reduced\nglomerular filtration rate accounted for the associations with\ninflammatory biomarkers. Of note, the mean values of serum\nelectrolytes, leukocyte count, C-reactive protein level, platelet\ncount, mean platelet volume, ferritin level and fibrinogen level\nin our study population were all within normal limits.\nThe cause of the observed association between higher\nserum anion gap and higher levels of inflammatory biomark-\ners in this apparently healthy population is unknown. Eleva-\ntions in the serum anion gap can result from an increase in\nunmeasured anions, as occurs in several forms of metabolic\nacidosis, or from a decrease in unmeasured cations.16 In gen-\neral, reductions in serum calcium and potassium concentra-\ntions are an unusual cause of an increased anion gap.16 In our\nstudy, the relation between anion gap and inflammation was\nunchanged after adjustment for these cations. Serum albumin\ncan also affect the anion gap;17 however, we excluded individ-\nuals with low serum albumin levels and adjusted for albumin\nin the multivariable analyses. A mild increase in anion gap\nhas been reported in metabolic alkalosis;18 however, we are\nunaware of data linking metabolic alkalosis to inflammation.\nIn our study, higher serum bicarbonate levels were not associ-\nated with higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers.\nTable 3: Adjusted differences in inflammatory biomarkers, by quartile of serum bicarbonate level\nQuartile of serum bicarbonate level; difference in biomarker (95% CI)\nBiomarker\nQuartile 4\nQuartile 3\nQuartile 2\nQuartile 1\np value\nfor trend\nAdjusted for multiple\nvariables*\nC-reactive protein level, nmol/L\nAdjusted for multiple\nvariables*\nNote: CI = confidence interval.\n*Adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, ethnic background, use of alcohol, serum levels of cotinine, albumin, creatinine, uric acid and urea, and dietary protein intake.\nTable 2: Adjusted differences in inflammatory biomarkers, by quartile of serum anion gap\nQuartile of serum anion gap; difference in biomarker (95% CI)\nBiomarker\nQuartile 1\nQuartile 2\nQuartile 3\nQuartile 4\np value\nfor trend\nAdjusted for multiple\nvariables*\nC-reactive protein level, nmol/L\nAdjusted for multiple\nvariables*\nNote: CI = confidence interval.\n*Adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, ethnic background, use of alcohol, serum levels of cotinine, albumin, creatinine, uric acid and urea, and dietary protein intake.\nResearch\nThe participants in our study who had a higher anion gap\nmay have had a circulating unmeasured anion that contributed\nto a greater level of inflammation. The inverse relation be-\ntween serum bicarbonate and inflammatory biomarkers sug-\ngests that such an anion, if present, may be the conjugate base\nof an organic acid. In vitro data suggest that lower extracellu-\nlar pH stimulates the inflammatory response. Lower extracel-\nlular pH results in lower intracellular pH in neutrophils,6\nwhich may activate neutrophils.19 Furthermore, lower extra-\ncellular pH may activate the complement system.8\nThe small increases in levels of inflammatory biomarkers\nassociated with increasing anion gap in our study were similar\nin size to the changes observed in other studies linking inflam-\nmation to the development of various chronic diseases. For\neach increase of 1.0 \u00d7 109/L in leukocyte count, the risk of car-\ndiovascular events among postmenopausal women has been\nfound to increase by 11%3 and the risk of death from any\ncause in the general population has been found to increase by\n11%.1 Similar findings have been reported for death secondary\nto coronary artery disease,20 cerebrovascular disease21 and can-\ncer.22 Several studies have shown that the risk of cardiovascu-\nlar disease increases significantly with increasing levels of C-\nreactive protein.23 Erlinger and colleagues found that an\nincrease of 1.02 mg/L (9.7 nmol/L) in C-reactive protein level\nincreased the risk of colorectal cancer by 43%.4\nLimitations\nOur study has limitations. First, because the data were cross-\nsectional, we were unable to determine whether higher serum\nanion gap or lower serum bicarbonate level were risk factors\nfor, rather than the result of, inflammation. Thus, our observa-\ntional data are hypothesis generating. Second, unknown factors\nmay have affected both the serum acid\u00adbase status and the\ninflammatory biomarker levels in our study participants. Our\nmultivariable regression models accounted for only 15%\u00ad21%\nof the variation in leukocyte count and C-reactive protein level.\nThird, the study participants did not eat controlled diets. How-\never, the primary dietary determinants of net endogenous acid\nproduction are total protein and potassium.9 Adjustment for the\nintake of these factors did not change our results. Finally, we\ndid not have measurements of arterial pH or partial pressure of\ncarbon dioxide, nor did we have urinary parameters to measure\nrenal net acid excretion. Thus, we are unable to assess fully the\nacid\u00adbase status of the participants in the study.\nConclusion\nA higher serum anion gap and a lower serum bicarbonate level,\ndespite being within normal limits, were independently associ-\nated with higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers in a healthy\nsample of the general population. These data raise the possibil-\nity that increased production of organic acid mediates the\nchronic inflammatory state that increases the risk of coronary\nartery disease and cancer. Further studies are needed to deter-\nmine the effect of alkali supplementation on inflammatory bio-\nmarker levels and to examine prospectively the relation\nbetween acid\u00adbase status, inflammation and chronic disease.\nThis article has been peer reviewed.\nCompeting interests: None declared.\nContributors: Both of the authors contributed substantially to the study concept\nand design.
