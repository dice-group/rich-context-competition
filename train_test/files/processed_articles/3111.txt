In\nthe past 50 years, probably as a result\nof dentifrices and increased levels of\nfluoride in drinking water, pediatric\ndental caries occurrence in the United\nStates has declined dramatically; nev-\nertheless, there remain important dis-\nparities in caries prevalence within the\npopulation.3,4 In particular, young chil-\ndren living in poverty constitute the 1\nsubgroup in which there has been little\nprogress in reduction of caries.5 Hence,\nit is especially important to identify\nmodifiable risk factors for caries in this\ngroup.\nDental decay appears to be an infec-\ntious disease that involves coloniza-\ntion by Streptococcus mutans; these bac-\nteria produce lactic acid from the\nfermentation of carbohydrates, and the\nacid dissolves the surface structure of\nteeth.6 However, why some children are\nparticularly vulnerable to decay is\npoorly understood.7 We hypothesized\nthat environmental tobacco smoke\n(ETS), a common cause of pediatric\nmorbidity and mortality that dispro-\nportionately affects children in low so-\ncioeconomic status environments, may\nbe a risk factor for cavities.8-13 Environ-\nmental tobacco smoke has previously\nbeen shown to be associated with peri-\nodontal disease in adults.14 Moreover,\nthere are increasing experimental data\nsupporting the biological plausibility of\na causal role for ETS in caries forma-\ntion. Research indicates that the bac-\nteria responsible for caries formation are\nacquired in infancy from the saliva of\nmothers (via kissing, etc).7 Elsewhere,\nnicotine has been shown to promote the\ngrowth of cariogenic S mutans bacte-\nria in vitro; thus, mothers who smoke\nmay be more likely than nonsmokers\nto transmit these germs to their chil-\ndren.15 Environmental tobacco smoke\nhas immunosuppressive properties and\nis a known risk factor for infections of\nthe cranial organs (eg, otitis media);\nthus it is not surprising that it would\nbe a risk factor for caries develop-\nment, which is an oral infectious dis-\nease.16,17 In addition, ETS is associated\nwith decreased serum vitamin C lev-\nels in children and decreased levels of\nAuthor Affiliations: Pediathink, Rochester, NY (Dr\nAligne); Eastman School of Dentistry, Rochester, NY\n(Dr Moss); and Center for Child Health Research of\nthe American Academy of Pediatrics (Ms Auinger and\nDr Weitzman) and Departments of Community and\nPreventive Medicine (Dr Moss) and Pediatrics (Ms Au-\ninger and Dr Weitzman), University of Rochester School\nof Medicine, Rochester, NY.\nCorresponding Author and Reprints: C. Andrew\nContext Dental decay is the most common chronic disease of children and it dis-\nproportionately affects those living in poverty, but the reasons for this are not clear.\nPassive smoking may be a modifiable risk factor for dental caries.\nObjective To examine the relationship between dental caries and serum cotinine\nlevels.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional data from the Third National\nyears, who had had both dental examinations and a serum cotinine level measure-\nment.\nMain Outcome Measures Passive smoking defined as serum cotinine levels of 0.2\nto 10 ng/mL and caries defined as decayed (unfilled) or filled tooth surfaces.\nResults Twenty-five percent of the children had at least 1 unfilled decayed tooth\nsurface and 33% had at least 1 filled surface. Fifty-three percent had cotinine levels\nconsistent with passive smoking. Elevated cotinine level was significantly associated\nwith both decayed (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.9) and\nfilled (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1-1.8) tooth surfaces in deciduous but not in permanent\nteeth. This relationship persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, family income, geo-\ngraphic region, frequency of dental visits, and blood lead level. For dental caries in\ndeciduous teeth, the adjusted OR was 1.8 (95% CI, 1.2-2.7) for the risk of decayed\nsurfaces and 1.4 (95% CI, 1.1-2.0) for filled surfaces. We estimated the population\nattributable risk from passive smoking to be 27% for decayed and 14% for filled tooth\nsurfaces.\nConclusions There is an association between environmental tobacco smoke and risk\nof caries among children. Reduction of passive smoking is important not only for the\nprevention of many medical problems, but also for the promotion of children's dental\nhealth.\nvitamin C are associated with growth\nof cariogenic bacteria.18,19 Also, it is pos-\nsible that ETS may reduce the protec-\ntive properties of saliva that operate\nagainst caries--saliva acts as a buffer-\ning agent when acids are produced, it\nphysically removes debris from tooth\nsurfaces, and it has immunological and\nbacteriostatic properties.20 Environ-\nmental tobacco smoke is known to in-\ncrease inflammation of the respiratory\ntract, producing symptoms of various\nclinical conditions, including allergic\nrhinitis, which frequently cause mouth\nbreathing and thus result in dry mouth\n(ie, an effective decrease in saliva).21\nThus, ETS could promote dental de-\ncay both through a direct effect of nico-\ntine on caries-causing bacterial agents,\nas well as via other systemic physiologi-\ncal changes in the host.\nThe decline in caries among US chil-\ndren has occurred mainly in perma-\nnent and not deciduous teeth.7 If pas-\nsive smoking does cause caries, there\nare reasons to expect the effect to be\nmost pronounced in early childhood.\nColonization with the cariogenic S mu-\ntans is thought to occur during a win-\ndow of vulnerability around age 1 year,\nand primary teeth are particularly sus-\nceptible to caries formation soon after\ntheir eruption.6 One can also hypoth-\nesizespecificmechanismsbywhichETS\nexposure may be more likely to cause\ncaries in deciduous rather than in per-\nmanent teeth. For example, it is known\nthat the enamel in deciduous teeth is\nmuch thinner than in permanent teeth,\nand that enamel defects are associated\nwith caries.22 Also, maternal smoking\nis a principal risk factor for prematu-\nrity, low birth weight, and chronic ill-\nness in infancy, while these in turn are\nall associated with generalized enamel\nhypoplasia in the primary denti-\nhood, when the immune system is gen-\nerally less mature, the saliva is known\nto be different from that of adults with\nrespect to IgA concentrations; in addi-\ntion, salivary flow rate is lower.24 Young\nchildren may thus be particularly vul-\nnerable to the harmful effects of ETS on\nthe immune system and saliva flow.\nHence, it is it biologically plausible that\npassive smoking could cause caries, par-\nticularly in early childhood.\nThe purpose of this study was to ex-\namine the association between pas-\nsive smoking and dental caries by us-\ning data collected in the Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey (NHANES III), which includes a na-\ntionally representative sample of chil-\ndren who had both a complete dental\nexamination and a serum cotinine level\nmeasurement, which is an objective,\nquantitative biomarker of ETS.\nMETHODS\nsectional survey that includes personal\nhousehold interviews and health exami-\ndren aged 4 to 11 years. The household\ninterview collected demographic, socio-\neconomic,dietary,andhealthhistoryin-\nformation. The examination compo-\nnent consisted of physical and dental\nexaminations and various laboratory\ntests using blood and urine specimens.\nOnly children aged 4 years or older\nhad blood specimens for serum coti-\nnine level taken, so younger children\nwereexcludedfromtheseanalyses.Chil-\ndren aged 12 years or older were ex-\ncluded to reduce possible confusion re-\nsulting from early active smoking. For\nthe same reason, we also excluded chil-\ndren with a cotinine level higher than\nhad a cotinine level 10 ng/mL). A li-\ncensed dentist performed the dental ex-\namination. Details of the methods used\nin the oral health component of the\nsurvey have been published previ-\nwith at least 1 deciduous tooth, de-\ncayed and filled primary surfaces were\nanalyzed. We analyzed filled and un-\nfilled dental surfaces separately to help\nelucidate the interplay of access to den-\ntal care with environmental factors. The\ncategories were not mutually exclu-\nsive: a child could have both filled and\ndecayed (unfilled) surfaces. For per-\nsons aged 6 years or older with at least\n1 permanent tooth, the permanent sur-\nfaces were analyzed. For this study, sub-\njects were categorized as either having\nany caries or being caries-free.\nThe primary independent variable of\ninterest was ETS exposure as reflected\nby a serum cotinine level of 0.2 ng/mL\nor greater, but less than 10 ng/mL. This\ncutoff approximately divides the non-\nsmoking population into those with\nabove or below median ETS expo-\nsure.11 For the dose-response analysis,\nserum cotinine level was divided into 4\ncategories. A cotinine level of less than\n0.05 ng/mL was below the limit of de-\ntection;alevelof0.05ng/mLtolessthan\n0.2 ng/mL was considered low expo-\nerate exposure; and a level greater than\n1, high exposure. Other potential inde-\npendent associations with dental caries\nwere analyzed, including the subjects'\nage, sex, race, socioeconomic status, re-\ngionofresidence,educationlevelofhead\nof household, blood lead level, use of\ndental services, and sugar intake. Low\nsocioeconomic status was defined as a\npoverty income ratio below 2. The pov-\nerty income ratio is the total family in-\ncomedividedbythefederalpovertylevel\nfor the year of the interview. This defi-\nnition of poverty was used because,\nbased on previous NHANES III stud-\nies, it is a good cutoff for pediatric car-\nies risk.28 Use of oral health services was\ndetermined by the length of time since\nthe last visit to a dentist. Caries forma-\ntion may be related to prolonged expo-\nsure to carbohydrates, especially su-\ncrose.29 As there is no recommended\ndaily intake of candy, we defined high\nsugar intake as at or above the median\nof 45.3 g/d. NHANES III also includes\nvariables for parental report of prenatal\nor postnatal smoking. We verified that\nthese variables also demonstrated a sig-\nnificant association with caries, but re-\nstricted the analyses to the use of se-\nrumcotininelevelasthemeasureofETS\nexposure because it is objective and\nquantitative.\nBivariate (unadjusted) analyses were\nconducted to determine associations\nwith caries status. Variables found to\nbe statistically significant based on the\n2 test were included in logistic regres-\nsion analyses to determine indepen-\ndent associations with caries-free sta-\ntus. Performing the analyses with\ncotinine level as a continuous (as op-\nposed to a categorical) variable did not\nsubstantively change the findings. Vari-\nables in the logistic regression models\nwere screened for colinearity by exam-\nining correlation coefficients in bivar-\niate analyses. SUDAAN software was\nused to account for the complex mul-\ntistage sampling design of the sur-\nvey.30 Sample weights were used to pro-\nduce national estimates by adjusting for\nthe oversampling of young children and\nolder adults as well as for Mexican\nAmerican and black individuals. P.05\nwas the level of significance.\nPopulation attributable risk esti-\nmates were derived using the Levin for-\nmula\nPopulation Attributable Risk =\n[Prevalence  (Relative Risk - 1)]\n[1 + (Prevalence  {Relative Risk - 1})]\nin which prevalence is the prevalence\nof exposure to the risk factor in the\npopulation.31 Relative risk is esti-\nmated from the observed odds ratio\n(OR) using the method of Zhang and\nYu.32 The following prevalence data spe-\ncific to this population sample were\nused in the population attributable risk\ncalculations: ETS exposure of 53%, de-\ncayed primary surfaces in unexposed\nchildren of 18.2%, and filled surfaces\nRESULTS\nyears were included in the analysis; of\nof these children had cotinine levels\nconsistent with ETS exposure, 46.7%\nfaces in primary teeth, and 26.2%\nfaces in permanent teeth.\nInbivariateanalyses,weexaminedthe\nassociationofcotininelevelandotherpo-\ntential risk factors with the occurrence\nof caries in deciduous and permanent\nteeth (TABLE 1). There were statisti-\ncallysignificantassociationsbetweense-\nrum cotinine level and caries in decidu-\nous teeth. The OR for decayed surfaces\nfilled surfaces. In addition to cotinine\nlevel, poverty and low level of educa-\ntion of household head were signifi-\ncantly associated with increased risk of\nboth decayed and filled teeth.

Age was significantly related to the\nrisk of both decayed and filled surfaces.\nThe logistic regression analyses ad-\njusted for age, race/ethnicity, level of\neducation of household head, pov-\nerty, blood lead level, days since last\ndental visit, and geographic region\n(TABLE 2). Sugar intake and sex were\nnot included in the multivariate mod-\nels since they were not significant fac-\ntors in bivariate analyses. Testing for\ncolinearity revealed no significant re-\nlationships between variables in-\ncluded in the logistic regression model.\nCotinine level remained a signifi-\ncant predictor of caries in deciduous\nteeth. Adjusted OR for decayed sur-\nerty was the only other variable that re-\nmained a significant independent risk\nfactor for both decayed and filled sur-\nfaces. Underuse of dental services was\nsignificantly associated with more de-\ncayed surfaces and with fewer fillings.\nThe association between low educa-\ntional level of the household head and\ndecayedorfilledsurfacesdidnotachieve\nstatistical significance. Mexican Ameri-\ncan ethnicity was associated with more\ndecayedsurfaces,whereasblackracewas\nassociated with a significantly de-\ncreased number of fillings. Residence in\nthe West was weakly associated with\nmore fillings but not with more de-\ncayed surfaces. Age was not related to\nthe risk of decayed surfaces, but older\nchildren were more likely to have more\nfillings.Elevatedbloodleadlevelwasnot\nsignificantly related to decayed sur-\nfaces and was associated with a signifi-\ncant decrease in the risk of fillings. Ana-\nlyzing for interactions revealed that the\neffect of tobacco was neither increased\nnor decreased by having an elevated\nblood lead level.\nFor permanent teeth, in the ad-\njusted analyses, ETS was still not a sig-\nnificant risk factor for caries, nor were\npoverty, region of residence, or el-\nevated blood lead level. Nonwhite chil-\ndren were significantly more likely to\nhave decayed surfaces, but black chil-\ndren were significantly less likely to\nhave fillings, as were children who had\nnot seen a dentist in the past year. Low\neducation level of household head was\nsignificantly associated with fillings.\nThe likelihood of both decayed and\nfilled surfaces increased with age.\nFor caries risk in deciduous teeth,\nthere was evidence suggestive of a dose-\nresponse trend (TABLE 3). With se-\nrum cotinine level divided into 4 cat-\negories (rather than 2 as above), we\nfound that in general, as ETS in-\ncreased, so did the risk of caries. The\ntrend for unfilled surfaces persisted af-\nter adjusting for the subjects' age, race,\nfamily income, geographic region of\nresidence, education level of head of\nhousehold, blood lead level, and den-\ntal service use across all 4 cotinine lev-\nels. For filled surfaces, the trend was\nsuggested for the first 3 categories, but\nnot for the highest cotinine level.\nBased on the ORs reported in Table\n2 for the association of risk between co-\ntinine level and caries, the population\nattributable risk is estimated to be 27%\nfor unfilled caries occurrence in de-\nciduous teeth. In other words, a quar-\nter of the children who have caries in\ndeciduous teeth could be caries-free if\nETS exposure were eliminated.

In addition, there may be an-\nother explanation for filled surfaces.\nFilled status is determined not only by\nbiological formation of caries, but also\nby subsequent dental care. Hence, the\ndose-responserelationshipbetweenETS\nand caries formation may be masked if\nfamilies allow their children to be ex-\nposed to very high levels of ETS and also\nfail to take their children in for dental\nvisits to get fillings.

The cross-\nsectional nature of the data also im-\nposes limitations on the ability to test\nmechanism-specific hypotheses.38 For\nexample, if ETS exposure at the time\nof enamel formation is the most rel-\nevant mechanism, ideally one would\nneed to analyze cotinine levels during\ninfancy. We did not have data on co-\ntinine levels for children younger than\n4 years, and do not know if current co-\ntinine levels are good estimates of ETS\nexposure in infancy. Our finding that\nETS was associated with caries in de-\nciduous but not permanent teeth is con-\nsistent with the hypothesis that expo-\nsure in early life is important for the\neffect on dental health. The study re-\nsults are consistent with what is known\nregarding the pathophysiological char-\nacteristics of caries formation and are\ntherefore biologically plausible.\nNevertheless, the main difficulty with\ninterpreting this study is the possibility\nthat serum cotinine level is simply a\nmarker for some unmeasured true cause\nof caries formation. For example, be-\ncause smoking is an unhealthy behav-\nior, it could be that parents who smoke\nalso practice other unhealthy behav-\niors that would put their children at risk\nfor cavities (eg, not brushing teeth, not\nusing fluoride toothpaste, not going to\nthe dentist, eating too much candy, etc).\nUnfortunately, NHANES III does not in-\nclude a variable for tooth brushing or\nother oral hygiene practices. We at-\ntempted to control for inadequate den-\ntal care by including a variable for use\nof dental services. Rarity of dental vis-\nits was a predictor of fewer fillings, but\nit was not related to decayed surfaces.\nCotininelevelremainedasignificantpre-\ndictor of both decayed and filled sur-\nfaces, even after including this variable\nintheregressionmodel.Thefindingthat\nlevel of parental education dropped out\nof the model also argues against ETS\nbeing merely a marker for health behav-\niors associated with low socioeco-\nnomic status. Although there is a popu-\nlar perception that cavities are caused\nprimarily by excessive dietary sugar, our\nfinding that sucrose intake was not re-\nlated to caries prevalence is consistent\nwith the scientific literature on the\nplies serve the same water to individu-\nals with a range of tobacco exposure lev-\nels, one must also consider whether\ntobacco exposure is simply a marker for\nresidence in an area that is not served\nby fluoridated drinking water, inas-\nmuch as fluoride exposure is strongly\nlinked to dental caries risk.2 However,\nETS exposure is highest in urban areas,\nand that is where people are most likely\nto have fluoridated water.2,12 NHANES\nIIIdoesnotprovideinformationonfluo-\nrideexposure,sofurtherstudyisneeded\nto resolve this issue. Overall though, it\nappears that ETS is not simply a marker\nfor poor dental health behaviors or for\nlack of fluoride.\nIn addition to the need for more com-\nprehensive information on risk factors\nfor caries, one of the limitations of this\nstudy is the age of the data. However,\nthese are the most recent NHANES oral\nhealth data available, and there exists a\ngeneral consensus that early childhood\ncaries in poor children remains a major\nproblem.2 For cotinine level though,\nthere are more recent national data, and\nthese indicate that despite reductions in\nsmoking in the overall population, the\nproportion of US children exposed to\nlikely due to the ubiquity of tobacco\nsmoke exposure in urban environ-\nments(evenforchildrenwithnonsmok-\ningparents),andthefactthatchildren--\nespecially preschool age children--are\ndisproportionately affected by pov-\nfindings presented here regarding den-\ntal decay, child poverty, and tobacco\nsmoke exposure are, unfortunately, still\nrelevant.\nSmall geographic differences in the\nprevalence of dental caries in US school-\nchildren have been previously re-\nported.41 Inourunadjustedanalysis,resi-\ndence in the South was associated with\nhighercariesprevalence,althoughtheas-\nsociation was not significant in the mul-\ntivariate model. Given that children in\nthe South have an above average preva-\nlence of exposure to ETS, these results\nare consistent with the hypothesis that\npassive smoking plays a role in the geo-\ngraphic variation in caries prevalence.42\nHowever, NHANES III was not de-\nsigned to account for seasonal variation\nin ETS exposure, and this may intro-\nduce measurement error in the assess-\nment of regional patterns. For practical\nreasons, the mobile examination cen-\nterssampledindividualsfromtheNorth-\neast and Midwest during summer\nmonths and in the West and South dur-\ning winter months.43 This arrangement\ntendstominimizeobservedcotininelev-\nels (because people spend more time in-\ndoors in extreme cold or hot weather\nthan at other times, and ETS exposure\nis higher indoors than outdoors).44\nAnother bias in our study that would\ntendtoclassifyexposedchildrenasunex-\nposedandthusreducetheobservedORs\nis the cotinine level cutoff of 0.2 ng/mL\nused to define ETS exposure. This is a\nconservativedefinitionoftheupperlimit\nof nonexposure as it represents a level\nthat is well above the limit of detection\nwith the technique used in NHANES III\n(0.05 ng/mL), and it corresponds to a\nmedium low exposure level, slightly\nlower than the median cotinine level\nthe use of lower cutoffs in the dose-\nresponse analysis yielded higher ORs.\nThe association between poverty sta-\ntus and dental caries in the NHANES III\ndata has been the topic of a previous\nstudy: as family income increased, chil-\ndren were less likely to have any de-\ncayed teeth.28 The finding that poverty\nremains a significant predictor of de-\ncay and fillings after controlling for ETS\nsuggests that there are other unmea-\nsuredaspectsofpovertythatincreasethe\nformation of caries. In addition, pov-\nerty remains an important determinant\nof reduced access to dental care.47 The\nincreased risk of caries in Mexican\nAmerican children is consistent with\nprevious reports.28 Black children, along\nwith children with infrequent visits to\nthe dentist, were significantly less likely\nto have fillings despite being more likely\ntoexperiencedecay--thissuggestsagap\nin access to dental care for black chil-\ndren, which is also consistent with the\nrecent literature.48\nElevated blood lead level did not\nincrease the risk of decay and was\nalso significantly associated with\ndecreased odds of having fillings.\nHowever, a previous study that found\nan association between blood lead\nlevel and caries used different meth-\nods that might be more sensitive for\ndetecting an association with blood\nlead level.49 The relationship between\nblood lead level and caries requires\nfurther study.\nThese findings underscore the need\nfor further investigation of risk factors\nforcaries formation, especially in early\nchildhood. Future studies of the bio-\nlogical effects of ETS and other pollut-\nants should examine oral health out-\ncomes, such as caries. If a causal\nassociation between passive smoking\nand dental caries is substantiated, then\nhealth interventions for dental caries\nshould include strategies to reduce ETS\nexposure. These results provide one\nmore piece of evidence indicating that\npassive smoking is harmful and that all\nchildren should be allowed to grow up\nin a smoke-free environment.50\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design:\nAligne, Weitzman.\nAcquisition of data: Auinger.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Aligne, Moss,\nAuinger, Weitzman.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Aligne.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important\nintellectual content: Aligne, Moss, Auinger, Weitzman.\nStatistical expertise: Aligne, Moss, Auinger.\nObtained funding: Aligne.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support:\nWeitzman.\nStudy supervision: Aligne.\nFunding/Support: This research was partially sup-\nported by a Special Projects grant from the Agency\nfor Healthcare Research and Quality and the Ambu-\nlatory Pediatric Association, and by the Monroe County\nSmoking and Health Action Coalition of the New York\nState Department of Health.\nREFERENCES\n1.
