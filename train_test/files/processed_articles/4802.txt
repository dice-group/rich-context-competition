As an interdisciplinary\nlaboratory associating social scientists, code developers and information designers, the me\n\u00b4dialab is not one of a kind.\nIn the last years, several of such initiatives have been established around the world to harness the potential of digital\ntechnologies for the study of collective life. If we narrate this particular story, it is because, having lived it from the inside,\nwe can provide an intimate account of the surprises and displacements of digital research. Founding the me\nwe knew that we were leaving the reassuring traditions of social sciences to venture in the unexplored territory of digital\ninscriptions. What we couldn't foresee was how much such encounter would change our research. Buying into gospel of\nBig Data, we imagined that the main novelty of digital research came from handling larger amounts of data. We soon\nrealized that the interest of digital inscriptions comes instead from their proliferating diversity. Such diversity encouraged\nus to reshape our professional alliances, research practices and theoretical perspectives. It also led us to overcome\nseveral of the oppositions that used to characterize social sciences (qualitative/quantitative, situation/aggregation, micro/\nmacro, local/global) and to move in the direction of a more continuous sociology.\n",

The me\n\u00b4 dialab of Sciences Po\nis only one of these initiatives. In this article, we will\nfocus on its story not because it is unique, but because it\nwill help us to narrate the peculiar way in which the\nencounter with `the digital' has affected our research.\nThe tone of our text will be rather intimate. We are\nless interested here in proposing concepts or techniques\nthat in conveying the peculiar atmosphere that charac-\nterizes these early years of digital methods (see Latour\net al., 2012, for a more theoretical outlook). Richard\nRogers, one of the protagonist of this movement,\nargued that digital methods are about `re-purposing'\nnew media for social investigation (Rogers, 2013).\nWhile this is true, it is also interesting to appreciate\nhow digital techniques have repurposed social research\nin return. This article narrates the story of this repur-\nposing and leads the reader through the encounters\nthat, in the first years of the me\n\u00b4 dialab, changed our\nway of doing social research. Through its three sec-\ntions, the article discusses how the digital transformed\nour relation to the data, the methods and the theory of\nsocial research.\nWhile none of these transformations is entirely new,\nthe way in which the me\n\u00b4 dialab weaved them in a coher-\nent narrative is, we believe, original. The fil rouge (the\nguiding thread) of this narrative is the way in which\ndigital technologies displace and eventually dissolve\nthe classic distinctions of our discipline: qualitative/\nquantitative in data, situation/aggregation in methods\nand micro/macro in theory. Encounter after encounter,\nour unexpected journey brought us beyond such dis-\ntinctions, toward a more `continuous sociology'.\nA last note on style: in this article, we make an abun-\ndant use of metaphors and not by chance. The trans-\nformations that digital methods are encouraging are\ndeep but still unaccomplished. Different approaches\nstill co-exist and their outcomes can be varied. This\nopenness is one of the things that we like the most\nabout our field and we do not want to close it too\nsoon or too much. Metaphors will allow us to provide\na sense of where digital research is heading while leav-\ning open the range of possible explorations.\nThree displacements of digital traces\n(continuity in data)\nWhen the Sciences Po me\n\u00b4 dialab left the harbor in May\n2009, we all had in mind stories of the miraculous\ndraught of digital data. Having heard our fair share\nof Big Data tales, we cast our nets in the digital sea\nand waited for the miracle. Withdrawing our nets, how-\never, we found them full to the brim, but not of data.\nWhat we got was instead a catch of digital traces, dif-\nferent from the Big Data in at least three respects. (1)\nThe main novelty of digital technologies is their\nincreased traceability, (2) which does not zero the cost\nof social data, (3) but augment their diversity. We will\ndescribe these three displacements as we experienced\nthem at the me\n\u00b4 dialab, but others scholars have pro-\nvided similar accounts (see, for example, Bollier and\n(1) By `digital traces', we intend loosely all the\ninscriptions produced by digital devices in their medi-\nation of collective actions \u00ad for instance, a post pub-\nlished on a blog, a hyperlink connecting two websites or\nthe log of an e-commerce transaction. Though the\nterms `inscriptions', `traces' and `data' are often used\nas synonyms, it is here important to distinguish their\ndifferent meanings.\n`Inscription' is the more general terms and it refers to\nany piece of information that is materialized through a\ntechnical device (digital or not). Inscriptions are the\nfoundation of any scientific enterprise for they allow\nto imprint knowledge on material supports, which can\nbe stored, transformed and transmitted (Latour, 1983,\nural and social researches, inscriptions are produced by\ndevices specifically set up for this intent. Sometime,\nhowever, inscriptions are produced by other purposes\nand become object of scientific enquiry only later. This\nis distinctively the case for digital research, which is\noften performed as a form of secondary analysis of\ninscriptions produced for marketing, surveillance or\ntechnical purposes (cf. Ruppert et al., 2013).\nThe practice of using second-hand inscriptions for\nsocial investigation does not start with digital media.\nSince the invention of writing and increasingly with\nthe introduction of the alphabet, the printing press,\nthe broadcast media and the communication technolo-\ngies in general, our collective life is organized through a\nweb of material inscriptions. And, since their founda-\ntion, social sciences have exploited such inscriptions for\ntheir research. In this sense, there is nothing new about\ndigital media (Boullier, 2015), except for the amplifica-\ntion that they impose to such process (in line with\nMcLuhan, 1964, hypothesis of media acceleration).\nAs social sciences are concerned, the main novelty of\ndigital media is to have assembled an unprecedentedly\nextensive ensemble of inscribing infrastructure (Bowker\nSuch crucial novelty was initially overlooked by\nsocial sciences. Opposing `the virtual' to `the material',\nearly media scholars regarded to electronic networks as\na new terrain for old methods. Notions such as `cyber-\nculture' (Negroponte, 1995), `virtual communities'\nwere introduced to channel the novelty of new media\nwithin the tradition of social sciences (Rogers,\n2 Big Data & Society\nthe most interesting feature of electronic media: the\nfact that, far from making social relations more vir-\ntual, they multiply their material inscriptions. Passing\nthrough routers, cables, databases, our associations\nleave traces that can be easily recorded, massively con-\nserved and instantly retrieved:\nOnce you can get information as bores, bytes, modem,\nsockets, cables and so on, you have actually a more\nmaterial way of looking at what happens in Society.\nVirtual Society thus, is not a thing of the future, it's\nthe materialisation, the traceability of Society. It ren-\nders visible because of the obsessive necessity of mate-\nrialising information into cables. (Latour, 1998)\n(2) As digital media increase the traceability of collect-\nive phenomena, our initial Big Data enthusiasm seemed\njustified. As we soon realized, however, the prolifer-\nation of digital inscriptions is not per se a gain for the\nsocial sciences. Here is where we need to distinguish\nbetween `digital traces' and `digital data'. With the\nterm traces, we refer to inscriptions as originally pro-\nduced by digital devices (e.g., a hyperlink as stored in a\nHTML code of a web page). With the term data, we\nrefer to the same inscriptions having undergone the\ncleaning and refining necessary to make them useful\nknowledge objects (e.g., our hyperlink as translated in\nan edge of a website network).\nWhile such distinction is somewhat artificial (there\nare no such things as `raw traces' and all inscription\nprocesses entail adjustments and correction), it has\nthe advantage of drawing attention to the multiple\ntransformations that inscriptions must undergo before\nthey can be exploited (see Bachelard, 1949, on `evidence\nwork' and Cardon, 2013, on `digital evidence work').\nIn the case of digital methods, much of this process\nhappens outside the academia, with bias that digital\nresearchers are forced to inherit. The problem with digi-\ntal data is not that they are biased (all data is). It is that\nthe control that social scientists can exert on their bias\nis remarkably poor (Savage and Burrows, 2007).\nDigital data is still at an early stage in the process of\nsociological validation and should therefore be used\nwith caution and never without investigating the con-\nditions of their fabrication (Marres and Gerlitz, 2016).\nTo be exploited in research, digital data needs to be\ndetached from their original contexts and refitted for\nresearch. Such `repurposing' work (Rogers, 2013)\nrequires significant efforts and specific expertise. This\nis why the Sciences Po me\n\u00b4 dialab could not exist without\nits data experts. Digital media are undoubtedly a fertile\nground, but they yield nothing if they are not skillfully\nlabored. Engineers, computer scientists, developers,\ndata geeks know how to nurture this kind of data in\nways that social scientists still have to learn. Also,\nbeing more familiar with digital technologies, they are\nalso more resistant to technological hype. Being\nacquainted to the hardships of `data friction'\n(Edwards, 2010), they know that only a little fraction\nof digital inscriptions will transmute into usable data\nand only through a good deal of their work.\n(3) Left as adventurers of the digital El Dorado, we\nsettled as data farmers. We learned that information\ninfrastructures pay the costs of the inscription of digital\ntraces, but not those of their transformation into socio-\nlogical data. `More traces', therefore, does not mean\n`more data', but more sources from which data can\nbe extracted. At the beginning of our adventure, we\nneglected such crucial distinction and paid the conse-\nquences in our choice of sources. Like kids in a toy\nstore, we went for the biggest. We coveted the huge\nreservoirs of Web 2.0 platforms, and forgot that the\nlargest sources are not always the most valuable.\nPlatforms such as Google, Facebook or Wikipedia do\nproduce large quantities of traces (and do re-distribute\nsome of them). Yet, such abundance of traces does not\nalways convert into valuable data (Lazer et al., 2014)\nand mainstream social media are not always the most\ninteresting sources. Google is ideal for studying the flow\nof online attention (Choi and Varian, 2009); Facebook\nis a decent proxy of Web sociability (Rieder, 2013);\nWikipedia is great for studying knowledge debates\nnone of them can answer all the questions of the\nsocial sciences. Nor should they: there are more things\nin Internet and the Web (Horatio) than are indexed in\nyour social media! Seen from the outside, the jungle of\ndigital inscription meets the eye for its extension. But\nfrom the inside, its most amazing feature is the stunning\ndiversity of the species that it shelters.\nAn example comes from a research that the me\n\u00b4 dialab\ncarried out on the international negotiations on climate\nchange. In two projects dedicated to the climate debate\n(www.emapsproject.com and projetmedea.hypothese-\ns.org), we were looking for information on the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC). Conventional data on such negotiations\nare available through the reports of ethnographers\nand through the UNFCCC documents archive\n(unfccc.int). Such data allows investigating respectively\nthe detail of diplomatic practices and the overall struc-\nture of the climate regime, but not the connection\nbetween the two. Moving in controversy analysis trad-\nwe wanted to follow the rise and fall of issues; the\nforming of alliances and oppositions; and the position-\ning of delegations on items of the climate agenda.\nWe wanted to observe the dynamics of the `diplomatic\nballet' and the complex arrangements produced by such\ndynamics.\nVenturini et al. 3\nTo follow these discursive actions, we first thought\nof exploiting Twitter and investigate climate talks\nthrough the messages exchanged by negotiators and\npolicy-makers. Despite the existence of a remarkable\nproject by UN Climate Change Secretariat (climate-\ntalkslive.org), we found Twitter traces disappointing.\nSuch traces were indeed massive (with thousands of\nmessages exchanged every day), but they shed little\nlight on the negotiations. Tweets are just too short to\nconvey the subtleties of climate diplomacy and are gen-\nerally addressed to the public more than to other nego-\ntiators. They allowed us to extract the general agendas\npushed by different countries (and their reception by\nthe media), but not to follow the negotiation dynamics.\nSo, we looked further and came across the Earth\nNegotiation Bulletin (www.iisd.ca/vol12), compiled by\nthe International Institute for Sustainable Development\n(IISD). The ENB reports on all UN negotiations cover-\ning both the official proceedings and the discussions in\nthe corridors. The ENB can hardly be called Big Data.\nIts traces are neither big (the volume dedicated to\nclimate negotiations contains about 600 issues of a\nfew pages each) nor `natively digital' (the reports are\nfirst distributed in paper to the negotiators and then\narchived on the IISD website). The ENB inscriptions\nare not as rich as ethnographic observations (the\nreports iron out all nuances to propose a dry para-\nphrasing of the arguments exchanged) and not as exten-\nsive as the UNFCCC archive (the reports cover the\npositions taken in the meetings, but disregard the\nmaterials submitted by parties or produced by bodies\nof the Convention). Yet, the ENB traces have enough\nbreadth to follow climate debate throughout the two\ndecades of the UNFCCC negotiations and enough\ndepth to identify single diplomatic moves (cf.\nVenturini et al., 2014a, and climatenegotiations.org).\nOf course, this comes at a price. The ENB reports\nare not written for scholars, but for negotiators. Each\nissue summarizes one day of negotiations, compiling in\none document different tracks and formats that\nresearchers might want to separate (e.g., IPCC debates\ncannot be studied in the same way as UNFCCC's; dis-\ncussions in the corridors demand a different treatment\nthan talks in the plenaries). Also, the ENB reports\ninclude `duplicates' in the form of summaries of the\n`previous episodes' and analyses of the negotiations.\nExploiting the ENB traces demanded therefore an\nextensive work of cleaning and refining that ended up\noccupying most of our project time.\nThe ENB corpus thus illustrates the three displace-\nments characteristic of digital traces: (1) it is not larger\nor more detailed than traditional datasets; (2) it\ndemands a thorough refinement before it can be used\nfor research; (3) but it allows investigating climate\nnegotiations in breadth and depth. This third\ndisplacement is, we believe, the most important. As\nwe said, digital data is not necessary more abundant\nthan their predecessors and they are certainly not clea-\nner or cheaper. They are, however, more diverse and\nmore evenly distributed across the span of collective\nexistence of which they therefore offer a more continu-\nous appraisal.\nDatascape navigation\n(continuity in methods)\nThe diversity of digital traces holds great potential, but\nit also demands to rethink our methods and, in particu-\nlar, the classic opposition between qualitative and\nquantitative approaches. In our sociological training,\nwe learned that knowledge can be obtained by two\nopposite strategies: either by focusing on particular\nevents and collecting as much information as possible;\nor by selecting specific bits of information and harvest-\ning them through time and space. Through qualitative\nmethods, we learned to examine local interactions.\nThrough quantitative methods, we learned to skim\nover global trends. Both strategies are undeniably pro-\nductive in their sphere and most scholars are capable to\nalternate and mix them. Yet, the discontinuity between\nthe two types of methods generated a blind spot in our\nvision. We can glance at the global picture and examine\neach piece of interaction, but we cannot observe how\nthe puzzle of collective life is put together.\nThe arrival of digital traceability may bridge such\ndiscontinuity by generating information on an increas-\ning variety of phenomena and, most importantly, at a\nvariety of scales. By their proliferating diversity, digital\ntraces diffract so much the perspectives of social\nresearch and dissolve traditional oppositions (Latour\net al., 2012). In this sense, our approach may be\ncalled `quali-quantitative' (Venturini et al., 2015a),\nbut the label is inappropriate as digital methods do\nnot lie between qualitative and quantitative methods.\nNor do they get the best of both worlds: the quantity\nof digital data is not always larger than traditional\nstatistics and their quality is often inferior to ethno-\ngraphic observations. Yet, the more the digital media\ninfiltrate collective life, the more varied become the\ntraces that social scientists can exploit. The following\nfigure tries to render this idea. It is far too simplistic,\nbut has one quality: instead of representing the classic\nquali/quantitative continuum, it outlines a space in\nwhich inscriptions distribute unevenly but not binarily\n(Figure 1).\nLooking at the figure below, readers will remark that\ndata (i.e., inscriptions refined to serve as basis for\nresearch) tend to be more polarized than inscriptions\nand have a more skewed coverage of the social space.\nNot only traditional methods start from different types\n4 Big Data & Society\nof inscriptions, but they also refine them in opposite\ndirections. Most traditional research protocols are uni-\ndirectional: they have been sharpened to produce more\nsituation or more aggregation. Situated observation\nallows preserving the full richness of the situation, but\nentails renouncing to follow the influences that associ-\nate `here and now' to other times and places.\nAggregation allows extending the scope of sociological\nvision, but demands focusing on specific observables\n(e.g., not persons in their full complexity, but say\ntheir age or income) and concentrating on regularities\nrather than exceptions.\nPart of the discontinuity between situation and\naggregation derives from the difficulty of rewinding\nsuch procedures and to reverse the transformations\nthat they operate. To be sure, good researchers have\nalways provided their readers the means to reverse\ntheir protocols (Latour, 1995). Yet, before digitaliza-\ntion, the variety of research devices (notepads, audio\nand video recorders, questionnaires, data tables, type-\nwritten reports, calculators, printed texts, etc.) made\nreversing objectively difficult. Disaggregating a statis-\ntical chart entailed, for instance, moving from the\nchart to the calculator, from the calculator to the\ndata table, from the table to the research notebook,\nfrom the notebook to the sample and from the\nsample to the actual phenomenon. With the advent of\ndigital technologies, an increasing number of research\ntransformations take place in the same personal com-\nputers. This does not mean, of course, that such trans-\nformations have got any easier. It means, however, that\nthey can be made reversible with reasonable effort.\nUnfortunately, this opportunity is not always\nexploited and too often the technical expertise required\nby digital methods becomes an extra obstacle to the\nrewinding of research procedures. This is why, particu-\nlarly in digital research, findings should always be\naccompanied by the data on which they are based,\nthe traces from which this data is extracted and the\nscripts that allowed the extraction (cf. Ince et al.,\nRo\n\u00a8 hle (2012) encourage digital researchers to comple-\nment their articles with a `companion web-site':\nSuch a website could further document methodological\nchoices, provide in-depth information on technical\naspects, and, if possible, source code. It could also, as\npart of a data-sharing plan, provide access to the `raw'\ndata that went into the project, allowing other research-\ners to experiment with different approaches and arrive\nat different results. Also, a companion website seems\nlike an ideal vehicle to present results more dynamically\nand interactively. Instead of providing the research\nresults as a closed, finished product, Web-based inter-\nfaces could allow audiences to explore them both\ninductively and deductively, involving them in the pro-\ncess of knowledge production. (pp.80,81)\nA more reversible digital publication not only\nimproves transparency and replicability, but transforms\nthe way we read, write and design research. A good\ndigital research does more than catering a series of\nresults to its readers, it provides them interfaces to navi-\ngate through the inscriptions.\nThis was never clearer to us than in an investigation\nthat the me\n\u00b4 dialab carried out on French parliamentary\nsystem (but see another example of our work in\nLeclercq, 2017). In such investigation, we were working\nwith political scientists to assess how much French laws\nare substantially amended through parliamentary dis-\ncussions. Both qualitative and quantitative methods\nseemed unfit for the project. We could have dissected\nthe parliamentary journey of a few bills to examine\ntheir transformation, but how to know if findings\ncould be generalized? And we could have devised\nsome statistical measures of parliamentary transform-\nation and compute them for all French laws, but how to\nknow whether those metrics were not too simplistic\n(and capable to differentiate substantial from cosmetic\nmodifications)?\nEventually, we created an online platform to explore\nthe details some 300 laws proposals (www.lafabrique-\ndelaloi.fr). The platform allows comparing how long\ndifferent laws were discussed in different branch of\nthe parliament and how many words were changed\nthrough such discussion (see Figure 2(a)); identifying\nhow much each article of each law has been modified\nat each passage (see Figure 2(b)); considering all the\namendments proposed by different political groups\n(see Figure 2(c)); and reading the transcription of\neach word spoken by each parliament member on\neach specific article at each stage of the discussion\n(see Figure 2(d)).\nFigure 1. Distribution of traditional inscriptions (blurred black\ncircles), traditional data (clear black circle), digital traces (blurred\ngrey squares) and digital data (clear grey square).\nVenturini et al. 5\nThe development of such platform marked the me\n\u00b4 d-\nialab more than we expected (Venturini, 2017).\nBuilding ways to move from the most aggregated over-\nviews to the debates' minutes (and back), we felt the\ndiscontinuity of social sciences fading away. Not only\nwe encountered little opposition between the quality\nand the quantity of our data (parliamentary logs offer\none and the other, provided that one is willing to invest\nthe efforts to mine and refine them), but we also rea-\nlized that situation and aggregation could happily coex-\nist as functions of the same digital platform. Datascape\nnavigation (as call this experience) recognizes the\nimportance of both the examination of specificities\nand the generalization of trends, but instead of looking\nfor a balance or compromise, it aims facilitating the\nmovement between the two. And this is where the jour-\nney of the me\n\u00b4 dialab met another type of expertise:\nbesides social scientists and developers, our team\ncame to include designers.\nUnlike quantitative methods, the purpose of our\nresearch is not to deliver stable findings to its readers\nand, unlike qualitative methods, it is not to immerse\nthem in specific situations. Its purpose is to offer its\nreaders (but `users' would be a more appropriate\nterm) interfaces to browse large datasets and identify\ninteresting data points. And this is where the help of\ninterface design and information design (Bertin, 1967;\nTufte, 1983) comes in handy. By multiplying the oper-\nations that users can perform on digital inscriptions,\ndatascape design dissolves the discontinuity between\nsituation and aggregation. Not only by finding ways\nof reconciling these movements, but also by showing\nthey are only two among the many ways of navigating\nthrough data. In this sense, quali-quantitative methods\nare utterly different from `mixed methods' (Johnson\nand Onwuegbuzie, 2004). Our objective is not to com-\nbine qualitative and quantitative techniques, but to\novercome their opposition altogether, drawing on the\nincreased diversity of data to promote a greater diver-\nsity of methods. We as are interested in alternating situ-\nation and aggregation, then in exploring other\nnavigational operations such as highlighting, sorting,\nfiltering, zooming, selecting, comparing, link surfing\nand annotating (cf. Heer and Shneiderman, 2012;\nIf all these operations existed before computers, their\ndigital instantiation has greatly increased the ease with\nwhich they can be performed. In a sense, datascape\nnavigation materializes the dream of the Exploratory\nData Analysis (Behrens and Chong-Ho, 2003; Tukey,\n1977) but also its nightmare \u00ad the risk that more explor-\nation possibilities might end up producing greater dis-\norientation. Over-complicated dashboards only add an\n`interface overload' to the `information overload'\nalready experienced by digital researchers. This is why\nthe contribution of designers is crucial to carefully\nselect and combine different forms of navigation into\nmeaningful forms of data exploration.\nFigure 2. Four interfaces in La Fabrique de la Loi project (http://www.lafabriquedelaloi.fr/).\n6 Big Data & Society\nBeyond micro and macro\n(continuity in theory)\nThe dissolution of the quali/quantitative divide encour-\naged us to take one step further and rethink the theor-\netical opposition between individual actors and social\ncollectives, micro-interactions and macro-structures.\nCentral in social research at least from Durkheim\n(even indispensable) when the separation between\nqualitative and quantitative methods pulled research\nin opposite directions. It provided a handy conceptual-\nization of the two types of phenomena that situation\nand aggregation can best describe, respectively, local\nand ephemeral exchanges and global and enduring\ntrends. However, as digital traceability and datascape\nnavigation makes data and methods more continuous,\nthe micro/macro distinction appears less significant.\nThe best proof that those two levels do not correspond\nto any real ontological domains is that they begin\nto disappear, to be literally redistributed, every time\none modifies or enhances the quality of access to the\ndatasets, thereby allowing the observer to define any\nactor by its network and vice versa. This is exactly\nwhat the striking extension of digital tools is doing\nto the very notions of `individual' and `wholes'.\nThe experience (more and more common nowadays)\nof navigating on a screen from elements to aggregates\nmay lead researchers to grant less importance to\nthose two provisional end points. Instead of having\nto choose and thus to jump from individuals to\nwholes, from micro to macro, you occupy all sorts of\nother positions, constantly rearranging the way pro-\nfiles are interconnected and overlapping. (Latour\nDigital research dissolves in practice a distinction\nthat we still struggle to overcome in theory.\nFollowing the lead of its founder (Latour, 2005) and\nthe lesson of Actor-Network Theory (Law and\n\u00b4 dialab has always tried to dis-\npense with local/global distinctions. But attacking the\nmicro/macro divide in theory, we were constantly\ntrapped in using the same concepts that we tried to\nrefuse (the very name `actor-network' is a perfect exam-\nple of such paradox). Talking of `quali-quantitative\nmethods', `navigating through situation and aggrega-\ntion' and `overcoming the micro/macro divide', we\ncannot avoid giving the wrong impression that the\nadventure is located between and not beyond these trad-\nitional oppositions. Much clearer than any theoretical\nargument, the research practices embedded in our tools\nand methods demonstrate what a continuous sociology\ncan deliver (tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr).\nTo understand the advantages of a continuous\nresearch, consider a playful diagram designed by Andy\nGreenwald (grantland.com/features/the-hbo-recycling-\nprogram) to highlight how the HBO television network\n`recycle' the same performers in different series (see\nFigure 3(a)). Besides showing that most performers are\nconnected to several lines (hence the `recycling'), the dia-\ngram does not convey much. In particular, it is difficult\nobserve which performers co-appear in the same series\nand which series share the same performers. This infor-\nmation is hidden by the separation between performers\nand series. Since the performers are aligned on the left\nof the diagram (the micro) and the series are aligned on\nthe right (the macro), all other groupings disappear. It is\nenough, however, to remove this separation \u00ad and let\nperformers and series position themselves on the same\nplan \u00ad to highlight other fractures and other groupings\n(notably the `gangster' cluster at the bottom of the net-\nwork) (see Figure 3(b)).\nAt the me\n\u00b4 dialab, we encountered the same experi-\nence in a more academic case (Venturini et al., 2016).\nUsing a network visualization (see Figure 4(b)),\nwe tried to overcome the separation between the indi-\nviduals and the institutions of the French dominant\nclass, which a famous table by Luc Boltanski (1973)\nseparated in rows and columns (see Figure 4(a)).\nRepresenting individuals and institutions on the same\nplan we could highlight not only how many connec-\ntions had each entity (as in the table), but also how\nfar in the social space did such connections extended.\nBesides hiding other (often more relevant) fractures,\nthe micro/macro distinction has another disadvantage:\nit conceals the work invested to build individual inter-\nactions and collective aggregates, conceiving the former\ngiven and the latter as `emerging'. Introduced in biol-\nogy, the notion of `emergence' has been developed to\nexpress the idea that complex systems (e.g., living\norganisms) have properties (e.g., the fact of being\nalive) that are impossible to anticipate from their com-\nponents. An emergent phenomenon is `unlike its com-\nponents insofar as these are incommensurable, and it\ncannot be reduced to their sum or their difference'\nin the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2012).\nTransported in the social sciences, the notion of emer-\ngence risks however to naturalize (and de-politicize) col-\nlective systems. If institutions and norms are emergent,\nthen none can be held responsible for them. They derive\nfrom the interactions among a multitude of actors, but\nnot correspond to the intentions of any of them. The\nmetaphor recurrently employed is that of ants' colonies.\nLike ants reacting to the pheromones that they encounter,\nbut incapable to appreciate the larger architecture of their\nnests (Garnier et al., 2007), social actors would create\nglobal structures by reacting to their local environment.\nVenturini et al. 7\nRemarkably, this `emergent' approach characterized\nthe first applications of digital computation to social sci-\nences \u00ad particularly through agent-based models (see\nCastellano et al., 2009, and the special issues of PNAS,\nAttributing global structures to mysterious emergent\ndynamics (that, by definition, cannot be studied) made\nsense when the opposition between qualitative and quan-\ntitativemethodsofferedlittleinformationonanythingelse\nthan situated interactions and aggregated trends. Yet, as\ndigital traceability allows investigating collective actions\nat a plurality of levels, the opposition between `micromo-\ntives and macrobehaviors' (Schelling, 1978) lose much of\nits interest. Even worse, such binary approach has become\na tangible obstacle to understanding some of the collective\ncrises faced by our societies (Venturini et al., 2015b).\nAt the me\n\u00b4 dialab, we stumbled on such an obstacle\nwhile mapping the debate on climate change in\nthe EMAPS project (Venturini et al., 2014b, http://\nclimaps.eu). Such debate is blocked (among many other\nreasons) because of the tendency to present\npersonalchoicesorworldwideagreementsastheonlypos-\nsible dimensions to tackle the climate crisis (Aykut and\nDahan, 2015, callthis the `reality schisms' of international\nclimate regime). While both these levels are clearly\nimportant, they are by no means the only ones.\nCountless other collective actions are possible and neces-\nsary at other scales, including industrial policies, con-\nsumptions trends, ecological resiliencies, local\ncommunities, etc. While all these scales have been studied\nby social scientists, the discontinuity of our methods and\ntheories have made it difficult to observe the `scale-break-\ning' relations that connects, for example, the international\nfunding decisions to the adaptation projects carried out in\nspecific districts of Bangladesh (http://climaps.eu#!/nar-\nrative/climate-adaptation-in-bangladesh); or the discus-\nsions about natural and social resilience to the climate\ninvestments in different regions of Germany (http://cli-\nmaps.eu#!/narrative/who-deserves-to-be-funded).\nInviting us to navigate through different scales of\nactions, digital methods have profound political impli-\ncations. Alongside the transformation of digital inscrip-\ntions, another (more important) operation is taking\nplace: the crafting of alternative narratives about\nsocial life. By dissolving the binary distinction between\nqualitative and quantitative methods, situation and\naggregation, digital research makes space to a new set\nof collective stories. Such stories involve a multitude of\nactors other than individuals and structures \u00ad associ-\nations, communities, clusters, networks, interest\ngroups, concerned publics and a variety of other char-\nacters. Though these characters have long been known\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3. The network of HBO casting spatialized by (a) separating or (b) merging performers and series.\n8 Big Data & Society\nby social sciences, the `flatting' effect produced by the\ncontinuity of digital methods suddenly bring them\ntogether and force them to share the same stage.\nWelcoming these actors and their interference is\nboth crucial and crucially difficult. As we tried to\nconvey in this article, there is nothing automatic\nabout digital methods. The variety of digital traces\ncomes with the responsibility to chose among different\nsources. Say we want to work on climate adaptation\n(as we did in EMAPS), where should we start from?\nfrom the report of the OECD Official Aid Report; from\nthe UNDP database of adaptation projects; or from\ntweets about global warming? And once the sources\nchosen, we still have to decide how we will transform\ntheir inscriptions; how we will analyse the resulting\ndata; and which forms of navigation we will encourage\nwith our interfaces. While we know that each of these\ndecisions will have a substantial influence on our\nresearch outcomes, we often lack the knowledge neces-\nsary to make them. Our methodological focus makes us\nexperts on digital techniques, not on the issues we study\nthrough them. And this is where the dialogue with a\nvariety of social actors becomes crucial. Provided that\nwe find ways to organize the various (and sometime\nconflicting) contributions coming from, e.g., a spokes-\nperson of the French Finance ministry, a development\nspecialist working on an adaptation project in Tuvalu,\nor Bangladeshi negotiator at the UNFCCC.\nOrganizing the heterogeneity of these contributions\nand redistributing research decisions demand once more\nto renew our scientific practices. Different research for-\nmats have been experimented at the me\n\u00b4 dialab, like work-\nshops, data sprints (Munk et al., 2016; Venturini et al.,\n2016a), simulations and exhibitions. These different\ntypes of events are meant to engage different types of\npublics: workshops, for example, address fellow\nresearchers; data sprints address experts; simulations\naddress students; exhibitions address the general public.\nYet, all these formats represent `extreme' versions of the\nway in which we do research on a daily basis: we work\ncollaboratively on data, we imagine uses and users for our\ndatascape and we show our tools to actors, experts and\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 4. Luc Boltanski original table of the French dominant class and its redesign as a network.\nVenturini et al. 9\ncommunities. Crafting these interactions has become an\nintegral part of our approach to digital methods, a way of\ndoing research in which face to face interactions ended up\nbeing every bit as important as digital computation.\nThe journey of the me\n\u00b4 dialab is not finished and other\nunexpected encounters await in the future of social sci-\nences. It is not too early, however, from taking stock of\nwhat we have learned. By our trials and by our errors, we\nexperienced how different is the practice digital research\nfrom the dream of Big Data. The digital is not a land of\nabundance. It is not a place where information pour in\nfreely or easily; not a place where computational tricks,\npowerful as they may be, can replace the hard work\nnecessary to mine, nurture and refine inscriptions.\nDigital methods do not spare us from walking the\nwalk, but they give us the chance to experiment new\npathways. The diversity of digital traces and techniques\nchallenges disciplinary orthodoxies. It compels us to\nconsider new ways of collecting and redistributing infor-\nmation; it pushes us out of our comfort zone; forces us to\nally with developers, designers and with a multiplicity of\nsocial actors. None of this is easy, to be sure, and nothing\nassures that the promise of digital methods will be kept.\nPursuing a more continuous sociology is not the same\nthing as achieving the continuity of the social. Our jour-\nney is far from reaching its harbor, but `the sails are set,\nthe wind is east, the moorings fret'.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research,\nauthorship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAmerican Journal of Sociology (2005) Special Issue on Agent-\nAykut SC and Dahan A (2015) Gouverner Le Climat?
