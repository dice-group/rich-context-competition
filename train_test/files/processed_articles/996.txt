About\none fourth (23%) frequently drank in this manner (3 or more times in the past 2\nweeks), up from 20% in 1993. Similarly, the national Monitoring the Future study\n1999 consumed 5 or more drinks on a single occasion at least once in the previous\n2 weeks, a greater proportion than found among same-age noncollege peers (35%)\nand high school seniors (31%).\nIn 1998 the National Advisory Council of the National Institute on Alcohol\nAbuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), one of the Institutes of the National Institutes\nof Health, created a task force to review the research on college drinking to advise\nadministrators and the NIAAA on implementing and evaluating college programs\nandfutureresearchdirections.Thisstudyresultedina2002report:A Call to Action:\nChanging the Culture of Drinking on U.S. College Campuses (57). Background\npapers appeared in \"College Drinking, What Is It and What to Do About It? A\nReview of the State of the Science\" in the Journal of Studies for Alcohol (23).\nalcohol-related injuries including motor vehicle crashes. Further, of the 8 million\ncollege students in the United States more than 2 million drove under the influence\nof alcohol and over 3 million rode with a drinking driver. More than 500,000 full-\ntime 4-year-college students were unintentionally injured under the influence of\nexperienced a date rape caused by another student who had been drinking.\nThe purpose of this review is to assess whether the magnitude of alcohol-related\nmorbidity and mortality among U.S. college students ages 18\u00ad24 changed from\nthe 2002 NIAAA report and the recent National Academy of Science Report to\nCongress Preventing Under Age Drinking: A Collective Responsibility, to reduce\ncollege drinking problems (52).\nThis review compares the number of alcohol-related traffic and other unintentional\nare full- or part-time college students attending either 2- or 4-year colleges. In-\nformation was integrated from multiple data sets because the U.S. Department of\nTransportation Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS): NHTSA (56) does\nnot routinely record whether persons who die in motor vehicle crashes are college\nstudents. In addition, people who die from other types of unintentional injuries\nare not systematically tested for blood alcohol concentrations (BACs). The data\nsources consulted are described below.\nFirst, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) annually records\nthe numbers and ages of unintentional injury deaths (5), but they do not record\nwhether these deaths are alcohol related. Second, a recent meta-analysis of 331\ntional nontraffic fatalities were tested for BACs. Of those tested, 38% had positive\nBACs, and 31% had BACs of 0.10% or higher, exceeding legal limits for intox-\nication nationwide (65). This analysis provides the best available estimates for\nalcohol involvement in injury deaths (other than motor vehicle crash deaths), but it\ndoes not provide information on annual changes in the proportions of those deaths\nthat are alcohol related.\nThird, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) FARS\nrecords all motor vehicle crash deaths in the United States (55, 56) and the pro-\nportion that are alcohol related, defined as involving a driver or pedestrian with\na positive BAC. The ages of decedents are recorded, as are their blood alcohol\nconcentrations. Because BACs are not drawn on all motor vehicle crash deaths,\nan imputational formula projects the likelihood of alcohol involvement in those\ncrashes for which test results are not available.\nFourth, the Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics\n(53) reports the number of undergraduate college students in the United States. In\n(33%) were enrolled as full- or part-time students in either 2- or 4-year colleges:\ncolleges. Of students enrolled in 4-year colleges, 74% were ages 18\u00ad24, as were\n18\u00ad24-year-olds regardless of whether they were college students (66, 67). In both\nsurveys, college students were more likely than same-age noncollege respondents\nto report drinking five or more drinks on at least one occasion in the past month and\ndriving under the influence in the past year. On the basis of those survey results, we\nprojected that the proportions of traffic and other unintentional injury decedents\ntesting positive for alcohol would be as high among college 18\u00ad24-year-olds as\nnoncollege-year-olds same-age persons. Because college students comprised 33%\ntraffic and other unintentional injury deaths experienced by the 18\u00ad24-year-old\nU.S. population.\nCalculation of other Alcohol-Related Risks\ntheir experiences with alcohol in the previous year. Using their responses and data\non the numbers of college students in the United States during those years, we\nestimated the annual numbers of college students ages 18\u00ad24 who drive under\nthe influence of alcohol, were injured because of drinking, and experienced other\nalcohol-related problems.\nThe National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) (67) is the primary\nsource of statistical information on illegal drug use in the United States. Sponsored\nby the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\n(66), computer-assisted interviews are conducted with a representative sample of\nthe United States: residents of households and noninstitutional group quarters (e.g.,\nshelters, rooming houses, dormitories) and civilians living on military bases.\nsample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Youth and young\nadults were oversampled so that each state's sample was approximately equally\npersons were interviewed within screened addresses. Weighted response rates for\nhouseholds screened and interviewed were 89.6% and 68.6%, respectively. The\nstudents.\nted response rates for households screened and persons interviewed were 91% and\nwere enrolled in college.\nRespondents were asked how often they drank 5 or more alcoholic drinks on any\none occasion in the past 30 days. They were also asked, reflecting on the previous\n12 months, Has your use of alcohol caused you to have any health problems?, Have\nyou driven a vehicle under the influence of alcohol only?, and Have you received\ntreatment or counseling for your use of alcohol?\nThe Harvard School of Public Health CAS began in 1993 (77) with a sample\nof 140 colleges selected from a list of all accredited 4-year colleges provided by\nthe American Council on Education, using probability sampling proportionate to\nthe size of undergraduate enrollment at each institution. At each college, a random\nsample of 225 undergraduates was drawn from the total enrollment of full-time\na random sample of students and their mailing addresses resulted in the attrition\nfrom 40 states, were surveyed; nearly half of these students lived in dormitories,\ncollege housing, fraternities, or sororities (response rate 60%) (79).\nsurvey from each of 119 colleges and universities that had been part of the 1999\nsample, response rate 52% (80). Respondents were asked their frequency and usual\nquantity of drinking, whether during the current school year they experienced\na variety of health and social problems because of their drinking, and whether\nthe drinking of other college students posed any of a series of social and health\nproblems for them.\nStatistical Analyses of Surveys\nFor both surveys we present weighted results that consider their respective designs\nand nonresponse. All statistical estimates of percentages for the survey data were\nconducted using the SUDAAN statistical package to account for each survey's\ndesign (63). The SUDAAN package accounts for sampling weights in calculating\nboth estimates and standard errors, using first-order Taylor series approximations\nto provide standard errors that approximately account for sampling design.\nUsing the information above, we identified the percentage of 2- and 4-year\ncollege students ages 18\u00ad24 who responded affirmatively to the survey ques-\ntions regarding alcohol problems and then calculated 95% confidence intervals\nfor those responses. To estimate the numbers of 18\u00ad24-year-old college stu-\ndents who experienced those problems, we then multiplied those percentages\nand confidence intervals by the appropriate population count from the Depart-\nment of Education of students 18\u00ad24 years enrolled in 2- and 4-year colleges in\nthe United States. Data from the Department of Education are considered to be\ntrue population totals; therefore, our confidence intervals reflect only the sam-\npling variability in the percentage estimates. We also made projections from the\nCAS responses to the full-time 4-year college population using the same analytic\nstrategy.\nPercentages of responses with 95% confidence intervals were calculated from\nsurvey data accounting for the sampling design. Changes in numbers of events\nand rates of events per 100,000 population were described through relative risks,\nand 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Poisson model. These\npercentages and confidence intervals are available on request.\nRESULTS\nMotor Vehicle Crash Deaths\nthe survey, a significantly greater percentage of 18\u00ad24-year-old college students\ncomparedwithsame-agenoncollegerespondentsdrank5ormoredrinksonasingle\nin 2002) and drove under the influence of alcohol in the previous year (26.5%\ngroups of 18\u00ad24-year-olds who drank 5 or more drinks in the past 30 days did\nnot significantly increase from 1999 to 2002. However, the percentage of college\nstudents who drove under the influence in the past year increased significantly\ntraffic deaths were alcohol related. On the basis of a deliberately conservative\nexperienced alcohol-related fatalities at the same rate as the entire 18\u00ad24-year-old\npopulation, 1248 (33%) of the alcohol-related traffic deaths in that age group would\nhave been college students.

Assuming that college students (32%\nalcohol-related traffic deaths in that age group would have been college students\n(Table 1).\nalcohol-related traffic deaths increased 11%. Thus the increase in alcohol-related\ntraffic deaths per 18\u00ad24-year-old population was 4%. The U.S. college popula-\ntion ages 18\u00ad24 increased 3%, but the number of alcohol-related traffic deaths\namong 18\u00ad24-year-old students increased 8%. The 5% increase in the rate of\nUnintentional Nontraffic Deaths\nIn the NHSDA survey, 18\u00ad24-year-olds in college and not in college were equally\nas reported in national analyses of coroner studies (64), then 991 persons ages\nunintentional injuries.\n1.27).

The increase in the proportion who reported a health problem related\nto alcohol, from 1.9% to 2.1%, was also not significant. However, the proportion\nof college students ages 18\u00ad24 who in the past year reported driving under the\n(95% CI 1.13, 1.25); the proportion of students who were arrested for an alcohol-\nrelated offense or who were receiving treatment for an alcohol or drug problem\nstudents who drove under the influence of alcohol in the previous year increased\npopulation.\nOther Alcohol-Related Health Problems\nproportion of students who in the CAS reported being hurt or injured or having\nnumber of students with these experiences increased at rates similar to the pro-\ndrinking and 474,000 (8%) had unprotected sexual intercourse as a result of their\ndrinking. Although in 2001 slightly smaller proportions reported being assaulted\nrape victims.\nyear-olds rose at a rate that significantly exceeded that age group's proportional\nold group, among college students alcohol-related unintentional injury deaths per\npopulation rose 6%, an increase that approached statistical significance. In 2001,\nwere assaulted by another drinking college student.\nAlthoughthenumbersaredisturbinglyhigh,webelieveourestimatesofalcohol-\nrelated college deaths are conservative. First, we focused only on unintentional\ninjury deaths, not homicides and suicides, many of which are also alcohol related.\nSecond, the proportion of 18\u00ad24-year-olds who engage in heavy episodic drinking\nand driving under the influence of alcohol is higher among persons that age who\nare enrolled in college. Consequently, our projection that college and noncollege\n18\u00ad24-year-olds experience traffic alcohol-related injury deaths at the same rate\nper population in each group was intentionally conservative.\nThird, the meta-analysis of coroner studies (65) did not provide age-specific\nestimates of alcohol involvement in nontraffic unintentional injury deaths. We\nestimated the proportion of nontraffic unintentional injury deaths was the same\namong 18\u00ad24-year-old college students as among adults all ages, even though\npersons 18\u00ad24 are known to drink more than other adults. A higher proportion\nof traffic fatalities are alcohol related in the 18\u00ad24-year-old population (51%)\nthan among all age groups (38%). It is therefore possible, if not likely, that our\nestimates of the number of unintentional alcohol-related nontraffic injury deaths\namong 18\u00ad24-year-olds are also conservative.\nFourth, if respondents underreport illegal behaviors like driving under the in-\nfluence of alcohol, our estimate of the numbers of students who engage in those\nbehaviors may be low.\nFifth, response rates for the NHSDA and CAS were low. Thus, students may\nunder- or overrepresent problems associated with alcohol. In 1999 a short form\nof the CAS was sent to nonresponding students, and there was no significant\ndifference in rates of previous year alcohol use for those answering the short survey\ncompared with the full questionnaire. Of note, the estimates of heavy episodic\ndrinking reported by college students in the NHSDA and the CAS are very similar\nto those obtained by other major national surveys that include college students\ne.g., the Monitoring the Future Survey (36, 37).\n74% of 4-year college students and 60% of students at 2- or 4-year colleges were\nwere in that age group. We have calculated the overall numbers of college students\nall ages who drink heavily and experience alcohol-related health problems. These\nnumbers are larger than those reported here and are available on request.\nIMPLICATIONS\nThe magnitude of problems posed by excessive drinking among college students\nshould stimulate both improved measurement of these problems and efforts to\nreduce them. We believe every unnatural death in the United States should be\ntested for alcohol. The average cost of such testing would be approximately $50 per\ndeceased person or an annual cost of $1.1 million if all injury deaths of those under\nlegal intervention and suicide deaths of all ages recorded in 2001. In comparison,\nthe National Academy of Sciences (52) reports $71.1 million are spent annually\nto reduce underage drinking. Even though this review used cautious assumption to\nestimate the numbers of alcohol-related deaths among college students and other\n18\u00ad24-year-olds, direct systematic alcohol test results would be preferable. Also,\nmortality data sets (e.g., the Department of Transportation's FARS and CDC's Vital\nStatistics Mortality File) should include occupation and student status categories\nso that the absolute number of annual college student deaths can be tabulated.\nProgress has been made over the past two decades to reduce alcohol-related\ncrash deaths. This process has occurred in part because a sufficiently high and\nconsistent level of fatally injured drivers in crashes are tested for alcohol that sta-\ntistical models based on crash factors, vehicle factors, and person factors have\nbeen developed and used to estimate the annual numbers of alcohol-involved fatal\ncrashes in all states (40). The data on the numbers of alcohol-related fatal crashes\nannually in each state has proven invaluable to researchers seeking to study the ef-\nfects of state-level legislative interventions to reduce alcohol-related traffic deaths.\nUnfortunately, without comprehensive testing for alcohol and determination of\ncollege student status of all persons who die from unnatural deaths, we lack the\nmost dependable yardstick by which to measure the magnitude of alcohol-related\ninjury death among college students, and whether this figure is changing over time.\nThe increase in the past 3 years in alcohol-related traffic and other unintentional\ninjurydeathsamong18\u00ad24-year-oldsbothincollegeandnotincollegeunderscores\nthe need for colleges and their surrounding communities to expand and strengthen\ninterventions demonstrated to reduce excessive drinking among college students\nand their same-age noncollege counterparts.\nOf note, heavy-drinking college students not only place their own health at risk,\nbut also they jeopardize the well-being of others. As many as 46% of the 4553\npersons other than the drinking driver, and the total deceased has increased 33%\nvictim of a date rape or assault perpetrated by a drinking college student. Colleges\nand surrounding communities have an obligation to protect people from potential\nharm contributed by excess college drinking.\nThe recent report on college drinking (57) and its background reports (23) and\nthe National Academy of Sciences Report on Underage Drinking (52) identified\nnumerous individually oriented counseling approaches, environmental interven-\ntions, and comprehensive community interventions that can reduce drinking and\nrelated problems among college students and the college age population. These\ndocuments summarize scientifically valid approaches for effective prevention, and\nsome believe they establish a new legal standard by which the adequacy of any\ncollege or university's efforts can be judged (44). See Table 2.\nIndividually Oriented Interventions\nLarimer & Cronce (43) reviewed individually oriented strategies to reduce prob-\nincluded in this review if they had a control or comparison group and had at least\none change in drinking or alcohol consequences outcome. A total of 34 separate\nstudies were identified. The reviewers found little evidence for the effectiveness\nof information-based and values-clarification programs. Several skills-based inter-\nventions (13, 50, 60) resulted in decreases in alcohol consumption, including self-\nmonitoring/self-assessment (21, 48) as well as expectancy-challenge procedures\n(14) involving alcohol/placebo administration. Brief motivational interventions\nhad demonstrated effectiveness in a variety of contexts including selected high-risk\nfreshmen, high school classrooms, fraternity organizations, outpatient counseling\ncenters, and emergency rooms. Mailed graphic feedback alone in three studies (1,\n75, 76) resulted in reductions in alcohol consumption equivalent or superior to\nskills-based interventions with combined feedback.\nEnvironmental Interventions: Legal Drinking Age of 21\nThe most powerful environmental intervention to reduce drinking among college\nlegal drinking age of 21, the U.S. Congress passed legislation that would withhold\nhighway construction funds from states that did not make it illegal to sell alcohol\nto people younger than 21. By 1988, all states adopted this law. A review of\nmore than 49 studies of legal drinking age changes revealed that in the 1970s and\n1980s, when many states lowered the drinking age, alcohol-related traffic crashes\nincreased 10%. In contrast, when states increased the legal drinking age to 21,\nalcohol-related crashes among people younger than 21 decreased an average of\n16% (64). Wagenaar & Toomey (74) reviewed more than 48 studies of the effects of\ndrinking age changes on drinking and 57 studies on traffic crashes. They concluded\nthat increases in the age of legal alcohol purchase and consumption have been the\nmost successful intervention to date in reducing drinking- and alcohol-related\ncrashes among persons under 21. One national study of laws raising the drinking\nage to 21 indicated that persons who grew up in states with a drinking age of 21\nrelative to those with lower legal drinking ages drank less not only when they were\nZero tolerance laws, which make it illegal in every state for persons under 21\nto drive after any drinking, have also contributed to declines in alcohol-related\ntraffic deaths among people younger than 21. A comparison of the first 8 states\nto adopt zero tolerance laws with nearby states without such laws revealed a 21%\ngreater decline in zero tolerance law states in the proportion of fatal crashes among\ndrivers younger than 21 that were of the type most likely to involve alcohol (i.e.,\nsingle-vehicle fatal crashes at night) (28). Wagenaar et al. (73) found that in the\nfirst 30 states to adopt zero tolerance laws, relative to the rest of the nation, there\nwas a 19% decline in the proportion of people younger than 21 who drove after\nany drinking and a 23% decline in the proportion who drove after 5 or more drinks.\nUnfortunately, despite their demonstrated benefits, legal drinking age and zero\ntolerance laws generally have not been vigorously enforced (38). Young drivers\nare substantially underrepresented in the driving while intoxicated (DWI) arrest\npopulation relative to their contributions to the alcohol crash problem (59, 70).\nYounger drivers may be more likely to drink at locations where DWI enforcement\nresources are less likely to be deployed. Young drivers with high BACs also are\nmore likely to be missed by police at sobriety checkpoints (82).\nStepped-up enforcement of alcohol purchase laws aimed at sellers and buyers\ncan be effective (59, 69, 72) if resources are made available for this purpose.\nEnforcement of zero tolerance laws is hindered in some states because their implied\nconsent laws require either an arrest for DWI or probable cause for a DWI arrest\nbefore the evidentiary test can be done to prove a zero tolerance violation (19).\nThus in practice zero tolerance laws often are not enforced independently of DWI.\nIn states such as New Mexico, where this situation exists, most teenagers are\nunaware that there is a zero tolerance law (20).\nPrice of Alcohol\nThe National Academy of Sciences (52) reviewed the literature on price of alcohol\nand alcohol-related problems and recommended that Congress and state legislators\nraise excise taxes to reduce underage alcohol consumption and to raise additional\nrevenues to reduce underage drinking problems.\nWith rare exceptions (8, 15) research since the early 1980s generally has con-\ncluded that increases in the price of alcohol beverages lead to reductions in drinking\nand heavy drinking, as well as reductions in the adverse consequences of alcohol\nuse and abuse (6). Higher alcohol prices have also been found to reduce alcohol-\nrelated problems such as motor vehicle fatalities (16, 39, 62), robberies, rapes,\nliver cirrhosis deaths (11, 12, 61), sexually transmitted diseases (9), and child\nabuse (46, 47). Among moderate drinkers, investigators have estimated that a 1%\nprice increase results in a 1.19% decrease in consumption (45). Younger, heavier\ndrinkers tend to be more affected by price than older, heavier drinkers (7, 22, 39,\n68), perhaps because younger drinkers have less discretionary income. Laixuthai\n& Chaloupka (42), Grossman et al. (25), and Coate & Grossman (10) all found in-\ncreasing the price of alcohol reduces the percent of youths who drink infrequently\nand produces even greater percentage declines in youths who drink frequently.\nResearch taking into account the addictive nature of alcohol shows that the\nlong-term price elasticity is well above short-term elasticity (24). Kenkel (39)\nreported a 10% increase in the price of alcohol would reduce DWI 7% among men\nand 8% among women, and among persons under 21 this action would produce a\n13% decrease among men and a 21% decrease among women.\nIf, as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences Report (52), revenues\ngenerated by alcohol tax increases to raise beverage prices are in turn earmarked\nfor programs and enforcement of policies known to reduce underage drinking,\nreductions in underage drinking problems could exceed deductions associated\nwith alcohol price increases alone.\nOther Environmental Interventions\nAlcohol outlet density has been associated with alcohol-related problems (26) and\nreducing outlet density may in turn reduce drinking-related problems. Wechsler\net al. (81) found that students who attend colleges in states that have more re-\nstrictions on underage drinking, high volume consumption, and sales of alcohol\nbeverages and which devote more resources to enforce drunk-driving laws, report\nless drinking and driving. Laws in these states included prohibitions against us-\ning a false identification, restrictions on attempting to buy or consume for those\nunder the legal drinking age, enforcement of a clerk age minimum, and mainte-\nnance of minimum mandatory postings of warning signs in retailers to potential\nunderage buyers. Laws pertaining to volume alcohol sales were keg registration, a\nstatewide 0.08 g/dl per se BAC law, and restrictions on happy hours, open alcohol\ncontainers, beer sold in a pitcher, and billboards and advertising. The availability\nof large volumes of alcohol (24- and 30-can cases of beer, kegs, party balls), low\nsaleprices,andfrequentpromotionsandadvertisementsatbothon-andoff-premise\nestablishments were also associated with higher binge drinking rates on the college\nShults (64) also reviewed 19 studies of states lowering legal blood alcohol\nlimits for persons above 21 to 0.08% and reported that this law cut alcohol-related\nfatalities on average by 7% and concluded that there is strong evidence in favor of\nsuch a change.\nComprehensive Community Interventions\nSeveral carefully conducted community-based initiatives have had particular suc-\ncess in reducing drinking- and/or alcohol-related problems among young people\n(32). These programs typically coordinate efforts of city officials from multiple\ndepartments of city government, school, health, police, alcohol beverage con-\ntrol, etc.; concerned private citizens and their organizations; students; parents; and\nmerchants who sell alcohol. Often multiple intervention strategies are incorpo-\nrated into the programs, including school-based programs involving students, peer\nleaders, and parents; media advocacy; community organizing and mobilization;\nenvironmental policy change to reduce alcohol availability to youth; and height-\nened enforcement of laws regulating sales and distribution of alcohol and laws to\nreduce alcohol-related traffic injuries and deaths.\nThree comprehensive community programs in particular have shown reduction\nin alcohol problems among college-age youth: the Communities Mobilizing for\nChange Program (71, 72), the Community Trials Program (35), and the Saving\non underage alcohol purchase attempt surveys with feedback to alcohol sales\nmerchants and the community about the proportion of attempts that resulted in\nsales and penalties for continued violations. Two programs (34, 35) focused on\npublicized police enforcement of drinking driver laws and alcohol service laws, and\none (34) targeted risky motorist behaviors--such as speeding, running red lights,\nfailing to wear safety belts, and yielding to pedestrians in crosswalks--engaged\nin disproportionally by drinking drivers.\nRelative to the comparison communities, the Communities Mobilizing for\nChange communities achieved a 17% increase in outlets checking the age identi-\nfication of youthful-appearing alcohol purchasers, a 24% decline in sales by bars\nand restaurants to potential underage purchasers, a 25% decrease in the proportion\nof 18\u00ad20-year-olds seeking to buy alcohol, a 17% decline in the proportion of older\nteens who provided alcohol to younger teens, and a 7% decrease in the percentage\nof respondents younger than 21 who drank in the previous 30 days (71). Further,\ndrinking and driving arrests declined significantly among 18\u00ad20-year-olds, and\ndisorderly conduct violators declined among 15\u00ad17-year-olds (72).\nIn the Community Trials Program, single-vehicle crashes at night, a measure\nof alcohol-related crashes, declined 11% more in program than in comparison\ncommunities. Alcohol-related trauma visits to emergency departments declined\nIn the Saving Lives Program (34) the proportion of drivers younger than 20\nwho reported in telephone surveys driving after drinking declined from 19% to\n9% over the course of the program. The proportion of vehicles observed speeding\nthrough use of radar was cut in half, and there was a 7% increase in safety belt use.\nMinimal change in these outcomes occurred in comparison areas. Fatal crashes\nyears, a 25% greater reduction than in the rest of Massachusetts. Fatal crashes\ninvolving alcohol declined 42%, and the number of fatally injured drivers with\npositive BACs declined 47%, relative to the rest of Massachusetts. Visible injuries\nper 100 crashes declined 5% more in Saving Lives cities than in the rest of the state\nduring the program period. The fatal crash declines were greater in all six program\ncities relative to comparison areas, particularly among drivers ages 15\u00ad25.\nWeitzman et al. (83) recently evaluated the impact of college/community part-\nnerships implementing environmentally based interventions to reduce drinking\nand related problems specifically among college students. Interventions included\nin the A Matter of Degree (AMOD) program included keg registration, mandatory\nresponsible beverage service, increased enforcement of community police collab-\noration or wild party enforcement, substance-free residence halls, and a variety of\nalcohol bars advertising environment with change. Of the ten AMOD programs,\nthe five that most vigorously implemented these interventions achieved significant\nreductions in binge and frequent binge drinking, frequent intoxication, driving\nafter drinking, alcohol-related injury, and a variety of other alcohol-related prob-\nlems. Relative to control colleges, significant reductions were observed also in the\nproportion of students who reported being assaulted by another drinking college\nstudent.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBinge drinking and particularly DWI among college students and others in the 18\u00ad\n24 age group has increased since 1998, and alcohol-related deaths have increased\nsignificantly more than the population totals for that age. Colleges and the commu-\nnities in which they are located have an obligation to control the harms to others\nposed by college-age drinkers, regardless of whether these drinkers are college\nstudents. Although a high percentage of 18\u00ad24-year-old college students drink\nheavily and engage in behaviors, such as driving a motor vehicle after drinking,\nthat pose risk to themselves and others, there are so many more 18\u00ad24-year-olds\nnot in college that this population actually accounts for more heavy drinkers, drink-\ning drivers, and alcohol-related deaths. In 2001, while 3.8 million college students\nages 18\u00ad24 engaged in heavy (5+ drinks) drinking episodes, so too did 7.6 million\n18\u00ad24-year-olds who were not in college. While 2.8 million college students this\nage drove under the influence of alcohol, so too did 4.5 million persons that age\ndents died in alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes, among all 18\u00ad24-year-olds,\nages 18\u00ad24 died from other unintentional alcohol-related injuries, among all 18\u00ad\n24-year-olds, 1151 individuals died from alcohol-related nontraffic unintentional\nMoreover, while young adults ages 18\u00ad24 have the highest rates of binge drink-\ning (5+ drinks at a time) than do other adults, persons over age 26 account for two\nthirds of all binge drinking episodes (51). Also, while the highest rates of alcohol-\nrelated traffic deaths are among 18\u00ad24-year-olds, they accounted for only 24%\nof alcohol-related traffic deaths and 9% of all other alcohol-related unintentional\ndeaths in 2001; this fact suggests that efforts are needed to reduce alcohol-related\ntraffic and unintentional injury deaths among persons of all ages, including college\nstudents.\nFurther, new research indicates that persons who drink to excess even before\nthey enter college are more likely to experience alcohol-related problems both\nin high school and in college (33). According to the CDC National Youth Risk\nBehavior Survey, in 2001 47% of high school students (over 7 million) drank\nalcohol in the previous 30 days and 34% (over 5 million) drank at least 5 drinks\nwithin a 2-hour period at least once in the previous 30 days. Thirteen percent\nor 1.9 million individuals drove after drinking in the previous 30 days, and 31%\n(4.6 million) rode with a drinking driver (27). Further, the average age of starting\nto drink is declining (66). In 2001, 29% of high school students reported that they\nstudents 19 and older revealed that the younger college students were when they\nfirst drank to intoxication (got drunk), the more likely they were to experience\nalcohol dependence in college, to engage in frequent heavy episodic drinking, to\ndrive after drinking and heavy (5+ drinks) drinking, to ride with drunk drivers, to be\ninjured under the influence of alcohol (31), and to have unplanned and unprotected\nsex after drinking (29). Community alcohol policy enforcement targeting high\nschool students may have carryover effects in college years.\nBecause increased efforts to enforce underage drinking laws at the community\nlevel have reduced underage drinking, alcohol-related assault, emergency depart-\nment visits, and alcohol-related fatal crashes involving people of college age (34,\n35, 71, 72), it is important that colleges and their surrounding communities col-\nlaborate in these efforts. These efforts can include individually oriented screen-\ning and counseling strategies of proven efficiency among college and adolescent\npopulations as well as environmental interventions such as alcohol tax increases,\nheightened education, and enforcement of minimum legal drinking age and zero\ntolerance laws. College crackdowns on campus drinking absent community sup-\nport may drive problematic drinking off campus. Community crackdowns without\ncollege support may similarly drive drinking problems back onto campus. More-\nover, community efforts to reduce underage drinking are needed to prevent the\ndevelopment of unsafe underage drinking practices before they spill over into the\ncollege setting.\n"
