This study's focus on the retiree identity complements research on institutionalized retirement criteria. We test\nwhether tensions between individuals' own life circumstances and institutionalized retirement criteria manifest themselves in\nthe extent to which individuals assume a retiree identity and in the overlap between self-definitions and attainment of institu-\ntionalized retirement criteria.\nMethods. The analyses rely on logistic regressions and are based on data from the National Survey of Families and\nResults. Labor force participation serves as the main basis for the retiree identity, but other life experiences (work history,\ndisability, spouse's retirement, economic status, family history) also contribute to individuals' self-identification as retiree and\nthe \"fit\" between self-identification and attainment of institutionalized retirement criteria. Men's retirement identity seems more\nclosely tied to their attainment of institutionalized retirement criteria and a continuous and successful work career, whereas a\nvariety of life circumstances impinge on women's retiree definitions. Moderately disabled African Americans are more likely to\nself-identify as partly or fully retired.\nDiscussion. While employment constitutes the main reference for individuals' self-definition as retiree, other life circum-\nstances also have some influence. Full understanding of retirement transitions will require more attention to the meaning con-\ntext of retirement among divergent population groups.\nRETIREMENT has become an institutionalized and ac-\n. cepted life course transition in postindustrial societies\ntirement transition process, as well as its precursors, are guided\nby a set of expectations that specify the meaning of retirement,\nits timing, and, to some extent, appropriate role behaviors\n(Ekerdt, 1986). Though essentially derived from economic and\npolitical initiatives (employer pensions, Social Security), these\nexpectations also constitute a basis for individuals' identifica-\ntion with the retiree role. For example, anticipation of retire-\nment leads to psychological disengagement from the work role\n(Ekerdt & DeViney, 1993). However, some persons or groups\nmay not assume a retiree identity when they leave the labor\nforce or become beneficiaries.\nRetirement research has emphasized institutionalized, or ob-\njective, retirement criteria such as labor supply or pension re-\nceipt, but paid relatively little tribute to individuals' own defini-\ntions or their subjective retiree identity. For example,\ninvestigations documenting the complexity and dynamics of re-\ntirement transition processes typically center on such events as\npartial retirement (Burr, Massagli, Mutchler, & Pienta, 1996;\nand work after retirement (Hayward & Grady, 1990; Morrow-\nHowell & Leon, 1988) or after the receipt of pension benefits\n1996). Concerns about the definition of retirement (Palmore,\n1965) stimulated studies exploring the extent of overlap among\ndivergent retirement criteria (Ekerdt & DeViney, 1990; Parnes\ntigations tend to view disparity among retirement criteria more\nas a validity rather than as an identity issue. Others explored\nspecific subgroups of retirees who do not fit well into tradi-\ntional retirement categories; for instance, available nonworkers\n1993), or retired housewives (Adelmann, Antonucci, &\nsome initial evidence that individuals' retiree identity is not\nonly influenced by institutionalized criteria (labor force with-\ndrawal, pensions) but also reflects complex life course pro-\ncesses such as work, health, or family history (Belgrave, 1988,\nWhile it is certainly essential to explore the precedents and\nconsequences of labor force exit or benefit receipt, full under-\nstanding of retirement processes also requires examination of\npersons' identification with the retiree role. Whether and at what\ntime during the objectively and institutionally defined retirement\nprocess individuals assume the retiree identity may have impor-\ntant consequences for their behaviors, attitudes, and, ultimately,\ntheir well being. For example, studies show that early retirees\nare more prone to reenter the labor market (Hayward, Hardy, &\nLiu, 1994), that perceptions of untimely retirement hinder retire-\nment adjustment (Szinovacz, 1989), or that low identification\nwith one's work role can underminejob satisfaction and feelings\nof self-worth (Mutran, Reitzes, Bratton, & Fernandez, 1997).\nSimilar outcomes may characterize individuals who experience\ndissonance between their objective retirement status and their\nsubjective identification with the retiree role.\nAs retirement transitions become increasingly blurred\nQuadagno & Hardy, 1996), disparity between objective retire-\nment criteria and individuals' serf-definitions as retiree may be-\ncome more common. This could mean that larger population\ngroups will be less susceptible to program and policy incentives\ngeared toward retirees. For example, the \"retiree busy ethic\"\n(Ekerdt, 1986) secures a supply of volunteers and leisure con-\nsumers, but such activities may not appeal to individuals who\nreject the retiree role. It could also imply that more retirees will\npursue activities (e.g., reentry into the labor market) that are in-\nconsistent with societal expectations and policies. Indeed,\nblurred retirement transitions could be viewed as manifesta-\ntions of clashes between institutional expectations and personal\npursuits. Thus, a focus on retirement identity and its sources\ncan contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the reasons\nfor such blurred boundaries.\nDistinction between retirement as defined by institutional-\nized criteria (e.g., labor force withdrawal) and the retiree iden-\ntity draws further attention to tensions between institutionalized\nprograms or policies and subgroup experiences (Kohli, 1986).\nSuch tensions are evident from research demonstrating that dis-\nparity between institutionalized and subjective retirement defi-\nnitions prevails among selected societal groups, such as women\nexample, rejection of the retiree identity among older African\nAmericans who have exited the labor force can be traced to the\nconsequences of racial discrimination, both in the labor market\nand in the health care system (Gibson, 1991; Hayward,\nFriedman, & Chen, 1996), and ambiguities in women's retire-\nment definitions reflect conflicts between the work require-\nments and family wage assumptions implied in retirement poli-\ncies and expectations about women's family and gender roles\n(Belgrave, 1989). Analyses of gender or race differences in ob-\njective retirement processes can identify the sources (e.g, dis-\nability) and economic consequences (e.g., reduced benefits) of\natypical retirement transitions among societal subgroups\nsonal ramifications (e.g., acceptance of the retiree role and its\nimplications for well-being). Consideration of subjective retire-\nment definitions would, therefore, seem particularly important\nto further understanding of retirement processes and their con-\nsequences among women and minorities.\nIn this article, we aim to enhance understanding of individu-\nals' retiree identity by exploring the conditions under which in-\ndividuals define themselves as retired and the conditions that\ncontribute to disparity between objective and subjective retire-\nment definitions. Examination of the precursors of retirement\nself-definitions can offer insights into potential tensions be-\ntween institutionalized retirement processes and subjective ex-\nperiences by pinpointing which life course experiences and\nconditions, other than institutionalized criteria, contribute to the\nretiree identity. Also, investigation of discrepancies between\nsubjective and objective retirement definitions can show under\nwhich conditions objective retirement transitions promote or\ninhibit assumption of a retiree identity. Race and gender effects\non retirement self-definitions and on disparity between objective\nand subjective retirement definitions, as well as race and gender\ndifferences in the conditions leading to such self-definitions and\ndisparity, can reveal whether observed subgroup differences de-\nrive from exposure to specific life course experiences.\nWe proceed from the assumption that the retiree identity\nevolves from interpretative processes that link institutionalized\nretirement criteria to individuals' current and past experiences,\nthat is, what individuals make of the retiree role (Turner, 1962).\nIndividuals will usually define themselves as retiree if their life\ncircumstances fit institutionalized retirement criteria, that is,\nwhen there is little tension between institutional programs and\nsubjective construction of the life course (Kohli, 1986). Indeed,\nprevious research demonstrates considerable congruity between\nobjective and subjective retirement definitions (Ekerdt &\ncircumstances impede the applicability of societal retirement\ncriteria. Lack ofjob opportunities or disability can bar access to\nthe labor force, and discontinuous work histories may render\nthe exact time of retirement ambiguous (Hardy, 1991; Gibson,\n(e.g., family or volunteer work) may clash with expectations of\nthe retiree role, and housewives especially may find that soci-\netal retirement criteria offer few guidelines for their situation\ntions, interpretative processes grounded in individuals' life\ncourse experiences are likely to play a paramount role in retire-\nment definitions. Thus, the more individuals' cultural and life\ncourse experiences depart from institutionalized patterns, the\nmore their retirement definition processes will shift from mere\nroletaking to rolemaking.\nBased on this argument, four sets of factors can be expected\nto influence retirement definitions: (a) attainments linked to in-\nstitutionalized retirement criteria; (b) life course experiences\npertaining to individuals' work history as well as to the impor-\ntance of the work career in their lives; (c) socioeconomic status;\nand (d) membership in cultural or subcultural groups that de-\nfines the meaning context of work and retirement, influences\naccess to work and retirement benefits, and, to some extent,\nstructures individuals' life course experiences.\nThe institutionalization of retirement in modern societies can\nbe traced to the implementation of Social Security and em-\nan institution, delineates the rights and duties associated with\nthe retiree status, as well as the timing of the transition to\nretirement. At least in the United States (Sainsbury, 1996;\nWilliamson & Pampel, 1993), retirement entitlements both in\nthe public (Social Security) and private sector (employer pen-\nsions) are tied to individuals' work careers (years in the labor\nforce or firm, earnings) and serve as a definitional basis for re-\ntirement status (Ekerdt, Deviney, & Kosloski, 1994). Because\nof their regulatory function (Kohli, 1986), these entitlements re-\nquire at least partial withdrawal from the labor force.\nIndividuals who fail to meet this condition are penalized (re-\nduced benefits). In addition, retirement as an institution estab-\nlishes age expectations for the retirement transition (what Kohli,\n1986, calls chronologization of the life course). Despite the\nabolishment of mandatory retirement, such expectations persist\nthrough age constraints in the Social Security program. Thus,\ninstitutionalized retirement criteria combine attainment of enti-\ntlements (receipt of Social Security or pensions), fulfillment of\nobligations (continuous employment, withdrawal from the\nlabor force at age 62 or 65), and achievement of retirement age.\nHowever, premises of the male breadwinner role and the family\nwage that are inherent in many Social Security and pension\nschemes (Sainsbury, 1996) sever, to some extent, the direct link\nbetween individuals' own work careers and their retirement en-\ntitlements. Consequently, selected features of individuals' mari-\ntal history (length of marriages, widowhood), as well as their\nspouses' work careers and benefit entitlements, also become\npart of institutionalized retirement criteria.\nInherent in institutionalized retirement is the presumption of\na life course which is characterized by fairly uninterrupted work\ncareers, withdrawal from the labor force at a certain age, and a\nfamily wage. Whenever these criteria are not met, individuals\neither may not qualify for benefits at all or may receive some-\ntimes substantially reduced benefits (DeViney & Solomon,\ndiscrepancies between the \"normative life course\" (as reflected\nin institutionalized criteria) and individuals' own life course ex-\nperiences, may give rise to subjective retirement definitions that\ndiffer from institutionalized criteria. Several conditions account\nfor such discrepancies. First, institutionalized public and private\ncriteria may diverge. Employer pensions and employer retire-\nment incentives sometimes induce individuals to leave their\njobs before they are eligible for Social Security benefits\n1996). In such cases, persons may either retire early, that is,\nleave the labor force prior to the age criteria set by Social\nSecurity, or take on a bridge job until they qualify for Social\nSecurity benefits. In this situation, assumption of the retiree\nidentity is ambiguous--it may occur either at the time of with-\ndrawal from the main career or at the time of final withdrawal\nfrom the labor force.\nSecond, retirement transitions diverge increasingly from the\ntraditional abrupt and complete labor force withdrawal at the\ninstitutionalized (Social Security) retirement age. Some indi-\nviduals may continue employment (perhaps at reduced hours or\nin bridge jobs) past the usual retirement age, either because\nthey enjoy their careers or because of financial need. Once\nagain this may create discrepancies between institutionalized\nretirement criteria (especially age and benefit receipt) and a\nperson's self-definition as retiree. In addition, the self-employed\ntend toward a more gradual and blurred withdrawal from the\nlabor force than those employed by others (Mutchler, Burr,\nPienta, & Massagli, 1997), which is likely to render a clear de-\nmarcation between work and retirement more difficult. Others\nmay be forced out of the labor force (either for health reasons\nor for lack ofjob opportunities) before selected institutionalized\nretirement criteria are met. These individuals may meet the re-\ntirement criterion of withdrawal from the labor force but reject\na retiree identity because of the involuntary nature of such with-\nIn addition, the retiree identity is likely to reflect the impor-\ntance and continuity of the work role in individuals' lives.\nPersons with discontinuous work histories may find it difficult\nto demarcate the exact time of retirement or view themselves as\nwhereas those with marginal attachments to the labor force but\nheavy involvement in nonpaid labor (e.g., housewives) may re-\nject either the retiree identity altogether, or base it on other life\ncircumstances such as the retirement of the spouse (Adelman et\nLife circumstances that do not fit the patterns implied in institu-\ntionalized retirement programs predominate among selected popu-\nlation groups, especially women and minorities. This is evident\nfrom race and gender differences in the meaning of and reasons for\nthe prevalence of inconsistency among retirement criteria\ncontributing to ambiguities in the retirement definition of women is\ntheir heavy involvement in family roles and its consequences.\nWomen's involvement in family roles competes with their role as\nemployee and often results in discontinuous work histories (Pienta,\nBurr, & Mutchler, 1994) that render distinctions between work in-\nterruptions and retirement more difficult (Belgrave, 1989; Sherrell\nwork is likely to prevail among women with early and/or multiple\nchildbearing histories. Probably because of continuing family work\nobligations, women also attach a different meaning to retirement\nthan men. Whereas men view retirement as a distinct life transition\n(new beginning, imposed disruption, transition to old age), women\nstress continuity in their pre- and post-retirement lives (Hanson &\nWapner, 1994). Discontinuities in their work histories, as well as\nsex discrimination in the labor market, often result in low retire-\nment incomes among women. Consequently, divorced women\nwho do not qualify for husbands' benefits may have to postpone\nlabor force withdrawal past the institutionalized retirement age to\nsecure adequate retirement incomes (Morgan, 1992; DeViney,\nAssumption of the retiree identity may be adapted subjec-\ntively to fit societal prescriptions about gender roles in the mari-\ntal system. Because husbands continue to be viewed as main\nproviders, they may reject the retiree role or postpone retirement\nbeyond institutionalized retirement age as long as their wives are\nstill employed. Research indicates, for example, that a spouse's\nlabor force participation serves as a strong incentive to remain in\ntired husbands exerting pressure on their wives to retire as well\nmay contribute to inconsistency in retirement definitions, if\nwives leave the labor force before they reach pension or Social\nSecurity eligibility (Skirboll & Silverman, 1992; Szinovacz,\n1989). Wives may self-define as retirees on the basis of their\nhusbands' retirement status (Belgrave, 1989), and widows may\nbase retirement self-definitions on the receipt of widow pen-\nsions. Thus, spouse's retirement and widowhood can promote\nself-definitions as retiree and disparity between objective and\nsubjective retirement definitions. Because men's breadwinner\nrole places primary importance on their work achievements, we\nexpect family and marital life experiences to have a more pro-\nfound influence on women's than on men's retiree identity.\nDiscrimination in the labor market, as well as disability, have\nbeen linked to early labor force withdrawal and/or unemploy-\nment in later life among minorities (Burr et al., 1996; Hayward &\ncumstances promote involuntary exits from paid employment,\nminorities may reject the retiree identity. For example, African\nAmericans define themselves more in terms of a sick role than as\nGrady, 1990) and frequently exit the labor force because of dis-\nabling health conditions (Hayward et al., 1996). Similarly,\nmarginal attachment to the labor force among minorities through-\nout the life course may render the retirement transition (i.e., the\ntransition from intermittent employment or unemployment to\nfinal labor force withdrawal) blurred, if not meaningless.\nIn summary, we contend that the retiree identity emerges\nfrom the complex interplay between institutionalized retirement\ncriteria, individuals' life course experiences, and cultural con-\ntext. To the extent that individuals' life course experiences do\nnotfitthe life course implied in institutionalized retirement pro-\ngrams, clear demarcations of the retirement transition become\nambiguous. Consequently, such life course experiences (and\nsociocultural contexts that sustain and bolster exposure to these\nlife course experiences) will promote rejection of the retiree\nidentity when selected institutionalized retirement criteria are\nmet, or assumption of the retiree identity when institutionalized\ncriteria are not met, thus contributing to disparity between se-\nlected institutionalized retirement criteria and individuals' re-\ntiree identity. Based on these premises, we hypothesize:\n1. Women and African Americans will be less likely than men\nand Whites to define themselves as retirees and more likely\nto encounter disparity between subjective retirement and ob-\njective retirement criteria. These race and gender differences\nwill be reduced (though not necessarily eliminated) when in-\nstitutionalized criteria and selected life course experiences\n(disability, work and family histories) are controlled.\n2. Selected characteristics of individuals' life course experi-\nences will influence the retiree identity, as well as disparity\nbetween self-identification as retiree and selected institution-\nalized criteria, beyond the effect of (other) institutionalized\ncriteria (i.e., when such criteria are controlled). Specifically,\nrejection of the retiree identity and disparity between subjec-\ntive retirement and objective retirement criteria will be more\ncommon among individuals who have relatively low in-\ncomes, are self-employed, experienced more and/or longer\nwork disruptions, were seeking employment after their last\njob, receive public assistance, and are disabled.\n3. Attainment of institutionalized retirement criteria (labor\nforce withdrawal, pensions, Social Security benefits, institu-\ntionalized retirement age, spouse's retirement) will promote\nself-identification as retiree.\n4. Disparity between self-definition as retiree and selected insti-\ntutionalized retirement criteria (e.g., self-definition as retiree\namong individuals who are still in the labor force) will be re-\nduced when other institutionalized criteria (benefits, retire-\nment age) are met. However, receipt of employer pensions may\nlead to self-identification as retiree among current workers.\n5. The impact of institutionalized retirement criteria and selected\nlife course experiences on the retiree identity, and on disparity\nbetween self-identification as retiree and selected institutional-\nized criteria, will vary by race and gender. Spouse's retirement,\nthe experience of divorce or widowhood, number of children,\nand timing of births will be more influential for women than\nfor men. Disability is expected to exert greater influence on the\nretiree identity and on disparity between objective and subjec-\ntive retirement definitions of Blacks than ofWhites.\nMETHODS\nSample.--This study relies on secondary analyses of the\nNational Survey of Families and Households (NSFH). The\nNSFH used a multistage area probability sample that was aug-\nmented by oversampling of minorities, one-parent families,\nfamilies with stepchildren, cohabitors, and recently married in-\ndividuals. The original sample (including the oversample) con-\nsisted of 33,869 addresses. These addresses were screened first,\nand successfully screened households were approached for in-\nterviews. First wave interview response rates for the success-\nfully screened households were 73.5% for the main sample,\nand 76.8% for the oversample, resulting in a total sample of\n13,008 respondents. (For a detailed description of the study, see\nSweet, Bumpass, & Call, 1988). The Wave 2 interviews were\ncompleted by 10,008 respondents, representing an attrition rate\nhousehold members aged 19 years or older, their spouses and,\nin some cases, tertiary household members. In both waves, re-\nspondents were interviewed and also completed a self-adminis-\ntered questionnaire. Interviews lasted typically between 70 min-\nutes and two hours.\nThe subsample used in the present analyses consists of respon-\ndents aged 50 to 75 years at Time 2 who reported some employ-\nment during their life and responded to the retirement self-defini-\ntion questions. Reliance on Time 2 responses was necessary\nbecause only this wave contained questions on respondents' self-\ndefinition as retiree. Approximately 14% of respondents failed to\nanswer questions about their self-perception as retiree. Because\nimputation of missing data for this dependent variable may lead\nto overestimates of relationships with the independent variables,\nmissing cases were excluded. This exclusion may compromise\ngeneralizability slightly. Comparisons between respondents who\ndid and those who did not answer the retirement self-definition\nquestions reveal that missing cases are somewhat overrepre-\nsented among individuals with lower incomes and health prob-\nlems. However, the differences are quite small (r < .10), and\nthere are no significant differences between respondents and\nnonrespondents by gender, race, marital status, receipt of pen-\nsions, or unemployment. Also excluded were minorities other\nthan African Americans. Subgroups of these minorities\n(Hispanic, Asian, etc.) are too small to allow separate analyses\nand the combined group would represent populations with quite\ndivergent employment histories and socioeconomic back-\ngrounds. The resulting subsample size is 1,633, unweighted.\nMeasures.--The dependent variables are individuals' self-\ndefinition as retiree as well as two measures of disparity be-\ntween subjective retirement definition and objective retirement\ncriteria, namely, labor force participation and benefit receipt.\nSelf-reported retirement was derived from responses to the\nquestion: \"At this time, do you consider yourself partly retired,\nfully retired, or not retired at all?\" Laborforce participation\nwas derived from respondents' reported work hours at Time 2.\nThose who reported some work hours during the past week\nand/or indicated that they usually engage in employment activi-\nties were considered employed, those with 0 work hours re-\ntired. Receipt of benefits was based on questions about pension\nreceipt and income from diverse sources. Respondents who in-\ndicated that they currently received a pension, or reported in-\ncome from private pensions, were coded 1. Also coded 1 were\nindividuals who reported Social Security income and who were\neligible for Social Security (married, divorced, or never married\nrespondents aged 62 and older, and widows aged 60 and older).\nComputations of disparity between laborforce participation\nand self-reported retirement rely on employment status and\nwork hours. Respondents were deemed to be congruent if they:\n(a) reported to be employed and indicated they were \"not at all\nretired;\" (b) classified themselves as \"partly retired\" and\nworked less than 40 hours per week; and (c) reported no em-\nployment and considered themselves \"fully retired.\" There are\ntwo groups whose subjective and objective retirement defini-\ntions are incongruent. The first group contains individuals who\nindicate that they work 40 or more hours per week, but con-\nsider themselves partly or fully retired, as well as those who\nwork (regardless of work hours) and report full retirement. The\nsecond group consists of respondents who are not employed\nbut identify themselves as not retired or only partly retired.\nFrequencies for this variable revealed that only very few per-\nsons fell into the first group (N=41 or 2.4%). These individuals,\nas well as respondents with inconsistent employment informa-\ntion (employed with 0 work hours, N=31) were excluded from\nthe final analyses. Thus, Ate for this dependent variable are\nsmaller than Ns for the other dependent variables.\nDisparity between benefits and self-reported retirement was\ncoded congruent if respondents reported either no benefits and\nnot being retired, or if they considered themselves retired\n(partly or fully) and received benefits. Those receiving benefits\nbut classifying themselves as \"not retired at all\" constitute one\nincongruent group (benefits, not retired), whereas individuals\nwithout benefits but self-reported partial or full retirement make\nup the second incongruent group (retired, no benefits). The dis-\ntribution of the dependent variables is shown in Table 1.\nIndependent variables.--Three sets of independent variables\nwere used in the analyses: background variables, institutional-\nized retirement criteria, and selected life course experiences and\ncircumstances.\nBackground characteristics were gender, race, education, re-\nspondent's and spouse's income, and receipt of public assis-\ntance. Education was coded in years, with a range from 0 to 18.\nIncome was based on constructed measures provided in the\nNSFH. The income variable used here is respondent's total in-\ncome from all sources. Income was coded in $100 units and\nlogged. Spouse's income was dichotomized ($30,000 and over\n= 1, other = 0). Information on public assistance was based on\nreported income sources. A code of 1 was assigned if respon-\ndents reported income from public assistance (welfare, AFDC,\ngeneral assistance, food stamps, or SSI). Even though income\nand public assistance overlap, we include both variables be-\ncause receipt of public assistance may have different ramifica-\ntions for the retiree identity than low income per se.\nThe life experiences and conditions included in the analyses\nwere disability, marital status, fertility, and work history. Work\ndisability was based on a question concerning limitations in ac-\ntivities of daily living. Working for pay was one of the listed ac-\ntivities. Respondents indicated whether they were limited \"a lit-\ntle\" or \"a lot.\" These responses were used as dummy variables,\nand respondents with no limitations are the omitted category.\nBecause past experiences of divorce or widowhood may affect\nthe retiree identity, we conducted initial analyses that consid-\nered the influence of length of time married, divorced, or wid-\nowed, as well as whether currently married persons had been\ndivorced or widowed. These analyses revealed that only past\nexperiences of widowhood had significant effects on any of the\ndependent variables. Thus, marital status was captured through\nfour dummy variables: currently widowed, currently divorced,\nnever married, and currently married after widowhood. Married\nindividuals without experiences of widowhood are the refer-\nence group. Fertility was measured with number of children\nborn and the timing of the first birth (early = age 21 or under,\nlate = age 30 or over, reference = 22 to 29). An additional set of\ndummy variables capturing the time interval between first and\nlast births did not contribute to the models once number and\ntiming of births was considered. The following work history\nvariables were used in the analyses: total number of years in the\nTable 1.

Number of work interruptions was also based on work\nhistories from both waves. Because three or more interruptions\nwere quite rare, we created a dummy variable (1 = two or more\ninterruptions, 0-1 interruption = reference). Recent work dis-\nruptions may be indicative of blurred retirement transitions.\nThis variable was derived from the Wave 2 work histories and\ncoded 1 = yes, 0 = no. Self-employment (at Time 1) was de-\nrived from reported self-employment income. Those with such\nincome were coded 1, all others 0. Time 1 self-employment\nwas used to avoid overlap with current labor force participation.\nInstitutionalized retirement criteria consist of age, benefits, and\nlabor force participation. To reflect distance from institutionalized\nretirement age, the age variable was divided into five categories:\nachieved retirement age (65-69) were used as reference, the other\nage groups were treated as dummy variables.

In\naddition, data on pension and (separately) Social Security income\nwere obtained during the interviews. Receipt of pensions and\nSocial Security were coded as dummy variables (1 = reports a\npension and/or pension income; 1 = receives Social Security in-\ncome). The same procedure was used for spouses' pensions.\nBecause of multicollinearity with the marital status variables,\nspouses' receipt of Social Security was not included in the analy-\nses. Labor force participation was coded into three dummy vari-\nables: employed full-time (30 hours or more), employed part-time\n(1-29 hours), andjob seekers (individuals who are currently not\nworking but had looked for work since their last employment).\nThose not employed and not looking for work serve as reference.\nFor spouses, we included subjective retirement (is fully retired =\n1) rather than employment status. The two variables are highly\ncorrelated and spouse's retirement identity proved to be the better\npredictor in preliminary analyses.\nAnalyses.--The analyses consist of multinomial or dichoto-\nmous logistic regressions. We first tested models (Model 1 in\nthe tables) including only race, gender, and age to assess the in-\nfluence of these variables independent of the other independent\nvariables. Race X gender interactions proved to be not signifi-\ncant for all dependent variables. In the second model, life\ncourse experiences (education, disability, marital status, fertil-\nity, and work history) were added. We then tested models that\nincluded race, gender, selected life course experiences, other\nbackground variables, and the appropriate institutionalized re-\ntirement criteria. Criteria implied in the dependent variables\n(labor force participation and job seeking for analyses of dis-\nparity between labor force participation and retiree identity and\nbenefits, except spouse's pension, for analyses of disparity be-\ntween benefits and retiree identity) were excluded as indepen-\ndent variables. Based on these analyses, the final models\n(Model 3 in the tables) contain gender, race, age, disability, and\nmarital status, as well as those life course experiences and insti-\ntutionalized criteria that contributed to model fit.\nFor the analyses pertaining to retiree serf-definitions (Table 2),\nwe are interested in contrasts between those who self-define as\nfully or partly, compared with those who self-define as not re-\ntired, as well as contrasts between self-definitions as full and part\nretirees. Consequently, the same models were estimated twice,\nonce with \"not retired\" and once with \"fully retired\" as base cate-\ngory. Modelfitfor these two models is, of course, the same.\nDue to small Ns, race interactions were tested only for dis-\nability. Predicted gender interactions were tested both in the life\nexperience models and in the final models. In addition, we also\nsystematically tested for gender interactions with all institution-\nalized retirement criteria and with the work history variables.\nContinuous variables used in interaction terms were centered\nAll analyses rely on weighted data. Sample selection for the\nNSFH relied on a complex survey design where selection into\nthe sample is not independent of other respondents. This can lead\nto an underestimation of error variances and covariances. Our use\nof sampling weights, strata, and PSUs in the analysis is intended\nto reduce this problem. Both the logistic and multinominal logis-\ntic regressions were estimated using the complex survey design\nmethods provided by Stata (Stata, 1997). Specifically, Stata uses\npseudomaximum likelihood estimates for error variances. For\noverall modelfit,Wald-F is produced and reported. We also esti-\nmated unweighted equations (not shown) and found the error\nvariances to be smaller in these equations. We decided to follow\nthe more conservative method and used the weights.\nRESULTS\nIn view of the number of dependent variables and the com-\nplexity of findings, we discuss results in conjunction with each\nhypothesis (and across the tables) rather than for individual de-\npendent variables. Gender and race interaction terms are not\nshown in the tables, but reported throughout the results section.\nRace/gender.--Hypothesis 1 posits direct race and gender\neffects on retiree self-definitions and on disparity between serf-\ndefinitions and attainment of institutionalized retirement crite-\nria. The results do not confirm the hypothesized race effect, but\nprovide some support for gender effects. There are no signifi-\ncant race X gender interactions. Women are less likely than\nTable 3.

Gender also influences disparity between objective\nretirement criteria and self-definitions. Women are more prone\nthan men to reject an identity as full retiree when they are not in\nthe labor force (Table 3) and to provide serf-definitions that are\nincongruent with benefits receipt (Table 4). None of these gen-\nder effects is maintained when various life course experiences\nand, especially, institutionalized criteria are included in the\nmodels. This suggests that gender differences in the retiree\nidentity can be attributed to divergent life course experiences\nand attainment of institutionalized retirement criteria.\nAge.--Age exerts a significant influence on retirement self-\ndefinitions. Persons under institutionalized retirement age tend to\nself-define as not retired, whereas those aged 70 and older favor\nself-definitions as fully, rather than partly, retired. However, these\neffects are only partially maintained when other institutionalized\nretirement criteria are controlled (Model 3, Table 2). The age ef-\nfects vary somewhat by gender. Specifically, men under age 60\nare more prone than women to reject a retiree identity (b=l.79,\np<.0l for fully vs not retired; and \u00a3=-1.85, p<.0l for partly ver-\nsus fully retired). The data also confirm age effects on disparity\nbetween self-definitions and institutionalized criteria. Disparity\nbetween self-definition and employment is particularly rare\namong those aged 70 and older. However, individuals in this age\ngroup are more likely to reject a retiree identity after benefit re-\nceipt, a finding that might indicate persistent rejection of the re-\ntiree identity among some individuals.

In addition,\nselected life circumstances were predicted to have a greater im-\npact on women than on men (Hypothesis 5). To assess the ef-\nfects of life circumstances, we first present a model that ex-\ncludes institutionalized retirement criteria and economic\nbackground (Model 2 in all tables), and then discuss the full\nmodels (Model 3 in all tables). Note that selected life circum-\nstances with no effect on the dependent variable were dropped\nfrom somefinalmodels.\nThe data leave little doubt that disability contributes to retiree\nself-definitions, as well as to disparity between self-definitions\nand institutionalized retirement criteria. Generally, severely dis-\nabled persons tend to assume a retiree identity (they are more\nlikely to define themselves as partly or fully rather than not re-\ntired, and as fully, rather than only partly, retired). Except for the\ncomparison between part and full retirement, these effects are\nmaintained when institutionalized retirement criteria and other\ncontrols are included in the model. Severe disability also pro-\nmotes self-definitions as retiree among individuals who cur-\nrently receive no benefits, and it discourages self-definitions as\nnot retired among beneficiaries. However, disparity between\nself-definition as retiree and employment status is not contingent\non severe disability. The effects of mild disability differ by race\nand gender. Mild disability tends to promote self-definitions as\nretired, especially among Blacks (\u00a3=1 .82, p<.05 for partly vs\nnot retired; and b=1.88, p<.05 for full vs not retired) and among\nmen (b=-l.lS,p<.05). Disparity between self-definitions and\ninstitutionalized criteria is not affected by mild disability.\nMarital status also exerts some influence on the retiree iden-\ntity. Because several of these effects are confounded with bene-\nfit receipt, age, and employment status (as indicated by differ-\nences between Models 2 and 3), we focus on relationships in\nModel 3. Widowhood is associated with serf-definitions of not,\nrather than partly, or fully, rather than partly, retired, and remar-\nried widows (but not remarried widowers, \u00a3=3.89, p<.0l) tend\nto self-define as fully, rather than not, retired. In addition, both\nwidowhood and remarriage after widowhood encourage self-\ndefinitions as not retired among beneficiaries. Never married\nindividuals are particularly unlikely to self-define as retiree be-\nfore benefit receipt, and never married women favor serf-defini-\ntions as part, rather than full, retirees (\u00a3=2.24, p<.05).\nThe data provide limited support for effects of fertility history\non retirement definitions. Self-definitions as retiree are less com-\nmon among those who delayed childbearing and those with more\nchildren, but these effects are eliminated once institutionalized re-\ntirement criteria are included. Delay of childbearing, as well as\nhaving more children, encourages rejection of a retiree identity\namong individuals who receive benefits. Number of children born\nis more important for rejection of the retiree identity among fe-\nmale beneficiaries (\u00a3=.26,/K.01), and women who delayed child-\nbearing are also less likely to self-define as retirees when they are\nnot employed (\u00a3=1.33,/?<.05). This latter relationship is elimi-\nnated once institutionalized retirement criteria are controlled.\nThere is considerable evidence that past work history is re-\nflected in the retiree identity. Number of years in the labor force\ncontributes to the assumption of a retiree identity (partly or\nfully, rather than not, retired in Model 3). The significant gen-\nder interactions in Model 2 (\u00a3=-.06, p<.05 for partly vs fully\nretired, and \u00a3=.06, p<.0l for fully vs not retired) become non-\nsignificant once the institutionalized retirement criteria are in\nthe equation. Furthermore, those with longer work histories\ntend to self-define as retirees when they are no longer in the\nlabor force and when they receive benefits.\nRecent work disruptions (since Wave 1 of the survey) tend to\nencourage self-definitions as partly retired and to discourage an\nidentity as full retiree. The former effect (partly vs not retired) is\nstronger for men (\u00a3=-1.34, p<.05), whereas the latter effect (full\nvs not retired) is stronger among women (\u00a3=-1.27, p<.05).\nNeither gender interaction is maintained in Model 3. In addition,\nthose who experienced work disruptions between waves are less\nlikely to self-define as retirees when they are not in the labor force.\nThis effect is more pronounced for men in Model 2 (\u00a3=-1.74,\n/K.01), though the gender interaction is not significant in Model 3.\nFormer self-employment has divergent effects on the retiree\nidentity in Models 2 and 3. When institutionalized criteria are not\ncontrolled (Model 2), self-employment contributes to identifica-\ntions as part, rather than full, and as full, rather than not, retired.\nOnce institutionalized criteria are included, only the former effect\nremains significant. Self-employment does not impinge on dis-\nparity between self-definitions and attainment of institutionalized\nretirement criteria. Education and number of labor force exits\nhave no influence on self-definitions or disparity.\nOverall, these findings substantiate that life circumstances\nother than institutionalized retirement criteria impinge on the\nretiree identity. Individuals whose life experiences deviate from\ninstitutionalized patterns tend to reject the retiree identity. The\ninfluence of fertility and, to some extent, marital status on the\nretiree identity seems to be tied to their relationships to attain-\nment of institutionalized criteria, whereas work history effects\nin general and disability effects among African Americans ap-\npear to be relatively independent of such attainments. Family-\nrelated influences (fertility, marital status) play a somewhat\ngreater role among women, whereas disability and work dis-\nruptions have more of an impact on men's retiree identity.\nInstitutionalized retirement criteria.--According to Hypothe-\nses 3 and 4, attainment of institutionalized retirement criteria is\nexpected to enhance self-definitions as retiree and to encourage\ncongruence between self-definitions and institutionalized retire-\nment criteria. The data lend some support to these hypotheses.\nReceipt of Social Security and employer pensions signifi-\ncantly contributes to self-definitions as partly or fully retired,\ncompared with being not retired, and pension receipt also dis-\ncourages self-definitions of partly, rather than fully, retired. The\neffect of pensions varies significantly by gender (\u00a3=-1.67,\nnot retired). Receipt of pensions contributes more to men's than\nto women's retiree identity. In contrast to Hypothesis 4, pen-\nsions did not influence disparity between employment and re-\ntiree self-definitions and were dropped from Model 3.\nCurrent labor force participation exerts a strong influence on\nself-definitions. Full-time employed individuals tend to assume\nan identity as not retired, and they are more likely to see them-\nselves as only partly, rather than fully, retired. As might be ex-\npected, part-time employment enhances self-definitions as\npartly, rather than fully, retired, and it also contributes to self-\ndefinitions as not retired, rather than fully retired. The latter ef-\nfect is considerably stronger for men than for women (b=-2.60,\np<.05). In addition, employment status impinges on disparity\nbetween benefit receipt and self-definitions. Full-time employ-\nees tend to assume an identity that corresponds with their em-\nployment status rather than their benefit receipt. Specifically,\nthey are less likely to self-define as retiree when they receive no\nbenefits and more likely to self-define as partly or not retired,\neven when they receive benefits.\nThose who lack employment opportunities (job seeking) favor\ndefinitions of part over full retirement, and they are also more likely\nto self-define as not retired after receiving benefits. However,\nwomen (b=4.14, p<.0l) who looked for work especially tend to\nself-define as retirees before reaching benefit eligibility.\nOur results also confirm the notion that spouse's employ-\nment is reflected in the retiree identity. Spouse's retirement in-\ncreases the probability of self-defining as fully, rather than\npartly or not, retired. Furthermore, spouse's retirement con-\ntributes to self-definition as retiree among persons who do not\nreceive benefits. Contrary to our expectations, these relation-\nships do not vary by gender. On the other hand, spouse's retire-\nment reduces the likelihood of disparity between self-definition\nand labor force participation. Individuals with retired spouses\ntend to adopt a retiree identity when they are not in the labor\nforce, and this trend is more pronounced for women than men\n(b=-l.lS,p<.01). While spouse's retirement has relatively con-\nsistent effects on retirement definitions, spouse's pensions have\nonly a marginal impact. Those whose spouses receive pensions\nare particularly unlikely to self-define as retirees without re-\nceiving benefits themselves.\nGenerally, thesefindingsindicate that institutionalized retire-\nment criteria have been internalized and serve as strong anchor\npoints for individuals' self-definition as retiree. Moreover, the\neffects of institutionalized criteria are additive, that is, attain-\nment of specific institutionalized retirement criteria contributes\nto the retiree identity, even when fulfillment of other criteria is\ncontrolled. Pensions and attainment of institutionalized retire-\nment age contribute more to men's than women's retiree iden-\ntity, whereas lackingjob opportunities and spouse's retirement\ntend to further disparity between women's self-definitions and\ntheir attainment of institutionalized criteria.\nEconomic status.--Variables considered under economic\nbackground are respondent's income, spouse's income, and re-\nceipt of public assistance. Neither income nor spouse's income\ninfluence self-definitions as retiree, though respondents' in-\ncome has some effect on disparity. Respondents with higher in-\ncomes are more likely to assume a retiree identity when they\nleave the labor force. In addition, self-definitions as retiree\namong individuals who are not beneficiaries become less com-\nmon as income increases. This latter effect applies foremost to\nCurrent receipt of public assistance relates significantly to re-\ntiree self-definitions, as well as to disparity between self-defini-\ntions and selected institutionalized retirement criteria.\nRecipients of public assistance are less likely to self-define as\npartly, rather than either not retired at all or fully retired. Self-\ndefinition as partly, rather than not, retired is particularly un-\ncommon among men (b=2.92, p<.05), whereas female public\nassistance recipients are more likely than their male counter-\nparts to identify as fully, rather than not, retired (b=2.96, p<.0\\).\nIn addition, women who receive public assistance are less prone\nthan men to describe themselves as not retired once they re-\nceive Social Security or pensions (b=-3.14,p<.05).\nOverall, economic status plays a relatively minor role in retire-\nment self-definitions. Among men, economic achievements ap-\npear to reinforce self-identification in line with institutionalized\ncriteria, whereas women on public assistance favor a retiree\nidentity.\nCONCLUSION\nThis study's focus on the retiree identity complements earlier\nresearch that centered foremost on objective or institutionalized\nretirement criteria. We conceptualize retirement self-identifica-\ntion as a complex process which reflects potential tensions be-\ntween individuals' own life circumstances and experiences on\nthe one hand, and the expectations derived from institutional-\nized retirement programs and policies on the other hand (Kohli,\n1986). Such tensions were expected to derive from differences\nbetween public and private retirement criteria (Social Security\nvs employer pensions), from blurred or nonvoluntary labor\nforce exits, and from experiences that diverge from the life\ncourse implied in institutionalized retirement programs and pre-\ndominate among minorities and women. They should manifest\nthemselves in the extent to which individuals assume a retiree\nidentity and in the overlap between self-definitions and attain-\nment of institutionalized retirement criteria.\nThefindingsconfirm that institutionalized retirement criteria\nserve as foundation for individuals' self-definition as retiree\nthough all criteria (employment status, pension receipt, Social\nSecurity income, and attainment of institutionalized retirement\nage) independently contribute to the retiree identity, employ-\nment status apparently takes precedence over other criteria. Not\nonly is the association between employment and self-identifica-\ntion as retiree stronger than the relationships between the retiree\nidentity and other institutionalized criteria, but employment sta-\ntus also promotes self-definitions as retiree when other retire-\nment criteria are not met. Moreover, the extent of individuals'\nemployment is clearly reflected in their self-identifications.\nBecause institutionalized programs imply a family wage, we\nfurther expected that spouses' retirement or pensions would\ncontribute to the retiree identity. The results confirm especially\nthe effect of spouses' retirement on self-identifications (which\ncovary strongly with spouses' employment status), suggesting\nperhaps a \"couple retiree identity\" among married individuals.\nIncongruence between public and private criteria seems to\nplay only a minor role in retirement self-identification pro-\ncesses. More important for the retiree identity are labor force\nexits that are not clearly demarcated or involuntary. The self-\nemployed, as well as \"discouraged\" workers (those looking for\njobs after their last employment), tend to describe themselves\nas partly, rather than fully, retired. Financial attainments tend to\nencourage self-definitions as retiree foremost among men.\nThere is consistent evidence that disability influences the retiree\nidentity. Contrary to our expectations, disability tends to promote\nself-definitions as retiree. For mild disability, this tendency pre-\nvails among Blacks and men. The race differences especially con-\ntradict earlier research. Closer comparison between previous re-\ntion wording may be responsible for the divergent results. The\nNSFH question asks respondents whether they consider them-\nselves retired and provides a forced choice among full, partly, or\nnot retired with no differentiation within the \"not retired\" cate-\ngory, whereas in the National Survey of BlackAmericans used by\nGibson (1987) \"respondents were asked to explain why they were\nnot working. The eightfixedchoices were homemaker, physically\ndisabled, welfare, student, retired, transportation problems, cannot\nfind ajob, and do not wish ajob\" (p. 694). It is conceivable that\nthe latter question evokes responses that refer to reasons for retire-\nment rather than to the retiree identity itself. On the other hand,\nthe NSFH may encourage self-definitions as retiree because it\ndoes not provide the option to identify as disabled. Because\nBlacks are more likely to retire for health reasons (Hayward et al.,\n1996), they may be more likely than Whites to indicate \"disabled\"\nas their main reason for not working, rather than choosing \"re-\ntired,\" which may be associated with an expected and voluntary\nretirement transition. We suggest that identification with the re-\ntiree role among disabled workers carries greater psychological\nbenefits than identification with a sick role. Retirement is a so-\ncially sanctioned role, and early retirement has become an ac-\ncepted life choice, whereas a long-term sick role is not socially\nsanctioned and may have particularly negative connotations\namong older persons (\"old and sick\"). Within this context it is also\nunderstandable that mildly disabled women are less likely to iden-\ntify with a retiree role than men with similar health limitations--\nthe role of housewife (not retired and not in the labor force) may\nbe seen as more acceptable than that of early and involuntary re-\ntiree. Given the small frequencies, especially for minorities, these\nconclusions clearly warrant further substantiation.\nPast employment experiences exert a significant influence on the\nretiree identity. Work histories thatfitthe expectation of life-long\nwork with few disruptions apparently render the retirement transi-\ntion less ambiguous and promote acceptance of the retiree role.\nWe further hypothesized that life experiences other than work\nhistory and spouses' retirement or benefit status would influence\nthe retiree identity, especially among women. Support for this\nhypothesis is very weak. While marital status and fertility his-\ntory exert some influence on selected dependent variables, these\neffects are often inconsistent, and in some cases more pro-\nnounced, for men than women. The only finding in line with the\nexpected gender differences is that high fertility enhances rejec-\ntion of the retiree identity among women beneficiaries. The\noverall trend implied in the gender differences is that men's,\ncompared with women's, retiree identity is more stronglytiedto\ntheir own attainments of institutionalized retirement criteria and\nof a continuous and successful work career. This would suggest\nmoreflexibilityin women's retiree identity according to a vari-\nety of circumstances; a finding which is consistent with the in-\ntent, though not the specific predictions of, Hypothesis 2.\nOur data have implications both for measurement and theoret-\nical approaches to retirement research. They support the empha-\nsis on labor force participation, rather than age or benefits, as the\nmain criterion used in retirement research. However, some incon-\ngruence between self-definitions and institutionalized retirement\ncriteria occur among part-time and self-employed individuals,\nand both conditions may have somewhat different connotations\nfor women and men. Thus, future research needs to explore under\nwhat circumstances part-time and self-employed workers should\nbe classified as workers or as retirees, or for whom part- and self-\nemployment constitutes a \"bridge job.\" In addition, researchers\nwill need to keep in mind that institutionalized retirement criteria\ncontain somewhat of a White, middle-class, male bias. Thefitbe-\ntween institutionalized criteria and self-definitions is best for men\nwith continuous and successful work careers. Our results indicate\nthat the influence of selected life circumstances differs by gender\nand race, and that some of these gender and race interactions are\nmaintained when institutionalized retirement criteria, work histo-\nries, and economic status are in the equations. It is conceivable\nthat gender and race affect the importance of the work role in in-\ndividuals' lives, but further research on the reasons for race and\ngender differences in retirement definitions is clearly indicated\nMuschkin, 1996). For example, future research should address\nquestions such as: Does rejection of the retiree identity among\nthose who meet selected institutionalized retirement criteria (or\nself-definition as retiree among those who do not meet these cri-\nteria) have divergent consequences for the self-image, attitudes,\nor behaviors of men and women, or of African Americans and\nWhites? Can retirement programs and policies appeal to or be\nsuccessful among individuals who do not follow the life course\nimplied in traditional programs and policies?\nFuture research is also essential to determine how question\nand answer categories affect findings concerning retirement sta-\ntus and retiree identity. Our results on disability suggest that re-\ntirement reasons and retirement self-identifications may di-\nverge, and our overall findings suggest that the retiree identity\nis not always synonymous with attainment of institutionalized\nretirement criteria. Whether and to what extent these differ-\nences influence results concerning the predictors and conse-\nquences of retirement remains unclear. For example, predictors\nand consequences of labor force exits may diverge among\nwomen who define their labor force withdrawal as a transition\nfrom employment to housewife, and those who perceive it as a\ntransition from employment to retiree.\nMore generally, our research underlines the need to couch\nretirement transition processes within a theoretical perspective\nthat is sensitive to differences, not only in life experiences them-\nselves, but also in their consequences for and interpretation by\ndivergent societal subgroups. Focusing more research on the re-\ntiree identity may help clarify the meaning context of retire-\nment and, thereby, contribute to enhanced concept validity and\ntheoretical advancement in studies of retirement transitions.\n"
