We\nhypothesize that young adults interviewed after Septem-\nber 11 will report increased feelings of sadness and psy-\nchological distress, lower levels of general health, and re-\nduced life expectancy when compared with those\ninterviewed before September 11. We hypothesize that\nyoung adults interviewed after September 11 will report\nincreased closeness to parents and mentors, importance\nof religion and spirituality, trust in government, blood\ndonation, contact with friends, and substance use than\nthose interviewed before September 11. We hypoth-\nesize that differences associated with exposure will be in-\nfluenced by the passage of time, distance from terrorist\nsites, and previous psychiatric illness.\nMETHODS\nAll Add Health procedures have been approved by the Univer-\nsity of North Carolina School of Public Health Institutional Re-\nview Board on Research Involving Human Subjects.\nThis analysis uses data collected in wave III of Add Health. The\nsampling design for Add Health has been described in detail else-\nwhere.19,20 In brief, it is a panel study of a nationally representa-\ntive sample of adolescents who appeared on enrollment rosters\ntargeted all wave I respondents living in the continental United\nStates, Hawaii, and Alaska. The sample for our study was lim-\nited to those aged 18 to 26 years, interviewed between July 21,\noccurred at least in part on September 11, 11 that began be-\nfore and ended after September 11, and an additional 3 be-\ncause the intervals between their beginning and ending dates\nspondents.\nAfter obtaining written consent, interviews lasting approxi-\nmately 90 minutes were conducted in homes or other loca-\ntions of the respondents' choice using Computer-Assisted Per-\nsonal Interview and Computer-Assisted Self-Interview\nExposure to September 11\nExposure was measured by the date of the interview.\nSociodemographic Characteristics and Family Structure\nDemographic variables included sex, age, and socioeconomic sta-\ntus. Respondents were coded as having a low socioeconomic sta-\ntus if during the past 12 months they did not have enough money\nto pay their full rent or mortgage, gas, electricity, or oil bill; if they\nwere evicted or lost gas, electric, or oil service because payments\nwere not made; or if a household member received public assis-\ntance or welfare payments before the respondent was 18 years of\nage. Race and ethnicity were measured by self-identification and\ncoded as Latino (if respondents identified themselves to be at least\nin part Hispanic or Latino), white, black or African American,\nAmerican Indian or Native American, or Asian or Pacific Is-\nlander. A modified Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test,22 standard-\nized to scores for those 19 to 24 years of age, measured verbal\nability. Family structure measures included whether respon-\ndents were living with a parent or grandparent, living with at least\n1 child they considered their own child, and married.\nPast Psychiatric Illness\nRespondents were coded as having had a past psychiatric ill-\nness if they reported a prior diagnosis of depression, taking pre-\nscription medications for depression or stress in the past 12\nmonths, or spending at least 1 day in a facility being treated\nfor a mental illness in the past 5 years.\nDistances From the World Trade Center and the Pentagon\nDistances from Manhattan, NY, and from Arlington, Va, were\ncalculated from latitude and longitude measurements of the ZIP\ncodes from which respondents were interviewed, adjusting for\nthe curvature of the earth.23 We also created a variable repre-\nsenting the shorter of these 2 distances, categorized as within\nSadness was measured by the question, \"Were you sad during\nthe past 7 days?\" Responses were selected from a 4-point scale\n(from never or rarely to most or all of the time). A modified\nportion of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression\nScale24 was used to measure feelings and symptoms associated\nwith psychological distress during the past 7 days (, .80). Gen-\neral health was measured by the question, \"In general, how is\nyour health?\" Responses were selected from a 5-point scale (from\nexcellent to poor). Perception of life expectancy was mea-\nsured by the question, \"What do you think are the chances that\nyou will live to age 35?\" Five responses were possible (almost\ncertain, a good chance, a 50-50 chance, some chance but prob-\nably not, and almost no chance).\nPerception of closeness to parents was measured by the\nquestion, \"How close do you feel to your mother/father?\" This\nwas defined as current or most recent residential mother and\nfather, with responses selected from a 5-point scale (from ex-\ntremely close to not close at all). A similar item measured per-\nception of closeness to an identified living mentor. Respon-\ndents rated the importance of their religious faith and spiritual\nlife on 4-point scales (from not important to more important\nthan anything else). Respondents' perceptions of angels were\n\u00a92003 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\nmeasured by asking how strongly they agreed with the state-\nment, \"Angels are present to help or watch over me.\" Re-\nsponses were selected from a 5-point scale (from strongly dis-\nagree to strongly agree). Trust in government was measured\nby respondents reporting how strongly they agreed with state-\nments of trust in federal, state, and local governments on 5-point\nscales (from strongly disagree to strongly agree).\nRespondents were asked if they had donated blood, plasma,\nor platelets in the past year (yes or no). Contact with friends\nwas measured by asking the number of times respondents \"hung\nout\" with friends or talked on the telephone for more than 5\nminutes in the past 7 days (0-7 times). Respondents who said\nthey had ever smoked at least 1 cigarette a day for 30 days were\nasked if they had smoked in the past 30 days (yes or no); if yes,\nthey were asked if they smoked every day and asked about their\naverage number of cigarettes per day. Respondents with his-\ntories of smoking marijuana in the past year were asked how\nmany times they had smoked marijuana in the past 30 days.\nRespondents with histories of alcohol use in the past year were\nasked the number of times they had had 4 or more drinks in a\nrow on a single occasion in the past 2 weeks.\nANALYSES\nDescriptive frequencies were conducted on unweighted data. All\nother analyses were conducted on data weighted to reflect a na-\ntionallyrepresentativesampleofyoungadultsaged18to26years.\nWe constructed sampling weights by adjusting the sum of Wave\nI weights for our wave III respondents to match wave I popula-\ntion estimates for each age and sex group. We used survey esti-\nmation commands in the STATA computer program25 to adjust\nfor clustering and respondents' unequal probability of selection.\nWe conducted separate analyses by sex because of known sex dif-\nferences in reactions to stressful events, including September\nses. We evaluated tests of significance using a Wald statistic for\nsets of covariates and t statistics for individual covariates. We did\nnot impute missing values. To take into account the many analy-\nses conducted, we defined statistical significance as P.01.\nBivariate analyses compared respondents interviewed be-\nfore with those interviewed after September 11, looking for sys-\ntematic biases linked to date of interview. These were followed\nby bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify differences be-\ntween respondents interviewed before and after September 11 in\ndependent variables. First, analyses compared all respondents in-\nterviewed before with all respondents interviewed after Septem-\nber 11. Second, when sample sizes were sufficient, we compared\nall respondents interviewed before with those interviewed dur-\ning each week after September 11 to identify differences in de-\npendent variables during shorter intervals. Third, we investi-\ngated potential interactions between distance from terrorist sites\nandreactionsofrespondents.Becauseinitialanalysesshowedsimi-\nlar results for distance to the World Trade Center, the Pentagon,\nand the closer of the 2, we used the closer distance in final analy-\nses. Finally, we assessed whether reactions varied by self-\nreported history of psychiatric illness. Because of time intervals\nspecified in measures, tobacco and marijuana analyses excluded\nrespondents interviewed within 30 days after September 11, and\nalcohol analyses excluded respondents interviewed between Sep-\nRESULTS\nPARTICIPANTS\n15.5% Latino, and 7.2% Asian). Approximately one quar-\nter (27.1%) were coded as having a low socioeconomic\nstatus. Almost one half (47.6%) were living with a par-\nliving with a son or a daughter. Previous psychiatric ill-\nwere interviewed within 80 km of the World Trade Cen-\nter or the Pentagon; 223 were interviewed between 81\nof these sites.\nComparisons of those interviewed before with those\ninterviewed after September 11 showed no significant dif-\nferences in age (P=.54), race or ethnicity (P=.89), ver-\nbal ability (P=.89), socioeconomic status (P=.42), mari-\ntal status (P=.32), residential children (P=.74), previous\npsychiatric illness (P=.98), or distance from terrorist sites\n(range, P=.42-.49). Respondents interviewed before Sep-\ntember 11 were significantly more likely to live with a\nparent or a grandparent than were those interviewed af-\ncontrolled in all multivariate analyses.\nYoung adults experienced sadness and psychological\ndistress after September 11 (Table). Before September\n11, 33.6% of male respondents reported sadness at least\nsome of the time in the past 7 days, compared with\n39.0% after September 11. Among female respondents,\nreported sadness, compared with 53.3% interviewed\nafter September 11. Comparisons of sadness among\nrespondents interviewed before with those interviewed\nin weekly intervals after September 11 showed that the\nrisk of feeling sad was higher among male respondents\nin the 3 weeks immediately after September 11 (ad-\namong female respondents interviewed in the first, sec-\n1.48, respectively) (Figure 1). The broader measure of\npsychological distress showed a similar pattern for\nfemale respondents.

The pre-\ndominant reactions of young adults who did not di-\nrectly witness events at the World Trade Center or the\nPentagon were feelings of sadness and psychological dis-\ntress, increased importance of religion and spirituality,\nand greater trust in all levels of government. Most of these\nreactions were transient. The striking exception to this\npattern was persistent trust in government. Our find-\nings are consistent with previous research2 on the men-\ntal health impacts of disaster, which suggests that most\nexposed to a disaster do well and have only mild transi-\ntory symptoms. The meaning of young adults' increased\npolitical trust in the aftermath of September 11, its an-\nticipated duration, and its future implications will likely\nbe debated among social and political scientists,27-29 and\nbecome an area for ongoing research.\nThis study highlights the variability in responses to\ndisaster and the critical importance of distinguishing\nbetween national and local reactions.

Our negative findings may\nbe related to use of general emotional outcome mea-\nsures instead of traditional diagnosis-oriented measures\n(eg, symptoms associated with posttraumatic stress dis-\norder), age-cohort differences, or limitations in our mea-\nsures for self-reported past psychiatric illness. Given the\nprevalence of psychiatric illness in the United States, fur-\nther investigation into the potential negative impact and\nclinical implications of even indirect exposure to disas-\nters such as September 11 may be warranted. Other no-\ntable negative findings included similar use of tobacco,\nmarijuana, and alcohol among young adults inter-\nviewed before and after September 11, which is in con-\ntrast to the increased substance use reported among young\nadults in Manhattan after September 11.9 We did not find\ndecreased life expectancy, as reported by Halpern-\nFelsher and Millstein.30\nThis was an opportunistic study. The Add Health\ndata did not include traditional disaster research mea-\nsures for acute stress or posttraumatic stress disorder,\nlimiting our ability to compare results across studies.\nMeasures for many important reactions are likely absent.\nSome measures may not capture important variation,\nlimiting the validity of our negative findings. We could\nnot determine whether any of our participants actually\nwitnessed an event, which may have influenced our\nresults. The study was cross-sectional; although differ-\nences noted in pre-post comparisons likely reflect reac-\ntions to September 11, they do not prove causality.\nFinally, we cannot determine how other factors, such as\nseasonal variation, emerging news about anthrax, or\nmilitary activities, may have contributed to our find-\nDespite limitations, Add Health provides an\nunprecedented description of the reactions of young\nadults in the United States to the events of September\n11. In the unfortunate circumstance that our nation\nfaces a similar event in the future, understanding the\nreactions of young people who do not directly witness a\ndisaster may be useful. Based on this study, we would\npredict that most will experience transient sadness,\nyoung men will turn to religion in the weeks immedi-\nately following a disaster, and young men and women\nwill experience increased trust in the government.\nYoung adults in close proximity to a disaster, particu-\nlarly young women, seem to be most affected, and they\nshould be included in research defining the role of post-\ndisaster interventions.\nThis study was supported in part by the Generalist Phy-\nsician Faculty Scholar Award Program of the Robert Wood\nJohnson Foundation, Princeton, NJ (Dr Ford).\nThis study uses data from the Add Health project, a\nprogram designed by J.
