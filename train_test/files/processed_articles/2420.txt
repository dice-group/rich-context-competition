The prevalence of inade-\nquate sleep in employed adults is higher, with approximately 30% reporting short sleep dura-\ntion (CDC) [1]. This is a particular concern given the growing evidence that short sleep\nduration increases risk for disease and death [5\u00ad7]. By contrast, excessive sleeping has also\nbeen related to increased risk, with speculation that long sleep may be related to risk primarily\nbecause it serves as a proxy indicator that an individual has sleep fragmentation and/or failing\nhealth [5,6,8]. In a recent meta-analysis, both short and long sleep duration are significant pre-\ndictors of all-cause mortality, including cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular deaths.5 How-\never, a majority of these findings [sleep duration-mortality relationship] do not consider other\ndimension of sleep that contribute to sleep quality. Poor sleep quality (e.g. difficulty falling\nasleep, staying asleep, early awakening) has itself been related to risk. However, this relation-\nship is particularly pronounced when occurring with short sleep duration, in which the combi-\nnation of poor sleep quality and short sleep duration predicts higher risk for hypertension, type\n2 diabetes, and mortality than either poor sleep quality or short sleep duration alone [9\u00ad12].\nLikewise, poor sleep quality among long sleepers is predictive of cardiovascular disease [12,13].\nAdditional research is needed to characterize the role of sleep quality in both short and long\nsleepers in relation to biomarkers of disease risk.\nThe mechanisms through which short and long sleep duration, particularly when combined\nwith poor sleep quality, contribute to elevated risk are not clear, but are likely multidimension-\nal. In the case of short sleep duration and poor quality sleep, a prevailing supposition is that in-\nsufficient sleep, either of reduced absolute length or of poor quality, acts as a physiological\nstressor, impacting neurobiological regulation of circadian rhythm [14]. This physiological\nstress leads to a greater burden on the regulatory systems to maintain allostasis under adverse\nconditions, which causes wear and tear across systems, termed allostatic load [14\u00ad16]. Allo-\nstatic load is witnessed by shifts in regulatory set points that imply cumulative burden on those\nsystems. Some examples of shifts in set points include elevated resting blood pressure, in-\ncreased glucose, increased autonomic imbalances, alterations in diurnal patterns of cortisol,\nand inflammation [15,17,18]. Under experimentally induced short sleep duration, either acute\nsleep deprivation or sleep restriction for several days, are reported to cause temporary changes\nin biomarkers for the metabolic, endocrine, autonomic, cardiovascular, and immune systems\n[19\u00ad31]. Similarly, sleep fragmentation, a major component of poor sleep quality, has also been\nshown to impact many of these systems [32\u00ad35]. Chronic short sleep duration, particularly\nwhen combined with poor sleep quality [36], may have cumulative effects with a large body of\nresearch documenting associations of short sleep with higher rates of metabolic syndrome [7],\nevated blood pressure [42\u00ad44]. Chronic poor sleep quality has also been linked to many of\nSleep and Disease Risk\nfurther supported by the following grants M01-\nfrom the General Clinical Research Centers Program\nTranslational Science Award (CTSA) program of the\nNational Center for Research Resources, National\nInstitutes of Health (www.nih.gov).

Short sleep duration is thought to put\nphysical stress on neuroendocrine and automatic regulatory systems [14], with evidence of\nshort sleep being related to shifts in diurnal cortisol rhythms and altered sympathovagal bal-\nance, with elevated sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic control [38,51\u00ad53]. Sleep frag-\nmentation is also thought to modify these neuroendocrine and autonomic regulatory systems\n[32\u00ad35]. Moreover, Vgontzas and colleagues work argues that short sleep when combined with\npoor sleep quality (i.e., insomnia complaints) is particularly detrimental to these systems and\nelevates disease risk [54\u00ad57]. Taken together this work suggests that not getting adequate and\ngood quality sleep impacts regulatory dynamics across neuroendocrine, sympathovagal, car-\ndiovascular, metabolic, and immune systems, and might contribute to multisystem\nbiological risk.\nThe majority of research to date has focused on each system separately, despite evidence\nthat these multiple physiological systems interact with each other [11] and alter the cumulative\nwhole. A multisystem approach is grounded in evidence that the multiple routes are likely to\ncontribute to disease, which together acts as a powerful epidemiological predictor of morbidity\nand mortality outcomes [16,17,58\u00ad61]. To date, two studies have evaluated sleep in relations to\nmultisystem risk using eight to nine biomarker to capture allostatic load, and report that short\nsleep [62,63], particularly with poor sleep quality [63], and insomnia symptoms [62] related to\nelevated allostatic load. These studies included biomarkers of the cardiovascular, metabolic,\nand immune systems, but did not assess sympathovagal or neuroendocrine parameters. The\npresent analysis are the first to consider the cumulative effects across seven biological regulato-\nry systems, and similar to these previous reports, we approach the analyses using a\nmultisystem perspective.\nConsistent with existing evidence linking short sleep duration with elevated risk within indi-\nvidual systems, we hypothesized that individuals with short sleep duration would have greater\nmultisystem biological risk scores, indicative of higher allostatic load independent of chronic\nhealth conditions. In addition, we examine the association between long sleep and multisystem\nbiological risk. Whereas long sleep is associated with increased health risks, it has been sug-\ngested that this relationship reflects underlying problems in health and/or sleep quality that in-\ncreases demands for sleep for a longer period of time, as opposed to long sleep alone leading to\nhealth declines [5,6,8]. Hence, we further hypothesize that the associations between long sleep\nand elevated multisystem biological risk scores would be present in the long sleepers with poor\nsleep quality but not with normal sleep quality. In addition, since sleep quality and depression\nhave both independent and overlapping effects on risk [64], we examine the effects after further\nadjustment for depression. We test these hypotheses in a large community sample of midlife\nadults from the United States of America.\nMethods\nParticipants\nAs was previously reported [65\u00ad68], the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS)\nsurvey was conducted in 1995 to 1996 and consisted of a random-digit telephone dialing of po-\ntential respondents aged 25\u00ad74 years across the 48 contiguous states, including an over-sam-\npling of twin pairs and siblings. In 2004 to 2006, a follow up was completed (MIDUS II), with\n75% of MIDUS I participating. The present set of analyses includes a subset of MIDUS II par-\nticipants who agreed to be in the Biomarkers substudy [68]. A total of 1255 participants came\nfor an overnight stay at a general clinical research center (GCRC) housed at the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles, Georgetown University, and the University of Wisconsin, Madison.\nSleep and Disease Risk\nInstitutional review board monitoring and approval was obtained from the University of Cali-\nfornia Los Angeles Institutional Review Board, Georgetown University Institutional Review\nBoard, and the University of Wisconsin Health Sciences Institutional Review Board. All partici-\npants provided written informed consent. A detailed comparison of participants in the Bio-\nmarker substudy with the main sample respondents can be found elsewhere [68]. The present\nanalyses include 1,023 participants who took part in the Biomarker substudy, reported no regu-\nlar use of medication for sleep, provided biomarkers to compute multisystem biological risk\nand completed questionnaire on sleep, depression, self-evaluated health, and other psychoso-\ncial, behavioral, and health questionnaires.\nProcedures\nDemographic information was obtained during an initial telephone interview. After arrival at\nthe GCRC, participants completed a medical history, health and behavior questionnaires, and\nunderwent a physical examination. Fasting morning blood was collected after a night of sleep\nfor the measurement of blood derived biomarkers. A 12-hour overnight protocol for the collec-\ntion of urine was followed from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM. Resting heart-rate variability was ob-\ntained the morning following breakfast. All collection was done following standardized\nprotocols across sites [68].\nMeasures\nSleep duration. Average night time sleep duration over the prior month was reported by sub-\njects using a standard question from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [69]. Consis-\ntent with the epidemiological literature examining sleep duration with morbidity and mortality\n[5,6], we categorized sleep duration into four groups: Less than 5 hours, 5 to less than 6.5\nSleep Quality. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index [69] was used to derive a global score of\nsleep quality across seven domains. Scores greater than 5 indicate poor sleep quality and elevat-\ned sleep disturbances [69]. We categorized scores as follows: 5 or less = normal sleep, greater\nthan 5 = poor sleep. Regular use of sleep medication was determined by self-report of using\nmedications 3 or more times per week reported either on the PSQI or during medical\ninterview.\nMultisystem Biological Risk Index (Allostatic Load). A total of 22 biomarkers were mea-\nsured and included in the allostatic load score, representative of 7 different physiological sys-\ntems. This included the cardiovascular system (systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and\nheart rate), lipid metabolic system (triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density\nlipoprotein (LDL), body mass index, and waist-hip ratio), glucose metabolic system (fasting\nblood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and the homeostasis model of assessment of insulin\nresistance (HOMA-IR)), immune system (inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein, Interleu-\nkin(IL)-6, e-Selectin, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and fibrinogen), sympathetic nervous\nsystem (SNS; Urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine), parasympathetic nervous system\n(PNS; heart rate variability: standard deviation of R-R intervals, low frequency (LF) and high\nfrequency (HF) spectral power), and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system (urinary cortisol\nand serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S)). The measurement methods have been\nreported in detail in prior publications [65,67,68]. Multisystem biological risk was computed\nby calculating a 0\u00ad1 risk score within each system, which reflects the proportion of biomarkers\nwithin that system for which the participant's values fall in the highest-risk quartile. The seven\nproportional scores were then summed, with final risk scores ranging from 0\u00ad7. This summa-\ntion allows for equal weighting of each system in the multisystem biological risk computation\nSleep and Disease Risk\nregardless of the number of biomarkers assessed within a system. Cut points for individual bio-\nmarkers can be found in a previous report [67]. In addition, use of medication prescribed to\nlower specific biomarkers of risk was considered an indication of dysregulation within that sys-\ntem (e.g. anti-hypertensive medication indicates increased risk in the cardiovascular system).\nWe scored individuals as being in the high risk quartile of that biomarker for which the medi-\ncation is known to target. This included medications for lowering blood pressure, heart rate,\nglucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. We also performed sensitivity analyses using a risk score\nthat did not include medication in the computation. The individual system score was comput-\ned if participants had half or more of the biomarkers for that system. A total of 116 participants\nhad only one missing system scores (91 missing PNS scores; 25 missing one of the other system\nscores). Data were missing at random for all the systems except parasympathetic. For the para-\nsympathetic, missingness was more common in older adults and was due to instrumentation\nproblems that led to poor quality data signals. For 91 patients who were missing only the para-\nsympathetic system score, we used single mean conditional imputation that replaces missing\nvalues with predicted values from a regression equation generated with non-missing data [70].\nThis equation estimates missing risk scores using participants' scores on the other six systems,\nage, gender, and race/ethnicity as predictors. The others missing system scores values were im-\nputed with the modal value, which was zero. Individuals had to have 6 of the 7 system scores to\nhave a risk score computed. Bivariate associations of subscale scores of the multisystem biologi-\ncal risk index are reported in S1 Table.\nAdditional Variables. In addition to the basic demographic factors (age, gender, race), our\nanalyses adjust for indicators of socioeconomic status, including education obtained ( high\nschool, some college, vs.  college) and income/poverty ratio, and BMI. Chronic condition\nscores of 0\u00ad8 indicate the number of reported conditions that might influence sleep (including\nlung condition, cardiovascular disease, history of stroke, history of cancer, joint or bone ail-\nments, gastrointestinal distress, thyroid diseases, and/or neurological disorder). Vitality was as-\nsessed by a three item scale asking participants to rate using a likert scale from 1 to 5: their\nenergy levels compared to five years ago, and rate how much they feel full of life and active.\nScale score ranges from 3 to 15 with higher scores indicating higher vitality. Self-evaluated\nphysical health was assessed with a single question asking participants to rate their physical\nhealth as either poor = 1, fair = 2, good = 3, very good = 4, excellent = 5. As clinical depression\nis associated with an increase in disease risk [71], and may contribute to the sleep and disease\nrelationship [64], the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale [72] scores of\n16 or greater were used to identify probable clinical depression based on established cutoffs\nwith high clinical sensitivity and specificity [73,74].\nStatistical Analyses\nStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistics (v.21). Initial analyses tested for\ndifferences in means or percentage within category in demographics and chronic conditions\nacross the four sleep duration categories, which was performed using ANOVA followed by\npairwise comparisons or chi squared test. Linear associations of covariates with multisystem bi-\nological risk scores were determined with Pearson correlation. Tests for differences in multisys-\ntem biological risk between sleep duration categories and sleep quality categories were\nperformed using a linear mixed effects model that included a random intercept at the family\nlevel (MIDUS includes twins and siblings) to account for within family correlations between\nsiblings and twins in the study sample (sibling/twin pair (n = 107) ICC = .50 indicated a rela-\ntively high within group similarity). Model 1 adjusts for age, gender, race (white vs. non-\nwhite), education, income to poverty ratio, and BMI (to adjust for any residual variance\nSleep and Disease Risk\naccounted for by BMI), and tests for differences between: 1) sleep categories using normal du-\nration (6.5 to <8.5 hours per night) as the reference, and 2) sleep quality groups using normal\nquality sleepers as the reference. In addition to adjusting for Model 1 covariates, Model 2 ad-\njusts for comorbid chronic conditions and self-evaluated physical health. Secondary mixed lin-\near effect models using case selection explore differences in long sleepers with or without poor\nsleep quality and further adjusting for depression, and examine differences by sleep duration\ncategory in the good sleep quality group.\nResults\nDescriptive statistics of the sample, along with statistics by sleep category, can be found in\nTable 1. Differences between sleep categories in demographic factors were present, with a\ngreater percentage of Whites sleeping longer than non-Whites. Average BMI differed by sleep\ncategory with short sleepers having the highest mean BMI. Poor sleep quality was more likely\nto occur in non-Whites and women (p's < .05). Poor sleepers compared to normal sleepers\nhad significantly lower average age, higher BMI, more chronic conditions, poorer self-rated\nhealth, lower vitality, higher depressive symptoms, and lower income to poverty ratio (all\nCorrelation analyses showed that higher multisystem biological risk was significantly associ-\nscores (r = .06, p < .08), and poorer self-evaluated health (r = -.30, p < .001). Lower educational\nattainment was associated with significantly higher multisystem biological risk (p < .001).\nTable 1.

After adjusting for health status, the difference in multisystem\nbiological risk in both short sleepers and long sleepers compared to normal sleepers remained\nFig 1.

We ran sensitively analyses, excluding 31 participants with HIV and neuro-\nlogical conditions and found no difference in the findings.\nSleep Quality and Multisystem Biological Risk\nAs compared to those with normal sleep quality, linear mixed effect analyses adjusting for age,\ngender, race, education, income to poverty ratio, and BMI revealed that participants with poor\nsleep quality had elevated multisystem biological risk scores, B(SE) = .15(.06), p = .01. Results\nwere no longer significant after adjustment for health status, B(SE) = .09 (.06), p = .16.\nPoor Quality Sleep and Sleep Duration\nAll short sleepers reported poor sleep quality, and there were no cases of short sleep and good\nquality sleep. Due to concerns that short sleep duration might contribute to higher PSQI scores,\nwe also computed the PSQI without the sleep duration item. Among the 42 subjects in the\ngroup who were short sleepers with poor sleep quality, only 4 subjects were re-classified when\nthe sleep duration item was no longer considered in determining poor sleep quality. Hence, in\nthe short sleepers who have high PSQI scores, poor sleep quality is not driven by the single\nitem related to sleep duration.\nTo examine whether the elevated multisystem biological risk differed in long sleepers who\nreported either normal or poor sleep quality, we stratified the long sleep duration group (n =\n86) on the basis of sleep quality scores. As compared to long sleepers with normal sleep quality,\nlong sleepers reporting poor sleep quality had significantly elevated multisystem biological risk,\nB(SE) = .93(.3), p = .002 after adjustment for sociodemographic factors, and remained signifi-\ncant after adjustment for health status (B(SE) = .79(.3), p = .009). Fig. 2 displays the adjusted\nmeans within sleep quality group by sleep duration categories. Secondary mixed linear effect\nanalyses selecting only those cases reporting normal quality sleep demonstrated that long sleep\nduration compared to normal sleep duration was not associated with elevated multisystem risk\namong individuals reporting normal quality sleep (B(SE) = .17(.12), p = .14).\nDepression\nAs a secondary inquiry, we examined whether depressive symptoms might explain the elevated\nmultisystem risk observed in short sleepers and among long sleepers with poor sleep quality.\nAs Table 1 shows, 33% of short sleepers were in the high depressive symptoms group. Howev-\ner, further adjustment by depressive symptoms status did not alter the findings showing elevat-\ned multisystem risk in short sleepers (B(SE) = .42(.15), p = .005). Similarly, the percentage of\nsubjects with high depressive symptoms in the long sleepers varied by sleep quality status, with\n37.6% of poor sleep quality subjects reporting high depressive symptoms, while 8.6% of normal\nquality sleepers fell into the high depressive symptoms category (2 = 9.1, p < .005). Difference\nbetween poor sleep quality and normal sleep quality in multisystem biological risk among long\nsleepers remained significant after adjustment by depressive symptoms (B(SE) = .71(.31), p =\nAnalyses examining associations of sleep duration and quality with each individual system\nrisk score included in the multisystem biological risk index are available in the supplemental\nmaterial, S2 Table.\nDiscussion\nThe present set of analyses report significantly elevated multisystem biological risk scores in\nshort sleepers, those reporting sleeping less than 5 hours a night, all of which report poor sleep\nSleep and Disease Risk\nquality. These finding are consistent with reports of elevated mortality risk is short sleepers\nand point to a possible mechanism through which inadequate sleep influences disease risk. The\nfindings linking short sleep with elevated multisystem biological risk was retained after further\nadjustment by health status and depression suggesting that these factors do not account for the\ndifferences observed.\nOur findings showing that inadequate sleep is associated with increased multisystem biolog-\nical risk strengthens the existing research documenting similar associations of short sleep dura-\ntion with a greater likelihood of exhibiting elevated biological risk across several individual\nregulatory systems (e.g., metabolic syndrome, hypertension, glucose regulation, immune, en-\ndocrine, autonomic). Likewise, the results are consistent with previous findings linking short\nsleep and sleep disturbances with allostatic load using measures that capture metabolic, cardio-\nvascular, and immune systems [62,63]. However, the current study is the first to date to exam-\nine the relationship of sleep with multisystem biological risk, including sympathovagal and\nneuroendocrine parameters, and is comprised of 22 biomarkers specifically designed to capture\nallostatic load. These findings have significant clinical value given that over half of these bio-\nmarkers are commonly used individually to designate a unique disease risk (i.e., Hemoglobin\nA1c and diabetes) and are used together to predict morbidity and mortality outcomes [17,59\u00ad\nFig 2. Estimated mean and standard error of multisystem biological risk by sleep duration and quality. Mean and standard error estimates derived\nfrom model after adjustments by age, gender, race, BMI, education, income poverty ratio, chronic conditions, and self-evaluated physical health. Multisystem\nBiological Risk score ranged from 0\u00ad7.\nSleep and Disease Risk\nMultisystem biological risk scores of long sleepers were also elevated compared to normal\nsleepers, but this difference was only in the long sleepers with poor sleep quality, an effect that\nremained after adjustment for depression. It was hypothesized that one possibility for elevated\nmultisystem biological risk (and increased risk of mortality) in long sleepers is that individuals\nwho sleep for longer periods than normal often have poorer sleep quality. Our result suggest\nthat poor sleep quality in long sleepers contributes to elevated multisystem biological risk. This\nfinding supports the hypothesis that too much sleep is associated with elevated risk because it\nmay in fact serve as a proxy indicator of sleep fragmentation where individuals do not actually\nobtain the amount of sleep needed, which in turn increases the drive to sleep longer [8]. Under\nthis hypothesis, sleep fragmentation could contribute to increased demands of the regulatory\nsystems to maintain allostasis [14]. Since we were unable to directly test sleep apnea in the pres-\nent analyses, it remains possible that our sample of long sleepers with poor sleep quality may\ninclude individuals with sleep apnea, and future research should consider this possibility.\nOf particular note to medical professionals, these findings highlight the importance of sleep\nduration and the role of sleep quality as potential risk factors contributing to shifts in biological\nrisk indicators. Similar to physician queries of other behavioral risk factors like smoking, low\nphysical activity, and excess alcohol consumption, queries about sleep amounts and quality\nmay be relevant [75].\nMechanisms\nA remaining question is why short sleep and poor sleep quality in long sleepers might impact\nthese regulatory systems and how this might influence risk for disease. Sleep serves an impor-\ntant evolutionary function; it give the body time to rest and repair damage [75,76]. In the case\nof short sleep and sleep fragmentation, inadequate and disturbed sleep places demands on mul-\ntiple regulatory systems throughout the body by reducing the available time for restoration and\nincreasing the demand on physiological resources necessary to maintain stability (i.e., allosta-\nsis) [14]. Over time the accumulation of demands without appropriate restoration causes wear\nand tear, evidenced by allostatic load [15,16]. Thus prolonged periods of inadequate sleep likely\ncontribute to gradual shifts in regulatory set points such as resting blood pressure, cholesterol,\nblood sugar, and inflammatory activity, which are themselves known to be involved in the\nLimitations and Strengths\nOur findings are cross-sectional and thus do not show causation. Future work should focus on\napplying longitudinal and experimental designs to assess causality. Similarly, treatment trials\nto improve sleep in short sleepers and long sleepers with poor sleep quality are needed to exam-\nine whether multisystem biological risk improves along with remission of sleep problems. As\npreviously stated, using self-reported sleep is limited and more objective measures of sleep con-\ntinuity, along with a careful assessment for sleep apnea, would greatly improve our understand-\ning of the links between short and long sleep with multisystem biological risk. There are\nnumerous strengths to the current study including a large heterogeneous sample of adults in\nthe US increasing the generalizability of the findings, and a comprehensive 22 biomarker mea-\nsure of multisystem biological risk with established predictive validity for morbidity and mor-\ntality outcomes. In addition, the MIDUS study includes a detailed assessment of health,\nincluding an extensive assessment of self-reported chronic conditions, which allows us to con-\ntrol for the possible confound of health when examining relationships of sleep with biological\nrisk. Likewise, the inclusion of a well validated and reliable measure of depressive symptoms\n(the CESD) [72,73] adds to the strength of the current analyses revealing that further statistical\nSleep and Disease Risk\nadjustments for depression does not account for the differences in multisystem biological risk\namong short sleepers and long sleepers with poor sleep quality.\nConclusions\nIn sum, we report in a large community based sample of adults living in the Unites States of\nAmerica that similar to findings linking sleep duration with mortality risk, short sleepers and\nlong sleepers with poor sleep quality had elevated biomarkers of risk indicative of multisystem\ndysregulation. This finding was independent of sociodemographics, chronic health conditions,\nself-evaluated health, and depression. The association of long sleepers with elevated multisys-\ntem biological risk was only present in those reporting poor sleep quality, suggesting that self-\nreported long sleep may be related to disease partially because it captures poor sleepers. Poor\nand inadequate sleep may contribute to dysregulation in physiological set points across numer-\nous regulatory systems, represented as allostatic load. These findings suggest that acquiring ad-\nequate amounts of good quality sleep (at least greater than 5 hours) is associated with less\nmultisystem biological risk, and may therefore also be a means to lower risk for morbidity and\nmortality. Individuals who report global poor sleep quality (>5 on PSQI), either with long\nsleep or short sleep, are also experiencing some insomnia symptoms. Meta-analytic evidence\nsuggests that both insomnia symptoms and global sleep quality are improved with behavioral\ninterventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, CBT-I) [61], suggesting that\nsuch treatments may also be useful in improving sleep quality even among those who do not\nmeet full criterion for insomnia disorder. Future research should examine the treatment effica-\ncy of CBT-I and possibly other behavioral interventions for subsyndromal insomnia as indicat-\ned by high global PSQI scores with short or long sleep duration. In the case of long sleep,\ncurrent interventions are underway to target sleep restriction in long sleepers as a means to im-\nprove health, which may act by resetting diurnal rhythms [80]. The present findings point to\nthe importance of evaluating sleep amounts and quality during assessment of lifestyle factors\nassociated with cardiovascular and other disease risk.\nSupporting Information\nS1 Table.
