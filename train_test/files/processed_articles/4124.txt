Many stakeholders have\nset goals around the proportion of health care payments that\nshould be \"value-based\" in the near future.1-3 Nearly all types\nof value-based payment programs--including capitation,\nbundling, shared savings, pay-for-performance, and so on--\nencourage greater collaboration among providers than gener-\nally exists today.At the same time, physicians are increasingly\nchoosing employment in larger, more organized settings, as\nopposed to solo or small-group practices. This is due in part\nto hospitals purchasing physician practices,4 and in part to\nphysicians choosing the stability and work-life balance that\nlarger employers can provide.5-7\nIf these trends continue, health care organizations will\nincreasingly resemble integrated delivery systems, defined\nas \"network[s] of organizations that provide . . . a coordi-\nnated continuum of services to a defined population and [that\nare] willing to be held clinically and fiscally accountable\nfor the outcomes and the health status of the population\nserved\"8 (see also Suter et al9 for a more detailed definition\nof the properties of integrated care and Valentijn et al10 for a\nproposed taxonomy of levels of integration). Such a shift\nwill likely pose new demands for physicians and for organi-\nzations that educate, certify, employ, or partner with them.11\nWe can learn from existing integrated delivery systems--\nsuch as Kaiser Permanente, the Mayo Clinic Health System,\nand Geisinger Health System--about how physicians adapt\nto working in these settings. In this study, we asked physi-\ncians about their transitions from a less integrated to a more\nintegrated setting. Physicians' accounts of such transitions\nmay reveal specific skills or attitudes they need to be effec-\ntive and satisfied in the latter environment. This is potentially\nimportant for several reasons. First, studies of change\nmanagement in health care often identify physician buy-in as\n1American Board of Internal Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA\n2Tollen Health Policy Consulting, Larkspur, CA, USA\n3Kaiser Permanente Institute for Health Policy, Oakland, CA, USA\n4Southern California Permanente Medical Group, Pasadena, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLaura Tollen, Tollen Health Policy Consulting, 33 Creek View Circle,\nEmail: laura.tollen@comcast.net\na key factor in determining whether organizational initiatives\nsucceed.12-14 Second, many studies have described physi-\ncians' dysfunctional relationships with their care settings,\nincluding accounts of systemic distrust between physicians,\nadministrators, and other providers15,16; physician burnout17;\nphysicians' perceptions that they must be hypervigilant to\nprotect patients against unsafe hospital conditions18,19; and\nthe \"hidden curriculum\" embedded in physician education\nthat teaches them to distrust their care systems.20,21\nCurrently, we have limited understanding of how physicians\nfare when they transition into more integrated delivery settings.\nStudies have focused on physicians' attitudes about specific\naspects of practice, such as care management processes, com-\npensation, workload, use of electronic medical records, or per-\nformance measurement.22-26 Studies of differences across\npractice settings tend to focus on comparing employed versus\nindependent physicians27,28 or looking broadly at physicians'\nexperiences working in managed care.29,30\nExperts have opined about how to support the movement\ntoward integrated care,31,32 but the field lacks a nuanced view\nof the day-to-day challenges and opportunities physicians\nface as their practice environments change. Leaders of inte-\ngrated delivery systems commonly observe that the culture\nof these systems is simply different from other environments,\nwith some referring to a culture of \"group accountability\"33\nor of \"continuous improvement.\"34 To our knowledge, how-\never, no study has identified front-line physicians who have\nworked in integrated and non-integrated settings and asked\nthem to articulate what those differences are.\nStudy Data and Methods\nWe conducted a qualitative descriptive study of how physi-\ncians experience the transition to working in an integrated,\nwith 30 physicians who came to work at one particular inte-\ngrated delivery system--Kaiser Permanente--after having\ntrained and practiced in other settings. Kaiser Permanente,\nheadquartered in Oakland, California, is the nation's largest\nnot-for-profit, integrated delivery system, with 11.3 million\nDistrict of Columbia.36 Kaiser Permanente is a mutually\nexclusive partnership and contractual alliance between a not-\nfor-profit insurer, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan; a not-\nfor-profit hospital system, Kaiser Foundation Hospitals; and\n8 physician professional organizations, the Permanente\nMedical Groups.37 In each of Kaiser Permanente's geo-\ngraphic regions, the Health Plan offers coverage, and the\nassociated Medical Group provides professional services for\na negotiated per-member fee. Individual physicians are paid\nby salary with modest performance incentives.37 The focus\nof our study is the Southern California Permanente Medical\nGroup (SCPMG). Together with their health plan and hospi-\nmillion patients across Southern California.\nAn interdisciplinary research team with expertise in cul-\ntural anthropology and health policy conducted a total of\nfour 90-minute focus groups, each at a different site within\nthe Kaiser Permanente Southern California region. Two\ngroups had 6 physician participants each; 2 had 9 partici-\npants each. Participating physicians had 3 to 13 years of\nexperience with SCPMG and came to the group after having\npreviously practiced outside of Kaiser Permanente for at\nleast 1 year. Most came from non-integrated care settings.\nThe sessions focused on the differences physicians\nobserved between SCPMG and their previous workplaces\nand were designed to elicit answers to 2 primary questions:\nWhat new skills, behaviors, and attitudes (if any) did physi-\ncians have to develop in this new context, and how should\ntraining and certification organizations prepare and support\nphysicians to thrive in this type of setting? (See the appendix\nfor the full interview guide.) All 4 groups also addressed\nspontaneously 2 additional questions, without prompts from\nthe researchers: What organizational features of the system\nitself enabled physicians to practice successfully in this envi-\nronment, and what were the tradeoffs inherent in those orga-\nnizational features?\nWe chose 3 years as the minimum tenure because that is\nthe point at which physicians become full partners in the\npractice, indicating (to us) that participants had made an\naffirmative decision to remain at SCPMG, at least for the\nnear future. Across the groups, participants appeared diverse\nin terms of age, race/ethnicity, and gender (11 women, 19\nmen). There were 16 primary care physicians and 14 special-\nists. Nineteen participants had spent between 3 and 6 years at\nSCPMG, and 11 had spent between 7 and 13 years there.\nUsing human resource records, we identified all physi-\ncians associated with each site who met the study criteria and\nemailed them an invitation to participate. We also placed a\nrecruitment announcement in a weekly SCPMG electronic\nnewsletter. We offered participants an honorarium of $250.\nThe same 2 members of our research team (BC and LT),\nneither of whom is a Kaiser Permanente employee, moder-\nated all 4 focus groups. The moderators asked all questions\nin the interview guide of all participants, in every group, fol-\nlowing the natural flow of conversation to ask questions in\ncombination or in different sequence, where appropriate. We\ntook detailed notes during the sessions and transcribed audio\nrecordings.\nA larger team of 4 (BC, LT, JL, SD) analyzed all notes and\ntranscripts using the constant comparative method,35 begin-\nning with a set of a priori codes based on the interview ques-\ntions and constructs, and then identifying new codes and\nthemes in an inductive manner as they emerged through\nreading and comparison. We used Excel to organize and code\nall data. Our conceptual framework for analyzing the data\nwas one of iterative, reflexive sifting for meaning making.38\nWe searched the data both for the answers to our pre-existing\nquestions and for the new questions and ideas present in our\nparticipants' narratives, with a particular focus on how our\nChesluk et al 3\nparticipants themselves interpreted the experiences they\ndescribed. Finally, we compared team members' individual\nanalyses with each other and with the original interview data,\nin an iterative manner, to refine and verify codes and themes.\nAll focus group participants gave written informed con-\nsent. The SCPMG Institutional Review Board approved the\nResults\nWe divide the results into 4 categories. The first 2 are related\nto questions we asked the participants explicitly: What new\nskills, behaviors, and attitudes did physicians need to develop\nin the new context, and how should training and certification\norganizations prepare and support them to thrive in this envi-\nronment? The second 2 categories of results are related to\nissues that all 4 focus groups brought out spontaneously:\nWhat organizational features enable physicians to practice\nsuccessfully in this environment, and what are some trad-\neoffs inherent in those organizational features?\nNew Physician Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities\nPhysicians identified 3 primary areas of knowledge, skills,\nand abilities they needed to acquire when they transitioned to\nthis medical group: orienting to the team and system, engag-\ning patients as individuals and as a panel (ie, as a group under\nthe care of a single clinician or team), and integrating cost\nawareness into practice.\nOrienting to team and system. Nearly all physicians described\nthe need to be oriented to the larger team and the system in\nways that were different from their experiences in other work\nsettings. For example, physicians said they needed to work\nwith support staff over whom they could not assert direct\nauthority. Several were initially dismayed about this. As one\nphysician said, \"On day one . . . I went to ask a medical assis-\ntant something and they said to me, `Oh, ask so-and-so\nbecause I'm on lunch.' And the concept of . . . `lunch' and\n`breaks' was astounding to me\" (Group 1, Participant 5).\nPhysicians also described the need to accept input from\nadministrators--input that had been absent or easy to dis-\nmiss in other settings. One said, \"Before, I didn't have a\nboss. If [hospital administrators] tried to be too controlling,\nwe'd take our business elsewhere. Here, the administration\nsets goals. They're not outrageous goals though\" (Group 4,\nParticipant 2).\nFinally, physicians talked about needing to focus on orga-\nnizational goals and practice guidelines, even if their value\nwas not immediately apparent. As one said (and many others\nseconded),\nThere's a thing known as \"KP medicine,\" which is value-driven.\nIt's got some constraints. [You ask,] \"Who are they to tell me\nhow to practice?\" But over time, you get used to it and buy into\nit. . . . At first, you don't understand the limits, because they're\ndifferent from what you [experienced] with outside insurance\ncompanies. You learn the evidence base behind it, and it's\ncohesive. (Group 2, Participant 4)\nPhysicians also said they needed to accept limits on their\nautonomy, acknowledging they were part of a larger organi-\nzation that holds collective responsibility for patients.\nHowever, they did not characterize this as an abrogation of\nindividual \"ownership\" of their panel; rather, they needed to\nrecognize that they were not the only ones responsible for\ntheir patients. One said,\nThis isn't really your patient. This is Kaiser's patient. And we've\ngot to make sure that we're doing everything efficiently and\ncorrectly. . . . Whereas, you know, in the private world [it's],\n\"I'm the doctor. I admitted the patient. I'm giving the hospital\nbusiness. And I'm taking care of the patient the best I know\nhow.\" (Group 1, Participant 6)\nThey observed that this might not be equally easy for all\nphysicians. As one said, \"If the [physician] . . . has to be in\ncharge of everything, and the only way things happen is their\nway, they don't belong in a system like this\" (Group 2,\nParticipant 6). Another simply said, \"If you want to be a\n`cowboy,'this is not the place to be\" (Group 2, Participant 2).\nEngaging patients as individuals and as a panel.Physicians\ndescribed several ways in which they had learned to work\ndifferently with patients. First, they paid closer attention to\ntheir patients' experiences of care. Many health systems rou-\ntinely survey patients; what was notable in this medical\ngroup was physicians' perception that they would be held\naccountable for their patients' experiences.\nSecond, they had to view their relationship with patients\nin the context of organizational goals, such as preventive\ncare targets for an entire patient panel. One primary care\nphysician recounted,\nWhen I first started working here, I was amazed at the proactive\nnature of the \"care gaps.\" I would see a patient with a 103\n[degree] fever, but I would still do a diabetic foot exam because\nit was due. Sometimes it's uncomfortable, but sometimes it\nseems appropriate. (Group 2, Participant 1)\nOn the same topic, several talked about new panel-\nmanagement skills and tasks they had to master. The same\nphysician quoted above said, \"You have to manage a panel.\nIt means phone calls to them. It means letters. It means . . .\nencouraging them to go for all their routine health mainte-\nnance things\" (Group 2, Participant 1).\nIntegrating cost awareness into practice. Many discussed need-\ning to understand the costs associated with the care their\npatients receive. They said costs had been ignored in medical\nschool and residency, and if they had learned about this issue\nin previous work settings, it was with an emphasis on maxi-\nmizing volume and billing, rather than value. In this system,\nthey said, they needed to be aware of their patients' costs for\ntreatments they prescribed, so that they could know when,\nfor example, a patient would need to spend a significant\namount over what insurance would cover.\nPhysicians also said they needed to understand the cost of\ncare to the larger organization, so that they could act respon-\nsibly as stewards of the system's resources. As one said,\n\"When you work in a system like this, all of a sudden [cost]\nbecomes very important. Looking at it more from the sys-\ntem's point of view . . . it's also important to you to know that\nwe're not paying for procedures that are not necessary or\nbeing duplicated or whatever\" (Group 1, Participant 1).\nChanges to Medical Education\nWe asked what medical schools and residency programs\nshould do differently (if anything) to prepare physicians for\nintegrated care. Participants' answers reemphasized the\nabove findings--system orientation, patient engagement,\npanel management, and especially what they glossed as\n\"business fundamentals,\" including integrating cost con-\nsciousness into practice. One observed, \"What medical\nschools need to incorporate is more of a systems approach. .\n. . How [do] you work as one part of a team where, as the\nphysician, you may not be the captain of the ship?\" (Group 1,\nParticipant 3). Regarding panel management, another com-\nmented, \"Traditional [physician] education is based on treat-\ning patient[s'] symptoms, and they get better or they don't.\n[Here], you're responsible for a panel of patients, whether\nthey come to see you or not. You are still responsible for\nthem\" (Group 2, Participant 1).\nPhysicians identified 2 reasons why these programs\nshould focus on \"business fundamentals.\" First, knowledge\nabout costs can help physicians understand and support an\norganization's business decisions. One said, \"Understanding\nthe business aspects gives me more understanding and own-\nership of [the organization's] policies and financial deci-\nsions\" (Group 3, Participant 8). Second, learning about the\nbusiness of medicine could make trainees aware of the dif-\nferent types of practice settings that exist in the United States,\nallowing them to make an informed choice about where to\nwork. Participants felt they could have benefited from being\naware of the possibility of working in an integrated system\nearlier in their career.\nSystem Features That Support Acquisition of New\nSkills\nAs noted, many participants offered unsolicited descriptions\nof system features that engendered their trust and made them\nwilling (possibly even eager) to acquire the new skills. These\nincluded structures supporting collaboration and learning\namong colleagues, structures supporting evidence-based\nmedicine and panel management, and compensation based on\nsalary and capitation instead of volume and fee-for-service.\nCollaboration and learning.Physicians described working in\nan information-rich environment relative to their previous\nwork settings. The health system's well-developed electronic\nhealth record (EHR) allowed them to access and share infor-\nmation about their patients' histories and interactions with\nother providers. One said, \"I just love how everything's all in\none system. . . . I'm not having to make phone calls to talk to\n[a patient's] outside primary care doc. I just look it up\"\n(Group 4, Participant 4).\nPhysicians enumerated other mechanisms for collabora-\ntion. Rather than being incentivized to refer patients to spe-\ncialists, physicians said they were encouraged to consult\nwith specialists themselves. The system offered several tools\nfor this, including a mechanism embedded in the EHR that\nallows doctors to query specialists in near real-time, tools for\nsharing images with dermatologists via the EHR, and a spe-\ncialized hotline for primary care physicians to speak to an\non-call orthopedist. Physicians said they valued the ready\navailability of specialist advice and noted the contrast with\nwhat they had experienced elsewhere. One primary care phy-\nsician said, \"I . . . got [a response from a specialist] within ten\nminutes one time. By the time I was finished charting, it was\nthere\" (Group 4, Participant 3).\nPhysicians also described receiving meaningful clinical\nfeedback from other physicians and administrators.\nSurprisingly to the research team, they said this feedback felt\nappropriate and helpful, not intrusive, as illustrated by this\nexchange:\nPhysician: When you go to put in the referral [to a spe-\ncialist], a screen will pop up. . . . It'll actually give\nyou some information of common treatments or\ncommon labs to order, or scans, or what the patient\nmight need.\nDiscussion leader: And do you find that helpful?\nPhysician: Oh, yes!. . . . And then, you know, you'll get a\nnote sometimes back in the chart [from the specialist,\nsaying], \"Hey, saw this patient. . . . This is what we did.\n. . .\" So you can reflect on, hey, was there something I\ncould've done a little bit more? . . . And sometimes you\nmight even get a staff message . . . from the specialist\nwho's reviewing your referral [saying] \"Hey, these are\nsome things you can do for the patient right now.\" . . .\n[In other settings], all you'll hear is \"Thank you for the\ninteresting consult.\" (Group 4, Participant 6)\nSupports for evidence-based medicine and panel manage-\nment. Physicians described many ways that the system sup-\nported them in managing patient panels and practicing\nevidence-based medicine (although most did not use the lat-\nter term), including a department that summarizes evidence\nChesluk et al 5\nand develops recommendations for new medications and\ntechnologies. One said,\nHere we have a whole department that just analyzes [new\nlaboratory tests and technologies . . . They] review all the\nliterature, and they have epidemiologists, and PhDs, and MDs. .\n. . It's a great resource. (Group 1, Participant 3)\nPhysicians also said they appreciated the numerous goal-\ntracking and panel-management tools in the EHR to help\nthem know whether they are meeting care goals for individ-\nual patients and for their panels.\nSalary and capitation.Physicians described benefits of\nworking in a system of capitated payments and salaried\nphysicians: primarily, that the system's financial incen-\ntives were aligned with providing effective care, not max-\nimizing volume of services. One said, \"The common goal\nis `take good care of the patient.' Financial motivation is\nout of the picture\" (Group 4, Participant 7). Another said,\n\"Previously . . . I was encouraged to see as many [patients]\nor code as highly as I possibly could, to make money for\nthe group. [H]ere, we're actually encouraged to give qual-\nity care\" (Group 4, Participant 4). They said this enhanced\ntheir sense of providing the best care possible to their\npatients.\nTradeoffs\nAt the same time, physicians described tradeoffs inherent in\nall these system features. For example, the focus on preven-\ntion and population-based care largely aligned with physi-\ncians'own goals, but it could also sometimes feel intrusive in\nits requirements to \"push\" certain care. One noted,\nThere's no way to put [on a patient's chart] \"forget about the\nmammogram and leave her alone about the pap smear.\" Even if\nyou were to write it in: \"doesn't want [a mammogram],\" it\ndoesn't matter because they're still going to be caught in the\ncomputer data mining that [says], \"this person hasn't had a\nmammogram.\" (Group 2, Participant 1)\nThe large size of the organization and some of its bureau-\ncratic features, including reliance on unionized workforces,\nprovided a sense of stability and freed physicians from has-\nsles such as hiring and payroll. However, they acknowledged\nthat change can feel slow in such a large organization. One\nsaid, \"The responsiveness to change is significantly slower\nhere. . . . There are multiple layers and multiple levels that\nhave to check off on change here. For better or for worse, [in]\nsmaller groups, you would get a new idea and you'd just do\nit\" (Group 3, Participant 8).\nRegarding financial incentives, participants agreed that\nphysician salary and group capitation greatly encouraged a\nfocus on patients' needs and the \"right\" amount of care.\nHowever, several noted that salary might lead some col-\nleagues to be slow to respond to referrals.\nParticipants largely regarded these tradeoffs as \"worth\nit,\" with the downsides often described with humor, as\nsomething to tolerate as part of a bigger, more positive\npicture. For the research team, the fact that physicians\nacknowledged these inherent tradeoffs reinforced the\nimpression that they trust their system and believe its inter-\nests align with their own.\nDiscussion\nSystems That Earn Physicians' Trust\nBecause our primary focus was on physicians' knowledge,\nskills, and abilities, we expected to hear about issues such as\nlearning new approaches to collaboration and panel manage-\nment, or learning to accommodate system-set rules or guid-\nance. We did not expect to gather data on how the system had\nearned physicians' trust, making them amenable to develop-\ning these new competencies. This trust in the system contrasts\nwith what we have seen in the literature and in our previous\nwork in non-integrated settings, where physicians often view\nthe \"system\" as something they must work around to provide\ngood patient care and where attempts to influence what physi-\ncians do are rare and unwelcome when they occur.18 Our par-\nticipants described ways the system supported them to\nprovide a different, better kind of care. This was not some-\nthing most had consciously sought when coming to SCPMG.\nRather, most said they had come to this group for reasons\nother than care quality--primarily, for work-life balance and\nfinancial stability. But having sought personal balance and\nstability, they discovered a system that resonated with their\nown values and priorities for patient care.\nFor some, this experience effected a change in those val-\nues and priorities. The new work setting demanded different\nskills and attitudes than had been required elsewhere, and\nputting those into practice in the context of an integrated sys-\ntem redefined their perspective on what being a physician\nentailed. They were able to accomplish things with their\nteams and for their patients that would not have been possi-\nble, or even conceivable, in other settings. A good example\nof this is the dynamic one physician described in which he\nappreciated receiving feedback from a specialist about his\nreferral decision because it would help him make the most\nappropriate referrals in the future.\nParticipants' new perspectives on the nature of the physi-\ncian's job may be particularly relevant to nascentAccountable\nCare Organizations (ACOs), and they appear to lend cre-\ndence to common strategies ACOs have used to affect physi-\ncian behavior. In particular, Phipps-Taylor and Shortell\nrecently found that the most common change motivators\nACOs used with their physicians were opportunities to have\na greater impact on patients and to be a more effective\nThe experience of transitioning to work in this integrated\nsystem carried with it a change in what anthropological the-\nory terms worldview and ethos--in how physicians envision\nthe world and what good conduct in that world should\nentail.40 This cultural reframing seems to arise from the\ngestalt of the system features described above, which align\nclosely with the criteria for integrated care proposed by\nShortell and Gillies,8 Suter et al,9 or Valentijn et al.10 The\nsystem features mentioned by group participants function\nnot just to support care providers but to enable this new cul-\ntural framework as well.\nThis is underscored by our participants' references to the\nimportance of physicians' acceptance of teamwork and lim-\nits on traditionally defined professional autonomy. Seen\nfrom the perspective taught implicitly and explicitly to phy-\nsicians in training,20,21 limits on autonomy would normally\nbe framed in terms of loss--privileges and affordances made\nunavailable by the constraints of this integrated care system.\nBut unfettered autonomy can also be understood as an aspect\nof physician practice and culture best left behind, a symptom\nof deficient systems--a bug, not a feature.\nThat said, in analyzing data such as these, we must avoid\nidealizing integrated systems. As discussed below (see the\nRemaining Questions section), surely there are some physi-\ncians who have chosen to exit this system or others like it;\nunderstanding their reasons for doing so could prove illumi-\nnating. In addition, research on physicians in integrated sys-\ntems has described their need to negotiate unhelpful\ninformation technology and bureaucracy, just like physicians\nin other settings.41 Still, our participants' accounts of what\nthey had to accustom themselves to in this new setting paint\na telling portrait that differs sharply from the default nature\nof health care practices they had experienced previously:\nreactive, information poor, uncoordinated, and when it\ncomes to cost and efficiency, haphazard at best and driven by\ncounterproductive incentives at worst.\nImplications for Training and Standard Setting\nOur study has implications for medical schools and for\nfunders of Graduate Medical Education. Consistent with pre-\nvious research,42 physicians said their education had ignored\ntopics such as system orientation, patient engagement, panel\nmanagement, and business fundamentals. We do not suggest\nthat these should be layered on top of existing curricula--\nthis would merely add to the already-great volume of infor-\nmation that medical trainees must absorb. Rather, to the\nextent possible, physician training should incorporate these\nconcepts organically, so that they are seen as fundamental to\ndelivering care, as in the movement to include cost aware-\nOur findings also have implications for organizations\nthat set standards for physicians and support their ongoing\nprofessional development. Medical specialty societies and\nother providers of continuing medical education should\nconsider how they might emphasize several specific skills\nand attributes. The first is system-based practice, including\nthe ability to work within limits and toward goals set by the\nlarger organization. The second is inter-professional team-\nwork, encompassing collaboration with both face-to-face\nand virtual teams. The third is patient centeredness, mean-\ning understanding and facilitating patients' pathways\nthrough the care system, as well as understanding what care\ncosts patients. Specialty societies and certification and\nlicensing boards might wish to consider developing stan-\ndards to assure that physicians have achieved and maintain\ncompetency in these areas.\nRemaining Questions\nWe found an unusually high degree of trust among these phy-\nsicians that their system is designed to help them practice\ngood medicine. This trust seemed rooted in physicians'sense\nthat the organization's goals aligned with their own goals for\npatient care. While we cannot comment on causation, we do\nknow that this medical group's leadership expends signifi-\ncant effort to ensure physicians understand and buy into\norganizational goals. One way they promote this is through a\nmulti-day program for new hires that focuses on what the\norganization expects from physicians and what they can\nexpect in return. Program leaders report they intend to lay the\ngroundwork for physicians to develop the trust in the system\nour participants described.\nAnother feature of this medical group that may contrib-\nute to the level of trust we observed is its representative\ngovernance. Each partner may vote for a member of the\nBoard of Directors from his or her geographic area. Board\ncandidates are self-nominated and must win the support of\ntheir colleagues.\nThis group's unique payment structures (group-level cap-\nitation and individual physician salary) may also have con-\ntributed to the trust we observed. As noted, several\nparticipants mentioned that the system's financial incentives\nwere aligned with their own preferences for doing what is\nbest for the patient, rather than simply maximizing the vol-\nume of services. Some experts argue that ACOs and similar\nentities will inevitably fail if they do not take bolder steps\ntoward capitation.45\nThe role played by this system's unique features--includ-\ning onboarding programs, representative governance, and\ncapitation/salary--merits further study. It will also be impor-\ntant to explore whether physicians in other established inte-\ngrated delivery systems express similar views, as well as\nwhether the observed level of physician trust in this system\nis evident in other, similar systems.\nFurther research could also compare our findings with\nthose from a group of SCPMG physicians with no previous\nexperience outside of the system. Is this group's apparent level\nof satisfaction related to our participants' having worked in\nother settings that they chose to leave? Would we see similar\nresults with physicians who started practicing in a highly inte-\ngrated setting straight out of residency? Answers to these\nChesluk et al 7\nquestions could have implications for the hiring of physicians\nby nascent integrated delivery systems. In addition, research\nwith physicians who have left, or were asked to leave, Kaiser\nPermanente or integrated systems to work in another type of\nsetting could illuminate other aspects of physicians' experi-\nences in these settings and what leads physicians to feel such a\nsetting is \"right\" for them as a professional.\nFinally, further research could explore the perspectives on\nsimilar questions held by non-physician providers, manag-\ners, administrators, and patients.\nLimitations\nThis study includes only a limited number of physicians from\na specific region of a single, and very unique, health system.\nHypotheses about how our findings could apply more broadly\nare therefore speculative. We sought to mitigate this limitation\nby focusing on topics that are relevant for every integrated\npractice setting (eg, supports for evidence-based medicine),\nrather than specific to this particular system (eg, full vertical\nintegration among physicians, hospitals and health plan, or\nhaving a 70-year history of organizational stability).\nFocus groups have inherent limitations: We gathered\nqualitative data from a limited number of participants, cover-\ning topics they felt comfortable broaching in a semi-public\nsetting. Our data consist of these particular physicians'recol-\nlections and perceptions of their previous work settings and\ntheir adaptation to their current one; these may not be com-\nprehensive and accurate. We sought to address these limita-\ntions by systematically comparing participants' perceptions\nfor consistency. Research with a broader, representative sam-\nple (eg, a survey) would be a useful supplement to our find-\nings; however, such a survey was beyond the scope of the\nproject. Furthermore, we sought a more in-depth interaction\nwith participants than would have been possible with a sur-\nvey and chose our methodology accordingly, knowingly giv-\ning up some amount of generalizability for a richer analysis\nof our particular participants' experiences.\nIn addition, the study included only physicians who had\nworked or trained elsewhere, then chose to work at SCPMG,\nremained there for 3 years, became partners, and volunteered\nto participate in our study. Other physicians--for example,\nthose who left SCPMG or were asked to leave before 3 years,\nor who came there straight from residency--may have differ-\nent perspectives, particularly on the system features that are\nneeded to support effective practice in an integrated system.\nFinally, several members of the study team are Kaiser\nPermanente employees, potentially introducing bias.\nHowever, the interview questions were designed to elicit\nneutral perspectives, and the interviews were conducted\nand attended only by team members (including the lead\nresearcher) who are not Kaiser Permanente employees--a\npoint that was made clear to participants. The participant\ninformation sheet also outlined the study's procedures for\nkeeping information confidential from SCPMG leadership.\nConclusion\nAccording to physicians with experience both in and outside\nof an integrated health care delivery system, practicing in an\nintegrated system requires a distinct set of competencies and\nattitudes, including a team orientation, a willingness to\nembrace larger organizational goals, and the ability to partici-\npate in proactively managing a patient panel. In the case of\nSCPMG, these new competencies and attitudes were accom-\npanied by feeling meaningfully supported by a trusted net-\nwork of peers, teammates, and a robust information and\nresource infrastructure. Physicians described how this system\nhad earned their trust and enabled them to practice a different,\nbetter kind of medicine than what had been possible else-\nwhere. This has implications for physicians who practice in\nintegrated delivery systems, for organizations that train and\ncertify physicians and other providers, and for delivery sys-\ntems striving to provide more accountable, integrated care.\nAppendix\nSCPMG Focus Group Script\nHello and thanks for attending this evening. My name is Ben\nChesluk. We're here together to learn about your experience\nof coming to work in an integrated health system like Kaiser\nPermanente.\nYou are here because you are all physicians who came to\nwork at Kaiser Permanente after earlier work experience and\ntraining in other organizations. We'd like to learn about your\nexperience of that transition, to hear your perspectives on\nwhat you find similar or different about working in an inte-\ngrated health system compared to other settings where\nyou've worked.\n(highlight that researchers aren't from KP)\nWe want to emphasize that when we ask whether your expe-\nrience was \"different,\" we are not assuming that either kind\nof workplace is better than the other.\n(highlight that by \"different\" we mean good, bad, mixed--\nnot just \"better\")\nI am not sure if you have ever participated in a focus group\nbefore, but it is something between an interview and a dinner\nparty conversation. I have a list of questions and topics that\nwe'll discuss as a group. We'll be talking for about 90 min-\nutes and I will be jotting down some notes during our\nconversation.\nHere are some basic ground rules:\nWe would like everyone to participate. I may call on you if I\nhaven't heard from you in a while.\nEvery person's experiences and opinions are important.\nSpeak up whether you agree or disagree with what others are\nsaying, if your experiences are similar or different from oth-\ners'. We want to hear a wide range of perspectives.\nWe want everyone to feel comfortable. Please feel free to\nspeak your mind. Nothing you have to say about your experi-\nence, good, bad or mixed, will affect your status with\nSCPMG, with ABIM, or with anyone else. If we ever publish\nor present anything about what we learn from these groups,\nwe'll make sure nobody can identify you.\nThis facility is set up to record audio. We will use these\nrecordings to check our notes afterwards, in case there's any-\nthing we've missed. But we will protect your confidential-\nity--as I mentioned if we ever publish or present anything\nfrom these groups we will keep you anonymous.\nDo you have any questions before we begin?\n1. Introductions--name, specialty, and where did you\nwork before KP?\n 2. How did you come to work at KP?\na. Probes: did they seek out KP, were they recruited,\nactively sought to leave previous job, had to find\nnew work due to a move, etc.\nb. Probe: if they actively sought out working at KP,\nwhy?\nc. Probe: if they were recruited, what info in the\nrecruiting process made KP seem appealing?\n 3. Was there anything you had to learn to do differently to\npractice as a physician--anything that made working as\na physician at this kind of organization different than\nwhere you worked previously? If so, what? [participants\nwill be asked to write down top 3 differences before dis-\ncussing, and go in turn to read their notes to the team]\na. Probes: think about difference in both clinical\npractices and in the structure or culture of the\norganization.\nb. Possible probes: was there anything that made\nthe \"job description\" for physicians fundamen-\ntally different?\nc. Probes: was there anything specific that seemed\nchallenging/easier? If so, what?\n 4. Was there anything different in terms of an emphasis\non abilities or clinical skills/areas of expertise you\nmay have already had, but that were not a focus of\nyour previous employment setting?\n 5. Was there anything different about working with the\nother providers you need to coordinate or collabo-\nrate with to care for patients--other physicians,\nnurses, etc?\na. Possible probes: did KP require new teamwork-\ning skills/attitudes? Different habits of working\nwith others? More/less teamwork?\nb. Possible probe: anything different about the\ninteraction between PCPs and specialists?\n 6. Was there anything different about dealing with\npatients?\na. Possible probes: different relationship with\npatients; providing different kinds of care; differ-\nent modes of communication (phone, email, etc),\nlogistics of scheduling and referrals; patients had\ndifferent/similar expectations/knowledge, differ-\nent kinds of questions?\n 7. Was there anything different about dealing with hos-\npital or practice administration?\na. Possible probes: more/less direct interaction\nwith administrators; more/less need to be aware\nof organizational priorities; more/less need to\nfollow organizational rules\n8. Was there anything different about how you stay\nup-to-date on what you need to know to practice\nmedicine?\n 9. Was there anything different about KP compared to\nyour old practice in terms of diversity--of other pro-\nviders? Staff and other workers? Patients?\na. Possible probe: anything different about how\naccommodating patient diversity might have\nimpacted work as a physician?\n10. Was there anything else that struck you as notably\ndifferent about working at this type of organization\nfrom where you worked previously, or where you did\nyour residency? If so, what?\na. Possible probes: anything that stood out to make\nKP feel like a notably different type of organiza-\ntion . . . \"a different animal.\"\n11. How long did it take you to feel like you knew what\nwas expected of you in terms of both clinical skills\nChesluk et al 9\nand cultural norms? Did this seem like the right\namount of time, or was it shorter or longer than what\nyou expected?\n12. Was there anything you wish you'd known about\nworking in this type of organization before\narriving?\n13. If organizations like KP become more common, what\nshould med school or residency programs do differ-\nently to prepare physicians to work in them?\n14. What advice would you give a physician like your-\nself considering moving to a job at an organization\nlike KP?\n15. What could organizations that make sure practicing\nphysicians are up to date on the knowledge and skills\nthey need do to help physicians practice in an organi-\nzation like KP?\n16. What else should we learn from your experience?\n"
