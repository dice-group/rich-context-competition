To study the relative importance of dietary calcium\nintake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] status in regard to hip BMD, 4958 community-dwelling\nwomen and 5003 men 20 yr of age from the U.S. NHANES III population-based survey were studied.\nCalcium supplement users and individuals with a prior radius or hip fracture were excluded. We calculated\nstandardized means for BMD by quartiles of sex-specific calcium intake for three 25(OH)D categories (<50,\n50\u00ad74, and 75+ nM) among men and women, separately controlling for other important predictors of BMD.\nA higher calcium intake was significantly associated with higher BMD (p value for trend: p = 0.005) only for\nwomen with 25(OH)D status <50 nM, whereas calcium intake beyond the upper end of the lowest quartile\n(>566 mg/d) was not significantly associated with BMD at 25(OH)D concentrations >50 nM. Among men,\nthere was no significant association between a higher calcium intake beyond the upper end of the lowest quartile\n(626 mg/d) and BMD within all 25(OH)D categories. Among both sexes, BMD increased stepwise and signifi-\n0.0001). Among men and women, 25(OH)D status seems to be the dominant predictor of BMD relative to\ncalcium intake. Only women with 25(OH)D concentrations <50 nM seem to benefit from a higher calcium intake.\n",

For\nexample, for adults >50 yr of age, it is 700 mg/d in the\nUnited Kingdom and 1200 mg/d in the United States.(1)\nThese differences may be explained in part by the fact that\ntoday calcium intake recommendations do not consider the\nadditional importance of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]\nconcentrations in regard to calcium absorption.\nRecent studies have suggested that calcium absorption\nis enhanced with higher 25(OH)D status.(2,3) Depending on\nthe size of this effect, calcium intake recommendations\nmay be overestimated among individuals with higher\n25(OH)D concentrations. Consistent with this, an Icelan-\ndic study suggested that, to maintain calcium metabolism,\ncalcium intakes beyond 800 mg/d may only be needed in\nindividuals with 25(OH)D concentrations <25 nM,\nwhereas among individuals with higher 25(OH)D concen-\ntrations, calcium intake did not correlate with PTH con-\ncentrations.(4)\nTo address the relative importance of calcium intake and\n25(OH)D status in regard to hip BMD, we took advantage\nof a large U.S. survey that included measures of BMD,\n25(OH)D status, and calcium intake plus other important\ndeterminants of BMD among adults 20 yr of age. BMD is\nused to define peak bone mass in young adults,(5) and it is a\nstrong predictor of fractures in the elderly.(6)\nData source and subjects\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-\nvey III (NHANES III) was conducted between 1988\nand 1994 to study the health and nutritional status of the\n1Centre on Aging and Mobility, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; 2Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health,\nBoston, Massachusetts, USA; 3Department of Rheumatology and Institute for Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University Hospital\nZurich, Zurich, Switzerland; 4Institute for Aging Research, Hebrew Senior Life, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA;\n5Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 6Department of\nBiostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 7Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public\nHealth, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 8Department of Oral Surgery, The School of Dentistry, University of Birmingham, Birmingham,\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe authors state that they have no conflicts of interest.\nindividuals potentially eligible for BMD scans. Of these,\nwere technically acceptable. Serum 25(OH)D concentra-\nof which were either white, Mexican American, or black,\nand 13,432 had complete data on smoking and body mass\nindex (BMI). Of these, 9962 had dietary calcium intake\nrecorded with a plausible upper intake of <3500 mg/d, did\nnot use calcium supplements, and had no prior radius or\nhip fracture. One woman was excluded for a 25(OH)D\nconcentration of 400 nM. Thus, the final sample consisted\nMeasurement of BMD\nAreal total hip BMD (bone mass per unit of area scan-\nned) was measured using DXA on men and nonpregnant\nDietary calcium intake\nCalcium intake in milligrams per day was assessed in all\nindividuals with one 24-h dietary recall. In addition, as part\nof a nonrandomly selected substudy of NHANES III, ;5%\nof the respondents who came to the mobile exam center for\nmeasurements were invited to ``repeat'' the 24-h recall (n =\n974) within a few weeks after their initial visit. The same\ncomputer-assisted instrument was used for this second as-\nsessment. The within-person variability in the 24-h recall\nwill attenuate associations. For this reason, we used the de-\nattenuation procedure correcting for measurement error\nbased on this one repeat measurement.\nThe correlation between the two measurements was 0.46\namong men and 0.40 among women, suggesting a moderate\nday-to-day variation in calcium intake. Consistently, previ-\nous studies have documented that day-to-day variation for\ncalcium intake is moderate compared with other micronu-\ntrients.(10,11) This may be explained by relatively consistent\ndaily dairy intakes compared with other foods.(11)\nSerum concentration of 25(OH)D\nSerum 25(OH)D concentrations were assayed with ra-\ndioimmunoassay kits [DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN, USA;\nconcentrations in NHANES III were higher than in those\nobserved in the Icelandic Survey, with a small fraction <25\nnM (4.2%), which is why we chose <50 nM as the lowest\n25(OH)D category in this analysis. 25(OH)D concentra-\ntions of at least 75 nM have been suggested as desirable for\noptimal bone health(13) and fracture reduction.(14)\nOther covariates\nRespondents were classified as never smokers (if they\nhad smoked <100 cigarettes in their lifetime), former\nsmokers (100 lifetime cigarettes, not currently smoking),\nand current smokers (100 lifetime cigarettes, currently\nsmoking). Smoking was studied as a potential confounder\nbecause it affects BMD and reduces calcium absorption.(15)\nThe poverty income ratio was computed as the ratio of\nfamily income versus the poverty threshold as produced\nannually by the Census Bureau adjusted for changes\ncaused by inflation. BMI is weight in kilograms divided by\nheight in meters squared. We also adjusted for height as a\npotential confounder independent of BMI because of its\ncorrelation with calcium intake and BMD.(16) The variable\n``any estrogen use'' (never, former, current) was created\nfrom the response on the use and duration of use of ``birth\ncontrol pills'' and ``estrogen or female hormone pills.'' The\n115 subjects with missing values were coded as missing.\nEstrogen use was studied as a potential confounder be-\ncause it affects BMD and increases vitamin D concentra-\ntions by increasing vitamin D\u00adbinding globulin.(17)\nTotal calorie intake was computed from 24-h recalls and\nincluded as a potential confounder for its correlation with\ndietary calcium intake and association with BMD. Physical\nactivity was calculated from the following documented\nactivities, and their intensities were summarized by their\nmetabolic equivalent levels (METs): walked 1 mi without\nstopping, swam, jogged, rode a bicycle, danced, exercised\nor did garden work in the last month.(18) The METs were\ncalculated based on the frequency of each physical activity.\nStatistical analyses\nTo minimize confounding by indication, this sample ex-\ncluded individuals who used calcium supplements or had a\nprior radius or hip fracture (these two fractures are specifi-\ncally assessed in NHANES III). To account for errors in the\nmeasurement of calcium intake, the regression calibration\nmethod was used.(19,20) In the first step, measurement error\u00ad\ncorrected calcium intake was calculated based on one repeat\n24-h recall from a 5% nonrandom subsample. We regressed\nthe repeated measure of calcium intake on the first measure\nfor each person, which was used as the main measurement\nerror\u00adcorrected calcium intake variable calculated as the\nestimated linear regression coefficient times the measured\nintake plus the constant [measurement error corrected cal-\nTo further address error in measuring calcium intake, we\nalso used the multivariate regression calibration method\ndescribed by Spiegelman et al.,(20) where both the point and\ninterval estimates are corrected for measurement error, as\nimplemented in a SAS macro. This method is referred to as\nthe multivariate measurement error correction in Table 4.\nGeneral linear regression analyses were used to model\nthe association between measurement error\u00adcorrected di-\netary calcium intake and BMD. Five covariates, 25(OH)D,\nsex, age, physical activity, and race/ethnicity,(9,21) were\nconsidered as potential effect modifiers. Because both\nmeasurement error\u00adcorrected calcium intake and 25(OH)D\nconcentrations were not normally distributed, effect mod-\nification was assessed after log transformation of these\nvariables. The p value of the interaction term from the\ncross-product term [log 25(OH)D 3 log calcium intake]\nwas 0.005. We further studied effect modification using\nstratification by sex, age group (20\u00ad49 and 50 yr), physical\nactivity (active/inactive), and race/ethnicity (white, black,\nMexican American) within each 25(OH)D category (<50,\nsignificant [p value of the interaction term: 0.01 in\nresults are presented in six subgroups stratified by sex and\n25(OH)D category. Because calcium intakes were higher\nin men, dietary calcium intake was divided into sex-specific\nquartiles. Standardized means for BMD by quartiles of\ndietary calcium intake within each vitamin D category\nwere calculated using regression analysis and adjusting for\nthe following variables: age (10-yr age categories), race/\nethnicity (white, black, Mexican American), BMI, height,\ntotal calorie intake, estrogen use among women, physical\nactivity, smoking, and socio-economic status. The data\nwere standardized to a person of median height and me-\ndian BMI, with a median calorie intake, age 60\u00ad69 yr, of a\nmedian socio-economic status, and in the top tertile of\nphysical activity. Among women, the data were also stan-\ndardized to women not taking estrogen.\nAll statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.1.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 shows the characteristics of participants. Men\nhad significantly higher 25(OH)D concentrations, higher\nmeasurement error\u00adadjusted calcium intake, higher BMD,\nand greater physical activity than women. Seventeen per-\ncent of all men and 27% of all women were physically\ninactive, defined as 0 METs, indicating that these individuals\ndid not walk 1 mi without stopping, did not swim, jog, ride a\nbicycle, dance, exercise, or do garden work in the last\nmonth.

Thus, results are presented for six sub-\ngroups determined by sex and three concentrations of\n25(OH)D. These multivariate analyses are shown in Fig.\n1A for women and Fig. 1B for men.

In the younger women and\nwomen 70 yr of age, women in the lowest 25(OH)D cate-\ngory seemed to benefit from a higher calcium intake, whereas\nwomen with higher 25(OH)D levels did not. However,\namong women 50\u00ad69 yr of age, a higher calcium intake was\nnot associated with BMD at any 25(OH)D category, whereas\nindependent of calcium intake, BMD increased stepwise with\neach higher 25(OH)D status category, similar to our results\nfor all men and women (data not shown).\nTable 4 shows calcium intake as a continuous variable\npredicting BMD in each of the six subgroups.

Among women\nwith low 25(OH)D concentrations, there was a statistically\nsignificant positive association between calcium intake and\nBMD, whereas among women with 25(OH)D concentra-\ntions >50 nM, a higher calcium intake was not appreciably\nassociated with BMD.

Additionally, it is possible that\n25(OH)D concentrations were high enough so that addi-\ntional calcium supplementation had no effect on fracture\nreduction.

This may be explained by a cal-\ncium-sparing effect of higher 25(OH)D concentrations.(2)\nThus, individuals with higher 25(OH)D concentrations\nmay need less calcium to absorb the basic amount needed\nfor bone mineralization. However, in this national survey,\nthis group of women, a higher calcium intake beyond 566\nmg/d may be warranted, or, these women could be sup-\nplemented with vitamin D to shift them to 25(OH)D con-\nMean dietary calcium intakes were significantly higher\namong men, which may explain why men at any 25(OH)D\nserum concentration had no additional benefit of a higher\ndietary calcium intake beyond 626 mg/d (upper end of the\nlowest intake quartile).\nCalcium absorption efficacy declines with age and at\nmenopause.(38,39) This may in part be explained by de-\nclining 25(OH)D levels with age.(2,40) Additionally, at\nmenopause, loss of estrogen triggers bone loss that in turn\nresults in a subtle increase in serum ionized calcium, which\nsuppresses PTH, lowers 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D produc-\ntion, and lowers calcium absorption.(41\u00ad43) Consistent with\nearlier findings by Dawson-Hughes et al.,(43) we found no\ncorrelation between higher calcium intake and BMD\namong women in the age range of early menopause (50\u00ad\n69), even among women in the lowest 25(OH)D category.\nOur findings of a primary role of 25(OH)D serum con-\ncentrations relative to calcium intake in all women inde-\npendent of age and menopausal status are consistent with\nthose from Khosla et al.,(44) where 25(OH)D serum con-\ncentration was the strongest inverse correlate of PTH\namong premenopausal and postmenopausal women with\nor without estrogen replacement therapy, whereas calcium\nintake was a weak inverse correlate of PTH in all subgroups.\nDose of vitamin D supplementation needed for serum\n25(OH)D correction could be estimated based on a dose\u00ad\nresponse calculation proposed by Heaney,(45) where a 1.0\nnM increase in 25(OH)D level can be expected with l mg\nvitamin D3\n/d (40 IU) at low starting levels and a 0.6 nM\n25(OH)D increase can be expected per l mg vitamin D3\n/d at\nhigher starting levels (i.e., >70 nM).

Among\nmen, 80% of Mexican-American women, 76% of Mexican-\nAmerican men, 94% of black women, and 85% of black men\nThe strengths of the study are its large sample size that\nprovided enough power to perform stratification by 25(OH)D\ncategory and sex. One limitation is the cross-sectional design,\nwhich prevents one from assigning a causal relationship be-\ntween vitamin D concentrations or calcium intake and BMD.\nHowever, a causal relationship between both calcium and vi-\ntamin D supplementation has been shown in several ran-\npertain to total hip BMD and may not reflect the relation of\ncalcium intake or vitamin D status to the entire skeleton or\nother endpoints for which the optimal intake of calcium or\nvitamin D intake may well be substantially different.\nAn advantage of the cross-sectional design is that this is\nmore likely to represent the long-term effects of calcium\nintake and 25(OH)D serum concentrations, as opposed to\na short-term intervention. Furthermore, results were con-\nsistent, independent of how calcium intake was analyzed\n(with or without measurement error correction, in quartiles\nor as a continuous variable).\nIn conclusion, our study adds support to the concept that\nthe correction of 25(OH)D status is more important than\nincreasing dietary calcium intake beyond 566 mg/d among\nwomen and 626 mg/d among men for better hip BMD. A\nhigher calcium intake beyond 566 mg/d may only be im-\nportant among women with 25(OH)D concentrations <50\nnM, whereas among women with higher 25(OH)D con-\ncentrations, hip BMD is not correlated with calcium\nintake. Among men, the need for a calcium intake beyond\n625 mg/d in respect to total hip BMD is not supported by our\nresults, whereas higher 25(OH)D concentrations were as-\nsociated with higher BMD among men and women. Within\nthis sample of U.S. adults, a large fraction of younger and\nolder adults was below the desirable 25(OH)D threshold of\nat least 75 nM, whereas calcium intakes seemed to be ade-\nquate in the majority of individuals with respect to hip\n"
