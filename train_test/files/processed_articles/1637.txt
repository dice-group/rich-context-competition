However, this relationship has not been well characterized in\nracial/ethnic minorities. Therefore, this study determined the haemoglobin\nthreshold below which risk of death is significantly increased in older non-\nHispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. Data on 4089\nparticipants of the 1988\u00ad94 US National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey who were 65 years of age were analyzed with mortality follow-up\nthrough December 31, 2000. Mean haemoglobin in non-Hispanic whites\nparticipants died. Among non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, age-\nand sex-adjusted models showed that the haemoglobin thresholds below\nwhich mortality risk was significantly increased were 4 and 2 g/l respectively,\nabove the World Health Organization (WHO) cut-off points for anaemia. In\ncontrast, the threshold for non-Hispanic blacks was 7 g/l below the WHO\ncriteria. Similar threshold effects were observed when analyzing haemoglobin\nin categories and adjusting for multiple confounders. In conclusion, the\nhaemoglobin threshold below which mortality rises significantly is a full g/dl\nlower in non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic whites and Mexican\nAmericans.\nKeywords: anaemia, haemoglobin concentration, race/ethnicity, ageing,\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nresearch paper\nsuggest that the WHO criteria provide a slightly conservative\ndefinition of anaemia for the general older population, having\ncut-off points that are too low.\nThere are, however, significant racial differences in the\ndistribution of haemoglobin in the United States. Numerous\ncommunity-based studies have demonstrated that haemoglo-\nbin levels are lower in blacks compared to whites, even among\nchildren and healthy young adults (Pan & Habicht, 1991; Reed\n2007). In older adults, the prevalence of WHO-defined\n2008). Racial differences in haemoglobin values range from 4\nto 14 g/l and persist after accounting for socioeconomic status,\nhealth behaviours, nutritional status, and multiple morbidities\nJohnson-Spear & Yip, 1994). As a result, a number of expert\ngroups have proposed different criteria to define anaemia\nseparately by race/ethnicity (Beutler & Waalen, 2006; Earl &\nWoteki, 1993; International Nutritional Anemia Consultative\nUnited Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)/United Nations\nUniversity (UNU), 2001). However, few outcomes-based\nstudies have carefully evaluated whether race-specific criteria\nare justified.\nGiven that anaemia is commonly encountered in geriatric\npractice and is no longer viewed as an `innocent bystander'\n(Nissenson et al, 2003), the current study determined the\nhaemoglobin threshold below which risk of death is signifi-\ncantly increased in older non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic\nblacks, and Mexican Americans. In addition, the distributions\nof common causes or subtypes of anaemia (e.g. anaemia\nassociated with nutrient deficiency, chronic kidney disease,\ninflammation) were examined by race/ethnicity. Mortality\nrisks associated with the subtypes of anaemia were examined\nas well.\nMethods\nStudy design and population\nData from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-\nNHANES III used a complex multistage sampling design to\nprovide a nationally representative sample of the civilian non-\ninstitutionalized US population, aged 2 months and older (i.e.\nno upper age limit) (National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS), 1994). Children, older adults, African Americans,\nand Mexican Americans were oversampled to provide reliable\nestimates of health conditions in these subpopulations. All\nparticipants provided written informed consent and then\nunderwent a home interview followed by a physical examina-\ntion either in a mobile examination centre or at home.\nExaminations included phlebotomy for those aged 1 year and\nolder. There were two phases of data collection, each providing\na nationally representative sample. Complete blood counts\nwere collected in both phases of data collection, but the\nrequisite tests for determining the subtypes of anaemia were\nolder, 4199 had haemoglobin values available for analysis. An\nadditional 109 persons were excluded who did not identify\ntheir race/ethnicity as either non-Hispanic white, non-His-\npanic black, or Mexican American. In one participant, vital\nstatus tracing was not possible. Therefore, the analytic sample\nsize for the current study was 4089 older adults; for analyses\nrestricted to Phase II, 1954 older adults were available for\nanalysis. Vital status was determined by a search of the\n1944 deaths over the 12 year follow-up period (median follow-\nup was 7\u00c63 years). Participants missing haemoglobin values\nwere significantly older, more likely to be female than male,\nless likely to be Mexican American than non-Hispanic white,\nand more likely to die over the follow-up period compared\nwith those not missing haemoglobin values.\nLaboratory measurements\nThe laboratory methods used in NHANES III have been\npreviously reviewed and described in detail (Gunter et al, 1996,\nGuralnik et al, 2004). Briefly, haemoglobin concentration was\nmeasured using a Coulter S-Plus Jr electronic counter (Coulter\nElectronics, Hialeah, FL, USA) that was calibrated daily.\nColorimetric methods were used to determine serum iron and\ntotal iron-binding capacity (transferrin Alpkem RFA analyzer,\nClackamas, OR, USA). The Quantimmune Ferritin Kit (Bio-\nRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) was used to measure\nserum ferritin. Fluorescence extraction was applied to measure\nfree erythrocyte protoporphyrin (Gunter et al, 1989). The Bio-\nRad Laboratories Quantaphase Folate radioassay kit was used\nto determine folate and vitamin B12\n. Red blood cell (RBC)\nfolate was calculated using the following formula after a 1:22\ndilution of the whole blood: RBC folate = [(whole blood\ncrit/100]. For participants who underwent a home examina-\ntion, only serum folate was able to be determined.\nSerum creatinine was determined by a kinetic rate Jaffe\nmethod using an autoanalyzer (Hitachi model 737, Boehringer\nMannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). As recom-\nmended, serum creatinine values were recalibrated to the\nCleveland Clinic Research Laboratory standard by applying the\nfollowing formula: [standardized creatinine = )0\u00c6184 +\nThe estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated\nusing the following abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal\nDisease (MDRD) Study formula expressed for standardized\nHaemoglobin and Mortality Risk in Older Adults\nthe participant is black)] (Levey et al, 2006). C-reactive protein\n(CRP) level was measured using latex-enhanced nephelometry\n(Behring Diagnostics, Somerville, NJ, USA).\nDefinitions of anaemia and subtypes\nAnaemia was defined using the WHO criteria of haemoglobin\nconcentration <120 g/l in women and <130 g/l in men as well as\nby race/ethnicity-specific criteria based on survival analyses\n(described in the Data analysis section). Participants were\nconsidered iron deficient if at least 2 of the 3 following criteria\nwere met: transferrin saturation <15%, serum ferritin <12 lg/l,\nand erythrocyte protoporphyrin >1\u00c624 lmol/l (Looker et al,\ndeficiency was defined as serum B12\nas RBC folate <106\u00c62 lg/l among participants examined in the\nmobile examination centre, while serum folate <2\u00c66 lg/l was\nused to identify deficiency in those examined at home (Gunter\nAnaemic participants who were not deficient in iron, folate,\nwere evaluated for other causes of anaemia. An eGFR\nanaemia associated with chronic kidney disease (Astor et al,\n2002). Anaemia of chronic inflammation (ACI), characterized\nby reduced circulating serum iron levels but adequate iron\nstorage, was defined as serum iron <10\u00c674 lmol/l and no\nevidence of iron deficiency. If participants with anaemia were\nnot classified with nutrient deficiency, chronic kidney disease,\nor ACI, then they were considered to have unexplained\nanaemia.\nDemographic and health status measures\nA wide range of demographic and health status variables were\ncollected during the home interview. Participants were asked\nto self-identify their race and ethnicity. Socioeconomic\nposition was assessed in terms of the highest grade of\neducation completed and by the poverty income ratio, defined\nas household income divided by the US poverty level according\nto household size and area of residence. A standard set of\nquestions were used to classify participants as never, former, or\ncurrent smokers. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using\nmeasured height and weight (BMI = weight in kilograms/\nheight in metres squared). Medical conditions were assessed by\nasking participants if a doctor has ever told them that they had\nany of the following: cancer (non-skin related), congestive\nheart failure, diabetes, heart attack, pulmonary diseases\n(asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema), rheumatoid\narthritis, and stroke. In addition, participants were asked if\nthey had difficulty walking a quarter of a mile or walking up to\n10 stairs without resting. If participants reported much\ndifficulty or were unable to do these activities, then they were\nconsidered to have mobility limitations. Finally, overnight\nhospitalization stays within the past year were also assessed\nthrough self-report.\nData analysis\nDescriptive statistics (means and proportions) were used to\nexamine the baseline characteristics of the study sample by race/\nethnicity (Table I). Haemoglobin concentration was analyzed\nboth as a continuous and categorical variable. Six haemoglobin\ncategories were specified a priori, three below the WHO cut-off\nbelow the WHO cut-off point) and three above the WHO cut-\nabove the WHO cut-off point). For all survival analyses, the\nlength of follow-up was calculated from the date of examina-\ntion, when blood was collected, to the date of death or the end\nTable I.

V. Patel et al\nof follow-up on December 31, 2000. All analyses were stratified\nby race/ethnicity because there were significant interactions of\nrace (non-Hispanic black versus non-Hispanic white) with\nWHO-defined anaemia as well as with the categories of\nhaemoglobin in predicting mortality; however, there were no\nstatistically significant differences between Mexican Americans\nand non-Hispanic whites or Mexican Americans and non-\nHispanic blacks in mortality risk according to WHO-defined\nanaemia or categories of haemoglobin concentration.\nKaplan\u00adMeier survival curves were plotted by categories of\nhaemoglobin concentration for each racial/ethnic group\n(Fig 1). Cox proportional hazard models were then used to\nassess the association of haemoglobin level with mortality\n(Table II). The first model adjusted for age and sex, while the\nsecond adjusted for all potential confounding factors. Plots of\nSchoenfeld residuals were examined to confirm the propor-\ntional hazards assumption. To examine the non-linear effects of\nhaemoglobin concentration and to identify the threshold below\nwhich mortality risk was increased, proportional hazard models\nwere fitted with a penalized spline for haemoglobin concen-\ntration (centred on the WHO criteria cut-off points) adjusting\nfor age and sex using R statistical software (Fig 2) (Team,\n2007). Finally, among Phase II participants, the distribution of\ncommon causes or subtypes of anaemia were compared by race/\nethnicity using chi square statistics in those with anaemia\ndefined by the WHO criteria and by race/ethnicity-specific\ncriteria identified by mortality risks (Table III). Proportional\nhazard models were also used to determine whether each of the\nunderlying causes or subtypes of anaemia was associated with\nan increased risk of death (Table IV). Using indicator variables\nto compare non-anaemia to each of the anaemia subtypes,\na basic model was first fitted adjusting for age, sex, and race/\nethnicity and then a fully adjusted model was estimated. Unless\nnoted otherwise, all analyses were weighted and accounted for\nthe complex sampling methods and non-response bias to\nprovide estimates for the US population using stata software,\nversion 10. P values <0\u00c605 were considered statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nThe average age of the study sample was approximately\n73 years and slightly more than half were women (Table I).\nNon-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans had substan-\ntially lower levels of education and income compared to non-\nHispanic whites.

Congestive heart\nfailure, diabetes, mobility limitations, and overnight hospital-\nizations were more common in non-Hispanic blacks and\nMexican Americans than in non-Hispanic whites; however,\nthis pattern was reversed for cancer and pulmonary diseases.\nThe association of haemoglobin level with mortality is\nshown in Fig 1. Among older non-Hispanic whites, the\nsurvival curves clearly separated, with lower haemoglobin\nconcentration associated with poorer survival that was sus-\ntained over time. In contrast, a clear survival gradient across\nhaemoglobin levels was not seen in older non-Hispanic blacks,\nbut rather poor survival was only observed in those with\nhaemoglobin >10\u00c60 g/l below the WHO cut-off point. Impor-\ntantly, non-Hispanic blacks with haemoglobin 0\u00c61\u00ad5\u00c60 g/l\nbelow the WHO cut-off point had a survival pattern similar\nto those with haemoglobin levels above the WHO cut-off\npoint. Although the survival curves were less stable in older\nMexican Americans because of smaller sample sizes and lower\nevent rates, survival was worse in those with lower haemoglo-\nbin concentration.\nAfter adjusting for age and sex, there was a stepwise\nincreased risk of death associated with lower haemoglobin\nconcentration in non-Hispanic whites relative to those in the\nWHO cut-off point (Table II). There was even a significant\n27% increased mortality risk in those with a haemoglobin\n0\u00c60\u00ad9\u00c69 g/l above the WHO cut-off point. For non-Hispanic\nblacks, mortality risk was flat until haemoglobin was down to\n5\u00c61\u00ad10\u00c60 g/l below the WHO cut-off point, but only became\nclearly significant for those >10\u00c60 g/l below the WHO cut-off\npoint compared to the reference group. Mexican Americans\nhad a stepwise increased risk for mortality associated with\nlower haemoglobin level that was similar to the pattern\nobserved in non-Hispanic whites, although mortality risk was\nnearly fivefold higher in Mexican Americans with haemoglobin\n>10\u00c60 g/l below the WHO cut-off point relative to the\nreference group. Further adjustment for socioeconomic fac-\ntors, health behaviour, and health status did not substantially\nchange the patterns of association (Table II). Consistent with\nresults in Table II, the non-linear association between haemo-\nglobin and mortality adjusted for age and sex is shown in Fig 2.\nThe haemoglobin threshold below which risk of death\nincreased significantly was 4 and 2 g/l above the WHO cut-\noff point in non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans,\nrespectively. In non-Hispanic blacks, however, the threshold\nwas 7 g/l below the WHO cut-off point.\nTable II.

V. Patel et al\nTable III shows the distribution of the subtypes of anaemia\nby race/ethnicity. Among those with WHO defined anaemia,\nnutrient deficiency ranged between 33% and 41% across the\nthree racial/ethnic groups. Iron deficiency anaemia was higher\namong Mexican Americans but not statistically different\n(P = 0\u00c612), whereas folate deficiency was significantly more\ncommon in non-Hispanic blacks (P < 0\u00c601). The proportion\nof anaemic non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans\nalone was twice as high as compared to non-Hispanic blacks,\nbut these differences were not statistically different\n(P = 0\u00c610). In contrast, the proportion with ACI alone was\nmore than doubled in non-Hispanic blacks relative to non-\nHispanic whites and Mexican Americans (P < 0\u00c601). Unex-\nplained anaemia did not vary by race/ethnicity (P = 0\u00c681),\nbut was less common in Mexican Americans than in non-\nHispanic whites or non-Hispanic blacks. Interestingly, when\nethnicity-specific haemoglobin cut-off points (identified from\nsurvival analyses in Fig 2) were used to define anaemia\ninstead of the WHO criteria (Table III), the distribution of\nanaemia subtypes did not substantially change even though\nthe number of anaemia cases increased in non-Hispanic\nThe association of anaemia subtypes with mortality is shown\nin Table IV. Relative to those who were non-anaemic accord-\ning to WHO criteria, anaemia in participants with nutrient\ndeficiency and ACI was associated with a significantly\nincreased risk of death adjusting for age, sex, and race/\nethnicity. In contrast, when ethnicity-specific criteria were\napplied to define anaemia, each subtype was a significant\npredictor of mortality except for unexplained anaemia\n(P = 0\u00c606) adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Further\nadjustment for potential confounding factors generally\nreduced the strengths of association.\nDiscussion\nIn a nationally representative cohort of community-dwelling\nolder adults, the current study found that the haemoglobin\nthreshold below which mortality risk was significantly\nincreased varied by race/ethnicity. Among non-Hispanic\nwhites and Mexican Americans, the haemoglobin thresholds\nwere 4 and 2 g/l respectively, above the WHO cut-off points\nfor defining anaemia, while in non-Hispanic blacks the\nthreshold was 7 g/l below the WHO criteria. These differences\nare remarkably consistent with known racial/ethnic differences\nin the distribution of haemoglobin concentration.

Note: The x-axis is centred\non the WHO cut points for anaemia and therefore the 0 value corresponds to haemoglobin of 120 g/l in women and 130 g/l in men. The dotted\nvertical line indicates where the risk of death is significantly increased (lower bound of the 95% CI is above 0\u00c60), while dashed lines are the 95% CI.\nHaemoglobin and Mortality Risk in Older Adults\nNHANES III, haemoglobin was, on average, 10 g/l lower in\nolder non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic whites, which\nwas nearly the same magnitude of difference in haemoglobin\nthresholds for increased risk of death. Importantly, the\ndistribution of common causes of anaemia generally did not\ndiffer by race/ethnicity and each anaemia subtype was asso-\nciated with higher mortality compared to non-anaemic\npersons. Taken together, these findings indicate that racial\ndifferences in the haemoglobin threshold for mortality are not\nexplained by differences in the distribution of common causes\nof anaemia in older adults. Thus, these findings underscore the\nneed to clinically address mild cases of anaemia in older adults\nand provide outcomes-based evidence that a revised definition\nof anaemia is needed that takes race into account.\nRacial differences in haemoglobin distribution are believed\nto result, in part, from strong genetic pressure exerted by\nendemic malaria in various regions of Africa. For instance,\ncertain haemoglobinopathies, such as a-thalassaemia, that\nreduce the burden of malaria infection, occur more frequently\nin blacks than in whites. Indeed, Beutler and West (2005)\nshowed that as much as one-third of the racial difference in\nhaemoglobin concentration might be explained by a-thalas-\nsaemia. Given that haemoglobin concentration is heritable\ngenetic adaptations to environmental demand inside and\noutside of Africa contribute to racial differences in haemoglo-\nbin set point.\nFew studies have prospectively assessed the effect of\nhaemoglobin or anaemia on adverse outcomes separately by\nrace or ethnicity. In a cohort of older adults living in North\nCarolina, Denny et al (2006) showed that WHO-defined\nanaemia was associated with an increased risk of death in\nboth black and white participants, but haemoglobin thresholds\nfor predicting mortality were not evaluated by race. In\ncontrast, a study of relatively healthy and well-functioning\nolder adults showed that WHO-defined anaemia significantly\npredicted mortality over a 6-year period in whites, but not in\nblacks (Patel et al, 2007). Although there was some indication\nthat mortality risk increased at a lower haemoglobin threshold\nin black men than in white men, there were not enough deaths\nin the study to determine stable threshold effects by race and\nsex (Patel et al, 2007). More recently, a lower haemoglobin\nthreshold for mortality risk was observed in community-\ndwelling older blacks than in whites living in Chicago (Dong\nA limitation of the current study and others in the literature\nis that haemoglobin was assessed on a single occasion. While it\nis likely that low haemoglobin in some participants would have\nresolved 3\u00ad6 months later, this is unlikely to explain the\nTable III.

A second limitation is that\nthere were not enough racial/ethnic minority participants\navailable to further stratify the analyses by sex, although all\nanalyses were adjusted for sex and there were no significant sex\nby haemoglobin interactions. The major strength of the study\nis that the sample is representative of community-dwelling\nolder adults in the United States. In addition, the NHANES III\ncohort was followed-up for mortality over a long time period\nand the study participants were well characterized to enable\nadjustment for multiple potential confounding factors. Finally,\nunlike any previous large, population-based study of anaemia\nin older adults with long-term mortality follow-up, the\nlaboratory testing in NHANES III permitted classification of\nsubjects into common subtypes of anaemia. Although more\nup-to-date laboratory measures, including tests for methylma-\nlonic acid and serum transferrin receptor levels, and a\nmore in-depth clinical haematological work-up would have\nimproved this classification, the distribution of anaemia\nsubtypes did not vary substantially by race/ethnicity.\nIn conclusion, anaemia is a multifactorial condition that is\nassociated with a variety of adverse outcomes in older adults.\nWhile further research is needed to elucidate the pathophys-\niology of unexplained anaemia cases in late life (Longo, 2005),\nresults from the current study demonstrated that the major\nsubtypes of anaemia are associated with increased risk of death.\nThe majority of anaemia cases in older adults are probably\namenable to therapy, but whether correcting mild anaemia\nimproves function and survival will require randomized\ncontrolled trials. Therefore, it is imperative that, for clinical\nand research purposes, a clear case definition of anaemia be\nestablished. In view of the NHANES III mortality results as\nwell as the extant literature documenting racial differences\nin haemoglobin distribution, a revised definition of anaemia\nthat takes race into account should be considered. To establish\nthe haemoglobin cut-off points based on risk for adverse\nevents, there must be consistency across studies and therefore\nadditional epidemiological research in racially/ethnically\ndiverse cohorts is required.\n"
