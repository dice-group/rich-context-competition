No association of leptin concen-\ntration with bone density, independent of overall adiposity,\nwas found in four small nonpopulation studies of middle-\naged or postmenopausal women using various definitions of\nbone mass.(13\u00ad16) There was an inconsistent positive rela-\ntionship of leptin with BMD at regional sites in premeno-\npausal but not postmenopausal women in one study(17) and\nat one or more but not all bone sites in studies of nonobese\nwomen(18) and postmenopausal women.(19) Bone density\nwas inversely associated with leptin concentration in a study\nof men.(20) In a small, population-based study, leptin was\nunassociated with BMD independent of fat mass in women,\nand there was an inconsistent inverse relationship in\nTo examine the relationship of leptin concentration with\nBMD in adult men and women, we measured serum leptin\nconcentration in a large, representative U.S. population\nsample and studied its relationship with proximal femoral\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III) was conducted in the United States\nStatistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC).

All BMI values used\nin the calculation of the BMI change variable were based on\nreported weights (reported weights were highly correlated\nwith measured weights,   0.98). A physical activity\nintensity\u00adlevel variable was created by summing the prod-\nucts of activity frequency in the previous month and an\nintensity rating (or rate of energy expenditure, calculated as\nthe ratio of work metabolic rate to resting metabolic rate\n[METs](27)) for nine common activities (walking, jogging or\nrunning, bicycling, swimming, aerobics, dancing, calisthen-\nics, gardening or yard work, and weight lifting).

Relations of leptin with con-\ntinuous bone density\u00adrelated factors were examined by cal-\nculating weighted Pearson's correlation coefficients (). To\ninvestigate the relation of leptin concentration and bone\ndensity, we controlled for the effects of BMI and other bone\ndensity\u00adrelated factors using multiple linear regression\nanalysis. We examined the relation of bone density with\nleptin concentration both by treating leptin concentration as\na continuous variable and by calculating mean bone density\nestimates for leptin concentration quintiles. For the latter\nanalysis, leptin quintiles were categorized as indicator vari-\nables and mean bone density was estimated by least squares\nmeans computed using SUDAAN PROC REGRESS (Re-\nsearch Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC,\nUSA).(30) The p values for trend in mean bone density\nacross leptin quintiles were computed by including leptin\nconcentration in the models as an ordinal variable of five\nlevels. Interaction terms for leptin and covariates were eval-\nuated by adding them individually to multivariate models.\nBecause leptin concentrations were skewed to the right,\ntransformation was performed to normalize the distri-\nbution for regression analyses with leptin as a continuous\nvariable. Because of the large number of factors potentially\nrelated to bone density, only those factors that were asso-\nciated with bone density in multivariate analysis (p  0.1)\nwere retained in the models to which leptin was added.\nMultivariate analyses excluded persons with missing values\nfor any factor included in the model (numbers excluded for\nmen and premenopausal and postmenopausal women, re-\nassociated value of p  0.05 was considered statistically\nsignificant. Analyses incorporated sample weights, stratifi-\ncation, and clustering using SUDAAN software.(30)\nRESULTS\nCharacteristics of men and pre- and postmenopausal\nwomen in the study sample are shown in Table 1. Mean\nBMD of the total hip was higher in men than in women and\nhigher in premenopausal women than postmenopausal\nwomen (p  0.001). Conversely, mean fasting serum leptin\nconcentration was higher in women than in men and higher\nin postmenopausal women than in premenopausal women\nMean bone density increased with increasing leptin con-\ncentration in men (p  0.003; Table 2). However, after\nadjusting for BMI, an inverse association emerged between\nleptin concentration and bone density (p  0.001; Table 2).\nThe inverse association remained in multivariate analyses\ncontrolling for BMI and age (p  0.001; Table 2) or BMI,\nage, and other bone density\u00adrelated factors (p  0.001;\nTable 2 and Fig. 1). This inverse relationship was examined\nfurther in subgroups based on BMI or age. The relationship\nof leptin and bone density varied with level of BMI (test for\ninteraction, p  0.011). When examined by BMI subgroup\nobese, 30 kg/m2) in multivariate analysis, the inverse\nassociation of bone density with leptin concentration was\nlimited to overweight men (p  0.004), and there was no\nrelationship in normal weight (p  0.52) or obese (p \n0.58) men (Fig. 2A). Interaction was also found between\nleptin concentration and age (p  0.001). In multivariate\nanalysis by age group, the inverse association of bone\ndensity with leptin concentration was found in young (p \nrelationship in older men (p  0.27; Fig. 2B).\nThe effect of fasting serum insulin concentration on the\nrelation between serum leptin concentration and BMD was\nexamined in the subgroup of men without a doctor diagnosis\nof diabetes. Insulin concentration was correlated with leptin\nconcentration (  0.64) and was strongly associated with\nlog-transformed insulin concentration [pmol/liter]). After\nadjusting for other bone density\u00adrelated factors, insulin\nconcentration was inversely associated with bone density\nwhen insulin and leptin concentrations were included to-\ngether in the multivariate model, insulin concentration was\nnot independently associated with bone density ( \non the inverse association of leptin concentration with bone\ndensity.\nAs expected, BMD was strongly associated with BMI\nunadjusted analysis) and adjusting for leptin concentration\nstrengthened this relationship (  0.022 per kg/m2, SE \ndensity with BMI after controlling for leptin concentration\nis also seen in Fig. 2A where bone density increased with\nincreasing BMI within each leptin concentration quintile.\nAmong premenopausal women, mean bone density in-\ncreased with increasing leptin concentration (p  0.001;\nTable 2). After adjusting for BMI, an inverse association\nwas found (p  0.019; Table 2). This relationship was\ndiminished after controlling for age (p  0.076; Table 2)\nand eliminated after adjusting for additional bone density\u00ad\nrelated factors (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Among premenopausal\nwomen without doctor-diagnosed diabetes, insulin concen-\ntration was correlated with leptin concentration (  0.64)\nand was strongly associated with bone density (  0.076,\nconcentration [pmol/liter]) but not independent of other\np  0.22).

Among\npostmenopausal women, there was a relationship between\nleptin and bone density that depended on estrogen-\nreplacement status (p value for interaction  0.027). Thus,\non stratifying by estrogen-replacement status in multivariate\nanalysis, an inverse association of bone density with leptin\nconcentration was found among current users (p  0.013),\nwhereas there was no relationship among never users (p \nstrongly associated with BMI (  0.014 per kg/m2, SE \nadjusting for leptin concentration (  0.012 per kg/m2,\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of this large, national, population-based,\ncross-sectional study of adult men and women do not pro-\nvide evidence for a direct effect of serum leptin concentra-\ntion on BMD. In addition, leptin concentration does not\nappear to mediate the positive relationship of BMD with\nBMI. Among men, this latter relationship is seen graphi-\ncally in Fig. 2A. Small studies of selected samples of\nmen and women(21) have, likewise, found no strong associ-\nations of leptin concentration with bone density. In mice,\nleptin has been found to inhibit bone formation, acting\nthrough a central control mechanism involving the hypo-\nthalamus.(11) Obese, leptin-deficient (ob/ob) and leptin\nreceptor\u00addeficient (db/db) mice have increased bone forma-\ntion leading to high bone mass. The high bone mass phe-\nnotype cannot be explained by obesity alone and occurs\ndespite the negative influences of hypogonadism and hyper-\ncortisolism. Intracerebroventricular leptin administration\ncompletely reverses the high bone mass of ob/ob mice and\nCharacteristic\nMen\nWomen\nPremenopausal\nPostmenopausal\nEthnicity (%  SE)a\nOral contraceptive use (%  SE) -- 16  1 --\nPostmenopausal oral estrogen use (%  SE) -- -- 13  1\na Percentage totals do not equal 100% because of other ethnicities not shown.\nb Sum of the products of activity frequency in the previous month and an intensity rating27 for nine common activities.\nSignificantly different, p  0.05, from *men and premenopausal women.\ninduces bone loss in wild-type mice. However, leptin and\nleptin receptor\u00addeficient mice represent extreme situations\nin which there is a total loss of leptin function, which may\nnot be relevant to human populations. In obese humans,\nhigh leptin concentrations can be associated with leptin\nresistance because of impaired transport of leptin to the\nhypothalamus. The lack of a direct correlation of leptin\nconcentration with bone density in our study and other\nhuman studies may be caused by, at least in part, decreased\nleptin function despite high levels that occur with leptin\nSerum leptin and insulin concentrations are highly corre-\nlated, and both have been considered part of the metabolic\nsyndrome and its attendant disease-related complica-\ntions.(32) Insulin levels have also been shown to be related to\nbone density.(7,33) However, in this analysis, insulin concen-\ntration was not associated independently with BMD and did\nnot influence the relationship of leptin concentration to bone\ndensity. Nevertheless, because of the limitations of a cross-\nsectional study, we cannot exclude a relationship of leptin\nand insulin to bone density.\nIn multivariate analyses, we found a negative association\nof serum leptin concentrations with BMD in certain hor-\nmonally influenced situations such as younger men, who\nhave higher testosterone levels,(34) and postmenopausal\nwomen on hormone-replacement therapy. Additionally, in\npremenopausal women who would be expected to have high\nestrogen levels, there was an inverse association indepen-\ndent of BMI but not of additional bone density\u00adrelated\nfactors (Table 2).\nThese intriguing findings that suggest a hormonally me-\ndiated relationship of leptin with BMD could not be eval-\nuated further because sex steroid levels were not measured\nin NHANES III. Nevertheless, other studies have suggested\na relationship that should be pursued. Among men, serum\nleptin levels have been found to correlate negatively with\ntotal and bioavailable testosterone levels.(35) Testosterone\nappears to increase bone density in men.(36) It is possible\nthat the inverse association of bone density with leptin\nconcentration that we found in young and middle-aged men\nwas caused by confounding by serum testosterone concen-\ntration rather than to an effect of leptin on bone density.

The reason for the inverse\nassociation of bone density with leptin concentration in such\nwomen is unclear because hormone-replacement therapy\nhas been found to increase(38) or be unrelated to(39\u00ad40) leptin\nlevels.\nOur study had other limitations. In NHANES III, BMD\nwas measured only at the proximal femur. We cannot ex-\nclude the possibility of an effect of leptin concentration on\nbone density at nonweight-bearing sites such as the spine or\nradius. As with all cross-sectional studies, leptin was mea-\nsured at one point in time, and bone mass is accumulated\nand lost over a lifetime. Also, because of the cross-sectional\ndesign, we limited our study to BMD, rather than fractures\nthat might have occurred many years before leptin measure-\nment. In addition, approximately one-third of participants\nhad to be excluded because they were not examined in the\nmorning after an appropriate fast or had missing data. Fi-\nnally, the correlation of leptin concentration and BMI makes\ntheir independent effects on bone density more difficult to\ndetermine.\nIn conclusion, this study did not find a clear-cut associ-\nation of leptin with BMD.
