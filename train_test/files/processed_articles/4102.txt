In the United Kingdom (Department of Health\n(Airaksinen et al., 2006; Institute of Medicine of the National\ntowards encouraging self-management as a strategy for\nreducing these impacts. The broad context to this strategy is\nthe transition to an older population characterised by long-\nterm health problems in a climate of rising healthcare costs\nand limited state funding (Bury et al., 2005; Dagenais et al.,\nshift from a `medical model' towards the `empowerment' of\nservice users to control their own ways of living with illness\nobserved among social scientists that the shift towards self-\nmanagement is part of a socio-political context in which the\nbalance of responsibility for health has shifted from the state\nto the individual (Clarke and Bennett, 2013).\nA number of generic (Kennedy et al., 2007) and disease-\n2012) self-management programmes have been developed\nto improve quality of life and independence for people with\nlong-term conditions, and there is a trend towards online\nsupport and other digital resources.

Outcomes of interventions directed\ntowards self-management can be disappointing (Du et al.,\net al., 2012), and degrees of engagement and confidence in\nself-management can vary considerably (Audulv, 2013;\nDespite its strategic importance, there has been little\nresearch into the concept and meaning of self-management\nor how it is best achieved and supported in people with\nCLBP. Various obstacles to self-management have been\nidentified, including patient and healthcare provider resist-\nance, poor access to information and services and lack of\nknowledge among healthcare providers (Briggs et al., 2012;\nfundamental obstacle to effective implementation is the\nexistence of divergent viewpoints on the nature and mean-\ning of effective self-management on the part of different\ndivergent viewpoints on self-management related to differ-\nent understandings and explanations of the nature, causes\nand consequences of CLBP (McParland et al., 2011; Risdon\net al., 2003). In particular, if patients' viewpoints do not\ncorrespond with those of healthcare providers (Busby et al.,\npractices of self-management that expect people with pain\nto apply professional advice to the particularities of their\ncontext of a `communication chasm', suggesting that medi-\ncal explanations that invoke the psychological dimension\ncan prove controversial with patients (Corbett et al., 2009;\nsystematically explores the range of viewpoints on self-\nmanagement held among stakeholders in CLBP care to\ninform service developments and enable more effective\nself-management for people with pain.\nMethod\nQ methodology\nQ methodology is a mixed-methods approach designed to\nexplore the subjective dimension of any issue towards\nwhich different viewpoints can be expressed (Stenner and\nStainton Rogers, 2004). It has a long tradition of successful\napplications in the field of health studies (Farrimond et al.,\nbeen used to gain valuable insights in the study of chronic\net al., 2003). Exploring viewpoints on self-management in\nCLBP from the perspectives of both people with pain and\nhealthcare providers requires an appropriate methodology\ndesigned to detect differences of viewpoint while affording\nscope for their rigorous comparison. Q methodology per-\nmits participants to express their own viewpoint in a struc-\ntured way as a `Q sort' (Stenner et al., 2008). A Q sort is a\ncollection of items (usually a set of statements of opinion)\nwhich are sorted by a participant according to a subjective\ndimension such as `agreement/disagreement'.\nEach Q sort provides the researcher with a model of\neach participant's viewpoint (see Figure 1), and the result-\ning numerical data can be analysed quantitatively to find\npatterns among the viewpoints.Aby-person correlation and\npattern analysis (typically factor analysis or principal com-\nponent analysis) of the collected Q sorts enables the statisti-\ncal identification of any shared viewpoints among the\nsample (Watts and Stenner, 2012). The result of a Q\nFigure 1. The Q sort response grid.\nStenner et al. 3\nanalysis is a set of factors each of which identifies a cluster\nof Q sorts which have been sorted in essentially the same\nway. A qualitative exegesis of the quantitative results yields\nan interpretation of the shared viewpoint which informs the\ndistinctive way of Q sorting captured by each factor.\nGenerating the Q set\nThe first phase of Q methodology is the development of the\nitems composing the Q set (the set of statements of opinion\nto be given to participants for Q sorting). The Q set items\nare statements which express the range of opinions, propo-\nsitions and positions that are encountered in discussion\naround self-management of CLBP. To generate these state-\nments, three sources were examined: (1) a review of rele-\nvant literature, (2) a series of discussions held by the project\nsteering group (composed of researchers, clinicians and\nservice user representatives) and (3) the analysis of seven\nfocus groups run with people with varying levels of pain (as\ndetermined by Von Korff et al.'s (1992) chronic pain grade)\nand healthcare providers in the south east of England\n(including representatives from physiotherapy, clinical\npsychology, pain consultancy, general practice, orthopae-\ndics, rheumatology, occupational health and practice man-\nagement in primary, secondary and third sector care\nservices). From these sources, 372 initial statements were\ngenerated and then divided into 10 themes, each containing\nseveral emergent categories. From these, a Q set of 60\nstatements was selected for piloting through a process of\nremoving duplicates, synonyms and otherwise overlapping\npropositions, and \u00ad where redundancy of items within cat-\negories existed \u00ad selecting the most representative items\nwhile maintaining diversity and balance. The service user\nrepresentatives on our steering group played an active role\nin selecting and refining the final item set. The pilot study\ninvolved steering group members, professional contacts\nand several participants from the focus groups. The final\nitem set is shown in Figure 2.\nParticipant recruitment\nEthical approval was gained from the National Health\nService (NHS) and host University Research Ethics\nCommittees. People with pain and healthcare providers\nwere recruited using emails and flyers targeted at relevant\nlocal healthcare services and providers in the south east of\nEngland. An invitation leaflet outlining the study and con-\ntact details were given to people meeting the inclusion cri-\nteria and considered to have an interest. Information sheets\nwere provided as well as a verbal explanation of the study.\nPrior to obtaining written consent, participants were pro-\nvided with information sheets, reassured that they could\nwithdraw at any time and that data would be anonymous.\nA total of 120 completed Q sorts were returned: 60 from\npatients with CLBP (age range from 23 to 81\nyears, of\nwhich 37 were female) and 60 from healthcare providers\ninvolved in managing individuals with CLBP (age range\nhealthcare providers also had personal experience with\nProcedure\nParticipants received a Q sort pack by post or in person,\nincluding (1) a biographical questionnaire collecting socio-\ndemographic data and information about CLBP care expe-\nrience (to be completed first), (2) a complete set of\ninstructions, (3) the 60-item Q set on numbered laminated\ncards, (4) a Q sort response grid sheet and (5) an open-\nended response booklet inviting written comments on rele-\nvant items and sorting decisions. Each participant initially\ngrouped the items into `agree', `neutral/don't know' and\n`disagree' piles. Participants then sorted these piles in a\nmore fine-grained agree/disagree continuum according to\nthe scale and matrix at the top of the response grid shown in\nParticipants were encouraged to adjust their Q sort until\nit felt representative of their viewpoint. Once completed,\nthe item numbers were recorded in the appropriate boxes of\nthe response grid shown as Figure 1. Participants were then\nasked to provide open-ended comments to explain the\nrationale of their sort, giving particular attention to items\nthat best defined their own position. The Q sort process\nlasted approximately 60minutes.\nResults\nAnalysis\nThe 120 completed Q sorts were entered into SPSS (Version\n20.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) for statistical analysis\nusing principal component analysis and varimax rotation\nwith Kaiser normalisation. In a Q analysis, the loading of\neach Q sort on each extracted factor is expressed as a cor-\nrelation with that factor. In a four-factor solution, all but\nthree of the 120 Q sorts loaded significantly (at the p=0.01\nlevel) onto one of the four factors. This four-factor solution\nwas accepted because (1) each factor had at least two `fac-\ntor exemplar'Q sorts loading significantly on it alone, (2) it\nsatisfied the Kaiser\u00adGuttman criterion which states that all\nextracted factors should have an eigenvalue greater than\nunity (\n>\nfactor offered a clear, distinct and theoretically meaningful\nviewpoint on self-management (see below). For more\ndetails on criteria for factor solutions in Q methodology,\nIn all, 74 Q sorts significantly loaded the first factor\nstudy variance), 21 `exemplars' loaded the second (with an\n4 Health Psychology Open \nFigure 2. Factor array for factor 1.\nStenner et al. 5\nwhile the fourth factor had 8 significantly loading exemplars\ninterpretation, a single `factor exemplifying' Q sort (known\nas a `factor array') was created for each factor using the fac-\ntor scores for each item (Watts and Stenner XXX, 2012).\nEach of the four factor arrays resembles a Q sort completed\nby a participant, but is in fact a `best estimate' of the factor\nderived from data from all the Q sorts conforming to its pat-\ntern (Figure 2 shows the factor array for the first factor, oth-\ners are available on request from the first author (P.S.)).\nFactor interpretations\nInterpretations of the factors draw upon all the ranking\npositions in the factor array and also on the open-ended\ncomments from exemplar participants collected post-Q\nsort. In the interpretations below, these comments are indi-\ncated, where relevant, in italics, with P indicating a person\nwith pain and HP a healthcare provider. Where the ranking\nposition of an item is important to a section of interpreta-\ntion, the relevant item is noted in brackets; hence (14: +6)\nwould indicate that item 14 was ranked in the +6 position in\nthe relevant factor array. Since there were no obvious asso-\nciations between factor loadings and other data collected\n(such as employment status, chronic pain grade, duration of\nCLBP or disability status), these data will not be further\ndiscussed. The summaries below are condensed versions of\nfull interpretations each of which was checked by a factor\nexemplar participant (who confirmed that the summary\nexpresses a faithful version of their viewpoint).\nFactor 1 summary: `I can change' \u00ad a personal\nevolution\nloaded onto the first factor. With 74 exemplars including\nper cent of the service providers, this is very much the\nnormative viewpoint. The main feature of this viewpoint\nwas the idea that successful self-management of CLBP\ninvolves a significant change of `mind-set' (14: +6). This\nchange is a personal evolution: attitude is key. You have to\nget yourself out of the old mind-set (HP08); thinking affects\nwhat we do: it's fundamental (HP14); the mainstay of treat-\nment \u00ad I see this as absolutely vital (HP25); a positive atti-\ntude is crucial for motivation (P10); the only way to\nsuccessfully self-manage is to address negative thoughts\n(P27); really important; power of the mind is great, so need\na positive attitude to have most positive results (P28).\nA changed mind-set equips individuals to live an active\nlife with their pain (1: +5). Their way of thinking influences\nwhat people with pain do and how they feel, and so to move\nforward with self-management it is vital to adopt a positive,\naccepting and mindful attitude. This typically means a\nchange of attitude, since many people find themselves\n`stuck' in a mind-set which can make self-management dif-\nficult (16: +3): as self-management is about changing your\nthinking, searching for a magic bullet is simply tethering\nyourself to your old thinking (HP08). Pain, for example,\ncan easily lead to negative thinking (40: +3). This in turn\ncan lead to feelings of stress and anxiety which can actually\nmake the pain worse (21: +5). Likewise, dwelling on wor-\nries and fears can make managing the pain more difficult\n(18: +4). Wishful thinking can also be a problem. For\nexample, people in pain often quite understandably hope\nthat a simple cure is waiting around the corner. They may\ndevote their energies to a search for a magic bullet which\nmay in fact never appear, and in this way, they can become\n`stuck' in a waiting game, unable to go forward (44: +6):\none of the first steps towards successful self-management is\nto accept there's no magic cure (HP07).\nIn cases where a physical cure is unlikely, it is important\nto accept this and to learn to make the changes that are nec-\nessary to cope with CLBP, and to live with it (45: -6): The\nmagic cure may not exist. `Looking at it'may be ok, but not\nputting your life on hold until you found it (HP12). Managing\npain is therefore much more than a medical matter (51: -6).\nIt is about people understanding and managing their feelings\nand reactions to a life lived with pain, including the ways in\nwhich pain may influence relationships, the ability to work,\nways of moving, self-esteem and sense of identity (20: +3,\n28: +3): the interference of stress and other aspects of men-\ntal health (e.g. depression or anxiety) should not be under-\nestimated! Practice of mindfulness meditation has the\npotential to be extremely beneficial! (HP06); depression and\nanxiety can exacerbate pain (HP10); stress can cause more\npain and sleeplessness which in turn causes muscle to\ntighten (P18); stress can cause pain: mostly common in\nback, neck and shoulder (P19); yes. Fear is a huge barrier.\nWith extensive education, reassurance, appropriate treat-\nment the patient is no longer fearful of their CLBP. They can\nmove forward (HP07).\nHaving the right mind-set will aid this process, and will\nallow individuals to stay in control of their pain rather than\nallowing the pain to control them: this to me is the key to\nself-management. Achieving function and goals despite of\nthe pain (HP48); this is how I describe pain management\nprogrammes to the patients I refer to the course (HP58); I\nthink this is vitally important. If you let pain get a grip over\nyou it is very difficult to overcome (HP55); pain can take on\nits own identity which challenges your identity (HP08); you\nhave to believe you can manage it!! And refuse to let it run\nyour life (P03); it's important to take control and do what\nyou can do (P10); agree with this, about taking some con-\ntrol back in your life (P28); easier said than done but this is\nfundamentally what it is about (P27). Healthcare providers,\nfor their part, can advise on tools and techniques which aid\nthis process, helping to tailor advice and treatment to indi-\nvidual needs (6: +4). Good self-management is about\n6 Health Psychology Open \nprofessionals helping patients to regain control of their\nlives by changing their lives to cope better with their pain\nFactor 2 summary: `Some things can change' \u00ad\npractical action guided by accurate information\nThe Q sorts of 17 people with pain (10 females, age range\nrange 46\u00ad65) defined the second viewpoint in that they\nloaded significantly upon the second factor. Self-\nmanagement of CLBP was perceived to require a pragmatic\napproach: know what works, what hinders, what hurts like\nhell! (P07); simple but true (P15). By carefully observing\nwhat works and what doesn't (23: +6), the patient's life can\nbe organised to maximise their capabilities and minimise\nfuture flare-ups (12: +5). People with pain want to plan and\norganise their lives in accordance with their pain tolerance\nStaying active enables them to `claw back their lives': Pain\ncan worsen due to stiffness caused by inactivity and too\nmuch rest. We were designed to move and you have to keep\nthe spine supple through gentle movement (P48). In order to\nsuccessfully manage the pain, people need a good partner-\nship with healthcare providers and it is helpful to receive a\nthorough physical examination and credible information\nfor instance, can be reassuring: you never know what would\nbe behind the symptom (P12) and medical imaging can add\nconfidence to diagnosis and so adds confidence to patient\n[sic] (P08). Good information and professional advice is\nvital because ill-informed self-management might be harm-\naway with confidence and put the healthcare providers'\nadvice into practice (4: +4). According to this problem-\nbased perspective, the core of CLBP self-management lies\nin a well-informed understanding of the practicalities of\nstaying active (13: +6). This has little or nothing to do with\npsychotherapy or social relationship management (29: -4,\nent life issue from CLBP problems and their solutions: self-\nmanagement is not about self-esteem, [it] is about managing\nthe pain (P31 to item 40); this is not pain management, this\nis relationship management. `In sickness and in health ...'\nFactor 3: `Not sure what to/can change' \u00ad\nmanaging the uncertainty and worried trust in\nhealthcare providers\nThe third viewpoint was defined by the Q sorts of 11 peo-\nhealthcare providers (age range 27\u00ad63). The main focus\nwas on the uncertainty of how to manage the complex\ncharacteristics of CLBP in the context of what is perceived\nas the lack of clarity and understanding coming from ser-\nvice providers (56: +6): often a total lack of understanding\n(P41); too many different conditions that need too many\ndifferent treatments (P20). There is a heavy reliance on the\nhealthcare providers to take an advisory role (52: +3):\npatients need support from health professionals (P20).\nPeople with pain want clarity from healthcare providers\nand they want to be able to trust the advice they get: I do\nthink that the professionals should be well prepared to give\nclear answers and advice to their patients otherwise they\nwill not trust them which makes compliance with self-man-\nagement difficult (P32). They value thorough examina-\npromise an end to anxious uncertainty: yes, it's fear of the\nunknown that hampers how we cope (P41); some practi-\ntioners don't give diagnosis so the patients don't know\nwhat is wrong with them and they go back to pay more\n(P25 to 49). This is not so simple, however, and there is a\nperception that healthcare providers may not give clear\nanswers and that the current health system lacks the kind\nof standardised framework that is needed to give people\ndepartments are too fragmented and isolated from each\nother (P41); `joined up thinking'has to be beneficial \u00ad The\nwhole picture is then considered (P38).\nThe result, from this viewpoint, was a lack of trust in pro-\nfessional advice and a sense of being misunderstood and of\nbeing sent away ill-equipped to self-manage (50: +4): being\ntold to `go away and do this or that'can be difficult to fit into\nyour life (P20). They feel that managing pain is a complex\naffair that cannot be achieved by the patient alone (2: -6):\nhealth professionals should take an active role in self-man-\nagement (HP26). They feel the need for regular contact with\nhealthcare providers, and are reassured when they feel really\ncared for and empathised with (53: +4). They value a strong\n(ongoing) relationship of trust between person with pain and\nhealthcare providers so that help can be accessed as and\nwhen needed. The professionals' advice, however, needs to\nbe easily transferable to people's everyday lives (55: +5).\nOverall, there is a clear concern with trust and mutual under-\nstanding, which are evidently seen to be somewhat lacking:\nhaving faith and trusting health professionals is extremely\nimportant (HP26). This trust is vital given that people with\npain often find their situation difficult to cope with, being `on\nthe edge' of extreme thoughts of crisis (40: +4) and forms of\ndepression provoked by the pain: pain causes depression\nwhich can damage motivation (and the ability to deal) but\nrealising that helps recovery (P20).\nFactor 4: `The others need to change' \u00ad\nquestioning the politics and creating a mutual\nunderstanding of having CLBP\nThe fourth viewpoint was defined by the Q sorts of people\nStenner et al. 7\nwith the third viewpoint, there was a strong feeling that\npain management should not mean coping alone, and strong\nagreement that healthcare providers should be available for\nhuman being who does not rely on anyone. We are social\ncreatures, we cannot live in solitude (P60). Comments from\nparticipants expressed a clear preoccupation with the vital\nimportance of knowing that health professionals are there to\nfollow up how I'm doing well or not (P33), and with the\nsense that this need might be frustrated: it takes months to get\nan appointment (P59), perhaps not possible at current cli-\nmate of NHS (P60). A distinctive feature of this perspective\nwas a concern with how people with pain are portrayed and\ntreated in society (33: -4): at work sometimes I am fine and\nwary that people think I'm lying (P58). Since pain is invisi-\nble, they find that others do not necessarily take it seriously\nor believe them (29: +5): I regularly experienced a culture of\nblame, disbelief and indifference from the medical profession\n(P59). They want to challenge the damaging perception that\nthey are perhaps avoiding work or playing the system (34:\n+2). They also feel the need for expert proof of the validity\nof their pain. Medical imaging, for example, is valued partly\nbecause it can serve to prove the real existence of the pain\n(51: +5). The hope is that this validation might also lead to\nhealthcare treatment that might cure the pain. Searching for\nthis `magic bullet' is not considered a barrier to achieving a\ngood self-management (44: -4). This hope is a `double-\nedged sword', however, since if no obvious physical causes\nare found, this can contribute to the climate of suspicion:\nunfortunately, visual evidence is the only way of fending off\nthe suspicion of `feigning'your pain (P59); It [a scan] helps,\nif anything is shown but augments the doubt towards health\nprofession if nothing is shown (P60).\nThis viewpoint holds that people with pain are entitled to\nhealthcare services in the NHS which should be freely acces-\nsible as and when needed (43: -5). In the context of cuts to\nthese services, it can sometimes feel as though `self-manage-\nment' is a way to save on costs (8: +3, 4: -5): ... `we can't\nhelp anymore so here are some ideas to help you cope' (P24).\nIn this context, it becomes important to insist upon the rights\nof people with pain to treatment and the responsibilities of\nprofessionals to provide care (3: -6). It can be useful from\nthis perspective to form alliances with those in similar posi-\ntions, sharing experiences with other people with pain to get\nThose expressing this viewpoint first of all want their\nCLBP to be acknowledged (48: +4). They feel that self-\nmanagement should not preclude the search for practical\nand effective treatments which cure the problem: Call a\nsniper [healthcare providers] and eliminate the terrorist\n[pain] with a sure shot (P60). They are aware, however,\nthat this search is itself a way of coping with their situation\ncure does come up you don't want to miss it (P24); I don't\nthink it is a barrier, it can also be a goal for someone.\nSearching for latest `cure'can provide means of coping for\nDiscussion\nFour distinct viewpoints on self-management have been\nidentified from 120 completed Q sorts. Each viewpoint is\ncondensed into the pattern of a particular way of sorting the\n60 statements (supported by open-ended comments), and\nthese patterns have been interpreted and reported in qualita-\ntive detail. The first viewpoint is normative in the sense that\nmost of our participants sorted according to this first pat-\ntern, including the vast majority (88%) of the service pro-\nviders and 36per cent of the service users. Having access to\nthis `prototypical' summary should be of significant value\nto future efforts to enhance self-management practice. The\nother viewpoints should not be neglected, however, since\nthey are also coherent and feature aspects either peripheral\nto, or rejected by, the first viewpoint.\nTwo cross-cutting themes\nHaving these `snapshots' of four distinct speaking posi-\ntions provides a useful basis for exploring the evident\nscope both for agreement and tensions among self-man-\nagement stakeholders. It is therefore of value to use this\ndiscussion section to bring out the key points of difference\nand similarity between the four viewpoints. The identifica-\ntion of points of difference which are sources of potential\nmisunderstanding and even conflict is particularly valua-\nble. Two themes can be identified which cut across the four\nviewpoints. These serve to highlight the key points of dif-\nference and similarity between the viewpoints, thus point-\ning to sources of potential misunderstanding which might\ninterfere with self-management.\nFirst theme: changing the self/resisting self-change.Consistent\nwith previous findings (Eccleston et al., 1997; Martin et al.,\n2014), the relevance of what might be called the psychologi-\ncal dimension proves to be a key point of difference. How-\never, while it is clear that explanations that invoke\n`psychology' can be controversial, it is important not to\nassume a shared understanding of the meaning of `psychol-\nogy' since this notion appears to take on different signifi-\ncance from different viewpoints. The first factor places great\nimportance on the need to change `mind-set'and `attitudes'.\nThis emphasis on mode of thought, however, ought not to be\ntaken as indicating a set of psychological processes which\nexist in abstraction from the rest of the world. On the con-\ntrary, if `mind-set' is important to this viewpoint, this is\nbecause it is tightly connected to action, to feeling and hence\nto physical wellbeing: thinking affects what we do: it's fun-\ndamental (HP14). This explains the strong agreement with\nitem 14 when compared to its ranking from the other three\nviewpoints, as indicated below:\n8 Health Psychology Open \nThe wording of this item is significant, since it does not\nsuggest that `changing how you think' is more important\nthan `changing what you do', but as important. The prag-\nmatic focus of factor 2, by contrast, is concerned with\nchanging what one does and not what one is. From this per-\nspective, psychological themes of self-esteem or of manag-\ning negative feelings are actively rejected as issues not to\nbe confused with self-management:\nis as much about\nchanging how you\nthink as it is about\nchanging what you do\nmanagement it is\nimportant to avoid\nextreme thoughts\nlike `if I cannot\nself-manage then\nmy whole world will\ncollapse'\n28. Managing pain is\nalso about managing\nthe strain it puts your\nrelationships under:\nwho wants to move\nfrom being a friend\nor partner to being a\nnurse or housekeeper?\n18. Managing CLBP is\novercoming the fear of\ndoing something that will\nmake it flare up or get\nworse\n44. Searching for the\nmagic cure for CLBP\nor the `silver bullet' is a\nbarrier to achieving self-\nmanagement\nDespite this clear difference, it is interesting that feel-\nings are welcomed as relevant by factor 2 in the much more\npractically relevant setting of overcoming fear of flare-ups\nwhich might hinder concrete activity:\nA closely related dimension concerns the different\nmeanings given to the `physicality' associated with the\nsearch for underlying bio-medical factors explanatory of\nthe pain. The different perspectives on this dimension are\nstarkly illustrated by the rankings of item 44:\nIn short, a key part of the factor 1 project of `self-\nchange' is changing the (understandable) desire for a sim-\nple cure and accepting the need for ongoing\nself-management in the absence of a cure. Consistent with\ntheir stance on `the psychological', factor 2 exemplars are\nunwilling to take this step of self-change prior to the avail-\nability of clear medical evidence, indicating the lack of a\nphysical cause and possible cure: no. If I find the magic\ncure then this too will help improve my circumstances\n(HP01)); not in my experience. My silver bullets \u00ad\nAlexander Technique, massage, ... physiotherapy exer-\ncises (P08); searching is fine till you get to #48 [thorough\nexamination] + #49 [given a diagnosis].\nSecond theme: independence/isolation versus dependence/right\nto care. Factors 1 and 2 are broadly `in line' with an agenda\nof self-management, with factor 2 taking a more narrowly\nfocussed pragmatic position on the practicalities of how to\ndo it (informed by expert knowledge). Both perspectives see\nthat change is needed, but for factor 1, that change involves\na more deep-seated change in mind-set rather than the\nadjustment of conduct that is the central concern of factor 2.\nFactors 3 and 4 are more complex in this respect. Factor 3\nvoices a profound uncertainty about how to proceed and\nabout what can be changed, along with a critical sense of\ndisappointment with the input of healthcare providers (who\nthey both need to trust and fail to trust). Factor 4 voices a\nbroader set of concerns. It is the societal perception and\ntreatment of individuals with CLBP by others which needs\nto be changed, and this is sometimes associated with a cost-\ncutting governmental agenda which violates healthcare\nrights. The viewpoint of factor 3 is `irritated', as it were,\nwith a sense of misunderstanding, mistrust and even aban-\ndonment, while that of factor 4 is irritated by a sense of\ninjustice and unfairness.\nBoth of these perspectives (factors 3 and 4) strongly\nresist the implication that self-management should mean\nthe withdrawal of professional healthcare. This means\nthat what might be seen positively as `independence' from\nthe perspectives of factors 1 and 2 shows up negatively as\n`isolation' and even as the threat of `abandonment' for\nfactors 3 and 4. Symmetrically, what might be seen nega-\ntively as `dependence on healthcare providers' from the\nperspectives of factors 1 and 2 shows up as claiming a\n`right to health-care' and being `properly treated' for fac-\ntors 3 and 4. These critical attitudes make it likely that,\ndespite being relatively minoritarian (at least in the con-\ntext of the present study), the perspectives of factors 3 and\n4 are likely to be loudly and resiliently voiced, and hence\nto constitute a significant part of the debate and practice\naround self-management. This theme of `independence/\nisolation' is brought out starkly in the following compara-\ntive rankings:\nStenner et al. 9\n2. Successful self-\nmanagement means\ncoping on your own and\nnot having to rely on\nhealth professionals\ninvolves knowing when\nto ask for professional\nhelp\n53. Seeing a healthcare\nprofessional to touch\nbase from time to time\ncan be a big help to\nthose self-managing\nCLBP\nis easier if you have a\ndiagnosis because that\nlets you give a proper\nname to your enemy.\nmanaging in a\nconfident way it is\nimportant to have a\nthorough physical\nexamination.\n(x-ray, MRI) helps\nvisually validate the\npain.\nIn this context, the wish for diagnoses, scans and physical\nexaminations is associated with the sense of a right to treat-\nment and the need to prove the reality of the pain to sceptics:\nDespite the similarities noted above, factors 3 and 4 are\ndistinct in that factor 3 tends to be critical of healthcare\nprofessionals, while factor 4 is more preoccupied with neg-\native societal perceptions of people with pain.\nThese four factors (and two themes) provide a more\nnuanced appreciation of what, in certain circumstances, can\nbecome a `communication chasm' (Kenny, 2004) between\npeople with pain and healthcare providers. The findings\nsuggest that the social object of CLBP self-management is\nunderstood in distinctive ways from these four perspectives,\nand that key differences in meaning emerge around (1) the\nsignificance of implicating the psychological dimension and\n(2) of themes connoting independence and autonomy versus\nisolation and abandonment. Clear communication is likely\nto be challenged by the fact that each perspective assumes a\nvery different construction of these issues, and that \u00ad espe-\ncially for factors 3 and 4 \u00ad these constructions carry differ-\nent ethical implications concerning the sense of justice,\nrights and obligations. Such obstacles to communication are\nlikely to play a key role in the low uptake of psychologically\nbased rehabilitation programmes despite evidence for their\neffectiveness. As Martin et al. (2014) suggest, if self-man-\nagement is to be effective, there must be more consistent\ninvestment in explaining pain, especially since the anxiety\ncreated by unexplained symptoms can compound the symp-\ntoms. The present findings also suggest that the notion of a\n`communication chasm' can be overstated (Salmon et al.,\n2004), since the majority of our participants with pain\nvoiced views in line with current policy and in agreement\nwith the majority of our healthcare providers.\nThis study is limited, however, in that it can only pro-\nvide a static `snapshot'of the range of viewpoints expressed\nusing this item set by a strategically sampled but self-\nselected group of participants. Regarding the latter point, it\nis possible that those most sceptical about CLBP self-\nmanagement opted out of participation, and this possibility\nshould be followed up in future work. We would thus not\nclaim that the debate on CLBP self-management is limited\nto the four viewpoints explicated in this study. Regarding\nthe former point, future research should investigate whether\nand how these `snapshots' relate to and play out in concrete\nreal-time (i.e. temporally unfolding) communicative prac-\ntices. The authors have made a start on this by inviting fac-\ntor exemplars to participate in a Knowledge Translation\nConference designed to facilitate the recognition of multi-\nple perspectives on the part of CLBP service providers and\nservice users. Although a formal analysis of this event\nremains work-in-progress, it is clear that during real-time\ncommunication (e.g. between a service provider identified\nwith factor 1 and a person with pain identified with factor\n3), the viewpoints informing discursive contributions are\nmore fluid and variable. Nevertheless, points of difference\nand tension emerged at the junctures suggested above that\nwere discernable only thanks to the `crystallisations' pro-\nvided by the four factors. It is thus important to avoid reify-\ning the four viewpoints if the findings are to be of practical\nvalue as a guide for understanding the realities of actual\ncommunicative practice (including the practice of self-\nmanagement). Embedded in this appropriate theoretical\ncontext (Stenner, 2015), the findings enhance our knowl-\nedge of the viewpoints at play and provide a basis for\nimproving self-management and behaviour change, as well\nas professional and patient training. The four factors, for\nexample, provide a focus for reflexive conversation and\npractice, within and between service users and providers,\naimed at increasing the confidence of people with pain in\ntheir ability to self-manage. They provide a basis for a more\nnuanced and tailored approach to self-management that\nrecognises that different modes of engagement with it are\ngrounded in qualitatively distinct modes of understanding\n(Hibbard et al., 2009). Enhanced self-management could\nreduce the impact of persisting problems or recurrences\nwhile lessening the burden on healthcare providers by\nreducing the number of treatments needed.\n10 Health Psychology Open \nConclusion\nThe study provides valuable insight into the diversity of\nstakeholder viewpoints on self-management. The first and\nlargest viewpoint might be taken as the normative proto-\ntype of self-management practice. The other viewpoints\n(predominantly voiced by people with pain) articulate\neither neglected concerns for future consideration, or points\nof potential tension between different taken-for-granted\nviewpoints. Tensions include the orientation towards the\npsychological dimension, the significance of autonomy and\nindependence with respect to responsibility for self-man-\nagement, the attitude towards possible cure and the role\nand nature of healthcare provider input in a challenging\neconomic context. In drawing attention to these differ-\nences and tensions, the study provides an informed basis,\nnot just for the collaborative development of particular self-\nmanagement strategies but also for the articulation of an\nexplicit and consensually agreed conceptualisation of self-\nmanagement. The absence of such a conceptualisation is\nlikely to prove an obstacle to the effective coordination of\nthe activities of stakeholders in CLBP self-management.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The\nresearch reported here was funded by a grant from the Research\nfor Patient Benefit Programme of the UK National Institute for\nof self-care in chronic low-back disorder from the perspective of\npractitioners and patients: a Q methodological study.\nReferences\nAiraksinenO,BroxJI,CedraschiC,etal.(2006)Chapter4:European\nguidelines for the management of chronic non-specific low\nAudulv A (2013) The over time development of chronic illness\nself-management patterns: A longitudinal qualitative study.\nBriggs AM, Slater H, Bunzli S, et al.
