Previous research suggests that assets matter,\nbut the size and direction of the effect varies. An important is-\nsue regarding the role of assets has not been explored ade-\nquately--whether the effect of assets differs between less\nwealthy and very wealthy individuals. A methodology to con-\ntrol for this type of variation is employed in this analysis. Re-\nsults suggest that increases in assets have the greatest\ninfluence on the probability that less wealthy individuals own\nlong-term care insurance, and have a negligible impact on the\nwealthy. This has important implications for policies designed\nto increase long-term care insurance ownership.\nKey Words: Nursing home care, Public\u00adprivate partnerships\nThe combined cost of nursing home care and\nhome health care in the United States was more than\ndividuals accounted for about one third of this figure,\ngovernment expenditures contributed about 59%\nand third-party payments by private insurance cov-\nered just 7% (Health Care Financing Administration,\n2000). The small contribution from private insurance\nis not unexpected, as only 4% to 5% of elderly peo-\nple are thought to have insurance policies that cover\nlong-term care (Cohen, Kumar, McGuire, & Wallack,\ncies aimed at reducing the public portion of long-\nterm care costs focus on expanding private insur-\nance. For example, four U.S. states--California, Con-\nnecticut, Indiana, New York--are experimenting\nwith a program that allows individuals who buy a\ngiven amount of private insurance coverage to pro-\ntect their assets even if their long-term care costs ex-\nceed what is covered by the insurance. Called \"pub-\nlic\u00adprivate partnerships\" for long-term care, these\nplans are designed to encourage individuals to buy a\nmoderate amount of private coverage by providing a\nform of guaranteed asset protection.\nPolicies focusing on increasing private insurance\ncoverage generally raise the question of which fac-\ntors influence the decision to purchase this insurance\n(see Appendix, Note 1). In the case of public\u00adprivate\npartnerships for long-term care the question is, more\nspecifically, what role does asset protection play in\nthe purchase of insurance? While a motive such as\nasset protection is difficult to measure, it can be ob-\nserved in part by quantifying the relationship be-\ntween actual assets and insurance ownership. This\nstudy examined the role of assets in the decision to\npurchase insurance for long-term care using data\nfrom the study of Asset and Health Dynamics Among\nthe Oldest Old (AHEAD; Myers, 1997). (See Myers\n1997 for a description of the survey and initial re-\nsearch findings). The next section details the impor-\ntance of examining the role of assets from a policy\nperspective. In addition, the quantitative evidence\nreported in previous literature regarding the role of\nassets is reviewed. Existing studies have produced\nmixed results, most suggesting that assets matter but\nshowing that the size and direction of the effect var-\nies. An important issue regarding the role of assets--\nwhether the effect of assets differs for those with high\nwealth as compared to low wealth--has not been ex-\nplored adequately.\nA methodology to control for this important type\nof variation was employed in this analysis. The re-\nsults lead to quite different conclusions than reported\nelsewhere regarding the role of assets in the purchase\nof long-term care insurance. That is, assets matter\nmost for those in the lowest fourth of the asset distri-\nbution and least for those in the upper fourth of distri-\nbution. Finally, this research examined whether the\nrole of assets is linked to asset protection for heirs, by\nexamining how long-term care insurance ownership\nis related to expectations about financial transfers to\nfamily members. The analysis reported here does not\nsupport the view that long-term care insurance pur-\nchase is motivated by a desire to protect assets for\nheirs.\nBackground\nSeveral policy initiatives are aimed at increasing\nprivate insurance coverage for long-term care. Re-\ncent changes in federal tax laws allow individuals to\ndeduct part of the cost of long-term care insurance\nThe author thanks the National Institute on Aging for research support\nhelpful comments.\n1Address correspondence to Jennifer M.

At the state level,\nfour states have implemented \"public\u00adprivate part-\nnerships\" for long-term care that encourage individu-\nals to purchase partial private insurance coverage for\nlong-term care. If private coverage fails to provide for\nall of their long-term care needs, these individuals\ncan become eligible for Medicaid coverage of long-\nterm care without having to spend down their assets\n(not including their home) to the typical eligibility\nthreshold of $2,000. For example, an individual with\nprivate insurance coverage for $50,000 in long-term\ncare costs can retain $50,000 of his or her assets and\nbecome eligible for Medicaid when the private insur-\nance coverage runs out. This is referred to as a \"dol-\nlar-for-dollar\" plan, where every dollar of private in-\nsurance coverage protects one dollar of assets. Three\nstates (Connecticut, Indiana, and California) have im-\nplemented dollar-for-dollar partnerships; a fourth\nstate, New York, has implemented a partnership pro-\ngram that offers protection of all assets with the pur-\nchase of limited private insurance coverage.\nVarious criticisms have been directed toward the\npublic\u00adprivate partnerships since their inception and\nimplementation in the 1990s. Some dispute the cost-\neffectiveness of the partnerships and believe that\nthese programs may in fact raise the overall amount\nof long-term care spending by Medicaid. Another\nconcern is that the public will not be interested in\nparticipating in this type of program, owing to fears\nof reduced access and lower quality of care, and the\npossible \"welfare stigma\" associated with Medicaid.\nAdditional criticisms of the public\u00adprivate partner-\nship programs concern the relevance of asset protec-\ntion in purchasing long-term care insurance. Wiener\nand Hanley (1992) argue that asset protection is a rel-\natively unimportant reason for buying long-term care\ninsurance, and that increased asset protection oppor-\ntunities will not induce a large number of individuals\nto purchase new policies. They cite evidence from a\nsurvey of long-term care insurance policyholders\nsuggesting that only 14% of the sample respondents\nlisted protection of assets as the \"most important\"\nreason for buying insurance. Wiener and Hanley also\nquestion the use of Medicaid to protect the assets of\nmiddle and upper income elderly people. Finally,\nWiener and colleagues (1994) write that \"back-end\ncoverage provides asset protection for heirs--argu-\nably a less appropriate role for government\" (p.144;\nsee Note 2).\nResearch Question\nEvidence that only 14% of purchasers report asset\nprotection as the primary reason for buying long-term\ncare insurance is not enough to support the conclu-\nsion that assets are an unimportant factor. This statis-\ntic does not reflect the relative contribution of other\nfactors in the purchase of long-term care insurance,\nnor does it take into account the factors that lead an\nindividual to choose not to purchase the insurance.\nFor this reason, several studies have used multivari-\nate models of long-term care insurance purchase to\nestimate the effect of assets, controlling for other indi-\nvidual characteristics such as income, age, and\nhealth status. This research expands upon these types\nof studies by examining whether the effect of assets\ndiffers among individuals with different levels of\nwealth. As stated in the background section, there is\nsome concern about whether partnership programs\nuse Medicaid to protect the assets of the middle and\nupper classes. To explore this concern, it is necessary\nto determine how the effect of assets in the decision\nto purchase insurance varies across different asset\ngroups. For example, among individuals with very\nlow levels of assets (who thus have little to protect\nfrom Medicaid), assets may have less of an influence\non long-term care insurance decisions. Those with\nassets over a certain minimum amount may have the\ngreatest incentive to protect assets from the spend-\ndown process associated with qualifying for Medic-\naid. And, among very wealthy individuals, assets\nmay have a small effect on insurance purchase.\nThose with the most wealth may elect to self-insure--\nthat is, to use their savings to finance long-term care\nneeds and forego the purchase of insurance policies.\nThese potential nonlinearities in the asset\u00adinsurance\nrelationship can suggest whether asset protection\nplays more or less of a role for the wealthy, com-\npared to the poor. The results reported here can thus\nshed light on whether policy makers need to be con-\ncerned about using liberalized Medicaid eligibility\n(via the partnerships) to protect the assets of wealthy\nelders.\nPrevious Research\nTo date, only a few quantitative studies have ex-\namined the role of assets in long-term care insurance\nownership. Sloan and Norton (1997) used the\nAHEAD study and the Health and Retirement Survey\nto examine many factors linked to ownership of long-\nterm care insurance, such as adverse selection, be-\nquests, and crowding out by the Medicaid program,\nin addition to income and assets. Their results suggest\nthat the level of nonhousing assets has a significant\npositive effect on the probability of having long-term\ncare insurance. However, the size of the effect was\ncrease in the probability of having insurance, from\nassets in the form of housing and found them to have\nno effect on long-term care insurance coverage. This\nfinding may be explained by the fact that Medicaid\neligibility is determined by the level of assets exclud-\ning the value of the individual's home. As a result,\nhousing wealth is protected from the spend-down\nprocess.\nIf the relationship between assets and insurance\npurchase is nonlinear, then the linear specification\nused by Sloan and Norton may to some degree un-\nderstate the true effect of assets in the decision to pur-\nchase insurance. Two other quantitative research\nstudies attempt to control for nonlinearities in the re-\nlationship between assets and long-term care insur-\nance ownership, but with opposite results. These\nstudies are described below.\nKumar, Cohen, Bishop, and Wallack (1995) used\ndata obtained from several insurance companies on\nindividuals who owned long-term care insurance\npolicies and individuals who declined to purchase\nsuch policies when approached by insurance agents.\nA logistic regression of the purchase decision was\nperformed, controlling for demographic and socio-\neconomic characteristics, attitudes, and Medicaid\ncharacteristics. Assets were measured with categori-\ncal dummy variables, which allowed for variation in\nthe magnitude of asset effects. Relative to the omitted\ndummies had significant and positive effects: assets\nresults support the conclusion that those with assets\nance relative to those with higher levels of assets.\nUnfortunately, these results may not be generalizable\nto the population as a whole because those ap-\nproached by insurance agents are a nonrandom sam-\nple of the population. Individuals approached by\nagents are more likely to have higher incomes and to\nbe in better health than most elderly individuals.\nIn McCall, Mangle, Bauer, and Knickman (1998),\ndata for a random sample of partnership program\nparticipants (merged with nonparticipants) were used\nto examine the factors associated with the purchase\nof long-term care insurance through the partnerships.\nThe authors controlled for a variety of respondent\ncharacteristics in a logistic regression of insurance\npurchase. Assets levels were measured by three\nOdds ratios for the asset dummy variables were sta-\ntistically significant and suggest that having assets\ning insurance. The largest effect was for assets be-\npositive but is smaller in size than the effect of having\nwith results regarding the effect of income on long-\nterm care insurance ownership, the authors interpret\nthis finding as evidence \"that the Partnership is hav-\ning its desired effect of attracting middle-income and\nresults are in contrast to Kumar and colleagues' find-\nings, but the study has some significant differences in\nthe sampling. The full sample included an oversam-\nple of purchasers, who made up as much as 58% of\nall observations. In addition, 38% of the observations\nin the McCall and colleagues' sample have missing\ndata for assets (see Note 3).\nIn summary, previous research on the relationship\nbetween assets and long-term care insurance pro-\nduces mixed results. Evidence from Sloan and\nNorton (1997) shows that assets have a small positive\neffect on the likelihood of having long-term care in-\nsurance. Other research that addresses the nonlinear-\nity in the asset and insurance relationship produces\ncontrasting results. In one case, assets less than the\npositive; in another case, assets greater than the omit-\nThis difference may be driven by the use of different\nsamples, but in both cases the samples used are non-\nrandom.\nMethods\nThis research adds to the existing literature on the\neffect of assets in the decision to purchase long-term\ncare insurance by using several methods to address\nthe nonlinearity in this relationship. The data that are\nused in this study are similar to those used by Sloan\nand Norton (1997); the methods of estimation differ\nfrom their linear specification, and from other studies\nthat rely solely on categorical dummies for asset lev-\nels. The primary method of analysis in this research is\nthe estimation of a probit model of long-term care in-\nsurance where a spline function is used in the estima-\ntion of asset effects. The spline function allows for the\nestimation of asset affects at varying ranges, and is\nequivalent to estimating the model in several sub-\nsamples based on asset levels, and then using restric-\ntions to \"tie\" the coefficients at the \"knots\" (break-\npoints or cutoffs in assets) in the sample (see Note 4).\nThe knots can be chosen at various levels; some stud-\nies suggest breaking the sample into groups of equal\nnumbers of observations or groups of equal ranges in\nthe explanatory variable. In this case, the knots are\nfirst set at the quartiles in the asset distribution for the\nsample; several other options are also reported.\nData from Wave 1 of the AHEAD study (Public Re-\nlease Version 2.10) are used in the analysis. AHEAD\nis a nationally representative longitudinal study of\nThe survey contains a wide variety of information on\nhealth conditions, insurance coverage, family com-\nposition, and financial resources for 8,222 individu-\nals in 6,047 households. Variable definitions and\nmeans are reported in Table 1 for a sample of 8,121\nrespondents from the AHEAD survey with nonmiss-\ning data. All respondents in the AHEAD survey were\nasked whether or not they owned an insurance pol-\nicy for long-term care. Of those who answered this\nquestion, 2.3% reported that they had a long-term\ncare insurance policy (see Note 5). Nonhousing as-\nsets are defined as the sum of financial assets less\ndebt (see Note 6). The mean of nonhousing assets in\nthe insured than the uninsured, as data in columns 2\nand 3 suggest. Those with insurance have nonhous-\ning assets at twice the level of those without insur-\nance.\nIn addition to age and nonhousing assets, covari-\nates included in the probit model are education,\nrace, marital status, health status, income, housing\nequity, and dummies for urban residence and region\nof residence. Education is measured in years and has\na mean of 10.8. Race is measured with an indicator\nvariable, non-White; about 15% of respondents are\nnon-White. More than half of the individuals in the\nsample are married, and 63% are women. Health sta-\ntus is measured by an indicator variable equal to one\nif the respondent's self-reported health status is listed\nas poor on a scale ranging from poor to excellent.\nAdditional measures of health status include whether\nthe respondent reported difficulties in any of six\nADLs (activities of daily living) or five IADLs (instru-\nmental activities of daily living). Poor health status\nand 30% of respondents reported difficulties with at\nleast one ADL and IADL, respectively. Average\ndiscussion of the expected relationships between\nthese covariates and long-term care insurance, see\nResults\nIn Table 2, results from probit models of the proba-\nbility of owning a long-term care insurance policy\nare reported. Marginal effects and t statistics are re-\nported; standard errors of all estimates are adjusted\nfor the use of multiple observations per household\n(see Note 7). For simplicity, the term \"assets\" will be\nused to reference nonhousing assets, and \"housing\nequity\" will be used to refer to the net value of the\nhome. The first column of Table 2 reports the results\nusing a linear specification in assets similar to Sloan\nand Norton's (1997) study. The estimated effect of a\n$10,000 increase in assets on the probability of hav-\ning a long-term care insurance policy is an increase\nof 0.0001 percentage points over the baseline proba-\nlinear and squared values for assets are included to\naccount for nonlinearities in the relationship between\nassets and insurance. The marginal effect for assets\ndoubles in size, and the squared term has a negative\ncoefficient. This suggests that although assets increase\nthe probability of having long-term care insurance, the\neffect decreases as assets increase (see Note 8).\nThe third column reports results from a probit\nmodel where assets are measured with three categor-\nical dummy variables. Instead of the typical defini-\ntion and interpretation of each dummy relative to one\nomitted category of assets, these dummies are formu-\nlated to reveal differences in the effect of assets rela-\ntive to the previous asset category. Here, the catego-\nries are defined as quartiles in the asset distribution.\nThe first variable is equal to one if assets exceed the\nfirst quartile in the distribution; the second is equal to\none if assets exceed the second quartile; the third\nequals one if assets exceed the third quartile (see\nNote 9). For example, a person with assets at the 70th\npercentile in the distribution will have a value of 1\nfor the first two dummies, and a 0 for the third. A re-\nspondent with assets at the 90th percentile will have\na value of 1 for all three dummies. The results from\nthis specification also reveal a nonlinear relationship\nbetween assets and insurance. The effect of having\nassets in successive quartiles has a positive effect on\ninsurance, but the marginal impact becomes very\nsmall and is statistically insignificant at higher levels\nof assets.\nThe fourth column of Table 2 reports results from\nthe preferred specification of a probit model with a\nspline function in assets, where the knots of the\nspline are based on the quartiles. This specification\nagain suggests that the marginal effect of assets be-\ncomes smaller at higher ranges in the asset distribu-\ntion. For example, a $10,000 increase in assets leads\nTable 1.

The difference\nsuggests that the same absolute increase in assets has\na smaller effect for the wealthy than the poor, but this\nmay be expected because (in relative terms) the effect\nof an extra $10,000 is much smaller for those with\nthe most assets. (A likelihood ratio test of the linear\nTable 2.

The reported t statistics (in pa-\nrentheses) are for the hypothesis test of the underlying coefficient being equal to zero. The sample contains 8,021 observations. The mean\nmodel versus the spline model rejects the linear\nmodel in favor of the spline model.) To compare the\nsize of relative increases in assets, Table 3 reports\nsimulated effects of a 10% increase in assets (from\nthe mean in each quartile) on the percentage in-\ncrease in the probability of having long-term care in-\nsurance.\nThe first three columns of Table 3 report (1) the\nmarginal effect from the probit model with a spline in\nassets, (2) the mean level of assets, (3) the mean prob-\nability of owning long-term care insurance, in each\nquartile. The fourth column calculates the effect of a\n10% increase in assets in each range; the fifth col-\numn expresses that effect in terms of percentage in-\ncreases in the probability of having long-term care in-\nsurance. As reported here, the same 10% increase in\nassets has the largest effect for those in the bottom\nfourth of the distribution where the probability of\nhaving long-term care insurance increases by 10%.\nAt the next quartile, the effect of assets is insignifi-\ncant, and small. In the third quartile (assets ranging from\nassets is a 2.1% increase in the probability of long-term\ncare insurance. Among those in the top fourth of\nthe distribution, the effect is again small--0.4%--and\nbased on a statistically insignificant coefficient.\nTo test the sensitivity of these results to the chosen\nknots in the spline function, Table 3 also reports re-\nsults from two additional specifications. In Model 2,\nthe knots are chosen at the 50th and 90th percentiles\n(see Note 10). Because only six individuals in the\nbottom 4th of the asset distribution had long-term\ncare insurance, this specification combines the bot-\ntom two fourths of the distribution. The use of a knot\nat the 90th percentile tests the effect of assets among\nthe top 10% of the asset distribution. A similar pat-\ntern appears in these results: For those in the bottom\nhalf of the distribution, assets have the strongest ef-\nfect, and for those at the very top of the distribution,\nassets have the smallest effect. In Model 3, the obser-\nvations are divided into three groups based on the\n33rd and 66th percentiles of assets. Here, the effect\nof a 10% increase in assets on the probability of hav-\ning insurance is 1.4% for the bottom third and some-\nwhat higher at 1.8% for the middle third. Again, the\neffect is smallest (0.5%) for the highest asset range.\nTo test the magnitude of these asset effects relative\nto other factors influencing long-term care insurance\nownership, the effects of 10% increases in household\nincome and education were calculated from the mar-\nginal effects reported in Table 2, using changes from\nmean values of income and education. The effect of\nincrease in the probability of having insurance; the\neffect of a 10% increase in education ranges from\nwhile large in some ranges, are generally smaller\nthan the effects of income and education.\nTable 3.

Or, the relationship\nmay be observed because individuals with more\nwealth have stronger preferences for insurance. One\nway to distinguish between these two explanations is\nto examine the difference in the effect of nonhousing\nassets compared to housing assets. Results reported\nin Table 2 show that \"protected assets,\" that is, assets\nin the form of housing equity that are protected from\nthe Medicaid spend-down process, do not have a sig-\nnificant effect on long-term care insurance. Because\nassets unprotected from the Medicaid spend-down\nprocess appear to matter in the long-term care insur-\nance decision and protected assets do not, these re-\nsults are consistent with evidence of asset protection.\nThat is, asset protection cannot be ruled out based on\nthese tests, although asset protection may not be the\nonly explanation consistent with these findings. Non-\nhousing assets differ from housing assets in terms of\ndetermining Medicaid eligibility, and they also differ\nin terms of liquidity. Thus, these results do not offer\nexclusive support for the relevance of asset protec-\ntion.\nAnother test of asset protection is whether asset ef-\nfects are significantly different for those with heirs,\nsuch as children or spouses, compared to individuals\nwithout children or spouses. To test this, two series of\ninteraction terms were added to the model specifica-\ntion shown in Table 2, column 3. The first set of three\ninteraction terms is calculated by multiplying each of\nthe asset dummy variables by a dummy variable\nequal to one if the respondent has any children; the\nsecond set is calculated by multiplying the asset\ndummies by a dummy variable equal to one if the re-\nspondent is married. In separate models not reported\nhere, the null hypotheses that either set of interaction\nterms was jointly equal zero cannot be rejected.\nThese results do not suggest any difference in the ef-\nfect of assets for those with heirs in the form of chil-\ndren or a spouse and those without.\nFinally, an asset protection motive for purchasing\nlong-term care insurance may be apparent through\nthe relationship between long-term care insurance\nownership and the respondents' expectations about\nevents such as leaving an inheritance or lending fi-\nnancial support to a relative. Table 4 shows the ef-\nfects of four variables reflecting expectations about:\n(1) providing financial help to family members; (2)\nleaving an inheritance; (3) living in a nursing home\nyears. The first two variables serve as proxy measures\nfor the individual's desire to protect assets for heirs\n(see Note 11). The information from the latter two\nvariables is used to identify those individuals who ex-\npect to enter a nursing home in 5 years, and those\nwho expect to live more than a decade from the in-\nterview. Finally, a dummy variable is set equal to one\nfor individuals who expect more than a 50% proba-\nbility of entering a nursing home in 5 years and more\nthan a 50% probability of living an additional 10 to\n15 years. As the average nursing home stay is 29\nmonths (Gabrel & Jones, 2000), this variable may\ncapture expectations of returning home after a nurs-\ning home stay and also reflect an individual's motiva-\ntion to protect assets for his or her own future use.\nIn the first column, the relationships between\nlong-term care insurance and all four expectation\nvariables are examined. The only significant relation-\nship is found with nursing home expectations. Those\nwho have higher expectations of a nursing home stay\nare more likely to have long-term care insurance.\nThis should be interpreted with some caution, as hav-\ning insurance may increase the individual's expecta-\ntions about staying in a nursing home. In a model in-\ncluding only the financial transfer variables, neither\nexpectations of providing financial help nor expecta-\ntions of providing an inheritance has a significant re-\nlationship with long-term care insurance. Finally, in\nTable 4. The Relationship Between Expectations and Long-Term Care Insurance\nVariable Name Explanatory Variables Model 1 Model 2 Model 3\nFinancial help Expected probability of providing financial\nhelp to family members in next 10 years\nNursing home Expected probability of entering a nursing home within 5 years 0.0003**\nHigh nursing\nhome expectations\nExpects at least a 50% probability of entering a nursing home 0.012*\nHigh expectations of\nReturn High Nursing Home Expectations \nHigh Expectations of Living 10 years\nNotes: All models include the following explanatory variables: income, income squared, age, age squared, housing equity, housing\nequity squared, education, female, married, number of children, non-White, poor health, and whether the respondent has difficulty with\nany activity of daily living (ADL) or instrumental ADL, and dummies for residence in a metropolitan statistical area and by region.\nthe last column, where a variable is used to identify\nthose likely to have expectations of returning home\nafter a nursing home stay, there is no significant rela-\ntionship between this expectation and owning long-\nterm care insurance. This analysis does not support\neither motivation for protecting assets, whether pro-\ntection be for the benefit of heirs, or for the benefit of\nan individual who expects to have a nursing home\nstay in the next 5 years and live more than 10 years.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study differ substantially from pre-\nvious research that has examined the relationship be-\ntween assets and long-term care insurance ownership.\nPrevious research has either specified a linear relation-\nship between insurance and assets, or used categorical\ndummies to produce mixed results regarding the direc-\ntion of the asset effect. One study (McCall et al., 1998)\nsuggests that the probability of having insurance in-\ncreases with wealth, another (Kumar et al., 1995) sug-\ngests that it decreases with wealth. In this article, sev-\neral model specifications, including the use of a spline\nfunction in assets, suggest that the effect of assets is to\nincrease the probability of owning long-term care in-\nsurance at all levels, but that the effect dampens as as-\nsets increase. A difference in the role of assets for those\nwith low wealth compared to those with high values\nof wealth was consistently shown in several models.\nThose with the highest levels of wealth are least influ-\nenced by assets in the decision to purchase long-term\ncare insurance.\nIn addition, the estimated effect of assets that are\nunprotected from the Medicaid spend-down process\n(financial assets such as checking, savings, IRA ac-\ncounts, and certificates of deposit) contrasts with the\neffect of \"protected\" assets measured as the value of\nhousing equity. While unprotected assets have a siz-\nable effect on long-term care insurance ownership,\nprotected assets have no significant effect. This pat-\ntern is consistent with the motive of asset protection.\nHowever, there is little evidence to support the view\nthat long-term care insurance is a form of asset pro-\ntection for heirs. In contrast, the only significant rela-\ntionship between long-term care insurance and ex-\npectations existed among those who had high\nexpectations of a nursing home stay. One explana-\ntion that is consistent with these results is that indi-\nviduals protect assets in order to pay for additional\nexpenses while they are in a nursing home.\nThese results speak directly to two concerns re-\ngarding the public\u00adprivate partnership program for\nlong-term care. First, it appears that those most influ-\nenced by assets in the purchase of long-term care in-\nsurance are those with lower levels of assets, and not\nthe very wealthy. This suggests that the concern by\nsome that the partnerships program creates liberal-\nized Medicaid eligibility to protect the assets of the\nwealthy is not warranted. Those most influenced to\nprotect assets are those with low or middle levels of\nassets. Second, because assets matter, one cannot\nrule out asset protection as a motive for purchasing\nlong-term care insurance; however, the effect of as-\nsets on insurance is no stronger when heirs are\npresent than not. Long-term care insurance is not as-\nsociated with having expectations regarding leaving\ninheritances and providing financial assistance to\nfamily members.\nBecause the partnership programs alter the dy-\nnamic of asset effects by making it less costly to pro-\ntect assets, these results cannot speak to the effects of\nassets under the partnership programs. The McCall\nand associates' study (1998) is noteworthy in that it is\nthe first study to examine long-term care insurance\npurchase under the partnership regime; future re-\nsearch on the potential effectiveness of the partner-\nships program should incorporate a similar sample\nbut with improved asset data. In addition, it will be\nessential in future research to address the question of\nhow Medicaid costs are affected by the partnerships.\nReferences\nCohen, M.A., Kumar, N., McGuire, T., & Wallack, S.

Because such a small percentage of the popula-\ntion purchases private insurance, the focus of\nmany research studies has been why individuals\ndo not purchase insurance. Leading explana-\ntions include the high cost of premiums due to\nadverse selection and moral hazard. Reasons for\npurchasing insurance, reported in surveys of pur-\nchasers, include increasing choice of nursing\nhome care, maintaining independence, and\n2. \"Back-end\" coverage describes plans in which\nprivate insurance or out-of-pocket payments\ncover some initial period of care, and public in-\nsurance covers the costs for the remainder of the\ncare period. The partnership programs are an ex-\nample of back-end coverage.\n3. These observations are not eliminated from the\nsample; instead, results are based on a model\nwhere a dummy variable for \"missing assets\" is\nincluded as an explanatory variable.\n4. For more on the use of spline regression, or lin-\near piecewise regression, see Green (1993).\n5. This number is lower than the estimated 4% and\n5% reported in the studies cited in the introduc-\ntion. However, the age of the AHEAD sample (at\nan average of 76.5 years) is consistent with a\nsmaller percentage of individuals having long-\nterm care policies, because (a) few insurance\ncompanies sold these policies until the mid-\n1980s, and (b) premiums increase with age. In\naddition, the estimate of 4\u00ad5% is produced by\nthe Health Insurance Association of America,\nwhich derives this estimate from the number of\npolicies sold relative to the population, not ac-\ncounting for lapses in coverage or deaths.\n6. The financial assets included in this measure\nare: checking, savings, money market accounts,\nCDs, government savings bonds, T-bills, IRAs,\nKEOGHs, stocks, mutual funds, investment trusts,\nbusiness equity, bonds, bond funds, real estate\nnot including the primary home, and the value\nof vehicles.\n7. Marginal effects are calculated as  (x) ,\nwhere  is the standard normal density, x is a\nvector of mean values for all explanatory vari-\nables, and  is the probit coefficient. Marginal\neffects for binary variables are calculated as the\ndiscrete change as the dummy goes from 0 to 1.\nThe reported t statistics are for the hypothesis test\nof the underlying coefficient being equal to zero.\n8. Of the additional covariates included in the\nmodel reported in Table 2, education has a posi-\ntive and significant effect on ownership of long-\nterm care insurance. Ownership of long-term care\ninsurance increases with both age and household\nincome. Of the three measures of health status,\nonly the dummy variable for poor health status is\nstatistically significant. Those in poor health are\nless likely to have long-term care insurance. Rela-\ntive to respondents living in the eastern United\nStates, respondents in other regions of the country\nare more likely to own long-term care insurance.\nrespectively.\n11. However, some respondents who expect to\nleave assets for a spouse may not perceive that\nas either an inheritance or a financial transfer."
