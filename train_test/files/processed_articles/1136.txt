In Malawi, where HIV prevalence for\nadults is estimated to be 15 per cent, virtually all marry, and if they divorce, which many\ndo, most remarry. In 1990, when participants in focus groups were asked why they married,\nthey gave two reasons: referring to the gendered division of labour they said that they\nneeded someone on whom to depend for economic subsistence, and that they married\nbecause they had reached an age where their sexual desires made it advantageous to have\na regular sexual partner rather than satisfying themselves \"here and there\" (FAO et al.\n1990). Now they say the same things, but they often add a third reason: that in the era of\nAIDS -- \"this dangerous disease of nowadays\" -- those who are not married will\nnonetheless seek sexual partners and thereby place themselves at risk of infection (Schatz\n2000; Schatz 2002). This concern is echoed by parents, who urge their daughters and sons\nto marry rather than $move around#, the common phrase for promiscuity (Kaler 1999; Kaler\nThat marrying is now being popularly advocated as an AIDS prevention measure led\nus to wonder what proportions of Malawian newly-weds might already be HIV positive\nwhen they married. In that case, and leaving aside the issue of faithfulness within marriage,\nmarrying would provide no protection for an infected spouse and additionally would pose\na danger to an uninfected one.\nWe address this question by means of a microsimulation model. The model\nincorporates realistic behavioural processes such as those of sexual initiation, subsequent\nsexual activity, and first marriage, with parameters taken from a study of ever-married\nwomen of childbearing age and their husbands conducted in three rural areas of Malawi\n(south, centre and north). The model also incorporates biological processes such as those\nof the transmission and natural histories of HIV and other STDs, the latter being included\nbecause they facilitate HIV transmission (Fleming and Wasserheit 1999, R\u00f8ttingen,\nCameron and Garnett 2001). We first simulate the proportions of new marriages in three\nareas of rural Malawi in which the bride, the groom, or both are already HIV positive. We\nnext vary our input parameters to demonstrate their individual contributions to the\nsimulated outcomes. Finally we reconcile our simulated findings on age-specific gender\ndifferences in HIV prevalence with comparable observational data from rural Zimbabwe.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 209\n2. Expectations\nWe expect to find differences between the three regions of Malawi in the simulated HIV\nstatuses of brides and grooms because we expect to find regional differences in patterns of\npremarital sexual activity and the timing of first marriage, in part because of the likelihood\nthat the regions' distinctive lineage/kinship systems influence marriage. Rumphi District,\nin the north, follows a patrilineal system of kinship and lineage: residence is ideally\npatrilocal, inheritance is traced through sons, and bridewealth is required, implying later\nmarriage. Balaka District, in the south, follows the matrilineal system, ideally with\nmatrilocal residence and with token gifts at marriage, although both patrilocal and\nmatrilocal residence occur. Mchinji District, located in the central region, follows a less\nrigid matrilineal system whereby residence may be matrilocal or patrilocal, and, again, only\ntoken gifts at marriage. In addition to this variation in lineage/kinship systems, the\nthree districts differ according to the predominant ethnicity, religion and language;\nparticularly this last-mentioned difference, in language, suggests that the attitudes\nand behaviours in the three communities may also be distinct. Moreover, although\neach of the three districts lacks electricity and running water and average annual\nincomes are low (the World Bank gives a national average of US$160\n[http://www.worldbank.org/data/countrydata/aag/mwi_aag.pdf]), both income and wealth,\nas well as levels of education, are highest in the north and lowest in the south.\nIn contrast, we have no prior expectations concerning the differences between the\nsimulated prevalence of HIV among brides and grooms. Comparable \"real\" data could be\nobtained only if all prospective brides and grooms were tested for HIV on the morning of\ntheir wedding, and we are unaware of relevant published data from studies of rural Malawi,\nor indeed elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies of the general population, classified by\nsex, age, and marital status, tend to reveal a higher prevalence among the ever-married than\nthe never-married, and among young women than young men (see for example, Glynn et\nal. 2001 for urban Kenya and Zambia, and Gregson et al. 2002 for rural Zimbabwe), but\none cannot extrapolate such findings to brides and grooms because the populations are not\ncomparable. The proportions infected among newly-weds is affected not just by premarital\nsexual behaviour and the age difference between premarital sexual partners but by the\ntiming of marriage for both women and men, which subsumes the duration from sexual\ninitiation to marriage.\n3. Microsimulation\nMicrosimulation is a stochastic computer-dependent technique for simulating a set of\nindividual histories according to predetermined probabilistic rules (Santow 2001). The aim\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n210 http://www.demographic-research.org\nof any microsimulation is to show the implications of a particular set of conditions, given\na particular process or web of interdependent processes. In that regard, a microsimulation\nresembles an experiment that for reasons of ethics, expense, and time could not be\nconducted on an actual human population. Various characteristics of the microsimulation\nmethod make it a particularly appropriate tool in the present application. Among these\ncharacteristics are that direct observation of the outcome of interest -- the HIV status of\nMalawian brides and grooms -- is not feasible; that the outcome results from the interplay\nof complex processes to which probabilities and probability distributions can be attached;\nand that this interplay is sufficiently complicated that solution by analytical means is\nimpossible because any mathematical formulation becomes intractable long before the\nequations become realistic.\nA microsimulation, or Monte Carlo, model operationalizes a flow chart representing\nthe process through which individuals experience events and changes of status (such as, in\nthe present application, forming a sexual relationship, or contracting HIV), drawing on a\nset of real or hypothetical probability distributions (such as the age-specific probability of\nforming a sexual relationship, or the probability of contracting HIV from a single act of\nunprotected sexual intercourse). Whether or not an individual experiences a particular event\nis determined stochastically in a manner analogous to coin tossing (hence the name \"Monte\nCarlo\", because of the analogy with gaming) -- heads the event occurs, tails it doesn't --\nwith the proviso that coin tossing implies an underlying probability of one-half of obtaining\na head (because a head is as likely as a tail if the coin is fair), whereas in a microsimulation\nthe underlying probability of an event is pre-set by the analyst. This underlying input\nprobability might, for example, be pre-set to 0.10. In the course of simulating an\nindividual's history we come to a decision junction concerning whether or not an event\noccurs. The computer program generates a random probability (a random number from a\nuniform distribution between zero and one). If it is no greater than 0.10 the event is said to\noccur; if it exceeds 0.10 the event is said not to occur. In the case of HIV infection, at each\ncoitus with an infectious partner a random probability is chosen and compared with the pre-\nset underlying infection probability. Infection is said to occur at this particular coitus if the\nrandomly drawn probability is less than or equal to the input probability.\nA microsimulation model simulates individual life histories one at a time, with the\nsample size being set by the analyst. Because of the random variation introduced by the\nMonte-Carlo method the collection of simulated life histories will exhibit a degree of\nheterogeneity akin to that in a real population: there will be \"average\" people, for example,\nbut there will be outliers as well. The resulting data set is analyzed as though it had been\nderived from \"real\" people through prospective observation, interview, and continuous\nmonitoring of STD and HIV status. Nevertheless, much more will be known about each\nsimulated individual than could ever be known of a real one, however complex the process\nof data collection: we have perfect information (having set it ourselves) on the probability\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 211\ndistributions that govern individuals' biology and behaviour, and perfect information on\nevery outcome and change of status, whether these be biological or behavioural.\n4. Sexual behaviour and marriage\nOur microsimulations use behavioural input parameters drawn from the Malawi Diffusion\nand Ideational Change Project (MDICP), which is described in more detail below. We rely\nprimarily on survey data collected by the MDICP, but when that is not available (for\nexample, for coital frequency) or there is reason to doubt the veracity of survey responses,\nwe also draw on a set of qualitative studies conducted in the project area. These include a\ncomparison of semi-structured interviews on marriage and divorce with the MDICP survey\nsemi-structured interviews with the elderly (Kaler 1999); interviews with rural STI workers\n(Smith 2001); unstructured interviews with young men about their sexual partnerships; and\nobservational field journals kept by local interviewers recording conversations they\nmarried women of childbearing age (15-49) and 1065 husbands of the currently married\nwomen. The target sample size was 1500 ever-married women and 1000 of their husbands,\ndivided equally across the three regions. The target for husbands was lower because it was\nexpected that many of them would have been away, due to extensive internal migration in\nMalawi and because some of the female respondents would be separated/divorced or\nwidowed; in addition, because of polygyny more than one woman can be married to the\nsame man.\nThe sampling procedures are described in detail elsewhere (Watkins et al. 2003;\nwww.pop.upenn.edu/Social_Networks). In brief, an administrative area (Traditional\nAuthority) was selected in each of three districts to correspond to a previous survey for\nwhich we had access to the data, in order to permit longitudinal comparison. In each\nTraditional Authority, we conducted a census of the households and the number of eligible\nrespondents. The sampling fraction was inversely proportional to the size of the village.\nAlthough the sample was not designed to be representative of the national population of\nMalawi, responses to MDICP questions show close correspondence with comparable\nquestions asked of rural respondents to the Malawi Demographic and Health Survey\nIn 2001 a follow-up survey (Malawi 2) sought more detailed information on premarital\nsexual activity, and collected detailed marriage histories that provide information not just\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n212 http://www.demographic-research.org\non the timing of marriages but the age differences between spouses. Information on the\nlatter is critical to our simulation of couples but is not available from DHS-style surveys.\nWe cannot derive empirical evidence about the sexual behaviour of present-day\nteenagers from this survey because, since it was a follow-up of the ever-married sample first\ninterviewed three years earlier, there is essentially no information on women currently\nyounger than 20 or men currently younger than 25. Moreover, since only ever-married\npeople were interviewed, we place little weight on the reporting of the youngest people\ninterviewed since they are a specially selected group who must have married young. As a\nresult, the following account derives mainly from the testimony of people now aged at least\n25. Nevertheless, a comparison across cohorts did not reveal any evidence of a systematic\nshift in sexual or nuptial behaviour over the recent past.\nThe general picture from the survey data and supported by the qualitative data is that\ngirls become sexually active earlier than boys and also marry earlier. Their first sexual\npartner tends to be older than they are themselves, and their first husband to be older again.\nMen are more likely to report premarital sex than women, but premarital sex is common\nfor both. Men are also more likely than women to report that during their first sexual\nrelationship they had concurrent sexual relations with someone other than their regular\npartner although the proportions are not particularly high. Both men and women, however,\nevinced a considerable lack of trust in the sexual faithfulness of their first sexual partner.\nThe first sexual partnership tended to be short, and condom use was negligible. Fewer men\nthan women reported marrying their first sexual partner (although women may be more\nlikely to omit early relations that did not lead to marriage), and once sexually active, men\nwere slower than women to marry.\nWithin this general picture, however, there is considerable regional variation (see\nTable 1). Both sexual debut and marriage are earliest in the south (Balaka), intermediate\nin the central region (Mchinji), and latest in the north (Rumphi). The likelihood that people\nmarry their first sexual partner also increases from south to north; correspondingly, the\nduration from first sex to first marriage is longer in the south than the north. Thus, for\nexample, two-fifths of women in the south, but two-thirds of women in the north, reported\nthat they married at the same age as they first had sexual relations; corresponding figures\nfor men are one-fifth and one-third. Note that although, in general terms, the later people\nfirst have sex, the sooner they marry thereafter, there is considerable heterogeneity within\nthe three regions. Even in the north, where sexual debut is comparatively delayed and\nmarriage comparatively hastened, two-fifths of men are still unmarried five years after first\nhaving sex, a proportion that does not clearly distinguish the region from the other two.\nIt is not just the duration from first sex to first marriage that bears on the probability\nthat brides and grooms will be HIV positive at marriage, but people's behaviour over that\ninterval. In each region, condom use is rare: over 90 per cent of people reported never\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 213\nTable 1: Sexual activity and marriage, people aged 30-39, Malawi 2\nSouth (Balaka) Centre (Mchinji) North (Rumphi)\nWomen Men Women Men Women Men\nHad sex by (%):\n1st sexual partner (not spouse) (%):\n1st sexual partner (including spouse) (%):\nCondom use during 1st partnership (non-marital) (%)\nLength of 1st partnership (non-marital) reported in (%):\n1st partner was unfaithful (%):\nAge at marriage minus age at first sex (%)\nMarried by (%):\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n214 http://www.demographic-research.org\nhaving used a condom with their first partner. First sexual partnerships appeared to be\nshortest in the south, where around two-fifths of people reported the partnership's duration\nin months, and to be longest in the north, where around one-quarter reported the duration\nin months. As for whether a respondent suspected her or his first partner to have been\nunfaithful, there are indications that the extremes are defined by the northern and central\nregions. Around half the northern respondents had the confidence to declare that their first\npartner had probably not been unfaithful, compared with only about one-quarter of the\ncentral respondents. These differences are consistent with the implications of the regional\ndifferences in lineage and kinship systems.\nWomen's premarital partners are casual partners and steadier boyfriends (we use the\nterm \"peers\"). Men's premarital partners include not just casual partners and steadier\ngirlfriends but bar girls, the commercial sex workers of the rural areas, who work out of\nbars or discos in the small towns. Our focus-group interviews with bar girls show a\nconsiderable amount of geographical mobility by the bar girls, both to other small towns\nand to the larger cities where HIV prevalence is much higher. There is also a considerable\namount of temporary mobility by men, who leave the villages to work in a city.\nThe survey did not inquire about coital frequency, but qualitative studies suggest that\nmarriage marks a change from sporadic to regular sex; indeed, one motivation for marriage\nMarried couples recalled that they initially had sex every day, although as they grew older\nfrequency declined. In contrast, what appears to be most typical of premarital sex is that\npartners are not able to have sex frequently with each other. For men, if the partner is a bar\ngirl relations may be infrequent because of the cost: bar girls depend on their clients for\ntheir living. There are also financial transactions with casual partners, but these are small\n(a soda, a bottle of lotion, a small amount of money). Cost does not seem to inhibit coital\nfrequency among peers as much as other barriers. The partners may not see each other\nbecause they are at different schools, or they meet while one is visiting elsewhere, for\nexample when one partner has travelled to a nearby town to visit a relative or to buy or sell\ngoods. Although it is likely that young males and females from the same or neighboring\nvillages do have sex with each other, this is hindered by their desire to avoid their\nrelationship becoming known to parents and other relatives. In addition, some respondents\nwere concerned that frequent sex would result in pregnancy.\n5. The burden of sexually transmitted diseases\nUNAIDS/WHO (www.who.int/emc-hiv/fact_sheets/pdfs/Malawi EN.pdf ) estimates that\nBetween 1992 and 2001 the median prevalence of HIV among women attending antenatal\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 215\nfacilities outside major urban areas reportedly increased from six per cent (range 2-14%,\nwomen at ages 25-29 but, as expected, is higher among specially selected groups, such as\ncommercial sex workers.\nHIV/AIDS is now the best known sexually transmitted disease in Malawi, being\nnamed without probing by 85 per cent of female respondents and 92 per cent of male\nrespondents to a 1996 survey, but the levels of awareness of gonorrhoea, syphilis and\nbuboes (chancroid) are also high: for example, 57 per cent of women and 73 per cent of\nmen spontaneously named syphilis (National Statistical Office, Malawi and ORC Macro\n1997). Indeed, sexually transmitted infections, in particular syphilis, have been documented\nin Malawi since colonial times (Chirwa 1999; King and King 1992), although information\non the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections within the general population -- either\nthen or now -- is scanty. Among respondents to the 2000 Malawi Demographic and Health\nSurvey, eleven per cent of women and eight per cent of men reported having had a sexually\ntransmitted infection during the previous year, the gender difference between the overall\nproportions stemming largely from the proportions who reported a genital sore or ulcer\n(eight per cent of women and four per cent of men). The finding, quoted by UNAIDS, that\na median of 46 per cent of STI clinic patients tested at seven sites outside the major urban\ninterrelationship between HIV and the older sexually transmitted infections. The only\nreadily available government statistics are for people attending STD clinics in cities; at\nrural clinics there is some attempt at syndromic diagnosis, but clinicians do not have the\nequipment for distinguishing between STDs (Interview with Dr. Agabu, STD Controller\nAccording to our interviews with rural STI workers in the south (Smith 2001), both\nwomen and men present with genital ulcers (suggesting syphilis, genital herpes, or\nchancroid), urethral discharge (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, or bacterial vaginosis), and buboes\n(chancroid) and that women additionally present with lower abdominal pain, a sign of\npelvic inflammatory disease and hence of gonorrhoea and/or chlamydia (Arya 1998).\nGonorrhoea is said to be the most commonly observed STD in people seeking treatment,\nfollowed by syphilis, but given the absence of serological testing and the difficulties of\ndistinguishing between syphilis, chancroid and herpes on the basis of symptoms alone it is\nonly too likely that the latter two diseases are also present in the population.\nThe burden of STD infection is illustrated by a single graphic semi-structured\ninterview conducted in the central region (Chimbiri 2001). The respondent's cousin had\nsuffered from painful (burning) pimple-like sores inside and outside the vagina and the\ncousin's husband complained of pains in his legs (possibly genital herpes in each case); a\nrelative had boils on the vagina and the armpits (syphilis and/or chancroid); some people\nhad rashes all over their bodies that looked like scabies and were said to be a sign of AIDS\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n216 http://www.demographic-research.org\n(possibly syphilis); and the respondent herself experienced pain during sexual intercourse\n(gonorrhoea and/or chlamydia). The interviewer believed the respondent was HIV positive.\n6. The model\nAs described earlier, our choice of microsimulation is dictated by our desire to replicate the\ncomplexity of the behavioural and epidemiological processes that in the real world shape\nthe phenomena under study, which is possible only from the perspective of the individual.\nOther researchers of the AIDS epidemic have also turned, and for the same reason, to\nmicrosimulation, although approaches differ depending on the researchers' aims. Possibly\nthe earliest model, that of Auvert (1991), was constructed at a time of rapid development\nof aggregate-level AIDS models (United Nations 1991). More recently, the models of\nMorris and colleagues, (for example, Morris and Kretzschmar 2000), incorporate rich\ncharacterizations of sexual networks but define probabilities of disease transmission per\npartnership rather than per coitus and lack a demographic dimension. The STDSIM model\nof Van der Ploeg et al. (1998) was constructed to model the evolution of HIV prevalence\nin response to intervention programmes, such as the treatment of a range of STDs. The\nSOCSIM model of Wachter and colleagues (for example, Wachter 2001) is a descendant\nof earlier demographic models that has now been adapted to examine aspects of the AIDS\nepidemic. As is the case with STDSIM, fertility schedules are exogenous to the simulation,\nthat is, the childbearing of individuals is governed stochastically by input schedules\nconstructed or selected by the user rather than derived as simulation output. We take a\ndifferent approach, as outlined below.\n6.1 Modelling behaviour\nOur microsimulation model, which is described in greater detail in the Appendix, was\noriginally developed as a comprehensive model of human reproduction and mortality. Only\nafter the baseline model had been validated by comparing simulated age patterns of\nchildbearing with the Brass fertility polynomial (Brass and Coale 1968: see the Appendix)\nwas the model extended so that coitus carried not just a risk of pregnancy to (fecund)\nwomen but a risk of disease transmission and acquisition to all women, whether fecund or\nnot, and also to all men. Accordingly, fertility and disease transmission are endogenous to\nthe simulation and simulated disease outcomes are consistent with simulated fertility\noutcomes. This is a novel feature of our model. We focus in this description on the present\napplication of the model, which is one of many potential applications.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 217\nThe first step in simulating an individual woman is to determine her age at marriage\naccording to the region-specific marriage model. Next we determine her husband's age at\nmarriage on the basis of a simulated age gap between spouses. Having determined when\na marriage takes place, we go back and separately simulate the sexual activity of the two\nindividuals up to that point. In an attempt at verisimilitude, if it transpires that a groom\nsimulated for a particular bride has the visible symptoms of AIDS (determined\nstochastically according to the time since the elective groom's infection with HIV), a\n\"search\" for another groom is undertaken. Up to five such searches are conducted.\nSome preliminary work was necessary to transform the observed marriage data\nsummarized in Table 1 into suitable input for the microsimulation model. Three distinct\nCoale-McNeil marriage models (Coale and McNeil 1972) were fitted to the observed\nregion-specific data, using a minimum-chi-squared criterion (upper panel of Table 2a). In\npreliminary testing of the model we confirmed that simulated distributions of age at first\nmarriage for men closely resembled the directly observed distributions derived from the\nMalawi 2 data.\nTo increase the heterogeneity in simulated behaviour we adopt a two-stage approach\nto modelling behaviours such as premarital sexual activity. In the first stage, we determine\nwhether or not an individual has what we dub a \"propensity\" to undertake that behaviour.\nBy this we mean that some individuals have a tendency, or propensity, to behave in a\nparticular way, but others do not and will never so behave. For example, women in the\nsouth are assigned a propensity of 0.90 to engage in sex before marriage (see Table 2a).\nWhen simulating an individual history we select a random probability, and if it exceeds\n0.90 then that individual does not have sex before marriage. If the random probability is\nno greater than 0.90, then the individual has the propensity to have premarital sex, although\nwhether or not she actually does so depends on further Monte-Carlo experimentation. This\nis the second stage in the process.\nPremarital sexual activity is simulated slightly differently for women and men. Each\nof the three variants of the model (south, centre, north) incorporates a distinct propensity\nfor women to have sex before marriage (see Table 2a). At each age, women with this\npropensity have a pre-set age-specific probability of embarking on an affair, and if one\ntranspires, the duration of the relationship is determined stochastically according to the\nmodel input. Their partner's age is determined from reported age differences between\npartners, and the partner's sexual and disease histories are simulated up to the point at\nwhich the affair is said to commence. Coital frequency within the affair is set to half the\nmarital level. (More detail is given in the Appendix: suffice it to say here that marital coital\nfrequency is itself derived in the simulation as a function of mean age-specific fecundability\nand cycle length by drawing on a model originally proposed by Glass and Grebenik\n[Bongaarts and Potter 1983].) Subsequent relationships may follow, and a relationship that\nis simulated to continue into the first marriage is said to be with the first husband.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n218 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 2a: District-specific input parameters related to sexual debut and first marriage,\nwomen only\nSouth Centre North\nFirst marriage\nMinimum age, ao\nAge differences between spouses at ages:\nao\nao\nSex outside marriage\nProbability at age:\nAverage duration\n(mths)\nMedian age diff\n(years)\nCoital frequency\nTable 2b: District-invariant input parameters related to premarital sexual behaviour,\nmen only\nPremarital sex with Peers Bar girls\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 219\nTable 2c: District-invariant input parameters related to extramarital sexual behavior,\nwomen and men\nWomen Men\nExtramarital affairs\nAverage duration (mths) 6 6\nMedian age diff (years) 3 3\nSex with bar girls (men only)\nMonthly probability of sex 0.4 before age 25\nMonthly coital frequency 3-8\nSources: MDIC2 questions on marriage history and premarital partnerships, and qualitative interviews by Hickey (1998) [centre],\nThe input parameters governing men's premarital sexual behaviour does not vary by region\n(Table 2b). Their median age at premarital sexual debut is set at 17 years, and four-fifths\nof them have the propensity to have casual relationships with their peers and to visit bar\ngirls. Those with either propensity (by chance some will have both) have a comparatively\nlow probability at age 15 of sexual activity in any month, but this rises steadily to age 20\nand above. Their coital frequency is selected from within pre-determined limits.\nAlthough the possibility that married individuals engage in extramarital sexual\nrelations has no bearing on their HIV status at first marriage, we allowed for this possibility\nin order to be able to simulate HIV prevalence in the general population (see Table 2c). In\nsimulations in which married people have affairs, they all have the propensity to do so\nalthough the annual probability is rather small and affairs short-lived. These patterns of\nextramarital relations are consistent with our qualitative data and with Tawfik (2003):\nalthough many men and women are unfaithful, coital frequency in extramarital partnerships\nis comparatively low, as it is for the unmarried. In addition, some husbands visit bar girls.\nTwo variants of the simulations incorporating extramarital sex (\"medium\" and \"high\")\ndiffer according to husbands' propensity to visit bar girls.\nIn these initial simulations marriage may end through the death of a spouse but in the\npresent application we make no allowance for remarriage or for divorce.\nIn order to establish baseline results, we assume no condom use, and no use of\ncontraception more generally.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n220 http://www.demographic-research.org\nEach simulation incorporates background mortality at West level 11 (Coale and\nfor males. These correspond to pre-AIDS mortality levels in Malawi, where life\nexpectancies for both sexes combined are estimated to have risen modestly, from 43 in the\nDoctor 2002). AIDS brings super-mortality to the simulated populations as it does in real\nlife.\n6.2. Introducing disease\nNot every person has premarital sex, but those who do are at risk of becoming infected\nbefore marriage if at least one of their sexual partners is infectious with an STD or HIV.\nTo introduce infection into the simulated population we posit the existence of a group of\nwomen external to the simulated population among whom certain proportions are infectious\nwith various diseases, not just HIV. These women -- in the real world, bar girls and casual\npartners or girlfriends -- form the \"reservoir of infection\" from which disease is introduced\ninto the population at large: they infect men, and these men in turn infect other women.\nThe model allows for the possibility of infection with three discharge (non-ulcerative)\nSTDs (gonorrhoea, chlamydia and bacterial vaginosis), and three ulcerative STDs (syphilis,\nchancroid and herpes). It seemed important to include representatives of each of these types\nof disease as they differ according to their effects on HIV transmission, as we go on to\ndescribe. In addition, each group of diseases exhibits a degree of heterogeneity in terms of\nvarious characteristics: not only of their transmission probabilities but their duration of\ninfectiousness, the likelihood (as with herpes) of spontaneous recurrence, and their\nconferring of immunity to subsequent infection (significant with syphilis but not, for\nexample, with gonorrhoea).\nThe uppermost panel of Table 3 shows the proportions of men's sexual partners (peers\nand bar girls) who are said to be infectious with these three discharge STDs, three\nulcerative STDs, and with HIV. Uncontroversially, bar girls are assigned higher proportions\ninfectious (two to three times) than peers. The proportion of bar girls who are HIV positive\nis set to 0.75, midway between the prevalence of 0.70 observed among Lilongwe prostitutes\nIn assigning values to the proportions of women who are infectious with other diseases\nwe were guided very broadly by the available regional literature (for example Cameron et\nhistories of each of the diseases. Our task is complicated by the fact that many relevant\nstudies quote serological evidence of past infection whereas what is relevant for disease\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 221\ntransmission (and hence important for our model) is current infectiousness, yet HIV is the\nonly disease in which the two coincide.\nTable 3: Model input parameters related to STDs and HIV\nGonorrhoea\nChlamydia\nBVaginosis\nSyphilis\nChancroid\nHerpes\nHIV\nProportion infectious among\nInfection/unprotected coitus\nIncreased susceptibility (relative risk) to HIV if infectious with\nIncreased infectiousness of HIV if infectious with\nIncreased susceptibility if HIV+ to\nIncreased infectiousness if either recently infected or symptomatic\nProportion recently infected among\nMean infectious period (months)\nMean duration of episode (months)\nMean survival with HIV (yrs) 7.5\nWeibull shape parameter 5.0\nMean survival with AIDS (yrs) 1.0\nWeibull shape parameter 1.0\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n222 http://www.demographic-research.org\nOur general strategy in selecting the biomedical input parameters in the remainder of\nthe table has been to compare quoted figures in as many sources as we could locate, to put\nmore weight on overview articles or chapters than single studies, and to be conservative.\nOur state of knowledge has not changed radically over the decade since Wasserheit\n(1992:66) observed that \"Our overall understanding of the natural history of STDs such as\nsyphilis, chancroid, or HPV infection is still relatively embryonic\". Indeed, the biomedical\nliterature on STD transmission and the natural histories of STDs is less complete, and less\nsatisfying, than an outsider from the social sciences might initially have expected. It is\ntherefore not our intention to give the impression that each parameter is well-known, well-\nsubstantiated, and uncontroversial.\nTransmission probabilities per single act of unprotected coitus provide a case in point\n(second panel of Table 3). Syphilis, for example, has been studied for longer than the other\nSTDs, and old studies of untreated syphilis (which for ethical reasons could not be\nconducted today) provide invaluable data on the disease's natural history. Nevertheless, the\ngenerally quoted per-coitus transmission probability of 0.30, which was derived from just\none study (Schroeter 1971), is almost certainly too high since the figure actually refers to\nthe probability of transmission during a one-month period. This would be the same as a per-\ncoitus probability only if there were only one sexual act during the month: we make the\nconservative assumption, for the purposes of our model, that there were two, giving a per-\ncoitus risk of transmission of a little more than 0.15, the value we use. We might add,\nperhaps, that the syphilis transmission probability at least was quoted for a particular time\nperiod. In contrast, transmission probabilities have often been quoted \"per partnership\"\nwithout reference to either coital frequency or length of partnership (for example Brunham\nThe most striking feature of this panel is that the transmission probability of HIV is\norders of magnitude smaller than that of the classic STDs. The most frequently cited\nprobability of male-to-female transmission of HIV per single unprotected coitus is 0.003\n(Anderson 1998). In contrast, the probability of transmission of gonorrhoea, for example,\nThe third panel of the table demonstrates the rationale for including STDs in our\nsimulation model, which is that, since STD-infectious individuals are at increased risk of\nacquiring HIV, STDs facilitate HIV transmission. Drawn from R\u00f8ttingen, Cameron and\nGarnett (2001), the relative risks are preferred to comparable ones given by Fleming and\nWasserheit (1999) not only because the R\u00f8ttingen figures are more recent but because they\ntend to be more conservative.\nIndividuals who are infectious with both gonorrhoea and HIV appear to pose twice the\nrisk of HIV acquisition to their uninfected partners as would otherwise be expected (fourth\npanel of the panel). HIV-positive individuals also have perhaps twice the risk of acquiring\nan ulcerative STD although they appear to be at no greater risk of acquring a discharge\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 223\nSTD (fifth panel): the relevance of this latter effect for HIV transmission is that these\nindividuals may infect other partners with an ulcerative STD, rendering them in turn more\nsusceptible to HIV infection.\nThe biological plausibility of such synergies is well accepted (Fleming and Wasserheit\nuncertainty surrounds their exact strength: not all studies control adequately for sexual\nbehaviour although concurrent STD and HIV infection may merely be a marker for risky\nsexual activity; many are case-control studies, which cannot untangle the temporal sequence\nof disease acquisition; and there is a possibility of multiple infections. For example,\nWasserheit (1992) cites estimates of the relative risk of acquiring HIV (the co-factor effect)\nfor gonorrhoea-infectious women ranging from 3.5 (derived from the only prospective\nstudy) to 8.9 (note, in passing, that this figure has now been down-graded to 2.0 (R\u00f8ttingen,\nCameron and Garnett 2001). Nevertheless, extensive prior testing of the microsimulation\nmodel showed that the likelihood of HIV sero-conversion is fairly insensitive to the exact\nmagnitude, within reasonable limits, of the hypothesized co-factor effects. For example, in\na set of simulations that differed only in terms of the increased susceptibility to HIV of\npeople with infectious gonorrhoea, the life-time risk of contracting HIV ranged from 0.44\nwith a co-factor of 3.5, the lower limit of the cited range, to 0.52 with a co-factor of 8.9,\nthe upper limit. The reasons for this comparative insensitivity are that the base-line\nprobability of HIV transmission is tiny, and that for most STDs the duration of\ninfectiousness during which the synergies operate (shown further down the table) is\nrelatively short.\nViral load, the chief predictor of HIV transmission, is high in the early stages of\ninfection and again after the infected individual has progressed to the symptomatic stage\n(Ambroziak and Levy 1999, Quinn et al. 2000). We therefore incorporate a trebling of\ninfectiousness during the six months following seroconversion and also when the individual\nhas progressed to AIDS (sixth panel).\nIt is necessary to take account not just of an individual's infection with a particular\ndisease but of the disease's subsequent course. Since we assume no treatment of STDs in\nthe present simulations, the following brief account refers to their natural histories.\nEpisodes of some infections (gonorrhoea and chlamydia, for example) are typically short,\nand the duration of infectiousness is even shorter. An individual thus infected cannot be re-\ninfected until the particular episode has run its course although infection provides no\nimmunity against further bouts (Anderson 1999, Sparling 1999a). The course of syphilis,\non the other hand, is very varied, with around two-thirds of individuals apparently acquiring\na degree of immunity and never progressing beyond the post-secondary latent stage (no\nclinical symptoms but historical or serological evidence of past infection) (Miller 1989,\nhowever, individuals remain infected for life and experience periodic relapses, during\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n224 http://www.demographic-research.org\nwhich they are infectious, most frequently in the first year or two after initial infection, and\nless frequently thereafter (Corey and Wald 1999). We incorporate these aspects of our six\nSTDs into the model.\nThe properties of the non-HIV diseases we include in our simulations imply that, even\nwhen couples are faithful after marriage, it is possible for a disease to travel from one to\nthe other and then back again: a husband can infect his wife with gonorrhoea, for example,\nand if she remains infectious for long enough she can re-infect him once his initial infection\nhas passed. It is also possible, except for genital herpes and HIV, for an infection to die out\nfrom a marriage if spouses are faithful to one another.\n7. HIV prevalence among newly-weds\nWe are at last in a position to simulate the proportions of HIV positive brides and grooms\nin the three regions of rural Malawi. The three regional simulations differ according to\nwomen's propensity to have sex before marriage, according to first-marriage patterns for\nwomen, and to the age differences between spouses. Nevertheless, the regional simulations\nhave most input data in common: the same age-specific probabilities that women (with a\npropensity to do so) start an affair; the same age difference between premarital partners,\nduration of the affair and coital frequency; and the same premarital sexual behaviour among\nmen.\nThe next three tables contain the results of three simulations, one for each region, each\nof 10,000 couples. For each region we present characteristics of newly-weds first from the\npoint of view of the bride (left-hand block of columns), and then from the point of the\ngroom (right-hand block). For brides, we show the percentages of marriages that occur at\neach bridal age and the corresponding mean age of their grooms; thus in the southern\n(Balaka) simulations of Table 4, 15.0 per cent of brides marry at age 15 and their grooms\nhave an average age of 19. The next four columns show, respectively, the percentages of\nnew couples whose members are both HIV negative (labelled --), where only the bride is\nHIV positive (labelled b-), where only the groom is HIV positive (labelled \u00adg), and where\nboth are HIV positive (labelled bg). For example, among marriages when the bride is aged\n15, 94.2 per cent of couples are seroconcordant HIV negative; in 0.1 per cent of couples\nonly the bride is HIV positive; in 5.7 per cent of couples only the groom is HIV positive;\nand in no couples are both bride and groom HIV positive. The right-hand panel, for the\ngrooms, is comparably designed, but shows the proportions of grooms who marry at each\nage, the average ages of their brides, and the HIV status of the couple according to the age\nof the groom. At the foot of each table we show the overall HIV status of newly-weds\nirrespective of their age.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 225\nTable 4: Simulated HIV status of brides (b) and grooms (g), South (Balaka),\nBrides Grooms\n% of\nfirst Mean HIV status (percent)\n% of\nfirst Mean HIV status (percent)\nAge\nmarri-\nages\nage of\ngrooms\n-- b- -g bg\nmarri-\nages\nage of\nbrides\n-- b- -g bg\nNote that the proportions of HIV-positive couples do not inevitably rise, or fall, steadily\nwith age but in some cases demonstrate irregularity. This results from stochastic variation,\nand is particularly marked at ages when comparatively few couples marry. For example,\nsimulated HIV prevalence among brides jumps from 7.1 per cent at age 31 to 14.3 per cent\nat age 32, but only about ten women (0.1 per cent of 10,000) marry for the first time at each\nof these ages.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n226 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 4 presents our results for the matrilineal/matrilocal south. In accordance with\nthe input data (Table 2a), marriage is early, especially for brides but also for grooms:\nalmost 80 per cent of brides and 40 per cent of grooms are younger than 20. The proportion\nof marriages in which the bride and groom are both infected (bg column) is very low\nthroughout. The proportion of couples in which the bride is HIV positive (b- column + bg\ncolumn) tends to rise with age as one would expect, but remains low. The proportion of\ncouples in which the groom is positive (-g + bg) once again tends to rise with age, as\nexpected, but faster and to considerably higher levels. For example, only about four per\ngrooms, with an average age of 23.6. Brides are unlikely to be infected because they marry\nvery young. Many, indeed, will be virgins at marriage, and even those who are not simply\nhave had little time in which to contract HIV. Their grooms, in contrast, are somewhat\nolder, and some have had sex with peers and bar girls.\npositive couples are rare. That the overall percentages of HIV-positive brides and grooms\nare so much lower than some of the age-specific percentages stems once again from\nmarriage patterns: most brides and many grooms marry at ages when few people have\nalready been infected.\nTables 5 and 6 show the results of comparable simulations of the central and northern\nregions respectively. Similar patterns appear as for the south, but at different levels.\nGrooms marry later in the central and northern regions than in the south and are far more\nlikely to be infected.\nSalient features of the three simulations reveal themselves most clearly in a summary\ntable, Table 7, which is derived from the previous three detailed tables. A striking feature\nof each regional simulation is that the proportion of infected brides is markedly smaller than\nthe proportion of infected grooms. We should perhaps have expected this result: at each\nage, young men \"move around\" before marriage much more than young women, and with\nriskier partners; and they are older when they marry. Nevertheless, we could not have\npredicted that the difference -- around two per cent of brides compared with between\ntwelve and nineteen per cent of grooms -- would be so great.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 227\nTable 5: Simulated HIV status of brides (b) and grooms (g), Centre (Mchinji),\nBrides Grooms\n% of\nfirst Mean HIV status (percent)\n% of\nfirst Mean HIV status (percent)\nAge\nmarri-\nages\nage of\ngrooms\n-- b- -g bg\nmarri-\nages\nage of\nbrides\n-- b- -g bg\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n228 http://www.demographic-research.org\nTable 6: Simulated HIV status of brides (b) and grooms (g), North (Rumphi),\nBrides Grooms\n% of\nfirst Mean HIV status (percent)\n% of\nfirst Mean HIV status (percent)\nAge\nmarri-\nages\nage of\ngrooms\n-- b- -g bg\nmarri-\nages\nage of\nbrides\n-- b- -g bg\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 229\nTable 7: Summary regional findings, simulated HIV status of brides (b) and\nMean age (yrs) of HIV status (per cent)\nRegion brides grooms \u00ad \u00ad b \u00ad \u00ad g bg\nVariation in two factors contributes to the simulated differences in HIV prevalence between\nbrides and grooms within each region, and to the differences between the regions: the first-\nmarriage patterns of women, and the age difference between spouses. (The regional\nvariation in women's propensity for premarital affairs is too small to produce a noticeable\neffect, as we show later on). This nuptiality-related variation is revealed in Figure 1, which\npresents the proportions of brides and grooms at each age in the southern and northern\nregions. (The figures come from Tables 4 and 6; we do not show the marriage curves for\nthe central region because they are very similar to those from the north.) The graph\nillustrates both the young bridal ages in either region and the greater differences between\nmen's than women's regional marriage patterns.\nFigure 1: Distributions of ages at marriage, by sex and region\nAge at marriage\nPercentage of marriages\nSouthern Brides\nSouthern Grooms\nNorthern Brides\nNorthern Grooms\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n230 http://www.demographic-research.org\nIn order to determine the relative importance for the HIV status of brides and grooms of\nthe timing of the first marriage among women and the age difference between spouses we\nnext performed some simulations in which these factors were varied independently. Taking\nthe extreme northern and southern simulations we ask, essentially, what would happen to\nthe HIV status of newly-weds in the south if women married according to the southern\npattern but the age differences between spouses were as great as in the north, and what\nwould happen to HIV status in the north if women married according to the northern pattern\nbut the age differences between spouses were shrunk to the levels exhibited in the south.\nOur findings are summarized in Table 8.\nTable 8: Effect of women's marriage pattern and age difference between spouses\non simulated HIV status of brides and grooms, by region, N=10,000\nMarriage Age difference HIV status (per cent)\npattern between spouses \u00ad \u00ad b \u00ad \u00ad g bg\nNotes: Women's minimum age at marriage is 13 in the South, 14.2 in the North; at this bridal age, grooms are 3.2 years older than\nbrides in the South, and 5.5 years older in the North (see Table 2a for details)\nVarying the age difference between spouses has no effect on the HIV status of brides\nbecause they still marry according to the appropriate regional pattern, but it has a\npronounced effect on the HIV status of grooms. Were southern men to delay their\nmarriages, relative to the ages of their brides, to the extent practised in the north, the\nproportion of HIV-positive grooms would rise from twelve per cent (11.9+0.2) to sixteen\nper cent (15.3+0.4). Correspondingly, were northern men to marry brides closer to\nthemselves in age the proportion of HIV-positive grooms would fall from eighteen per cent\nInsofar as we may have mis-specified men's propensity to have premarital affairs with\ncasual partners or to seek the sexual services of bar girls, our results will be distorted.\nHolding constant women's propensity for premarital sex, and using the regional nuptiality\npatterns, we next performed a series of simulations in which we varied men's premarital\nsexual activity. The results are summarized in Table 9. (Note that holding constant\nwomen's propensity to be sexually active before marriage has only a slight effect on HIV\nstatus: compare row 1 of Table 9 with row 1 of Table 8; row 4 of Table 9 with row 4 of\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 231\nTable 9: Effect of men's propensity for premarital sexual activity on simulated\nHIV status of brides and grooms, by region, N=10,000\nPropensity for sex with HIV status (per cent)\nRegion Peers Bar girls \u00ad \u00ad b \u00ad \u00ad g bg\nNotes: Women's propensity for premarital sex fixed at 0.80\nUnsurprisingly, reducing men's premarital sexual activity reduces the likelihood that they\nwill be HIV positive at marriage. Also unsurprisingly, given their higher levels of infection,\nreducing contacts with bar girls is more efficacious in this regard than reducing contacts\nwith peers. For example, in the south, halving men's propensity to visit bar girls reduces\nthe proportion of HIV-positive grooms from twelve (11.2+0.4) per cent to eight per cent\n(7.7+0.1); reducing their contacts with peers reduces the proportion of HIV-positive\ngrooms from eight per cent to six (6.0+0.1) per cent. Interestingly, reducing men's\npremarital sexual activity in this way also has the effect of reducing the proportion of HIV-\npositive brides. This occurs because unmarried men, whose HIV infections have been\nreduced, are the premarital partners of some of our prospective brides.\nEarlier drafts of this paper frequently elicited expressions of unease because the very\nlow HIV prevalences simulated for brides, both in absolute terms and in comparison with\nthose for grooms, seemed inconsistent with the reported findings of population-based\nstudies. Glynn et al. (2001), for example, report considerably higher HIV prevalence\nKisumu, Kenya, and Ndola, Zambia. Likewise, Gregson et al. (2002) report higher HIV\nprevalence among women than men in rural Manicaland, Zimbabwe, until ages 25-29, and\nhigher HIV prevalence among men than women from ages 30-34 onward. However,\nfindings pertaining to a general population, disaggregated by age, sex, and even marital\nstatus, are not comparable to findings pertaining to a population of brides and grooms at\nthe time of marriage.\nWe next use our simulation model to demonstrate that a much smaller proportion of\ninfected brides than infected grooms is not necessarily inconsistent with a higher prevalence\nof HIV among young women than young men. Since we are now looking beyond marriage\nwe incorporate the possibility that married women and men engage in extramarital sexual\nactivity. The model also allows for women to have extramarital affairs after widowhood but\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n232 http://www.demographic-research.org\nno allowance is made for remarriage, or for divorce. Our findings are summarized in\nTable 10: Age-specific prevalence of HIV (%) among women and men, northern\nsimulation and rural Zimbabwe compared\nNorthern simulation Rural Manicaland, Zimbabwe\nAge Women Men Women Men\nNotes: See Table 2c for simulation input concerning extramarital sexual activity\nWe show the age-specific prevalences of HIV among the general population of the northern\nsimulation, which produced two per cent of HIV-positive brides but 18 per cent of HIV-\npositive grooms. Age for age, the prevalence of HIV among women exceeds that among\nmen until age 29 but at this point prevalence among women begins to fall while among men\nit continues to rise. That the simulations produce so few infected brides is consistent with\nwomen's low prevalence of HIV at the young ages at which they typically marry: 30 per\ncent of women have married by the age of 17, for example, and 70 per cent by the age of\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\nhttp://www.demographic-research.org 233\n20. That so many grooms are infected is consistent with their marrying at much later ages,\nwhen HIV infection has had a much greater opportunity, largely through casual affairs and\ncommercial sex, to enter the bachelor population. That at each single year of age so many\nmore young women -- as distinct from brides -- than young men are HIV positive\nhighlights the primary mode of transmission, at least at these young ages, to women: from\na typically older husband to a typically younger wife. Once married, women's coital\nfrequency rises, and the simulations show that non-negligible proportions of new husbands\nare HIV positive.\nThe table also shows comparable figures for rural Manicaland, Zimbabwe. The data\ncome from an unpublished tabulation kindly provided by Simon Gregson, but the basic\nelements are discernible in Figure 2 of Gregson et al. (2002). In this case, the prevalence\nof HIV among women exceeds that of men until age 30; from that age on, HIV prevalence\namong men exceeds that among women. The general resemblance between the simulated\nand the population data is striking.\n8. Conclusions\nThis paper grew out of our curiosity concerning the merits of the belief, gaining currency\nboth in Malawi and elsewhere in the region, that marrying protects against HIV/AIDS. We\nfocus on the HIV status of newly-weds because if HIV infection is already present, whether\nin wife, husband, or both, the notion that marriage is protective is clearly ill-founded: an\ninfected partner is doomed, and an uninfected partner is at high risk.\nWe estimate that HIV infection is already present in between 13 and 20 per cent of\nMalawian newly-weds. Turned on their heads, these figures imply that for at least 80 per\ncent of new, first-time couples, HIV infection is absent. Such couples have weathered the\nepidemiological perils of premarital sex and will remain seronegative so long as they\nrestrict their sexual attentions to one another. In further work we propose to examine the\nfurther evolution of HIV infection as couples are, or are not, faithful to one another, and\nto incorporate divorce and remarriage, which are known to be common.\nGregson et al. (2002) suggest for rural Zimbabwe that knowledge of high levels of\nHIV in young single people could encourage couples who are planning to marry to seek\nvoluntary counselling and testing. This could provide an effective intervention also in\nMalawi. The transition from the unmarried to the married state could provide an ideal\nopportunity for couples to take stock of their situations and to modify their behaviour\naccordingly; and to do so with particular relief if they find that they are among the majority\nof young Malawian couples who are as yet uninfected.\nDemographic Research \u00ad Special Collection 1: Article 7\n-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --\n234 http://www.demographic-research.org\n9.
