The focus is on the historical, symbolic,\nand biographical relation between the subculture, the subcultural response, and sociopolitical transformations in society and\nculture. We are interested in understanding the processes through which, for example, bodybuilding has moved back and\nforth, over time, between a subcultural position and a more common fitness culture. In parallel to this, we are also interested\nin how subcultures centered on skinheads, neo-Nazis, and right-wing extremists influence and are connected to more general\npolitical transformations and opinions in contemporary society, blurring the distinction between subculture and common\nculture. The results indicate a complex relation between subcultures and the mainstreaming of certain values, opinions, and\npractices.\n",

Subculture takes\nshape in the space between surveillance and the evasion of\nsurveillance; it translates the fact of being under scrutiny into the\npleasure of being watched. It is a way of \"hiding in the light\"\nHebdige locates subcultures and the subcultural response\nsomewhere in between affirmation and refusal, commercial-\nization and revolt, and resistance and conformity. Hence,\nsubcultures are not automatically associated with a \"genu-\nine\" resistance to societal structures. Instead, they are under-\nstood as occupying and representing an ambivalent and\ncomplex position in society.\nThere are, of course, numerous ways of defining and posi-\ntioning subcultures. The concept has often been linked to\nnotions of spectacular and colorful youth cultures, such as\npunk culture, goths, mods, rockers, and skinheads.\nSubcultures also have a long history of being described and\ndefined in terms of \"deviance\"--something alien/outlandish\n2013). Of course, there is always a certain degree of disparity\nbetween specific subcultures and society at large. But this\ndoes not mean that the distinction between cultural elements\nthat are perceived as mainstream or common, on one hand,\nand elements/symbols/signs that are perceived as subcul-\ntural, on the other, is eternal. Rather, subcultures and com-\nmon culture change over time, and subcultures tend to\nbecome incorporated into what is referred to as main-\nstream--or common--culture. For example, during the\n1960s, the two discourses youth as problem and youth as fun\nmerged into youth as image (Hebdige, 1988). The politics of\nyouth is thus played out as a spectacle, and as consumption\nand lifestyles. Subcultures and youth cultures are, in other\nwords, constantly being drawn into a circulation of different\nsigns, images, and signified bodies.\nSubcultures are both objects of governmentality and sites\nfor pleasure, desire, and attention.

The\nterm mainstream has often been used to capture youth in\ngeneral, but there are of course reasons to be skeptical of this\nway of framing and generalizing about youth. Subcultures\nare not homogeneous and coherent, nor are youth in general.\nThis does not mean, however, that they are fluid, liquid, and\nephemeral. Rather, what is commonly referred to as main-\nstream or common culture is complex and constantly in\ntransformation, at the same time as it is also possible--para-\ndoxically enough--to understand mainstream culture in\nterms of hegemonic cultural formations.\nIn the present article, we will explore and elaborate on the\nconcept of subculture. We will use two rather different exam-\nples of subcultures, namely, bodybuilding and skinheads/\nneo-Nazis. We will depart from these two examples, which\nwill be presented as cases or examples of subcultures, to\npresent a theoretical exploration of our understanding of the\nconcept of subculture and common culture as well as the pro-\ncesses of marginalization and normalization. The main aim\nof the article is thus not to add new knowledge or research on\nthese subcultures per se; nor is the article to be understood as\na comparison of these two cultures, aimed at shedding light\non their differences and similarities. Instead, we aim to\nexplore the possibility of using the concept of subculture in\nrelation to the idea of a normalization of certain subcultural\nvalues, ideals and opinions. In the section on methodology,\nwe will further explain the rational for choosing these two\nsubcultures, and not others.\nOur focus is on the historical, symbolic, and biographical\nrelation between the subculture and the subcultural response,\non one hand, and sociopolitical transformations in society\nand culture, on the other. More precisely, we are interested in\nunderstanding how, for example, bodybuilding has moved\nback and forth, over time, between a subcultural position and\na more common fitness culture. We will here focus on the\nmore competitive and extreme aspects of this lifestyle-form-\ning subcultural practice, and on how individuals through\nmeasures such as muscle building, intentional dehydration,\nand elimination of body fat prepare their bodies to be evalu-\nated by a panel of judges in bodybuilding competitions. As a\nparallel to this, we are also interested in how subcultures cen-\ntered on skinheads, neo-Nazis, and right-wing extremists\ninfluence and are connected to more general political trans-\nformations and opinions in society. Although the focus of the\npresent article is mainly theoretical, our ambition is also to\ncontribute to methodological innovations in empirical analy-\nses of contemporary and influential subcultures. We will\nfocus on and explore the following areas in particular:\nResearch Question 1: How can we theoretically\napproach the historical development and transformation\nof subcultures?\nResearch Question 2: What values, ideals, and opinions\nare produced within subcultures, and how are they\nunderstood in relation to common culture and sociopoliti-\ncal structures?\nResearch Question 3: Using two examples of subcul-\ntures, in what ways can we theoretically understand the\ndynamic relation between subcultural content and identi-\nties, and how these also influence and partly contribute to\nforming more general cultural and social structures?\nWhile the first two research questions will mainly be\naddressed in the \"Exploring Two Subcultures\" section, where\nwe present our two examples of subcultures, the third ques-\ntion will be explored in the \"Conclusion and Discussion\"\nsection. In the following section, we will initially explain the\nconceptual framework of the article by focusing on the con-\ncept of subculture. Thereafter, we will present some method-\nological considerations.\nConceptual Framework--\nMainstreaming Subcultures\nThe concept of subculture has a long history in the social sci-\nences. It has been used to define and describe deviant behav-\nior, but also to talk about youth culture in terms of resistance\nto and subversion of norms. According to Blackman (2014),\nsubcultures are often considered barometers of contempo-\nrariness and expressions of underlying structural and cultural\ntransformations in society. One problem in many previous\nstudies of subculture has been a tendency to exclusively\nfocus on homologies, and on the ways in which subcultural\nstyles come together to form homogeneous totalities (Forn\u00e4s,\nacted by attending to the differences, tensions, and contradic-\ntions within and between subcultures and groups, which\nmore recent studies of social relations have shown constitute\nan increasingly important element of late-modern lifestyles\nnot repeat the ongoing discussion on different theoretical\napproaches to subcultures presented by different scholars,\nbut instead look more closely at some of the dividing lines in\ndiscourses on subcultures and subcultural responses (Martin,\nFirst, one central discussion on subcultures focuses on\nwhether the concept is viewed as transitional, fluid, and\ntransformative or, alternatively, as a more stable and homo-\ngeneous phenomenon. Criticism of the theories of subcul-\ntures coming from the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary\nCultural Studies (CCCS) targeted the centrality that was\nattributed to social class as well as CCCS scholars' attempts\nto find homologies within subcultures. The idea that youth\ncultures could be read as symbolic attempts to solve the\nproblems of adult culture, caused by transformations of the\nclass society in Britain, was challenged. To capture the more\nfleeting and mediated youth cultures of the 1990s, concepts\nsuch as neo-tribes, postsubcultures, and lifestyles were\nJohansson et al. 3\ndiscussion was, and still is, often strongly related to digital\nmedia and to \"do-it-yourself\" (DIY) youth movements\n(McArthur, 2009). As a reaction to this turn toward postsub-\ncultures, attempts have been made to find a balance between\nCCCS models of subcultures and postsubcultural theories\nseeing a return to class, and to new attempts to explore the\nrelations between subcultural style and taste and societal\ntransformations.\nSecond, subcultures are frequently seen as either expres-\nsions of deviance or as creative symbolic responses and reac-\ntions to dominant societal values. In theories of subcultures,\nwe often find an intrinsic distinction between subcultures\nand mainstream culture, or between subcultures and com-\nmon culture. Either way, there is a varyingly complex rela-\ntion between what is \"sub\" and what is dominant. According\nto Hebdige (1979), subcultures are successively incorporated\ninto and consumed by mainstream culture. However,\nHodkinson (2002) argued that this way of approaching the\nrelation between sub and dominance tends to undervalue the\ncontribution of the subculture. Following Hodkinson (2002),\nsubcultures are not homogeneous and stable phenomena, but\nhave a certain infrastructure and content. Subcultures offer a\nmeaningful identity, fulfillment, cultural and political par-\nticipation, and a transgression of dominant norms. Thus,\nthere is often a high level of distinctiveness and stability, in\nthe sense of collective identity, fostered within subcultures\n(Wheaton, 2007). Subcultures are frequently spectacular, but\nthere is also a strong relation to the mundane and to the youth\nbility, clarity, and pleasure expressed in subcultural styles\nand communities also serve to attract and recruit young peo-\nple to these kinds of groups. To keep attracting young people\nto the subculture, it always tends to keep a certain distance to\nmainstream culture, and although it is often incorporated into\nthe common culture, it also reinvents itself and returns from\nthe oppressed in various subversive and abject forms.\nFinally, subcultural research has often taken for granted\nthat this is exclusively a youth cultural phenomenon. Yet\ntoday punk culture, for example, cuts cross several genera-\ntions. Moreover, many influential subcultures are constituted\non an age hierarchy, where older members serve as founders\nand important role models. When we study subcultures, we\nare also focusing on the infrastructure of these communities.\nTo sum up, in line with our research questions, we will\nfocus on the relation between subcultures and societal and\nsociopolitical structures, using two carefully selected subcul-\ntures. We will use these subcultures to explore the dynamic\nrelation between subcultural content and identities and how\nthe subcultures also influence and partly contribute to form-\ning more general cultural and social structures, as well as the\ngenerational aspects of subcultures. Inspired by earlier dis-\ncussions of subcultures, we will feed some of the ideas\nemerging from such discussions into our exploration of two\nselected subcultures.\nMethodology and Research Design\nOur investigation of the two cases we chose to deepen and\ndevelop our exploration of subcultures in contemporary\nWestern societies will be based on interviews and research\non these subcultures and on our readings of secondary litera-\nture. Inspired by Resistance Through Rituals, we will use\nideas from this work to structure our analysis (Hall &\nJefferson, 1976). In their study, Hall and Jefferson distin-\nguish between three aspects or analytical levels: structures,\ncultures, and biographies. We will modify these aspects and\nadjust them to our study. Here, structures will be used to dis-\ncuss the formation of the subculture in relation to class, soci-\netal changes, and cultural transformation. We are inspired by\nthe CCCS approach to subcultures, but also by postsubcul-\ntural theories that point out the importance of social media in\nthe formation of contemporary subcultures. Cultures will be\nused to explore the symbolic and corporeal landscape of sub-\ncultures. Biographies will help us study how individual tra-\njectories and narratives are intertwined with and connected\nto the formation of subcultures. Consequently, using inter-\nview excerpts, we will capture how members of subcultures\nposition and understand their lifestyle choices and cultural\ncommunity in relation to the surrounding world.\nAs stated above, the present article should primarily be\nunderstood as theoretical and explorative in nature, although\nit rests in part on comprehensive empirical material gathered\nin different research projects on bodybuilding and neo-\nNazism by the authors over a period of several years. Here,\nthe empirical material is mainly used as an inspiration for our\nmore extensive and exploratory theoretical work. The ratio-\nnale for choosing these two case studies and examples is\npartly related to the authors' research interests, and partly to\nour collaborative discussions on how to theoretically\napproach two--in many ways--totally different subcultures.\nDiscovering that there actually exist a number of similarities\nand homologies regarding how these two subcultures\ndevelop, transform, and change led us on to writing this arti-\ncle, as well as the ambition to explore possibilities of devel-\noping subcultural theory in general.\nThe first subcultural case is the bodybuilding and fitness\nculture, and the material used comes from a larger ethno-\ngraphic study on bodybuilding and gym culture. Thirty-two\ncompetitive bodybuilders participated in the study. The par-\nticipants were mainly Swedish, although bodybuilders from\nother countries, such as the United States, also contributed\ntheir stories. This extensive empirical material have previ-\nously been analyzed in several articles and a book\nThe second case study is based on interviews from an\nongoing study on pedagogical strategies used to counteract\nNazism and racism in the classroom, and evaluation\n4 SAGE Open\ninterviews from an intervention program aimed at preventing\nrecruitment to White power gangs. The sample consists of\nfive interviews with former Nazi activists (conducted from\nOctober to December 2015 in the pedagogical strategy study)\nand another 12 interviews conducted in the intervention pro-\ngram (total 17 interviews). This is a part of an ongoing\nresearch project, and no results have been published earlier.\nIn our presentation, we have no desire to try to separate\nthe empirical material and secondary literature from the the-\noretical and conceptual frameworks. Rather we are treating\nand understanding our empirical material as already satu-\nrated in theory.\nUsing two diverse examples of subcultures, our ambition\nis to develop a theoretical and methodological understanding\nof and approach to subcultures. Regarding theory, we will\nfocus on how to approach the concept in terms of (a) subcul-\ntures' inner dynamics and structure, (b) dynamic relations\nbetween subcultures and common culture, and (c) genera-\ntional dynamics. Regarding methodology, as stated earlier,\nwe will look more closely at how we can investigate different\nsubcultures through (a) structures, (b) cultures, and (c) biog-\nraphies. Whereas our theoretical investigation will lead us to\nthe common dynamics and mechanisms in different subcul-\ntures, our methodological exploration will open up new ways\nof approaching this field of research. Our descriptions of the\ntwo subcultures will by necessity be quite short and sche-\nmatic, and our aim is not to deliver complete case studies, but\ninstead to indicate possible ways of writing about and pre-\nsenting subcultural transformations in contemporary\nsociety.\nExploring Two Subcultures\nFrom Bodybuilding to the Fitness Revolution\nThe idea of competent and muscular bodies found in contem-\nporary fitness culture can be traced back to what used to be\ncalled physical culture in the late 19th century and to the\nteachings of the forefathers of bodybuilding (Budd, 1997).\nAs a cultural phenomenon, however, contemporary body-\nbuilding is more connected to what happened in the 1970s, at\nGold's gym, Venice Beach, California (McKenzie, 2013). In\na relatively short period of time, Gold's Gym blossomed and\ndeveloped from a small, shabby, subcultural, and marginal\ngym into a 400-strong global franchise (Gaines & Butler,\nThe interest in bodybuilding, workout techniques, aero-\nbics, and fitness in general exploded starting from the 1970s\nand entering into the 1980s. Gradually, the understanding\nof this male dominated culture was renegotiated, and\nwomen also became involved. There are, of course, mani-\nfold explanations as to why this body-centered culture\ntransformed. Susan Jeffords situates this transformation in\nthe historical period of Reagan and Thatcher, war and\nnationalist movements.\nThe Reagan era was an era of bodies. From the anxieties about\nReagan's age and the appearance of cancerous spots on his nose;\nto the profitable craze in aerobics and exercise; to the moulding\nof a former Mr. Universe into the biggest box-office draw of the\ndecade; to the conservative agenda to outlaw abortion; to the\nidentification of \"value\" through an emphasis on drug use,\nsexuality, and child-bearing; to the thematized aggression\nagainst persons with AIDS--these articulations of bodies\nconstituted the imaginary of the Reagan agenda and the site of\nThe development within bodybuilding, from the 1970s\nand onward, can be interpreted as a zeitgeist and as an exam-\nple of how a subcultural practice is gradually both globalized\nand normalized in the common culture. The development\ntoward a global culture is accentuated by the mediatization\nof society, and the development of a global business enter-\nmen and women are involved, and previous connotations to\nmasculine working-class bodies are gradually replaced by a\nmore diffuse and broad inclusion of both working- and mid-\ndle-class participants. This does not mean, of course, that all\nclass and gender distinctions have been erased from the\nbodybuilding culture, but merely that from being a more\nexclusive sport, there has been a movement toward mass par-\nticipation in fitness. Sassatelli (2010) captured this develop-\nment in the following way:\nSince the 1970s there has been a marked increase in the number\nof exercise premises presenting themselves in a new guise. They\nhave addressed an increasingly large, mixed public. They have\nshifted the notion of the gym from a sub-cultural passion to a\nmass leisure activity, intertwined with pop culture. (p. 17)\nopment in the gym culture. For example, in 1991, there were\nindividuals exercised in these gyms, whereas at the begin-\nning of 1980s, gyms were few and visited primarily by a\nsmall group of enthusiasts and bodybuilder fans. However,\nparallel to this development, the reputation and popularity of\nbodybuilding have been negatively affected by the increas-\ning use of performance-/image-enhancing drugs, and the\nhealth problems associated with so-called distorted body\nimages. As a consequence, bodybuilding has gradually\nbecome disconnected from the more general development\nand trend of fitness gyms, and from a conception of the gym\nas a place for everyone and a mass leisure activity (Smith\nMaguire, 2008). This recent popularization of somewhat\nextreme cultural body ideals is an interesting period of time\nin which the techniques of building muscles and sculpting a\nperfect body were idealized, at the same time as the people\nembodying these techniques--bodybuilders--were not\n(Pope, Phillips, & Olivardia, 2000). One of our informants\ncaptures this process of marginalization, in which some ide-\nals, values, and knowledge on how to train the body are\nJohansson et al. 5\nrecognized and normalized, while other aspects of the cul-\nture are dismissed.\nWell I think it's a subculture everywhere now. Who wants to look\nlike a bodybuilder? I think here in the US, especially in the\norganization here, we are moving into bikini and figure\ncompetitions. They are trying to get a little more mainstream, like\nmen's physique for example. Obviously all these foreign countries\nare copying what we are doing here. Especially in European\ncountries I think that the fit model look is much more desirable.\nLook at the numbers of men's physique and bikini competitors;\nthey far outnumber everyone else, as far as the numbers of people\nparticipating. But I think it's much more tolerance here, aside\nfrom anabolic steroids that they love to arrest people for, no one is\nlike profiling people because they are big, and say let's arrest him\ncause he must be doing something wrong you know. In Sweden,\nyou know they can arrest you if think you are taking something or\nif you look too big. It's really bad. (David Palumbo)\nDavid \"Dave\" Palumbo is a retired American elite level\nbodybuilder, living in New York. He is currently running a\nsuccessful company within the bodybuilding domain, selling\nsupplements, and producing radio and Internet shows cover-\ning relevant news and events from a global bodybuilding\nscene. He also coaches professional bodybuilders and figure\nand fitness competitors and can thus be said to have high\nsymbolic capital within the bodybuilding culture. Following\nhis narrative, it becomes clear how bodybuilding has succes-\nsively been detached from a more general fitness trend.\nThe cultural and gradual separation between bodybuilding\nas a subculture and fitness does not mean that these phenom-\nena have become two different activities and lifestyles. These\nconceptions of exercise and lifestyles are partly disconnected\nfrom each other and partly becoming increasingly dependent\non each other. This double-edginess can also be exemplified\nby one of the most influential persons in bodybuilding cul-\nture, namely, Arnold Schwarzenegger. On one hand, after his\ncareer as a bodybuilder, Schwarzenegger became involved in\nmainstream films, the Hollywood industry, and he also\nbecame highly influential in American politics. This was cen-\ntral to imbuing excessive muscularity with the hyper-visibil-\nity that presented the bodybuilder as a figure of staggering\npower (Locks & Richardson, 2012). On the other hand, at the\npeak of his career, Schwarzenegger was the greatest body-\nbuilder competitor ever seen, and as such he was clearly\nviewed, to some extent, as freakish by the standards of parts\nof the general public. According to Locks and Richardson\n(2012), Schwarzenegger's impact on the culture was to intro-\nduce a postclassic aesthetic era, in which competitive body-\nbuilders could no longer be compared with Greek art, which\nsymbolizes proportion, symmetry, and order.\nIt is ironic that the very person who helped provide bodybuilding\nwith its greatest publicity since the turn of the last century\nshould be largely responsible for encouraging the aesthetic that\nhas severed professional bodybuilding from much of its classical\nlineage, thereby promoting a look that would ostracize it again\nfrom the mainstream that it (and Schwarzenegger) had just been\nadmitted to . . . Many outside professional bodybuilding, who\nare not used to seeing such bodies (particularly during periods of\ncompetition), feel that professional bodybuilders take the ideals\nof bodily perfection to such an extreme that these very attributes\nbegin to reverse themselves. The mesomorphic body shape,\nwhich came to be so prized in the visual discourse, has become\na \"freakish\" image that has shock value. (Locks & Richardson,\nOver time, bodybuilding and its status have changed and\ntransformed. At the beginning of the 20th century and again\nin the 1970s, bodybuilding attained high status, and in cer-\ntain countries, for example, the United States, it was not at all\na subculture, but rather something of a masculine mass\nmovement. Today, bodybuilding is often described and stud-\nied as a subculture, associated with extreme bodies and drugs\nAt the same time, bodybuilders are highly visible in com-\nmon culture (Bridges, 2009). A large number of international\nmagazines are devoted entirely to the art of bodybuilding.\nThere are many books and manuals on the market that offer\ntraining programs for bodybuilding, and through different\norganizations, such as The International Federation of\nBodybuilding and Fitness (IFBB), bodybuilding has become a\nglobal enterprise and sport that clearly extends beyond the\nconcept of subculture. Pumping iron at the gym certainly char-\nacterizes the lifestyle of the bodybuilder, but may also be part\nof the lifestyle of the average person trying to improve his or\nher own health. Moreover, elite athletes also commonly use\nbodybuilding techniques in their attempts to become better at\ntheir sport and more competitive. Consequently, although con-\ntemporary representations of bodybuilding bodies are not\nunproblematic and the bodybuilder often is viewed as some-\nthing of a freak in everyday life situations, the huge muscular\nmale and female body, the lifestyle this body represents, the\ntechniques used and developed within bodybuilding, the disci-\npline, the supplementary knowledge, and more are also highly\nvalued/idealized in contemporary society. This becomes very\nclear when we look at the development of fitness culture in\nrecent decades and the techniques used to strengthen the body\nwithin modern competitive sports. It could be argued that the\nfreakishness of contemporary bodybuilding might actually be\nbetter characterized as a societal development than a subcul-\ntural one. In sum: The fitness revolution--evolving as a mass\nenterprise, washing off the stamp of the more grotesque parts\nof bodybuilding culture, the drugs, and the extreme cult of the\nhuge muscular body--has also led in one respect to the devel-\nopment of a more uniform and homogeneous global gym and\nfitness culture, and in another respect to glocal variations in\nthe adaptation of this culture. Parallel to this development,\nhowever, bodybuilders today also tend to become even more\nextreme, using steroids to boost their bodies, trying to reassert\ntheir positions as subcultural and as something totally different\nfrom the fitness bodies.\n6 SAGE Open\nFrom Skins and Neo-Nazi Subcultures to Neo-\nConservatism\nIn this case study, we will follow a path stretching from the\nBritish skinheads toward neo-Nazi subcultures and the\ndevelopment of right-wing and neo-conservative political\nparties in contemporary Europe.\nSkinhead style had its origins in South and East London's\nworking-class districts in the mid- to late 1960s (Ware &\nclass adolescents from the poorer parts of society. The skins\nperceived hippies as lazy and dirty, and they despised\neverything about them (Brake, 1974). Their style was very\nspectacular, with Doc Marten boots, cropped and bald hair-\nstyles, and tight Levi jeans. According to Ware and Back\nsocial movements such as gay rights and feminism. This\nstyle was distinguished by its heterosexual, working-class,\nmasculine, and aggressive symbolism. Ware and Back\nclaim that two maxims held this culture together: the recov-\nery of Englishness/Britishness and the striving for White\nauthenticity. In the early days, skinhead culture was charac-\nterized by a strange mixture of open racism and nationalism\nand hybridity and openness to a diversity of cultural\ninfluences.\nIn an early study of 50 skinheads in East London, certain\nkey values and interests were laid out by the sociologist Mike\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Toughness and violence: Skinheads seemed obsessed\nwith violence and a macho culture, worshiping mus-\ncles, hardness, and aggressive behavior.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Football: Skinheads were solid supporters of their\nnational team, and had a passionate attachment to\ntheir local club.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Ethnocentrism: The subculture was heavily inclined\nto hold racist attitudes and to despise homosexuals\nand others who threatened their sense of Britishness.\nHowever, their racism was initially complex, and sev-\neral skinhead groups had Afro-Caribbean members.\nThis changed later on, however.\nments of skinhead culture converged and were drawn into\nthe British Movement and the National Front.\nThe political affiliations of skins were signified by the color of\nthe laces worn in their characteristic Doc Marten boots: white\nlaces indicated support for the National Front, and red laces\nattested British Movement affiliation. This was mirrored in the\nmusical tastes with the emergence of the postpunk Oi! music\nscene with bands like Sham 69 and the Cockney Rejects, while\nthe National Front sponsored White Noise Music Club, set up by\ntwo key young fascist activists, Patrick Harrington and Nick\nGriffin, and British Nazi musician Ian Stuart Donaldson in 1979.\nexported to several European countries, among them Sweden\nand Norway. In this transnational diffusion and transmission\nof skinhead culture, two things remained intact: nationalism\nand national chauvinism as well as White pride, on one hand,\nand a language of racist rhetoric, on the other.\nAccording to Fangen (1998), the right wing of the skin-\nhead subculture has had clear representatives in Europe and\nthe United States since the late 1980s. Although there are\nstrong affiliations and connections between skinhead culture\nand Nazism, there are also certain differences. The subculture\nharbors aggression toward immigrants and homosexuals sim-\nilar to that of Nazism, but it differs from Nazism in its oppo-\nsitional attitude toward authority. Fangen (1998) interviewed\n40 persons active in the Norwegian skinhead subculture in the\n1990s. She found, among other things, that they idealized\nimages of past communities and traditions. The skinheads did\nnot celebrate ambivalence and multitudes of identities, but\ninstead ethnic heritage and a nostalgic longing for stability\nand traditions. The fantasy world of the primarily male skin-\nheads is filled with rigid us-them categories, aggressions\ntoward immigrants, and images of themselves as warriors in a\nrace war. Similar patterns have also been found in studies of\nskinheads in Germany and Finland (Perho, 2000).\nIn a study on ex-neo-Nazis in Scandinavia, the American\nsociologist Michael Kimmel (2007) found both similarities\nand differences between Scandinavian and American skin-\nheads and neo-Nazis. The Scandinavian adolescents--\nmostly young men--committed to skinhead culture during a\nperiod of their life and used it as a rite of passage, whereas\nthe American skinheads were more committed to racialized\nideologies. According to the Scandinavian Skinheads who\nleft the subculture, this had been a rite passage for alienated\nand insecure adolescent males. Another difference lies in the\nactive and central role played by women in American groups\non the far right.\nis evolving and developing. Three types of development are\nvisible: (a) the adaptation of skinhead culture and values to\nthe local and national political culture, (b) the increased net-\nworking and internationalization of skinhead and neo-Nazi\nsubculture, and (c) the commercialization and commodifica-\ntion of skinhead culture (Campbell, 2006; Sela-Shayovitz,\n2011). To describe the development from subculture to main-\nstreaming, we will look more closely at the Swedish case.\nThe White power movement was established in Sweden\nduring the early 1990s. It was a result of a blending between\nthe traditional Nazi organizations, the skinhead culture, and\nan influence from American White supremacy ideology. The\nWhite power movement became a subculture of its own\nthanks to its rituals, use of symbols, production of aesthetics,\nand certainly its production of ideology. But it was never a\nuniform subculture, as it produced diverse expressions within\nits domains and simultaneously struggled to exclude diver-\nsity. The skinhead culture is a clear example of this. The\nJohansson et al. 7\nskinheads were an essential part of the White power culture,\nnot least as consumers of White power music. In this case,\nthey were indeed needed to maintain financial sustainability.\nThey were also appreciated as \"bodyguards\" during rallies\nand other forms of public manifestations. At the same time,\nfor the more political parts of the White power movement,\nthey were unpredictable and uncontrollable. Their use of vio-\nlence and alcohol often resulted in an undesired bad image\nthe skinhead culture became crucial in the early 1990s when\nthe universal formation of the White power movement\nrecruited its followers in local communities without these\nlocal groups having had any earlier relations with key per-\nsons in the movement. Through the aesthetics of the skin-\nhead culture, newcomers found an easy and clearly\nunderstood way to portray themselves as members of the\nWhite power movement. For some of its members, this has\nbeen described as a passing stage in their later more pro-\nfound engagement into Nazism (Fangen, 1998). In the study\nmentioned earlier, Anders, a former Nazi activist, says the\nfollowing:\nI first got involved in the movement via \"Vikingrock\" music. I\napproached a guy who I knew also liked this music and he was\na skinhead. So I tried my best to look like him, cut my hair, put\non boots and a \"Bomber\" jacket without more consideration\nthan that I wanted to fit in with him and that others should see\nme as connected to him and, yes the skinhead culture. It was\nonly later that this brought me to a broader group of people,\nskinheads but also others in the movement where I got my\npolitical awareness and joined a Nazi party. (Anders)\nThere were several attempts to form a solid base for a\nstrong attack on the multicultural within this milieu. These\nefforts stretched from ideas about armed struggles, even war,\nto relatively pragmatic parliamentary attempts. In all cases,\nthe attempts ultimately aimed at a profound change in the\nsociety, where nationalistic and/or race hierarchies were to\nbe reestablished. This struggle emerged in a context where\nindividuals were drifting between informal social formations\nand organized activities and parties.\nAccording to the former Nazi activist Anders, he and his\ncomrades adapted their cultural expressions to how they\ninterpreted the context:\nAfter my period as a skinhead and when I became more political,\nI also adapted my style to the political struggle, both my clothing\nand behaviour, at least when we were in public. In this process I\nstarted considering how I should behave to have maximum\noutput when we were trying to attract newcomers but also\nwithout losing the style that was us. (Anders)\nBy the end of the 1990s, the skinhead culture rapidly\ndeclined, and at the same time, the split between the race-\nideological part of the movement and the more pragmatic\nparliamentary part became definitive. Until the mid-1990s,\nthe Swedish Democratic Party (SD) frequently used skin-\nheads as \"bodyguards,\" but this ceased during the second\nhalf of the 1990s. In the skinhead culture as well as the White\npower movement as a whole, it was common to see this\nchange as a betrayal on the part of the SD. The definitive\nbreak between the pragmatic parliamentary groups and the\nWhite power movement was strongly related to the latter\ngroups' experiences of their inability to reach out to people\noutside the current movement (L\u00f6\u00f6w, 2015). This break was\ncompleted on an organization level before the turn of the mil-\nlennium, but it is clear that, within the White power move-\nment, there is still positive identification with the later\nsuccess of the SD. The leading Nazi organization in Sweden,\n\"The Nordic Resistance Movement,\" held a poll on their web\npage after the parliamentary election of 2014. They asked\nreaders whether or not the growing support for the SD would\nbenefit the Swedish people, and of the 1,144 responses, more\nThis, together with similar polls and articles in the White\npower media, is only an indication of the still lasting rela-\ntions or identifications between the former comrades from\nTo understand the current political structure of the SD, it\nis crucial to look beyond the development of organizations\nand ideologies within the contemporary history of the\nextreme right. The SD has emerged from a subcultural con-\ntext that depends on the White power movement, where they\nshare the experience of a continuous struggle between defin-\ning a position and achieving social and political recognition.\nToday SD has become normalized and gradually a part of the\ndemocratic system, whereas some of their earlier affiliates--\nas for example, The Nordic Resistance Movement--have\nbecome radicalized and gradually more militant and extreme.\nConclusion and Discussion\nThe mass media present deviants as oddities that are seen as\ndisrupting the orderly universe. Their contra-cultural values and\nbehaviour are described using lurid details, thus reassuring the\nreader that normality exists--that ordinary, decent, everyday\nvalues are intact. It was in this way that the racism found\nthroughout English society was perceived and reported as the\nidiosyncratic behaviour of a small group of violent teenagers,\nattributing racist and anti-homosexual beliefs. The appertaining of\nracism and homosexuality to a small group missed the fact that\nthese attitudes were widely spread throughout all classes of\npolitical climate. At the same time, it indicated to skinheads in the\nprovinces that, in order to be a righteous skinhead, you had to\nIn his classic study on skinheads, Mike Brake strongly\nemphasized the bridges and connections between subcultural\nprocesses, expressions, values, and styles and the similar\nsentiments and values existing in society at large. In the pres-\nent article, we have discussed the concept of subculture, on\none hand, and applied and elaborated on this discussion in\n8 SAGE Open\nrelation to two carefully selected examples of subcultures, on\nthe other. Ours is primarily an explorative study, aimed at\nextending and developing ideas on how subcultures and sub-\ncultural processes connect and support more general societal\nand cultural transformations. In addition, we also want to\npoint out possible ways of methodologically exploring sub-\ncultural phenomena.\nRegarding theory, our ambition has been to reconnect to\nthe CCCS and the concept of subcultures. However, we also\nwish to use insights and theoretical developments from post-\nsubcultural theories. Instead of looking at subcultures as\nfluid and as in constant transition, we focus on the relation\nbetween subcultural styles and values and societal and cul-\ntural transformations. Looking at the two present case stud-\nies, it is obvious that there are bridges and connections\nbetween the values and opinions cultivated within the sub-\ncultural framework and more general sociocultural and polit-\nical developments in society.\nExploring the relation between subcultures and the main-\nstreaming of certain values, opinions, and practices, we can\nsee how subcultural values and sentiments tend to turn into\nmore accepted and normalized ways of relating to the body,\nhealth, and politics. Deviance is turned into \"normality,\" and\nalthough some parts and contents of subcultures are toned\ndown, core points and values are extracted and generalized.\nBodybuilding has transformed into fitness, but the core val-\nues of hard bodies, muscle training, health, and asceticism\nare highly present in the fitness culture, as well as in more\ncommon and dominant sociocultural patterns in, for exam-\nple, Sweden and the United States. What is interesting here is\nthe process through which common culture is gradually wid-\nened and, in some sense, incorporates particular lifestyle\nattributes and values.\nHowever, the process of normalization does not mean that\nthe complete subcultural content is incorporated and swal-\nlowed up. Rather there is some discrimination regarding what\nkind of subcultural content can leak out of the subcultural\nmilieu and be absorbed. Body techniques, discipline, and\nknowledge about how to transform the body are being incor-\nporated into fitness culture, and consequently being trans-\nformed, marketed, and commercialized. At the same time,\ncertain bodies are framed as too extreme, connected to\nunhealthy lifestyles, to drugs, and to narcissism, thus being\nmarginalized from the more public domains of fitness culture.\nIn a similar vein, the core values and sentiments of skinhead\nand right-wing subcultures--xenophobia and nationalism--\nare currently becoming part of the political culture in many\nEuropean countries. At the same time, xenophobia and\nnationalism are often framed in terms of racism and, thereby,\nexcluded from the public culture.\nWhen addressing questions regarding subcultures, we often\nimmediately think about young people and youth culture. If we\nstudy contemporary subcultures, it becomes apparent that there\nare strong intergenerational connections and roots in previous\nsubcultural formations. Many leading profiles are middle-aged\nor older. To study subcultures, we need to contextualize and\ninvestigate both the complex and contradictory structure and\ncontent of these \"cultures,\" as well as the hierarchical relations\ninvolved in organizing subcultures.\nRegarding methodology, we can also draw some conclu-\nsions from the present exploratory study. First, subcultures\nshould be positioned in relation to certain societal transfor-\nmations. Subcultural expressions and styles become signifi-\ncant and worth studying when they are situated in particular\nhistorical periods of time and in relation to societal changes\naffecting the balance between what is subcultural and what is\n\"common.\" Reading the cultural level in relation to these\nfundamental societal changes also leads us to interesting\nanalyses of how the more ephemeral aspects of subcul-\ntures--such as styles, clothes, values, and artifacts--can be\nunderstood as parts of more general transformations in soci-\nety. Listening to voices, narratives, and expressions of desire\nat the biographical level also directs us to microtransforma-\ntions of the subjective content in subcultures and in society.\nAlthough our ambition has not been to compare the two\nsubcultures, or to include them in a more elaborated analysis\nof contemporary society, in the next step, there is, of course,\na possibility to start mapping out a more general understand-\ning on how different contemporary subcultures connect both\nto each other and to more general transformations in society.\nSubcultures speak to us, signal changes, and disturb our\nunderstanding of what is \"normal\" versus \"deviant\" in trou-\nbling ways. Using subcultures as seismographs, we can gain\nnew insights into the interplay between the subversive and\nthe \"normal,\" and also sharpen our theoretical tools and pos-\nsibilities of studying social and cultural change.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAndreasson, J., & Johansson, T.
