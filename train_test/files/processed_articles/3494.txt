A multisensory exhibition of\nphotographs and soundscape was utilized to achieve the objective. The photographs provided the visual stimulus while\nsoundscape accompanied the images to provide an aural map of the area being documented. Both media helped in the\nmeaning-making process. The area documented was the center of Davao City, Philippines--San Pedro Street--as it cradles\nthe center of faith, the seats of power, and the center of commerce. But, with urban decay, this place seemed to lose its\nformer glory. With the visual and aural stimuli, these stories (memories) embedded in the mind of the lookers are culled.\nThis is the meaning-making process.\n",

Such is the case of Davao City,\nPhilippines. With the various infrastructural developments\nand plans, it can be observed that the overall development of\nthe city is moving away from its center.\nWhat Is the City's Center?\nLocal historians and other residents consider San Pedro\nStreet as the city's center for several reasons. According to\nDelgado (2005), the street is home to several social land-\nmarks in the city aside from it being the central business dis-\ntrict. These are the San Pedro Cathedral, Davao City Hall,\nand several parks that provided a busy atmosphere. The\ndesign of the whole area was patterned after Spanish Town\nPlazas as most of the sociocivic institutions were built in this\nToday, San Pedro Street still has San Pedro Cathedral as\nthe center of Catholic faith, the Sangguniang Panlungsod and\nthe Davao City Hall as seats of power, the commercial estab-\nlishments owned by old and new families residing in the city,\nthe Osme\u00f1a Park, and the Rizal Park.The Museo Dabawenyo,\na government-managed venue for art exhibitions for local\nand visiting artists, is also located near San Pedro Street\n(Figure 1).\nAside from that, San Pedro Street is full of irony. Despite\nthe glaring presence of religion and government in the area,\nit has become a melting pot for illegal trade and some\nimmoral acts. Businesses are sprawling away from this area\nand infrastructures looked old as well. The younger genera-\ntion somehow forgot what the historical relevance of this\narea is. The adults seemed to accept the fact that what remains\nrelevant in this area is purely trade while its other landmarks,\nthose that either carries the seat of power or religion, are\nbecoming less relevant.\nGiven this scenario, a creative work project was mounted\nto know the relevance of San Pedro Street to the community.\nIt showcased several photographs with accompanying\nsoundscape to recreate the area. Together with the lookers of\nthe exhibition, the photographer conducted a simultaneous\nmeaning-making activity.\nQualitative meaning-making or reception studies, as\nopposed to quantitative reception studies that aim to predict,\nare considered relevant as this will aid in planning as the\nmeanings lookers give can provide planners and policy mak-\ners the areas' relevance to cultural identity.\n1University of the Philippines Mindanao, Davao City, Philippines\nCorresponding Author:\nDennis John Sumaylo, Assistant Professor, University of the Philippines\nMindanao, Bago-Oshiro, Mintal, Davao City, Davao del Sur 8022,\nPhilippines.\nEmail: dsumaylo@gmail.com\nMeaning-Making Exercise Using Images\nand Soundscape: The Case of San Pedro\nStreet, Davao City, Philippines\nMa. Teresa Escano1 and Dennis John Sumaylo1\n Keywords\nvisual communication, street photography, visual rhetoric, soundscape, multimodal meaning-making, urban planning, heritage\nsite conservation\n2 SAGE Open\nTheoretical Underpinnings\nThe theoretical underpinning for this production includes\nVisual Narrative Theory of Gretchen Barbatsis guided by\nAldous Huxley's The Art of Seeing.\nAccording to Aldous Huxley, the general visual process\ninvolves four stages. These are Sense, Select, Perceive, and\nRemember. Sensing is defined as the detection of any visual\nstimuli while selecting is the process of focusing on one\naspect of the entire visual stimuli detected. Perceiving, on the\ncontrary, is the stage when a looker tries to make sense of the\nselected visual stimuli. This can be done by retrieving past\nexperiences or knowledge about the selected visual stimuli.\nAfter perceiving comes remembering as the perceived mean-\ning of the visual stimuli can be stored and retrieved for future\nuse. This, in general, is the main objective of a visual com-\nmunicator. It is not merely the creation of images that matters\nbut the creation of powerful images that would make the\nlooker remember its contents (Lester, 2006).\nThe creation of powerful images is grounded on the story\nit tells. Ideally, when we talk of stories, it always has a begin-\nning, middle, and end arranged in a manner that one action\nwill trigger a reaction that would lead to its climax and then\neventually to its rightful end. In the context of visual narra-\ntive, what is important is the balance between pictorial con-\ntent and pictorial syntax or its descriptive and literal structures.\nSimplified, the descriptive structure will tell the looker what\nthe story is. It describes what is in the picture. The descriptive\nstructure is the subject matter of the photograph. On the con-\ntrary, literal structure includes the rules and conventions of\nvisual elements. This includes spatial relations such as angle\nand depth of field. Simplified, the literal structure is providing\nhow the story is being told (Barbatsis, 2005).\nThe theory of Visual Rhetoric of Sonja K. Foss almost\nposits the same thing. Foss (2005) said that the nature of\nvisual rhetoric has two components: presented and sug-\ngested elements. Presented elements include space, media,\nshapes, and so on, while suggested elements are concepts,\nideas, themes, and allusions. The function of the image is to\ncommunicate the action and that the perceptions of the\nlookers are independent from its creator. Foss believes that\nimage should be treated as a form of language and that is\nthe language visual communicators use to be understood.\nCreative Methodology/Process\nA multisensory exhibit was conducted to document the\nchanges in what is used to be the heart of Davao City--San\nPedro Street. It was an exhibit that let the looker See, Hear,\nand Feel San Pedro Street as they walk through it.\nOne of the goals of this exhibit was to highlight the street\nin Davao City that cradles several landmarks--the San Pedro\nStreet. By capturing it in still photographs, lookers may be\nable to reexamine the details of the place and experience it in\na different perspective. By using visual images, this exhibit\nshowed the culture of the people of Davao City and further\ndefined San Pedro Street with the help of the lookers.\nDefining San Pedro Street through meaning-making\nactivity was the second goal of this exhibition. It was done\nbecause almost always the photographer has the tendency to\npresent a subject according to the photographer's point of\nview, moral judgments, and experience forgetting that the\nlookers carry their own point of view, moral judgments, and\nexperiences as they view an image.\nWith these goals in mind and with the nature of the exhi-\nbition being multisensorial, the photographer planned sev-\neral memory triggers to help in the meaning-making process.\nThese are images, sounds, and the celebration of Araw ng\nDabaw, an annual festival, that commemorates the city's\ncharterhood.\nFinally, the exhibition billed Urban Sights and Sounds:\nThe Stories of San Pedro Street (USAS) was held inside a\nshopping mall.\nFigure 1. Google Map photo of the area covered by the exhibition.\nEscano and Sumaylo 3\nOn Photography\nPhotography has been used in documenting many aspects of\ndren almost always own a camera.\nToday, the same methodology has been used to document\nthe life in the city. Naegele and Baur (2004) documented big\nand small cities' public spaces, which are often thought of as\nmundane and often neglected. This \"pictorial archive\" tried\nto capture the \"elusive smells and flavours in order to hand\nthem back to the people of the cities and their world.\" Kugler\n(2009), who documented New York City as part of the\nMegapolis Tour series, presented New York's \"landscape--\nits architecture, its youth, its feel, its trends and movement\"\nfrom his own perspective, personal view, and style including\nblurry images of the Upper and Lower East Side, Grand\nCentral Station, and West Broadway to name a few while\nCoughlin (1998) documented the same city using sepia-\ntoned images for elegance. Baechtold (2006) took on a new\nconcept of creating a completely visual travel guide of\nAfghanistan by using maps and photographs. Baechtold's\ncreative premise lay on his idea that \"one good photograph\nand an address are enough to point the intrepid traveller in\nthe right direction.\" (blurb)\nThe same idea was used to document San Pedro Street of\nDavao City, Philippines. The project tried to document the\nthen center of the city as Davao continues to grow outward.\nIt tried to use visual cues (photographs) as stimulus to cap-\nture the lookers' experiences, their personal stories in\nthe former center of the city. This part of the multisensorial\nexhibition provided the seeing component of USAS.\nFurthermore, the photographs used in USAS also coincides\nwith Nagar's (2012) argument that \"street is a unique genre\nof photography\" that looks for \"expression, beauty, and\nsocial interaction in seemingly banal surroundings.\" (p. 10)\nSzarkowski's five characteristics were considered.\nSzarkowski as mentioned in Barrett (1990) considered the\nthing itself, the detail, the frame, time, and vantage point that\nmake photography unique. To achieve this, 22 descriptive\u00ad\ninterpretive photographs were used depicting the landmarks,\npeople, and trade of the street. Descriptive photographs, as\ndefined by Barrett, offers \"descriptive, visual information,\nwith greater or lesser detail and clarity,\" while interpretive\nphotographs try to explain phenomenon in a \"personal and\nWith these characteristics, photograph type, and categori-\nzation, the table below summarizes the shot list and actual\nnumber of photographs used in USAS, and its general\ncharacteristics.\nThis process of categorization of photographs followed the\ntenets of visual narrative theory posited by Gretchen Barbatsis\n(2005). According to Barbatsis, a visual narrative follows two\nstructures. These are descriptive and literal or discursive struc-\ntures. Under the descriptive structure, the visual narrative\nintroduces the characters, settings, and actions of the images\nmade whereas the literal structure is more focused on the com-\npositional patterns of spatial relations or the rules and\nTable 1. Shot List and Photo Description.\nCategory Photograph type Number of photos Characteristics\nLandmarks Descriptive photographs 3 The photos were taken at low-angle to show implied height of\nlandmarks. Moreover, as lines as a visual element have expressive\nvalues, vertical, horizontal, and oblique lines were utilized to show\nstrength, balance, power, and stability. The photos in this category\nshowcased the San Pedro Cathedral, the Sangguniang Panlungsod,\nand the City Hall of Davao.\nTrade Interpretive photographs 11 Pictures in this category were depicted both with and without human\nsubjects. An empty space was important to highlight a certain kind\nof human interaction. It also showed the unusual way of peddling\nproducts. In these photographs, one will see both the product and\nthe way sellers peddled these products. (Nagar, 2012)\nThe photos in this category included food vendors, outdoor flower\nshops, religious products, second hand stores, and even those who\nsell shade for their motorcycles, the iconic jeepney, and illegal items\nsuch as knock-off movies and music, and other items.\nPeople Descriptive\u00adinterpretive\nphotographs\n8 This category also showed the kinds of people who frequented the\narea which included local government officials during work, kids\nat the park, and passersby. The photographer utilized both close-\nup and long shots, balanced and asymmetrical subject matters, in\nmostly high-key lighting to define the spatial relationship between the\nlooker and the subject matter. We tend to stand closer to children\ntherefore close-up shots were used while we stay far from people\nwho hold position, therefore long shots were utilized for the city\nofficials.\n4 SAGE Open\nFigure 2.Trade.\nconventions of making images that dictates how an image can\nbe used as a language to communicate.\nUsing the shower\u00adshowee dichotomy of the theory, the\nshower organizes different visual and pictorial elements (lit-\neral structure) into a coherent story so that the showee would\nbe able to come up with a meaning similar or related to the\noriginal intention of the shower. One way to achieve this is to\nuse a certain pictorial point of view.\nIn Table 1, landmarks and trade were taken with an\nobserving point of view. The composition of each scene indi-\ncated that the shower is \"somewhat omniscient\" looking at\nthe subject from the outside. The category on people used \"a\nparticipating point of view\" as the shower was already part\nof the world of the story. It means that there was a shift of\nposition from \"looking at\" to \"looking into\" (Barbatsis,\n2005). The shift of position was very literal as most of the\nphotographs under the category people were tightly com-\nposed trying to decrease the distance between the shower and\nthe subject leading to a certain level of visual intimacy\nbetween the two (see Figures 2 and 3).\nOn Soundscape\nUsing two of Schafer's terminologies, the soundscape of\nUSAS featured both sound signals and soundmarks. Sound\nsignals are \"foreground sounds intended to attack attention\"\nwhile the term soundmark is used as an analogy for landmark\nWrightson (2000) further discussed that the terminologies\ncoined by Schafer express the identity of a certain commu-\nnity. It does not only showcase its architecture, people, and\nculture. These three are also packaged in the form of sound-\nscapes. Therefore, soundscapes, as described by Truax cited\nin Wrightson (2000), acts as \"mediator between listener and\nthe environment.\"\nIn the context of USAS, the soundscape created to accom-\npany the photographs tried to stay true to the sound of the old\ncity center without major alterations except adding fade-in\nand fade-out and a little manipulation on the volume per sec-\ntion. The increase and decrease of volume levels of certain\nparts in the soundscape can act as a way to attract lookers and\nat the same time be an unobtrusive background as lookers\nscan the photographs.\nIn the creation of the accompanying soundscape of USAS,\nthe goal was to gather different actual soundscapes and then\nmix them together to create aural chaos during the exhibi-\ntion. The recreation of the actual chaos followed a careful\nplanned recording that allowed the lookers to retrace their\nsteps as they walked around the exhibition area as if they\nwere actually walking along San Pedro Street.\nTo achieve this, certain sounds were removed and high-\nlighted through varying lengths and volume to give an aural\ncue to the looker where he or she was at that moment in San\nPedro Street. The noise of traffic was also reduced in the\nsoundscape as it is the most obvious auditory signal you get\nwhen you are in the area. Moreover, the curved design of the\npanel boards representing the street and the low ceiling of the\nexhibition area also functioned as external resonators of the\nsoundscape. These external resonators amplified the sound-\nscape, which functioned both as sound signals and sound-\nmarks. The sound system used was an assembled speaker\nsold in the area and it was placed near the panel board\nintended for the stories gathered. This literal reproduction of\nexisting urban sounds provided the aural context of USAS.\nThis aural context can be described using Mermoz's\n(2004) concept of sonic layering. In Mermoz's Istanbul Sound\nDiary, sonic layering was accidental of his own \"dialogue\nwith an interviewee with that of other voices, street sounds,\nand call to prayer.\" (pp. 23-25) However, in USAS, its sonic\nlayering was intentional. The actual recording happened on\nEscano and Sumaylo 5\nthe street and within the halls of the landmarks mentioned.\nConversations with people and clips of conversation of other\npeople were included. A council session of the local officials\nand a celebration of a Catholic mass were also part of the\nsoundscape. Details of the content of the soundscape are pre-\nsented in Table 2 and the succeeding discussions.\nThe intention of the first 9 minutes was to introduce the\ncity aurally through the voice of then Vice Mayor of Davao\nCity and now President of the Republic of the Philippines,\nRodrigo R. Duterte. Several details of the City Council ses-\nsion were included in this part of the soundscape. After the\nusual pleasantries of the Vice Mayor, the session started with\na prayer. In the soundscape, three different types of prayers\nwere included. These are ecumenical prayer, Muslim prayer,\nand Lumad (Indigenous Peoples) prayer. The singing of the\nCity Hymn immediately followed and the presiding officer\nof the city council called the session to order after the secre-\ntary announced that there was a quorum. After the call to\norder, the Official Exit Call of the head of Task Force Davao\nfollowed. The breakdown of the first 9 min is as follows:\nPrayer\nThese were given importance as these are the things that\nmake Davao City one of the safest places to live in the world.\nThe City also protects its culture and its tri-people making\nsure that they are represented in the highest governing body\nof the city.\nAfter the first 9 min, a recording of an ongoing celebra-\ntion of Catholic mass immediately followed. The duration of\nthe introduction of the second landmark--San Pedro\nwhich, the soundscape started introducing the vendors out-\nside the church to \"show\" through aural cues the trade aspect\nof the area. Recordings of conversations between vendors\nand customers were also included. However, in this part of\nthe soundscape, the volume for the Catholic mass and the\nvolume of the vendors were made sure to be at the same level\nto \"show\" how close they were to each other.\nAlso included in the soundscape were sounds of foot-\nsteps and the increasing and decreasing volume of certain\nFigure 3.

For instance, in 21:55, the\nsound of the Catholic mass acted as bed music in low vol-\nume while the conversation of food and Ukay-ukay (sur-\nplus) vendors was presented in high volume. Then, another\nseries of footsteps were introduced further diminishing the\nsound of the Catholic mass and the food and ukay-ukay\n(surplus) vendors but introducing a new product in the\narea--massage, pedicure, and manicure. With these high-\nlighted soundscape, it brought the lookers to another area in\nSan Pedro Street, which is Rizal Park. Going deeper into\nthe park, the previous sounds then became bed for another\nproduct of San Pedro Street--bamboo flute. This time, the\nsound of the bamboo flute was used as sound signals to get\nthe attention of possible lookers in the exhibit area. This\nwas intentionally done at the high notes of each excerpt of\na music piece played.\nFurthermore, the photographer's movement, signified by\nthe sound of footsteps and by decreasing the volume of all\npreviously described soundscapes, introduced a new recre-\nation. At the farthest area of Rizal Park was a kiosk with\nchessboards. This new sound was introduced at 55:15 up to\nthe end of the entire soundscape.\nFinally, another relevant information the sonic layering of\nsoundscapes intended to convey was the varying age bracket\nof the speakers presented in the audio material. From the San\nPedro Cathedral up to the entrance of Rizal Park, you could\nhear voices of millennials. When you go deeper into the park,\nyou could listen to voices of retirees and senior citizens.\nIn general, the soundscape used in USAS gave further\ncharacterization of San Pedro Street initially provided by the\nphotographs.\nOn Meaning-Making\nThe feel part of the exhibition started with how the photos\nwere arranged, the shape of the panel boards used, the ambi-\nance provided by street vendors, the various noises heard, the\nprovision of an actual street sign, and the celebration of the\ncity's charterhood which elevated the sense of pride of the\nlookers during the exhibition.\nMeaning-making was done by making the exhibition\ninteractive. Two panel boards were used for this purpose in\nthe exhibit area. Lookers were encouraged to post their expe-\nriences on the walls provided. Pens, colored papers, pins, and\na writing table were also provided for this purpose. Colored\npapers were intentionally used to make the exhibition visible\nfrom afar, aside from the soundscape that captures attention\nof lookers.\nThe guide question, Ano ang kwento mo sa daang San\nPedro? [What is your story in San Pedro Street?], was also\nprovided for the lookers to answer (see Figure 4).\nIn the process of gathering stories, lookers were able to\nread other lookers' stories that somehow brought back mem-\nories and urged them to participate in the story sharing as\nshown in Figure 5. Before the closing date of the exhibition,\nlookers decided to post their stories directly on the photos\n(see Figures 6 and 7).\nResults and Discussion\nWith men as visual thinkers and women as aural thinkers, the\nfollowing stories were gathered during the USAS multisen-\nsorial exhibition. A total of 281 stories (responses) were\ngathered during the exhibition. The stories were categorized\ninto three--positive and humor, tragedy, and drama (love)--\nand all are within the photo categories: trade, landmark, and\npeople.\ntion provided or approximately 68.68% of the responses\nloyal to the guide question provided.\nnegative or tragedy, 18 (6.41%) are categorized under drama\nThe stories gathered in Table 3 were varied, but there\nwere certain overlaps between trade, landmark, and people.\nFor the purpose of categorization, all stories focusing on the\nstoryteller fall under people while stories focusing on the\nplace rather than the doer of the action fall under landmark.\nStories under trade talked about the business rather than the\nlandmark.\nMoreover, positive and humorous stories talk more on the\npositive things San Pedro Street offered them while the\nEscano and Sumaylo 7\nnegative or tragic stories range from funny embarrassing\nmoments, buying of knock-off goods and pirated movies, to\nlife threatening situations. Drama and love talk about inter-\npersonal relationships that started and developed within the\narea.\nIn this whole exercise of meaning-making through images\nand sound, San Pedro Street was used as a common setting. It\nbecomes the connection of all plots--happy, hopeful, and sad.\nThese are stories often told from the point of view of the law-\nmakers and those who disobey the law, the merchants who\npeddle their goods, and the lost who turn to religion for guid-\nance. In the case of USAS, what is relevant in the meaning-\nmaking process is the place where these stories took place\nrather than focusing only on what narrative theories dictate as\nessential in storytelling--beginning, middle, and end.\nFurthermore, if you look at the gathered stories, you can\nalso see that the interpretations of the lookers are almost the\nsame as those of the photographer. That said, we can say that\nthe images can be treated as a language aside from being an\nexpressive art form. Like symbols, image needs interpreta-\ntion and reinterpretation from the looker resulting to an\ninductive exploration of the images focusing on its features,\nfeelings, knowledge, and function. By interpreting and rein-\nterpreting the content of the images, the lookers were able to\ndissect the presented elements, that is, space, shapes, and so\nFigure 5.

(continued)\nEscano and Sumaylo 11\non, from suggested elements, that is, concepts, themes, allu-\nTake for example the openness of the lookers in sharing a\nnegative story (including buying knock-off goods and pirated\nDVDs) in public can be used as an allusion to the blatant\npresence of vendors selling knock-off goods and pirated\nDVDs within the presence of the City Hall, the Sangguniang\nPanlungsod, and the church. These three institutions defined\npiracy as stealing and that stealing is against the law of man\nand God. Yet, it is present. This use of visual imagery, in the\ncontext of visual rhetoric, as a way of illustrating, explain-\ning, and investigating the stories told in San Pedro Street,\nagain, does not complete the beginning, middle, and end pos-\nited by Barbatsis (2005). Instead, it only provides the\nsetting.\nIn general, the visual and aural messages served as \"fun-\ndamental carrier of sense\" as what sense-making structure or\nnarrative structure posits. The visual and aural messages\neven made the lookers act as if they are really in San Pedro\nStreet. It is evident in the number of stories (responses) that\ndid not answer the guide question provided by the photogra-\npher. It can also be seen in the way the lookers interacted\nwith the photographs. The actual damage caused by pinning\nthe stories directly in the photo is an example of an act that\ndefies both laws of man and God as seen in the trade and\nactivities in the featured street.\nThe visual\u00adaural overlap then became a channel that is\nimportant in the process of storytelling. As the Theory of\nVisual Rhetoric points out, the perspective of the lookers will\nalways be independent from its creator. Even if it reaches the\nsame interpretation, the process of interpreting it will be dif-\nferent. Simply put, Jordan et al. as cited in Hochmair (2004)\nsaid, \"To capture the meaning of a place, the place must,\nbesides its location, also be seen in the context of human\nWith this, can we infer that more and more people lose\ninterest in this area of the city as implied by the number of\nstories (responses) gathered that are not related to the topic?\nDoes this also mean that through the years, people define San\nPedro Street as an area for cheap knock-off goods?\nFurthermore, does this mean that the relevance of this area\nbeing the center of government and religion, being the\nassumed meaning of the place, is slowly fading? Finally, can\nwe infer that, just like its dilapidated buildings, its public\nrelevance is also dwindling?\nImplications\nAcity in decay is defined by Kevin Lynch, as cited inAgueda\none that boomed in the past due to a single economic activity's\ngrowth, in which it was specialized. That is why when the mode\nof production changed and the industry moved, urban and social\nstructures were not fit to new circumstance.\nHe further posits that \"urban decline can be understood as a\nlack of adaptation to new conditions . . . as old spatial and\nsocial structures have been unable to be transformed and\nadjusted to new modes of production.\" (p. 4) Urban decay, in\nretrospect, is an evidence of memory loss (Agueda, 2010).\nIn urban planning, urban decay creates a notion of for-\ngotten realities that might lead to forgotten cultural identi-\nties, hence creating the relevance of meaning-making or\nreception studies. As defined by Pernia (2004), reception\nstudies are concerned with \"viewer's interpretations,\ndecodings, readings, meaning productions, and percep-\ntions or comprehensions of communication and media\nmessages.\"(p. 47) Its significance to urban planning will\nbe in the context of heritage conservation as this is an\nimportant element in the discussions on \"cultural identity\nand preservation of the past\" (Matero, n.d.). Agueda (2010)\nalso reiterated that \"urban decay makes memory retrieval a\nmuch more urgent issue.\"\nAccording to Matero (n.d.), the primary objective of con-\nservation is cultural heritage protection before an area is\ntotally destroyed by urban decay and the lack of cultural and\nhistorical relevance to its people. To establish such relevance,\nplanners and policy makers should know the relevance of\nthese areas through meaning-making exercises.\nThe same argument was raised by Agueda (2009) saying\nthat urban decay is closely linked to \"productive reorganiza-\ntion, economic transformations, and changing shifts.\" She\nfurther posits that to reverse urban decay, \"reinstitution of\nvalue and lost status\" to the area suffering from decay should\nbe made. This is where urban planning and even tourism can\ncome in as these can help in memory retrieval and cultural\nheritage conservation.\nUntil today, the focal area for local festivities such as\nKadayawan Festival (August) and Araw ng Davao (March)\nis still the San Pedro Street. Public transport routes from\nthe northern and southern parts of the city converge in San\nPedro Street. Therefore, the implication of this meaning-\nmaking exercise in planning will be in infrastructural con-\nservation by restoring original building designs around\nSan Pedro Street highlighting its economic value as evi-\ndenced by the stories gathered in this article. In one of the\nstories, a looker emphasized that San Pedro Street was\ntheir Abreeza (a high-end mall) during their time. Planning,\nthen, should capitalize on this. San Pedro Street is still\nconsidered the central point for all routes of public trans-\nport as evidenced by the stories gathered. Therefore,\npedestrian movement should be taken into consideration\nwhen planning for this area. Moreover, another consider-\nation that planning should look into is to ascertain that no\nfurther degradation will happen to San Pedro Street.\nRecently, improvement of the City Hall fa\u00e7ade was\nobserved as beautification projects that include placing\nelectrical and other cables underground.\nWith these, the implications of this article in heritage con-\nservation can be summarized in the following points:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 that infrastructural development should be consistent\nwith how this area will be developed as a heritage site\nafter several meaning-making exercises;\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 that this area of Davao City, Philippines, should be\nprotected by the local government because of its his-\ntorical value; and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 that this area be treated as tourist attraction by the City\nTourism Authority patterned after the old Georgetown\nStreets in Penang, Malaysia.\nRecommendations\nOther stories do not necessarily fall under the three types of\nstories mentioned but these are worth mentioning as it tack-\nles comments on specific photos and at the same time com-\nments on the whole exhibition which the photographer\nbelieves to be a call from the lookers to relook at the city and\nits expansion. The photographer also considers this as rec-\nommendation for future creative work exploring other iconic\nareas of Davao City, Philippines.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAgueda, B.
