Because of recent changes in Social Security regulations that will soon begin to raise the age of eligibil-\nity for full retirement benefits, it is important to determine whether health and ability to work at older ages have im-\nproved in recent years.\nMethods. Individual-level data from the National Health Interview Survey from 1982 through 1993 are used in this\nanalysis. Trends in self-reported ability to work, presence of disease, and causes of actual work limitation are examined.\nResults. Men and women in their 60s, that is those in the older working ages and younger retirement ages, report\nsignificant improvement in their ability to work. The change in work ability is large enough so the percentage unable to\nhave been similar for racial and ethnic groups and across educational subgroups of the population, although African\nAmericans and those with lower educational attainment are less healthy to begin with. The improvement in health is\ndue to the changing educational composition of the population, which is linked to better life-long health, different oc-\ncupational circumstances, and better health behaviors. In addition, the improvement in work ability is explained by de-\ncline in the prevalence of cerebro/cardiovascular diseases and arthritis.\nDiscussion. The level of observed improvement in work ability means that the legislated rise in age of full eligibil-\nity for Social Security benefits should be more than compensated for by the improved ability to work.\nTHE increase in the age at which full Social Security\nbenefits are first payable to retired workers and the re-\nduction in benefits at early-retirement ages legislated by the\n1983 Social Security Amendments were based on the as-\nsumption that decreases in mortality over the preceding\ndecade had been accompanied by improving health among\nthe older working-age population. The assumption was that\nincreases in life expectancy would result in increases in\ndisability-free life expectancy and, thus, that normal retire-\nment age could increase accordingly, reaching 67 for parts\nof the baby boom cohort. The appropriateness of these as-\nsumptions was questioned at the time because evidence of\ndeteriorating health among the older working-age popula-\ntion during the 1970s was presented at the hearings preced-\ning passage of the amendments (Feldman, 1983). There is\nsome recent evidence, however, that health and the length\nof disability-free life have been improving since the 1980s\namong some age groups (Manton, Corder, & Stallard,\nand ability to work among those in the later working ages\nand early retirement ages are improving, increasing the age\nof full eligibility for Social Security will impose fewer\nhardships on older workers.\nThis article investigates trends in health and work ability\namong the older working-age and early retirement-age\nperiod. Three questions are addressed: Is there evidence of\nimproving work ability in the older working and early re-\ntirement ages? Are any trends in work ability the same for\nsubgroups of the population? Can any trends be explained\neither in terms of the composition of the population or the\nprevalence of underlying health conditions?\nBackground\nMortality, health, and disability.--Since the passage of\nthe Social Security Amendments, much has been learned\nabout health for the older working-age and younger retire-\nment-age population that makes it clear that one cannot\nequate mortality change and health change in making pol-\nicy. For instance, we know that mortality and disability do\nnot have the same causes (Verbrugge, 1989). About half of\ndisability is caused by conditions that are not lethal, such as\narthritis and back problems (Crimmins & Pramaggiore,\n1988). We also know that during any given period, life ex-\npectancy and population health do not have to change in the\nsame direction. Depending on whether increased life ex-\npectancy arises from later onset of ill health or the length-\nened survival of those with health problems, it is possible to\nhave both lengthening life expectancy and worsening popu-\nlation health (Crimmins, Hayward, & Saito, 1994).\nThe distinctions between heafth and disability have also\nbecome clearer in recent years. Disability, or inability to\nperform a social role such as work, results from underlying\nhealth conditions including the presence of diseases, condi-\ntions, impairments, or functioning difficulties (Verbrugge\n& Jette, 1994). Disability, however, is affected by external\ncircumstances as well as health characteristics internal to\nindividuals. Work disabilities can be affected by the charac-\nteristics of jobs, the workplace environment, workplace at-\ntitudes, and policies toward disability as well as intrinsic\nhealth circumstances.\nTrends in health and disability.--A number of studies\nriod for the middle-aged and older populations using data\nfrom the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The\ngeneral conclusion of these studies is that self-reported\nhealth and disability status deteriorated between the late\nResearchers who have attempted to look at health and\ndisability change since the beginning of the 1980s report\nthat health seems to be improving. Using the Current Popu-\n(1990) find a period of deterioration in health followed by\nimprovement beginning around 1980. Waidmann, Bound,\nimproved health in the 1980s for broad age groups of the\nadult population. Crimmins, Saito, and Ingegneri (1997) re-\nport an increase in the length of disability-free life ex-\nand incidence of disability and in the prevalence of disease\nin the National Long-Term Care Survey population aged 65\nreport a decrease in the incidence of disability between 1984\nStudy of Aging data.\nHealth and disability differentials.--At the time of the\nhearings addressing the changes in the age of eligibility for\nSocial Security, a number of persons expressed concern that\nsome subgroups of the population would be unduly disadvan-\ntaged by such an age increase. This concern has been justified\nby the recognition of currently large socioeconomic differ-\nences in both mortality and health during the working ages\n(House, Kessler, Herzog, Mero, Kinney, & Breslow, 1992;\nand the apparent widening of mortality differentials by so-\ncioeconomic status in recent years (Elo & Preston, 1994;\nFeldman, Makuc, Kleinman, & Cornoni-Huntley, 1989).\nGiven the strong relationship between socioeconomic\nstatus and health, it is not surprising that race and ethnicity\nare also strongly related to health and disability (House et\n1990). Differential trends in health are suggested by the\nfindings of Wolfe and Haveman (1990), who indicate a\nstronger effect of education on disability in the 1980s than\nearlier as well as different trends for racial groups.\nGender clearly influences the level of reported disability\nand the pathologies and impairments associated with re-\nported disability at any given time (Verbrugge, 1984). Past\ntrends have not always been identical for women and men\nExplanations for trends in health.--There has been little\nsystematic explanation of health trends. Increases in dis-\nability during the 1970s have been loosely attributed to the\n\"failure of success\" argument ascribed originally to Gruen-\nberg (1977); that is, the increasing survival of people debil-\nitated by disease or at risk of accumulating other patholo-\ngies or impairments has resulted in worsening population\nhealth. Not all analysts, however, are convinced that work\nability actually deteriorated over the 1970s; some have at-\ntributed the observed disability trends to increased accom-\nmodation to illness, more liberal disability benefits, or in-\ncreased awareness of pathology because of more medical\nThe two most quantitative analyses of the determinants of\npast change in disability agree that both changing levels of\npathologies and impairments and behavioral reactions to\nthese changes are important explanatory variables (Chirikos,\ntempt to use a combination of cross-sectional and time-\nseries data to evaluate the factors responsible for trends;\nhowever, both suffer because many of the concepts of inter-\nest, including the presence of disease and impairment, are\nnot measured or well indicated in the data sets used.\nTrends in population health may also be affected by\nchanging population composition. Although Wolfe and\nHaveman (1990) found this to be relatively unimportant\nduring the period they studied, it is possible that it could\nbecome more important during a time of greater composi-\ntional change or for narrower age groups than those used in\ntheir study. For example, over time the population has gen-\nerally become wealthier, better educated, more likely to\nhold white-collar jobs, less exposed to childhood diseases,\nless exposed to dangerous health practices, and more ex-\nposed to health care. Compositional change could affect\nboth the underlying health of the population and the envi-\nronment in which work takes place.\nThese results suggest that a new look at trends in health\nand work ability among the older working-age and retire-\nment-age populations is warranted. It is possible that health\nand work ability have begun to improve in the last decade,\nbut more extensive analysis is needed to document this for\nthe age group entering retirement. Most of what has been\ndone has been based on only a few years of data or has\nbeen done for either older or extremely broad age groups,\nor has used indicators of health or disability that may not be\nrelevant to ability to work. In addition, little is known about\ndifferential trends or causes of such trends.\nMETHODS\nData\nData for the analysis come from the National Health In-\nterview Survey (NHIS) for ages 50-69 for the years from\nvey designed to monitor health and health care utilization\nof the noninstitutionalized population of the United States.\nData are collected under the auspices of the National Cen-\nter for Health Statistics (NCHS). The annual sample size is\nIn 1982, the NHIS questionnaire underwent major revi-\nsions to the questions used to monitor population disability\nand health, which makes any time-trend analysis crossing\nquestionnaire has not been changed significantly, so analy-\nimportant for determining work ability for the entire popu-\nlation in the retirement ages. Before 1982, respondents de-\nclared their usual activities and were then asked about limi-\ntations in those activities. Since 1982, all persons younger\nthan 70 years of age have been asked about their ability to\nwork and limitations in their work ability (National Center\nfor Health Statistics, 1985). These questions allow each\nperson to be classified as \"unable to work because of\nhealth,\" \"limited in amount or kind of work because of\nhealth,\" or \"not having any health-related work limitation.\"\nThe redesign of the questions has been important in stan-\ndardizing the point of reference across the population. Be-\nfore 1982, comparing trends for men and women was diffi-\ncult because the only universally asked questions on disability\nin the NHIS referred to limitation in \"normal activity,\" which\nmay differ by gender. In addition, the questions are now simi-\nlar for respondents both in and out of the labor force, which\nwas not true in the past.\nIn order to monitor disease prevalence, information on the\npresence of diseases and impairments is also collected from\nNHIS respondents. Not all respondents are asked about all\ndiseases, but each respondent is asked questions about the\npresence of common diseases and impairments of one body\nsystem out of six (e.g., the circulatory system, the respiratory\nsystem). This feature of the survey places important limita-\ntions on the analysis because the potential presence of all the\nconditions and diseases affecting any individual is not\nknown; information is available about only one body system.\nHowever, information on the major diseases causing any\nhealth-related work limitation is collected from all respon-\ndents. This provides information on the existence of diseases\nsevere enough to cause actual work disability. The NHIS also\nincludes information on race and ethnicity, educational at-\ntainment, labor force status, and occupation of respondents.\nMethods\nAnnual time trends.--Time trends in work ability and\nwork limitations are examined for the 12 years from\nting into age groups is done in order to decompose the age\nrange into preretirement ages and ages when retirement\ntakes place now and is likely to take place in the future.\nThe question of whether there is a time trend in an age-\nsex subgroup is answered using the coefficient resulting\nfrom the regression of the percentage unable to work be-\ncause of health (or the percentage suffering any work limi-\ntation--including inability to work) on a variable indicating\np = a + b{t) + e,\nwhere p is the percentage unable to work in a given year, t\nthe annual average change in percent unable to work repre-\nsenting a linear time trend. The similarity of trends across\n11 subgroups for each age-sex group (by race and ethnicity,\neducation, occupation, and labor force status) is also exam-\nined in this way.\nAfter this initial analysis of trends in grouped data for\nsubgroups of the population, an analysis of individual-level\ndata pooled over 12 years is performed to estimate the trend\nin the absence of compositional changes, the effect of com-\npositional changes, and the size of subgroup differences in\ninability to work or work limitation. This pooled data set\nhas a total T\nwhere P is the probability of being unable to work and Xj is\na vector of independent variables including years since\n1982, age, sex, Black, Hispanic, years of completed educa-\ntion, labor force status, and occupation divided into three\ncategories (professionals/managers, laborers, and other). In-\nteraction terms are also included where appropriate. Exami-\nnation of the time trends in disease prevalence is performed\nfor individual diseases using the portion of the sample re-\nsponding to questions on selected diseases; finally, we ana-\nlyze limitation in work ability caused by specified diseases\nfor the entire sample.\nRESULTS\nThe regression coefficients representing average annual\nwork inability for each age-sex group between age 50 and\nage 69 are shown in Table 1. In later years both men and\nwomen older than the age of 61 are less likely to report in-\nability to work. Except for women aged 55-59, the trend is\nnot statistically significant for younger age groups. The size\nof the annual average decline in inability to work is in the\n.4-.7 range for men in the three older age groups and .5-.7\nTable 1.

The average decrease in any work limitation is\nusually similar to the average decrease in complete inabil-\nity. Because being unable to work is a subset of any work\nlimitation, the change in total limitation is really concen-\ntrated in the \"ability to work at all\" category.\nTo examine differential trends, we provide the average\nannual change in the percentage unable to work for race\nand education groups and for those not in the labor force in\neach age-sex group. For those in the labor force and for oc-\ncupation subgroups, we show average annual change in the\npercent with work limitation. Table 2 contains the average\nannual change in the percentage unable to work estimated\nfrom 132 regression models. Generally, both Whites and\nBlacks older than 61 have experienced significant improve-\nment in work ability indicated by a decrease in the percent\nunable to work. Among Hispanics, there has been decrease\nin disability over time for many age groups but not at a sig-\nnificant level. Of course, the Hispanic analysis is based on a\nmuch smaller sample size than those for the other ethnic\ngroups and is thus more subject to statistical fluctuation.\nTrends within educational groups in a given age group\nare generally similar but in many cases are not statistically\nsignificant. Among people in their 60s, all educational\ngroups generally experience decline in work inability, with\nthe largest declines often reported among those with the\nleast education. Among adults in their 50s, there are no ed-\nucational groups with significant decrease in work inability;\namong men with the lowest education and women with the\nhighest education, there is some increase in disability.\nDividing the sample into those in and out of the labor\nforce indicates that it is people out of the labor force who\nhave experienced improved ability to work. Men in each\nage group who are out of the labor force experience a sig-\nnificant reduction in inability to work. Among men in the\nlabor force, only those ages 60-61 experience a significant\nimprovement in work ability. The pattern is fairly similar\nfor women; those out of the labor force who are older than\n61 experience improvement in work ability. The only sig-\nnificant change among those in the labor force is a decrease\namong women 62-64 in work limitation. This change\namong those out of the labor force must mean that healthier\npeople are retiring in more recent years.\nIn general, there are few significant trends in work limi-\ntation in any of the occupational categories. This means\nthat generally the lack of change among all workers is simi-\nlar and not the result of differential trends by occupation.\nGiven the knowledge that trends differ mainly by age and\nlabor force status but generally not by sex, race/ethnicity,\neducation and occupation, we perform an individual level\nanalysis to examine the effect of each of these independent\nTable 2.

Control-\nling for all of these characteristics standardizes for any\nchanges in the composition of the population (in age, race,\neducation, labor force participation, and occupation) that\nmight have occurred over the 12 years and indicates the ef-\nfect of change over time with a standard population.\nPersons in this age range have changed in their composi-\nforce participation also changed but the change was differ-\nential by sex. Men reported less participation in 1993 than\n41% for those in their 60s). The percent of women in the\nlabor force increased from 54% to 65% for those in their\npersons in the labor force, there was a small increase in the\nproportion in the \"other\" occupational category and a small\ndecrease in the proportion of laborers over the period.\nWe show the effect on being unable to work of each of\nthese compositional variables as well as the effect of report-\ning in a more recent year for the whole 50-69 year old sam-\nple in Table 3. First, we examine the average annual change\nin each outcome with only age and sex controlled (Model\n1) and then how this is affected by controlling for race and\nethnicity (Model 2), education (Model 3), and labor force\nstatus (Model 4) or, in effect, standardizing for these sam-\nple characteristics. When age and sex are controlled, we\nfind a significant effect of years since 1982 such that the\nrelative likelihood of being unable to work is decreased by\n2.1% every year (Table 3, Model 1). Controlling for race\n(Model 2) has little effect on the time trend. When the com-\nposition of the population in terms of education is con-\ntrolled (Model 3), however, the initial coefficient on time is\nreduced by about two thirds to an annual reduction in risk\nof 0.7, which is still significant. Thus, educational composi-\ntional change accounts for about two thirds of the relative\nreduction in inability to work or work limitations over this\ntime period. Controlling labor force status does not change\nthis result very much (Model 4). Although we do not show\nthe analogous regression results for the measure of work\nlimitation, being limited in ability to work is decreased an-\nnually by 1.7% with age and sex controlled and .5% when\neducation is introduced (results available upon request).\nThese results mean that most of the explanation for the\ntime trend in work ability is compositional--the changing\neducational composition of this age group--but the decline\nremains statistically significant even when education is\ncontrolled, indicating that other factors were at work. Inter-\naction terms between time and labor-force participation and\ntime and age are included in Model 5. Their significance in\nTable 3 replicates the significance of the greater improve-\nment in health at older ages and among those out of the\nlabor force as shown in Table 2.\nNow we turn to subgroup differences in work ability.\nWomen are somewhat less likely to report inability to work.\nWe find that being female lowers the relative likelihood of\nbeing unable to work by about 4% (before controlling for\nlabor-force status but with controls for education) and low-\ners the likelihood of being limited in work ability by 10%\n(Model 3). On the other hand, being African American in-\ncreases the likelihood (relative to that of non-Hispanic\nWhites) of being unable to work by about half even when\neducation is controlled; this is a substantial reduction from\nthe 220% higher level for African Americans when educa-\ntion is not controlled. When education is controlled, the rel-\native likelihood of Hispanics being unable to work is about\n25% less than that of non-Hispanic Whites. Without educa-\ntion controlled, Hispanics are more likely than non-Hispanic\nWhites to have work disability.\nIn Table 4, we include occupation along with the other\nvariables from Table 3 to examine limitation in work ability\nfor the working population. For this analysis, occupation is\ndivided into the three categories that roughly represent\nwhite-collar professionals, blue-collar workers, and the\nomitted category of sales and clerical workers. The signifi-\ncant time coefficient indicates that each year decreases the\nTable 3.

This means that there was some small\nannual average decrease in limitation among workers and it\ncan be explained by their changing composition. The differ-\nence between significant decline in work limitation among\nworkers shown in Table 4 and the insignificant decline\namong workers shown in Table 2 undoubtedly arises from\nthe large N used in analysis for Table 4.\nPredictably, relative to the omitted category of sales and\nclerical workers, managers have a lowered risk of having\nwork limitation. Surprisingly, laborers also have a lower\nlevel of overall limitation. Thus, the individual level analy-\nsis indicates that both managers and laborers have less\nwork limitation than those in the \"other\" category of work-\ners. As expected, the interaction terms indicate no signifi-\ncant differences in time trends by occupation.\nIn order to better interpret the meaning of the statistical\nresults indicating a decrease over time in the likelihood that\none is unable to work and the size of the differentials across\nsubgroups, we estimate the probability that a person with\ngiven characteristics would be unable to work in 1982 and\n1993 using the results of individual-level models (Table 5).\nFirst, because there are clear trends among those in their\n60s and not in their 50s, and because this is the age range\nsurrounding the retirement years, we reestimate Table 3\n(Models 1 and 3) for those in their 60s to use as the basis of\nour estimates. The results of this reestimation are fairly\nsimilar to those shown in Table 3, with the exception that\nthe size of the coefficient on time is greater (-.031 vs -.021\ncients from the model including just age, sex, and year\nsince 1982, we estimate the probability that a man and\nestimated probability of inability to work is very dramatic,\nTable 5.

Most importantly, this change indicates\nthat the work ability levels of those in their late 60s in the\nWe have shown that a significant amount of the time\ntrend was due to changing educational composition; we can\nalso look at the estimated change among people with the\nsame education at the two dates. We could do this for any\ngender, age, and education group and get similar change\nover time, although each group would have a different level\nof disability at the initial date. For illustrative purposes, we\nshow the estimated probability of being unable to work for a\nnon-Hispanic White man with either 10 or 16 years of edu-\nin the likelihood of being unable to work is about one per-\ncentage point for those with low education and slightly less\nfor those with a college education. Although the drop is\nsmall, it indicates that with the same education level a 67-\nyear-old man in 1993 had a disability level similar to a 66-\nyear-old man in 1982. If this trend were to continue for an-\nother 11 years, the disability levels among 67-year-olds in\nolds in 1982 with the same educational level. The change\nover time is significant, but the difference at any one point\nin time between persons with high and low education is\nmuch greater and indicates the reason that rising educational\nlevels have such a strong effect on population disability lev-\nels. For instance, a 62-year-old man with 10 years of educa-\nwhich is more than twice that of a similarly aged man with a\ncollege education. In fact, a 69-year-old man with a college\neducation is substantially less likely to be unable to work\nthan a 62-year-old man with 10 years of education.\nIn order to examine the differences in the probability of\nbeing unable to work by gender and ethnicity at the most re-\ncent date, we estimate the probabilities of being unable to\nwork for men and women, African Americans, Hispanics, and\nnon-Hispanic Whites assuming each group has 10 years of\neducation in 1993. Whereas the difference between men and\nwomen in inability to work is quite small, Hispanics are the\nleast likely to be disabled and African Americans the most\nlikely (Table 6). The likelihood of being disabled differs\nmarkedly by race and ethnicity even when education is con-\ntrolled. For instance, at age 65 among those with 10 years of\neducation, about one out of three African Americans, one out\nof five non-Hispanic Whites, and one out of six Hispanics are\nunable to work. Non-Hispanic White men and women at age\n67 have estimated levels of disability lower than those of\nAfrican Americans at age 62. The lower level of Hispanic dis-\nability, once education is controlled, reflects the fact that the\nHispanic population has a substantial proportion of immi-\ngrants. Hispanics who are disabled early in life are unlikely to\ncome to the United States to work; some of those who be-\ncome disabled are likely to return to their place of origin.\nPrevalence of Disease\nAlthough we have shown that a substantial portion of the\ntrend in work ability is related to the changing educational\ncomposition of cohorts, we hypothesize that one of the\nmechanisms through which education works to improve\npopulation health is through a lower prevalence of disease\nbecause lower disease levels are linked to higher education\n(House et al., 1992). Time trends in the prevalence of a\nnumber of major diseases and conditions, as well as trends\nin the likelihood that these diseases cause inability to work,\nWe are limited in the prevalence phase of the analysis to\nthe diseases about which respondents were queried. From\nthese we selected some of the major diseases and conditions\nthat are causes of disability, including arthritis, diabetes,\nTable 6.

These dis-\neases account for 73% of the disability in this age group\nduring the 12-year period. Two of these disease categories\nare much more prevalent than others: cerebro/cardiovascular\ndiseases and arthritis. Each of these diseases is present in\nmore change in disability among those in their 60s than in\ntheir 50s, we examine trends in disease presence for the sub-\ngroups of respondents in their 50s and 60s. For each disease,\nthe likelihood that a person has the disease is regressed on\nbecause the NCHS did not collect data on the causes of\nwork limitation in 1982. The odds ratios for significant coef-\nficients on the variables representing the time trend or num-\nber of years since 1983 are presented in Table 7 (panel A).\nSome disease groups are more prevalent in later years\nand some are less prevalent. In both age groups, the relative\nrisk of cerebro/cardiovascular disease and arthritis declines\nby 1-2% annually. The relative likelihood of diabetes in-\ncreased in the older group by 3% per year; respiratory con-\nditions increased in the younger group by 2% per year.\nThere was no trend in the prevalence of mental and muscu-\nloskeletal conditions in these age groups.\nIf the trends in disease prevalence are examined separately\nfor those in and out of the labor force (data not shown), the\ntrends for the subgroups are generally similar to those for the\ncombined population. The exceptions are that people in the\nlabor force in the 50-59 age range experience a declining\ntrend in only cerebro/cardiovascular disease but no trend in\narthritis. For those aged 60-69, cerebro/cardiovascular dis-\nease declines only for those out of the labor force.\nWe can also determine trends in the likelihood of report-\ning that a specified disease is a reported cause of work limi-\ntation (Table 7, panel B). Changes in this likelihood could\nbe an indicator of change in the prevalence of diseases, the\nseverity of diseases, the likelihood of work, or in the likeli-\nhood of finding work and disease incompatible (i.e., chang-\ning accommodation to health processes or job characteris-\ntics). For three diseases, there is a decrease in the likelihood\nthat the disease causes work limitation in both the younger\nand the older group for arthritis, respiratory conditions, and\ncerebro/cardiovascular diseases. For cerebro/cardiovascular\nconditions and arthritis, this could mean that people not\nonly have fewer conditions, but that they have less serious\nheart, vascular, and arthritis conditions than they did in the\npast. On the other hand, among those in their 50s, there is\nan increase in the likelihood of having a work-limiting con-\ndition caused by diabetes, a musculoskeletal condition, or a\nmental disorder. Because we do not have evidence that the\nprevalence of these diseases increased, this must mean that\neither their severity increased, their compatibility with job\nrequirements lessened, or people are less willing to work\nwith these conditions. The fact that for respondents in their\n50s respiratory conditions are less likely to be a cause of in-\nability to work even though such conditions are becoming\nmore prevalent indicates that the increase in prevalence\nmay represent an increase in less severe cases. It is likely\nthat the increase in respiratory conditions results from a\nTable 7.

When this is done\nfor arthritis and cerebro/cardiovascular conditions for 1983\nand 1993, the decreases in the prevalence of arthritis and\ncerebro/cardiovascular conditions for a 62-year-old man are\n3% and 4%, respectively. During the same period, the esti-\nmated prevalence of arthritis dropped from 31% to 28%; the\nestimated prevalence of cerebro/cardiovascular diseases\nfrom 42% to 39%. This means that the prevalence of each of\nthese diseases declined by about 10% from its original level\nover the period. The probability of having a limitation\ncaused by each of these diseases declined by 12% and 25%\nrespectively, or from 2.4% to 2.1% for arthritis and 9.1% to\n6.7% for cerebro/cardiovascular conditions.\nTo address the issue of how the trend in disease prevalence\nis related to educational change in the population, we control\nfor education in the equations that were the basis of the re-\nsults reported for disease trends in Table 7. We then examine\nboth the relationship of education to the presence of disease\nand how controlling for education affects the coefficients in-\ndicating the time trend (Table 7, panel B). With one excep-\ntion, respondents with higher education levels are less likely\nto report having a disease or being limited in work ability by a\ndisease. The only exception is that the prevalence of muscu-\nloskeletal disorders is not related to education in either age\ngroup. The relative likelihood of having a cerebro/cardiovas-\ncular condition is decreased by 4% with every additional year\nof education. The size of the effect on arthritis is similar. The\ncontrol for education reduces the coefficients on the time\ntrends in arthritis and cerebro/cardiovascular conditions to in-\nsignificance among people in their 60s, indicating that it is ed-\nucational compositional shifts that explain the time trend in\nthe prevalence of these diseases. Without educational change,\nthere would not have been a trend in the prevalence of these\ndiseases. The controls for education result in coefficients indi-\ncating significant increases in limitation from diabetes and\nmusculoskeletal conditions among individuals in their 60s.\nThis means that without educational change these diseases\nwould have increased. The other trends shown for people in\ntheir 60s in Table 7, panel A, are not significantly affected by\nthe education controls.\nDISCUSSION\nThe essential question raised by this article is whether\nthe increases in age eligibility for full retirement under So-\ncial Security were based on accurate assumptions about im-\nproving work ability. In order to answer this question, we\naddressed three specific questions: (a) Is there evidence of\nan improvement in ability to work in the 50-69 year age\ngroup? (b) Is the trend the same for different subgroups of\nthe population? And (c) can the trend be explained by\nchanging population composition or is it due to changes in\nthe underlying health of the population after compositional\nchange is taken into account?\nThe evidence that self-reported ability to work has in-\ncreased among persons older than 60 is clear. Whether\nmeasured by inability in or limitation in ability to work,\nported in work ability. The improvement in work ability\nduring this period was significant, indicating a drop in work\ninability of about 24%. The level of improvement observed\nmeans that the legislated rise in age of full eligibility for\nSocial Security benefits should be more than compensated\nfor by the increase in the population's ability to work.\nThe trend toward improved ability to work appears to be\nsimilar for most subgroups of adults older than 60; the\ntrends do not differ by gender, education, or occupation.\nImprovement in ability to work is most significant among\npeople who are out of the labor force. This must mean that\nhealthier people are leaving the labor force in more recent\nyears. Support for this was supplied by the finding that\namong respondents in their 60s, the level of cardiovascular\ndisease declined among those who were out of the labor\nforce but not those who were in the labor force. Decrease in\nlimitation in work ability among people who work means\nthere is also some improvement in health among workers.\nPart of the trend is related to compositional change in the\nare more highly educated than those who were in their 60s\nin the 1980s; the average educational level increased by\none year among those in their 60s across this period. Con-\ntrolling for education removes the majority of the time\ntrend in work ability, all of it among workers. This means a\nsignificant part of the trend is not related to changes in the\nunderlying health processes of the population but to com-\npositional change. This is important in terms of how one\nviews the likelihood that health change will continue be-\ncause the amount of compositional change varies from\ndecade to decade. In addition, the meaning of educational\nchanges may vary at different levels of education. Increases\nin education among the now-older population may signify\nmajor life differences in health behaviors and lifestyle.\nThese changes may not accompany subsequent increases in\neducational attainment of the same size. However, the cur-\nrent difference between the educational level of people in\ntheir 60s and those in their 50s of .7 years indicates that\nthere will continue to be educational increase among those\nin their 60s for some time to come.\nChanges in the prevalence of diseases are an indication\nof the underlying mechanism through which population\ncomposition changes health. Declines in cerebro/cardiovas-\ncular disease and arthritis prevalence and in these diseases\nas causes of work limitation suggest both a decline in the\nlevel and severity of these conditions, which are the major\ncauses of disability among the older population. The de-\ncline in the prevalence of these diseases in the population is\nrelated to educational changes, and the lower levels of these\ndiseases are associated with improving education. How-\never, educational change does not explain the lowered level\nof reported work disability from these diseases.\nWe emphasize the importance of educational change in ex-\nplaining trends in diseases and work ability because we feel\nthat education is an indicator of a set of lifelong circum-\nstances that affect the health status of an individual. Educa-\ntional level begins to affect health early in life in one's family\nof origin and continues to affect one's health throughout\nadulthood through its effect on health habits, the use of health\ncare, and exposure to health-affecting life situations such as\ndangerous occupations or stress-inducing situations. Although\neducation and occupation are highly related, during this time\nperiod we do not find significant shifts in the occupational\nclassification of this age group over the three broad categories\nused here that would explain the time trend observed. In fact,\nthe occupation category that has increased slightly in size--\nthe \"other\" category, which includes service workers--is a\nrelatively high disability category. Workers in this category\nhave the same level of work inability as laborers when educa-\ntion is not controlled and a higher level when education is\ncontrolled. It is possible that if we used a different classifica-\ntion of occupation, we would find occupational change to be a\npotential explanation for the time trend observed here. It is\nalso possible that there has been a general lessening of the de-\nmands of jobs in all categories that would make it increas-\ningly possible to continue to work in the face of health prob-\nlems. Such changes in job demands would also be compatible\nwith the reported improvement in ability to work.\nAnother potential explanation for trends in health is\nchanges in attitudes and policies toward working with dis-\nabilities or health problems. For instance, in 1990 the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act was passed and imple-\nmented. This may have encouraged people with disabilities\nto define themselves increasingly as able to work and could\nbe related to the trend observed here. Changes in disability\npolicy are also a potential explanatory variable in any\nchange over time, although the direction of policy change\ndoes not seem compatible with the time trend observed.\nDuring the early 1980s, the enforcement of regulations was\ntightened to make it more difficult to be declared work dis-\nabled; then, as often happens, these regulations were subse-\nquently relaxed in the late 1980s (Bawden and Palmer,\ncountervailing force to the trends observed here.\nAlthough there has been improvement among people in\ntheir 60s in nearly all ethnic-gender subgroups of the popu-\nlation, there are still differential abilities to work reported\nby gender, race/ethnicity, education and occupation. This\nmeans that subgroups are currently affected quite differen-\ntially by the rules for Social Security age of eligibility and\nthis differential is unlikely to change. We have shown that a\nWhite man at age 62 with 10 years of education has a level\nof work inability more than 60% higher than a man with\nthe same characteristics who has a college education. Simi-\nlarly, African American men are about 40% more likely to\nreport inability to work than non-Hispanic White men with\nthe same level of education. These differences in work abil-\nity by socioeconomic status are much larger than differ-\nences between ages 65 and 67 for all groups and indicate\nthat Social Security policy will have to continue to consider\nthe welfare of the significant number of persons who are\nunable to work to normal retirement age.\nRespondents in their 50s did not experience improvement\nin work ability even though this age group also changed in\neducational level. For people in their 50s, there is evidence\nof a countervailing force in the increased likelihood of re-\nporting certain diseases as work limiting. This could be due\nto either changes in jobs, benefits, or attitudes. These find-\nings suggest caution must be used in projecting current\ntrends into the future.\n"
