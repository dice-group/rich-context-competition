    "reduced_content": "sgo.sagepub.com\nSince the 2010 general election, the Coalition government\nhas brought the issue of Islamophobia much more firmly into\nthe political and policy spaces than its New Labour predeces-\nsor. This can be seen in the establishing of the All Party\nParliamentary Group (APPG) on Islamophobia, the Cross-\nGovernment Working Group (CGWG) on Anti-Muslim\nHatred (CGWG), and in a more populist fashion, in the sug-\ngestion by the cochair of the Conservative Party--Baroness\nSayeeda Warsi--that Islamophobia has passed \"the dinner\ntable test\" (Guardian, 2011): that the expression of anti-Mus-\nlim and anti-Islamic sentiment has become socially accept-\nable through conversational civility. To what extent also is it\nevidence that the Coalition, unlike its New Labour predeces-\nsors, is happy to \"do God\" (Guardian, 2010)? Irrespective of\nthe drivers, Islamophobia is now firmly established on the\npolitical and policy radar; interesting given that since the\npublication of the Commission on British Muslims and\nIslamophobia's (CBMI) report by the Runnymede Trust in\n1997 (the Runnymede report)--the first British policy docu-\nment relating to Islamophobia--policy responses to the phe-\nnomenon have been scant, indirect, and somewhat implicit.\nConsequently, developments and discourses emanating from\nthe Coalition are as unexpected as they are unprecedented.\nWhy then might Islamophobia be on the policy agenda now?\nWhat has changed?\nGiven Islamophobia's timeliness, relatively little schol-\narly work has been produced, which focuses on governmen-\ntal policy responses to tackling the phenomenon.\nConsequently, such a consideration is possibly somewhat\noverdue. Acknowledging this gap and the shift in Coalition\nthinking, this article critically analyses British governmental\npolicy responses and approaches to Islamophobia over the\npast two decades. Focusing on three key issues--definition,\nevidence, and political differences--this article offers a brief\noverview of what Islamophobia might--and might not--be.\nFrom here, it contextualizes the contemporary setting\nthrough considering historical policy approaches including\n\"racerelations\"andequalitiesagendas.UsingtheRunnymede\nreport as a landmark, a critical retrospective of the policies to\nemerge under New Labour is considered before focusing on\nrecent, Coalition-led changes. In conclusion, this article\nanalyses the strengths and weaknesses of the different policy\napproaches to highlight where future British governmental\npolicy toward Islamophobia may go. As well as reflecting\n1University of Birmingham, England\nCorresponding Author:\nChris Allen, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, West\nEmail: c.allen.2@bham.ac.uk\nPassing the Dinner Table Test:\nRetrospective and Prospective\nApproaches to Tackling Islamophobia in\nBritain\nChris Allen1\n Keywords\nIslamophobia, anti-Muslim hatred, British government, discrimination, religion\n2 SAGE Open\nupon a wide range of policy and academic sources, docu-\nments from various governmental sources (including some\nthat are unavailable in the public domain) and research notes\nfrom exploring Islamophobia at British and European levels\nfrom the past decade are also drawn upon.\nAcknowledging the international resonance of the phe-\nnomenon, its different manifestations in different national\nand international settings, and the differing approaches to\ntackling it in these same locations, this article contributes\nknowledge toward understanding governmental policy\napproaches to tackling Islamophobia as well as Islamophobia\nper se. The wider body of work remains embryonic where\nthe focus has been on theoretical analyses (Allen, 2010;\ncontexts (e.g., education; Shaik, 2006), specific locations\n(Reeves, Abbas, & Pedroso, 2009), political movements\n(Allen, 2011a), or from within specific disciplines (Sheriden,\nrelations and equalities, it is easy to be overly \"introspective,\nover-theoretical and disconnected from policy concerns\"\n(p.1), something which is true of Islamophobia. Where\nresearch has focused on policy, most have disproportionately\nfocused on associated topics or those conflated with Islam or\nMuslims rather than with Islamophobia itself. This can be\nseen in the focus on antiterrorism (Kundnani, 2009; Spalek\nMandeville, 2009; Modood, Triandafyllidou, & Zapata-\nAlcock's (2003) reflection therefore has resonance: \"the rac-\nism that black people in Britain experience is thus not the\nsame thing as reaction to ethnic differences\" (p. 290). As the\nIslamophobia Muslims experience in Britain is not the same\nas reaction to religious or theological differences, what\nParekh (2006) suggests comes under the moniker the\n\"Muslim question.\" As Alcock clarifies, the focus \"is thus\nnot race, but racism\" (p. 290). Here, therefore, the focus is\nIslamophobia.\nKnowing Islamophobia\nRecognition of Islamophobia, let alone political recognition,\nspans little more than two decades (Allen, 2010; CBMI,\n1997). Those two decades, however, have been marked by at\ntimes emotive exchanges about what Islamophobia is and\nwhat is not. British in coinage, the Runnymede report defined\nIslamophobia as \"a useful shorthand way of referring to the\ndread or hatred of Islam . . . and, therefore, to fear or dislike\nall or most Muslims\" (CBMI, 1997, p. 1). In explanation, it\nsuggested that Islamophobia was identifiable through \"recur-\nring characteristic[s] of closed views\" (1997, p. 1). From its\ntypology of \"closed views,\" Islamophobia was identifiable\nwhere: Muslims and Islam were represented as or seen to be\nthe enemy, violent, aggressive, threatening, separate, and\n\"other\". Despite the definition and typology having been\nwidely adopted, both have been shown to be flawed. For\nAllen (2010), if the \"closed views\" equal Islamophobia, then\nthe opposite \"open views\"--set out in the report as a coun-\nterbalance or more rational \"view\"--must equal Islamophilia,\nitself as unwelcome and unwarranted as Islamophobia. For\nthose seeking to refute or reject Islamophobia, such a binary\napproach offers convenience: Tackling Islamophobia neces-\nsitates the imposition of an unmovable and uncritical\n(Islamophilic) shield behind which all criticism and ques-\ntioning of Islam and Muslims, irrespective of legitimacy is\ndeflected or repealed. For critics, therefore, all discussion\nand debate is forced into being either \"Islamophobic\" or\n\"Islamophilic.\" In doing so, the nuance and complexity that\ncharacterizes much of what sits between the binaries is inap-\npropriately referred to in generalized terms and in largely\npatronizing and phoney ways (Allen, 2010). This widespread\nand uncritical adoption of the Runnymede definition and\ntypology is therefore seen to be causal in the failure to effec-\ntively communicate not only what Islamophobia is but also\nto convince politicians and policy makers that a response is\nUsage of the term Islamophobia is also problematic.\nShyrock (2010) suggests that the usage is oversimplified and\n\"impervious to nuance\" (2010, p. 9), whereas for Allen\n(2010), it is routinely conceived and used in weak and uncon-\nvincing ways. Sayyid (2010) offers differentiation:\nAnalytically, Islamophobia is rendered \"a nebulous and per-\npetually contested category\" (p. 2); polemically, it is locked\nin the discourses of those with grievances, smugly pontificat-\ning or seeking the ear of politicians. For him, usage is inef-\nfectual given the lack of meaning attributed to it by those\nwho use it. Similar criticisms are posited when charges of\nIslamophobia are made, lacking specificity, relying on con-\njecture and accusation, therefore being open to challenge and\ncontention, it might be easier to suspend engagement with\nIslamophobia linguistically and conceptually. However, as\nhe adds, this miscasts the issue as the term is established in\nthe contemporary lexicon and has had considerable invest-\nment from critics and advocates alike. Relevant here is the\nfact that the Coalition government is now openly using the\nterm. Although as before, what matters will be what is meant\nby the Coalition's usage of the term.\nUnsurprisingly, the government's definition and mean-\nings of Islamophobia remain protean.As evidence of this, the\nAPPG has prioritized the need for a working definition to\nbase its work program on (Allen, 2011a). So does the CGWG,\nnoting how \"the term Islamophobia is not contained within\ntraditional dictionaries and there are many different interpre-\ntations as to its meaning . . . the term may be misleading in\nthe truest sense\" (Cross Party Working Group on\nIslamophobia & Anti-Muslim Hate Crime, 2012b). Similar\ncan be seen at the European level also. Research commis-\nsioned by the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and\nXenophobia (EUMC) following the events of 11 September\nasked to monitor levels of Islamophobia, less than half of had\na working definition of what exactly it was they were moni-\ntoring (Allen & Nielsen, 2002). At the European level, the\nEUMC has pursued research into Islamophobia (EUMC,\nmental impact of there being no legally binding or widely\naccepted definition of Islamophobia was noted (EUMC,\n2007a). However, the EUMC did acknowledge the Council\nof Europe's 2005 definition: \"the fear of or prejudiced view-\npoint towards Islam, Muslims and matters pertaining to them\n. . . [taking] the shape of daily forms of racism and discrimi-\nnation or more violent forms, Islamophobia is a violation of\nbroad, the definition offers some advantages over the\nRunnymede alternative. While Runnymede's Islamophobia\nwas an unfounded and irrational phenomenon, the Council of\nEurope attempt goes further by recognizing the more routine,\nconsequential and exclusionary characteristics and conse-\nquences, the \"daily forms of racism and discrimination and\nmore violent forms.\"\nThe Council of Europe definition also has resonance with\ntheoretical models of Islamophobia. For Allen (2010), the\ntheory is that Islamophobia functions as an ideology, through\nmodes of operation (e.g., the media or political discourse),\nand as exclusionary practices including violence as a tool for\nexclusion. The latter function is crucial to the policy setting\nas evidence of exclusionary practices will be that which best\nconvinces and prompts politicians and policy makers of the\nneed for change or at least a policy response. The Council of\nEurope approach also resonates with Allen's notion that\nIslamophobia is not always unfounded and irrational. Both\nacknowledge that Islamophobia can be a \"prejudiced view-\npoint\" as much as fear, going beyond the pathological and\nreductivism of the Runnymede approach. While still broad,\nthe Council of Europe definition therefore offers a way to\nincorporate greater nuance and complexity, and so it is posi-\ntive that the CGWG has used as a start point (Cross Party\nWorking Group on Islamophobia & Anti-Muslim Hate\nCrime, 2012b). Whatever approach is preferred, however,\nthe APPG and the CGWG would clearly benefit from offer-\ning some clarity in defining Islamophobia. In doing so, they\nmight better manage expectations about what might be real-\nistically achievable at the same time as proposing a policy-\nfriendly definition.\nBefore Runnymede\nDiscrimination on the basis of religion clearly precedes the\nemergence of Islamophobia in the 1990s as does governmen-\ntal engagement with faith and religious issues also. As well\nas there being a greater political openness to the more social\nand civic version of religion since the mid-1980s\n(McLoughlin, 2010), so too has a greater impetus been iden-\ntifiable toward tackling inequalities. While Jenkins and\nSolomos (1989) rightly acknowledge how at the level of\nnational governmental there was \"little agreement about\nwhat should be done . . . to help break down racially dis-\ncriminatory barriers\" (p. 3); for Cooper (2004), the same was\nnot always true away from Westminster. Those on the politi-\ncal left in the urban conurbations were becoming increas-\ningly driven to find effective strategies to tackling what they\nsaw as rising inequalities and discrimination. Rather than\ndeveloping new policies and legislation, they focused on\nextending prevailing principles of equality to those with\n\"new\"--and controversial--markers of identity. Such mark-\ners went beyond traditional understandings, sexual orienta-\ntion, for instance, being seen as more than a form of conduct.\nLikewise, religion is seen as being more than beliefs and\npractices. Achieving only minor breakthroughs at govern-\nmental level, Cooper (2004) suggests these left a legacy that\nduly influenced the way markers of discrimination were con-\nceived, formalized, and afforded protection years later.\nStill, the recognition of discrimination on the basis of reli-\ngion was largely invisible in the British political spaces for\nmuch of the 20th century, excepting the Northern Irish con-\ntext. This changed in the late 1980s when calls for religious\ndiscrimination to be made unlawful emerged in the aftermath\nof the Satanic Verses. This acted, according to Weller (2006),\nas both a lightning rod and magnifying glass for Britain's\nMuslim communities: the lightning rod galvanizing Muslim\ncommunities and organizations to use religion as a marker of\nindividual and corporate identity; the magnifying glass plac-\ning Muslims, their communities, and organizations under\nincreased public and political scrutiny. However, it was not\nuntil the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) called for\nreligious discrimination to be made unlawful in 1991 that\nsome momentum became evident: \"It is at present within the\nlaw to incite hatred against a religious community and to dis-\ncriminate against a person because of their religion, unless\naffiliation to a religion happens to be recognised as member-\nship of an ethnic group\" (cited in Blakemore & Drake, 1996,\np. 115). Little evidence was, however, available. Given that\nmuch of this was anecdotal or founded upon conjecture, so\nthe claims were largely rejected and dismissed as a conse-\nquence of the \"lightning rod.\"\nThe first Muslim organization to call for protection\nagainst discrimination on the basis of religion was the UK\nAction Committee on Islamic Affairs (UKACIA). Bolstered\nby the CRE, UKACIA published a report in 1993 titled\n\"Muslims and the Law in Multi-Faith Britain: The Need for\nReform.\" Drawing upon the 1975 White Paper on racial dis-\ncrimination, the report called for comparative protection on\nthe basis of religion: \"Where unfair discrimination is\ninvolved, the necessity of legal remedies is now generally\naccepted. To fail to provide a remedy against an injustice\nOnce again, a lack of evidence failed to convince politicians\nand policy makers of such \"an injustice.\" In trying to fill this\nevidence gap, the CRE a year later conducted a survey of\n4 SAGE Open\nagencies that dealt with complaints of religious discrimina-\ntion. As Weller (2006) notes, the findings were unconvincing\ndue to the low numbers of responses received. In the same\nyear, however, the Anti-Discrimination (Amendment) Act\n1994 was introduced extending levels of protection afforded\nto ethnic groups under the Race RelationsAct (RRA) 1976 to\nmonoethnic religious groups, namely, Jews and Sikhs. In\nresponse, two leaflets emerged: one from the Inner Cities'\nReligious Council's Challenging Religious Discrimination:\nA Guide for Faith Communities and Their Advisers; the\nother, the CRE's Religious Discrimination: Your Rights\nprotection to Muslims given their multiethnicity nor did the\nleaflet refer to Islamophobia.\nHowever, specific interest was being shown toward\nIslamophobia. Via the Runnymede Trust, a report from the\nCommission on Anti-Semitism noted how religious discrim-\nination was on the increase. Providing evidence to suggest\nthat levels of discrimination toward Jewish communities was\non the increase, the report added that the same was true of\nMuslim communities also (Runnymede Commission on\nAnti-Semitism, 1994). Although the report failed to substan-\ntiate this with evidence, it did refer to it as Islamophobia.\nFrom this, the CBMI was established and 3 years later, its\nreport, Islamophobia: A Challenge for Us All, was published\nthe debate quite significantly,\" it \"introduced into public dis-\ncourse the notion that, alongside shared dynamics of dis-\ncriminatory experience, there may also be particularities of\nMuslim experience signalled by the word `Islamophobia'\"\n(p. 306). Setting out 60 recommendations for national and\nlocal government as well as the voluntary and private sec-\ntors, the report sought \"decisive action\" across education,\nemployment, health, housing, and the media (CBMI, 1997,\np. iii). Although the report's definition and typology has\nundoubtedly shaped understanding, its recommendations\nwere less impacting. Once more, the lack of clear evidence\nfailed to convince many, not just of the need to act against\nIslamophobia but also of the phenomenon's very reality\nPublished soon after New Labour's 1997 electoral suc-\ncess, this lack of political commitment became apparent at\nthe report's launch at the House of Commons. Launched by\nthe then Home Secretary (Jack Straw), Straw immediately\ndismissed two major recommendations: equity for state-\nfunded, faith-based schools; and legislation to protect against\n\"[The Government] have immediate plans to legislate on racial\nviolence. I am sick to death of the mindless bigotry and thuggery\nwhich damages and destroys the lives of so many people in this\ncountry . . . It is a continuing shame to our society, and as a\nsociety, we must not tolerate it.\" (Q News, November 1-20,\nDespite the report seeking to establish Islamophobia as dis-\ntinct, Straw instead conflated manifestations of Islamopho-\nbia with those of \"racial\" violence. In failing to recognize\nthe necessary distinction between the two, the particularistic\nnature of Islamophobia--one based on markers of Muslim-\nor Islam-ness--seemed lost.\nThings Can Only Get Better: New\nLabour\nNew Labour, however, was more open to faith and religion\nthan its predecessor. For Gilliat-Ray (2004), Blair's language\nof \"social inclusion\" went beyond material wealth and pov-\nerty to incorporate citizenship and equality of opportunity.\nThe capacity for faith groups to provide voluntary services\nalso gave them economic viability (Gilliat-Ray, 2004). Other\ndrivers too were evident including the social deprivation of\nsome religious communities (Anwar & Bakhsh, 2003;\nWoodhead, 2010), demographic changes necessitating the\nestablishment of nonhistorical religious traditions (Bruce,\nchoosing to identify themselves religiously (Oliver-Dee,\nwas also \"the personal moral and Christian commitment of\nseveral members of the government including the prime\nminister\" (p. 96). And, of course, there was the recognition\nof growing anti-religious--anti-Muslim?--attitudes post-\nSilvestri (2010) argue it was this that prompted New Labour's\nunprecedented engagement with Muslim communities via\nMuslim organizations. McLoughlin even suggests that the\nMuslim Council of Britain was itself a creation of New\nLabour for this very purpose.\nIn terms of tackling religious discrimination as opposed to\nIslamophobia more specifically, New Labour oversaw two\ndevelopments soon after coming to government. The first\nwas the Human Rights Act (HRA) 1998. Although not\ndirectly applicable to discrimination, it did constitutionally\nestablish the freedom to religion or belief. The second was\nthe commissioning of research into religious discrimination\nin 1999. The report \"Religious Discrimination in England\nand Wales\" (Weller, Feldman, & Purdam, 2001) found that a\nmajority of Muslim respondents believed that hostility and\nabuse was on the increase. Overseen by Weller, he has since\nwritten how this \"involved walking something of a political\nand publicity tightrope, suspended between community\nexpectations, scientific research methodologies, the political\ncontext, the staff and perspectives of the Home Office's\nResearch, Development and Statistics Directorate\" (2006, p.\n308). At the time, some Muslims were unhappy with the\nfindings, critical for not being specific about Islamophobia\ngiven their belief this was the most prevalent form of reli-\ngious discrimination (Weller, 2006). Nonetheless,\nrecommendations for tackling religious discrimination\nemerged including the extension of race relations legislation,\nthe HRA and the largely defunct blasphemy laws (Weller et\nal., 2001). The creation of new laws--specific and generic--\nwas also posited and was afforded greater inquiry via the\nHomeOffice2001report\"TacklingReligiousDiscrimination:\nPractical Implications for Policy-Makers and Legislators\"\nIn the background to these developments, the fallout from\n9/11 was becoming evident. Government's focus shifted and\nbecame fixed on security and the threat of Al-Qaeda inspired\nterrorism. However, as research undertaken by the EUMC\nhighlighted, 9/11 also brought about an increase in anti-\nMuslim incidents and hostility:\nMuslims became indiscriminate victims of an upsurge of both\nverbal and physical attacks following the events of 11 September.\nFrom its findings, a new dynamism emanating directly from the\nattacks on the US saw manifestations of anti-Muslim and anti-\nIslamic expression become both more extreme and explicit, and\nlighted the government's fear of a real backlash, raising the\nspecter of a cancer-like \"normative\" Islamophobia spreading\nthrough British society. However, Denham's statement was\nanomalous. New Labour--whether advertently or inadver-\ntently--repeatedly associated matters of security with reli-\ngious discrimination at the same time as seemingly preferring\nnot to refer to a particularistic Islamophobia (Allen, 2011c).\nTherefore, while government quickly introduced legislation\nto protect those at risk from assault or abuse on the basis of\ntheir religion, they did through the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and\nSecurity Act 2001. Here, the law was expanded to afford\nequitable protection against violence to religious communi-\nties, whether multi- or monoethnic, as for racial groups. Other\nlegislation was also introduced. The Criminal Justice Act\n2003 extended sentencing provisions for offenses aggravated\nby hostility toward victims because of their religion (as well\nas sexual orientation or disability). The Racial and Religious\nHatred Act 2006 also made an offense of using threatening\nwords or behavior with the intention of stirring up hatred on\nthe basis of religion. This built upon the protection afforded\nWhile seeking to protect on the basis of religion, rarely\nwas Islamophobia specifically referenced. Neither was the\nlegislation overtly referred to in terms of protecting Muslims\nor their communities. Where Muslims were referred to, how-\never, was in the policy discourses linked to antiterror and\nsecurity. Whether seeking to curtail and control radicalism,\nproscribe extremist groups, or introduce new offenses includ-\ning acts preparatory to or encouraging of terrorism and dis-\nseminating terrorist publications, research shows how this\nreinforced many of the public's fears and anxieties about\nMuslims and Islam (Briggs, Fieschi, & Lownsbrough, 2006;\nKhan, 2009). History may offer an interesting precedent.\nrelationship between race relations legislation and immigra-\ntion. For Ratcliffe, despite introducing the RRA 1968, the\nLabour government of the time also needed to be seen to be\ntough on immigration and so simultaneously introduced the\nCommonwealth Immigrants Act 1968. The same occurred\nPaper on Commonwealth Immigrants. While recognizing\nthat religiously motivated discrimination (Islamophobia?)\nwas on the increase, it might also be that New Labour also\nfelt the need to be \"tough\" on security. Indeed, it could be\nargued that the political situation dictated this rather more so\nthan any political ideology. Nonetheless, it is clear that\nthroughout this period, two quite disparate issues became\nlinked and that a particularistic Islamophobia seemed lost.\nIn the latter years of its government, New Labour oversaw\nthe extensive broadening of the equalities framework, includ-\ning extending protection against discrimination on the basis\nof age, sexual orientation, and of course, religion or belief\nand none. Described as a \"radical change\" by Riddell and\nreligion or belief was first incorporated under the Equality\nAct 2006 before being strengthened by the Equality Act\n2010. Building on the European Employment Equality\n(Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003, which extended pro-\ntection across all forms of employment against discrimina-\ntion, harassment, and victimization, the 2006 Act also\nestablished the Equality and Human Rights Commission\n(EHRC). As with Weller's research half a decade earlier,\nsome Muslims were again unhappy that Islamophobia was\nseemingly negated and rarely mentioned by politicians or\npolicy makers.An example of this can be seen in the EHRC's\nreport \"Religion or Belief: Identifying Issues and Priorities\"\n(Woodhead, 2010). While Islamophobia is referred to, the\nreport offers scant recognition of its prevalence or scale, per-\nceived or actual. This could be consequential once more of a\ncontinued failure to necessarily evidence Islamophobia.\nWhat impact, if indeed any, the paucity of acknowledg-\nment for Islamophobia under New Labour had is open to\nquestion. As research published at the end of New Labour's\ngovernment highlights, society increasingly felt that Muslims\nwere likely to encounter prejudice on the basis of their reli-\ngion (Botcherby, Glen, Iganski, Jochelson, & Lagou, 2011).\nEighty-three percent--from a representative cross section of\ncontemporary British society--believed that levels of preju-\ndice were higher than 5 years previous. Public attitudes\ntoward Muslims and Islam had also changed. In the \"2009-\n2010 British SocialAttitudes Survey,\" not only were Muslims\nthe least popular religious community but more than half of\nrespondents also agreed they would be bothered by the build-\ning of a large mosque in their community. Only 15% felt the\nsame about a large church (National Centre for Social\nResearch, 2010). Such findings are not Islamophobic per se;\nbut they are indicative public attitudes becoming more\n6 SAGE Open\nnegative. This deterioration was felt by Muslims themselves\nwith research showing they were most likely to fear attack\ndue to skin color, race, or religion (DCLG, 2011). Of those\nMuslims who were victims, nearly half perceived this to be\nincited because of their religion (DCLG, 2011). In addition,\ndespite the introduction of legislation to protect on the basis\nof religion or belief, Muslims continued to feel they received\ntoo little government protection (DCLG, 2011).\nA Government That Does God: The\nCoalition\nAs before, it is surprising the emphasis afforded by the\nCoalition on the issue of Islamophobia since winning the\n2010 election. Most notable has been its willingness to refer\nto Islamophobia as a seemingly particularistic phenomenon.\nEven more surprising is Riddell and Watson's (2011) view\nthat equality issues would unlikely be a priority for the\nCoalition. Clearly not all the recent developments can be\nsolely attributed to the Coalition: the APPG was first called\nfor in March 2010 and so pre-dates the Conservative-Liberal\nDemocrat alliance. Launched months after the 2010 election\nin November, the APPG had the remit to investigate the\nforms, manifestations, and extent of discrimination against\nMuslims in today's Britain; review the effectiveness of rele-\nvant legislation; review existing mechanisms for recording\nanti-Muslim hate crimes; and investigate the role of the media\nin fostering intolerance toward Muslims (APPG, unpub-\nlished). The APPG sought to replicate the successes of the\nAnti-Semitism APPG. These included improving the report-\ning and recording ofAnti-Semitic incidents and attacks, mini-\nmizing Anti-Semitic activity on university campuses, and\nworking toward greater international collaboration to tackle\nAnti-Semitism online (APPG on Anti-Semitism, 2006).\nThe Islamophobia APPG was, however, dogged by con-\ntroversy soon after its launch. Following the appointment of\niENGAGE--a London-based Muslim organization--as the\nSecretariat, a number of Parliamentarians publicly resigned\nfrom the APPG, including the chair and vice-chair,\nConservative MP Kris Hopkins and Lord Janner of\nBraunstone, respectively. The resignations were in response\nto accusations in the media--including the influential\nConservative Home website--which suggested iENGAGE\nand its associates were \"Islamist sympathisers\" (Allen,\n2011a). What ensued was a series of highly polemical \"tit-\nfor-tat\" online articles from iENGAGE and their opponents.\nAside from the polemics, a number of commentators also\nquestioned whether iENGAGE had the necessary experience\nor credibility for the role. A full narrative of unfolding events\ncan be found in the report \"A Momentous Occasion\" (Allen,\n2011a) but after what has been described as an acrimonious\n\"trial by blog,\" the APPG's members voted to remove iEN-\nGAGE as Secretariat in the autumn of 2011. Although wel-\ncomed by many, any focus on Islamophobia was \"lost\" in the\nprocess and so set back the impetus that had been started\nthe APPG has achieved a tentative cross-party support and at\nthe time of writing, is devising a work program (Allen,\nSupporting the APPG, a CGWG was established in\nJanuary 2012 (Cross Party Working Group on Islamophobia\n& Anti-Muslim Hate Crime, 2012a). In addition, and with\nthe proviso to collect concrete evidence, the Coalition is\nfinancially backing the recently launched TELL MAMA\n(measuring anti-Muslim attacks) project, a telephone and\nonline third-party reporting service where victims and wit-\nnesses can record details about Islamophobic and anti-\nMuslim incidents. The CGWG and TELL MAMA projects\nhave distinct similarities to initiatives that emerged out of the\nAnti-Semitism APPG. Although too early to evaluate rela-\ntive success or failure, the Coalition seems to have shifted\nthe policy direction for tackling Islamophobia, preferring to\nalign Islamophobia with Anti-Semitism more than with the\nequalities framework. This can be seen in the backing of the\nTELL MAMA project and its clear resonance with the\nCommunity Safety Trust (CST), an equitable Jewish-run\norganization which assists victims of Anti-Semitism at the\nsame time as monitoring attacks and incidents. The evidence\nprovided by the reporting of the CST is widely acknowl-\nedged by the government, police, and media among others.\nComparing Approaches\nAlthough developments are ongoing, there are some clear\ndifferences between Coalition and New Labour approaches.\nFirst, the Coalition seems much more comfortable in naming\nIslamophobia and referring to it as distinct and particularis-\ntic. Although a lack of definition remains apparent, those\nsuch as Warsi have made bold and overt statements about\nIslamophobia. So too does the Coalition seem more con-\nvinced of the reality of the phenomenon albeit with the need\nto evidence this. In addition, with that comes the subsequent\nneed to commit to tackling Islamophobia. In comparison,\nNew Labour appeared tentative, even reluctant, to overtly\nrefer to Islamophobia. On the few occasions it did, it was\nseemingly as an aside or consequential. One might speculate\non the reasons for this. First, New Labour might not have had\na clear understanding or definition of what Islamophobia\nwas and so was reluctant to invest in either the term or con-\ncept. However, the Coalition is no different in this respect\nalthough they have taken initial steps to address this. Second,\nNew Labour could have been unconvinced of the evidence\nfor a particularistic Islamophobia. As per the EHRC, there\nwas a lack of evidence to substantiate the separation of\nIslamophobia from other religiously based forms of discrim-\nination (Woodhead, 2010). Again, the same is true of the\nCoalition. However, recently, it seems that the need for evi-\ndence is being addressed through the APPG and CGWG.\nIn terms of definition and evidence, there is little differ-\nence between New Labour and the Coalition except in terms\nof conception. For New Labour, Islamophobia was a phe-\nnomenon incorporated within broader understandings of\nequalities. As such, existing legislation was extended and\nstrengthened, in line with other forms of discrimination and\nas part of its social inclusion agenda. Questions remain, how-\never, because as the research has shown, a significant driver\nfor New Labour in its early years was the belief that\nNielsen, 2002). Why then did it not feature more particularly\nin political and policy discourses? Indeed, as public attitudes\ntoward Muslims and Islam deteriorated over the New Labour\ngovernment, such an approach might be deemed to have\nfailed. For Daniels and Macdonald (2005), policy and legis-\nlation do not in themselves change public attitudes: They\nmerely curb certain behaviors. Like Blakemore and Drake\n(1996) stated, equalities policies \"will not change the world\"\nadding, \"they were never designed to . . . the policies were\ndesigned to win majority consent rather than to force change\"\n(p.210). Maybe then, New Labour's equalities approach to\ntackling Islamophobia failed to win \"majority consent.\"\nUnder the Coalition, a clear shift away from aligning or\nincorporating Islamophobia within equalities is evident.\nMore so, the Coalition's aligns it with Anti-Semitism. In this\nway, Islamophobia--as Anti-Semitism beforehand--is seen\nas rather more exceptional and extraordinary. Under the\nCoalition, Islamophobia is seen to have distinct and differen-\ntiable features and characteristics and is clearly particularis-\ntic. Under New Labour, Islamophobia was quite different: It\nwas far more generalistic--ordinary and far from excep-\ntional. Maybe the Coalition has drawn from the historical\nroots of Islamophobia's emergence, first acknowledged in a\nreport into Anti-Semitism. Maybe also the Coalition has\nacknowledged how far-right and neo-Nazi groups having\ncontemporarily adopted Islamophobia as the ideology of\nchoice, in preference of traditional anti-Jewish ideologies. A\nfew points require further consideration. The first is that the\nprotection afforded by the extended equalities framework\nshould not be discounted. In establishing an evidence base,\nthe disaggregation of the EHRC's monitoring data on the\nbasis of religion or belief could prove extremely useful.\nSecond, there is a need to recognize how, at times,\nIslamophobia overlaps with other discriminatory phenomena\na distinct and different phenomenon might mean that its\nmore fluid edges are negated or overlooked, confusing the\nextent and limits of the phenomenon. Maintaining the equali-\nties perspective at the same time as affording a greater par-\nticularistic discourse therefore has the potential to culminate\nin a more complete approach to tackling Islamophobia\nbeginning to emerge.\nThe political discourses and settings of New Labour and\nthe Coalition also need to be considered. For New Labour, a\nstrong linkage between the discourses of tackling religiously\nmotivated prejudice, discrimination, and crimes with terror\nand security was apparent. As Becker and Bryman (2004)\namong others highlight, discourse is a recognized tool with\nwhich politicians reiterate and reinforce policy and thinking.\nThis linking therefore had a potentially twofold impact. First,\nit had the potential to further reinforce the public's fears and\nanxieties about Muslims and Islamic. Second, it had the\npotential to further place Muslims and their communities\nunder greater scrutiny and so bring about feelings of anger,\nalienation, mistrust, and even increase the likelihood of radi-\ncalization (Khan, 2009). Set against a discursive backdrop of\nthose such as Jack Straw's suggestion that the wearing of the\nniqab--full-face covering--presented a barrier to integra-\ntion (Allen, 2010), John Reid's requesting Muslim families\nlook for \"tell-tale\" signs of extremism in their children (BBC\nNews, 2006), and the Department of Education requesting\nuniversities to \"spy\" on students vulnerable to extremist ide-\nologies (BBC News, 2006) among others, the policy dis-\ncourse of New Labour was not always differentiable from\nsome of the more explicit discourses emanating from the\npopulist far-right: the British National Party and English\nDefence League (EDL). One might even question the extent\nto which New Labour's discourses attributed greater legiti-\nmacy to the far-right especially given its unprecedented\ngrowth during the three terms of New Labour government.\nFuture Policy Considerations for\nIslamophobia\nWith the Coalition explicitly recognizing and using the term\nIslamophobia, it might be suggested that it is a government\nthat is rather more \"Islamophobia friendly.\" Given Warsi's\ncomments about Islamophobia having passed the \"dinner\ntable test,\" maybe under the Coalition Islamophobia has now\npassed the \"political table test\" also. In doing so, it would\nseem that Islamophobia will remain on the political agenda\nfor the foreseeable future. With this in mind, it might be that\nthe same two problems that have dogged policy responses to\ntackling Islamophobia continue to be relevant: namely, defi-\nnition and evidence. With the APPG, CGWG, and TELL\nMAMA projects having all identified the latter as being\nimportant, it is hoped that some headway might be expected\nin the not too distant future. As regards definition, the same\nheadway might be less forthcoming. Although a single, for-\nmal definition is not an absolute requirement--there are\nindeed many different and competing definitions and con-\nceptualizations of racism, for instance--such a definition\nmight provide a metaphorical safety net under Weller's\n\"tightrope\" that the APPG, CGWG, and TELL MAMA proj-\nects will no doubt be forced to walk. However, maybe the\nmost pressing relates to Daniels and Macdonald's acknowl-\nedgment that laws alone do not change attitudes.\nConsequently, any legislation will need to be accompanied\nby additional policy approaches that seek to address the\n8 SAGE Open\nsocial problems which are causal to and exacerbating of ten-\nsions, prejudice, and by consequence, discrimination toward\nMuslims also. Given that public attitudes toward Muslims\nand Islam would seem to be becoming increasingly negative,\nchanging them--if indeed this is a task for government--\nwill present a very serious challenge. This challenge is fur-\nther compounded by the opposition that has been historically\nshown toward policies that tackle discrimination and pro-\nmote equality (Blakemore & Drake, 1996). The potential for\nthese challenges to have a neutralizing effect is therefore a\ndistinct possibility. Because of this, definition and evidence\nwill be crucially important in the need to explain in a clear\nand grounded manner exactly what Islamophobia is, why it\nis a problem, and why it needs to be tackled. Without defini-\ntion or evidence, confusion and a lack of clarity will continue\nto punctuate debates, discussions, and developments.\nUndoubtedly, the way ahead for politicians and policy mak-\ners will remain fraught with obstacles and potential pitfalls\neven if for the Coalition at least, Islamophobia has now\npassed the dinner table test. Ensuring that Islamophobia\npasses the political test--maintaining political (conversa-\ntional) civility--may still be more difficult.\n"
