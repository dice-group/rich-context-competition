Several studies have, for instance, shown\nthat individuals, especially men, highly value a potential mate's physical attractiveness\n(e.g., Buss, Shackelford, Kirkpatrick, and Larsen, 2001). Much more scarce are studies that\nrelate individuals' own characteristics to those they desire in a potential mate. With regard\nto these \"relative\" mate preferences two hypotheses have been presented. First, according\nto the \"similarity-attraction hypothesis\" individuals feel most attracted to potential partners\nwho, in important domains, are similar to themselves (e.g., Lucas, Wendorf, and Imamoglu,\n2004). Similar individuals are assumed to be attractive because they validate our beliefs\nabout the world and ourselves and reduce the risk of conflicts (e.g., Morry and Gaines,\n2005). Not surprisingly therefore, similarity between partners contributes to relationship\nsatisfaction (e.g., Lutz-Zois, Bradley, Mihalik, and Moorman-Eavers, 2006). Because a\nhappy and long-lasting intimate relationship contributes to both psychological and physical\nhealth (e.g., Berkman and Syme, 1994), similarity between partners increases their own and\ntheir offspring's chances of survival by helping maintain (the quality of) the pair bond. In\nA similar or complementary partner?\ncontrast, according to the \"complementarity hypothesis\" individuals feel most attracted to\npotential partners who complement them, an assumption that reflects the saying that\n\"opposites attract\" (e.g., Antill, 1983). Complementary individuals are assumed to be so\nattractive because they enhance the likelihood that one's needs will be gratified (e.g., De\nRaad and Doddema-Winsemius, 1992). For example, young women who lack economic\nresources may feel attracted to older men who have acquired economic resources and\ntherefore may be good providers (Eagly and Wood, 1999). In addition, from an\nevolutionary perspective, one might argue that seeking a complementary mate, rather than a\nsimilar one, may help prevent inbreeding.\nStudies on mate selection have consistently found support for the \"similarity-\nattraction\" hypothesis. Homogamy has been reported for numerous characteristics such as\nphysical attractiveness (e.g., White, 1980), attachment style (e.g., Klohnen and Luo, 2003),\npolitical and religious attitudes (e.g., Luo and Klohnen, 2005), socio-economic background,\nlevel of education and IQ (e.g., Bouchard and McGue, 1981). In contrast, support for the\n\"complementarity hypothesis\" is much scarcer. Although many individuals occasionally\nfeel attracted to \"opposites\", attractions between opposites often do not develop into\nserious intimate relationships and, when they do, these relationships often end prematurely\nSimilarity in Personality\nAlthough numerous studies have investigated partner similarity in domains such as\nattitudes, intelligence and physical attractiveness, personality has been far less often the\nfocus of study. More specifically, although several studies have revealed similarities\nbetween partners in their personalities (e.g., Buss, 1984; McCrae, Martin, Hreb\u00edckov\u00e1,\nUrb\u00e1nek, Boomsma et al., 2008) only few studies have investigated the extent to which\nsimilarity in personality leads to romantic attraction (Barelds and Dijkstra, 2007). From\ntheir finding that couples across age groups show the same partner similarities McCrae et\nal. (2008) conclude that mate selection, rather than convergence over time, accounts for\npersonality similarity among partners. The present study aimed to test this conclusion more\nexplicitly by asking people who are actively seeking for a long-term mate for their\npreferences for a potential long term mate's personality characteristics relative to those of\ntheir own. Do they seek for a partner who resembles their personality or who complements\nit?\nThe present study builds upon the Five Factor Model of personality (e.g., Digman,\n1990), that distinguishes between five personality factors, i.e. neuroticism, extraversion,\nopenness, conscientiousness, and agreeableness. In line with the \"similarity-attraction\"\nhypotheses, we expected individuals to desire mates who are similar to themselves with\nregard to their personality characteristics (Hypothesis 1). We base our expectation also on\nseveral studies conducted among married individuals. Most of those studies only found\nweak evidence for spousal similarity in personality (e.g., Barelds, 2005; Luo and Klohnen,\n2005). We, however, suspect that these studies do not fully reflect individuals' desire for a\nsimilar partner. A previous study of Barelds and Dijkstra (2007), for instance, shows that\nindividuals who take the time to get to know each other's personalities before they get\nromantically involved - in contrast to those who become romantically involved relatively\nquickly - end up with a partner with a more similar personality. Thus, although individuals\nmay desire a similar partner, they may not always succeed in selecting one.\nA similar or complementary partner?\nIn addition to desiring a similar partner, men and women have been found to value\ndifferent personality characteristics in a partner. More than men, women desire a reliable\n(e.g., Buss, 1994) and socially dominant partner (e.g., Sadalla, Kenrick and Vershure,\n1987). The latter refers to a partner who is characterized by self-confidence, extraversion,\nand authoritativeness (Sadalla et al., 1987). Women's preference for such a partner can be\nexplained by the fact that socially dominant men generally achieve a relatively high\nposition in the social hierarchy and, as a consequence, are relatively good providers (e.g.,\nSadalla et al., 1987). Women's desire for a relatively reliable mate has been attributed to\nwomen's preference for a long-term \u00ad as opposed to a short-term - mate who is willing to\nemotionally and financially invest in them and their offspring (e.g., Buss, 1994). In terms\nof the Five Factor Model of personality, we therefore expected women to desire a more\nconscientious, extraverted and emotionally stable (i.e. less neurotic) partner than men\n(Hypothesis 2).\nFinally, the present study explored a recent issue uncovered by Eastwick and Finkel\nfound that people often report partner preferences that are not compatible with their choices\nin real life. According to these authors people often lack the introspective awareness of\nwhat influences their judgments and behaviors in dating situations. In addition, according\nto Todd et al. (2007) people may be constrained by environmental factors: the available\nopportunities in the world may not match what people want. People also may be forced to\nmake tradeoffs between preferences on different dimensions or to lower their overall\nstandards in the face of competition from others. The present study aimed to examine\nanother possible explanation for the discrepancy between actual mate choice and desires for\na potential mate, i.e. the possibility that people are not consistent in their ideas about what\nthey value in a mate.\nThe Present Study\nIn sum, the present study hypothesized that individuals desire mates who are similar\nto themselves with regard to their personality in terms of the Five Factor Model\n(Hypothesis 1). We also expected women to desire a more conscientious, extraverted and\nemotionally stable partner than men (Hypothesis 2). Finally, the present study examined the\nextent to which people are consistent in their preferences for similar and complementary\nmates. We examined these hypotheses in a large sample of single individuals who were\nactively seeking a long-term mate. Especially those people can be expected to be motivated\nto find a suitable mate and to have well-formed opinions about what their future mate\nshould be like.\nMaterials and Methods\nParticipants and Procedure\neducated singles looking for a long-term mate. Mean age was 41.2 years (SD = 11.0, range\n19-73). Participants were, by means of an email message, invited to participate in an online\nstudy on relationships.\nA similar or complementary partner?\nMeasures\nParticipants' personality characteristics\nPersonality characteristics were assessed by an abridged version of Shafer's (1999)\n30-item bipolar rating scale designed to measure the Five Factor Model of personality. Ten\nitems, two for each factor, were selected that Shafer (1999) found to have the highest\nweighted factor loadings (Openness: uncreative\u00adcreative and unartistic-artistic;\nConscientiousness: lazy\u00adhardworking and unresponsible-responsible; Extraversion: shy\u00ad\noutgoing and quiet-talkative; Agreeableness: headstrong\u00adgentle and vengeful-forgiving;\nNeuroticism: at ease-nervous and unagitated-tense). The response scale was a five-point\nsemantic differential type scale ranging from one (the left trait describes me very well) to 5\n(the right trait describes me very well). Scores on the two items of each scale were summed\nto calculate a total score for each personality factor. For each of the five factors, greater\nvalues indicated higher levels of extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness,\nagreeableness and openness, respectively. A Principal Components Analysis with Varimax\nrotation supported the expected five-factor structure. Alphas were: Neuroticism: .67,\nExtraversion .62, Agreeableness .61, Conscientiousness .62, and Openness .70. These\nreliabilities are comparable to those found by Langford's (2003) abridged 15\u00aditem version\nof Shafer's scale.\nAn ideal partner's personality characteristics.\nAfter participants finished filling in the rating scales concerning their own\npersonality, a new online page with questions emerged on the computer screen. Participants\nwere not able to go back to the previous page. This procedure made it hard for participants\nto compare their ideal partner's personality ratings with those for themselves. Participants\nwere asked to what extent they desired the personality characteristics described above in a\npotential mate. Answers were assessed on the same five-point scales. The factor structure\nof the ideal partner ratings was supported in a Principal Components Analysis with\nVarimax rotation. Alphas were: Neuroticism .69, Extraversion .77, Agreeableness .61,\nConscientiousness .59, and Openness .75.\nGeneral mate preferences\nOn a new online page participants were presented with the following question:\nWhat do you find more important in a partner: A. that he/she complements you, or, B. that\nhe/she resembles you. Participants were asked to choose between these two alternatives.\nResults\nTo test Hypothesis 1, the prediction that individuals prefer mates who resemble\nthem with regard to their personality, correlational analysis were conducted relating\nparticipants' own personality scores to those of their ideal romantic partner. Confirming\nHypothesis 1, for all five personality characteristics positive correlations were found (p <\nAgreeableness scores .51 and Conscientiousness scores .60. This indicates that people\nclearly desire a partner who is similar to themselves with regard to the five personality\nfactors. Differences between the correlations for men and women were not significant, with\nA similar or complementary partner?\none exception: for Conscientiousness, the male correlation was r = .67, for women r = .45\nNonetheless, when explicitly asked what they preferred - a similar or a\ncomplementary mate - the majority of the participants (85.7%) reported preferring a\ncomplementary partner over a similar one. Men and women did not differ in these\npercentages (Chi-square = .02, > p). Within these two groups \u00ad those who preferred a\nsimilar mate and those who preferred a complementary mate - one significant difference\nwas found between the correlations for Extraversion (rs were .66 vs. .48, z = 2.58, p < .01):\nthe preference for a mate who resembles the self in extraversion was stronger among\nparticipants who explicitly said to prefer a similar mate over a complementary one.\nSurprisingly, the other self-ideal partner correlations were not significantly different\nbetween these two groups.\nTo test Hypothesis 2 mean personality ratings for the ideal partner were calculated\nseparately for men and women (see Table 1). Confirming Hypothesis 2, women desired a\nmore conscientious, extraverted and emotionally stable (less neurotic) partner than men. To\ninvestigate whether the sex differences in the ideal partner's personality remained\nsignificant when controlling for self ratings of personality, five ANCOVAs (one for each\npersonality characteristic of the Five Factor Model) were conducted using participant sex as\nan independent variable, the ideal partner's personality as the dependent variable and self-\nratings of personality as a covariate. Results showed that the gender differences in the ideal\nmate's personality remained intact when controlling for participants' own personality\nTable 1.

Columns with different subscripts differ significantly (p < .01).\nDiscussion\nThe large correlations between individuals' own personality and their ideal\npartner's personality strongly support the \"similarity-attraction\" hypothesis: individuals\nclearly desire a potential partner with a similar personality. In addition to this preference\nfor similarity, as expected, women desired a more conscientious, extraverted and\nA similar or complementary partner?\nemotionally stable partner than men. We also asked participants about their preference for a\nsimilar or complementary partner in general. Our study found that individuals often hold\nseemingly contradictory beliefs about their ideal romantic partner. That is, whereas they\nwish for a partner who resembles them in terms of personality, when asked about their\npreferences in general, most individuals indicate that they desire a complementary partner\ninstead of a similar one. A possible explanation for this seemingly contradiction is that\nindividuals have taken the general question about similarity/complementarity to be about\nother characteristics than personality, such as age, height, intelligence or religion. In that\ncase, our findings are not contradictory at all. That is, both similarity and complementarity\nmay play a role in partner selection, but with regard to different partner characteristics (e.g.,\nDe Raad and Doddema-Winsemius, 1992). More specifically, according to Kerckhoff and\nDavis (1962) initial attraction between partners is based on social and cultural similarities,\nsuch as corresponding social status, education or religious background, which yield a field\nof eligibles. From this field of eligibles individuals choose each other on the basis of\ncomplementarity of needs. As discussed in the introduction section, both of these mating\nconceptions \u00ad the preference for similarity and complementarity - may have their own\nevolutionary advantages, and, as a result, may both play a role in mate selection.\nBut what if participants did apply the general question about mate preferences, at\nleast partially, to their ideal partner's personality? In that case, people may not be (fully)\naware of their true partner preferences or may be confused about their mate preferences.\nWhen asked about their preferences for a mate people may partially draw upon lay theories\nof romantic attraction rather than their true desires for a mate. In general, the notion that\n\"opposites attract\" is a relatively popular lay theory of romantic attraction: people often\nthink that individuals who possess complementary characteristics are highly attractive to\neach other (Barelds and Dijkstra, 2007). In contrast, looking for someone who is similar to\noneself may be perceived as \"boring\". These popular lay theories may confuse people and\nlead them away from their true partner desires. When individuals become romantically\ninvolved, this type of confusion may create all kind of relationship problems and even lead\nto divorce. In The Netherlands, where this study was conducted, almost 40% of the\ndivorcees report mismatches in personalities as the major cause of their break-up (De\nGraaf, 2006; see also Amato and Previti, 2003). The present study helps to shed light on\nthis issue.\nA limitation of the present study is that the explicit question that asked participants\nto choose between a complementary and a similar partner did not specifically refer to a\npotential partner's personality. As a result, as noted before, it is possible that individuals\napplied the question to other characteristics than a partner's personality characteristics,\nsuch as physical attractiveness or intelligence. In our defense, we, however, would like to\nargue that, because personality is such a central feature of a potential mate (e.g., Klohnen\nand Mendelsohn, 1998), it is highly likely that individuals applied the general question, at\nleast to some extent, to a potential partner's personality. In addition, because the questions\nabout preferences for an ideal mate's personality followed directly after the personality\nratings individuals were likely to be sufficiently primed to think about personality. Another\nlimitation is that our study examined mate preferences of college-educated individuals\nonly. As a result, it is questionable whether our findings can be generalized to the mate\npreferences of lower-educated people. Nonetheless, in revealing such diverse beliefs about\nwhat individuals desire in a romantic partner, the present study may help understand\nA similar or complementary partner?\nrelationship problems and the puzzling fact why individuals sometimes choose such\nproblematic partners.\nReferences\nAmato, P.R., and Previti, D.
