This report describes the prevalence and correlates of functional blindness and visual impairment\namong older Mexican Americans, using data on 2800 respondents from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Ep-\nidemiological Study of the Elderly.\nMethods. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between cor-\nrected bilateral distant vision and sociodemographic characteristics, selected health conditions, self-reported health sta-\ntus, health care utilization, and functional dependence on the basis of assistance needed for basic and instrumental\nactivities of daily living (ADLs).\nResults. Using a modified Snellen test for distance visual acuity, 5% of older Mexican Americans were found to be\nfunctionally blind, and 13.5% were found to be visually impaired. Vision loss was significantly associated with older\nage, lower education, hypertension, diabetes, poor self-rated health, and hospitalization during the year prior to the inter-\nview. Over 50% of functionally blind subjects required assistance with at least one basic ADL, compared with 15% of\nthose who were visually impaired and 8% of those who were not visually impaired.\nConclusions. The prevalence of functional blindness in this sample of elderly Mexican Americans was higher than\nreported for the general elderly population, yet they also have higher rates of adequate vision because of the low preva-\nlence of visual impairment. The results suggest a need for more research on the prevalence and impact of functional\nblindness and visual impairment on the health of older Mexican Americans.\nISUAL impairment, one of the most common condi-\ntions affecting older adults, is a leading cause of func-\ntional disability (1,2) and diminished quality of life (3). It is\nwell accepted that visual impairment becomes more preva-\nlent with increasing age (4,5) and can adversely affect basic\nand instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs). Other\nrisk factors associated with visual impairment include occu-\npational exposure to sunlight, cigarette smoking (6), alcohol\nconsumption (7), and low socioeconomic status (8).\nA number of population-based studies have provided de-\ntailed estimates of the prevalence, risk factors, and conse-\nquences of vision problems among older adults (4,9\u00ad11).\nAmong the general population aged 65 and older, the preva-\nlence of functional blindness (visual acuity worse than 20/\nRelatively few studies, however, have examined visual acu-\nity among Hispanic populations. Data from the Hispanic\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey in the early\n1980's suggested that Hispanics may have a lower preva-\nlence of impaired vision compared with non-Hispanic\nwhites (12), with Mexican Americans experiencing severe\nto mild visual impairment ranging from 5% to 12%. How-\never, these studies have been limited by small sample sizes\nfor elderly Hispanics, and no data are available for Hispan-\nics over 74 years of age, the age range in which visual im-\npairment is most prevalent.\nThe present study examines the extent of functional\nblindness and visual impairment among older Mexican\nAmericans, as well as demographic and health correlates,\nusing data from the Hispanic Established Population for Ep-\nidemiological Studies of the Elderly (HEPESE).\nMETHODS\nSample\nThe HEPESE is the latest in a series of large-scale epide-\nmiologic studies conducted throughout the United States,\nfunded by the National Institute on Aging. The initial wave\nTexas, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and California,\nwith fieldwork conducted by Harris Interactive, Inc. Area\nprobability sampling was used to select a total of 3050 Mex-\nican Americans aged 65 and older (86% response rate). For\na more detailed description of the sampling procedure, see\nBlack and colleagues (13). The present study describes vi-\nsual acuity for 2800 subjects. Data were not available for\n250 subjects who were interviewed by proxy, refused visual\nV\nassessment, or were too ill or cognitively impaired to be\ntested.\nMeasures\nVisual acuity was measured using both self-report and\nperformance-based assessment. Respondents who reported\nbeing blind were not further tested for visual acuity. Cor-\nrected bilateral distant visual acuity was assessed using a\nmodified Snellen test utilizing directional Es to estimate\nleagues (4). This method divides distance vision into three\ncategories: less than or equal to 20/40 designated as ade-\nquate vision, greater than 20/40 to less than or equal to 20/\n200 designated as visual impairment, and greater than 20/\n200 designated as functional blindness.\nSociodemographic measures included respondents' age,\ngender, years of education, and total annual household income.\nHealth-related measures included self-reported health sta-\ntus (poor, fair, good, or excellent), having an overnight hos-\npital stay within the year prior to interview, and having a\nphysician's diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes. Subjects\nreporting diabetes or hypertension were asked if they were\ncurrently taking medication for these conditions.\nTo measure disability, basic ADLs and instrumental ac-\ntivities of daily living (IADL) were assessed with a modi-\nfied version of the Katz ADL and OARS IADL scales\nAnalyses\nMantel-Haenszel chi-square analyses were used to evalu-\nate differences in the prevalence of functional blindness and\nvisual impairment across all sociodemographic and health-\nrelated measures. Logistic regression models were then con-\nstructed to assess the risk of functional blindness and visual\nimpairment, with adequate vision as the reference category.\nInitial models examined the risk of functional blindness and\nvisual impairment across sociodemographic factors, fol-\nlowed by models that added physician-diagnosed hyperten-\nsion and diabetes. All analyses incorporated weights using\nSAS (16) and design effects using SUDAAN (17).\nRESULTS\nwomen and more than 65% were younger than 75 years of\nage. The average level of education was only 4.9 years. Over\nhalf the sample reported a total annual household income of\nless than $10,000. Visual assessment results indicated that\nby proxy) who reported that they were blind. A total of 294\n(13.5%) subjects were considered to be visually impaired.\nFunctional blindness increased significantly with age from\nolder (p  .001). Visual impairment also increased with age,\nsubjects 85 and older. An inverse relationship for education and\nvisual impairment was evident, with significantly more visual\nimpairment among subjects with lower education (p  .01).\nMore than 5% of subjects with hypertension and 9% with\ndiabetes were functionally blind and significantly more\nlikely to be functionally blind or visually impaired com-\npared with nonhypertensive subjects (p  .05) or nondia-\nbetics (p  .001). Subjects taking insulin for their diabetes\nwere significantly more likely to be functionally blind or vi-\nsually impaired than diabetics not taking insulin (p  .001).\nSubjects reporting poor health status as well as those hospi-\ntalized overnight within the past year were more likely to be\nfunctionally blind (p  .05). Table 1 shows the results of lo-\ngistic regressions assessing the risk of functional blindness\nand visual impairment associated with age, gender, educa-\ntion, diabetes, and hypertension. Initial analyses indicated\nthat functional blindness and visual impairment were strongly\nassociated with increasing age. With the inclusion of physi-\ncian-diagnosed hypertension and diabetes, age and diabetes\nwere found to be significantly associated with both func-\ntional blindness and visual impairment.\nTable 2 shows the rates of disabilities across vision cate-\ngories. Subjects who were functionally blind were much\nmore likely than other subjects to have both ADL and IADL\ndisabilities. Respondents with visual impairment did not\nhave rates of ADL disability significantly higher than those\nwith adequate vision, although the rates of IADL disability\nwere more comparable to the functionally blind.\nDISCUSSION\nThe results of the present study suggest important differ-\nences in the prevalence of visual acuity among older Mexi-\ncan Americans in comparison to the general population. A\ncomparison of prevalence of functional blindness and visual\nimpairment reported by Salive and colleagues (4), presented\nin Table 3, demonstrates these differences. Functional\nblindness among Mexican Americans aged 71 or older is\nconsiderably higher (8.2%) than that reported for other\nEPESE sites (4.6%) for the same age range. In addition,\nwhereas the prevalence of functional blindness for all age\ngroups except those aged 85 years or older was higher in the\npresent study than previously reported, the prevalence of vi-\nTable 1.

As a result, adequate vi-\nsion was more common in this group than in the general\nelderly population.\nThe inverse relationship found for education and impair-\nment in this study was similar to that found among older non-\nHispanics in the other EPESE studies (4). No relationship\nwas found in this study for prevalence of functional blindness\nor visual impairment across other sociodemographic vari-\nables, including gender and level of income, results consis-\ntent with most previous reports; however, there are some ex-\nceptions (4,9). The most common explanation for differences\nin socioeconomical status and vision loss has been the eco-\nnomic burden for those who are unable to afford medical\ntreatment to correct their vision loss. Because over 85% of\nthe subjects in the present study were eligible for Medicare, it\nis possible that sufficient access to ophthalmologic care could\nbe a factor lessening the negative effect of lower income.\nThe risk of functional blindness associated with increas-\ning age was very evident in the present study. Mexican\nAmericans 85 years of age and over were at 10 times the\nrisk of becoming blind as those aged 65 to 70. In contrast,\nthe risk of visual impairment associated with increasing age\nwas much lower than the risk of functional blindness, a\nfinding that is consistent with other EPESE findings (4).\nThe influence of diabetes on functional blindness and vi-\nsual impairment found in this sample of older Mexican\nAmericans was also consistent with previous studies (4).\nOlder Mexican Americans have been shown to have a higher\nprevalence of diabetes compared with the general population\n(18), with a higher prevalence of retinopathy compared with\nnon-Hispanic diabetics (12), which could have a direct effect\non the prevalence of functional blindness.\nThe association of functional blindness and visual im-\npairment with self-rated health was consistent with what\nTable 2.

After controlling for\nage, subjects in poorer health were significantly more likely\nto be functionally blind. It is possible that declining health\ncould be correlated with loss of vision as a function of the\nphysiologic changes associated with normal aging.\nOverall, subjects with functional blindness reported much\nhigher rates of ADL and IADL disability compared with\nsubjects who were visually impaired or who had adequate\nvision. This level of disability among functionally blind\nsubjects can have important clinical implications among\nolder adults, requiring interventions and adaptive strategies\nto lessen the negative impact of the loss of independence.\nIn summary, this study provides added insight into the\nprevalence and risk of functional blindness and visual im-\npairment among older Mexican Americans. Whereas many\nfindings were consistent with previous studies, several dif-\nferences were found that warrant further investigation.\n"
