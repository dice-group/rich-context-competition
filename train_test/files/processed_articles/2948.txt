For some years now economists - especiaIly in the\nAnglo-Saxon countries - have been discussing the credit channel approach, which embraces\nthe credit supply as weIl as the interest rate channeL A crucial factor in this context is that\ninformation between the lender and the borrower is asymmetric. This primarily affects small\nenterprises, whose creditworthiness is, as a rule, not as good as that oflarge firms and which\nare heavily reliant on bank credit. The credit channel theory states that, for small enterprises,\na stricter monetary policy stance results in a higher cost of borrowed funds than for larger\nenterprises or even in credit rationing. The result is that this group ofenterprises cuts its asset\nformation particularly sharply.\nA number of studies have confirmed the existence of the credit channel, particularly for the\nUnited States. By contrast, only few German studies to date have analysed the susceptibility\nof enterprises' investment behaviour to monetary policy stimuli in the context of the credit\nchannel. The verification of this link is the subject of the present study. The Bundesbank's\ncorporate balance sheet statistics serve as a database. These statistics inc1ude not only\nenterprises subject to disc10sure requirements but also relatively small firms, which dominate\nthe German corporate landscape. A simple descriptive-statistical approach was chosen for the\nevaluation owing to the limitation to group data and to periods with a restrictive monetary\npolicy. To this extent, this research is a first contribution to the credit channel discussion in\nGermany.\nThe existence of the credit channel cannot be demonstrated empirically by means of the\navailable source material for Germany, in contrast to the United States. Regardless of the\nperiod under review and the legal form ofthe firms, bank loans and other liabilities as weIl as\nthe cost ofcredit provide no indication for any discrimination of smaller enterprises by banks\nin the wake of a restrictive monetary policy stance. Two aspects no doubt playa role in this\ncontext: the house bank principle, which is widespread in Germany, and the nature of\nbankruptcy legislation and property law, whieh in Germany is more favourable to ereditors\nthan abroad, reduce the asymmetrie distribution of information between banks and small\nfinns.\nThe source material used constitutes a positive sample ofenterprises, however. Owing to the\nconstruetion ofcylindered samples it comprises enterprises whieh are at least five years old,\ni.e. it contains no very young finns. Moreover, the data are derived ftom the annual accounts\nsubmitted in the context ofrediscount business, whieh means that the enterprises sampled all\nhave a relatively good creditworthiness. Even if, consequently, hardlyany \"marginal finns\"\nare ineluded in the source material, the rejection ofthe credit channel hypothesis for the core\nofthe manufacturing sector ultimately seems to be quite justified owing to the specific insti\ntutional regulations in Gennany.\nContents \n\n\n2.

Introduction\nUp to about the middle of the eighties the model of frictionless or perfect financial markets\nprevailed in macroeconomics. The financial system only had the character ofa \"veil\". Both\nthe traditional textbook ISILM analysis and real business cyc1e models set out from this\nassumption. For over ten years now an extensive literature based on the market error of\nasymmetrie information flows between lender and borrower1 has been emerging which\nshows that the financial sphere certainly can influence real economic developments. The\nmonetary policy transmission mechanism is also affected by this. Besides the usual interest\nrate channel, the so-called credit channel has a bearing. Interest-rate-related responses of\neconomic agents are intensified by information-related restrietions of the credit supply.\nThis mainly affects small enterprises whose creditworthiness is, as a role, worse than that\nof large firms and which are particularly reliant on bank loans. A restrictive monetary\npolicy stance then results not only in higher interest rates on securities but also in relatively\nhigher costs of borrowed funds or even in credit rationing for small enterprises owing to\nmoral hazard and adverse selection. The consequence is - according to the credit channel\nliterature - that this group offirms has to cut its asset formation particularly sharply. Hence,\nmonetary policy has a different effect on enterprises depending on their size. There were\nsimilar approaches during the fifties, but it was only in the context ofthe discussion on the\ncredit channel that these ideas were given an extensive microeconomic foundation through\nthe integration ofinformation economics in the transmission mechanism.\nThe discussion on the credit channel is currently still in fuH swing and unlikely to be\nconc1uded for a long time.2 This applies, in particular, to the studies which seek to verify\n*I should like to thank J.

So\nfar a great number of US studies have found indications suggesting the existence of the\ncredit channel; however, on closer examination, their validity is not completely convincing.\nThe difficulty is, in particular, that an identification problem has to be solved. The credit\nchannel argument is based on supply-side responses in respect of bank loans, whereas in\nthe traditional approach the trend in bank loans is determined by demand. By contrast, the\nonly observable factor is the \"equilibrium\" credit volume, in which supply and effective\ndemand are identical.\nFor Germany there have only been a few studies to date which deal with the dependence of\nenterprises' behavioural responses on the financing structure; this applies above all to the\nlinkage ofthis phenomenon to the monetary policy context. The verification or negation of\nthis link is the subject of the present study. The Bundesbank's cOIporate balance sheet\nstatistics serve as a database. These statistics are superior to other available databases both\nin terms ofquality and volume. A particular advantage is the fact that these statistics cover\nnot only large public limited companies - as is mostly the case in the literature - but also\nrelatively small firms, which dominate the German corporate landscape and which are most\nlikely to be affected by the existence of a credit channel, according to theoretical\nperceptions. Owing to the limitation to group data and to periods of a restrictive monetary\npolicy stance, a simple descriptive-statistical approach was chosen for the empirical\nevaluation. Based as it is on the corporate balance sheet statistics, this study is to be seen as\na first contribution to the credit channel discussion for Germany.\nThe study begins with abrief overview of the credit channel approach. First of all, the\ntraditional textbook transmission channel is outlined so as to be able to elaborate the\ncharacteristics ofthe credit channel more clearly in section 3. Apart ftom the description of\nthe theory, particular importance has been attached to the numerous empirical approaches\nwhich have so far been developed to solve the identification problem (section 4). Section 5\nprovides an empirical analysis on the basis of the Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet\nstatistics. Following a detailed description of the data and methodology used, the periods\nbe demonstrated for Germany. The final section critically discusses the results and\nconsiders possible approaches for further research in this field.\n2. Conventional transmission mechanism\nThe traditional transmission mechanism known from macroeconomic textbooks, which is\nalso known as the interest rate channel or money view channel,3 can be briefly described as\nfollows: a reduction in the money stock, regarded as an exogenous variable, results in an\nincrease in the interest rate which leads to a reduction in asset formation by virtue of the\noptimum condition that the interest rate equals the marginal productivity of capital. In line\nwith this, interest-rate-related consumption declines as weIl. In the 1SILM diagram, this\nleads to a shift ofthe LM curve to the left - from LM( to LM\n2 - given a movement along\nthe IS\\ curve (see figure 1; for the 1S\ncurve, see section 3.3). At least in the short term,\nwithout further price adjustments, monetary policy has a real impact since overall output\ndeclines from Y( to Y\n2 \u00b7 In these models there are only two financial assets, namely money\nand securities, with all other possible assets being regarded as perfect substitutes for\nsecurities. A further key characteristic is the assumption of aperfeet capital market. This\nmeans, firstly, that the financial strueture of enterprises has no significance for real\ndecisions (Modigliani/Miller, 1958) and, secondly, that banks play only a passive roIe in\neconomie activity (Fama, 1980). These properti~s are uItimately reflected in the idea that\nthe supply of financial resources is completely elastie vis-a-vis the prevailing interest rate.\nOverall, the financial sphere has the eharacter ofa \"veil\".\nTransmission and ISILM model Figure 1\nr\nYj y\n3 Mishkin (1995) gives an overview of different transmission channels.\n3. Credit chaooel approach\nIn the mid-eighties several US economists attempted to supplement the traditional\nmonetary transmission channel by a microeconomically founded approach. This was\ntriggered, in particular, by the observation that fixed asset formation and stockbuilding\nfrequently responded strongly to restrictive monetary policy measures, although the central\nbank's interest rate changes tended to be small. A suitable basis for the explanation was a\nresearch theory which, since Jaffee/Russell (1976) and StiglitzIWeiss (1981), had dealt\nwith information problems in the financial markets. As a result, on the basis of asymmetric\ninformation between lender and bolTOwer, both the existence of banks and the financing\nstructure ofeconomic agents were accorded significance for the real sphere; this means that\nthe paradigm of the \"veiI\" of the financial system and of the perfect capital market was\nabandoned.4 A key feature of the credit channel argument is that bank loans play an\nimportant role. They can no longer be regarded as a perfect substitute for securities but\ninstead have to be integrated into the transmission process as an autonomous assel.\nMonetary policy measures no longer affect only the interest rates for securities but also the\ncredit supply, Le. the interest rate charged on bank loans.s In this way a restrictive\nmonetary policy stance may have a relatively great impact on asset formation, even though\ncentral bank interest rates rise only slightly. The basic features of the approach described\nhere were already discussed in the fifties under the heading \"availability doctrine\", but the\napproach now has a much firmer microeconomic foundation since the \"supply problems\"\nare no longer specified exogenously.6 In terms of its intention, the credit channel theory is\nascribable to new Keynesian macroeconomics, which seeks, in contrast to new classical\nmacroeconomics and the real business cycle theory, to substantiate disequilibria or cyclical\nfluctuations, i.e. traditional Keynesian positions, by taking account of market faHures, such\nas external effects, imperfect competition and asymmetric information.7 The literature on\nthe credit channel meanwhile distinguishes two variants - the balance sheet channel and the\nbank lending channel - which are based on different mechanisms but ultimately have\n4 Tbe fundamental importance of the financial sphere has been repeatedly discussed since the fifties without\nultimately predominating over the irrelevance hypothesis. Examples are Gurley/Shaw (1955, 1960), Minsky\n~ As Gertler/Gilchrist (1993, pp. 45-50) strongly emphasise. the credit channel is based on corresponding\ninterest rate movements, with the result that the market is cleared, andIor on slow interest rate adjustments\ncoupled with cremt rationing.\n6 Abrief description of the availability doctrine IOd the basic features of the credit channel approach is given\n7 Illing (1992) attempts to c1assify the various theoretical approaches.\nsimilar effects. Before dealing with the economic policy implications, the two channels\nwill initially be explained in greater detail.\n3.1. Balance sheet channel\nFor the balance sheet channel, which is also called the \"broad credit channel\" or \"financial\naccelerator\" in the literature, the influence ofmonetary policy on the goodwill or net wealth\nof the firm is paramount.8 The theory postulates that a restrictive monetary policy reduces\nthe (net) wealth or creditworthiness of the enterprise and thus its access to bank loans \neither through credit rationing or a corresponding increase in lending rates. As a result,\nasset formation falls below the interest rate channel. The balance sheet channel primarily\naffects small enterprises because their financial position or creditworthiness is less\nfavourable than that of large firms and because a further deterioration is likely to lead to\nfinancing bottlenecks. In the literature several possibilities are discussed to establish how\nmonetary policy may affect the \"net wealth\" of a firm (see Mishkin, 1995). Probably the\noldest variant can be ascribed to Fisher (1933) and describes an unexpected decline in the\nprice level as a result ofa restrictive monetary policy. The consequence is a rise in real debt\nor a fall in net wealth. Besides this, an increase in interest rates is frequently associated\nwith a decrease in share prices, which likewise indicates a decline in net wealth. If\ngoodwill is regarded as the present value of a11 future income surpluses, a higher interest\nrate (or discounting factor) reduces the net wealth and therefore the creditworthiness of the\nenterprise. A reduction in net wealth results in an increase of moral hazard and adverse\nselection. In order to absorb the associated risks, the lenders will have to intensify their\ncredit assessment and monitoring activities, which is compensated for by an add-on to\ninterest rates in the form of a premium.9 Figure 2 shows this for the microeconomic case.\nThe firm's own funds are limited to volume E. Borrowed funds, which are needed to effect\nadditional asset formation, are available in the case of the perfect capital market in\nunlimited amount at the interest rate r\nj ;\nr\nt\ncorresponds at the same time to the opportunity\ncost of internal financing. At a given demand 0 and a credit supply curve SVK' an\ninvestment volume results. If the market failure of asymmetric information is\nIVK\n8 Analogons considerations are possible in respect ofhouseholds. So far, however, the discussion has centred \n\n\n9 In the case of credit rationing the interest rate does not respond at all or responds only marginally and, \n\ninstead, the adjustment is made via the credit supply. Since the losses to be expected exceed the interest yield, \n\nthe interest rate is not raised correspondingly, despite positive excess demand. \n\nadmitted, SI is the valid supply eurve;10 owing to the higher equilibrium lending rate\n(eompared with the securities rate), asset formation falls to II'\nGiven asymmetric\ninformation, the SI slope can be explained by the fact that in the case of outside fmancing\nmoral hazard increases and is offset by higher interest rates. An increase in securities rates\nfrom to r\ntriggered by the central bank \"normally\" leads to a parallel shift in the credit\nr\nl\nsupply eurve. As a result of the higher interest rate, asset formation is reduced to I;. If\naccount is also taken of the decrease in net wealth, the credit supply curve S2 is steeper.\nThe costs incurred as a result ofthe information problems must be paid for in the form of a\nhigher lending rate. The asset formation volume amounts to 1\n.11 The costs of the\nfinancial accelerator can be seen in the fact that even less is invested than in the second\nbest state.\nCredit channel in microeconomic terms Figure 2\nr\n~~------------~~r--r~~--------------\nrl ~------------~~r--r--------+---~----\nD\n\n\na fonnal exemplification ofthe balance sheet channel theory. \n\n11 This result can also be derived in tbe case of credit rationing if the lender restricts bis credit supply to \n\nEI\n2 - at the prevailing interest rate. \n\n3.2. Bank lending channel\nThe bank lending channel is based on the assumption that small finns are largely reliant on\nbank loans, whereas large enterprises may obtain financial resources through several\nchannels. Owing to asymmetric infonnation, small enterprises, in particular, are unable to\ntap additional sources of finance through the issue of shares or securities. A restrictive\nmonetary policy stance causes banks to cut down the imperfect substitutes loans and\nsecurities in the wake of a reduction in their deposit base. Since no alternative outside\nfunds are available, the credit supply decreases and the cost of credit rises more sharply\nthan the securities rate. The bank lending channel, too, can be illustrated by means of\nfigure 2. SI is the credit supply curve given asymmetric infonnation, the COInmon basis of\nthe bank lending and balance sheet channels. Owing to the unequal state of infonnation,\nexternal financing is more expensive than internal financing. The perfect capital market is\ncharacterised by SVK as a benchmark. An increase in securities rates from rl\nto r2 as a\nresult of a tighter monetary policy leads not only to a parallel shift of SI but to a spiralling\nas a result ofthe scarcer credit supply mentioned. The relevant supply curve is described by\nS2; the amount of asset fonnation is 12 at the prevailing equiIibrium lending rate. In spite\nofdifferent mechanisms, the bank lending channel and the balance sheet channel ultimately\narrive at the same result. The bank lending channel is strongly disputed in the literature,\nhowever.12 In particular, it is questioned whether, in the wake of financial innovations, the\ncredit supply really can be rigorously restricted. For banks - and this is the prevailing\nargumentation in the United States - may increasingly decouple themselves from monetary\npolicy by obtaining funds, for example, through certificates of deposit not subject to\nminimum reserve requirements so as tocbe able to continue to meet enterprises' requests for\ncredit. To this extent, recent developments in the financial market sphere are likely to have\nat least resulted in a weakening of the bank lending channel theory. \"In summary, because\nof financial deregulation and innovation, the importance of the traditional bank lending\nchannel has most likely diminished over time\" (Bernanke/Gertler, 1995, p. 42). Compared\nwith the bank lending channel theory, which appears to be very \"mechanistic\", the balance\nsheet channel argument seems to be more convincing. In more recent articles, the bank\nlending channel - though in a slightly modified fonn - is treated as a special case of the\nbalance sheet channel (see section 4.1). The creditworthiness of small banks (like that of\nsmall enterprises) declines more sharply in the case of a restrictive monetary policy than\nthat of large banks which, in turn, has an adverse impact on both the procurement of funds\nand lending.\n3.3. The credit channel and its economic poUcy significance\nAn interesting aspect of the credit channel is that monetary policy no longer has a\nsymmetric effect on economic agents but, for information-related reasons, a selective one;\nas a rule, small enterprises are likely to be affected more strongly by restrictions in the\ncredit supply than large ones.13 Monetary policy may then even have regional effects\nowing to varying geographicallocations of finns (see CarlinolDeFina, 1996). As a result of\nthe asymmetric effects on the cOIporate landscape. interest rate subsidies and other\ngovernment assistance for cOIporate loans. such as warranties and garantees, may be\nunderstood as measures which - contrary to the usual opinion - do not necessarily \"weak:en\"\nmonetary policy on account of the lower cost of finance but instead may smoothen the\nselective effect ofrestrictive monetary policy stimuli (see Bernanke/Gertler. 1990, pp. 104\nCompared with the interest rate channel, the credit channel implies a stronger effect of\nmonetary policy on real economic variables as a result of the additional restriction in the\nform of bank lending. In the ISILM model this is reflected in the fact that a restrictive\nmonetary policy not only results in a shift in the LM curve - as usual - but also in the IS\ncurve since, in keeping with the microeconomic analysis, asset formation additionally\ndepends on the lending rate or the availability of credit.14 Hence, output declines more\nsharply over the short tenn than in the model with the perfect capital market. In figure 1\nthis is reflected by a shift in the IS curve from ISI to IS2\nand in a fall in output from Y2 to\nY\n3 \u00b7 It is to be noted that such a reaction may also be evoked by other occurrences which\nhave an adverse effect on bank lending, such as bank runs. To this extent, credit problems\ntriggered by any kind of shocks - fundamentally contribute to explaining cyclical\nfluctuations; monetary policy is ultimately only one possible variant for producing supply\nrestrictions.ls Conversely, the credit channel at the same time provides a new interpretation\n13 This selective effect ofmonetary policy on sma11 and large enterprises was discussed by Galbraith (1957),\nintegrating imperfect financial markets in macroeconomic models. see Schlick (1994).\n15 \"At all events, taking account of imperfect information ... offers a promising new possibility of designing \n\nexplanations for the links between monetary and rea1 variables. Information problems are no doubt more than \n\nonly insignificant disturbing factors in rea1ising Walrasian equilibria.\" (Clemenz, 1987, p. 247). Tighter credit \n\n.restrictions owing 10 asymmetrie information also serve to explain financial crises such as the Great \n\n\nof the Keynesian liquidity trap. Expansionary monetary policy measures do not lead to an\nincrease in output if other factors effectively impede lending and the banks frustrate\nmonetary policy through sluggish interest rate adjustments (see Gischer, 1988, p. 136).\nThe question of what responsibility monetary policy is assigned for business activity is\nultimately at the centre ofthe economic policy implications of the credit channel approach.\nOn the one hand, the ability to influence the economic situation tends to become greater as\na result of the additional supply effect. This may lead to the call to handle a restrictive\npolicy more cautiously so as to moderate the downswing. Conversely, the opportunities of\nstimulating business activity improve.16 On the other hand, the transmission channel\nbecomes more complicated and less calcu1able owing to the interaction of information\nasymmetries and institutional conditions, with the resu1t that it may seem expedient to\nrefrain from fine-tuning measures. To this extent, the credit channe1 also provides a\nsubstantiation for a steadying monetary po1icy (see Neuberger, 1994, p. 31; Neumann,\nDepression (Bernanke, 1983) or the \"credit crunch\" during the 1990-1 recession in the United States\n6 Even in the credit channel literature itself, however, there is disagreement about whether the credit\nchannel may generate additional positive effects in aperiod of expansionary monetary stimuli (see\n17 On the basis of a Keynes-oriented approach, a rejection of active anti-inflation policies can thus be\nderived. Illing (1992, pp. 195-198) speaks in this context of a theoretical foundation of regulatory policy by\nnew Keynesian macroeconomics.\n4. Empirieal foundation of the eredit ehannel\n4.1. Approaches to solving the identiftcation problem\nOn account ofthe phenomenon ofinfonnation asymmetries, the extension ofthe traditional\ntransmission mechanism to include the credit channel appears to be meaningful. However,\nthe theoretical framework needs to be supplemented by an empirical foundation: firstly, in\norder to substantiate the credit channel hypothesis and, secondly, to be able to assess the\nmacroeconomic significance of this new variant. Most ofthe studies which are to be found\nin the literature deal with the extent to which the credit c~el can be verified empirically.\nThe central problem is to identify whether the movement of credit can be explained by the\ndemand side or by the supply side. The fact that there are now a great number of\napproaches using the most varied methods and data sources shows how difficult it is to\ntackle this identification problem. Owing to the lack of knowledge about supply-side credit\nrestrietions gained through surveys, recourse must be bad to indirect investigations based\non evaluating statistics. In the first place, banking and corporate statistics are used; some\nstudies also seek to obtain information on the credit channel on the basis of interest rate\ndata. The following sections give abrief overview of the individual variants using\nexclusively US literature. Attempts have also been made to demonstrate the existence of\nthe credit channel empirically for some other countries.18 Studies on the credit channel in\nGermany are then discussed in the subsequent section.\nAn example frequently cited to demonstrate the existence of the credit channel is the study\nby BemankeIBlinder (1992). Using a VAR approach, they examined the behaviour of bank\naggregates and overall economic variables in the wake of a restrictive monetary policy.\nThey showed that in the United States bank loans declined perceptibly with a time lag of\napproximately three quarters. At the same time, a rise in unemployment was found. As\ndeposits and securities holdings started to rise again - after a decrease in the first nine\nmonths, they interpreted these observations as evidence of the operation of the credit\nchannel. \"The fact that the timing ofthe responses of loans and unemployment to monetary\npolicy innovations are so similar is circumstantial evidence that this channel is operative\nThe conclusion by BernankelBlinder has met with severe criticism in the literature,\nhowever.19 After all, the response of bank loans might just as weIl have been triggered by\nthe traditional interest rate channel. Rising interest rates imply lower asset fonnation and\nthus lower demand for credit - albeit with a certain time lag. In order to be able to\ndistinguish between supply-side and demand-side reactions, a number of studies consider\nother fonns of credit in addition to bank loans - as a measure of the effective demand for\nfunds. If there are disturbances on the supply side, bank loans are likely to decrease relative\nto other borrowed funds.20 On the other hand, the fact that all fonns of credit decrease in\nthe wake ofa restrictive monetary policy, Le. that their proportions remain constant, argues\nfor the existence of the interest rate channeL This idea was taken up by\nKashyap/SteinIWilcox (1993) who monitored the movement of commercial paper in\naddition to that of bank loans. They showed that a restrictive monetary policy is associated\nwith a decline in bank loans and a concurrent increase in commercial paper. This suggests\nthat the corporate sector has a demand for credit which is not satisfied by the banks on\naccount of supply restrictions.\nOne objection to the studies outlined so far is that they are based on aggregated data.\nKashyap/SteinIWilcox (1996) extended their study of 1993 by means of a disaggregated\nanalysis at the corporate level so as to be able to make more differentiated statements.21\nFor small finns the ratio of bank loans to trade credits declined, whereas trade receivables\nincreased in the case of large finns. The increase in commercial paper that was\nsimultaneously observed ultimately served to finance the loans to small finns. The credit\nrestrictions imposed by the banks were at least partly offset by means of credit operations\nbetween enterprises. In addition, Kashyap/Stein (1995) conducted similar investigations for\nsmall and large banks. The reason for this is that large banks, in particular, do not\nnecessarily have to respond to a restriciive monetary policy by lowering their credit supply\nas they have alternative options and the net wealth of small banks decreases more sharply\nthan that of large banks - as in the balance sheet channel scenario (see section 3.2). The\nauthors confinn these hypotheses and show that the lending behaviour of banks differs\naccording to their size.\n19 Even the co-author Bernanke has meanwhile dissociated himself from the \"circumstantial evidence\" (see\n20 In most theoretical credit channel approaches, only bank loans and securitised debt are regardedas\nexternal fmancing. The corporate balance sheets show other forms of credit as weH, however. These are\npredominantly intercompany loans such as trade credits. If the supply of bank loans is restricted, finns may\ntry to resort to such \"substitutes\". For the information-theoretical preconditions of such responses, see\n21 That study resulted from a criticism ofthe aggregated analysis by OlinerlRudebusch (1995, 1996b).\n\n~-----_.~ \nMost empirical studies on the credit channel use corporate data and examine the extent to\nwhich asset formation and stockbuilding are influenced by \"financial variables\". The\nstarting point ofthis research was the study by FazzariJHubbardIPetersen (1988) who tested\nthe significance ofthe cash flow for asset formation for various groups ofenterprises using\npanel data (combined cross-sectional and longitudinal-sectional data). Subsequently, a\ngreat number ofsimilar studies were carried out.22 They ultimately came to the conclusion\nthat the elasticity of the liquidity parameter is distinctly higher and more significant for\nsmall enterprises than for large firms. Besides the estimation ofan explicit asset fonnation\nfunction, there are also some studies, for example HubbardlKashyap (1992) and Whited\n(1992), which use the Euler equation to test whether investment behaviour depends on\nfinancial restrictions. This was triggered by a dispute about the extent to which the\nsignificance of liquidity variables actually reflects financing constraints. This can be\navoided by testing the first-order condition derived from the \"dynamic\" optimisation\ncalculatioIl, i.e. the Euler equation. The advantage of this method is that no complete asset\nfonnation functions have to be specified.23\nBesides this core ofcorporate studies, further approaches are found in the literature which\ndemonstrate the relevance of the financing structure and, moreover, establish a direct link\nwith monetary policy measures. Gertler/Gilchrist (1994), for example, investigated\nstockbuilding via a simple descriptive-statistical means, using a VAR model and finally by\nestimating a function for stockbuilding.24 As a result ofall three approaches it is found that\nthe stocks of small enterprises decrease considerably more shaIply than those of large\nenterprises in the wake of a restrictive monetary policy. The different reaction of bank\nloans is identified as a cause. Parallel to the deterioration in the financial position, the trend\nin bank loans is much more restrained for smaII firms than for large ones. This result is\ninterpreted as indicating that smaIl enterprises are hit harder than large ones by a tightening\nof the monetary policy stance through credit supply restrictions and that therefore their\nstock levels respond more strongly as weH.\nAs an alternative to the studies of the movements of different fonns of credit, one may\nattempt to test for the credit channel by means ofthe trend in the cost ofcredit. In the case\nof credit supply restrictions, it is likely as a rule that lending rates will rise more sharply\n22 Other stodies, for example Sharpe (1994), examined the dependence ofthe level of employment on finns' \n\nfinancing structure. \n\n23 For a comprehensive comparison of the two approaches, see Cbirinko (1993).

The idea is\nsimple, but its empirical implementation is difficult. Statistics on bank lending rates are\nrelatively poor and, in addition, other tenns are stipulated in loan agreements besides\ninterest rates, such as the amount of collateral and the possibilities of influencing business\nactivity. \"The problem is that the true 'price' of a bank loan is multidimensional, involving\nnot only the contractual interest rate but a variety of other tenns and conditions ...\"\n(Bemanke, 1993, p. 58). Hence, interest rates may move in line with market mtes, whereas\nother variables, which can hardly be monitored, are adjusted. This may mean that the \"true\"\ninterest mte rises much more sharply. Various reasons are mentioned in the literature to\nexplain why lending mtes may actually respond more slowly than the market rate.26 For\nexample, in periods of a restrictive monetary policy banks mise their interest mtes less than\nexpected in order not to increase the insolvency risk of their customers; in expansionary\nperiods, by contrast, the scope for cutting rates is not fully utilised by way ofcompensation.\nIn their multi-country study CottarellilKourelis (1994) showed that the fluctuation of\ninterest rates depends on a great number of institutional factors and is not always\nattributable to the market failure of infonnation asymmetries. Owing to the difficulties\ndescribed, most other authors express the opinion that hardly any conclusions on the credit\nchannel can be derived from published interest rate data (see Davis, 1995, p. 58).\nEven if a number of studies suggest that the credit channel exists, this says Httle about its\nmacroeconomic significance. Even for the United States there have been few investigations\ninto this question and, moreover, they arrive at divergent results. McCallum (1991) found\nfor the period 1950-85 that about half of the change in gross domestic product (GDP)\ncaused by the restrictive monetary policy was attributable to credit rationing. By contrast,\nthe relevance of the financial sphere for macroeconomic variables was considered to be\nrather small by BergerlUdell (1992) and Fuerst (1995). The fonner used microdata, namely\njust over 1 million credit agreements, for assessing credit rationing. They showed that,\nwhile there are supply restrictions on the part of the lenders, one cannot speak of a\nmacroeconomically significant phenomenon. Finally, Fuerst integrated money market and\nfinancial market imperfections into a real business cyc1e model. However, theresulting\nfluctuations hardly differed from the results obtained with perfect markets.\nEven if a number of studies show positive results for the existence ofthe credit channel for\nthe United States, it would be premature to simply transfer such studies to other countries.\nIt is precisely the institutional differences, such as the relationship between banks and\n25 In this context market rates are understood to mean money market and capital market rates.\nenterprises, which may weil influence the \"operation\" ofthe credit channel. An infonnative\nexample of the relevance of national peculiarities IS the study by\nHoshi/Kashyap/Scharfstein (1991) for Japan. Finns which are organised in industrial\nassociations (\"Keiretsu\") traditionally have very close relationships with their house bank.\nIt is found that such enterprises are less affected by credit restrictions than enterprises\noutside the \"Keiretsu\".\n4.2. Credit channel in Germany?\nIn contrast to the United States, there are only a few studies for Gennany which investigate\nthe relevance of the financing structure of enterprises and credit supply restrictions by\nbanks. Both FrisseIFunkelLankes (1993) and Winker (1996) stated that financial variables\nplay an important role for corporate asset fonnation. Whereas the fonner used data oflisted\npublic limited companies from the industrial and\u00b7distribution sectors and carried out a\npanel study similar to FazzarilHubbardIPetersen (1988),27 a large number of approaches\nare found in Winker. What is interesting is the attempt to demonstrate credit rationing\ndirectly, i.e. by means of survey data on obstacles 10 innovation from the ifo innovation,\ninvestment and business surveys. It is difficult to assess, however, how reliable enterprises'\nanswers concerning restrictions by banks are. In addition to the microeconomic\nconfinnation of credit rationing, Winker tries to assess also the macroeconomic effects of\nthis phenomenon. For this purpose, the aggregated credit supply and credit demand\nfunctions were estimated in a first step and it was shown that a positive excess demand of\nroughly 10 % of the credit volume existed in 1985. This bad similar effects on\nmacroeconomic asset fonnation. As a result of credit not granted, asset fonnation was\nabout one-tenth lower than it would have been in the absence of rationing. It is to be\ncritically notOO that a positive excess demand was found for 1985 but not for 1981.\nAccording to Winker, the market cleared in 1981, despite very high central bank interest\nrates and the recession. Theoretical considerations would suggest the emergence of credit\nsupply problems, particularly during such a phase.\nAttempts were made to produce further evidence for the relevance ofthe financial sphere in\nGermany by evaluating the Bonn sampie, which is basOO on the annual accounts of public\nlimitOO companies from the industrial sector. EIs10nlAlbach (1994) discussOO the\ninvestment behaviour of firms which are designated as \"bank-dependent\" since banks were\nalso shareholders in them. The so-called independent enterprises were then comparOO with\nthis control group. For the period 1983-92 the authors demonstrated that liquidity variables\ninfluenced the investment behaviour of independent firms, whereas enterprises with elose\n27 For the link between the labour demand function and the financing structule for Gennany, see\nties to their banks showed no financing restrictions. These results indicate that the structure\nof the Gennan banking system is an aspect that should not be neglected. This was already\nestimates show that ... there is a significant, positive relationship between the degree of\nbank involvement in leading industrial companies and their financial perfonnance.\" In a\nfurther study AudretschlElston (1994) classified enterprises by size categories (small,\nmedium-sized, large). However, the results can hardly be used as evidence for the common\nhypothesis that small finns are most affected by credit rationing, for in the estimation\nperiod 1977-85 the liquidity parameter was highly significant and showed the highest\nvalue, particularly for the large public limited companies.\nNeuberger (1994) tried, on the basis of credit and interest rate data, to analyse supply-side\ncredit disturbances. She investigated the extent to which the trend in lending or lending\nrates can be explained by corporate insolvencies. Ultimately, no indication of a credit\ndisturbance on the supply side, i.e. by banks, was found.\nThe studies quoted so far exarnined the significance ofthe financing structure from various\nangles. However, none of the studies locates this aspect directly in the monetary policy\ncontext, as is the case with foreign studies. An exception is the investigation by Tsatsaronis\n(1995) who tested the existence of the credit channel in periods of a restrictive monetary\npolicy for the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Gennany. By means of\naggregated data and using different statistical methods, he concluded from the reactions of\noutput, the money stock and the credit volume that there are hardly any indications of the\nexistence of the credit channel for Gennany. \"... monetary policy in Gennany seems to\nwork mainly through the conventional 'money' channeI.\" (Tsatsaronis, 1995, p. 167).\nOwing to the different findings in the individual studies, the operation of a credit channel\nfor Gennany, in addition to the traditional interest rate channel, cannot be established\nunambiguously. Particularly studies based on corporate data show no direct link with\nmonetary policy measures and can therefore give only initial indications of the\nphenomenen in question. In addition, owing to their limitation to listed public lirnited\ncompanies, the databases are not a representative yardstick for Gennany. By contrast, as\ndescribed at the beginning of the paper, the Deutsche Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet\nstatistics offer the advantage that they include small and medium-sized finns as wen as\nunincorporated enterprises. For according to the theoretical predictions, the credit channel\nis likely to affect precisely these finns. In the course of the present study the corporate\nbalance sheet statistics will be evaluated with respect to this question for periods of\nrestricted monetary stimuli. First, however, the methodology and the database are\ndescribed.\n5. Credit ehannel in the Bgbt oftbe eorporate balance sbeet statisties\n5.1. Database and methodology\nThe Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics are based on the annual accounts\nsubmitted in the context of rediscount business. The annual accounts are the basis of the\nstatutorily prescribed examination of the creditworthiness of parties to bills of exchange.\nAccording to section 19 of the Bundesbank Ac!, the Bundesbank is required to purchase\nonly bills ubacked by parties known to be solventu. As a result, comprehensive source\nmaterial in the form of profit and loss accounts and balance sheets is available only for\neconomic sectors in which the trade bill is an important financing instrument. These sectors\nprimarily include the manufacturing and construction sectors as weH as the wholesale and\nretail trade. In the present study only the data for the manufacturing sector are used,\nhowever, since the database for this sector is the most comprehensive in the context of the\nBundesbank statistics an~ at the same time, statements can be made on the most\nsignificant and cyclically susceptible economic sector in Germany.18\nSince the literature on the credit channel deals primarily with restrictive monetary policy\nperiods, this study is likewise confined to such periods. Accordingly, two cylindered\nto the Bundesbank; this means that the firms included in each sampie submitted annual\naccounts to the Bundesbank for every year of the review period. In the first period the\nchosen because clear monetary policy phases or monetary stimuli can be identified.19 This\nassessment was based on the trend in central bank interest rates and on the statements made\nin the Bundesbank's Annual Reports on the orientation of monetary policy. This procedure\nfoHows the narrative approach of RomerlRomer (1989) and the approach taken by\nBernankeIBlinder (1992) which used the Federal funds rate as a yardstick for monetary\npolicy for the United States. Even if particularly the RomerlRomer approach to\ndetermining the stance of monetary policy has numerous shortcomings, such as a certain\ninaccuracy in assessing the start ofmonetary stimuli, both procedures are frequently used in\n18 In 1988. wbich is to serve as a reference year for the comparison of the Bundesbank sample with the\noverall survey (see footnote 37). for example. two--fifths oftotal turnover. one-third of gross value added and\naImost one-third ofall persons employed in Germany were accounted for by the manufacturing sector. (In the\npresent study reference is made only to the data for western Germany.)\n29 According to Duwendag et al. (1993, p.228), monetary stimuli are defined as changes in monetary\nvariables, such as the money stock and various types of interest rates.\nthe literature.30 Moreover, it is not important in this context to split monetary policy phases\nprecisely into very short intervals (months or quarters) because only annual data are\navailable from the corporate balance sheet statistics.31\nApart from the lowering of the lombard rate in autumn 1980, a restrictive monetary policy\ncentral bank: interest rates declined; this means that there was a renewed reversal in\nmonetary policy. Nevertheless, both years are included in the analysis because, owing to\ncertain lag structures, the effects of the credit channel on real variables may still be found\nrelatively late.33 In 1978 central bank: interest rates remained unchanged overall; in\naddition, a certain nonnalisation of economic activity was recorded. For that reason, that\nyear will be used as a reference point for the discussion of certain finn-specific stylised\nfacts. The year 1988 is to be interpreted in a similar way even though central bank: interest\nrates were raised in the second halfofthe year owing to emerging inflationary risks. Owing\nto the time lags already mentioned, the influences on the finns' annual data are hardly\nnoticeable, with the result that the real period under review does not start until 1989.\n30 For an overview ofthe various approaches to classifying monetary policy, see BernankelMihov (1995). \n\n31 In the United States, by contrast, quarterly corporate balance sheets are available. \n\n32 An analogous delimitation for Germany is obtained if the difference between long and short-term interest \n\nrates is taken as a basis. \n\n\nQuarterly averages\n%.-----~~--_r------------r_----------~------~\u00c4777q_----~\nPeriods of economic slowdown\n12~------~--~RM-------------+-------------~-r~~~--~~~--~------~\nIO~--------~~~--~-----------------r-----------------;------------~----+-------~\nLombard rare'\n.. 1----....\n2~----------------~-----------\n....,\n%\nH\n..\n%\nt2~------------~------------~~------------~----------~----~----,\n1 Discount and lombard rates; end of <)uartet levels; berween Fdmlaty 20. 1981 and May 6, 1982 the Bundesbank granted special\nlombard loans at specially fixed rates, If necessary, instead of lombard loans.- 2 Rate for open marker operations in securities re\npurehase transactions (from 1984).-\" Less than DM 1 million.- 4 Until May 1986 at ~eed maturities of three months, amounts of\nless than DM J million; !rom June 1986 with agreed maturities of one up to and includlOg three months, amounts of DM 100,000 to\nless than DM I million.- 5 At three months' notice.- 6 On residential real estate, effective interest rates; until May 1982, average\ncomputation from interest rate agreements of all types, with variable interest rate agreements predominating; from June 1982 mon\ngage loans exclusively at fixed rates for tcn yeus; to this enent the compatability of the data is limited.\nThe corporate data available on the manufacturing sector are broken down by size category\nand legal form. These are group data and not microdata, i.e. there is only an average figure\nfor each size category and balance sheet item.34 The size (which - according to the credit\nchannel theory - is decisive for the creditworthiness and the bank dependence of the\nenterprises) is c1assified by turnover.35 Such adefinition is not unproblematical, however,\nsince there are overlaps with other corporate features which may distort the results. But\nsuch overlaps cannot be avoided either in other c1assification characteristics used in the\nliterature, such as the age of the firm, access to the capital market, or the amount of\ndividend distributions.36 Owing to the different accounting regulations and the liability of\nthe private assets of sole proprietors and partnerships (which relativises the exc1usive use\nof the level of the own funds ratio as a gauge of!iable assets), a distinction is also made by\nlegal form. In this context, it has to be borne in mind that, in terms of numbers, firms of\ndependent legal status dominate the corporate landscape in Germany and also predominate\nin the Bundesbank sampie; these firms may behave differently from incorporated\nenterprises. Hitherto, studies ofGermany, and sometimes ofother countries, have had to be\nconfined to the large incorporated enterprises because data for other firms were not\navailable.\nT0 assess the degree of representativeness of the data, it was necessary to compare the\nBundesbank sampie with statistics which reflect the universe. The Bundesbank database\nfor 198837 comprises 3 % of the enterprises shown in the turnover tax statistics for the\nmanufacturing sector; however, almost half of the tumover was accounted for by the firms\nin the Bundesbank sampie. This suggests that 1arge enterprises predominate. It has to be\nborne in mind, however, that the turnover tax statistics inc1ude numerous entities which are\nenterprises not obliged to draw up'a balance sheet. The units covered by the corporate\nbalance sheet statistics account for just over one-fifth of industrial firm loans recorded in\nthe banking statistics. The ratio of short-term to long-term bank loans is 72 %, compared\nwith 67 % in the banking statistics. Considerable differences are found in the size category\n34 Hence, it is implicitly assumed that a11 enterprises behave like the average within a given group. \n\n35 A distinction is made between the size categories \"small\" (turnover of up to DM 5 million), \"medium\n\nsized\" (tumover of DM 5 to 50 million) and \"Iarge\" (tumover of over DM 50 million). Altematively, some \n\nauthors use the balance sheet total as a criterion. \n\n36 For an overview of the various classification characteristics, see Bernankel Gertler/Gilchrist (1994). \n\nPossible errors ofexogenously specified characteristics are reduced if discriminant variables from the original \n\ndata are ascertained endogenously with the aid ofcluster and discriminant analyses. \n\n37 Solely the year 1988 was used as a reference since the tumover tax statistics for 1978 are not directly \n\ncomparable because of the modification of the industrial classification system in 1980. The two cylindered \n\nsampies ofthe Bundesbank sample were formed according to the classification valid as from 1980, \n\nstructure. According to the tumover tax statistics, just over 90 % of the tax payers have a\ntumover of less than DM 5 million; they have a share of just over 10 % in the\nmanufacturing sector's total tumover. According to the Bundesbank data, only one-fifth of\nthe enterprises. accounting for less than I % ofthe tumover. come into this category. In the\nBundesbank sampIe the large firms with a tumover of over DM 50 million account for\n23 % of the enterprises and almost 87 % of the tumover, while in the universe of the\ntumover tax statistics just over I % of the firms of this size generate 71 % of the tumover.\nBroken down by legal form, enterprises of dependent legal status come to 83 % and\ngenerate just over one-third of the tumover, according to the official statistics; in the\nBundesbank's data these make up nearly 50 % of the firms and account for 23 % of the\ntumover. These brief statements show that the sampie used here, as measured by the\nturnover tax statistics and the banking statistics, is of considerable size and reflects the\nrange of enterprises better than comparable databases but that it also has a certain bias in\nfavour of larger firms. The extent to which the findings for the credit channel are\ninfluenced by this will be discussed in the last part of this study.\nAs section 4 shows, there are in principle three methodological approaches to evaluating\ncorporate data for information on the credit channel. The VAR approach or other\ntime-series-based methods cannot be applied to the Bundesbank data since the number of\nobservations is too small. In the United States this is possible because both relatively long\ndata series and quarterly data are available. Consequently, the best approach would be to\nestimate an asset formation function by means of panel data. If the liquidity constraint is\nfound to be significant, this is regarded in the literature on the credit channel as proofofits\nexistence.38 Although this is undisputed in theory, the empirical implementation is\nproblematic, which is only partly attributable to the general difficulties in the statistical\nrecording ofinvestment behaviour. In particular, it is not clear what a Iiquidity variable, for\nexample the cash flow, represents exactly. On the one hand, it represents the internally\ngenerated financial resources and, on the other, it is relatively closely correlated with the\nprofit situation or tumover. This means that no unambiguous conclusion as to pure\nfmancing problems can be drawn from a significant influence of the liquidity variables and\nthat, from this angle, the great number of studies with corresponding results are to be\ninterpreted with caution. A way out of this dilemma is the estimation of the Euler\nequation - the first-order condition; however, this variant has some disadvantages, too. The\n38 In the case ofa perfect capitaJ market. by contrast, there can be no liquidity constraints for a finn since the\nsupply offinancial resources at the prevailing interest rate is completely elastic.\nresults react very sensitively to the model specification and to the size of the sampies;\nmoreover, the violation of the first-order condition need not necessarily be caused by\nfinancial constraints.39\nOwing to the aforementioned \"technical\" problems and the fact that group data were used,\na simple descriptive-statistical approach has been chosen in the present study along the\nlines of Gertler/Gilchrist (1994). An attempt is made to solve the identification problem of\nwhether bank loans show supply disturbances by considering the reactions ofbank loans in\nindividual size categories. A below-average trend in the case of small and medium-sized\nenterprises (SMEs) vis-a-vis large finns might indicate the existence ofthe credit channel.\nThis - it is commonly argued - is the cause of the strong decline in fixed asset fonnation\nand stockbuilding of SMEs observed in the wake of a restrictive monetary policy. In\naddition to bank loans, all other fonns ofcredit shown in the Bundesbank's source material\nare investigated, particularly supplier's credit and loans arising from participating interests\n(inc1uding proprietors' and partners' loans) to identify the actua1 demand for credit or the\ncredit channe1.40 Whereas the inc1usion of trade credits as an \"auxiliary variable\" is quite\nwidespread in the literature, the explicit analysis of loans between affiliated enterprises or\nproprietors' and partners' loans has not yet been documented. The reaction ofbank loans in\nrelation to other liabilities is likely to be infonnative, too. If their proportion declines, this\nargues for the credit channel, according to Kashyap/SteinIWilcox (1993, 1996). Apart from\nanalysing the trend in credit, the study examined whether the trend in lending rates paid by\nenterprises (as far as they can be computed on the basis ofthe balance sheet data) supplies\nfurther infonnation. Appropriate conc1usions could be drawn if the interest level paid by\nsmall finns always developed differently from that paid by large enterprises. To this extent\nthis study attempts to evaluate the available source material as comprehensively as possible\nfor the detection ofthe credit channeL\n39 The various problems involved in estimating the asset formation function and the Euler equation were \n\n\n40 Bernanke (1993, p. 59) explicitly demanded that fonns ofcredit other than bank loans should be included \n\nin the analysis. \n\nS.2.1. Economic situation\nAccording to the relevant literature, the cred.it channel serves to explain an economic\ndownswing as a result of a tighter monetary policy. To this extent, it appears to be sensible\nto analyse overall economic developments before empiricaIly testing for the credit channel\nso as to locate the reactions of the individual relevant firm data within the cyclicaI and\nAfter the recession had been overcome at the end of 1975, the Gennan economy grew\nIn the producing sector output increased by as much as 5 % in 1979. At that time, the\nunemployment rate came to roughly 3 1/2 % ofthe labour force. Whereas at the beginning\nof the period under review consumer prices moved within an acceptable range, they rose\nsharply, at 4 %, in 1979 in the wake of the second oil price wave; in conjunction with a\nsharp expansion of the money stock, this led to several increases in the discount and\nlombard rates (to 6 % and 7 %, respectively). In 1980 consumer prices went up by 5 ~ %\nand the index ofimport prices rose by as much as 15 %. The dramatic increase in the prices\nof petroleum and the global economic adjustment processes caused industrial output to\nstagnate and real GDP to grow by only about I %. In the first half of 1980 central bank\ninterest rates reached a level of7 ~ % and 9 Y2 %, respectively. In the two subsequent years\nthe economic downswing accelerated; in 1982 total and industrial output declined by as\nmuch as I % and just over 3 %, respectively. The unemployment rate reached almost 7 %.\nThe curbing of inflation, associated with improved externaI conditions, made it possible,\nhowever, to lower centraI bank interest rates throughout the year. In May 1982 the special\nlombard rate, which bad amounted to 12 % upon its introduction at the beginning of 1981\nand which bad already been lowered from the autumn of 1981, was replaced by the\nstandard lombard; the latter bad been reduced to 6 % by the end of the year, which\ncorresponded to the level of mid-1979. In 1983 economic output rose again for the first\ntime in three years (+ I Y2 %), and price inceases bad moderated noticeably, at 3 Y2 %.\nThis shows that the overall economic environment in 1978-82 corresponded to the\nconditions for the \"operation\" of the credit channel described in the literature. Before\ninvestigating the credit channel, some firm-specific characteristics that are relevant in\nterms ofthe new transmission approach will be anaIysed in greater detail.\n41 A flrst impression is given by figure 3.\nIncorported enterprises (lNCs) and sole proprietorshipsl\npartnerships (SPslPs); selected balance sheet ratlos in 19781 Table 1\nTurnover\nTurnover Turnover\nDM 5 million to\n-------4~~~~------~\nOwnfunds\nShort-term creditors\nBank loans\nSupplier's credir\nPayments received\non account\nOther'\nLong-term creditors\nBank loans\nCreditors from\nparticipating interests\nOther\n1 % ofbalance sheet total.- 2 Including supplier's credit from affiliated enterprises.\nshort-term creditors from interests.\nIn the first year of the period, 1978, it can be noted, on the liability side of the balance\nsheets ofincOlporated entetprises (INCs), that the own funds ratios rose distinctly with the\nsize ofthe finns (see table 1.) This suggests a 10wer creditworthiness of small entetprises,\nin particular, which finns in turn - as a mirror image, so to speak - showed by far the\ngreatest bank dependence; both are aspects on which the credit channel approach is\npremised. Whereas their bank loans amounted to 26 % of the balance sheet total, the figure\nwas only 12 % in the case of finns with a tumover of over DM 50 million. In the case of\nSMEs the ratio of long-tenn to short-tenn bank debt amounted to almost 110 %, whereas\nlarge entetprises, at roughly 200 %, were clearly oriented to the longer tenn. Besides bank\nloans, trade credits playamajor role. Including the relevant debtors on the asset side, all\nsize categories of the manufacturing sector considered here were net creditors with regard\n\nto supplier's credit; this was increasingly the case with rising turnover which, on balance,\nindicates the possibility of lending by large farms to small enterprises.42\nThe database for 1978-82 included just over twice as many SPsIPs as INCs (see table 2).\nThe latter were much larger, however. They accounted for about three-quarters of total\nturnover, tangible fixed assets and stocks. The database was dominated by the large INCs;\n8 % of the enterprises generated 70 % of turnover. The smaU SPslPs, which accounted for\none-quarter ofall farms, carried only very Iittle weight economically. They achieved a share\nin the turnover of aU enterprises of 1 Y2 %, and their share in bank loans amounted to not\nquite 3 %.\nNumber Tumover\nTangible\nLegal forms. total\nup to DM 5 million\nINes. total\nup to DM 5 million\n~----------------\nSPsIPs. total\nup to DM 5 million\n------\n--------\n------\n------\n1 % oflegal forms, total.\nThe essential difference between INCs and SPsIPs in 1978 is the level ofown funds. In the\ncase ofSPsIPs the relevant ratio averaged only about 20 %, according to table 1, and hardly\nvaried between the individual size categories.43 At the same time, their dependence on\nbanks was much greater; in the case of small firms it came to 32 % of the balance sheet\ntotal, and in the case of large firms to a still considerable 17 Y2 %. Trade credits displayed a\nsize-dependent pattern, though again all categories were net creditors. Long-term Iiabilities\narising from participating interests, which in some cases exceeded long-term bank loans,\n42 According to the corporate balance sheet statistics, the retail trade was a net debtor in respect of supplier's \n\ncredit. This means that the manufacturing sector possibly granted loans to the retail trade. \n\n43 The own funds ratios of SPslPs are statistically understated, however, since - apart from limited \n\npartnerships - private assets are also part of the liable assets. \n\nreached quite a considerable level.44 In view of their ratio of long-term to short-term bank\nloans of just over 130 %, the SPs/Ps among the SMEs seemed to have a longer-term\norientation than the small and medium-sized INCs; the opposite seemed to be true for the\nlarge SPs/Ps, at a value of 120 %.\nWith regard to the credit channel, the stylised facts described above suggest that small\nfirms tend to be affected to a greater degree by monetary policy. Firstly, their bank\ndependence is greater and, secondly, their creditworthiness - at least in the case oflNCs - is\nlikely to be lower than that of large enterprises. At first sight, this reaffirms the theoretical\nassumptions. The following sections will examine whether this hypothesis can in fact be\nmaintained for the subsequent years when monetary policy makers adopted a tighter stance.\nThe clear differences in the case of own funds and bank loans seem to justify the separate\ntreatment by legal forms. In addition, special attention will be paid to the other forms of\ncredit, some ofwhich reach considerable orders ofmagnitude.\n5.2.3. Incorporated enterprises and the credit channel\nAs mentioned, the credit channel approach is based on the pronounced bank dependence\nand the lower creditworthiness of small enterprises compared with large ones. A restrictive\nmonetary policy may cause a restriction of the credit supply which affects the size\ncategories to varying degrees and which has a greater impact on small firms, in particular.\nThe pattern of bank dependence was outlined in the preceding section, but only the own\nfunds ratio in 1978 provided some information on creditworthiness. Since, however, the\nbalance sheet channel theory focuses on the influence on goodwill and creditwortbiness\nover time, this factor will first be examined on the basis ofvarious ratios. Subsequently the\nbehaviour of enterprises will be investigated. The study will examine whether size-specific\npatterns can be observed in fixed asset formation andlor stockbuilding, as in the United\nStates. If tbis is confirmed, it will be clarified to what extent \"credit problems\" can be held\nresponsible for this.\nEnterprises' creditworthiness will be characterised by the usual variables own funds ratio,\nprofit for the year and cash flow45 as weIl as by the coverage ratio - the ratio of interest\n44 Trus is due, inter alia, to the fact that, for liability and tax reasons, withdrawals by limited liability\npartners are often made available again to their firms in the form ofloans.\n45 In the context of the Deutsche Bundesbank's credit assessments (1992a), the own funds ratio (own\nfundslbalance sheet total), the capital recovery rate (cash flow/capital input) and the profit-turnover ratio\n(profit for the year/tumover or total output) proved to be the most informative indicators. In the present study\npaid to the profit for the year (including interest paid). This ratio, which represents nothing\nelse than an interest coverage ratio,46 is designated in US literature as a variable that is\nsimple to compute and one by which the financial position of a firm can be adequately\ndescribed byapproximation47.\nIrrespective of which ratio is used, there is a graduation specific to the size category. In no\ngroup is the trend in the data so unfavourable as in the case offirms with a tumover of less\nthan DM 5 million (see table 3). This actually resulted in a loss in 1982, although two years\nearlier - at the beginning of the recession - the profit-tumover ratio had amounted to just\nthe downswing starting in 1980 had little effect on the corporate balance sheets of INCs;\nfrom 1981 the ratios of SMEs especially were a sustained reflection of economic\ndevelopments. By contrast, nearly all indicators improved in the case of firms with a\ntumover of over DM 50 million as early as 1982. The creditworthiness of the individual\nsize categories thus developed as expected. The smaller the enterprises, the worse their\ntotal output is used as a reference variable for the profit for the year and the cash flow. (Total output includes\nthe change in stocks ofown products and other intemally produced real assets as weIl as tumover.)\n46 The higher the coverage ratio, the worse is the assessment ofthe fum's fmancial position.\n47 Gertler/Gilchrist (1994, p. 334) substantiated the use of this variable as follows: \"We refrain from using\nindicators that measure assets directly because we have infonnation only on book values. However, the\ncoverage ratio is highly correlated with the other prominent balance sheet indicators. It is thus reasonable to\nview variation in the coverage ratio as proxying for movements in fums' overall ftnancial positions.\"\nUp to DM 5 million\n1 % ofbalance sheet total.- 2 Interest paid as % ofprofit for the year (including interest paid).\n3 % oftotal output.- 4 Change in percentage points.\nTo show the reactions of firms to a restrictive monetary policy stance, most authors resort\nto fixed asset formation and stockbuilding. In contrast to what is claimed for the United\nStates by Gertler/Gilchrist (1994), for example, the database used here does not provide\nany evidence that the stockbuilding of small enterprises declines more sharply than that of\nlarge firms in periods oftighter monetary stimuli. According to table 4, a general decline in\nstockbuilding was recorded between 1979 and 1981; in the last year under review here\nstocks were actually run down at a rate that was in fact somewhat more pronounced for\nmedium-sized and large firms than for small enterprises. However, the size-specific\nbehaviour described in the credit channel literature can be confirmed for tangible fixed\nassets (see table 4). Whereas in 1980 the stock of tangible fixed assets was increased fairly\nsharply in all size categories, this was only the case in the subsequent years in enterprises\nwith a turnover of over DM 50 million. Their investment ratio was largely stable over the\nyears, despite very high interest rates and despite the recession. From 1981 the net asset\nformation of SMEs slumped dramatically. The invesment ratios declined by 0.6 percentage\npoint in each case. The small enterprises in fact reduced their stock of tangible fixed assets\nrather sharply in 1982, which was ultimately also clearly reflected in the relevant balance\nsheet ratios. While in 1979 the ratio of tangible fixed assets to the balance sheet total had\nstill amounted to 33 Y2 %, it was barely 31 % three years later. This balance sheet ratio was\nmuch more stable in the case ofmedium-sized and large firms.\nIncorporated eDterprises: stockbuDdiDg aDd fixed asset formatioD Table 4\nStockbuildini\nup to DM 5 million\nFixed asset formation3\nup to DM 5 million\n1 Change in pereentage points.-l Stockbuilding as % oftotal output.- 3 Net fixed asset formation .\nNow we must assess to wbat extent the differing investment bebaviour can be explained by\ncredit restrictions - as evidence for the cred.it cbanneL A comparison of the growth rates in\nbank loans shows that up to and including 1980 - Le. two years after the tightening of the\nmonetary policy stance - loans increased very sharply at double-digit rates regardless of the\nsize category (see table 5).48 In the two subsequent periods the trend varied fairly sharply.\nFor the medium-sized enterprises a virtual stagnation can be found, while at firms with a\nturnover of over DM 50 million loans initially expanded at + 13 %; in 1982 they declined\nperceptibly in absolute terms, which may be due to the fact that internat resources increased\nfairly strongly again. The small enterprises displayed a completely different trend. In 1981\nbank loans grew even more strongly than in the years before and in 1982, too, a rise (albeit\na smaller one) of5 % was recorded. Since the analysis ofthe growth rates may be distorted\nowing to the sharply diverging levels of bank loans, it appears appropriate to include the\nrelevant ratios to the balance sheet total. In the case of small firms the share of loans\nonly slightly in the case of the other size categories. The trend in bank loans was associated\nwith an increase in the ratio of short-term to long-term loans throughout.

According to the\naforementioned statements, such restrictions are not evident in the Bundesbank database\nbut supplier's credits may perhaps provide additional information. The trade creditors of\nsmall firms moved differently from those of medium-sized and large firms with the\nbeginning of the recession in 1980. Whereas the trend in the latter remained positive until\n1981 and did not dec1ine in absolute terms until 1982, that ofsmall firms had fallen already\nin 1980. The granting of trade credits to small firms appears to be handled relatively\nrestrictively. On the asset side of the balance sheet trade debtors moved more or less in\npara1lel with trade creditors, with the result that, on balance, no additional financing or\nlending through trade credit can be found in any size category. To this extent, at least for\nthe manufacturing sector in Germany, there is nothing to suggest (contrary to the original\nassumption) that additional credit channels were opened through supplier's credits between\nIn the period under review no size-specific behaviour could be observed for the item other\ncreditors.51 Since the relevant claims52 showed a slightly rising trend and all categories\n49 Similar reactions were found for the United States by Meltzer (1960) and for the United Kingdom by\nBrechlinglLipsey (1963). For the different reasons why firms tend to be more willing to lend than banks, see\nJaffee/Stiglitz (1990, pp. 879-880). From the point of view of information economics it is argued that\ninformation structures between firms can weIl be more efficient than between firms and banks.\n50 This tallies with a longer-term study ofthe Deutsche Bundesbank (1992b). The result was also confirmed\nfor preceding periods (Timmermann, 1971).\n51 These include other short-term creditors, creditors arising from participating interests and other long-term\ncreditors.\n52 These are the other short and long-term debtors; the debtors arising from participating interests were not\n\nwere net debtors, net liabilities declined in general, and so there was no additional source\nof credit. On the liability side the available source material enabled a differentiation of\nlong-tenn trade creditors by other creditors and loans arising from participating interests.\nThis subdivision is of significance because it may be assumed that in the case of this fonn\nofcredit asymmetrie information flows will hardly be significant and that this type ofcredit\nis granted more willingly than bank funds. In the case of enterprises with a turnover of less\nthan DM 5 million, creditors arising from participating interests increased slightly, while\nthey remained relatively constant in the case of the other size categories. This might\nsuggest that there was an additional source of credit for small INCs.S3 This source was no\nlarger, however, than the increase in long-term bank loans, which grew much more sharply.\nIf there were a \"supply shortage\" of bank credit to small INCs, it might be expected that\nparticularly the loans between finns would grow at a relatively faster pace.\nIf, finally, the ratio ofbank loans to all other 16ans is considered, no \"takeover effect\" could\nbe found for firms with a turnover of less than DM 5 million in the sense ofother fonns of\ncredit expanding more sharply than bank loans. The ratio rose steadily in favour of bank\nloans from just under 60 % to 74 % (see table 6). In the next size category the growth was\nmuch smaller and in the case of large enterprises the ratio remained largely constant. It can\nbe concluded from this that the small enterprises can cover their additional financing\nrequirements resulting from a decrease in own funds by bank loans and that they do not\nhave to resort to alternative forms of credit. The results found here provide no indications\nfor a discrimination ofsmall firms in terms ofbank lending; the\nIncorporated enterprises: bank loans venas otber loans\u00b7 Table6\nUp to DM 5 million\n1 Bank loans as % ofother loans.

Sole proprietorships/partnerships and the credit channel\nWhereas the size-specific bank dependence of SPs/Ps was already documented in sec\ntion 5.2.2, the trend in their financial position will now be examined over time. According\nto table 7, the own funds ratio of small enterprises dropped from 19 % to 13 % between\nin the case of large enterprises. The trend in the coverage ratio was broadly similar. The\nprofit for the year and the cash flow offirms with a turnover ofless\nUp to DM 5 million\n1 % ofbalance sheet total.- 2 Interest paid as % ofprofit for the year (including interest paid).\n3 % oftotal output- 4 Change in percentage points.\nthan DM 5 million fell in every year. whereas most ratios of the large firms were even\nmore favourable in 1982 than a year before. On the basis of the ratios available, a clearly\nsize-dependent trend in the creditworthiness can be confrrmed. As for the INCs, a\nnoticeable deterioration in the creditworthiness of the SPsIPs can be found only from 1981,\nwhen central bank interest rates peaked and the cyclical downswing was in its second year.\nSince stockbuilding displays no size-specific pattern over time, fixed asset formation will\nnow be analysed in greater detail (see table 8). Here the SMEs and large firms differ\nperceptibly. Between 1979 and 1981 the SMEs showed declining but positive investment\nratios and therefore an increase in the stock oftangible fixed assets. In the subsequent year\nwhen the recession reached its low point. depreciatlon exceeded gross asset fonna-\nSole proprietorshlpslparmenblps: lnvestmeat ratio' TableS\nUp to DM 5 million\n1 Net fixed asset formation as % oftotal output.- Z Change in percen1age points.\ntion. The decline in investment ratlos was particularly pronounced for small finns. By\ncontrast, enterprises with a tumover of over DM 50 million expanded their capital stock\nover the entire period, even though the growth rates decreased. In 1982 this was\nperceptible, however, only in the stock variable (which is influenced by valuations) but not\nin the investment ratio. The share of tangible fixed assets in the balance sheet total\nincreased slightly in that year, whereas it dropped considerably in the case ofsmall finns.\nAs in the case of INCs, bank dependence, creditworthiness and fixed asset fonnation\ndisplayed the size-specific pattern typical of the credit channel. It remains to be examined\nto what extent bank lending restrictions can be held responsible for this. Short and long\ntenn bank loans, taken together, displayed hardly any size-specific pattern in 1979 and\nnominal increases, with the small firms still achieving higher rates than the large ones. In\nthe entire period 1979-82 the size-dependent trend in credit is reflected very clearly in its\nshare in the balance sheet total. In the case of finns with a low credit rating which depend\nstronglyon bank credit, this share rose by 7 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage\npoints in the case ofmedium-sized enterprises and barely ~ percentage point in the case of\nlarge finns. The maturities differed perceptibly from those of INCs. The large SPsIPs\nexpanded their ratio of short-tenn to long-term bank loans markedly to more than 100 %,\nwhereas the other two size categories still preferred long-term credit, despite a rise in short\ntenn loans. In spite of differing financing patterns, the trend in bank loans for finns of\ndependent legal status was similar to that of INCs. In both categories there was no\nindication that small firms are disadvantaged vis-a-vis large ones in the case oflending. As\nin section 5.2.3, the other forms of credit. too, will be considered as a yardstick for the\nactual demand for credit.\nSole proprietorsbips/partnersbips: \n\n\nUp to DM 5 million\n1 Change from previous year in % (% ofbalance sheet total).- 2 (Change in percentage points).\nThe \"rough\" aggregate of other creditors and other debtors showed no pronounced size\nspecific pattern. As measured by the balance sheet total, creditors declined throughout\nwhile debtors moved in the opposite direction. with the result that, in net terms, creditors\ndecreased (even slightly more sharply in the case of small enterprises than in the other\ncategories). Long-term loans from participating interests likewise fell from 1979 to 1982;\nhence the growing long-term bank: 10ans and the possibly easier availability of corporate\n10ans or proprietors' and partners' loans do not suggest that the supply of the latter is\nlimited for SMEs.\nAs in the case of the INes, supplier's credits provide no indication for the SPsIPs that a\npossible fmancing need is covered by this form of credit instead of bank loans. The\npatterns between the individual size categories differ, however. In the case of small firms\nthe trade creditors and trade debtors declined already at the start of the economic\ndownswing in 1980 but on the whole (net) creditors increased sligthly. This is found for\nmedium-sized firms as weIl, although the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet\ndeclined only from 1982. Since the large SPsIPs even expanded their debtors in 1982, the\nbalance might provide an indication of some lending to other size categories. but the\nadditional financing scope was comparatively small compared with the expansion of bank:\nloans.\nIf. finally, bank: 10ans are measured against all other creditors, the results derived from the\nabove statements are confirmed (see table 10). The other forms of credit were not used by\nenterprises as additional sources of finance in lieu of possibly restricted bank: loans.\nInstead, the ratio of bank: loans to other loans increased considerably, particularly for\nSMEs, whereas it remained nearly constant for the large finns. This seems to indicate that\nthe SMEs cover their need for external resources predominantly through the banks.\nSole proprietorshipsipartDerships: \n\nbank loans compared with other IODs' Table 10 \n\nUp to DM 5 million\n1 Bank loans as % ofother loans.

The disaggregated analysis chosen here shows,\nhowever, that the fall in bank loans was attributable mainly to the large INCs, which played\na dominating role in terms of volume and to which, according to the assymetrical\ninformation theory, the phenomenon of bank lending restrictions should least apply. This\nreveals how important the differentiated analysis by size categories and legal forms iso\nAlthough the databases for the INCs and the SPslPs differed in several respects,54 similar\nresults were obtained for the most important aspects. The creditworthiness and the asset\nformation responses displayed parallel size-specific patterns over time. The analysis ofthe\ntrend in the various credit forms clearly shows that there was no discrimination against\nsmall firms in terms of bank lending - irrespective ofthe legal form. On the one band, the\ngrowth rates were largest for finns with a tumover of less than DM 5 million and, on the\nother, the increase in the ratio of bank loans to all other loans was largest in the case of\nthese firms. Another indication is the trend in long-term bank loans compared with\ncreditors from participating interests and proprietors' and partners' loans. The extent to\nwhich this is attributable to typical institutional regulations in Germany or to other causes\nwill be discussed at the end of this paper. First the period 1988-93 will be analysed in\ngreater detail in line with the procedure adopted for the earlier period.\n54 Bearing in mind tbe credit cbannel argument the diverging levels of bank dependence and own funds\nshould be mentioned. Irrespective of this, tbe differing structure of bank loans (shott-term versus long-term)\ndoes not seem to influence tbe results either.\n5.3.1. Overall economic environment\nWhereas west Gennan real GDP grew only moderately in the middle of the eighties,\neconomic momentum increased from 1988. By 1991 output in western Gennany had risen\nby an average of 3 ~ %, not least owing to the stimuli imparted by Gennan reunification.\nThe unemployment rate fell to 5.7 %, a level that had last been undershot ten years earlier.\nThis trend was also reflected in consumer prices. Along with an accelerated monetary\ngrowth and external factors, the upward movement of prices which began in the course of\n1988 was a factor in triggering the increase in the discount and lombard rates from 2 ~ %\nand 4 ~ %, respectively, to 3 ~ % and 5 ~ % in the second half of the year. The rise in\nconsumer prices reached a provisional peak, at 4 %, in 1992 when the cyclical climate\ncooled perceptibly. GDP rose by only 1 % %, and industrial output dropped by just over\nI %. In the ensuing year, when the price level rose again slightly, the economyslipped into\na recession which hit the producing sector particularly hard (- 7.0 %). However, as earlyas\n1994 a relatively strong economic recovery set in. Monetary policy makers continued the\ntighter course they had adopted in mid-1988 until the autumn of 1992. At that time the\ndiscount and lombard rates amounted to 8 % % and 9 % %, respectively. Central bank\ninterest rates were lowered from September 1992 throughout 1993. Interest rates were cut\nin seven steps, and at the end of 1993 the key interest rates amounted to 5 % % and 6 % %,\nrespectively.\nAs for the preceding period 1978-82, the financing structUre in the first year of the period,\nTable 11 shows that there were pronounced differences between all three size categories of\nthe INCs on the liability side ofcorporate balance sheets. The own fund ratio, in particular,\nincreased sharply with the size of the finns while the reverse was the case for the\nsignificance ofbank loans - in line with the movement among INCs in 1978. For the small\nINCs, the share of bank 10ans in the balance sheet total came to nearly 30 %, but for the\nlarge ones to only 6 %.

Apart from bank loans, trade credits and other\nshort-tenn creditors55 played an important role. As regards trade credits, a11 size categories\nwere net creditors, with the medium-sized and large firms predominating. Tbe data on\nshort-term debtors from participating interests56 - together with the size-specific structure\nofother creditors - pennit the conclusion that large firms may have lent resources to SMEs.\nIn line with section 5.2, enterprises ofdependent legal status will be analysed in addition to\nINCs.

Although, according to table 11, the small INCs and the small SPs/Ps had almost the\nsa~e own funds ratio, the medium-sized and large firms showed differences of 7 and 1l\npercentage points, respectively, between the two categories. The bank dependence of the\ntwo legal forms decreased with their sizes but was clearly greater for SPsIPs than for INCs.\nThe bank debt ofthe SPsIPs was more strongly oriented to the Iong term than that ofINCs.\nIn the case of small SPs/Ps,the long-term orientation was most pronounced at a ratio of\ndatabases showed different structures and may therefore influence the results in respect of\nthe credit channel.

Bank dependence moved in the\nopposite direction. In 1988 the share of bank loans in the balance sheet total of SMEs was\nconsiderably larger than in 1978, although a movement in the opposite direction was found\nfor the large enterprises - reflecting increasing disintermediation.59 For both periods,\nhowever, the small unlimited-liability firms were indebted to the banks over a longer term\nthan their large counterparts, whereas the opposite was the case with the INCs.\nIn line with the stylised facts outlined above, the credit channel theory would lead us to\nexpect that the small enterprlses react more sensitively to restrictive monetary policy\nmeasures. In addition, firms might tend to provide greater indications for the existence of\ntrend in creditworthiness and bank dependence suggests a more acute impact of monetary\npolicy on corporate behaviour. As the approach adopted was the same as that described in\nsection 5.2, only the most significant results will be discussed below.\n5.3.3. Incorporated enterprises and the credit channel\nAs regards the financial position of INCs over time, all ratios analysed deteriorated for the\nSMEs in the period 1989-93, and this trend was most pronounced for small firms. This\nbecomes immediately evident from the coverage ratios which, according to table 13,\namounted to roughly 44 % in 1989 for both size categories. Several years later the small\nINCs showed a ratio of 127 % (which means that they did not even generate the interest\npaid), while the medium-sized firms had a ratio of 84 %. The firms with a turnover ofover\nDM 50 million recorded only a very moderate deterioration oftheir financial position; only\nin 1993 was a slight \"slippage\" of the own funds ratio registered. Despite unfavourable\nunderlying conditions, the cash flow indicator even displayed a positive trend from 1992.\nThis confirms the result derived for the earlier period, namely that in phases ofa restrictive\nmonetary policy the impact on creditworthiness increases inversely to the size of the\nenterprises. It should be noted that this trend was agam recorded in the context of an\neconomic downswing.\nJust like bank dependence and creditworthiness, fixed asset formation showed a size\nspecific trend (see table 14).60 The small INCs increased their tangible fixed assets sharply\n59 For the longer-term trend in own funds and bank creditors, see Deutsche Bundesbank (1992b, pp. 26-27).\n60 For stockbuilding no size-dependent reactions typical ofthe credit channel could be found.\nuntil 1991 but reduced their asset formation with the start of the economic downswing,\nwhich is also reflected in the negative investment ratio in 1993. By contrast, the net asset\nformation of enterprises in the two other size categories was positive in 1992 as weIl, with\nrising shares of tangib1e fixed assets in the balance sheet total. From 1993, however, the\nmedium-sized and large firms, too, could not avoid reducing their capita1 stock. The credit\nchanne1-specific indicators disp1ayed a pattern which was largely in line with that described\nin section 5.2. Since, however, asset formation responded more strongly in the period\n1988-93 than before, supp1y restrictions by the banks may perhaps now be confirmed as an\nexplanation. As before, bank loans of the individual size categories will be considered in a\nfirst step.\nIncorporated enterprises: financial position Table 13\nUp to DM 5 million\n1 % ofbalance sheet total.- 2 Interest paid as % ofprofit for the year (including interest paid).\n3 % oftotal output.- 4 Change in percentage points.\nIncorporated eaterprlses: uaet formatioa ud buk 10\u00b7\u00b7' Table 14\nAsset fonnation rariol\nup to DM 5 million\nBank )oans~\nup to DM 5 million\nt.J\n1 Net fixed asset formation as % oftotal output.-l Change ftom previous year in % (% ofbalance sheet total).\n3 Change in percentage points.\nUntil 1991, the peak of the high-interest-rate phase, bank loans were comparatively\nexpansionary (both in absolute and relative terms) for all size categories; subsequently the\nincrease decelera~ and in 1993 bank loans even fell absolutely for large firms. The small\nenterprises continued to fare best. Total short and long-term loans grew by 6 % and 2 % in\nnominal terms; their share in the balance sheet total rose by nearly 4 percentage points\ncompared with 1991. Hence, at least in this cross comparison, no discrimination against\nsmall enterprises in lending could be found. The trend in bank debt was associated with an\nincrease in the ratio ofshort-term to long-term loans to over 100 % for all size categories;\nin 1988 this ratio bad been not quite two-thirds for INCs with a turnover of over DM 50\nmillion.\nThe other relevant liabilities, trade credits and other creditors, likewise provide no\nindication that possible credit requirements may have been covered through these channels\nrather than bank loans. The ratio of bank loans to allother forms of credit increased very\ndistinctly for the SMEs, while the ratio remained largely constant for the large firms\nthroughout the years under review. Apointer to credit rationing might be given by the\nsubitem long-term creditors from participating interests. Their share in the balance sheet\ntotal increased slightly for small firms, whereas it tended to decline for the two larger\ngroups. This suggests that in contractionary periods small firms also obtain credit from\naffiliated enterprises. Since, however, large firmst debtors from participating interests did\nnot increase this might be due to loans by partners and proprietors. There was still no\n\"overtake effect\", however, since long-term bank loans gained much more in importance,\nwhich means that credit institutions are the preferred source offinance ofINCs. Although \nas outlined above - the conditions for the emergence of the credit channel were fairly\nfavourable, uo indications ofits operation could be found in the period 1988-93.\n5.3.4. Sole proprietorships/partnerships and the credit channel\nThe results found for INCs hold true for enterprises of dependent legal status as weH.\nDuring the period 1989-93 the creditworthiness of small enterprises was affected most (see\ntable 15). In the last year of that period the own funds ratios of the SMEs even fell below\nthe 10 % mark.61 Firms in aH three size categories expanded their capital stock until 1992;\nin 1993, when the full force of the recession was feIt, the stocks of tangible fixed assets\nwere reduced, as is shown in table 16. Irrespective of whether it is measured by the\npercentage change in tangible fixed assets, the balance sheet ratio or the investment ratio,\nthe effect on investment behaviour was most pronounced in the case of firms with a\ntumover of less than DM 5 million.

This can be rated as\nevidence that bank lending is not squeezed to the disadvantage of small firms, as is claimed\nin the credit channelliterature.

The trend in the ratio of bank loans to other credits, which may also be used as\nan indicator of the operation of the credit channel, showed a pronounced rise for the small\nfirms. This rise was so strong that in 1993 bank loans exceeded other creditors by almost\n30 %; five years previously, the ratio bad been nearly even. This is also to be seen as\nevidence of the bank dependence of small firms, which can be seen to increase over time.\nThe contrary would have to be expected according to the credit channel theory.\nThe proposition that asset fonnation of small enterprises declines more sharply in\nrestrictive monetary phases can be clearly confinned for the INCs and SPs/Ps in the period\n1988-93. For neither legal fonn~ however, was there any size-specific discrimination in\nbank lending. Neither the trend in bank loans in a cross comparison nor the ratio of bank\nloans to other credits showed corresponding patterns. Compared with the findings for\n1978-82, these results are largely similar,62 although the two databases differed\nconsiderably regarding the financial position and the bank dependence of the finns\nanalysed.63 The descriptive method chosen for observing the individual fonns of credit in\nthe various size categories thus seems to have reached the limits of its infonnative value.\nAll that remains is to examine whether infonnation on restrictions ofcredit for small finns\ncan be derived from the movement of the size-specific interest rates. Here, too, only data\nfrom the Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics for the manufacturing sector were\nevaluated.\n5.4. Comparison offirm-specific cost ofcredit\nAccording to the credit channel approach, any size-specific discrimination against finns\nshould also be reflected in the interest rates levied on bank loans. Either interest rates\nshould increase far more sharply for small enterprises thari market rates in the wake of a\nrestrictive monetary policy and the associated supply shortages, or else they should actually\nmove more slowly owing to credit rationing. The approach usually adopted in the literature\nis geared to published interest rates, which for the reasons already mentioned (see\nsection 4.1) ean hardly supply infonnative results. This section is based on interest rates\nderived from corporate data. The interest rates of enterprises with a turnover of over\nDM 50 million were used as the control variable as they could be expeeted to be relatively\nundistorted and most nearly in line with market eonditions beeause large finns are probably\nleast affected by asymmetrie infonnation.

It has to be borne in mind that only average rates, not marginal interest rates,\n\n\n63 Regarding the maturity of the debt structures there are hardly any deviations between the two periods \n\nunder review. \n\ncould be ascertained; this reduces the informative value since it is not exactly the interest\nrate for a credit unit of additional demand that can be detennined - as would be desirable in\nThe average interest rate is detennined from the ratio of interest paid to interest-bearing\ncreditors. Interest-bearing creditors include bank loans, loans from participating interests\nand allother creditors. The method of calculation shows that the average interest rate is a\nsomewhat problematic variable. Unlike creditors, interest paid cannot be split into short\nterm and long-term. Liabilities themselves are a very heterogeneous variable. They include\nitems for which it is not known whether any interest was charged at all and, if so, what\namount. Particularly loans from participating interests, which include proprietors' and\npartners' loans, are likely to be the subject of \"window-dressing\" by accountants, and the\nother credits include items such as laX liabilities and unpaid wages and salaries. Finally,\ncreditors are only available as end-of-year levels and not as averages for the year, regarding\nthe maturity, too, no further differentiation beyond short-term and long-term is possible.\nAccording to table 17, a clear size-specific graduation of average interest rates could be\nfound for both legal forms in 1978. The smaller the enterprise, the higher was the average\ninterest rate. The differentiation was even more pronounced for the SPslPs than for the\nINCs. This graduation suggests the existence of premiums in line with the theory of\nasymmetric information, but it can also be explained by other factors. Possible causes are\nthe negotiating strength of the fmns or the existence of fixed costs for the credit agreement,\nwhich in the case of small loans, must be paid for through higher interest rates. The debt\nstructure of the individual size categories - short-term versus long-term loans, the share of\nbank loans in interest-bearing creditors65 - offers no explanation for the differences in\ncredit costs. The relatively low level of average lending rates in comparison with market\nrates in the corporate balance sheet statistics may be due, inter aUa, to the fact that no\ninterest was paid on various components included under interest-bearing creditors - which\nseems likely.\n64 Generally\u00b7 the difference between the annual average interest rates likewise provides no precise\nam>roximation for the marginaJ cost of crediL\n65 The structure of creditors could playa role because, according to figure 3, the interest rates for current\naccount credits are higher than for long-tenn loans or because, in the case of bank loans. it can certainly be\nassumed that the firms incur interest costs.\nup to DM 5 million\nup to DM 5 million\nT as % of interest-bearing creditors (= creditors excluding supplier's credit,\n,\nived on account and provisions).- 2 Change in lending rates in percentage points.\nWith the rise in central bank interest rates from 1979, the average interest rates paid by\n. INCs ofall size categories likewise increased steadily up to and including 1981, the peak of\nthe interest rate trend at the time. For the SMEs the increase was markedly sharper, at\nalmost 4 %, than for the large firms (+ 3 Yz %). This might be regarded as an indication of a\nsupply shortage for firms with weaker creditworthiness and a strong dependence on banks,\nin line with the credit channel theory. Exactly the reverse trend was found for the SPslPs,\nhowever, among which enterprises with a tumover ofover DM 50 million ultimately had to\npay higher interest rates than the medium-sized firms. This matches neither the trend in\nfinancial ratios nor the trend in the structure of creditors. The slightly sluggish interest rate\nadjustment for the SMEs might suggest credit rationing; it appears rather implausible,\nhowever, to simultaneously give higher premiurns as the reason for the reaction of the\nsmall and medium-sized INCs. Furthermore, such a \"dual\" argumentation contradicts the\nIf the period 1988-92 is considered, there was initially a size-dependent differentiation of\ninterest rates both for INCs and for SPsIPs in 1988, although the interest rate differences\nwere larger in the case of firms of dependent legal status (see table 18). Up to the peak of\nthe interest rate phase in 1992, the cost of credit for the two legal forms did not move in\nparallel, however; the trend even deviated distinctly from the observation period 1978-81.\nIn the case of INCs, the rise increased with the size category, so that ultimately the\nstructure of 1988 almost levels out. For the SPsIPs interest rates rose irrespective of the\nsize by 2.6 to 2.7 percentage points. These diverging trends, which argue both for and\nagainst a discrimination against small enterprises, cannot plausibly be explained by the\ntrend in the debt structure or the creditworthiness ratios.\nup to DM 5 million\n+\n+\n+\nup to DM 5 million\n+\n+\n+\nI fnterest paid as % ofinterest-bearing creditors (- creditors excluding supplier's credit. payments\nreceived on account and provisions).- 2 Change in lending rates in percentage points.\nThe analysis of the average interest rates at first appears rather promising for the initial\nyears 1978 and 1988. The clearly size-specific structure could indeed be explained by\nmeans ofpremiums cbarged to firms with a weaker creditworthiness. However, other inter\npretations are possible, with the result that no\u00b7 clear conclusion can be drawn as to a\ndiscrimination as predicted by the credit channel theory. Once the analysis is extended to\nthe \"hot\" monetary policy pbases, any consistency in the initial years is lost. Nearly all\nvariants of cbanges in interest rates occur; the result is that neither credit rationing nor\nrising interest rates as a result ofa tighter supply can be confirmed. On the whole it can be\nsaid that the attempt to draw conclusions on the credit channel from the cost of credit on\nthe basis of the balance sheets is just as unsuccessful as the approach adopted in the\nliterature hitherto. Ultimately the available data are not precise enough to aHow an exact\nclarification of the facts. The interest rate reactions cannot supply any additional\ninformation for the analysis ofcredit movements.\n6. Conclusions and outlook \n\nThe credit channel theory says that restrictive monetary policy measures operate not only\nvia the interest rate effect but, in addition, via restrictions on the credit supply side which \nover and above market interest rate levels - lead to rising lending rates andlor credit\nrationing with a correspondingly sluggish interest rate adjustment. Owing to their greater\nbank dependence and weaker creditworthiness, this is likely to affect primarily small\nenterprises. The approach to testing the credit channel theory adopted in the present study\nwith the aid of the Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics is based on a cross\ncomparison ofthe movement ofbank loans between firms ofthe individual size categories\nand on the movement ofbank loans against other forms ofcredit; furthermore, size-specific\nreactions ofinterest rates for corporate loans were examined. The credit channe1 theory has\nprecise response anticipations for all these aspects. Past findings for the United States and\nin some cases other countries in favour of the credit channel are very impressive, but they\ncannot be confirmed for the manufacturing sector in Germany. Irrespective of the period\nunder review and the legal form of the firms, bank loans and other creditors provide no\nindication of any discrimination by banks against small enterprises.66 Supply-induced\nselective effects of monetary policy, which might serve as an argument, say, for interest\nrate subsidies to cushion structural distortions, are thus not identifiable. Hence, the credit\nchannel offers no explanation for the fact that the fixed asset formation of small firms\nresponded more strongly than that of large firms in the periods analysed. In the aggregate,\nbe attributed to credit restrictions induced by monetary policy in the sense of the credit\nchannel approach. To this extent, the results obtained here are in line with the analyses by\nNeuberger (1994) and Tsatsaronis (1995) who, using econometric methods and overall\neconomic data, found no indications ofsupply disturbances by banks.\nThe results derived in this study contradict numerous studies for other countries. Three\naspects seem to be particularly relevant for explaining this difference: institutional\nconditions in Germany, characteristics of the source material and shortcomings of the\nevaluation method.\n66 Stricdy speaking, it cannot be mied out that the potential demand for credit, which cannot be measured,\nexceeds actually observable credits to small enterprises and that therefore credit was rationed. Nor can any\ndear statements be made on possible size-specific premiums which may have formed part of the cost of\ncredit, since the mterest rate reactions derived from the corporate balance sheets show no systematic and\nmterpretable pattem.\n\nThe asymmetric distribution of information and the associated credit restriction as a result\nof a deterioration of creditworthiness, which are the premises on which the balance sheet\nchannel is based, can be reduced by various institutional structures within the financial\nsystem.67 Such structures include, in particular, the relationship between banks and\nborrowers. In Germany the house bank principle is one of the mainstays for the SMEs, in\nparticular.68 Traditionally there are very close links between the two agents, and financial\ntransactions, including private transactions, are predominantly or even exclusively settled\nvia the house bank.69 Owing to long-standing relations, this results, firstly, in a good\nknowledge of the situation of the firm and, secondly, banks have a certain overview of the\nprivate financial position. This is ofparticular importance in the case of firms ofdependent\nlegal status which, according to the corporate balance sheet statistics, have a very low own\nfunds ratio and whose proprietors are also personally liable. Compared with many other\ncountries, there is a further difference in the nature of property law and bankruptcy\nlegislation. 80th are designed relatively favourably for creditors in Germany. In contrast to\nother countries, real collateralisation is possible without special formal requirements and,\nmoreover, loan collateral is very largely acknowledged in the event of insolvency, whereas\nabroad it is frequently not the interests of the secured creditors which are to the fore.70 It\nfollows from this that banks, especially house banks, can limit their losses in the event of\nbankruptcy and are able to grant their loans \"at smaller risks\" than in countries where no\nsuch regulations exist. The house bank principle and the relevant legal regulations reduce\nthe information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers; in this way they moderate the\nnon-neutrality (which can be theoretically substantiated) ofthe fmancial sector in respect of\neconomic activities. As a result, the credit channel, and especially the balance sheet\nchannel, may not be effective in Germany because the financial system \"cushions\" moral\nhazard and adverse selection by the mechanisms described above. As mentioned in section\n3.2, the \"transfer\" of the bank lending channel hypothesis is also affected by institutional\nfactors. The more highly developed the financial markets are, the less significant this\n68 Owing to the possibility (wbich is exeluded in other countries) for credit institutions to acquire\nparticipating interests in large enterprises. there are also relatively elose relationsbips between banks and\n69 It is to be assumed, however, that even small and medium-sized enterprises normally have several\nconnections with cremt institutions other than their house bank. In some of the literature a declining\nsignificance ofthe house bank relationsbip is derived from this (see Fischer, 1990).\n70 Tbe scale of collateralising in Germany is likely to be very luge. According to a study by\nDrukarczyklDuttielRieger (1985), 80 % of the credit agreements and 70 % of the cremt volume - with\nreference to short and medium-term loans - are collateralised. It is to be assumed that the share of collateral\nfor long-term loans is even bigher.\ninfluence is like1y to be. This situation applies above all in the United States, whereas the\nfollowing is true for Germany: \"Financial markets in Germany are relatively undeveloped\ncompared to most other industrial countries.\" (Allen/Gale, 1995, p. 183). Accordingly, the\nbank lending channel should in fact operate very strongly in Germany. As in the case ofthe\nbalance sheet channel, however, the house bank principle may have a moderating effect for\nthe banks hold potentially liquid assets or sell securities in order to be able to satisfy\nenterprises' requests for credit (see Gertler/Gilchrist, 1993, p. 47). It is to be assumed that\ngood customers, in particular, benefit from such buffers offered by their house banks and\nare therefore not faced with additional supply restrictions.\nAlthough the house bank principle and comprehensive collateralising options reduce credit\nsupply restrictions, it is questionable whether new, young firms benefit from this as well.\nTo this extent, the credit channel might operate in that segment. This group of enterprises\nis not represented in the Bundesbank's source material, however, for, owing to the\ncylindered sampie structure used, enterprises are at least five or six years old, irrespective\nof the size category (see section 5.1). This implies, furthermore, that the probability of\ninsolvency is much smaller for enterprises inc1uded in the Bundesbank statistics than it is\nfor young firms and that therefore a restriction of the credit supply by banks is on average\nless likely despite dec1ining creditworthiness over time.71 Even though the database does\nnot inc1ude these enterprises and thus distorts the degree of representativeness, the \"error\"\nin respect of the credit channel is difficult to assess. Small firms, which as a rule is the\ncategory in which young firms are found, have only a very small economic weight even in\nthe universe, as is shown by the tumover tax statistics. It is therefore questionable whether\nsteep economic downswings (which the advocates of the credit channel seek to explain)\ncan be substantiated by means of such a special segment.72 The statistics used select not\nonly by age but also systematically by size and creditworthiness, although all three features\noverlap. The dominance of larger enterprises becomes immediately evident from a\ncomparison with the relevant data from the tumover tax statistics (see section 5.1). As\nregards creditworthiness, trade bills are accepted by the Bundesbank only from firms with a\ngood credit rating. This means that, for prudential reasons, the commercial banks take care\nto submit only high-quality bills of exchange to the Bundesbank so as to avoid rejection.\n71 For the link between age and insolvency, see, for example, Angele (1996).\n72 Irrespective of their relevance to the transmission mechanism, credit restrictions for young frrms are a\nmajor economic policy problem in the context of structural change. The Gerrnan house bank system, which\ninstitutionalises lending to \"old\" customers, may even have a negative impact, owing to a possible braking\neffect, on the process of change in the corporate landscape (see Audretsch, 1995).\nFor that reason, commercial banks grant bill-based loans primarily to good customers. It\nfollows from the age of the firms, the size and the bill of exchange practices that the\nbalance sheet statistics present a special selection of enterprises. Although they represent\nthe core of the corporate landscape of the manufacturing sector, they do not embrace the\nmarginal segments.73 In order to reduce this ttquality bias\" and to be able to analyse the\ncredit channel more precisely, there are various possibilities for improving the database.\nThe inclusion of new, young firms requires supplementary analyses of data which are\navailable to banks which promote business start-ups. In addition, surveys among borrowers\nand lenders might provide information on the amount ofcollateral and on credit rationing,\nLe. about the \"true\" interest rate or the potential demand for credit, on which the official\nstatistics contain no direct data. Finally, besides corporate data, the Bundesbank's\nborrowers statistics could be evaluated. For one thing, that would obviate the need to\nconfine the analysis to the manufacturing sector as all corporate loans are included; for\nanother, the quarterly data available are more sensitive to monetary stimuli than the annual\ndata from the corporate balance sheets. A further option would be to evaluate the balance\nsheets of banks. Following KashyaplStein (1995), the credit patterns of small and large\nbanks could be investigated; size-specific lending might provide indications of the\nexistence ofa credit channel.\nApart from the data selection, a further bias might result from the methodology used.\nAlthough data disaggregated by size categories and legal forms as weil as types of credit\nare used, there is a danger of a considerable loss of information owing to the use of group\ndata; moreover, the analysis was confined to the observation ofrates ofchange or the trend\nin specific ratios. There is a good theoretical basis for interpreting the figures, but the\nprocedure necessarily implies limitations on the informative value of the results. An\nimprovement may be possible by means of microeconometric analysis. Even if the results\nof the panel studies have not yet been able to provide convincing proof ofthe existence of\nthe credit channel, it appears sensible to pursue this approach both theoretically and\nempirically. Perbaps the results obtained here can be formulated more precisely by\nestimating the size-specific investment behaviour. The use of corporate data in Germany\nhas the disadvantage that the applicability oftime-series-analytical methods is very limited.\n0wing to the limitation to annual data and the numerous structura1 breaks, the number of\nconsistent points of observation is relatively small; moreover, the informative value of a\n73 Tbis is confmned by the below-avemge insolvency risk of firms represented in the Bundesbank's source\nmaterial compared with all German enterprises (see Deutsche Bundesbank. 1992a).\nlong time series would be extremely distorted owing to the survivor bias.74 The borrowers\nstatistics can be ofsome help as the quarterly data at least permit a time series analysis.\nThe above statements show that there may be various reasons why this study could not\nconfirm the credit channel hypothesis for Germany. Although there is a distinct bias of\ncorporate data in favour of firms of good creditworthiness, it must be remembered that the\nBundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics are more comprehensive than all other\ndatabases available. In particular, they contain a great number of small firms and also\nunincorporated enterprises. Moreover, the result can be underpinned in terms of\ninstitutional economics. Institutional regulations reduce credit restrietions by banks which\nmay result from the market failure of asymmetrie information; the rejection of the credit\nchannel theory for the core sector of the German economy - the manufacturing sector \ntherefore appears to be quite justified.\n74 This applies if, as with a cylindered sampie, every enterprise is included in the sampie in every year.\nReferences \n\nAllen, F./Gale, D.
