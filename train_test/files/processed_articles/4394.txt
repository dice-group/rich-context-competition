    "abstract": "Abstract\nNon-Hispanic Black mothers are 2.3 times more likely than White mothers to receive delayed or no prenatal care. Black\nwomen possess a long history of midwifery-led care, but there is a recent absence in the literature about the role of\nmidwifery in this population. This systematic review elucidates the state-of-the-science regarding Black women's experience\nof antenatal care, including the role of midwives. Sixteen articles identified through CINAHL and PubMed databases were\nincluded using specific parameters. Three themes were used to identify Black Women's antenatal care perceptions: (a)\ncare disparities, (b) perceptions of antenatal care, and (c) midwifery-led care. Major literature gaps include Black women's\nperception of midwifery as an antenatal care option and the experience and practice of Black midwives today. Understanding\nBlack women's views of midwifery will enable providers to deliver antenatal care options that facilitate improved outcomes\nfor Black women and their neonates.\n",

Rationale for this\ntrend remains unclear. The purpose of this article is to exam-\nine how current literature addresses Black women's experi-\nence of antenatal care, including the role that midwives may\nhave in that care. A brief history of Black midwives and their\nrole as the major health care providers for Black women, as\nwell as the current trends in midwifery, will provide back-\nground and offer a point of reference. While much of the lit-\nerature focuses on birth outcomes, provider qualities, and\nsituational life factors in conjunction with the prenatal care\nreceived by Black women, very few investigate the effects\nthat historical underpinnings may have played in Black\nwomen's current reception of prenatal care. The history of\nBlack women's health care and the prominent role that mid-\nwifery played is all but forgotten.\nThroughout this review, the term Black is used rather\nthan African American as birth certificate data and much of\nthe early demographic data use the term Black as a racial\nindicator.\nBackground\nAntenatal care for Black women was historically provided\nmary health care providers to Black women and were often\ncalled on to assist White women in the south during birth\nof all births in the United States were attended by midwives,\nwhile more than half of all Black births were still attended by\nmidwives (Tandy, 1937). The decline of midwifery among\nthe Black population was precipitated by the Sheppard\u00ad\nTowner Act of 1921, resulting in widespread regulation of\nthe Black midwives in the South who, by this time, were the\nlargest percentage of active midwives (Devitt, 1979; Tandy,\nmedicine and eliminate lay healers, which gained momen-\ntum around the time the American Medical Association\n(AMA) was formed (Robinson, 1984).

This trend,\nalong with the subsequent regulation from the Sheppard\u00ad\nTowner Act, resulted in the gradual elimination of many\nBlack midwives. By 1972, only 1% of all births in the United\nStates were attended by midwives (Devitt, 1979).\nInterest in midwifery-attended birth is resurging, as\nrecently noted by the American College of Nurse-Midwives\n(ACNM).AACNM (2014) report titled \"CNM/CM-Attended\nBirth Statistics in the United States\" stated that 12.1% of all\nvaginal births in the United States were attended by certified\nnurse-midwives (CNMs) and certified midwives (CMs).\nACNM's numbers do not reflect the practice of certified pro-\nfessional midwives, so the actual percentage of midwife\nassisted births may be slightly higher. Despite Black wom-\nen's significant heritage surrounding midwifery, the trend\ntoward midwife-attended births today is higher among Non-\nbirths were attended by CNMs/CMs, whereas 8% of Black,\nlive births were attended by CNMs/CMs (HealthData.gov,\n50% of all Black births were attended by midwives.\nThe demographic characteristics of members of the\nACNM also mirror this trend. In all, 88% of the CNMs, CMs,\nand students enrolled inACNM certified programs are White,\nand 3.6% are Black (Schuiling, Sipe, & Fullerton, 2005). The\ncapacity for enrollment into nurse accredited nurse-midwifery\nreport from ACNM; however, graduates from these programs\nrate of 5.6%. This increase saw an increase in diversity of\nnurse-midwives in all races ranging from 16.1% in Hispanic/\nLatino to 250% in Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islanders.\nThere was an 18.1% rise in the increase of Black midwifery\nstudents (ACNM, 2015). The upward trend in the number of\npracticing midwives as well as the increase in diversity among\nmidwives is encouraging; however, there is still a notable\ngap, both in the literature and in practice, regarding Black\nwomen and current use of midwives.\nMethod\nSearches for both qualitative and quantitative research pub-\nlished in peer reviewed journals were conducted through\nCINAHL and PubMed databases using combinations of\nsearch terms \"infant mortality,\" \"preterm birth,\" \"antenatal,\"\n\"prenatal,\" \"midwife,\" \"black midwife,\" \"granny midwife,\"\n\"African American OR Black women,\" and \"preferences.\"\nPublications selected for final review included a broad range\nof research designs including experimental, case controlled,\nphenomenological, cross-sectional, and ethnographic studies\nmeeting four inclusion criteria: (a) published between 2006\nand 2017, (b) conducted in the United States, (c) included a\nminimum of 13% participation by Black women, and (d)\naddressed antenatal care. Research conducted outside the\nUnited States or conducted within the United States among\nimmigrant Black women was excluded because of the cul-\ntural differences between U.S. born Black women and Black\nwomen born outside of the United States. The threshold of\n13% Black women was selected to ensure the data adequately\nrepresented the perceptions and experiences of Black women.\nThis percentage is the national average of women who iden-\ntify as Black. Preliminary analysis indicated a lack of\nresearch focused primarily on midwives and Black women;\ntherefore, final analysis was conducted on research address-\ning Black women's antenatal care, regardless of provider\ntype. In all, 18 studies were identified using these search cri-\nteria; however, two studies were not included in the analysis\nbecause they were based on data collected from the late\n1900s. These were \"Disparity in Prenatal Care Among\nWomen of Colour in the USA\" by Park, Vincent, and\nHastings-Tolsma and \"Women's Narratives on Quality in\nPrenatal Care: A Multicultural Perspective\" by Wheatley,\nKelley, Peacock, and Delgado. Final analysis was conducted\nResults\nEight of the 16 articles gathered for review were quantitative\nresearch. Of these eight, three sampled Black women exclu-\nsively, two sampled both Black and Latino women, and three\nsampled White, Black, and Latino women. Four of these\nstudies addressed the role of midwives in prenatal care. The\nremaining eight studies were qualitative research. Six of the\nqualitative studies enrolled an exclusively Black population,\nand the remaining two sampled multiple races. Three specifi-\ncally addressed midwife involvement in prenatal care. There\nwas some geographic diversity among the studies ranging\nfrom locations in the Southeast, Northeast, Northwest, and\nMidwest, with a few utilizing data from multiple sites across\nthe United States.\nQuantitative research used well-defined study design and\nanalytics. One quantitative study used data from two sepa-\nrate randomized controlled trials, five were case controlled\nstudies, and two utilized cross-sectional design. Of the eight\nqualitative studies, four were phenomenological and the\nremaining four were ethnographic, grounded theory, com-\nparative case study, and narrative, respectively. Three main\nthemes specific to Black women's experience of antenatal\ncare were identified throughout the literature: (1) care dis-\nparities that affect quality and frequency of antenatal care for\nBlack women, including subthemes (a) discrimination and\n(b) other influences; (2) Black women's perceptions and\npreferences related to their antenatal care; and (3) midwifery-\nled care for Black women. These themes were identified\nthrough careful perusal of the publication provided data and\nconclusions, focusing on the aspects of antenatal care that\naffected or had the potential to affect Black women's experi-\nence of that care. Many of the studies had overlapping pur-\nposes; for example, several of the qualitative interview\nstudies addressed prenatal care preferences, care disparities,\nYoder and Hardy 3\nand discrimination within the same study. In addition,\nalthough discrimination is correlated with disparity in care, it\nwas identified as an individual subtheme of importance\nbecause it also appeared to correlate with satisfaction and\nantenatal health.\nCare Disparities\nThe literature suggests discrimination as a primary factor\naffecting the quality of antenatal care, in addition to other\nstressful life events, limited access to care, drug and alcohol\nuse (linked to stress), and late initiation of prenatal care.\nThese care disparities correlated with adverse birth outcomes\nsuch as preterm and stillbirths.\nDiscrimination. Racial discrimination, affecting the quality of\nprenatal care, is found in both the health care system and\neveryday encounters. Two qualitative studies performed in\ntwo separate communities in Florida linked racial discrimi-\nnation in the health care system to fewer prenatal visits\n(Close, Suther, Foster, El-Amin, & Battle, 2013; Salm Ward,\nMazul, Ngui, Bridgewater, & Harley, 2013). Research par-\nticipants described negative preconceptions held by health\ncare as a deterrent to care, such as assuming they used illicit\ndrugs because they were Black (Ward et al., 2013). Partici-\npants also reported the perception of receiving a different,\nlower quality of care than White women received (Close\net al., 2013). Nearly all the Black women mentioned long\nwaiting periods, occasionally 3 to 4 hr after arriving at a\nclinic. A few felt that White patients waited shorter periods\nof time for care (Close et al., 2013; Daniels, Noe, & May-\nberry, 2006; Savage, Anthony, Lee, Kappesser, & Rose,\n2007). Each of these studies was conducted with few partici-\npants in specific communities, which does not allow for\nstrong external validity per each individual study. However,\nexamining the common experiences of these Black women\nover all the studies together, and given the geographic diver-\nsity--two in Florida, one in Georgia, and one in Ohio--the\nsimilarities suggest that the experiences of these women may\nnot be limited to their individual communities. Another qual-\nitative study among compared differences between two\ngroups of Black women of low socioeconomic status--late\nand early initiators of prenatal care--noting perceptions of\ndiscrimination or insensitivity in the clinic were most com-\nmon among late initiators (Daniels et al., 2006). Across all\nthese studies, discrimination in the clinics coincides with\nreduced desire to return regularly.\nThe stress of discrimination is also linked with an\nincreased incidence of PTB (Rankin, David, & Collins, 2011;\nWard et al., 2013). This stress was succinctly expressed by a\nfemale participant: \" . . . it's been like this forever. You learn\nto go last. No matter how much people talk about it, it is the\nsurveying 277 Black women delivering at a hospital in\nChicago found that those who delivered preterm were more\nlikely to report daily incidents of discrimination than women\nwho delivered full term. Interestingly, the research suggested\nthat subtle forms of discrimination such as being talked down\nto or hearing surprise expressed over one's intelligence or\nindustriousness was more strongly related to PTB than other\nforms (Rankin et al., 2011). This finding may be attributed to\nthe possibility that these \"subtle\" forms of discrimination are\nmore frequent because they are not as easily recognized as\nsuch by the majority culture.\nEnvironment and negative health behaviors.Environmental\nfactors such as stressful life events and access to care were\nalso addressed as affecting both birth outcome and regular\nprenatal care. Per Hogue et al. (2013), in a population case\ncontrol study, Black women were more likely than White\nwomen to have financial, emotional, and partner-related\nstressors, and women experiencing financial and partner-\nrelated stressors were at increased odds for stillbirths. This\nwas an extensive study collecting data from 59 community\nacademic hospitals from several different states (Hogue\net al., 2013). Transportation and access to care were identi-\nfied stressors noted by participants as the second most fre-\nquent barrier to receiving prenatal care (Close et al., 2013).\nTransportation barriers identified by participants in an ethno-\ngraphic study located in Ohio ranged from inability to afford\na car to long and inconvenient bus schedules (Savage et al.,\n2007). Participants stated that the few clinics located near\ntheir homes were often busy, and traveling to a hospital or\nmore accessible clinic was time intensive (Close et al., 2013;\nSavage et al., 2007). The negative outcomes of these stress-\nors coupled with the effects of discrimination already dis-\ncussed above suggest a significant burden of disparity that\nBlack women face to have a healthy pregnancy.\nA health behavior addressed in several studies that affects\nbirth outcomes of Black women was drug and alcohol use. It\nis well documented that use of drugs and alcohol during the\nprenatal period increases incidents of adverse birth outcomes\n(National Institute of Health, 2012). Among three qualitative\nstudies that interviewed Black women concerning their\nthoughts on prenatal care, drug and alcohol use was a recur-\ngraphic study described knowing other Black women in their\nneighborhood who used drugs and alcohol during pregnancy,\nalthough none of the Black women interviewed admitted to\ndrug use. Drug and alcohol use appeared to be a greater prob-\nlem among pregnant teens and women who were under sig-\nPerceptions of Antenatal Care\nMost of the qualitative studies identified Black women's per-\nceptions about their antenatal care, provider experiences, and\nview on pregnancy. These perceptions often defined how\nthey experienced antenatal care.\n4 SAGE Open\nKnowledge deficit, or the perception that prenatal care\nwas unnecessary, was not cited as a major issue. Most Black\nwomen reported their awareness of the value of prenatal\ncare, even if they did not receive regular prenatal care them-\nselves. Some voiced frustration that although they under-\nstood how to appropriately care for themselves and regularly\nattended prenatal visits, their infants still were born with\ncomplications (Close et al., 2013). There were a few study\nparticipants, however, who mentioned lack of knowledge as\na deterrent of prenatal care for other women they knew\n(Daniels et al., 2006). In addition, a study conducted by\nTucker Edmonds, Mogul, and Shea (2015) found that the use\nof ultrasounds increased the perception of value of prenatal\ncare by low-income Black women.\nPerception of providers was another theme noted in the\nliterature. A study interviewing low-income Black women in\nPhiladelphia found that the women perceived lack of personal\nrelationships and discontinuity of care with their physicians,\nwhile appreciating the relationships they formed with the\nnursing staff they saw on a repeated basis (Tucker Edmonds\net al., 2015). Conversely, a study implemented in Detroit\namong a sample of Black women failed to find that trust in\nproviders differed significantly between CNMs and physi-\ncians (Peters, Benkert, Templin, & Cassidy-Bushrow, 2014).\nHow Black women perceived their pregnancy played a\nsignificant role in how they approached prenatal care.\nWomen who reported feeling disinterested, depressed, or\ndevastated about their pregnancy were more likely to initiate\nprenatal care late, or not at all (Daniels et al., 2006; Tucker\nEdmonds et al., 2015). Several studies suggest that an\nunplanned or unwanted pregnancy may have a negative\neffect on a Black woman's pursuit of antenatal care (Daniels\ntioned that unplanned pregnancies could be felt by Black\nmothers to be an interruption to future plans, such as higher\neducation. A closely related study conducted in a predomi-\nnantly Black Florida community recorded participant's\nviews suggesting that the tendency for Blacks within the\ncommunity to place less importance on planning pregnancies\nthan White women was related to a difference in cultural\nmentality--dealing with events as they happen (Close et al.,\n2013). The effect of an unwanted pregnancy had the propen-\nsity to cause such significant distress that the woman might\nintentionally avoid prenatal care (Savage et al., 2007).\nThe findings from the literature substantially point toward\nnumerous factors that lead to decreased prenatal care for\nBlack women. Women acknowledged that late prenatal care\nwas a problem in their communities, and cited discrimination,\ninaccessibility to clinics, mistrust of medical providers, and\nunplanned or unwanted pregnancies as main reasons they or\nother women might initiate late prenatal care. Besides affect-\ning incidences of PTB, late or no prenatal care can also affect\nthe postpartum health of the mother and child, as it is corre-\nlated with decreased incidences of postnatal and well-child\nvisits.Aretrospective/prospective urban study that followed a\nsample of low-income Black women after delivery for a year\nfound that women who attended prenatal visits were more\nstatistically more likely to attend postnatal visits and well-\nchild checkups. About 50% of the women who did not attend\nprenatal care visits also did not attend their postnatal or well-\nchild visits (York, Tulman, & Brown, 2000). Skipping these\nimportant health visits could contribute to decreased health\nscreening for both the mother and child.\nMidwifery-Led Care\nLess than half of all reviewed studies discussing antenatal\ncare for Black women specifically addressed midwifery-led\ncare among Black women; only one of these seven mentioned\nBlack midwives. The single study by Guerra-Reyes and\nHamilton from Indiana University Bloomington was of inter-\nest; it presented how Black midwives and doulas articulate or\npresent their role to the broader community. They noted the\nnearly complete lack of topic-related peer reviewed literature\nand utilized the web to locate sites run by self-identified mid-\nwives and doulas. The researchers gathered qualitative data\nfrom the sites by looking at the demographics, stories, and\nnarratives written by the Black midwives or doulas. One third\nof the noted sites were devoted to advocacy and activism; the\nremaining two thirds offered services and advocacy. Main\nthematic areas were (a) a strong link to tradition, (b) providers\nidentifying with more than one role (i.e., activist and doula),\nand (c) a sense of urgency in linking their practice to the\nfuture. This study had several limitations, including the\npotential for outdated information, inability to interact with\nthe website owners, exclusion of providers who do not have\nwebsites, or whose websites are not picked up by the search\nengines, and nondistinction between midwives and doulas.\nHowever, it shed some light on the perceptions of Black mid-\nwives and doulas today (Guerra-Reyes & Hamilton, 2016).\nThe predominant theme that ran through many of the\nremaining studies was CenteringPregnancy, a prenatal care\nmodel started by a midwife that provides group care to\nwomen who are near the same due date (Centering Healthcare\nInstitute, n.d.). Program benefits include (a) support from the\ngroup, (b) more time for educating, (c) less waiting time at\nthe clinic, (d) enhanced relationships with their providers,\nand (e) improved rates of healthy practices (Klima, Norr,\nmodel was introduced in several clinics serving predomi-\nnantly Black populations. Despite concerns regarding less-\nened individual time with each mother, which might limit the\nmidwife's ability to address deeper issues with the women,\nthe results were overwhelmingly positive (Benatar, Garrett,\nTwo studies focused on the effect of CenteringPregnancy\ncare with adolescent to young women, primarily Black\nYoder and Hardy 5\nwere performed in urban hospitals that served low-income\nwomen. The women who experienced CenteringPregnancy\ncare attended more prenatal visits and were more involved in\ntheir care than those who used a standard model of prenatal\net al. (2015) purposely crafted groups composed of a range\nof ages, and one of the most interesting results of her study is\nthat women tended to be more engaged in groups that were\nmore diverse in age. Some additional benefits that\nCenteringPregnancy had among Trotman et al.'s (2015) ado-\nlescent population was an increase in breastfeeding, adequate\nweight gain, and use of birth control methods as compared\nwith teens who used a traditional prenatal care model.\nFour studies specifically compared the differences\nbetween midwife-led prenatal care and physician-led prena-\ntal care. One focus identified in these studies was the number\nof health topics reviewed during prenatal care sessions that\nwere not directly related to clinical care, such as nutrition,\nbreastfeeding, and family planning, and provider type.\nWomen participating in midwifery-led care reported discuss-\ning a higher number of health topics than those who received\nphysician-led care (Palmer et al., 2010; Vonderheid, Norr, &\nHandler, 2007). The comparison of health behavior out-\ncomes related to provider type was closely related. One study\nfailed to find an association between provider type and health\nbehaviors; however, patients who used CNMs did report\nmore encouragement to engage in healthy behavior than\npatients who were cared for by MDs (Vonderheid et al.,\n2007). These results contradicted the study on adolescent\nhealth behaviors that saw an increase in positive health\nbehaviors such as increased breastfeeding rates and adequate\nweight gain in the group of primarily Black adolescents\nreceiving midwifery care (Trotman et al., 2015). However,\nthis difference might be partially attributed to the difference\nin midwifery care models where Vonderheid et al. used a\nmore traditional midwifery one-on-one care model and\nTrotman et al. utilized the CenteringPregnancy model.\nTwo additional variables compared in studies that investi-\ngated midwife versus physician-led antenatal care were (a)\nthe variance in C-section and PTB rate based on provider type\nand (b) the length of time spent with provider during prenatal\nvisits. Women receiving prenatal care at a birthing center\nstaffed by midwives were less likely to have a C-section\ndeliver preterm than those who received standard prenatal\ncare at a hospital or clinic. A significant difference was noted\nin the average amount of patient/provider time spent in prena-\ntal care sessions. Centers utilizing CenteringPregnancy model\nhold, on average, 2-hr prenatal sessions with each group\n(Centering Healthcare Institute, n.d.). However, even among\nproviders who do not utilize CenteringPregnancy, a study in\nWashington, D.C., comparing average prenatal visit times\nbetween obstetricians at a clinic and CNMs at a birthing cen-\nter found that the length of time spent with the provider was\noften twice as long at the birthing center than at the clinics.\nFirst time visits at the birthing center could last nearly 2 hr,\nwhereas first time visits at the clinics ranged from 25 to 35\nmin. Follow-up visits at the birthing center ranged from 20 to\n90 min, depending on the need, whereas follow-up visits at\nFew of the studies focused on Black women's perception of\nmidwives; however, some address it in passing (Klima et al.,\nParticipants from a predominantly Black community who were\ninvolved in a study that evaluated the introduction of\nCenteringPregnancy in a public health clinic were asked what\nthey thought of the care. The women expressed that being\nheard and making friends in the group were positive aspects of\nCenteringPregnancy. Overall, there was an increased satisfac-\ntion in prenatal care with this particular midwifery model\n(Klima et al., 2009). Another woman voiced appreciation for\nthe personal interest and care that a CNM in a birthing center\nshowed her by personally calling to check up on her (Palmer\net al., 2010).Astudy that did specifically examine Black wom-\nen's preferences in provider care found that women described\nfeeling more in control and empowered when they used a mid-\nwife for prenatal care (Tucker Edmonds et al., 2015).\nDiscussion\nThis review notes that there are three principal areas of expe-\nrience that the literature covers regarding Black women's\nantenatal care. These are (a) care disparities, (b) perceptions\nof antenatal care, and (c) midwifery-led care.\nExamining the care disparities that have an impact on\nBlack women's antenatal care shows that there are many fac-\ntors beyond their control, such as discrimination and access\nto care. Discrimination is a particularly pervasive factor, as it\nis shown to be an issue both within the health care system\nand on a day-to-day basis. The stress of daily discrimination\nadds to the number of stressful life situations that Black\nwomen are already at a higher risk of facing, such as access\nto care and transportation issues. Stress is strongly correlated\nwith higher rates of alcohol and drug use, and the studies\nreviewed noted an increase in negative birth outcome for\nboth substance use and stressful life events. This historical\nconnection is not difficult to see in the case of discrimina-\ntion, particularly on a health care level. It was not until the\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 that federally funded hospitals were\nnot allowed to deny care based on race, ethnicity, or income\nlevel, and even then, segregation remained an issue\nwives were being phased out, there was significant stigma\nattached to being or receiving care from an \"uneducated\"\nmidwife, and it is very likely that there were some Black\nwomen who felt ashamed of the stigma involved with using\na midwife, and yet were excluded from care at hospitals. This\nfrustration associated with a lack of options may still color\nthe Black woman's perception of midwifery use today; how-\never, there is no research that addresses this question.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe limited information offered in these studies about\nBlack women's perceptions of antenatal care shows two pre-\ndominant themes of frustration, and desire for personalized,\nrespectful care. A frustration component, according to the\nClose et al. (2013) study, is that women do not always see\npositive birth effects even when they do attend prenatal care\nregularly. Participants cited discrimination and disrespectful\nencounters as deterrents to care. Unplanned pregnancies\nwere also a source of stress that could negatively affect Black\nwomen's perception of obtaining prenatal care. Some of\nthese frustrations could be addressed through meeting the\nprenatal care desires mentioned by participants, particularly\npersonalized care, continuity of provider, respect, and to be\nlistened to. These are desires of most women when it comes\nto health care; however, considering the history of discrimi-\nnatory health treatment that Black women faced in the not-\nso-distant past, it is sobering to realize that these basic needs\nfor respect often remain unmet. Overall, Black women's per-\nception of a desirable prenatal care experience coincides well\nwith midwifery-led care, which tends to be more personal-\nized and holistic. However, the percentage of Black women\nwho use midwives is only 12% of the total number of CNM/\nCM-attended live births in the United States (HealthData.\nThe studies addressing Black women's experience of\nantenatal care in relation to midwifery-led care focused\npredominantly on CenteringPregnancy, a midwifery model\nthat uses a group approach to care. Participants had mostly\npositive responses to this model, particularly the group\naspect. The sessions were longer, on average, than tradi-\ntional prenatal appointments, and there was more time for\nthe midwife to engage in patient teaching. Women specifi-\ncally mentioned feeling more in control and empowered in\nprenatal sessions with midwives. It appears that midwifery\ncould be a good method of care to offer Black women;\nhowever, there is not enough research on Black women's\nperception of the desirability of this option. The studies\nincluded in the review focused primarily on positive health\noutcomes because of implementing CenteringPregnancy or\nmidwifery-led care.\nA single study addressed the practice of Black midwives\ntoday. This study by Guerra-Reyes and Hamilton (2016),\nprovided valuable information despite many limitations.\nBlack midwives and doulas were noted to be focused on\nadvocacy. All of the Black midwives and doula websites that\nthe researchers found and analyzed included an advocacy-\nrelated arm--some focused solely on educating the public\nand lobbying for Black midwives, whereas others offered\ndoula or midwifery services as well. It was also noteworthy\nthat most of these midwives and doulas based inspiration for\ntheir practice on the history of the Black midwives. The limi-\ntations of this study suggest that some information was out-\ndated. There was also an inability to interact with the website\nowners and a potential exclusion of providers who did not\nhave websites, or whose websites were not picked up by the\nsearch engines. These limitations indicate an urgent need for\nmore research exploring the role of Black midwives today.\nMajor gaps in the literature noted in this review are (a)\nBlack women's perception of midwifery as an antenatal care\noption and (b) experience and practice of Black midwives\ntoday. A further geographical gap is a lack of studies looking\nat how Black women in the south view midwives and their\nrole in prenatal care. Most of the CenteringPregnancy studies\ntook place in the North.\nConclusion\nEpidemiological data clearly indicate the high propensity for\nadverse events associated with pregnancy in Black women.\nThe effect of stress, discrimination, and limited access to\ncare suggest implications of late or no prenatal care. There is\na paucity of literature surrounding Black women's experi-\nence of antenatal care. In the past 10 years, 18 studies were\nfound pertaining to this topic, and two were not included in\nthe analysis because they were secondary analyses of late\nmidwifery care directly, and one of the seven investigated the\nrole of Black midwives. Considering the long history of mid-\nwifery among Black women well into the 1960s, this gap in\nthe literature is significant.\nFurther research is essential to address the gaps related to\nthe antenatal needs of Black women and the perception that\nBlack women hold concerning midwifery as an option for\nantenatal care, particularly in the south. Examining the liter-\nature, it appears that midwifery has the potential to address\nthe lower prenatal care rates that Black women experience,\nas an option that is favorably considered, has good outcomes,\nand may better accommodate Black women's desires for pre-\nnatal care--attentive provider, continuity of care, and woman\nempowering. However, there has been no research investi-\ngating Black women's perceptions and desires surrounding\nchanges to the antenatal care available to them, or the role\nthat midwives might play; this is where the literature falls\nshort. The gap, as noted, is significant. Researchers must\nmeet, consult with, and listen to Black women and hear their\nstories to understand the significance of midwifery to them.\nOnly then, in partnership with, and based on suggestions for\nchange from Black women themselves, can health care pro-\nviders and researchers begin to make changes in the health\ncare system to facilitate improved antenatal care for Black\nwomen and their neonates.\n"
