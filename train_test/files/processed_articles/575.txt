    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground: Multimorbidity defined as the \"the coexistence of two or more chronic diseases\" in one individual, is\nincreasing in prevalence globally. The aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of multimorbidity across low\nand middle-income countries (LMICs), and to investigate patterns by age and education, as a proxy for socio-economic\nstatus (SES).\nMethods: Chronic disease data from 28 countries of the World Health Survey (2003) were extracted and inter-country\nsocio-economic differences were examined by gross domestic product (GDP). Regression analyses were applied to\nexamine associations of education with multimorbidity by region adjusted for age and sex distributions.\nResults: The mean world standardized multimorbidity prevalence for LMICs was 7.8 % (95 % CI, 7.79 % - 7.83 %). In all\ncountries, multimorbidity increased significantly with age. A positive but non\u00adlinear relationship was found between\ncountry GDP and multimorbidity prevalence. Trend analyses of multimorbidity by education suggest that there are\nintergenerational differences, with a more inverse education gradient for younger adults compared to older adults.\nHigher education was significantly associated with a decreased risk of multimorbidity in the all-region analyses.\nConclusions: Multimorbidity is a global phenomenon, not just affecting older adults in HICs. Policy makers worldwide\nneed to address these health inequalities, and support the complex service needs of a growing multimorbid population.\n",

Roderick1, Paul Kowal2,3, Borislav D. Dimitrov1 and Allan G. Hill4\n Keywords: Multimorbidity, Ageing, Health inequalities, Epidemiological transition, Adult health\nBackground\nThe theory of epidemiological transition is grounded on\nthe observed shift of disease burden from communicable\nto non-communicable disease (NCD) causes [1]. Whilst\nthe debate about the role of population ageing in epi-\ndemiological transition continues, the demographic tran-\nsition to older populations is also occurring across all\nregions, albeit with different patterns, determinants and\nrapidity. It has been shown that the ageing of popula-\ntions is ongoing in both developed and developing coun-\ntries although, the growth rate of older adults in low- and\nmiddle-income countries will remain significantly higher\nthan in most high-income countries (HICs) for many\ndecades [2]. Multimorbidity is usually defined as the pres-\nence of two or more chronic diseases within an individual\n[3]. Although chronic disease factors are considered\ndrivers of multimorbidity, the observed increase in multi-\nmorbidity is also related to both the demographic and epi-\ndemiologic transition. As the global population continues\nto grow in size, and becomes increasingly aged, there is an\nexpectant increase in multimorbidity prevalence. Tackling\nmultimorbidity as part of NCD burden remains one of the\nkey challenges faced by the global community. In particu-\nlar, health systems need to examine its socio-economic de-\nterminants in order to provide the most equitable health\ncare to their populations and to drive NCD prevention.\nDespite the growing recognition of the prevalence of\nmultimorbidity amongst older adults, global prevalence\nstudies have largely remained single-disease focused [4].\n1Academic Unit of Primary Care and Population Sciences, Faculty of\nMedicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital,\nTremona Road, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 2015 Afshar et al.

A study in Australia reported a\nmultimorbidity prevalence of approximately 4 % in adults\nin those aged 60 and older [8]. There are also contrasting\nassociations by age and sex. Multimorbidity in HICs is re-\nportedly more prevalent for individuals of higher ages, fe-\nmale sex, low income, and low education [9\u00ad11]. The\noutcomes of multimorbidity have been well documented in\nHICs, with multimorbidity being associated with reduced\nquality of life, decreased functional capacity, and reduced\nsurvival [12\u00ad14]. Studies have also shown the burden of\nmultimorbidity and its relation to rising healthcare utilisa-\ntion, cost and expenditure [15, 16]. A comparison of the\nrelationship between multimorbidity and socio-economic\nstatus (SES) show contrasting results for high, middle and\nlow income countries. In Scotland, a high income country,\nmultimorbidity has been found to be associated with lower\nSES [17]. In Bangladesh, a low income country - however,\nthe wealthiest quintile of the population had an increased\nprevalence of multimorbidity [18]. And in studies examin-\ning its association with education, multimorbidity was\nmore prevalent in those with lower educational levels in\nCanada (a HIC) [11]; while multimorbidity was less com-\nmon among educated and employed persons in South\nAfrica (an upper-middle income country) [19].\nThere have been no studies examining the age and so-\ncioeconomic distribution of multimorbidity (MM) in\nLMICs. The present study aims to establish the prevalence\nof MM in a range of LMICs, and to examine the varia-\ntions of MM by age and education (as a proxy for SES).\nMethods\nStudy samples\nPublically available data from the WHO World Health\nSurvey (WHS) was used, which is publicly available from\nthe WHO. The World Health Surveys consists of cross-\nsectional national studies, each of which follow a multi-\nstage clustering design to draw nationally representative\nsamples of adults aged 18 years and older. The details of\nthe survey procedures are described elsewhere [20, 21].\nSeventy-one countries participated in the WHS between\ndepending on feasibility and cost. Individual participants\naged 18 years or above were randomly selected for inter-\nview. All surveys were implemented as face-to-face in-\nterviews; except for two countries, which used phone\nand mail-in interviews.\nOf the seventy-one countries that participated in the\nWHS, eighteen countries were excluded from the analyses,\nas they did not complete the long version of the question-\nnaire covering chronic condition status; these were mostly\ncountries from Western Europe. Countries were also ex-\ncluded if the response rate to the chronic health questions\nwas less than 90 % (eleven countries) or if they did not in-\nclude post-stratification weights (six countries). A mini-\nmum of four countries were randomly selected from each\nregion for further analysis, resulting in a total of twenty-\neight of the remaining thirty-seven countries. Since the re-\nsearch questions aimed to address the differences between\nLMICs the majority of countries sampled were LMICs.\nDue to low response rates in certain regions, such as\nAfrica, countries from Eastern Europe & Central Asia were\noversampled. We included one high income countries for\ncomparison. In total, six countries were randomly selected\nfrom Africa; five countries from South-East Asia; four from\nSouth Asia; eight from Eastern Europe & Central Asia; four\nfrom Central & South America; and, one from Western\nEurope. Sampling weights were applied, as well as post-\nstratification weights to account for non-response.\nMeasures and variables\nIn the WHS, chronic disease morbidity was defined by\nself-report, based on a set of six doctor diagnosed condi-\ntions. The self-reported conditions were assessed based\non responses to the question, \"Have you ever been diag-\nnosed with...?\" Previous studies have used different oper-\national definitions of multimorbidity. Methodological\ndifferences, such as the number of chronic conditions to\ninclude in the count, result in a wide variability in preva-\nlence estimates [7]. To prevent further discordance, mul-\ntimorbidity is defined here as the presence of two or\nmore chronic diseases, which is the most commonly\nused definition in prevalence studies [22]. A binary vari-\nable for multimorbidity was created on the presence of\ntwo or more of the six conditions: arthritis, angina or\nangina pectoris (a heart disease), asthma, depression,\nschizophrenia or psychosis, and diabetes.\nThe individual level socio-demographic variables of\ninterest were age, sex and highest level of education\ncompleted. The residence of the individual, defined as\nliving in either an `urban' or `rural' area, was also used in\nthe description of the country characteristics. Two dif-\nferent age groupings were generated for different ana-\nlyses: first, three age groupings for those 18\u00ad49 years,\n55 years or older. The former was done to examine\nstratum specific differences, and the latter to examine\ngenerational differences. To examine generational differ-\nences, 55 years was taken as a cut point, representing a\nmid-way point within the WHS study population.\nLevel of education was used as a measure of country-\nlevel socioeconomic status (SES). `Highest education level\nobtained' was collapsed from seven to four categories: (1)\nuniversity or any higher education; (2) secondary school;\n(3) primary school; and, (4) less than primary school (in-\ncluding no formal education).\nInter-country socioeconomic differences were examined\nby using country estimates for GDP per capita. These\nwere obtained from the United Nations Statistical Division\nrecords for 2003. Countries were then grouped according\nto the cut-offs for low- middle- and high-income based on\nStatistical analysis\nSurvey estimates were used to calculate prevalence mea-\nsures and extract nationally representative samples, ac-\ncounting for non-response. To obtain valid comparisons\nacross the countries, age-standardised multimorbidity\nprevalence rates were calculated using the direct method\nFor the descriptive analyses, mean percentages were\ntaken as an average across populations and normality of\nthe distributions was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test.\nWe used non-parametric regression to produce a line of\nbest fit, when comparing national estimates of multimor-\nbidity with GDP. Individual countries were weighted by\nthe survey size to produce regional estimates for com-\nparisons of multimorbidity by age and education. Signifi-\ncance testing of the comparisons among independent\nsamples was done by t-test or ANOVA while for those\nwhose distributions deviated from the normal one - by\nthe Wilcoxon rank-sum (for two variables) and\nTable 1 Sample size, age, sex and urban/rural distributions for the selected World Health Survey Countries\nWHS Countries (n = 28) N Sample Age category, % Sex, % Residence, % National\nincomea\naMIC Middle income country, LIC Low income country.

Univariable models were\nfitted to analyse the association of both sex and age\nwith multimorbidity. For the multivariable analyses,\ndata were pooled at regional level. A random effects lo-\ngistic regression model was fitted for the regional ana-\nlysis, to account for the hierarchical nature of the data\nwithin countries and regions.

Confidence intervals have been calculated based on\nrecommendations for crude and age-specific rates [25].\nResults\nIndividual country characteristics are described in Table 1.\nSocio-demographic characteristics, including age and sex\ndistributions are shown. Population age structures differed\nacross the countries (p < 0.05), with a mean percentage\n18\u00ad49. Age-standardisation of rates were calculated to\naccount for these population distribution differences.\nThe mean percentage of those living in rural areas was\nwas not significant.

However,\nthere was still a distinct negative gradient in Western\nEurope, with the highest burden on the least educated.\nSouth-East Asia on the other hand has a positive gradient,\nwith the highest burden on the most educated.\nBoth univariable and multivariable analyses are shown\nin Tables 3 and 4.

Sex was significantly associated with multi-\nmorbidity in all but seven countries. Multimorbidity was\nassociated with education in the univariable analyses,\nbut was not significant when adjusted for both age and\nsex, except for certain education categories in\nBangladesh, Brazil, Hungary, Mauritius, Namibia and\nSpain; which were all consistent with an inverse\nrelationship.\nSimilar to the country level, age and sex were both sig-\nnificantly associated with multimorbidity in all regions\n(Table 4). When adjusted for age and sex, the lowest\neducation category was significantly associated with a\nhigher risk of multimorbidity in Africa and Western\nEurope; and higher education categories were signifi-\ncantly associated with a decreased risk of multimorbidity\nin South Asia and Western Europe. Adjusted for age,\nsex, country and region, the `all region' model suggests\nan overall negative education gradient.\nDiscussion\nThe subject of multimorbidity is of growing interest, in\npart, due to the ageing of all populations. Internationally,\nthere is still limited evidence on the prevalence and\nsocial determinants of multimorbidity, particularly in\nLMICs. This is the first study to describe global patterns\nof multimorbidity and to compare prevalence across\ndifferent countries including LMICs. There are a few\nnotable findings. Firstly, despite the variation in multi-\nmorbidity prevalence the mean world standard preva-\nin LMICs the multimorbidity prevalence was quite\nhigh. Secondly, multimorbidity prevalence was posi-\ntively associated with country GDP per capita. There\nwas however a non-linear relationship; our one HIC -\nSpain had a low multimorbidity relative to per capita\nGDP. These results suggest an influence of other factors\nwhich may include, but are not limited to, more freedom\nto make better lifestyle choices and better social condi-\ntions [26]. In comparison to Spain, the Eastern European\ncountries have relatively high multimorbidity preva-\nlence. Historically, Eastern Europe has had poorer\npopulation health outcomes relative to their western\ncounterparts following the fall of communism in 1990.\nSuch health outcomes were markedly influenced by ex-\nposure to risk factors, such as tobacco smoking and al-\ncohol consumption [27\u00ad29]. Thirdly, multimorbidity\nFig. 2 a: The socioeconomic gradient of multimorbidity by regions, for age category 1 (<55). b: The socioeconomic gradient of multimorbidity by\nregions, for age category 2 (55). The lightest shade represents the first category (higher education achieved). The darkest shade represents final\ncategory (less than primary school education achieved). Multimorbidity prevalence ratios are based on the prevalence of multimorbidity in the\nthird category, set at 1\nwas significantly associated with age across all countries\nincluding LMICs. This finding has been found consist-\nmultimorbidity as defined here, is also not limited to\nolder adults, but affects younger adults in LMICs. This\nassociation of multimorbidity with age, however, might\nreflect the type of condition included in the disease\ncount and their age of onset [35]. Fifthly, trend analyses\nof multimorbidity and education suggest a transgenera-\ntional difference: with a transition to a more negative\neducation gradient is observed for younger adults com-\npared to older adults in LMICs. Our `all region' model\nalso suggests an inverse relationship between multimor-\nbidity and education. These findings are consistent with\nwhat has been found in other studies in HICs [17, 32].\nFinally, there are notable gender differences in multi-\nmorbidity: the female sex being associated with higher\nmultimorbidity. This is a common observation in mor-\nbidity studies, often attributed to greater use of health\nservices and disease diagnosis [33]. Though other\nstudies also suggest the role of other factors, including\nbehavioural and psychosocial [34, 36]. Other studies\nsuggest that clustering patterns of multimorbidity differ\nfor male and females; for example, the cardiometabolic\ncluster was reportedly more common in males. This\noccurrence could be due to known differences in physi-\nology, such as the protective effect of female hormones\nTable 3 Effect of age, sex and education on multimorbidity by country: Odds ratios in univariable, multivariable analysis\nAge (OR) 18\u00ad49 as reference Sex (OR) Male\nas reference\nEducation (OR) primary school as reference Education (AOR)\n50 - 64 65+ < primary Secondary higher < primary secondary higher\n*p-value *** < 0.05; ** < 0.01; * <0.001; (OR) Unadjusted odds ratio; (AOR) Adjusted odds ratios in multivariable analysis: all countries adjusted for age and sex.\n$ indicates no observations within the category. For Bosnia & Herzegovina the categories of secondary and higher education were combined for both univariable\nand multivariable analyses\nOne of the study aims was to examine the variations\nof multimorbidity by SES here with education as a\nproxy. Our descriptive analyses of education show that\nboth regional differences and generational differences\nexist for adults with multimorbidity. In Western Europe\nand Eastern Europe & Central Asia, there was wider\nvariation in prevalence ratios between SES categories,\ncompared to other regions. And for adults aged\n<55 years, the gradient was always negative, with one ex-\nception of older adults in South-East Asia. This suggests\nthat in South-East Asia there might have been an inter-\ngenerational reversal in the socioeconomic gradient of\nmultimorbidity. Such results have also been found in\nstudies on obesity where transitional economies are ex-\nperiencing a reversal in socioeconomic gradient thus\nresulting in a similar gradient to HICs [38].\nThe global-level multivariable analyses show a negative\nassociation of multimorbidity with education. Results\nfrom Western Europe (Spain) suggest a significantly\nnegative education gradient of multimorbidity in HICs.\nIn Africa, there is also a significantly negative education\ngradient in multimorbidity. The education gradient in\nAfrica, despite most countries in this region being\nLMICs, is similar to the Western Europe region. These\nresults are contrary to the Bangladesh study, which sam-\npled 850 individuals (60 years and above) in a rural area\nand reported a direct association of multimorbidity with\nSES [18]. The SES index in their study, however, was\nbased on household assets. Alternative measures of SES\nmay lead to different results. One study in rural Uganda\nreports maternal education to be a better predictor of\nhealth; whereas other studies explore the use of perman-\nStrengths and limitations\nThis study provides novel data on multimorbidity preva-\nlence in nationally representative population samples using\na consistent set of methods measures across multiple\ncountries. Being the first of its kind, one of its major\nstrengths is the availability and comparability of the data\nacross all a wide range of countries using the World Health\nSurveys which were developed for this reason.\nThe study has few limitations which, even if not\nundermining its contributions and potential impact,\nshould be also mentioned. Firstly, prevalence estimates\nwere based on a limited set of conditions [7]. The\nchronic conditions included in the WHS were chosen to\nreflect health system coverage [41]. The conditions had\nto be amenable to self-report and reflect a known bur-\nden or prevalence globally. The choice of conditions\nshould correspond to those with greater prevalence in\nolder populations (prevalence for asthma, for instance,\nis more typically higher in older children and younger\nadulthood). Secondly, the study presents cross-\nsectional data from 2003. Further investigations should\nuse current or recent data, as well as longitudinal data,\nto ascertain changing patterns over time. Thirdly, only\ncountries with a greater than 90 % response rate to\nhealth status questions on chronic disease were sam-\npled, which meant that a number of lower income\ncountries, where response rates were low, were ex-\ncluded from the analyses. There was also low represen-\ntation from HICs, as these countries largely did not\ncomplete the chronic disease questions. As such the\nuse of Spain only \u00ad to represent Western Europe \u00ad\nwas a limitation. Fourthly, these results were based on\nself-reported measures, which may result in disease\nunderreporting and potential bias [42\u00ad44]. One study\nnotes that self-reporting leads to underreporting, par-\nticularly amongst the poor, which dampen the gradi-\nents [45]. It may be that health literacy and service\naccess impact prevalence based on self-report for\ncountries at different levels of economic development.\nSelf-reported diagnosis can be further validated by\nTable 4 Effect of age, sex and socioeconomic status on multimorbidity: Odds ratios in univariable, multivariable analysis using a\nrandom effects model\nUnivariable Multivariable\nAge (OR) Sex (OR) Education (OR) Education (AOR)$\n<55 years as reference Male as reference primary school as reference\n55 <primary secondary higher < primary secondary higher\np-value *** <0.05; ** < 0.01; * <0.001; $Regional multivariable analyses adjusted for age, sex and country; (OR) Unadjusted odds ratio; (AOR) Adjusted odds ratios in\nmultivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex and country\nauxiliary symptom-reporting questions included in the\nsurvey, such as the Rose questionnaire used for angina,\nor through clinical assessment [46]. National GDP is\ngenerally correlated with healthcare system investment\nand potentially healthcare access, which might affect\nthe interpretation of the results. Spain, however, had\nlow multimorbidity relative to national GDP despite\nhaving a relatively good healthcare system access. In\norder to understand the relationship between a coun-\ntry's development and multimorbidity as an appropri-\nate health outcome, further studies are needed: with a\nfuller accounting of confounding, modifying and medi-\nating elements. Finally the use of education as a proxy\nfor SES has been debated despite its wide use in popu-\nlation health research [47, 48]. There is evidence to\nsuggest that after conditioning for the effect of socio-\neconomic status, measured by household income or\nassets, education has an independent and substantial\neffect on health outcomes [49].\nConclusion\nMultimorbidity is common in LMICs and significantly\nassociated with age. There is an inverse country associ-\nation of multimorbidity with education, which indicates\nan inequity of disease burden. The negative gradient of\nmultimorbidity with education is already occurring and\nmore marked in the younger generation. It may reflect\nthe proliferation of several key risk factors for these\nchronic conditions including unhealthy behaviours. The\nrecent UN World Summit addressed the common risk\nfactors of NCDs to be tackled with urgent priority;\nnamely tobacco use, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alco-\nhol and physical inactivity [50]. Weak health systems\nand governance will not be able to support the care\nneeds resulting from the complexities of a multimorbid\npopulation. Better coordination and support through in-\nformed policy and planning of health care systems is\nneeded to support the transition required for health sys-\ntems to address future care needs. Furthermore, there is\na need to increase activities and expand measures to re-\nduce the modifiable risk factors that are driving multi-\nmorbidity prevalence.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Shows the crude morbidity prevalence of chronic\ndisease by country and region.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they do not have competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nSA has made significant contributions through the conception, data analysis,\ninterpretation and drafting of the manuscript.
