But what about the\nvately owned in the United States already?3 Is\nthe risk of homicide in the home associated\nwith how guns are kept?\nSurvey data published by the National\nCenter for Health Statistics (NCHS) portend\nan answer. The National Mortality Followback\nSurvey (NMFS) interviews proxy respondents\nand gathers detailed information about US\ndecedents, including homicide victims.4 The\nmost recent (1993) NMFS asked if there were\nguns in the victim's home and how they were\nkept (for example, loaded, disassembled).\nNearly identical questions were asked the fol-\nlowing year in the National Health Interview\nSurvey (NHIS), which yielded data about how\nliving people keep their guns.5\nWe used the data to assess if the risk of\nbeing killed in one's home (homicide) was\nassociated with how the firearms were kept.\nQuestion wording prevented full use of the\ndata. People who reported that multiple guns\nwere present were asked one set of questions;\nthe wording makes it unclear how a particular\ngun was kept. People reporting a single gun\nwere asked different questions; these data are\nmore tractable. Among the latter individuals,\n14% of the living subjects and 58% of the\nhomicide victims kept the gun in a non-\nrecommended manner (that is, unlocked and\nloaded or with ammunition). Unfortunately,\nthe relative risk for people with multiple guns\nin their homes (about 75% of the US\nhouseholds that contain guns3) cannot be\ndetermined.\nAdditional data are needed. One source is\nthe 1998 NHIS, which asked revised firearm\nquestions. We hope the NMFS is revised and\nreadministered as well.\nAsking people about guns, doing it quickly\nand concisely, and eliciting accurate infor-\nmation is a challenge. We are encouraged by\nthe NCHS's commitment to include firearm\nquestions on their already lengthy surveys.\nThe firearm section is key, providing infor-\nmation by which to address important re-\nsearch questions.\nD J Wiebe, S B Sorenson\nViolence Prevention Research Group, Department of\nCommunity Health Sciences, UCLA School of Public\nHealth, 650 C E Young Drive South, Los Angeles,\nReferences\n1 Kellermann AL, Rivara FP, Rushforth NB, et\nal.

Ann Arbor, MI:\nInter-university Consortium for Political and\nPatterns of violence in Karachi,\nPakistan\nI welcome the paper by Chotani et al on\nviolence in Pakistan and the empirical nature\nof the exploration.1 It is also encouraging to\nsee Injury Prevention raise the issue of violence\nin developing countries, as it is a neglected\nhealth problem. However, from the Pakistani\ncontext, there are several contextual and\nexplanatory points that are needed to clarify\nsome of the issues raised in the paper and also\nto add to them.\n1. Macroeconomic changes have affected\nPakistani society for the past two decades\nwith important impacts on the health and\nsocial sectors.2 One of the impacts is on the\nlevels of violence and unintentional injuries--\ntrends that have not been appropriately stud-\nied in the developing world. The impact of\nadjustment programs like the Social Action\nProgram in Pakistan therefore merit discus-\nsion in a dialogue exploring the nature and\npatterns of violence.\n2. I disagree with the claim made in the\npaper that there have been no comparisons of\npolice data with other data sources in\nPakistan. National burden of disease analysis\nfor Pakistan included all types of injuries and\nused such a comparative analysis.3 Moreover,\ninnovative sources of data have also been\ncompared to police data on violence in the\nliterature.4 Indeed more work needs to be\ndone in this area to enhance the internal con-\nsistency of data from Pakistan--a research\nagenda for the country.\n3. I was surprised to note the lack of atten-\ntion to the role of firearms in the discussion\nand prevention part of the paper. The influx of\nfirearms since the eighties, the relationship\nwith substance abuse, and the drug trade are\nimportant considerations for exploring vio-\nlence in Pakistan. There are major economic\nrelationships between these factors and all of\nthem facilitate and potentiate the occurrence\nand impact of violence in the country, includ-\ning political and ethnic violence. Most impor-\ntantly, the control of firearms and their use is\na potential preventive strategy which needs to\nbe explored in the Pakistani context.\n4. Although not the intent of the study, it is\nworth reflecting that there are enormous\ncosts to violence everywhere. In addition to\nthe direct and indirect medical and treatment\ncosts to those injured or dead, there are\nsocietal costs in the form of preventive, reha-\nbilitative, structural, and quality of life factors.\nIf such an assessment was to be done in Kara-\nchi, I am sure one could attribute a large cost\namount to violence. We must begin to use\neconomic arguments as well, to enhance the\ncase for greater attention to violence in the\ndeveloping world.\nAs suggested by the authors, it is time to\nanalyze the causes and consequences of\nviolence in Pakistan systematically. The use of\nevidence in doing such analysis is critical; the\ndevelopment of a framework to link the\ndifferent causative and impact pathways is\nvital; and finally the ability to mobilize\nPakistani society to reject such violence and\ndevelop their own capacity for preventing it, is\nprobably the most important.\nA A Hyder\nDepartment of International Health, Bloomberg\nSchool of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University,\nReferences\n1 Chotani HA, Razzak JA, Luby SP.

We devel-\noped, piloted, and revised a survey instrument\nand emailed it to all daily newspaper editors\nin Iowa (n=33). One week later, we re-\nemailed each of the editors attaching the sur-\nvey and restating its purpose. A total of four\nsurveys and reminders were sent by both post\nand email. However, only seven editors (21%)\nresponded--all indicating a lack of interest in\ninjury control. As a result, we telephoned the\nremaining editors, leaving a minimum of four\nmessages. We were able to contact only eight\nand none of these eight desired to complete\nthe survey. Not only did the editors lack inter-\nest in the survey, some exhibited strongly\nnegative attitudes to injury control.\nThis experience suggests several conclu-\nsions. First, injury prevention is certainly not\na priority. Second, the editors expressed little\ninterest in learning about injury control. The\nexceptions were those with personal relation-\nships with injury control personnel. Working\nwith the media is an area that needs to be\nimproved by injury control professionals.\nThird, if injury control is to remain in the\nnewspapers, there may be a need to focus\nmore on the use of paid advertisements/\neditorials to reach the reader.\nJ B Lowe\nDepartment of Community and Behavioral Health,\nIowa Injury Prevention Research Center, 2850\nSteindler Building, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA\n"
