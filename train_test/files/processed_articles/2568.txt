Sbarra*\nObjective: Low levels of perceived social integration, or loneliness, are associated with increased risk\nfor a range of poor health outcomes. Sleep disturbance plays a central role in the evolutionary theory of\nloneliness, which provides a mechanistic account of how low levels of social integration may negatively\nimpact health. No studies, however, have examined whether the association between social integration\nand sleep disturbance is consistent with a causal effect after accounting for genes that are common to\nboth variables.\nMethod: Using twin data (N = 905 twin pairs) from the nationally-representative Midlife in the United\nStates (MIDUS) survey, I evaluated a series of bivariate twin models exploring whether the phenotypic asso-\nciation between low social integration and sleep disturbance can be explained by shared genetics. In addi-\ntion, the current study specified a series of quantitative models for studying gene x environment (G X E)\ninteractions to determine whether the genetic and environmental influences on sleep disturbance differ\nas a function of social integration.\nResults: The phenotypic association between social integration and sleep disturbance was fully accounted\nfor by genes that are common between the two variables, suggesting that within-twin pair differences\nin social integration do not exert a causal influence on sleep disturbance. Social integration, however,\nmoderated the non-shared environmental influence on sleep disturbances, with the greatest environmental\ninfluences observed at the lowest levels of social integration.\nConclusions: The results of this study suggest that an essential feature of the evolutionary model of\nloneliness may need refinement or elaboration. The moderation findings are discussed in terms of the fit\nwith a stress-buffering model of social support in which environmental influences on sleep disturbance are\nstrongest when social resources are low.\nKeywords: Social integration; loneliness; sleep; sleep disturbance; behavior genetics; twins\n* Department of Psychology, University of Arizona, Tucson,\nsbarra@email.arizona.edu\nSbarra: Genetics, Social Integration & Sleep\ntwins in a family (C), and those that are unique to each\ntwin (E, which also includes measurement error).\nIn a bivariate specification, this ACE model allows us\nto examine whether within-pair differences in a predic-\ntor variable--for example, loneliness--are associated with\ndifferences in an outcome of interest. Using twin data\nfrom the nationally-representative Midlife in the United\nStates (MIDUS) study, for example, Fujiwara and Kawachi\n[6] found the associations among perceived social inte-\ngration and perceived physical or mental health were\nnot consistent with a direct causal influence from social\nintegration to either of the (self-reported) outcomes. This\nfinding suggests that reducing loneliness (or, improving\nsocial integration) would not lead to improvements in\nself-rated physical or mental health; conceptually, another\nway of understanding these findings would be to consider\na hypothetical twin pair: Twin A's loneliness would predict\nTwin B's health just as well as Twin B's loneliness, and this\ntype of effect is not consistent with a causal effect from\nloneliness to health. Using twin models to interrogate\nquestions of causality has direct implications for interven-\ntion science. If treatment and other public health efforts\nattempt to alter loneliness in order to improve or promote\nhealth (cf. [10]), this work should proceed by targeting\npotential mechanisms of action that are consistent with\na causal link from loneliness to an outcome of interest. In\nthis respect, the twin models I report on in this paper are\na useful tool for identifying these potentially causal links\nand, perhaps more importantly, may be used to determine\nthat the association between loneliness or social inte-\ngration and another variable is inconsistent with a direct\ncausal effect.\nThe current report extends this prior analysis in two\nways. First, although Fujiwara and Kawachi [6] found no\nevidence for a causal link between perceived social inte-\ngration and health, it is plausible that the epidemiologi-\ncal association exists via indirect effects, with loneliness\nexerting a causal influence an intermediate variable,\nwhich then exerts a causal effect on a health outcome\nof interest (i.e., the direct association between loneliness\nand health may not be causal, but loneliness may exert a\ncausal effect on an intermediate variable that is causally\nrelated to a health outcome). From this perspective, sleep\nquality is an important candidate intermediate variable.\nNot only are sleep disturbances associated with a range\nof morbidities and risk for early death [11], but sleep\nplays an important role in the evolutionary theory of\nloneliness [12, 13]. The theory holds that over the course\nof evolutionary history being on the social periphery\nincreased the likelihood of predation; loneliness func-\ntions in part as a social alarm system alerting people to\ntheir status within a group and the need to reconnect\nwith others for safety. Although it is adaptive for lonely\npeople to maintain vigilance for signs of environmental\nthreat, over time this vigilance comes with a negative\ncost to one's health (cf. [14]).\nWithin this framework, sleep disturbances are an\nexpectable form of hypervigilance, and many stud-\nies find that lonely people evidence considerable sleep\ndifficulties, ranging from reports of daytime fatigue [3, 15]\nto objectively measured sleep fragmentation [16].\nImportantly, recent genetically-informed studies reveal\nthat the associations between sleep duration and both\nbody mass and depressed mood are consistent with a\ncausal influence from sleep to these outcomes of inter-\nest [17, 18]. Given the importance of sleep for understand-\ning the evolutionary significance of the loneliness-health\nassociation, I examine the potential etiology of the asso-\nciation between perceived social integration and self-\nreported sleep disturbances using data from the MIDUS\ntwin sample. The main goal of this paper is to investigate\nwhether within-pair differences in social integration (i.e.,\nwhen one twin reports being more socially integrated\nthan his or her cotwin) are associated with sleep distur-\nbances once genetic influences that are common to both\nvariables are taken into account.\nThe main analytic strategy of this paper is to examine\nwhether social integration is associated with sleep distur-\nbance in a manner consistent with a causal explanation;\nhowever, another way to explore the association between\nthese variables is to conceptualize social integration as an\n\"environmental context\" that can shape the genetic and\nenvironmental influences on sleep disturbance (cf. [19]).\nTo understand social integration as an environmental con-\ntext, I offer two competing hypotheses. First, consistent\nwith a general diathesis-stress model, the genetic contri-\nbutions to sleep disturbance may be strongest at low lev-\nels of self-reported social integration (i.e., high loneliness).\nIn this case, low social integration would provide a con-\ntext for revealing genetic liabilities to sleep disturbance.\nAlternatively, consistent with a stress-buffering model of\nsocial support (see [20, 21]), environmental influences on\nsleep disturbance may be strongest at the lowest levels of\nsocial integration. In this case, low levels of social integra-\ntion would provide a context in which the environmental\ninfluences on sleep disturbance are the strongest; alter-\nnatively, a putatively positive environmental context (i.e.,\nhigh social integration) would protect against stressful\nenvironmental influences on sleep disturbance.\nTesting these competing ideas involves incorporating\na statistical interaction into the standard biometric twin\nmodel to determine whether the genetic and environ-\nmental influences on sleep disturbance differ as a func-\ntion of social integration. Biometric moderation analyses\n[22] are receiving increased attention in psychological\nresearchers to study quantitative gene-environment\ninteraction(s) in the context of gene-environment cor-\nrelation (i.e., in situations where common genetics can\nexplain part of the association between predictor and\noutcome variables). This approach holds promise for\nexpanding the evolutionary theory of loneliness. If low\nlevels of perceived social integration increase the genetic\ncontribution to sleep disturbance, we observe another\nroute through which loneliness, as an environmental\nexposure (highly heritable in-and-of itself, see [26]) may\nshape the genetic contributions to an important health-\nrelevant variable like sleep.\nSbarra: Genetics, Social Integration & Sleep Art.3, page3 of 10\nThe Present Study\nUsing the twin subsample from the MIDUS study, this\npaper investigated two primary research questions.\nFirst, consistent with a quasi-causal association (see [9]),\nI expected the non-shared environmental component of\nsocial integration to be significantly associated with sleep\ndisturbances after accounting for genetic influences that\nare common to both low social integration and high lev-\nels of sleep disturbance. Second, in the context of this\nenvironmental main effect, I also explored the possibility\nthat social integration moderates the genetic and envi-\nronmental influences on sleep disturbance; regarding\nthese moderation analyses, I did not have a strong a priori\nhypothesis. On one hand, consistent with a diathesis-\nstress model, the largest heritability in sleep disturbance\nmay be observed among people who report low levels of\nsocial integration. On the other hand, consistent with a\nstress-buffering model, the environmental influences--\nthe so-called slings and arrows of life--may exert their\nstrongest influences on sleep disturbance when perceived\nsocial integration is low. Thus, the moderation analyses\nwere largely exploratory, but they were informed by these\ncompeting ideas about how social integration may differ-\nentially shape the genetic and environmental influences\non sleep disturbance.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants contributing to the current analyses were\npart of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey\ntwin sample. The MIDUS survey is a nationally representa-\ntive random-digit-dial sample of noninstitutionalized,\nEnglish-speaking adults aged 25\u00ad74 in the United States;\nthe first wave of the MIDUS survey included 7,108 par-\nyears old (SD = 13 years) when the initial phone interview\nof 921 pairs. As reported in detail elsewhere (e.g., [24]),\nzygosity was assessed via self-report using questions about\neye and hair color, as well as the degree to which people\nwere confused as to the twin's identity in childhood. This\napproach is valid and widely used [27], but 16 of the\nMIDUS twin pairs were deemed to have indeterminate\nzygosity and were excluded from the present analysis. The\nand 236 opposite sex DZ pairs. The average age of the\nparticipants provided informed consent, and the MIDUS\nstudy was approved by the institutional review boards at\neach data collection site. The author's local institutional\nreview board does not consider de-identified secondary\ndata analysis to be human subjects research.\nMeasures\nSocial integration. Social integration was assessed as\npart of the MIDUS survey's self-administered question-\nnaire. Three items, scored on a 7-point Likert-type scale\nfrom \"Strongly Agree\" to \"Strongly Disagree,\" were used\nto compute a composite index. The items tapping percep-\ntions of social integration were as follows: \"I don't feel I\nbelong to anything I'd call a community,\" \"I feel close to\nother people in my community,\" and, \"My community is a\nsource of comfort.\" The composite index was scaled such\nthat high scores reflected a greater sense of social integra-\ntion. The scale has adequate internal consistency ( = .73)\nand has demonstrated construct validity [28, 29].\nSleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance was assessed\nwith a single item in the self-administered questionnaire:\n\"During the past 30 days, how often have you experienced\ntrouble getting to sleep or staying asleep?\" The sleep dis-\nturbance item was scored on a 6-point Likert-type scale\nfrom \"Almost every day\" to \"Not at all.\" For the present\nstudy, the items were reverse-scored with higher scores\nreflecting greater sleep disturbance. The mean sleep dis-\nthat, on average, the participants in this study reported\nsleep disturbances slightly more one time in the past 30\ndays. Single item assessments are not the most valid meas-\nures of self-reported sleep disturbance; the most well-val-\nidated self-report measure in this area is the Pittsburgh\nSleep Quality Index (PSQI; [30]). Although the original\nMIDUS Survey (used in this report) did not include the\nPSQI, the MIDUS Biomarker Project, completed roughly\n10 years after the original MIDUS Survey, included the\nPSQI. The single item sleep disturbance measure (used in\nthis report) from the MIDUS survey was correlated r = .37\nmeasure of overall sleep quality in the prior month, in the\nBiomarker Project. This test-retest stability over a 10-year\nperiod suggests the sleep disturbance item used in this\nsample is reliable and correlated with the gold-standard\nassessment for self-reported sleep disturbance up to a dec-\nade later.\nData Analysis\nAll data and computer codes associated with this paper\nare available online at the Open Science Framework por-\ntal and can be accessed at the following hyperlink: osf.\nio/utqrz. I analyzed the data beginning first with a bio-\nmetric structural equation model (using Mplus, [31]) that\nexamined the potential quasi-causal association between\nsocial integration and sleep disturbance. The model is\ndescribed in detail elsewhere (see [9]) but its essential\nfeature involves making use of the twin methodology\nto decompose the genetic and environmental influences\nthat are common between the two variables. Following\nstandard conventions for these models, I first residualized\nthe social integration and sleep variables for both age and\nsex, then standardized the residual variables for use in the\nbiometric models. I estimated how much of the variance\nin each trait is due to additive genetic influences (A), com-\nmon environmental influences (C), and unique environ-\nmental influences (E). This bivariate ACE specification is\nshown in Figure 1. The ACE variance components were\nstandardized and the paths from the components to the\nphenotypes were estimated; the specification outlined in\nSbarra: Genetics, Social Integration & Sleep\nFigure 1 decomposes the variance of each variable into\nthe ACE components and examines the variance shared\nbetween the two variables. To examine the potential quasi-\ncausal effect, I regressed the sleep disturbance item on the\nACE components of social integration. The key parameter\nof interest in this analysis is the regression of the sleep dis-\nturbance item on the E component of social integration\nafter accounting for genetic influences that are common\nto the two phenotypes.\nThe second set of analyses focused on the potential mod-\neration of the genetic components of sleep disturbance as\na function of social integration. This biometric modera-\ntion [23] involves extending the bivariate twin model to\ninclude an interaction term as illustrated in Figure 2. This\nextension allows the cross-paths and residual genetic and\nenvironmental influences on sleep disturbance to vary\nas a function of social integration. I examined goodness\nof fit using the root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA; [32]), where values below .05 are considered a\nclose fit and values up to .08 represent reasonable approx-\nimations of the data. I also reported the comparative fit\nfit, as well as the likelihood-ratio test (distributed as a 2\nand calculated as the difference in the \u00ad2 log-likelihood\nvalues between the two models), which can be used to test\ndifferences between nested models that add or remove\nspecific parameters.\nResults\nPerceived social integration was negatively associated\nwith self-reported sleep disturbances (r = -.14, 95% CI\n[-.24, -.09]). The within-trait and cross-trait twin corre-\nlations for social integration and sleep disturbance are\npresented in Table 1. As shown, the substantially larger\nMZ than DZ within-trait, cross-twin correlations are con-\nsistent with a genetic contribution to the variance in both\nFigure 1: Structural equation model of social integration and sleep disturbance in adult twin pairs.

The cross-trait, cross-twin correlations, however,\napproximate the individual-level phenotypic correlation\npresented above, which suggests that the genetic influ-\nences on social integration may account for the associa-\ntion between social integration and sleep disturbance.\nThis possibility was tested formally with the bivariate\nmodel displayed in Figure 1.\nModel 1 (Table 2) includes the model parameters for\nthe full bivariate specification estimating the ACE vari-\nance components for social integration and sleep distur-\nbance, as well as regressions from each of the variance\ncomponents in social integration to sleep disturbance.\nThis model fit the data well (CFI = .96, RMSEA = .02). As\nshown, estimates for a common environmental influence\n(C) on both variables did not appear to be different from\nzero. In addition, cross-regressions from the common\nenvironment and the non-shared environment variance in\nsocial integration to sleep disturbance did not appear to\nbe different from zero. Therefore, I tested a parsimonious\nspecification (Model 2) by fixing these four parameters to\nzero. This specification did not significantly decrease the\nwas reasonable to set the common environment to zero\nin univariate biometric models for social integration and\nsleep disturbance. For each construct, altering the model\nfrom an ACE to an AE specification did not significantly\ndegrade model fit.\nA notable feature of Model 2 is that fixing the cross-\nregression from the non-shared environmental variance\nof social integration on sleep disturbance to zero did not\nresult in a decrement in model fit. It is informative to con-\nsider these associations from a different perspective as\nwell: What happens when the cross-regression from the\ngenetic variance of social integration on sleep disturbance\nWithin-Trait, Cross-Twin Correlations Cross-Trait, Cross-Twin Correlations\nZygosity Social Integration Sleep Disturbance Social Integration-Sleep Disturbancea\nTable 1: Within-trait and Cross-twin Correlations for the Social Integration and Sleep Disturbance Items in the MIDUS Sample.\nNote: MZ = monozygotic (identical) twin pairs; DZ = dizygotic (fraternal) twin pairs. a = two correlations are presented\nfrom each twin pair.

Model 2 is the reduced bivariate specification (fixing the common environ-\nment estimates of both variables, as well as the environmental cross regressions, to zero). Model 3 introduces interaction\nterms, and Model 4 is a reduced specification that includes only the non-zero estimates from Model 3. * p < .05\nSbarra: Genetics, Social Integration & Sleep\nis fixed to zero and the cross regression from the non-\nshared environmental variance is freely estimated? When\nthe common genetic path is omitted from the model, the\neffect of non-shared environment variance in social\nintegration on sleep disturbance is different from zero\nent with findings from research that is not genetically\ninformed. However, fixing the genetic influences (shared\nbetween social integration and sleep disturbance) to\nzero resulted in a large decrement in model fit (2 = 23.8,\ndf = 1, p < .0001). This pattern of results suggests that\nwithin-twin differences in social integration do not exert\na causal influence on sleep disturbance. Instead, evidence\nfrom the MIDUS sample suggests that common genetics\ncannot be excluded from the model; the negative pheno-\ntypic association between perceived social integration and\nperceived sleep disturbance is best explained by genes\nthat are common to both variables.\nThe next series of analyses explored the possibility that\nperceived social integration moderates the genetic and\nenvironmental influences on sleep disturbance. These\nmodels involve adding an interaction term to the AE\nvariance estimates in the sleep disturbance variable (see\nFigure 2), as well as to the cross-regression from social\nintegration to sleep disturbance. Model 3 (Table 2) dis-\nplays the 10 parameter estimates from this moderation\nmodel. Although Model 2 fixed the cross-regression from\nthe non-shared variance in social integration to sleep dis-\nturbance to zero, I estimated this main effect in order to\nalso estimate the interaction on this cross-regression in\nModel 3; conceptually, this would allow for a potentially\ncausal influence from social integration to sleep distur-\nbance to operate at specific levels of social integration.\nHowever, as shown in Table 2 (Model 3), neither the main\neffect nor the interaction effects were significant from the\nnon-shared variance in social integration to sleep distur-\nbance. Among the three other interaction effects, social\nintegration moderated only the unique non-shared envi-\nronmental variance of sleep disturbance. To ensure these\nresults were not spurious, I re-estimated the model by fix-\ning the non-significant estimates to zero, and the resulting\nestimates are displayed in the Model 4. The key param-\neter of interest in Model 4 is the negative interaction (E'\nsl\n)\nbetween the non-shared variance in sleep disturbance and\nsocial integration, providing evidence that social integra-\ntion moderates the unique environmental influences in\nsleep disturbance.\nThe results of this analysis (Model 4) are displayed in\nFigure 3. At low levels of social integration, non-shared\nenvironmental contribution to sleep disturbance is high-\nest, whereas the influence of genetics on sleep disturbance\nincreases steadily as social integration increases. For exam-\nple, among people who report the lowest levels of social\nintegration (i.e., those two SDs below the mean on this\ncomposite), 83% of the variance in sleep disturbance is\ndue to non-shared environment variance, whereas among\nthose who report the highest levels of social integration\n(i.e., those two SDs above the mean on this composite),\n70% of the variance in sleep disturbance is due to non-\nshared environmental influence.\nFigure 3: Proportion of variance in sleep disturbance due to genetic and non-shared environmental influences as a\nfunction of social integration (SI).

(Figure estimates derived from the parameters reported\nin Model 4, Table 2.)\nSbarra: Genetics, Social Integration & Sleep Art.3, page7 of 10\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study suggest that an essential feature\nof the evolutionary model of loneliness may need refine-\nment or elaboration. Contrary to my primary hypothesis\nand the hypervigilance formulation, which holds that low\nlevels of social integration lead to sleep disturbances (for\npeople who are frequently monitoring their social stand-\ning), I found no evidence for a quasi-causal effect linking\nthe two constructs. Instead, genes common to both vari-\nables explain the phenotypic association between social\nintegration and sleep disturbance. These findings are con-\nsistent with a prior twin analysis from the MIDUS data,\nwhich found that the association between social integra-\ntion and perceived overall (self-rated) health was due to\ngenetic influences common to both variables [6].\nBoth social integration and sleep disturbance are com-\nplex traits that likely involve contributions from hundreds\nof different genes. Although these analyses do not identify\nthe specific genes that are shared by the two traits, recent\nmolecular studies suggest that variability in the polymor-\nphic region of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR)\nplays an important role in shaping emotional responses to\nstress [34] and is related to both loneliness and a variety of\nsleep disturbances [28, 35]. For example, relative to non-\ncaregivers, caregivers of a spouse or parent with dementia\nwho also carried a short copy of the serotonin transporter\ngene self-reported significantly worse sleep [36], and ado-\nlescents carrying the short allele of 5-HTTLPR who also\nreported low maternal support were at increased risk of\ndeveloping loneliness [37]. Although the serotonin trans-\nporter gene may account for some of the shared genetics\nin social integration and loneliness, many other genes will\nplay a role in this association as well; for this reason, this\ntopic would greatly benefit from further research.\nIn a series of biometric moderation analyses, I examined\nwhether the genetic or environmental influences on sleep\ndisturbance differed as a function of social integration.\nEffectively, the analyses constituted studying a potential\nquantitative G X E interaction in the context of a gene-\nenvironment correlation (that accounts for genetic influ-\nences that are common to both variables). Although I had\nno a priori hypotheses for these analyses, I was motivated\nto explore two competing possibilities: a diathesis-stress\nmodel (in which low levels of social integration were asso-\nciated with the largest genetic influences on sleep distur-\nbance) and a stress-buffering model (in which low levels of\nsocial integration were associated with the greatest envi-\nronmental influences on sleep disturbance). The modera-\ntion analyses revealed that social integration interacted\nwith the non-shared environmental influences on sleep\ndisturbance but was largely unassociated with the genetic\ninfluences (either those common to social integration or\nunique to sleep disturbance). Thus, the results are most\nconsistent with a stress-buffering model of social support.\nAt the lowest levels of social integration (i.e., highest levels\nof loneliness), non-shared environmental influences on\nsleep disturbance were the greatest, accounting for up to\n83% of the variance in sleep disturbance (calculated from\nthe unstandardized regression coefficients in Model 4,\nTable 2). Prior reports demonstrate a large non-shared\nenvironmental influence on sleep duration [18], and the\ncurrent results are consistent with this finding, on average,\nand further suggest that as social integration decreases,\nthe influence of non-shared environmental factors grows.\nThe main idea behind the stress-buffering hypothesis\n[20] is that during periods of acute stress, social resources\ncome online to alter the perception or experience of stress\nand thus attenuate the corresponding physiological and\npsychological responses to these events. Results of the\ncurrent study suggest that when perceived social integra-\ntion is low (i.e., when loneliness is high), non-shared envi-\nronmental influences account for the largest amount of\nvariance in sleep disturbances. These environmental influ-\nences are not shared within the family and may include,\nfor example, differential exposure by twins to work or\nrelationship stress, discrimination, academic rejections,\nor a host of other environmental experiences that may\nbe related to sleep disturbance. When social integration\nis low, these non-shared experiences exert their strongest\nimpact on sleep disturbance. In contrast, I find no sub-\nstantial evidence in support of the diathesis-stress model\nin which we would expect the greatest genetic influences\non sleep disturbances at low levels of social integration.\nAlthough it is true-- and perhaps somewhat perplexing\nat face value-- that the largest genetic influences on sleep\ndisturbance risk are observed at high levels of social inte-\ngration, it is important to note that the 29% heritability\nobserved at high levels of social integration are consistent\nwith the heritability of low sleep duration in general (see\n[18]). I interpret the results to suggest that as social inte-\ngration decreases (or, as loneliness increases) we observe a\ngreater influence of the unique environmental influences\non sleep disturbance. In considering this process overall,\nit is also important to note the moderation effect appears\nfairly small--a 13% increase in environmental variance\nacross the entire spectrum of social integration. It will be\nincumbent upon future research to ultimately determine\nif a change in this amount is meaningful, and one way\nof doing so is to examine other moderators of sleep dis-\nturbance and to compare or benchmark the differential\ngenetic and environmental influences across these poten-\ntially distinct moderators.\nThe findings from this study should be interpreted in\nlight of several limitations. First, a single item tapping\nsleep disturbance is inadequate for making firm conclu-\nsions about the loneliness-sleep association more gener-\nally. As noted in the Method, however, the single item\nmeasure of sleep disturbance used here was significantly\nassociated with the PSQI Global Sleep Quality score up to\n10yearslater,suggestingthatthesingleitemtappingsleep\nproblems is sensitive to variability in self-reported sleep\nproblems. A related point is that both measures used in\nthis study rely exclusively on self-report, which may con-\nfound the nature of the genetic association. For example,\nit is possible that the common genetic influences on both\ntraits reflect common method variance and genetic influ-\nences on the tendency to report low levels of social inte-\ngration and high sleep disturbance. Genetically-informed\nstudies that include objective measures of both traits will\nhelp clarify this. Second, this report relied on data from\nSbarra: Genetics, Social Integration & Sleep\na single wave of the MIDUS study; it is possible that, as\nexposure to loneliness accumulates in time, a prospective\nassociation between these traits would be consistent with\na quasi-causal influence. Prospective analyses will add\nmuch to this literature in time. In addition, it is quite pos-\nsible that the potentially causal ordering of the associa-\ntion between social integration and sleep flows from sleep\nto social integration (and not as studied here, from social\nintegration to sleep). I chose the current analyses based\non extant theory about loneliness and health (see [13]),\nbut other genetically-informed designs have included\nsleep as the predictor variable of interest (e.g., [19]).\nFinally, although this study includes 905 twin pairs, the\nsample size is relatively small for testing complex biom-\netric models, especially in cases where common environ-\nmental influence may be present and for the examination\nof statistical interactions. Examining these effects in larger\ntwin samples would contribute to this growing body of\nknowledge.\nConclusion\nSleep and sleep disturbances play an important role in\nthe evolutionary theory of loneliness [13], but is loneli-\nness a causal agent of ill health or a marker of risk more\ngenerally? The theory dictates that the lonely are hyper-\nvigilant about their social standing; this hypervigilance\ncan extend to sleep difficulties, and these difficulties rep-\nresent an important route through which loneliness may\naffect health. Using data from the MIDUS twin sample,\nthis paper examined whether within-pair differences in\nsocial integration were associated with sleep disturbances\nafter accounting for shared genetic influences on both\ntraits. The phenotypic association between social integra-\ntion and sleep disturbance is best explained by genes that\nare common to both variables, and the observed results\nwere not consistent with a quasi-causal effect from low\nsocial integration to greater sleep disturbances. Despite\nthe absence of this direct effect, social integration mod-\nerated the non-shared environmental influences on sleep\ndisturbance, with the greatest non-shared environment\nvariance observed at the lowest levels of sleep distur-\nbance. I interpreted these effects as being consistent with\nand providing evidence for a stress-buffering model of\nsocial integration rather than a diathesis-stress model in\nwhich low social integration would potentiate the genetic\ninfluences on sleep disturbance.\nCompeting Interests\nThe author declares that they have no competing interests.\n"
