Overweight among children and adolescents was\ndefined as at or above the 95th percentile of the sex-specific body mass index (BMI) for\nage growth charts. Obesity among adults was defined as a BMI of 30 or higher; ex-\ntreme obesity was defined as a BMI of 40 or higher.\n32.2% of adults were obese.

To test for trends, the NHANES\nsurvey years were included as an\nordinal variable in logistic regression\nmodels that included age group and\nrace/ethnicity.

All 2-way interac-\ntion terms were dropped from the sex-\nspecific models because they were\nnot statistically significant. No 3-way\ninteractions were tested.

The prevalence of\noverweight among children and ado-\nlescents and obesity among men in-\nprevalence among women was ob-\nserved over the 6-year period.\nMultivariable model results indi-\ncate that the only statistically signifi-\ncant trends were those noted overall\nfor men and for children and adoles-\ncents. Trends did not differ signifi-\ncantly by age or racial/ethnic group.\nAlthough differences in point esti-\nmates may appear large in some sub-\ngroups, the differences are not statisti-\ncally significant. Subgroup estimates\nby sex, age, and race/ethnicity are less\nprecise than the overall estimates.\nThis is due to smaller sample sizes\nand fewer degrees of freedom than for\nthe overall estimates. Future data\nprovide more information about\nchanges in subgroups.\nTable 3.
