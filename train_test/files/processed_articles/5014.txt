The first aim of this study is to explore\nhow to overcome two dichotomies--public\u00adprivate as spheres of everyday life and third\u00adfourth age--and by overcoming\nthese, to make visible the personal social resources of older people, which are not usually recognized in policy discourses or\nin social policy research. Second, we ask whether the problem-oriented rhetoric of aging in Finnish social and rural policy can\nbe challenged from the perspective of aging people's activities. The article analyzes older people as actors of a rural village\ncommunity and overcomes the two dichotomies mentioned above from the theoretical context of agency. In this research,\nrural East Finland is a case with which to investigate social relationships between people. We suggest that seniors not only\nparticipate in a variety of communal activities but also act in their homes, which are culturally coded as the territory of private\nlife. By \"just being there,\" people also produce and reproduce rural communities in many ways. This is a form of action that\nhas been largely ignored by policies, policymakers, and social studies.\n",

The distance from the capital city of Helsinki on the\nsouth coast to the most north area in Lapland is 1,350 km, a\n16-hr trip by car. As in many other EU countries, the process\nof population concentration to some urban centers is ongo-\ning. Older people in the East and North Finland face quite\nsimilar problems as those in the Northern Periphery areas of\nother EU countries. Access to services is often poor for peo-\nple without their own cars; in East Finland, the distance to\nthe nearest shop can be close to 100 km and in the northern\npart, it can be even further. Similar to other rural areas in\nEurope, in Finland, old people without a car and with weak\nlocal networks are in danger of being excluded from services\nand social relationships and many activities outside their\nnearest living environment (Davey, 2007; D. Gray, Shaw, &\nFarrington, 2006). In those circumstances, the social situa-\ntions of people with or without a car are very different. One\nof the most important social differences between rural people\nin remote areas is their travel possibilities (Tedre &\nThis article is based on a research project in which our\ninterest focused on the life of retired people who remained\nin, returned to, or moved to rural areas after retirement. In\nFinland, many older people from remote, sparsely populated\ncountryside municipalities are drawn to urban centers by the\npromise of better and more public social and health services\ncompared with those that they have access to in remote areas\n(Tedre & Pulkkinen, 2010). Even if the trend of migration is\nfrom rural to urban, there are also flows in the opposite direc-\ntion. One of the groups moving from urban areas to rural\ncommunities is retired people soon after retirement at\napproximately 60 years of age (Kattilakoski, 2011; Pehkonen,\nPhillipson (2000) summarized the way in which the idea\nof \"community\" was reassessed within contemporary sociol-\nogy in the context of urbanization and globalization in the\n1990s. In this article, we approach a rural village as a social\ncommunity. In a sparsely populated country, local villages\nare quite scattered, without any concentration of population\naround distinct centers. The number of inhabitants in Finnish\nvillages ranges from a small group of permanent inhabitants\nto approximately 500 people. During the summer months,\nthe number of inhabitants will increase significantly.

We focus on invisible action in homes and\ninformal social networks, but to obtain a holistic picture, we\nstart by introducing the other social activities of senior vil-\nlagers, often reported in earlier studies concerning active or\nproductive aging.\nIn comparative studies of welfare states, Finland is usu-\nally classified as one of the Scandinavian (Nordic) welfare\nstates in which public services, provided by local authorities,\nare widely available (Kr\u00f6ger, Anttonen, & Sipil\u00e4, 2003). The\n\"rural\" question has always been at the top of the state\nagenda. The Finnish government has implemented regional\npolicies since the 1960s that were specifically designed to\nprevent regional disparities in wealth services and opportuni-\nties. Therefore, differences between urban and rural areas\nwith regard to income and living standards have been quite\nsmall in Finland by international comparison. However, cur-\nrently, the central problems relating to Finland's rural policy\nhave been identified as aging, loss of population, economic\nunderperformance, environmental degradation, and a\ndecrease in the number of jobs and services available. In\nrural policy documents, aging is named as one of the main\nproblems of rural areas and the loss of social and health ser-\nvices is perceived as a core problem for older rural people\nple in rural areas might be \"othered\" or marginalized through\ncultural practices in everyday life and particularly through\nthe social construction of identity and symbolic capital in\nsocial and lay discourses. In the context of the sustained\nmovement out of rural villages, we search for dimensions of\ncommunal action of older villagers by asking whether it is\npossible to challenge the ways Finnish rural policy identifies\nolder villagers mainly through the individual problems they\nface in the village or by perceiving them as a non-productive\ngroup of the society or rural areas.\nIn the 1980s, the Swedish social gerontologist Lars\nTornstam (1982) introduced the idea of a resource perspec-\ntive for social gerontology research. He emphasized older\npeople's importance as a labor force as well as a source of\nvoluntary work. Tornstam structured the arenas of action as\nfollows: market, labor market, neighborhood, policy, and lei-\nsure. Later on, concepts such as productive aging (Bass &\nCaro, 2001; Hinterlong, Morrow-Howell, & Sherraden,\nincluded the idea that old people are useful to a society in one\nway or another. This shows the varieties of activities of\nelderly people and the positive economic, social, or personal\noutcomes of those activities. These perspectives have also\nbeen criticized (e.g., Estes, Biggs, & Phillipson, 2003)\nbecause of their links with neo-liberalistic ideas of\neffectiveness and independent initiative. Furthermore,\nfourth age constructs the age after retirement as a period free\nfor personal achievement to create forms of social collabora-\ntion previously unknown. The fourth age, instead, is the age\nof dependence and decrepitude. Laslett's dichotomy has\nbeen criticized for treating the dependent people of the fourth\nage as opposite to the independent, active elderly of the third\nage.\nIn this article, we ask whether it is possible in the context\nof rural communities to find social resources of older people\nthat have been unrecognized in earlier studies and in rural\npolicy. First, we will briefly review the literature relating to\ncommunity, a sense of community, and active agency in the\ncontext of the public and private division. Next, we will pres-\nent the data, analysis, and ethical questions followed by an\nexplanation of the findings and finally a discussion of the\nstudy's outcomes.\nVillages as Interactive Communities\nThis article focuses on retired (60+) people as actors of rural\nvillages. We approach a rural village as a social community\nthat provides interactions between people, nature, and places.\nA traditional division of communities presented by T\u00f6nnies\n(1992) includes the concepts of Gemeinschaft and\nGesellschaft. Warm relationships and harmony among a\nfamily and village are characteristic of a Gemeinschaft com-\nmunity. A Gesellschaft community, on the contrary, is\nfounded on egoistic and calculated relationships. According\nto Lehtonen (1990), Gemeinschaft is a warm caregiving\ncommunity, whereas a Gesellschaft community is guided by\nrationality. Furthermore, he states that the interpretation of a\nGemeinschaft community is a modern world's conception of\na community projected into pre-modern time in which the\nnegative features of a pre-modern community have been left\nunder the shadow of positive features. In this context, this\nconception of community can be an interpretation with no\nsubstance. Status communities (Gemeinschaft) were con-\nnected to a family and relatives, whereas agreement commu-\nnities (Gesellschaft) were based on the act of agreeing.\nFor his part, David Conway (1996) stated that a commu-\nnity is any type of a group of individuals that shares a com-\nmon life or a way of life, completely or partially. It associates\na natural value with that shared life or way of life, and is\naware that others in the group also associate in the same way.\nThe individuals of a group feel, or tend to feel, pronounced\nrespect for each other and cooperate, or tend to cooperate,\nwith each other to maintain and encourage a shared life or\nway of life. Conway has taken the family, neighborhood or\nclosest living environment, nation, and state as more precise\nresearch subjects of community forms. All of these tend to be\nvalued positively. At the same time, communities can be\ncruel and harrowing in which different hierarchies compete\nwith each other. Nevertheless, individuals change,\nTedre and Pehkonen 3\ncommunities change, and the relationships between the\nmembers of the communities change all the time. (Murdoch,\nWhen a community is translated broadly into a group for-\nmation, it can be based on economic, political, or regional\nfactors. A common feature may be kinship, interests, beliefs,\ncommon actions, interactions, hobbies, and so forth, and\ncommunities can be categorized according to their objectives\nand the nature of their interactions. In communities, there are\nnetworks of social relationships that have contents of mean-\ning and values in common, but a community does not neces-\nsarily have to be geographically clustered. In other words, a\ncommunity is formed by bonds between people, the strength\nof which cannot be standardized. A community may also\nfunction as an adhering environment, the fundamental fea-\nture of which is support. In this case, a community allows an\nindividual to be weak while providing chances to take\naction--such that it becomes possible for the individual to\nconfront the things that threaten him or her (e.g., Winnicott,\n1986). Common among these definitions and classifications\nas well as the need to defend a community for it to survive\nGranovetter (1973) divided social networks into continu-\nously maintained \"strong bonds\" characterized by intensive\ncommunication, emotional intensity, and mutual trust, and\ninto \"weak bonds\" that are more distant and less frequently\nmaintained. Although paradoxical, weak social bonds are\nnevertheless important from the perspective of social net-\nworks'structural capability to distribute information. Persons\nwith less frequently maintained social relationships move in\ndifferent fields of society, belong to different social reference\ngroups, and gain information about different things. There\nare few responsibilities related to weak bonds. At a micro\nlevel, weak bonds make the distribution of information eas-\nier and, at best, increase the opportunities for cooperation\nbetween actors. Weak bonds are important for connecting\nsmall groups and channeling the distribution of information.\nThe meaning of strong bonds is connected to commitments\nbetween actors. Strong bonds primarily integrate their mem-\nbers into a group, whereas weak bonds integrate individuals\ninto the society. Strong bonds are generally held as important\nsources of social support in everyday life.\nThe concept of social support was introduced (e.g.,\nGreen, 1993) when explaining the connection between\nbecoming ill and changes in one's life. Social support has\nmany forms: practical help, appreciation, mental support,\nand support based on knowledge. A social support provider\nsupports a person in need to a proper extent, as social support\ncan turn against itself if it becomes an experience of social\ncontrol.\nAccording to Pehkonen (2009), a community expresses\nits will through, for example, social control, by which it\nhopes to regulate the behavior of its members. Doing right\nfrom the viewpoint of a community can nevertheless entail\ndoing wrong on a personal level. Social pressure and pres-\nsures of conformity and hierarchies are strongly linked to\nrural villages and particularly to a peasant culture. People\nbelong to several communities at the same time (e.g., family,\nwork, study, place of residence, hobbies), each with its own\nregulations and distribution of work and tasks. In this case,\nthe pressure of community-focused membership is distrib-\nuted. In general, we move from one field to another smoothly,\nbut this does not remove the possibility of encountering role\nconflicts. Communities' visible and invisible regulations are\npresent in different fields and are negotiable. Status and\nexpectations regarding the same person can be manifested in\ndifferent ways within the same day when an individual\nmoves from one community to another. An individual is\nforced into a mobility of roles, even playing various roles\nsimultaneously in some cases. Role negotiations do not occur\nin a social vacuum, and negotiations do not necessarily lead\nto a shared mutual understanding. A pattern of behavior per-\nceived as suitable in a role situation can be considered unsuit-\nable in the same individual's other relationships. Most\nevidently, people living in a rural village quite often must\nplay different roles among the same people.\nCommunities and a sense of community are both stimu-\nlating and controlling principles for individuation. They\nreflect pluralism (Etzioni, 1995), a phenomenon through\nwhich individuals as consumers and choosers search for\nindividual answers and choices in their lives (e.g., Roos,\n1996). A moral community has been sought, for example,\nfrom village communities, churches, and a civic society.\nMorals bring people together through their emotional life.\nOn one hand, communities may be ignorant of the welfare of\ntheir members, particularly in cases where the dimension of\nwelfare in question does not connect to the function of a\ncommunity. On the other hand, communities can easily be\nclose and loyal to their members, but their relationship to the\noutside world may become problematic (e.g., Allardt, 1964;\n\"Small Agency\" in the Setting of\nCommunity and Private Life\nAnu Leinonen (2007) distinguished between three levels of\naction: society and macro environment, communities and\norganizations, and individual and personal. In this article, we\nfocus on the level of community as a place of residence and\nthe individual as a member of a community. Marja-Liisa\nHonkasalo (2009) studied women's action in their village\nhomes and discusses \"small agency.\" Small agency is hum-\nble and minimal if viewed through the usual social science\ntoolkit that considers the \"act\" or \"agency.\" In fact, Honkasalo\nwonders whether this type of agency can be conceptualized\nas agency at all:\nAs basic notions, agency is considered intentional, individual,\nrational, and normative, aiming at social change in some\n4 SAGE Open\nmeasurable sense.An actor--to be a proper actor--needs a goal-\noriented mind and the appropriate tools to achieve a rational\ngoal, mostly considered as a form of social transformation.\nHonkasalo studied women's enduring action in their\nhomes. Enduring action has a social dimension; it is social\nand inter-subjective in that it takes place in close proximity\nto others and is shared with them (Honkasalo, 2009; M.\nJackson, 1998). There are intermittent phases of passivity\nand activity, reception and action: Women in the village\nreceived the other's acts to be able to act. Sometimes, this\nreception consisted of simply keeping oneself open. As\nsocial actors, they could entrust themselves to their commu-\nnity, indicating that they could sustain and draw strength\nfrom one another. The many acts of a single person can have\nrepercussions for others not only in the sense of being addi-\ntive or attenuating but also in the sense of dynamic\naccumulation.\nFrom the community perspective, action is similar to breathing,\na process of intermittent phases, where the acts of inhaling and\nexhaling are equally necessary. The passive, receptive phase of\naction is extremely important in this sense, but in social science\nThere are two types of attachments that women create\nthrough their agency. First, their activities are addressed to\nrepair and fasten social bonds that are in danger of becom-\ning weakened or broken. This bonding is created through\nsmall everyday interactions, passive and active, with peo-\nple and among them. The second type of bond is a grip on\nthe world. Women's agency takes place without the power\nof the ritual, in the context of everyday life (Honkasalo,\nHonkasalo's theory emphasizes action in the context of\n\"home.\" The public\u00adprivate split is among the most classic\nthemes of feminist theory. According to Marja Ker\u00e4nen\n(1995), the ways we talk about things--ourselves, our lives,\nsociety--are structured by the hidden spatialization of the\npublic and private. She argues that distinction works as a hid-\nden metaphor that has been naturalized in the ways we think\nabout the world and structure our social reality.\nFeminist scholars have argued that when the spheres\nbecame diversified and autonomous, the family was forgot-\nten in the ways in which political science conceptualized the\nsocial system. The family that was once a necessary part of\nthe social order was put in the position of external nature in\nlater interpretations. In political theory, family was relegated\nto privacy. However, the family and the household remain\nthe \"basic units of society\" (Ker\u00e4nen, 1995). In addition,\nBarnes, Newman, and Sullivan (2007) raised the question of\nhow diverse groups can be represented and how the public is\ndefined or constituted by officials. According to them, these\nquestions interact with notions of the competence, skills, and\npractices of participations.\nIn this article, the community refers both to the common\npublic places of a village and the homes of people. Moreover,\nit extends beyond the physical boundaries of the village\nthrough social networks of people. \"Home\" as a physical\nplace of housing is culturally coded as private. Feminist\nscholars have long noted that people who are restricted to the\nprivate realm have no place in the realm of life that extends\nbeyond the private sphere of friends and family (Tronto,\n1993). Like early feminist scholars, we suggest that action in\nthe sphere of the home is not strictly private. Actions are also\nreproduced in the community in many ways that are often\nself-evident. We join the feminist tradition, which criticizes\nthe way social theories understand the home as private and\nopposite to the public sphere. Age and functional ability can\nalso discursively exclude people from the discussions of\ncommunity and society.\nData and Analysis\nThis article is based on several sets of ethnographic field-\nwork carried out in East Finland by the authors during 2009-\n2010 as part of a research project on rural areas, funded by\nthe Finnish Rural Policy Committee.\nThe focus of the study project was the permanent inhabit-\nants of rural areas outside the population center and their\nsocial networks inside and outside the place of residence. We\nasked what type of structural barriers and possibilities there\nare for old people to continue living in rural areas and in\n\"homes\" in circumstances of centralization and urbanization\nwithin Finnish society. The study project has been reported\nearlier from three perspectives. The first article dealt with the\nmunicipal social care policy of old age from the perspective\nof villages. The second article focused on the questions of\nopportunities for mobility, and the third one was interested in\nthe community as a resource for older people living in nurs-\ning homes. In the present article, we focus on older people as\na resource for the community.\nThe two-step qualitative data collection started with face-\nto-face interviews with six old-age pensioners who were\nknown as active organizers of their own village in two prov-\ninces, Kainuu and North Karelia, in East Finland. In addi-\ntion, three organizers were interviewed by e-mail and phone.\nMost of the nine organizers were village leaders. We also\nanalyzed the reports of LEADER projects (88) carried out in\na province in 2009. The aim of this phase was to find out the\norganized activities of older rural people and to choose a case\nvillage for actual fieldwork that enables us to search for the\nnon-organized activities and, small agency, of senior villag-\ners. The village that was chosen for fieldwork is situated in\nNorth Karelia. During the fieldwork, the main methods for\ncollecting data were observation and discussions with inhab-\nitants of the case village. Researchers visited the village sev-\nfieldwork diaries, transcribed interviews of active organizers\n(6), e-mail discussions with three more organizers, and the\nTedre and Pehkonen 5\nproject reports of LEADER projects (88). In addition, two\ninformants wrote an account of the everyday lives of their\nelderly relatives in the village.\nThe informants in the study ranged in age from 65 to 90\nout. Some of the informants had lived in the same village\nthroughout their lives. Most of them, however, had moved to\nthe village during their adult life, in some cases after retire-\nment, whereas others were returnees. The variety of their\nlifestyles illustrates the variety and heterogeneity of retired\npeople. Seniors in the study lived alone, with a spouse, or\nwith their children's family in detached houses. Some of\nthem lived in a nursing home. One of the main ideas of the\nstudy was to suppose that communal social resources of\nretired people can be found everywhere, for example, in\nnursing homes. From this perspective, we ignored people's\npotential need for social care and avoided the context of\nsocial and health care when interpreting data. We wanted to\novercome not only the conceptual split of the public and pri-\nvate sphere but also the split of the third and fourth age.\nThe interviews with active organizers were carried out in\nthe provinces of Kainuu and North Karelia, situated on the\nnortheast edge of EU, close to the Finnish\u00adRussian border.\nThe provinces have approximately 24,000 inhabitants and\ntheir average population density is 3.8 persons/km2. The sec-\nond phase of the study, fieldwork, was carried out in a village\nin North Karelia. We had numerous informal discussions\nwith villagers and participated in village events there and in\nthe neighborhood. We also visited older people's homes,\nincluding a small private nursing home that was situated in\nthe village. Moreover, we traveled by the local taxi \"car-\npool,\" which was a development project of the municipality\naimed at ensuring that people without a car had access to the\ncity center once a week.\nIn terms of net migration, the municipality where the case\nstudy village is situated is one of the most affected munici-\npalities in North Karelia. The population of the municipality\nThe municipality also has one of the highest median ages in\nFinland, and it is estimated that the proportion of people\nabove the ages of 75 and 85 will continue to increase signifi-\nThe research approach can be illustrated through the met-\naphor of a traveler; the interviewer\u00adtraveler wanders through\nthe landscape and enters into conversation with the people\nencountered. He or she wanders along with the local inhabit-\nants and asks questions that lead the subjects to tell their own\nstories of their lived world. The meaning in the original sto-\nries is differentiated and unfolded through the traveler's\ninterpretations (Kvale, 1996). The study is a construction,\nnot a literal photograph of the situation in question. We were\ninterested in seniors as a group as well as the variety of their\nlifestyles, actions, and social situations. We aimed to produce\n\"thick\" descriptions (Geertz, 1973) of a village community\nfrom the perspective of pensioners. The descriptions must\nremain close to the concrete reality but must also reveal the\ngeneral features of human social life (Hammersley &\nIn the study, when collecting data, the case village was\ndefined administratively according to the relevant village\naction committees. Since the mid-1970s, a large number of\nvillage action committees across North Karelia, all based on\nvoluntary village activity. According to the rural policy strat-\negy of North Karelia, the main idea of those committees is to\ndevelop the village and the surrounding countryside (Pohjois-\nmainly use fieldwork diaries during visits in the case village.\nThe in-depth thematic interviews with the active organizers\nof villages are also used.\nActive senior organizers were located for interviews with\nthe help of LEADER organizations in East Finland. Every\nexecutive manager of an organization could easily name one\nor more active, regionally well-known seniors above 65\nyears of age. For the study, we selected nine seniors, of both\nsexes and different backgrounds, including returnees, new-\ncomers, and people who had lived in the village their whole\nadult lives. Some of them had bought a small, old house and\nmoved from the city after redecorating the house. Some had\nbuilt a new house in a rural area for their retirement years.\nOne woman moved to the village as a young wife after mar-\nriage with a farmer, and they currently live in a small house\nin the same barnyard with their daughter's family, who are\nnow responsible for the farm. Four of interviewees were\ndivorced and remarried; five others were married with their\nfirst spouse. Every couple has children and grandchildren.\nThe village in which the latter fieldwork was carried out\nis situated approximately 40 km from the center of the\nmunicipality. The nearest shop (as well as other services\nincluding social and health care services) is situated in the\ncenter. Buses no longer travel there, the school was closed\nabout 10 years ago, and the latest shop was closed a year ago.\nThe number of permanent inhabitants is approximately 400,\nand there is an energetic local village action committee. The\nvillage mostly survives off tourism revenues; it is located on\na lake, and Finnish national landscape is situated opposite\nthe lake. Because of tourism, the age structure of the village\nis younger than in neighboring villages. A nursing home is\nalso located in this village. A nursing home in a village is\nquite an unusual solution for care services because the policy\nof municipalities with long inner distances is typically to\nconcentrate the services for older people in the city center.\nThe nursing home was a small private unit of nine resi-\ndents and six care workers. We visited it several times during\nthe year and spoke with residents and care professionals.\nFour of the nine residents were interviewed. We wanted to\n6 SAGE Open\nknow about their social bonds in the village and what the\nmeaning of this special village was for them. We also met\ntheir relatives when they visited. It turned out that one of the\nresidents did not have any other social bonds in the village,\nexcept a daughter and her family. The place as such was not\nimportant to her, whereas for the other three people, the vil-\nlage was essential and meaningful. They had strong bonds\nwith the village, its nature, culture, and people. The village as\nsuch was a resource for them even if they did not move out-\nside the nursing home or no longer had relatives there (Tedre\nThe setting of our study is a village. In terms of\nGesellschaft and Gemeinschaft, the village is both a status\ncommunity of family, friends, and relatives and an agree-\nment community with an official village action committee. It\nis the closest living environment of permanent inhabitants.\n\"The village community\" as a concept includes both social\nand physical space, the boundaries of which are continuously\nchanging (Massey, 1995). The village as a community is thus\nchanging at every moment. For example, the winter commu-\nnity differs from the summer community because of the con-\nsiderable amount of summer residences and leisure residents\nDoreen Massey (1995) critiqued the notion of place as a\nsecure haven that is culturally coherent and bounded.\nInstead, she demonstrates that the identities of places them-\nselves are in part the product of a long history of connec-\ntions with other places beyond one's own. For Massey,\nplaces are essentially open and porous, and are the products\nof links with other places rather than exclusive enclosures\nsealed off from the outside world. In this article, a village is\nunderstood as a place connected with other places. At the\nsame time, it is a community of people who occasionally or\npermanently live in a specific geographical place with their\nnetworks, which overcome the specific place. This article\nfocuses on the permanent inhabitants of the village\ncommunity.\nAging people in a rural village were not a homogeneous\ngroup in relation to their commitment to the village. On the\ncontrary, their connections and attitudes to the village com-\nmunity varied in accordance with their lifestyles, social sta-\ntus, and life courses. Leena Vuorinen (2009) also examined\nthe everyday life of older inhabitants in a small village and\nconstructed the concept of four different ways of life. In her\nstudy, the traditional way of life is based on continuity and\nhard work; the family-oriented way of life is based on family\nmembers and relatives; the mobile way of life is character-\nized by symbolic and concrete mobility; and the fourth way\nof life was named by Vuorinen as the novel way of life,\nwhich the community considered strange, and is marked by\nindependent loneliness. Similarly, the strength of bonds\nbetween people in the village community cannot be stan-\ndardized. This variety of social bonds also concerns the\nelderly in nursing homes.\nEthical Questions\nWith respect to ethical considerations, the focus was placed\non issues of privacy, anonymity, and confidentiality. In addi-\ntion, respondents were informed that their answers were con-\nfidential and that the findings would be reported in such a\nway that anonymity would be ensured. In this study, this\nmeans that the names of people have been changed and the\nlocations of fieldwork are presented on a general level with-\nout exact names.\nFindings\nSocial Resources\nThe interviews with active senior organizers in East Finland\nvillages of this study, as is the case with many former studies,\nindicated that retired people formed a notable social resource\nfor the rural community in their many roles as volunteers.\nThey acted as line managers and as other voluntary workers\nof rural development projects, as well as in various country-\nside organizations. Within the role of managers of develop-\nment projects, they used their former occupational knowledge\nas well as their professional or political networks. They had\nstrong skills in leading local development projects and offer-\ning novel ideas, all the while encouraging, stimulating, and\ncompleting project applications and evaluation reports, gath-\nering people together, organizing volunteer work and even\nacting as volunteers themselves. In accordance with Putnam's\n(2000) idea of social capital, they sustained the public good,\nensuring that people share values and that the mutual trust of\ncommunity members was available to everyone. Ties\nbetween individuals, and particularly voluntary cooperation\nwithin formal associations, helped to increase social capital\nin the community as a whole. As Murdoch (2000) puts it\nwhen discussing social capital, the actions of people, includ-\ning those among whom we carry out research, are inherently\nsocial and performed, continually placed within networks of\nsocial relations The attitudes and actions of people are mean-\ningful in themselves, acting out the sociality (the social pro-\ncess) that is often sought at the level of the community.\nSome of the projects were \"blue-sky projects\" involving,\nfor example, building an observatory in a village. Some of\nthe retired developers interviewed for the study participated\nin almost every action on many levels concerning the vil-\nlage's development. Some respondents outlined activities\nthrough which they believed their special skills would be\nmost useful for the village. Those people were perceived as\n\"active villagers, as a part of community--on their own con-\nditions\" (organizer, woman, 68). The organizer chooses what\nto do and with whom to associate (Bourdieu, 1986).\nEvery organizer we met seemed to be a recognized and\nnotable resource for the village, in some cases for the munic-\nipality and more broadly as well. They were aware of their\nresponsibility for the future of the village. They identified the\nTedre and Pehkonen 7\nresponsibility to society based on reciprocity as the most\nimportant among their various motives. In doing so, they can\nshare the knowledge, skills, and experiences obtained during\ntheir lifetime. For them, the success and affluence of the vil-\nlage was in the common interest of every villager; the inter-\nests of the village can thus rise above individual interests.\nIn addition to the active organizers, many other senior vil-\nlagers participated in common activities of their own village,\nsuch as \"talkoot\" as well as various other forms of voluntary\nwork. \"Talkoot\" is a traditional rural community action, a\nform of volunteer work based on norms of solidarity and\ncommunality. Common action usually focuses on concrete,\nshort-period work performed for one family or for the com-\nmunity as whole. In agriculture, it was the norm that at least\none member of every family would participate in talkoot.\nTypical works were, for instance, haymaking and roofing. As\na return gift, food and drink were served to participants.\nIn our village, too, the older volunteer workers are 78 years old.\nOlder people never complain, that they should get some\ncompensation (get some payment). (senior organizer, man, 67)\nAccording to active organizers, talkoot was both a form of\nsocializing and reproducing the social cohesion of commu-\nnity. Moreover, talkoot was rational, goal-oriented action.\n\"You should achieve some tangible results there (in talkoot)\nand you must every time have good serving and you must\nknow when to stop before it becomes too hard to continue\"\n(senior organizer, man, 76). The emotional community\nbecomes visible in talkoot and reproduces community by\nstrengthening the overall sense of community. \"Talkoot is a\nkind of social action--it is important to be present, involved\nin talkoot, not necessarily that you work hard. It is a sense of\nsolidarity and emotional togetherness\" (senior organizer,\nThe new retired villagers brought new resources such as\nknowledge, social networks, skills, and labor. We analyzed\nsocial capital outcomes as a dynamic relationship, taking\ninto account the volunteer work performed and viewing the\nvillagers as actors rather than simply as members of the vil-\nlage. Their action increases the social capital in the village.\nJust as A. Gray (2009) concluded, supportive friendship may\narise from participatory activities.\nThe participation in talkoot is visible action that the com-\nmunity appreciates. In addition to talkoot, older people per-\nformed a great deal of other volunteer work. They kept up\nclub activities and participated as members of numerous\nassociations. In many cases, they took on a strong responsi-\nbility for a certain neighbor's well-being. At times, their\nresponsibility and bond were so strong that it was difficult to\nrefer to it as \"neighborly help\" or \"voluntary work,\" which is\nbased on equality. Small degrees of help had sometimes\nbecome quite large over time. The idea of reciprocity\n(Coleman, 1988) is thus no longer fulfilled. It would seem\nthat, in genuinely communal neighborhoods, residents\nsupport and view each other in a civilized way and develop\ngoodwill toward one another. A neighborhood seems to form\npeople's conceptions of their neighbors regardless of whether\nthey actively rub shoulders with them. Symbolic interaction,\nsocial interaction, and the act of individuals bonding with\nother people and places belong to a neighborhood and neigh-\nborly relationships (Unger & Wandersman, 1985).\nSenior villagers as transformers of cultural heritage as\nwell as transformers of occupational and other knowledge\nalso became recognized through this research. In particular,\ntheir experiential, practical, and local knowledge was used.\nOn a practical level, they advised leisure residents on how to\nadapt to unpredictable road conditions or how to behave on\nthe lake in different circumstances during the four seasons.\nThey also told newcomers about the social history of the\nvillage.\nThe former retired villagers who had moved from the vil-\nlage to population centers took part in village events, espe-\ncially in the summertime. By participating, they reproduced\ntheir emotional bond as members of the local community. At\nthe same time, they strengthened the social bonds between\npresent and former residents. In the summertime, the village\ncommunity expands because of the summer residents, and\nmany of them are retired people as well. All of these people\nmay reproduce social cohesion in the community by their\npersonal, non-material investments into the community\nUnrecognized Resources\nThe organized action described above as a form of common\naction is quite easy to interpret as a part of the social capital\ncreation within a village community and is also relatively\neasy to analyze in the context of rural development or pro-\nductive aging. One of the main aims of our study was to rec-\nognize communal forms of not so clearly identified action,\n\"small agency\"--as Honkasalo (2009) called it. Seniors who\nno longer participate in common action also live in the vil-\nlage. We did not meet them at all outside their own houses.\nHowever, we could visit a few of them when some of their\nrelatives asked them to permit our visit. Not everyone wanted\nto meet the foreign researchers, but often, some of their\nyounger relatives told us about their everyday lives. As per-\nmanent inhabitants of the village, those older people also\nreproduce the community through various forms of small\nagency in their homes or even in the nursing home in the\nvillage.\nOlder villagers reproduce the social community by just\nbeing there, by their simple presence in the place, and by\nbeing villagers. Many of them followed local newspapers or\nwere otherwise interested in what was happening in the vil-\nlage. If they do not participate in the village actions, they\nbecome invisible in the context of the community in the\nsense that other villagers did not recognize their presence as\nactive participants of community. We researchers came from\n8 SAGE Open\noutside the community and could find aspects of small com-\nmunal activity that were too self-evident for the villagers\nthemselves to recognize.\nFor instance, Marja and Seppo J\u00e4rvinen, a couple above\n80 years old, lived in Marja's birthplace in a small house that\nSeppo built in the 1960s. The families of their five children\nlive in the southern part of Finland or abroad. By living in the\nvillage, Marja and Seppo offered their children and grand-\nchildren a place to stay during the children's leisure time. At\nthe same time, they offered the former generations the pos-\nsibility to reproduce their village community ties. J\u00e4rvinen's\nhome was also a place that summer residents visited when\nthey needed knowledge about local circumstances or practi-\ncal skills, which were especially necessary in the country-\nside. It was also a place for researchers to collect information\nabout the village. In terms of human capital, Marja and\nSeppo had skills and capabilities that make newcomers act in\nAnother example, Maija and Matti Hassinen, a sister and\nbrother both above 70 years of age, also lived in their birth-\nplace. Almost everyone in the village knew them, although\nthey did not move in the village anymore after the shop was\nclosed. Their family has lived in the place as farmers for\nthree generations. Their five siblings who live outside the\nvillage visit regularly; one reason for the visits was to take\ncare of Maija and Matti. At the same time, they reproduced\ntheir own relationship with their birthplace and village.\nDuring fieldwork, we discovered many repeated everyday\nactions, \"matter of course\" actions, which following the\nideas of Honkasalo (2009), can be interpreted as small com-\nmunity agency. Elderly people took care of their garden or\nyard and the buildings--sometimes with their relatives--and\nfelt responsible for their environment and surroundings.\nTheir actions in the context of home reproduce the village in\nvisible and also in quite invisible, culturally self-evident\nways.\nWe also included the inhabitants of the nursing home as\nmembers of the village community. In Finnish rural policy,\naging villagers who need social care are mostly observed as\n\"others\" who need services, especially if they live in residen-\ntial institutions. They are no longer viewed as members of\nthe village community. Our discussions with the nursing\nhome inhabitants indicated that for several reasons, the vil-\nlage--not just the nursing home--was an important social\ncontext for them (Tedre & Pehkonen, 2011). However, in\ncontrast, the nursing home with its inhabitants was important\nfor the village community. Neither of these two viewpoints is\nrecognized in Finnish rural policy or social policy. The\nimportance of the nursing home was also a self-evident,\n\"matter of course\" for villagers outside the nursing home.\nThus, the nursing home formed a part of the village's institu-\ntional structure similar to the village shop and the tourism\nenterprise. It was the biggest employer in the village, and\npeople nearby knew the nursing home and some of their rela-\ntives lived or had lived in it. As such, the nursing home's\nresidents formed a part of the emotional social community.\nMoreover, the nursing home was a social arena for villagers\nto meet occupants of the nursing home, as well as each other.\nIn addition, some senior villagers of the nursing home repre-\nsented a living history of the village. For us as researchers,\nsome of them turned out to be key informants of village life,\neven if they had problems remembering short-term details.\nDiscussion\nUrbanization and the growth of the aging population are\nsome of the most important ongoing social trends in the\nworld. The consequences of urbanization are reflected in\nrural areas, where the process of communities' aging is often\nthe most rapid due to depopulation and out-migration from\nrural to urban areas. The political discussions concerning the\nconsequences of rural aging are largely problem-oriented,\nand/or the role of seniors in social change is unclear. In this\ncontext, retired people are often invisible, or they exist in\nsocial studies and political discussions mainly in the context\nof economic productivity, the family, or through the need for\ncare, often on a structural institutional level through the lack\nof sufficient public social and health care services for them.\nThis structural \"care service approach\" is especially empha-\nsized in the \"Nordic welfare states,\" including Finland, with\nits traditionally strong public sector responsibility in terms of\nsocial and health care services. Local authorities are afraid\nthat public services, and the structures for providing them--\nwelfare structures that have been built over several decades--\nare being endangered by the approach of market liberation.\nThe discussion emphasizes the withdrawal of services in the\ncountryside and focuses on the problems of rural residents.\nIn this context, \"the elderly\" are perceived through their\nneeds, not as actors in their community.\nThe ways in which we discuss and categorize members of\na community can exclude people, for instance, retired peo-\nple, and, if not everyone, most evidently the people who no\nlonger participate in common local activities in concrete\nways. The aim of this article was, first, to challenge the prob-\nlem-oriented approach to rural aging through a resource per-\nspective by asking about the types of social resources that\nseniors have in their local communities in the Finnish rural\ncontext. The local community is not merely a group of indi-\nviduals but also a group that cooperates in various ways and\npersonally shares varying aspects of common life. It is a\nmoral community whose senior members feel a responsibil-\nity for the continuation and development of their community.\nConceptually, a rural community in this article is an area that\nis geographically clustered and also contains a network of\nsocial relationships that go far beyond its geographical\nboundaries.\nInstead of viewing senior rural residents through their\nown needs, in the context of their own social networks or\n\"just\" as members of the community, we approach them as\nsocial actors and resources in the common life of the\nTedre and Pehkonen 9\ncommunity. The older members of the community are not all\nactors in a similar way. Many of them have visible roles in\nseveral communal tasks, as reported in many earlier studies.\nPeople who strive toward \"just being there\" are most evi-\ndently excluded from the idea of being actors in the commu-\nnity setting. Therefore, second, by applying the concept of\nsmall agency, we challenge the social theories' meanings of\nagency as rational and goal-oriented, and aimed at social\nchange in some measurable sense. Small agency refers to\nenduring action with intermittent phases of passivity and\nactivity and reproduction and action. The passive and recep-\ntive phase of actions is important. The concept of small\naction also offers a tool with which to analyze and interpret\nthe communal dimensions of action in the context of home\nand informal, non-organized settings.\nThe case study of this article, rural East Finland and a vil-\nlage with few inhabitants, is a small unit that offers a field in\nwhich to identify communal ties, networks, and social\nresources through an ethnographic research approach. As a\nresult of the study, we find that, in circumstances of urban-\nization, seniors in rural communities form a significant force\nthat both remolds and reproduces the community. They often\nfeel strong responsibility for the future of their own residen-\ntial area and share a common life through a common com-\nmitment to their surroundings.\nThe village community is simultaneously caregiving and\nrational. On one hand, visible and noticeable social action\nshapes and changes the community. On the other hand,\neveryday activities and culturally self-evident action keep\nthe community alive. The latter can be characterized by\nrepetitive and practical daily action without a clear aim to\nchange anything; as such, it can be completely overlooked\nby the community, as well as by rural and social policy or\nresearch. Older villagers' community responsibility is\nexpressed in concrete and symbolic ways.\nIn the context of small agency, we separate some dimen-\nsions of action. The dimensions are not extensive but rather\na preliminary experiment to offer the role of actor to those\nolder community members who, usually in Finnish studies,\nhave been studied as clients in the institutional context of\nwelfare services. One of those dimensions is existence, being\nthere and, as such, being a part of the community. Another\ndimension is their function to repair and fasten the social\nbonds of former villagers to the village community, for\ninstance, by informing them of important events in the vil-\nlage and keeping their homes ready for adult children to visit.\nThe third dimension is the role of mediator, for instance, by\nmediating local knowledge for newcomers. The fourth\ndimension addresses their relationship to their environment.\nThey may act as caretakers of the environment through prac-\ntical, concrete action at home and on their properties.\nThe community is constructed in people's everyday lives.\nMuch everyday action happens in people's homes, which are\nculturally coded as part of the private sphere and are there-\nfore excluded from the analysis of the community. Everyday\naction also continues in nursing homes, which are often\nobserved as segregated units outside their social environ-\nment. This exclusion constructs the ways we think about\ncommunity actions and in turn structures our social reality. A\ncommunity may function as an adhering environment in\nwhich the characterizing feature is that of support.\nIn conclusion, we suggest that although, from the per-\nspective of rural communities, ongoing macro-level social\nprocesses such as urbanization, depopulation, market liber-\nalization, centralization, and their consequent withdrawal\nof services all bring essential social problems to the context\nof rural community, remote-area communities not only try\nto survive but also search for new ways to develop. In addi-\ntion, in Nordic countries, the responsibility of the public\nsector for welfare care services has been strong for decades\nand has also reached fringe areas. This has been especially\ntrue in Finland, where the municipality instead of the state\nhas been the main actor with the responsibility for services.\nIn circumstances where public institutional structures are\nbecoming sparser, the role of community actors grows. A\nsignificant portion of the community actors are older,\nretired people who act for the community in several often\nunidentified and unrecognized ways. This perspective is\nunderestimated in political discussions and even in actor-\nbased social studies of rural areas. Paying attention to\n\"small agency\" enlarges the scope for more adequately rec-\nognizing how older people may make a contribution to\nsociety.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAllardt, E.
