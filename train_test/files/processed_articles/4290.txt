Tones or visual presentations are judged as\nlonger in duration when preceded by click trains than silence (Droit-Volet, 2010; Droit-Volet\n& Wearden, 2002; Penton-Voak, Edwards, Percival, & Wearden, 1996; Treisman, Faulkner,\nNaish, & Brogan, 1990; Wearden, Philpott, & Win, 1999). More recently, it has been shown\nthat magnitude estimations for various dynamic displays are also increased by the prior\npresentation of click trains (Droit-Volet, 2010), and that click trains increase the subjective\nvelocity of moving stimuli (Makin et al., 2012; Makin, Lawson, Bertamini, & Pickering,\n2014). Click trains have also been shown to enhance wider cognitive processing: Jones,\nAllely, and Wearden (2011) demonstrated that click trains can increase the amount of\nmental arithmetic that can be completed within a given duration, and the number of items\nrecalled from a rapid digit presentation.\nCognitive timing mechanisms have been modeled and tested extensively, and the effect of click\ntrains on subjective duration has been considered within these frameworks. According to Scalar\nExpectancy Theory, specific clock, memory, and decision modules produce timed behavior. The\nclock has subcomponents: a pacemaker that emits ``ticks'' at regular intervals and an accumulator,\nwhich stores the number of ticks. When time becomes task relevant, a switch closes and ticks begin\nbriefly consider an example from a typical cognitive timing task. On each trial, the participant is\npresented with a test duration, and then they estimate whether it was longer or shorter than a well-\nlearned standard duration that they have memorized. The pacemaker emits ticks, say at 10Hz.\nWhen the onset of the test stimulus is detected, the switch closes, and ticks start passing from the\npacemaker into the accumulator. When the offset of the test stimulus is detected, the switch opens,\nand the accumulation process is terminated. The final number of ticks in the accumulator is\nproportional to an elapsed duration. This can then be compared with the number of ticks\nassociated with the standard duration in memory, and the decision is made.\nThe rate at which the pacemaker emits ticks is thought to be arousal sensitive, with greater\narousal producing faster output and longer perceptions of duration (Meck, 1983). Indeed,\narousing stimuli, such as fear-inducing images (Droit-Volet & Meck, 2007), pain (Ogden,\nMoore, Redfern, & McGlone, 2015), drugs (Meck, 1983), and increases in body temperature\n(Wearden & Penton-Voak, 1995), elongate subjective duration. One possibility, therefore, is\nthat click trains produce arousal, leading to an increase in pacemaker speed, and a longer\nperceived duration for the stimulus that follows them (Treisman et al., 1990).\nAn alternative suggestion is that click trains speed up the rate at which information is\nprocessed (Jones et al., 2011). It is possible that duration estimates are based on the amount\nof information processed within an interval (Kanai, Paffen, Hogendoorn, & Verstraten,\n2006). Therefore, the effect of clicks on subjective duration could be mediated by effect of\nclicks on information processing rate. Click trains may produce a driven alpha rhythm across\nmany brain areas, and this could be responsible for subsequent alterations in information\nprocessing rate (see Jones et al., 2011 for discussion).\nWhile the effect of click trains on subjective duration and other perceptual judgments is\nwell documented, no research to date has explored whether clicks also influence subjective\npreferences. The idea that click trains could have an effect on preference is plausible. One\npossibility is that clicks influence preference directly (in the same sense that they putatively\nincrease pacemaker speed directly).\nHowever, the effect of clicks on preference could also be mediated indirectly. The\ninfluential fluency hypothesis states that people are sensitive to the efficiency and speed of\ntheir own perceptual and cognitive processes. The feeling of high-processing fluency has\npositive hedonic tone, and this can be attributed to the goodness of the stimuli under\nsome circumstances (Reber, 2012). Clicks increase the amount of information processed\nwithin a duration (Jones et al., 2011), and this enhanced information processing could be\nakin to higher fluency. The greater fluency could then increase liking, as has been repeatedly\nobserved. Another pathway is through arousal. It has long been proposed that arousal is\nrelated to preference (Berlyne, 1971). If clicks increase arousal (as proposed by Treisman\net al., 1990), then they could also alter preferences. In sum, there are at least three\nnonexclusive mechanisms by which clicks could alter preferences (directly, through fluency,\nor arousal), but the basic effect has never been demonstrated.\nExperiment 1\nIn Experiment 1, we presented different auditory stimuli (click trains, silence, or white noise)\nfollowed by checkerboards with a symmetrical configuration. We chose symmetrical stimuli\nbecause they are appealing (e.g., Makin, Pecchinenda, & Bertamini, 2012), and this could\nmake participants engage with the preference task. We asked participants to rate preference\non a 1- to 7-point scale (1 \u00bc unattractive to 7 \u00bc attractive).\nWe manipulated the complexity of the patterns by varying the size and number of\nelements, and the duration of the patterns by varying exposure (0.5, 1, or 1.5 s; Figure 1).\nThis had the advantage of adding variability to the stimuli, but also it allowed us to explore\npossible interactions between sound type and other features that could alter preference. The\neffects of complexity, order, and arousal on aesthetics preference have been well studied\n(although many questions remain, for a recent review see van Tonder & Spehar, 2013), so\nit is possible that the effect of clicks on preference could be moderated by complexity or\nduration of the patterns in a systematic way. Experiment 1 allowed us to explore these\npossibilities.\nMethod\nParticipants. Forty-two participants took part in the experiment (age range 17\u00ad55; 39 right\nhanded; 30 females), and all had normal or corrected to normal vision. They provided a\nwritten consent for taking part and received a reimbursement for their time or course credits.\nThe experiment was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Liverpool and\nwas conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2008).\nStimuli and apparatus. Participants sat in a quiet room at approximately 57 cm of distance from\nthe screen. The sounds were played through Labtec LCS-1021 loud speakers. The visual\n60 Hz. The auditory stimuli consisted of three different sounds played for 4 s prior to the\nvisual pattern: click trains (5 Hz, 16 bits), white noise (16 bits), and silence, the latter was\ndelimitated by two separate clicks (start and end). We included the white noise condition as a\ncontrol because click trains may have a specific effect or simply act like a strong warning cue\nthat the trial is about to start (Penton-Voak et al., 1996). Previous work has repeatedly\ndemonstrated that prestimulus click trains of this type alter subjective duration and other\nperceptual judgments, even when the clicks are not attended (e.g., Droit-Volet, 2010; Jones\nThe stimuli were created in Psychopy software (Peirce, 2007). The visual stimuli consisted\nPalumbo et al. 3\nreflectional symmetry around a vertical axis. The symmetric configuration of the items\nchanged from pattern to pattern, whereas the black and white ratio was the same as to\nkeep luminance and surface area constant (Figure 1). This means that the size of the items\nwas inversely related to numerosity. There were six types of matrices, the difference in\nnumerosity served as a measure of complexity (see Figure 1(a)).\nExperimental design and procedure. We employed a 3 \u00c2 3 \u00c2 6 within-subjects design with as\nfactors sound (clicks, white noise, silence), duration (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 s), and visual complexity\nattractiveness judgment.\nThe experiment started with the instructions followed by the practice (six trials presented\nin random order across participants). As in previous studies, participants were instructed to\nattend to all experimental events but were not instructed to specifically process the clicks\nMakin et al., 2014). Each trial started with a black fixation cross at the center of a gray\nbackground, while one of the three sounds was played for 4 s. After the sound, there was a\nrandomized 0.5 to 1 s delay before the pattern appeared. The symmetric pattern was\ndisplayed for one of the three possible durations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 s). After this, the 7-point\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1. Experiment 1 method. (a) Illustration of the six types of matrices from low complexity (5 \u00c2 5) to\nhigh complexity (30 \u00c2 30).

A symmetrical pattern was presented for one of three possible\ndurations in seconds (0.5, 1.0, 1.5).

Participants\nwere encouraged to take a break at the end of each block. The experiment lasted\napproximately 30 min.\nAnalysis. Mean preference estimates were obtained in each condition for each participant.\nThese data points were then analyzed with a three factor repeated measures analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA). The Greenhouse-Geisser correction factor was applied, when the\nassumption of sphericity was violated. We report partial Z2 values following significant\neffects.\nResults\nThe results are illustrated in Figure 2. Sound type had no effect on preference judgments,\np\n\u00bc .096, Figure 1(b), because patterns were liked more\nThere was no Sound \u00c2 Complexity interaction, no Sound \u00c2 Duration interaction no\nComplexity \u00c2 Duration interaction: (p > .059 in all cases). However, the three-way\ninteraction between Sound \u00c2 Visual Complexity \u00c2 Duration was significant, F(11.33,\np\n\u00bc .065. As shown in Figure 2(h), there were a range of\ndifferent two-factor interactions, some of which were significant. Rather than list all these,\nwe consider the broader research question. Is there a particular subset of conditions where\nclicks have a systematic effect on preference? The answer is no. There is no clear case where\npreference ratings in the clicks condition diverge from the other two sound conditions.\nDiscussion\nAuditory click trains alter several subsequent perceptual magnitude judgments (Droit-Volet,\n2010; Jones, 2014). We tested whether click trains would also alter preference for abstract\nsymmetrical patterns. This potential effect on preference could be mediated directly, through\nincreases in perceptual fluency, or through increased arousal. However, contrary to our\npredictions, we found that auditory click trains had no influence on preference for\nsymmetrical patterns. There was a three-way interaction between sound type, duration,\nand complexity. However, there was clearly no subset of conditions in which clicks had a\nunique effect on preference. This suggests that the effect of click trains is specific to perceptual\nand cognitive processes, and that clicks do not alter evaluations, either directly or indirectly.\nIn Experiment 1, we only obtained preference judgments and just assumed that click\ntrains were having their usual effect on perceptual and cognitive processing. In Experiment\n2, we verified that click trains were indeed having the expected effect on duration by\nobtaining both duration and preference judgments on every trial. This rules out a\npotential explanation for our null results in Experiment 1; it could be that click trains\natypically failed to alter perceptual processes; hence, changes in preference which would\nhave been mediated by the altered perceptual processing failed to occur. Another possible\nexplanation for the null effect of clicks on preference in Experiment 1 was that we only\nPalumbo et al. 5\n(a) (b) (c)\n(d) (e) (f)\n(g) (h) (i)\nFigure 2. Preferences in Experiment 1. Panels a to c show main effects. Panels d to i show various interactions. Although there were some complicated\ntwo-factor interactions, there was no systematic subset of conditions where sound influenced preference.\npresented symmetrical stimuli, which are generally evaluated favorably. This could have\nmasked the effect of click trains.\nThe only significant main effect in Experiment 1 was that of duration. Participants liked\nless the symmetrical stimuli presented for 0.5 s compared with those presented for 1 or 1.5 s\n(Figure 2(b)). In Experiment 2, we reexamined this in more detail. Experiment 2 compared\nsymmetrical and random patterns. It is well known that symmetry is preferred to random,\nand this has been shown with explicit ratings measures like those used in Experiment 1\n(Bertamini, Makin, & Pecchinenda, 2013; Makin et al., 2012). There are many, nonexclusive\nreasons why people like symmetry, including sexual selection (Grammer, Fink, M\u00f8ller, &\nThornhill, 2003), visual relevance (Machilsen, Pauwels, & Wagemans, 2009), or high-\nperceptual fluency (Makin et al., 2012). Why, then, did longer presentation durations\nincreased preference for symmetry in Experiment 1? One explanation is that there was\nmore time for positive evaluations and associations to form. Experiment 2 tested whether\nthis effect is specific to symmetry. It could be that longer durations would enhance the\ndifference between symmetry and random, so the preferred symmetry looks better, and the\ndisliked random patterns look worse. Alternatively, longer presentation durations could lead\nto more positive evaluations in general, both for symmetry and random.\nExperiment 2\nIn Experiment 2, the auditory stimulation (click trains, silence, or white noise) was followed\nby the presentation of symmetric or random patterns, which stayed on screen for one of five\nevery trial. They both judged the appeal of the pattern and its duration. We expected that\noverall, symmetrical patterns would be preferred over the random ones. On the basis of the\nresults of Experiment 1, we also predicted that preference for symmetrical patterns would\nincrease with longer presentation durations. However, we did not know whether this would\ngeneralize to random patterns.\nOn the basis of the results of Experiment 1, we did not expect clicks to have any effect on\npreference in the symmetrical condition. There may, however, be an effect of click trains in\nthe random condition. On the basis of extensive previous literature, we did expect click trains\nto increase perceived duration. This would suggest that the null effect in Experiment 1 could\nnot be attributed to the unusual absence of an influence of click trains on perceptual\nprocesses. Complexity was not manipulated in Experiment 2. Every pattern was a 10 \u00c2 10\nblack and white matrix (Figure 3). Our previous work shows that this kind of image\ncomplexity has no effect on subjective duration (Palumbo, Ogden, Makin, & Bertamini,\nMethod\nParticipants. Twenty-four participants took part in the experiment (age range 19\u00ad25; 2 left\nhanded; 19 females), and all had normal or corrected to normal vision.

As in\nExperiment 1, each trial started with a black fixation cross, showed at the center of a gray\nbackground, while one of the three sounds was played for 4 s. After the sound, there was a\nrandomized 0.5 to 1 s delay before the pattern appeared. Following this, the pattern was\ndisplayed for one of the five possible durations. Participants estimated pattern duration by\nselecting with a mouse click one on a 7-point scale (1 \u00bc short to 7 \u00bc long). As in Experiment 1,\nthey performed the preference task selecting one option on the 7-point scale (1 \u00bc unattractive\nto 7 \u00bc attractive, Figure 3(b)). The order of the duration and preference ratings was\ncounterbalanced across participants. Four blocks of 30 experimental trials, presented in a\nrandomized order, followed the practice. The experimental trials were identical to the practice\nones with the exception that novel patterns were shown. The experiment lasted\napproximately 45 min.\nResults\nDuration estimates. The effects for subjective duration are illustrated in Figure 4. We found\nthat regularity altered subjective duration. Symmetry was judged to have lasted longer than\n(a) (b)\nFigure 3.

A symmetrical or random pattern was presented for one of five possible durations in seconds (0.5, 0.75,\n1.0, 1.25, 1.50). On every trial, participants rated preference for the pattern and estimated pattern durations.\np\n\u00bc .194, Figure 4(a).

Therefore, clicks did not have a unique effect on subjective duration,\nas predicted by previous work. There were no interaction effects (p > .167 in all cases). This is\nimportant because it indicates that there were no differences in the slope relating duration to\nestimated duration in any conditions.\nPreferences. Preference results are shown in Figure 5. There was a main effect of regularity,\np\n\u00bc .778, Figure 5(a), because symmetric patterns were liked more\nthan random patterns. The main effect of duration was also significant, F(4, 92) \u00bc 6.613,\np\n\u00bc .223 because preference increased with duration Figure 5(b). As in\np \u00bc .860, Figure 5(c). The preference for longer presentation durations was found in both\nsymmetry and random conditions: There was no Regularity \u00c2 Duration interaction,\npreexisting valence but make both positive and negative stimuli seem slightly more positive.\nFinally, the three-way interaction between sound, regularity, and duration was also\np\n\u00bc .120. The overall effect of preference for\nsymmetry over random was the dominant effect in all three sound conditions, and at all\nlevels of duration, with some relatively minor fluctuations (Figure 5(d) to (f)). However, there\nwere disparate interactions between sound and duration in the symmetry and random\nconditions, which is shown in Figure 5(g) and (h). As with Experiment 1, there was no\nclear subset of conditions where clicks altered preference systematically. Instead,\npreference ratings from the clicks condition generally lay among those of the silence and\nwhite noise conditions. Figure 5(g) and (h) shows that the increase in preference with\nduration was present in most conditions but was not found in the silence-symmetry\ncondition or in the white noise-random condition.\nDiscussion\nExperiment 2 showed that prior presentation of click trains increased subjective duration, at\nleast compared with silence. This replicates all previous work in this area (Droit-Volet, 2010;\nthere was no effect of auditory stimulation on preference. Experiment 2 thus shows\ndissociation between the effect of clicks on time perception and the effect of clicks on\npreference, even though there are theoretical reasons to expect a similar pattern of results\nin both cases.\nIn Experiment 1, we found that longer presentations led to higher preference ratings:\nExperiment 2 replicated this effect and showed that it was common to both the preferred\nsymmetrical patterns and the disliked random patterns. Therefore, long durations did not\nexaggerate existing preferences, but rather increased liking in both. Preference for symmetry\nover random far outweighed the much smaller effect of duration. This is unsurprising:\nSymmetry is routinely found to be a very strong predictor of explicit and implicit\npreference for abstract patterns (Makin et al., 2012).\nPalumbo et al. 9\n(a) (b) (c)\n(d) (e) (f)\n(g) (h)\nFigure 4.

Panels d to h show various interactions. As with Experiment 1, although there were some\ncomplicated two-factor interactions, there was no systematic subset of conditions where sound influenced preference.\nThere were two unexpected findings involving subjective duration. In most experiments,\nthe absolute size of the click train influence grows with stimulus duration. In other words, the\nslope of the relationship between actual duration and estimated duration is usually steeper in\nthe click train condition than the silence condition. This is often explained by the idea that\nclicks increase the pacemaker speed in a pacemaker-accumulator clock (Penton-Voak et al.,\n1996). However, we did not find these slope effects on duration estimates in Experiment 2.\nAlthough slope effects are typically observed following click trains, and a recent study by\nJones and Ogden (2015) also only observed an additive effect of clicks, indicating that slope\neffects may not be ubiquitous. Second, there was no significant difference between click trains\nand white noise. In previous work, the effect of clicks has been shown to be significantly\ngreater than white noise, while white noise is similar to silence (Makin et al., 2012; Penton-\nVoak et al., 1996). This casts some doubt on the reliability of previous work on click trains\nand temporal judgments. It could be that the dual task of considering duration and\npreference altered the usual pattern of duration estimates (while leaving some effects of\nclicks intact).\nAnother novel result in Experiment 2 was that symmetrical patterns were judged to have\nlasted longer than random ones, as well as being liked more. These two effects may be linked,\nas the time perception literature has reported many variations of subjective time with\nemotional stimuli (Angrilli, Cherubini, Pavese, & Manfredini, 1997; Droit-Volet & Gil,\nincreases subjective duration of symmetry or that the negative valence of random decreases\nthe subjective duration of random, further investigation is warranted.\nConfirming the null hypothesis? Perhaps the predicted effect of clicks on preference would have\nbeen significant if the experiment had greater power? It is notoriously problematic to base\nconclusions on nonsignificant effects. To overcome these traditional limitations, we\nreexamined the effect of clicks using a new Bayesian alternatives to null hypothesis\ntesting (Masson, 2011). These procedures give two probability values, one for the null\nhypothesis and one for the alternative hypothesis (rather than simply a single probability\nfor the observed data given the null hypothesis). In Experiment 1, the null hypothesis that\nthere would not be effect of sound on preference has a probability estimate of 96%.\nConventions are less well established than with convention statistics, but probabilities\nmore than 90% are considered strong, >99% \u00bc very strong. For Experiment 2, the\nsame procedure gives the null hypothesis of probability of 86% and the alternative\nhypothesis a probability of 14%. This approach to statistics supports our claim that\nclicks have no effect on preference. For comparison, we can analyze the known effect\nwhere clicks elevate subjective duration compared with silence. Given the observed data,\nthe null hypothesis is given a probability of only 4.2%, which the alternative hypothesis is\nGeneral discussion\nThere are various intriguing relationships between auditory click trains, temporal judgments,\nsubjective preference, and regularity. Some of these relations are implicit in existing literature,\nwhile others have already been tested. This work fills some gaps in the current empirical\nwork.\nFirst, evaluations of abstract stimuli are often shaped by the perceptual fluency. People\nlike patterns that are more fluently processed. Specifically, perceptual fluency has positive\nhedonic tone, and this positive affect can be attributed to the stimuli under some conditions\n(Reber, 2012). Perceptual fluency has been operationalized as faster detection speed, and\nabstract patterns that are detected quicker are usually those that are preferred (Makin\nPrior presentation of auditory click trains may increase perceptual fluency. Clicks (5 Hz\nfor 3\u00ad5 s) have been shown to increase the amount of information processing that can occur\nwithin a given duration and increase subjective duration. We hypothesized that such click\ntrains should increase liking of abstract patterns. However, this was not found in\nExperiments 1 or 2. This is despite the fact that the clicks did increase the subjective\nduration of the same stimuli in Experiment 2. Therefore, although the hypothesis that\nclicks should increase preferences had prior plausibility, it was not confirmed. Perhaps the\nmagnitude of the increase in perceptual fluency caused by click trains was not strong enough\nto alter preference, or perhaps, for some reason, perceptual fluency was not attributed to the\nmerits of the stimuli in this case. We also reasoned that clicks might produce arousal, which\ncould also have knock on effects on preference judgments (Treisman et al., 1990, Berlyne,\n1971). Clearly this did not occur either.\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that some other type of repetitive stimuli could have\naltered preferences, even though our auditory click trains did not. Our clicks were 5 Hz and\nlasted 4 s, while participants did not explicitly have to process the clicks. These parameters\nwere very similar to those used in numerous interval-timing tasks, where positive effects of\nclicks on subjective duration have been reported (e.g., Droit-Volet, 2010; Jones et al., 2011;\nTreisman et al., 1990, Penton-Voak et al., 1996). However, it is possible that clicks of\ndifferent frequency, duration, or task relevance could alter preference. Third, it is known\nthat cross-modal attentional division can influence elements of visual processing (e.g.,\nbinocular rivalry, Alais, van Boxtel, Parker, & van Ee, 2010). Therefore, we cannot\nexclude that the use of a repetitive visual (rather than auditory) prestimulus would have\naltered preferences in our experiment. Some of these possibilities will have to be tested in\nfuture work.\nThe most influential work on interval timing literature has concluded that white noise has\nno effect on subjective duration, and that the effects of clicks on subjective duration are\nmultiplicative, growing with stimulus duration (e.g., Penton-Voak et al., 1996). Duration\nestimates in our Experiment 2 were not consistent with either claim. We found no slope\neffect and no significant difference between clicks and white noise. Do these apparent\nanomalies mean that the data set cannot be the basis for solid conclusions? We think not.\nFirst, the slope effect for clicks on duration has not always been replicated (Jones & Ogden,\n2015). Second, the absence of a click effect on preference was replicated in Experiments 1\nand 2, so this cannot be dismissed as an anomaly. Third, the ambiguities about white noise\nand subjective duration do alter any of our conclusions about clicks and preference. At worst,\nwhite noise might alter subjective duration, and there might be nothing special about clicks.\nThat would indeed challenge some earlier conclusions about the unique effect of repetitive\nprestimulation on perceptual judgments. However, it would not challenge our conclusion\nthat repetitive prestimulation has no effect on preference for abstract patterns.\nDespite the null effect of clicks on preference, this work produced other novel results. Both\nexperiments found that stimuli that were presented longer were preferred. This was true for\nsymmetrical patterns in Experiment 1 and for both symmetrical and random patterns in\nExperiment 2. The effect of duration on preference was not an amplification effect, where\nexisting valence is exaggerated (Albrecht & Carbon, 2014). Instead, it seems that longer\npresentations are preferred uniformly. We hypothesize that having longer to process the\nstimuli is in itself rewarding, independently of stimulus valence.\nSymmetrical patterns were judged to have lasted longer than random patterns. We can ask\nwhich module of this internal clock is responsible for this? As stated above, anything that\nalters pacemaker speed should produce different duration versus estimated duration slopes\n(Penton-Voak et al., 1996). However, this was not found, the slopes were similar in the\nsymmetry and random conditions. This suggests symmetry and random presentations do\nnot result in differential pacemaker speeds. Instead, it could be that the switch connected\nthe pacemaker to the accumulator opened later in the random condition because attention\nwas briefly focused away from time in this condition. Either would reduce the number of\naccumulated ticks in the random condition, resulting in the observed effect. Dual tasks have\nbeen shown to alter temporal judgments (Zakay, 1998): When attention is shifted to other\ntasks, subjective duration reduces, while when people attend to duration alone subjective\nduration increases (Macar, Grondin, & Casini, 1994). It could be that presentation of the\nrandom patterns shifted attention away from the timing task, so subjective duration was\nreduced, or equally, we could say, presentation of symmetrical patterns, which were\nprocessed with relative ease, allowed attention to remain on the timing task, so subjective\nduration was increased.\nIn summary, we have investigated several hypotheses implicit in the current literature on\ntiming and symmetry perception. Despite prior plausibility, the presentation of auditory click\ntrains does not increase preference for subsequently presented abstract patterns, even though\nthe clicks do increase the perceived duration of the same patterns. We have, however, shown\nthat preferred (symmetrical) patterns appear to have been presented for slightly longer than\nless preferred (random) patterns, and then longer presentation duration slightly increases\npreference. Subjective time and preference are intimately connected in the human brain,\nbut not all plausible links are empirically demonstrable.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or\npublication of this article: We would like to thank the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC,\nRef.
