    "abstract": "Abstract\nBackground. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is common among cancer patients, but the majority of\nCAM studies do not specify the time periods in relation to cancer diagnoses. We sought to define CAM use by cancer\npatients and investigate factors that might influence changes in CAM use in relation to cancer diagnoses. Methods. We\nconducted a cross-sectional survey of adults diagnosed with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer between 2010 and\n2012 at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Questionnaires were sent to 1794 patients. Phone calls were made to\nnonrespondents. Log binomial/Poisson regressions were used to investigate the association between cancer-related changes\nin CAM use and conversations about CAM use with oncology providers. Results. We received 603 (33.6 %) completed\nquestionnaires. The mean age (SD) was 64 (11) years; 62% were female; 79% were white; and 98% were non-Hispanic.\nRespondents reported the following cancer types: breast (47%), prostate (27%), colorectal (14%), lung (11%). Eighty-nine\npercent reported lifetime CAM use. Eighty-five percent reported CAM use during or after initial cancer treatment, with\ncategory-specific use as follows: mind-body medicine 39%, dietary supplements 73%, body-based therapies 30%, and energy\nmedicine 49%. During treatment CAM use decreased for all categories except energy medicine. After treatment CAM\nuse returned to pretreatment levels for most CAMs except chiropractic. Initiation of CAM use after cancer diagnosis\nwas positively associated with a patient having a conversation about CAM use with their oncology provider, mainly\ndriven by patient-initiated conversations. Conclusions. Consistent with previous studies, CAM use was common among our\nstudy population. Conversations about CAM use with oncology providers appeared to influence cessation of mind-body\nmedicine use after cancer diagnosis.\n",

When\nthis information is combined with information on patient-pro-\nvider communication, it can provide insight into the role of\npatient-provider communication in cancer patients'CAM use.\nUsing a questionnaire-based survey, we aimed to yield\npoint estimates of CAM use among adult cancer patients\ntreated in the past 2 years with the 4 most common cancers:\nbreast, lung, prostate, or colorectal. Specifically, we assessed\nCAM in the following 3 time periods: before, during, and\nafter initial cancer treatment in order to identify cancer-related\nchanges in CAM use. We also investigated the communica-\ntion patterns between patients and oncology providers and\nhow that was associated with cancer-related CAM change.\nMethods\nStudy Population\nWe conducted a cross-sectional survey of adult cancer\npatients seeking care at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital\nwere English-speaking, between 21 and 99 years of age,\nand diagnosed with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal\nfied from the University of North Carolina (UNC) Tumor\nRegistry, which is a comprehensive database of patients\ndiagnosed with cancer at the NCCH, the clinical home of\nthe Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC).\nPotential participants were mailed an introductory letter,\nquestionnaire, and a return-postage envelope. Follow-up\ntelephone call and a second questionnaire were sent to non-\nrespondents. We made up to 3 attempts to contact patients\nby telephone. The Institutional Review Board at UNC\napproved the research protocol, and all study participants\ngave informed consent.\nData Collection\nWe adapted a questionnaire used by Richardson etal11 to\nassess CAM use at a comprehensive cancer center. We asked\nabout CAM use in 4 primary categories: mind-body medi-\ncine, dietary supplements, body-based therapies, and energy\nmedicine. We also queried use of whole medical systems\nsuch as traditional Chinese medicine and ayurveda.\nRespondents were asked to indicate whether they had ever\nused specific CAM therapies in each of these categories, and\nif so, when that use occurred in relation to their initial cancer\ntreatment (ie, before, during, or after). Information on sources\nof advice on CAM use and discussion of CAM use with\noncology providers was also gathered. The questionnaire was\npilot-tested on volunteers for readability and face validity.\nThe tumor registry provided demographic and clinical data\nsuch as diagnosis date, tumor type and stage, and treatment\nhistory.\nStatistical Analysis\nWe provide descriptive data for age, sex, as well as cancer\ntype and stage, in addition to prevalence of CAM use (fre-\nquency, percentage). Patients with stage 0 and stage 1 can-\ncers were combined into an \"early-stage cancer\" group\nbecause of their prognostic and treatment similarities when\ncompared with later-stage cancers.\nWe used log-binomial and Poisson regression to investi-\ngate how communication of CAM was associated with\nchanges in CAM use after cancer diagnosis. For all regres-\nsions, we started with the full model that included variables\nsuch as age, education level, cancer type and cancer stage,\nand ran backward elimination to come up with the most\nsuccinct model (likelihood ratio test cutoff P = .05). All\nbreast cancer cases were female, all prostate cancer cases\nwere male, so following previous studies, we did not adjust\nfor sex in these regressions.4 The analyses were performed\nusing Stata IC Version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).\nResults\ncompleted questionnaires. The mean age of respondents\nwere female, 79% were white, and 98% were non-Hispanic.\nCompared with nonrespondents, respondents were more\nEighty-nine percent of respondents reported ever using a\nCAM therapy during their lifetime. CAM use appeared to\ndecrease during active cancer treatment compared with use\nprior to treatment for all CAM categories except energy\nmedicine, which was largely driven by prayer and spiritual\nhealing practices (Figure 1). CAM use was common both\nduring and after cancer treatment for all CAM therapy cat-\negories. The most common therapies used included: vita-\nmin and mineral supplements (56% and 66%, during and\nafter treatment, respectively); prayer and spiritual healing\nsage and movement therapy (16% and 24%); and deep\nbreathing exercises (16% and 19%). Use of CAM therapies\nafter treatment returned to pretreatment levels for most\nCAMs with the exception of chiropractic, which dropped\nduring active treatment and remained low after treatment\nIn the periods after cancer diagnosis (ie, during and after\ncancer treatment), 85% of respondents reported using at\nleast one CAM therapy. CAM use was most common\namong breast cancer patients (93%), followed by colorectal\nTable 2). For patients of each of the 4 cancer types, dietary\nsupplements were the most commonly used CAM modality\nmind-body medicine (16% to 52%), and body-based ther-\nMost patients who used CAM therapy during or after\ncancer treatment were likely to use more than 1 CAM ther-\napy simultaneously (58%; Table 3).

Initiation of CAM use any time after\ncancer diagnosis was positively associated with a patient\nhaving a conversation about CAM use with their oncology\nprovider (Table 4). Further analysis revealed the increased\nlikelihood of new CAM use was more driven by patient-\nprovider interactions in which patients initiated conversa-\ntion about CAM, rather than CAM conversations initiated\nby cancer care provider (data not shown). Cessation of\nCAM therapy use during or after initial cancer treatment, on\nthe other hand, was negatively associated with patient-pro-\nvider conversation for MBM (prevalence ratio = 0.46, 95%\nconversations with providers were less likely to cease MBM\ntherapies during or after initial cancer treatment. We found\nno association between cancer type and either initiation or\ncessation of CAM use. We found no association between\nmore advanced cancer stage and number of CAM therapies.\nWe found no association between the type of treatment and\nCAM use or change (initiation and cessation) in CAM use\nsince diagnosis.\nDiscussion\nWe set out to describe CAM use among cancer patients, as\nwell as the communication pattern between patients and\nprovider and its association with patients' CAM use. We\ncollected data on CAM use before, during, and after initial\ncancer treatment using a cancer patient sample at University\nof North Carolina Cancer Hospital, which allowed us to\ninvestigate changes in CAM use over time. We had data for\ndiscrete time periods related to time of diagnosis, which\nhelped us understand CAM use before, during, and after\ntreatment.\nWe found high lifetime CAM use (89%) in our popula-\ntion. The response rate is slightly higher among breast can-\ncer patients, a subgroup that is known to use CAM therapies\nmore than patients of other cancer types. Nevertheless, this\nprevalence is similar compared to previous studies in can-\ncer patients used at least 1 CAM therapy. Yates etal12 found\nCAM use as high as 91% among cancer patients during che-\nmotherapy and radiation. However, differences in the defi-\nnition of CAM modalities for each study may confound\ncomparison of these prevalence estimates. For example,\nYates etal12 found that \"prayer,\" \"relaxation,\" and \"exer-\ncise\" were the most commonly used CAM therapies. But,\nour question about prayer defined the activity as \"prayer for\nhealing\" rather than a general question about any prayer.\nNot surprisingly, our estimates for prayer were lower than\nSimilarly, we asked about specific exercises such as T'ai\nchi, Qiqong, and yoga, rather than a general question about\nexercise. Accordingly, we found that during initial cancer\ntreatment, dietary supplements, not prayer or exercise, were\nthe most common CAM therapy used, followed by energy\nmedicine (in which prayer is the main driver), and then\nmind-body medicine, and body-based therapies. Dietary\nsupplements have been reported to be the most common\nCAM therapy in a few other studies, including one study\nWe found that CAM use generally decreased during\nactive cancer treatment compared with use prior to diagno-\nsis and returned to pretreatment levels after completion of\ncancer treatment. Notable exceptions to this trend were sus-\ntained levels of prayer, spiritual healing, deep breathing\nexercise, and light/magnet therapy during cancer treatment.\nThe reason for the decrease of CAM use during cancer\ntreatment may be 2-fold. First, doctors and health providers\nmight have spoken to patients and advised against CAM\nuse, although in our study we did not collect data on whether\nthe doctor recommended for or against CAM use. Second,\nwhen patients are diagnosed with cancer and start the sub-\nsequent counseling and treatment, the process is complex\nand cognitively taxing for the patients. Such large cognitive\nload and high volume of complex decision making have\nTable 1.

A similar pattern across cancer types is also\nseen in a few other studies.

Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy use before, during, and after active cancer treatment (N = 603).\nEach graph depicts total proportion of participants that used at least one therapy for that category of CAM therapy (diamond lines).\nProportions for individual CAM therapies are represented in the lower lines. For example, during cancer treatment, about 59% of our\npopulation reported taking a dietary supplement (Figure 1b). Almost all participants who reported taking a supplement took a vitamin\nor mineral supplement (square line), and about 44% (0.26/0.59) reported taking an herbal or other type of supplement (triangle line).\nduring and after treatment, followed by lung cancer patients\nWe found that initiation of CAM therapy across all four\nCAM categories during and after cancer treatment was pos-\nitively associated with having a conversation about CAM\nwith an oncology provider. Although we do not have infor-\nmation on the content of those conversations, our data show\nthat patients who initiated a conversation with their medical\nprovider about CAM use were also more likely to initiate\nnew CAM use after diagnosis. Although it is possible that\nsome oncology providers may have been suggesting use of\nsome CAM therapies, it is more likely that patients who\nwere motivated to discuss CAM therapies with their provid-\ners were also strongly motivated to use them prior to their\ndiscussions.\nOur findings have implications for communications\nbetween oncology providers and cancer patients. First,\npatients who initiate a conversation about CAM are more\nlikely to initiate CAM use. In their communications about\nCAM therapies with providers, patients often recognize that\nmedical providers are typically not CAM experts and they\nare especially concerned about negative responses from\ntheir providers.18 While most cancer patients use CAM in\norder to boost the immune system, relieve pain, and control\nside effects as a result of disease or treatment,19 they are\ntypically looking for the best of both worlds: CAM plus\nconventional cancer treatment together.20 However, nondis-\nclosure of CAM use to cancer care providers remains com-\nmon.18,21 Given the high prevalence of CAM use among\ncancer patients, emerging evidence that certain CAM thera-\npies can improve patient quality of life and reduce treatment\nand disease-related symptoms, and the potential interaction\nbetween some CAM therapies and conventional cancer\ntreatment, we encourage oncology providers to discuss\nCAM use with their patients in an open and nonjudgmental\nfashion in order to facilitate patient-centered communica-\ntion as well as participatory patient decision making.22\nSecond, if oncology providers wish to influence their\npatient's decisions about CAM use, they may need to use\nadditional strategies and resources to help them. For exam-\nple, recommendations about specific dietary supplement-\ndrug interactions may be more persuasive for patients\ncompared to general recommendations to avoid supple-\nments altogether during treatment. Where oncologists do\nnot have such expertise, cancer centers could employ phar-\nmacy and CAM specialists who are trained to discuss sup-\nplement-drug interactions.\nLimitations\nOur response rate was low, which may bias our prevalence\nestimates for overall CAM use. However, the rate of CAM\nuse among respondents was very high, suggesting that our\nsample may have included most of the CAM users among\nour patient population. As such, the information we have on\ncommunication among CAM users remains relevant, espe-\ncially for the early stage cancers were the response rates\nwere highest.Additionally, we can estimate CAM use preva-\nlence using sensitivity analysis. For example, assuming that\nTable 3. Number of Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nTherapies Used During or After Cancer Treatment.\nCancer Type\nNumber of Therapies Used, n (%)\nTable 4.
