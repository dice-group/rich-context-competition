In this study, we examined whether racial segregation is associated with poorer self-rated health among\nolder adults, and whether racial segregation helps explain race disparities in self-rated health between Black and White\nolder adults.\nMethods. We used multilevel data at the individual, neighborhood (tract), and county levels, from two national\nsurveys--the Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) survey and the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH).\nWe used hierarchical linear models in order to regress self-rated health on county-, neighborhood-, and individual-level\nracial and socioeconomic variables.\nResults. In the NSFH, there was an association between county racial segregation and poorer self-rated health among\nWhite but not Black older adults (net of county percent Black and percent poverty). In the ACL, there was no statistically\nsignificant association between racial segregation and self-rated health. In the NSFH, there was some indication that\nBlack older adults had better self-rated health when living in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of Black residents\nthan the county percentage.\nDiscussion. Although aggregate-level studies demonstrate associations between racial segregation and mortality rates,\nour multilevel analyses with two national data sets suggest only weak associations between racial segregation and self-\nrated health. However, socioeconomic status at multiple levels contributes to race disparities in health.\nBLACK older adults generally have worse health than do\nWhite older adults (Bulatao & Anderson, 2004), and this\ndisparity is often only partly mediated by individual socioeco-\nnomic status (SES; Clark & Maddox, 1992; Crimmins,\nRobert & Lee, 2002). Multilevel research on neighborhood\ncontext and health has demonstrated that the average lower\nsocioeconomic neighborhood context of Black older adults con-\ntributes further to race disparities in health (Cagney, Brown-\ning, & Wen, 2005; Robert & Lee). Although there is a growing\nbody of literature that examines the association between\nneighborhood or community context and health among older\nRobert & Lee; Robert & Li, 2001; Wen, Cagney, & Christakis,\n2005), most of this research focuses on the socioeconomic\nrather than the racial context of neighborhoods. Moreover,\nalthough racial residential segregation in the United States is\nconsiderable and enduring (Fischer, 2003; Massey & Denton,\n1993), we found no multilevel research that has explicitly\ninvestigated the role of racial residential segregation as a factor\nthat might help explain race disparities in health among older\nadults. The purpose of this study was to examine whether racial\nresidential segregation was associated with poorer self-rated\nhealth among older adults in the United States, and whether\nracial residential segregation helped explain race disparities in\nself-rated health between Black and White older adults.\nRacial residential segregation (hereafter ``racial segrega-\ntion'') refers to the differential distribution of individuals of\ndifferent races across smaller residential units (e.g., census\ntracts) within a larger geographical unit (e.g., a city, county, or\nmetropolitan area; Massey & Denton, 1988b). Research has\nshown that racial segregation produces and reinforces the\neconomic segregation of Black people in the United States\nWilson, 1987). As a result of racial segregation, Black people\nand White people live in very different community contexts.\nFor example, not only are Black people more likely than White\npeople to live in lower socioeconomic communities, but Black\npeople are more likely than White people of the same income\nlevel to live in lower socioeconomic communities (Jargowsky).\nResearch has demonstrated that various measures of racial\nsegregation are associated with high rates of poverty, crime,\nhomicide, dropping out of high school, and unemployment, as\nwell as with lower rates of community participation (Peterson\nof these neighborhood factors are associated with health.\nHowever, few researchers have explicitly examined whether\nliving in racially segregated neighborhoods is associated with\npoorer health.\nResearchers theorize that racial segregation affects health\nthrough two general pathways (Acevedo-Garcia, Lochner,\nIsrael, & Lempert, 2002). First, racial segregation can reinforce\nracial differences in opportunity structures and access to re-\nsources that more proximately affect health (structural path-\nways),affectingtheeducation,occupation,economic,andservice\nopportunities in neighborhoods and for individuals. Among\nthe current cohort(s) of older adults who have experienced\na lifetime of exposure to racial residential segregation, these\nstructural pathways may have both a cumulative effect across\nthe life course, and a contemporaneous effect (e.g., quality of\nJournal of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES Copyright 2006 by The Gerontological Society of America\nand access to health, social, and transportation services,\naccessible and high quality markets, safe places to walk).\nSecond, racial segregation may create an environment that\nheightens exposure to and perceptions of discrimination,\nwhich can affect stress and other psychosocial factors that\nare more proximal determinants of health (interpersonal path-\nways). In addition, causation can work the other way, such\nthat people in poorer health may be more likely to move into\n(or, more plausibly, less likely to move out of) highly\nsegregated neighborhoods. Regardless of causality, both\nscenarios suggest an aggregate association between racial\nsegregation and health.\nResearch using aggregate-level data shows that metropolitan\nareas with higher racial segregation have higher adult and infant\nhave primarily examined mortality rates, but not other measures\nof health; investigators have not examined age-specific trends\namong adults. Moreover, multilevel studies are necessary in\norder to extend beyond aggregate-level findings (Acevedo-\nGarcia et al., 2003). For example, multilevel studies can\nexamine whether the relationship between racial segregation\nand health (a) exists for both Black and White residents and for\nresidents with other specific characteristics (e.g., age, SES); (b)\noperates through specific neighborhood and individual path-\nways; and (c) exists net of neighborhood and individual\nsocioeconomic and other factors.\nOne recent study conducted a multilevel analysis with data\nat both the individual and metropolitan statistical area (MSA)\nlevels. Subramanian, Acevedo-Garcia, and Osypuk (2005)\nexamined racial segregation and self-rated health by using the\nMarch 2000 supplement of the Current Population Survey,\nwhich included a sample of more than 50,000 non-Hispanic\nWhite and Black adults residing in MSAs throughout the\nUnited States. Despite this large, comprehensive sample, they\nfound only a weak association between racial segregation at\nthe MSA level and poor self-rated health, net of age, gender,\nmarital status, education, income, and race. Subramanian and\ncolleagues examined two measures of racial segregation at the\nMSA level that are the most commonly used in the racial\nsegregation literature (Acevedo-Garcia et al., 2003): the\nDissimilarity Index and the Isolation Index. The Dissimilarity\nIndex measures residential unevenness between two groups,\nand the Isolation Index measures the probability that a minority\ngroup member will come into contact with a majority group\nmember. They found no statistically significant relationship\nbetween the Dissimilarity Index and health, or between White\nisolation and health. They did find a statistically significant\nassociation between high Black isolation and poor health\namong Black residents, but the magnitude was very small.\nThese multilevel analyses suggest a weaker association\nbetween racial segregation and self-rated health than had been\nsuggested by previous aggregate-level analyses.\nReplication of such multilevel analyses is necessary.\nMoreover, as Subramanian and colleagues (2005) suggested,\nfuture studies should examine multilevel data not only at the\nmetropolitan and individual level, but at the intermediary\nneighborhood level as well. Although living in a metropolitan\narea with greater racial segregation might be associated with\npoorer health, it is unclear whether that relationship is similar\nacross the neighborhoods within the metropolitan area. It is\nlikely that among people living in a highly segregated\nmetropolitan area, living in a neighborhood with a high\npercentage of Black residents is a different experience than\nliving in a neighborhood with few Black residents. Yet without\nneighborhood-level data, models assume that the average health\neffects of living in a more highly segregated MSA are the same\nacross all residents in all neighborhoods in a particular MSA.\nOur study rectifies these issues by using multilevel data at the\nindividual, neighborhood, and county level, from two national\nsurveys of adults in the United States, in order to examine the\nassociation between racial segregation and self-rated health\namong Black and White older adults. We examined whether\nracial segregation at the county level was associated with self-\nrated health for both Black and White older adults, net of\ncounty poverty, racial composition, and individual SES.\nMoreover, we extend research in this area by having examined\nwhether the racial composition of one's neighborhood, when\ncompared with the racial composition of the county, is\nassociated with self-rated health. We also tested whether the\nBlack disadvantage in self-rated health was partly explained\nby neighborhood- and county-level racial segregation, racial\ncomposition, and poverty.\nOur three primary hypotheses were:\nH1: Living in counties with greater racial residential segrega-\ntion is associated with lower self-rated health for both\nBlack and White older adults.\nH2: The greater the percentage of Black residents in\none's neighborhood, in comparison to the percentage of\nBlack residents in one's county, the worse health one is\nlikely to report.\nH3: The Black disadvantage in self-rated health is partly ex-\nplained by neighborhood- and county-level racial segre-\ngation, racial composition, and poverty status.\nMETHODS\nWe used two nationally representative samples of adults.\nIndividual-level data came from the first waves of two U.S.\nsurveys: the Americans' Changing Lives (ACL) 1986 survey\n(House, 1989) and the National Survey of Families and\nCall, 1988). Based on respondents' addresses at Wave 1, we\nmerged characteristics of their census tracts and counties from\nACL Data\nResearchers conducted Wave 1 of the ACL in 1986 through\na multistage, stratified area probability sample of noninstitu-\ntionalized adults aged 25 and older. Black people and people\naged 60 and older were oversampled. The household response\nrate was 70%. We restricted this sample to respondents aged 60\nand older, eliminated 24 respondents whose self-rated race was\nneither Black nor White, excluded rural counties, and\neliminated 7 urban and suburban counties with missing data\non racial segregation, resulting in a final sample of 1,095\nurban counties.\nthrough face-to-face interviews with 13,007 adults (Sweet,\nBumpass, & Call, 1988) from a multistage, area probability\nsample of noninstitutionalized adults aged 19 and older. Black\npeople, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, single parents,\nstepparents, cohabitors, and recently married persons were\noversampled. The Wave 1 response rate was 74%. We\nrestricted this sample to respondents aged 60 and older,\neliminated 126 respondents whose self-rated race was neither\nBlack nor White, excluded rural counties, and removed\nrespondents with missing data on age, race, education, self-\nrated health, and county-level racial segregation, resulting in\nIndividual-Level Variables\nSelf reported health, our dependent variable, is a multidi-\nmensional and subjective measure of health that has been\nshown to reliably predict mortality and morbidity after\ncontrolling for health risk factors (Idler & Benyamini, 1997;\nIdler & Kasl, 1995). Although Blacks and Whites and the old-\nold and young-old report their health differently, research has\nshown that self-rated health predicts mortality for these groups\nboth the NSFH and ACL asked about self-rated health, using\nslightly different wording and response choices. ACL respon-\ndents were asked: ``How would you rate your health at the\npresent time?'' Response categories were: excellent, very good,\ngood, fair, or poor. NSFH respondents were asked: ``Compared\nwith other people your age, how would you describe your\nhealth?'' Response categories were: excellent, good, fair, poor,\nor very poor. In order to make items more comparable, we\nrecoded them into four categories for each data set. We coded\nNSFH self-rated health reports as 1 \u00bc excellent, 2 \u00bc good, 3 \u00bc\nfair, and 4\u00bcpoor or very poor. We coded ACL self-rated health\nreports as 1 \u00bc excellent, 2 \u00bc very good or good, 3 \u00bc fair, and\nWe included age (years) and gender as controls in all\nanalyses. We coded education in years of education. We used\nfamily income for ACL respondents and household income for\nNSFH respondents. Annual income is a categorical variable:\nwe included a missing income dummy; missing data for the\nACL had previously been imputed via a regression prediction\nequation (House, 1989). We coded financial assets as a dummy\nvariable comparing individuals with $10,000 or more, those\nwith less than $10,000 (reference category), and those with\nmissing assets data. For analyses, we centered continuous\nvariables at their grand means.\nCounty-Level Variables\nWe included three county-level variables: racial segregation,\nracial composition, and percent poverty. Massey and Denton\n(1988b) classified racial segregation indices into five dimen-\nsions: evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and\nclustering. Much of the research on racial segregation in the\npast two decades, particularly that focusing on health, has used\neither the Dissimilarity Index (to measure evenness) or the\nIsolation Index (to measure exposure). We initially used both\nthe Dissimilarity Index and the Isolation Index, though we\npresent here just the results for the Dissimilarity Index because\nthe results were similar with both measures. The Dissimilarity\nIndex measures the level of residential unevenness between two\ngroups (James & Taeuber, 1985). It indicates the proportion of\nBlacks that would have to move to a White-dominated census\ntract in order for the races to be evenly distributed through-\nout the county. A higher value indicates higher levels of\nsegregation. In preliminary analyses, the Dissimilarity Index\nhad a nonlinear association with self-rated health that varied\nbetween data sets. Therefore, we coded the Dissimilarity Index\nin quartiles in order to capture nonlinearities. We compared the\n25% of people in the most segregated counties (the omitted\nquartile with the highest dissimilarity scores) with those people\nin each of the less segregated quartiles. For race-specific\nanalyses, we used race-specific dissimilarity quartiles in order\nto examine the association between residential segregation and\nself-rated health among Black or among White older adults.\nWe also included the percentage of Black people in a county\n(% Black) as a measure of racial composition. Percent Black\nis itself not a measure of racial segregation because counties\nwith the same percentage of Black residents may have those\nresidents distributed very differently across the county.\nCounties with relatively few Black people may be very\nsegregated just as counties with many Black people may be\nvery segregated. Though not a measure of racial segregation per\nse, racial composition of counties is a measure of racial context\nin its own right (Massey, Condran & Denton, 1987) that may be\nrelated to health. Regardless of segregation, communities with\nhigher percent Black may have overall worse average health.\nFinally, we also included a continuous, centered, indicator of\npercentage of households in poverty in the county.\nTract-Level Variables\nWe included two tract-level variables: percentage of house-\nholds in poverty (percent poverty) and neighborhood racial\ndifference. Whereas the county-level dissimilarity measure\nindicates whether a person lives in a county with overall higher\nor lower segregation, it does not indicate where in that county\na person lives (e.g., in a neighborhood with a high, average, or\nlow percentage of Black residents). It is likely that living in\na more segregated county does not affect everyone equally.\nLiving in a county with high racial segregation might be more\ndetrimental to those living in a neighborhood with a higher\npercentage of Black residents. We calculated neighborhood\nracial difference by subtracting the percent Black in one's\ncounty from the percent Black in one's tract. Respondents with\na score greater than 0 live in a neighborhood with a greater\npercentage of Black people than the overall percentage in the\ncounty, and those with a negative score live in a neighborhood\nwith a lower percentage of Black people than the overall\npercentage in the county. (We did not center this variable as we\nhad with other continuous variables.) The greater the score, the\ngreater the Black racial concentration of one's neighborhood in\ncomparison with the county. Our research contributes signifi-\ncantly to the literature by computing neighborhood racial\ndifference in order to test whether the gap between racial\ncomposition at the neighborhood and county levels is as-\nsociated with self-rated health.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe weighted the data in order to correct for sample selection\nprobabilities and nonresponse, which resulted in weighted\nsamples that approximated the distribution of the demographic\ncomposition of the U.S. adult population during the first wave\nof interviews. We centered weights to the size of the sample for\neach race subsample. Because of the multilevel nature of our\nquestions, as well as the clustering of individuals within\ncounties and communities, we used SAS PROC MIXED in\norder to conduct iterative maximum likelihood estimation\nregression analyses (SAS Institute, 1996). We present fixed\neffect coefficients for independent variables at the individual\nand county, or individual and neighborhood (tract) levels while\nadjusting for random intercepts between counties or neighbor-\nRESULTS\nTables 1 and 2 present descriptive statistics for the NSFH\nand the ACL, respectively, showing distributions for the full\nsample, Black sample, and White sample.\nTables 3 and 4 present data from the test of our first\nhypothesis, namely that living in counties with greater racial\nresidential segregation is associated with lower self-rated health\nfor both Black and White older adults. In Table 3, Model 1\ndemonstrates that among older adults in the NSFH, respondents\nliving in counties with the greatest dissimilarity (4th quartile,\nomitted here) had worse self-rated health than respondents\nliving in counties categorized in the 2nd and 3rd quartiles of the\nDissimilarity Index, controlling only for individual age and\ngender. For example, people living in a county with\na Dissimilarity Index in the 3rd quartile had a self-rated health\nscore .167 units better than those living in the most racially\nsegregated counties (Dissimilarity Index in the 4th quartile).\nModel 2 demonstrates that once the county-level percent Black\nwas added to the model, there was no longer a statistically\nsignificant association between racial segregation and self-rated\nhealth. This suggests that it is not necessarily county racial\nsegregation that is associated with health, but rather higher\nBlack population composition, regardless of the racial residen-\ntial distribution within the county. However, adding respond-\nents' race into Model 3 eliminated the statistically significant\nassociation between county-level percent Black and self-rated\nhealth. Black older adults had worse self-rated health than\nWhite older adults, regardless of the racial segregation or\ncomposition of the county, but racial segregation and\ncomposition no longer had independent associations with\nself-rated health. Model 4 adds county-level percent poverty\nand demonstrates that people living in counties with greater\npoverty had worse health, even net of race, age, gender, racial\nsegregation, and racial composition. Note that county-level\npoverty only slightly reduced race differences in self-rated\nhealth. In Model 5, adding individual-level SES variables\n(income, education, and assets) eliminated the association\nbetween county-level poverty and self-rated health.\nTable 1.

Table 4, Model 1 shows no statistically\nsignificant association between racial segregation and self-rated\nhealth. Model 2 shows no association between racial compo-\nsition and self-rated health. Model 3 demonstrates that there\nwas no statistically significant racial disparity in self-rated\nhealth. However, as with the NSFH, Model 4 shows that\na greater county-level percent poverty was associated with\nworse self-rated health. In contrast to the results for the NSFH,\nthis association remained statistically significant after control-\nling for individual-level SES in Model 5.\nAs a whole, results from Tables 3 and 4 provided little\nsupport for the hypothesis that racial segregation is associated\nwith self-rated health among older adults in the United States,\nregardless of race. In preliminary analyses (not shown), we also\nexamined MSA-level (instead of county-level) Dissimilarity\nIndex in the ACL sample and found that there was no\nassociation between the MSA-level Dissimilarity Index and\nself-rated health. However, Tables 5 and 6 now describe race-\nspecific models. Table 5 indicates that the slight association\nbetween racial segregation and health noted earlier was found\nonly among White older adults. Model 1 shows that White older\nadults living in counties with the most racial segregation (4th\nquartile of Dissimilarity Index) had a self-rated health score .167\nunits worse than that of people in the 3rd quartile on the\nDissimilarity Index, net of county-level percent Black, percent\npoverty, and individual age and gender. This association was\nreduced and was no longer statistically significant after we\nincluded individual SES controls in Model 2.\nAmong Black older adults, Model 3 demonstrates that only\ncounty poverty was associated with self-rated health. After\ncontrolling for individual SES, county poverty was still\nassociated with worse self-rated health. An interesting finding\nis that county percent Black emerged as a statistically\nsignificant predictor, but in an unexpected direction. After\ncontrolling for individual SES, county poverty, and racial\nsegregation, Black older adults living in counties with a higher\npercentage of Black residents had better self-rated health than\nthose in counties with fewer Black residents. All else being\nequal, living in a county with a greater percent Black may be\nassociated with poor health among White older adults, but\nbetter health among Black older adults.\nTable 6 for the ACL demonstrates little new findings with\nthe race-specific analyses. Neither racial segregation nor racial\ncomposition was associated with self-rated health for either\nWhite or Black older adults. In sum, we found little support for\nan association between racial segregation and self-rated health\namong older adults. The support we did find suggests that\nliving in more segregated counties was associated with worse\nhealth for White older adults, whereas living in counties with\na higher percent Black was associated with better health for\nBlack older adults.\nOur second hypothesis stated that the greater the percentage\nof Black residents in one's neighborhood, in comparison to the\npercentage of Black residents in one's county, the worse health\none is likely to have. This hypothesis reflects our ability to use\nmultilevel information to extend existing research by exam-\nining whether living in a segregated neighborhood per se,\nTable 2.

Tables 7 and 8 show individual-\nand neighborhood-level (census tract) data, in contrast to the\nprevious tables, which contained individual- and county-level\ndata. Model 1 of Table 7 demonstrates that in the NSFH, Black\nolder adults had worse self-rated health than did White older\nadults, but there was no association between neighborhood\nsegregation (using the neighborhood racial difference variable)\nand self-rated health. Model 2 adds neighborhood (tract-level)\npercent poverty to the model and demonstrates that people\nliving in higher poverty neighborhoods had worse health.\nMoreover, once we had controlled for percent poverty, there\nwas a statistically significant coefficient for neighborhood racial\ndifference. People living in neighborhoods with a greater\npercent of Black neighbors relative to the county average had\nbetter self-rated health. This association was no longer\nstatistically significant after controlling for individual SES in\nModel 3. Further investigation showed that this relationship\nexisted only for Black older adults in the NSFH, as\ndemonstrated in Models 4\u00ad6.\nThese findings counter our second hypothesis, which is that\nliving in a more racially segregated neighborhood is associated\nwith worse health. However, neighborhood percent Black\nand the neighborhood racial difference variable were highly\ncorrelated, so we did not include them simultaneously. We\ncautiously conclude that net of percent poverty, either higher\npercent Black or neighborhood segregation is associated with\npositive self-rated health for Black older adults.\nIn contrast, Table 8 shows that there was no association in\nthe ACL between neighborhood racial difference and self-rated\nhealth for the full sample; additional analyses found this to be\ntrue for the racial subsamples as well. However, neighborhood\npercent poverty retained its association with self-rated health\namong older adults, even net of individual SES.\nFinally, we revisit Tables 3 and 4 in order to address our\nthird hypothesis, that the Black disadvantage in self-rated\nhealth is partly explained by neighborhood- and county-level\nracial segregation, racial composition, and poverty status.\nLooking back at Table 3 for the NSFH, Models 3 and 4\ndemonstrate that Black older adults had worse self-rated health\nthan did White older adults, and this association remained after\ncontrolling for county-level racial segregation, racial concen-\ntration, and percent poverty. Similarly, Table 7 shows that for\nthe NSFH, the Black disadvantage in self-rated health persisted\nafter controlling for neighborhood poverty and racial segrega-\ntion. However, in both the county- and neighborhood-level\nmodels for the NSFH, the Black disadvantage in self-rated\nhealth was no longer statistically significant after further\ncontrolling for individual SES. In this urban and suburban\nsample of older adults, neighborhood- and county-level racial\nand poverty indicators explained little of the Black disadvan-\ntage in self-rated health. Moreover, in the ACL, there were no\nTable 3.

In the ACL, we found no association between racial\nsegregation and self-rated health at either the county or\nneighborhood level among Black and White older adults. In\nthe NSFH, we found a small but statistically significant\nassociation between higher racial segregation and poorer self-\nrated health among White older adults. This association\nremained net of county-level percent Black and percent\npoverty, suggesting both that it is racial segregation and not\njust racial composition or poverty that is associated with health\namong these White older adults, and also that poverty does not\nmediate this association. The association disappeared after\ncontrolling further for individual SES, suggesting that (a) racial\nsegregation may impact individuals' SES attainment, which is\nmore proximally related to health; or (b) White older adults\nwith lower SES are more likely than their higher SES\ncounterparts both to move into or to not move out of more\nhighly segregated counties and to have poorer health.\nWe also found unexpected evidence in the NSFH that there\nmay be something about living in a more highly concentrated\nBlack neighborhood that is associated with better health for\nBlack older adults, once neighborhood poverty is controlled.\nWe cautiously report these results because we were unable to\ndetermine whether it was living in a high percent Black\nneighborhood, or living in a neighborhood with a higher\npercent Black than the average neighborhood in the county, that\nwas associated with better health. It is also possible that unique\nfeatures of the NSFH sample are responsible for this finding,\nor that response rates in these neighborhoods were selective\nby health status. If future research replicates these findings,\nit would be consistent with previous research regarding greater\nmental health among residents of enclaves with a high\nconcentration of people sharing their race or ethnicity\nIn the NSFH, we also demonstrated that race differences in\nself-rated health were only slightly reduced after considering\nneighborhood- and county-level racial and socioeconomic\nfactors, but were eliminated after controlling further for\nindividual SES.\nWe will discuss here four primary conclusions. First, there\nwas, at best, only weak evidence of an association between\nracial segregation and self-rated health among Black and White\nolder adults, based on two nationally representative multilevel\nstudies. This is consistent with evidence from Subramanian\nand colleagues (2005), who used a very large multilevel sam-\nple but who nevertheless found (a) no associations between the\nDissimilarity Index at the MSA level and self-rated health, and\nTable 5.

Moreover, we\nexamined only self-rated health as an outcome in this study.\nFuture research should examine other measures of both\nphysical and mental health. In addition, gerontological theory\nand research suggest that community context may be par-\nticularly salient to the subsequent outcomes of older adults who\nhave already experienced some decline in physical or mental\nresearch should examine whether some subgroups are more\nvulnerable to the health consequences of living in segregated\nneighborhoods.\nOur second conclusion is that race, racial segregation, racial\ncomposition, and poverty are so intertwined over time and\nspace that it is difficult (even with multilevel data) to examine\nthem simultaneously in order to determine separate, over-\nlapping, and causal relationships. This is particularly a problem\nin national data sets that employ probability samples not\ndesigned to take representative samples from each neighbor-\nhood. These data include insufficient numbers of the rare\ncounterfactual people, such as the White people who live in\nneighborhoods with a high percentage of Black residents (and\nvice versa). Despite the weak associations between racial\nsegregation and self-rated health, and given potential data\nlimitations, we encourage further work on this topic in light of\nthe persisting racial segregation of U.S. neighborhoods (Massey\n& Denton, 1993), particularly among those who are poor and\nOur third conclusion is that, despite the weak evidence for an\nassociation between racial segregation and self-rated health, we\nshowed clearer evidence for associations between health and\nSES at multiple levels, which confirms the results of previous\nthat SES at multiple levels contributes to race disparities in\nhealth among Black and White older adults, a finding that\ncontributes to a small literature on this topic (Cagney et al.;\nRobert & Lee). This is not surprising, as the greatest increases\nin residential segregation according to income during the past\ndecades have occurred among African Americans and His-\npanics (Jargowsky, 1997). Future research should examine the\nmechanisms linking socioeconomic and other neighborhood\ncharacteristics to health, with an aim toward understanding how\nthey contribute to race disparities in health.\nFinally, in order to fully understand race differences in health\namong older adults, researchers need to look beyond urban\nenvironments. This study, like other studies on racial\nsegregation and health, excluded rural respondents because\nracial residential segregation is typically investigated as an\nurban and suburban phenomenon. Ironically, we noted greater\nracial health disparities among older rural respondents than\namong urban and suburban respondents in our preliminary\nTable 7.
