For juveniles, a parent or legal guardian gave written\nconsent for participation, and assent was obtained from all ju-\nveniles. All research protocols and consent forms were ap-\nproved by the institutional review boards of the University of\nColorado, Denver (for proband assessment), and the Univer-\nsity of Colorado, Boulder (for assessments of all other rela-\ntives), and all subjects were paid for participation.\nSubstance use data were obtained using the Composite In-\nternational Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module\n(CIDI-SAM).54,60 Conduct disorder was assessed using the Di-\nagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC) for all pa-\ntient probands. Conduct disorder for siblings younger than 19\nyears was assessed using the DISC, whereas siblings 19 years\nor older were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Sched-\nassessed with DSM-III-R versions of the DISC61 and DIS.62 Par-\ning DSM-IV versions of the DISC63 and DIS,64 modified for scor-\ning both DSM-III-R and DSM-IV symptoms and diagnoses.\nAdjustmentsforpotentialinstrumenteffectsaredescribedherein.\nWe used DSM criterion (symptom) counts to create 3 quantita-\ntive phenotypes to assess DV, CD symptoms (CDS), and a com-\npositeindexofantisocialsubstancedependence(DVCDS).The\nmean number of DSM-IV dependence symptoms (ie, total symp-\ntom count across all classes of substances divided by the num-\nber of substances used repeatedly) was used as our index of DV\n(see Stallings et al54 for details regarding the validity of this in-\ndex), and the total number of DSM-III-R CD symptoms was used\nas our quantitative measure of CDS. (DSM-III-R criteria were used\nfor CDS because DSM-IV versions of the DISC and DIS assess-\nments were unavailable at the outset of the study; the version of\nthe CIDI-SAM that was used provided DSM-IV symptom counts\nfor substance dependence.)\nBecause of marked age trends on these indexes in our com-\nmunity sample, the measures were age and sex corrected us-\ning standard regression procedures and then standardized within\nsex groups to express scores in our selected (clinical) sibling\nsample in relation to the population means and variability for\nadolescents and young adults. In addition, CDS scores were ob-\ntained from the DISC for probands and younger siblings but\nfrom the DIS for older siblings, and 2 versions of the DISC and\nDIS assessments were used. To account for any instrument ef-\nfects that may not have been corrected for by our age adjust-\nments, interview type was dummy coded and used to obtain\nresidual CDS scores. (Instrument type accounted for only 1.2%\nof the variance in our age- and sex-corrected CDS scores in the\ncommunity sample.)\nStandardized DV and CDS scores were summed to form a\ncomposite index of antisocial substance dependence\n(DVCDS). This index was then subsequently restandard-\nized so that the metric of the composite (sum) index was the\nsame as for our individual measures of DV and CDS (ie, means\nof 0 and SDs of 1 in our community sample).\nThe methods used for preparation of genomic DNA and geno-\ntyping of the 374 microsatellite markers (ABI PRISM LMS2-\nMD10 panels; PE Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) have been de-\nscribed previously.54 For 47% of the families, genotypes were\navailable from both parents; 49% included genotypes from 1\nparent, and for 4% of the sibships, no parental genotypes were\nand 3 sibships of 5. Sex-averaged marker maps were obtained\nfrom the Marshfield Center for Medical Genetics database (http:\n//research.marshfieldclinic.org/genetics), and allele frequen-\ncies were estimated from the full sample using Merlin.65 Table 1\ngives marker information for each chromosome and means\nacross the 22 autosomes.\nValidation of genotypes and family relationships was per-\nformed with the Graphical Relationship Representation pro-\ngram,66 Pedstats,67 and Merlin.65 Details are described in our\n\u00a92005 American Medical Association.

In addition, 1 proband did not have complete\nCIDI-SAM and DISC assessments, and 11 individuals were\ngenotyped for less than 50% of the markers. These individuals\nwere removed from the sample before linkage analysis, result-\ning in a final sample of 249 sibling pairs. Twelve markers were\nomitted for low call rates; the mean call rate for the markers\nused was approximately 85%. Estimated marker haplotypes\nfrom Merlin indicated no evidence for excessive recombination\nevents, and few genotypes (0.07%) were flagged as highly\nunlikely. Genotypes flagged as unlikely were not concentrated\namong certain markers, individuals, or families, and analyses\nthat removed unlikely genotypes yielded essentially identical\nresults to full-sample analyses, so these genotypes were\nretained. Identity-by-descent (IBD) sharing for all sibpairs was\nestimated at 1-centimorgan (cM) intervals (and also at each\nmarker for single-point analyses) across the genome (auto-\nsomes) using Merlin.\nThe regression-based sibpair linkage method that we used was\nproposed by Fulker et al68,69 as an extension of the methods origi-\nnally developed by Fulker, DeFries, and colleagues70 for the\nanalysis of selected twin data. The rationale of the DeFries-\nFulker (DF) linkage analysis for selected sibling samples is that\nthe siblings of selected probands should demonstrate differen-\ntial regression toward the population mean on a quantitative\ntrait commensurate with the proportion of marker alleles they\nshare IBD with the proband, given that a QTL is linked to a\nparticular chromosomal marker. The following regression model\nwas fit to data from 249 proband-sibling pairs:\ni\n)=,\nwhere C is the quantitative score of the proband's sibling, P is\nthe proband's score, \ni\nis the estimated mean proportion of al-\nleles shared IBD for the sibling pair at location (i) in the ge-\nnome, and  and  are the regression constant and distur-\nbance term, respectively. A t test of the significance of the b2\nregression coefficient provides a test of linkage, which can be\nexpressed as an approximate logarithm of odds (LOD) score\n(t2/[2natural log of 10]) . We used the DF regression\u00adbased\nQTL linkage analysis as operationalized in QMS2,71 a series of\nintegrated SAS macros available at http://ibgwww.colorado.edu\n/~lessem/software/qms2.html.\nRESULTS\nThe percentages of participants who met the criteria for\nDSM diagnoses of substance dependence (DSM-IV) and\nCD (DSM-III-R) are given in Table 2. Note the greater\nprevalence of substance dependence in the clinical pro-\nbands and their siblings compared with community ado-\nlescents.

We defined affected status\nas scoring above a z-score cutoff of 1.96 for each of our\n3 phenotypic measures. Sibling pairs were considered con-\ncordant extreme-scoring pairs if they both scored above\nthe respective z-score cutoff. When only the proband ex-\nceeded the threshold and the sibling did not, the pair was\nconsidered a discordant pair. A z score greater than 1.96\nwould include approximately 2.5% of the general popu-\nlation. By defining affection status this way, we are not\nsuggesting that many of our sibling pairs are unaffected.\nThis analysis was used to determine whether sibling pairs\nconcordant for extreme scores on our quantitative phe-\nnotypes also showed increased allele sharing IBD at the\nlocations suggested by our regression analyses.\nTable 6 gives the estimated proportion of alleles\nshared IBD for siblings defined as concordant high scor-\ning and discordant pairs for our peak locations and for\nthe flanking markers proximal to each of the peak loca-\ntions.

The evi-\nbut of sufficient magnitude to warrant further study of\nthese regions. Although these locations do not meet the\ncriteria of Lander and Kruglyak74 for significant linkage,\nfew studies of comparable sample size will individually\nhave sufficient power to identify QTLs at this level of sig-\nnificance. A strength of our design was the use of a sample\nof 249 selected sibling pairs, which provides roughly the\nusing our analytical methods. Even so, the power to de-\ntect QTLs of low effect size (15% heritability) is lim-\nited. Clearly, these findings require replication in inde-\npendent adolescent samples. However, a series of checks\non our current analyses indicate that our linkage results\nare robust to outliers and the phenotypic distributional\nproperties of our sample.\nOther investigators have suggested QTLs in the vicin-\nity of ours for substance-related behaviors. Uhl et al,75 in-\nvestigating QTLs for polysubstance abuse vulnerability in\nan adult sample, reported a significant association with a\nregion on chromosome 3 within 10 cM of our peak loca-\nevidence for linkage to 3 markers on chromosome 3, span-\ngenetic linkage to alcohol dependence. Bergen et al77 re-\nported a similar region associated with smoking status on\nchromosome 3 (171.7 cM) and a region close to our peak\nlocationonchromosome9(161cM).Arecentgenomescan\nfor QTLs associated with CD78 did not find the same lo-\ncations as we did for our CDS measure. The authors did\nreport a QTL on chromosome 3 (134 cM) near a second-\nary peak (LOD=0.80) evident from our genome scan for\nour DV measure (Figure 2). However, their adult sample\nwas selected for high-density alcoholism, and CD symp-\ntoms were retrospectively reported. In addition, their\nsamplewasnothighlyselectedforCD(approximately13%\nwould meet criteria for a diagnosis), so our samples are\nnot directly comparable.\nThere are several limitations of our study. First, endo-\nphenotypes that uniquely represent specific genetic con-\ntributions to CDS and DV are unknown. Our phenotypes\nwere constructed from standard psychiatric symptom clus-\nters(DSMcriteria).Theseclusters,althoughusefulforguid-\ning currently available treatments, generally do not con-\nsider differences in etiologies.\nSecond, because CD and SUDs develop over time, we\nused age- and sex-normed quantitative phenotypes to ex-\npress CD and DV in our selected sibling sample in rela-\ntion to the population means and variability for commu-\nnity adolescents. Although CD and polysubstance use are\ncharacteristic of our high-risk probands and their sib-\nlings, not all of our study participants have fully passed\nthrough the age of risk, and this may limit the validity\nof our phenotypes.\nFinally, our clinical adolescent sample was selected for\nboth problem substance use and CD; thus, our findings\nmay not generalize to broader substance-abusing popu-\nlations without comorbid antisocial behavior. However,\njoint selection for both of these phenotypes would not be\nexpected to lead to the finding of a common QTL in the\nabsence of pleiotropy or strong linkage disequilibrium.\nTo explore our results further, we conducted a search\nfor candidate genes within \u00b15 megabases (Mb) of each\nof our peak locations79 (http://genome.ucsc.edu). These\nsearches yielded approximately 100 genes within each\nregion. We highlight herein some candidates of interest\n(a full listing of identified genes in these regions can be\nfound on our Web site at http://ibgwww.colorado.edu\n/cadd/a_center/research). Potential candidates in the re-\n(PLD1); a serine proteinase inhibitor gene (SERPINI1);\nclaudin 11, an oligodendrocyte transmembrane protein\ngene (CLDN11); and neuroligin 1 (NLGN1). A notable\ncandidate near our 9q34 region is the dopamine -hy-\ndroxylase gene (DBH). However, when we added a SNP\nchromosome 9 map, there was no evidence of linkage near\nthis marker, suggesting that our putative QTL is distal\nto the DBH locus. Other potential candidates in the re-\ngion include GRIN1 (NMDAR1), a gene that codes for a\nsubunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; a neuro-\nblastoma protein gene (AMY); a chloride intracellular\nchannel gene (CLIC3); and a calcium channel gene\nlocation include the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4);\na cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit (CDK5R1)\nthat codes for a protein that is a neuron-specific activa-\ntor of CDK5; and OMG, a gene that codes for an oligo-\ndendrocyte myelin glycoprotein.

Results of this study provide the first evi-\ndence of a potential molecular genetic basis for the co-\nmorbidity between drug dependence vulnerability and\nantisocial behavior in adolescents.\nCorrespondence: Michael C.
