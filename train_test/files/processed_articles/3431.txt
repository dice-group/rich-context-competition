    "abstract": "Abstract\nWe investigate how the immediate correction effect decreases mispointing under prisms. Subjects\nperformed rhythmic pointing movements under different conditions with horizontally shifting\nprisms. Even the first (initial) pointing error is much smaller than the prismatic shift, a\nphenomenon called the immediate correction effect. Knowledge about the structure of the\nroom and of objects in the room obtained before the prisms were worn may limit the amount\nof the prismatic displacement perceived. We therefore compared the direct prism effect as well as\nprismatic adaptation with room illumination switched on versus switched off. Our 44 subjects\nparticipated in two experiments, with varying amounts of information about room structure\navailable. The results show a direct effect corresponding to the optical power of the prisms in\nthe dark condition, when in addition body position was slightly rotated in direction of the prismatic\nshift. But even in the dark, a significant immediate correction effect arises with the fixed body\nposition. The largest immediate correction amounting to almost half of optical displacement arose\nin the standard condition of bright light and fixed body position.\n",

Any discrepancy between seen and felt arm position (misalignment\nbetween spatial maps for eyes and hand) is consciously perceived and can usually be\nreduced within a few movements (Baraduc & Wolpert, 2002; Redding & Wallace, 1990,\n1993). A prism displacing the visual field horizontally induces arm movements that\ninitially miss the target laterally (direct effect; Guan & Wade, 2000; Harris, 1965). But\nwith a few movements, people quickly adjust to the new visual conditions (Guan & Wade,\n2000; Harris, 1965). After removing the prism glasses, participants initially miss the object in\nthe direction opposite to the prism effect (aftereffect; Guan & Wade, 2000; Harris, 1965;\nRedding, Rossetti, & Wallace, 2005; Redding & Wallace, 2006). Again the mispointing\ndecreases gradually by repeated movements and vanishes completely.\nOver the last century, prism adaptation was extensively investigated (Harris, 1965;\nHelmholtz, 1867; Redding & Wallace, 2006), but many questions remain. For example, the\nimmediate correction effect is only partly understood, that is, the fact that the initial effect is\nmuch smaller than to be expected: It amounts to approximately half of the optical prismatic\nshift (Redding, Rossetti, & Wallace, 2005).\nFollowing the study by Rock, Goldberg, and Mack (1966), several authors (Melamed,\nBeckett, & Wallace, 1978; Wallace, Melamed, & Cohen, 1973) investigated the direct effect,\nwith participants wearing prism glasses and evaluating subjective straight ahead under both\ntotally dark and under bright light conditions. The results of Rock, Goldberg, and Mack\n(1966) show a difference between the bright versus dark conditions of 6 to 7 for horizontal\noptical displacements of 11.4, while 8.5 for upward and 5.8 for downward directions.\nExplanations for the immediate correction include the ability to counteract the optical\nshift based on, for example, the position or size of room objects or by employing\nperspective cues in rooms with right angles (Rock, Goldberg, & Mack, 1966).\nAim of the study\nThe present study was designed to further minimize the immediate correction effect in order\nto produce conditions in which the initial (pointing) error fully corresponds to the optic\npower of the prisms. To that aim, we tested the immediate correction effect for (a)\n``normal'' prism experiments, (b) after removing peripheral vision (outside the prism\nglasses) under light conditions, (c) in the dark, and (d) after (slightly) rotating the body of\nparticipants in darkness. Our results show that under the last conditions, no immediate\ncorrection effect occurs, and the initial error closely corresponds to the optical shift.\nMethods\nEthics Statement\nThe study was approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Bremen. Prior to\nthe study, the participants were informed about the procedure which followed the\nDeclaration of Helsinki (2008) and signed a written consent. They were free to withdraw\nfrom the study at any time, which none did.\nParticipants\nForty-four participants, aged 18 to 30 years, were recruited for two experiments. Most of\nthem were students of the University of Bremen. Two groups of 14 participants each\n(different individuals for each group) participated in Experiment 1 (group ``adaptation in\ngroups, with eight participants each (group ``shielded'': six females, two males; M \u00bc 24.8;\nSE \u00bc 0.82; group ``unshielded'': six females, two males; M \u00bc 24.0; SE \u00bc 1.05). Only right-\nhanded participants with normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity (contact lenses only;\nFreiburger Visual Acuity Test; Bach, 1996), with normal stereopsis (Lang Stereo Test; Lang,\n1983) and nai\u00a8ve to prism adaptation participated. Pupillary distance was measured with an\nAuto-Refractometer (NIDEK ARK-700 AUTO REF/Keratometer), to be between 54 and\n64 mm for the right shifting prisms and 59 and 69 mm for the left shifting prisms.\nExperiment 1: Adaptation in Dark Versus Adaptation in Light\nExperimental set-up. For the adaptation in both dark and light, the apparatus consisted of a\ntable, 99.5cm high, 110 cm wide, and 57 cm deep, with a red diode as the target (in the dark)\nor a red labeled stick (in the light) mounted centrally on its front side (Figures 1 and 2).\nParticipants sat on a low chair, 43 cm high, with rotary function. The rotatability of the chair\nenabled a correct orientation of the participant and could be blocked to fixate its position. A\nchin rest served to keep target distance constant at 51 cm and to keep the central table\nposition. For some parts of the experiment (rotated chair condition), the chin rest was not\nused, to enable head movement. Participants performed arm movements under the opaque\ntable top, starting near their trunk and aiming at the visual target (Figure 1). Table depth was\nindividually adjusted such that only 4 cm of the forefinger was visible at the end of each\npointing movement, providing terminal feedback on hand position. In the dark, the right\nforefinger transmitter bore both an ultrasound probe and a red diode, providing visual\nFigure 1.

In the light condition, the target and the forefinger\ntransmitter were colored red, without diodes (Figure 1).\nThe miniature piezo-electric transmitter on the finger emitted ultrasound which allowed to\ntrack the finger's trajectory (Zebris Isny/Germany). We used both right- and left-shifting\nprism glasses (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen/Germany). The right shifting prisms had a circular\nshape (\u00d8 \u00bc 35 mm) and an optical center distance of 59 mm, whereas the left shifting prisms\nhad oval glasses (\u00d8 \u00bc 45 mm), with an optical center distance of 64 mm. The prismatic effect\nof the glasses was 30 prism diopters [cm/m], corresponding to a visual shift of 16.7. The\nprism glasses had optical side shields in part of the experiments to prevent nonshifted images\nto reach peripheral vision.\nProcedure. Two groups of participants performed rhythmic pointing movements in the dark\n(group ``adaptation in dark'') or else in the light (group ``adaptation in light'') toward the\ncentral target (0) at a frequency of around 0.37 Hz ($2.7 s per movement). In both groups,\neach participant was tested four times (four blocks) in the same testing order with all together\n240 movements. Each block consisted of an adaptation- and a readaptation task with 30\npointing movements each. For both groups (dark and light) and two orientations of the\nprisms (right and left), we used two chair positions (central and eccentric), the eccentric\nposition was to the right for right shifting prisms and to the left for left shifting prisms,\nyielding four conditions for each group. The three positions employed in the dark condition\nwere central at 0, rotated right on average at 9.3, and rotated left at 9.9. In the bright\ncondition, rotation was smaller, on average 6.9 right and 4.9 left. The precise right and left\npositions of the chair were individually adjusted. Each participant started with the chair\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFigure 2. Schematic illustration of the chair positions employed: (a) prism shift and chair rotation to the\nright; (b) prism shift to the right and central chair position; (c) prism shift and chair rotation to the left; (d)\nprism shift to the left and central chair position.

In\nExperiment 1, all measurements started with the right shifting prisms.\nAfter being seated on the chair, participants were asked to close their eyes and to wait for\nfurther instructions. In the dark conditions, the room lights were switched off. Participants\nreceived the prism glasses while their eyes were closed and then the target was uncovered.\nParticipants were asked to open their eyes and to rotate the chair until the target was\nsubjectively located straight ahead of their nose, with unrestrained head position. For\nreadaptation, the prism glasses were removed, the chair and head positions were\nunchanged. The results during readaptation are irrelevant for this study and not presented\nhere, they followed the standard pattern (Figure 2).\nExperiment 2: Shielded Versus Unshielded Prisms\nExperimental set-up. In Experiment 2, group ``shielded'' used prisms with an optical side shield\nto restrict the visual field, while group ``unshielded'' used prisms without a side shield. The\nchair was fixed at 0, and the head was positioned in the chin rest. The experimental set-up\ncorresponded to the previous experiment, but we only used the central chair position in a\nbright room, with prisms inducing a visual shift of 16.7 to the right.\nProcedure. Participants were sitting centrally in front of the table, with their head in the chin\nrest and the lights switched on. Participants were asked to perform 30 rhythmic pointing\nmovements under terminal visual feedback toward the central target (0). For the adaptation\ntask, they wore right shifting prism glasses, with or without optical side shields. After\nremoval of prisms (readaptation), participants again performed 30 pointing movements\ntoward the central target.\nAnalysis\nThe Zebris system recorded the complete three-dimensional trajectory of the pointing\nmovements (x-, y-, z-axis). Pointing movements were analyzed by means of a Matlab\nprogram (R2010a) developed in-house which determined the extreme of each pointing\nmovement. The results were verified visually by the experimenters. For statistical analysis,\nwe calculated a two-factor analysis of variance and t tests comparing the direct effects under\ndifferent conditions.\nResults\nWe aimed to identify the experimental parameters responsible for the immediate correction\neffect. To this end, we compared (a) the direct effect for ``normal'' prism experiments, with (b)\na condition where optical side shields eliminated the influence of peripheral, unshifted visual\ninformation, (c) adaptation in the dark, and (d) adaptation in the dark and additional body\nrotation.\nExperiment 1: Adaptation in Dark Versus Adaptation in Light\nFigure 3 shows the averaged results for prism adaptation in the dark and in the light\ncondition. A large initial pointing error (direct effect) in direction of the prismatic shift\nemerges under both conditions. The pointing error decreases substantially with further\nmovements.\nPochopien and Fahle 5\n(a) (b)\n(c) (d)\nFigure 3.

For the initial pointing movements, significant differences\nbetween dark and light (p <.05) are marked with *, trends (p <.1) are marked withT (one-sided t test for\nunpaired samples).\nThe direct effect (initial pointing error) is significantly larger in the dark than in the light\ncondition for right shifting prisms and central chair position (t\u00bc 2.89, p\u00bc .004; one-sided t test\nfor unpaired samples). The same is true for the conditions left shifting prisms and rotated as well\nprisms combined with rotation to the right only yields a trend (t \u00bc 1.66, p\u00bc .054). Hence, the\ninitial correction effect is significantly larger in light than in dark conditions (Table 1).\nOn average, the direct effect with rotated chair position in darkness slightly exceeds the\noptical shift of the prisms (right: 103%; left: 114%; mean: 109%). The initial pointing error\nwith central chair amounts to only 81% in right prisms and 75% in left prisms (mean: 78%).\nIn the light condition, the direct effect is also higher for the rotated chair condition (right:\n80%; left: 86%; mean: 83%), but the effect is obviously smaller than in the dark condition.\nWithout rotation, right prisms reach only 52% and left prisms only 61% (mean: 57%) of\noptical shift (mean values, see Table 2).\nA two-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements was computed with prism\ndirection and rotation as the within subjects factors and illumination as between subject\nfactor. Please note that for statistical analysis, results for left shifting prisms were inverted.\nThe main effect of prism direction (F(1, 26) \u00bc 0.73, p \u00bc .402) is not significant, the same is true\nfor the interaction of prisms by group (F(1, 26) \u00bc 0.15, p \u00bc .700). The main effect of rotation\nanalysis show significant differences for the right shifting prisms between right and central\np \u00bc .312) are not significant. In other words, the initial correction effect is significantly smaller\nfor rotated than for central chair positions, under all experimental conditions.\nExperiment 2: Shielded Versus Unshielded Prisms\nThe results for the shielded (M \u00bc 11.1, SE \u00bc 0.8) and unshielded conditions (M \u00bc 9.2,\nSE \u00bc 1.2) show a large initial pointing error which decreased gradually (Figure 4).The\ndirect effect was larger when participants wore prisms with an optical side shield with an\naverage difference of 1.9, but this difference fails to be significant (t \u00bc 1.33, p \u00bc .103, one-\nsided unpaired t test).\nOn average, the direct effect for the ``shielded'' group is 66% of the prismatic power, while\nthat for the ``unshielded'' one is only 55%.\nTable 1. Mean Direct Effect in Degree & Calculations of the Difference Values.\nPrisms Position Dark [] Light [] Difference dark $ light\nNote. Direct effects in degrees of visual angle.\nPochopien and Fahle 7\nDiscussion\nOur results on the influence of different experimental conditions show rather clear-cut results.\nIn line with earlier studies (Melamed, Beckett, & Wallace, 1978; Rock, Goldberg, & Mack,\n1966), we find that the direct prism effect, that is the deviation of the first pointing movement\ntoward a visual target, is influenced by illumination level. Without side shields, the direct\nprism effect deviates from the target by only about 55% of the prismatic shift introduced by\nthe prism glasses. The direct effect increases slightly, that is, the initial compensation effect\nTable 2.

Results are tabulated in absolute values.\nFigure 4. Comparison of the course of adaptive performance and direct effect between shielded and\nunshielded condition.

With this type of glasses, the\ndirect effect increases to 66%. However, this difference fails to reach significance (p \u00bc .1).\nThe biggest increase in the direct effect of prisms onto pointing movements occurs if the\npointing movements are performed in darkness, with a mean direct effect of 78% of prismatic\npower (right prisms: 81%; left prisms: 75%), with no significant differences (two-sided t test\nfor paired samples) between right- and left-shifting prisms. This corresponds to deviations of\n4.8 and 2.4 for right- and left-shifting prisms respectively, comparable to the results of\nRock, Goldberg and Mack (1966). In an illuminated room, the mean direct effect only was\n57% of prismatic power (right prisms: 52%; left prisms: 61%) with no significant difference\nbetween right- and left-shifting prisms.\nSomewhat to our surprise, the direct effect increased (not significantly) even beyond the\nprismatic power when we rotated the participants to the individual's subjective straight ahead\nposition relative to the target in the dark after donning the prisms. The average effect was\n109% (right prisms: 103%; left prisms: 114%), without significant differences between right-\nand left-shifting prisms. In the bright laboratory, the direct effect was on average 83% (right\nprisms: 80%; left prisms: 86%) without significant differences between right- and left-shifting\nprisms.\nWe fitted the adaptation curves of the individual participants by means of exponential\nfunctions of the following form, f(x) \u00bc aebx \u00fe c. To verify whether or not the exponential\ndecays differ, we compared the fitted values of b. None of the data shown in Figures 3 and 4\nyielded significant differences between the pairs of conditions compared in these figures (two-\nsided t test for unpaired samples).\nA possible explanation for the effect of body rotation relies on the fact that pointing to\neccentric targets without feedback, that is with the table depth extended so far that the finger\ncannot be seen even at the end of the movement, yields an ``undershoot'' of movements for\neccentricities above around 8, that is, 8 lateral target distance from the body midline for left\nshifting prisms (Pochopien, Stemmler, Spang, Nguelefack, & Fahle, 2013). This ``undershoot''\nshould (almost) disappear after body rotation since arm movements will be less ``eccentric.'' The\ninfluence of illumination, over all conditions is, on average 3.9, while that of body position or\nrotation is 4.8 (Table 1), indicating a similar importance of both factors.\nOur aim was to find a condition that produces a complete initial effect, that is, a pointing\nerror corresponding to the optical power of the prisms. Therefore, we did not counterbalance\nbetween central and rotated chair positions. It is reassuring that our results for central chair\nposition correspond closely to those of an earlier study on prism adaptation in the dark\nwithout chair rotation (Rock, Goldberg, & Mack, 1966).\nFrom our results, we conclude that the initial effect of prisms is (at least) as large as to be\nexpected from the optical quality of the prisms when tested in an adequate way. But under\nstandard experimental conditions, information and knowledge about room structure in\ngeneral (such as perspective) and about the room at hand will decrease the size of the\nmispointing, to about half of prismatic power as does the fact that eccentric positions in\ngeneral tend to be underestimated (Parise, Spence, & Ernst, 2012). This finding agrees with\nassumptions of Rock, Goldberg, and Mack (1966). Hence we conclude that in the future, we\ndo not have to worry about the fact that the direct effect is so much smaller than the optic\nshift induced by the prismatic glasses, but we must be aware that the size of the direct effect\nand hence our results may rely on a number of factors such as the exact type of glasses\nemployed (sunglass-type vs. diver-type), the structure of the experimental chamber, and body\norientation or target eccentricity.\nPochopien and Fahle 9\n"
