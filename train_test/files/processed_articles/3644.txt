    "abstract": "Abstract\nReminiscence therapy has the potential to improve quality of life for people with dementia. In\nrecent years reminiscence groups have extended to include family members, but carers'\nexperience of attending joint sessions is undocumented. This qualitative study explored the\nexperience of 18 family carers attending `Remembering Yesterday Caring Today' groups. Semi-\nstructured interviews were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Five themes were\nidentified: experiencing carer support; shared experience; expectations (met and unmet), carer\nperspectives of the person with dementia's experience; and learning and comparing. Family carers'\nexperiences varied, with some experiencing the intervention as entirely positive whereas others\nhad more mixed feelings. Negative aspects included the lack of respite from their relative, the lack\nof emphasis on their own needs, and experiencing additional stress and guilt through not being\nable to implement newly acquired skills. These findings may explain the failure of a recent trial of\njoint reminiscence groups to replicate previous findings of positive benefit. More targeted\nresearch within subgroups of carers is required to justify the continued use of joint\nreminiscence groups in dementia care.\n",

Caring for someone with dementia is associated with\nhigh levels of anxiety and depression (Cooper, Balamurali, & Livingston, 2007), lack of\npersonal time and opportunities to socialise (Croog, Burleson, Sudilovsky, & Baume,\n2006) and greater levels of strain and distress than carers of other older people (Moise,\nSchwarzinger, & Um, 2004). Whilst the vital role of carers has been acknowledged by the\nNICE-SCIE guidelines (2006), carer-reported quality of life is still varied (Alzheimer's\nSociety, 2012). Over half (52%) carers report they do not receive sufficient support to\nenable them to carry out their caring role (Alzheimer's Society, 2011). The National\nDementia Strategy (NDS) in England acknowledged that `family carers are the most\nimportant resource available for people with dementia' (Department of Health, 2009,\np. 49) and recommended the development of peer support networks for people with\ndementia and carers (objective 5). However, it is not yet clear which model(s) of peer\nworking should be adopted (DoH, 2009, p. 42), nor whether psychosocial interventions\nare most effective when person-centred or relationship-focussed.\nPsychosocial interventions\nMeta-analyses of carer-focussed interventions demonstrate small to moderate effects upon\npsychological morbidity and caregiver knowledge (Brodaty, Green, & Koschera, 2003),\nburden, depression, knowledge, and subjective well-being (Pinquart & Sorensen, 2006),\nand recommended interventions include psycho-education, skills-training, and multi-\nBrodaty, Green, and Koschera (2003) suggested that the only significant feature of\ninterventions which improved carer well-being and burden was the involvement of the\nperson with dementia and their families. Subsequently, there has been a move to develop\nmore relationship-centred interventions. Promoting a positive relationship may prevent the\nbreakdown of the dyad relationship and thus reduce the likelihood of the person with\ndementia being placed in alternative care (Brodaty et al., 2003). A review of programmes\ninvolving patients and family members concluded that it was beneficial to involve family\nmembers in interventions for people with dementia (Martire et al., 2004), but a more recent\nreview concluded that programmes for dyads may improve some, but not all, aspects of\nfunctioning for the carer and person with dementia (Smits et al., 2007).\nReminiscence therapy\nReminiscence therapy has been popular and widely used across Europe for a number of\nyears, promoting communication and well-being for people with dementia through\nstimulating earlier memories which are often intact. This encourages social inclusion,\nincreased levels of well-being, pleasure and cognitive stimulation (Woods, Spector, Jones,\nOrrell, & Davies, 2005). More recently, reminiscence programmes such as the `Remembering\nYesterday Caring Today' (RYCT) group programme (Schweitzer & Bruce, 2008) have\nincluded carers alongside the person with dementia following evidence to suggest that this\njoint approach leads to a reduction in carer stress (Thorgrimsen, Schweitzer, & Orrell, 2002;\nWoods et al., 2005). However, a recent large scale randomised controlled trial of RYCT\ncompared to treatment as usual showed increased carer anxiety symptoms, plus levels of\ncaregiving stress increased with the number of sessions attended (Woods et al., 2012).\nWoods et al. (2012) highlighted the need for systematically recorded information on the\nexperiences of those participating in reminiscence programmes, as well as those who did not\nparticipate or dropped out, in order to clarify the unexpected findings of their study. To date\nthere has been no qualitative research regarding peoples' experience of attending\nreminiscence groups. Therefore, an evaluation of the RYCT approach through in-depth\nsemi-structured interviews would `fill in gaps' not explored by existing quantitative\nmeasures and will also contribute to the emerging literature on dyadic interventions.\nMethod\nDesign\nThe study design was a qualitative inquiry using in-depth, semi-structured interviews and\nthematic analysis. This method was selected to allow exploration of carers' own experiences\nof attending the RYCT intervention. The RYCT intervention (Schweitzer & Bruce, 2008)\nwas delivered as part of a larger randomised controlled trial, the SHIELD (Support at\nHome: Interventions to Enhance Life in Dementia) Carer Supporter Programme\nThe `Remembering Yesterday, Caring Today' programme\nThe RYCT intervention is a structured psychosocial intervention for individuals with\ndementia and their family carers over 10 months (12 weekly sessions followed by seven\nmonthly sessions). Each session lasts 2 h and follows a programme of topics intended to\nallow reminiscence over the life-course (e.g. schooldays, going out, working-life). Groups are\nheld in community settings and transport is arranged for those people who had difficulties\ntravelling independently. A trained team (including NHS or voluntary organisation staff,\nvolunteers and carer supporters) attended per dyad so that all participants have the\nnecessary support and guidance throughout. In the SHIELD programme, groups ranged\nin size from 4 to 15 dyads. Four of the weekly sessions included a group for family carers\naway from the individuals with dementia. The first two carer groups focused on\n`communication', whilst the second two had a focus on `reminiscence at home'. However,\ncarers were often keen to use the time to share information and caring experiences.\nParticipants\nParticipants were 18 family carers of a person with dementia living in the community in the\nboroughs of Havering and Redbridge in North East London or in Norfolk. In this study, a\ncarer was defined as an adult family member or friend who gave unpaid support for the\nperson with dementia and who regarded themselves as a family carer. Family carers were\nselected from an existing sample of participants who had taken part in the RYCT or\ncombined CSP-RYCT intervention as part of the SHIELD-CSP trial (Charlesworth et al.,\n2011). To maximise the validity of the findings, the sample was purposively selected to\nrepresent a diverse range of socio-demographic characteristics (gender, age, ethnicity,\nkinship to the person with dementia) and degree of attendance at the RYCT intervention.\nThe characteristics of participants are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1. Social and demographic characteristics and RYCT attendance of the carers in the sample\nID Age\nRelationship to relative\nwith dementia\nWeekly\nMonthly\nsessions (7) Total (%)\nEthical issues\nParticipants were contacted in August 2012 following ethical approval from the University\ninformation sheet detailing the study aims and procedures along with a consent form. Those\nwho verbally agreed to take part met with a member of the research team (NM, NC or ED)\nand the study discussed with them. Written consent was sought from participants prior to\nbeing interviewed. All participants who were approached for interview gave their consent,\nincluding consent for audio recording.\nSemi-structured interviews. A topic guide was developed, drawing on previous experience of the\nwider research team and reaching consensus upon important aspects to cover (Table 2).\nAgreement of the core topics to be covered increased consistency; however the scope for\ninterviewers to ask some spontaneous questions (to address participants' concerns and own\ncircumstances) ensured sensitivity to participants' self-expression in constructing their\naccounts of their own experiences. Interviews were conducted on a one-to-one basis by\nNM, NC, and ED in participants' homes between September and December 2012 and\nlasted between 30 and 90 min. Participants were encouraged to feel free to develop the\nconversation within each topic area.\nData analysis\nInterviews were transcribed verbatim from digital recording, all personal identifiers removed\nto preserve anonymity and given a personal identifier number (e.g. P1, P2). All researchers\nread the transcripts for the interviews they carried out and listened to the digital recording to\nconfirm reliability of the transcripts. The qualitative research software programme NVivo\n(Version 10) was used to support coding, management, and analysis of data to enhance\nTable 2. Semi-structured interview topic guide for family carers\nInterview questions\nCould you tell me something about why you wanted to take part in these groups?\nWhat was it like for you taking part in the groups?\nWas there anything you particularly liked about taking part in the groups?\nWas there anything you think (the person you care for) particularly liked about taking part in the group?\nWas there anything you did not like about taking part in the groups?\nWas there anything you think (person you care for) did not like about taking part in the group?\nHave you attended the group sessions regularly?\nHow far do you think the organisation of session time and space enabled carers to meet together?\nHow far do you think meeting the session organisers and carers helped you find out more about services\nand resources in your area?\nCan you think of any ways in which the sessions could have been organised differently to help carers to find\nout more about services and resources in your area?\nWhat were your feelings when you saw (person you care for) in a setting with other people with dementia?\nWhat were your feelings when you met other people caring for people with dementia?\nHow far do you think attending the groups may have affected your relationship with (person you care for)?\nAn inductive (bottom-up) thematic analysis was used as a systematic method of\nidentifying themes or patterns within the data (Braun & Clark, 2006). An initial coding\nframework was developed by researchers (NM and NC) who independently identified\nwords and phrases which described the experience of family carers attending the RYCT\nsessions. These pieces of text were condensed into codes such as `learning from other carers'\nand `spending time with similar people'. Reliability of the codes was ensured through\ndiscussion between all researchers (NM, NC and ED) and subsequently applied to the\nremaining transcripts and continuously reviewed during this process to include new\nemergent issues in a modified analytic induction process (Murphy, Dingwall, Greatbach,\nResearchers independently coded the remaining data and met periodically with a member\nof the team not involved in the interviewing process to discuss codes and themes to ensure\nreliability (researcher triangulation). Disagreements between researchers were resolved\nthrough discussion with each other after completing their independent coding. The\nprocess of modified analytic induction reviewed negative or deviant cases which enabled\nthe researchers to refine theoretical statements. The reviewers met to compare analyses, and\na consensus on the content and explanation of each theme was reached.\nParticipant validation\nParticipants were sent a summary of themes following the data analysis stage of research and\ncontacted via telephone to arrange a date for discussions of the findings. Lincoln and Guba\n(1985) suggest that participant validation is a crucial technique for establishing and\nenhancing the credibility of research findings. In order to obtain meaningful feedback, the\nresearcher ensured that the analysis was written in accessible language and that further\nexplanation was given to participants if required, as highlighted by Langdridge (2007).\nFor these reasons, the summary was succinct and simple in terminology and participants\nwere encouraged to ask questions if there were any details that they did not understand.\nDiscussions were generated around whether the summary represented a good reflection of\nparticipants' views and the themes which they could relate to the most. Where appropriate,\nparticipants were also asked if they could offer reasons for particular patterns observed by\nthe researcher and whether they felt that they would like add any further accounts or\ncomments.\nComments from carers involved in the validation exercise showed strong agreement with\nthe findings of this study. Carers generally felt that the themes and subthemes matched their\nexperiences and that they were able to relate to some of the findings under each theme. One\ncarer disagreed with the negative aspects identified by other carers and was full of praise\nregarding the RYCT intervention. However, other participants were able to relate to one or\ntwo of the negative aspects, e.g. their embarrassment at some behaviours displayed by their\nrelative, but overall had a positive experience of attending the groups.\nResults\nThematic analysis identified the following themes from the interview data: (1) expectations \u00ad\nmet and unmet; (2) experiencing carer support; (3) shared experience; (4) perception of\nexperience for person with dementia; and (5) learning and comparing. These themes and\nincorporated subthemes (Table 3) are set out in the following section.\nExpectations \u00ad met and unmet\n`I thought that it might help'. Expectations discussed by carers included meeting others in\nsimilar situations, developing a wider support network and learning new ways to cope\nwith their relative.\nI wanted to meet other people who have got the same problem as L . . ., just to have an idea and\nsee how they deal with their relatives for ideas that would be useful to me. (P10: 70, wife)\n`I didn't feel I had a break'. Whilst attending together was seen by some carers as a positive aspect\nto the group, others found that the joint sessions increased feelings of burden and strain.\nI still had to get J . . . dressed, take him there, bring him back. It took a long time to prepare and\nget ready to go out . . . I didn't feel I had a break . . . I resented the fact that it had to be with\nJ . . . and not just with others. (P6: 67, wife)\nSome carers were unhappy with the amount of time allocated to the carers' sessions. This led\ncarers to experience feelings of frustration at not having enough time to discuss their own\nexperiences.\nIdeally, I would have liked a lot more time allocated for the carers' sessions. It felt quite rushed\nso even if you had questions to ask, those who were more articulate could use up the time.\nExperiencing carer support\n`I didn't feel so alone'/`Just knowing that other people were in the same boat'. The RYCT group\nprovided an important avenue through which carers could build supportive relationships\nwith other carers. This was considered especially important for carers who reported feelings\nof isolation, identifying that meeting other carers reduced feelings of loneliness. For one\nTable 3. Themes and subthemes from the thematic analysis\nTheme Subthemes\nExperiencing carer support `I didn't feel so alone'/'Just knowing that other people\nwere in the same boat'\n`He was just normal like the rest of them'\nShared experience `Now we have more things to talk about'\n`We could share something together'\nExpectations: Met and unmet `I thought that it might help'\n`I didn't feel I had a break'\nCarer perspective of their relatives' experience `It was a social outing for him'\n`She soon forgot when we got home'\nLearning and comparing `It's no good looking into the future\n`I realised there were things that you could do'\n`I don't always have the time'\n`It was reassuring that I was doing all the right things'\n`It helped me see how others were coping'\ncarer, communication with group members substituted the decline in communication within\nher relationship.\nI was with adults that talked intelligently and that, to me, was my biggest bonus . . . that was my\nbiggest gain, because that's what I miss most of all. (P2: 74, wife).\nThis positive social network was helpful to reduce feelings of isolation for carers who\nidentified themselves as having limited social support from family or friends.\nYou don't feel quite so isolated. When you talk to other people, it helps. I don't have close\nfamily back-up. I also found some of the things that mum does, other people spoke of as well.\n`He was just normal like the rest of them'. Carers revealed their embarrassment at some\nbehaviours displayed by their relative. Being with RYCT team members and other carers\nwho had similar experiences provided a space where such behaviours were considered\n`normal' and did not draw unwanted attention and allowed carers to relax.\nWhen I take him out I have to explain that he's got dementia because he does silly things, which I\ndo find a bit embarrassing, sometimes. It was good in the group not to have to keep apologising for\nhim . . . because people do give you that look, sometimes, if they don't understand. (P5: 71, wife).\nShared experience\n`Now we have more things to talk about'. Identifying topics of conversation with their relative\nwas reported as challenging by carers, leading to reduced levels of carer confidence.\nAttending the sessions provided an important shared experience which carers could use to\ncreate `fresh' discussions. Carers were able to provide prompts during discussions in order to\nstimulate memories of sessions. Through reminiscing, some carers learnt new information\nabout their relatives' lives; this also promoted new areas of conversation.\nI enjoyed the bits that we did together, because I was then able to talk to K . . . afterwards,\nknowing what he'd done and we could recap, so that was good. (P13: 77, wife)\nWhilst thinking about the past was generally seen as a positive experience, it also appeared to\nenhance awareness as to the extent of the deterioration and change for their relative and\nthemselves.\nIt's nice talking about old times, about his school days and working days \u00ad things you forget but\nthey remind you of what your life used to be like. (P5: 71, wife)\n`We could share something together'. Attending the groups with their relative was generally a\npositive experience for carers. This time spent together was described as `quality time', as\noutside the sessions carers tended to focus on more practical day-to-day tasks with their\nrelative.\nI got something out of it in that I spent quality time with her. When I visit her at home, I'm\nperhaps doing other things, like the washing or housework, so it's not necessarily quality time\nwith her, so that was good. (P3: 47, daughter)\nSpousal carers described some of the difficulties in leaving the house together to engage in\nsocial activities including physical health problems and lack of confidence for both\nthemselves and their relative.\nIt was also an important advantage to meet so many people \u00ad the social contact, which J . . . and I\nlack, because of time and he is a very private, shy person, he doesn't want to go out and meet\npeople. I think he was very apprehensive, he doesn't like groups and he's become increasingly\ndifficult in meeting groups . . . this was quite nice because the atmosphere was very friendly, very\nwelcoming. J . . . enjoyed it and I liked what I saw and the people I saw. (P6: 67, wife)\nThe group increased carers' knowledge of activities that they could implement outside of the\nsessions which in turn enhanced carer confidence in facilitating joint activities within the\nhome.\nI liked that we were able to do things together, participating in the different activities together. I\nrealised that there were things you could do to make yourself helpful and to relieve the stress and\nthat you could play games. My L . . . likes dominoes and I couldn't play dominoes but I realised\nthat with a little patience I would be able to play with him. (P10: 70, wife)\nCarer perspective of relative's experience\n`It was a social outing for him'. Carers reported that their relative would `come alive' at the\ngroups, becoming more animated and engage in novel activities. One carer identified that\nwithin the home they were unable to engage their relative in the same activities as within the\ngroups, leading to feelings of frustration.\nHe enjoyed the cake-making as a social event. He enjoyed the novelty of doing things together\nthere. He participated in almost every event and that doesn't happen normally, at home . . . It was\na social outing for him. He would dress up and get ready, but I can't get him to do that normally\non an everyday basis. (P6: 67, wife)\n`She soon forgot when we got home'. Reported benefits for the people with dementia included\nimprovements in mood, confidence, and memory, however these were generally not\nmaintained. Carers reported that their relatives appeared `brighter' and `happier'\nfollowing the sessions but any benefits soon disappeared.\nThings were remembered, but it wasn't a long-term thing. It was soon forgotten. No lasting\nDuring discussions around potential benefits for their relative, carers felt that any benefits may\nalsobemaskedbythedeteriorationofthepersonwithdementia.Onecarerfeltthatimprovements\nmay have been greater if their relative had attended earlier in the course of their illness.\nWell, we thought it would probably revive old memories and stimulate activity, but I think the\nprogression has been too much and it hasn't worked as well as I would have liked to have\ndone . . . Things were remembered, but it wasn't a long-term thing. It was soon forgotten. No\nlasting impact. It may have done right at the beginning, but these things aren't diagnosed as early\nas they should be. If you can catch somebody early enough, it would be very beneficial for this\nLearning and comparing\n`It's no good looking into the future'. Observing people perceived as having more advanced\ndementia was described as a positive experience for many carers, viewing this as\n`preparation' for what may happen in the future.\nIt was a learning process and I could see how J . . . might progress into and that's important to\nknow, without it hitting home suddenly. The gradual process is important and even if he was\nmore advanced it's still very good to know where he might be eventually. We don't usually get\nthat opportunity in life. (P6: 67, wife)\nOther carers found this experience upsetting, feeling that they would rather not consider\nwhat might happen in the future, but just `deal with the here and now'.\nI personally don't gain benefit from talking with others who have more severe problems, for\nwhatever reason and whatever stage \u00ad aggression, violence or anything like that. I know it does\noccur but I don't want to hear about it because I'd rather deal with the situation that exists, not\none that might exist. (P18: 73, husband).\n`I realised there were things that you could do'. Learning about new coping strategies led some\ncarers to change their behaviour, creating more `positive periods of time' together, including\nengaging their relative in activities such as dominoes, cooking and creating memory boxes.\nI found it helpful to discover an activity I could share with L . . . Rather than just sitting looking\nat each other we could share something together. Another thing I found helpful is the writing\ndown things, like daily activities, because I wasn't writing things down. I was given a pad to write\nThrough developing skills and confidence in coping, some carers reported a reduction in\nanxiety around leaving their relative alone.\nI can leave him, even to go up to the corner shop and know that he will be alright. I wasn't able to\ndo that before going to the groups. I now don't worry so much and can relax a bit. (P10: 70, wife).\nFurther changes in how carers communicated with their relative also occurred. One carer\nidentified that they now direct conversation towards a different topic instead of trying to\n`correct' inaccurate beliefs held by their relative.\nNow, I don't give him orders \u00ad I just say it in a couple of words. I don't give him a long sentence\nbecause he won't remember what he's doing and he'll get more flustered. If I raise my voice he\ngets flustered. When you've said something five times, your voice does get a bit higher, but I try\nnot to do that now because I can see it in his face. (P5: 71, wife)\n`I don't always have the time'. Due to the additional demands on carers' time including having\nyoung families and being in employment, some carers found they were unable to implement\nthe new tools and techniques learnt in the group, leading to feelings of guilt. It was felt that\nthe techniques would be of benefit to their relative if they could put into practice what they\nhad learnt.\nI think it's had a negative impact on my confidence because I felt there is so much I can do with\nhim but I'm not doing it. There is that push to do it for him but there wasn't anything for me.\nThere's a lot more I could do for J . . . but it means spending a lot more time with him and I am\nFurthermore, perception of other carers as successfully coping made others feel that they\nshould be doing more.\nI know that T . . . goes to a day centre five days a week and J . . . does cooking. My cooking\nskills have gone by the board but I felt I should make more of an effort. I haven't done it. (P2: 85,\nwife).\n`It helped me to see how others were coping'. Observing other carers in the group display\nnegative emotion towards their respective relatives allowed carers to reappraise their own\nnegative feelings. Carers reported experiencing feelings of `irritation' and `frustration',\nhowever seeing other carers with similar feelings relieved some of their guilt at\nexperiencing these feelings.\nIt was good to see one or two others show their exasperation. I suppose I was castigating myself\nfor not having the patience and looked upon it as letting him down. (P2: 85, wife).\nFurthermore, seeing other carers successfully cope with their relative, helped carers to\nbelieve that they too could successfully cope.\nWe're in control of his happiness, in a sense, as much as you can be. Seeing other people doing it\nas well hammers it home that you can do it. You don't have to put them in a home, at this stage,\nanyway. But you can never say never \u00ad it depends how it goes. (P4: 58, son).\nBut some carers felt that they did not `fit in', due to differences in previous experiences or\ncurrent situations, leading to feelings of isolation from other group members.\nWhen I heard all the other stories of the other participants and saw what they were coping with,\nwhich were already diagnosed memory losses, I didn't know where J . . . was in this picture and\nsometimes I wondered whether he should be there or not. (P6: 67, wife)\n`It was reassuring that I was doing all the right things'. Hearing about coping strategies from\nother carers and group facilitators enabled carers to feel reassured that they had the\ntools to cope with future situations, improving confidence in their own coping\nabilities. Additionally, carers were given reassurance that they were coping\nappropriately.\nIt was reassuring that I was doing all the right things, as well \u00ad the practical things at home.\nSo it was reassuring so I suppose, yes; but there are times when I feel absolutely inept. (P13:\nLearning from other carers was frequently identified as playing a key role in providing\nreassurance to carers. Gaining practical coping strategies increased carers' confidence in\ndealing with similar situations in the future.\nIt gave us the time to talk about any problems we had and to talk with others and found out how\nthey managed; their coping strategies and how they felt about how things were going with their\nReassurance was of particular importance for carers with a less supportive family network\nI don't get a lot of positive feedback from my sister and my brother does not get involved at all,\nso I decided to do it anyway. So, it gave me the confidence to think I am approaching it the right\nDiscussion\nThis is the first study that has used qualitative methodology to explore the experiences of\ncarers attending a joint reminiscence group for people with dementia and their carers'. It\ndemonstrates the value placed on peer support by family carers but also highlights some of\nthe potential risks of introducing new skills and techniques to carers in the absence of\nsupport to implement those techniques.\nSocial context of carers\nAn important over-arching theme to emerge was the social function of the group for carers.\nWhen people with dementia have difficulties participating in social interactions, carers may\ntherefore experience a reduced social network resulting from stigma or lack of opportunities\nto socialise (Croog et al., 2006). The group provided `bridging' relationships which allowed\ncarers to feel less isolated and provided reassurance through social comparison and\ninteraction with other carers.\nCarers identified the importance of attending the group together with their relative,\ndescribing this as providing more things to talk about and enjoying having a shared\nactivity. Whilst this joint experience was beneficial to both adult-child and spousal\ncarers, the experience appeared to be especially valued by spousal carers. Dementia\ncan lead to changes in relationship between the carer and care recipient (Noyes\net al., 2009) and a loss of activities undertaken as a couple (Elvish, Cawley, &\nKeady, 2013). Hellstrom, Nolan, and Lundh (2007) suggest that one aspect of living\npositively with a spouse with dementia may be a focus on `sustaining couple-hood'\nwhich concentrates on maintaining shared activities. Spousal carers may look to\nretain their identity as a wife or husband through preserving the identity of their\npartners and themselves as a couple (Perry & O'Connor, 2002). Maintaining social\nroles as a couple may therefore act as a coping strategy for spousal carers, acting as\na buffer against the challenges faced.\nCarers also highlighted the value of comparisons to other carers. Seeing others coping\nwell with their caring situation provided reassurance to some carers, whilst downward social\ncomparison with those worse off also made people feel better about their own situation. On\nthe other hand, seeing others with similar conditions created a sense of sadness for some\ncarers, which has been shown to lead to disengagement from such social contact to protect\nthemselves from witnessing situations which they may possibly face in the future (Locock &\nBrown, 2010). Obtaining guidance through comparisons with similar others helps people\nassess the appropriateness of their own attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours against standards\nof the other group members (Marsden & Friedkin, 1994). Such feelings are likely to fluctuate\nover the caring duration and should be considered by health professionals when considering\npossible interventions.\nExpectations of carers\nIn some instances, carers' expectations of the group were not met (e.g. not having enough\n`carer only' time) which led to feelings of frustration and additional stress. Expectations may\nhave related to carer needs that in turn may be related to motivations to care. Eisdorfer\n(1991) identified several motivations to care: a sense of love or reciprocity, spiritual\nfulfilment, a sense of duty, guilt, or social pressures. Spousal carers may have more\nintrinsic motivation which may reduce their psychological distress as compared to the\nmore extrinsic motivation of many adult children who may feel obligation and duty to\nprovide care for their parent (Pinquart & Sorenson, 2011). Some carers do not even\ndefine themselves as a carer; instead, they view their actions as a natural extension of\ntheir relationship (Elvish et al., 2013). Spousal carers who may face physical health\nproblems and lack of opportunities to socialise may benefit from the social aspect and\nvalue the opportunity to socialise together, whilst the adult\u00adchild carers may benefit from\nthe more educational and skill building aspects. Those carers who saw the groups as being of\npotential benefit to the person with dementia, appeared disappointed that positive effects \u00ad\non mood, memory, and confidence \u00ad were short-lived, in some cases being specific to the\ngroup meeting.\nLearning new skills: Reduction of, or addition to, carer stress?\nThe group enabled carers to acquire new skills and be reassured that they had the `tools' to\ncope with future situations which may arise within their caring role. Carers who reported\nhaving little support from their family network especially reported feelings of reassurance\nand benefit from learning skills. This reassurance may develop though improving carer's self-\nefficacy within their caring role. Exploring carers' self-efficacy may also be important in\ndetermining who may benefit most from interventions (Biegel & Schulz, 1999).\nHowever, some carers reported difficulties in utilising the skills that they had learnt within\nthe group and subsequently experienced some feelings of guilt. Many working age carers\nhave conflicting responsibilities, such as their careers, young children, or adolescents who\nrequire support and attention and experience role conflicts, increasing their risk for role\noverload (Barber & Pasley, 1995). By providing carers with information and advice on how\nto support their relative, carers may develop the belief that they `must' take on the role of\ninformal carer. If they are unable to implement the tools they have been given then carers\nmay experience self-critical thoughts about themselves and their abilities to care affectively.\nThis aspect may go some way to explain why carers in the original study showed an increase\nin levels of anxiety following their RYCT (Woods et al., 2012).\nPositive and negative effects of joint reminiscence groups\nThe beneficial effects of the groups were largely centred around the sense of support from the\ngroup, feeling less isolated and alone, and the opportunities to learn new ways of coping or\nsimply to be reassured that they were doing the right things already. Additional benefits\ncame from a shared experience with the person with dementia and having more things to talk\nabout. The negative aspects included the lack of a break from the person with dementia, and\nthe lack of emphasis on the carers' own needs, with the separate time for carers not being\nseen as sufficient by some. Seeing the person come alive in the group meeting, but not being\nable to maintain this change subsequently was difficult for some carers. Seeing people with\ndementia who exhibited more marked impairments than their own relative was appraised as\nan opportunity for learning by some carers, but to others it was experienced as an\nunwelcome vision of the future. Similarly, as mentioned above, seeing new ways of coping\nthat cannot then be implemented may be an additional stress for some carers.\nStrengths and limitations\nWhilst there is a relatively small sample size, its diversity of social backgrounds,\nrelationships, duration of engagement with the reminiscence group, covered wide\nvariations in the experiences of family carers. The sample size clearly does not permit\ngeneralisation to other carers however the topic guide for the data collection facilitated\nthe emergence of individual experiences and gave carers space to share their story which\nallowed for a rich amount of data to be gathered. The data-led analysis, researcher, and\nparticipant validation also increased validity of the results, however validation was only\ncarried out with a proportion of participants rather than the whole sample (6 out of 18).\nImplications\nService provision\nThe results from this study could have implications in terms of service development and\nprovision. Firstly, carer outcome and experience of reminiscence appears to vary depending\non the direction of caring relationship. In line with Pinquart & Sorenson (2011), spouses and\nadult children carers may have different needs and may struggle with different issues. As a\nresult, spouses may benefit most from a reduction of carer demands (e.g. respite), whereas\nchildren may gain most from family-focused interventions targeted at strengthening the\nrelationship with the care recipient. Carer expectations may be more carefully managed\nbefore engaging in such an activity to ensure that expectations of the group are realistic\nand in line with the aims of the group, for example, limited time apart from their relative.\nDifferent subgroups of carers may need more tailed interventions. Adult\u00adchild caregivers\nmay be less likely to relate to spousal carers and find more meaningful comparisons to those\nin a similar caring situation.\nSecondly, in order to consider the difficulties for some carers in the implementation of\nskills learnt in the group, psychosocial groups may usefully complement the skills training\nwith a more comprehensive and individualised model of support (Kurz, Wagenpfeil,\nHallever, Schneider-Schelte, & Jansen, 2010). This would not only include the acquisition\nof new skills but also the systematic transfer of newly acquired skills into the everyday\ncontext, and active expansion of the caring network. This would hopefully combat some\nof the guilt that carers identified when they were unable to utilise skills learnt in the group.\nThis may be supported by combining group and individual formats of treatment delivery\nand by targeting specific caregiver subgroups such as spouses or children.\nFinally, expectations which carers place on themselves in terms of their care-giving role\nshould be explored further. Services that view family carers as being an extension to the\nprofessional caring team have been criticised (Henderson & Forbat, 2002; Nolan, Ingram, &\nWatson, 2002) for polarising the roles of carer and cared for, with little consideration of the\nnature of the relationship. Health professionals should be aware of the assumptions they\nmake around the role of family members in caring for people with dementia, especially\ntaking into account cultural and social expectations including the role of adult\u00adchildren and\nspouses as this may guide more appropriate referrals to interventions. Vernooij-Dassen,\nDraskovic, McCleery, and Downs (2011) found that cognitive reframing; including\nchallenging carers' beliefs about their responsibilities to their relative has the potential to\nrelieve feelings of anxiety, depression and stress.\nResearch\nWhilst studies have acknowledged that attention needs to be paid to different subgroups of\npeople with dementia in targeting effective psychosocial interventions (e.g. Smits et al.,\n2007), few have emphasised the need for consideration of subgroups of carers. In order to\nsupport carers effectively and efficiently, research should investigate the benefits of certain\ninterventions for particular subgroups of carers.\nFurthermore, to enhance reminiscence work with carers and their relatives, consideration\nshould be made to the specific type of reminiscence work undertaken. There is increasing\ninterest in life review therapy and the development of life story books with an emphasis on\nan individual's memories, rather than on reminiscing in a group context. A review by\nSubramaniam and Woods (2012) of individual reminiscence work found that where\nstudies included life review therapy there were immediate and longer-term psychosocial\nbenefits to people with dementia compared to work that was less personalised and\nmemory triggers were less specifically relevant to the individual. In terms of carers\nlearning about their relative and spending time together, the more personalised life-review\nprocess may have greater impact for carers then a less personalised approach. This then\nmisses out on the potential benefits of a supportive network of other carers and of learning\nfrom and comparing with their experiences.\nThis study has used a heterogeneous group of carers which means that it is difficult to\nidentify benefits for particular subgroups of carers (Zarit & Toseland, 1989). Research would\nbenefit from carrying out similar studies targeting particular groups of carers to explore\nwhether this improves outcomes, both quantitatively and qualitatively through comparison\nto similar or non-similar others.\nConclusion\nJoint reminiscence groups have the potential to provide a valuable model of peer support,\nhowever, care is required to manage participant expectations of the group and of themselves\nin their caring role. Increasing our knowledge in this area will help health professionals to\nrefer carers to more suitable interventions which will hopefully increase effectiveness in\nsupporting them within their caring role. Due to the recent trial of joint reminiscence\ngroups failing to support previously positive findings, there is a need for more specific,\ntargeted research within subgroups of carers. More systematic qualitative research into\nthe experience of carers' involvement in such joint interventions could illustrate the\nimpact of reminiscence therapy and clarify the basis for its continued use in dementia care.\n"
