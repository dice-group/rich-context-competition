The revised accord - known under the acronym\nBasel II - will eventually replace the existing accord on capital standards. Its main pur-\npose is to achieve a better alignment of regulatory capital with economic capital by means\nof an adequate measurement of the quality of the banks' assets. However, concerns have\nbeen voiced that the increased risk sensitivity of Basel II might lead to excessive volatility\nin capital requirements. In fact, previous research has shown that capital requirements\nmight increase by up to 45% over the course of the business cycle. The Basel Commit-\ntee has met some of those initial concerns by making the requirements less sensitive to\nrisk changes than originally envisaged. Having said that, many observers still expect the\ncyclicality of capital charges to be significant.\nA better measurement of credit risk in Basel II will bring about clear microeconomic\nbenefits as it reduces the opportunity for regulatory arbitrage. On the other hand, cap-\nital management might become more difficult because capital charges may increase just\nwhen banks are seeing their equity capital erode due to write-offs in their loan portfo-\nlios. Furthermore, cyclical changes in capital charges can have a pro-cyclical effect on\nthe macroeconomy when banks are forced to reduce their lending during an economic\ndownturn.\nPrevious research has largely focused on the pure cyclicality of capital charges, whereas\nour paper tries to assess their pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy, too. To this end,\nwe introduce a model of the bank lending channel which explicitly takes into account\nminimum capital requirements. One novel feature of this model is that it allows banks to\nhold a capital buffer on top of the regulatory minimum. This is important because a bank\nmight react to an increase of capital charges by reducing its capital buffer rather than its\nloan supply.\nWhen calibrated to real data our findings suggest that the capital buffer does indeed\nplay a crucial role in mitigating the volatility in capital charges as it reduces the cyclicality\nof the actual capital ratio by roughly half when compared to the regulatory minimum. The\nresults also show that the pro-cylical effects on the macroeconomy are unlikely to be severe.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\noffentlichte der Baseler Ausschuss f\u00a8\nur Bankenaufsicht eine neue Rahmen-\nvereinbarung zu Mindesteigenkapitalanforderungen an Banken (Basel II).

A revision was deemed necessary since the existing accord led to\nsevere market distortions as banks swapped low-risk assets against riskier ones with more\nfavourable risk weighting relative to their expected returns (regulatory arbitrage). The\nnew accord, which will take effect in 2006, envisages better aligning regulatory capital\nwith economic risk (sometimes dubbed economic capital) by attributing more adequate\nrisk weights to the banks' assets.2\nAlthough the micro-economic foundations of capital requirements are now fairly well\nunderstood, their macroeconomic consequences are still rather opaque. Concerns have\nbeen voiced that the increased risk sensitivity of Basel II might lead to excessive volatility\nin banks' capital ratios. Hence, in opposition to the original intention, overall financial\nstability might be jeopardised.\nIn essence, minimum capital requirements consist of a measure of portfolio risk and\na mapping of risk to minimum capital. Banks which are subject to minimum capital\nrequirements are required to hold at least the minimum required capital. With respect\nto the measurement of credit risk, two approaches are usually considered: either by asset\ntype or by asset quality. The first one ranks assets by classes of borrowers and attributes\na fixed risk weight to each of them according to their perceived fundamental risk. Total\ncredit risk of a bank's portfolio is given as the weighted sum of its constituent assets. By\nconstruction, portfolio risk does not change over time when the total sum of assets and\nthe share of each asset type remain constant. By contrast, risk measures based on asset\nquality such as the value at risk (VaR) try to assess potential economic losses and may\nvary over time. We will say that corresponding risk weights are risk-sensitive.3\n3Quality based risk measures can be further distinguished between those, which are calculated for each\nasset separately on a stand-alone basis and those which also take correlation effects between assets into\naccount.\nIn order to harmonise international capital regulation, the Basel Committee published\nthe so-called Basle Capital Accord in 1988, which has since become a cornerstone of\ninternational capital regulation. It largely depends on fixed risk weights. Credit risk is\nmeasured as the 8 per cent share of a bank's risk weighted credit exposure.4 For example,\nOECD countries have a risk weight of 0 %, banks in OECD countries have a risk weight\nThe accord has always been subject to criticism since it does not truly reflect a bank's\ncredit risk. To remedy that deficiency the Basel Committee recently carried out a major\nrevision of the capital accord (Basel II). When it takes effect in 2006, banks will be able to\nchoose from among several approaches. The standard approach is based on the borrowers\npublic ratings such as those from Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch IBCA. Specific risk\nweights are attributed to the respective rating classes, ranging from 0% for a AAA rating\nto 150% for ratings below B-. More sophisticated banks will be eligible for the two IRB\napproaches 5, which permit the use of the banks' own internal rating systems to quantify\nthe creditworthiness of their debtors. In the IRB approaches banks must estimate the\nprobability of default (PD) of their debtors, which is calibrated to a time horizon of one\nyear. Capital charges are calculated by means of a risk weight function which attributes a\nspecific risk weight to the probability of default. In both the standard approach and the\nIRB approaches total capital charges are given by the 8 per cent share of risk-weighted\nassets.\nAligning regulatory and economic capital has obvious microeconomic benefits as it\nreduces regulatory arbitrage. However, by increasing the sensitivity to credit risk, the\nnew accord will also make required minimum capital more cyclical. This might pose\nsevere capital management problems to banks, as capital charges are likely to increase\nin an economic downturn just when banks are seeing their equity capital erode due to\nwrite-offs in their loan portfolios. Importantly, the cyclicality of capital charges might\nalso have significant macroeconomic consequences in an economic downturn, when raising\nnew capital is difficult and banks are forced to reduce their lending. In the following we\nwill therefore distinguish between the cyclicality of capital charges and its pro-cyclical\n4The Accord was amended in 1998 by the inclusion of market risk in order to take account of the\ngrowing significance of banks trading book positions. Apart from the prudential recognition of market\nrisk, the 1998 amendment was important in regard to another aspect, as it allowed banks for the first time\nto calculate their market risk positions by means of their own value-at-risk based market models.\n5Internal Ratings Based Approach\nconsequences to the macroeconomy. We think that, in doing so, we are filling a gap in\nthe existing literature, since most studies so far have concentrated on the purely cyclical\neffects of Basel II.\nMany empirical studies on Basel II expect significant swings in minimum capital over\nthe course of a business cycle. However, the variety of estimates is rather large. To a\ngreat deal this can be explained by the different approaches the authors take. Most of\nthese studies assess the cyclical patterns of capital charges under Basel II by performing\nnumerical simulations on hypothetical or real world portfolios. Those portfolios are held\nconstant over time and no adjustments are assumed over the observation period. For\nexample, Ervin and Wilde (2001) start from a hypothetical portfolio of BBB-rated bor-\nrowers. They conclude, that, in 1990, a bank with an initial capital ratio of 8% would\nhave seen its capital ratio fall to 6.8% under the IRB approach.6 A similar approach is\ntaken by Kashyap and Stein (2004) who base their simulation on a set of borrowers, which\nhad a public rating of S&P or KMV. Their results show that for an average portfolio the\nincrease in capital charges would have been in the range of 30% to 45% over the period\nosch (2002) differentiates between the default risk effect and the tran-\nsition risk effect. Using S&P's transition and default rates from 1982 to 2000 he concludes\nthat these effects may lead to an offset in capital requirements and, thus, Basel II might\nbe even less cyclical than the current accord. A different approach is taken by Carling,\nJacobson, Lind\u00b4\ne, and Roszbach (2002) who directly estimate the quality distribution of a\ncredit portfolio from a larger Norwegian bank. They show that macroeconomic conditions\nhave a significant impact on borrowers' PD and thus on regulatory capital under the IRB\napproach of Basel II.\nAlthough empirical studies show that capital charges will vary significantly over the\nbusiness cycle for a fixed portfolio, it would be premature to assume a similar pattern for\na bank's actual capital ratio. In fact, banks might hold a certain capital buffer to offset\nunexpected shortfalls in capital or increases in capital charges. A more recent study comes\nfrom Barrios and Blanco (2000), who show that banks hold a positive capital cushion even\nif economic capital is below the regulatory minimum.\nSeveral studies tried to estimate the bank's optimal capital buffer. One early study\nis from Marcus (1983) who set out to explain the dramatic decline of capital of U.S.\n6Calculations were based on the proposed risk weight function as of 2001. As the risk weight function\nhas changed since, the effect is likely to be smaller.\ncommercial banks from 1961 to 1978. A recent study along this line is by Ayuso, P\u00b4\nerez,\nand Saurina (2004) who estimate the relationship between the Spanish business cycle\nand the capital buffer held by Spanish commercial and savings banks. An interesting\napplication of capital buffer theories to Basel II is provided by Jokivuolle and Peura\n(2001), who run simulations for different hypothetical portfolios to obtain estimates for\nboth capital charges and the capital buffer of a typical bank.\nTwo main conclusions can be drawn from the empirical and theoretical studies on\nthe cyclicality of minimum capital requirements and capital buffers: (i) Under Basel II,\ncapital requirements are likely to increase during economic downturns and decrease during\nupturns. (ii) Capital buffers are generally positive, but there is no consensus on whether\nthey move in parallel or instead in reverse to the overall economic development.\nAs we mentioned above, it is important to distinguish between the pure cyclicality of\ncapital charges and capital ratios, on the one hand, and their pro-cyclical effect on the\nmacroeconomy, on the other. So far, little research has been carried out on the second\naspect. One exception is Blum and Hellwig (1995) who claim that minimum capital\nrequirements (with fixed risk weights) reinforce macroeconomic fluctuations. They derive\ntheir theoretical results from a straightforward macroeconomic model which accounts for\nregulatory constraints on banks' ability to lend. However, in our view, one drawback of\ntheir model is the crude way it models the bank lending channel. This is one reason, why it\nis unable to explain banks' capital buffer, ie. in this model minimum capital requirements\nare always binding.\nThere is an ongoing debate among macroeconomists over the role of bank lending in the\npropagation of business cycles and the transmission of monetary policy. In this context,\nbank lending has a special role as a source of finance, which cannot be easily assumed by\ndecentralised capital markets.7\nTraditional theories of the bank lending channel did not account for regulatory con-\nstraints on banks' ability to lend. In a recent theoretical paper Van den Heuvel (2002)\nexamines the role of bank lending in the transmission of monetary policy in the presence\nof capital adequacy regulations. An interesting side aspect of his model is, that regulatory\nconstraints do not necessarily become binding, ie banks hold a positive capital buffer.\nThe present paper is organised as follows: In chapter 2 we present a simple model of the\nbanking industry. We introduce the regulatory framework and derive the target function\nof a representative bank for its actual capital ratio. In chapter 3 we assess the cyclicality\nof banks' capital ratio. The second part of the paper investigates the pro-cyclical effects\nof capital requirements on the macroeconomy. Chapter 4 provides the macroeconomic\nframework before we examine macroeconomic volatility under different regulatory regimes\nin chapter 5. In chapter 6 we try to calibrate the model to real world data. Chapter 7\nconcludes.\n2 A model of the banking sector\nIn our framework for the financial sector the banking industry can be described by a\nrepresentative bank. The bank can invest into two different assets: riskless bonds (B) and\nloans (L), which are subject to default risk. The bank finances its investments through\nequity capital (E) and customer deposits (D). We assume that the bank is unable to\nraise additional equity capital, which seems a reasonable assumption for the short term\nhorizon we have in mind. Therefore, the only way the bank can increase its capital base\nis by retained earnings. In addition, we presume that the amount of deposits is fully\ndetermined by money demand.\nIn the sequel, we assume a time horizon of one period (usually one year). At the\nbeginning of that period the bank decides on its portfolio of loans and bonds. Its decision\ndepends on interest rates, which we denote by r and  for bonds and for loans respectively.\nIt also depends on the perceived credit risk of loans, since the bank takes into account\nthat a random fraction s of the borrowers defaults at the end of the period. For simplicity,\nwe assume that, if the borrower defaults, the bank must write off the total amount of\nthe loan.8 Hence, assuming that interest rates on bonds and loans are given by r and ,\nrespectively, and ignoring any interest payments on deposits, the profit or loss at the end\nof the period is given by  = ( - s) L + r B. In table 1 we depict a bank's typical balance\nsheet at the start and at the end of the period.\nThe bank is not fully free to determine the composition of its asset portfolio. Even in\nthe absence of any regulatory or reserve requirements, the bank must protect itself against\ninsolvency due to an unexpected loss in its loan portfolio. Usually a default is assumed\nto occur when the bank's equity capital is used up. The bank is also bound by regulatory\nconstraints, which require that the regulatory capital ratio exceeds a threshold a. The\n8Alternatively we may also assume a fixed, positive recovery rate, but that would not change the\nsubsequent analysis in a significant way.\nTable 1: Balance sheet of the representative bank at the beginning and at the end of the\nperiod\nAssets Liabilities\nAssets Liabilities\nB E + \nA +  A + \nregulatory capital is defined as the ratio of equity capital to risk weighted assets. Without\nloss of generality, we assume that risk weighted assets are given by w \u00b7L, with w being the\nrisk weight for loans (bond are weighted with 0). It is convenient to normalise the bank\nbalance sheet variables by L. Denoting the capital-loan ratio (CL-ratio) by e regulatory\nconstraints require that e exceeds a \u00b7 w.\nIn our model, the regulatory requirements (e > w \u00b7 a) are stricter than the solvency\nrequirements (e > 0). In fact, we argue that regulatory requirements shift the default point\nfrom 0 to a \u00b7 w \u00b7 L. Because the default is associated with significant costs to the owner\nor to the managerial board, the bank holds a positive capital buffer (CL-buffer) e - a w\nagainst unexpected losses in its loan portfolio. However, holding a capital buffer is not\ncost-free because, by investing in riskless bonds, the bank foregoes lending margins. For\nthe sake of simplicity we dispense with modelling the costs of default explicitly. Instead,\nwe assume that the bank tries to achieve a target probability of its own default p. A\nconservative bank would target a small p, a bank with a large appetite for risk a large p.\nThe parameter p may be associated with a certain rating the bank tries to achieve.\nIn our model the bank derives its optimal portfolio of loans and bonds by maximising\nexpected profits under funding constraints and regulatory requirements. At the end of\nthe period the bank's equity capital is given by the banks initial capital plus or minus\nany profits achieved or losses incurred during the course of the period. Since the loan loss\nrate s is random the bank is unable to predict the realisation of s with certainty. We do\nassume, however, that the bank knows its exact probability distribution.\nProvided that the bank's target probability of default is given p the regulatory con-\nstraint can be written as:\nP[e + /L < a w] = p (1)\nActual Capital\ne*\ne*\ne**\nRegulatory Capital\nFigure 1: Buffer capital of banks\nIn the appendix we derive the following expression for the bank's optimum CL-ratio:\ne = k ( -  + r + \u00af\ns + w a) (2)\nwhere k is a parameter which depends negatively on the bank's leverage ratio A\nE\n, and  is\nan indicator of the bank's risk aversion.9.\nThus, the bank's CL-buffer is given by\n = e - w a = k ( -  + r + \u00af\nNote that the CL-buffer is positive provided that the bank is sufficiently risk averse,\nie that its target probability of default p is small.10\nThe more risk averse the bank is, the higher it sets its CL-buffer. Apart from the\nbank's risk aversion, the buffer also depends on interest rates. The bank will extend more\nloans when loan interest rates rise and it will reallocate a greater portion of its funds\nto bonds when the loan spread contracts. The relation of capital charges and capital is\ndepicted in figure 1.\nNote that an increase in capital charges by one percentage point does not lead to an\nincrease in the capital buffer to the same amount. Instead it will increase by k percent.\nIf calibrated to real world data k takes values at around 0.5 (cf chapter 6)\n9The parameter  depends negatively on p.\n10Therefore we do not need to introduce an additional regulatory constraint for the start of the period.\n3 The cyclical effects of capital requirements\nAs we stated above, we distinguish between the cyclical effects of capital requirements on\nthe bank's actual capital and their pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy. With respect\nto the former, the cyclicality of capital has two aspects: the cyclicality of capital charges\nand the cyclicality of the CL-buffer.\nWe do not examine the cyclicality of capital charges in greater detail here as it has\nalready been analysed extensively in the literature, in particular with regard to the new\nBasel Accord. Instead we simply take for granted that credit risk is indeed subject to\ncyclical variations. We therefore assume that the risk weight for loans depends on GDP,\nwhich we denote by y:11\nw = w(y), (4)\nFurthermore we will assume a pro-cyclical effect of y on w:\nIt simplifies the subsequent analysis if we impose the following linear structure on w(y),\nie\nw(y) = w0 -\nm\na\nIn equation (6), y0 and w0 may be interpreted as average production and the average\nrisk weight over the course of the business cycle. For our subsequent analysis it is necessary\nto distinguish between two possible changes in the regulatory framework: a rise in the level\nof capital charges and an increase in their risk sensitivity. Therefore we have stated the\nslope of w in terms of a, in the case of which a rise in the capital threshold a does not\naffect \ny\nw a.\nWe now turn to the problem of the cyclicality of capital. In this context it is important\nto distinguish between two related hypotheses, which have been stated in the literature.\nThe hypothesis of cyclical capital buffers holds, that banks decrease their capital ratio in an\neconomic upturn, or, by the same token, that banks increase their loan supply. The second\nhypothesis, which is more important, claims that the stricter regulatory requirements are\nthe more pronounced the cyclical patterns of capital ratios or CL-buffers are.\n11This relationship should be interpreted in a statistical sense. In the context of Basel II w is determined\nthe borrower's probability of default (PD), which itself depends on GDP: w = w(PD(y)). Furthermore y\nmight be interpreted as GDP growth or as output gap to account for time trends.\nIn our setting we define cyclicality of CL-ratios by the sensitivity of e with respect to\nchanges in production y. Since ky and sy may be assumed to be negative (cf Appendix)\nwe derive\ney = k(\u00af\nsy - m) + e\nky\nk\nTherefore, the CL-ratio decreases in an economic upturn and decreases in an economic\ndownturn. In this sense, we can say that CL-ratios move cyclically.\nIt has been claimed in the literature that capital buffers absorb some of the volatility\nin capital charges. However, in view of equation (7) this might not be the case. In fact\nif m is small the CL-buffer might even add to the cyclicality of capital charges as can be\nseen by the following equation:\ny = k\u00af\nsy + e\nky\nk\nNote, that while the first two terms on the right hand side are negative the third term\nis positive12, with the overall effect being ambiguous.\nWe now turn to the second hypothesis - whether or not capital requirements tend to\nincrease the volatility of CL-ratios. First, note that a bank will ceteris paribus increase\ntheir CL-ratios if regulatory requirements increase. At the same time they will decrease\ntheir CL-buffer:\nHowever, although a bank decreases its CL-buffer in response to an increase in cap-\nital charges, this does not imply that the volatility of CL-ratios decreases. Quite to the\ncontrary, from equation (9) we derive:\nThus, an increase in a even reinforces the cyclical behaviour of the bank's CL-ratio e. This\nis true even if risk weights are fixed and do not change over the course of the business\ncycle. Note that the CL-buffer exhibits the same change in volatility as e, ie. ya = eya,\nas we formulated risk weights in such a way that their sensitivity to changes in y is not\naffected by an increase in a.\nTurning now to analysing an increase in m, it is not surprising that the cyclicality of\nrisk weights affects the cyclicality of CL-ratios. It is easily verified that\nIn contrast to the case analysed in the previous paragraph, the CL-buffer does absorb\nsome of the volatility in capital charges. In fact,\nTo sum up, the following conclusion can be drawn from the analysis above: Banks\nadjust their CL-ratio in a cyclical way and regulatory requirements, whether with fixed or\nrisk sensitive risk weights, are likely to increase the cyclicality of CL-ratios. More precisely,\nboth the level of capital charges (a) and the cyclicality of risk weights (m) tend to enhance\nthe cyclicality of capital-loan ratios. Wether or not CL-buffers add to the cyclicality of\nCL-ratios, on top of the cyclicality of capital charges, depends on the slope of the risk\nweight function. Only if risk weight exhibit a relatively strong sensitivity to risk does our\nmodel predict a dampening effect of the CL-buffer.\nOur results have important implication for the assessment of the cyclicality of Basel II.\nFirst, one might overestimate the volatility of capital ratios if one looks at likely changes in\ncapital charges alone without taking account of capital buffers, which tend to absorb some\nof the volatility. Second, the size of the capital buffer does not only depend on the riskiness\nof loans and on the risk aversion of the bank but it also depends on the level of capital\ncharges and on their sensitivity to macroeconomic changes. In particular, according to\nour findings, the CL-buffer is likely to have a dampening effect with regard to changes in\nGDP if risk weights exhibit a relatively strong sensitivity to risk. They may increase the\ncyclicality of CL-ratios if the risk sensitivity is small. Therefore, the prospective cyclicality\nof capital under Basel II cannot be assessed, as was done in some analyses, by combining\ncapital charges of Basel II and capital buffers observed under the current framework.\n4 The macroeconomic framework\nIn the preceding section we analysed to what extent the business cycle influences the\nbanks' capital and lending decisions. This is an important question but it is only one part\nof a wider problem, since capital requirements can also influence the business cycle. To\nanalyse the feedback mechanism between the financial and the real sector of an economy\nwe need to build a model of the credit channel which takes the regulatory framework into\naccount. Our model, which is presented below, builds on standard models found elsewhere\nin the literature.13\nTo simplify the analysis, we assume in our model that output is fully driven by real\ndemand. This is not a severe restriction as our model can easily be generalised to also\naccommodate the supply side. In our model real demand yd depends on income y and\ninterest rates  and r respectively. The equilibrium state of the goods market is given by\nThe demand for deposits arises from the transaction motive and is a function of the\nriskless rate r and income y. We assume, that total deposits are exogenous to the bank:\nIn the following we assume that the riskless interest rate r stays constant over time as\nwe assume no change of monetary policy. This allows us to analyse the cyclical effects of\ncapital regulation on the macroeconomy in isolation from any potential countermeasures\nby the central bank. In contrast to the riskless interest rate, the loan rate is an endogenous\nparameter, and its equilibrium value is determined on the credit market. Using Ld and\nLs to denote the loan demand and loan supply respectively, we give the market clearing\ncondition on the credit market by\nLd(, r, y) = Ls(, r, y). (16)\nWe can tie this in with chapter 2 to derive the representative bank's loan supply from\nits target capital:\nIn addition to standard assumptions contained in standard macroeconomic models, loan\nsupply depends not only on interest rates and output but also on the regulatory framework\n(cf equation 2). As regards loan demand, we do not impose any particular functional form\napart from standard assumption on the coefficients of elasticities.14\n13One similar version, for example, can be found in Bernanke and Blinder (1988). However this model\ndoes not account for capital requirements.\n14That is, we assume Ls\n\nto be negative (price effect) and Ls\ny\nto be positive (income effect). Ls\nr\nis assumed\nto be positive since financial investments represent alternative investments to those in fixed assets, which\nare financed by loans.\n5 The pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy\nWhen analysing the impact of capital regulatory requirements on bank lending and the\nwider economy, it is important to distinguish between short and long-term effects.15 For\nexample, raising the level of capital charges will effect transitory adjustment measures of\nbanks, which in turn will influence the macroeconomy through the bank lending channel.\nThe effect will be the more pronounced the shorter the spell is between the announcement\nof a regulatory change and its implementation. The impact can be significant, but even-\ntually the economy will return to its long term growth path. However, although capital\nrequirements are unlikely to have permanent effects on growth per se, we argue that they\nmay have permanent effects on the volatility of bank lending and on the macroeconomy\nas a whole.\nA suitable way to address the volatility of production is by means of the demand mul-\ntiplier, which measures the extent to which exogenous shocks in production are amplified\nthrough the course of the business cycle.\nLet us assume, for example, that the demand for output is perturbed by an amount .\nThe new output equilibrium is attained at\ny = yd(, r, y) +  (18)\nDifferentiating (18) with respect to  now yields the well-known demand multiplier:\ny = (1 - yd\ny\n- yd\n\nUnder standard assumptions the multiplier is positive and larger than 1. The crucial\nquestion is to what extent the multiplier depends on the level or on the structure of\ncapital requirements. By inspection of equation (19) it is clear that in our model capital\nrequirements can influence the multiplier only via the equilibrium loan interest rate. In\nparticular one needs to assess how y depends on the level and on the risk sensitivity of\ncapital charges ie. on a and m respectively. By virtue of equation (19), if y is a decreasing\nfunction of a then an increase in a will have a pro-cyclical effect on the economy as a result\nof a rise in the multiplier y. In contrast, if y depends positively on a the overall effect\non the economy will be anti-cyclical.\nAs we explained in section above, it is important to distinguish between short-term\nand long-term effects of a change in capital charges. The short term effect of a rise in a\nwill be a reduction in lending. In the longer term, however, banks will be able to raise\nnew capital to bring lending back to its initial level. Let us assume, as a useful working\nhypothesis, that a is being increased by the amount a and, at the same time, the bank\nis being compensated by an increase in its capital to the amount of E. By virtue of\nequation (2), if E = e-1\nk0 w0 E0 \u00b7 a the bank will not change its lending. Therefore,\nto isolate long term effects from transitory effects and to account for short term adaption\nprocesses we will assume that Ea = k0 w0 rather than E being fixed.\nThe market clearing condition on the loan market is given by\nor, in logarithms\nln Ls = ln E - ln e = l (21)\nwhere l = lnLs.\nAs regards loan demand, we assume that it is a function of interest rates and income\nl = l(, r, y). Implicit differentiation of (21) yields\n kya + k m - k sy -\nky\nk\ne = e(l y + e ly) (23)\n (k - le)ya = k w(ly + ly +\nky\nk\nWhile the first term on the right-hand side is positive, the sign of the term on the\nright hand-side is ambiguous. Note that ly + ly is the equilibrium loan growth, which\ncan be assumed to be positive. It is easy to show that ky\nk\nis equal to k r E-1 Dy, ie it is a\nnegative function of money growth. The sign ya depends on whether the \"credit effect\"\nor the \"money effect\" is dominating. It is negative if equilibrium credit growth is strong\nand positive if money growth dominates instead.\nBy comparison, a rise in m has an unambiguous effect on y. Implicit Differentiation\nof equation (22) with respect to m yields:\nym = -\nk\nk - e l\nWhat consequences do our findings so far have for the problem of pro-cyclicality?\nOne important result is that an increase in the level of capital charges does not nec-\nessarily increase the cyclicality of y. This is in contrast with claims elsewhere in the\nliterature (cf Blum and Hellwig (1995). In fact, a rise in a may even have a dampening\neffect on the volatility in production if the income elasticity of money demand is large.\nThe second finding is that an increase in the risk sensitivity of risk weights does indeed\nhave a visible pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy.\n6 Calibration\nIn section 3 we analysed how macroeconomic fluctations influence banks' capital, while in\nsection 5 we studied the feedback mechanism from the financial sector to the real sector.\nBy means of a theoretical model of the banking sector and the bank lending channel, we\nwere able to show that regulatory capital requirements are important in this regard. Of\ncourse, whether or not pro-cyclicality is significant in magnitude depends on the relevant\nparameters. In the following we will investigate this issue in greater detail. It should be\nclear from the beginning, though, that a full empirical analysis is not feasible (due to lack\nof data) nor is it the aim of this paper, which is mainly focussed on the theoretical part\nof the problem. However, although it is inappropriate to directly apply our model to real\nworld data, a first, albeit crude appraisal of the magnitude of the expected effects seems\nfeasible.\nWe first turn to the problem of the cyclicality of banks' capital and investigate the\neffects of a rise in the level (a) and in the risk sensitivity of capital charges (m). As noted\nin chapter 3 we measure cyclicality of capital-loan ratios by ey. In our baseline scenario\nthe regulatory threshold of the risk weighted capital ratio is given by 8%. We also assume\na decrease in GDP of dy = 1%. In the first scenario we assume a rise in a by da = .01,\nwhile in the second scenario we assume a rise in m by dm = 0.08. Scenarios 1 and 2\nare comparable in the sense that in both scenarios capital charges would increase by 1\npercentage point over the course of the business cycle. From equations (11) and (12) we\ndeduce that a bank's capital would increase by\nIn the appendix we show that\nA\nE\nr\nUnder reasonable assumption for the relevant parameters, 16 capital-loan ratios would\nchange by 0.03 percentage point in scenario 1 and 0.5 percentage point in scenario 2. Of\ncourse, those estimates are rather crude and depend on the assumptions made. However,\nwhat the calculations do show is that a rise in m leads to a much higher increase in\ncyclicality as compared to a similar rise in a. Furthermore, the calculations also show,\nthat the buffer capital plays a crucial role in mitigating the cyclical effects of a rise in m.\nIn fact, it reduces cyclicality by roughly 50%.\nWe now turn to analysing the pro-cyclical effect of a rise in m on the macroeconomy.\nWe abstain from analysing a rise in a since the overall effect is ambiguous (cf previous\nchapter). In any case it would be insignificant by magnitude from above discussion.\nAccording to (19), a rise in m would lead to an increase in the multiplier\ndy  yd\n\nwith\nym = -\nk\nk - e l\nSince e and l are likely to be small as compared to k (which is approximately 0.5) one\ncan assume ym = -1. Therefore\ndy  |yd\n\nIn other words, the increase of the multiplier is approximately equal to the loan interest\nrate sensitivity of GDP, or equivalently, to its loan spread sensitivity.\nWhat do the above results tell us for the pro-cyclicality of Basel II? As mentioned\nin the introduction, the major change which Basel II will bring about concerns the risk\nsensitivity of capital charges. In the notation of our model it will change the value of m\nfrom 0 to some positive amount m. As other research papers have pointed out, it is not\nunrealistic to assume that a rise in GDP of 1 percent will decrease the capital charge by up\nto 30 %.17. According to our analysis, the change in the capital ratio will be approximately\nhalf that amount. The pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy largely depends on how\nmany banks adopt the advanced approach and how many the standardised approach. If\nall banks followed the advanced approach, the average value for the risk sensitivity of\n17This estimate also complies with our own empirical analysis on loan loss default rates\ncapital charges m would be equal to approximately 0.2. But even under such an extreme\nassumption, equation (31) shows that the effect on output volatility will be moderate\nprovided that y is smaller than 1. In fact, even if we assume a rather large value for the\ninterest elasticity of output, say 0.5 (with respect to one year) and if we assume that dm\nis equal to 0.2, the demand multiplier would only increase by approximately 0.1. This\nincrease seems small when compared to the total size of the multiplier which is likely to\nbe within the range of 1 to 1.5.\n7 Conclusion\nOur paper contributes twofold to the existing literature on the pro-cyclicality of minimum\ncapital requirements. First, we address the problem by examining the effects on the banks'\ncapital buffer, whereas previous research has largely focussed on fluctuations in capital\ncharges alone. Second, we make a clear distinction between the cyclicality of regulatory\ncapital ratios, on the one hand, and its pro-cyclical effect on the real economy on the\nother. We analyse the pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy by modeling a version of\nthe bank lending channel which explicitly takes the banks' capital decisions into account.\nWith regard to the cyclicality of the capital buffer we find that it is important to\ndistinguish between fixed and risk sensitive risk weights. If risk weights are fixed, the\ncapital buffer is likely to move anti-cyclically, ie it decreases in upturns and increases in\ndownturns. Furthermore, the influence of the level of capital charges on the capital buffer\nis likely to be small. With risk sensitive risk weights, the picture can change completely.\nIf risk sensitivity is relatively large, then capital buffers are likely to move pro-cyclically.\nIn addition, the sensitivity of risk weights to risk changes can have a large impact on the\nsize of those fluctuations. This finding has important consequences for the analysis of\nthe prospective effects of Basel II. In view of our model, the regulatory framework is not\nexogenous to the capital buffer. Therefore, it is illegitimate to analyse the behaviour of\ncapital under Basel II by simply adding today's capital buffer to future capital charges,\nwhich some previous papers seem to have suggested.\nWhen calibrated to real world data our findings suggest that the capital buffer indeed\nplays a crucial role in mitigating the volatility in capital charges as it reduces cyclicality\nof the actual capital ratio roughly by half when compared to the regulatory capital ratio.\nAs regards the pro-cyclical effect on the macroeconomy we find only a limited effect of a\nchange in capital charges on output.\nAppendix\nThe target capital ratio\nThe bank's profit at the end of the period is given by\n = ( - s)L + rB (32)\nwhere s is the random default rate, which has an expected value of \u00af\ns. We assume that\nthe distribution of the normalised default rate s - \u00af\ns is given by F.\nSince profits are random, the bank might be unable to fulfil the regulatory requirements\nif it runs out of capital. A default occurs if E +  < a w L. We assume that, when\ndetermining its credit exposure, then bank sets itself a target probability of default p, ie\nwith probability p or less the bank's capital at the end of the period will be to low to meet\nthe regulatory requirements. In mathematical terms:\np := Prob(E +  < w a L) (33)\nWe assume that the bank maximises its expected profits E[] given its target proba-\nbility of default PD = p and its funding condition B + L = D + E.\nIn equilibrium, the riskless rate r will be less than the net expected return on loans\n - \u00af\ns. Let us assume that r is larger than  - \u00af\ns. Since the profit function (32) of is\nmonotonously increasing in L and B, the bank will then invest all of its assets in riskless\nbonds if r >  - \u00af\ns, which cannot happen in an equilibrium state of the loan market.\nBecause of the monotonicity of the profit function, the default constraint is binding for a\nprofit-maximising bank.\nAfter replacing  by (32) in equation (33) and after some transformations, we derive\nF (e +  + rb - w a - \u00af\nwhere F is the cumulative distribution function of s - \u00af\ns, and e denotes E/L and b denotes\nB/L.\nThus\ne +  + rb - w a - \u00af\nwhere  = F-1(1 - p). Since b = eA\nE\n- 1 one gets\ne = k( + w a -  + r + \u00af\nwith k = 1 + A\nE\n.\nReferences\nAllen, F., 1990, The market for information and the origin of financial intermediation,\nJournal of Financial Intermediation 1, 3\u00ad30.\nAyuso, J., D.
