In particular, they have been concerned about how Americans acquire views\nabout the legitimacy of law and legal authority (Sarat 1977). People do so through a process\nthat includes childhood socialization (Tapp & Levine 1977) and later personal and peer\nexperiences with legal authorities. In particular, the period of adolescence and young\nadulthood is often viewed as key since young men have their most frequent experiences\nwith legal authorities, as do their peers, during this period (Brunson & Weitzer 2011; Fagan\n& Tyler 2005). The most frequent legal authority young people encounter is a police officer\n(Tyler & Huo 2002). The goal of this study is to explore the impact on legitimacy of a\nparticularly salient type of young adult experience with the police--the car or street\nstop--during a particularly central developmental period--young adulthood.\nBeing questioned by the police is a common occurrence in New York City for\nhundreds of thousands of residents and visitors, but particularly for young men of color\nDepartment has engaged in a series of controversial policies and practices in its dealings\nwith the public. These have included zero-tolerance arrests for minor infractions and\nneighborhoods with aggressive stop and frisk tactics (Fagan et al. 2010; Schulhofer et al.\n2011), frequent car stops, and surveillance of suspect groups such as Muslims in their\nplaces of worship and other gathering spots (Huq et al. 2011; Powell 2012; Ruderman\n2012a; Tyler et al. 2010). Many stops and frisks result from enforcement of trespass and\nother quality-of-life laws in both public and private housing. In many instances, citizens\nare either stopped or arrested on suspicion of criminal trespass while attempting to\nenter their own home or to visit family members in those buildings (Davis v. City of\nTrespass enforcement is only one dimension of a larger policy of proactive policing\nin New York and many other cities (Kubrin et al. 2010). Proactive policing emphasizes the\nengagement of police with potential criminal offenders or situations based on any of several\nindicia that crime may be imminent or in process. In New York, those policies have\nproduced more than 4.4 million involuntary contacts between the police and members of\nthe public between 2004 and 2012 (NYPD various years). Of these contacts, about one in\nnine resulted in an arrest or a citation, and about one in five appear to fall short of\nconstitutional grounds of legal sufficiency (Fagan 2013). Almost none turn up guns (0.11\npercent of all stops) or other contraband (1.5 percent). The high rate of error in these\nstops, both constitutionally and in effectiveness, is a potential sore spot that could poison\ncitizen support for and cooperation with the police.\nEach of these police-citizen contacts is potentially a \"teachable moment\" about\npolicing for both citizens and police. Yet both legal and policy debates about proactive\npolicing sidestep these lessons and focus instead on two broader frameworks: legality and\nconstitutional framework set forth in Terry v. Ohio (1968): that \"crime is afoot.\" That\nstandard refers to crimes that either have just taken place, are imminent, or are ongoing.\nTerry defines the conditions when police may approach and temporarily detain a citizen\nbased on the officer's reasonable suspicion that \"crime is afoot\" (Alschuler 2002; Harcourt\n& Meares 2011). The legality standard asks whether the police have acted on the permis-\nsible grounds of stopping people when there is reasonable suspicion.\nEffectiveness is a policy concern, defined in terms of impact of these policies and\npractices in identifying those whose behavior may signal that they are intending to commit\nserious crime, or that they may have just completed a crime (Kubrin et al. 2010). The\nstandard inquiry in this type of evaluation is whether stops turn up active offenders or those\nbeing sought by the police or the seizure of contraband (Knowles et al. 2001; Persico 2009;\nBut neither the constitutional nor policy standards address appropriate police conduct\nwhen dealing with persons who have fallen under the police gaze of suspicion. Neither of\nthese standards or benchmarks addresses how police should go about conducting a field\ninterrogation or search of a suspect; they only address the conditions that can initiate the\ncontact and the factors that can justify increasing intrusiveness during the course of the\ninterrogation. There is some \"teaching\" value in how these formal legal standards shape\npolice behavior and some instructional value for citizens in learning the boundaries of their\nprivacy protections under the Fourth Amendment, but these lessons suggest a narrow\nconcept of legal socialization. At best, these become abstract civics lessons detached from\nthe salience of the moment and the emotional freight that these interactions carry. Our\nrationale for this article is, quite simply, that we object to the dryness of this version of the\ncivics lesson about police power.\nThe \"teachable moments\" from the millions of routine encounters each year under\nproactive policing regimes across the country are hardly abstract civics lessons that are\nconfined to assessments of legality or crime control. Recent research on the police suggests\nan additional criterion that might be applied to the evaluation of police policies and\npractices: how the activities of the police shape public views about police legitimacy. These\nactivities create general and salient impressions about how the police exercise their author-\nity and, in turn, about police legitimacy, even among those not stopped (Carr et al. 2007;\nLegitimacy has become a focus of concern in recent years because popular legitimacy\nincreasingly has been linked to citizen behaviors that are important to the success of\npolicing (Schulhofer et al. 2011). Those behaviors include deference to police authority\nduring personal interactions (Tyler & Huo 2002); acceptance of police authority as an\nalternative to private violence or collective disorder (Jackson et al. 2013); heightened\ncompliance with the law (Jackson et al. 2012a; Tyler 2006a); and increased willingness to\nAccordingly, research on the role of legitimacy in law-related behaviors suggests a\nnot-so-hidden cost to the long-term success of policing efforts if the policies and practices\nof the police undermine their popular legitimacy. Past studies have shown that compro-\nmised perceptions of police legitimacy may be internalized to influence both cooperation\nwith the police and compliance with the law (Tyler & Fagan 2008; Fagan & Piquero 2007;\nJackson et al. 2012a). Effects of policing on legitimacy, cooperation, and legal compliance\nhave been identified in both offender (Fagan & Piquero 2007) and general population\n(Tyler & Fagan 2008; Fagan & Tyler 2005) samples. The results of this research thus far\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 753\nconfirm that the consequences of legitimacy may go well beyond the concerns of the\nindividuals affected to influence public safety.\nIn this article, we examine these dimensions of police-citizen contacts in two impor-\ntant contexts for theory and policy. First, the study site is New York City, a place where\nintensive proactive policing has been institutionalized into the strategic design of policing\nand has become an intimate and deep-rooted part of the social ecology of many neighbor-\nstudy sample is young males between the ages of 18\u00ad26. This population makes up about\npopulation with the highest crime rates, particularly violent crimes that attract police\nattention and that drive public policy. The concentration of crime and policing in this\npopulation, and in the poorest and highest crime neighborhoods of the city, provides\na rich context for identifying the influence of policing on legitimacy and its law-related\nconsequences.\nA. Legitimacy and Law-Related Behavior\nWhat is legitimacy? In the Weberian view (1978), legitimacy is based on beliefs that legal\nauthorities have the right to dictate appropriate behavior. As a consequence, members of\nthe public internalize an obligation and responsibility to follow the law and obey the\ndecisions of legal authorities. Although definitions of legitimacy vary widely, a key feature\nof many is that it confers the right to command and to dictate behavior, and that it\npromotes the corresponding duty to obey (Tyler 2006a). Modern discussions of legitimacy\nare usually traced to the writings of Weber (1968) on authority and the social dynamics of\nauthority. Weber, like Machiavelli and others before him, argued that successful authorities\nand institutions use more than brute force to execute their directives. They also strive to\nwin the consent of the governed so that their commands will be voluntarily obeyed\nOthers suggest that legitimacy of legal authorities is earned, if not negotiated,\nthrough actions that demonstrate its moral grounding. In this view, legitimacy is imparted\nto legal institutions (or other institutions with power over subordinates) when there is\nmoral alignment between those with power and their subordinates. Legitimacy in this\nframework is the right to rule, and this right is earned in part by what Beetham (1991:11)\ncalls \"the degree of congruence, or lack of it, between a given system of power and the\nbeliefs, values and expectations that provide its justification.\" Legitimacy is not a given\npower, but accumulates through dense social interactions with authorities, where accounts\nand evaluations of experiences with the police are shared through efficient information\nmarkets and social networks. There also is an implicit emotional component to this view,\nsuggesting that legitimacy is the product of salient gratifying interactions and, alternately,\nthat it can be corroded through negative interactions. Neutrality in interactions produces\nlittle more than more neutrality, and suggests a situational and transient tie between the\npowerful and subordinates.\nKelman and Hamilton (1995) argue that legitimacy \"authorizes\" a legal actor to\ndetermine appropriate behavior within a specific situation; the citizen then feels obligated\nto follow the directives or rules that authority establishes. Kelman and Hamilton go on to\nclaim that the authorization of actions by authorities \"seem[s] to carry automatic justifica-\ntion for them. Behaviorally, authorization obviates the necessity of making judgments or\nchoices. Not only do normal moral principles become inoperative, but--particularly when\nthe actions are explicitly ordered--a different type of morality, linked to the duty to obey\nsuperior orders, tends to take over\" (Kelman & Hamilton 1989:16). Legitimacy, according\nto this general view, is a quality that is inherently possessed by an authority, law, or\ninstitution that leads others to feel obligated to accept its directives. It is \"a quality attributed\nto a regime by a population\" (Merelman 1966:548). Consistent with the arguments of\nWeber, the suggestion is that perceptions of legitimacy are based on feelings of obligation\nthat are disconnected from substance and material interest. Legitimacy is linked not to the\nauthorities' possession of instruments of reward or coercion, but to properties of the\nauthority that lead people to feel it is entitled to make decisions and be obeyed. People will\nabide by the law and follow police directives even if they disagree with specific guidelines\nand instructions.\nIn this study, we operationalize these dimensions of legitimacy using the three\nelements that have been central to these theories and to past empirical assessments (Tyler\n& Jackson 2014): (1) trust and confidence in the police; (2) the perceived obligation to\nobey; and (3) the judgment that the police and the public are in normative alignment\nconcerning values.\nB. Terry Stops and Proactive Policing in New York\nAdolescents and young adults have uniquely high rates of contact with police, much of it\nyouths, during pivotal developmental stages when adolescents form lasting views of the\nlegitimacy of legal norms and legal actors, the police are the primary face of the state and\nthe first that they are likely to encounter growing up (Fagan & Tyler 2005; Skogan & Frydl\n2004). The growing policy preference for proactive policing over the past two decades\nhas increased the likelihood of police encounters and changed the nature of police-youth\ncontact (Kubrin et al. 2010). In \"proactive policing,\" officers actively engage citizens in\nattempts to detect criminal activity that crime is imminent, ongoing, or recently completed\n(Harmon 2009; Skogan & Frydl 2004). These temporary street or car detentions are\nconstitutionally sanctioned and regulated under Terry v. Ohio (1968). Under Terry, police\nare required to have reasonable and articulable suspicion that \"crime is afoot\" to justify the\ntemporary detention and questioning of a citizen. A series of subsequent cases (e.g., Whren\nscope and nature of when police can make \"proactive\" stops (Harcourt & Meares 2011;\nAlschuler 2002). In addition to street activity, police both in cities and suburbs have become\nubiquitous in schools, often with the authority to make arrests or physical detentions, and\nengage in other enforcement activity such as locker or backpack searches (Kupchik 2010).\nAlthough data limitations complicate comparisons across cities, it seems that\nnowhere in the United States is this practice more prevalent than in New York City (Zimring\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 755\nAfrican-American adolescents ages 16\u00ad17 were stopped one or more times by New York City\npolice in 2006. Comparable rates for Hispanics were 38 percent and 10 percent for white\nyouths.\nThe low yield in crime detection from these stops (Fagan 2010, 2013) raises ques-\ntions about the accuracy of the suspicion animating these stops. The stop regime seems\ncloser to an administrative or actuarial design rather than the highly articulated require-\nments for individualized and \"reasonable\" suspicion envisioned by Terry and also required\nin New York law (People v. DeBour 1976). In many cities, these police-citizen interactions\nare unlikely to result in arrest, summons, or the seizure of contraband (Alpert et al. 2005;\nBailey v. City of Philadelphia 2011; Fagan et al. 2010); rates of return (commonly known as\n\"hit rates\") in some cities have the potential to fall below those of randomized check-\npoints (City of Indianapolis v. Edmond 2000; Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz 1990).\nFurthermore, the burden of involuntary police contact in many large cities falls on black\nand Latino residents, at times to the extent that efficiency is compromised (Alpert et al.\n1999; Banks 2003), raising equity and constitutional concerns about the possibility of\nracial profiling.\nAlthough rates of stops of adolescents and young adults are quite high in New York,\nthe rates are also high across the country. Evidence from the National Longitudinal Survey\nof Youth suggests that more than 15 percent of American youth have been arrested by age\npercent of all males have been arrested one or more times, with higher rates (47 percent) for\nAfrican-American males. The 2008 Police-Public Contact Survey suggests that 13.2 percent\nof U.S. residents aged 16 and 17 had face-to-face contact with a police officer (Eith &\nreported that they had been stopped and asked questions by the police, and \"told off or told\nto move on\" by the time they were in ninth or tenth grade (Hagan et al. 2005).\nBeyond policy and constitutional concerns, unwanted stops also risk emotional and\npsychological harms (Geller et al. in press). Despite the low sanction or seizure rates, these\nstops have the potential to be physically invasive and psychologically distressing. Qualitative\nresearch both in New York City and elsewhere suggests that young men are often hand-\ncuffed, thrown to the ground, or slammed against walls while their bodies and belongings\nForce is significantly more likely to be used against minority suspects in street stop encoun-\nters than against whites (Fagan 2010), compounding the assaults on dignity by including a\ndimension of racial targeting for the most extreme forms of police contact. In interviews,\n1Since the age of majority for criminal responsibility in New York is 16, police are dis-incentivized from recording\nstops of persons who are legal minors. There are limitations on the field interrogations of minors that may serve as\nbarriers to proactive policing of youths. Accordingly, the estimate of the number of persons below 16 years of age who\nare stopped in New York City is likely a conservative figure. See, e.g., Fratello et al. (2013) and Stoudt et al. (2011).\nboth young men and women report that street stops are laced with violence, threats,\nhypermasculine and homophobic invective, and degrading and racially tinged language\nby the police report feelings of embarrassment and sexual intimidation when stopped,\nparticularly when they are frisked by male officers (Ruderman 2012b).\nC. Policing and Legal Socialization\nThese personal experiences with the police also are key determinant of legal socialization,\na process that unfolds during childhood and adolescence to shape the likelihood of youth\ncompliance with the law and cooperation with legal actors (Fagan & Tyler 2005; Fagan &\ntions of injustice among Chicago youth who have been stopped by the police, while\nBrunson and Weitzer (2009) identify feelings of \"hopelessness\" and being \"dehumanized.\"\nAdolescent legal socialization might also be influenced by police activity that teens witness\nin their neighborhoods, even if they are not personally stopped. Rosenbaum et al. (2005),\nGau and Brunson (2010), and Brunson and Weitzer (2009) identify a \"vicarious\" experi-\nence of policing, in which perceptions of the police are influenced not only by one's own\nexperiences, but also by the experiences of others.\nIn this study, we locate legitimacy and the experiences that shape its formation as a\nprocess of legal socialization. We define legal socialization as the developmental process by\nwhich individuals internalize the norms of the law through their direct and vicarious\ninteractions with law and legal actors (Fagan & Tyler 2005). Legal socialization is the\ninternalization of law, rules, and agreements among members of society, and the legitimacy\nof authority to deal fairly with citizens who violate society's rules. What adolescents see and\nexperience through interactions with police, courts, and other legal actors shapes their\nperceptions of the relation between individuals and society. When experiences with legal\nactors are perceived as fair, just, and proportionate, these experiences reinforce the legiti-\nmacy of the law, and can contribute to compliance and desistance. However, when pun-\nishment is delivered unfairly, unjustly, and/or disproportionately, it leads to cynicism about\nthe law, and can contribute to anger and persistence of criminal behavior (Sampson &\nOur concern here is the criminal law, and the relevant law-related behaviors that may\nbe affected by this domain of legal socialization. A person's willingness to support law and\nlaw enforcement is a litmus test of the effectiveness and viability of the efforts of the police\nto manage social order (Tyler 2006a), and while that support can be secured and leveraged\nby the threat of coercion and/or the promise of reward, it is easier in a democratic and\npluralist society to exercise authority through legitimacy, that is, by acting in ways that\npeople find appropriate, reasonable, and just. In this view, legitimacy is a product of how\npolice treat people and make decisions when they are exercising their regulatory authority\n(Tyler & Fagan 2008). Police behavior toward citizens confers a status of democratic\nbelonging and social identity that has important consequences for cooperation between\ncitizens and legal authorities (Bradford 2014).\nEven legally trivial and inconsequential interactions in which a person is not detained\nor arrested--the vast majority of police-citizen encounters in New York--can have a strong\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 757\ninfluence on people's views about the legitimacy of the police. So, too, can vicarious\nexperiences: witnessing other people's interactions with the law and legal authorities. This\nperspective suggests that we should treat each encounter between citizens and the police\n(as well as courts and other legal actors) as a socializing experience--a teachable\nmoment--that builds or undermines legitimacy.\nThe link between procedural fairness and legitimacy is in turn essential to public\nsafety since citizens' views about police legitimacy predict compliance with legal rules and\ncooperation with the police (Tyler 2006a). Procedural fairness affects citizens' cooperation\nwith police and their participation in the co-production of security. Reporting crimes to the\npolice, assisting police in the identification of criminals, and participation in crime-\nprevention efforts are all expressions of cooperation that are strongly influenced by legiti-\nmacy and its predicate of procedural fairness. In other words, police success in fighting\ncrime depends on having public cooperation, which in turn depends on perceptions of\npolice legitimacy.\nBeing stopped by the police has been shown to have both positive and negative\nimplications for legal socialization, depending on the nature of the interactions that\ncitizens have with the police in the course of an encounter. Research with community\nsamples of New York City residents (Tyler & Fagan 2008) and young people in London\n(Bradford 2014) finds that legal socialization is shaped not only by whether respondents\nhad been stopped by the police, but also by their perceptions of procedural justice during\nthe stop: whether they felt they were stopped for a legitimate reason, treated fairly, and\ngiven an opportunity to tell their side of the story, or whether decisions were made via just\nprocedures. Perceived procedural justice varied widely across respondents, and was found\nto be a stronger determinant of perceived police legitimacy than whether the respondent\nreceived a favorable outcome. Fagan and Piquero (2007) found much the same with a\nsample of active offenders ages 16\u00ad21 from two large cities.\nOn the other hand, a strong and proactive police presence also has the potential to\npromote adolescent well-being, positive feelings about the police, and a sense of security\namong urban residents through fair and just practices and improvements to public safety\npredominantly to those not personally stopped by the police, youth may also benefit from\ncontact with the police, particularly if these interactions divert them from risky activities or\nencourage respectful relationship building within their community (Skogan et al. 2008).2\nWhat remains unknown is how these practices affect legal socialization and law-\nrelated behaviors among a general population of older adolescents and young adults, those\nwho are both most likely to have involuntary contacts with the police, and those who are at\nthe highest risk ages for the commission of crimes. Although these policy changes have\nexposed tens of thousands of urban youth to involuntary and frequently aggressive contact\nwith the police, much remains to be learned about teens' experiences of these interactions,\n2In Chicago, for example, Operation CeaseFire sought to divert high-risk youth from gun violence and victimization\nthrough intensive community outreach, including connecting the youth to employment opportunities and \"safe\nhavens\" in their communities. Nearly all CeaseFire \"clients\" interviewed reported that the program had a positive\nimpact on their lives. See Skogan et al. (2008).\nhow these experiences vary across neighborhood and other social contexts, or the impli-\ncations of police contact for adolescent health, attitudes, or subsequent compliance with\nthe law. This project addresses that question using the intensive proactive policing regime\nin New York City as the research setting.\nD. The Present Study\nThis study addresses several questions to elaborate on the relationship between policing,\nlegitimacy, and law-related behaviors. We ask these questions in a research setting--New\nYork City--where street stop tactics saturate many neighborhoods and where, in turn,\nyoung men are frequently and intensively exposed to a policing regime (Fratello et al. 2013;\nrespondents' law-related behavior. The premise of this analysis, as in previous studies (Tyler\n2006b), is that legitimacy is important because it shapes how people act in relationship to\nthe law. Here, we test this premise by looking at the relationship between legitimacy and\nthree important potential or ongoing behaviors: recent violent/criminal behavior; willing-\nness to cooperate with the police by reporting crime and criminals; and willingness to\ncooperate with the legal system by serving on a jury.\nThe argument that legitimacy shapes law-related behavior is not a new one. A number\nof prior studies have suggested that legitimacy influences compliance with the law (Jackson\net al. 2012a; Tyler 2006a), as well as the willingness to accept the decisions made by legal\nauthorities (Tyler & Huo 2002). More recently, research has suggested that legitimacy also\ninfluences the willingness to cooperate with legal authorities, including police officers and\njudges (Sunshine & Tyler 2003; Tyler & Fagan 2008). Hence, it was anticipated that\nlegitimacy would influence law-related behavior, a hypothesis we test below.\nThe second question is whether street/car stops influence legitimacy. This question\nwas addressed both by looking at the number of street stops that people have experienced\nand the degree to which the stops involved more intense intrusions by the police into\nrespondents' lives and liberty. This analysis addressed the question of whether street stops\nundermine or promote legitimacy.\nConsiderable anecdotal evidence suggests that when street stops are conducted in a\nway that is unfair or harsh, they may undermine police legitimacy (Powell 2012; Ruderman\non qualitative studies using interviews with young men (Collins 2007; Delgado 2008; Howell\n2009; Lyons 2002) or observations of citizen reactions to police stops (Gould & Mastrofski\n2004). Those studies provide anecdotal evidence of anger and alienation resulting from\ninvoluntary contacts with the police, evidence echoed in many press accounts of police\nstops. Other studies, net of evaluations of police treatment of citizens, suggest more\nwidespread public acceptance of street stops (e.g., Boydstun 1975).\nAccordingly, the third question involves an analysis of the role of psychological\njudgments about the justice or injustice of police actions during stops in shaping reactions\nto the police. A large literature links people's reactions to personal experiences with the\npolice and general judgments about police behavior to evaluations of the procedural justice\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 759\n2009; Tyler & Huo 2002). This literature leads to the hypothesis that it is not stops per se\nthat undermine legitimacy, but the behavior of the police during those stops (Tyler &\nA contrasting view of street stops focuses on their perceived legality. Police officers, of\ncourse, receive extensive training in the law and the meaning of \"reasonable suspicion.\"\nHowever, their view may or may not correspond to those of the public (Meares et al. in\npress). Further, the police themselves may or may not be following these rules (Gould &\nMastrofski 2004). The issue addressed here is whether public views about whether police\nstops are made using appropriate criterion shape the impact of those stops on legitimacy.\nIf the fairness of police behavior shapes reactions to stops, the question arises of\nwhether the police could engage in frequent stops if they treated people fairly. A further\nanalysis explores the impact of frequent stops on judgments about stop fairness and legality.\nIt explores whether multiple stops lead people to view the actions of the police differently,\nin particular viewing them as less just and legal.\nFinally, the analysis directly tests the underlying argument that stops undermine\nbehavior by examining the influence of legitimacy on three key variables: criminal activity;\ncooperation with the police; and cooperation with the courts. It is because legitimacy shapes\nbehavior that the potential undermining effects of stops on legitimacy need to be examined.\nIt is the argument that stops lower legitimacy and as a consequence raise levels of criminal\nbehavior that more directly counters the suggestion that stops improve public safety.\nThe goal of this analysis is to examine the impact of street stops on the attitudes and\nbehavior of the members of the public who are most likely to experience being stopped in\nthe course of everyday proactive policing--young males in dense urban areas--in a\nsetting--New York City--where these tactics saturate many neighborhoods.\nII. Methods\nA. Samples and Procedures\nA stratified random sample of young men ages 18\u00ad26 in New York City was interviewed by\ntelephone about their history of contact with the NYPD both in their lifetime and in the past\nyear. The study separately assessed respondents' evaluations of stops in the neighborhood\nmore generally. Subjects were randomly sampled from 146 \"neighborhood clusters.\" Clus-\nters were defined from 295 \"neighborhoods\" developed by the NYC Department of City\nPlanning in the 1990s for detailed exploration of social and economic life within socially\nhomogenous neighborhood boundaries.3 Neighborhoods were clustered to optimize and\nmake consistent their size, geographic proximity, and socioeconomic homogeneity. In\nsome instances, populous and spatially large neighborhoods were split to create two smaller\n3See Manbeck and Jackson (1998) for examples of the neighborhood boundaries and socioeconomic composition.\nBoundary files are available from the authors.\nNeighborhoods were then stratified by their per-capita rates of police stops in the past\n24 months and sorted into deciles. Forty neighborhoods were selected, with oversamples\nof neighborhoods in the deciles with the highest stop rates. Initial selection included\neight randomly selected neighborhoods from each of the top three deciles (D8\u00adD10), four\nneighborhoods from each of D5\u00adD7, and one neighborhood from each of D1\u00adD4. The\noversample of high-stop neighborhoods was intended to generate a sample of respondents\nwith greater exposure to stop activity, and greater statistical power to detect the effects of\nhaving been stopped.\nRandomization was broken by selecting the Lower East Side in order to provide\ngeographic diversity and because interviewing was suspended in one cluster following\nSuperstorm Sandy on October 31, 2012.4 Elsewhere, in adjacent neighborhoods with\nlow response rates, smaller neighborhoods were combined, yielding a final sample of 37\nneighborhoods.\nWithin each neighborhood, phone numbers were randomly selected from three\nsampling frames: landline random digit dial (RDD), cell phone RDD, and a listed sample\nobtained from a market research agency. Analyses of characteristics of landline and cell\nphone respondents and the extent of their interactions with police showed few differences\nin the method of recruitment. Although numbers from the listed sample were more likely\nto appear in our sample, and were also eligible to be selected from the RDD samples, the\nlisted sample was \"de-duplicated\" from the RDD sample and, accordingly, could be treated\nas a special stratum within the landline RDD sample. Every landline phone number in New\nYork City therefore had a known probability of selection. The sample was also adjusted to\nnote \"dual-service\" households with both landlines and cell phones (who could have been\nselected from either frame).\nSamples of a minimum of 25 respondents were recruited within each neighborhood\ncluster. Interviews were conducted by telephone. The neighborhood location of each\nrespondent's residence was recorded to analyze persons within neighborhoods. The final\nsample of 1,261was weighted to approximate a random sample of the young men in New\nYork City who were exposed to stop and frisk policing. The sample weights were also\nadjusted for within-household selection, for the rare cases that households contained\nmultiple members in our population of interest (i.e., 18\u00ad26 year old males), and differential\nnonresponse by race/ethnicity, borough, and telephone service. Finally, the distribution of\nthe weights was examined for extreme values, truncated at the 97.5th percentile (to\nimprove the precision of survey estimates), and scaled to sum to the total sample size.\nTable 1 shows the sample characteristics.\nB. Variables and Measures\nVariable domains are listed here, and details on items and scale properties are shows in\nAppendix 1.\n4The Manhattan Beach neighborhood in Brooklyn, a place that was particularly hard hit by the October 31, 2012\nstorm.\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 761\n1. Dependent Variables\nThree dependent variables were assessed: legitimacy; recent criminal activity; and coopera-\ntion with the police and the courts.\na. Legitimacy. The legitimacy scale reflected three aspects of the concept of legitimacy: trust\nand confidence; obligation to obey; and shared normative values. The items reflecting these\nconcepts were averaged and given equal weight to create an overall scale.\nb. Recent Criminal Activity. Self-report was used was to measure recent criminal activity, a\nmethodology supported by comparisons of self-report to other methods for determining\nfrequency of criminal activity (Hindelang et al. 1981; Thornberry & Krohn 2000; Peppers &\nc. Cooperation. Two dimensions of cooperation were assessed to examine specific domains\nof cooperation and to identify unique effects on policing: cooperation with the police and\nparticipation in legal processes. Cooperation included reporting crimes and cooperating as\na witness in investigations. Legal processes included serving on a jury.\nCharacteristic\nUnweighted\nSample\nWeighted\nSample\nRespondent Race/Ethnicity (%)\nEducation (%)\nPublic Housing Resident (%)\nPolice Stop Experience (%)\naSome cells smaller due to nonresponse.\nNote: The sample reflects a diverse group of young New Yorkers, and the weighted sample reflects a random\n2. Background Factors\nRespondents were asked to report their race and ethnicity, their age, the highest level of\neducation attained, and their prior criminal history. For long-term criminal history,\nrespondents were asked (yes/no): \"Have you ever\": \"been arrested\" (28 percent said yes);\n\"received a summons for a criminal violation or a desk appearance ticket\" (DAT) (27\npercent said yes); \"spent time in jail\" (13 percent said yes); \"been on probation\" (11 percent\nsaid yes); and \"served time in prison\" (3 percent said yes).\n3. Generalized Neighborhood Experience with Police\nRespondents were asked to describe two features of police stop activity in their neigh-\nborhood. These judgments about police activity were made on a scale ranging from\n\"frequently\" (1) to \"never\" (5). Respondents were asked: \"How often do the police\" engage\nin various behaviors. Two indices were created: frequency of stops and degree of intrusion\nduring those stops.\n4. Experiential and Performance-Based Evaluations of the Police\nRespondents were asked to report on their general views about police. Domains included\npolice performance in crime control, police legality in making stops, and police procedural\njustice in forming and implementing police policies and services (overall procedural justice\nof the police in the neighborhood).\n5. Personal Stop Experience\nRespondents were asked about several features of their own stop experiences. They were\nasked to identify the one stop in the past year that was the most salient: the stop whose\ndetails \"stood out\" and that they remembered most clearly. Police stop experiences\nincluded perceptions of the legality of the stop reason and four dimensions of the quality\nof police treatment: outcome, police decision making during the stop, police use of\nauthority during the stop (procedural justice), and the degree of physical intrusion and\nforce during the stop.\nIII. Results\nResults are reported with standard errors clustered by neighborhood. Within the sample,\n549 respondents indicated some past year personal contact (including either car or street\nstops), while 712 indicated they had had no contact (44 percent). A higher percentage--85\npercent--of respondents reported at least some lifetime contact through either a street\nstop or a car stop.\nSince some of the results ask about personal experience, we estimated selection\nparameters to distinguish those with past year police contact or lifetime police contact from\nrespondents with no past year or lifetime police stop experience. The nonrandom assign-\nment to prior stop conditions is a problem common in observational studies (see Berk\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 763\n2003) and requires the estimation of additional parameters to avoid common selection\nIndurkhya et al. 2006; Rosenbaum & Rubin 1983), we use propensity scores to adjust for\nthis problem. In short, propensity scores are the estimated probability of membership in\neach of the stop groups that accounts for confounding variables between the outcomes of\ninterest (e.g., legitimacy and law-related behaviors) and the stop conditions. There is no\nreason ex ante to suspect that within this sample of young adult males ages 18\u00ad26 people\nwith prior stop experience would be more or less affected by that stop experience than\nwould be persons who have no prior contact. Accordingly, there is no risk of confounding\nof selection factors and outcomes, making these analytic conditions appropriate for adjust-\nSeparate logistic regression equations were estimated for past year stop experience\nand lifetime stop experience. Predictors included race/ethnicity, age, education level,\npublic housing residency, and criminal justice history (results are shown in Appendix 2).\nFor both past year and lifetime stop experience, the respondent's educational attainment\n(high school graduate or above) and self-reported criminal justice history (arrest or con-\nviction) predicted stop experience. Predicted values for these equations were generated\nand served as propensity scores in each of the analyses that focused on personal experiences\nwhere only those with a past year or lifetime stop provided assessments of conditions of\nspecific stops.\n1. General and Personal Experiences with Police\nWe assessed several questions on the effects of both personal experience and generalized\nperceptions of police stops on perceived legitimacy of the police. The full sample was\nincluded, and controls were introduced to adjust for the probability of police contact as a\npotential influence on those assessments.\nWas street and car stop contact with the police associated with views about legitimacy?\nAt the margins, those with personal contact ranked the police significantly lower in\nlegitimacy (2.84 vs. 2.93, on a 1\u00ad4 scale, with high scores indicating high legitimacy;\nestimated effects of personal contact may have been attenuated, given that all study partici-\npants, including those without personal contact, had the opportunity to observe police stop\nactivity in their neighborhoods and likely formed opinions about police legitimacy based on\nthese observations as well as their personal experiences. They also could have vicarious\nexperiences through police stops of their friends, family members, neighbors, and others\nmoving about in their neighborhoods. This first set of analyses considered both these\npotential influences on police legitimacy, unconditioned by situational or individual factors.\nThe conditional question of street stop influences on legitimacy was addressed\nthrough an OLS regression of the influence of the number and nature of stops on\nlegitimacy. In this case, the dependent variable was respondents' overall perceived legiti-\nmacy of the police. Two models of legitimacy were considered. First, the analysis considered\nthe role of personal history of stops and estimates of the frequency of stops in the respon-\ndent's neighborhood. Second, it estimated the effects of observed or generalized\nexperiences with the police. Predictors included the number of stops and the degree of\npolice intrusion, both in the respondent's own prior personal experience and as a percep-\ntion of general police behavior. An interaction between stop frequency and police intru-\nsiveness controlled for the density of harsh police stops.\nThe analysis controlled for two background factors. The first was the propensity to be\nstopped. This variable was constructed using race, age, education, public housing resi-\ndence, and criminal justice history. Public housing was singularly important because it has\nbeen the locus of intensive police enforcement, and because the patrol tactics in those\nhigh-rise buildings have been conducted in a manner different from patrols in other areas\n(Fagan et al. 2012; Carlis 2009). The models included fixed effects for neighborhood and\nstandard errors were clustered by neighborhood. Table 2 shows the results.\nFor personal experiences, more intrusive police contact was associated with\nmore negative evaluations in terms of legitimacy, suggesting that people reacted to the\nintrusiveness of their prior experience, not the number of stops. In other words, whether\nthe police threatened or used force or were humiliating or disrespectful were the strongest\npredictors of respondents' assessments of police legitimacy.\nResults for general neighborhood experience are also shown in Table 2. The amount\nof explained variance (adjusted R2) for this general level model is 0.290, suggesting that\ngeneral-level judgments mattered more than personal experiences, for which the adjusted\nR2 was 0.149. Again, legitimacy was significantly explained by the intrusiveness of police\nstops. Both believing that there were many stops and that they were intrusive appear to\nTable 2: OLS Regressions of Lifetime Personal and General Stop Experience on Police\nLegitimacy (b, SE, p)\nPersonal Experience General Neighborhood Experience\nb (SE) p b (SE) p\nNote: Respondent's judgments about the frequency and intrusiveness of street and car stops that they have experi-\nenced and that occur shape their views about police legitimacy. All models estimated with standard errors clustered\nby respondent neighborhood. Models control for respondent age, race/ethnicity, education level, public housing\nresidency, and criminal justice history. Models also control for probability of lifetime stop and probability of past year\nstop.\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 765\nshape legitimacy in a negative direction, with general judgments about what the police were\ndoing in the neighborhood estimated to be stronger influences than personal experience.\nAt the general level, respondents were influenced by the perceived number of police stops,\nthe intrusion of those stops, and the number of harsh stops (the interaction).\nAmong this community sample, more intrusive police actions were associated with\nlower ratings of police legitimacy. Overall, the view that there is more police intrusion of\nany type in the lives of people in the neighborhood was linked to lower legitimacy. The\nresults with this sample from a limited age range (18\u00ad26) of persons with the highest\nprobability of being stopped comport with results from other studies. For example, Fagan\nand Piquero (2007) have shown that among young criminal offenders in the same age\nrange, the basic concepts of legitimacy and \"positive\" policing are robust predictors\nof legitimacy. Further, the results follow the pattern found by Fagan and Tyler (2005)\nin a study of the interactions of younger adolescents ages 10\u00ad16 with the police.\n2. Neighborhood Police Behavior and Legitimacy\nHow were evaluations of the justice of police behavior related to the impact of that behavior\non legitimacy? The issue here was whether police intrusion was directly related to legitimacy\nor whether the relationship was mediated by evaluations of the justice of police actions. This\nquestion was addressed by examining the influence of personal experience on the per-\nceived legitimacy of the police. To assess this reaction, respondents were asked to provide\nmore detailed information about the recent experience that \"stands out most clearly in\n[their] mind, or that affected [them] the most.\" It is that critical experience that is central\nto this analysis. Controls included background factors and the probability of experiencing\na stop in the past year. Results are shown in Table 3.\nRespondents reported lower police legitimacy when stops were assessed as being\nprocedurally unfair, illegal, and leading to unfair outcomes. These findings suggest that the\nlevel of exposure to policing did not significantly predict legitimacy, once the fairness of\ntreatment during the stop and police legality were introduced. Respondents saw the police\nas more legitimate when the police were viewed as having acted fairly and lawfully.\n3. Police Practice and Police Legitimacy\nThe previous analysis suggested that respondents' recent personal experiences shaped\ntheir reactions to police authority, particularly the manner in which they experience the\nprocedural fairness in the \"critical\" stop. It is similarly possible to consider how people's\ngeneral judgments about the police behaviors that they observe in their neighborhood have\nshaped their views about police legitimacy. OLS regressions were again used to examine the\ninfluence of these general judgments on assessments of police legitimacy.\nOne reason for stratifying and oversampling by neighborhood was the fact that there\nare strong differences in policing by neighborhood and race, especially with respect to\nproactivity, including stop and frisk activity (Fagan et al. 2012; Geller & Fagan 2010; Fagan\n2010, 2012). This broader spatial pattern suggests that exposure to policing--specifically, to\npolice stops--varies by race. Accordingly, we disaggregated the third model in Table 4--\nestimating legitimacy--by race and examined separate regressions. Models were estimated\nboth for the full sample and then for each race/ethnicity group.5\nTable 4 shows that this set of general judgments about police behavior during street or\ncar stops explains 41.4 percent of the variance in estimating perceived police legitimacy.\nPolice legitimacy was found to be significantly higher among respondents who felt that the\npolice used fair procedures that gave neighborhood views a chance to be heard to determine\ntheir policies and if the police acted fairly when they implemented them. In addition to\nprocedural justice, the legality of police actions and police performance mattered.\nThe race-specific models in Table 4 show similar results, with minor differences\nbetween population groups. For African Americans, intrusive stops were associated with\nlower legitimacy, while procedurally just stops were associated with greater police legiti-\nmacy. Safety was important as well, with effective performance raising legitimacy. For\nHispanics, safety, fairness, and legality were important. Whites reacted to procedural justice\nin forming and implementing policies, but not to police performance. Perhaps their views\nwere shaped by the fact that they live in relatively safer areas and have less exposure to\ncrime--through both personal experience and generalized observations--than other\npopulation groups in the city.\n5Other racial and ethnic groups were omitted due to small sample sizes. These primarily were East Asians and\nSouth Asians.\nTable 3: OLS Regressions of Personal Past Year Stop\nExperiences on Legitimacy (b, SE, p)\nLegitimacy\nb (SE) p\nNote: The perceived procedural justice of stops shapes their impact on\npolice legitimacy.\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 767\nOur estimate of the effects of police actions on perceived police legitimacy may be\nskewed by the unique context of stop and frisk tactics as practiced in New York for the past\n20 years. Over this time, police have placed a premium both on the saturation of high-crime\ncommunities with stop and frisk activity (Bratton & Knobler 1998; Zimring 2011) and the\nHowell 2009). In a broader context, we would expect these stops to range from benign and\nnonintrusive to aggressive and physically rough, varying with the police regime (Brunson &\nWeitzer 2009). But in this regime, these stops may have leaned toward the nonpolite end of\nthe continuum (Geller 2014). So the truncated style of policing is a potentially important\nlimit on the substantive conclusion on style in the piece.\nStill, there is sufficient variation within these data to estimate the effects of stop\ninteraction quality at the extremes from very polite and respectful to harsh and demean-\ning. Figures 1 and 2 show the responsiveness of respondents' perceived legitimacy along\na continuum of reports of police quality of treatment. We estimated Lowess smoothed\ngraphs (Cleveland 1979) of perceived legitimacy both for general police treatment in the\nneighborhood (Figure 1) and for police treatment during respondents' personal contacts\nwith the police (Figure 2). Both figures show sensitivity of legitimacy estimates to quality\nof police treatment across the range of both general and personal police treatment.\nAcross the range of police treatment, perceived legitimacy increases as legitimacy scores\nTable 4: OLS Regressions of Respondent Perceptions of Neighborhood Stop Actions on\nPerceived Legitimacy (b, SE, p)\nTotal African American Hispanic White\nb (SE) p b (SE) p b (SE) p b (SE) p\nFrequency of police stops in\nneighborhood\nIntrusiveness of police stops in\nneighborhood\nPolice policy reflects\nneighborhood views\nProcedural justice of police\nin stops\nNote: Several judgments about police actions in the neighborhood shape views about police legitimacy. Those\ninclude whether the community plays a role in deciding about police policies; whether those policies are imple-\nmented fairly; whether the police are effective; and whether their actions are lawful. All models estimated with\nstandard errors clustered by respondent neighborhood. Models control for respondent age, race/ethnicity, educa-\ntion level, public housing residency, and criminal justice history. Models also control for probability of respondent\nhaving past year stop.\nFigure 1: Legitimacy and fair treatment by police in neighborhood.\nNote: There are positive effects of fair treatment by police on perceived legitimacy across the range of reported fair treatment\nby police in their general interactions with neighborhood residents.\nFigure 2: Legitimacy and fair treatment by police in personal experience.\nNote: There are positive effects of fair treatment by police on perceived legitimacy across the range of reported fair treatment\nduring personal experiences with police.\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 769\nrise from their minimum value (poor treatment) to their highest value. In this setting,\nthen, while polite cops generate far greater perceived legitimacy, even incremental\nchanges at the extremes of impolite treatment produce a positive response in perceived\nlegitimacy. Even in a rough regime of proactive policing, the dose response of legitimacy\nto fair treatment is evident.\nGiven the influence of performance judgments on legitimacy, it is important to ask\nwhat people mean by effective performance. An examination of the underlying correlations\nindicated that the police were viewed as more effective when they were seen as engaging in\nfewer street and car stops (r = -.0267), and seen as less intrusive (r = -0.424). Perceived\neffectiveness was also linked to following the law (r = 0.333) and using fair procedures to\ndetermine (r = 0.387) and implement (r = 0.457) policing in the community. Of particular\nrelevance to the current discussion, the perceived effectiveness of the police performance\nagainst crime was negatively related to the number and intrusiveness of police stops.\nThe important lesson in the race- and ethnicity-specific models in Table 4 was the\nuniversal importance of procedural justice both in policy implementation and in the\nmanner in which stops take place. White and Hispanic respondents' perceptions of legiti-\nmacy were also tied to whether or not they believed that the police generally used appro-\npriate and legal criterion when deciding to make stops. The intersection of both\nprocedural fairness and legality, together with sensitivity to intrusive and harsh police\nstops, in perceptions of legitimacy suggests a detailed picture of an ecology of policing in\na diverse city.\nTable 5 tests for changes in responses to four types of views about police actions as\na function of the respondents' prior exposure to policing in their lives and in their\nTable 5: OLS Regression of Stop Exposure on Personal and General Evaluations of Police\nBehavior (b, SE)\nPersonal Experience Neighborhood Experience\nLegality of\nStop\nProcedural Justice\nDuring Stop\nLegality of\nStops\nProcedural Justice\nDuring Stop\nLifetime Stops\nNote: The more experiences that people have with the police the less likely they are to view police actions as lawful\nand procedurally just. All models estimated with controls for race/ethnicity, age, educational attainment, and\ncriminal justice history. Models estimated with neighborhood fixed effects and standard errors clustered on neigh-\nneighborhoods. This analysis was separately conducted for neighborhood experiences in\nthe past year and in the respondent's lifetime, both for personal experience and for\ngeneral neighborhood experience with police stops. The analyses examined the influ-\nence of prior exposure on: (1) whether respondents viewed the \"critical\" stop they\nexperienced as legal (i.e., did the police have a \"good reason for the stop\"), (2) whether\nthey were treated unfairly in the \"critical\" stop in the past year (i.e., \"treated unfairly\"),\n(3) whether the police generally made stops legally (\"police legality in stops\"), and (4)\nwhether stops were generally conducted in procedurally fair ways (\"police procedural\njustice during stops\").\nFor past year experiences, Table 5 suggests adverse effects of an increasing number of\npolice stops on perceptions of fairness and legality, both in terms of views about personal\nexperience and with general judgments about police behavior. The analysis considers four\ndimensions of experience with police as the dependent variable: whether there was a \"good\nreason for the stop,\" the procedural fairness and interaction quality of police during the stop,\nwhether the respondent felt that the police treated him fairly, and the respondents'\njudgments about the legality of the stop. Legality included questions about whether the stop\nwas racially neutral and whether police followed the law in making the stop and\ntheircomportment during the stop. Fair treatment included questions about fair treatment\nand treatment with dignity and respect. Good reason was a subjective appraisal of the adequacy\nof the police reasons for making stops generally in the respondent's neighborhood. Police\nprocedural justice asks respondents to rate police conduct generally during stops with respect\nto fair and respectful policing.\nFor both generalized and personal experiences, the evaluation of police conduct\nshowed negative effects with increasing stop experience. In each instance, respondents with\nmore experience were more inclined to see each additional stop as unjustified, legally\nquestionable, and characterized by unfair and poor treatment. Perceptions of the legality\nand appropriateness of police stops were increasingly negative with each additional stop\nreported. Perceptions of police procedural fairness also were increasingly negative with\neach marginal stop.\nThese negative views of police conduct suggest that once subjects have a personal\nbenchmark or basis of comparison, future stops appear to be seen as increasingly unreason-\nable and antagonizing. In the context of the very low \"hit rates\" in these stops for arrests or\nsummons (Fagan 2012; Gelman et al. 2007) and the nearly total failure to seize guns or other\nthe negative emotional freight of a stop with respect to how citizens experience the law.\nThese increasingly negative views are shown in Figures 3 and 4. The figures show\nthe ratings of fairness and legality also shown in Table 5, but they examine the range\nofrespondent experiences. As is clear from the figures, more experiences lead respondents\nto view the police more negatively.\n4. Police Legitimacy and Law-Related Behavior\nDoes legitimacy shape personal law-related behaviors? The premise of this article is that\npolice legitimacy matters because it shapes behavior. To test this argument, we estimated\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 771\nFigure 3: Personal and generalized perceptions of police and frequency of stops in\nlast year.\nNumber of Stops in Past Year\nPersonal-legal Personal-fair\nGeneral-legal General-fair\nNote: Judgments about the fairness of police actions are more negative as persons see and experience more stops in their\nlifetime.\nFigure 4: Personal and generalized perceptions of police and frequency of stops in lifetime.\nLifeme Number of Stops\nLifeme Number of Stops\nPersonal-legal Personal-fair\nGeneral-legal General-fair\nNote: Judgments about stop legality and the fairness of police actions become more negative as the number of lifetime police\nstops increases.\nOLS regressions for three specific law-related behaviors: recent criminal activity;6 coopera-\ntion with the police; and cooperation with the legal system. The latter was measured by\nrespondents' willingness to serve on a jury if asked.\nOf the three dependent variables it is recent criminal activity that is most problematic\nas a self-report measure (Piquero et al. 2002, 2014). However, there is substantial evidence\nthat self-report is a good proxy for actual behavior (Thornberry & Krohn 2000). In addi-\ntion, the analysis controls for long-term criminality by controlling for criminal justice\nhistory, which is included in the propensity score.\nThe predictors included legitimacy and factors related to the manner in which police\nconduct stops in the respondent's neighborhood, for example, frequency, intrusiveness, and\nlegality. We also included a measure of police effectiveness in crime control as well as fearof\ncrime, two robust predictors of police legitimacy from earlier analyses. Table 6 shows the\nresults.\nPerceived police legitimacy significantly predicted each of the three behaviors, sup-\nporting the premise of the project. Legitimacy of the police and frequency of stops, police\nintrusiveness in stops, police performance, and fear of crime were significant predictors of\n6Criminal activity was highly skewed: about one in five reported any criminal activity in the past year or lifetime.\nAccordingly, we used the natural log of the scale to estimate the models in a regression model. Respondents reporting\nno criminal activity were recoded to 0.01 to approximate zero criminal activity in the log scale. We also used a\ndichotomized variable (activity; no activity) and performed a logical regression.\nTable 6: OLS Regressions of Legitimacy of Police on Law Related Behaviors (b, SE, p)\nCriminal Activity\n(Logged)\nCooperate with\nPolice Serve on a Jury\nb (SE) p b (SE) p b (SE) p\nNote: Police legitimacy influences law-related behaviors.

Models also control for number of personal stop experiences and prevalence\nof stops in neighborhood.\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 773\ncriminal behavior. Similar conclusions regarding legitimacy emerge irrespective of whether\nthe study uses a dichotomized measure of activity and a logistic regression analysis (results\nnot shown)7 or a regression analysis on the log of activity.\nThe univariate connection between legitimacy and criminal activity is striking. Among\nthose low in legitimacy (below the mean), 30 percent engage in some form of criminal activity.\nAmong those high in legitimacy, 15 percent engage in some form of criminal activity. Hence,\nlow legitimacy doubles the risk of involvement in recent past year criminal activity.\nIn considering the connection of legitimacy to criminal behavior it is important\nto recognize that the causal direction is uncertain. Police may well be harsher with an\nindividual whose criminal activity is known to them. More information about suspect\ndemeanor and background would be helpful in sorting this out. Further, criminally\ninvolved individuals may be harsher in their judgments of the police. Nonetheless, it is\nstriking that legitimacy and criminal behavior are connected and, as has been noted, the\nanalysis controls for lifetime criminal history, providing a lower boundary on the effects of\npersonal history on the legitimacy-criminality relationship.\nThe results for cooperation with police were also strong and confirm the core notion\nthat legitimacy influences law-related behaviors. Legitimacy promotes cooperation, while\nthe view that the police conduct was intrusive undermines it. Cooperation with the\ncourts--in the form of jury service--again suggests the importance of perceived legitimacy\nof the police in law-related behaviors. In addition to legitimacy, police effectiveness was also\na significant predictor of cooperation with the police, suggesting that respondents' behav-\niors were shaped by their perceptions of both legitimacy and effectiveness. The separate\ncombination of effectiveness and legitimacy suggests that these may be distinct factors in\nthe ways that police stops affect law-related behaviors.\nIV. Conclusion\nDiscussions of street stops typically focus on two issues: the legality of police actions and the\neffectiveness of street stops in shaping the rate of violent or other crime. The purpose of this\nstudy is to raise and examine a third potentially important criterion for evaluating police\ninteractions with young men on the street. Those interactions can potentially shape the\nviews of these young men about the legitimacy of the police and, through those evaluations,\ninfluence a variety of behaviors important to the legal system.\nBy focusing on legality and performance, legal authorities define the law in a top-\ndown hierarchical framework in which elite decisions define policies and practices and the\ngoal is to secure public compliance via the threat of punishment and/or the promise of\nperformance in service delivery of safety. This command and control model contrasts\nstarkly with the concerns of earlier eras in which legal culture, and in particular the popular\nlegitimacy of the police and courts, was central to discussions about the law and the policies\nand practices of the police and courts (Sarat 1977). Questions of legality engage lawyers and\n7Results available from authors.\neffectiveness police professionals, leaving the public out of discussions about how\nlaw is practiced in their own communities. This analysis points to the costs of such an\napproach.\nThe results of this study suggest that legitimacy matters, and that legitimacy deficits\nare real in their consequences for public safety. They show that higher legitimacy is related\nto lower levels of criminal behavior and also demonstrate that cooperation with the police\nis greater when legitimacy is high. Hence, models of policing that are insensitive to issues\nof popular legitimacy are unsuccessful in their own terms (i.e., in terms of crime reduc-\ntion). They are further unsuccessful in terms of the emerging goals of motivating public\ncooperation with the police and engagement in communities (Tyler & Jackson 2014).\nThese findings suggest that while studies indicate that risk perceptions, performance\nevaluations, and legitimacy all motivate compliance, the goals of cooperation and engage-\nment are more strongly linked to legitimacy.\nGiven the importance of perceptions of legitimacy in predicting law-related behavior,\nthe factors predicting legitimacy are also important. This study suggests that several factors\nwere relevant, including, notably, the behavior of the police. In the case of personal\nexperience, police intrusions in the form of use of force/arrest had negative consequences\nfor feelings, acceptance of police authority, and legitimacy. The degree of intrusion was\nlinked to reactions, with more intrusion undermining legitimacy to a greater degree.\nA second factor was performance. It is clear that police performance was important.\nFor example, perceptions of general police competence in fighting crime shaped perceived\nlegitimacy, as did judgments of the appropriateness of police conduct. In the case of personal\nexperience, people were more accepting of street stops when they saw an appropriate legal\nreason for their stop. With general judgments about police behavior in the neighborhood,\npeople cared whether the police generally used appropriate legal criterion when making\nstop decisions. In both cases, therefore, people cared about the appropriateness of police\nconduct.\nPeople also put heavy weight on the fairness of police behavior, including the fairness\nof the outcome of encounters with the police and the fairness of the way the police exercise\ntheir authority. The justice of police actions (i.e., perceived procedural justice) was espe-\ncially important. It was typically the most important observed element that respondents\nreacted to when they had a personal experience with the police. In particular, people\nfocused on the quality of their interpersonal treatment. Justice judgments were central to\nreactions both to personal experiences and to general judgments about the behavior of the\npolice. This suggests that it was not street stops per se, or even the intrusions that they make\ninto people's lives, but whether people evaluate police actions as involving fair interper-\nsonal treatment and appropriate justification.\nA separate issue is whether fairness mattered to respondents after they had a stop\nhistory. The results suggest that being treated fairly remained central to the impact of\npolice actions on views about police legitimacy. The nature of procedural justice in police\nstops mattered greatly, no matter how many prior stops a person had had. People became\nupset and formed more negative views if they felt that the police were treating them without\n\"dignity and respect,\" not \"respecting their rights,\" and not \"trying to do what was right.\"\nThis is true irrespective of the number of prior stops. To illustrate this we can look at the\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 775\ncorrelation between legitimacy and whether a person was treated fairly among those people\nwho have been stopped over 10 times. That correlation is r = 0.42, p < 0.001. In contrast, the\nsame correlation for people being stopped the first time is r = 0.40, p < 0.001. In other\nwords, whether the police are seen as acting fairly shapes the reactions to a pivotal experi-\nence both for those with little and for those with substantial prior experience with the\npolice. However, we also showed that assessments of procedural justice during stops decline\nwith increasing exposure and experience. Accordingly, procedural justice matters greatly,\nbut is fragile and declines with high stop exposure. To the extent that legitimacy is an\nimportant outcome of police contact, legitimacy is quite sensitive to the manner in which\nthese contacts unfold and the overall exposure of citizens to involuntary police stops and\nstreet detentions.\nPut another way, the findings indicate that the more experiences respondents had\nwith the police, the less likely they were to indicate that the police treated them fairly and\nthat police actions were lawful. Although it is possible that people with more negative views\nabout the police have more negative opinions about their treatment, controls were\nincluded for criminal justice history and demographic features. Hence, these findings\nsuggest that people who have more contact with the police evaluate their later contacts as\nless fair and lawful, in turn leading to a corrosive influence of contact on the psychological\njudgments underlying legitimacy.\nThese findings bear directly on the question of whether the police can stop people as\noften as they want as long as those people feel that they are being treated fairly and\nrespectfully (Epp 2013). In this study, being repeatedly stopped by the police on the street\nor in a car led people to experience their direct encounters with the police as both less fair\nand less lawful. There are several possible explanations for this result. The first is that\npeople who experience multiple stops increasingly question the reasonableness of police\nactions. The other is that respondents' actions change and they act differently when dealing\nwith the police on later occasions, provoking different behavior from the police.\nAnd, the findings suggest that these results are hardly abstract: there are conse-\nquences of the effects of legitimacy for full participation of young persons in the\nco-production of security for all residents of their neighborhoods and of the city. Those\nwho view the police as less legitimate are more likely to engage in criminal conduct and less\nwilling to cooperate with the police and the courts.\nThe study's limitations suggest caution in interpreting the results. In particular, this\nwas a cross-sectional analysis and all the questions were answered at one point in time based\non retrospective reports of police contacts and interactions. Therefore, we fall short of the\nnecessary conditions to identify causal effects (Sampson et al. 2013). This is particularly\nimportant in the case of recent criminal activity, where the hypothesized relationship would\nrequire legitimacy to influence, rather than being influenced by, criminal activity. To\nattempt to control for this reverse influence the analysis included respondents' broader\ncriminal justice history as a factor in the equation. Despite the effort to introduce such\nrelevant controls, the correlational nature of the relationships shown should be recognized\nand appropriate cautions should be made in understanding the findings. The study's\nstrengths are important to note as well: its focus on the neighborhoods and persons most\nlikely to experience involuntary police contact in a proactive policing regime.\nReferences\nAlpert, G.

The positive items were: \"Overall, the\npolice are honest\"; \"People's basic rights are well protected by the police\"; \"The police usually\nmake decisions that are good for everyone in the community\"; \"The police treat everyone\nequally regardless of their race\"; \"I am proud of the work the police do in my neighborhood\";\n\"I feel that people should support the police\"; \"People should accept the decisions made by\nthe police\"; \"If the police tell you to do something, you should do it\"; \"It is your duty to accept\nthe decisions made by the police even when you disagree with them\"; \"It is your duty to do\nwhat the police tell you to do, even if you do not understand or agree with their reasons\"; \"It is\nyour duty to do what the police tell you to do, even if you do not like the way they treat you\"; \"The\npolice usually act in ways that are consistent with your sense of right and wrong\"; and \"You\ngenerally agree with the values the police defend.\" The negative items were: \"Laws are meant\nto be broken\"; \"It is ok to do anything you want\"; \"There are no right or wrong ways to make\nmoney\"; \"It is alright to break a law if you think the law is wrong\"; \"Sometimes you have to bend\nthe law to get things to come out right\"; \"There are times when it is ok to ignore what the police\ntell you to do\"; \"The law represents the values of the people in power, rather than the values of\npeople like me\"; \"People in power use the law to try to control people like me\"; \"The law does\nnot protect my interests\"; \"It is alright to get around the law as long as you don't actually break\nit\"; \"It is hard to blame someone for breaking the law if they can get away with it\"; and \"People\ndo not need to obey a law if they had nothing to do with making that law.\"\nRecent Criminal Activity\nRespondents were asked to indicate: \"Over the last 12 months how often have you\" (frequently,\nsometimes, seldom, almost never or never) been: \"injured someone in a fight\" (85 percent said\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 781\nnever); \"taken money or goods from someone by force or threat of force\" (96 percent said\nnever); \"carried a weapon such as a gun or knife\" (91 percent said never); \"stolen something\nworth over $50\" (98 percent said never); and \"sold marijuana or other drugs\" (96 percent said\nnever). Because the scale was skewed toward noncriminal activity, it was transformed in two\nways. First, an overall scale was constructed with three levels: no criminal behavior (77 percent;\nalternate scale was created using the log of the criminal behavior scale.\nCooperation\nHelp the Police\nRespondents were asked three questions, with responses scaled \"very likely\" (1) to \"very\nunlikely\" (4). The questions were: \"If you knew of someone from your neighborhood who\nhad broken a law and was wanted how likely would you be to report them to the police\" (27\npercent said very likely); \"If you witnessed a crime or knew about a crime that took place\nhow likely would you be to report it to the police\" (46 percent said very likely); and \"If\nyou witnessed a crime or knew about a crime that took place how likely would you be to\nprovide information or help the police in an investigation of the crime\" (43 percent said\nvery likely). These three items were combined into a single scale using the mean scale scores\nHelp the Legal System\nRespondents were asked: \"If called, how willing would you be to serve on a jury\" (26 percent\nsaid very willing; 43 percent said somewhat willing; 17 percent said somewhat unwilling; and\n13 percent said very unwilling). These three items also were combined into a single scale\nusing the mean scale scores (Alpha = 0.79).\nGeneralized Neighborhood Experience with Police\nFrequency of Stops\n\"Stop people in the street and ask them questions or search them?\" and \"Stop people in cars\nto ask them questions or search them?\"\nDegree of Intrusion\nThe intrusiveness of police stops was assessed along several dimensions. The questions\nasked about general police behavior rather than personal experience with police, which was\nasked separately. For the generalized assessment, subjects were asked how often the police\nin their neighborhood: \"Physically search people\"; \"Use harsh or insulting language\";\n\"Threaten to use physical force\"; \"Take out a weapon, such as a gun, a club or a taser\";\n\"Treat people disrespectfully\"; and \"Bully or intimidate people.\" A factor analysis indicated\nthat these judgments all loaded into a single factor so they were averaged into a single score.\nExperiential and Performance-Based Evaluations of the Police\nPolice Performance\nRespondents were asked four questions, two about crime control and two about service\ndelivery. The items used a \"very successful\" (1) to \"not successful at all\" (4) format. The\nitems were: How successful are the police at \"preventing crime in your neighborhood\";\n\"catching the people who commit crimes\"; \"solving people's problems when they call the\npolice for help\"; and \"responding in a timely way to calls for help\" (Alpha = 0.75).\nPolice Use Legal Reasons for Deciding Whether to Stop People\nTwo items were used, each with a response scale ranging from \"frequently\" (1) to \"never\"\n(5). The items were: \"How often do the police\" \"stop people without a good reason\" and\n\"stop people based on their race\" (Alpha = 0.68).\nPolice Procedural Justice During Policy Implementation\nFour items were used, with a response scale ranging from \"frequently\" (1) to \"never\" (5).\nThe items were: \"How often do the police\" \"use fair procedures when making decisions\nabout what to do\"; \"make decisions that are consistent with the law\"; \"treat people fairly\";\nand \"treat people with courtesy and respect\" (Alpha = 0.70).\nPolice Procedural Justice During Policy Creation\nRespondents were asked: \"How much do police consider your views and the views of people\nlike yourself when deciding how the police should handle crime in your neighborhood\" (16\npercent said a great deal; 42 percent said somewhat; 21 percent said a little; and 20 percent\nsaid not much at all).\nPersonal Experience During the Stop\nAffect\nRespondents were asked about their feelings at the time of the experience using four items\n(\"strongly agree\" (1) to \"strongly disagree\" (4)). They were asked: \"Did you feel\": satisfied;\nsafe; scared (reverse scored); and/or angry (reverse scored) (Alpha = 0.73).\nDecision Acceptance\nRespondents were asked: \"How willing they were to accept the decision made by the police\"\n(\"very willing\" (33 percent); somewhat willing (43 percent); somewhat unwilling (12\npercent); and \"very unwilling\" (13 percent)) and \"How much they considered going to\nothers to complain\" (a great deal (19 percent); somewhat (12 percent); a little (15\npercent); and \"not much at all\" (54 percent)). The second item was reversed and a scale\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 783\nLegal Reason for Your Stop\nRespondents were asked to strongly agree (23 percent); somewhat agree (35 percent);\nsomewhat disagree (11 percent); or strongly disagree (31 percent) that \"[t]he police had a\nlegitimate reason to stop you.\"\nOutcome Fairness\nRespondents were asked two questions and responded on a scale ranging from \"strongly\nagree\" (1) to \"strongly disagree\" (4). The questions were: \"You received a fair outcome\" and\n\"You received the outcome you deserved according to the law\" (Alpha = 0.83).\nQuality of Decision Making\nRespondents were asked five questions and responded on a scale ranging from \"strongly\nagree\" (1) to \"strongly disagree\" (4). The questions were: \"The police used fair procedures\nwhen making decisions about what to do\"; \"The police let you tell your side of the story\";\n\"The police explained why they stopped you in a way that was clear to you\"; \"The police got\nthe facts they needed to make good decisions\"; and \"The police made their decisions in a\nneutral and unbiased way\" (Alpha = 0.85).\nQuality of Treatment\nRespondents were asked five questions and responded on a scale ranging from \"strongly\nagree\" (1) to \"strongly disagree\" (4). The questions were: \"The police treated you fairly\";\n\"The police gave consideration to your views when deciding what to do\"; \"The police tried\nto do what was fair\"; \"The police treated you with dignity and courtesy\"; and \"The police\nrespected your rights\" (Alpha = 0.88).\nDegree of Police Intrusion\nQuestions about police behavior were: Did the police: \"ask your name\" and/or \"ask for\nsome form of identification\"; search/use force \"frisk or pat you down\"; \"search your bags\";\n\"threaten to use physical force\"; \"actually use physical force\"; \"handcuff you\"; \"take out a\nweapon, such as a gun, a club or a taser\"; and/or \"threaten to use a weapon\"; and (3) arrest\n\"take you to the police station\"; and/or \"arrest you.\"\nAppendix 2: Selection Models for Past Year Stops and\nLifetime Stops\nTable B1: Logistic Regression for Lifetime and Past Year Stops (N = 1,261) (b, SE, p)\nLifetime Past Year\nb SE p b SE p\nStreet Stops and Police Legitimacy 785"
