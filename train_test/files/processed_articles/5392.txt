The ACE polymorphism was assayed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the genotype distribution\nand allele frequency were analyzed. The DKD+ group was subdivided into the DD, ID and II subgroups, based on their\ngenotypes. In addition, patients with DKD received valsartan treatment for 12 weeks. We determined changes in the\nurinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) and serum creatinine (SCr).\nResults: The frequencies of the genotypes DD and ID were higher in the DKD+ than in the DKD\u00ad group. The\nfrequency of allele D was higher, and of allele I was lower, in the DKD+ than in DKD\u00ad group (p < 0.05). Following\nvalsartan treatment, albuminuria was significantly decreased in subgroups DD and ID (p < 0.05).\nConclusions: In T2DM patients, the ACE I/D polymorphism was associated with onset of DKD. Furthermore, the ACE\nI/D polymorphism influenced the renoprotective response to valsartan: Patients with the DD genotype benefitted the\nmost from this treatment.\n",

Ang II shows increased activity under\nhigh glucose conditions. This causes hypertrophy of vari-\nous renal cells and has a pressor effect on arteriolar smooth\nmuscles, thereby resulting in increased vascular pressure.\nIt also induces inflammation, apoptosis, cell growth,\nmigration and differentiation.2\nNot all patients with poor glycemic control eventually\ndevelop DKD; on the contrary, some DM patients with\nwell-controlled blood glucose can still develop this dis-\nThe association of ACE gene\npolymorphism with diabetic\nkidney disease and renoprotective\nefficacy of valsartan\nYuying Wang, Wen Peng, Xiaoxue Zhang, Huibo Qiao,\nLi Wang, Zhigang Xu and Chenguang Wu\n Keywords\nAngiotensin converting enzyme, diabetes, diabetes mellitus Type 2, diabetic kidney disease, end stage renal disease,\ngene polymorphisms, kidney disease, microangiopathy, microvascular complications, valsartan\nDepartment of Endocrinology, Affiliated People's Hospital, Jiangsu\nUniversity, Zhenjiang, China\nCorresponding author:\nChenguang Wu, Department of Endocrinology, Affiliated People's\nOriginal Article\n2 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System\nease. Studies show that there is a strong genetic predispo-\nsition to the onset and progression of DKD.3,4\nThe ACE gene is composed of 26 exons and 25 introns,\nwith a length of 21 kb. There are > 160 ACE gene poly-\nmorphisms that are currently known; most of them are sin-\ngle nucleotide polymorphisms. Rigat et al.5 first reported\nthat the ACE gene insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism\nis caused by the insertion or deletion of a 287 bpAlu repeat\nsequence within intron 16, which results in three geno-\ntypes. While the presence of the DD genotype was found\nto be associated with the highest level of ACE, the enzyme\nlevels were reported to be the lowest in the II genotype.\nRecently, many researchers have demonstrated that the\nACE I/D polymorphism is related to diabetic microangi-\nopathy, and that the D allele might be a susceptibility fac-\ntor for patients with DKD.6\u00ad8 The frequency of ACE alleles\nvaries within different ethnic groups, which might contrib-\nute to the conflicting views on the role of the ACE gene I/D\npolymorphism in the development of DKD.9,10\nWith advancements in the field of pharmacogenom-\nics, the ACE I/D polymorphism was shown to contribute\nto the therapeutic effect of the Ang II receptor antago-\nnists (ARBs). Ruggenenti et al.11 report that the DD gen-\notype is associated with a better response to ARB therapy\nin overt nephropathy of Type 2 diabetes, as compared to\nthe II genotype. A study by Felehgari et al.10 reveals that\nthe maximum impact of losartan therapy on ACE activ-\nity is observed in macroalbuminuric patients with the\nDD genotype, rather than in normoalbuminuric patients.\nFurthermore, Andersen et al.12 show that long-term treat-\nment with losartan has similar beneficial renoprotective\neffects on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in\nhypertensive Type 1 diabetic patients with the ACE II\nand DD genotypes.\nThe present study aimed to investigate the associations\nbetween the ACE gene I/D polymorphisms and the suscep-\ntibility of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)\nto DKD; and to examine the correlation between this gene\npolymorphism and the efficacy of valsartan in reducing\nurine protein.\nSubjects and methods\nIn the present study, we enrolled 128 patients diagnosed\nthe Department of Endocrinology, People's Affiliated\nHospital of Jiangsu University, China. There were 54\npatients, including 35 of male and 19 of female gender\ndetailed history was taken, and physical as well as labora-\ntory examinations were performed on the subjects.\nInformed written consent was obtained from each individ-\nual before participation. The study was approved by the\nEthics Committee of People's Hospital of Jiangsu\nUniversity. T2DM was diagnosed according to the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) criteria, while DKD was\ndefined as an albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) > 30\nthis study fulfilled the inclusion criteria of being > 18\nyears of age, and of not having undergone ARB nor ACE\ninhibitor therapy within 4 weeks.\nPatients were excluded if they had a history of malig-\nnant hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal artery\nstenosis, a creatinine clearance rate of < 30 mL/min, ear-\nlier established persistent erythrocyturia and/or urinary\ninfection, or tumor; and if those of female gender were\npregnant or lactating.\nThe polymorphisms of the ACE gene were assayed by\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the genotype distri-\nbution and allele frequency were analyzed. The patients\nwith DKD were further divided into three subgroups based\non their genotypes: DD, ID and II. According to conven-\ntional diabetes therapy, they received valsartan (80 mg)\nonce a day for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment,\nmeasurements of ACR, serum creatinine (SCr), systolic\nblood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)\nwere repeated.\nThe data were presented as mean \u00b1 SD. One-way analy-\nsis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the between-\ngroup and within-group differences. The paired Student's\nt-test was employed to assess the differences between the\nbaseline values and the values after treatment with valsar-\ntan. Count data were presented as medians (interquartile\nrange (IQR)) and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for\nbetween-group comparisons. The genotypes and the ACE\nallele frequencies in DKD+ patients were compared to the\ncontrols using the chi-square test. Odds ratios (OR) were\ncalculated as estimates of relative risk for disease and the\n95% CIs were obtained. Statistical significance was\nassumed at p < 0.05. The statistical software package SPSS\nversion 17.0 was used for all the statistical analyses.\nResults\nAs shown in Table 1, patients with DKD+ had significantly\nhigher ACR, SBP, DBP, and low-density lipoprotein C\n(LDL-C) levels than did patients with DKD\u00ad ; however,\ntheir high-density lipoprotein C (HDL-C) levels were sig-\nnificantly higher in DKD\u00ad patients (p < 0.05).\nTable 2 presents the ACE genotypes and the allele dis-\ntribution in DKD+ and DKD\u00ad patients. In DKD+ subjects,\nthe frequency of DD, ID and II genotypes were 37.1%,\njects, 20.3% showed the DD genotype, the ID genotype\nwas present in 44.6% of the patients, while the II genotype\nexisted in 35.1% of the patients.

Conversely,\nAl-Harbi et al.20 find that there is a strong association of\nthe ACE polymorphism with T2DM patients, although it\nwas not confirmed as a risk factor for the development of\nDKD in the Bahraini population. In our study, the fre-\nquency of the D allele in diabetic patients with DKD was\nsignificantly higher (61.1%) than in the diabetic patients\nthe D allele was associated with a 2.12-fold increased risk\nof DKD (p < 0.05). Our results were consistent with\nthe findings in the aforementioned Asian population.18\nTherefore, our data indicated that the ACE gene I/D poly-\nmorphism might be associated with the development of\nDKD, and the D allele is likely to be linked to susceptibil-\nity to DKD.\nAng II receptor blockers improve markers of kidney\ndisease, and slow the disease progression in diabetic, as\nwell as non-diabetic patients, by having blood pressure-\nlowering effects and partially by their direct blockade of\nLosartan has been shown to have the most beneficial\neffect on patients with the DD and ID genotypes.22 This\ncould be attributed to decreased plasma ACE activity and/\nor decreased urinary albumin excretion in these patients.23\nSimilarly, the losartan therapy had greater influence on the\nACE activity in macroalbuminuric patients with the DD\ngenotype than in normo-albuminuric patients10; however,\nno significant association was observed between the ACE\nI/D polymorphism and the reduction of albuminuria in\nlosartan-treated hypertensive Type 1 diabetic patients.12\nIn our study, valsartan therapy significantly reduced\nproteinuria in patients with the DD and ID genotypes;\nhowever, the anti-proteinuric response in DD genotype\npatients was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in sub-\njects with the ID genotype. This could again be related to\nthe increased activity of plasma ACE and/or increased\nexcretion of urinary albumin.\nOrtlepp et al.24 have demonstrated that individuals\nwith the D allele in a homozygous condition experience\nthe most noticeable decrease in blood pressure, during\ntreatment with candesartan. Nevertheless, the association\nof the ACE polymorphism with antihypertensive effect of\nAT1R antagonists has not been clearly observed in many\nstudies. For instance, Nordestgaar et al.25 and Nakayama\net al.26 report that there is no correlation between the ACE\nI/D polymorphism and an individual's response to losar-\ntan therapy.\nIn the current study, the SBP and DBP reduced signifi-\ncantly in the genotypes DD and ID (p < 0.05); conversely,\ntreatment with valsartan produced a decreased BP response\nif the diabetic patients had the ACE I allele homozygous.\nAlthough the reasons for these discrepancies are not well\nunderstood, various factors (racial, environmental and\nregional) may influence the final outcome of this study and\nshould be taken into consideration. Moreover, other con-\nfounding factors, such as changes in antihypertensive treat-\nment, blood pressure and glycemic control can contribute\nto the progression of nephropathy. Interestingly, several\ngene polymorphisms on a single drug; however, combined\nmedication is common in clinical practice. Therefore, the\nrelationship between gene polymorphism and drug interac-\ntions needs to be elucidated. The pharmacogenomic strat-\negies pertaining to DKD are of great significance for\nascertaining the treatment options. The results of the pre-\nsent study require further confirmation by including large\nsample sizes and multicenter clinical trials.\nConclusions\nIn summary, the presence of the D allele significantly\nincreased the risk of DKD by 2.12-fold, and the ACE I/D\npolymorphism was suggested to be strongly associated\nwith the development of DKD. In addition, our study\nrevealed that there was a better response to the treatment\nwith valsartan in DKD patients with the DD genotype.\nThis could further provide a basis for individualized ther-\napy for DKD.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article:\nThis research is funded by Social Development Project from the\nScience&Technology Bureau of Zhenjiang,Jiangsu province,\nEthical approval\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of People's\nHospital of Jiangsu University, China.\nInformed consent\nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patients for\ntheir anonymized information to be published in this article.\nGuarantor\nCW\nContributorship\nYW and WP contributed equally to this work.
