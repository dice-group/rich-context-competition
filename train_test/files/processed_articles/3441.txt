Men,\nrelative to women, tend to react with more distress to partner sexual infidelity than to\nemotional infidelity. Evolutionary theorists interpret this difference as evidence of sexually\ndimorphic selection pressures. In contrast, focusing only on the simple effects within each\nsex, social-cognitive theorists suggest that men and women do not differ in their reactions\nto partner infidelity. As evidenced by recent rival meta-analytic reports, these diverging\nperspectives remain largely unresolved and contentious. The present study was designed to\ntake a new approach by measuring attitudes toward partner infidelity. Results were\nconsistent with the evolutionary perspective: Men, to a significantly larger degree than\nwomen, evaluated partner sexual infidelity more negatively than emotional infidelity.\n",

Evolutionary theory posits that\ndue to sexually dimorphic selection pressures, men and women have evolved different\nsensitivities to emotional versus sexual infidelity. Indeed, 60% of men but only 17% of\nwomen selected sexual infidelity as most distressing. Although the specific percentages\nhave varied somewhat across subsequent studies, this pattern of results has been replicated\nDespite these consistent results, the evolutionary account of sex differences in\njealousy has been questioned. For example, Desteno and Salovey (1996) offered the\n\"double shot hypothesis\" as an alternative explanation. When forced to choose only one\nSex differences in attitudes toward infidelity\noption that is most distressing, they argue that people reasonably select the type of\ninfidelity that they believe most likely implies the co-occurrence of both types of infidelity.\nIf men tend to believe that women will only engage in sex after falling in love (Harris and\nChristenfield, 1996), men will perceive sexual infidelity as most distressing. Thus, the\nreasoning goes, if a woman has formed a sexual relationship with another man she likely\nalso has strong emotional feelings toward the man. On the other hand, if women believe\nthat men eagerly have sex prior to, and often without ever, falling in love, women will\nlikely select emotional infidelity as worse. Stated differently, when a man is emotionally\nattached to a woman it implies a much more serious relationship \u00ad one that has moved\nbeyond sexual activity. However, the \"double shot\" hypothesis has not been supported\nwhen carefully pitted against evolutionary predictions (Buss et al., 1999).\nFollowing the lack of support for the double-shot hypothesis, DeSteno and\ncolleagues (DeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and Salovey, 2002; DeSteno, Bartlett, and\nSalovey, 2006; DeSteno, 2010) more recently argued that sex differences on forced-choice\nmeasures are the result of a format-induced measurement artifact. Specifically, DeSteno\nand colleagues posit that the forced-choice scenario leads participants to engage in an\neffortful and gender socialized decision strategy concerning the likely outcomes and trade-\noffs of each form of infidelity. Unfortunately, the specific considerations and trade-offs are\nnot specifically detailed. In fact, and despite the results of Buss et al. (1999), the only\nexplicit reference of a possible gender socialized decision strategy remains the\naforementioned \"double shot hypothesis\" (DeSteno et al., 2002).\nTo support the measurement artifact hypothesis, DeSteno and colleagues argue that\nsex differences disappear under cognitions of cognitive load and when participants\nseparately rate their levels of distress to sexual and emotional infidelity on continuous\nscales. In response, evolutionary theorists have demonstrated sex differences under both\ndeliberative and automatic (cognitive load) conditions (Barrett, Frederick, Haselton, and\ncontinuous scales can be accounted for because of ceiling (Buss et al., 1999; Edlund,\nHeider, Scherer, Farc, and Sagarin, 2006) and scale labeling effects (Edlund and Sagarin,\nMeta-analytic results\nrecently published meta-analyses were independently conducted (Carpenter, 2012; Sagarin\net al., 2012). Importantly, both focused on the results of studies employing continuous\nscales. However, because of disagreements regarding the critical statistical analyses needed\nto test evolutionary predictions, these meta-analyses reached opposite conclusions.\nIn line with social-cognitive theorists (e.g., DeSteno and Salovey, 1996; Harris,\nthe view that the evolutionary perspective implies two critical, and separate, predictions: 1)\nMen will report significantly more distress to sexual infidelity than they do to emotional\ninfidelity, and 2) Women will report significantly more distress to emotional infidelity than\nthey do to sexual infidelity. With this focus on simple effects within participant sex, the\nCarpenter meta-analysis found that both men and women tend to rate sexual infidelity as\nSex differences in attitudes toward infidelity\nmore distressing than emotional infidelity, leading Carpenter to conclude that his results\nwere consistent with the social-cognitive hypothesis of no sex differences in infidelity\ndistress. Not emphasized by Carpenter is the fact that the sexual minus emotional\ndifference was larger for men than it was for women. As described below, this pattern of\nresults is actually consistent with evolutionary predictions.\nTaking a markedly different approach, Sagarin et al. (2012) conducted their meta-\nanalysis to examine the Participant Sex \u00d7 Infidelity Type interaction. This approach is\nbased on the "
