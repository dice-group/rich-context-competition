On the Rey Auditory Ver-\nbal Learning Test, long-term users recalled significantly fewer words than either shorter-\nterm users (P=.001) or controls (P=.005); there was no difference between shorter-\nterm users and controls. Long-term users showed impaired learning (P=.007), retention\n(P=.003), and retrieval (P=.002) compared with controls. Both user groups per-\nformed poorly on a time estimation task (P.001 vs controls). Performance measures\noften correlated significantly with the duration of cannabis use, being worse with in-\ncreasing years of use, but were unrelated to withdrawal symptoms and persisted after\ncontrolling for recent cannabis use and other drug use.\nConclusions These results confirm that long-term heavy cannabis users show im-\npairments in memory and attention that endure beyond the period of intoxication and\nworsen with increasing years of regular cannabis use.\nbeen fully elucidated. The attribution of\ndeficits to lingering acute effects, drug\nresidues, abstinence effects, or lasting\nchanges caused by chronic use contin-\nuestobedebated.5,6 Animalresearchsug-\ngests an important role for the cannabi-\nnoid receptor in regulating the neural\nactivity critical for memory process-\nresult in altered functioning of the can-\nnabinoidreceptoranditsassociatedneu-\nromodulator systems.\nThis study investigated the nature of\ncognitive impairments associated with\nlong-term cannabis use employing data\ncollected from a large clinical trial of\nchronic users seeking treatment for can-\nnabis dependence. The study com-\npared 102 cannabis users assessed prior\nto treatment on carefully selected neu-\nropsychological tests with 33 nonuser\ncontrols. The parameters of cannabis\nuse that contribute to impairment were\nexamined. It was hypothesized that per-\nformance would deteriorate as the num-\nber of years of regular use increased.\nMETHODS\nDesign\nA multisite, retrospective, cross-\nsectional comparison-group design was\nused to compare (1) long-term users\nwith a mean of 23.9 years of regular can-\nnabis use; (2) shorter-term users with\na mean of 10.2 years of regular use; and\n(3) nonusers of cannabis. Key con-\nfounding variables (age, IQ, other drug\nuse) were controlled through match-\ning or statistical methods. The sample\nsize required for this study was deter-\nmined by estimating a 94% chance of\ndetecting a moderate effect size of 0.5\nSD units at a 2-tailed  of .05.\nRecruitment Procedure\nand Assessment of Drug Use\nSixty-five of the 102 cannabis users were\ndelayed-treatment participants from the\nMarijuana Treatment Project, a mul-\ntisite US study (Seattle, Wash; Farming-\nton, Conn; and Miami, Fla) conducted\nness of brief treatments for cannabis de-\npendence.25 The remainder were re-\ncruited through the Marijuana\nTreatment Project specifically for this\nstudy. Participants provided written in-\nformed consent as approved by the eth-\nics committees of the participating in-\nstitutions and were paid $75 for\ncompleting the cognitive assessments.\nControls(n=33)wererecruitedfromthe\ngeneral population through media ad-\nvertisements at only 1 site. The con-\ntrols were told that the researchers were\nstudying the effects of exposure to drugs\nand alcohol on cognitive functioning,\nand that at present only individuals at\nthe lighter end of the spectrum of drug\nexperience were required. The aim was\nto minimize cannabis use among con-\ntrols while approximating the other\ncharacteristics of the cannabis-using\nsample. Assessors were not blinded with\nregard to group assignment. Self-\nreported drug and alcohol use were as-\nsessed by the Addiction Severity In-\ndex,26 a separate structured interview,\nand the Time Line Follow Back proce-\ndure.27,28 The Structured Clinical Inter-\nviewforDiagnosticandStatisticalManual\nof Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-\nIV) Axis I Disorders (SCID)29 assessed\ncannabis dependence. Duration of regu-\nlar (at least twice per month) cannabis\nuse was an averaged composite mea-\nsure derived from the Addiction Sever-\nity Index, SCID, and the structured in-\nterview. Current frequency of cannabis\nuse was calculated from the Time Line\nFollow Back procedure.\nInclusion/Exclusion Criteria\nCannabis users were included if they\nhad used cannabis regularly for at least\n3 years, were currently using at least\nonce a week, were seeking treatment to\nassist them to cease or reduce their use\nof cannabis, and were willing to par-\nticipate in the treatment program of-\nfered. Participants were excluded if they\nhad ever had a serious illness or injury\nthat may have affected the brain, any\npsychotic disorder, met a current\nDSM-IVdiagnosisofdependenceonany\nother drug or alcohol, or had a poor\ncommand of the English language.\nSample Characteristics\nTABLE 1 provides demographic infor-\nmation and cannabis use parameters.\nTable 1.

Twenty-two controls\nhad either never tried cannabis or used\nit 10 or fewer times in their lives and 11\nhad used cannabis weekly to monthly\nwhile at school or college between 4 and\n30 years ago. Controls with a history of\ncannabis use were excluded from \"pure\nsample\" analyses.\nParticipants were required to ab-\nstain from cannabis for at least 12 hours\nprior to testing and to provide 2 urine\nsamples (1 the night before testing, an-\nother during the test session).

Tobacco and\nalcohol use was minimal. Alcohol was\ndays per month among users and con-\ntrols, respectively. Almost one third of\nusers and 46.8% of controls drank less\nthan once a month or not at all. Forty-\neight percent of the cannabis users had\nonly tried drugs other than cannabis a\nfew times or never; 52% had used other\ndrugs socially/recreationally primar-\nily during high school and college. Past\nhistories of regular drug use included\nhallucinogens (n=17), and sedatives/\nhypnotics or minor tranquilizers (n=7).\nCurrent use of other drugs was less than\nonce a month or not at all for 93.1% of\nthe sample. More than half of the con-\ntrols (51.5%) had never tried any other\ndrug and the remainder had only tried\nother drugs experimentally. \"Pure\nsample\" analyses excluded all partici-\npants with histories of regular or heavy\nuse of alcohol or other drugs.\nNeuropsychological Tests\nand Procedures\nNine neuropsychological tests were\nadministered in the order listed in\nminuterestbreakwasgivenaftertheRey\nAuditoryVerbalLearningTest(RAVLT)\nRecognition test. Tests were adminis-\ntered by trained assistants and took ap-\nproximately 2 hours to complete. Qual-\nity assurance procedures were adopted\nto ensure that procedures were stan-\ndardized at each site with ongoing su-\npervision and review of audiotaped\nassessmentsbycentralizedstaffthrough-\nout the course of the study.\nData Analysis\nEach cognitive test was analysed us-\ning SPSS version 10.0 (SPSS Institute,\nChicago, Ill) with analysis of covari-\nance (ANCOVA) for normally distrib-\nuted variables or nonparametric tests\nof group differences for skewed data.\nThe FSIQ and age were included as co-\nvariates in analyses where they corre-\nlated with test performance. All par-\nticipants were initially included in\nanalysis, with the overall cannabis user\nsample first compared with the con-\ntrol group (evaluated at P.05), fol-\nlowed by comparisons on the basis of\nduration of cannabis use (long- vs\nshorter-term users vs controls, evalu-\nated at P.01). For 2-way interac-\ntions, the Greenhouse-Geisser method\nwas used to adjust the df where appro-\npriate and for multiple comparisons, a\nBonferroni adjustment controlled for\ntype I error. Analysis of covariance was\nrepeated on a purer sample that strictly\nexcluded those participants with ei-\nther a history of other drug use or pos-\nsible recent use of cannabis prior to test-\ning. Semipartial correlations examined\nthe unique contributions of FSIQ, age,\nduration of cannabis use, and recency\nof cannabis use to the variance in cog-\nnitive test performance.\nRESULTS\nResults from the 9 neuropsychologi-\ncal tests are shown in TABLE 3 for can-\nnabis users overall, for groups based on\nduration of cannabis use, and for con-\ntrols.

These re-\nsults support the hypothesis that im-\npaired performance is not a conse-\nquence of recent use prior to testing or\nthe extent of cannabinoid residues pre-\nsent.\nTo explore further the influences of\nduration of cannabis use and recency\nof use, semipartial correlations were cal-\nculated using the following predic-\ntors: FSIQ, age, duration of cannabis\nuse, and hours since last use of canna-\nbis. As shown in TABLE 4, the unique\ncontribution of duration of cannabis use\nto the variance of each test variable was\nsuperior or at least equivalent to that\nof recency of use in all 6 test variables\nthat had significant contributions from\nat least 1 cannabis use parameter. Re-\ncent use contributed only to perfor-\nmance on the memory tests. The fact\nthat a minority of the sample, primar-\nily shorter-term users, reported expe-\nriencing mild withdrawal symptoms,\nyet shorter-term users' performance was\nnot impaired, supports the interpreta-\ntion of the cognitive impairments ob-\nserved as a long-term consequence of\ncannabis use and not a manifestation\nof overtly experienced withdrawal.\nCOMMENT\nThe results of this study have con-\nfirmed and extended previous find-\nings of cognitive impairments among\nchronic heavy cannabis users. Long-\nterm users with a mean 24 years of regu-\nlar cannabis use performed signifi-\ncantly less well on tests of memory and\nattention than nonuser controls and\nshorter-term users with a mean of 10\nyears' use. The greatest impairment on\nalmost every measure was from the\nRAVLT, indicating a generalized\nmemory deficit with impaired learn-\ning, retention, and retrieval. Long-\ntermusersrecalled2.5fewerwordsthan\ncontrols on the delayed recall trial\nwhere 49% of the long-term users'\nwere more than 2 SDs, below the con-\ntrol mean and normative data.47 A large\nproportion of long-term users' recog-\nnition scores were more than 1 SD\ntrol mean and norms.47 Effect sizes for\nmeasures that differed significantly be-\ntween long-term users and controls\nindicating moderate to large effects.\nThese results do not indicate a se-\nvere memory problem but could nev-\nertheless translate into clinically sig-\nnificantcognitiveimpairmentandcould\nimpact functioning in daily life. There\nwere significant differences between\nlong-term users and controls on 6 of the\n9 tests administered and performance\non 4 tests worsened as a function of in-\ncreasing years of cannabis use. De-\nspite this and a range of up to 17 years\nof cannabis use in the shorter-term user\ngroup, they differed significantly from\ncontrols only on time estimation.\nTable 4.

Test variables were significantly predicted by at least 1 cannabis use parameter.\nDefined as hours since last use of cannabis.\nAltered brain metabolism in shorter-\nterm users may be detected with sen-\nsitive techniques, such as functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging and posi-\ntron emission tomography, but the\nclinical significance of such changes re-\nmains obscure. The strength of this\nstudy is in its assessment of overtly rel-\nevant cognitive processes; our results\nsuggest that shorter-term cannabis us-\ners are not impaired to an extent that\nwould interfere with cognitive func-\ntioning in their daily lives. The fact that\nthe frequency of use was near daily\namong long- and shorter-term users\nsuggests that the duration of cannabis\nuse is a more salient contributor to the\ndevelopment of cognitive impairment\nthan quantity or frequency of use.\nWhile most cannabis users cease us-\ning in their mid-20s to late 20s, approxi-\nmately 20% continue to use through\ntheir 30s and beyond.2 This is the first\nstudy to our knowledge of a relatively\nlarge sample of long-term entrenched\ncannabis users seeking treatment. Con-\ncern about perceived cognitive impair-\nment was one of many problems asso-\nciated with cannabis use that led the\nusers in this study to seek treatment.\nThis concern is unlikely to have biased\nthe results of this study since a slightly\nhigher proportion of shorter-term vs\nlong-term users reported experiencing\ncognitive problems, yet shorter-term us-\ners mostly did not differ from controls\non the cognitive tests. Nevertheless, it\nis possible that long-term cannabis us-\ners in the community who are not seek-\ning treatment may not experience im-\npairments to the same degree as those\nassessed in this study.\nWhile acknowledging the limita-\ntions of retrospective designs, if care-\nfully controlled and analyzed, this ap-\nproach is the most efficient way to\nevaluate the long-term cognitive ef-\nfects of cannabis, given the costs and lo-\ngistical difficulties in using prospective\nresearch designs. The matching of\ngroups on measures of premorbid in-\ntellectual functioning that are resilient\nto brain damage, together with the ob-\nserved relationships between duration\nof cannabis use and test performance,\nsupport the assumption that the cogni-\ntive impairments observed in the long-\nterm users were not preexisting but de-\nvelopedasaresultoftheirprolongeduse\nof cannabis. Impairment appeared un-\nrelated to withdrawal phenomena. The\ncognitivefunctionsassessedinthisstudy\nare dependent on the intact function-\ning of the hippocampus, prefrontal cor-\ndensewithcannabinoidreceptors.56 The\neffects that exogenous cannabinoids ex-\nert on the cannabinoid receptor system\nand the role of endogenous cannabi-\nnoids as suggested by animal re-\nphysiological explanation for the\ndevelopment of cognitive impairments\nas the result of hypothesized long-term\nchanges occurring over many years of\nexposure to the drug.\nIn conclusion, our results confirm\nthat cognitive impairments develop as\na result of prolonged cannabis use, they\nendure beyond the period of acute in-\ntoxication, and they worsen with in-\ncreasing years of use. Impairments de-\nvelop gradually but may only become\nclinically significant and detectable by\nstandard neuropsychological tests af-\nter 1 to 2 decades of cannabis use. Nev-\nertheless, altered brain function with\nsubtle impairment has been shown to\nthat impairments would be greater\namong comorbid substance-depen-\ndent persons. The risk to most medi-\ncal cannabis users is likely to be small,\nas long as they are not maintained at\nhigh doses for many years. For ha-\nbitual users, the kinds of impairments\nobserved in this study have the poten-\ntial to impact academic achievements,\noccupational proficiency, interper-\nsonal relationships, and daily function-\ning. The extent to which these cogni-\ntive impairments may recover following\ncessation or reduction of cannabis use\nwill be addressed in a follow-up of this\nsample subsequent to treatment for can-\nnabis dependence.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design:\nSolowij, Stephens, Roffman.\nAcquisition of data: Stephens, Roffman, Kadden, Miller,\nChristiansen, McRee, Vendetti.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: Solowij, Ste-\nphens.\nDrafting of the manuscript: Solowij.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important in-\ntellectual content: Solowij, Stephens, Roffman, Ba-\nbor, Kadden, Miller, Christiansen, McRee, Vendetti.\nStatistical expertise: Solowij, Stephens.\nObtained funding: Solowij, Stephens, Roffman, Ba-\nbor, Kadden, Miller.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support: Solowij,\nRoffman, McRee, Vendetti.\nStudy supervision: Solowij, Stephens, Roffman, Ba-\nbor, Kadden, Miller, Christiansen, McRee, Vendetti.\nOther Members of the Marijuana Treatment Project\nResearch Group include Kathleen Carroll, PhD, Karen\nSteinberg, PhD, (Coordinating Center, University of\nConnecticut Health Center, Department of Commu-\nnity Medicine), Mark Litt, PhD (Farmington Clinical\nResearch Unit, University of Connecticut Health Cen-\nter, Department of Psychiatry), Jean Donaldson, MA,\nand James Herrell, PhD (Center for Substance Abuse\nTreatment).\nFunding/Support: This study was conducted as part\nof the Marijuana Treatment Project, a Cooperative\nAgreement for a multisite study of the effectiveness\nof brief treatment for cannabis dependence.
