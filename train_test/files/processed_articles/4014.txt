Two-hundred and eleven Australian males aged 18 to 34 years completed a Theory of Planned Behavior\nbelief-based questionnaire either online or paper based. Behavioral beliefs of \"be more relaxed\" and \"having fun,\" normative\nbeliefs of \"friends/mates\" and \"parents,\" and the control belief of \"presence of other people\" were revealed as independent\npredictors of intentions to drink and swim. These identified beliefs can be used to inform interventions to challenge young\nmales' alcohol use in, on, and around water.\n",

Alcohol and drugs are often present among young\nmales, and particularly for males aged 18 to 34 years, alcohol\nis considered to be a significant risk factor for drowning\n(Royal Life Saving Society, 2011). There is mounting evi-\ndence confirming the risk between alcohol use and drowning\nduring recreational aquatic activities (Driscoll, Harrison, &\nSteenkamp, 2003). Data on unintentional drowning deaths in\nAustralia found that within the 5-year period investigated,\nalcohol was involved in 21.6% of all drowning deaths\n(Franklin, Scarr, & Pearn, 2010). Each year it is estimated\nthat at least 20% of all adult drowning deaths are attributed\nto alcohol consumption, with this figure increasing to 41% in\nthe younger population groups (Royal Life Saving\nAssociation, 2011). If the prevalence of drinking and swim-\nming fatalities in young men has to decrease, a clear,\ntheoretically based understanding of males' decision making\nin this context is needed.\nThe Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991) is\none of the most influential models in explaining people's\ndecision making for a range of health and social behaviors\n(Armitage & Conner, 2001) and, thus, may be a useful model\nto adopt to understand this specific risk-taking behavior of\ndrinking and swimming. The TPB specifies intentions as the\nproximal determinant of behavior, with intentions predicted\nby attitude (positive/negative evaluations of the behavior),\nsubjective norm (perceived pressure from others to perform\nthe behavior), and perceived behavioral control (PBC; per-\nceived ease/difficulty of performing the behavior, also\nbelieved to influence behavior directly; Ajzen, 1991).\nAttitude, subjective norm, and PBC are informed by underly-\ning behavioral beliefs (costs and benefits), normative beliefs\n(others' approval/disapproval), and control beliefs (barriers\nand motivators), respectively (Ajzen, 1991). Measures of\nsuch underlying beliefs have increased our understanding of\npeople's behavior in a range of risk taking domains such as\necstasy use (Conner, Sherlock, & Orbell, 1998), safer sex\n(White, Terry, & Hogg, 1994), complying with speed limits\n(Elliott, Armitage, & Baughan, 2005), and binge drinking\n1Griffith University, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nKyra Hamilton, School of Applied Psychology, Griffith University, 176\nMessines Ridge Road, Mt Gravatt, Brisbane, QLD 4122, Australia.\nEmail: kyra.hamilton@griffith.edu.au\nCritical Beliefs Underlying Young\nAustralian Males' Intentions to Engage in\nDrinking and Swimming\nKyra Hamilton1 and Hannah Schmidt1\n Keywords\nswimming, alcohol use, theory of planned behavior, beliefs, young men\n2 SAGE Open\nbehavior (French & Cooke, 2012). No previous study has,\nhowever, documented the beliefs underlying males' inten-\ntions to engage in drinking and swimming. Ajzen (1991) sug-\ngests that belief elicitation should occur for each new behavior\nor target population being investigated as the underlying rea-\nsons as to why people hold certain attitudes, perceptions of\nsocial pressure, and behavioral control may differ according\nto the specific behavior or population being targeted. Taking\nthis targeted approach to identifying the beliefs of young\nmales, an at-risk group of drinking and swimming-related\ndeaths, in this context is important given that drowning fatali-\nties are on the rise (Royal Life Saving Society, 2011).\nUsing the TPB as a theoretical framework, we aimed to\ninvestigate the critical beliefs that underlie males' intentions\nto drink and swim. First, we expected that significant corre-\nlations would be observed between the behavioral, norma-\ntive, and control beliefs for drinking and swimming. Second,\nwe expected that some of the significant key beliefs would\nindependently predict males'intentions. Finally, in an explor-\natory manner, we examined the relative number of males\nwho fully and strongly accepted each of these beliefs to\ndetermine the usefulness of the belief for subsequent inter-\nvention strategies.\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe sample comprised 211 Australian males ranging in age\nwere included in the study if they met the age requirement\nand engaged in alcohol use. The second author recruited par-\nticipants via convenience sampling methods using three\nmain recruitment strategies: online advertising (e.g.,\nFacebook), face-to-face (e.g., university campuses, public\nbeaches), and snowball. Participants were given the option to\nenter into a prize draw, to win one of five AUD$20 depart-\nment store gift cards or, if appropriate, receive course credit.\nThe majority of participants reported living in Queensland\nand were not suffering from an acute/chronic medical condi-\nwere in a partnered relationship (n = 92, 44.3%) and did not\nhave children (n = 186, 89%). Two items measuring the typi-\ncal quantity of standard drinks consumed in a single occasion\nand the frequency of heavy drinking episodes taken from the\npsychometrically sound (Reinert & Allen, 2007) Alcohol\nUse Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Babor, Higgins-\nBiddle, Saunders, & Monterio, 2001) indicated that the\nalcohol, did so at hazardous levels. In addition, 45% of the\nmen indicated they engaged to a greater than small extent in\ndrinking and swimming (scored  2 on a 7-point\nscale), measured with a single item assessing participants'\nengagement in drinking and swimming in the previous 6\nmonths (\"In the past 6 months, to what extent did you drink\nand swim,\" scored a small extent [1] to a large extent [7]).\nMeasures\nTarget behavior.Consistent with Ajzen's (1991), the target\nbehavior was defined as drinking and swimming in the next 6\nmonths. Drinking was operationalized as having a blood alco-\nhol concentration (BAC) of more than 0.05. This definition\nwas adopted in line with drunk walking (Haque et al., 2012)\nand drunk driving research (Rivis, Abraham, & Snook, 2011),\nand research that indicates having a BAC of more than 0.05\nimpairs judgment and performance ability (Howat, Sleet, &\nSmith, 1991). To assist participants with this definition, a stan-\ndard drink chart was presented with accompanied information\nreferring to amount of alcohol which can be consumed to\nremain under 0.05. Swimming was operationalized as partak-\ning in activities explicitly related to water and undertaken for\nfun, pleasure, or amateur sport. Boating and personal water\ncrafts were excluded as operation of such vehicles while intox-\nicated is illegal and may carry additional social undesirability\naffecting self-reported intentions. The behaviors applied to\nopen water ways, such as rivers, creeks, streams, lakes, oceans,\nand harbors, as open water ways have been identified as high-\nrisk locations with the largest number of drowning deaths\n(Royal Life Saving Society, 2011). Accordingly, public and\nprivate swimming pools were excluded. The operationaliza-\ntion of swimming behavior was guided by Driscoll et al.'s\n(2003) definition of recreational aquatic activities. These defi-\nnitions were used consistently in all waves of data.\nElicitation Pilot Study\nFollowing guidelines outlined by Ajzen (1991), an elicitation\nto identify salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs\nconcerning drinking and swimming. The pilot questionnaire\ncomprised open-ended question as outlined by Fishbein and\nAjzen (1975). Thematic content analysis was undertaken to\nidentify the most common responses to each of the TPB\nbelief-based questions and formed the beliefs to be assessed\nin the current study (Joffe & Yardley, 2004).\nMain Questionnaire\nThe TPB constructs were measured in accordance with stan-\ndard TPB procedures (Ajzen, 1991). To maximize the congru-\nence between the prediction and criterion variables, the TPB\nvariables were measured at the same level specified and con-\nstructed in line with TPB recommendations (Ajzen, 1991).\nIntention. Five items assessed the strength of intention to per-\nform the target behavior (e.g., I intend to drink and swim,\nHamilton and Schmidt 3\nscored strongly disagree [1] to strongly agree [7]). The mea-\nsure was reliable with an alpha coefficient of .96.\nBehavioral beliefs.Behavioral beliefs were assessed by the\neight single-item salient behavioral beliefs derived from the\npilot study. Participants were asked to indicate how likely the\nfive costs (e.g., have impaired swimming ability) and the\nthree benefits (e.g., be more social) would result if they\nengaged in drinking and swimming in the next 6 months.\nResponses ranged from extremely unlikely (1) to extremely\nlikely (7).\nNormative beliefs.Normative beliefs were assessed by the\nseven single-item specific referents identified in the elicita-\ntion study. Participants were asked to rate how likely the\nseven referents (e.g., partner/girlfriend, parents) would\napprove of them drinking and swimming in the next 6\nmonths. Responses ranged from extremely unlikely (1) to\nextremely likely (7).\nControl beliefs.Control beliefs were assessed by the three\nsingle-item facilitators (e.g., presence of other people) and\nthree single-item inhibitors (e.g., bad water conditions)\nderived from the elicitation study. Participants rated how\nlikely it was that these factors would prevent them from\ndrinking and swimming in the next 6 months, and responses\nranged from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).\nDesign and Procedure\nEthical clearance was granted by the University Human\nResearch Ethics Committee. A cross-sectional correlational\ndesign was adopted to investigate the ability of the TPB and\nadditional variables to predict males' intentions to drink and\nswim. The study involved the completion of a self-report\nquestionnaire assessing the TPB standard and belief-based\nconstructs and measures of group norm, anticipated regret,\nand risk perceptions either online (n =77, 36.5%) or paper-\nbased items in predicting males' drinking and swimming\nintentions to highlight key targets for interventions to combat\nthis risk-taking behavior (Fishbein, von Haeften, &\nAppleyard, 2001). Online findings compared with traditional\npen-and-paper data have been shown to be equivocal (Lewis,\nWatson, & White, 2009). In the current study, bivariate anal-\nyses with Bonferroni adjustment (to avoid chance capitaliza-\ntion) of the study's variables across the methods of\nquestionnaire delivery reveal no substantive differences.\nData Analysis\nTo determine the critical beliefs that guide males' intention\nto drink and swim, guidelines as specified by von Haeften,\nFishbein, Kasprzyk, and Montano (2001) were followed.\nFirst, to identify the beliefs which are significantly correlated\nwith males' intentions, the Pearson product\u00admoment\ncorrelation matrix was analyzed. Second, to identify the key\nbeliefs which make independent, significant contributions to\nintention within each belief-based measure (e.g., behavioral,\nnormative, and control beliefs), significant beliefs are entered\nin a stepwise multiple regression analysis. Third, to identify\ncritical beliefs, all key beliefs, which made an independent\nsignificant contribution to the prediction of intentions, were\nentered into a final regression. Last, to identify those critical\nbeliefs for resultant interventions, in an exploratory analysis,\nthe principles of Hornik and Woolf (1999) were applied,\nwhich suggests that for effective intervention programs there\nshould be a relative number of individuals who do not already\nhold the belief. Therefore, as a final step, critical beliefs were\nexamined to determine the percentage of males who fully\nand strongly accept the belief.\nResults\nCritical Beliefs Underlying Intention\nAs shown in Table 1, bivariate correlations revealed that six\nof the eight behavioral beliefs, all of the normative beliefs,\nTable 1.

Multiple regression anal-\nysis on the significant behavioral beliefs revealed \"having\nfun\" ( = .41), \"feel more relaxed\" ( = .26), and \"increased\nchance of injury/accidents\" ( = .11), as significant predic-\ntors of intention. Multiple regression analysis on the signifi-\ncant normative beliefs revealed \"friends/mates\" ( = .49),\n\"partner/girlfriend\" ( = .18), and \"parents\" ( = .16) as sig-\nnificant predictors of intention. Multiple regression analysis\non the significant control beliefs revealed \"others around me\ndrinking\" ( = -.19), \"presence of other people\" ( = -.16),\nand \"presence of authority figures\" ( = -.22), as significant\npredictors of intention.\nTo identify critical beliefs, the nine significant individual\nbelief predictors mentioned above were entered into a final\nregression analysis. Five critical beliefs, \"feel more relaxed,\"\n\"having fun,\" \"friends/mates,\" \"parents,\" and \"presence of\nother people,\" were identified as significant independent pre-\ndictors of intention. Of these critical beliefs, there were a\nlarge percentage of males who did not already fully or\nstrongly accept these beliefs, refer to Table 2. The final\nmodel explained 57% (adjusted R2 = .56) of the variance in\nDiscussion\nThe current study aimed to investigate using a TPB belief-\nbased approach the critical beliefs that underlie males' inten-\ntions to drink and swim; an investigation not yet undertaken\nsystematically in this at-risk group. Support was provided for\nunderlying beliefs guiding males' decisions in this context in\nthat various behavioral, normative, and controls beliefs were\nidentified as making an independent contribution to inten-\ntion. The findings of this study support that of previous\nresearch, where the role of beliefs in guiding people's deci-\nsions have been noted in the prediction of general\nhealth-related behaviors (e.g., Armitage & Conner, 2001) as\nwell as in health risk behaviors, such as binge drinking\nThe results of the current study provide the basis for the\nbeliefs to target in resultant intervention work aimed at com-\nbating young males' drinking and swimming behavior. First,\nin examining the behavioral beliefs suggests that males focus\non their evaluations of the outcomes of engaging in drinking\nand swimming when forming an intention to do so.\nSpecifically, males focus on whether or not they believe that\ndrinking and swimming will result in them feeling more\nrelaxed and having fun. Moreover, 54% of males endorsed\nfully or strongly as accepting the belief that drinking and\nswimming would be fun. Thus, for young males, the social\ncontext in which they are engaged is important in forming an\nintention to undertake such a risky behavior of drinking and\nswimming. These findings have important implications for\nresultant interventions to discourage such behaviors and\nhighlight in particular the need to promote the not so fun side\nof drinking and swimming.\nAlthough more behavioral disadvantages compared with\nadvantages were included within the study (as a result of\npilot testing), only positive behavioral outcomes seem to\nguide males' intentions to drink and swim; revealing none of\nthe beliefs underlying perceptions of risk as being influential\nin this context. This finding could suggest that participants\ndid not perceive that drinking and swimming is a risky\nbehavior that may incur negative consequences, similar to\nprevious findings on mobile phone use while driving (White,\nHyde, Walsh, & Watson, 2010). It could also be the case that\nthese males were inaccurate in estimating their beliefs about\nthe negative consequences of drinking and swimming.\nPrevious results have found men to be particularly inaccurate\nin their risk perceptions, by overestimating their ability and\nunderestimating the risk involved regarding aquatic activity\nHamilton and Schmidt 5\n(McCool, Ameratunga, Moran, & Robinson, 2009). In addi-\ntion, the sample in this study comprised heavy drinkers, and\ngenerally, heavy drinkers perceive more positive and less\nnegative outcomes from alcohol use than light drinkers\n(Wiers, van Woerden, Smulders, & de Jong, 2002).\nThe results revealed also important information on nor-\nmative beliefs indicating further that not only is the social\ncontext important to consider but the social pressure from\nimportant others is an important area which can be targeted\nto reduce men's drinking and swimming behaviors. The\nfindings suggest that it is closer (e.g., friends, parents),\nrather than more distant people (e.g., police), who are most\ninfluential on males' intentions to drink and swim. The\nresults suggest that men who feel that their friends and par-\nents think that they should drink and swim are more likely\nto form an intention to do so--a finding consistent with\nnormative influences identified in risky drinking domains\n(Johnson & White, 2004). The influence of peers and\nfriends on decisions to use alcohol has been consistently\nsupported in the literature (Marcoux & Shope, 1997), with\nthe men in this study perceiving that their friends/mates\nmoderately approved of the behavior (M = 4.11, SD =\n1.83). Accordingly, the perceived social pressure from\nfriends/mates are important to consider in the context of\nyoung males' drinking and swimming, and, as indicated by\nthe percentage of men who hold this belief, the belief does\nnot appear to be salient and, thus, may be an effective strat-\negy to challenge. In addition, the results suggest that the\nmore men feel that their parents approve of the behavior,\nthe more pressure they feel to drink and swim. Although\nrevealed as a critical belief, with parental approval posi-\ntively correlated with intention, the mean indicated that\nperceived levels of approval were low (M = 2.04, SD =\n1.38), with very minimal participants (2.8%) strongly or\nfully accepting the belief that parents approve of such a\nrisky behavior. Therefore, although parents may exert\ninfluence over intention to drink and swim, the majority\nview parents as non-approving of the behavior and, thus,\ntargeting parents' disapproval rather than their approval\nmay be an effective strategy for challenging males' inten-\ntions to drink and swim.\nFinally, inspection of the control beliefs revealed the\nbelief of the presence of other people as a significant inde-\npendent predictor of males' intention to drink and swim.\nSpecifically, the less likely other people are perceived to be\npresent when one engages in drinking and swimming the less\nlikely one will intend to do so. The finding concurs with pre-\nvious research that suggests men are more likely to engage in\nrisk-taking behaviors when others are present (Varela &\nPritchard, 2011). This belief may be rationalized on the basis\nthat in the event that something goes wrong, other people\nwill be there to help. To combat this belief and to reduce the\nincidence of males drinking and swimming, it may be useful\nfor resultant interventions to highlight the classic bystander\nstates that in an emergency people are less likely to help\nwhen they are with others.\nAlthough the current study has a number of strengths\nincluding the examination of an at-risk population for drown-\ning, having a relatively large representative sample, and\nusing a well-established theoretical approach to identify crit-\nical drinking and swimming beliefs, the current study also\nhas a number of limitations. First, the sample predominately\ncame from an English-speaking background and the find-\nings, therefore, may not be generalized to other ethnic com-\nmunities. Previous research has indicated that Caucasians\ndrink more than other races/nationalities (Windle, 2003),\nwhich could in part explain the high rates of hazardous drink-\ning practices indicated within the sample. Thus, future\nresearch is needed to confirm the study's findings with indi-\nviduals from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds.\nFurthermore, the use of self-report measures, which tend to\nbe susceptible to social desirability bias, may have led to an\nunder-reporting of socially undesirable behaviors (Davis,\nThake, & Vilhena, 2010). However, the TPB has been shown\nto be a good predictor of both actual and self-reported behav-\nior (Armitage & Conner, 2001) and given the difficulty of\naccurate objective measures within the current context, self-\nreport measures provide a practical alternative. The study\nalso examined intentions only without explicitly examining\nactual drinking and swimming behavior. Although due to the\ntiming of data collection being conducted over winter, and\ngiven the target behavior is not one which is expected to fre-\nquently occur especially in the colder season, intentions have\nbeen shown to be the strongest predictor of subsequent\nbehavior explaining on average 27% of the variance\n(Armitage & Conner, 2001). However, further examination\nof the relationship between the TPB constructs and behav-\nioral performance may allow for a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of males' drinking and swimming participa-\ntion. In addition, the drinking behavior in the current study\nwas operationalized as having a BAC of more than 0.05, and\nit may be useful to assess the intentions of males to drink and\nswim at more or less hazardous drinking levels to determine\nif similar beliefs hold for different levels of drinking behav-\niors. Finally, although the study revealed a number of beliefs\nto target in intervention programs, research is needed to\ndetermine the efficacy of interventions targeting such beliefs\nin changing males' intention and subsequently behavior.\nOverall, the current study aimed to provide an under-\nstanding of the beliefs underlying the drinking and swim-\nming behaviors among Australian men, which, to date, has\nreceived scant empirical attention. To the authors' knowl-\nedge, this is the first study to investigate the beliefs of male\nalcohol use and recreational swimming from a sound theo-\nretical basis. The study identified a number of beliefs under-\nlying this risk taking behavior that can be used in resultant\nintervention strategies aimed at decreasing males'swimming\nand drinking. Given that drowning is a common yet prevent-\nable problem, an increased understanding for at-risk target\n6 SAGE Open\npopulations is required to reduce drowning rates. This study\nwas able to determine those critical beliefs of young males'\nintentions to drink and swim that can now inform the devel-\nopment of resultant intervention and prevention programs\ndesigned to discourage alcohol use in, on, or around water.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAjzen, I.
