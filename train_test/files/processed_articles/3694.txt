This article elaborated on previous research on organizational information culture and its impact on information\nuse outcomes in policing by examining perceived impediments to information sharing of 134 officers in three Canadian\npolice organizations. Inductive qualitative analysis of an open-ended question revealed seven mutually exclusive impediment\nthemes: processes/technology, individual unwillingness, organizational unwillingness, workload/overload, location/structure,\nleadership, and risk management. When viewed from the knowledge management infrastructure perspective, organizational\nstructure was the single most common impediment identified, followed closely by organizational culture. Each organization\nhad unique constellations of information sharing impediments. Recommendations for policy and practice are discussed.\n",

Support for this statement, from the\nAmerican perspective, is illustrated by a recent review into\nthe 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States by Best Jr.\n(2011). Within his report, Best Jr. suggested that the paradox\nof sharing secret information and risk management as well as\ndisparate information cultures, technologies, and policies\nblinded law enforcement and intelligence agencies to \"con-\nnect the dots\" (p. ii). Similarly, Canadian law enforcement\nand intelligence agencies received scathing critiques for their\ninformation and knowledge sharing policy and practice fail-\nures, as illustrated by the Bernardo Investigation Review\n(Campbell, 1996); the Commission of Inquiry into the\nBombing of Air India Flight 182 (Government of Canada,\n2010); and the Missing Women Commission of Inquiry in\nBritish Columbia (Oppal, 2012). Within these three inci-\ndents, police were critiqued for their failure to communicate\nand cooperate across jurisdictions, their deficient knowledge\nand information support systems and structures, and for per-\nsonal and organizational values and biases that blocked\neffective and efficient information and knowledge sharing\nwithin and without the police intelligence arena.\nThe idealized and normative notion of democratic knowl-\nedge sharing suggests that information should flow freely\nwithin and across all levels of civil society and that every\nperson would have access to the information (Veld, 2010).\nHowever, this free flow of information, within the context of\ncontemporary policing, must be grounded within the realities\nand influence of information and knowledge accessibility,\npolitics, need for information security, values, and organiza-\ntional context. Whereas much attention in recent years has\nbeen focused on the criminal intelligence aspects of informa-\ntion and knowledge sharing in police organizations, the\nbroader and more common day-to-day impediments to infor-\nmation and knowledge sharing within the larger body of rank\nand file officers have largely been overlooked.\nDespite the broadly reported business management tenet\nthat organizational information and knowledge resources are\nkey assets to be exploited to support better organizational\ndecision making, policies and practices, innovation and out-\ncomes, many police organizations do not have explicit\nknowledge management (KM) strategies and/or persistently\n1Victoria Police Department, British Columbia, Canada\n2Charles Sturt University, Manly, New South Wales, Australia\nCorresponding Author:\nDouglas Edward Abrahamson, Victoria Police Department, 850 Caledonia\nAve., Victoria, BC V8T 5J8, Canada.\nEmail: dabrahamson@shaw.ca\nImpediments to Information and\nKnowledge Sharing Within Policing:\nA Study of Three Canadian Policing\nOrganizations\nDouglas Edward Abrahamson1,2 and Jane Goodman-Delahunty2\n Keywords\npolice, information sharing, impediments, culture, infrastructure\n2 SAGE Open\nfail to recognize that management of knowledge resources\ninvolves factors above and beyond the requisite technologi-\ncal support systems (Ch\u00e1vez, Pendleton, & Bueerman, 2005;\nunique to policing, as public and private sector organizations\noften ignore organizational structure, process capabilities,\nculture and/or organizational context factors when imple-\nmenting KM systems or considering the overall health of\ntheir information and knowledge sharing environments\nGold, Malhotra, & Segars, 2001). In addition, many police\norganizations fail to fully explore or understand the underly-\ning information and KM context, structures, and processes,\neach of which may act either as barriers or enablers to infor-\nmation and knowledge acquisition, organization, control,\ndissemination, and use within the organization (Ekblom,\nWhen examined from a North American policing perspec-\ntive, such oversights are far from trivial and must be addressed\nfor three important reasons: First, the political, social, eco-\nnomic, and information sharing context in which police orga-\nnizations operate has become increasingly complex and\ninter-dependent (Ratcliffe, 2012). At the same time, stake-\nholders have become more demanding for public sector\nreforms, which include the need for improved accountability,\nefficacy, and efficiency (Stone & Travis, 2011; Walsh &\nConway, 2011). Second, police organizations are knowledge\nintensive and rely on a deep and broad information and\nknowledge base to support organizational administrative,\noperational, and strategic initiatives (Dean & Gottschalk,\n2007). Third, all contemporary North American policing\nmodels rely on information and knowledge to feed and sup-\nport their crime prevention and enforcement innovations and\nmodels, including, but not limited to intelligence-led\nCompstat (Willis, Mastrofski, & Kochel, 2010), problem-\noriented, and/or community-based policing models (Braga &\nWeisburd, 2007). Information and knowledge sharing best\npractices, as they relate to North American intelligence-led\npolicing and related policing models and as a means to effec-\ntively and efficiently manage limited police resources, have\nstrong ties to the British National Intelligence Model (Bureau\nCanada chose to develop and implement a \"made-in-Canada\"\ncriminal intelligence model, which also had a strong focus on\n\"effective intelligence-led policing by establishing standards\nfor intelligence-related structures, processes and practices\"\n(Criminal Intelligence Service Canada, 2008, p. 1).\nDespite the importance of individual police officers in the\nprocess of information and knowledge sharing, across all\npolice endeavors, few empirical studies of the effectiveness\nof information sharing within police organizations have been\nconducted. Accordingly, little is known about potential barri-\ners that may impede knowledge and information sharing at\nthe individual police officer and organization level.\nThe aim of the present study was to identify the informa-\ntion sharing impediments within this policing context, to\nidentify potential policy and practice misalignment(s), and to\ngain a better understanding of the information barriers faced\nby the rank and file officers so that police leaders will be\nempowered to take appropriate steps to lower and/or elimi-\nnate those barriers in the future. A brief overview of KM\npractice, theory, and its connection to organizational infra-\nstructures, as they apply to policing policy and practice,\nserves to highlight areas that may become barriers or enablers\nto information sharing.\nKM\nManagement and information science studies have docu-\nmented a continued evolution toward a knowledge society\nwhere public and private organizations are no longer viewed\nas merely processing or using information for problem solv-\ning but also as creating new information and knowledge in a\ndynamic process that involves interaction and adaptation to a\nchanging and turbulent environment (Bason, 2010; Nonaka,\nthe advent of knowledge management, whereby knowledge,\nin explicit and tacit forms, is an organizational resource to be\ncaptured, created, transferred, and utilized within that orga-\nSince the 1990s, organizations have invested significant\ntime, financial, and other resources in KM systems and prac-\ntices in the hopes of achieving increased performance, inno-\nvation, and improved decision making (Davenport & Prusak,\ncomes of many of these initiatives within policing have\nfailed to meet organizational expectations as governmental\nsupport has been mixed and mere information passing does\nnot constitute collaboration or knowledge creation within\nIn addition, a number of academics have challenged the\nnotion that knowledge, or \"what we know,\" can in fact be\n\"captured\" or embedded within an information technology\n(IT) process (Wilson, 2002) or whether it can be \"objecti-\nfied\" due to the nature of interpretation and the divergent\n\"world views\" of those knowing and those receiving (Butler,\n. . . if information technology is to be utilized to give voice to\norganizational narratives, then it must be recognized that it will\nbe a conduit for data only. And, because gaps in comprehension\nwill always exist, no matter how sophisticated the technology\nand its power of representation, IT must enable a dialectic to\ntake place between social actors and the phenomena they wish to\nunderstand. (p. 7)\nIn essence, IT is not the panacea for effective information\nand knowledge creation and management within policing but\nmerely a system that facilitates the dialectic process between\nindividuals, organizational units, and external partners. The\nAbrahamson and Goodman-Delahunty 3\nend goal is to create a system that facilitates the conversion\nof intelligence into a form that can be operationalized.\nWithin this individual, organizational, and external dia-\nlectic, apparently competing and opposing concepts and\npositions are brought to light as police leaders and organiza-\ntions respond to policy and practice issues within their com-\nmunities. Two broad examples of these include budget\nconstraints and increased public expectations (Police Sector\nCouncil, 2006) and public and private policing (Law\nCommission of Canada, 2006). Both examples illustrate two\ncompeting realities that are at the forefront of contemporary\nNorth American policing policy and practice. Therefore, the\ndialectic process is important as it is a dynamic process that\nallows the reconciliation of what often appear to be compet-\ning and/or polar opposite ideas, concepts, or positions. In\ntheir explanation of paradox and its relation to knowledge,\nTakeuchi and Nonaka (2004) posited that in times of com-\nplexity, leading organizations must not only face opposing\nand paradoxical positions but also embrace a number of\nthese paradoxes at the same time. Furthermore, instead of\nthinking of opposing concepts and positions as \"either or\"\nstatements or \"this versus that\" Takeuchi and Nonaka sug-\ngested that mutually inclusive perspectives be taken where\nconcepts such as \"control and independence\" (p. 6), \"micro\n(individual) and macro (environment)\" (p. 9), and \"top-down\nand bottom-up\" (p. 9) are considered simultaneously. They\nprovided an explanation of how these opposing concepts are\nactually inter-dependent, inter-penetrating, and unifying:\nTo complicate matters, we need to understand that opposites are\nactually not really opposites; hence the use of terms such as\n\"what appears to be opposites\" or \"seemingly opposite\" thus far.\nFor one thing, opposites are interdependent, meaning that\nopposites depend on each other. It wouldn't make sense to talk\nabout darkness if there were no such thing as light. Each member\nof a polar opposite seems to need the other to make it what it is.\nSecond, opposites are interpenetrating, which means that\nopposites can be found in each other. There is some light in\nevery darkness, and some darkness in every light. If we look into\none thing hard enough, we can find its opposite right there.\nThird, opposites can turn into the same thing if we take an\nopposite to its very ultimate extreme and make it absolute. Thus,\nif we make darkness absolute, we are blind--we can't see\nanything. And if we make light absolute, we are equally blind\nand unable to see. (Takeuchi & Nonaka, 2004, p. 9)\nKeeping Takeuchi and Nonaka's (2004) explanation of\nparadox in mind, we can see how paradoxes might present\nthemselves when police leaders try to balance the competing\nneeds of the police organization, the local community, key\nstakeholders, and individual police officers. Having served\nmore than 30 years in policing and personally observed para-\ndoxes in various policing contexts in that time period, the\nprimary author offers a series of seven paradoxical goals\nwithin policing for consideration: secure and open, struc-\ntured and flexible, individual and group, conformity and\ndiversity, innovation and stability, certainty and risk, and\nloose and connected. Further elaboration on this topic is pro-\nvided in the Conclusion section of this article.\nUnderpinning these ostensible contradictions are three\nKM infrastructures that support the KM process: structural\n(Jacobson, 2006). Each of these infrastructures may act\neither as barrier or enabler to information and knowledge\nacquisition, organization, control, dissemination, and use\nwithin police organizations.\nThe current study extended previous quantitative findings\non organizational information culture and its impact on\ninformation use outcomes in three Canadian policing organi-\nzations (Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty, 2013), by\nexamining the impediments to information and knowledge\nsharing perceived by 134 sworn officers working in these\norganizations. This study complements the quantitative study\nby providing a rich, complex, and multi-dimensional \"insid-\ner's\" and \"ground-level\" view of the perceived impediments\nto information and knowledge sharing within policing as\nidentified by the end-users of that information, the officers.\nBy asking an open-ended question about perceived barriers\nto information sharing, we were able to explore the partici-\npant's experiences, values, and behaviors, which would not\nbe evident or available in the aggregated quantitative data.\nKM Infrastructures\nWhere the resource-based theory of an organization recog-\nnizes the importance of the behavioral and social context in\nwhich organizations operate as resources, capabilities, and\ncompetencies (Barney, Ketchen, & Wright, 2011), the knowl-\nedge-based theory of the organization builds on that platform\nby conceptualizing the ability to transfer and utilize knowl-\nedge as an organization's greatest asset and competitive\nadvantage (Nonaka, Toyama, & Hirata, 2008; Spender &\nGrant, 1996). This knowledge transfer and utility within the\norganization cannot be accomplished without appropriate\ninfrastructures to support the process. The integral nature of\nthese support principles within North American policing was\nillustrated by quantitative findings showing that information\npolicies, strategies, and systems (structure and technology),\nand information values, norms, and behaviors of the organi-\nzation (culture) affected the information use outcomes of\nproblem solving, creating work that is beneficial, and infor-\nmation sharing (Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty,2013).\nTo better understand potential sources of barriers or\nimpediments to information sharing within police organiza-\ntions, a brief account of the three KM infrastructures, as con-\nceptualized by Gold et al. (2001), is provided, namely, the\nstructural, technical, and cultural components of KM.\nKM structures.Organizational KM structures provide the\nbackbone for power, coordination, and control within an\norganization and essentially serve to guide and coordinate\n4 SAGE Open\nthe tasks and activities of individuals as they work toward a\ncommon organizational goal (Liao, Chuang, & To, 2011).\nThese structures, whether at the unit or organizational level,\nserve to align and coordinate lines of responsibility, author-\nity, communication as well as implement institutional rules,\npolicies, practices, and processes. In addition to the organi-\nzational rules and roles that guide individual action, structure\nalso includes the configuration, placement, and physical\nlocation of individual organizational units, which \"can influ-\nence knowledge management processes through shaping pat-\nternsandfrequenciesofcommunicationamongorganizational\nmembers, stipulating locations of decision-making, and\naffecting efficiency and effectiveness in implementing new\nTherefore, the transfer and utility of knowledge within the\norganization may be helped or hindered by organizational\nstructures that are in place at any given point in time, thereby\naffecting, positively or negatively, the desired goals and out-\ncomes of the organization. Within the context of policing,\nsuch structures include rank, roles, and the location and coor-\ndination of organizational units, divisions, and/or agencies\namong others. By way of example, a prior study of the impact\nof information management and information behaviors and\nvalues within three Canadian police organizations revealed\nthat the structures and processes associated with information\nmanagement and information sharing were moderately cor-\nrelated with the achievement of the information use out-\ncomes (Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty, 2013). This\ncorrelation can be increased by the presence of more effec-\ntive structures and processes within the organization.\nInformation processes and structures, however, do not stand\nalone nor operate in isolation and must be supported by a\ntechnical infrastructure.\nTechnical KM infrastructure. The technical infrastructure pro-\nvides technical support for rapid knowledge creation, storage\nand retrieval, transfer, and application within the organiza-\ntion and may include IT systems such as data warehouses,\nInternets, intranets, knowledge directories, and/or portals\n(Alavi & Leidner, 2001). This same technology is used to\nfacilitate communication as well as consolidate what other-\nwise would be fragmented flows of information and knowl-\nedge within the organization. Accordingly, the technological\nstructure plays a key role within the KM process (Lee &\nTechnology, as it relates to policing, has profoundly\nshaped policing practice over the past 50 years. It was not\nthat long ago that police officers were given truly \"mobile\"\npolice radios. Now, with current technologies, including\nmobile data terminals (MDTs) and powerful local, provin-\ncial, and national information databases, communication net-\nworks, and KM systems, police organizations constantly\ncreate, store, retrieve, transfer, and apply knowledge for the\norganization's benefit and to improve policy, practice, and\nperformance. The current study explored whether\ntechnology, along with two other infrastructures, was seen to\nfacilitate or hinder the information and knowledge sharing\nprocess within three municipal law enforcement agencies.\nThe technological aspect of KM, however, has had its\ncritics. Some described it as a management consulting fad\n(Wilson, 2002) or as creating a technological dependency\n(Huysman & de Wit, 2004) that ignores existing work or\ngroup needs (Malhotra, 2004). Notwithstanding such criti-\ncisms, KM technology support systems continue to be used\nwithin the public and private sectors as knowledge transfer\nremains a goal for many organizations that wish to improve\nperformance within their market and local context.Therefore,\nthe technical infrastructure needs and application must be\ngiven careful consideration in relation to the KM needs and\ngoals of each policing organization. This perspective was\nsupported by recent findings indicating that information\nmanagement, comprised of information policies, strategies,\nand systems within an organization, was one of five factors\nthat collectively accounted for 41% of the outcome variance\nin three Canadian policing organizations (Abrahamson &\nOrganizational culture.Organizational culture has consis-\ntently been recognized as a primary factor in the success or\nfailure of information and knowledge sharing within organi-\na central role within the findings of this study. Simply put,\norganizational culture is defined as the shared assumptions,\nbeliefs, values (establishing priorities), and norms (establish-\ning appropriate attitudes and behaviors) within an organiza-\ntion (Schein, 2004) and includes the sub-cultures that exist\nwithin the various units, sections, or departments within the\norganization (Hofstede, 1998). Individuals are not only\nguided by their own sets of values but are also governed by\nthe socially legitimated standards and norms set within the\norganization. Corporate cultures can be generally classified\nas either weakly or strongly functional (supportive) or\nweakly or strongly dysfunctional (not supportive), depend-\ning on how clearly the organizational culture is defined,\ncommunicated, understood, and managed on a day-to-day\nbasis in relation to the organizational goals (Flamholtz &\nA supportive culture is one in which employees not only\nunderstand and articulate the espoused values and standards\nof performance but also puts them into action each and every\nday. By contrast, a dysfunctional culture is one in which\norganizational values, even though they may be known by\nemployees, are left for personal interpretation and imple-\nmentation, with little to no \"management\" or follow-up by\nleaders within the organization (Flamholtz & Randle, 2011;\nSchein, 2010). For this reason, leadership is important in\n\"setting the tone\" and facilitating the socialization, external-\nization, combination, and internalization of knowledge and\ninnovation within and across organizations (von Krogh,\nAbrahamson and Goodman-Delahunty 5\nand innovation, however, are not organizational assets unless\nshared and integrated into practice. Not only does a culture\nof knowledge and innovation sharing have practical implica-\ntions for policing, it has been recognized as of paramount\nimportance within all aspects of police operations and strate-\ngic management (LeBeuf & Par\u00e9, 2005; Murphy & McKenna,\nIt is critical that organizational leaders not only identify\nthe larger technological, structural, and cultural issues that\nhave supported or impeded the achievement of specific orga-\nnizational goals, but they must also specifically identify\nwhich of these factors has the greatest impact on the organi-\nzation's ability to achieve its goals. For example,Abrahamson\nand Goodman-Delahunty (2013) demonstrated that two\ninformation management and information behavior and\nvalue factors consisting of (a) information management,\nintegrity, and transparency, and (b) information sharing and\nproactiveness collectively accounted for 71% of the variance\nin the achievement of specific information use outcomes. By\nexamining the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the\ninformation sharing experiences within these three police\norganizations, a broader and deeper understanding can\nbe gained of the actual and perceived impediments to infor-\nmation sharing and how these impediments affect the\nachievement of organizational goals and outcomes.\nInformation Sharing and Use\nHuman and organizational information use has been viewed\nfrom a variety of perspectives within the discipline of infor-\nmation studies. These perspectives include seven informa-\ntion use elements/principles that were synthesized from the\nbroader information studies literature, namely (a) informa-\ntion practices, (b) information search, (c) information pro-\ncessing, (d) information production, (e) the application of\ninformation, (f) knowledge construction, and (g) the effects\nof information use (Kari, 2010). An organization-focused\nand pragmatic information use perspective was provided by\nChoo (2006), who stated that an organization uses informa-\ntion \"to make sense of change in its environment; to create\nnew knowledge for innovation; and to make decisions about\nThis explanation is particularly important to knowledge\nintensive organizations such as police agencies, because a\nnexus exists between an organization's information/KM,\ninformation behaviors, values, beliefs, and the organization's\ninformation use outcomes and performance (Abrahamson &\nGoodman-Delahunty, 2013; Choo, Bergeron, Detlor, &\nNotably, recent research conducted within police organiza-\ntions identified positive correlations between the information\nintegrity, management, transparency, sharing, and proactive-\nness constructs and the information use outcomes of problem\nsolving, creating work that is beneficial, and information\nsharing (Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty, 2013). Within\nthe policing organization, these constructs not only affect\ninformation use outcomes but also assist the organization in\nmaking sense of the changes in the larger environment.\nMaking Sense of Change in Policing\nPolicing in the modern era is complex, costly, time-consum-\ning, and pluralistic in nature. Police do not merely enforce the\nlaw or maintain the peace within the communities they serve.\nThere is an expectation that they will reduce crime and disor-\nder, reduce fear of crime, solve community issues, and\nencourage cooperation within the communities (Gallagher,\nMaguire, Mastrofski, & Reisig, 2001). Adding to this com-\nplexity is the recognition that organized crime, technological\ncrime, and terrorism know no boundaries, and these issues are\nIt is within this volatile and equivocal environment that\norganizations and their agents wrestle with the discontinuous\nnature of reality and attempt to make sense of and manage\nthe gaps between what was once known, where they are now,\nand an unpredictable future through information and knowl-\nedge sharing. The nature of this organizational \"sense mak-\ning\" process was aptly described by Dervin (1998):\nHumans, sense making assumes, live in a world of gaps: a reality\nthat changes across time and space and is at least in part \"gappy\"\nat a given time-space; a human society filled with difference\nmanifested in madness, culture, personality, inventiveness,\ntentativeness and capriciousness; a self that is sometimes\ncentered, sometimes muddled, and always becoming. In this\nview, the sense making and sense unmaking that is knowledge is\na verb, always an activity, embedded in time and space, moving\nfrom a history toward a horizon, made at the juncture between\nself and culture, society, organization. (p. 36)\nKey within this description is the notion that humans are\nnot always rational, that they live in social environments, are\ninfluenced by personality and culture, and that the state of\ntheir knowledge is always in flux. Organizations, as human\nsocial constructs, also exist within social environments, are\nrationally intended, embody norms, values and beliefs, and\nseek and use information to solve problems across time and\nspace as they strive to achieve future goals and outcomes\ning, whether at the individual or organizational level, allows\nindividuals and organizations to acquire new insights into the\nproblems at hand in new and innovative ways.\nCreating New Knowledge for Innovation in\nPolicing\nOrganizational knowledge creation and innovation is critical\nto all organizations as it is \"a continuous process through\nwhich one overcomes the individual boundaries and con-\nstraints imposed by information and past learning by acquir-\ning a new context, a new view of the world and new\n6 SAGE Open\nOrganizational knowledge creation and innovation within\norganizations are neither static nor mechanistic processes,\nbut dynamic social activities grounded within the history,\nrelationships, rules, norms, and values of the people within\nthe organization. It is for this very reason that this study was\ninterested in the qualitative responses of participants, as they\nare indeed grounded in the technical, cultural, and structural\nhistory and values of the organization and affect how infor-\nmation is used, whether new knowledge is created, and\nwhether new innovations are nurtured.\nThe application or mobilization of new knowledge and\ninnovation within organizations is traditionally done for eco-\nnomic, strategic, and operational advantage, which requires\nmaking decisions between possible courses of action. In con-\ntrast to the traditional private sector need to apply knowledge\nto enhance competitive advantage, public sector organiza-\ntions must mobilize new information and knowledge to\nenhance administrative, operational, and strategic effective-\nness and efficiencies to better adapt to the changing external\nsocial, political, and economic environments. Without an\nunderstanding of the organizational information sharing\nissues that exist at the individual officer level and become\nimpediments, police leaders will be less effective in reaching\norganizational goals and outcomes. This study aids organiza-\ntional leaders by providing richer insights into the informa-\ntion behaviors and values of their officers and how these may\npositively or negatively affect organizational performance.\nMethod\nParticipants\nOf the 212 respondents who responded to a larger survey,\n134 police officers responded to this research study question.\nDemographically, participants comprised 84% (n = 113) men\npersonnel (Constable), 44% (n = 59) were supervisors\n(Corporals, Sergeants, or Staff Sergeants), 4% (n = 6) were at\ncommand level (Inspector), and two people (1%) reported\ntheir rank as \"other.\" Reported education indicated that\napproximately one half of the respondents (49%) had some\ncollege education, 42% had completed a 4-year college or\nuniversity degree, and a small number of officers (3%) had\ncompleted a graduate degree. The remainder (6%) had com-\npleted high school/general education development.\nWithin each of the three rank/role categories, the educa-\ntion levels were reported thusly: Of line personnel, 4%\n(n = 3) completed high school/general education develop-\n4-year degree, and 3% (n = 2) had a graduate degree. Of\nsupervisors, 8% (n = 5) completed high school/general edu-\ncation development, 49% (n = 29) had \"some\" college edu-\ncation, 41% (n = 24) had a 4-year college/university degree,\nand 2% (n = 1) reported a graduate degree. Of the\nsix command personnel, 17% (n = 1) had \"some\" college\neducation, 67% (n = 4) had a 4-year college/university\ndegree, and 17% (n = 1) reported having a graduate degree.\nMaterials\nThis study analyzed responses to an open-ended question\ncontained within a larger survey questionnaire administered\nto three diverse municipal police agencies in Canada\n(Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty, 2013). The question\nasked, \"In my agency, the greatest impediment(s) to the shar-\ning of valid information and knowledge is/are . . . \"\nSampling Procedures\nPolice Chiefs of four municipal police organizations within\nCanada were sent letters of introduction, invitations to par-\nticipate in this study, and research information sheets. Three\nagencies agreed to participate in the study: one medium-\nsized independent municipal agency (MED-IND), one\nmedium-sized Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)\nmunicipal police agency (MED-RCMP), and one large-sized\nindependent municipal agency (LRG-IND). All sworn offi-\ncers within these agencies (n = 1,850) were eligible to par-\nticipate and received individual email invitations with\nweb-based survey links. Survey completion was voluntary\nand constrained by the operational needs of each organiza-\ntion within the data collection period. Therefore, participants\nwere self-selecting. Within the 4-week data collection period,\na total of 134 valid responses were received with respect to\nthis research question (MED-IND [n = 29], MED-RCMP\nAnalysis\nResponses were analyzed using inductive qualitative meth-\nods (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). This inductive approach\nallows \"research findings to emerge from the frequent, domi-\nnant, or significant themes inherent in the raw data, without\nrestraints imposed by structured methodologies\" (Thomas,\ndata-driven but were also theoretically bottom-up versus top-\ndown driven, and presented an \"accurate reflection of the\nentire data set\" (Braun & Clarke, 2006, p. 83) while allowing\na rich description of the data.\nThe survey responses were initially close read, re-read,\nand then open-coded using qualitative data analysis software\n(QDAS). NVivo 8 software was utilized to code the unstruc-\ntured textual data and develop and compare emergent themes\nand concepts between and across demographic groups\nVery few participants (7%) reported that they were\nunaware of any impediments to information and knowledge\nsharing or that no impediments to information sharing\nexisted. Most respondents were aware of information sharing\nAbrahamson and Goodman-Delahunty 7\nimpediments within their organization and were willing to\nshare their thoughts on this subject. A recursive and iterative\napproach was used in developing the themed categories. On\ncollapsing all overlapping or otherwise redundant sub-cate-\ngories, a total of seven impediment themes emerged. Two\nadditional categories were created to encapsulate responses\nindicating that there were (a) no perceived impediments to\ninformation sharing and (b) miscellaneous responses that\nwere either blank, ambiguous, or inappropriate in response\nto the question. Four responses were excluded from further\nanalyses as they did not fit any of the final categories due to\nambiguity in the participants'wording. A multi-coder system\nwas implemented to establish shared interpretative validity\nInter-rater reliability.To assess coding reliability, all open-\nended responses were dual-coded by two trained raters who\nidentified the theme(s) contained within each response.\nCohen's kappa coefficients were calculated for each category.\nThe Kappa coefficients yielded good inter-rater results, with\nagreement percentages at or above the 90% acceptable level\n(Miles & Huberman, 1994). All disparities between raters\nwere resolved by follow-up discussions to reach consensus.\nResults\nDefinitions of the seven themes or types of impediments to\ninformation sharing that were distinguished, and examples of\neach, are displayed in Table 1.\nFigure 1 displays the rounded aggregated data on seven\ntypes of impediments to sharing information and knowledge\ndistinguished by participants across all three Canadian polic-\ning agencies. The percentage of the total for each impedi-\nment and its ranking relative to the other noted impediments\nrevealed three dominant themes regarding impediments to\ninformation and knowledge sharing across the three police\nagencies: processes-technology (24%), individual unwilling-\nness (21%), and organizational unwillingness (15%).\nCollectively, these three impediments accounted for 60%\nof the barriers to information and knowledge sharing within\nthe three police organizations. Fewer participants mentioned\n\"workload-overload\" (12%), \"location-structure\" (10%),\n\"leadership\" (6%), and \"risk management\" (4%).\nA closer inspection of the seven core information and\nknowledge sharing impediments was conducted within each\nof the three participant organizations to assess what, if any,\ndifferences or similarities were present across organizations.\nThe seven perceived impediment themes were plotted in\nterms of their frequency, and as an individual organizational\nvalue, as shown in Figure 2.\nVariability between organizations was most apparent\namong the five top-ranking impediments. Accordingly, simi-\nlarities and differences between the three participating police\nagencies regarding these five impediments are briefly\nsummarized.\nTop-Ranked Impediments to Information and\nKnowledge Sharing\nProcesses and technology.Overall, \"processes-technology,\"\nwhich represents internal and external information sharing\nprocesses, systems, policies, and technologies (e.g., informa-\ntion portals, police records information management systems\nsuch as PRIME,1 email) within the organization, was identi-\nfied by many participants as the greatest single impediment to\ninformation sharing across the three police organizations. This\nbarrier was perceived to exist by more than two fifths (43%) of\nthe MED-RCMP participants, more than a quarter of the\nsworn officers (28%) employed by the LRG-IND agency, and\nabout one in five police (18%) in the MED-IND agency. In the\nlatter agency, this theme was ranked as the second most sig-\nnificant impediment to information sharing, accounting for\n16% fewer responses than the impediment characterized by\n\"individual unwillingness\" to share information.\nWhen specifying the aspect of process that created the\nimpediment, several participants blamed organizational\nincentives for individual merit as opposed to teamwork: \" . . .\na promotional system which embraces singular deeds thereby\nleading to information hoarding and stealing\" (LRG-IND,\nsupervisor). Another police supervisor stated,\nIseethisprimarilyasanissueinvolvingtheartofcommunication.\nAs long as we hire/employ human beings and not machines, we\nare at the mercy of those who wish to hoard information and not\nshare same. We can establish a myriad of systems to disseminate\ninformation/facts, unless the will is there to share it, to ensure it\nis broadcasted, we will continue to struggle with this. (MED-\nRCMP, supervisor)\nBoth comments reflect the often-discussed but often-\nneglected need to address the social aspect of information\nsharing and the formal and informal organizational reward\nsystems that exist within organizations creating incentives\nand disincentives to share information (Bartol & Srivastava,\nParticipants from independent and national police agen-\ncies suggested that technology policies and systems were the\nprimary impediments: \"Our information technology section\nand their overly restrictive policies\" (LRG-IND, supervisor)\nand \"Various systems that do not talk to one another through\nportals. Various levels of encryption that one agency would\nfollow but not another\" (MED-RCMP, supervisor).\nIndividual unwillingness. The impediment ranked as the sec-\nond most significant barrier to information sharing was\n\"individual unwillingness,\" or a reluctance to share due to\npersonal attitudes, values, beliefs, and/or actions. In two of\nthe three organizations, the LRG-IND agency and the\nMED-RCMP agency, one in five participants perceived\nthis as a problem, but in the MED-IND agency, the fre-\nquency was one in three (34%), substantially more than\n\"process-technology.\"\n8 SAGE Open\nComments made by several officers captured the larger\nissue: \" . . . empire building can protect and help many offi-\ncers achieve their personal goals\" (MED-IND, line officer);\n\"Individuals keeping information to themselves to act upon\nthemselves\" (MED-IND, line officer); \" . . . to beat out\neveryone else\" (LRG-IND, line officer); and \"Holding\ninformation gives me the `hero' factor. Meaning I will be the\nofficer writing the warrant and getting the credit\" (LRG-\nIND, line officer). These responses reflected rational self-\ninterest, marked by an emphasis on personal goals versus\ncollective priorities and interests, and influenced by their\nagency's unique social and organizational context. Such\nindividual values and behaviors are not conducive to infor-\nmation and knowledge sharing.\nThe issue of real or perceived competition between indi-\nviduals was further illustrated by the comments by several\nofficers: \" . . . internal competition and information hoard-\ning\" (MED-IND, line officer), \"Officer hoarding of informa-\ntion and empire building\" (LRG-IND, supervisor), and \"The\nindividual silos of information and competition between\nunits\" (MED-IND, command officer).\nThe degree to which this type of behavior was condoned\nand/or rewarded within these organizations was of interest,\nbecause individual unwillingness behaviors are contrary to\nthe fundamental policing goals of information sharing, inter-\noperability, and achievement of organizational goals. Logic\ndictates that at some point, individual unwillingness will\nbecome organizational unwillingness if left unchecked,\nbecause organizational culture is essentially a shared view\nTable 1.

Results showed that this impediment was perceived as\nmore common in the LRG-IND agency (16%) and the MED-\nIND agency (15%) than in the MED-RCMP agency (10%).\nCompetition within a unit and/or department for notori-\nety, resources, or public recognition was shown in several\ncomments: \"The individual silos of information and compe-\ntition between units\" (MED-IND, command officer);\n\"Boundaries between outside agencies . . . unwilling to share\ninformation because they are competitive and seeking glory\nwithin public perception\" (MED-IND, line officer); and\n\"There is a sense that knowledge is power, and many do not\nwant to relinquish power. They are not special if others have\nthe info. From the executive level, there is a sense of `we\ncan't share info with the membership, the minions would not\nunderstand'\" (LRG-IND, line officer).\nA recent study conducted by the RCMP examined police\ninformation sharing practices in Canada. Findings indicated\nthat police relied heavily on personal interactions, relation-\nships, and trust-based information transactions when dealing\nwith sensitive information; that police trusted, overall, the\nsecurity of the technology systems that are in place; that out-\nside access to individual agency information databanks was\nvery limited; and that a large portion of the sharing was built\non \"personal initiative or judgement\" and not on purely\n\"secure and systemic\" information sharing protocols (LeBeuf\npants in the current study generally supported these findings,\nparticularly those statements that related to limited access to\noutside agency databanks, information sharing was based on\ntrust, and that systemic information sharing protocols are\nrequired.\nWorkload-information overload.The role that IT plays in\nthe facilitation of the storage, retrieval, and dissemination\nof information and knowledge within the organization is\nan important one. However, one of the unintended conse-\nquences of that automation and re-arrangement of informa-\ntion flows is an overabundance of information and a need for\nthe individual recipient to sort out what is important, what\ncan wait, and what can be ignored. This overabundance of\ninformation, coupled with the need to sort and evaluate each\nnew item of information for relevancy, creates an increased\nworkload and/or overload for end-users of this automation. A\nfourth impediment identified by participants was \"workload-\ninformation overload.\" This impediment was perceived as a\nbarrier to information sharing to a similar and more extensive\ndegree by the MED-IND agency (16%) and the MED-RCMP\nagency (15%), whereas workload-information overload was\nnot perceived as a significant barrier to information and\nknowledge sharing in the LRG-IND agency (2%). Supervi-\nsors and line officers alike experienced this pressure: \" . . .\ntime constraints, I don't have time in the day in order to\nproperly disseminate all the information\" (RCMP, supervi-\nsor); \" . . . sharing information or knowledge often results in\nmore work\" (RCMP, supervisor); \" . . . information overload\nthrough too many mediums\" (LRG-IND, supervisor); and\n\"Time is a large factor, people are too busy. Motivation is\nanother due to workloads and limited time\" (MED-IND, line\nofficer). All of these officers felt overloaded by information\nand compelled to \"do something\" with information that they\nacquired, whether it was to assess its worth, disseminate it,\nrecord it, and/or take action.\nFigure 2. Perceived impediments to information sharing by police agency.\nThe foregoing examples disclosed an issue of absorptive\ncapacity at the individual and collective organizational lev-\nels.Absorptive capacity was defined by Cohen and Levinthal\n(1990) as the ability to fully value, assimilate, and apply\nnew knowledge. Unless sufficient time and/or resources are\ndedicated to mitigating information and work overload,\nmuch information will be lost, overlooked, and/or ignored\nto the detriment of the organization and the achievement of\ntarget goals and outcomes. More importantly, the increased\nworkload caused by the massive influx of information\ndefeats the information sharing goal by creating disincen-\ntives for officers to use and contribute to the information\nsystems and information flow. Because of this potential for\nbacklash, it is important that organizations develop appro-\npriate structures that facilitate and do not hinder the flow of\ncommunication between individuals, groups, units, and/or\norganizations.\nLocation-structure. The fifth impediment mentioned by a sub-\nstantial proportion of participants was \"location-structure,\"\nwhich related to the way the organization is internally struc-\ntured or generally located in the applicable policing area or\nregion. This was perceived as more of an issue by partici-\npants from the LRG-IND agency (14%) and the MED-IND\nagency (13%), whereas fewer participants in the MED-\nRCMP agency (8%) cited this factor as an impediment. The\nfollowing comments illustrated this information sharing\nimpediment succinctly: \"The compartmentalization nature\nof policing\" (MED-IND, line officer); \"Too large a service\nand too spread out throughout the city to spread the informa-\ntion throughout. Too many specialty units that are too spe-\ncialized and retain their information because they are\nsegregated from the rest of the service\" (LRG-IND, line offi-\ncer); and \" . . . too many different police agencies in a very\nsmall geographic area\" (MED-IND, supervisor).\nEach of the foregoing comments identified the presence\nof information \"silos,\" which may be vertical within or hori-\nzontal between units, sections, or agencies. This lack of com-\nmunication and information sharing within and across\norganizations is aggravated by the location and structure of\norganizational units, different roles and responsibilities,\naccountabilities, budgets, and boundaries. Traditional\nbureaucratically focused hierarchies do not always lend\nthemselves to substantive information sharing due to policies\nand boundaries, however, there has been a greater recogni-\ntion of the need for and value of increased informal contact\nwith peers and colleagues and the development of collabora-\ntive network structures in the transferring of knowledge\nwithin and across organizations (Agranoff & McGuire,\n2004). A key role of leaders and managers in creating oppor-\ntunities for knowledge sharing and integration within and\nacross organizations is to eliminate or reduce barriers that\nproduce physical or psychological distance (Argote,\nTwo additional impediments to information and knowl-\nedge sharing that emerged in the responses from participants\nwere \"leadership\" (lack thereof) and \"risk management.\"\nLeadership.Leadership within organizations, positively or\nnegatively, drives the values, behaviors, commitment, and\ncooperation of employees toward the achievement of a com-\nmon goal. Relative to the other two agencies, the LRG-IND\nagency stood out as more than 1 in 10 (13%) of the partici-\npants perceived that a lack of direction, feedback, or support\nby the senior management or executive management team\nwas problematic. Illustrative of the perception that the lack\nof leadership or management support were impediments\nwere these responses by officers: \"Management failure to\ntake appropriate action unless the issue is topical, sexy or in\ntheir individual political interest\" (LRG-IND, supervisor);\n\" . . . lack of organization and direction. Confusion based on\nwho does what and what goes where due to a system top\nheavy in bureaucracy\" (RCMP, supervisor); and \"lack of rec-\nognition\" (LRG-IND, supervisor). In each of these instances,\nthe impediments to information and knowledge sharing can\nbe significantly addressed through the leadership function,\nwhether at the supervisory or at the senior management level.\nIn comparison, participants employed by the MED-RCMP\nagency and the MED-IND agency perceived that leadership\nissues with respect to information and knowledge sharing\nwere minimal or non-existent (3% and 0%, respectively).\nRisk management. The final impediment identified was \"risk\nmanagement,\" suggesting that information and knowledge\nsharing was hindered by the overarching need for organiza-\ntional or investigative level information and knowledge risk\nmanagement. This issue was slightly more predominant\nwithin the LRG-IND agency (5%) than the MED-IND\nagency (2%) and was perceived as a non-issue within the\nMED-RCMP agency (0%).\nTwo issues of significance to policing were encompassed\nby this theme: maintaining investigative integrity and limit-\ning agency liability in relation to lawsuits. Although there\nwere comparatively few responses within this category, the\nresponses reflected these concerns: \"loose lips sink ships, if\nyou have an important investigation, only want the investi-\ngating officers to know in order to complete invest without\nhiccups\" (LRG-IND, line officer); \"may jeopardize a case\"\n(LRG-IND, line officer); and \" . . . fear that the information\nmay get in the wrong hands\" (LRG-IND, supervisor). Police\nmust, for legal and operational reasons, protect sensitive\ninvestigative information and data from being inappropri-\nately collected, accessed, disclosed, copied, or destroyed. It\nis within this legal and operational framework that police\nmust carefully consider, develop, and/or comply with data\nsharing protocols to effectively work within the community-\npolicing, intelligence-led, problem-oriented, or Compstat-\nbased policing models.\nAbrahamson and Goodman-Delahunty 11\nWithin this policing context, it was unsurprising that this\ntheme emerged, but what was surprising was how infre-\nquently this issue was identified as an impediment to infor-\nmation and knowledge sharing within these three agencies,\npossibly because this issue has been adequately addressed\nthrough each of the agency's policies, procedures, and\nculture.\nConnecting Impediments to KM Infrastructures\nTo conceptualize and illustrate the connection between the\nseven perceived information and knowledge impediments\nand the three major organizational KM infrastructures, a dia-\ngram was created using NVivo 8 software analysis. The three\norganizational KM structures of technology, structure, and\nculture are depicted in Figure 3.\nThis diagram revealed a clear pattern in these data\nindicating, overall, that in this sample, the perceived\nimpediments to sharing information and knowledge fell\nwell-within the KM technical, cultural, and structural\ninfrastructure components of the three participating orga-\nnizations. Some overlap was observed on issues that had\na technical and a structural component (e.g., email over-\nload). Consideration of the themes in light of these three\ninfrastructures identified that although \"processes-tech-\nnology\" was rated overall as the single highest ranking\nimpediment to sharing across the three organizations\n(Figure 1), the three most substantial infrastructure\nimpediments to information sharing were \"organizational\nstructure\" (39%; n = 88) followed by \"organizational cul-\nDiscussion\nSimilarities Between KM in Policing and Other\nOrganizations\nA recent study of obstacles to KM and information sharing\nyielded a ranked list of the top 10 organizational impedi-\nments (Croteau & Dfouni, 2008). Although the rankings dif-\nfered, six of the seven impediments identified within the\ncurrent study appeared on that list, namely, processes and\ntechnology, individual unwillingness, organizational unwill-\ningness, workload-overload, location and structure, and lack\nof leadership. A comparison of the findings is summarized in\nThis corroboration provided further validation of out-\ncomes of the thematic coding conducted in this study and\nthat there are commonalities between non-policing agencies\nand police agency/organizations on this issue.\nOrganizational Context and Impact on\nInformation Behavior\nAnalysis of the perceived impediments to information and\nknowledge sharing at the organizational level (Figure 2)\nrevealed unique differences between the three Canadian\npolicing agencies in terms of the magnitude and rankings of\nthe impediments. These organizational differences under-\nscored the importance of context as a moderating factor\nwhen examining extant KM practices within organizations.\nFor example, in their review of organizational information\nenvironments, Detlor et al. (2006) suggested that an organi-\nzation's technology systems, politics, and culture\nFigure 3. Relationship between impediments and organizational infrastructure.\n. . . constrain and shape the degree to which people in\norganizations can access, create, share, find, browse, create and\nuse information. That is, an organization's information\nenvironment has a direct effect on both employee and\norganizational information behavior. (p. 119)\nThis impact of culture on organizational context was\nBy defining the context for interaction, culture determines how\nall types of knowledge will be used in a particular situation. It\ndoes this primarily by dictating the norms--the rules,\nexpectations, and penalties--that govern social interactions\nbetween individuals and groups, and by shaping people's\nperceptions of their range of options acceptable to the\nThe findings in the current study demonstrated how varia-\ntions in organizational culture, structure, and technology can\naffect the successful integration of information and knowl-\nedge sharing within the three police organizations. These\nfindings were further substantiated in quantitative analyses\nof additional data gathered regarding these organizations\n(Abrahamson & Goodman-Delahunty,2013) demonstrating\nthat information quality control and proactive collaboration\naccounted for 71% of the variance in a police organization's\nability to attain specific information use outcomes.\nLimitations of the Study\nThis research highlighted important organizational informa-\ntion and knowledge sharing issues and impediments within\nthree police organizations. However, these perceptions were\nnot necessarily representative of the larger police population\ndue to sample size and the tactical versus strategic focus of\nthe research question. Despite the limited samples, remark-\nable consistencies and consensus emerged across these three\norganizations with respect to the nature of the perceived\nimpediments to information and knowledge sharing and the\nrelative frequency or importance of each of these impedi-\nments (Figure 2). These outcomes indicated diffuse\ninformant reliability. Follow-up studies, conducted at the\ntactical and strategic levels of the organization that include\ncivilian and sworn police personnel and intelligence special-\nists, will be required to corroborate or otherwise validate the\nperceptions reported in this study by rank and file officers\nwithin three Canadian police organization.\nPolicy and Practice Implications\nThis study isolated some of the information and knowledge\nsharing barriers facing North American police organizations\nat this point in their history and provided insights into the\nsometimes fickle foundation on which all contemporary\npolicing is based: information and knowledge sharing. The\nrank and file groups sampled form the bulk of personnel in\nevery police organization and, therefore, exert a direct and\nindirect influence on all operations within those organiza-\ntions and the achievement of any and all goals and outcomes\nwithin the organization. In light of recent public sector\nreforms to improve accountability, efficiency, and effective-\nness, it is surprising that little time has been devoted to\nunderstanding this important, relevant, and influential group\nin terms of their ability to support or impede organizational\ndecisions, actions, and outcomes through information and\nknowledge sharing.\nSingularly, the three most significant discrete impedi-\nments to information and knowledge sharing within all three\npolice organizations were processes and technology, indi-\nvidual unwillingness, and organizational unwillingness.\nCollectively, when specific impediments identified were\ngrouped within their associated organizational KM infra-\nstructures, the relative order of the issues changed. Most per-\nceived impediments were aspects of organizational structure\nand organizational culture, not processes and technology.\nWithin the core information and knowledge sharing\nimpediments, a number of critical sub-themes emerged that\nhave implications for police policy and practice. Specifically,\nthese sub-themes identified negative consequences of infor-\nmation silos, information hoarding, internal/external compe-\ntition, personal versus collective goals, lack of absorptive\nTable 2.

The practical implications of these issues on police\norganizations cannot be underestimated. Table 3 itemizes\nthe organizational consequences of the presence of these\nimpediments.\nIn addition, no matter which individual model or combi-\nnation of policing models each of the three participating\npolice agencies may ascribe (e.g., community-policing,\nproblem-oriented policing, intelligence-led policing, evi-\ndence-based policing, reactive and/or proactive policing),\neach of the impediments identified above conflict directly or\nindirectly with contemporary police models either culturally,\ntechnically, and/or structurally. For instance, a description of\nthe community policing partnership element as provided by\nthe Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS; 2009)\nstates that,\nCommunity policing, recognizing that police rarely can solve\npublicsafetyproblemsalone,encouragesinteractivepartnerships\nwith relevant stakeholders. The range of potential partners is\nlarge and these partnerships can be used to accomplish the two\ninterrelated goals of developing solutions to problems through\ncollaborative problem solving and improving public trust. (p. 5)\nUsing the impediments listed in Table 3 as a point of\ndeparture, we see that the \"interactive partnerships,\" \"col-\nlaborative problem-solving,\" and \"improving public trust\"\nelements of community policing cannot be truly realized\nwithin a policing environment that is characterized by inter-\nnal processes that impede information sharing, individual or\norganizational unwillingness to share information or\nknowledge, or lack of trust among others. Similarly, the\nIntelligence-led policing model would be hampered by these\nsame information and knowledge sharing impediments.\nThe Intelligence-led policing model has developed sig-\nnificantly over the past decade and is now conceptualized as\nan integral part of the community-oriented policing and\nproblem-solving process, as was noted in a U.S. Department\nof Justice report on intelligence-led policing:\nIntelligence-led policing is a collaborative enterprise based on\nimproved intelligence operations and community-oriented\npolicing and problem solving, which the field has considered\nbeneficial for many considered beneficial for many years. To\nimplement intelligence-led policing, police organizations need to\nre-evaluate their current policies and protocols. Intelligence must\nbe incorporated into the planning process to reflect community\nproblems and issues. Information sharing must become a policy,\nnot an informal practice. (Peterson, 2005, p. vii)\nOnce again, using Table 3 as reference, we see that any or\nall of the negative information and knowledge sharing behav-\niors, values, and processes described by the sworn officers\nwithin the three participating agencies would inhibit police\norganizations' ability to effectively implement the intelli-\ngence-led policing model. At the core of the intelligence-led\npolicing model is \"collaboration\" and \"information sharing.\"\nIt is within this context that \"information silos,\" poorly\ndesigned \"processes and technology,\" and/or \"lack of absorp-\ntive capacity,\" for example, fail to philosophically or practi-\ncally support the intelligence-led policing model.\nA review of the responses of the sworn officers from each\nof the three policing organizations revealed that police\nTable 3.

Many of the issues identified by the partici-\npants in this study are indeed rooted in lack of governance/\nleadership, management, and/or effective learning. For the\nsake of illustration, only a few of the many available exam-\nples are cited: processes and technology (lack of leadership\nand management), individual unwillingness (lack of leader-\nship, management, effective learning), presence of disincen-\ntives (lack of leadership, management, learning), and lack of\ntrust (lack of leadership, management, learning). Despite the\npresence of a number of dysfunctional or otherwise maladap-\ntive behaviors within these three police organizations, these\nissues are not irreconcilable. Therefore, possible avenues for\npolicy and practice improvement are provided.\nConclusion\nEach of the impediments identified represents an opportunity\nfor each organization to review and reflect on its current\ninformation/knowledge sharing policies, practices, as well as\nthe culture and context in which these issues arose. Although\nthere is no prescriptive answer to solve all of the informa-\ntion/sharing dilemmas within organizations, a number of\noptions are available to mitigate the impediments by improv-\ning coordination mechanisms and the context in which shar-\ning occurs. These options include, but are not limited to,\nimprove organizational identity and connectedness (Kogut &\nZander, 1996), align organizational culture with information\nand knowledge sharing goals and needs (De Long & Fahey,\n2000), develop information and knowledge sharing values\n(Nonaka, 1994), create incentives for information and\nknowledge sharing (Hung, Durcikova, Lai, & Lin, 2011),\npromote boundary spanning (Tushman & Scanlan, 1981),\ncontrol information overload (Savolainen, 2007), and\nimprove levels of trust within and across units, sections, and\nSuch remediation efforts, however, fail to address one last\nissue: paradoxes.\nEarlier in our discussion of dialectics and its relation to\norganizational learning, we proffered seven paradoxes:\nsecure and open, structured and flexible, individual and\ngroup, conformity and diversity, innovation and stability,\ncertainty and risk, and loose and connected. Each of these\nare germane to information and knowledge sharing within\nNorth American policing as they represent potential sticking\npoints for polarized debate on issues that are actually inter-\ndependent and inter-penetrating (Takeuchi & Nonaka,\n2004). Simplifying the dialectic stages of thesis, antithesis,\nand synthesis, each of the paradoxes presented essentially\ncreate tensions between the two apparently opposing posi-\ntions, which would necessitate discussion and debate within\nthe respective police organization. This eventual debate\nwould create a dynamic that incorporates aspects of the the-\nsis (the first idea or position) and the antithesis (the second\nidea or position), thus forming the synthesis or resolution,\nwhich reveal themselves as new perspectives, patterns, atti-\ntudes, or structures. This synthesis process is a learning pro-\ncess. Thus, the paradox of secure and open suggests that\nwithin the thesis of secure and the antithesis of open, there\nis room for synthesis, where aspects of both concepts are\npresent while yet creating an opportunity for a new perspec-\ntive, attitude, or structure. The same is true for each of the\nsix other paradoxes.\nThe foregoing insights into the information and knowl-\nedge sharing barriers faced by the rank and file officers\nwithin the participating agencies and the concepts of dialec-\ntics and paradox will enable police leaders to better under-\nstand the needs of their respective organizations and officers,\nand better appreciate that information and knowledge shar-\ning cannot simply be accomplished through technology\nalone. A more reflective, systematic, and engaged KM and\nuse approach that recognizes the linkage between the techni-\ncal, cultural, and structural infrastructures must be under-\ntaken so that police organizations may achieve the goals\nplaced before them.\n"
