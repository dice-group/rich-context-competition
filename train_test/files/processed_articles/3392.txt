The diagnostic and prognostic value of serum miR-143 was evaluated.\nResults: Serum miR-143 levels were significantly higher in patients with sepsis (n \u00bc 103) than\npatients with SIRS (n \u00bc 95) and healthy controls (n \u00bc 40). There were significant positive\ncorrelations between serum miR-143 level and SOFA and APACHE II scores in patients with\nspecificity of 91.6% for distinguishing between sepsis and SIRS. There was no association between\nserum miR-143 and 28-day survival in patients with sepsis.\nConclusion: Serum miR-143 is elevated in patients with sepsis, and may be a useful biomarker for\ndistinguishing between sepsis and SIRS.\n",

The aim of the\npresent study, therefore, was to evaluate\nserum miR-143 levels in patients with sepsis\nor non-infectious SIRS, and investigate its\npossible diagnostic or prognostic value.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited patients with sepsis or\nSIRS undergoing treatment at the\nDepartment of Critical Care Medicine,\nCangzhou Central Hospital, Cangzhou,\nHebei Province, China, between January\ndiagnosed on the basis of blood microbio-\nlogical culture results, according to the\ndefinitions of the American College of\nChest Physicians/Society of Critical Care\nMedicine.19 Inclusion criteria were: two or\n(ii) heart rate > 90/min; (iii) respiratory rate-\n< 32 mmHg; (iv) white\nor > 10 % immature (band) forms. Patients\naged younger than 18 years or who could\nnot receive adequate treatment due to eco-\nnomic hardship were excluded. In patients\nwith sepsis, disease severity was assessed via\nSOFA (sepsis-related organ failure assess-\nday 1 after ICU admission, and all patients\nwere followed-up for 28 days A control\ngroup of healthy volunteer subjects with no\nknown medical condition or infection at\nthe time of the study were recruited from the\nHealth Screening Centre, Cangzhou Central\nHospital, Cangzhou, Hebei Province,\nChina.\nThe study was approved by the research\nethics committee of Cangzhou Central\nHospital, and all subjects provided written\ninformed consent.\nBlood samples (5 ml) were obtained at the\ntime of initial blood microbiological culture\nin patients, and at the time of health\nscreening in the control subjects. Blood\nroom temperature immediately after collec-\ntion to completely remove cell debris, then\ntransferred to RNase/DNase-free tubes and\nstored at \u00c080C until further processing.\nSerum total RNA was extracted using\nTRIzol solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\nUSA) according to manufacturer's instruc-\ntions, and cDNA was synthesized using a\nOne Step Prime-Script miRNA cDNA\nSynthesis Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan).\nReal-time quantitative PCR (RT\u00adqPCR) was\nperformed using a SYBR Prime-Script\nmiRNA qPCR Kit (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga,\nDetection System (Applied Biosystems,\nFoster City, CA, USA). Cycling conditions\nreactions were performed in triplicate, and\nU6 snRNA was used as an internal control.\nExpression levels of miR-143 were calculated\nrelative to U6 mRNA using the equation\n2\u00c0\u00c1CT, where \u00c1CT \u00bc (CT\nCRP and PCT assays\nSerum C-reactive protein (CRP) was quanti-\nfied via scattering turbidimetry (CardioPhase\nhsCRP, Siemens, Munich, Germany), and\nprocalcitonin (PCT) was quantified using\nan enzyme-linked fluorescence analysis kit\n(VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S. PCT kit, bioMerieux\nSA, Marcy l'Etoile, France), according to the\nmanufacturers' instructions.\nStatistical analyses\nSample size was calculated using the\nformula N \u00bc (Ua\n/d)2 \u00c2 (1\u00adP) \u00c2 P, assuming\nan estimated sensitivity of 80% and specifi-\ncity of 90% for the validity of serum miR-\n143 as a biomarker for discriminating\nbetween sepsis and SIRS. We set a \u00bc 0.05,\nand d \u00bc 0.08. Accordingly, the minimum\nsample size was 96 for the sepsis group and\n54 for the SIRS group.\nData were expressed as mean \u00c6 SD or\nmedian (range). Differences in serum miR-\n143 levels were analysed using unpaired\nStudent's t test (between two groups) or\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA;\nbetween three groups). Pearson's correlation\nanalysis was used to analyse the relationship\nbetween serum miR-143 levels and clinical\nscores. Receiver-operating characteristic\n(ROC) curves were used to assess the\ndiagnostic value of serum miR-143\nlevels for sepsis vs SIRS, and the area\nunder curve (AUC) was calculated.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 16.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5, and P-values < 0.05\nwere considered statistically significant.\nResults\nThe study included 103 patients with sepsis\nwith SIRS (65 males/30 females; mean age\nrange 22\u00ad65 years). Demographic and clin-\nical characteristics of the study groups are\nshown in Table 1. Patients with sepsis had\nsignificantly higher serum CRP and PCT\nconcentrations, and spent significantly\nlonger in the ICU than patients with SIRS\n(P < 0.01 for each comparison; Table 1).\nSerum miR-143 levels were significantly\nhigher in patients with SIRS or sepsis than\ncontrols (P < 0.01), and in patients with\nData regarding miR-143 expression levels\nin patients with sepsis are shown in Figure 1.\nPatients with high SOFA scores (!7) or\nAPACHE II scores (! 10) had significantly\nhigher serum miR-143 levels than those with\nlow SOFA (< 7) or APACHE II scores\nrespectively; Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b)).\nThere was no significant difference in serum\nmiR-143 levels between those patients who\ndied and those who survived (at 28 days;\nFigure 1(c)).

More importantly, miR-143\nlevels could distinguish between sepsis and\nSIRS. High levels of miR-143 were posi-\ntively correlated with SOFA and APACHE\nII scores. To our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to analyse serum miR-143 levels and\ntheir diagnostic value in sepsis.\nThere is a known association between\nshown to regulate the anti-inflammatory\neffect of mesenchymal stem cells and may\ntherefore be a potential therapeutic target.25\nFunctional studies of miR-143 have largely\nfocused on its role in carcinogenesis and\ncancer progression, and little is known\nabout its effect on the immune response.\nIt is therefore important to identify more\nmiR-143 target genes in order to clarify its\nrole in immunoregulation.\nThe present study has several limitations,\nincluding the retrospective design and rela-\ntively small sample size. In addition, we did\nnot evaluate the source or mechanism(s) of\naction of miR-143 during sepsis, nor whether\na combination of miR-143 and other bio-\nmarkers might be more practical in the\ndifferential diagnosis of sepsis and SIRS.\nIn conclusion, serum miR-143 is elevated\nin patients with sepsis, and may be a useful\nbiomarker for distinguishing between sepsis\nFigure 2.
