Most states have a mandate that\nrequires teacher candidates to take one or more prescribed\nmulticultural courses before certification is granted. But,\nteaching diversity at the college level can be tricky. This is\ndue in part because there are definition problems, process\nand methodology issues, higher levels of emotions, self-\nesteem issues, opinions, religious and cultural differences,\nand politics that must be traversed compared with other\nconfusion is the fact that Barack Obama, a Black man, was\nelected in 2008 to the Presidency of the United States and\nreelected again in 2012.

Minorities and liberals, however, use\nthe July 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman for the death\nof Trayvon Martin as evidence that we are far from reaching\noptimal results.\nNavigating the mine-laden field of multicultural instruc-\ntion can be mentally and physically exhausting.

Effective teachers are not only theoreti-\ncally sound and challenging; they also find ways to include\nstudents as partners (Zeichner et al., 2001). Effective teach-\ning must start from the students' life experiences, not the\nteacher's perspective (Gollnick & Chinn, 2013).\nDuring the few times when a student voice is offered, it\nmostly comes from a primary and secondary education per-\nspective. Gollnick and Chinn (2013), for example, offer\nthese findings: Graduating high school students wanted their\nteachers to (a) be passionate about their work, (b) connect\ninstruction to issues they care about outside of school, (c)\ngive students choices when it comes to problem-solving\nactivities, and (d) make learning more than just an academic,\ncerebral affair. Many high school minority students emotion-\nally drop out of school because their voices and experiences\nare silenced or ignored.\nResearch that studies student opinion about multicultural\neducation at the college level is sparse. Rudney and Marxen\ncation program and identified the following correlates of\ngood multicultural instruction: (a) adequate attention must\nbe given to learning style differences, (b) emphasize on\ncross-cultural communication skills, (c) expose students to a\nvariety of curriculum approaches, (d) promote the articula-\ntion of multicultural goals in all courses and not just in stand-\nalone offerings, (e) provide mandatory field placements in\ndiverse settings, and (f) provide additional immersion oppor-\ntunities (e.g., visits to social service agencies, ethnic\nchurches, parades, etc.).\nAnderson et al. (2000) surveyed current and former col-\nlege students and summarized the following instructional\ncorrelates: (a) dynamic and thought-provoking lectures and\ndiscussions, (b) exposing students to facts and statistics that\nhelp address missing gaps, (c) readings and homework that\nforce students to compare and contrast different theories, (d)\nreflective exercises and self-exploration activities, (e) simu-\nlation games, (f) collaborative research projects, (g) persua-\nsive guest speakers, and (h) a diverse class composition.\nOutside of these two (and perhaps a few more) hard-to-find\nstudies, there is little written about the multicultural views of\ncollege students. My study hopes to fill a portion of that gap.\nBest Practices\nThe literature is replete with macro suggestions of what\nmakes for good multicultural education. Most of it is from a\ntheory, program, or political point of view, however.\nConversely, there is not enough in the literature that addresses\n(a) missing gaps, (b) the art of multicultural curriculum\ndelivery, and (c) how to deal with learner resistance.\nJames Banks (2009) offers foundational perspectives for\nmulticultural teacher training. The following is a paraphrase\nof those suggestions:\n 1. Aperson's cultural identity can and should be defined\nby more than just racial and ethnic factors. There are\nmany components of cultural identity (pp. 15-16);\n2. Because of our country's history, the study of racism\ndeserves to have its day in the sun without being\nwatered down. Still, we must also acknowledge that\nthe true study of multiculturalism goes beyond mere\n3. The ethnic experience cannot fully be understood apart\nfrom a nation's struggle for power. The abuse of power\nand privilege has as much to do with explaining racism\nas does skin color, culture, and beliefs (pp. 78-80);\n4. While it is important to discuss global education, it\nshould not be confused with multicultural education.\nWhile the former deals with interrelationships\nbetween nations, the latter deals with the interaction\n5. The purpose of multicultural education is not to dimin-\nish the accomplishments of European culture, but\nrather to highlight the contributions of non-western\nand indigenous peoples. The accomplishments ofALL\nethnic groups, whites included, should be celebrated\n6. Sometimes it is better to teach multiculturalism from\na theme base, as opposed to a specific event. For\nexample, teaching about discrimination while using\nexamples such as slavery, the Trail of Tears, and the\nHolocaust sends a stronger universal message about\nhumankind's inhumanity towards one another than\njust highlighting only one of those topics (pp. 92-94);\nThompson 3\n 7. We must learn to investigate an event from multiple\nangles. The causes of WWI, for example, may be\nviewed quite differently by Europeans, as compared\nto that of populations from the Mideast. We should\nteach a wide range of perspectives, then allow stu-\ndents an opportunity to make up their own minds\n8. Ethnic studies must be conducted from an interdisci-\nplinary perspective. A study of diversity utilizing\nonly traditional inputs such as history, literature, and\nmusic will leave out important pieces of information\nthat could help students see a bigger and more com-\n9. Teachers must understand the various levels of cur-\nriculum delivery. For example, the contributions\napproach focuses on low-level learning such as\nheroes and holidays. The additive approach adds to\nthe curriculum without changing its structure. The\ntransformative approach identifies missing pieces,\nwhile also creating new ways of viewing and defin-\ning truth. Unfortunately, too many diversity instruc-\ntors teach at the two lower levels without promoting\nhigher-order thinking skills (pp. 18-22);\n10. It is not enough to just arm students with knowledge.\nEducators must provide opportunities for social\naction aimed at bettering society (p. 105); and\n11. The teaching of race identity development theory\ngreatly enhances minority self-awareness. It helps\nteachers understand why some minority students\nresist instruction. It also provides educators with a\npath for how to engage and encourage resistant learn-\nSonia Nieto and Patty Bode (2012) suggest a critical ped-\nagogy approach to multicultural education--curriculum that\nseeks to reinvent the rules of how we live. The importance of\nnot watering down racism, elevating the study of multicul-\ntural education to the level of other academic subjects, and\nthe infusion of multicultural goals into all course offerings is\nhighly recommended. Effective multicultural education is\nseen as instruction that leads to (a) social justice, (b) student\nreflection, (c) an equal emphasis on content and process, and\n(d) the acquisition of problem-solving skills.\nSleeter and Grant (2009) describe five approaches that\ncurriculum specialists and school officials rely on when set-\nting up a program of study: (a) teaching the culturally differ-\nent, (b) human relations approach, (c) single studies, (d)\nmulticultural education, and (e) social justice education.\nEach approach has its strengths and weaknesses, but any of\nthe choices is better than the business-as-usual paradigm that\nis still popular in many academic circles.\nAlthough John Farley (2010) writes from a sociological\nperspective, educators can learn a lot from his analysis of the\nrole that ego defense mechanisms play in resisting multicul-\ntural messages. For example, some individuals may choose\nto hate Jews as a way of displacing their own personal\nand business failures. Other unconscious mental games that\npeople play include the following paraphrased Farley\nexamples:\n1. If I can prove that I am a good person on the individ-\nual-to-individual level, then that gives me permission\nto ignore disparities that exist at the group level.\nFurthermore, if one of the \"good minorities\" made it\nout of the ghetto but others fail to do the same, I can\nsafely assume that it is because they didn't apply\n2. If Koreans and Japanese come over to America and\nsucceed despite the odds stacked against them and\nMexicans, African Americans and Indians don't do\nthe same, it's because the latter groups are lazy [i.e.,\na general problem of not understanding the differ-\nences between colonized and immigrant minority\nThe many connections between multicultural resistance\nand ego defense mechanisms constitute a fascinating field of\nstudy that is vastly overlooked by multicultural instructors.\nA Call for Dispositions\nThe practice of assessing the dispositions of pre-service edu-\ncators has gained increasing attention among institutions of\nhigher learning. Teacher dispositions strongly influence the\nimpact educators have on student development (Collinson,\nTeacher preparation programs must help candidates develop\nthe necessary dispositions to be effective educators (Rike &\nSharp, 2008). Unless teachers are willing to explore beyond\nthe familiar comfort zone of the majority culture, the educa-\ntion of students of color will be shortchanged (Dee & Henkin,\n2002). Training for greater multicultural awareness is an\noften-overlooked part of teacher preparation (Gay, 2003;\nThe term dispositions has been used in so many different\ncontexts that finding a working definition is hard to come by\n(Borko, Liston, & Whitcomb, 2007). For purposes of this\nstudy, the following Gollnick and Chinn (2013) definition will\nbe used: Dispositions are \"Values, commitments, and profes-\nsional ethics that influence teaching and interactions with stu-\ndents, families, colleagues, and communities\" (p. 379).\nThe movement toward greater professionalization of\nteaching through assessment-based accreditation was spear-\nheaded by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher\nEducation (NCATE; 2008) as a way to determine whether a\nperson was the right match for the classroom, thus the rein-\nforcement of dispositions. This study is grounded in that rec-\nommendation. I concur with NCATE officials that the\ntraining of teacher candidates in the areas of skill and knowl-\nedge without the added inclusion of exploring mind-sets that\n4 SAGE Open\nenhance student learning results in incomplete teacher prepa-\nration. It is important to note that the call for dispositions by\nNCATE is at the overall professional level (Standard 1), as\nwell as a need for teachers to become proficient in diversity\nissues (Standard 4; NCATE, 2008). From this perspective,\nthe usage of dispositions becomes a best practice that I incor-\nporate into my teaching.\nDispositions as formulated by the Interstate Teacher\nAssessment and Support Consortium (InTASC)--an agency\nthat collaborates with state teacher licensing departments--\nprovide another portion of the theoretical framework for this\nresearch. The following eight multicultural dispositions are\ngleaned from a broader set of 43 recommendations teachers\nshould embrace to better serve our children (Council of Chief\n1. Believe that all children can learn and persist in help-\ning each learner reach his or her potential;\n2. Realize that content knowledge is not a fixed body of\nfacts but is complex, culturally situated, and\never-evolving;\n3. Recognize the potential of bias in their representation\nof the discipline and seek to appropriately address\nproblems of bias;\n4. Constantly explore how to use disciplinary knowl-\nedge as a lens to address local and global issues;\n5. Respect learners' diverse strengths and needs and are\ncommitted to using this information to plan effective\ninstruction;\n6. Are committed to deepening awareness and under-\nstanding the strengths and needs of diverse learners\nwhen planning and adjusting instruction;\n7. Value the variety of ways people communicate and\nencourage learners to develop and use multiple forms\nof communication; and\n8. Are committed to deepening an understanding of\ntheir frames of reference, the potential for biases in\nthese frames, and their impact on expectations for\nand relationships with learners and their families.\nNot all writers agree that dispositions can or should be\nassessed. Damon (2007), for example, argues that (a) dispo-\nsitions in teacher education risk becoming poorly defined\nconstructs that are interpreted in open-ended ways to suit the\nsubjective biases of the evaluator, and that (b) while the tra-\nditional scientific discussion of a disposition emphasizes a\nbirth-to-adult process that impacts personality development,\nthe NCATE definition focuses only on the candidate's here-\nand-now, value-driven conduct. This can cause a misalign-\nment of purpose between established research and current\npractice. There is also concern that loosely defined standards\nof dispositions can lead to the elimination of people who do\nnot pass a political litmus test, which could potentially lead\nto intimidation and fear of being eliminated from teacher\nSome writers (Dee & Henkin, 2002; Gollnick & Chinn,\n2013) call for a closer marriage between multicultural educa-\ntion and the dispositions movement. Aside from NCATE and\nInTASC standards, however, multicultural dispositions are\nless defined in the literature compared with the broader pro-\nfessional dispositions discourse. If pursued, this marriage\nwill need to be more than just a symbolic exercise. It must\ncontain a workable link between ensuring educator First\nAmendment rights of speech on one hand, while also\nacknowledging the efficacy of creative and non-traditional\nperspectives that ethnic groups identify as helpful to their\ndevelopment on the other hand.\nDespite reservations, Damon (2007) believes that stu-\ndents deserve to be instructed by teachers who are ethics-\ndriven, but only if educators can find ways to address the\nproblems of definition and assessment. Borko et al. (2007)\nand Duplass and Cruz (2010) believe that despite the lack of\nmetrically sound assessment measures, we must find creative\nways to provide on-going constructive feedback for teacher\ncandidates regarding dispositions. Other writers (Burant,\nabout dispositions agree that, if done correctly, students can\nbenefit from instruction that encourages an educator code of\nethics that can be assessed.\nI strongly believe it is possible to define and identify mul-\nticultural dispositions in meaningful and operational ways. A\nviable example of how to accomplish this does exist\n(Thompson, 2013). It is also possible to assess dispositions\nin fair and equitable manner, especially if you have a design\nthat (a) allows students to grade and monitor themselves and\n(b) counsels and encourages resistant students, as opposed to\nexiting them from their program of study (Thompson, 2009).\nNon-Color-Blind Curriculum (NCBC)\nIn addition to the review of literature, this study will also pull\nfrom the 35 years of experience I have with teaching multi-\ncultural education. Over the years, I have developed a macro\nperspective called non-color-blind curriculum (NCBC). It is\ndefined as a style of teaching that attempts to go beyond the\nfeel-good, \"I treat everybody like I would want to be treated\"\napproach to instruction. NCBC builds on a collaborative,\nsynthesis approach to teaching and learning. Although\nNCBC borrows elements from the critical race theory, criti-\ncal pedagogy, and critical theory schools of thought, it does\nnot abandon the underlying principles of the Western tradi-\ntions of rational inquiry.\nThe tenets of NCBC agree with Max Horkheimer and the\nFrankfurt School that learning must accomplish more than\njust the promotion of knowledge--that we must use educa-\ntion to liberate ourselves (Ray, 2003). Likewise, NCBC\nagrees with Delgado and Stefanic (2012) that the phenome-\nnon of white privilege is greatly understated in current dis-\ncussions and that many civil rights advances made on the\nbehalf of African Americans coincided with the self-interest\nThompson 5\nof the white elite. Still, NCBC is hesitant to embrace fringe\ncritical race theorists who call for such remedies as separat-\nism and reparations.\nThe principles of NCBC also agree with the views of Joan\nWink (2010) and other leading critical pedagogists that\nteachers must redistribute classroom power so that students\ntake more responsibility for their own education. While it is\ntrue that sharing power encourages intellectual character and\ndiscourages the promotion of simple mimicry of the profes-\nsional style, it is also true that many 20-year-olds require\ndeeper levels of knowledge and guidance before they are\nable to make critical decisions about topics such as race,\npower, and privilege. NCBC acknowledges the need for a\ndelicate balance between mentoring students and utilizing\ntraditional teaching methods on one hand, while empowering\nlearners to critically think, self-explore, and reinvent truth on\nthe other hand.\nIn addition to the generalized description given above, the\nfollowing is a more detailed listing of strategies and perspec-\ntives that underlie the NCBC approach:\n1. Even though anti-racism still remains the central\ntheme of multicultural education, its study must now\ninclude multiple examples of oppression. Addressing\nnon-race forms of discrimination must not be done in\ntrivial ways;\n2. Giving all cultural groups equal time is unrealistic.\nBecause it is impossible to cover all groups in a\n17-week course, students will need to learn basic\nsocial justice principles from a sampling of diversity\npopulations, then apply the general themes and prin-\nciples learned to all groups;\n3. A politically correct (i.e., color-blind) approach is\nviewed as insufficient. Its ultimate goal appears to\nmake teacher candidates feel-good without adequately\naddressing real problems within our communities;\n4. Multicultural education should never be an awareness-\nonly exercise. The attainment of cross-cultural com-\nmunication skills, greater levels of insight,\nself-efficacy for disadvantaged kids, and change\nagency are preferred goals;\n5. Controversy should not be shunned, but rather\nembraced. Good learning happens when instructors\nface problems head on and skillfully address, not\navoid, controversy;\n6. Once traditional indices are accounted for, additional\nattention must be given to power and privilege issues,\nas well as the abuses that often flow from them;\n7. Successful multicultural instruction must pay atten-\ntion to both content and process. One cannot be sac-\nrificed at the expense of the other;\n8. In order for meaningful lifelong learning to take\nplace, instruction must simultaneously be aimed at\nthe head (academic), gut (feeling), and heart (social\nchange) levels;\n9. Effective multicultural education is greatly enhanced\nby engaging in interactive learning experiences. The\nlecture-only method is not good enough;\n10. Multicultural education must take on an interdisci-\nplinary mentality. It should include a synthesis of\ninformation gathered from many fields of study. It\nshould not only investigate people, places, and\nevents, but also pay attention to psychological forces\nthat explain multicultural rejection and ego defense\nmechanisms that encourage learner resistance;\n11. The instructor must become adept at releasing major-\nity group students from historical guilt, while at the\nsame time recruiting them to become change agents;\n12. Effective multicultural education is enhanced when\ninstruction highlights the pain and suffering of disad-\nvantaged groups, as well as testimonials about how\nobstacles were overcome. A delicate balance between\nmessages of pain and triumph is needed for the suc-\ncessful training of education candidates;\n13. Partisan political pandering is viewed as counter-\nproductive to the ultimate goals of a diverse society.\nEclectic collaboration between political groups and\ncompeting ideologies is highly encouraged. Common\nground can be found;\n14. Student reflection and on-going self-assessment\nmake for a better professional. Self-analysis is not\nour enemy; and\n15. Educators who adopt a well-conceived dispositional\nmind-set will have a greater opportunity to bring\nabout meaningful change in our schools compared\nwith those who are dispositional critics.\nTo a large degree, this research investigates the efficacy of\nthe NCBC approach that I have developed. But it also seeks\nto allow students an opportunity to weigh in on what works\nand what does not work for their personal and professional\ndevelopment.\nResearch Questions and Hypotheses\nThis study addressed the following research questions:\nResearch Question 1: How are students impacted by\nNCBC teaching strategies aimed at promoting greater\nmulticultural awareness?\nResearch Question 2: How do students respond to a\nbrand of multicultural instruction that is 35% traditional\nand 65% critical pedagogy and questioning oriented?\nResearch Question 3: Are the results of this analysis\naffected by certain demographic characteristics such as\nrace, gender, age, and political allegiance?\nGoing into the study, I rejected the null hypothesis for all\nthree questions. I hypothesized that NCBC would positively\nimpact students, that the 35/65 curriculum mixture would\n6 SAGE Open\nencourage deeper thought and greater analytical skills, and\nthat factors such as race and political allegiance would have\nan impact on the findings.\nMethod\nParticipants\nParticipants who comprised a convenience sample for this study\nwere teacher and counselor candidates (N = 337) who attended\na Midwestern metropolitan university situated in an urban set-\nsaid that they had received no prior multicultural education. One\nhundred sixty-six respondents (50%) had taken 1 to 3 prior\nclasses, while 45 persons (14%) had taken 4 or more classes.\nEighty-eight (26%) of the individuals surveyed were male and\nCaucasian, while 37 (11%) were students of color. Of those 37,\n15 were Hispanic, 13 were African American, and 9 were of\nAsian descent. A low percentage of race minority students\napplying to become an educator has been a long-standing issue\nfor this and many other communities.\ndred thirty-one persons (69%) possessed only a high school\ndegree, while 82 persons (24%) had obtained an associate's\nor a bachelor's degree, and 23 individuals (7%) had a post-\nbachelor's degree. Two hundred twenty respondents (66%)\nwere undergraduate education majors, while 59 (18%) were\ngraduates studying to be counselors (35 school and 24 agency\ncandidates). Fifty-two persons (16%) were non-education\nmajors who took the class as an elective.\nPolitically speaking, 65 individuals (20%) classified\nthemselves as being conservative, 70 persons (21%) as mod-\nwere eclectic in their thinking. Seventy-seven (23%) were\npolitically undecided, and 3 people (1%) refused to answer\nthe question. The rationale for including political affiliation\non the survey was to test the popular stereotype (accurate or\nnot) that conservatives do not value the study of multicul-\ntural education. I will investigate that stereotype through the\nnarrow lens of education majors.\nThe Survey Instrument\nA copy of the survey is enclosed (see Appendix A). The first 2\nitems measure the impact that the treatment plan (i.e., instruc-\ntion based on recommendations from the review of literature\nand NCBC principles) had on student personal and profes-\nsional growth or lack thereof.As previously mentioned, a 35%\ntraditional and 65% critical pedagogy approach to teaching\nmulticultural education will be used. To better aid the reader's\nunderstanding of what that means, a comparison of the two\napproaches is enclosed (see Appendix B). The remaining 13\nsurvey items help the reader better understand the components\nof NCBC. They also help highlight the need for educators to\nemphasize both content and process when teaching multicul-\ntural education. Additional items that solicit demographic\ninformation round out the survey. The survey was cleared by\nthe university's institutional review board and administered at\nthe end of the semester. It was included in addition to the end-\nof-semester evaluation students typically partake in.\nData Analysis\nUtilizing the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences\n(SPSS) computer program, the following statistical analyses\nwere conducted:\n1. A summarization of descriptive findings;\n2. Several ANOVA analyses to estimate relationships\nbetween selected survey responses and selected\ndemographic attribute variables;\n3. A factor analysis to help clarify the delineation\nbetween instructional and environmental impacts,\nand to ascertain which constructs pass statistical\nscrutiny for inclusion in a predictive model; and\n4. A multiple regression analysis to determine which of\nthe instructional variables help predict personal and\nprofessional growth.\nResults\nDescriptive Analysis\nDescriptive results reveal interesting findings (see Table 1).\nOn a scale of 1 to 9 with 1 being the lowest and 9 being the\nhighest, respondents rated their personal growth as a result of\nexperiencing NCBC instruction with a mean score of 7.15 and\na professional growth score of 7.44. These are high marks for\na predominantly White population from a mostly conservative\npart of the nation--students who were required to take a state\nmandated multicultural course. Nothing was rejected. Students\nrated all of the individual instructional strategies higher than\nthe average (i.e., mid-point) score of five. The two highest\ninstructional influences were (a) the class allowed me to form\nmy own opinion independent of the instructor's perspective\n(7.97) and (b) the instructor's non-color-blind teaching\napproach positively impacted me (7.76). The two lowest\ninstructional influences were: I was positively impacted by (a)\ninformation gained from the textbook and other readings\n(5.87) and (b) guest speakers who shared stories about per-\nsonal trials and triumphs (6.97). Even these lower set of scores\nrepresent solid multicultural acceptance, however.\nVariables such as prior education, parents, religious train-\ning, and the individual's sense of \"personal goodness\" (i.e.,\nenvironmental mediators) were important in forming the\nmulticultural worldview of students, but they did not have the\nsame impact as the NCBC instructional factors (see Table 1).\nOf special note is the fact that prior education was the lowest\nscore (5.39) of any of the variables. Also significant was the\nThompson 7\nfact that students did not want the instructor to exchange his\ncritical questioning, experimental style for a safer, more\nstandard teaching approach (2.53).\nOne-Way ANOVA Analyses\nThe hypothesis that significant differences would be found\nas a result of disaggregating the data by selected\ndemographic variables had to be mostly rejected. By and\nlarge, scores were relatively independent of race, gender,\nclass, and age (see Table 2). When looking at political alle-\ngiance, however, there were a few significant findings.\nFor example, conservatives were more likely to have (a) a\nTable 1.

The first construct was\nlabeled instructional correlates. It consists of the following six\nteaching techniques: (a) a non-color-blind, critical style of\nteaching; (b) a message that is aimed simultaneously at both\nthe head and heart; (c) the promotion of open dialogue that\naddresses tough questions; (d) the usage of videos that high-\nlight human relations missing links; (e) guest speakers who\nshare persuasive stories about human relations' trials and tri-\numphs; and (f) the impact of the textbook and other reading\nmaterials used for the course. These are the components of the\nsix-factor non-color-blind instructional variable identified in\nthe abstract of this article. Although each of the teaching strat-\negies can stand on its own merit, it is more accurate to account\nfor variances shared between variables. Therefore, the vari-\nables are included in the multiple regression model as a six\ndimensional construct. The reader will note that Cronbach's\nalpha coefficient for all six variables was above the .70 accept-\nability rule, meaning the construct was reliable.\nA second construct was tabbed environmental influences.\nIt consists of the following four correlates: The influence of\n(a) prior education, (b) parents and family upbringing,\n(c) religious beliefs, and (d) the \"naturally good person in\nme.\" Unlike the first construct, the coefficients for these four\nvariables did not meet the .70 rule for establishing reliability.\nshould not be totally ignored because of the potential to\nunderstand important part influences. Because a .50 cut-off\nis only a guideline, however, each researcher must make his\nor her own judgment call. I decided to reject the environmen-\ntal influences coefficients because they were not reliable\nenough to be included in my predictor model.\nMultiple Regression Analysis\nThe results of the multiple regression analyses were encour-\naging (see Table 4). Variables important to predicting student\npersonal growth were the six-factor NCBC instructional\nstudents the opportunity to form their own opinions indepen-\nstate law mandating multicultural education (t = 3.234, p =\n.001). The linear equation for the three predictor model is\n(Independent Thinking) + .161 (State Mandate), R2 = .56, p <\nand 0.1 (less than small), respectively, for critical teaching,\nindependent thinking, and state mandate. It is important to\nremember that regression analysis does not establish causa-\ntion, but rather primarily speaks to predictive correlations.\nFactors important to predicting students' professional\ngrowth include the same variables as above but with a slightly\nlesser impact, namely, non-color-blind instruction (t = 9.485,\np  .0005), allowing students the opportunity to form their\n(small), and 0.1 (less than small) for critical teaching,\nTable 3. Factor Analysis Results: Post-Semester Survey Items With Factor Loadings.\nSubscale Factor Loading 1 Factor Loading 2 Reliability\nI. Impactful instructional correlates\nII. Environmental influences on my multicultural awareness\nThompson 9\nindependent thinking, and state mandate, respectively. Out of\ncuriosity, I included the factored environmental construct\ninto both models of the regression, but that move did not\nsignificantly improve the prediction.\nDiscussion\nRegarding the first research question, students responded\nvery positively to a non-color-blind, critical and questioning\nbrand of multicultural instruction. On a scale of 1 to 9 with 9\nrepresenting the most positive experience, students (N = 337)\nrated their personal growth at 7.15 and their professional\ngrowth at 7.44 (refer to Table 1). These are high scores taking\ninto account the level of emotion and controversy inherent in\nteaching this topic in a predominantly white setting.\nThe dimensions of the six-factor NCBC variable utilized\nfor instruction include (a) a questioning, deep-seeking, explor-\natory, and critical brand of instruction; (b) a message that is\nsimultaneously aimed at the head, heart, and gut; (c) instruc-\ntion that promotes open and honest student-to-student, and\nstudent-to-instructor dialogue; (d) the usage of outside speak-\ners who are adept at highlighting both challenges and ways to\novercome obstacles; (e) the usage of videos that help make a\nhead-to-heart connection about the struggle of disempowered\npeople; and (f) written material and textbook readings that\ninspire reflection and enhance multicultural awareness.\nRespondents also placed a high value on the importance\nof an instructor who encourages people to think about how\nwe think. The promotion of independent thinking was one of\nthe better received teacher strategies in this study. On one\nhand, students do not want instructors to water-down the\nmaterial nor do they want us to handle them with kid's\ngloves, on the other hand, they do not want to be told how to\nthink. Today's students appear to want educators to give\nthem all aspects of a debated topic and then trust them to\ncome up with their own conclusions. This is a good thing.\nThe null hypothesis regarding the impact of selected demo-\ngraphic influences was mostly accepted. By and large, scores\nwere relatively independent of race, gender, and age. When\nlooking at political allegiance, however, there were a few sig-\nnificant findings, albeit none of them were surprising. For\nexample, respondents who did not know what their political\nallegiances were had the hardest time adjusting to the experi-\nmental instructional style. People who were politically unaware\nor undecided were more likely to have higher mean scores com-\npared with liberals and eclectic thinkers when it came to believ-\ning the instructor should have experimented less. Likewise,\nconservatives were more likely to have (a) a lower mean score\ncompared with moderates when looking at personal growth, (b)\na lower mean score compared with liberals when looking at the\nimpact of a state mandate, and (c) a lower mean score compared\nwith liberals when judging the impact of written material on\nlearning. Although the views of liberals and moderates were\nsomewhat more pro-multicultural education than that of conser-\nvatives and undecided persons, those differences had small\neffect sizes. By and large, all groups were benefitted by the\nNCBC brand of multicultural instruction.\nThere were a couple of findings that I did not foresee\ngoing into this research. For example, I was quite surprised\nthat nearly a quarter of my students did not understand the\nconcept of political affiliation. A show of hands during class\nsessions also revealed that only 25% of them voted in the last\nnational election and even less in local elections. This is an\neducational indictment aimed at the home, high school, and\ncollege levels. In addition, I was somewhat surprised that\nprior education and parental influence did not play a bigger\nrole, although the impact was by no means marginal.\nSurprisingly, the highest score (8.07) on the post-survey was\ngiven for support of a multicultural state mandate. Contrary\nto popular myth, education candidates support the role of an\nintervening governmental body on behalf of multicultural\neducation if it is explained and executed well. Whether or not\nthe multicultural optimism found in this study can be dupli-\ncated for other non-education majors remains to be seen.\nIt is important to note that the goals of a traditional multi-\ncultural approach are not bad--they are, however, incomplete.\nThe goal of the NCBC approach is to include important prin-\nciples that the traditional approach embraces, while also\nTable 4.

NCBC = non-color-blind curriculum.\nextending the conversation into new areas that are often over-\nlooked or minimized. Students often spoke about the need for\nteachers to \"keep it relevant and keep it real.\" My 35/65 tradi-\ntional-critical pedagogy curriculum mixture appears to suc-\ncessfully accomplish this goal. When given a chance to state\nthat they wish the instructor had taken a more standard and\nsafer approach to instruction, students responded with a mean\nscore of 2.53 representing a dissenting view.\nQuantitative results appeared to be aligned with anecdotal\ncommentary provided in the optional portion of the survey. A\nfew student samples include the following comments:\nTo be totally honest, I was dreading this class. Turns out I\nlearned a lot about life and about myself.\nThank you for teaching more than just me. Every time I learned\nsomething new in your class I shared it with my husband and the\nrest of my family.\nYou have provided me with so much education. You have\nstretched my brain to think beyond the \"Pollyanna\" ways in\nwhich I normally think.\nTo be sure, not all students were happy. Listed below is an\nexample of a negative review:\nI leave this class more confused than when I first entered it.\nBefore this class I believed in treating everyone equal. Now, I\nfeel guilty for being white.\nThis study is not without limitations. First, even though a\nmultiple regression quotient of .56 is considered solid for the\nsocial sciences, there may be other factors not accounted for\n(i.e., student self-analysis, simulation games, self-disclosure,\nuse of humor, etc.) that could potentially improve the predic-\ntion. Second, we are all aware of great curriculum designs that\nare poorly articulated by marginal teachers. It is quite possible\nthen that poor designs can yield better-than-expected results\nbecause of the professional and personal qualities of teachers.\nMore research needs to be conducted regarding the personal\nand professional characteristics that master teachers possess.\nThird, the study is also limited by the fact that until it is repli-\ncated, the results cannot be generalized to a larger population.\nDuplication of this work is sorely needed and welcomed.\nDespite these limitations, the results of this study are\nimportant because they highlight two separate, but related\ngaps in the literature: (a) a set of user-friendly, critical-\noriented multicultural instructional strategies can be identified\nand (b) there is a need to include more student input when\ndefining what makes for effective multicultural instruction.\nImplications for Educators\nIt goes without saying that permeating instruction makes a\ndifference in student learning. Curriculum approaches that\nfoundation for multicultural education, but changing times\ndictate that methods of teaching be adapted to reflect a\nchanging world. Since the early days of multicultural educa-\ntion's inception, a true global society has emerged, and the\ndefinition of diversity has broadened. In addition, it is no\nlonger acceptable to teach about personal possibilities with-\nout also investigating the roadblocks that keep individuals\nand society from reaching our full potential.\nMany will say that the days of multicultural education are\nnumbered; that society is moving toward a meritocracy and\nthe need for such college course offerings is waning. While it\nis true that race and social conditions have improved, we are\nfar from being out of the woods. Casual viewing of the eve-\nning news easily corroborates that conclusion. Misinformed\nfolks will try to make a claim that the election of Barack\nObama as President of the United States was a signal that\nclass and socioeconomic factors have replaced racism and\nsexism as the main concerns of human relations. From my\npoint of view, that kind of thinking appears to be about 50\nyears too soon. We cannot afford to mistake the positive\nchanges taking place in our nation as evidence that our soci-\nety no longer needs to be educated. Still, it is incumbent on\nclassroom teachers to evolve with the times. Today's stu-\ndents do not want the blame-game nor the feel-good brands\nof multicultural education indicative of yesteryear's efforts.\nWhile educators should never ignore the power of love\nand the wisdom of treating others like we want to be treated\n(i.e., a traditional approach), it is also imperative that we\ninvestigate the deeper factors that keep good people divided.\nThe outcome of the recent Trayvon Martin murder trial is a\ngood example of how well-meaning people on both sides\noperate from vastly different perspectives. In that case, con-\nservative pundits failed to see how issues of power and privi-\nlege blocked Florida jurors from understanding how\ndisempowered people communicate and react with authority\nfigures. I believe that a 35% traditional and 65% critical mul-\nticultural curriculum mix taught in our schools can help cre-\nate more opportunities for win/win results in cases like these.\nFindings from this study appear to corroborate curriculum\nsuggestions found in the literature. For example, they agree\nwith Gordon (2005) that color-blind curriculum is insuffi-\ncient; with Freire (2005) about the importance of dialogue;\nwith Nieto and Bode (2012) that content alone is not\nenough--that the process of multicultural education is just as\nimportant; with Banks (2009) that it is important for teachers\nto critically teach many perspectives, and then trust students\nto form their own opinions, and; with Anderson et al. (2000)\nthat including guest speakers who have a permeating story to\ntell helps give the message of diversity staying power. My\nstudy validates literature recommendations, but they also\nencourage the coupling of correlates in new ways that are\nseldom realized in the typical classroom.\nMy findings also address a concern by Perry et al. (2009)\nthat the pedagogical skills necessary for the required diversity\neducation classroom are, \" . . . complex, extensive and may be\nbeyond the skills that are modeled in current classrooms or\nrepresented in typical instructional training and development\nprograms on campus\" (p. 100). There is not enough in the lit-\nerature that addresses the art of multicultural curriculum deliv-\nery. Undoubtedly, there are many programs and paradigms\nthat work, but we as educators need to get busy and share our\nsuccesses with each other. Strategies outlined here in the\nreview of literature, the introduction of NCBC instruction, and\nthe 35/65 melding of traditional and critical pedagogy\napproaches (see Appendix B) provide one example of how the\nmulticultural teacher training gap can be closed.\nThe NCBC approach utilized in this study asserts that\nthere is more useful truth located somewhere along a critical\nspectrum, as opposed to what we typically find at the fringes\nof the political left or right. Criticism will undoubtedly ema-\nnate from both sides. Traditionalists and conservatives will\nhail the suggested approach as the end of national unity.\nCritical pedagogists and education liberals will say it does\nnot go far enough--that hegemony and the abuses of the\npowerful and privileged will remain protected for the benefit\nof the elite. Both arguments have merit. One thing is clear:\nThere is no argument that something new and different must\nbe done. I believe that revolution is not always warranted;\nthat established legal and constitutional methods have the\npotential to bring about meaningful social change. Many will\ndisagree. In the meantime, there is a war being waged against\nchildren and many of them fall through the cracks of society\nwhile pundits continue the debate.\nThis research is significant because students from a typi-\ncally conservative part of the country were positively\nimpacted by a synthesis approach that 15 years ago would\nhave been labeled as radical or over-the-top. The difference\nbetween now and then is threefold. First, students of all\ncolors and backgrounds today want a more meaningful edu-\ncation that lines up with the everyday life they experience\noutside of the classroom. Second, putting more emphasis\non the process and not just highlighting multicultural con-\ntent is a key factor to greater multicultural awareness.\nThird, the adoption of a critical pedagogy which infuses\ndiscussions of power and privilege into the traditional con-\nversation helps students better understand interference\npoints that account for the missing gaps in our human rela-\ntions efforts.\nThe art of managing social polemics is never an easy road\nto traverse. We as a people appear to be forever enslaved by\na day/night, either/or, black/white, up/down, devil/angel\nexistence. The critical middle is a hard place to find. This is\nespecially true with regard to race and human relations. But,\nthere is a remnant of young people that appear poised on the\nhorizon to one day crash the gridlock convention. They sing\na familiar song with its sacred chorus, but with new vigor\nand interpretation: \"Yes, we are truly free at last!\" The results\nof this study demonstrate that meaningful human relations\ndo not occur by happenstance, but rather by the purposeful,\ncritical, and creative efforts of educators to properly instruct\nand inform students.\nAppendix A\nPost-Semester Evaluation Scale\nNot Helpful At All A Little Helpful Average Impact Above Average Impact Extremely Helpful\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\n______________________________________________________________________________________________\nStrongly Disagree Somewhat Disagree Somewhat Agree Clearly Agree Very Strongly Agree\nDirections: Use the above scale to register your agreement or disagreement with the following multicultural and human rela-\ntions teacher strategies.

Foundational principles (Note: NCBC incorporates many of the elements found in the traditional\ncurriculum approach, while also attempting to extend student awareness\ninto new awareness)\n\u00b7 \nRegardless of ethnicity, culture, gender, and family background, I\nbelieve all kids can learn and they deserve my best effort.\n\u00b7 Do not fear diversity; we should celebrate it!\n\u00b7 \nA rising tide raises all boats.\n\u00b7 \nEducation and dialogue will solve all social evils.\n\u00b7 \nIt is better to be color-respective than to be color-blind. It is good to\nsometimes question the status quo and political correctness.\n\u00b7 \nUnless you address the root of a \"social weed,\" when it sprouts back up\nit will be even more stubborn.\n\u00b7 \nDo not ignore the impact power and privilege has on disadvantage.\nII. Probable multicultural worldview \n\u00b7 \nThe United States electing a Black President shows how far are nation\nhas come in race relations.\n\u00b7 \nPoverty, single-parenting, and miseducation are the main reasons for\ncontinued social ills.\n\u00b7 \nLearned helplessness is just as much the fault as racism and poverty.\n\u00b7 \nThe best way to train teacher candidates is to emphasize greater\nknowledge and skill development. Dispositions are a slippery slope.\n\u00b7 \nGreed, abuse of power, and uncritical thinking are the real enemies.\n\u00b7 \nHighlighting the accomplishments of a few successful minority persons\nwhile ignoring the problems of the many is neither fair nor wise. We\nneed to keep it real and honest when we teach.\n\u00b7 \nYes, we should embrace controversy as a teaching tool.\n\u00b7 \nAwareness, knowledge, and skills are not enough. The application of\ndispositions (if done correctly) is a key missing link.\nIII. Probable instructional strategies utilized \n\u00b7 \nWe must choose lessons and activities that create a safe, caring, and\naccepting classroom atmosphere.\n\u00b7 \nWe must choose lessons that highlight our similarities.\n\u00b7 \nWe should utilize lessons that honor our heroes and their deeds.\n\u00b7 \nLanguage policing and practicing how to talk is a main component.\n\u00b7 \nWe should use group work and interactive learning strategies.\n\u00b7 \nWe should utilize journaling, service learning and portfolios.\n\u00b7 \nWe must teach toward the gaps. Find the missing links. Teach both\ncontent and process.\n\u00b7 \nIt is imperative that we investigate power and privilege interferences.\n\u00b7 \nIt is imperative that we investigate ego defense mechanisms.\n\u00b7 \nWe must train future teachers to be critical thinkers.\n\u00b7 \nWe should utilize reflection, dialogue, and interactive learning.\n\u00b7 \nWe must utilize a 35/65 traditional-critical pedagogy curriculum mix.\nIV. Potential impact on majority teachers \n\u00b7 \nNow is the time to show how the other forms of discrimination are\njust as bad as racism.\n\u00b7 \nThere is a magic recipe that exists. Once I learn that recipe, all my\nstudents will be successful.\n\u00b7 \nOnce minority students learn the power of education and middle class\nvalues and once white students learn not to stereotype, all will be fine.\n\u00b7 \nYes our society has improved, but now is not the time to go soft on the\nimpact of racism.\n\u00b7 \nIt's not about me or the views I happen to hold. It's about the kids!\n\u00b7 \nMy intentions and being a good person have little correlation with\nwhether or not I am effective with hurting kids.\n\u00b7 \nI must change the world one kid at a time.\nV. Potential impact on minority students \n\u00b7 \nI did not realize that multicultural education is much bigger than race\nand gender issues. I now see all forms of injustice must be addressed.\n\u00b7 \nThe way to climb out of poverty and become successful is to (a)\nassimilate and emulate the majority group, (b) rely on sports, music,\nand other entertainment opportunities to escape my condition, or (c)\ncreate a viable and legal alternative to the majority paradigm.\n\u00b7 \nNow that I have gained my freedom, it is now all about making money\nand collecting material things.\n\u00b7 \nI don't have to stay bitter about life. I can forgive. I can overcome. I can\nsucceed. I can change my trajectory in life.\n\u00b7 \nLetting down my guard and learning to trust is not for the other guy; it's\nfor me. I will be better off by forgiving!\n\u00b7 \nIn order for me to succeed in this society, I must become bi-culturally\ncompetent!\n\u00b7 \nLife is not fair. Whether I like it or not, after I achieve my goals I will be\nasked to reach back and help those less fortunate than I.\n\u00b7 \nI finally understand how the system works.\nVI. Potential impact on majority students \n\u00b7 \nI've always been a good person who means well. Now I can add to my\nresume the fact that I have taken \"the class.\" Love will conquer all.\n\u00b7 \nIt is been an enlightening class, but still--is not the problem more the\nolder generation and not the people my age and younger?\n\u00b7 \nIt is those \"backward Whites\" who are causing all the problems, not\nwe who are already enlightened.\n\u00b7 \nMy best friend is black and I bowl with Asians.\n\u00b7 \nI have learned the magic of word-policing. I now know what to say and\nwhat not to say. I found the recipe.\n\u00b7 \nI can see clearer now. There is more to this multicultural thing than I\nfirst realized. I can now see that I did not understand the role power and\nprivilege plays in creating disadvantage.\n\u00b7 \nI need to put away my magic wand. Self-reliance and education are only\ntwo of many tools needed for disadvantaged kids to beat the odds and\nescape poverty.\n\u00b7 \nEven if we elect a woman or a race minority person to be President of\nour nation, we still have more work to do.\n\u00b7 \nTo whom much is given, much is required.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAnderson, S.
