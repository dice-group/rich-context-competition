Although sevo-\nflurane is a popular, well-accepted and easily\nmanageable anaesthetic for the induction\nand maintenance of anaesthesia (in addition\nto having a good safety profile), recovery\nmay be complicated by emergence agitation\nin paediatric patients, even in the absence of\nsurgery.1 Cravero et al.1 reported that,\ndepending on whether a high or low thresh-\nold was used to define agitation, 33% or\n80%, respectively, of patients receiving\nsevoflurane anaesthesia developed emer-\ngence delirium.\nSeveral studies have evaluated the ability\nof premedication to decrease the incidence\nof emergence agitation. Midazolam is the\nmost frequently used premedication drug in\npaediatric patients;2\u00ad4 however, there are\nongoing debates concerning its efficacy in\npreventing emergence agitation.5 Ketamine\nand alfentanil are other premedication drugs\nthat are used in paediatric patients.6\u00ad8\nCombining different premedication drugs\nhas offered promising results in terms of\nimproved sedation scores and anxiolysis.9,10\nThe present study evaluated the effects on\nemergence agitation of adding intranasal\nketamine or intranasal alfentanil to oral\nmidazolam as premedication in children\nundergoing urological surgery.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nChildren aged between 1 and 8 years\nundergoing general anaesthesia with sevo-\nflurane for urological surgical procedures at\nYeditepe University Hospital, Istanbul,\nTurkey, between February and August 2012,\nwho were American Society of\nAnesthesiologist status I\u00adII, were enrolled in\nthe study. Exclusion criteria included cardiac,\npulmonary, hepatic or renal disease, and\npsychological or emotional disorders.\nWritten informed parental consent was\nobtained for all study participants. The\nstudy was registered with the Clinical\nTrials.gov protocol registration system\nEthics Committee of Yeditepe University\nHospital, Istanbul, Turkey.\nPremedication and anaesthesia\nAll patients received oral midazolam\n0.5 mg/kg as preanaesthetic medication\n$40 min before the induction of anaesthesia.\nChildren were randomly assigned to one of\nthree groups using a computer-generated\nrandom number table by an anaesthesiolo-\ngist who did not participate in the study.\nChildren in the ketamine group (group MK)\nreceived 2 mg/kg ketamine intranasally,\nthose in the alfentanil group (group MA)\nreceived 10 mg/kg alfentanil intranasally and\nthose in the saline group (group MS)\nreceived 1 ml isotonic saline intranasally,\n8\u00ad10 min before the induction of anaesthe-\nsia. The intranasal drugs were given while\npatients were in the supine position; if the\nvolume of drug required exceeded 1 ml, the\ndose was divided between both nostrils.\nEach patient's parents, the anaesthesiolo-\ngists (with the exception of S.B.), the statis-\ntician and all observers were blinded to the\nstudy groups.\nHeart rate, noninvasive blood pressure\nand oxygen saturation on pulse oximetry\nwere routinely monitored and recorded\nbefore anaesthesia induction and every\n5 min during surgery. Anaesthesia was\ninduced with 7% sevoflurane and 60%\nnitrous oxide in oxygen, then maintained\nwith 0.75 minimum alveolar concentration\nof sevoflurane in 60% nitrous oxide in\noxygen. After anaesthesia induction and\nintravenous cannulation, a laryngeal mask\nairway was inserted. Before the first surgical\nincision, caudal block was performed using\nAdequacy of caudal block was assessed with\nthe absence of an increase in heart rate with\nthe skin incision; the block was deemed\ninadequate if the heart rate increased > 20%\nwithin 60 s of the incision. At the end of\nsurgery, inhaled agents were discontinued\nand the oxygen concentration was increased\nPatient evaluation\nFor each patient, age, weight, duration of\nsurgery and anaesthesia, and spontaneous\neye opening time (emergence duration) were\nrecorded.\nParental separation status was measured\nin the preoperative period using a four-point\nscale (1, asleep; 2, good separation, awake,\ncalm; 3, awake, anxious, can be easily\nreassured; 4, crying, cannot be reassured).11\nSimilarly, a four-point scale was also used to\nassess the ease of mask acceptance\n(1, excellent \u00ad asleep or awake, calm,\nco-operative, accepting mask; 2, slight fear\nbut can be easily reassured; 3, moderate fear,\nreassured with difficulty; 4, crying, needs\nEmergence agitation was measured using\na paediatric anaesthesia emergence delirium\n(PAED) score,12 in which five attributes (the\nchild makes eye contact with the caregiver;\nthe child's actions are purposeful; the child is\naware of the surroundings; the child is\nrestless; the child is inconsolable) are\nscored between 0 and 4. Eye contact, pur-\nposeful actions and awareness of surround-\nings were scored as: 0, extremely; 1, very\nmuch; 2, quite a bit; 3, just a little; 4, not at\nall. Restlessness and inconsolability were\nscored as: 0, not at all; 1, just a little; 2, quite\na bit; 3, very much; 4, extremely. The\nmaximum score overall is 20. The degree of\nand 120 min after entering the postanaesthe-\nsia care unit, and the highest recorded values\nduring the first 30 min and the following\n90 min were used for evaluation. Patients\nwith a PAED score > 12 at any time during\nthe first 120 min postoperatively were con-\nsidered to be agitated13 and were treated\nwith 1 mg/kg intravenous fentanyl.\nAt the same time points as the PAED\nscore was recorded, pain was assessed using\nthe Modified Children's Hospital of Eastern\nOntario Pain Scale (Modified CHEOPS),14\nwhich is based on scores for cry, facial\nexpression, verbal expression and move-\nment. Each child with a pain score ! 4 was\ntreated with 1 mg/kg intravenous fentanyl in\nthe postanaesthesia care unit.\nThe modified Aldrete score15 was mea-\nsured every 5 min to determine readiness for\ndischarge from the postanaesthesia care\nunit, with a score of ! 9 being required for\ndischarge.\nAfter discharge from the postanaesthesia\ncare unit, children with a Modified\nCHEOPS score ! 4 or higher received oral\nparacetamol at a dose of 15 mg/kg.\nAdverse events s(including laryngos-\npasm, bronchospasm and postoperative\nrespiratory depression, hypoxaemia, and\nnausea or vomiting) were noted. In addition,\nthe time to discharge from hospital was\nrecorded for each patient.\nStatistical analyses\nOn the basis of reference data,5 G*Power\n3.1.5 (http://www.gpower.hhu.de/en.html)\nwas used to calculate that a sample size of\n28 would be needed in each group to detect a\n25% difference in PAED scores with a\nsignificance level of 0.05 and a power of\n80% (one-sided test). Variables were\nanalysed using the Kolmogorov\u00adSmirnov\ntest to determine whether or not they were\nnormally distributed.\nData for continuous variables were pre-\nsented as mean \u00c6 SD. Data for categorical\nvariables were presented as frequencies and\npercentages. 2-test was used to compare\ncategorical variables in the different groups.\nOne-way analysis of variance was used to\ncompare normally distributed variables\nbetween groups. The Levene test was used\nto assess the homogeneity of the variances.\nWhen overall significance was observed,\npairwise post-hoc tests were performed\nusing Tukey's test. The Kruskall\u00adWallis\ntest was used to compare non-normally\ndistributed variables between the groups.\nThe Mann\u00adWhitney U-test was performed\nto test the significance of pairwise differences\nusing the Bonferroni correction to adjust for\nmultiple comparisons. A P-value < 0.05 was\nconsidered to be statistically significant.\nApart from the calculation of sample size,\nall statistical analyses were performed using\nIBM SPSS\u00d5 Statistics software, version 21\n(IBM, Somers, NY, USA).\nResults\nA total of 84 children were enrolled in the\nstudy; six children were excluded due to\ndeviation from the protocol (Figure 1),\nEnrolled\nGroup MK\nAnalysed\nGroup MA\nAnalysed\nGroup MS\nAnalysed\nExcluded\n1 did not take midazolam\nExcluded\n1 failed caudal block\n1 delayed transfer\nExcluded\n1 failed caudal block\n2 lost to follow up\nFigure 1.

The incidences of\nnausea or vomiting in groups MA and MK\nwere higher than in group MS, but these\ndifferences were not statistically significant\n(Table 3). The times to hospital discharge\nwere similar for all three groups (Table 3).\nModified CHEOPS pain scores were < 4\nthroughout the study in all patients, there-\nfore additional fentanyl use for pain relief\nwas not required.\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, addition of intranasal\nketamine to oral midazolam as a premedica-\ntion significantly improved the quality of\nanaesthetic induction and reduced sevoflur-\nane-induced emergence agitation, without\ndelaying emergence or affecting the time to\ndischarge from hospital.\nA number of factors affect emergence\nagitation, including: preoperative anxiety;16\nAlthough emergence agitation in children\nafter sevoflurane anaesthesia can occur in\nthose who are not in pain,1 postoperative\npain is a well-known contributing factor.17\nIn the present study, caudal analgesia\nensured that all participants were pain free.\nThe incidence of sevoflurane-induced\nemergence agitation has been reported to\nbe 33\u00ad80%, with the wide range in incidence\nbeing related to the definitions used.1\nA number of scales have been devised to\nevaluate emergence agitation in children.\nThe PAED scale has been shown to be\nreliable and valid.12 In the present study,\npatients were considered to be agitated if the\nPAED score was > 12 at any time during the\npostoperative period; using this definition,\nthe incidence of agitation was 3.8% in group\ngroup MS.\nDifferent strategies have been recom-\nmended to decrease the incidence of emer-\ngence agitation. The level of preoperative\nanxiety has been shown to be related to\nemergence delirium and postoperative\nKain20 demonstrated that 42% of children\ndisplayed distress during anaesthesia induc-\ntion. Premedication is widely used in paedi-\natric patients in order to provide sedation,\nreduce preoperative anxiety and improve the\nquality of induction. Lapin et al.21 observed\nthat children anaesthetized with sevoflurane\nwithout prior premedication had a 67%\nincidence of postoperative agitation.\nMcMillan et al.22 demonstrated that\n0.5 mg/kg midazolam orally was effective\npremedication that offered a good safety\nprofile. In the present study, all three groups\nwere given 0.5 mg/kg midazolam orally.\nMidazolam has been shown to provide\namnesia, reduce anxiety and decrease the\nTable 3.

The serum concentration\nof oral midazolam peaks at 53 min after oral\ningestion.27 Considering the length of the\noperation and the time taken for patient\ntransfer, the sedation period of midazolam\nmay not cover the postoperative period and\ntherefore may not prevent emergence\nagitation.\nSeveral studies have evaluated the effects\non emergence agitation of combining mid-\nNasal administration of premedication\ndrugs may be an alternative route to intra-\nvenous, subcutaneous, oral or rectal admin-\nistration in paediatric patients and may offer\nadvantages such as ease of administration\nand rapid onset.6,29 In the present study, the\nincidence of emergence agitation following\npremedication with midazolam alone was\nhigher than when midazolam was combined\nwith intranasal ketamine.\nKetamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate\nreceptor antagonist with opioid receptor\nactivity. It is highly lipid soluble and is\nrapidly absorbed after intranasal adminis-\ntration.7 Ketamine has been shown to be\neffective in reducing anxiety only when\nadministered in combination with midazo-\nlam.9 Warner et al.10 reported that a mid-\nazolam/ketamine mixture is more effective\nfor parental separation and mask accept-\nance than midazolam or ketamine alone.\nWeksler et al.6 reported that 6 mg/kg keta-\nmine provides effective premedication in\nchildren without delaying recovery time.\nHowever, premedication with 3 mg/kg keta-\nmine intranasally was reported to cause brief\ndesaturation periods in children.30 In the\npresent study, a low dose of nasal ketamine\nwas combined with midazolam to prevent\nemergence agitation and minimize adverse\neffects. The reason for the success of this\ncombination is probably related either to the\nprolongation of the elimination half-life of\nketamine31 or a simple additive effect as a\nresult of the interaction between midazolam\nIntranasal administration of fentanyl\nduring sevoflurane anaesthesia has been\nreported to be associated with decreased\nagitation, without an increase in the total\nhospital stay.32 Alfentanil, a rapid- and\nshort-acting synthetic analogue of fentanyl,\nappears to offer some clinically significant\nadvantages over fentanyl during outpatient\nanaesthesia.33 The use of alfentanil is asso-\nciated with fewer intraoperative side effects,\nsuch as respiratory depression and muscular\nrigidity, and a more rapid recovery time\ncompared with fentanyl.33 The maximal\nplasma concentration with intranasal alfen-\ntanil is reached within 9 min and the elimin-\nation half-life is short.34 The short half-life\nof nasal alfentanil may explain why it did\nnot prevent emergence agitation in the pre-\nsent study. However, the terminal half-life of\nnasal alfentanil (59.4 min) is similar to that\nof intravenous alfentanil (60 min).34 The\nadministration of 10 mg/kg alfentanil intra-\nvenously after induction of anaesthesia in\nchildren undergoing adenotonsillectomy\nreduced the incidence of emergence agita-\ntion without delaying the recovery time.35\nFurthermore, the combination of midazo-\nlam and alfentanil has been reported to\nsignificantly decrease the expected median\neffective dose required for hypnosis of both\ndrugs by 46%.36 In contrast, despite using a\ndose of 10 mg/kg, alfentanil did not decrease\nemergence agitation in the present study;\nthis is probably due to the reduced bioavail-\nability (64.9%) of alfentanil when given via\nIn the present study, nausea or vomiting\nwere more common in groups MA and MK\nthan in group MS, but these differences were\nnot statistically significant. However, both\nalfentanil and ketamine have the potential to\ncause nausea and vomiting, which may\nexplain the numerically higher incidence\nwith the combination therapies, compared\nwith midazolam alone.\nThe present study has a number of limi-\ntations. During the first 30 min of anaesthe-\nsia emergence only three consecutive PAED\nmeasurements were made, whereas other\nstudies have performed six measurements\nwithin this time period. In the present study\nchildren were continuously monitored in the\npostanaesthesia care unit; the PAED score\nwas measured three times and the highest\nvalue was used for statistical evaluation.\nAnother limitation is the lack of know-\nledge about changes in the median effective\ndoses of the drugs employed when used in\ncombination to control emergence agitation.\nIn conclusion, intranasal ketamine, in\naddition to oral midazolam premedication,\nsignificantly reduced sevoflurane-induced\nemergence agitation without delaying emer-\ngence or affecting the time to hospital\ndischarge, in children undergoing urosurgi-\ncal procedures.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or\nnot-for-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
