Elderly individuals with middle age\u00adonset\ndiabetes had a much greater burden of microvascular disease but have a similar burden of\nmacrovascular disease compared with individuals with elderly onset diabetes. Elderly indi-\nviduals with middle age\u00adonset diabetes had substantially worse glycemic control (propor-\ntion of individuals with HbA1c\nor nonelderly individuals with diabetes (55.3%). Individuals with elderly onset diabetes\nwere also less likely to be taking glucose-lowering medications.\nCONCLUSIONS -- In this study, we documented a high prevalence of diabetes among\nelderly individuals and high rate of poor glycemic control in this population. Individuals with\nmiddle age\u00ad and elderly onset diabetes appear to represent distinct groups with differing burdens\nof disease and possibly differing treatment goals. Future studies of diabetes in elderly individuals\nmay need to consider stratification based on age of diagnosis.\nThe number of individuals aged 65\nyears in the U.S. is increasing mark-\nedly. People aged 65 years repre-\nsented 12% of the U.S. population in\nportion is expected to grow to almost 20%\n(1). The aging U.S. population poses great\nchallenges to the health care system and\nclinical practice. Diabetes and its related\nproblems of obesity, insulin resistance,\nand impaired glucose tolerance are grow-\ning problems in the U.S. The cumulative\nlifetime incidence of diabetes is estimated\nto be 30% (2). Age is a known risk fac-\ntor for diabetes, but the epidemiology of\nthe disease among elderly individuals has\nnot been adequately characterized.\nThe objective of this study was to as-\nsess the prevalence of diabetes, distin-\nguishing between elderly individuals with\ndiabetes diagnosed in middle age (\"mid-\ndle age\u00adonset diabetes\") from elderly\nindividuals with recently diagnosed dia-\nbetes (\"elderly onset diabetes\"). We hy-\npothesized that the burden of micro- and\nmacrovascular disease and treatment of\ndiabetes would differ between these two\ngroups. A secondary aim of this study was\nto investigate whether management of\ncardiovascular risk factors also differed\nbetween these groups.\nMETHODS -- This study was based\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES), an ongoing cross-sectional\nsurvey of the civilian, noninstitutional-\nized population of the U.S. Detailed\nin-person interviews, physical examina-\ntions, and serum samples were obtained\n65 years who were not missing informa-\ntion on diabetes status.\nAssessment of diabetes\nThe NHANES standardized health exam-\ninations in the mobile examination cen-\nters (MEC) included measurement of\nheight, weight, and blood pressure and\ncollection of blood samples by trained\npersonnel. Diagnosed diabetes was de-\nfined as a self-reported physician diagno-\nsis. Individuals reporting \"borderline dia-\nbetes\" were considered nondiabetic. Age\nof diagnosis of diabetes was determined\nfrom the question, \"How old were you\nwhen a doctor or health professional first\ntold you that you had diabetes or sugar\ndiabetes?\" We defined individuals aged\n65 years as elderly. Elderly individuals\nwith diabetes diagnosed in middle age\nhaving middle age\u00adonset diabetes and el-\nderly individuals with recently diagnosed\ndiabetes, i.e., diabetes diagnosed at age\n65 years, were classified as having el-\nderly onset diabetes. Undiagnosed diabe-\ntes was defined as a fasting glucose 126\nmg/dl in the subsample of individuals\nwithout a diagnosis of diabetes who at-\ntended the morning examination session\nand were fasting 8 h.\n                                                \nFrom the 1Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore,\nMaryland; the 2Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins Univer-\nsity, Baltimore, Maryland; and the 3Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.\nAddress correspondence and reprint requests to Elizabeth Selvin, PhD, MPH, Welch Center for Preven-\ntion, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 2024 E.\nAbbreviations: ABI, ankle-brachial index; MEC, mobile examination center; NHANES, National Health\nand Nutrition Examination Survey.\nA table elsewhere in this issue shows conventional and Syste\n`me International (SI) units and conversion\nfactors for many substances.\n\u00a9 2006 by the American Diabetes Association.\nThe costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.

Smoking status was\ndetermined using answers to the ques-\ntions, \"Have you smoked at least 100 cig-\narettes in your life?\" and \"Do you now\nsmoke cigarettes?\" During the interview,\nparticipants were also asked questions re-\ngarding their history of cardiovascular\ndisease. For the purposes of this study,\nprevalent cardiovascular disease was de-\nfined as a self-reported history of coro-\nnary heart disease, a previous heart\nattack, or a history of stroke. Retinopa-\nthy was also determined by self-report\nand was only assessed in individuals\nwho reported a physician diagnosis of\ndiabetes.\nSubclinical peripheral artery disease\ncan be determined with high sensitivity\nand specificity using the ankle-brachial\nindex (ABI) (3,4). Ankle-brachial index\nmeasurements were obtained from\n40 years during the MEC exam. We de-\nfined peripheral arterial disease on the ba-\nsis of an ABI measurement 0.90 in\neither leg (5).\nPeripheral neuropathy was deter-\nmined via monofilament testing of foot\nsensation and examinations for foot ab-\nnormalities and lesions by trained health\ntechnicians during the MEC examination.\nPeripheral neuropathy was defined as one\nor more insensate areas in either foot.\nHypertension was defined as a mean\nsystolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg , a\nmean diastolic blood pressure of 90\nmmHg, or a reporting of a physician di-\nagnosis of high blood pressure. Mean\nblood pressure comprised up to four\nreadings on two separate occasions. Hy-\npertensive individuals who reported\nbeing prescribed medication for hyper-\ntension were categorized as having\ntreated hypertension. Total cholesterol\nwas measured enzymatically (6). Hyper-\ncholesterolemia was defined as a total\ncholesterol level 240 mg/dl, self-reports\nof a physician diagnosis of \"high choles-\nterol,\" or self-reports that a physician had\nadvised taking a cholesterol-lowering\nmedication. Individuals who reported\nhaving been prescribed treatment for high\ncholesterol were categorized as having\ntreated hypercholesterolemia.

SEs for all estimates were\nobtained using the Taylor series (linear-\nization) method (6).\nRESULTS\nPrevalence of diabetes in elderly\nindividuals\nAmong adults aged 65, the prevalence\nof diagnosed diabetes was 15.3% (SE\nsus population, this represents 5.4 mil-\nlion individuals.

The mean age of elderly individuals\nwith middle age\u00adonset diabetes was 72\ncompared with 77 among individuals\nwith elderly onset diabetes. African Amer-\nicans were also disproportionately repre-\nsented among the middle age\u00ad onset\nelderly diabetes group. Mean BMI and\nwaist circumference were similar among\nindividuals with middle age\u00adonset and\nelderly onset diabetes.\nTreatment characteristics\nAs shown in Table 2, mean fasting glucose\nwas higher among elderly individuals\nwith middle age\u00adonset diabetes com-\npared with elderly onset diabetes (172.4\nderly individuals with middle age\u00adonset\ndiabetes had higher fasting glucose values\nbetic individuals (mean fasting glucose \nserved for glycemic control, as measured\n(A1C).

Of middle age\u00ad\nonset elderly diabetic subjects, 31.7%\nwere currently receiving insulin alone\ncompared with 6.9% of the elderly onset\ntivariable logistic regression model, these\ndifferences in medication use were not ex-\nplained by age, sex, race, education, cog-\nnitive function, or measures of physical\nfunctioning (analysis not shown).\nBurden of micro- and macrovascular\ndisease\nA history of stroke, coronary heart dis-\nease, and any cardiovascular disease were\nsimilar among the middle age\u00ad and el-\nderly onset diabetic subjects aged 65\nyears. As might be expected, both of these\ngroups had a substantially higher burden\nof cardiovascular disease compared with\nnonelderly diabetic subjects; any form of\ncardiovascular disease was more than\ntwice as common among elderly than\namong nonelderly diabetic subjects. Pe-\nripheral arterial disease determined on\nthe basis of a low ABI was similar in the\ntwo elderly diabetic groups but was sub-\nstantially higher than the prevalence\namong elderly individuals without diabe-\ntes or with middle age\u00adonset diabetes.\nWhereas the prevalence of chronic kidney\ndisease and peripheral neuropathy were\nsimilar among elderly individuals with\nmiddle age\u00ad and elderly onset diabetes,\nthe prevalence of retinopathy was sub-\nstantially higher in the middle aged\u00ad\n0.001). As will be discussed below, these\nprevalence estimates probably reflect the\ndifferential survival of the elderly individ-\nuals in the middle age\u00ad and elderly onset\ndiabetic groups. Nonetheless, because the\ncut point of age 65 years to define elderly\nindividuals is essentially arbitrary, we\nconducted sensitivity analyses to assess\nthe impact of this definition. Similar re-\nsults were obtained using other cut points\nindividuals as elderly (data not shown).\nControl of cardiovascular risk\nfactors\nWe also compared control of cardiovas-\ncular risk factors (hypertension, choles-\nterol, and smoking) across diabetes status\nin the nonelderly and elderly populations.\nHypertension was extremely common\n(80% prevalence) in elderly individuals\nwith middle age\u00ad and elderly onset diabe-\ntes; however, elderly individuals with\nmiddle age\u00adonset diabetes were more\nlikely to be treated than elderly onset di-\n0.001).

Smoking rates\nin elderly onset and middle age\u00adonset el-\nderly diabetic subjects were similar (10.0\nthose in nonelderly individuals, who had\na current smoking prevalence of 24% in\nboth the diabetic and nondiabetic groups.\nCONCLUSIONS -- This study pro-\nvides an overall picture of the character-\nistics of individuals with middle age\u00ad\nonset and elderly onset diabetes and the\nburden of microvascular and macrovas-\ncular disease and control of risk factors in\nthese groups. Our overarching conclu-\nsion is that elderly individuals with mid-\ndle age\u00ad and elderly onset diabetes\nrepresent distinct groups with differing\nburdens of disease and possibly differing\ntreatment goals. Treatment of diabetes\ndiffered considerably between these two\ngroups, and A1C levels were significantly\nhigher in individuals with middle age\u00ad\nonset diabetes. Elderly individuals with\nmiddle age\u00adonset diabetes were more\nlikely to be treated for hypertension and\nhypercholesterolemia than elderly onset\ndiabetic subjects; however, mean systolic\nblood pressure values and mean total cho-\nlesterol levels were similar in elderly indi-\nviduals with middle age\u00ad onset and\nelderly onset diabetes, suggesting that el-\nderly individuals may actually require less\ntreatment to remain in control of cardio-\nvascular risk factors.\nPrevious studies of diabetes in elderly\nindividuals have not distinguished be-\ntween individuals with diabetes who were\ndiagnosed at younger ages and those with\nelderly onset diabetes. It has been stated\nthat \"very few older people truly have new\nonset diabetes\" (7). Ostensibly, because\nthere are no clear screening recommenda-\ntions for diabetes in elderly individuals\nand because symptoms may be less recog-\nnizable or lacking, detection of new-onset\ndiabetes in elderly individuals regardless\nof its presence may be uncommon. None-\ntheless, because NHANES obtained fast-\ning glucose measurements from\nparticipants, we were able to estimate the\nprevalence of undiagnosed diabetes\namong elderly individuals. We found that\n6.9% of elderly individuals had undiag-\nnosed diabetes, representing 2.4 mil-\nlion individuals in the U.S. population.\nFew data on the actual incidence of new-\nonset diabetes in elderly individuals exist,\nand our understanding of the epidemiol-\nogy and natural history of this condition is\npoor. The information presented here\nsuggests that the two groups are distinct\nand speaks to the need to consider elderly\nindividuals with diabetes diagnosed in\nmiddle age differently from individuals\nwith elderly onset diabetes.\nThe substantial difference in age be-\ntween the middle age\u00adonset and elderly\nonset diabetic subjects (5 year differ-\nence) probably reflects a \"survival effect\"\nin these cross-sectional data. That is,\nthose individuals with middle age\u00adonset\ndiabetes are more likely to die at younger\nTable 2--Selected clinical characteristics of middle aged and elderly adults with and without diabetes, NHANES 1999\u00ad2002\nNo diabetes Diabetes No diabetes\nMiddle age\u00adonset\ndiabetes\nElderly onset\ndiabetes P value*\nYears since diagnosis of diabetes\nGlucose-lowering medication use\nData are proportions  SE unless otherwise indicated. *P value for the comparison between the elderly middle age\u00adonset and elderly onset diabetes groups.\nEstimate has a relative SE 30%. Question was only asked in individuals with diagnosed diabetes.\nDiabetes in elderly individuals\nages compared with individuals with el-\nderly onset diabetes who, by definition,\nmust be aged 65 years when diabetes is\ndiagnosed. This may also explain why the\nburden of cardiovascular disease was sim-\nilar between the groups. By definition,\nduration of diabetes also differed consid-\nerably in the two groups, reflected in the\nsignificantly higher prevalence of retinop-\nathy in the middle age\u00adonset diabetic\ngroup. In this cross-sectional study, we\ncould not rigorously address how dura-\ntion of diabetes contributed to the ob-\nserved differences. Indeed, we lacked\ndata on the timing of disease develop-\nment, and we could not characterize the\nprogression from impaired glucose toler-\nance to undiagnosed diabetes in this pop-\nulation. This is an inherent weakness in\nthese cross-sectional survey data. The\npresence of a survival effect highlights the\nneed for prospective epidemiologic\nstudies to examine the natural history of\ndiabetes in the elderly population. Addi-\ntionally, because self-reported informa-\ntion was used for determination of a\nhistory of cardiovascular disease and ret-\ninopathy, we may have underestimated\nthe burden of these conditions in this\npopulation.\nCurrent clinical guidelines for the\ntreatment of hypertension (Seventh Re-\nport of the Joint National Committee on\nPrevention, Detection, Evaluation, and\nTreatment of High Blood Pressure [JNC\n7]) recommend explicitly that the same\nprinciples outlined for the general care of\nhypertension should be followed for\nolder individuals. Hypertension occurs in\nmore than two-thirds of elderly individu-\nals, and multiple drugs are often needed\nto achieve recommended blood pressure\ngoals. Nonetheless, these guidelines cau-\ntion that orthostatic hypotension is a risk\nin individuals with diabetes and in elderly\nindividuals, especially when multiple\nmedications are used. The American Dia-\nbetes Association and the American Geri-\natrics Society additionally recommend\nthat that blood pressure should be low-\nered gradually to avoid complications in\nelderly hypertensive patients with diabe-\ntes (8,9), but no specific recommenda-\ntions have been made regarding during\nwhat period of time blood pressure\nshould be lowered. Subgroup analyses of\nclinical trial data of statin therapies sup-\nport lipid control in elderly individuals at\nhigh risk for cardiovascular disease (10\u00ad\n13), but there are limited data specifically\nfor elderly patients with diabetes. Current\ndiabetes treatment guidelines recom-\nmend aggressive lipid control in all pa-\ntients with diabetes but do not make\nspecific recommendations for elderly\nindividuals.\nHigher glycemic goals may also be ap-\npropriate for individuals with severe or\nfrequent hypoglycemia, a common prob-\nlem for elderly individuals. Citing the lack\nof clinical trial data in elderly patients, the\nAmerican Diabetes Association recom-\nmends that \"less stringent treatment\ngoals\" may be appropriate in elderly pa-\ntients. The Merck Manual of Geriatrics (14)\nrecommends a glycemic goal of A1C\n7% for all elderly patients but states that\n\"most elderly patients can be treated as\naggressively as younger patients, but\nsome require modifications based on\ntheir life expectancy, functional status,\ncognitive abilities, preferences, and mul-\ntiple other factors.\"\nIn this study, we document a high\nprevalence of diabetes in the elderly pop-\nulation and a high rate of poor glycemic\ncontrol regardless of age of diagnosis.\nData and rigorous studies of new-onset\ndiabetes in elderly subjects are needed to\ncharacterize the natural history of diabe-\ntes in the elderly population, and future\nresearchers on diabetes in elderly individ-\nuals may need to consider stratification\nbased on age of diabetes diagnosis.\n"
