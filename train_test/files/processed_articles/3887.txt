The detection rate is the percentage\nof patients confirmed to have colonic\npolyp(s) out of the entire study group that\nwas examined. The detection rate is of\nlimited value if the incidence of colonic\npolyps in the population of interest is not\nknown. However, it is very useful when\ncomparing the efficacy of two or more\nimaging modalities in a single population\nor in multiple similar populations. The false-\nnegative rate of optical colonoscopy (OC)\nfor detecting colorectal polyps was 28% in a\nrecent prospective multicentre study.1 There\nis evidence to suggest, based on the records\nat a cancer registry, that there is an even\nhigher false-negative rate in the right colon.2\nUnfortunately, high false-negative rates\nor low detection rates for detecting colorec-\ntal polyps/cancers of !1.0 cm also plague\nother colonic imaging modalities. For exam-\nple, computed tomography colonography\n(CTC) and magnetic resonance colonogra-\nphy (MRC) both have a false-negative rate\nand a higher false-negative rate for polyps of\n!0.3 cm.3,4 The false-negative rates of the\nusual variety of double-contrast barium\nenema (DCBE) and high-density DCBE\nvary widely. DCBE is generally believed to\nbe the most sensitive radiological method in\ndetecting colonic polyps. However, a study\nof a group of 104 patients, all of whom had\nnegative DCBE, reported that >50 sub-\ncentimetre polyps had been detected and\nremoved from the patients.5 This was indi-\ncative of a false-negative rate for DCBE of\n100% for the detection of colonic polyps of\n0.9 cm in the patients in this study.5 In\naddition, both types of DCBE are very\nunpleasant procedures and are poorly toler-\nated by patients. The commonly used variety\nof single-contrast barium enema (SCBE)\nand high-voltage SCBE have very low detec-\ntion rates for polyps of all sizes.6,7\nCombined DCBE and SCBE is useful in\nonly a very small proportion of patients.8\nCapsule endoscopy has a sensitivity of 88%\n(equivalent to a false-negative rate of 12%)\nfor detecting colorectal polyps of !1.0 cm.9\nThe swallowed capsule may not be excreted\nknown technique used at the Mayo Clinic in\nRochester, MN, USA,11 which consists of\nan SCBE with continuous fluoroscopy and\nvigorous manual palpation of the colon in\nthe profile projection (with the hand of the\nexaminer for palpation inside a lead glove).\nThe false-negative rate of the Mayo Clinic\ntechnique in detecting colonic polyps of\nauthors reported that ``All 29 polyps 1 cm or\nlarger were seen on barium enema.''11 This\nfinding indicated a false-negative rate of 0%\nfor detecting colonic polyps of !1.0 cm.\nIn view of the recently established high\nfalse-negative rate of OC1,2 and the draw-\nbacks of the other colonic imaging modal-\nities, this present study was undertaken to\ntest the hypothesis that whenever OC cannot\nbe easily or promptly undertaken, the\nmodified Mayo Clinic (MMC) technique\ncan offer a reasonable alternative for the\ndetection of colonic polyps.\nPatients and methods\nPatient population\nThe design of this prospective study followed\nthe STARD recommendations.12 Consecu-\ntive patients examined at Chinatown X-Ray\n& Ultrasound, Vancouver, BC, Canada were\nlation from English to the patient's native\nlanguage was undertaken by the examiner, a\nstaff member or a relative who was fluent in\nthat language. In the first stage of selection,\nall adults !18 years old at an average or\nincreased risk of colorectal cancers were\nenrolled in the study (e.g. family history of\ncolorectal cancer, positive faecal immuno-\nchemical test [FIT], change in bowel habits,\nrectal bleeding, abdominal pain). No\npatients had a known diagnosis of inflam-\nmatory bowel disease, which would be a\ncause for exclusion. Pregnancy and referral\nfrom hospitals/nursing homes/correctional\ninstitutions were also reasons for exclusion.\nEthics permission was not applied for\nbecause the technique (barium enema) is\nfirmly established and is still currently in use\nin many countries worldwide. Written\ninformed consent was obtained from each\nstudy participant.\nImaging technique\nPatient preparation consisted of ingestion of\na clear liquid diet and oral polyethylene\nglycol 3350 (Colyte\u00d5; Alaven Pharmaceuti-\ncal, Marietta, GA, USA) colonic lavage on\nthe day prior to the examination. A barium\nsuspension of 35% W/V (E-Z-EM Polibar\nPlus 105% W/V diluted with water;\nE-Z-EM, Lake Success, NY, USA) was\nused as the contrast medium. The fluoro-\nscopic unit was a GE Advantx\u00d5 RF system\nwith a Digital Radiography System (GE\nHealthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). This\nsystem replaced the use of radiographic\nfilms. Images were stored in and retrieved\nfrom computer systems. The examination\nused the MMC technique, which was an\nadaptation of the Mayo Clinic technique to\nmake it less strenuous for the examiner.\nMore importantly, a limited DCBE that\nmainly targeted the rectum was added,\nrendering the supplementary proctoscopy\nin the original technique unnecessary. The\nMMC technique began with an examination\nof the left colon (splenic flexure through to\nthe rectum). A digital rectal examination\nwas performed with the patient in the left\ndecubitus position. Barium suspension was\nthen administered rectally by drip infusion\nto just beyond the splenic flexure. Under\nintermittent fluoroscopy, meticulous inch-\nby-inch deep compression with a radiology\npneumatic compression paddle was applied\nto the left colon in the profile projection. The\ncompression is deep enough that the anter-\nior wall briefly `kisses' the posterior wall.\nThe sigmoid colon was also compressed in\nthe oblique projections. A limited DCBE\nwas later performed targeting mainly the\nrectum (see below). For examining the right\ncolon (caecum through to the transverse\ncolon), barium suspension was further\nadministered to just beyond the hepatic\nflexure. Inch-by-inch deep compression was\nsimilarly applied to the right colon. In most\npatients, there was insufficient barium sus-\npension in the caecum at this stage. Ancil-\nlary compression of the caecum was later\nperformed (see below). Spot images were\nobtained for documentation if lesions were\ndetected or for further viewing if suspicious\nchanges were seen. The colon was drained\nbriefly and air introduced until the sigmoid\nwas optimally distended. Intentional disten-\nsion of the right colon was not undertaken.\nOblique spot images of the sigmoid were\noptionally obtained. The fluoroscopic table\nwas tilted to just short of the upright pos-\nition and an en face spot image of the splenic\nflexure routinely obtained. This was under-\ntaken because compressing this segment\ncan often be difficult. The table was then\nlowered to 30 above the horizontal, ancil-\nlary compression of the caecum was per-\nformed in the profile and oblique\nprojections. The table was returned to the\nhorizontal position and the patient turned to\nthe left decubitus position. Brief fluoroscopy\nwas used to see if there was excess barium\nsuspension in the rectum. If present, the\nsuspension was drained and air reintro-\nduced. The patient was then turned to the\nprone position for overhead images. These\nincluded a caudad angled view of the recto-\nsigmoid, a cross-table lateral view of the\nrectum and both decubitus views of the\nabdomen with the entire rectum included in\nthe field of view. A postevacuation image\nwas obtained at the discretion of the\nexaminer.\nThe maximal diameters of any right or\nleft colonic mass lesions were obtained by\ncomparing with a 1.0 cm metal bar at a level\n10 cm above the table top of the fluoroscopic\nunit. All colonic mass lesions were measured\non the spot images. Rectal mass lesions were\nmeasured on the overhead images. When the\nlesion was seen in two or more images, the\nmeasurement was made in the image with\nthe least magnification. In the second stage\nof selection, patients who refused OC or\nthose who had isolated lesions in the rectum\nwere excluded from the study. Patients with\nmass lesions in the right or left colon (except\nthe rectum) were further assessed using OC\nas the gold standard. If the MMC imaging\nwas indicative of `carcinoma', then the sub-\nsequent OC was performed within 2\u00ad3 weeks\nby the gastroenterologists at either St Paul's\nHospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada or\nVancouver Hospital & Health Sciences\nCentre, Vancouver, BC, Canada. If the\nMMC imaging was indicative of a polyp\n(irrespective of size), the OC was usually\nperformed within 6 months and very occa-\nsionally 9 months. However, patients on the\nwaiting list for OC who just had a positive\nmonths for their OC examination. In the\nthird stage of selection, patients who had an\nincomplete OC were also excluded from the\nanalysis.\nThe pain level experienced by the patient\nduring the procedure was assessed using a 0\u00ad\nimum pain). The level was ascertained and\nrecorded by the examiner just prior to\nevacuation. Any complaints or positive\ncomments made by the patient were also\nrecorded by the examiner.\nStatistical analyses\nThe detection rate of polyp/cancer of\n!0.3 cm and the false-negative rate of\npolyp/cancer of !1.0 cm were calculated\nmanually. For statistical analysis regarding\npolyp/cancer of !0.3 cm, the MedCalc pro-\ngram, version 13.1 (MedCalc Software,\nOstend, Belgium) was used. Diagnostic test\nevaluation was undertaken using the\nMedCalc program. Fisher's exact test with\nYates' correction was used to compare\nfrequencies. A P-value <0.05 was con-\nsidered statistically significant.\nResults\nA total of 142 patients were examined using\nthe MMC technique. The median age was 60\nyears and the mean age was 61.3 years\npatients commented there was little discom-\nfort and stated they were very satisfied with\nthe procedure. There were no complaints\nfrom the patients about the procedure.\nTwenty-six (18.3%) patients were found to\nhave colorectal mass lesions of !0.3 cm\nusing the MMC technique. Four patients\nrefused OC and three patients with isolated\nrectal mass lesions were excluded. One\npatient with an incomplete OC was also\nexcluded. Eighteen patients underwent com-\nplete OC (Figure 1). Fourteen of these\npatients were confirmed by OC to have\npolyp/cancer of !0.3 cm in the colon\n(excluding the rectum); this was the equiva-\nseven polyps of !1.0 cm confirmed by OC\n(in addition to two cancers) were detected\nwith the MMC technique.\nIt was evident that some of the right\ncolons had positive results and some had\nnegative results with the MMC technique;\nthe same was true for the left colons.\nTherefore, a more detailed analysis of the\ndetection of colonic masses in the right and\nleft colons in 18 patients (n \u00bc 36) using the\nMMC technique compared with OC was\nundertaken (Table 1). The mean \u00c6 SD\nsize (i.e. maximum diameter) of the mass\nlesions that were detected by the MMC\nmeasured during OC. It was also evident\nfrom the data in Table 1 that there were 14\ntrue positives and 4 false positives; there\nwere 2 false negatives and 16 true negatives.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of the MMC\ntechnique for detecting colonic polyps/can-\nively.

There were no complications or\nadverse events reported during the MMC\ntechnique. All patients had a preparation\ntime of 1 day. The recuperation time was\nnegligible. The median pain level was 1 and\nthe mean pain level was 1.2 (range 0\u00ad6) on\nthe verbal pain scale, as reported by the\nentire group of 142 patients.

There is often excess\nfluid in the colon after oral polyethylene\ncolon adversely affects imaging examin-\nations of the colon except dark-lumen\nMRC4 and the MMC technique. On the\ncontrary, excess fluid decreases the density of\nthe barium suspension in the right colon and\ntends to lessen the effort required in examin-\ning the caecum and ascending colon. No\nintravenous contrast or parenteral medica-\ntion is necessary for the MMC technique.\nThe radiation dose is estimated to be com-\nparable with or lower than low-dose 64-slide\nCTC. It is common knowledge that some\npatients find colonic examinations unpleas-\nant. Only rarely do they voice satisfaction\nabout the test. The low score in the verbal\npain scale and the large number of patients\nwho related positive comments about the\nexamination provided strong evidence that\nthe discomfort level was low and the test was\nwell tolerated by the patients examined using\nthe MMC technique in this present study.\nThe MMC technique can easily be mastered\nby radiology residents. Many of the exam-\ninations using the original Mayo Clinic\ntechnique were performed by radiology resi-\ndents. Technically, the MMC technique\nshould be far easier to master than the\ncommonly used DCBE or high-density\nDCBE. In addition, the MMC technique\nmay well be the present-day answer to the\nquestion \u00ad What next? \u00ad posed in 2008 by\nRex (Indianapolis, IN, USA).22 The ultimate\nimaging test for colonic polyp/cancer in the\nfuture may be a variety of positron emission\ntomography/magnetic resonance imaging\nscan, but the radionuclide will need to have\na suitable half-life and be able to enhance\nadenomatous polyps and carcinoids with-\nout enhancing normal colonic mucosa\nor inflammatory polyps; hyperplastic and\nhamartomatous polyps are enhanced\nonly if high-grade dysplasia is present.\nHowever, the time required to develop a\nradionuclide with these properties may be\nIn conclusion, the MMC technique may\nprovide an alternative screening method for\nthe detection of colorectal polyps. This may\nbe advantageous where there are ever-\nincreasing healthcare costs and long waiting\nlists for OC, as in Canada, as well as in\ndeveloping countries where there is a paucity\nof gastroenterologists and CT scanners.\nFurther studies are required, but if a com-\nparable false-negative rate for detecting\ncolonic polyps of !1.0 cm can be repro-\nduced consistently, then the widespread use\nof this technique might plausibly bring\nabout a significant reduction in the number\nof deaths from colon cancer in North\nAmerica, and perhaps in developing coun-\ntries as well.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe author declares that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\n"
