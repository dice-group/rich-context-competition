Recent work at the\nmacro-level has observed substitution between these two\ncategories over time (Dalton, 2008), while individual-level\nanalysis has suggested a positive correlation (Oser, 2016).\nHowever, the causal relationship between these two forms\nof participation remains unclear. Does engaging in one type\ncause more or less of the other type? As a practical matter,\ncan organizations leverage prior activity in one category to\ninduce the other?\nNonprofit organizations provide a useful context for\nstudying causal relationships within the political toolkit\n(Han, 2016). These organizations can facilitate electoral\nparticipation through voter mobilization efforts (LeRoux\nand Krawczyk, 2014). In addition, nonprofits often experi-\nment with different kinds of appeals to induce a wide range\nof non-electoral actions (Han, 2009). Furthermore, some of\nthe most effective appeals establish a relational context by\nlinking current requests to prior behavior (Han, 2016).\nistered voters to better understand who participates in mod-\nern forms of civic engagement and what kinds of appeals\nare most effective. The results of an online field experiment\nyielded two main results. Subjects who voted in the 2016\nprimary elections were nearly three times more likely to\nengage with a survey distributed by a civic organization\nthan those who did not vote in the primary election.\nHowever, explicitly priming voter identity and gratitude\nmade all subjects far less likely to engage in this form of\ncivic participation. These results may offer some practical\nwisdom to nonprofit organizations and improve our under-\nstanding of how voters manage their political toolkits.\nExperimental design\nA field experiment was conducted in collaboration with a\npro-housing civic organization in San Francisco, California.\nThe organization designed a survey to measure public opin-\nion about issues affecting the community and wanted to\nmaximize participation.

This design did not\ncontrol for information spillovers between multiple units in\nthe same household (Coppock, 2014), although interference\nshould bias against significant treatment effects.\nThe survey was distributed via email using a fully\n\u00d7 between-subjects factorial design.

The voter gratitude manipulation occurred in\nthe first line in the body of the email: treated subjects were\nthanked for being a registered voter in San Francisco\n(Panagopoulos, 2011), while subjects in the control condi-\ntion were again asked what was important to them.\nCrucially, this control condition did not include any addi-\ntional language that was not already contained by the treat-\nment condition.\nThe outcome variable measured whether the subject\nclicked the link embedded in the email to open the survey.\nSince survey responses were anonymous, it was not possi-\nble to match this click rate with survey completion rates.\nHowever, it is expected that treatment assignment had no\neffect on the probability of completing the survey given\nthat the subject had already clicked to open the survey.\nResults\nThe voter file contained information about subjects' party\nidentification, age, and whether they voted in the 2016 pri-\nmary election that occurred two months prior to the experi-\nment.1 Figure 1 explores which of these characteristics were\nassociated with higher click rates. The most striking result is\nthat subjects who voted in the primary election were nearly\nthree times as likely to open the survey than non-voters.\nThis result may reflect the fact that participatory citizens\ntend to embrace both non-institutionalized and electoral-\noriented activities (Oser, 2016), or that voters are more\nlikely to contribute to public goods (Bolsen et al., 2014).\nFigure 2 reports the results associated with the experi-\nmental manipulations. Surprisingly, subjects in all three\ntreatment conditions were about 40% less likely to open the\nsurvey than subjects in the control condition ( p = 0.000).2\nThis result is even more remarkable given the relatively\nlow baseline, as floor effects should have biased against\nfinding significant treatment effects. Floor effects may,\nhowever, explain why the identity and gratitude manipula-\ntions did not appear to have an additive effect on click rates.\nWhat explains this decrease in civic engagement? Since\nthe manipulations conflated voter identity and gratitude\nwith politics more generally, one explanation could be that\nsubjects are simply averse to politics. This mechanism\nseems unlikely since all subjects are registered voters who\nvolunteered their email addresses during the registration\nprocess. Furthermore, if the main effect was driven by an\naversion to politics, then this effect should be smaller for\nsubjects with higher levels of interest in politics. Instead,\ntreatment effects were significant and just as large for sub-\njects who voted in the primary election as those who did not\nvote. In fact, the voter identity treatment effect was slightly\nlarger for primary voters.\nA separate but related mechanism is voter fatigue. The\nexperiment was conducted three months before a general\nelection in a state that include several propositions on the\nballot. Therefore, treated subjects may have exhausted their\ncapacity to engage in electoral politics and potentially mis-\nconstrued the email as one about the general election. This\nmechanism is consistent with the larger treatment effect\nobserved among primary voters.\nAlternatively, the priming of past voting behavior may\nhave caused a boost in self-concept that subsequently ena-\nbled treated subjects to feel \"licensed\" to dismiss addi-\ntional requests to take costly civic action (Merritt et al.,\n2010). This mechanism would also be consistent with\nlarger treatment effects among primary voters, although\nFigure 1. Predictors of online civic engagement.

These point estimates\nwere derived from a logistic regression of the outcome variable\non all covariates and condition fixed effects.\nFigure 2. Treatment effects on online civic engagement.

These data cannot fully distinguish between the\nvoter fatigue and licensing mechanisms because self-con-\ncept was not measured directly.\nDiscussion\nThis paper explored whether voting influences civic\nengagement outside the electoral process. The results of an\nvoters in San Francisco yielded two main results. First, sub-\njects who voted in the recent primary election were far\nmore likely to open a survey from a nonprofit organization\nthan those who did not vote in the primary election.\nHowever, at least one attempt to explicitly leverage prior\nvoting behavior had negative unintended consequences.\nPriming voter identity and gratitude made subjects far less\nlikely to engage in this form of non-electoral participation.\nThe results of this experiment may offer practical wisdom\nto nonprofit organizations looking to improve the effective-\nness of their appeals. Of course, these data were generated by\na unique sample of registered voters at a particular time in the\nelectoral cycle. In addition, interacting with a survey distrib-\nuted by a nonprofit organization is hardly representative of all\nforms of non-electoral civic engagement. Therefore, addi-\ntional research is needed to evaluate the generalizability of\nthese results. Future work should continue to explore the con-\nditions under which citizens construe the various items in\ntheir political toolkits as complements or substitutes.\n"
