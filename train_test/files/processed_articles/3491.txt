    "abstract": "Abstract\nTranslating the Holy Quran is a challenging task. However, it is a necessity due to the large number of Muslims who do\nnot speak Arabic. To date, various translations are available for nonnative speakers of Arabic. These translations, however,\nhave revealed complete and partial translation losses. One type of such losses is grammatical loss, which sometimes occurs\ndue to differences between the source text (ST) and the target text (TT). This study aimed at investigating the grammatical\nlosses in the translation of the Holy Quran, with special reference to Surah Al A'araf, and the extent these losses cause\npartial or complete semantic loss. Qualitative descriptive approach was adopted to analyze the data extracted from Abdel\nHaleem's English translation of Surah Al A'araf. The study revealed losses occurring in translating grammatical aspects such\nas conjunctions, syntactic order, duality, tense, and verbs. It was also found that grammatical losses contributed to semantic\nlosses, which are mostly partial semantic losses of the connotative or the expressive meanings. However, some of the\nidentified grammatical losses were found to cause complete semantic losses. This study suggests that appropriate translation\nstrategies be adopted to reduce loss in the translation.\n",

A\ntranslator's attempt in attaining form usually makes attaining\nmeaning more difficult (Rendall, 1997), and thus a translator\nmostly needs to either sacrifice form or meaning. In other\nwords, a translator can rarely succeed in preserving both\nform and meaning, in particular, in cases of two dissipate\nlanguages, such as Arabic and English. Such a problem is\nrelated to the question of what contributes to a good transla-\ntion (Schulte, 2002), which is reflected in the different defi-\nnitions of translation. Nida and Taber (1974), for example,\ndefined translation as reproducing the message of the source\nlanguage (SL) in a target language (TL) while keeping equiv-\nalent meaning and style. Style, in this sense, may refer to\ngrammatical and syntactic patterns. For example, in Arabic,\nthe style is to foreground the most important and background\nthe least important in a certain context. This is not the case in\nEnglish, as there are fixed grammatical rules which require,\nfor instance, a subject to go before the verb or the object.\nAnother definition of translation was proposed by Newmark\n(1988), who defined translation as producing an approxi-\nmate equivalent of two languages at different levels, among\nwhich thought and linguistic form are the most important.\nNewmark's definition is similar to that of Nida and Taber,\nas they also underscored the importance of linguistic form\nequivalence. On the contrary, Catford (1965) viewed transla-\ntion as the replacement of textual material in one language\n(SL) by equivalent textual material in another language (TL).\nThese definitions of translation mostly highlight two main\nconcepts: meaning and linguistic form, which resulted in\nthe emergence of different schools of thoughts on transla-\ntion that revolve around meaning and form. For example,\nLarson (1984) differentiated between meaning-based trans-\nlation and form-based translation. In a similar vein, Catford\n(1965) believed that full equivalence in meaning and form in\nthe target text (TT) cannot always be fully achieved as it is\n1Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia\nCorresponding Author:\nNoureldin Mohamed Abdelaal, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang,\nEmail: nourabdelal@yahoo.com\nGrammar-Related Semantic Losses in\nthe Translation of the Holy Quran, with\nSpecial Reference to Surah Al A'araf\n(The Heights)\nNoureldin Mohamed Abdelaal1 and Sabariah Md Rashid1\n Keywords\ngrammatical loss, semantic loss, translation, the Holy Quran, Surah Al A'araf\n2 SAGE Open\ndifficult to transfer the form and meaning from a SL into a\nTL. Related to this is what is explained by Nida (1975), who\nexplained that a translator may not encode a message accu-\nrately when translating texts between two different cultures.\nIn this light, the main concern in translation is ensuring that\nthe form and meaning between the SL and TL are equivalent.\nNewmark (1988), for instance, stated that problems in\ntranslation could occur in grammar or lexicon. Much ear-\nlier, Ervin and Bower (1952) argued that distortion of mean-\ning in translation could result from lexical, syntactical, or\ncultural differences between languages. Correspondingly,\nin translation could result from differences between lan-\nguages in terms of syntactic, semantic, lexical, phonological,\nand morphological features. Thus, it seems that grammatical\nequivalence between a source text (ST) and a TT is not less\nimportant than lexical equivalence.\nThe lack of equivalence problems at the grammatical\nlevel may also cause challenges for a translator, especially\nwhen he translates from Arabic to English. Arabic is a unique\nlanguage in its style and is completely different from English\nin many of its features. The challenge becomes greater when\nthe ST is the Holy Quran, which is a sacred book that is\nsought to be rendered as closely as possible to the authentic\nmeaning in the ST. Translating the Holy Quran seems to be\nmore challenging due to its being a sacred book, and due to\nits unique language, which is the words of Allah Almighty.\nFurthermore, the Holy Quran language has attributes which\nmake it challenging to translate the form and sense from the\nST to the TT.\nTo date, some studies have addressed the phenomenon of\nsyntactic and semantic problems in the translation of some\nayahs in the Holy Quran (e.g., Abdelaal & Md Rashid, 2015;\nKhalaf & Yusoff, 2012). Studies have also been done on\ncertain syntactic aspects. For example, Al-Ghazalli (2012)\nfocused on the translation of the trilateral verbs in the Holy\nQuran. Some studies have focused on certain aspects of\nthe text in the Holy Quran. However, these studies did not\nexhaustively investigate the different grammatical losses in\nthe translation of the Holy Quran, and they did not either\ninvestigate the extent these grammatical losses contribute to\nthe loss in the meaning conveyed, that is, the grammatical\nlosses in the translation of the Holy Quran resulting in com-\nplete semantic losses or partial semantic losses.\nComplete semantic losses may result from grammatical\nlosses when the ST meaning is distorted or improperly con-\nveyed in the TT as a result of such a grammatical loss. Partial\nsemantic losses, on the contrary, may result from grammati-\ncal losses when the ST primary meaning is conveyed, while\nsome other shades of meaning are lost in the TT due to such\na grammatical loss.\nThis study adopts Hervey and Higgins's (1992) percep-\ntion of loss, in which they state that loss is \"an important\ncorollary of this concept of translation loss is that it embraces\nany failure to replicate a ST exactly, whether this involves\nlosing features in the TT or adding them\" (p. 24). Thus, what\nmay be considered as gain by other theorists and scholars of\ntranslation is not adopted in this study.\nObjectives of the Study\nThis study aims to identify the grammatical losses in Abdel\nHaleem's translation of Surah Al A'araf, and their contri-\nbution to creating semantic losses. Following Hervey and\nHiggins's (1992) definition of translation loss as failure to\nreplicate the ST exactly through omission or addition, gram-\nmatical losses refer to any improper use of grammar compo-\nnents such as articles, prepositions, gender, aspect and tense,\nplurality, and duality. The improper use can be in terms of\naddition or deletion, which is likely to occur due to lack of\nequivalence problem as highlighted by Baker (2011), or due\nto the translator's failure to select the appropriate equivalent.\nThe study specifically aims at the following:\n1. To identify the grammatical losses in Abdel Haleem's\ntranslation of Surah Al A'araf\n2. To identify the extent these grammatical losses con-\ntribute to partial or complete semantic losses.\nLiterature Review\nIn his study of the lexical gap in the translation of the Quranic\nverb, /kada/, Al-Utbi (2011) highlighted how the transla-\ntion failed to find equivalents of the verb  due to the lexi-\ncal gap (or grammatical gap) between the SL and the TL.\nThe investigated translations revealed mostly a change in\nthe word class of the Quranic verb to different word classes,\nnamely, adverbs, verbal constructions, and adjectives.\nLargely, the translations of the Holy Quran are abundant with\nexamples that show grammatical gaps in translation. These\ngrammatical problems in translation may affect the meaning\nintended in the ST.\nIn a study about the translation of the Quranic verb phrase,\nAl-Ghazalli (2012) found that translators failed to accurately\nrender the verb phrase in the Quranic translation due to the\ngap in grammatical structure or the inaccuracy in selecting\nlexicons. For example, the following ayah shows such a loss\nor inaccuracy in translation:\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\nAnd remember, We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh:\nThey set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons\nand let your women-folk live; therein was a tremendous trial\nThe derivative verb \n\n\n\n\n\n, which was translated as \"slaugh-\ntered\" byAli, signifies the sense of abundantly doing the act of\nAbdelaal and Md Rashid 3\nslaughtering Jews' sons by Pharaoh's supporters. The transla-\ntion of the ST verb, which is in the aorist tense and in the exag-\ngerated form, as a past tense verb created a grammatical gap\nthat affected the meaning (Al-Ghazalli, 2012). Al- Ghazalli,\nmoreover, mentioned that such grammatical gaps make over-\ntranslation unavoidable due the fact that the Quranic vocab-\nulary is pregnant with meaning, while there is syntactic and\nlexical gap in the TL. He also indicated how derivative ger-\nminated-by verbs were not accurately rendered because ger-\nmination in Arabic is functional but it is not so in English;\nfor example, in translating the following ayah, the translator\nfailed to render the meaning accurately, as illustrated below:\n\n\n\n  \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThose who reject Our signs, We will lead them step by step to\nAsseenintheayahabove,thederivativeverb(i.e., \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n)\nindicates gradual change from a state to another. However, the\ntranslation failed to convey such depth of meaning.\nAnother problem that is highlighted in some studies is the\nnature of Arabic language, which permits foregrounding and\nbackgrounding, while English does not. In Arabic language,\nin general, and in the Holy Quran in specific, style including\nword ordering affects meaning (Abdelwali, 2007). The most\nimportant information is usually foregrounded in Arabic, as\nthe syntactic style in Arabic usually allows such kind of fore-\ngrounding or backgrounding. Style in the Quranic language\nis a principal component of meaning. However, translat-\ning the Holy Quran style is challenging due to the fact that\nthe Holy Quran has various styles, for example, narrative,\ndidactic, argumentative, and others (Sadiq, 2008). Most of\nthe English translations failed to convey the Quranic lex-\nemes and styles (Abdelwali, 2007). The following example,\nprovided by Abdul-Raof (2004), indicates how style, which\nactually is grammatical style, affects meaning in the Holy\nQuran, and how translation fails to convey:\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n   \n\n \n\n\nVerily I am God; there is no god but I; therefore serve Me.\nThe example above shows how style was used through\nthe use of repetition to convey vividness of the Holy Quran\ntext though it may be regarded by nonnative speakers of\nArabic as redundant, with unnecessary use of pronouns.\nFor example, \n\n\n /'innanii/, \n'/'ana/, and \n /'anaa/, all\nrefer to Allah Almighty. This Quranic style, as Abdul-Raof\nexplained, serves two propositions: the first proposition is\nrelated to Allah and His existence; the second proposition\nis about Allah Almighty Oneness. In addition, the use of \n\"fa\" indicates immediate action without hesitation. These\nentire stylistic features in the Quranic ayah are not conveyed\nin the translation. However, they are a basic challenge for a\ntranslator, and it can be hardly resolved because style is not\nuniversal. In other words, each language has its own style\nwhich cannot be followed in another language (Abdul-Raof,\nSurah Taha, which reads:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nAs seen in the example above, the Quranic ST \n\n\n,\nwhich is the subject, is backgrounded; however, in the trans-\nlation, it was foregrounded to follow the English syntactic\npattern. This surly created a kind of loss in meaning. One\nmore example of foregrounding and backgrounding, and\nhow they are lost in translation is provided by Abdul-Raof\nAs seen above, the Quranic ST (), which is the\nobject of the clause, was backgrounded, and taken from its\npost verbal position, whereas,  is foregrounded instead\nof its initial position. Backgrounding and foregrounding\nin the context of this ayah serve different communicative\npurposes, such as disapproving what the unbelievers say,\nbringing to the attention of the reader the notion of cal-\numny that the unbelievers attribute to God, condemning\nthe association of others with Allah Almighty, and keeping\nthe supreme status of Allah Almighty as Creator by fore-\ngrounding /li-llahi, and showing the ordinary status of\nthe Jinns who are themselves created by Allah Almighty\n(Al-Qurtubi as cited in Abdul-Raof, 2004). All these pur-\nposes were not communicated in the TT, as the translation\ncould not keep the same syntactic order of the authentic text\nbecause of the linguistic limits of the English language, or\nmaybe because of the translator's lack of awareness of the\ncommunicative function of foregrounding and background-\ning in the Quranic text.\nAnother example that indicates the failure of translation\nto keep the same syntactic order of the ST (and background-\ning and foregrounding) is the one provided by Abdul-Raof\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n ( \n\n\n\n \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOn the Day when every soul will find itself confronted with all\nthat it has done of good and all that it has done of evil, (every\nsoul) will long that there might be a mighty space of distance\n4 SAGE Open\nSource text\nTranslated text Walaqad khalaqnakum thumma sawwarnakum\nthumma qulna lilmala-ikati osjudoo li-\nadama fasajadoo illa ibleesa lam yakun mina\nalssajideena\nTarget text \nWe created you, We gave you shape, and\nthen We said to the angels, `Bow down\n\nbefore Adam,' and they did.

And God\nIn the aforementioned example, the Quranic word \n \n \n\n\ngoes after the word \n\n; however, the translation of Pickthall\nfailed to keep the same syntactic order, resulting in semantic\nloss.

For\nexample, Sadiq (2008) gave an example of stylistic ambigu-\nity in translating the following ayah from surah al-Dukhan,\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\"\nThe Day a patronizer will not avail any patronized thing. (Ghali)\n\n/shayan/ as \"any\npatronized thing\" is literal and syntactically vague; as the\nword \"patronized\" in the translation describes \"thing,\" not\nthe person. This translation is unclear because translating \nstrikingly literally as \"thing\" created a kind of ambiguity.\nMethod\nResearch Design\nThis study fits in the interpretive paradigm of a qualitative\nresearch. The qualitative research design is appropriate for\nthis study because the Holy Quran translation is complex,\nand cannot be deeply investigated using other alternative\ndesigns. As stated by Creswell and Clark (2007), a qualita-\ntive research design is appropriate when a complex detailed\nunderstanding of an issue is sought, and when quantitative\nmeasurements and analyses do not fit the research problem.\nSampling of the Study\nThe data of the current study were extracted from Abdel\nHaleem's English translation of Surah Al A'araf. One major\nreason for selecting this surah is that it has not been exam-\nined in other studies; it also addresses principal issues for\nevery Muslim. It also provides rich data cases, as suggested\nby Patton (2002). Six ayahs were chosen from the selected\nMeccan Surah. As for the sample size, the number of ayahs\nthat were selected (i.e., six) was based on saturation, as in\nany qualitative study, it is the researcher's responsibility\nto identify the saturation point in his research (Creswell &\nCriteria for selecting Abdel Haleem's translation.Mohamed\nAbdel Haleem's (2004) translation was selected for several\nreasons. First, Abdel Haleem is an Arabic-speaking Muslim,\nwho masters both Arabic and English, as he has been liv-\nwell versed in Islamic religion sciences, and his translation\nmanifests originality which is lacking in many other transla-\ntions (Shah, 2010). Furthermore, his translation is a modern\ntranslation that uses modern English.\nData Analysis\nInductive data analysis was followed in this study, as the\nresearcher is the person who interpreted the data based on his\nprior knowledge and understanding. In the interpretive para-\ndigm, a researcher interprets the data based on his knowledge,\nexperience, and prior understandings (Creswell & Clark,\n2007). Data analysis in the current study started concurrently\nwith the data collection process, as it is one characteristic of\nqualitative inquiry is that data analysis is a simultaneous pro-\ncess with data collection (Merriam, 2002). For the purpose\nof this study, content analysis of the text was used. Content\nanalysis allows better and in-depth understanding of the phe-\nnomenon under study (Downe-Wamboldt, 1992). Thus, the\ngrammatical losses were identified and analyzed based on\nResults and Discussion\nThe analysis of the selected ayahs revealed frequent gram-\nmatical losses in the translation, which have mostly led\nto partial semantic losses, while at other times, caused\ncomplete semantic losses. For presentation of the results,\nthe Arabic Quranic ayah is \nprovided in the first line(s),\ntransliteration is provided in the second line(s), and Abdel\n\nHaleem's translation in the third line(s), followed by the\ndiscussion of the results, which are fronted by brief mean-\ning of each ayah.\nThe ayah states the bounty of creation, as Allah is the\nCreator of His creatures including Adam, Eve, and their off-\nspring. The ayah also tells about the situation when angels\nand Iblis were asked to do sujood or prostration to Adam.\nAngels obeyed Allah Almighty and did sujood, while Iblis\nrefused such honor of obeying Allah Almighty.\nAbdelaal and Md Rashid 5\nSample 1 illustrates grammatical losses in emphasis, con-\njunctions, nominal agents and plurality. These losses are dis-\ncussed in details in the subsections to follow.\nLoss of Emphasis\nEmphasis attawkid is one of the characteristics of the Arabic\nlanguage, which may differ in its forms. Sometimes, it occurs\nthrough the use of repetition, synonyms or through the use\nof certain words among others. One of these devices that is\nused for emphasis is the letter lam  and the word\n\n\n (Al-\nSamraai, 2006). They are used in the Holy Quran in a precise\nway, and they are used in the \nappropriate context, when there\nAs seen in Sample 1, the Quranic ayah (verse) begins\nwith the affirmative lexeme \n\n\n/Walaqad/, which is used\nfor emphasis purpose. However, \nthis lexeme has been omit-\nted in Abdel Haleem's \ntranslation. In Sample 1, the ayah\ntalks about the creation of the human being, which is a great\nand important thing, and thus confirmation and emphasis\nis expected that if a human being knows that it is Allah\nAlmighty Who created him, he will believe in Him and\nworship Him. The emphasis here is to draw the attention to\nthe basic and greatest bounty that Allah Almighty bestowed\non His creature, that is, creating them. However, \nthe trans-\nlation did not even compensate for such loss, as \nsome-\ntimes this is followed by some translators, and suggested\nThe translator opted to translate it by omission in Baker's\n(2011) words. Although the primary meaning of the ST is\nconveyed in the TT, omitting \nthe emphasizing word surly\naffects the conveyance of the meaning partially, that is, the\naesthetic feature of the ayah is not conveyed in the transla-\ntion. Thus, this results in partial loss of meaning.\nLoss in the Translation of Conjunction\nAs seen in Sample 1, the conjunction \n, which refers to\ntime lapse, or \"succession at interval\" (Catford, Darwin,\nomitted from the\ntranslation of Abdel Haleem in its first occurrence in the\nayah. This omission created partial semantic loss because\nthe meaning of the ST conjunction was not conveyed in the\nTT. The Quranic conjunction in the ST refers to the fact\nthat \ntaking a certain appearance and shape took place after\na lapse of the time of the creation of Prophet Adam (Al\nAl-Tabari, 2004) have mentioned that the first verb \nis used to refer to Adam, while the second verb \nrefers to all the offspring of Adam. Following this interpre-\ntation, the use of conjunction, therefore, is a necessity in\nthat it shows the time lapse, which is not conveyed in the\ntranslation.\nAnother loss in translating conjunctions occurred in\ntranslating  as \"and not then,\" which \ncaused partial seman-\ntic loss, as the Quranic conjunctive letter indicates immedi-\nate action. Put simply, the ayah (Sample 1) refers to Allah\nAlmighty's command to angels to prostrate to Prophet\nAdam, which was immediately obeyed. When angels were\ndemanded to prostrate or bow to Prophet Adam, they did it\nimmediately without hesitation. However, the use of \"and\"\nin rendering the ST conjunction  does not convey such\nmeaning. This creates loss in the expressive meaning of the\nayah, that is, the immediate obedience to Allah Almighty by\ndoing sujood (prostration to Prophet Adam).\nSimilarly, the resumption  at the very beginning of\nthe ayah was omitted in the translation, which is another\ninstance of the loss in the translation of conjunctions due\nto the omission of the ST conjunction in the TT. In this\nsample, Abdel Haleem did not retain the conjunctions in the\ntranslation, which is a kind of intra-system shift (Catford,\n1965), as both the SL system and the TL system represent\nconjunctions. However, the translator preferred to leave the\nconjunctions out in his translation, which affects faithful-\nness to the ST.\nLoss in Translating the Nominal Agent\n\nSample 1 also illustrates loss in translating the nominal\nagent. As seen in Sample 1, the Quranic nominal agent\n was translated as \n\"those who bowed down\" by\nAbdel Haleem, which is a level shift (Catford, 1965). Such\nshift affects the meaning conveyed in the ST because the\nnominal agent in the Arabic language serves as a descrip-\ntive element that indicates constancy. In other \nwords,\nthe nominal clause is used in this ayah to indicate Iblis's\nrefusal to be \namong those who prostrate, and thus to obey\nAllah Almighty. \nThis also creates partial semantic loss, as\nthe expressive meaning of the nominal agent was lost in\nthe translation.\nLoss in the Translation of Plurality\nPlurality is another problematic area that is challenging in\nthe translation. In Sample 1, the aforementioned shift, in\ntranslating the Quranic nominal agent \n as a verb (i.e.,\nbow down), creates loss in plurality. Plurality in the Quranic\nayah indicates that many angels were doing sujood or pros-\ntration to obey \nAllah Almighty, and follow His commands.\n\nHowever, this plurality was not conveyed in the transla-\ntion, which created a partial semantic loss, as the primary\nmeaning was conveyed, but the connotative meaning was\nlost in the translation. The primary meaning that the angels\nwere doing sujood or prostration to obey \nAllah Almighty is\nconveyed. However, the translation seems to have failed to\nconvey the connotative meaning of the ayah in the ST, that\nis, the vast number of prostrating angels.\n6 SAGE Open\nThe ayah describes how Allah ousted Iblis from Jannah\nbecause of his obedience to Allah Almighty (by refusing to\ndo sujood to Adam). In the next subsection, the identified\ngrammatical losses are discussed.\nSample 2 illustrates grammatical losses in translating pro-\nnouns, syntactic order, and verbs. These losses are discussed\nin details in the subsections to follow.\nLoss in Pronouns\nAs seen in the translation of Sample 2, the translator has\nretained the implicit pro-drop subject \npronoun into explicit\nsubject by using the word \"God,\" which is not explicit in\nthe ST. \nSimilarly, the object pronoun in the Quranic word\nwas translated as \"here,\" which is an adverb, which indi-\ncates a class shift from the object pronoun into the \nadver-\nbial pronoun (Catford, 1965). However, the adverb \"here\"\nmay \nbe ambiguous for a reader of the translation, as he may\nnot understand what the \nadverb refer to (which is Jannah).\nClarification could have been made using a footnote or even\nby inserting \nthe word \"Jannah\" between brackets.\nIn relation to this, one inherent characteristic of the Quranic\ntext is that pronouns which \nare not mentioned earlier in the ayah\nor even in the Surah may be used, but they can be understood\nfrom \ncontext and from intertextuality, that is, from the under-\nstanding of the whole Holy Quran. \nThese pronouns are called\npro-drop pronouns, or implicit pronouns, which are similar to\nthe dropped English pronoun (you) in the imperative mood.\nThis characteristic of the Arabic language may cause confu-\nsion for a translator, as he may be unsure whether to retain the\nimplicit pronoun explicit or just leave it implicit as it is. This is\nsimilar to what Rasekh, Dastjerdi, and Bassir (2012) called as\n\"conscious ambiguity,\" in which they mentioned that retaining\nthe ambiguity is the TT is the right option in such kind of a\ntranslation. In general, losses in translating pronouns are avoid-\nable, and they can be reduced so as not to create semantic losses.\nLoss in Syntactic Order\nAnother problem in translation is related to the syntactic\norder. As seen in the translation of Sample 2, the subject\n\"God\" precedes the verb \"said\" in the translation, which is\nnot the case in the ST. The \nQuranic text has the pro-drop\npronoun implicitly following the verb, which could not be\nkept the same in the translated TT. However, this is a neces-\nsity due to the norms of English language which does not\nallow a verb to precede a subject. This loss in syntactic order\ncreates partial semantic loss in the translation, which affects\nthe expressive meaning (i.e., the aesthetic nature of the ST),\nas the translation sounds redundant in fronting the subject\n\"God,\" which is pro-dropped in the ST.\nThese findings are consistent with the findings of Abdul-\nRaof (2004) who showed that semantic loss sometimes occurs\ndue the inability of the translator of observing the syntactic order\nof the ST. This could be either ascribed to the linguistic limits\nof the English language, or to the translator's lack of realizing\nof the communicative function of foregrounding and back-\ngrounding in the Quranic text. Similarly, Sadiq (2008) showed\nthat foregrounding and backgrounding are rarely followed by\ntranslators. Keeping the same syntactic order of the ST in the\nTT is one of the grammatical losses resulted sometimes from\nthe differences between the SL and TL. Syntactic order of a ST\ncan be hardly kept in the TT, especially when the SL and the\nTL belong to different language families. Arabic is a language\nwhich \nshows flexibility in the syntactic order. The subject,\ncompliment, or the verb can be \nforegrounded or backgrounded\nbased on the purpose and the importance of the \nforegrounded\nor backgrounded lexical item. This characteristic of the Arabic\nlanguage is recurrent in the Holy Quran; \nit serves to highlight\nthe most important meaning. As Al-Samraai (2006) mentioned\nin his book The Quranic \nExpression, there is no single word\nthat is foregrounded or backgrounded in the Holy Quran for no\npurpose. \nThe English language does not have such flexibility of\nforegrounding and \nbackgrounding, and thus the syntactic order\nof the ST is lost in the translation. However, many other times,\nsyntactic losses have been created by the translator.\nLoss of Verb in Translation\nThe Quranic sentence \"\n     \n\" was rendered in\nthe translation (in Sample 2) as \"This is no place for your arro-\ngance,\" which is a kind of categorical unit shift (Catford, 1965).\nThe verb \n\"\" in the ST could not be rendered into an equiva-\nlent TT verb due to the lack of equivalent in the TT. In addi-\ntion, the English noun \"arrogance\" does have a derived verb\nform. The translation of the ST verb also reflects overtransla-\ntion, as the word \"place\" is inserted in the translation, though\nit \ndoes not exist in the ST. Literally, the Quranic sentence may\nbe translated as \"you \ncannot be arrogant.\" This grammatical\nloss in translating the ST verb affects the meaning partially,\nas the ST verb, which is in aorist  /mudarAA/ in Arabic\nexpresses a present and stable action (Daryabadi, 2007); how-\never, it was translated into a noun (i.e. arrogance), which does\nnot serve the same function as the verb. It also makes the trans-\nlation less faithful to the ST This is, as Daryabadi (2007) high-\nlighted, one of the translation problems in the Holy Quran.

You \nare\ncontemptible.\"\nAbdelaal and Md Rashid 7\nThe ayah describes how Satan allured Adam and Eve and\nurged them to eat from the forbidden tree in Jannah. He tried\nto convince them that if they eat from the forbidden tree, they\nwill stay immortal in Jannah or become angels. As a result\nof Adam and Eve's disobedience to Allah Almighty by eat-\ning from the forbidden tree, their privates were exposed. In\nthe next subsections, the identified grammatical losses are\nexplained.\nSample 3 illustrates grammatical losses in translating\nconjunctions, duality order, syntactic order, and preposi-\ntions. These losses are discussed in detail in the subsections\nto follow.\nLoss of Conjunctions\nThe Arabic conjunction  indicates immediate succession\n(Ibn Hisham, 1998). However, in Sample 3, the Quranic con-\njunction \nat the very beginning of the ayah has not been\nrendered into the TT, which has created grammatical loss in\nthe translation of the conjunction due to the omission of the\nconjunction. This affects the meaning partially, as some parts\nof the ST meaning are not conveyed, that is, the immediate\nwhispering of Satan to Adam and Eve.\nAlso, the conjunctive \nin the Quranic context of   in\nthe same sample has not been translated by Abdel Haleem.\nInstead, he has compensated it by \nusing the colon (:), which is\nan intra-system shift in Catford's (1965) words, or \ntranslation\nby omission in Baker's (2011) words, whichdoes not seem to\naffect the meaning. However, it affects faithfulness to the ST.\nLoss of Duality\nArabic, unlike English, expresses duality in different gram-\nmatical forms. In contrast toArabic, English does not express\nduality using fixed forms or pronouns. Thus, \ntranslators\ntranslate second person duality into the second person pro-\nnoun, which is used in English for singular \nas well as plural\nnouns. This type of translation is referred to by Catford as an\nintra-system shift. The \naforementioned sample (Sample 3)\nshows eight examples of the loss in the \ntranslation of duality.\nFor example, the Quranic object pronoun \n\"\n\" is rendered\nas \"them,\" and the object pronoun \n\"\"is also translated as\n\"them.\" Likewise, the word \nis dual which, \nhowever, is\nrendered into plural in the TT.This creates partial seman-\ntic loss because the duality meaning is not conveyed in the\ntranslation. Furthermore, if the ayah is read out of the con-\ntext of the whole Holy Surah, the meaning of duality will be\nmistaken for plurality. This grammatical loss in the transla-\ntion of duality could have been reduced through a compen-\nsation strategy, such as adding \"Adam and Eve\" in brackets\nafter the TT word.\nLoss of Syntactic Order\nIn Sample 3, the syntactic order of the ST   \n\nis verb + \nobject + subject. However, the same syntactic\norder could not be preserved in the TT, which is \"Satan\nwhispered to them\" (subject + verb + object). This dif-\nferent syntactic order in the TT creates partial loss in\nmeaning, which cannot be avoided due to the linguistic\ndifferences between the SL and the TL. This is because the\nST verb is foregrounded in the ST to highlight the action\nof Satan. However, the rendered clause in the TT high-\nlights the agent, which is \"Satan.\nSimilarly, in translating \"  ,\" the syntactic order\nof the ST is not preserved, which affects its expressive mean-\ning, that is, highlighting the verb which indicates forbid-\nding. In the same way, the syntactic order is not preserved in\ntranslating \n\n     . The word \nis foregrounded in the TT, which affects meaning \nbecause\nbackgrounding the Quranic word in the ST highlights the\nblessing that Adam and Eve \nhad enjoyed before committing\ntheir sin, which is hiding their private parts.However, this\ngrammatical loss is recurrent in the translation between two\ndifferent languages such as English and Arabic; it is a kind\nof categorical shift, in particular structural shift (Catford,\n1965), which results in partial semantic loss.\nLoss in Translating Prepositions\nTheQuranicinthewordfunctionsas(AlBaghawi,\nother words, as Al-Qurtubi (2004) mentioned in his tafsir, the\nayah implies that as a result of Adam and Eve's disobedience\nto Allah Almighty, their private parts were exposed. However,\nAbdel Haleem rendered the preposition as \"so as to\" in the TT,\nwhich reflects a meaning that Satan whispered toAdam and Eve\nto make their private parts exposed, which is inaccurate, and\nthus a complete semantic loss in the translated TT.\nSource text\nTranslated\ntext\nFawaswasa lahuma alshshaytanu liyubdiya lahuma\nma wooriya AAanhuma min saw-atihima\nwaqala ma nahakuma rabbukuma AAan hathihi\nalshshajarati illa an takoona malakayni aw\ntakoona mina alkhalideena\nTarget text Satan whispered to them so as to expose their\nnakedness, which had been hidden \nfrom them:\nhe said, \"Your Lord only forbade you this tree\nto prevent you becoming \nangels or immortals.\"\nSource text\n(continued)\n8 SAGE Open\nSource text\nTranslated\ntext\nWanazaAAna ma fee sudoorihim min ghillin\ntajree min tahtihimu al-anharu waqaloo\nalhamdu lillahi allathee hadana lihatha wama\nkunna linahtadiya lawla an hadana Allahu\nlaqad jaat rusulu rabbina bialhaqqi wanoodoo\nan tilkumu aljannatu oorithtumooha bima\nkuntum taAAmaloona\nTarget text We shall have removed all ill feeling from their\nhearts; streams will flow at their feet. \nThey\nwill say, \"Praise be to God, who guided us to\nthis: had God not guided us, We \nwould never\nhave found the way. The messengers of our\nLord brought the Truth.\" A \nvoice will call out\nto them, \"This is the Garden you have been\ngiven as your own on \naccount of your deeds.\"\nThe ayah describes the fact that when Adam and Eve\ntasted the forbidden fruit in the forbidden tree, their private\nparts became exposed, and thus they started to put leaves\nfrom the trees of Jannah to cover their naked body. Then,\nAllah Almighty called on them and reminded them that He\ntold them that they should not approach this tree, and that\nSatan is their sworn enemy. In the next subsections, the iden-\ntified grammatical losses are explained\nSample 4 illustrates grammatical losses in translating\nconjunctions, syntactic order, duality and tense. These losses\nare discussed in details in the subsections to follow.\nLoss of Conjunctions\nThe conjunctive letter \nat the very beginning of the ayah\nhas not been translated, or translated by omission in Baker's\n\nthe conjunction \n in the ayah of \n, \n  and in \n  \nhas not been rendered in the\ntranslation, which is a tendency inAbdel Haleem's translation.\nThis is an intra-system shift (Catford, 1965) because the SL\nand the TL represent the conjunctions mentioned in the sam-\nple. However, the translator has opted to delete the conjunc-\ntion in the TT, which has contributed to a partial semantic loss\nbecause the Arabic conjunction implies the immediate action\ntaken by Satan to allure Adam and Eve, which has not been\nconveyed in the translation.\nLoss of Syntactic Order\nAs seen in Sample 4, the Quranic conditional sentence \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n is made up of two clauses in a specific order.\nThe first clause is \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n , while the second clause is \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n. However, the translator could not preserve the syn-\ntactic order of the ST, as the translator has \nforegrounded the\nsecond clause, which creates a structural shift (Catford, 1965),\nwhich affected the meaning of the TT partially. The ST high-\nlights the reason of the exposure of Adam and Eve's private\nparts, which is the disobedience to Allah Almighty, that is, eat-\ning from the forbidden tree. However, the translation highlights\nthe consequence of the disobedience of Allah Almighty, that is,\nbeing naked, which affects meaning partially.\nLoss of Duality\nSimilar to the loss of duality in Sample 3 that has been dis-\ncussed in the aforementioned sample, in this sample, duality\n\nis lost in the translation of the duality of words, such as \n\n\n\nand \n\n\n\n\n\n, which could not be rendered as dual in the TT\ndue the linguistic differences between Arabic and English.\nHowever, this grammatical loss does not seem to affect the\nmeaning because the duality could be perceived out of the\ncontext of the ayah. However, this type of grammatical loss\nin translating duality affects faithfulness to the ST. In addi-\ntion, it leaves some of the duality meaning out in the TT.\nExamining carefully the ST and the TT, it is clear that the\nmeaning of duality in the ST is quite clear, which is not the\ncase in the TT.\nLoss of Tense\nAs seen in Sample 4, the Quranic ST\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nis rendered as \"Satan was your sworn enemy,\" resulting\nin loss in tense. The Quranic clause has an implicit pro-drop\n\nverb, that is, `is' in the present form. However, it is rendered\nin the TT as past tense (i.e., was), which affects the meaning\nconveyed in the TT. The TT \npast tense verb does not convey\nthe fact that Satan is still an enemy to Adam and his off-\nspring. However, the ST present tense indicates that Satan\nis not an enemy for Adam and Eve only, but for all their off-\nspring as well. This ST meaning is not conveyed in the TT\ndue to the loss in tense.\nThe ayah describes how Allah Almighty will remove the\nill-feelings from the hearts of believers in Jannah, and how\nthe dwellers of Jannah will praise and thank Allah Almighty\nTranslated\ntext\n\nFadallahuma bighuroorin falamma thaqa\nalshshajarata badat lahuma saw-atuhuma\nwatafiqa yakhsifani AAalayhima min waraqi\naljannati wanadahuma rabbuhuma alam\nanhakuma AAan tilkuma alshshajarati waaqul\nlakuma inna alshshaytana lakuma AAaduwwun\nmubeenun\nTarget text he lured them with lies. Their nakedness\nbecame exposed to them when they had \neaten\nfrom the tree: they began to put together\nleaves from the Garden to cover \nthemselves.\nTheir Lord called to them, \"Did I not forbid\nyou to approach that tree? \nDid I not warn you\nthat Satan was your sworn enemy?\"\nSample 4. (continued)\nAbdelaal and Md Rashid 9\nfor the great guidance Allah Almighty provided to them and\nwhich made them inhabitants of Jannah. This guidance was\nthrough sending prophets and messengers. Then, the ayah\nends with the great call that this great Jannah is inherited by\nthe believers due to their good deeds.\nSample 5 illustrates grammatical losses in translating\ntense, conjunctions, and emphasis. These losses are dis-\ncussed in details in the subsections to follow.\nLoss in Tense\nAs seen in Sample 5, the Quranic verb \n\n, which is in the\npresent tense, is rendered by Abdel Haleem into the \nfuture\nsimple aspect (i.e., will flow) in the TT, which indicates a loss\nin tense, particularly, the aorist tense. The Quranic ST verb,\nwhich is in the present form, indicates a mental \npicture of riv-\ners as if they are running at the moment of reading the ayah,\nbut \nthe rendered verb is in the future aspect form in the TT,\nresulting in grammatical and semantic \nlosses.Similarly, The\nQuranic verb \nis also in the past tense form; however, it\nis rendered into future simple aspect (will say).This actually\naffects the expressive meaning, which is the fact that the past\nST verb indicates the absolute fact that the people of Jannah\nwill thankAllahAlmighty that they had been guided to Jannah.\nAnother double loss occurred in Sample 5 in the transla-\ntion of \n\n, which is a past passive verb into as \"a voice\nwill call out to them,\" which is a future active verb. The\nfirst loss occurred via the translation of the \npassive voice\ninto active voice. This creates loss in translating the passive,\nwhich \nserves certain purposes in the language of the Holy\nQuran such as generalizability. In regard to the ST verb, it\nis in the past passive form to indicate generalizability, as it\nmay be inferred from the ayah that the people of Jannah will\nbe called by angels or by Allah Almighty or by both, which\nis rendered ambiguously in the TT. In addition, using active\nvoice instead of passive voice ambiguated the meaning and\nmade the TT less faithful to the ST. The second loss is by ren-\ndering the past passive into the future present active voice.\nIn a similar vein, the Quranic clause \n  is in the\nimperfect aspect of the verb. However, it has been \ntranslated\nby Abdel Haleem as \"on account of your deeds,\" which is a\nhowever, it does not convey the\nimperfect nature of the Quranic verb that expresses the \npast\nand the present simultaneously.\nLoss of Conjunction\nThe tendency of Abdel Haleem to drop conjunctions in the\nTT is also reflected in the translation of Sample 5. The con-\njunction  occurred in the ST sample 3 times. However, it\nhas been dropped in the translation, which creates a partial\nsemantic loss as some of the ST shades of meaning that are\nexpressed using the conjunction were not conveyed in the\nTT, that is, the resumption function of the conjunction to\nseparate different statements or clauses.\nLoss of Emphasis\nIn Sample 5, the emphatic word  is dropped from the trans-\nlation in \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n, which is an example of under-\ntranslation. The Quranic word  serves to emphasize the\nfact that the messengers of Allah Almighty informed people\nabout the truths of the Hereafter which they will find true on\nthe Day of Judgment. This fact will be spelled out by people\nof Jannah on the Day of Judgment, when they see Jannah and\nenter it. This grammatical loss of emphasis affects the mean-\ning partially because the emphasis that exists in the ST is lost\nin the TT, without any sort of compensation.\nThe ayah describes the bounty ofAllahAlmighty by send-\ning winds that are laden with clouds. Then, these clouds are\ndriven to a dead and barren land to become revived, and the\nplants start to grow. Then, the ayah ends with drawing anal-\nogy by reviving the dead land and Allah's Almighty ability to\nresurrect the dead people on the Day of Judgment.\nSample 6 illustrates grammatical losses in translating pro-\nnouns and adverbs. These losses are discussed in details in\nthe subsections to follow.\nLoss in Translating Pronouns\nAs seen in Sample 6, the implicit pronoun that refers to Allah\nAlmighty has been rendered by Abdel Haleem \ninto a noun\n(i.e., God). Abdel \nHaleem's translation tends to be redundant\nin rendering the pronoun as an explicit noun.This grammati-\ncal loss may not affect the conveyance of the meaning of the\nST, but it affects the faithfulness to the ST, and it also affects\nthe aesthetic feature of the ST, which is accuracy, precise,\nand lack of redundancy.\nLoss in Translating Adverbs\nIn Sample 6, the Quranic word \n\n, which is an adverb, is\ntranslated as a phrase \"bearing good news.\" This is a unit shift\nSource text\nTranslated\ntext\nWahuwa allathee yursilu alrriyaha bushran\nbayna yaday rahmatihi hatta itha aqallat\nsahaban thiqalan suqnahu libaladin mayyitin\nfaanzalna bihi almaa faakhrajna bihi min kulli\nalththamarati kathalika nukhriju almawta\nlaAAallakum tathakkaroona\nTarget text It is God who sends the winds, bearing good\nnews of His coming grace, and when \nthey\nhave gathered up the heavy clouds, We drive\nthem to a dead land where We \ncause rain to\nfall, bringing out all kinds of crops, just as We\nshall bring out the dead. \nWill you not reflect?\nin Catford's (1965) words. This shift creates a grammatical\nloss in the translation of the Quranic adverb, which describes\nthe winds as a source of bounties, \nand Allah Almighty's\nmercy for His creatures. \nThis grammatical loss conveyed\nunfaithfulness to the ST, which seems to be unavoidable.\nConclusion\nThis article has focused on the investigation of the grammati-\ncal loss in the translation of the Holy Quran, with special\nreference to Surah Al A'araf, and the extent the different\ntypes of grammatical losses cause partial or complete seman-\ntic loss. The findings of the study revealed that losses occur\nin the translation of conjunctions, syntactic order, duality,\ntense, and verbs. It was also found that grammatical losses\ncontributed to semantic losses, which are mostly partial\nsemantic losses. In addition, some of these losses are avert-\nable which could have been reduced. Thus, it is recom-\nmended that future studies focus on the strategies of\ntranslating the Holy Quran, and how losses can be reduced in\nthe translation of a sacred book, such as the Holy Quran.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAbdelaal, N., & Md Rashid, S.
