In fact, it\nhas been documented that about 20% of children and adoles-\ncents in the United States suffer from a diagnosable mental\nor addictive disorder.1 In addition to their enduring effects\nacross the life span and generations, childhood psychiatric\ndisorders place an enormous burden on society, communities\nand families.2 Parents, particularly mothers, face serious dif-\nficulty in balancing daily activities such as employment,\nchild care, and parent-child relationships because they must\ninvest a considerable amount of time and economic resources\nin these children. The high prevalence of children's EBP\nmight have a negative effect on their mothers' labor market\noutcomes because children with EBP require additional time\nfor treatment. However, these children may require addi-\ntional financial resources, which would promote their moth-\ners' work activities.\nThere is a long-standing literature in the economics field\non the impact of children's disabilities or other chronic con-\nditions on their parents' work activities, particularly, the\neffects of children's health on their single mothers' employ-\nment.3-19 This literature is not conclusive for single mothers\nand shows a wide range of reductions from 5% to\nnumber of studies that have examined the impact of chil-\ndren's chronic illnesses on married mothers' employ-\nment.3-5,10-12 More recent studies which have used richer data\nsets and larger sample sizes and have accounted for endoge-\nneity in children's health including omitted variables bias are\nmore consistent in their findings. They have consistently\nfound negative effects of children's health on mothers' work\na few studies have either considered mental health symptoms\nin addition to general chronic health conditions in analyzing\nchildren's health on parental work activities7,8 or have exam-\nined the effect of having any household family member with\n1Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD,\nUSA\n2Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA\n3Jackson State University, Jackson, MS, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nPatrick Richard, Assistant Professor, Uniformed Services University of the\nEmail: patrick.richard@usuhs.edu\nmental illness, including children, on single and married\nFocusing on the most recent literature which seeks to\nunderstand the impact of children's health on parental work\nactivities, there are four articles that are relevant to this\nstudy.26-29 Two of these articles used different measures of\nchild health such as birth weight, physical disabilities, and\nmental, emotional, sensory, and cognitive disabilities to\nexamine the relationship between child health and mother's\nlabor supply.26,28 Both studies found that having a child in\npoor physical health reduces single mothers' probability of\nworking from 2 to 8 percentage points and from 1 hour to 3\nhours per week for employed mothers. Similar but smaller\neffects were found for married women. However, the effects\nof child health on mothers' work activities were less strong\nfor those mothers with a child who suffered from a disabling\nmental, emotional, sensory, or cognitive condition.26,28\nOther studies have examined the long-term effects of chil-\ndren's health on parental labor supply. For instance, Kvist et\nal. examined the relationship between children's attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and parents' labor\nsupply using data from the Danish Psychiatric Central\nRegister.29 The authors found that parents of children diag-\nnosed with ADHD have a 7% to 13% lower probability of\nlabor supply 10 years after the child's birth, compared with\ntheir counterparts with non-ADHD children.29\nThe study most closely related to our study was the one\nconducted by Coley et al.27 The authors used a sample of low-\nincome mothers and early adolescent children (aged 10-14)\nfrom theThree-City Study (Boston, Chicago, and SanAntonio)\nto examine the relationship between adolescent behavioral and\npsychological functioning and maternal labor supply such as\nemployment status and duration of employment. They used a\nshortened version of the Brief Symptom Inventory to measure\nadolescents' symptoms of depression, somatization, and anxi-\nety. They also used items derived from the National\nLongitudinal Study of Youth and the Youth Deviance Scale to\ndescribe adolescents' behavioral problems. Employment sta-\ntus indicated whether or not mothers were employed at the\ntime of the survey. Weeks and months of employment were\nassessed by using the number of weeks or months during the\nprevious 6 months when mothers were employed in their pri-\nmary jobs. The study found that greater psychological distress\namong adolescents predicted a lower likelihood of employ-\nment for mothers (fewer hours worked, fewer months worked,\nand lower earnings), and a greater likelihood of having lost\nhours in the previous week. They also found that adolescent\ndelinquency and disabilities were less consistent predictors of\nmothers' lower employment effort.27\nWhile these studies provided some insights regarding the\nimpact of children's health on their mothers' work activities,\nthe current study contributes to the literature in several ways.\nFirst, it focuses on the impact of having a child between the\nages of 4 and 18 who is suffering from EBP on their mothers'\nlabor supply (employment and work hours). As the literature\nreview above shows, there are no previous studies focusing\non this area. It is important to examine the effects of chil-\ndren's EBP on parental work activities for children of differ-\nent ages because children require different amounts of time\nand resources from their parents for the production of their\nwell-being at different ages. Second, this study uses rich and\nnationally representative data sets. Third, it accounts for\nissues of endogeneity such as omitted variables biases and\nreverse causality between children's EBP and their mothers'\nlabor supply. More specifically, this article estimates the\neffects of children's EBP on (1) their mothers' employment\nstatus and (2) work hours for single and married mothers.\nWe hypothesize that mothers with children who suffer\nfrom EBP are more likely to reduce their labor supply com-\npared with mothers whose children are free from EBP. We\nfurther hypothesize that these effects are larger on married\nmothers'labor supply compared with single mothers because\nof the flexibility provided by the presence of fathers in two-\nparent families. It is important that policy makers, clinicians,\nand researchers understand these effects because of the role\nthat parents' labor income plays in shaping children's health,\neducational, and economic trajectories.9\nMaterials and Methods\nConceptual Framework\nThe study focuses on the extent to which U.S. households with\nchildren affected by EBP withdraw time from market activi-\nties to reallocate it to the production of their child's mental\nwell-being. Based on insights from Becker's intra-family allo-\ncation framework and from Grossman, we hypothesized that a\nchild's mental well-being is a commodity produced in the\nhouse with some combination of time and medical care and\nservices based on parental preferences, time, income, and bud-\nget.30,31 The key implication of this framework is that maternal\nemployment depends on changes in children's mental health\nendowment as well as the marginal productivity of the inputs\nused to produce mental well-being in the child. For instance,\nan increase in the child's EBP would increase the use of medi-\ncal goods and child care services, which might increase the\nmother's labor supply to compensate for additional income\nneeds. However, this situation would impose a greater demand\non the mother's time. Mothers may reduce their labor supply\nbecause they are able to provide more effective and efficient\nservices to their child with EBP than alternative child care pro-\nviders. We hypothesized that the net effects are a reduction in\nthe mother's labor supply.\nData Sources\nWe pooled two waves of data from the Child Development\nSupplements (CDS) of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics\nfiles with the family and individual files from the PSID. The\nRichard et al. 3\nPSID is an ongoing nationally representative panel survey\nthat has been collecting detailed socio-economic and socio-\ndemographic data such as employment, income, and marital\nstatus from individuals and households in the United States\nand 2002 to understand the socio-demographic, psychologi-\ncal, and economic aspects of childrens' lives. Both waves of\nthe CDS randomly sampled up to two children per PSID fam-\nily. CDS-I collected information from the primary care givers\ncollected information on households that remained in the\nfrom 5 to 18. For both waves of the CDS, the PCGs provided\ninformation on their children's health, behavior, cognitive\nability, socio-emotional development, home environment,\nand child care arrangements. The response rates for the PCGs\nfor children were approximately 81% for both waves.\nEvidence from a number of methodological studies to assess\nthe quality of the PSID has indicated that issues such as attri-\ntion in the CDS-PSID may not make the survey less represen-\ntative.32,33 For instance, Duncan and Hill found that the key\nsurvey measures from the PSID are generally unbiased and\ncontain small amounts of measurement-error variances when\ncompared with validated data such as the CDS.32 Although\nthe CDS data were collected after the studies by Duncan and\nHill, there is no reason to believe that the CDS would be\nbiased because of measurement errors. Furthermore, we com-\nbined data from the CDS with the core sample in which\nDuncan and Hill found small measurement errors.32\nThe Analytic Sample\nMothers are the unit of analysis in this study. CDS-I contains\ninformation on 2,233 PCGs and CDS-II contains information\nweights. We restricted the sample to households with children\naged 3 years or older because the CDS only collected mental\nhealth information for these children. This resulted in 3,485\npooled observations for CDS-I and CDS-II. We used the\nPSID Family Information and Mapping System (FIMS) to\nidentify the siblings of CDS-I and CDS-II eligible children, as\nwell as their EBP status. All eligible children and their sib-\nlings were interviewed in about 80% of the households\nThe majority of the households had either one or two chil-\ndren. In addition, we included information on the EBP status\nof siblings in the remaining 20% of family units with two or\nmore children. We excluded PCGs who were fathers or other\nrelatives to restrict the sample to biological mothers, adoptive\nmothers, and stepmothers. Because we are interested in labor\nmarket activities, we restricted the sample to mothers aged 24\nWe used two dummy variables to define family structure.\nBy default, the PSID designates the male as the head of any\ntwo-parent household, which means that a female is only\ndesignated as head of household when she is not currently\nmarried. Thus, married/cohabitating mothers were com-\nprised of biological mothers, adoptive mothers, and step-\nmothers as long as both parents lived in the same household.\nAll other mothers formed the category of single mothers.\nThis produced an analytic sample of 2,007 married mothers\nLabor Market Measures\nEmployment status (P) and work hours (H) are our labor\nmarket outcomes of interest in this study. The variable P is\nbinary and equals 1 if mothers reported an employment sta-\ntus of \"working now, temporarily laid off, or on maternity\nleave.\" The variable H is continuous and represents the total\nhours that mothers worked for the past 12 months. Given the\nskewness in the distribution of work hours, this variable was\nlog-transformed.\nMeasures of the Child's EBP\nThe CDS used 30 items selected from the Achenbach Child\nBehavior Checklist (CBCL) to collect children's EBP data\ntested on a large number of children with EBP, is a gold stan-\ndard and widely used tool completed by parents to assess\ntheir children's EBP over the preceding 6 months. This\ninstrument has been validated in a variety of languages and\nThe CDS computed total scores for two subscales of syn-\ndromes: externalizing or aggressive behavior (13 items), and\ninternalizing, withdrawn, or sad behavior (16 items). The\nsubscales have very good psychometric properties\n(Cronbach's s = .86 and .81 respectively). We should note\nthat although the CBCL is a parent-reported measure of chil-\ndren's mental health status, it is not one of the instruments\nthat Glied et al. found to lead to biased estimates of the\neffects of income on health services use by children.37\nFurthermore, a review conducted by Biederman et al. found\nthat there is good agreement between CBCL scores and diag-\nnostic categories from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders\u00adThird Edition, Revised (DSM-III-R).38,39\nIn the current study, we considered any children in the house-\nhold as having EBP if the total score was above the 90th\npercentile. This cutoff point for dichotomizing EBP is based\non the American normative sample version of the Dutch\nscoring distribution where cases are allocated according to a\nclinical range if the score is above the 90th percentile.40\nChild's General Health and Household Socio-\ndemographics\nChildren's general health status was measured by asking the\ncaregiver, \"In general, would you say the (child's) health is\nexcellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?\" We created the\nfollowing three dummy variables: excellent/very good, good,\nand fair/poor health. Excellent/very good health was used as\nthe reference group. Children's functional impairment was\ncoded as 1 if the caregiver reported that any child in the\nhousehold had any physical limitations. A set of children's,\nmother's, father's, and family characteristics were controlled\nfor in the model. Characteristics of children included age,\ngender, and health status. We also controlled for parents'age,\nrace, education, and health status. Other variables included\nin the analysis were the presence of any children younger\nthan 6 years old and regional variables. The annual non-wage\nincome was scaled in $10,000 units. Experience was squared\nto capture the non-linearity of this variable.\nEstimation Strategy\nWe used the standard reduced form model below to estimate\nthe effects of any children in the household with EBP on their\nmothers' employment status:\ni i i i\n= + + +\n   \nP\ni\nmeasures mother i 's employment status. M\ni\nis a\ndummy variable that takes the value of 1 if any children in\nthe household have EBP, and 0 otherwise. X\ni\nis a vector of\nexogenous variables including the mother's age, race, educa-\ntion, and health status, the father's education and health sta-\ntus, the presence of children younger than 6 years old in the\nhousehold, non-labor income, different regions of the coun-\ntry, and a time dummy variable. \nand \nare the parame-\nters to be estimated, and \ni is a random error term capturing\nshocks to mothers'employment outcomes. Similarly, the fol-\nlowing equation was used to estimate mothers' work hours:\nLog H M\ni i i i\n= + + +\n   \u00b5\nH\ni\nmeasures mother i 's work hours for the past 12\nmonths. M\ni\nis a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if\nany children in the household have EBP, and 0 otherwise. X\ni\nis the same vector of exogenous variables discussed above.\nThe parameters \nand \nare to be estimated and \u00b5\ni\nis a\nrandom error term capturing shocks to mothers' work hours.\nIf the variable measuring the mental health status of any\nchildren in the household is endogenous in Equations 1 and\n2, univariate probit models typically used to estimate the\nprobability of employment and standard tobit model typi-\ncally used to estimate censored work hours would lead to\nbiased estimators. Indeed, evidence suggests that children's\nEBP are not randomly distributed in the population of all\nchildren and are strongly associated with their mothers'\nemployment.41 For instance, a literature review by Ruhm\nconcluded that maternal employment may have a positive\neffect on the well-being of children during their early years\nand a negative effect on the development of 3 and 4 year\nolds.42 In the case of a positive effect, children of employed\nmothers may have greater access to mental health services\nthrough more disposable income and/or employer-provided\ninsurance coverage.43 Conversely, reduced maternal time\nand stress associated with employment may also lead to\nincreased EBP in children during their early formative\nEndogeneity may also arise from measurement errors in\nchildren's EBP. Measurement error is a potentially important\nproblem in any study relying on self-reported measures of\nchildren's mental health disorders.37,46,47 Glied et al. dis-\ncussed how the use of different children's mental health mea-\nsures, particularly those reported by parents, might introduce\nestimation bias.37 Furthermore, the lack of measures such as\nthe mental health status of mothers in the PSID is a likely\nsource of omitted variable bias and hence endogeneity.\nEndogeneity of Children's EBP: Instrumental\nVariable (IV) Approach\nWe implemented the following IV approach to address any\npotential endogeneity:\nMi i i i\n= + + +\n   \nM\ni\nmeasures child i 's mental health status in the house-\nhold. Xi\nis the same vector of exogenous variables included\nin mothers'employment and wok hours equations (Equations\nand \nare the parameters to be estimated and\n\ni\nis the error term for the children's EBP equation. Z\ni\nis a\nvector of exogenous variables that are correlated with chil-\ndren's EBP but uncorrelated with mothers' employment sta-\ntus and work hours.48\nThe main difficulty with the IV approach is to find suit-\nable instruments. The following three instruments were used\nto predict children's EBP and remove the unobserved factors\nthat affect both children's EBP and maternal labor supply:\n(1) whether any children were ever spanked by the mother by\nthe time they turned 3 years old, (2) the mother's frequency\nof religious activity with any of the children in the household\n(and/or the father in the case of married mothers), and (3)\nwhether these children have any biological siblings younger\nthan 18 years old who do not live in the same household.\nSpanking reflects parental attitudes toward discipline to con-\ntrol children's behaviors. Several studies have documented\nthe positive effects of spanking on children and adolescents'\nemotional and behavioral well-being.49-51 Using the con-\nstructs of the problem behavior theory, we hypothesized that\nchildren's spankings are protective factors against behavioral\nproblems because they capture the different means used by\nmothers to control their children's behavior.52,53\nIn addition, several studies have shown that family envi-\nronments and the quality of relationships among family mem-\nbersplayanimportantroleinshapingchildren'swell-being.54-56\nResearch in sociology has shown an important transmission of\nRichard et al. 5\nattitudes and behaviors during family interactions.54 The fre-\nquency of religious activities and the absence of biological\nsiblings who are less than 18 years old in the household are\nimportant dimensions of family environments involving the\ninteraction and the quality of relationships among family\nmembers. Mothers' frequency of religious activities and sib-\nlings'interactions play an important role in shaping these fam-\nily dynamics that would in turn influence children's EBP.\nMore specifically, the frequency of religious activities reflects\nparental inputs into the child's emotional and behavioral\ndevelopment. Studies have shown that children and adoles-\ncents whose parents frequently attend religious services are\nless likely to suffer from emotional problems because these\nchildren are more involved with their families, have better\nsupport networks from friends, and feel more able to deal with\nhealth-related problems.57,58 A similar instrument was used in\na prior study to estimate the effects of depression on employ-\nment in a low-income population in Miami-Dade County,\nFlorida.59 However, we hypothesized that children whose bio-\nlogical siblings live outside of the family unit are more likely\nto suffer from emotional problems. The absence of other bio-\nlogical siblings in the same household reflects a lack of cohe-\nsion and environmental circumstances within the family that\nmay impact the child's well-being. Indeed, sibling relation-\nships have been found to have important effects on each oth-\ner's internalizing and externalizing behaviors.60,61 In sum, all\nthree instruments are related to children's EBP but are not cor-\nrelated to mothers' labor supply.\nResults\nWe first presented the weighted means of the study sample,\nfollowed by the multivariate estimates of the employment\nstatus and work hours' equations. For ease of interpretation,\nthe estimates from the models were converted to \"marginal\neffects.\" For binary explanatory variables, these marginal\neffects represent the estimated effect of a change in the value\nof an indicator from 0 to 1 on the percentage of employed\nmothers. For continuous explanatory variables such as age,\nyears of education, and non-wage income, the marginal\neffects represent the estimated effects of a one-unit increase\nin value on the expected percentage of employed mothers. In\nthe log work hours regression models, the marginal effects\non a continuous variable such as age or years of education\nrepresent the proportional change in work hours. Variances\nwere estimated using complex sampling design commands\nas available in STATA10 to account for heteroskedascity.62\nAs suggested by the CDS-PSID, we used the PCG/mother\nweights provided by the CDS because mothers are the unit of\nanalysis in this study.63\nDescriptive Statistics\nTable 3 summarizes the weighted means of the dependent\nand independent variables used in the study by family\nstructure. The rates of employment and work hours for sin-\ngle mothers are significantly higher compared to those for\nmarried mothers. Single mothers in this sample are more\nlikely to be black (44% vs. 7%), in fair/poor health (15%\nvs. 8%), have functional impairment (11% vs. 9%), and live\nin the South (38% vs. 29%) compared with married moth-\ners (p < .001). They also have lower socio-economic status\ncompared with two-parent families. For instance, the aver-\nage total family income, expressed in 1996 dollars, is about\nfor married mothers (p < .0001). Likewise, single mothers\nhave lower education levels, averaging 12 years of educa-\ntion compared to 13 years of education for married mothers\nEmployment of Married and Single Mothers\nAs reported in Table 4, two different models were used to\nestimate the effects of children's EBP on the employment\nprobability of married mothers. In the case of married\nmothers, , the coefficient of correlation that measures exo-\ngeneity between children's EBP and mothers' employment\nin the IV bivariate probit model, is positive and signifi-\ncantly different from zero ( = .705**). Therefore, we can\nreject the null hypothesis that children's EBP are exoge-\nnous in the married mothers' employment equation. In this\ncontext, the bivariate probit model with IV is preferred to\nthe univariate probit model and the marginal effects indi-\ncate that children's EBP significantly reduce their married\nmothers' probability of employment by about 1% (p <\n.001). As a result, we decided to assess the strength and\nvalidity of the instruments used to correct for endogeneity\nin the bivariate probit model with IV for married mothers\nbecause weak instruments yield inconsistent estimates.64\nTable 4 summarizes the results from the joint significance\ntest and shows that the set of instruments perform well\nusing the Staiger and Stock rule of thumb of an F statistic\nequivalent of a Hausman test developed by Smith and\nBlundell66 for non-linear models to test the exogeneity of\nthe instruments and a Lagrange multiplier test to assess\ntheir validity. For these tests, the chi-square statistics and\nthe adjusted Wald test results were not significant; there-\nfore, we concluded that the instruments were not correlated\nwith married mothers' employment in the bivariate probit\nmodel with IV. In the case of single mothers, the univariate\nprobit model is preferred to the bivariate probit model with\nIV because the correlation term measuring exogeneity\nbetween children's EBP and their single mothers' employ-\nment is not significant. In other words, the results from the\nbivariate probit model with IV show that children's EBP\nand single mothers' employment are exogenous. Thus, mar-\nginal effects from the univariate probit model show that\nchildren's EBP have no effect on their single mothers'\nemployment probability.\nMeasures\nDependent variables\nEmployment Coded as 1 if the respondent reported \"working now, temporarily laid off, or on maternity leave,\" 0 otherwise\n Log work hours Log of total annual work hours from the previous year\nIndependent variables\n Parent socio-demographic characteristics\nAge The parent/caregiver is between 24 and 55 years old\n White (reference) Coded as 1 if the parent is white non-Hispanic\nBlack Coded as 1 if the parent is black non-Hispanic\nHispanic Coded as 1 if the parent is of Latino origin or descent\n Other race Equals 1 if the parent mentioned races other than black, white, or Latino; this includes Asian, Pacific Islander, American Indian, Aleut, and Eskimo\n Years of education The highest level of education completed by the parent/caregiver\nExperience The number of years the parent has been in the workplace since turned 18 years old up to 1996 for CDS-I and up to 2001 for CDS-II (only for fathers)\nParent health status\n Excellent/very good health (reference) Equals 1 if the respondent reported that the parent is in excellent or very good health\n Good health Equals 1 if the respondent reported that the parent is in good health\n Fair/poor health Equals 1 if the respondent reported that the parent is in poor and fair health\n Functional impairment Equals 1 if the parent/caregiver has any physical or nervous condition that limits the type and amount of work he or she can do\nChild socio-demographic characteristics\nAge The child is between 3 and 18 years old\nMale Equals 1 if the child is male\nFemale Equals 1 if the child is female\nChild health status\n Mental health (EBP) Coded as 1 if the total CBCL score is over 15, the clinical cutoff point, 0 otherwise\n Excellent health (reference) Equals 1 if the caregiver/parent reported that the child is in excellent or very good health\n Good health Equals 1 if the caregiver/parent reported that the child is in good health\n Fair/poor health Equals 1 if the caregiver/parent reported that the child is in fair or poor health\n Functional impairment Equals 1 if the child currently has any conditions that would limit or prevent (his or her) ability to do usual childhood activities such as play, or participate\nin games or sports, attend school regularly, or do regular schoolwork, 0 otherwise\nHousehold characteristics\n Presence of a child younger than 6 years old Equals 1 if other than the focal child, there is a child of less than 5 years old living in the household, 0 otherwise\n Unearned income divided by 10k Total family income less the labor income and transfer payments of the parent.

Marginal effect\nestimates are negative and significant for married mothers'\nemployment that account for endogeneity in children's men-\ntal health. These findings are consistent and similar to those\nof the study conducted by Coley et al.27 A possible explana-\ntion for these findings is that the presence of a father in two-\nparent households may provide more financial flexibility for\nmarried mothers to stay at home with a child with EBP.\nHowever, given a child with EBP, single mothers may not be\nable to leave work completely but can only afford to reduce\ntheir work hours to deal with demand on their time to seek\ntreatment for their children.\nIt is worth noting that the study has some limitations.\nMother's marital status might be another mechanism through\nwhich maternal work activities impact children's EBP.\nChildren living in single-parent families are known to be\nmore likely to have EBP compared with those raised by two\nparents.42 Compared with their peers in two-parent families,\nthese children are more likely to use more mental health ser-\nvices because of less time and emotional support from their\nparent.45 Conversely, children's EBP might be a contributing\nfactor to changes in the family structure such as marital dis-\nsolution. A child with EBP might bring additional financial\nand marital stress into the family, which could result in sin-\ngle-parent households.67 For instance, a recent article by\nKvist et al. found that the existence of a child with ADHD in\nthe household can contribute to marital separation.29 As such,\none would contend that the effect of children's EBP on moth-\ners' employment could be confounded with parental separa-\ntion. However, this would not be the case in our study\nbecause we conducted separate analyses for married and\nsingle mothers.\nAlthough most households in the study have one sampled\nchild, the CDS randomly sampled two or three eligible chil-\ndren in 18% of the households in the sample. If EBP are cor-\nrelated across siblings in families where the CDS interviewed\ntwo or more children, then the effects of children's EBP on\ntheir mothers' labor supply will be overestimated. Although\nthe IV approach may account for some of this omitted\nvariable bias, it would be better to include information about\nas many siblings as possible. However, this was not possible\nas the CDS only collected a series of information about sib-\nConclusions\nThis study shows that children's EBP negatively influence\nmarried mothers' probability of employment and single\nmothers' work hours. To increase maternal employment,\npolicies may consider targeting both children's mental health\nsymptoms and their families' financial resources. Attempts\ncould also be made to provide families with access to ser-\nvices that may reduce children's EBP such as screening for\nchildren's EBP in primary care and adequate treatment.\nAlthough the effects of children's EBP on maternal\nemployment and work hours appear to be fairly small,\nresearchers may consider whether children with more severe\nmental health problems have larger effects on their mothers'\nemployment and work hours as more appropriate data sets\nbecome available. Implications for future research could be\nlongitudinal assessments of the impact of children's EBP on\ntheir mothers' labor supply as these children age. The ana-\nlytic sample was restricted to biological mothers, adoptive\nmothers, and stepmothers. But future research should con-\nsider a sub-group analysis of biological mothers to examine\nthe impact of EBP on this population.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\n1.
