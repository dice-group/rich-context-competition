Gene\u00adenvironment interaction\nAntisocial behavior (ASB) consists of a diverse constellation\nof behaviors including violence and aggression, violating the\nrights/property of others, and breaking age-appropriate rules\nand norms (e.g., truancy). ASB is frequently persistent,\nresistant to treatment, and reliably associated with negative\noutcomes, including comorbidity (e.g., substance depen-\ndence, antisocial personality disorder), poor academic\nachievement, negative social relationships, and occupational\nstability of overt/physical ASB across the lifespan\napproaches IQ, long considered one of the most stable\nindividual attributes (Loeber and Stouthamer-Loeber 1998).\nMoreover, impairment related to ASB and externalizing\nbehavior more broadly has historically constituted the most\ncommon referral for mental health services for American\nASB constitutes a significant public health problem and it\nremains an important scientific priority.\nBroad characterizations of ASB, however, may betray\nimportant differences with respect to patterns of associa-\ntion, predictive validity, and etiological influences. A meta-\nanalysis determined that two dimensions, consisting of\novert and covert as well as destructive and non-destructive,\ndescribed the underlying architecture of ASB (Frick et al.\n1993). Using multi-method (i.e., laboratory, naturalistic\nobservations) strategies of ASB assessment in school-aged\nboys, Hinshaw et al. (1995) found that covert ASB was\nindependent of overt aggression and that covert ASB\ndemonstrated discriminant and covergent validity with\nother constructs (i.e., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD), child behavior problems). Indeed, the distinction\nbetween overt and covert ASB is evident early in\ndevelopment and persists through adolescence and young\nadulthood. Willoughby et al. (2001) found that overt\naggression uniquely predicted other problems (e.g., class-\nS. S.

Next,\na laboratory measure of childhood covert ASB significantly\npredicted adolescent psychopathology in two independent\nsamples of boys and girls, controlling for overt aggression,\nUsing latent class analysis (LCA) in a large study of\nadolescents and youth adults, covert ASB was empirically\ndistinct from overt ASB, including patterns of sex differ-\nences in overt and covert ASB that were consistent with\nprevailing theories (Li and Lee 2010). Finally, overt and\ncovert ASB are separable with respect to genetic influences.\nBurt (2009) meta-analyzed twin studies and found that\novert ASB was more heritable than covert ASB and that\nshared environmental influences were more salient for\ncovert ASB than overt ASB. Finally, recent molecular\ngenetic studies, across multiple designs (e.g., prospective\nlongitudinal, clinical) and neurobiological systems (e.g.,\ndopamine, serotonin) showed differential effects for overt\nOverall, overt versus covert ASB is a meaningful distinc-\ntion and one that should be prioritized in future studies,\nparticularly genetic association studies which have largely\nignored the distinction.\nDeviant peer affiliation is a strong predictor of ASB\nfrom childhood through adolescence and early adulthood,\nacross naturalistic and intervention designs (Dodge et al.\npositively predicted childhood- and adolescent-onset trajec-\ntories of ASB, controlling for initial ASB, suggesting its\ncentrality in the emergence, maintenance, and escalation of\nAmong 267 boys and girls entering kindergarten, deviant\npeer affiliation significantly predicted overt and covert\nconduct problems across home, school, and playground\ncontexts (Snyder et al. 2005). Similarly, Monahan et al.\n(2009) demonstrated that deviant peer association prospec-\n22) with incarceration histories. Finally, Fergusson et al.\nprospectively into young adulthood, deviant peer affiliation\npredicted diverse negative outcomes (i.e., substance prob-\nlems, violence, property crime), although the magnitude of\nthe association was stronger in adolescents (14\u00ad15 years-\nold) than young adults (20\u00ad21 years-old). Thus, deviant\npeer affiliation is a risk factor for ASB and these influences\nhave been suggested across development.\nDespite the persuasive evidence on the association of\ndeviant peer affiliation and ASB, not all youth with deviant\npeers engage in ASB or equally affected by deviant peers.\nIn a study of 6th grade children followed prospectively into\nadolescence, individual differences in effortful and inhibi-\ntory control moderated the influence of deviant peer\naffiliation on ASB. Specifically, deviant peer affiliation\nsignificantly predicted ASB only among the subgroup of\nyouth with poor self-regulation. Among youth with well-\ndeveloped self-regulation, deviant peer affiliation did not\npredict ASB (Gardner et al. 2004). In a prospective study of\nschool-aged children, age 14 deviant peer affiliation\nsignificantly predicted age 16 ASB even when age 14\nASB was controlled. However, adolescents with heightened\nreward sensitivity were particularly susceptible to peer\ndeviance (Goodnight et al. 2006). Other studies suggest\nindividual differences in response inhibition, coupled with\ndeviant peer affiliation, may be particularly predictive of\nASB (Kendler et al. 2008) whereas youth with a positive\nemotional attachment to their parents prospectively reported\nlower levels of ASB in the presence of deviant peer\naffiliation (Vitaro et al. 2000). Given that all youth are not\nequally susceptible to deviant peer influences, there is a\nneed to identify moderators of deviant peer effects on ASB.\nThe detection of subgroups of youth who may be\nparticularly vulnerable to deviant peers may benefit from\ntargeted intervention and prevention efforts.\nOne important class of moderators that has yet to be\nthoroughly explored is genetic liability. Genetic susceptibility\nmay provide additional traction on the conditions in which\ndeviant peer affiliation predicts ASB. Among 359 6 year-old\ntwins, deviant peer affiliation and genetic risk (defined by the\nco-twin's aggression and the pair's zygosity) were each\nindependently associated with aggression. However, the\ninfluence of deviant peers was significantly stronger among\ngenetically vulnerable children, suggesting a gene\u00adenviron-\nment interaction (G \u00d7 E) (van Lier et al. 2007). Similarly, in a\nvariability in physical aggression was significantly explained\nby the interaction between friends' aggression and child\ngenetic vulnerability (based on zygosity and co-twin's\naggression). Importantly, the putative G \u00d7 E was not\nsignificant for social aggression, suggesting that G \u00d7 E\neffects may be specific to physical aggression (e.g., social\naggression is more strongly correlated with popularity and\nprosocial attention) (Brendgen et al. 2008) and different\nforms of ASB more generally (e.g., proactive vs. reactive\naggression). These studies collectively underscore the\nplausibility that genetic factors change the nature of deviant\npeer affiliation influences on ASB and the importance of\nspecifying subtypes of ASB.\nHowever, the mechanisms mediating deviant peer\naffiliation and ASB have not been ascertained. Deviant\npeer affiliation may provide an ideal context to engage in\nASB because of positive reinforcement (i.e., peer approval)\nand modeling or genetic mediation. Kendler et al. (2007)\nuncovered genetic effects on peer group deviance (Kendler\net al. 2007) and a population-based study estimated that\n64% of adolescents' exposure to peers who smoke or drank\nwas genetically influenced (Cleveland et al. 2005). Passive,\nevocative, and active gene\u00adenvironment correlations (rGE)\nraise the possibility that deviant peer affiliation effects and\nASB may be partially explained by genetic effects (Jaffee\nfactors covarying with aspects of the environment suggest\nthat molecular genetic assays constitute an important\ndirection for future research.\nDespite the value of traditional behavior genetic designs,\nthey are anonymous in that they do not identify specific\ngenetic variants, therefore preventing inferences about the\nunderlying biology regulated by genetic variation. However,\nmolecular genetic assays directly test genomic variation and\nonce they are replicated, they provide a strong empirical basis\nto explore the neurobiological consequences of genetic\ndifferences (e.g., neural recruitment/activation). One strong\ncandidate for ASB is the monoamine oxidase-A gene\n(MAOA) given that the enzyme associated with this gene\nplays a significant role in the catabolism of synaptic catechol-\namines such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinepherine.\nThe MAOA gene has been mapped to chromosome Xp11.23\u00ad\n(bp) variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism\nin the promoter region of MAOA has garnered significant\ninterest because long repeat sequences of this functional\npolymorphism result in greater transcriptional efficiency than\nshort repeat sequences (Sabol et al. 1998). Based on\nevidence from transgenic mice models (Cases et al. 1995)\nand from a carefully characterized simplex family of affected\nmales and carriers with a point mutation in the MAOA gene\n(Brunner et al. 1993), monoamine may be particularly salient\nfor ASB and related phenotypes.\nStudies of MAOA and ASB have been inconsistent,\nhowever. In a sample of nearly 1,000 7 year-old children,\nlow-activity MAOA genotypes significantly predicted\nASB, ADHD, and an aggregate measure of mental health\nproblems, but they were unrelated to emotional problems\n(Kim-Cohen et al. 2006). Main effects for the high-activity\nMAOA genotype and aggression were reported in a small\nsample of psychiatrically-referred boys (mean=9.2 years)\n(Beitchman et al. 2004). Null findings for MAOA and ASB\nreferred for intensive day or residential treatment (Young et\nboys, Huizinga et al. (2006) found no association of\nMAOA and ASB (e.g., conduct disorder (CD), arrests for\nviolence). And finally, based on 774 Caucasian adolescents\nand young adults from the National Longitudinal Study of\nAdolescent Health, MAOA was unrelated to self-reported\nASB (Haberstick et al. 2005). It is important to note that all\nof these studies were cross-sectional, with the exception of\nHaberstick et al. (2005), who collapsed multi-occasion\nmeasures of ASB into a single composite. This is a\nlimitation given that age-related changes in ASB are\nreliable and they may misrepresent differences in underly-\ning mechanisms and prognosis (Hinshaw and Lee 2003).\nLahey et al. (2002) demonstrated that boys with persistent\nconduct disorder (CD) had the highest levels of comorbid\nanxiety, depression, ADHD, and oppositional defiant\ndisorder (ODD) than youth with less stable CD. Similarly,\nmore than 90% of 7\u00ad15 year-old girls had an age of onset\nfor CD prior to age 10, with a single common pathway to\nCD consisting of the intensification of symptoms first\nevident in childhood rather than an abrupt onset in\nadolescence (Keenan et al. 2010). Thus, prospective\nlongitudinal studies are necessary to delineate unique\npathways and patterns of association.\nIn addition to psychopathology, MAOA variants are\nsignificantly related to potential endophenotypes for ASB\n(i.e., intermediate phenotypes between etiology and explicit\nbehavior) (Gottesman and Gould 2003). For example, the\n30-base pair (bp) VNTR in the promoter region of MAOA\nwas significantly associated with personality traits relevant to\nASB (i.e., harm avoidance, reward dependence) (Buckholtz\net al. 2008) and brain MAOA activity measured in vivo was\nassociated with trait measures of aggression (Alia-Klein et\nal. 2008). In addition to main effects, MAOA has been\nimplicated in interactive models for ASB across social\nenvironments. Among rhesus monkeys, the influence of\nrearing experiences on measures of aggression was stronger\namong monkeys with the low-activity 7-repeat allele of the\nMAOA genotype (Karere et al. 2009). Levels of adolescent\nand adult ASB among children with severe exposure to\nmaltreatment were significantly higher in individuals with\nthe low-activity MAOA genotypes (i.e., 3-repeat and 5-\nrepeat) versus high-activity genotypes (i.e., 3.5- and 4-\nrepeat) differed by MAOA genotype (Caspi et al. 2002).\nSubsequent validation using meta-analysis with low-activity\nMAOA genotypes defined as 2-, 3-, and 5-repeat alleles has\nalso been reported (Kim-Cohen et al. 2006). MAOA\ngenotype also moderated the teratogenic consequences of\nprenatal exposure to nicotine where boys with the low-\nactivity MAOA genotypes (i.e., 3-, 5-repeat) and girls with\nthe high-activity MAOA genotypes (i.e., 3.5-, 4-repeat)\nexhibiting more adolescent CD than youth with different\nAlthough the precise explanatory factors for MAOA\nincreasing susceptibility to negative environments are\nunknown, MAOA genotype has been implicated in the\n`socioaffective scaffold' that regulates social evaluation,\ndecision-making, and emotion regulation. That is, individ-\nuals with particular genotypes possess compromised \"neu-\nral equipment\" (p. 127) that sensitizes them to negative\nsocial and interpersonal experiences that propel the devel-\nopment of ASB (and aggressive forms in particular)\n(Buckholtz and Meyer-Lindenberg 2008). Thus, in the\ncontext of deviant peer affiliation, individuals with the low-\nactivity MAOA genotype may be differentially sensitive to\nthe deviant peer effects, given disruptions to socio-\nemotional functioning, particularly with respect to decision\nmaking in a social context. Together with evidence that\nadolescent-limited offenders, whose ASB is less heritable,\nlargely covert (i.e., status offenses), and driven substantially\nby peer networks (Moffitt et al. 2001), overt ASB should be\nmore sensitive to MAOA variation than covert ASB. To test\nthe specificity of MAOA and its association with aggres-\nsion and violence (Buckholtz and Meyer-Lindenberg 2008),\nstudies must separately assess overt and covert ASB.\nCollectively, these studies suggest that the low-activity\nMAOA genotype is a plausible candidate gene for ASB\n(and overt ASB specifically), particularly in the context of\ninteractions with variation in negative social experiences,\nincluding deviant peer affiliation.\nOverall, there are three important features of this study that\ncollectively represent an advance over previous studies. First,\nthis sample consists of adolescents and adults prospectively\nfollowed across approximately six years. This approach is\nnecessary to explore the discriminant validity of behaviorally\ndefined syndromes and disorders (Eley, Lichtenstein, and\nMoffitt 2003) and it is consistent with recommendations in\nthe area of G \u00d7 E for peer influences and aggression (van\ngiven that repeated measures designs improve the precision\nof phenotype measurement and thereby enhance statistical\npower (Schmitz et al. 1998), a longstanding challenge in the\ngenetic epidemiology of complex phenotypes (Risch and\nMerikangas 1996). Second, unlike previous studies that were\nlimited to the anonymous approach of traditional behavior\ngenetic studies, this study tested the contribution of MAO-A\ngenotype, a functional variant affecting neural activation and\nsensitivity to environments. Third, this study simultaneously\nintegrated a developmentally-informative and genetically-\nsensitive design with separate measures of overt and covert\nASB in a largely adolescent sample, given that overt and\ncovert ASB possess unique patterns of association with other\ndomains of influence (e.g., heritability, family factors).\nAlthough this is not a representative sample, the\nparticipants were not clinic-referred, thereby avoiding the\nbiases of such samples, including high comorbidity and\nearly onset of problems and impairment (Goodman et al.\n1997). To review, the goal of the study was two-fold: (1) To\ntest the independent association of deviant peer affiliation\nand MAOA genotype on self-reported ASB collected\nprospectively across three separate assessments in adoles-\ncence and early adulthood; and (2) To test MAOA as a\npotential moderator of deviant peer affiliation effects on\novert and covert ASB. Based on the extant literature, we\nhypothesize that deviant peer affiliation will positively\npredict overt and covert ASB whereas MAOA genotype\n(i.e., low-activity polymorphisms) will positively predict\novert ASB only. Furthermore, we expect that the effects of\ndeviant peer affiliation on ASB will be stronger in the low-\nversus high-activity MAOA genotype (i.e., gene\u00adenviron-\nment interaction).\nMethod\nParticipants\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add\nHealth) ascertained a stratified random sample of youth from\nU.S. high schools, with oversamples based on race-ethnicity.\ninterviewed. One year later, in Wave II, approximately\n15,000 of the same youth were assessed during in-home\ninterviews. Approximately 5 years later, an embedded genetic\nsample, consisting of all full siblings and twins, was asked to\nprovide saliva for genetic analyses in Wave III (n=3,787).\nThe subjects at Wave III had a mean age of 22.4 years (SD=\n1.7). Analyses were limited to Caucasian males to enhance\ncomparisons with existing studies of MAOA and ASB in the\n2004). Because MAOA expression in women cannot be\nunambiguously determined (Carrel and Willard 2005),\nexperts recommend that analyses of MAOA be limited to\nmen (Kim-Cohen et al. 2006). Analyses were conducted on\nII, and III, respectively. Demographic descriptions of the\nsample are provided in Table 1.\nThese data are contractually available to certified researchers\nand details are available at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/\naddhealth.

Written\ninformed consent was obtained from the parent or legal\nguardian and the adolescent for the in-home interviews.\nMeasures\nAntisocial Behavior\nAt each of the three assessments, conducted during in-home\ninterviews, individuals reported the frequency of 10 types\nof ASB, including fighting resulting in harm, group\nfighting, assault with a weapon, vandalism, selling mari-\njuana, breaking and entering, and stealing. Response\noptions for the ASB items were as follows: 0 (none), 1 or\nbehaviors at each assessment and analyzed the data as three\nseparate repeated measures. Standardized Cronbach alphas\nwaves 1\u00ad3, respectively. Although these ASB items are not\ndirectly derived from DSM-IV based inventories or inter-\nviews, they do share similar properties to CD including\nseparate measures of overt ASB (e.g., fighting) and covert\nASB (e.g., theft) and they refer to a similar period of time\n(i.e., behavior in the previous 12 months).\nDeviant Peer Affiliation\nAt Wave 1, youth were asked how many of their three closest\nfriends smoked at least one cigarette each day, smoked\nmarijuana at least 1 time each month, and drank alcohol at\nleast 1 time each month. Participants were also asked about\nhow often they took part in a fight where his/her group of\nfriends fought against another group of people (past\n12 months). Based on an ordinal scale, participants indicated\nwhether they fought with their peers against other youth 0, 1\u00ad\n2, 3\u00ad4, or more than 5 times. These four variables (smoking,\nmarijuana, alcohol, group violence) were standardized via z-\nscores and then averaged to create an overall measure of\ndeviant peer affiliation. The standardized Cronbach alpha for\nthe composite measure was 0.64.\nGenotyping\nAt Wave III, genomic DNA was isolated from buccal cells\nusing standard methods.

Tests of the association of genotype and\ndeviant peer affiliation with overt and covert ASB at each wave\nwere conducted using log-linear regression in generalized\nestimating equations (GEE) in SAS GENMOD, specifying\nPoisson distributions and an autoregressive correlation struc-\nture. GEE estimates change over time at the population level\nrather than at the individual or cluster-specific level. Because\nGEE estimate means in each assessment from available data,\nthey accommodate missing data well, especially when\nretention is high, as in the present study. GEE is superior to\ngeneralized linear models for several reasons (Hanley et al.\n2003): (1) more reliable standard errors and improved\nconfidence intervals; (2) maximum flexibility to specify the\nworking correlation matrix (e.g., exchangeable, unstructured),\nalthough auto-regressive is featured here given the clustered\nnature of the observations over time; (3) even if the matrix is\nmisspecified, parameter estimates and variance estimators are\ngenerally stable; and (4) the use of an empirical or robust\nvariance estimator is appropriate because one is typically\nunaware of the correct covariance structure.\nYouth with available genotype data did not differ in total\nASB from the youth in the Wave I sample who were not\nthough there were marginally fewer boys (47.8% vs.\nMAOA genotypes were non-randomly distributed by race-\ntion for population stratification (Hutchison et al. 2004),\nonly data from Caucasian males were analyzed to avoid\nspurious findings that are the result of allelic differences in\nancestral populations. Finally, to further characterize the\nsample of Caucasian males with MAOA genotypes featured\nin these analyses against the overall genotyped sample,\ncomparisons on age and family income were conducted.

The association of the 30-base pair\nvariable number tandem repeat polymorphism of the\nmonoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, deviant peer\naffiliation, and their interaction with self-reported overt\nand covert ASB across a 6-year period was examined.\nConsistent with the initial hypothesis, deviant peer affilia-\ntion and the low-activity MAOA genotype each predicted\novert ASB where youth with the low-activity genotypes\nreported significantly more overt ASB than youth with the\nhigh-activity genotypes. Deviant peer affiliation also posi-\ntively predicted levels of overt ASB across development,\nindependent of MAOA, age, and wave. There was evidence\nsuggestive of gene\u00adenvironment interaction (G \u00d7 E), but its\ndirection was inconsistent with our hypothesis. Deviant\npeer affiliation positively predicted overt ASB more\nrobustly among youth with the high-activity MAOA\ngenotypes than youth with the low-activity genotypes.\nFinally, deviant peer affiliation positively predicted covert\nASB, but no significant association was observed for\nMAOA and its interaction with deviant peer affiliation.\nConsistent with reports in the literature, individuals in this\nsample with the low-activity MAOA genotypes reported\nsignificantly higher levels of overt ASB across 6 years than\nyouth with high-activity MAOA genotypes. These same low-\nactivity MAOA genotypes have been implicated in conduct\ndisorder (CD) and criminal behavior (Prom-Wormley et al.\n(Vanyukov et al. 2007), although null findings have also\nbeen reported (Huizinga et al. 2006; Widom and Brzustowick\n2006).

The low-activity MAOA\ngenotype was also associated with antisocial personality\ndisorder and alterations in event related potential (ERP)\nrecording during a negative emotion-processing task (Wil-\nliams et al. 2009). Of particular relevance to the study of ASB\nand related phenotypes is the fact that in vivo studies of\nMAOA genotype suggest pleiotropic effects, including\namygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional cues and differential\nactivation of caudal regions of the anterior cingulate, which\nmediate cognitive and inhibitory control (Meyer-Lindenberg\net al. 2006). Given the centrality of negative affect and\ncognitive dimensions of ASB (Lahey 2009; Martel et al.\n2007), MAOA remains a candidate gene worthy of further\ndissection.\nThe present study extended the search for moderators of\ndeviant peer affiliation and ASB to a functional MAOA\nvariant in an adolescent sample followed into adulthood.\nAlthough there is evidence that the high-activity MAOA\ngenotypes are associated with more ASB (Beitchman et al.\naffiliation predicted overt ASB in the high-activity more\nrobustly than in the low-activity genotype contradicted\nprevious studies, although they were based on maltreatment\nresults where the low-activity MAOA genotypes interacted\nwith prenatal nicotine exposure in boys, but it was the high-\nactivity MAOA genotypes for girls. Several factors may\nexplain the patterns observed thus far for G \u00d7 E studies\ninvolving MAOA and ASB. First, research on the develop-\nment of ASB has prioritized divergent pathways to and from\nASB. Loeber (1988) proposed distinct classes of ASB,\nconsisting of exclusive substance use, non-aggressive, and\npernicious aggressive/versatile pathways. Defined as equi-\nfinality, or multiple pathways eventuating in the same\noutcome (i.e., ASB) (Cicchetti and Rogosch 1996), these\ngroups were empirically separable, but each was associated\nwith substance use problems (Loeber 1988). Thus, the\ncombination of deviant peer affiliation and high-activity\nMAOA genotype for overt ASB may represent an empiri-\ncally distinct group of ASB relative to the `main effect' of\nthe low-activity MAOA genotype when deviant peer\naffiliation was controlled. Second, theorists have proposed\nthat the nature of deviant peer influences is not identical\nacross development and ASB subtypes. Lahey et al. (1999)\nand Moffitt (1993) contend that deviant peer affiliation may\nindicate latent genetic risk in some youth (i.e., life-course-\npersistent; LCP), but play a more direct role for others (i.e.,\nadolescence-limited individuals; AL). Because LCP ASB is\nmore heritable than AL ASB (Moffitt 2003), the stronger\neffect of deviant peer affiliation in the high-activity group is\nplausible because deviant peer affiliation may simply be less\nconsequential in the low-activity group. Similarly, the\nrelative contribution and precise role of deviant peer\naffiliation and ASB in the high-activity genotypes may be\nenvironmentally mediated through processes such as peer\nreinforcement. In the low-activity MAOA genotype, deviant\npeer affiliation may be secondary to the development of\novert ASB because it disrupts neural structures and circuitry,\nwhich potentiate violence and related endophenotypes (i.e.,\nnegative emotionality) (Buckholtz and Meyer-Lindenberg\n2008). Third, given that this sample consisted of adolescents\nfollowed into adulthood, the interactive effects between\ndeviant peer affiliation and MAOA must be interpreted\nwithin the context of developmental influences. Not only are\nsome forms of adolescent ASB normative (Moffitt 2003),\ndynamic changes in the organization and connectivity of\nneural systems related to ASB (e.g., learning, reward\nsensitivity) (Galvan 2010) must be reconciled in future\ndevelopmentally-sensitive models of G \u00d7 E. In fact, previous\nstudies of G \u00d7 E for MAOA and ASB featured different\ndevelopmental periods and timelines for exposure to\nenvironmental risk. Whereas Caspi et al. (2002) assessed\nmaltreatment when participants were between 3 and\n11 years-old, physical discipline was assessed prior to age\n6 by Edwards et al. (2010), and deviant peer affiliation was\nInteractive models between MAO and environmental\nrisk have emerged, most notably for early maltreatment\nof adversity are being measured. Wakschlag et al. (2010)\nfound that prenatal nicotine exposure and the low-activity\nMAOA genotypes predicted ASB in boys, but exposure\nand the high-activity group predicted ASB in girls. Belsky\net al. (2009) re-conceptualized the nature of gene-\nenvironment interplay for disease by emphasizing that\nsusceptibility genes concurrently function as plasticity\ngenes (i.e., contribute to positive outcome) in enriching\nenvironments. Unlike diathesis-stress, the plasticity model\nexpects that the low-activity MAOA genotype will predict\nhigher ASB with environmental risk, but lower ASB with\nenvironmental enrichment. In addition, deviant peer affili-\nation may not be purely environmentally mediated, partic-\nularly for groups of youth and at particular stages in\ndevelopment, the patterns reported herein are potentially\nconsistent with this formulation. At low levels of deviant\npeer affiliation, low-activity MAOA genotypes predicted\nmore overt ASB. However, the same low-activity MAOA\ngenotypes were associated with significantly lower levels of\novert ASB in the presence of high deviant peer affiliation.\nAlthough this theory requires further empirical scrutiny, it\nchallenges assumptions about genetic susceptibility, envi-\nronmental adversity/nurturance, and the development of\npsychopathology.\nThere are several important implications of this study.\nFuture studies of genetic and environmental influences on\npsychopathology must transcend the identification of risk\nfactors and risk indicators to identify risk processes. Rutter\n(2006) argued that genetic influences can be environmentally\nmediated and environmental effects can be genetically\nmediated. Thus, designations of genetic and environmental\nrisk do not necessarily convey the actual mechanisms\nunderlying their association with outcome. Identifying these\nunderlying processes should be prioritized in future genetical-\nly informative studies. For example, in this study, deviant peer\naffiliation for the group of children with the high-risk MAOA\ngenotype may simply be a risk indicator rather than a\npotential causal risk factor for youth without the low-risk\ngenotype. Next, developmental influences are frequently\nignored in genetic studies that rely on cross-sectional designs\nand highly dispersed age ranges. But, prospective longitudinal\ndesigns not only improve statistical power, they may also\nchange estimates on the prevalence of psychopathology\nrelative to retrospective designs (Moffitt et al. 2010). These\ndesigns also permit informative tests of genotype \u00d7 time\ninteractions to ascertain differences in genetic influence over\ntime. This is particularly relevant given that the heritability of\nASB changes from childhood to adolescence (Rhee and\nWaldman 2002). Finally, future studies of G \u00d7 E must\nconsider the possibility that different models of G \u00d7 E and\nrGE operate with respect to the etiology of disorder from\nthose models of interplay that may maintain or further amplify\ninitial trajectories of disorder.\nThe current study features several methodological assets\nincluding a relatively large sample and a prospective\nlongitudinal design. However, there are several important\nlimitations. First, ASB was measured and analyzed as count\ndata, thereby preventing inferences about diagnostic criteria\n(e.g., conduct disorder) and functional impairment. It is\nunclear whether these patterns of association would be\npreserved across other phenotypic approaches. Future\nresearch must adopt alternative methods to phenotypic\nclassification that are developmentally-informed. For exam-\nple, Odgers et al. (2008) derived four latent classes from the\nDunedin sample using growth mixture models that were the\nbasis for hypotheses about the developmental trajectories of\noffending in men and women. Coupled with prospective\nlongitudinal designs, latent class methods (e.g., latent\ntransition analysis) may discern groups of offenders and\npotentially identify predictors of continuity. Second, this\nsample consisted of a wide age range of participants (12\u00ad\n20 years). Consequently, deviant peer affiliation cannot be\nuniformly interpreted across this period. For example, for\nyoung adult participants, having peers who smoke and\ndrink is likely to be quite normative relative to adolescents.\nIn fact, when the deviant peer affiliation construct featured\nin this study excluded the items that assessed peers who\nsmoke and drank (based on the fact that 18\u00ad20 year-olds\ncan legally smoke and drink), the interaction with MAOA\nwas no longer significant (results available from author\nupon request). Thus, peer deviance must be defined in\naccordance with developmental theories and expectations\nand perhaps also with socio-cultural standards. Third, Add\nHealth presently consists only of single polymorphisms\nfrom five candidate genes. Thus, linkage disequilibrium\npatterns could not be discerned and genomic control could\nnot be used to address population stratification with the\nentire sample (i.e., including all racial-ethnic groups)\n(Weder et al. 2009). Fourth, genome-wide approaches are\nthe emerging standard in genetics, allowing for anonymous\ninterrogation of variation across the entire genome. Because\ncomplex phenotypes are explained by numerous genes,\neach of modest effect size (Risch and Merikangas 1996),\ntraditional candidate gene approaches may progress the\nfield more slowly than genome-wide methods and related\ninnovations (e.g., copy number variation) (Cook and\nScherer 2008). Finally, the study does not provide methods\nto identify potential mediating endophenotypes, particularly\nthose derived from in-vivo (e.g., neuroimaging) assays or\npsychometrically-sound clinical assessment (e.g., neuropsy-\nchological functioning). To advance the field, studies that\nprioritize repeated measures, diverse genetic and biological\nassays, and careful phenotypic characterization will im-\nprove traction on gene\u00adenvironment interplaying underly-\ning the development and persistence of ASB.\n"
