Other more invasive\nmodalities include percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) and\nopen or laparoscopic ureterolithotomy. Shock-wave litho-\ntripsy is often an outpatient procedure, whereas URSL may\nrequire admission in certain situations. Extracorporeal shock-\nwave lithotripsy is most efficacious for smaller stones incar-\ncerated in the upper ureter, whereas URSL provides a better\nstone-free rate for larger or more distal stones.3,4\nMany studies have compared the effectiveness between\nthe 2 procedures; however, there are fewer studies on a\nnational level. There are 2 reports from Taiwan. Huang et al5\nused hospital-based records to compare the effectiveness of\nthe 2 treatments and showed that URSL was significantly\nmore effective than shock-wave treatment for upper-third\nureteral stones. Chang et al compared treatment effective-\nness for distal ureteral stones and showed that URSL was\nmore efficacious than SWL in both cost and success rate.6\nThere are additional procedures after primary treatment such\n1China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan\n2Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan\n3Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan\nCorresponding Author:\nWen-Chi Chen, China Medical University, No. 91, Hsueh-Shih Road,\nEmail: wgchen@mail.cmu.edu.tw\nTable 1.

A\nchi-square test was carried out to examine the differences of\ncosts and comorbidities among different groups. A linear\nregression model was used to examine the costs of treat-\nments, and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the\nvariables was calculated for each cohort.

Three\ndecades later, the urologist still has to decide whether to proceed\nwith SWL or URSL when the probability of spontaneous stone\npassage is low.6 The European Association of Urology guide-\nlines included both SWL and URSL as standard treatment\nmodalities for ureteral stones, but SWL was favored for proxi-\nmal stones <10 mm and URSL was favored for distal stones\n>10 mm. It does acknowledge that whether to proceed with\nSWL or URSL is not a simple decision, and many factors must\nbe considered.3 Studies to aid the urologist to make this decision\nhave been performed over the past 20 years.\nEarlier retrospective single-center studies compared the cost\nbetween SWL and URSL in the treatment of distal ureteral\nstones and concluded that URSL was more cost-efficient.5,7,8 A\nretrospective single-centered study of proximal upper urinary\ntract stones suggested that SWL seemed to be reasonable for\nrenal calculi, but URSL remained the treatment of choice for\nproximal ureteral stones in terms of cost-effectiveness.9 In\nanother retrospective single-centered study of patients with\nproximal ureteral stones, the cost and stone-free rate (SFR)\nwere compared between those who received SWL and URSL\nwith holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser, and con-\ncluded that even when the stone burden was larger in the URSL\ngroup, URSL proved to be more cost-effective and provided a\nbetter SFR than SWL.5 A more recent study from a regional\nhospital in Taipei arrived at a similar conclusion, but a pneu-\nmatic lithotripter (Swiss LithoClast; EMS, Nyon, Switzerland)\nwas used instead of holmium: YAG laser.9\nLotan et al10 reviewed the costs and success rates of obser-\nvation, URSL and SWL in the treatment of ureteral stones\ndescribed in the literature, and then constructed a decision\ntree model using computer software to compare the cost, and\nfound that URSL was more cost-effective than SWL. Matlaga\net al11 reviewed 8 studies that compared the SFR and cost-\neffectiveness between SWL and URSL for ureteral stones,\nand showed that URSL was better than SWL in both SFR and\ncost-effectiveness; however, the review was biased by small\nstudy number, heterogeneous data, and research methods.

In contrast, another randomized study on proximal\nureteral stones compared the SFR and complication rate of\nlaparoscopic ureterolithotomy, SWL, and URSL, and con-\ncluded that URSL has a lower complication rate than SWL.15\nThe aforementioned study did not evaluate cost-effectiveness.\nEven for renal stones, SWL may be less cost-effective than\nURSLwhen the stone is less than 15 mm in the greatest length.16\nCone et al16 published an article showed the cost-effectiveness\ncomparison of ureteral calculi treated with URSL versus SWL.\nThis retrospective study revealed superior SFR for ureteral\nstones less than 1.5 cm treated with URSLcompared with SWL.\nTheir decision analysis model demonstrated that when SFR for\nURSL, SWL is not a cost-effective treatment option. Based on\nthese findings, they suggested that careful stratification and\nselection of stone patients may enable surgeons to increase the\ncost-effectiveness of SWL. To avoid the inclusion of patients\nwithout ureteral stones into the study population due to input of\nincorrect ICD codes, our inclusion criteria included a treatment\ncode that confirms the original diagnosis of ureteral stone in\neach entry. We calculated the costs of treatment within 45 days\ninstead of documenting a single procedural fee, because second-\nary procedures may follow an unsatisfactory primary proce-\ndure, which may lead to increased costs within that period.\nOur study showed that URSL was the most cost-effective\ntreatment of choice for ureteral stones if the calculation\nincluded the cost incurred by additional treatment up to 45\ndays postoperatively. Our results supported the previous\nstudy by Huang et al5 that compared the overall treatment\ncost during admission among stone treatment modalities, but\nthat study did not include the costs of additional treatment\nafter primary intervention. Huang et al found that the overall\ntreatment cost was higher in the SWL group without reach-\n143.5). After stratification by the location of the stone(s), the\noverall treatment cost was significantly higher in the extra-\ncorporeal SWL group than in the URSL group for patients\nwith upper-third ureteral stones, irrespective of stone size.\nOur data also revealed that the cost of SWL is significantly\n816.8) when the costs incurred by postoperative treatment\nwithin 45 days of primary intervention were included. In\nfact, URSL was the least costly primary intervention modal-\nity among all the treatment groups when postoperative treat-\nment costs were included in the calculation.\nThe management of ureteral calculi has evolved over the\npast decades with the advent of new surgical and medical treat-\nments. The current guidelines support conservative manage-\nment as a possible approach for ureteral stones sized 10 mm.\nMore recently, Alevizopoulos et al17 showed that conservative\nmanagement is clinically effective with a significant cost-ben-\nefit, particularly for the subgroup of stones sized 0 to 4 mm,\nwhere a need for follow-up scans is in dispute. We separately\ninvestigated whether the presence of comorbidities increased\nthe medical costs in patients who received lithotripsy, and the\nresults were significantly positive. Patients with comorbidities\nhave higher medical costs in our study. More complications\nrelated to underlying comorbidities may increase cost, but this\nrelationship is more established for PNL.18,19\nThis is a nation-wide study comprising of data contributed by\nvarious health care providers, from clinics to tertiary referral\nmedical centers, unlike the traditional multicenter or multina-\ntional study,20 which limits the number of institutions involved.\nTable 4.

National\nHealth Insurance Research Database could not provide certain\ndetails, such as stone size, location, or stone quantity. The\nincrease in cost may be related to usage of chronic medications\nbut not necessarily complications related to surgery. Therefore,\nthis may be the causes of higher cost in PNL and laparoscopy.\nHowever, SWL and URSL might be in a same condition of\nchoice which can be compared. A similar limitation applies to\nthe comparison of treatment modality for different stone sizes.\nConclusions\nIn conclusion, SWL as the primary treatment for ureter stone\nwas associated with a higher cost when compared with URSL.\nIn terms of cost-effectiveness, URSL is superior to SWL and\nPNL. Underlying comorbidities increases the overall medical\ncost during the treatment of ureter stones. More data are\nneeded to delineate the specific parameters that may affect the\ncost at a national level.\nAuthors' Note\nThe design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analy-\nsis, and interpretation of the data; and preparation, review, and\napproval of the manuscript were the sole responsibility of the authors\nlisted and were not influenced by the research's sponsor.
