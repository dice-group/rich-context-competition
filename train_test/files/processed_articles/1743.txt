One particularly\nuseful outcome is health status, which can be determined by\npatient self-report using well established and carefully validated\nquestionnaires such as the Medical Outcomes Study Short\nForm 36 (MOS SF-36) [2]. Studies have shown that the MOS\nSF-36 is sensitive to changes in health in general populations\n[3]. Ware et al. [4] have linked changes in MOS SF-36 scores to\nthe performance of systems of care. Efforts to infer quality\nfrom such assessments may be misleading, however, if we do\nnot account for differences in patient's clinical characteristics,\nor case-mix, that can also influence changes in health status.\nRisk adjustment is a methodology to control for patient\ncharacteristics that may affect health care outcomes.

Selim et al.\nof measures are currently applied to adjust for risk across\nambulatory populations [5]. Although these applications rep-\nresent significant advances in the measurement of case-mix,\nthey focus primarily on cost and care utilization. Studies have\nshown that both the socioeconomic background and individ-\nual clinical status of patients influence performance measure-\nments [4,6]. However, methods for risk adjustment to predict\nchange in health status are yet to be tested.\nIn this article, we aimed to develop and validate a compre-\nhensive approach for risk adjustment of change in health sta-\ntus to assess the performance of integrated service networks\nin the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). These net-\nworks are designed to provide coordinated and integrated\ncare with an emphasis on outpatient treatment. Given that\nthey vary in geography and patient characteristics, they offer a\nunique opportunity to study case-mix adjustment for change\nin health status. In this study, we specifically addressed three\nresearch objectives: (i) to determine whether clinically credi-\nble and statistically reliable risk-adjusted models can be\ndeveloped, (ii) to examine whether case-mix differences exist\nacross integrated service networks, and (iii) to assess whether\nrisk adjustment alters judgements of network performance.\nMethods\nStudy population\nThis study used data from the National Survey of Ambulatory\nCare Patients [7]. Any veteran who received ambulatory care in\nVHA integrated service networks between 1 January 1997 and\nwork encompasses a geographic region with an average of 7\u00ad10\nVA medical centers, 25\u00ad30 ambulatory care clinics, 4\u00ad7 nursing\npatients completed a mailed survey in February 1998. Of those\nwas administered 18 months after the baseline survey. We iden-\ntified 8708 patients with missing follow-up information.\nOutcome measures\nWe measured outcomes using the Veterans Rand 36-items\nHealth Survey (VR-36) [9], a reliable and valid measure of\nhealth-related quality of life modified from the MOS SF-36\nand mortality data. The SF-36 scales were summarized into\nphysical (PCS) and mental component (MCS) scales [10]. The\ntwo summaries, PCS and MCS, were scored using a linear\nt-score transformation that was normed to a general US\npopulation. Mortality was determined using the VHA Benefi-\nciary Identification and Record Locator Subsystem File. This\nfile is a fairly complete and accurate (95%) database because it\nis used to determine benefits to survivors of veterans [11].\nThe outcomes were the decline in PCS and MCS at the\n18-month follow-up. The rationale for choosing `decline' was\nbecause poor outcomes reflect potentially poor quality of care\n[12]. The cut points for `decline' were based on two standard\nerrors of a point-in-time score, a similar strategy used in the\nMedical Outcomes Study [3]. Decrements of more than -6.5\npoints in PCS scores have been associated with increased risk\nof both hospitalization and mortality [12]. Declines in MCS\nby more than -7.9 have been observed in those with clinical\ndepression compared to those without depression [13].\nPatients who died were aggregated in the outcome of decline\nin PCS but were excluded from MCS [3,14].\nChoice of risk adjustors and data sources\nWe used three domains of risk adjustors: demographic and\nsocioeconomic information, diagnoses, and baseline health\nstatus [15]. However, these concepts are not, strictly speaking,\nindependent domains of risk. The specifications of the rela-\ntionships among the different domains of risk and change in\nhealth status will be addressed in the rest of this section.\nSociodemographic data are considered proxies for pre-\nexisting physiological reserve as well as for preferences and\neducation, which may affect patients' perception of illness\nand how they use the health care system. Information about\nage and gender was obtained from the VHA Outpatient\nClinic File. Race, marital status, level of education, and\nemployment status, on the other hand, were patients' self-\nreported data. We also included a VHA administrative proxy\nfor income, the means test, because the VHA uses it to clas-\nsify patients based on their incomes (<$20,000 versus\n>$20,000) for consideration of (co)payments for some serv-\nices such as medications and transportation to VHA facilities.\nDiagnoses are the basis for understanding pathophysiol-\nogy, choosing therapy, and predicting health outcomes [16].\nWe categorized diagnoses using the Comorbidity Index, which\nwas developed to predict health status [17]. This diagnosis-\nbased case-mix measure uses conditions that are commonly\nencountered in outpatient clinic visits. We calculated the\nComorbidity Index scores as the unweighted count of 30\nmedical and 6 mental conditions. We used ICD-9-CM diag-\nnoses from the VHA administrative files that were recorded\nBaseline health status is a significant predictor of change in\nhealth status. Investigators have noted that high baseline\nfunctioning was a predictor of worsened functioning [18],\nwhereas poor baseline health status was associated with sub-\nsequent improvement [19]. We used tertiles of the baseline\nPCS and MCS scores (`high', `intermediate', and `low') to min-\nimize correlation errors with the outcome of change in health\nstatus and to improve the interpretation of the resulting beta\ncoefficients.\nStatistical analysis\nOur first objective was to create clinically credible and statisti-\ncally reliable risk-adjusted models to predict decline in PCS\nand MCS. We used a random sample of 2/3 of the study\npopulation (derivation sample of 21,215 subjects) to develop\nthe models. This was done in several stages to examine how\nthe selection of different dimensions of risk affects the\nUse of risk-adjusted change in health status\nperformance of the models. We only retained variables signi-\nficant at the P  0.05 level in the final risk adjustment models\nfor the derivation sample. We then applied regression coeffi-\ncients from those models onto the remaining 1/3 of the\nsample (validation sample of 10,608 patients). We used two\nmeasures to assess the performance of the models [15]. First,\nwe calculated the c-statistics test, which reflects the predictive\npower of the models to discriminate among patients by ordering\nthem according to rates of the outcome event. A c-statistic\nvalue of less than 0.5 indicates poor discriminatory power of\nthe model. Second, we used the Hosmer\u00adLemeshow statistic\ntest to evaluate the calibration of the model. Patients were\ndivided into deciles, based on the expected risk for decline in\nPCS or MCS. Within each decile, the expected rate of\nworsening was compared with the observed rate of worsen-\ning. A P-value greater than 0.05 indicates a good fit.\nFor our second objective, we calculated the case-mix as the\nexpected rates of decline in PCS and MCS at the network\nlevel. This was accomplished by using the multivariate regres-\nsion models to calculate the expected outcomes for each\npatient in every network. Since patients who died were classi-\nfied as `decline' in PCS, we used a previously developed\nmodel to calculate the probability of death [20]. This was\ndone because the population on which death can be assessed\nconsists of all persons who completed the baseline survey,\nbut the population on which MCS and PCS can be assessed\nconsists of a different population of patients who completed\na follow-up survey. The following formula was used to com-\nbine both probabilities to compute the expected decline rates:\n[probability (death) + probability (decline in PCS) \u00d7 (1 \u00ad\nprobability (death)]. We applied analysis of variance to test for\ndifferences in case-mix or expected rates among the 22 inte-\ngrated service networks.\nFor our third objective, we first examined whether net-\nworks had higher or lower `worse' rates than expected. To do\nso, we compared each network's observed (unadjusted) rate\nof decline with the expected rate of decline. To calculate the\nobserved decline in PCS rate, we used the following formula:\nmortality rates + (1 \u00ad mortality rates) \u00d7 (decline in PCS rates).\nSecond, we calculated adjusted rates of decline in PCS and\nMCS at the network level. The adjusted rate for a network\nwas its observed rate divided by its expected rate, multiplied\nby the mean of the rates observed for all networks. Next we\nexamined the number of networks that changed their rank\nafter adjustment with special attention to the identification of\noutliers. We defined an outlier as being at least two standard\nerrors above (better) or below (worse) the mean predicted\nchange for the network average. Networks were blinded in\nthis analysis for purposes of confidentiality.\nResults\nSimilar to the VA outpatient clinical population, the study par-\nmale, 80% were white, 64.5% had less than a high school edu-\ncation, and 63% were married. The number of comorbid con-\nditions was on average 4 (SD \u00b1 2). The average baseline PCS\nrespectively. These scores are substantially lower than the gen-\neral US population in which the mean PCS and MCS are 50.\ndecline in MCS scores by more than -7.9 points.\nTable 1 summarizes the associations of individual\npatient characteristics and decline in PCS scores in the\nderivation sample. Older patients, those with a higher\nnumber of comorbidities, and those with a high baseline\nPCS were more likely to have a decline in PCS. In contrast,\nunmarried people, those employed, and those with high\nbaseline MCS scores were less likely to have a decline in\nPCS. Race, gender, educational level, and income were not\nsignificant predictors.\nTable 2 summarizes the associations of individual patient\ncharacteristics and decline in MCS in the derivation sample.\nOlder patients, those employed, and those with higher educa-\ntion, income, and baseline PCS were less likely to have decline\nin MCS. In contrast, patients with higher Comorbidity Index\nscores (more comorbidities) and those with higher baseline\nMCS were more likely to have worse MCS. Gender, race, and\nmarital status were not statistically significant predictors.\nTable 3 summarizes the stepwise multidimensional risk ana-\nlysis to predict decline in PCS scores greater than -6.5 points\nand in MCS scores greater than -7.9 points. The performance\nof the models improved by adding different dimensions of risk.\nThe final resulting model for decline in PCS scores\nincluded only the statistically significant variables from Table 1\n(age, marital status, employment, Comorbidity Index, and\nbaseline PCS and MCS). The c-statistic values of the model\nfor decline in PCS scores were 0.73 and 0.72 in the derivation\nand validation samples, respectively. Model calibration was\nconfirmed with a non-significant Hosmer\u00adLemeshow statistic\nvation and validation samples, respectively). The final result-\ning model for decline in MCS included only the statistically\nsignificant variables from Table 2 (age, marital status, educa-\ntion, income, employment, Comorbidity Index, and baseline\nPCS and MCS). The c-statistic values of the model for decline\nsamples, respectively. Model calibration was confirmed with a\nin the derivation sample. Although the Hosmer-Lemeshow\ntest showed a P-value of 0.01 in the validation sample, the\nexpected and the observed rates of decline in MCS were simi-\nlar, indicating an acceptable fit.\nFigures 1 and 2 show the networks' case-mix, as measured\nby the expected decline in PCS and MCS rates (dots). Expected\nrates of decline in PCS by network ranged from 22.8 to 29.6%.\nThe range of expected rates of decline in MCS was from 20.0 to\n23.2%. Analysis of variance confirmed that these 22 integrated\nservice networks differed significantly in their rates of expected\ndecline in PCS and MCS (P < 0.0001), which indicates signific-\nant differences in case-mix. The bars in Figures 1 and 2 denote\nobserved rates and the vertical lines with anchors indicate two\nA. J. Selim et al.\nstandard errors. When the expected rates (dots) are above or\nbelow the anchored line, the observed rates are significantly\nbetter or worse than expected. Most of the networks showed\ndifferences between the observed and expected rates of decline\nin PCS and MCS. Three networks (B, C, and U) had signifi-\ncantly (P < 0.05) better than expected rates of decline in PCS\nand one (K) had significantly (P < 0.05) better than expected\nrates of decline in MCS.

After\nrisk adjusting rates of decline in MCS, two networks (G and P)\nwere identified as bad outliers.\nDiscussion\nAccurate information on health outcomes has become an\nexpectation of regulatory and accreditation agencies. Impor-\ntant decisions, such as reimbursements and accreditations, will\nbe based on perceived performance. Our study showed that it\nis feasible to develop clinically credible risk adjustment models\nwith good statistical properties for the outcomes of decline in\nPCS and MCS in outpatient care. The resulting models pro-\nduced an expected rate for each integrated service network,\nwhich we compared with its actual rate. There were significant\ncase-mix differences across the 22 networks. Risk adjustment\naltered the assessment of network performance when com-\npared to their unadjusted rates of decline in PCS and MCS.\nThe rates of decline in PCS and MCS in the VHA were sim-\nilar to those in other population-based studies such as the\nHealth Outcome Survey [21]. However, we found that the\nrates across networks differed significantly even after compre-\nhensive risk adjustment. The fact that we found networks with\nlower-than-expected rates of decline in PCS and MCS, for\nexample, suggests that some networks are doing better than\nexpected. This opens the possibility of examining these net-\nworks to identify processes of care or management practices\nTable 4 Comparisons of unadjusted and adjusted decline in Physical Component Scale (PCS) and Mental Component Scale\n(MCS) rates: ranked from the lowest to the highest unadjusted rates of decline\n1Covariates used in the model of decline in PCS scores: age (per years <50, 50\u00ad64, and 65>), marital status (married/single/divorced-\nseparated/widowed), employment status (employed/not), comorbidities, baseline PCS (high, intermediate, high) and baseline MCS (high,\nintermediate, high).

In contrast, greater\nrates of decline are often attributed to poor quality of care and\nmay serve to identify those networks that need to improve\nhealth care services through activities such as disease manage-\nment programs or behavioral health practice guidelines.\nIn highlighting differences in case-mix across the inte-\ngrated service networks, our study provides further evidence\nfor the importance of risk adjustment, which made a differ-\nence for ranking most networks when compared with unad-\njusted rates. Some networks moved to lower ranks, meaning\nthat their performance improved relative to other networks,\nwhereas others moved to higher ranks, suggesting that they were\nnot doing so well. In addition, we found that several networks\nhad risk-adjusted rates of decline in PCS and MCS that were\ntwo standard errors below (better) or above (worse) the over-\nall mean. Since this rate is a strong indicator of a problem,\nsuch findings could give networks a much better understand-\ning of their performance and greater certainty about the need\nfor quality improvement.\nThe associations among sociodemographic characteris-\ntics, diagnoses, and decline in PCS and MCS were consistent\nwith the literature [3]. However, controlling for sociodemo-\ngraphics and comorbid illnesses explained only a fraction of\nthe variance in the outcomes measured. The same is true in\nother studies [22]. Health status at baseline was a strong sig-\nnificant predictor of decline in PCS and MCS scores.\nPatients with higher baseline physical and mental health\nwere more likely to have a decline in PCS and MCS scores\ncompared with those with lower baseline physical and mental\nhealth, respectively.\nWe should note some limitations of this study. First, in\npatients who have low PCS or MCS scores at baseline, the\nVR-36 questionnaire may be insensitive to further decline,\nwhich would bias against documenting worsening health sta-\ntus in patients who are already severely ill (`floor effect').\nAgainst this is the finding of other investigators that over half\nof the patients with low health status reported that their\nhealth status subsequently declined [23]. In addition, our find-\nings did not change when we altered the cut-points of change\nusing those from the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey\n(decline in PCS and MCS scores greater than -5.7 and -6.7\npoints for PCS and MCS, respectively), thus leaving more\nroom for decline. Second, we are missing follow-up informa-\ntion on some patients. This is unlikely to have affected our\nfindings since baseline PCS and MCS scores between those\nwith and without missing follow-up data showed only small\nfollow-up data tended to be younger and therefore probably\nwere less likely to have a decline in health status, which would\nbias our findings conservatively. Third, the c-statistics values\nsuggest a modest predictive power of the models [15]. This\nrepresents an opportunity for future work that may lead to\nimproved model performance and possibly further change in\njudgements of network performance.\nIn summary, this study advances our understanding of the\nclinical predictors of decline in PCS and MCS. We have\ndeveloped a risk-adjustment model for decline in health status\nthat can be used to assess this important outcome of ambula-\ntory care. VHA as well as non-VHA initiatives can incorpo-\nrate this methodology into their process of measuring and\nreporting performance of health care systems. Although not\nthe focus of this study, future efforts can begin to identify the\nprocesses of care that may affect patient centered outcomes.\nReferences\n1. Benson DS.
