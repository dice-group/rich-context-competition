Ferraro, PhD\nFEW families fit the notion of a \"sandwich generation,\"\nwhere adults simultaneously provide care for young chil-\ndren and elderly parents. More commonly, middle-aged adults\nwith elderly parents have children who are grown (Grundy &\ngenerational support tend to examine only two generations at a\ntime, either middle-aged adults' exchanges with elderly par-\nents (e.g., Davey, Janke, & Savla, 2005; Laditka & Laditka,\nwith young adult offspring (e.g., Aquilino, 2006; Eggebeen,\n1992). Studies rarely compare the support middle-aged adults\nprovide each generation and address the pivotal role that\nmiddle-aged adults may experience within families. By exam-\nining only two generations, researchers have precluded an un-\nderstanding of intergenerational support in the context of\nmultiple generations. Indeed, middle-aged adults may help\nmembers of both generations (Attias-Donfut & Wolff, 2000;\nGrundy & Henretta; Soldo, 1996), but we know little about\nhow support provided to members of one generation is associ-\nated with support to members of the other generation.\nThis study examined middle-aged adults' exchanges with\neach of their grown children and living parents. We assessed\nthe flow of generational support to grown children versus\nparents.We were interested in why most families give greater\nsupport on average to a grown child than to an aging parent\nand asked whether affection and offspring's needs explain\nthis flow of support. In cases where middle-aged people pro-\nvided more to their parents than to their children, we sought\nto understand whether parental needs explained this pattern.\nGenerational flow of support in a life course\nperspective\nThe literature suggests that in Western countries, inter-\ngenerational support typically flows downstream. That is,\nsupport flows from parents down to the younger generation,\nrather than the reverse. According to a life course perspec-\ntive, parents assist their children until very late in life, when\ndeclines in health reverse the normal flow and parents turn\nto their children for assistance (Fingerman & Birditt, 2009;\nZarit & Eggebeen, 2002). Studies in the United States docu-\nment financial gifts and loans (McGarry, 1999) and practical\nsupport (Suitor et al., 2006) parents provide to grown\nchildren. Similar findings are evident in Europe (Albertini,\nstudies do not address three-generation families and the\ndecisions middle-aged adults make when they have grown\nchildren and aging parents (for an exception, see Attias-\nDonfut & Wolff, 2000). Furthermore, two additional issues\nremain to be addressed.\nFirst, we do not know whether middle-aged adults provide\nsupport to each of their grown children or only to specific\nchildren who have particular needs or affectionate relation-\nships with them. Prior studies have addressed total support\nWho Gets What and Why? Help Middle-Aged Adults\nProvide to Parents and Grown Children\nKaren L. Fingerman,1 Lindsay M. Pitzer,1 Wai Chan,1 Kira Birditt,2 Melissa M. Franks,1 and Steven Zarit3\n1Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.\n2University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n3Pennsylvania State University, University Park.\nObjectives. Middle-aged adults engage in support exchanges with generations above and below. This study investi-\ngated (a) how support to one generation is associated with support to the other and (b) factors accounting for whether\nparents or offspring receive more support in a family.\nMethods. Middle-aged adults aged 40\u00ad60 years (N = 633) completed telephone interviews regarding their relation-\nships and support exchanges with each grown child and living parent.\nResults. Multilevel models revealed that most participants provided more support to the average grown child than to\nthe average parent. Yet, a proportion of the sample reversed this pattern, providing more support to parents. Mediation\nmodels revealed that middle-aged adults provided greater support to offspring because they viewed offspring as more\nimportant than parents and offspring had greater everyday needs (e.g., being a student, not married). Parental disability\naccounted for greater support to parents.\nDiscussion. Discussion integrates solidarity theory, developmental stake, and contingency theory. Most middle-aged\nadults provide more to grown offspring than to parents, consistent with their greater stake in their progeny. Middle-aged\nadults also respond to crises (i.e., parental disability) and everyday needs (i.e., offspring student status) in providing\nintergenerational support, in accordance with contingency theory.\nKey Words: Family--Grown child--Intergenerational exchanges--Intergenerational support--Parent--Social\nsupport--Transition to adulthood.\nmiddle-aged adults provide to grown offspring (e.g., Albertini\noffspring (Aquilino, 2005). Some studies have provided in-\nformation regarding support to multiple grown children\nbut these studies typically involve elderly parents and middle-\naged offspring, without considering the third generation.\nThus, the first purpose of this study was to ascertain whether\non average, each grown child within a given family receives\nmore support than each living parent.\nSecond, the downstream pattern of support may be nor-\nmative but may not describe all families. If most families\ngive appreciably more support to offspring than to parents,\nbut a small proportion of families give more support to\nparents, the average flow of support will be downstream.\nFamilies that provide greater support to parents will not\nbe evident. Here, we examined variability in generational\ndiscrepancies in multigeneration families.\nExplanations for generational disparities\nin support\nWe know little about explanations for typical patterns of\ngenerational support. Why do middle-aged adults typically\nprovide more support to grown offspring than to their par-\nents in most families? In those families where parents re-\nceive more support than offspring, is parental disability the\nonly explanation? We examined these questions.\nThe literature regarding intergenerational exchanges is\nrich in theoretical perspectives. Two of these perspectives in\nparticular may provide explanations for the discrepancies in\nsupport to different generations. Solidarity theory suggests\nthat family members proffer help out of love and affection\n(e.g., Rossi & Rossi, 1990; Silverstein, Parrott, & Bengtson,\n1995). This theory pertains to groups and explains why one\nset of family members engages in rich exchanges of sup-\nport, whereas another family manifests few transfers among\nmembers. Scholars also have applied intergenerational soli-\ndarity theory to intergenerational ties, testing whether indi-\nviduals provide more support to family members for whom\nthey feel greater affection (e.g., Rossi & Rossi; Silverstein,\nmental stake hypothesis, derived from intergenerational\nsolidarity theory, extends this argument. According to this\nhypothesis, parents have a stake in grown children as their\nfuture. Parents are emotionally invested in offspring and\nfeel more positive regard for offspring than offspring feel\nfor parents (Fingerman, 2001; Giarrusso, Stallings, &\nprovide more support to grown children than to aging parents\ndue to their emotional bonds and stake in their progeny.\nThe second theoretical perspective that may help explain\npatterns of generational support concerns the needs of each\ngeneration. Contingency theory in sociology (Eggebeen &\nDavey, 1998) and altruism theory in economics (Schoeni,\n1997) posit that family members receive more help when\nthey have greater needs (Eggebeen, 1992; McGarry &\nmay explain why middle-aged adults may offer more help\nto members of one generation on average than to those of\nanother generation, even in the absence of greater affection\nfor specific family members.\nContingency theory applies to the typical downstream\nflow of support to grown offspring to meet their everyday\nneeds. In the United States, prolonged education, career ex-\nploration, and transient romantic ties foster increased\ndependency on parents among well-off young adults,\nwhereas underemployment, single parenthood, and uncertain\nwork schedules elicit support from parents for less well-off\nyoung adults (Aquilino, 2006; Fingerman, Miller, Birditt, &\nflect everyday needs arising from statuses offspring occupy.\nFor example, parents provide greater assistance to offspring\nwho are students than nonstudents (Attias-Donfut & Wolff,\nmore support than married offspring (Fingerman, 2000;\nRossi & Rossi, 1990). Middle-aged adults also assist grown\nchildren with labor-intensive demands of young children\n(Casper & Bianchi, 2002). With regard to generational pat-\nterns, clearly, offspring are more likely to be students or to\nhave young children than are elderly parents. Furthermore,\nalthough many elderly women are widowed, young adults\nstill are more likely to be unmarried than older adults (U.S.\nContingency theory also explains the life course reversal\nin support patterns that favor older parents when they\nare incapable of accomplishing daily tasks on their own\n(Eggebeen & Davey, 1998). The downstream flow of sup-\nport may reverse when parents incur health declines and dis-\nability (Zarit & Eggebeen, 2002). Family members provide\ncare for older adults who face prolonged health declines at\nthe end of life. Middle-aged children are the most common\ncaregivers, followed by spouses (Wolff & Kasper, 2006).\nDisability rates have decreased over the past three decades\n(Schoeni, Freedman, & Martin, 2008), however, and less\nthan one fifth of families are involved in parental caregiving\nat any time in the United States (Grundy & Henretta, 2006).\nIn families where a parent has incurred disabilities, how-\never, we expected support to flow upstream to parents.\nWhen middle-aged adults assist frail aging parents, they\nalso may extend less help to each grown child. One study to\nexamine this issue found that women who provided care for\naging parents also did provide support to grown children\n(Grundy & Henretta, 2006). That study employed a dichot-\nomous variable (whether any help is provided). Here, we\nasked how much help is provided to each offspring when\nparents require care. Based on contingency theory, we\nexpected the average amount of help to a grown child to\nbe less than the average amount of help to a parent when a\nparent suffers disabilities.\nContingency theory is less informative, however, with re-\ngard to the potpourri of other problems individuals experi-\nence. Prior research reveals that parents provide more\nsupport to offspring suffering crises (e.g., victim of a crime,\ndrug addiction; Fingerman et al., 2009; Pillemer & Suitor,\nfer more problems than parents, we would expect the pat-\ntern of support to flow downstream.Yet, when parents suffer\ntroubles, we would expect to see a generational flow of sup-\nport that favors parents.\nOther factors associated with\nintergenerational support\nWe also controlled for other factors associated with inter-\ngenerational support. We considered gender of participant and\nfamily member because mothers and daughters typically\nexchange more help than fathers or sons (Rossi & Rossi,\n1990). We included participants' marital status because mar-\nried adults are more likely to support other generations than\nthose who are divorced, remarried, or single (Aquilino, 2005;\nShapiro, 2003). Participants' income, education, and health\nalso were assessed because adults of higher socioeconomic\nstatus (SES) and in better health provide more family sup-\nport (Attias-Donfut & Wolff, 2000; Henretta, Grundy, & Har-\nGiven that proximity constrains provision of certain types of\nhelp, we included geographic distance between parties (Suitor,\nSechrist, & Pillemer, 2007b). People may provide support\nbased on support they receive (e.g., Henretta, Hill, Li, Soldo,\n& Wolf, 1997). Thus, we controlled for amount of support\neach parent or offspring provides to the middle-aged adult.\nFinally, we controlled for family size. Resource depletion\ntheory suggests that children in larger sibships receive fewer\nGrundy & Henretta, 2006). Two parents are not necessarily\nin competition for resources, but nonetheless, we controlled\nfor number of parents.\nIn sum, we examined middle-aged adults' support to each\nparent and each grown child. Hypotheses were as follows:\nHypothesis 1: We expected most families to manifest a\ndownstream flow of support and to report more help to\nthe average grown child than to the average parent.\nHypothesis 2: In the majority of families where middle-\naged adults provide more support to the average offspring\nthan to the average parent, we expected affectional soli-\ndarity (i.e., greater affection and importance of offspring)\nto explain the generational flow of support. We also tested\ncontingency theory and expected everyday needs arising\nfrom normative statuses offspring occupy (student, un-\nmarried, and parent of young children) to mediate sup-\nport favoring offspring.\nHypothesis 3: In families where middle-aged adults provide\nmore to the average parent than to the average offspring, we\nexpected parental disabilities or crises to explain the pattern.\nMethods\nSample\n4.99 years) who resided in the Philadelphia Primary Met\nropolitan Statistical Area (including urban, suburban, and\nrural areas [Pennsylvania State Data Center, 2001]) from\n331 women). Each participant had at least one child over\nthe age of 18 and at least one living parent. Recruitment\noccurred via telephone lists purchased from Genesys Cor-\nporation and random digit dialing in regional area codes.\nWe oversampled neighborhoods with high density of ethnic\nminorities. As a result, 31% of the sample was identified\nas African American, 6% as multiracial, and 1% as White\nHispanic. Data were collected from January through August\nProcedures\nParticipants reported on relationships with their grown\noffspring and parents. Computer-assisted telephone inter-\nview software permitted random order of administration of\nsections of the survey pertaining to parents and to offspring.\nInterviews lasted approximately 1 hr.\nParticipants provided the name, age, and gender of each\nliving child and each living parent. For each child over the\npants then provided information regarding support, prob-\nlems in the past 2 years, marital status, distance in miles,\nand so forth. To avoid fatigue, we obtained detailed infor-\nmation regarding relationship quality for each parent and\na maximum of three grown children. We selected the child\nwho received most, the child who received least, and a\nrandom other child in families that had more than three\nchildren. Because most participants (n = 555, 88%) had\nthree or fewer children, we had complete data on most\noffspring (n = 1,251). We also considered the distribution\nof parents and offspring within families; 64% of families\nhad more children over the age of 18 than parents, 32%\nhad the same number of grown children and parents, and\n14% had one more parent than grown child (i.e., these par-\nticipants had two parents and only one child over the age\nTable 1 presents background information regarding par-\nticipants and participants' reports of their parents and grown\nchildren. Sixty-three percent of participants had one living\nparent, whereas the remaining had two living parents. On\naverage, participants had two children over the age of 18\nhad children younger than age 18 in the home.\nDependent Measure: Support Exchanges\nWe developed the Intergenerational Support Scale to assess\nsupport to each parent and each grown child: emotionally,\npractically, and in terms of, socializing, advice, finances,\nand talking about daily events. Five items were from other\nmeasures of social support (Vaux, 1988; Vaux & Harrison,\n1985), and the remaining item (listening to talk about daily\nevents) was drawn from our prior work (Fingerman, 2000).\nParticipants rated frequency of each type of support for each\nfamily member. In analyses, we reverse coded, so higher\nnumbers indicate more frequent support: 1 (less than once a\nyear or not at all), 2 (once a year), 3 (a few times a year), 4\n(monthly), 5 (a few times a month), 6 (weekly), 7 (a few\ntimes a week), and 8 (daily). Consistent with prior studies,\nwe combined the six items for each child and each parent,\nVaux; Vaux & Harrison). We present the mean of the six\nitems (which is mathematically equivalent to the sum) for\nease in interpretation. The average score for provision of\nWe examined properties of the scale separately for sup-\nport to parents and offspring. The coefficient alphas were\nthe same (a = .87 for parents and a = .88 for offspring).\nRank order of different types of support for parents and off-\nspring was consistent. Listening to talk about daily life and\nemotional support occurred most frequently, and practical\nsupport and financial support occurred least frequently,\nrespectively.\nExplanatory Variables\nFunctional disability.--We assessed functional disability\nas potential moderator of the flow of support. We asked\nwhether each parent was able to accomplish five tasks\nof daily living based on the Community Disability Scale\n(Bassett & Folstein, 1991). Among middle-aged adults'\nrelatives, 43% of mothers and 26% of fathers had at least\none functional disability, but only 3% of grown children had\na disability.\nCrises and problems.--We developed the Life Problems\nScale based on a similar list from a national study (Greenfield\n& Marks, 2006). Participants indicated whether any of their\nchildren or parents had experienced each of 10 problems in\nthe past 2 years (e.g., victim of a crime, alcohol or drug\nproblem, financial issues). When a participant indicated any\nchild incurred that problem, we asked which child(ren) had\nexperienced that problem. Likewise, when a participant\nindicated a parent had incurred a problem, we asked which\none. We coded the occurrence of each problem for each\nfamily member dichotomously (0 = did not experience\nproblem and 1 = did experience problem). As in other stud-\nies, we then used a sum of problems for each family mem-\nber (Fingerman et al., 2009; Greenfield & Marks).\nEveryday needs.--We considered parents' or offspring's\nstatuses that might evoke everyday help, including student\nstatus (1 = student and 0 = other), unemployment or retire-\nment status (1= retired or not working and 0 = working),\nmarital status (1 = married and 0 = not married or wid-\nowed), and presence of young children (1 = has children\nand 0 = does not have children).\nAffection and importance of tie.--To assess affectional\nsolidarity, we used a concise and widely used two-item\nmeasure of relationship quality (Birditt, Fingerman, & Zarit,\n2010; Fingerman, Pitzer, Lefkowitz, Birditt, & Mroczek,\nhow much each party (i.e., their father/mother/child) loves\nand cares for them and (b) how much the other party under-\nstands them from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal).\nParticipants also rated the importance of each parent or\nchild compared with other social partners: 1 (most impor-\ntant person in your life), 2 (among the 3 most important), 3\n(among the 6 most important), 4 (among the 10 most impor-\ntant), 5 (among the 20 most important), and 6 (less impor-\ntant than that). We reverse coded this item, so higher\nnumbers indicated greater importance of relationship\nPotential Control Variables\nParticipant characteristics.--Participants provided their\nage and gender during telephone screening. In the inter-\nviews, participants reported education in years and marital\ntheir health 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Participant average\nTable 1.

We also considered participants' marital status as a\npotential control variable, 1 (first marriage) to 0 (other).\nParent and offspring characteristics.--Participants re-\nported age and gender of their grown children (664 daugh-\nfathers). Adult offspring ranged in age from 18 to 46 years\nrelated with participant age (r = .63 for parents and r = .53\nfor offspring). Therefore, we included only participant's\nage in analyses.\nAs in prior studies (e.g., Suitor et al., 2007a), we con-\ntrolled for distance between the middle-aged participant's\nhousehold and those of parents and offspring. To address\npositive skew, we used a log-linear transformation of dis-\ntance in miles in the analyses.\nReciprocal exchanges.--Participants also indicated how\noften they received each type of support from each family\nmember. Again, we used the average of the six items,\na = .82. Scores for support that participants reported receiv-\nAnalytic Strategy\nOur analytic plan first focused on describing the overall\nflow of support for the sample. Then, we looked at possible\nmediators of downstream (greater support of offspring) and\nupstream (greater support of parents) within families.\nEach participant reported on multiple family members,\nand the number of parents and offspring varied between\nparticipants. We estimated multilevel models to account for\ndependence in reports on multiple family members and\nvariability in number of family members by participant. We\nused the default identity link function in SAS PROC Mixed\nand a compound symmetry covariance structure. Amount of\nsupport was the dependent variable, with generation (0 =\ngrown child and 1 = parent) as an independent variable.\nPrior to analyses, we estimated bivariate associations be-\ntween potential control variables and support because inclu-\nsion of control variables not associated with a dependent\nvariable may generate spurious associations (Rovine, von\nEye, & Wood, 1988). Based on significant correlations, we\ncontrolled the following for participant: age, gender, marital\nstatus (1 = first marriage and 0 = other), income, number of\ngrown children, and number of parents but did not include\nparticipant race, work status, health, education, or children\nyounger than age 18. Control variables pertaining to the\nparent or child included their gender, distance (transformed),\nand support they provided to the participant. An example\nsimplified equation is as follows:\nSupport to family memberij\n= a0 + a1 (generationij\n) + control\nvariables + ei\n+ dij\nLevel i represents upper level participant variables and\nlevel j parents and offspring nested within participant. Sup-\nport to family memberij\nis the amount of support from a\nparticipant to a family member (offspringj\nor parentj\nthe intercept (the amount of support when all predictors are\n0), a1 (generationij\n) is the association between generation\nand support (it is the slope), ei is the error term between\nparticipants, and dij\nis the error term associated with each\nfamily member within participants.\nWe also considered possible explanations for the genera-\ntional flow of support in different families. We expected dif-\nferent models to explain a downstream flow of support to\noffspring versus the upstream flow of support to parents,\nwith opposite generational differences on the explanatory\nvariables. For families that give more support to offspring,\nwe anticipated greater needs among offspring. For families\nthat give more to parents, we expected greater needs among\nthe parents. For ease in presentation, we examined partici-\npants engaging in downstream support (i.e., greater support\nto the average offspring) and engaging in upstream support\n(i.e., greater support to the average parent) separately.\nWe followed the standard three steps for mediation (e.g.,\nFrazier, Tix, & Barron, 2004; Kenny, Kashy, & Bolger,\n1998). First, we divided the sample into families with\ngreater support of average offspring (downstream families)\nand greater support of average parent (upstream families).\nThese families each had a discrepancy on the independent\nvariable, in different directions (i.e., more support to aver-\nage children vs more support to parent). Next, for each fam-\nily, we established that the independent variable (generation)\nand the dependent variable (frequency of support) were as-\nsociated. Then, we tested associations between the indepen-\ndent variable (generation) and mediating variables (e.g.,\naffective solidarity, normative statuses, needs) in each type\nof family. In the final step, we evaluated the association of\nthe independent and dependent variables, adjusting for ef-\nfects of mediators. Partial mediation is evident when the as-\nsociation is weaker between independent and dependent\nvariables in the presence of the mediating variable. Sobel\ntests assessed significance of the mediation effect (McKinnon,\nWarsi, & Dwyer, 1995). Pseudo R2 statistics were also com-\nputed to show the proportion of variance accounted for in\nResults\nWe first present findings regarding support to parents and\noffspring across the full sample. Then, we present media-\ntion models explaining generational discrepancies in the\ndifferent families (more support to children and more sup-\nport to parents).\nPatterns in the Generational Flow of Support\nWe expected a dominant pattern of middle-aged adults\ngenerally reporting greater assistance to the average grown\nchild than to the average parent. This expectation was con-\nfirmed in the multilevel model comparing the amount of\nhelp provided to parents and offspring in Table 2. The mul-\ntilevel model included generation as a predictor, the support\nindex as the outcome, and appropriate participant level and\nparent/offspring level characteristics as control variables.\nAs expected, most families gave more support to the aver-\nage child than to the average parent.\nTo distinguish different types of families, we then exam-\nined the proportion of middle-aged adults who engage in\neach pattern of generational support. We estimated discrep-\nancy scores in support to the average parent and average\noffspring in each family. The distribution of support was (a)\nfamilies with downstream support favoring offspring by at\nleast half a point (53% of participants), (b) families with\nupstream support favoring parents by at least half a point\n(28% of participants), and (c) families with average parent\nand offspring support scores within a half point of zero (21%\nof families). Thus, despite the overall finding that offspring\nreceive more than parents, a sizable minority of families\nprovided more support to the average parent than the aver-\nage offspring, and a proportion of families provide compa-\nrable support to members of each generation on average.\nIn families that provide more support to offspring, the\na few times a month to weekly) and to an aging parent M =\n3.42 (SD = 1.20, a few times a year to monthly). In families\nthat provided more to parents, means were similar but in\nthe reverse pattern, average support to a grown child was\nExplanations for Greater Support to Offspring or to\nParents\nWe then asked the following: (a) In families where\nmiddle-aged adults provide more support to offspring,\nwhy do offspring receive more support? (b) In families\nwhere middle-aged adults provide more support to par-\nents, why do parents receive more support? We examined\nmediation models for the participants providing greater\nsupport to offspring and the participants providing greater\nsupport to parents. We did not consider such models for\nparticipants providing comparable support to each gener-\nation because there was no significant generational dis-\nparity to explain.\nFamilies in which offspring received more support.--\nFor families in which middle-aged adults provided more\nsupport to offspring, we asked whether three factors medi-\nated the downstream flow of support: (a) everyday needs\n(e.g., student status, marital status, presence of young chil-\ndren), (b) crises in the past 2 years, and (c) affective soli-\ndarity or the generational stake (i.e., relationship quality\nand importance of other party). Because families were se-\nlected who gave more to offspring, Step 1 is provided sim-\nply for interpretation of mediation effects in Step 3. Table 3\nshows the multilevel model for the first step, indicating\nthat offspring received significantly more support than\nparents. The second step of generational disparities is not\nshown in the table 3. This step was significant for five pos-\nsible mediators; offspring were more likely to be students,\nbe unmarried, have young children, have higher quality\nrelationships, and have ties deemed more important by\nmiddle-aged adults than ties to parents. Grown children\nwere not more likely to suffer problems (e.g., financial\nproblems, alcoholism) than were aging parents in these\nfamilies.\nWe estimated the third step of the meditational models\nfor each of the five potential explanatory variables sepa-\nrately. Sobel tests revealed that three variables (being a\nstudent, unmarried, and rated as more important) partially\nmediated the generational disparity of greater support to\n.001, respectively. Positive relationship quality and having\nyoung children did not mediate the association between\ngeneration and support in these families' relationship.\nTable 3 also shows the pseudo R2 for each mediation model\nTable 2.

In sum, explanatory\nvariables in these equations accounted for only a small\nproportion of the variance in support in comparison with\nthe initial model.\nFamilies in which parents received more support.--\nAmong families in which middle-aged adults provided\nmore support to parents than to offspring, possible me-\ndiators for this generational disparity included (a) every-\nday needs (widowhood or being unmarried and retirement\nor not working), (b) functional disability and crises, and\n(c) affectional solidarity (relationship quality and impor-\ntance of tie). As can be seen in Table 4, the Step 1 model\nconfirmed greater support to parents than to offspring.\nStep 2 is not shown. This step was significant for five\npossible mediators; parents in these families were more\nlikely than offspring to be retired or not working, have\nmore functional disabilities, have a great number of cri-\nses, have higher quality relationships, and be deemed\nmore important than offspring. Parents were not more\nlikely to be unmarried than grown offspring in these\nfamilies.\nFor Step 3, two variables partially mediated the associa-\ntion between generation and support, functional disability,\np < .001, respectively. As can be seen in Table 4, the slope\nfor generation was .59 at Step 1 and .34 for parental dis-\nability and .47 for parental crises or problems. Table 4\nshows pseudo R2 for these mediation models in comparison\nwith the initial model.\nPost Hoc Tests\nStability of findings.--To ensure stability of findings in\nthe flow of support, we reestimated models separately for\ndifferent sociodemographic groups. The pattern of findings\nregarding overall flow of support did not differ for men\nor women or for Black families and White families.

For each parent\nand offspring, we generated a discrepancy score in com-\nparison with other family members. First, we estimated a\nmean support score, representing the average support to all\nmembers in each family. Then, we subtracted that within-\nfamily mean support score from each parent or offspring's\nsupport score. A positive discrepancy score indicates that\nan individual receives more support than the average for his\nor her family. We used each family member's discrepancy\nscore as an outcome variable and entered generation, the\nexplanatory variables, and control variables in a multilevel\nmodel. Table 5 shows findings that confirm prior models\nfor generation and the explanatory variables. Offspring\nwere more likely than parents to receive above average sup-\nport within a given family. An individual in the family (par-\nent or offspring) received more support than average when\nhe or she was a student, unmarried, had a disability, suf-\nfered more problems, or was viewed as more important\nand had a better quality relationship with the middle-aged\nadult.\nDiscussion\nThis unique examination of support provided to multiple\ngenerations within families revealed that middle-aged adults\ntypically provided more support to grown children than to\naging parents but not in all families. In situations where\nparents suffered disability or incurred other crises, middle-\naged adults provided parents with more help than they\nprovided to offspring.

Middle-aged adults re-\nsponded to their grown chidren's everyday needs,\nemergencies, and crises, as well as the importance of the re-\nlationship. Findings from this study support the affective\nsolidarity and contingency theories of support exchange,\nsuggesting that middle-aged adults provide help due to their\nemotional investments and family member needs and crises.\nVariability in the Flow of Support to Offspring and Parents\nBecause previous studies have focused primarily on two\nprior research has not addressed how support to any given\nparent or offspring fits into a larger family context. In this\nstudy, we examined support to both generations.\nConsistent with life course perspectives regarding linked\nlives (e.g., Greenfield & Marks, 2006), events in one\ngeneration influenced experiences of another generation.\nIn general, middle-aged adults provided more support to\ngrown children than to parents. Even in families where\nparents suffered functional disabilities, parents received\nonly slightly more help than offspring did from the mid-\ndle-aged adults; the average offspring still received con-\nsiderable support. These findings support a premise of\n\"resource expansion\" (Grundy & Henretta, 2006). Middle-\naged adults may attempt to expand resources offered to\nfamily members when multiple family members experi-\nence needs, particularly when young adult offspring are in\nneed of support.\nThe caregiving literature documents costs that middle-\naged adults incur in providing care to elderly parents (e.g.,\nAneshensel, Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, & Whitlatch, 1995).\nThese burdens may also reflect displacement of support that\notherwise might have gone to grown offspring. In this study,\nwe do not know whether middle-aged adults reach a point\nwhen they will reallocate resources away from offspring or\nif strain on resources contributes to an eventual decision to\nmove a parent to a supervised care setting. Future research\nshould examine this issue.\nExplanations for Generational Disparities\nThis study also sheds light on possible explanations for\nwithin-family generational disparities in provision of sup-\nport. Overall, some theories apply across ties and other\ntheories explain behaviors in specific ties. Contingency the-\nory helps explain decisions that middle-aged adults make\nregarding allocation of resources to offspring and parents.\nAt the same time, solidarity theory plays a specific role;\nmiddle-aged adults provided support to partners they\ndeemed more important in their social networks. Consistent\nwith the developmental stake, the majority of middle-aged\nadults in this study provided more support to offspring than\nto parents because they viewed their offspring as more im-\nportant than their parents.\nWe also note structural variables associated with support.\nConsistent with prior research, offspring in larger families\nreceived less support on average than offspring in smaller\nwise, number of living parents was associated with average\nsupport to parent in these studies. These findings are consis-\ntent with a premise that support resources are finite and are\ndistributed within families. Most families give more to the\naverage offspring than to a parent, but when a parent incurs\na crisis, the average support to a grown child is less. Like-\nwise, when a greater number of family members require sup-\nport, average support to any given family member is less.\nDownstream flow of support to offspring.--In the major-\nity of families where support flowed downstream to off-\nspring, middle-aged adults responded to normative needs\nassociated with role statuses in young adulthood, such as\nbeing a student. The period of young adulthood involves\nprolonged transitions, and parents support progeny as they\ngain a foothold in adulthood (Aquilino, 2005; Furstenberg,\n2000). The lack of association between having children of\none's own and support was surprising and may reflect the\nfact that most offspring who had young children were mar-\nried. Elsewhere, researchers have found that unmarried off-\nspring receive many forms of support (e.g., advice, money,\npractical) from their parents (McGarry & Schoeni, 1997),\nas was the case in this study.\nGreater support to the average offspring also was consis-\ntent with the developmental stake hypothesis. In the major-\nity of families that provide greater support to offspring,\nmiddle-aged adults deemed ties to progeny more important\nthan ties to parents. This greater importance partially medi-\nated generational disparities in support. Support of grown\noffspring also may reflect a pattern of support of children\nthat begins in childhood. Even after children reach adult-\nhood, middle-aged parents derive rewards from continuing\nto serve as their parents (Levitzki, 2009).\nInterestingly, offspring did not incur a greater number of\ncrises than parents in these families. Prior studies have\nfound that parents differentiate among their offspring by\nproviding greater support to a sibling who incurs a crisis\ncrises did not explain the generational favoritism observed\nhere. Rather, more pedestrian needs and affection appeared\nto be at the heart of offspring support.\nUpstream support of parents.--Upstream support of par-\nents was evident when parental functional deficits necessi-\ntated hands-on care or when parents incurred crises or\nproblems (e.g., financial problems, crime). Data from other\nstudies also document increasing support to parents as they\naccrue health problems during the transition to old age\n(Eggebeen & Davey, 1998; Fingerman, Hay, Kamp Dush,\nCichy, & Hosterman, 2007; Silverstein, Conroy, Wang,\nGiarrusso, & Bengtson, 2002). Thus, middle-aged adults\nmay respond to two types of needs: everyday needs and\nemergency or crisis needs. The pattern of downstream sup-\nport to offspring in the majority of families was mediated by\neveryday needs associated with normative statuses. When a\ncrisis occurs, middle-aged adults provide greater support to\nparents with urgent needs.\nStatuses associated with everyday needs are not as evi-\ndent in late life as are events that precipitate crises. Widow-\nhood was not associated with greater support to parents than\nto offspring, although widowed parents receive more filial\nNor did retirement explain support of parents. Data were\ncollected immediately prior to the economic downturn in\n2008. Thus, at the time of data collection, most retired par-\nents had accumulated savings or social security, which may\nnot be the case today.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nWe note several limitations in this study. The study as-\nsessed a composite of tangible and nontangible support. Fu-\nture studies might seek to ascertain whether certain types of\nhelp are offered to parents and other types to offspring in\ndifferent families. We note that the support scale showed the\nsame rank order and high alphas for parents and offspring,\nsuggesting that generational disparities are consistent across\ntypes of support.\nThe study also relied on self-reports of support from only\none member of the family. Dyadic research suggests that\nadults may overreport what they provide in comparison\nwith what family members report receiving (Attias-Donfut\n& Wolff, 2000). Here, we examined disparities of support to\nmembers of different generations, however, and there is no\nreason to expect participants' reporting biases to vary by\ngeneration.\nMoreover, we did not consider the societal context of\nsupport to generations. The United States has relatively few\ngovernment support programs to assist young people aged\nHenretta, 2006). Although scholars lament the lack of sup-\nport for aging adults, older adults typically have social secu-\nrity and Medicare, programs unavailable to healthy young\nadults. As such, support of grown offspring may partially\nreflect middle-aged parents' compensation for lack of soci-\netal support.\nIn sum, middle-aged adults provided support to genera-\ntions above and below in response to their needs and the\nimportance of the relationship. In most families, support\nflowed downstream, with middle-aged adults providing\nmore support to grown children than to aging parents. The\nnormative pattern of downstream support reflected transi-\ntions of young adulthood, which involve dependency (e.g.,\nstudent) or being unconnected (e.g., single). Likewise, the\nimportance that middle-aged adults placed on a relationship\npartner contributed to support the partner received. When an\nelderly parent was disabled or suffered problems, middle-\naged adults provided more support to aging parents than to\noffspring, however. Indeed, it seems that much everyday as-\nsistance occurs in everyday contexts. As such, a majority of\nmiddle-aged adults in the early 21st century engage in a\ndownstream flow of support to each of their progeny, but\nthey may divert from this pattern when elderly parents'\nneeds are pressing or urgent.\nFunding\nIntergenerational Transfers (K.L.F., principal investigator) and grant K99\nAG029879 Promoting Well Being Across Adulthood: The Role of Conflict\nAvoidance (K.B., principal investigator), from the National Institute of Ag-\ning and a grant from the MacArthur Network on Transitions to Adulthood\n(Frank Furstenberg, Director).\n"
