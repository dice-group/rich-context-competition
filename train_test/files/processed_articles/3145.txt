He argued that rela-\ntively small groups are more effective at reinforcing commit-\nment and conformity. Small groups can use a wide array of\nrelational pressures because face-to-face interaction between\nall members of the group is possible. As groups become\nlarger, the social ties between group members weaken and\ncommitment and conformity become more difficult to\nenforce. The organization can no longer exercise the same\nlevel of control over individuals. According to this theory, by\ntheir very nature, large organizations create a less involved,\nmore heterogeneous membership. Applied to churches, Stark\nand Finke (2000) argued that social network density declines\nas congregations get larger, which in turns results in fewer\ndirect mechanisms for promoting commitment, and partici-\npation declines.\nIn spite of this strong theoretical link between size and\nmember participation, past research has failed to reveal clear\nand consistent patterns. To date, a negative relationship\nbetween size and attendance has not been established using\nnationally representative data on American congregations.\nOnly a handful of studies collect individual self-reported fre-\nquency of attendance and a measure of congregation size,\nwhich is obtained from the respondent or the respondent's\ncongregation. These studies have often relied on small sam-\nples and/or samples of one religious subgroup, and they have\nproduced variable results. One study reported no difference\nin the rates of attendance between individuals who attend\nchurches with fewer than 100 in attendance and more than\nCongregations and Life Survey (USCLS), another study\nfound that attendance was not significantly related to size\n(Dougherty and Whitehead 2011). Using USCLS poses a\nproblem. While the survey is a nationally representative\nsample of congregations, individual-level data are obtained\nafter a worship service and therefore underrepresent the\nnumber of less-frequent attenders.\n1Duke University, Durham, NC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDavid Eagle, Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research, Duke\nEmail: david.eagle@duke.edu\nThe Negative Relationship between Size\nand the Probability of Weekly Attendance\nin Churches in the United States\nDavid Eagle1\n Keywords\norganizational size, member participation, voluntary associations, Bayesian model\u00adbased imputation, church attendance,\ncongregations\n2 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World \nSeveral related studies use participation rate rather than\nattendance rate to operationalize member involvement.\nParticipation rate is measured by a (usually) denomination-\nally collected report of each congregation's average weekend\nworship attendance and total official membership. To obtain\nthe participation rate, the number of attenders is divided by\nthe total membership. The first article to use this approach\nappeared in Administrative Science Quarterly in 1971. This\nstudy of 157 Lutheran churches in South Dakota found a\nmodest negative relationship between size and participation\nrate (Wilken 1971). A priori, the relationship was predicted\nto be much stronger. The author speculated that other factors,\nparticularly the age composition of the congregation, moder-\nated the size-participation relationship. The second study\nappeared nine years later in Social Forces and focused on 58\nProtestant churches in Indianapolis. Here, the investigators\nagain found a negative relationship between size and partici-\ncongregations found that the ratio of membership to atten-\ndance was negatively correlated with size, which means that\nlarger churches have members who are less likely to attend\nregularly (Pinto and Crow 1982). Two more recent congrega-\ntional-level studies of Southern Baptist congregations\nrevealed a negative relationship between size and participa-\nStudies that use participation rate bear some important\nlimitations. Church membership does not have the same sig-\nnificance in all congregations and traditions. Some congre-\ngations stress the importance of formal membership, while\nothers downplay its significance. In addition, some have a\nlarge number of nominal members--members who rarely\nattend but retain their memberships (students away at college\nand shut-ins often fall into this category). Therefore, lower\nlevels of participation may simply reflect the fact that a par-\nticular congregation has a large nonresident, student, and/or\nelderly population. By a similar logic, higher participation\nrates may result if a congregation does not stress the impor-\ntance of formal membership. Therefore, using membership\ncounts to calculate attendance rates provides an unreliable\nestimate of the relationship between congregational size and\nthe propensity for individuals to attend regularly.\nThis research has contemporary significance given two\nmajor, related trends in American religion: There is an\nincreasing concentration of people into very large churches\n(1902) theory suggests that much of the `action'between size\nand attendance will occur in very large churches. Because\nlarge churches are relatively rare and samples of churches\ntherefore contain few very large congregations, it is difficult\nto test this relationship.\nOther research examines whether size is related to the\ndegree of support an individual gives to and receives from\nhis or her congregation. While these studies are measuring\ndifferent outcomes, they bear mentioning because, according\nto the theory, participation rates are intertwined with social\nsupport. Again, these studies have produced mixed results.\nFor instance, one study found that size was negatively related\nto an individual's perceived sense of social support (Ellison\net al. 2009); a similar finding was reported among Roman\nCatholics, where satisfaction levels were higher among indi-\nviduals in smaller parishes (Peyrot and Sweeney 2000). In\ncontrast, other research suggests that individuals who attend\nchurches with 1,000 or more attenders have more friends in\ntheir congregation than those in small churches (Stark\nsize was not related to the likelihood of an individual's pro-\nTo summarize, there is a strong theoretical link between\nsize and attendance, but the research that has examined this\nrelationship has significant limitations. Data quality issues\nabound: Attendance rates are often derived from member-\nship counts, some studies only examine a single denomina-\ntion, others reply on studies that overrepresent regular\nattenders, and most studies contain few large churches,\nwhich makes patterns hard to detect. The goal of this research\nis to provide a clearer picture of the empirical relationship\nbetween size and attendance using the best available data and\nstate-of-the-art modeling techniques. I will use multilevel,\nnationally representative data that span multiple religious\ntraditions to measure both size and attendance at religious\nservices. I will also take advantage of advances in Bayesian\nhierarchical linear modeling to estimate how this relation-\nship varies across groups.\nData and Methods\nThis research draws on combined data from the National\nCongregations Study (NCS) and the General Social Survey\n(GSS). The GSS is a representative sample of the noninstitution-\nalized adult population in the United States. If a GSS respondent\nindicates he or she attends religious services once a year or more,\nthe GSS asks for the name of the congregation, which then forms\na nationally representative sample of congregations (Chaves\ngregations in the United States by interviewing a key informant\nfrom the congregation nominated in the GSS, most often the\nsenior pastor. The NCS was not conducted in 2000; however,\nGSS asked respondents to report the size of the congregations\nthey attend. NCS response rates are 80, 78, and 73 percent for\ntions from non-Christian religious traditions, these data contain\nNCS and GSS are linked, which allows the matching of indi-\nviduals with their congregations'characteristics.\nIn this study, I conceptualize congregational characteris-\ntics as individual-level data (so, for instance, we can think\nabout a hypothetical respondent in this survey as a white,\nmarried male who attends an urban congregation with 500\nregular adult participants). Repeat nominations of the same\ncongregation occur. Of the congregations, 89 percent\nreceived a single nomination, 8 percent received nomina-\ntions from two GSS respondents, and 3 percent received\nnominations from three to seven respondents. I treat dupli-\ncate nominations as independent cases, which, because the\nGSS employs a geographically clustered sampling proce-\ndure, may not be completely valid, but the anticipated impact\nof the study design is small.\nMember participation is operationalized as a binary vari-\nable that indicates respondents who report attending worship\nservices at their congregation \"nearly weekly\" or more.\nWeekly worship service attendance is a standard measure in\nthe literature and is one of the few congregational participa-\ntion variables available in the GSS. I tested specifying the\nmodel with an ordinal outcome variable, which retains all the\ncategories of attendance, but the substance of the results did\nnot change.\nThe key independent variable in this analysis is the number\nof regular adult participants in the congregation as reported in\nthe NCS by the key informant. Specifically, respondents are\nasked to estimate the average number of attenders at all of the\ncongregation's regular worship services.\nTable 1 summarizes the number of adults in the congrega-\ntion that each GSS respondent attends, as assessed by key\ninformants. As these data show, congregation size is highly\nskewed. The median respondent attends a congregation of\nthat an individual attends has increased during the 14 years\nof the NCS. In addition, 17 respondents reported attending\ncongregations with 10 or fewer regular adult participants. I\nremoved these cases from the analysis because they were\nexerting excessive leverage on the regression results. The\nNCS has good coverage of large congregations; 279 have\nattenders.\nThere are a large number of cases wherein the key-infor-\nmant report of congregational size is missing. Rather than\ndrop these cases, I use an imputation strategy, outlined below,\nto retain these cases and increase the predictive power of the\nmodel. Key informant reports of size were missing when the\ncongregation named by the GSS respondent may have cho-\nsen not to complete the NCS, the NCS informant failed to\nreport the size of the congregation, or--the case in 2000--\nthe GSS respondent was asked for an estimate of the congre-\ngation's size but there was no NCS conducted in that year. In\nthe GSS does not ask the same size question as does the\nNCS. The GSS asks, \"About how many members does this\ncongregation have?\" Past research has shown that this ques-\ntion and the NCS \"how many regular adult attenders\" ques-\ntion are strongly correlated, with a correlation coefficient of\n.7 when both variables are logged. In this analysis, I consider\nthe key-informant report of size more accurate than the GSS\nrespondent's estimate. NCS respondents are generally senior\nclergy with an intimate knowledge of the congregation. But in\ncases where the NCS report of size is missing, the GSS con-\ngregational-size variable is used to model likely values that\nan NCS informant would have given if the response existed.\nControls\nIn this analysis, I introduce controls for factors that may\nmediate the relationship between size and member partici-\npation. We know that women, married people, and those\nwith children attend services more frequently. Large\nchurches typically offer more programs for children and\nfamilies, something that may differentially attract women\n(who are often the primary caregivers of children), married\ncouples, and those with children at home. Gender is a binary\nvariable coded 1 for female and 0 for male; a child present\nin the home is coded as 1 with no children present coded 0.\nMarital status is a categorical variable coded as never mar-\nried (reference), married, and divorced/separated/widowed.\nLarge churches are predominantly an urban phenomenon,\nand rural location is coded as 1, with urban locations coded\nas 0. Age is introduced as a continuous predictor (centered\nat the grand mean) as younger people attend church less fre-\nquently, but when they do attend, they favor larger churches\nSome have suggested that more time-pressed individuals\nmay gravitate to larger churches because they offer greater\nflexibility in terms of the degree of involvement (Chaves\namount of discretionary time is negatively correlated with\nhigher education and higher income (Jacobs and Gerson\n2004). Educational attainment is added as a categorical vari-\nable coded as less than high school (reference category),\nhigh school or GED, and bachelor's degree. Family income\nis a continuous variable that is standardized, centered, and\nIt is plausible that congregations with more per capita\nresources are able to provide better programming and sup-\nport, which leads to higher participation. It could also be true\nTable 1.

To explore this relationship, I create a variable that mea-\nsures the staff-to-adult-attender ratio. To construct this\nvariable, I add up the number of full-time and part-time staff\n(with each part-time staff member counting for one half a\nfull-time staff member) and divide it by the number of regu-\nlar adult attenders. I remove the cases where this ratio is\ngreater than or equal to .10 so as to limit the potential impact\nof outliers. This variable is not available in 2000 because the\nNCS was not conducted in that year. Missing values are\nimputed.\nPatterns of religious attendance vary considerably by reli-\ngious tradition. Table 2 shows that weekly attendance is\nhighest among black and Conservative Protestants and much\nlower among Roman Catholics and Mainline Protestants.\nChurches are also structured differently. Roman Catholics\nattend larger churches with smaller budgets and fewer staff\nthan their Protestant counterparts. Black Protestants, while\nthey attend churches with similar budgets as Conservative\nProtestants, employ far fewer full-time staff per member.\nBecause size, staffing, and congregational resources affect\nthe kinds of programs and services a congregation offers, it\nis likely that the size-attendance relationship will vary among\nreligious traditions. Rather than simply using indicator vari-\nables for religious tradition, I cluster respondents in religious\ntraditions and employ a hierarchical linear modeling\napproach. A control variable approach cannot deal with het-\nerogeneity between groups, whereas a hierarchical linear\nmodeling framework can.\nLast, I add three dummy variables to indicate the survey\nIn 2000, the NCS was not conducted, and estimates of size\nare available only from the GSS. The strategy employed to\ndeal with this issue is outlined below. There are very few\nmissing data on all controls except for income and staff ratio.\nThe two cases with missing data on age and the single case\nwith missing data on marital status were dropped. With\nincome and staff ratio, a model-based imputation strategy\noutlined by Tanner and Wong (2008) is employed to estimate\nthese values.\nI run three models: one without controls included, one\nwith all the controls save staff ratio, and a third with all the\ncontrols including staff ratio. I tested running a Bayesian\nlasso model, where a shrinkage parameter reduces potential\ncolinearity between the predictors (Hans 2009). When run\nthis way, the model did not produce substantively different\nresults, so I run the models without a shrinkage correction.\nModeling Strategy\nI use binary logistic regression to estimate the latent proba-\nbility, p, that an individual attends worship services weekly\nor more and test whether it covaries with the size of the con-\ngregation attended, net of other covariates. Initial explor-\natory data analysis using nonparametric regression revealed\na possible nonlinearity in the relationship between size and\nattendance. I add a squared size term to the model to accom-\nmodate this feature of these data. Other studies have revealed\na nonlinear relationship between size and organizational par-\nticipation for industrial organizations (Reiter, Zanutto, and\nHunter 2005). Because congregational size has such a wide\nrange, I take the natural logarithm of the size variable, log-\nnum, to compress the scale and improve the ability of the\nmodel to estimate the regression coefficients. Lognum is\nmean centered, which reduces the correlation between log-\nnum and lognum2 and leads to more reliable estimates of the\nlinear and nonlinear components of the effects (Bradley and\nTo deal with the difference between traditions but still\nretain all of the cases in a single model, I use a hierarchical\nlinear model that clusters individuals within traditions. This\nmodel contains group-specific intercepts for each religious\ntradition and group-specific slopes on lognum and lognum2.\nBecause the control variables are either not of central impor-\ntance or not likely to vary among traditions, they are added\nas fixed effects, which also reduces the number of parame-\nters to be estimated. The data are modeled as follows:\nY Bern p where\ni i\n~ ( ), (1)\nlogit p X a + X a +W +\ni i j j i j j i,k k j\n( ) = [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]\nvj N V\n,\nTable 2.

The vector p is the latent probabil-\nity that respondents attend weekly or more. The matrix W is\nthe set of k independent variables, and the vector k con-\ntains the coefficients for each of these predictors. The vector\na[j]\ncontains the random effects of size for each jth\nreligious\ntradition; the vector a1[j]\ncontains the random effects for size\nsquared. A and A1 are the average effects across all four tra-\nditions. V0 is the value of the intercept averaged over the\nfour religious traditions, and v is the vector of random effects\nfor each jth\nreligious tradition. All of the variables are stan-\ndardized to place them on a similar scale and to reduce colin-\nearity between the predictors.\nThe fact that these data contain missing values of the key\nindependent variable presents a challenge. However, when\nthis variable is missing, there is an estimate of size given by\nthe GSS respondent. To accommodate cases where the NCS\nestimate is missing but the GSS estimate is available, I\nemploy a two-part modeling strategy. For cases where the\nNCS size variable, lognum, is available, the basic hierarchi-\ncal linear model is employed. When lognum is missing, I pre-\ndict the value of the NCS variable from the GSS variable.\nPredicted values of lognum are drawn from the following\npredictive distribution:\nlognum N z where\nh h IMP\n~ , ,\nzh and \nIMP\nare estimated from the following regression:\nzh h\n= + +\nlognum and\nGSS,h  \nh indexes all of the cases with nonmissing values of the NCS\nvariable.\nAll of the regression models are evaluated using a Bayesian\nframework rather than a maximum likelihood\u00adbased approach.\nFor hierarchical models, Bayesian models are typically more\nefficient at detecting small differences between group-level\ncoefficients. They also produce a full posterior, which makes\nit much easier to produce confidence intervals around the\ncomputed predicted probabilities. The Bayesian approach also\nallows me to build in model-based imputation procedures for\nmissing values. The final model handles all the survey linking,\nimputation, and calculation of predicted probabilities and\nuncertainties in a single model.\nIn terms of prior choice for the Bayesian regression\nmodel, I use a noninformative semiconjugate prior on the\nintercept and all of the regression coefficients (normals with\nmean = 0 and precision = 0.001). For the precisions (the\ninverse of the squared standard deviation), I use diffuse\ngamma priors with a = b = 0.001. The posterior distribution\nis estimated using a Gibbs sampler, run with three chains for\nburn-in. Good mixing is observed in the chains, and there is\nno evidence that the priors are informing the results in any\nsignificant way. The posterior density of p contains the\nuncertainty resulting from the procedures used to impute val-\nues of size and income.\nThe key goal of this analysis is to produce an estimate of\nthe probability than an individual will attend services weekly\nin congregations of different sizes. To that end, I use the esti-\nmated coefficients from equation 3 to estimate the predicted\nprobabilities that an individual will attend weekly or more\nThe relationship is then plotted for each religious tradition.\nFrom the posterior estimates of the coefficients, I report the\nmean value of the parameter of interest and the 95 percent\ncredible interval. The credible interval indicates that 95 per-\ncent of the population is contained within this range of val-\nues. In the regression tables, credible intervals that do not\ncontain zero are indicated in bold.\nResults\nTable 3 contains summary statistics of each of the variables\nused in the analysis. Approximately one third of the respon-\ndents are affiliated with either a Roman Catholic or a white\nConservative Protestant congregation, with 11 percent and 18\npercent attending black Protestant or white Mainline\nProtestant congregations. Attendance is highest for white\nConservative and black Protestants, with, respectively, 59\npercent and 52 percent attending weekly, whereas for Roman\nCatholics and white Mainline Protestants, 38 percent and 42\npercent attend weekly, respectively. In keeping with the his-\ntoric disadvantages faced by African Americans, marriage\nrates, income, and educational attainment are all lower among\nblack Protestants. White Mainline Protestants are older and\nhave higher incomes and levels of education than other reli-\nIn Figure 1, I plot the predicted probability of attending\nweekly against the natural logarithm of the number of adult\nattenders in the congregation estimated from the full sample\nand from samples restricted to each of the four major\nChristian religious traditions in the United States: white\nConservative Protestant, white Mainline Protestant, black\nProtestant, and Roman Catholic. The underlying regression\ncoefficients used to produce the plots are reported in Table 4.\n6 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World \nFigure 1 reveals both important similarities and some varia-\ntion in the relationship between size and the probability of\nweekly attendance by religious tradition. Important to note,\nthe model does not credibly predict a positive relationship\nbetween size and attendance for any of the groups.\nFor white Conservative Protestants, there is evidence of a\nsmall negative relationship between size and the probability\nof weekly attendance, but the relationship is not credibly dif-\nferent from zero. For white Mainline Protestants, the models\ndemonstrate a significant, negative relationship. The proba-\nbility of attending a congregation of 50 is 0.40, attending a\n0.25--a decline of 38 percent. The pattern is similar among\nblack Protestants. In a congregation of 50 attenders, the\nprobability is 0.40, a total decline of 23 percent.\nA different pattern emerges for Roman Catholics. There is\ninitially a positive relationship between size and attendance,\nbut then it becomes negative at around the 500-attender\nmark. For Catholics, size is positively related to the probabil-\nity that an individual will attend weekly for congregations\nwith fewer than 500 participants, increasing 18 percent from\n0.40 for those attending a congregation with 50 participants\nprobability hits its maximum). From there, the relationship is\nnegative: For a congregation with 1,000 attenders the prob-\nis 0.33, a total decline from the peak of 38 percent.\nI then consider whether any key respondent or congrega-\ntional characteristics are mediating this relationship between\nthe probability of weekly attendance and size.As shown both\nin Table 4 and Figure 2, in all cases, adding the control vari-\nables does little to alter the observed relationship between\nsize and the probability of weekly attendance. In all models,\nthe coefficients on A and A1 (the group-level coefficients on\nlognum and lognum2) remain significant and similar in\nmagnitude.\nTable 3.

People with \"other\" religious affiliations excluded.\nDiscussion and Conclusions\nIn this study, I uncover a negative relationship between church\nsize and the probability of attending weekly. I found modest\ndifferences in this association across traditions, but in all\ncases, the relationship is negative. I also found little evidence\nthat this trend was mediated by the characteristics of the\nrespondent. The results show that there is a small negative\nassociation between size and attendance for white\nConservative Protestants but that it is not statistically signifi-\ncant. For white Mainline and black Protestants the models\ndemonstrate that a strong, negative relationship exists\nbetween size and the probability of attendance. For Catholics\nthe model indicates a modest positive relationship initially,\nwhich then turns negative for congregations with more than\n500 participants. The addition of control variables does little\nto change these patterns. Taken as a whole, these results fit\nwithin the theoretical perspective that argues smaller groups\nhave an easier time promoting group cohesion and participa-\ntion due to the greater density of social relationships con-\ntained within smaller organizations. It is also likely true that\npeople who are less frequent attenders may gravitate to larger\ncongregations where they do not face the same pressures to\nattend more frequently. Congregational resources--at least\ninsofar as the ratio of staff members to number of attenders\ncapture resources--do not mediate this relationship, which\nsuggests that more general organizational dynamics are driv-\ning this result.\nPlaced in the context of previous findings, what insights do\nthese results reveal? First of all, there is no evidence that large\nchurches either promote more frequent attendance or attract\nmore frequent attenders. The only models that indicate a cred-\nible, positive relationship is among Roman Catholic congrega-\ntions with 50 to 500 attenders. It is possible that this positive\nrelationship is related to the fact that many small Catholic\nchurches do not have priests assigned to their congregations.A\nlarger congregation is more likely to have a full- or part-time\npriest assigned to the parish, which may result in higher par-\nticipation. However, overall, the coefficient on staff-to-\nattender ratio was negative, which speaks against this theory.\nFor all other cases, the models do not predict that size and\nattendance have a positive relationship. Among Conservative\nProtestants I do not observe a significant negative relationship\nbetween size and the probability of attendance, which may\nsuggest that these types of congregations are able to overcome\nthe penalties associated with size. But overcoming the penalty\nassociated with size is not the same as reversing the trend. One\npossible explanation is that Conservative Protestant congrega-\ntions often heavily promote \"small group\" programs, where\nmembers participate in more intimate study groups, which\nmay compensate for any penalities associated with size\n(Dougherty and Whitehead 2011). I attempted to capture this\neffect by adding the number of groups and the level of partici-\npation in these groups, but the controls did not alter the size-\nattendance relationship. This could simply be because these\ngroups are extremely heterogeneous across congregations and\nFigure 1. Plot showing predicted probability of weekly attendance by religious tradition by log of congregational size, no controls.\nNote: Each black tick along the bottom indicates one case of that size.\n8 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World \nreligious traditions, making any relationship difficult to detect\nwith the available data. It is also possible that White\nConservative Protestants overreport their attendance more\nthan other groups (Brenner 2011). This could also explain why\nthe negative relationship is not statistically significant.\nOverreporting of weekly attendance results in more people's\nreporting more frequent attendance, biasing the estimates\nupward. Further research could explore whether evangelical\nchurches are bucking the trend or the weaker size-attendance\nrelationship is present due to overreporting.\nIt does not appear that congregational resources mediate\nthe size-attendance relationship. This is the motivation\nbehind model 3 in Table 3, where I added number of staff per\nattender as a proxy for congregational resources. Staff mem-\nbers are a key congregational resource. Most clergy spend a\nsignificant proportion of their time promoting community\ncohesion and creating opportunities for involvement.\nHowever, adding this variable did not change the overall\nrelationship between size and attendance. In addition, the\ncoefficient on staff was significantly negative. This is consis-\ntent with the possibility that congregations add staff to com-\npensate for decreased participation among the membership\nor that congregations with more staff attract people who are\nlooking for a place where they can be less involved and see\nstaff as a signal that paid, as opposed to volunteer, workers\nperform more of the core functions of the organization.\nTable 4.

Another possibility is that people who\nattend large churches find fewer personal connections in\nthese environments and do not become as attached to the\norganization as they would in other settings. It may also be\nthat in larger churches, because they offer a wider array of\nsmall-group programs, people, given limited discretionary\ntime, might use small-group attendance as a substitute for\nworship attendance. As already alluded to, neither the GSS\nnor the NCS provides sufficient detail on group involvement\nto test this theory. In addition, the other major multilevel sur-\nvey on congregations and participants, the USCLS--while it\nhas more extensive information about congregational partici-\npation--is mostly made up of respondents who attend fre-\nquently. It does not contain sufficient variation to make\nstrong claims about the impact of small groups on attendance\n(Dougherty 2004). Also, as the analysis relies on cross-sec-\ntional survey data, I cannot use these data to determine\nwhether small group involvement, in and of itself, is related\nto an increase in attendance at services.\nThe fact that adding controls to the model did little to\nmediate the relationship between size and weekly attendance\nsuggests that there is no significant relationship between any\nof the control variables and the size-attendance relationship.\nThis finding is somewhat unexpected because previous\nresearch has shown that size is related to socioeconomic sta-\ntus (SES) (Eagle 2012) and SES is related to attendance\n(Schwadel, McCarthy, and Nelsen 2009). However, given\nthese results, it appears that the size-attendance and SES-\nattendance relationships are independent from one another.\nThis research represents a major advance over previous\nstudies because it combines information across the four\nmajor Christian religious traditions in the United States.\nPrevious studies have focused on individual denominations\nor religious traditions. The fact that I found that the rela-\ntionship between size and attendance is relatively consis-\ntent and negative across religious traditions raises questions\nabout studies that identify a positive relationship between\nsize and member participation. This research also allows\nfor a more coherent theoretical framework to be applied to\nthe connection between religious participation and congre-\ngational size. The fact that organizational characteristics\nvary considerably across religious groups, but the overall\nrelationship between size and attendance is negative, sug-\ngests that more general organizational dynamics govern\nthis trend. Simmel's (1902) basic insights about the rela-\ntionship between size and member participation continue to\nprovide a compelling conceptual framework to understand\nthese social dynamics.\nFigure 2.
