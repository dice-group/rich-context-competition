For example,\nHanner (2012) has published extensive literature on disasters\nsuch as the breakup of the \"Challenger\" in 1986, the sinking\nof the Titanic in 1912, the destruction of the Hindenburg as it\ntried to land in Lakehurst in 1937, the Bhopal Chemical\n169 people and destroyed the Ringling Brothers and Barnum\nand Bailey circus. There are other natural disasters such as\nearthquakes, storms, floods, famines, and diseases\n(International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\nCannon, & Davies, 2004) that have also equally disrupted\nthe smooth functioning of society. Beyond these natural\ndisasters, other human-initiated disasters--wars, invasions,\nmassacres, riots, and terrorism (Archer & Somsook, 2011;\nUN-HABITAT, 2008)--have had a devastating toll on\nhumanity. What is important here is that these disasters con-\nnote negative feelings and images. Their effects do not only\nmanifest in the number of lives and property lost but also the\nvital livelihood support systems are perpetually ruined. What\nis more, the basic infrastructure necessary to respond to the\ndisasters is severely damaged or destroyed. As opined by\nAmanda Ripley (Time, Inc., 2012), \"learning from these\ndisasters means taking a deep breath, long after the satellite\ntrucks have gone home--and reflecting on what we can do\nbetter\" (p. 1).\nIn the past few decades, Ghana has experienced memo-\nrable disasters (both natural and man-made) with disastrous\nconsequences: They include the earthquake in James Town\neconomy (Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic\nSwedru, which 42 people lost their lives; the collapse of a\nsix-story Melcom Shopping Centre in Accra that trapped 82\nlives in 5 months (May-September 2014; Ghana Health\ndisaster, which claimed more than 158 lives are stark\n1University for Development Studies, Wa, Ghana\nCorresponding Author:\nEbenezer Owusu-Sekyere, Department of Development Studies,\nUniversity for Development Studies, P.O. Box 520, Wa, Ghana.\nEmail: oseturbo@yahoo.com\nThe Central Medical Store Fire Disaster:\nA Test for Institutional Compliance in\nDisaster Prevention in Ghana\nEbenezer Owusu-Sekyere1, Robert Yakubu Adjuik1,\nand Emmanuel Wedam1\n Keywords\nCentral Medical Store, disasters, Ghana, institutional compliance, risk prevention\n2 SAGE Open\nreminders that disasters can leave an indelible mark on\nhuman development (Songsore et al., 2009).\nIrrespective of the sources of vulnerability in the Central\nMedical Store (CMS) fire disaster, one question remains\nunresolved: What might have caused the fire that destroyed\nsuch a sensitive facility which not only have national secu-\nrity implications but was also the center of health delivery to\nmillions across the West African subregion? Answering this\nquestion is important because, to date, the cause of the disas-\nter has not been established leaving room for and encourag-\ning occasional sensational castigation by the media,\npoliticians, and disaster management experts and organiza-\ntions who discuss the issue in a unidirectional manner. The\nobjective of this article is to interrogate the range of factors\nthat might have led to the inferno that gutted the CMS, one\nof West Africa's largest medical storage facilities. The disas-\nter did not only manifest in property lost, basic medical sup-\nplies to neighboring countries were also severely interrupted.\nThe study is divided into six sections. The introductory sec-\ntion is followed by a brief literature on disasters. The third\nsection is devoted to the methodology employed in the data\ncollection and analysis. The next section presents the results,\nand it is followed by the discussions of the empirical results\nof the study. The final section of the article presents the sum-\nmary and conclusion of the study.\nUnderstanding Disasters: A Literature\nReview\nThe occurrence of disasters (both natural and anthropogenic)\nand its implications on development in particular have\nreceived increasing attention from academics and policy\nmakers in the past two decades, as demonstrated by the wealth\nof literature (see, for example, Beall & Fox, 2009; Cretney,\nUN-HABITAT, 2010). As noted by Pantuliano, Metcalfe,\nHaysom, and Davey (2012), the increasing interest in disaster\nresearch is related to the recognition of surging urbanization\nin crisis-affected countries, the prevalence of natural disasters\nin urban areas, and the difficulties confronting humanitarian\nactors in responding to such situations. \"Interest has also been\nspurred, however, by greater understanding of several inter-\nrelated factors that are exacerbating acute and chronic vulner-\nabilities in such contexts, including climate change and\nlong-term underdevelopment\" (Pantuliano, Buchanan-Smith,\nBeatley (1989) observes that until recently, scholars in the\npast perceived disasters to be one-off, unpredictable and nat-\nural events. For example, Fritz defined disasters as events\nthat are concentrated in time and space, in which a society, or\na relatively self-sufficient subdivision of a society, under-\ngoes severe danger and incurs such losses to its members and\nphysical appurtenances that the social structure is disrupted\nand the fulfillment of all or some of the essential functions of\nPyles, 2007). This understanding means that the future was\nvirtually treated as independent of the present and perhaps a\nsituation which relegates the two most important concepts in\ndisaster management, \"Disaster Resilience\" and \"Disaster\nRisk Reduction\" (DRR), to the background. Resilience\nwhich was first used by Holling (on the ability of environ-\nmental systems to absorb impact and reorganize to regain\nfull functionality; Holling, 1973) is used in disaster field as a\nway of understanding the ability of a system to avoid damage\nas a result of natural hazard impact. DRR, on the contrary, is\ndefined by the United Nations International Strategy for\nDisaster Reduction (UNISDR) as\nthe concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through\nsystematic efforts to analyze and manage the causal factors of\ndisasters, including through reduced exposure to hazards,\nlessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management\nof land and the environment and improved preparedness for\nConsequently, disaster management, which is intended to\ninclude building resilience to risk and preventing disasters\nfrom occurring (DRR) so that it offers a collective safety net\nthat has the ability to protect the general society from the\ndevastating consequences that may arise from disasters\nwhen they occur and that may eventually affect national\ndevelopments, was envisioned to be a postdisaster activity\nfocusing mainly on rescue, relief, and rehabilitation with\nemphasis on state-centric approaches (Cohen, 2004). In line\nwith this old thinking, governments were conscientiously\ninfested with this erroneous idea and started creating\nnational disaster management systems, usually of a civil\npolitically tainted nature, to fulfill this mandate (Quarantelli,\n1993). In Ghana, for example, the National Disaster\nManagement Organization (NADMO) was established in\n1996 to manage disasters and emergencies (Oteng-Ababio,\n2013). This was after the country had responded to the UN\nDeclaration, General Assembly Declaration (GAD) 44/236,\nfor Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). As these interven-\ntions tend to be response-orientated (reactive), authorities\nended up spending substantially more in responding to\nemergencies than on measures that would have helped antic-\nipate and manage risk (World Bank, 2010).\nHowever, in recent times, literature on disasters have\nfocused more on resilience and risk reduction following the\nlaunch of the UNISDR and the adoption of the Making Cities\nResilient Campaign (Cassidy & Blackburn, 2014), which\nbegan in 2010 and runs concurrently with the Hyogo\nFramework of Action (UNISDR, 2011), which seeks atten-\ntion to DRR. The Making Cities Resilient Campaign aims at\npromoting building resilience in cities from several perspec-\ntives such as raising awareness of DRR among both national\nand local governments through high-profile events; providing\ntools, technical assistance, and training to local authorities;\nOwusu-Sekyere et al. 3\nand facilitating city-to-city support networks and learning\nopportunities (Cassidy & Blackburn, 2014).\nThe focus of disasters has therefore moved toward consid-\neration of the situation created by such events rather than sim-\nply of the origin, nature, size, and speed of onset and other\nphysical attributes of the hazard or event. Undertaking risk\nassessment as part of a routine comprehensive development\nprocess has received much attention especially after some\npioneering studies by natural scientists (Intergovernmental\nThe World Bank also created a multi-hazard Urban Disaster\nRisk Index (UDRI) as a tool for baseline risk mapping.\nFurthermore, the IPCC (2011) has also called for a mix of\nincremental and transformational changes to reduce the risk\nfrom climate extremes. Emerging studies (Gaillard, Liamzon,\nRoomoney, 2008) consistently demonstrate that the causes of\nmost disasters are embedded in human social, economic, and\nenvironmental practices. In other words, the raison d'\u00eatre of\nmost disasters today have been traced to be the outcome of\ncumulative risk processes rooted in patterns of human behav-\nior, manifesting in poor land-use practices, ill-conceived\ndevelopment projects, and lack of rules and guidelines. The\ncornerstone of the Resilient City Campaign, the Hyogo\nFramework for Action, and the Sendai Framework for\nDisaster Risk Reduction (United Nations's post-2015 policy\non disasters) is the need to have an institutional basis for\nimplementing risk reduction and the need to involve all sec-\ntors and stakeholders. The three frameworks suggest that\ninstead of creating a new sector, expanding the mandate of\nexisting bodies beyond emergency preparedness and response\nto a coordinating role, bringing together the various functions\nand expertise of existing government departments to focus on\nhazard risks can be a priority. This is where many govern-\nments in developing countries including Ghana are faltering.\nMethod\nThe CMS, which is the largest repository of medical supplies\nin Ghana and serves other West African nations, is located at\nTema, the industrial hub and Port city of Ghana and 17 km\naway from the national capital, Accra. The CMS distributes\ndrugs to all the regional medical stores in supply chain that\nreaches over 216 districts in Ghana alone. The strategic loca-\ntion of the facility makes it accessible to both locally manu-\nfactured and imported pharmaceutical products from all over\nthe world. The facility caught fire on Tuesday, January 13,\n2015. The inferno razed to the ground, the entire warehouse\ndestroying equipment and drugs including those for malaria,\nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and Ebola, among others. The fire\nwhich started at about 9:45 a.m. was intense and proved dif-\nficult to fight due to the fact that the mix of items stored in\nthe warehouse kept exploding. Second, the fire outbreak\ncoincided with the strong \"harmattan winds\" (a dry rarefied\nNorth East Trade Winds), which also fanned the flames and\nkept changing the direction of the fire, a situation which\nhampered efforts at dousing out the fire.\nLast, the noticeably lack of water supply in the fire\nhydrant on the premises also hindered efforts of the firefight-\ners who had to rely on members of the Tema Water Tankers\nAssociation (private water suppliers) who carted volumes of\nwater from a nearby hydrant to replenish firefighting vehi-\ncles. It took firefighters nearly 30 hr (a day and more) to\nbring the inferno under control.\nData Collection and Analysis\nThe fieldwork was conducted in two stages: The first set of\ndata collection was conducted 2 weeks after the incidence\nhas occurred. This was the time memories of the incidence\nwere fresh in the minds of many a Ghanaian and was the time\nstakeholders were prepared to give untainted information on\nthe perceived causes, officials' complicities, respond strate-\ngies, and the way forward. Again, it was the time when hard\ncore empirical evidence (exhibits) was available. Twenty in-\ndepth interviews were conducted at this level. The interview-\nees were made up of nine workers from the CMS, five\nNational Fire Service officials, four eyewitnesses, and two\npolicemen.\nThe second set of interviews was conducted 6 months\nafter the incident and involves semistructured interviews\nwith 10 experts and key stakeholders engaged in DRR at the\nnational, regional, and metropolitan levels. They included\ntwo officials from NADMO, two officials from the Ministry\nof Health (MOH), two from the GHS, two from the Bureau\nof National Investigations (BNI), and two independent disas-\nter management experts. In addition, the research team ana-\nlyzed secondary data collected from various sources:\nexamination of reports from state agencies and civil society\ngroups, workshop and conference proceedings, and incident\nreports. The study also benefited from personal observations\nand interactions with organizational participants during the\nrescue exercise. Additional data were obtained from verified\ntranscripts of initial investigative reports and media accounts.\nThe field study allowed an opportunity to understand the\ndisaster scene, and the interviews generally explored respon-\ndents' responsibilities and level of preparedness and chal-\nlenges. In addition, the respondents' perceptions about\nGhana's level of preparedness and possible causal factors of\nthe incident were explored and analyzed.\nSome of the key questions for those who had direct\nresponsibility for DRR--NADMO, fire service, city authori-\nties, and so on--included their role in the quest for disaster\nprevention and how past experiences influence future policy\nformulation and interinstitutional relationship. One common\nquestion that ran through all the interviews was, \"Do you\nthink the incident could have been avoided (Why or why\nnot)?\" Depending on the participant, further questions were\n4 SAGE Open\nasked pertaining to how the quest for a reduction in future\ndisaster events can be realized? Each interview lasted for\napproximately 1 hr, and all were audio recorded, subse-\nquently transcribed, and finally thematically coded (Chang-\nemotional resonances of some of the interviews and the sub-\nsequent in-depth empirical analysis of the narratives allowed\nthe author to gauge how official inaction, negligence, or per-\nhaps connivance triggered the disaster. Data triangulation\nwith the datasets provided context for the study and allowed\nfor a greater point of comparison. For the purposes of confi-\ndentiality, most of the quoted materials in the article are\ntaken from our personal interviews or culled from literature.\nResults\nThe Genesis of the Inferno\nIn the event of disaster incident, the first thing is to establish\nthe cause and second to establish whose actions or inactions\nmight be responsible for the disaster. This is important as it\nhelps in developing shocks to reduce its impact as a first\nresponse strategy; later, it helps to build appropriate pre-\nparedness strategies; and in the long term, prevention capaci-\nties are built. The study revealed that the cause of the inferno\nis hard to pin down. This is because different respondents,\ndepending on their background, gave varied reasons for the\ncause of the fire disaster (see Table 1).\nAt the official level, there was widespread focus on blame\ngames, firmly directed at shadowy political opponents.\nRather than finding the cause of the disaster, the scene\nbecame the center of intense political activity (see Figure 1).\nBlaming political opponents for disasters is common\npractice in Ghana and other African countries. This thinking\nresonates with the scholarly works of Mileti (1999) and Eiser\nand Sutton (2012) when they observed in their study that\nseeking insights into the causes of disasters cannot be prop-\nerly understood or prevented without attention to the critical\nrole of human agency and societal processes. As observed by\ndisaster scholars (see Lewis & Kelman, 2010), such (mis)\nconception of the complexities in appreciating, conceptual-\nizing, and understanding disaster risks may blight effort to\ndevelop preventive capacities for such disasters.\nOn the contrary, workers from the CMS believed that the\nreal cause of the inferno which has been described as \"mys-\nterious\" from the professional point of view was caused by\nnaked and protected fire outside but near the facility. One of\nsuch workers revealed in an interview,\nThe fire may have started when we engaging in our routine\nburning of some of the expired drugs.\nThis situation was corroborated by an eyewitness, who\nmentioned that he saw some men burning some boxes of\ndrugs with petrol, and in the process the fire exploded and\ngot out of hand. He could not, however, confirm whether the\nTable 1.

I will not rule out arson and sabotage.\"\nThe President of Ghana \"This is a national catastrophe, for which someone must answer.

The fire was caused\nby the ancestral spirits.\"\nBystanders \"We saw some men burning some boxes of drugs with petrol and in the process the\nunprotected fire exploded and got out of hand.\"\nNote. CMS = Central Medical Store.\nFigure 1. The disaster scene with intense political activity.\nOwusu-Sekyere et al. 5\n\"men\" were workers from the CMS or that what they (the\nmen) were burning were expired drugs. Other workers from\nthe CMS gave a different account. The workers believed that\nthere was an unprotected fire in the neighborhoods whose\nsource was not known. This fire extended to the highly flam-\nmable facility. From all indications, the cause of the fire was\nnot readily known, a situation which also played well into the\nhands of the spiritual world. A popular spiritual leader in\nGhana attributed the cause of the inferno to the gods and\nagents of the spiritual world (see Table 1).\nFire Safety Standards at the Facility\nThe Acting Head of Public Relations of the Ghana National\nFire Service (GNFS) confirmed the existence and knowledge\nof well-crafted fire safety regulations both for public and pri-\nvate properties at the national and local levels such as the\nNational Building Regulations of 1996. This notwithstand-\ning, available statistics show that authorities managing such\nfacilities blatantly contravene these statutory regulations.\nBesides the fire safety procedures, such sensitive and public\ninterest property is also required by law to have a well-\nsecured insurance package. This is part of the resilience\nbuilding process so that in case of unexpected catastrophe,\ntheir impact could be minimal.\nThe study shows that all state assets are to be insured\nwith the State Insurance Company (SIC) under flexible\nterms and that there are also simple processes of acquiring\nfire safety requirements. Among the processes is the\napproval for planning schemes, and architectural and engi-\nneering designs. In addition, installations including fire\nsafety measures and hydrants and the installation of closed-\ncircuit television cameras at all sensitive government instal-\nlations are to be inspected and certified by the appropriate\nagencies before permission for occupancy is granted. Our\nresults show that these safety requirements had not been fol-\nlowed through. The research revealed that the fire hydrant at\nthe CMS was out of order at the time the incident occurred.\nThe fire safety certificate for the premises had long expired\nand fire extinguishers had no foams that could quench any\npreliminary naked fires. In an interview with an NADMO\nofficial, he intimated,\nIt was obvious this was going to happen, it was so obvious.\nHe questioned why a facility like the CMS was not well\nequipped with the latest technology such as smoke detectors\nand automatic sprinklers which could have mitigated the\nseverity of the damage. Similarly, a BNI official also\nobserved,\nThe mere fact that the property belong to the government of\nGhana implies that the principle of shared risk is applied because\nall the 25 million people of Ghana have a stake in that property;\nwhy did the government not insure the property on behalf of\nGhanaians, giving the sensitive nature of the facility.\nThe General Secretary of the Ghana Chamber of\nPharmacy, in an interview, chastised the authorities of the\nMOH and the GHS for not learning from the numerous dev-\nastating effects of recent fire outbreaks to put in appropriate\npolicies to forestall future disasters. He intimated that the\nrecurring disasters including recent fires at public institu-\ntions such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Economic\nand Organized Crime Unit, and the Public Account\nCommission should have been a wake-up call for state\ninstitutions to put in the necessary measures including\nenforcing the appropriate laws to avert such incidences. He\nmaintains,\nThere are several lessons that could have been gleaned from the\nevents before CMS which were blatantly overlooked. Clearly,\nthis incident and many of such nature are due to systemic\nstructural failure, rooted deep in the current poor governance\nstructure, a situation which could have been averted if those\nresponsible have enforced fire safety regulations.\nThe Acting Head of Public Relations of the GNFS again\nattributed the poor housekeeping in the warehouse to the\nspread of the fire. Flammable cylinders and other combusti-\nble materials were kept together at the warehouse, a situation\nwhich smacks of lack of proper supervision and monitoring.\nHe stated passionately,\nWhat we are seeing are signs of non-conformity to professional\npractice in warehouse keeping. Items are suppose to be kept in\nrolls with well demarcated lanes so that in case of any unexpected\nsituation, it does not easily cause great harm to the other items in\nthe same warehouse. As it is now, it looks like no one cared\nabout it.\nAn opinion leader in Tema who witnessed the incident\ndescribed the fire disaster as emblematic of the authorities'\ninability to enforce fire safety standards. He specifically\nfaulted authorities of CMS, who he opined regularly burn\nexpired drugs close to the warehouse without regard for the\nhealth and safety of the nearby residential properties. He\nsuggested that the public would stand to benefit if candid\nexamination of leadership complicities or otherwise at many\nlevels have been included in past disaster inquiries. He\nexplained that, typically, such incidents provoke a big fuss\nabout fire safety standards that ultimately yields no system-\natic reform.\nA Test for Institutional Collaboration and\nCoordination\nThe CMS fire also brought to the fore the lack of apparent\ninstitutional collaboration and coordination that exist in the\ndisaster management circles in Ghana. At the national level,\ndinate, command, and execute functions in disaster manage-\nment, it is supposed to do so with the collaboration of other\n6 SAGE Open\ninstitutions (see Ministry of Local Government and Rural\nDevelopment [MLGRD], 1996). In addition, a National\nDisaster Risk Reduction Platform for DRR and National\nDisaster Management Plan (NDMP) were created in 2005,\nfor which NADMO is the focal point but with representation\nat all levels of government. However, there is a lack of suf-\nficient institutional coordination, training, and funds and\ncapacity building. Table 2 indicates some of the agencies and\ntheir roles in disaster management in Ghana.\nThe list of agencies involved in disaster management is\nnot exhaustive in Table 2. The study showed some basic\nproblems in the implementation of disaster management\nframework among the institutions. The major problems iden-\ntified included lack of effective coordination, limited inte-\ngration and harmonization of sectoral plans, and limited\nfunds to effectively implement disaster prevention plans.\nThe connections between national sector ministries and other\nstate bodies were not sufficiently developed--such as links\nbetween NADMO, the MLGRD, and the Ministry of Interior\n(MOI). Moreover, NADMO receives limited government\nsupport in terms of engaging relevant sector agencies in\ndisaster management. Although legislation in areas related to\nDRR exists, such as the Millennium Development Authority\nlaws on environmental issues, their coordination and imple-\nmentation seem to be a problem.\nThe extent to which these laws are to be rolled out and\nenforced would require the support of all allied institutions;\nthis was corroborated in an interview with a key informant\n(an officer from the National Fire Service). He intimated,\nDisaster risk management which is supposed to be a collective\nresponsibility is still being treated as an individual affair by\nNDAMO. This tendency defeats NADMO's mandate of\nimproving upon its role of coordinating and harnessing all\nresources both human and material from all partners for timely\nand effective response emergencies. Not tapping the expertise of\nthe GNFS, Ghana Ambulance Service, and Ghana Police has\nresulted in a dispersion of effort and an ineffective use of the\nscare resources of the nation. Consequently, the needed political\nsupport for DRR has also gradually waned.\nHe stressed further that providing tools to enable translat-\ning national policies into mainstreaming planning processes\nwould help the nation in understanding the options that are\navailable for managing risks and for planning and implement-\ning local-level DRR strategies. This situation defeats the pur-\npose and implementation of the Hyogo Framework for\nAction. The key informant concluded that if the institutional\nTable 2.

They are also to ensure effective coordination and implementation of disaster\nprevention, mitigation, and preparedness measures at the local levels.\nMOI The Ministry of Interior through the respective security agencies such as the National fire Service, the Police\nService, the Military, and so on, set some standards for disaster prevention and also respond to emergency\nsituations. The MOI through the security agencies provides technical advice for building plans with regard to\nmachinery and structural layouts to reduce the impact of disasters should they occur. They also offer rescue\nand evacuation services to those trapped by fire and other emergencies and undertake any other functions\nincidental to the disaster profile of the state.\nMEST (EPA) Through EPA, the MEST is the guiding agency responsible for formulating environmental laws and quality\nstandards for the reduction of disasters that may be environmentally oriented. Mitigating disasters such as\nfloods, climate change\u00adrelated disasters, environmental pollution such as poor waste management, and water\npollution, among others, are their responsibility.\nMOH Guiding institutions of the health sector have the regulatory authority that includes the provision of emergency\nservices, including the national ambulance services. They help in the implementation of approved national\npolicies on disaster management. They also provide effective mechanisms for disease control, surveillance, and\nprevention in Ghana. They are in charge of issues pertaining to public and occupational health and hygiene, and\nperform other functions relevant to the promotion, protection, and restoration disaster-related health issues\nin Ghana.\nNote.

In any case, that is the essence of DRR.\nEarly Warning Systems and Signs\nThe study further revealed that early warning systems\n(mostly in the form of smoke and fire detection devices, reg-\nular maintenance and inspection of safety procedures) were\nnot adhered to. The study also revealed that officials whose\nduty it was to manage the facility were not abreast with the\ncombustible nature of the drugs in the stores. The study could\nnot cite any report on monitoring and assessing disaster risks\npreparedness of the facility through the different systems in\nplace. Risk assessment data, including classification of\nchemicals at the facility, were not readily available. In terms\nof human capacity, official workers at the facility lacked the\nneeded disaster preparedness skills to emergency disaster\nservices, a situation which further aggravates the develop-\nment of any early warning system. Although no lives were\nlost, the emotional storylines of some workers at the CMS,\nmost of whom belong to the lower tier on the institution's\nmanagement structure alleged that before the disaster, they\nrepeatedly alerted top management of the fact that most of\nthe fire extinguishers had expired and also warned against\nthe regular burning of expired drugs near the facility but to\nno avail. A respondent, for example, angrily shared his expe-\nrience in response to a question on what he thinks went\nwrong:\nIt is unbelievable that top managers of this facility who take\nhuge salaries at the end of the month will not listen to us anytime\nwe make a report. On several occasions, we reported to the\nmanagers to bring the fire service people to bring new\nextinguishers but they will not listen. There were also plans to\ntrain us on how to handle some of the emergency equipments\nbut this has also not taken place. It looks like they [management]\ndo not care about the safety of the place; all they think about is\ntheir monthly salaries. But for their [management] greed and\nselfishness, they could have averted this calamity. If only they\nhad listened to our many complaints.\nAn insurance consultant blamed management of CMS for\nnegligence. He intimated that it is the government's respon-\nsibility to ensure the safety of such national asset. To him,\nmanagement, and for that matter government, was guilty for\nwhat had happened. An engineer consultant and former pub-\nlic official questioned the structural integrity and quality of\nthe building and blamed the \"red-tapism\" for the nonconfor-\nmity to fire safety standards. As part of measures to prepare\nagainst future incidences (and develop early warning sys-\ntem), he advocated for an \"urgent streamlining of physical\nplanning and building regulations\" and the retraining and\nimproving the capacity of officials responsible for managing\nthe facility. Contributing, a private safety coordinator stated\nemphatically that the CMS disaster could have been avoided\nif management had been proactive by going the extra mile to\naddress the observed deficiencies in the structure.\nCounting the Cost of the Disaster\nLike the economic effects of many fire disasters in Ghana,\nthe study revealed that CMS disaster destroyed hundreds of\nthousands worth of medicines, equipment, and hospital facil-\nities belonging to Ghana and the World Health Organization.\nThe study further revealed that medical supplies worth GHS\n237 million (US$68 million) were destroyed and that the\ncountry lost 3 months drug reserve and the ability to replen-\nish the lost stock in time is very questionable, meaning lives\nare at risk. While the direct cost was not easy to equate, the\nindirect cost was very difficult to estimate as our study\nrevealed that more than 10 highly placed staff connected\nwith CMS were interdicted. What is clear is that the indirect\ncost will take years to manifest and Ghana will over the years\ngo on paying for the impact of this fire incident. From all\nindications, the CMS fire disaster has a greater significance\nand disproportionate impact on the health care delivery in\nGhana. The direct and the indirect costs of the CMS fire\ndisaster were very astronomical, and Ghana being a lower\nmiddle-income country whose budget is financed by subsidy\nallocations from donor countries cannot afford to lose such\nnational asset through a cause that could have been avoided.\nConservatively, the cost of preventing the fire incident could\nhave been far lower than the current situation of restoration.\nIt is therefore prudent that the state takes proactive measures\nto reduce the risk of fire incidents in the country, if sustain-\nable development is to be achieved.\nDiscussion\nAfter the CMS fire disaster, the government of Ghana and\nthe entire society profoundly reflected on the precautions\nthat were not taken against such an incident. Again, national\ndiscourse also centered on how new measures can be taken\nto provide a solid foundation so that Ghana can cope with or\nprevent future occurrences of such disaster events. The\nnational introspection highlighted the apparent weak institu-\ntional arrangements toward disaster risk prevention, pre-\nparedness, and mitigation in Ghana, a situation that has also\nbeen giving extensive attention in some previous studies.\nBuilding disaster risk prevention is viewed as cross-cutting\nthemes in disaster management and therefore requires proper\ncoordination of all institutions concerned with disaster man-\n2003). The framework for disaster management in Ghana\nwhich is placed under the MOI also mandates the Ministry to\nwork with the Ministries of Finance, Health, Environment,\nand Works and Housing, among others, to deliver proper\ndisaster prevention services.\n8 SAGE Open\nThe framework further enjoins such institutions as the\nNational Fire Service, Ambulance Service, the Ghana Police\nService, the SIC, and other allied institutions to work in a\ncoordinated effort to build resilience to disasters. It is there-\nfore baffling that given the evidence of these well-established\ninstitutions with the mechanisms and capacities, such state\nasset could not be protected against the unexpected disaster.\nIt is even more baffling to come to the realization that there\nare many examples from the global north which typify how\ninstitutions have collaborated to prevent the occurrence or\nreduce the impact of disasters of which the disaster manage-\nment institutions in Ghana could have learnt from\n(Satterthwaite, 2011). In principle, the fundamental goal that\nunderpins disaster management as suggested by Pelling\n(2003) which is to reinforce the centrality of all disaster con-\ncerns and adopt preventive strategies and practical measures\nto reduce its potential human and property losses should not\nbe the responsibility of one institution but should be an activ-\nity of several institutions with one common interest--the\nbuilding of resilience.\nAs opined by Oteng-Ababio (2013), sustaining effective\ndisaster risk preparedness unequivocally demands strong\npolitical commitment and durable institutional capacities,\nwhich among other things will guarantee the cooperation,\ncoordination, and collaboration among key stakeholders and\ndevelopmental activities (see also Morrice, 2013). However,\nthe CMS disaster as well as the increased frequency and\ndestructiveness of recent disasters in urban Ghana have come\nto question the political commitment and institutional capac-\nities in preventing disasters. These disaster events seem to\nsuggest that disaster management institutions are working at\nworlds apart. The CMS disaster has brought to the fore the\nneed to understand the institutional and legislative systems\nfor building preventive mechanisms against disasters. The\ndisaster has also highlighted the inextricable links between\ndisasters and human development as its impact has a devas-\ntating toll on health care delivery not only in Ghana but also\nin other countries in the West African subregion. Events and\nthe national discourse on the disaster seemed to suggest that\nthere appears to be a lack of platform that enables stakehold-\ners in disaster management to cooperate, coordinate, and rec-\noncile agendas; negotiate share-knowledge; or critically\nreflect on lessons learnt from past incidents of such nature.\nDRR is regarded as a critical component of any sustain-\nable development as evidence with the passage Sendai\nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction document to guide\n2030) coinciding with the targets of the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (World Bank, 2006). The Sendai\nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction among other things\narticulates the need for improved understanding of disaster\nrisk in all its dimensions of exposure, vulnerability, and haz-\nard characteristics; the strengthening of disaster risk gover-\nnance, including national platforms; accountability for\ndisaster risk management; preparedness to \"Build Back\nBetter\"; recognition of stakeholders and their roles; mobili-\nzation of risk-sensitive investment to avoid the creation of\nnew risk; resilience of health infrastructure, cultural heritage,\nand workplaces; strengthening of international cooperation\nand global partnership; and risk-informed donor policies and\nprograms, including financial support and loans from inter-\nnational financial institutions. This increased recognition has\nbeen fueled by the seemingly intrasectoral fragmentation of\ndisaster risks preparedness framework, a challenge which\nChang-Seng (2013) describes as not providing mechanisms\nfor feeding back into capacity building toward the formula-\ntion of disaster management policy and guidance. The CMS\nfire incident severely exceeded the capacity of city authori-\nties to provide emergency services. Among the factors\naccounting for this include the nonenforcement of statutory\nstate building regulations and the lack of early warning signs\ntoward disaster. In the main, the management failed to reor-\nganize and learn from many of the past fire incidences in\nGhana. Public agencies' disaster preparedness activities and\nefforts appeared rather ad hoc, fragmented, and uncoordi-\nnated, while their cooperation across levels and scales was\nbasically lacking.\nThe scale and magnitude of losses from the CMS disaster\ndefy easy generalization. The study further revealed that\neven with the ratification of the Hyogo Framework for\nGhana to build DRR strategies against fire disasters, design-\ning and implementing fire DRR strategies into all programs\nand policies was not well articulated. The CMS disaster con-\nnotes the prize the country paid for paying inadequate atten-\ntion fire risk. Although Ghana is making some progress with\nthe actualization of the Hyogo Framework for Action\n(NADMO, 2015), reducing fire risks to public assets seems\nto be a mirage. This is evidence from the many public facili-\nties that have suffered preventable disasters. In Accra, for\ninstance, the outbreak of fires in the two largest markets,\nMakola and Kantamanto, has become almost weekly affairs\n(Oteng-Ababio, Ohene Sarfo, & Owusu-Sekyere, 2015).\nwith an estimated loss of about US$5.4 million (Oteng-\nAbabio et al., 2015). In the case of the Kumasi Central\nMarket, which is the largest open-air market in West Africa,\nthe market experienced four devastating fire outbreaks\nand indelible scars in the minds of the fire victims. What is\neven more distressful relates to when the populace begin to\ncount their losses and also come to the realization that the\npossible causes of the incident could have been avoided.\nAgain, the study indicates that the scale and magnitude of\nthe CMS fire was due to the physical morphology and gover-\nnance structure of the facility. The disaster inevitably cause\nupheavals not only in the physical environment but also in\nthe social and economic context. Close examinations of the\nfacility reveal that it carried physical vulnerabilities due to its\nOwusu-Sekyere et al. 9\nlocation or construction practices. Physical examination\nrevealed that the facility had many structural defects, and\nmany of the inner chambers where medical supplies were\nkept were just temporal compartments without adequate fire\nrisk reduction safeguards. This situation is in sync with\nUN-HABITAT (2008) describes as \"structures derived from\nvillage prototypes but are modified by the requirements of\nspace and the availability of materials--plastic, tin, bits of\ncloth, wood and bricks, which draw on past and present\nmaterials\" (p. 69). Available data at the GNFS show an\nannual increasing incidence of urban fire in Ghana (GNFS,\n2013). The increasing frequency of fire outbreaks in the face\nof escalating demographic pressures pose a significant chal-\nlenge to the extant institutional and urban governance struc-\ntures, which have tended in most cases, to deal with the\nproblem in a reactive, ad hoc and often ambiguous manner.\nSummary and Conclusion\nThe study set out to investigate the multiplicity of factors\nthat led to the fire that destroyed the CMS, one of the largest\nstorage facilities for medical supplies in the West African\nsubregion. From all indications, the CMS disaster evokes\nsome element of institutional failure and ineptitude. While\nthe technocrats believed the incidence resulted from nonen-\nforcement of disaster prevention procedures and standards,\ncivil society and other individuals identified corruption and\ninefficiencies as a major bane. Irrespective of the source of\nvulnerability, the study highlights the fact that noncompli-\nance with institutional and governance framework contrib-\nuted to the disaster.\nThe after events and discourse on the CMS fire disaster\nrevealed that the incident could have been potentially averted\nif all key players in disaster management had played their\nrespective roles diligently. By engaging the available docu-\nments and exploring the responses of eyewitnesses about the\nroot causes of the incident, the study sheds more light on how\nthe fundamental policies underpinning DRR and disaster pre-\nparedness were virtually nonexisting or, in some cases, over-\nlooked. Generally, the thinking and understanding of disaster\nrisk management is changing. The subject is being increas-\ningly recognized as a major factor in achieving sustainable\ndevelopment. Emphasis is now being laid on risk reduction\nwith the ultimate aim of taking a holistic view of DRR and the\nimportance of linking with diverse stakeholders, taking a cue\nfrom the Hyogo Framework for Action and the Sendai\nFramework for Disaster management. In implementing the\nframeworks in Ghana, there will be the need to enhance the\ncapacity of emergency response organizations. There is also\nthe need for major state institutions to vigorously integrate\nDRR interventions into their development plans and projects.\nAs a recommendation, there should be periodic (preferably,\nmonthly or bimonthly) risk assessment of all sensitive public\nassets to gauge the measures that are being taken to reduce the\nimpact of any risk, should there be one.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nReferences\nAbbey, M.
