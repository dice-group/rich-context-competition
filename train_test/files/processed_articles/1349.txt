    "abstract": "Abstract\nThe prevalence of obesity in the United States popula-\ntion is increasing, and similar trends can be observed\namong schizophrenia patients. No thorough examina-\ntion of the actual nutritional composition of the diet of\nschizophrenia patients in the United States has been\ncarried out. We therefore employed a 24-hour diet\nrecall in 146 schizophrenia outpatients to gather infor-\nmation on different nutritional variables, such as total\ncaloric intake and total fat, protein, carbohydrate,\ncholesterol, and fiber content Data were subsequently\ncompared to data for the general population collected\nin the Third National Health and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES III). Schizophrenia\npatients as a group ate more food when compared to\nNHANES HI subjects, but the relative percentages of\ncalories derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrates\nwere not found to be different. Therefore, it is unlikely\nthat schizophrenia patients make dietary choices dif-\nferent from those of people in the general population.\nInstead, schizophrenia patients seem to eat more of the\nsame food.\n",

It is known that patients with schizophrenia in\nNorth America tend to be overweight (Allison et al. 1999).\nObesity itself is widely regarded as a major medical haz-\nard (National Task Force on the Prevention and Treatment\nof Obesity 2000) and is increasing in prevalence (Mokdad\net al. 1999). The risks include insulin resistance, diabetes\nmellitus, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased levels of high-\ndensity lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased levels of\nlow-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Obesity is also associ-\nated with gallbladder disease as well as sleep apnea,\nchronic hypoxia and hypercapnia, degenerative joint dis-\nease, and certain cancers. Obesity is an independent risk\nfactor for death from coronary heart disease (Pi-Sunyer\nWhile the etiopathogenesis of weight gain in schizo-\nphrenia remains unclear, there is consensus that obesity is\nprimarily a result of poor dietary choices (Brown et al.\n1999). There are only a handful of studies that have sys-\ntematically examined the diet of patients with schizophre-\nnia. In a nutritional assessment among people living in\n\"mental health residential houses\" in Sydney, Australia, it\nwas observed that the respondents had a significantly\nhigher prevalence of obesity (including abdominal obe-\nsity) than did the general population (Wallace and Tennant\n1998). In studies completed in Scotland and Oxford, U.K.,\nit was observed that schizophrenia patients' diet was\nhigher in fat and lower in fiber and vitamins as compared\nto the healthy controls' diet (McCreadie et al. 1998;\nBrown et al. 1999). While similar dietary trends may be\nobserved among U.S. schizophrenia patients, systematic\nstudies examining the associations between diet, sociode-\nmographic, and physical characteristics have not been car-\nried out.\nMethods\nSubjects. Patients with a DSM-FV (American Psychiatric\nAssociation 1994) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaf-\nfective disorder, and psychotic disorder not otherwise\nspecified (NOS) were recruited from the outpatient clinic\nand partial hospital at the Comprehensive Care Services at\nthe Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic by their thera-\npists, psychiatrists, and nurses. No attempts to target cer-\ntain patient groups (i.e., overweight patients) took place,\nand no randomized recruitment procedures were applied.\nSend reprint requests to Dr. R. Ganguli, Professor of Psychiatry,\nPathology and Health and Community Systems, Vice Chairman and\nChief of Clinical Services, Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic,\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 3811 O'Hara Street, Pittsburgh,\nPatients willing to participate in the study were invited to\nthe interview. Diagnoses were confirmed by patient chart\nreview. Assessments were carried out after obtaining writ-\nten informed consent according to procedures approved\nby the University of Pittsburgh Biomedical Institutional\nReview Board. The procedure took about 45 minutes per\nparticipant and yielded information in three different\ndomains: (1) sociodemographic data, (2) nutritional infor-\nmation, and (3) anthropometric measures.\nData Collection. Sociodemographic data were obtained\nby open-ended questions. When information was missing,\npatient charts were reviewed. A 24-hour diet recall using\nstandardized food models was used to collect the nutri-\ntional information. This method is widely regarded as\nsuitable for ascertaining dietary intake (Young et al. 1952;\nMadden et al. 1976) and has been employed in the\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys\n(NHANES) (Kohlmeier 1992). Weight and height were\nrecorded in kilograms and meters, respectively, and body\nmass index (BMI) was calculated (kg/m2). BMI cate-\ngories adopted by the National Institutes of Health (1998),\ngreater than 30 kg/m2, were used to categorize individuals\nin the study sample.\nBMI of patients in the study was compared to age-\nadjusted BMI for the general population from NHANES\nIII (Kuczmarski et al. 1994). Nutritional values (calories,\nprotein, carbohydrate, fat, cholesterol, fiber, caffeine) were\ncomputed using the commercially available ESHA (Eliza-\nbeth Stuart Hands and Associates) Food Processor Nutri-\ntional data for the general population from NHANES III\nyears have elapsed since NHANES III data were collected,\nthey are still commonly used as a reference standard for\nthe U.S. population.\nData Analysis. SPSS (for Windows) software was\nemployed for data analysis. Descriptive analysis includ-\ning mean, range, and standard deviation for continuous\nvariables was carried out to determine whether each\nvariable was normally distributed, and frequency counts\nfor categorical data (e.g., gender, race) were done to\nexamine the proportions of various sociodemographic\ncharacteristics. The measures obtained through the 24-\nhour recall were examined for the whole group and for\ngroups defined by different demographic characteristics\n(for males and females, Caucasians and African-\nAmericans). Student / tests and, where appropriate, an\nanalysis of variance were employed to look for statisti-\ncal differences between the means of 2 or more vari-\nables. Student / tests also were used to compare mean\nnutritional values of the patient sample to data reported\nResults\nOne hundred and forty-six patients with a DSM-IV diag-\nnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and psy-\nchotic disorder NOS were recruited. Sociodemographic\ndata are shown in table 1.\nseven patients (59.6%) could be classified as obese, indi-\ncated by a BMI of more than 30.\nThe mean BMI of sample patients was significantly\nhigher when compared to the age-adjusted reference popu-\nlation from NHANES III (mean BMI = 26.3). Similar\nresults were observed among male and female as well as\nCaucasian and African-American patients.\nAs a group, sample subjects consumed significantly\nmore total calories, carbohydrates, and fat than the refer-\nence population (table 2). The relative percentages of calo-\nries derived from the major nutrients (protein, carbohy-\ndrates, and fat) were not found to be different from the\npercentages seen in the general population. No differences\nin cholesterol or fiber intake were found with respect to\nthe NHANES ID data.\nTable 1.

Only carbohydrate\nintake came close to reaching significance (p = 0.0502, t =\n1.96). In contrast, female participants consumed signifi-\ncantly more total calories, protein, carbohydrate, and fat\nthan the reference population of the NHANES III survey.\nFemale participants also consumed more fiber than\nfemales in the general population.\nRegarding caffeine intake, white schizophrenia\nparable NHANES HI data to compare our findings on caf-\nfeine with.\nOnly 6 patients in the study reported consumption of\nalcoholic beverages during the previous 24 hours. Because\nof this small number, no reliable analysis could be carried\nout.\nLimitations\nSocioeconomic factors are known to influence the preva-\nlence of obesity. Therefore, the inclusion of a matched\ncontrol group to correct for several socioeconomic factors\n(i.e., educational level, income) would have improved the\nvalue of the results. Although having a locally collected\ncontrol group would have improved the study method-\nologically, the study funding did not allow for such an\nexpense. It should also be noted that the findings can be\nconfidently extrapolated to only similar clinical popula-\ntions: community-dwelling remitted individuals with diag-\nnoses of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. For-\ntunately, the majority of people with these disorders would\nfall into the above category.\nConclusions\nAs a group, schizophrenia patients in this study ate more\ncalories and nutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat) com-\npared to subjects in the NHANES HI study, because the\nabsolute amounts of calories derived from these nutrients\nwere higher. However, the relative percentages of intake\nfor protein, carbohydrates, and fat were not found to be\ndifferent from the pattern observed in the general popula-\ntion. Therefore, it is unlikely that schizophrenia patients\nmake dietary choices different from the choices that sub-\njects in the population would make. Instead, they seem to\neat more of the same food.\nThe high mean BMI among the study sample is con-\nsistent with the findings of other studies (Gopalaswamy\njects were divided by race and gender, black females had\nthe highest relative fat intake (37.5% of total calories) as\nwell as the highest BMI (36.1 \u00b1 6.2). The prevalence of\nhigh BMI in black females has been previously reported in\nsamples of the general population (Allison et al. 1997;\nHolmes et al. 1998) and is consistent with an increased risk\nfor medical problems in this subgroup (Cowie et al. 1993;\nWinkleby et al. 1999). It may be necessary to plan for gen-\nder- and culture-specific approaches to address the problem\nof obesity among black females. Medication also may con-\ntribute to the high mean BMI (Ganguli 1999), possibly\nthrough increased appetite or sedation, and therefore less\nenergy expenditure or endocrinological side effects (Acker-\nman and Nolan 1998). We plan to investigate the possible\ncontribution of medication to weight gain in the future.\nThe high percentage of smokers in the study sample\n(59.6%), combined with the high prevalence of obesity,\nsuggests that schizophrenia patients are at particular risk\nof developing serious medical problems associated with\nhigher mortality, which has been previously noted (Simp-\nMost patients in the sample reported that they were\nconcerned with their body weight and aware of the fact\nthat weight loss would be beneficial to their health. How-\never, patients also complained about the virtual nonexis-\ntence of structured weight loss programs to support their\nneeds. Therefore, health care providers need to develop\nand implement weight management programs to help\nthese patients change their eating patterns, lose weight,\nfeel more self-confident, and most important, reduce mor-\nbidity and mortality from physical health problems. How-\never, sustained weight reduction is a challenge even in\nnon-psychiatrically ill individuals and may take consider-\nable effort to achieve.\nReferences\nAckerman, S., and Nolan, L.J.
