Few\nstudies have evaluated the association between selenium and hypertension, with inconsistent findings. We explored the\nrelationship of serum selenium concentrations with blood pressure and hypertension in a representative sample of the\nUS population.\nMethods and Results--We undertook a cross-sectional analysis of 2638 adults 40 years old who participated in the 2003\nto 2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Serum selenium was measured by inductively coupled\nplasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg or\ncurrent use of antihypertensive medication. Mean serum selenium was 137.1 g/L.

The corresponding odds ratio for hypertension was 1.73 (1.18 to 2.53). In spline regression\nmodels, blood pressure levels and the prevalence of hypertension increased with increasing selenium concentrations up\nConclusions--High serum selenium concentrations were associated with higher prevalence of hypertension.

(Circ\nKey Words: selenium  blood pressure  hypertension  nutrition surveys\nSelenium is an essential element with antioxidant proper-\nties mediated through glutathione peroxidases and other\nselenoenzymes. Because oxidative stress is involved in hy-\npertension development,1 it has been suggested that selenium\nmay be involved in blood pressure control and hypertension\nprevention.2\u00ad4 The few studies that have evaluated the asso-\nciation between selenium and blood pressure have been\ninconsistent, reporting inverse,3,5 null,6,7 or positive8 associ-\nations. These studies were relatively small and were con-\nducted in European countries with moderately low selenium\nintake. As a consequence, the association of selenium with\nblood pressure levels is still uncertain, particularly in sele-\nnium replete populations such as the United States.\nIn the United States, selenium intake ranges from 60 to 220\ng/d,4,9,10 well above the recommended dietary allowance of\nconsequence of the high selenium content of US soil, partic-\nularly in the Northern Plains. Organ meats, seafoods, muscle\nmeats, and cereals and grains are the main sources of\nselenium in the diet, although the widespread use of vitamin/\nmineral supplements also contributes to US selenium in-\ntake.13 At these intake levels, additional selenium intake does\nnot increase glutathione peroxidase synthesis or activity, but\nrather increases plasma selenium concentration by nonspe-\ncific incorporation of selenomethionine into plasma proteins.9\nFurthermore, selenium has a narrow safety range,13 and high\nselenium concentrations in US studies have been associated\nwith increased lipid levels14 and diabetes.15,17 The objective\nof this study was thus to assess the association of serum\nselenium concentrations with blood pressure levels and with the\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\nMethods\nNHANES is conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics\nusing a complex multistage sampling design to obtain a probability\nsample of the civilian noninstitutionalized US population.

Serum selenium\nmeasurements were restricted to participants aged 40 years\nmeasurements, and 2699 participants had also blood pressure mea-\nsurements available. We excluded 2 pregnant women and 59\nparticipants with missing data on relevant covariates (ie, body mass\nindex, education, cotinine concentration, and tobacco consumption).\nSerum Selenium\nCollection materials were screened for potential selenium contami-\nnation. After blood collection, serum aliquots were frozen at 20\u00b0C\nand shipped to the laboratory. Serum selenium was measured at the\nTrace Elements Laboratory at the Wadsworth Center of the New\nYork State Department of Health using inductively coupled plasma-\ndynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS). The lab-\noratory procedures and quality control methods for serum selenium\nmeasurement have been described in detail elsewhere.19 The\nbetween-assay coefficients of variation for quality control pooled\nsamples analyzed throughout the duration of the survey ranged from\nHypertension\nBlood pressure readings were obtained by trained and certified\nphysicians following procedures developed by the American Heart\nAssociation.20 Study participants rested sitting quietly for 5 minutes\nbefore 3 consecutive blood pressure readings were obtained using a\nmercury sphygmomanometer with an appropriate size cuff (5 sizes\navailable) placed on the bare right arm. If one reading failed, a fourth\nattempt could be made.

Quality control and assurance procedures\nincluded extensive initial training, quarterly recertification, proce-\ndural checklists, and continuous review of data for systematic\nerrors.21 Hypertension was defined as having an average systolic\nblood pressure 140 mm Hg, an average diastolic blood pressure\n90 mm Hg, or current use of antihypertensive medications.\nOther Variables\nInformation on sex, age, race/ethnicity, education, menopausal\nstatus, smoking, and use of vitamin/mineral supplements was based\non self-report. Body mass index was calculated by dividing mea-\nsured weight in kilograms by measured height in meters squared.\nNutrient intake data were obtained from two 24-hour dietary recall\ninterviews,22 the first conducted in-person and a second phone\nfollow-up interview 3 to 10 days later. Average intakes were used\nwhen information was available from both interviews. Serum coti-\nnine was measured by isotope-dilution high-performance liquid\nchromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem\nmass spectrometry.23\nStatistical Methods\nParticipants were divided in quintiles of serum selenium concentra-\ntion based on the weighted population distribution. Adjusted means\nfor blood pressure differences and odds ratios for hypertension status\ncomparing each quintile of serum selenium to the lowest quintile\nwere calculated using multivariable linear and logistic regression,\nrespectively. We used 3 models with progressive degrees of adjustment.\nModel 1 was adjusted for sex, age (continuous), race/ethnicity\n(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, or\nother), and education (high school or higher versus less than high\nschool). Model 2 was further adjusted for body mass index (contin-\nuous), smoking (never, former, current), cotinine (continuous), and\nmenopausal status (yes, no). Model 3 was further adjusted for use of\nvitamin/mineral supplements (yes, no) and, in linear regression\nmodels, for use of antihypertensive medications (yes, no). Continu-\nous covariables were included as linear terms in the models. Because\nadjusting for hypertension treatment may result in biased estimates\nof the association between selenium and continuous blood pressure\noutcomes, we conducted an additional analysis using censored linear\nregression (Model 4) to correct for antihypertensive treatment using\nNHANES survey weights.24 Tests for linear trend were calculated by\nincluding serum selenium as a continuous variable in the models. To\nfurther explore the shape of the relationship between serum selenium\nand blood pressure measurements and hypertension, we used re-\npercentiles of the serum selenium distribution in models adjusted as\npreviously described for Model 3. We also evaluated the interactions\nbetween selenium (modeled as quadratic restricted splines) and sex,\nage, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, smoking status, or\nuse of vitamin/mineral supplements by fitting separate models for\nevery interaction, including all the adjustment variables described for\nModel 3 but each with interaction terms for the selenium splines and\nthe variable of interest. Statistical analyses were performed using the\nfor the complex sampling design and weights in NHANES 2003 to\n2004. Censored regression models were estimated using the cnreg\ncommand in Stata28 (version 9.2) weighted for NHANES survey\nweights.\nTable 3.

Similarly, results from Model 3 did not\nsubstantially change after additional adjustment for dietary\nvariables from the 24-hour dietary recalls (total caloric intake,\npolyunsaturated to saturated fat intake ratio, sodium, calcium,\nmagnesium, fiber, -carotene, vitamin E, vitamin C, and\nalcohol intake), after separate additional adjustment for serum\nlevels of -carotene, vitamin E, and vitamin C, or after\nseparate additional adjustment for the presence of diabetes\nand the presence of hypercholesterolemia. Adjustment for the\nNHANES pseudoprimary sampling units had negligible ef-\nfects on the results (not shown).\nDiscussion\nIn this representative cross-sectional study of the US popu-\nlation, high serum selenium concentrations were associated\nwith higher blood pressure levels and with higher prevalence\nof hypertension. Compared to the lowest quintile, participants\nin the highest selenium quintile had increased systolic,\nrespectively (6.3, 2.8, and 4.6 mm Hg after correcting for use\nof medication for hypertension in censored regression mod-\nels, respectively). These differences are epidemiologically\nand clinically important,29,30 and they add to the concerns\nraised by the observation of elevated lipid levels14 and\nincreased risk of diabetes15,17 with high selenium concentra-\ntions in studies conducted in the United States, a country with\nhigh selenium intake.\nFew observational studies have evaluated the association\nof selenium with blood pressure levels. A study in elderly\nFinnish men6 from areas with very low mean serum selenium\nfound no relationship between selenium and blood pressure.\nConversely, the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor\nStudy,5 a Finnish cohort of middle-aged men, found an\ninverse association between serum selenium and systolic\nblood pressure. The Flemish Study on Environment Genes\nand Health Outcomes (FLEMENGHO)3 also found an in-\nverse cross-sectional association between blood selenium\nconcentrations and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in\nmen, but this association was largely attributable to markedly\nhigher blood pressure levels in the lowest selenium quintile\n(78 g/L) with little variation across the remaining quin-\ntiles. Baseline blood selenium concentrations were also in-\nversely associated with the risk of hypertension after 5.2\nyears of follow-up in men. No association was observed\nTable 4.

Plasma\nselenium concentrations were not correlated with systolic\nblood pressure in either men or women.8 Finally, serum\nselenium concentrations were not associated with blood\npressure levels in the Olivetti Heart Study.7 All these studies\nwere conducted in European countries and had mean sele-\nnium concentrations below 100 g/L.\nCompared with previous observational studies, our study\nwas conducted in the United States, a country with high mean\nserum selenium concentrations (137 g/L). The increased\nblood pressure levels and prevalence of hypertension at high\nprevious studies reporting a positive association of selenium\nconcentration with adverse lipid profile and diabetes risk.14\u00ad17\nIndeed, it is possible that high risk factor levels at high\nselenium concentrations may explain the U-shaped relation-\nship between selenium concentration and cardiovascular end\npoints observed in several US studies.12,31,32 Given the high\nselenium intake in the US population and the popularity of\nselenium supplements, it is important to elucidate the mech-\nanisms underlying the association of high selenium exposure\nand cardiovascular risk factors in selenium-replete\npopulations.\nUnfortunately, no data are available on the effect of\nselenium supplementation on blood pressure end points in\nrandomized controlled trials using single selenium supple-\nments. In the HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS)\ntrial, selenium (100 g/d) was administered along with\n(25 mg/d), with no effect on blood pressure levels.31 In China\n(Linxian), antioxidant supplementation (selenium 50 g/d,\n-carotene 15 mg/d, and vitamin E 60 mg/d) in a nutritionally\ndeficient population was linked only to increased isolated\ndiastolic hypertension, but other blood pressure end points\nwere not significantly different.34\nThe concerns with potential metabolic side effects of\nelevated selenium levels add to the lack of efficacy of\nMale\nFemale\nNon-hispanic white\nNon-hispanic black\nMexican american\nOthers\nNo\nYes\nNormal\nOverweight\nObese\nNon-smoker\nEx-smoker\nSmoker\nNo\nYes\nGender\nAge group\nRace\nEducation High School\nBody Mass Index group\nSmoking\nNutritional supplements\nHypertension Odds Ratio (90th vs 10th percentile)\nFigure 3.

Multivariable logistic regression models were adjusted for sex, age (continuous), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-\nHispanic black, Mexican-American, or other), education (high school or higher versus less than high school), body mass index (continu-\nous), smoking (never, former, current), cotinine (continuous), menopausal status (yes, no), and use of vitamin/mineral supplements (yes,\nno). Separate models for every interaction were fitted, each one including interaction terms for the selenium splines and the variable of\ninterest.

SELECT was prematurely stopped by the\nData and Safety Monitoring Committee for lack of benefit on\nthe prostate cancer prevention and for safety concerns.35\nThe strengths of our study come from the rigorous sam-\npling design, the strict adherence to study protocols in\nmeasurements and laboratory assays, and the representa-\ntiveness of the NHANES sample. Several limitations, how-\never, need to be considered in the interpretation of these\nfindings. The cross-sectional design limits our ability to\ndetermine the direction and the causality of the observed\nassociation. It is possible that pathophysiological changes of\nhypertension modify serum selenium concentration or that\nparticipants with hypertension change their health behaviors,\nincluding selenium intake through diet and dietary supple-\nments. Although the observed association persisted among\nparticipants who did not use multivitamin/mineral supple-\nments and after adjusting for several intake variables, our\nfindings must be confirmed in prospective studies with\nincident cases of hypertension. Also, dietary information in\nNHANES was based on 24-hour recalls, which may not be\nsufficiently reliable to estimate the nutrient intakes of indi-\nviduals resulting in potential residual confounding. Another\nlimitation is the use of a single measurement of serum\nselenium, which may be subject to relatively high within\nperson variability and may bias our findings toward the null.36\nIn addition, because only total serum Se was measured in\nNHANES, we do not have information of selenoprotein\nlevels or activity or about nonspecific incorporation of\nselenium as selenomethionine in other plasma proteins. More\ndetailed analysis of different selenoproteins and related ac-\ntivities will be needed to better understand the association of\nselenium with hypertension.\nOur findings apply to high-selenium intake countries such\nas the United States, and may not be generalized to other\npopulations with marginal selenium intake. Furthermore,\nthere is not yet a clear mechanism that could explain the\neffects of high selenium concentrations on cardiovascular risk\nfactors. Although substantial attention has been paid to\nexplain the mechanisms for a potential benefit of increasing\nserum selenium in low-selenium intake populations, the\nmechanistic explanation for the effects of selenium above the\nlevels required to maximize glutathione peroxidase activity\nare unknown.\nIn summary, high serum selenium concentrations were\nassociated with higher prevalence of hypertension in a rep-\nresentative sample of US adults. The differences between the\nextreme quintiles, more than 4 mm Hg for systolic blood\npressure, may be associated with a substantial number of\ncardiovascular events and with complications in blood pres-\nsure control. Recently, high selenium concentrations have\nbeen linked to increased prevalence of hyperlipidemia and\ndiabetes14 and to a U-shaped relationship with cardiovascular\nevents.31 From a clinical perspective, selenium supplements\ncannot currently be recommended for cardiovascular protec-\ntion. Furthermore, for individuals living in regions with high\nselenium intake, selenium supplementation could potentially\nincrease risk of hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterol-\nemia. Our findings call for a thorough evaluation of the risks\nand benefits associated high selenium status in the United\nStates.\nSources of Funding\nfrom the American Heart Association.\nDisclosures\nNone.\nReferences\n1.
