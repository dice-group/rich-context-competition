    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nNSC (neural stem cells)/NPC (neural progenitor cells) are mul-\ntipotent and self-renew throughout adulthood in the SVZ\n(subventricular zone) of the mammalian CNS (central ner-\nvous system). These cells are considered interesting targets\nfor CNS neurodegenerative disorder cell therapies, and un-\nderstanding their behaviour in vitro is crucial if they are to\nbe cultured prior to transplantation. We cultured the SVZ\ntissue belonging to newborn rats under the form of NS (neu-\nrospheres) to evaluate the effects of Tf (transferrin) on cell\nproliferation. The NS were heterogeneous in terms of the\nNSC/NPC markers GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), Nestin\nand Sox2 and the OL (oligodendrocyte) progenitor mark-\ners NG2 (nerve/glia antigen 2) and PDGFR (platelet-derived\ngrowth factor receptor ). The results of this study indicate\nthat aTf (apoTransferrin) is able to increase cell proliferation\nof SVZ-derived cells in vitro, and that these effects were\nmediated at least in part by the TfRc1 (Tf receptor 1). Since\nOPCs (oligodendrocyte progenitor cells) represent a signifi-\ncant proportion of the proliferating cells in the SVZ-derived\nprimary cultures, we used the immature OL cell line N20.1 to\nshow that Tf was able to augment the proliferation rate of\nOPC, either by adding aTf to the culture medium or by over-\nexpressing rat Tf in situ. The culture medium supplemented\nwith ferric iron, together with aTf, increased the DNA con-\ntent, while ferrous iron did not. The present work provides\ndata that could have a potential application in human cell\nreplacement therapies for neurodegenerative disease and/or\nCNS injury that require the use of in vitro amplified NPCs.\nr r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r r\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed (email jpasquin@qb.ffyb.uba.ar).\nAbbreviations: aTf, apoTransferrin; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; CNS, central nervous system; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; DMEM, Dulbecco's\nmodified Eagle's medium; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FCS, fetal calf serum; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; ICC, immunocytochemistry; NG2, nerve/glia antigen 2; NPC,\nneural progenitor cell; NS, neurosphere; NSC, neural stem cell; OL, oligodendrocyte; OPC, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; OS, oligosphere; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth\nfactor receptor ; pExpTf, pExpressTf; PFA, paraformaldehyde; PO, polyornithine; RT\u00adPCR, reverse transcription\u00adPCR; SVZ, subventricular zone; Tf, transferrin; TfRc, Tf\nreceptor; Tf-TR, Texas Red-labelled Tf; WB, Western blotting.\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY)\n(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\n",

Their most relevant prop-\nerties reside in their unique ability to commit and mature into\nany of the different CNS neural cell lineages, including neu-\nrons and macroglia (Gould, 2007). One of the largest niches\nin the CNS harbouring these cells is the SVZ (subventricu-\nlar zone), although other regions within the brain contain\nNPCs as well, such as the spinal cord subependymal zone,\nthe hippocampus dentate gyrus subgranular zone and the\npreviously described sub-cortical zone (Merkle and Alvarez-\nThe SVZ niche has been extensively studied in the past\nfew years and evidence shows that the cells residing in it\nrespond to injury (Picard-Ri\u00b4\ntively engage in brain repair make them promising targets for\nthe design of neurodegenerative disease therapies (Lois and\nL. Silvestroff and others\nParticularly, cells expressing the NG2 (nerve/glia antigen 2)\nchondroitin sulfate proteoglycan are in part derived from\nthe SVZ and are potential candidates that have been shown\nto function as precursors for OL (oligodendrocyte) regenera-\ntion in demyelinating diseases (Tripathi et al., 2010; Richard-\nson et al., 2011). Progenitor proliferation and differentiation\nare required during oligodendrogenesis and both processes\nseem to depend on an adequate iron supply (Schonberg and\nMammalian iron metabolism is tightly regulated (Wang\nand Pantopoulos, 2011) and involves, among many key regu-\nlators, Tf (transferrin) and TfRc1 (Tf receptor) 1 and TfRc2\nbrain, TfRc1 is mainly detected in neurons and endothelial\ncells. It is also expressed in oligodendroglial precursors and\nis down-regulated in mature OL (Leitner and Connor, 2012).\nTfRc2 has also been detected in the brain (Kawabata et al.,\n1999). On the other hand, Tf is mainly synthesized in the\nliver and secreted into the blood stream from where it is able\nto transcytose across the blood\u00adbrain barrier into the CNS\n(Broadwell et al., 1996); however, the amount that effec-\ntively reaches the brain parenchyma is insufficient to satisfy\nthe brain's iron metabolic demands. Therefore, most of the\nTf found in the CNS is endogenously synthesized by OL and\nchoroid plexus cells, and is required for iron mobilization\nwithin the brain parenchyma and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid)\nPrevious reports regarding Tf effects on the CNS demon-\nstrate this glycoprotein is able to increase myelin content\nduring the rat's early postnatal development (Escobar Cabr-\nOL pro-maturating factor. Nonetheless, recent data support\nthe trophic effects of Tf on rat SVZ cells in vivo, where an aTf\n(apoTransferrin) intracranial injection into the ventricles of\nrats after hypoxia/ischaemia increases the expression of the\nPCNA (proliferation cell nuclear antigen; Guardia Clausi et al.,\n2010). Although these in vivo findings clearly show that Tf is\nable to modulate both cell proliferation and differentiation,\nthey also suggest that Tf effects are mainly dependent on the\nidentity of the cells it targets.\nThe NS (neurospheres) culture assay has been widely used\nas an in vitro model to study the progression of undiffer-\nentiated cells to OL. We have recently examined the effects\nof aTf treatment on young rat SVZ-derived NS and found\nthat during oligodendrogenesis aTf was able to control cell\nproliferation, lineage commitment or cell differentiation de-\npending on the time point at which the treatments were car-\nried out (Silvestroff et al., 2012). Therefore, in this report, we\nevaluated if the early event associated with the activation\nof NPC proliferation was conserved in neonatal SVZ tissue\ncultures and further investigated the molecular mechanisms\nby which Tf is able to stimulate cell proliferation.\nWe determined that the increase in NS proliferation\nrate was associated with the increment in NS size, and this\neffect was mediated by the incorporation of Tf into cells\nthrough TfR1. Since OPC (oligodendrocyte progenitor cell)\nrepresented the highest proportion of proliferating cells in\nthe NS, we used the OL cell line N20.1 and confirmed Tf had\nsimilar effects in this culture system. We conclude OPC is\nresponsible for the increase in NS size after Tf treatment.\nFurthermore, Tf could be used to augment OPC numbers for\nfuture cell replacement therapies, where NPC require in vitro\nexpansion in a serum-free culture medium.\nAnimals\nAll animal procedures used in this study were performed\nfollowing the guidelines established by Buenos Aires Uni-\nversity School of Pharmacy and Biochemistry. Albino Wistar\nrats (Rattus norvegicus) were housed under 12 h light/12 h\ndark cycles. They were fed rodent pellet chow and water ad\nlibitum.\nThe culture medium\nDMEM/F12 (Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/nutrient mix-\nture F-12; Gibco\u00ae) culture media was prepared with slight\nmodifications. We added 1.2 g of sodium bicarbonate (Cal-\nbiochem) and 4 g of anhydrous glucose (Sigma\u00adAldrich\u00ae)\nper litre. Sodium penicillin G and streptomycin sulfate were\nadded to a final concentration of 20 units/ml and 20 g/ml\nrespectively, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4. For SVZ-derived\nNS cultures, B27 supplement (Gibco\u00ae) was added to the\nmedium at a final concentration of 2% (DMEM/F12-B27).\nThe B27 supplement used to prepare the culture medium con-\ntains unknown-to-the-buyer Tf concentrations (Brewer et al.,\n1993). The proliferation medium was prepared by supple-\nmenting the DMEM/F12-B27 media with the mitogens bFGF\n(basic fibroblast growth factor; 20 ng/ml) and EGF (epider-\nmal growth factor, 20 ng/ml) (Peprotech\u00ae). For N20.1 cells,\nwe used DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2% FCS (fetal calf\nserum).\nSVZ-derived free-floating NS cultures\nTwo- to four-day-old male and female rats were killed\nand brains were removed. For SVZ-derived NS cultures, the\nperiventricular tissue was removed from the brains and me-\nchanically dissociated to a single cell suspension with a\n1 ml automatic pipette. Cells were expanded in proliferat-\ning medium in a humidified incubator at 36C and 5% CO2\n.\nGrowth factors (bFGF and EGF) were added to the medium\nevery 2 days. Proliferating cells grew into free-floating aggre-\ngates known as NS, which began appearing as from the third\nday in vitro. NS were allowed to expand for 6 days before\n44 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nTf promotes proliferation of SVZ cells\ndissociation. To dissociate whole NS into a single cell suspen-\nsion, NS were allowed to settle for 10 min at room tempera-\nture (20C), and were then mechanically dissociated to a sin-\ngle cell suspension by pipetting them up and down 15 times\nwith a 1 ml automatic pipette. Finally, the cell suspension was\nresuspended in fresh proliferating medium. Alternatively, NS\nwere dissociated using the Neurocult\u00ae Chemical Dissociation\nKit protocol (Stem Cell Technologies). The cell suspensions\nwere either used to regenerate a new passage of NS, or\nwere directly sewed on to an adherent surface: a Petri dish\nor a glass coverslip. For whole NS analysis, NS were plated\non PO (polyornithine)-coated coverslips for at least 4 h and\nthen fixed. For individual cell analyses, dissociated NS were\nplated over night in a 100 l volume of culture medium on\nPO-coated coverslips within a 24-well plate. Once individual\ncells were attached, the wells were completed with 400 l of\nfresh proliferating medium. For the culture treatments with\naTf, the NS-derived cells were incubated for 6 days in the\npresence of mitogens.\nThe N20.1 oligodendroglial cell line used to evaluate Tf ef-\nfects on cell proliferation was a gift from Dr Campagnoni's\nlaboratory. The cell line generation has been described by\ngenerated from mouse OL cultures, and were immortalized\nby infecting them with a viral vector that expresses the\nsimian virus large T antigen. The simian virus large T anti-\ngen is capable of maintaining an immortalized phenotype\nat a proliferation-permissive temperature (34C). At higher\ntemperatures (39C), the thermo-labile antigen is degraded,\nforcing the N20.1 cells to exit the cell cycle and initiate their\nmaturation process. We used a constant cell culture tem-\nperature of 36C at all times, as a compromise temperature\nbetween the 37C needed for the SVZ-primary NS cultures\nand the proliferation-permissive temperature needed for this\nimmortalized cell line. Under these conditions, these cells\ncontinue to enter the cell cycle and remain as immature OL\nprogenitors. The N20.1 cells were grown attached to plas-\ntic flasks in 2% FCS-supplemented DMEM/F12 medium. The\ncell line was also cultured as free floating spheres in non-\nadhesive plastic Petri dishes. The N20.1 spheres were called\nOS (oligospheres), to differentiate them from SVZ-derived\naTf treatments\nA human aTf (Sigma\u00adAldrich\u00ae) sterile 50\u00d7stock solution\n(5 mg/ml) was used to treat the SVZ-derived primary cul-\ntures and the N20.1 cell line at a final concentration of\n100 g/ml. The culture medium was replaced every 2 days\nduring treatment. All the aTf treatments were performed in\nparallel with control cultures (CTL) lacking aTf supplemen-\ntation. For the SVZ-derived primary cultures, attached cells\nwere treated with aTf for 6 days, while N20.1 cells were ex-\nposed to aTf for 2 or 6 days according to the assay performed.\nFor Tf uptake studies, attached cells were exposed to Tf-TR\n(Texas Red-labelled Tf; InvitrogenTM) at a 100 g/ml final\nconcentration for 24 h prior to fixation. For the treatment\nof free-floating NS with the Tf receptor blocking antibody\n(clone 42/6), the antibody concentration was set at 5 g/ml\nin the culture medium according to data published by Trow-\nTf overexpression in the N20.1 cell line\nCells were plated overnight before the transfection. The\ncells were transfected with circular pExpTf (pExpressTf; Open\nBiosystems) to overexpress the secretable form of Tf by us-\ning LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) for 4 h. The pExpTf\nvector carries a rat Tf cDNA obtained from rat testis mRNA\ntransfected with a circular pExpress vector lacking Tf cDNA\n(pExp). For BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine) incorporation assays,\ncells were transfected with either vector (pExp or pExpTf) and\ncultured for 2 days after the transfection protocol. For DNA\nquantitative analysis, the cells were cultured for 6 days af-\nter the transfection protocol. In this last case, the cells were\ntransfected with linear plasmid vectors. We used a pExpTf\nvector digested within the Tf coding sequence as a negative\ncontrol. Both linear vectors were treated with calf intestine\nALP (alkaline phosphatase) to avoid any re-ligation. Cells were\nanalysed 6 days post transfection to decrease the probability\nof plasmid loss.\nCulture medium supplementation with ferric\ncitrate or ferrous sulfate\nFor studies of iron supplementation in the culture medium of\nthe N20.1 cell line, we calculated the basal ferric and ferrous\nand 1.5 M respectively. The 2% FCS was analysed for iron\ncontent and showed to be 0.35 M. For an aTf concentra-\ntion of 100 g/ml in the culture treatments, we estimated it\nequalled 1.25 M if we considered Tf had a molecular mass of\n80 kDa. Since aTf has two binding sites for iron, we explored\nthe effects of ferric citrate and ferrous sulfate at 2.5 M, a\nconcentration that equalled the amount of binding sites on\nfor each iron source was added to the experimental design\nas a low dose condition.\nFluorescent DNA quantitative analysis\nDNA was quantified following the technique described by\n6 days, either with aTf in the culture medium or by overex-\npressing Tf, the wells were rinsed twice with pre-warmed PBS\nand incubated in TNE (10 mM Tris base, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2 M\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) 45\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nL.

The two cell markers simultaneously analysed on a\ngiven cell preparation were identified using green or red\nfluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies. The images\nacquired with the different microscope filters for a given\nfield were merged to obtain a single three coloured im-\nage, where blue always corresponded to the total cell nu-\nclei that incorporated the Hoechst dye.

Then, the BrdU+ nuclei were counted and la-\nbelled on this second image. We avoided counting BrdU+\nnuclei that already had a digital label (brought on from the\nprevious image). The labels of the second image were added\nto the labels of the previous image and altogether merged on\nthe third image. The procedure was repeated for each addi-\ntional image of a given NS to prevent the counting of BrdU+\nnuclei more than once. The resulting number of BrdU+ la-\nbelled cells was finally normalized to the NS size. The NS size\n(volume) was calculated from the NS radius (Supplementary\nFigure S4A). At least 80 NS were counted from each condition\nfrom two independent experiments.\nTf-TR intraventricular injections\n) were anaesthetized by hypothermia and sub-\njected to an intraventricular injection of 1 l of sterile Tf-TR\n(100 g/ml). A 1 cm-long longitudinal and superficial inci-\nsion was performed with a scalpel over the cranium skin. A 30\ngauge needle was used to gently prick the cranium bones at\n1 mm (posterior) and 1 mm (lateral) from the Bregma to ease\nthe access of the injection pipette needle. The rats were then\ninjected with the Tf-TR solution by inserting the injection\nneedle 4 mm deep into the CNS lateral ventricle.\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe brains of the P2\u00ad4\nrat pups were removed and rinsed in\nPBS, and then fixed in a 4% (w/v) PFA overnight at 4C.\nWhole brains were sequentially soaked for 24 h in 15% and\n30% sucrose solutions. Finally, the brains were frozen at\n- 80C. To obtain 30 m-thick coronal sections, the brains\nwere processed using a Leica CM 1850 cryostat. The brain\nsections were collected in a 50% glycerol solution and kept\nat - 20C. For the histochemistry procedure, brain slices\nwere rinsed thrice in PBS, mounted on to gelatin-treated\nglass slides and air dried. The sections were blocked in 5%\nFCS\u00adPBS solution for 2 h and then sequentially exposed to the\nprimary and secondary antibodies, as described for the ICC\nprocedure. Finally, the sections were mounted with Mowiol\nmounting solution.\nSDS/PAGE and Western blotting\nFor cultured-cell protein analysis, adherent cells were washed\ntwice with pre-warmed 0.1 M PBS at 37C, scrapped off\nthe Petri dishes and lysed in TOTEX buffer [20 nM Hepes,\n,\nstatine, 0.5 nM DTT (dithiothreitol) and 0.5 nM PMSF] on ice\nand kept at - 20C until processed. Whenever culture me-\ndia were replaced on adherent cultures, samples of the old\nculture media were retrieved for protein analysis. These cul-\nto remove any cell debris, and supernatants were recovered\nfor storage at - 20C. For 35-day-old rat brain tissue sam-\nples, animals were anaesthetized and perfused with PBS to\nremove blood from vasculature before sample collection. The\nrat brains were then homogenized in a volume of PBS equal\nto the brain weight. The CSF samples were obtained from\nnon-perfused rats and were centrifuged. CSF sample con-\ntaining a red blood cell pellet were discarded due to serum-Tf\ncontamination.\nThe proteins belonging to the different samples were\nquantified by the Bradford assay and electrophoresed in de-\nnaturing SDS polyacrylamide 12% gels. Proteins were then\ntransferred on to a methanol-activated ImmobylonTM PVDF\nmembrane and blocked in a 5% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed\nmilk powder, PBS solution for 2 h at room temperature.\nMembranes were then incubated with primary antibodies\novernight at 4C (Table 1). After rinsing in a 0.1% Tween\n20, PBS solution, membranes were incubated for 2 h at room\ntemperature with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated\nsecondary antibodies, and then rinsed in a 0.1% Tween 20,\nPBS solution. Primary and secondary antibodies were di-\nluted in a 1% FCS, 0.1% Tween 20, PBS solution. Protein\nimmunodetection was performed with a 0.1% 3,3 -DAB (di-\n, 0.1 M sodium acetate buffered\nsolution (pH 5), with freshly added H2\n(1 l/ml). After\ncolour development, membranes were rinsed in PBS, air dried\nand scanned. Immunolabelled bands on membranes were\nquantified with ScionImage software.

Nonetheless, we analysed the\nDMEM/F12-B27 culture medium by WB (Western blotting)\nand observed a low Tf detection. Since the anti-Tf antibody\nused for the WB was raised against rat Tf, it could have\nhad a low affinity for the B27 Tf, if the latter belonged\nto another species different from rat. We performed an\nSDS/PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining analysis of the culture\nmedia proteins and confirmed that the B27-supplement pro-\nvided negligible amounts of Tf to the culture medium com-\npared with the aTf-supplemented condition (aTf 100 g/ml)\nwe wanted to test (Supplementary Figures S1A and S1B at\nThe SVZ-derived NS culture system\nIn the absence of growth factors in the culture media, NS\nwere still able to develop although they reached smaller\nsizes after 6 days in culture compared with the bFGF/EGF-\nsupplemented condition (Supplementary Figures S2A\u00adS2D at\nresults indicate that cells in this system are still capable of\nproliferating in vitro in the absence of exogenously added\ngrowth factors, suggesting the possibility of growth factor(s)\nbeing endogenously synthesized in these cultures. Nonethe-\nless, NS formation was performed from here on in the pres-\nence of the growth factors EGF and bFGF to enhance cell\namplification in vitro. We termed this a proliferating culture\ncondition, since it was more permissive to cell division than\nthe condition lacking exogenously added growth factors.\nThe basal proliferation rate of SVZ-derived cells in vitro\nwas analysed after mechanical cell dissociation and seeding\non PO-coated coverslips. As BrdU exposure time increased,\nthe proportion of BrdU+ nuclei increased as well (Supple-\nmentary Figure S2E). However, due to cell heterogeneity in\nthis kind of culture, the cell cycle time of the culture as a\nwhole is not a representative measure of the cell cycle of\neach different cell type derived from the SVZ. Nonetheless,\nfor dissociated NS cultures, the BrdU pulse was then set at\nTf and TfRc expression in the CNS and cell\ncultures\nWe were interested in comparing the Tf content in the CSF,\nsince this fluid bathes the enterity of the lateral ventricle\n48 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nTf promotes proliferation of SVZ cells\nFigure 1 Tf and TfRc expression analysis in the CNS and in cell cultures\n(A) The Tf protein content was quantified in serum, whole brain homogenates and the CSF of at least two 35-day-old rats (P35\n)\nand at least two 4-day-old rats (P4\n) by WB, and compared with a culture medium sample supplemented with aTf (100 g/ml). The\nabsorbance of the WB bands was semi-quantified using a calibration curve containing different aTf concentrations, as indicated in\nSupplementary Figure S3. (B) RT\u00adPCRs were performed on RNA isolated from P35\nrats using primers for Tf, TfRc1, TfRc2 and\nGAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Testis, liver and choroid plexus were obtained from P35\nrats, while liver, choroid\nplexus and SVZ tissue samples belonged to P4\nrats. The NS samples were obtained from culturing the SVZ of P4\nsamples obtained from the immature OL cell line, N20.1.

Since\nCSF without plasma contamination was only obtainable from\nrats from a young adolescent age, we compared the Tf con-\ntent of the CSF belonging to P35\nrats with the whole brain\nand plasma of age-matched animals, and with the Tf con-\ntent in whole brain samples and serum belonging to newborn\n). The Tf protein expression was analysed and semi-\nquantified by WB, and its presence was confirmed in high\nrat serum (Figure 1A). Tf concentra-\ntions in whole brain homogenates (P35\n) and CSF sam-\n) were notoriously lower than that observed in serum\nsamples but nonetheless detectable. The aTf concentration\nused to supplement the NS culture medium (100 g/ml)\nwas similar to the Tf concentrations detected in the CSF\nand brain tissue. The WB membranes, which were used to\nbuild Figure 1(A), are shown in Supplementary Figure S3 (at\nTo confirm that Tf was synthesized in the rat CNS, the\nTf expression was analysed together with TfRc by RT\u00adPCR in\ntissues belonging to P35\nand neonatal P4\nrats (Figure 1B). The\nRNA belonging to P35\nrat testis, liver and choroid plexus were\nused as positive controls, since all these samples expressed\nTf and both TfRc 1 and 2. TfRc2 showed the presence of a\nmajor transcript, and a faint band corresponding to a larger\ntranscript. The liver, choroid plexus and the SVZ tissues be-\nlonging to P4\nrats showed Tf and TfRc1 expression, similar to\nthose detected in samples belonging to the P35\nrats. In the\ncase of TfRc2, a larger transcript was detected in neonatal\nliver, choroid plexus and SVZ samples together with the clas-\nsic isoforms, although at higher levels compared with the P35\nrats. Furthermore, the proportions of both TfRc2 isoforms\nwere different depending on the neonatal tissue analysed.\nThese results indicate that besides the detection of various\nTfRc2 isoforms, other than the already described  and \nisoforms, they were differentially regulated. The NS obtained\nfrom the SVZ of P4\nrats contained transcripts belonging to Tf\nand to both TfRc1 and TfRc2. The N20.1 cell line belonging\nto immortalized mouse OL progenitors contained transcripts\nbelonging to Tf and to both TfRc 1 and TfRc2, with a single\nPCR amplicon for each primer set.\nSox2 and Olig2 expression in vivo and in vitro\nrats was analysed in vivo, where we searched\nfor cells expressing the NPC transcription factor Sox2 and\nthe glial transcription factor Olig2. Although Sox2 expres-\nsion was expected to be restricted to the SVZ, Sox2+ nuclei\nwere identified in the CC (corpus callosum) and the CP (cau-\ndate putamen) as well (Figure 2A). Nonetheless, the greatest\nconcentration of Sox2-expressing cells was located in the\nSVZ, confirming that this structure was enriched in NPCs. The\nimmunodetection of Olig2+ cells in the same brain sections\ndemonstrated that Olig2 was expressed by a minority of nu-\nclei within the SVZ (Figures 2B\u00ad2D). Confocal images of the\nSVZ confirmed that Olig2 was expressed by some cells within\nthe SVZ, and that some co-expressed Sox2 (Figures 2E\u00ad2H,\narrow in Figure 2G). However, most of the Sox2+ cells in the\nSVZ were Olig2- .\nSimilar to the results obtained from histochemical anal-\nysis, the NS cells in the NS culture system expressed\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) 49\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nL.

A single acety-\nlated tubulin+ cilium was detected in vitro on the cells within\nwhole NS and in dissociated NS cultures (Figures 3A\u00ad3D, ar-\nrowheads in Figure 3B, arrows in Figure 3D).\nThe cell proliferation in whole NS was evaluated af-\nter a 4 h BrdU pulse. The NS cells incorporated BrdU and\nconfirmed that cells within the NS were able to prolifer-\nate in vitro. A large proportion of cells within the NS ex-\npressed the Sox2 transcription factor, indicating their undif-\nferentiated phenotype. Only a fraction of BrdU+ cells were\nSox2+ , demonstrating that NS contain proliferating cells\nother than NPC (Figures 3E\u00ad3H). The considerable amount\nof Sox2+ /BrdU- cells might be a consequence of the rela-\ntively short BrdU pulse. NS were dissociated to a single cell\nsuspension and exposed to a 24 h BrdU pulse to analyse the\nidentity of proliferating cells. NS-derived cultures contained\nGFAP+ (glial fibrillary acidic protein) cells (20%), although\nonly a small proportion of these cells were BrdU+ (Fig-\nures 3I\u00ad3L).

Interestingly, some NG2+ cells lacked\nOlig2 expression (Figures 4A\u00ad4C, arrowhead). No\nOlig2- /PDGFR+ cells were detected. The presence of\nlarge amounts of Olig2+ /NG2- and Olig2+ /PDGFR-\ncells, together with the high proportion of cells co-expressing\nOlig2 and Sox2, suggests that most Olig2+ cells might be\ncommitted to the oligodendroglial lineage and have not\nyet activated the expression of the NG2 or PDGFR genes.\nAlternatively, they might be committed to other neural lines,\nsuch as the astrocyte lineage, that do not express these\nsurface markers.\nBoth NG2+ and PDGFR+ cell populations grew in char-\nacteristic clusters, rather than spread out evenly among other\ncells. This might contribute to the knowledge that the SVZ-\nderived cultures contain distinct immature progenitors that\nare able to divide clonally, and give rise to groups of cells ex-\npressing the same cell surface markers as their progenitors.\nNotwithstanding, we decided to consider NG2+ /PDGFR+\ncells as cells committed to the oligodendroglial lineage.\nEffects of aTf on SVZ-derived cell proliferation\nFree floating NS were cultured in the absence or presence\nof human aTf (100 g/ml) in the culture media. The culture\nconditions were therefore termed CTL and aTf respectively.\nThe size of NS was studied as a function of time, and the\nresults indicated that NS were significantly larger in the aTf\ncondition compared with CTL condition as from the sixth\nday in culture (Figure 5A). To confirm that the NS size in-\ncrement observed in the aTf condition was a consequence\nof an increase in cell proliferation, the BrdU+ nuclei within\nthe whole NS (non-dissociated) were quantified and normal-\nized to the NS volume (Supplementary Figures S4A\u00adS4F at\ndata indicated that the cell proliferation rate was increased\nafter the aTf exposure in vitro (Figure 5B). Furthermore, the\nuse of a monoclonal antibody that blocked the TfRc1 in the\nculture media was able to significantly dampen the aTf ef-\nfects on the NS size, and demonstrated that the TfRc1 was\ninvolved in the effects of aTf on cell proliferation in the NS\ncultures (Figure 5C).\nTf was detected in dissociated NS cultures by ICC (Fig-\nures 5D and 5E). NS cultures grown in the CTL condition\ndid not show any appreciable Tf immunodetection. The aTf-\ntreated cultures showed an increase in Tf immunostaining\n(Figures 5E and 5F). Since aTf was shown to increase the cell\nproliferation rate in whole NS, we evaluated if there was a di-\nrect and proportional correlation between proliferation and\nTf incorporation. We suspected cells undergoing the S phase\nof the cell cycle, and that were therefore BrdU+ , would in-\ncorporate larger amounts of Tf compared with BrdU- cells.\nHowever, we were unable to notice significant changes in\nthe Tf incorporation patterns of BrdU+ or BrdU- cells (Fig-\nures 5G). Nonetheless, these higher magnification images\nof aTf-treated cultures that showed small immunopositive\npuncta, suggested Tf was being incorporated into the cells via\nthe canonical TfRc-mediated endocytic pathway (Figure 5G).\nThe Tf incorporation in aTf-treated cultures was analysed\nby confocal microscopy together with TfRc1 immunodetec-\ntion (Figures 5H\u00ad5J). Tf was detected in all cells, and co-\nlocalized with TfRc1. The differences found in Tf immunore-\nactivity between Figures 5(G) and 5(H) could be attributable\nto the HCl treatment used for the BrdU antigen retrieval that\ncould have partially damaged Tf epitopes. Although all cells\nexpressed the TfRc1, this receptor was not evenly distributed\nwithin the cells. Some cells expressed the TfRc1 restricted to\nthe soma, while others had TfRc1 expressed in both cell soma\nand its ramifications (Figures 5H\u00ad5J). Tf was also detected in\n52 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nTf promotes proliferation of SVZ cells\nFigure 5 Effects of aTf on the proliferation rate of SVZ-derived NS\n(A) Radius length quantification in free-floating NS in the absence (CTL) or presence of aTf (aTf) in the culture medium.

The scale bar in (D) represents\ncell ramifications where TfRc1 was not detected. This allowed\nus to speculate that the immunodetected Tf could have ei-\nther been synthesized in those same cells, could have been\nincorporated via the TfRc2 or could have been incorporated\nby TfRc1 in the cell soma and then transported along the\nTfRc1- cell processes.\nTf incorporation in SVZ-derived primary cultures\nWe decided to use Tf-TR to identify the Tf being incor-\nporated into the cells in culture, and simultaneously ab-\nrogate the detection of endogenously synthesized Tf. This\nmethod allowed us to confirm that not only was Tf be-\ning incorporated into the SVZ-derived cells in vitro but it\nwas also specifically interacting with the ubiquitously ex-\npressed TfRc1 (CD71) (Supplementary Figures S5A\u00adS5C at\nTf-TR fluorescence was identified with the same punctate\npattern as the immunodetected TfRc1. Tf-TR was also shown\nto be incorporated into BrdU+ cells (Supplementary Figures\nS5D\u00adS5F), as well as into Sox2+ and Olig2+ cells (Supple-\nmentary Figures S5G\u00adS5L). Since there were no apprecia-\nble differences in the quantities of Tf-TR incorporated into\nBrdU+ or BrdU- cells, we interpret that Tf-TR was inter-\nnalized into the cells regardless of their engagement in the\ncell cycle S phase. Both NG2 and PDGFR were able to incor-\nporate Tf-TR (Supplementary Figures S5M\u00adS5R). Some cells\nthat did not express any of the cell makers previously men-\ntioned incorporated great amounts of Tf-TR (Supplementary\nFigure S5L, arrow). These data confirmed that Tf uptake in\nSVZ-derived cells is detected with a punctate pattern, and\nthat it is a widespread phenomenon that is not restricted to\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) 53\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nL. Silvestroff and others\nproliferating cells. Furthermore, it suggests Tf binding to cells\nmust be following the canonical TfRc-mediated iron delivery\npathway.\nNG2 and PDGFR expression in NS and N20.1\ncell cultures\nSince the SVZ in vivo and the cultured SVZ-derived cells\ncontained Olig2+ cells, which are suggested to give rise to\nNG2+ /PDGFR+ OPC, we decided to evaluate if they could\nbe a possible target of aTf in vivo. We injected Tf-TR into the\nright lateral ventricle of P2\u00ad4\nrats and evaluated the red flu-\norescence in the cells surrounding the SVZ and neighbouring\nCC regions of the ipsilateral hemisphere. The rationale for\nthe use of 2\u00ad4-day-old rat pups for the injections was based\non the desire to evaluate the SVZ progenitors in vivo at the\nsame age as those used to isolate the SVZ for the NS cul-\ntures. Furthermore, at this postnatal age the proliferating\nprogenitors in the SVZ-niche and surrounding parenchyma\nare abundant and in a proliferative stage. Although there\nwas a generalized and faint fluorescence dispersed through-\nout the tissue sections, some structures and cells incorporated\nlarge amounts of Tf-TR that were observed as distinct red-\nfluorescent puncta. Besides finding that the vasculature and\nsome microglial cells incorporated large amounts of Tf-TR\n(data not shown), the NG2+ cells incorporated Tf-TR with\na characteristic punctate pattern consistent with the Tf-TR\nendocytosis previously described in the in vitro experiments\nThe analysis of BrdU+ nuclei revealed that almost 40% of\nall BrdU+ cells were positive for NG2, and to a lesser extent\nwere PDGFR+ (Figures 6D, 6E and 6J). When analysing the\nproliferation rate of NG2+ and PDGFR+ cell populations,\n50% and 60% of them were BrdU+ respectively. Besides\ndemonstrating that almost all NG2+ and PDGFR+ cells be-\nlonged to the Olig2+ cell population (Figure 4), we evaluated\nthe degree of co-localization of both these surface markers\non dissociated NS cultures (Figures 6F and 6K). The results\nshowed that the expression of these molecules overlapped\nin most of the immunopositive cells (Figure 6F, arrows), and\nwe considered these double-labelled cells were OPC. We did\nnotice that a small fraction of them expressed either one of\nthe two markers (Figure 6F, whole and empty arrowheads).\nOn the basis of these results, we questioned whether the\nNG2/PDGFR cell population could be responsible for the in-\ncreased proliferative response of NS-derived cells to the Tf\ntreatment. In order to test this hypothesis, we decided to\nuse N20.1 immortalized oligodendroglial cell line grown in\nculture conditions in which cells are maintained in prolifer-\nation as undifferentiated progenitors. The N20.1 cells were\nenriched as a whole in NG2+ and PDGFR+ cells when com-\npared with the NS primary cultures, and were considered an\nappropriate system to evaluate Tf effects on the OPC pop-\nulation (Figures 6F, 6I and 6K). Interestingly, when PDGFR\nwas only partially expressed in some cells, this expression\nwas concentrated in areas where cell membranes contacted\neach other (Figure 6I, arrowheads). We noticed that the po-\nlarized PDGFR expression took place when at least one of\nthe contact partner membranes expressed NG2, in agreement\nwith data suggesting PDGFR interacts with NG2 on surface\nmembranes of cells.\nThe proliferation capacity of both NG2+ and PDGFR+\ncells in the N20.1 cell line was evaluated as well, since ap-\nproximately half the NG2+ cells lacked PDGFR expression.\nBesides confirming their high proliferative rate, there were no\ndistinct differences among them according to this parameter\nEffects of aTf on N20.1 cell cultures\nWe added 2% FCS in the culture media so that the ad-\ndition of exogenous aTf (100 g/ml) would be appreciably\ndifferent from the untreated culture condition. The total\nproteins present in the DMEM/F12 culture media were anal-\nysed by SDS/PAGE at different percentages of FCS supple-\nmentation, and in the presence or absence of added aTf.\nThe optimal FCS supplementation percentage that allowed\nus to identify a significant increase in Tf content in the cul-\nture medium proteins compared with the control condition\nwas 2% (Supplementary Figures S6A and S6B, available at\nmade sure the N20.1 cells in the 2% FCS-supplemented cul-\nture medium were proliferating.\nTo analyse the effects of aTf on the OL cell line in a similar\nassay as the one used with the SVZ primary cultures, we devel-\noped a method to grow N20.1 cells as free-floating spheres.\nIn this case, since the cells used to form the spheres belonged\nto an OL-enriched culture, we decided to term the spher-\nical structures formed from N20.1 cells as OS (Figure 7A).\nA 4 h BrdU pulse allowed us to observe a large number of\nproliferating cells within the OS (Figure 7B). We detected\na significant increase in the mean size of the OS when aTf\nwas added to the culture medium compared with the CTL\ncondition (Figure 7C).\nDue to the amount of proliferating cells within whole OS,\ntheir quantification in this three-dimensional structure was\ncumbersome. Therefore the proliferation rate of the N20.1\ncell line was analysed by BrdU incorporation in dissociated\nmonolayer cultures. We first evaluated the increase in the\nnumber of BrdU+ cells after exposing the cells to differ-\nent BrdU time pulses (Figure 7D). We decided to use a 4 h\nBrdU pulse and confirmed by ICC that the proliferation of\nthe N20.1 cell line was increased when exposed to aTf for\n48 h in the culture medium compared with the CTL condition\n(Figure 7E). A fluorometric assay was used to quantify DNA.\nThis method was considered an indirect approach to mea-\nsuring the cumulative effects of an increased proliferation\nrate, and could serve to complement the BrdU incorporation\nexperiments. The results showed that not only did the 6-day\naTf-treatment increase the DNA amounts but also indicated\nthat this response to aTf was dose dependent (Figure 7F).\n54 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nTf promotes proliferation of SVZ cells\nFigure 6 NG2 and PDGFR expression in the SVZ and in different culture systems\n(A\u00adC) Confocal images of an NG2 (green) cell that incorporates Tf-TR (red) in the CC of a neonatal rat brain section after a 4 h Tf-TR\ninjection.

The immunodetection of activated\ncaspase III+ cells was used to quantify the number of apop-\ntotic cells in either CTL or in aTf-treated cultures. There was\nno difference in the amount of Caspase III+ cells among the\ndifferent treatments, which allowed us to confirm that aTf\nincreased the cell proliferation rather than protected cells\nfrom cell death by apoptosis (Figure 7G).\nTf incorporation in the N20.1 cell line\nSimilar to the rat NS primary cultures, we decided to make\nsure that the added aTf in the culture medium was internal-\nized into the cells by using the ICC technique. Simultaneously,\nwe evaluated the Tf-TR fluorescent pattern in the same cul-\ntures to discriminate the FCS-derived, or the endogenously\nsynthesized Tf, from the human aTf we added to the culture\nmedia. When no aTf was added to the culture medium (CTL),\nthere was a faint red fluorescence background and signifi-\ncant punctate immunodetection for Tf (Figures 8A and 8B).\nThe data in Figure 8(A) indicate that the Tf detected could\nbelong to that synthesized by the N20.1 cells or to the Tf of\nbovine origin contained in the FCS. As expected, when aTf\nwas added to the culture medium (aTf condition), although\nthere still was no significant red fluorescence detection, there\nwas a noticeable increase in the amount and intensity of\nTf+ immunoreactive puncta (Figures 8C and 8D). This result\nis in agreement with the SDS/PAGE analysis of the culture\nmedium proteins belonging to CTL and aTf-supplemented\nculture medium (Supplementary Figure S6), where the overall\nTf content is appreciably increased in the aTf supplemented\ncondition compared with the control condition.\nWhen Tf-TR was added to the culture medium, the TR flu-\norescence was detected at significantly higher levels than in\nthe previous conditions (Figure 8F compared with Figures 8B\nor 8D). Furthermore, the red fluorescence had a punctate\npattern that coincided with that of the immunodetected Tf\n(Figures 8E\u00ad8G). We performed a qualitative analysis to con-\nfirm that Tf-TR was co-localized in the same puncta as the\nimmunodetected Tf by plotting the intensity of the green flu-\norescent pixels of two-dimensional epi-fluorescence images\nagainst the intensity of the red fluorescent pixels (Figure 8G ).\nThe region of the plot where most pixels contained red and\ngreen fluorescence was selected and used to apply a mask\non the merged images of either experimental condition.

Therefore these data rein-\nforce the fact that the significant increase in the Tf immun-\nodetected in the aTf-treated cultures (Figure 8C compared\nwith Figure 8A) corresponds to the extracellular aTf that was\nadded to the culture medium.\nFurther image analysis revealed that some cells in the\nTf-TR treated cultures had a large round-shaped structure\nadjacent to the nuclei that seemed to deform or indent the\nnormal nuclei ovoid shape (Figure 8G, arrowheads). The use of\nconfocal imaging allowed us to confirm that the Tf+ puncta\nresembled the endosomal-mediated entry of Tf into the cells,\nand that the Tf puncta was located within the cell cytoplasm\n(Figure 8H).\nThe detection of Tf by ICC was hampered by the HCl\ntreatment used during the BrdU antigen retrieval protocol\n(Figures 8I and 8J) compared with cells that had not been\nexposed to the HCl treatment (Figures 8C and 8E). However,\nTf was still clearly detected in the aTf-treated cultures. The Tf\nincorporation pattern was not homogenous between treated\ncells, since some cells incorporated more Tf than others (Fig-\nure 8J). The BrdU incorporation did not strictly correlate with\nthe amount of Tf detected in the cells, since not all the\nBrdU+ nuclei incorporated large amounts of Tf, nor were all\nthe strong Tf-labelled cells positive for BrdU.\nEffects of Tf overexpression on N20.1 cell\nproliferation rates\nTo evaluate Tf effects on cell proliferation in an alternative\nsystem, we decided to overexpress rat Tf in the murine N20.1\ncell line. For BrdU analysis, the cells were transfected and\ncultured for 48 h until treatment termination. The Tf over-\nexpression was analysed by immunodetecting the Tf content\nin whole-cell homogenates and in culture medium super-\nnatants, and indicated that Tf was not only synthesized by\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) 57\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nL.

As time progressed after the transfection\nprotocol, Tf increased in the cultures overexpressing Tf (pEx-\npTf) compared with the control condition (CTL). The amount\nof Tf synthesized in the pExpTf cultures was semi-quantified\nby WB where known amounts of human aTf were used as\nstandards. The amount of Tf in the culture medium was sim-\nilar to the aTf concentration used to treat the cell cultures in\nthe previously described experiments. The quantitative anal-\nysis of strongly labelled Tf+ cells by ICC 48 h after transfec-\ntion revealed that the transfection efficiency with the pExpTf\nThe BrdU incorporation analysis showed that both Tf+ and\nTf- cells in Tf-overexpressing cultures (48 h after transfec-\ntion) incorporated BrdU in similar proportions. As a whole,\nTf-overexpressing cultures had a higher number of BrdU+\nnuclei compared with controls (Figure 9F). This suggested\nthat Tf was increasing the cell proliferation rate in Tf overex-\npressing cells, and paracrinally acting on the non-transfected\nneighbouring cells as well.\nWe further decided to evaluate if the overall cell density\nwould eventually increase over time in response to the in-\ncreased cell proliferation. We therefore decided to transfect\nthe N20.1 cells with linear versions of the CTL and the pExpTf\nvectors and culture the transfected cells for 6 days. After the\n6th day, the total DNA content of the cultures was quantified\nusing a fluorometric assay. The DNA fluorometric assay indi-\ncated that the cultures overexpressing Tf had increased DNA\namounts compared with the control cultures (Figure 9G).\nEffect of iron addition to CTL and aTf-treated\ncultures\nThe aTf treatment of NS and of the N20.1 cell cultures in-\ndicated that Tf was able to increase cell proliferation in a\ndose-dependent manner, and that at least TfRc1 was in-\nvolved in this process. However, little is known about the\nmechanisms involved. We considered that iron was a plau-\nsible candidate responsible for these effects.

We used a multi-\nfactorial designed experiment to analyse the influence of iron\non the DNA content of the cells in this culture system. The\ntwo-way ANOVA allowed us not only to analyse the indepen-\ndent effects of aTf or iron, but also analyse if the different\niron sources had differential effects on Tf function according\nto their concentration in the culture media.\nFerrous addition to cultures in the absence of aTf had a\nsignificant and negative effect on DNA amounts, and was\nconsidered the major source of variation (Figure 10A). The\naTf supplementation was considered a significant source of\nvariation as well, while there was no evidence to sustain\na possible interaction among the factors (ferrous iron and\naTf). The Bonferroni post-test indicated that the difference\nbetween the CTL and aTf treatment was only significant at\nthe lowest ferrous iron concentration (asterisk in Figure 10A).\nWe suppose the ferrous iron addition to the culture media\nmight be generating an oxidizing environment due to the\nfree radicals generated from Fenton's reaction that overrides\nthe effects of aTf when added at the 2.5 nM and 2.5 M\nconcentrations.\nIn the case of the ferric citrate treatment, both aTf and\nthe ferric iron were a significant source of variation (Fig-\nure 10B). Although the effect aTf had on the DNA content\nwas previously considered significant when adding ferrous\niron, or when analysed by a one-way ANOVA (Figure 7F), the\nmultifactorial design with a Bonferroni post-test indicated\nthat the difference between the CTL and aTf treatment was\nsignificant at the 2.5 nM ferric iron concentration (asterisks\nin Figure 10B). However, similar to the highest ferrous iron\ntreatment, high ferric citrate concentrations decreased the\nDNA content regardless of aTf supplementation.\nDISCUSSION\nWe decided to evaluate in further depth the effects of Tf on\nNS proliferation by using the SVZ tissue belonging to neona-\ntal rat pups. We first made sure the amount of aTf added to\nthe culture medium (100 g/ml) was significantly different\nfrom the endogenous Tf present in either DMEM/F12-B27 or\n2% FCS-DMEM/F12. We also determined that the aTf con-\ncentration used for in vitro treatments closely resembled the\nphysiological Tf levels found in the brain.\nWe detected Tf mRNA synthesis in SVZ tissue in vivo as\nwell as in NS cultures by RT\u00adPCR, suggesting an additional\nsource for Tf in the brain besides the previously reported\nbiosynthesis in OL and the choroid plexus (Bloch et al., 1985).\nFurthermore, mRNA belonging to TfRc 1 and 2 were detected\nas well. In the case of TfRc2, a higher molecular mass PCR\nproduct, other than the expected classic isoforms  and ,\nwas detected in all tissue samples of neonatal rats, while\na single PCR product was detected in mRNA samples ob-\ntained from in vitro cultures. Since the initial aim behind our\nexperiments was to study the effects of Tf on SVZ-derived\ncells in vitro, the detection of the TfRc in the cell cultures\nprovided compelling evidence that there was an underlying\nmechanism through which Tf could exert its effects. Falc~\nao\net al. (2012) have already demonstrated a close relationship\nbetween the secretion of choroid plexus soluble factors to\nthe CSF and their influence on SVZ cells, including Tf.\nThe large amounts of Sox2+ nuclei in the SVZ in vivo in-\ndicated the NPC identity of the cells in this niche. We found\nthat the expression of this transcription factor is also main-\ntained in vitro. The acetylated -tubulin immunodetection,\ntogether with GFAP and Nestin, provide further evidence\nthat cells contained within neonatal brain-derived NS are\nNPCs, expressing the same markers as adult SVZ type B NPCs\nCells expressing Olig2 were detected within the SVZ and in\nthe NS. Although immunopositive cells for Sox2 or Olig2 were\nnot quantified in vivo, there was a noticeable difference in the\noverlapping degree of both transcription factors between\nthe in vivo and the in vitro cell samples. The higher pro-\nportions of Olig2+ cells in the NS suggest a considerable\nbias of the SVZ-derived NPC towards glial lineages in vitro\ncompared with the default neuronal phenotype that pre-\ndominates in vivo. This is in agreement with data published\nby Brazel et al. (2005), who described phenotypically distinct\nmouse brain-derived NS able to generate different propor-\ntion of neurons and glia.\nThe addition of aTf to the culture medium, while NS were\nunder formation, demonstrated that the size of the NS in-\ncreased as a function of time compared with untreated cul-\ntures. The BrdU incorporation analysis, after normalizing the\nC 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) 59\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nL. Silvestroff and others\ndata to the NS size, proved that the increase in the sphere\nsize after aTf treatment was a direct consequence of an incre-\nment in cell proliferation. Besides the fact that Tf seems to be\nsufficient to increment NS proliferation, Erickson et al. (2008)\nprovide additional results supporting Tf as a necessary factor\nfor NS formation. The use of the anti-TfRc1 antibody with\nblocking activity in the NS culture medium demonstrated\nthat the aTf effects on cell proliferation in this culture sys-\ntem were mediated, at least in part, by TfRc1. This finding\nis in agreement with Chirasani et al. (2009) who described\na correlation in glioma cells between TfRc expression and\ntumour proliferation.\nAlthough we do not demonstrate TfRc1 is expressed at\nthe protein level in our cultures by WB, the RT\u00adPCR and ICC\nresults we show are supported by that of Cao et al. (2012)\nwho used the NPC line C17.2 and stable isotope-labelled\namino acids to quantify membrane proteins under differ-\nent experimental conditions. They observed that one of the\nvarious membrane proteins that significantly vary between\nundifferentiated and differentiated cell conditions is TfRc1,\nwhere the protein expression of this particular receptor is\nhighest in the cells in their undifferentiated state. Accord-\nwere obtained from whole brains of 18-day-old rat embryos,\nand that were cultured in the form of NS, showed TfRc1\nexpression.\nSince GFAP+ and Nestin+ cells were demonstrated to\nhave negligible proliferation rates in vitro, we decided to\nevaluate if there were other cell types in the SVZ-derived\ncultures with higher proliferation rates. Olig2+ nuclei were\nnumerous in this system and are capable of giving rise to\nglial restricted progenitors, among which are OPCs. Surpris-\ningly, besides finding Olig2+ nuclei co-expressing NG2 and\nPDGFR, many other Olig2+ nuclei did not express either cell\nsurface marker, which suggests that Olig2+ cells might have\ndifferentiated to the oligodendroglial lineage and silenced\nthe expression of NG2 and/or PDGFR. Alternatively, these\ncells might be considered progenitors that have not entirely\ncommitted to the oligodendroglial lineage and have not yet\nactivated the expression of NG2 and PDGFR. Dimou et al.\n(2008) have demonstrated that the Olig2+ cells in vivo at\nthis postnatal stage can give rise both to OL or astrocytes. The\nhigh degree of co-localization among NG2+ and PDGFR+\ncells is in agreement with data published by Rivers et al.\n(2008), although there were a small proportion of cells that\nonly expressed either of the two surface markers. These data\nallow for speculation regarding the chronological order of\nappearance of these two surface markers on OPCs. Further-\nmore, it highlights the heterogeneity of this particular cell\npopulation in terms of the degree of specification and com-\nmitment towards the oligodendroglial lineage. As a whole,\nimmunodetection of different markers demonstrate that the\nSVZ-derived NS assay is a highly heterogeneous system con-\ntaining different cell types, and contains cells at different\nstages along the differentiation pathway of a given neural\nlineage.\nThe in vivo analysis in the brain demonstrated that NG2+\ncells were one of the main cell types to incorporate Tf-TR, and\nmade them interesting putative targets to continue studying\nin vitro. The BrdU analysis in dissociated NS cultures rein-\nforced our interest in NG2+ and PDGFR+ cells since they\nrepresented a significant proportion of the proliferating cells.\nThe use of the N20.1 cell line was decided because of the need\nfor a cell culture system enriched in NG2 and/or PDGFR ex-\npressing cells. The immature OL cell line N20.1 was shown to\nrespond to the added aTf in the culture medium by increas-\ning the proliferation rate. Moreover, the BrdU incorporation\nrate was proven to respond to aTf in a dose-dependent man-\nner. We further included a quantitative DNA assay that could\ndetect the cumulative effects of the increased cell prolifer-\nation rate in response to aTf, and demonstrated that there\nwas a discrete increase in DNA amounts after the treatment\ncompared with the controls.\nBesides analysing the expression levels of the TfRc by\nRT\u00adPCR in the N20.1 cell line, the use of Tf-TR confirmed\nthat Tf was readily incorporated into the cells, and was fur-\nther confirmed by the use of confocal microscopy. When Tf\nwas overexpressed in the N20.1 cell line, Tf was secreted to\nthe culture medium and continued to have a positive effect\non cell proliferation of neighbouring cells, similar to that\nexerted by human aTf. These data imply that Tf has to be\nsecreted to the culture medium and bind to its receptors on\nthe extracellular side of the plasma membrane, rather than\nacting directly within the cell cytoplasm of Tf-overexpressing\ncells.\nThe role played by iron and its relationship with the aTf\nused to supplement the culture medium was analysed by\niron supplementation experiments and evaluating the DNA\ncontent in CTL and aTf-treated N20.1 cells. Previous reports\nhave demonstrated the negative effect of iron depletion on\ncell proliferation in vitro (Renton and Jeitner, 1996; Fu and\nIron must be in its ferric form to bind to the Tf protein.\nFurthermore, Tf in its diferric form (holoTransferrin) has an\naverage affinity for its receptor at least 50 times higher than\naTf at a physiological pH. When ferric iron was added to the\nculture medium at low doses together with aTf, the DNA\ncontent increased compared with the same treatment lack-\ning aTf, and suggests that ferric iron was able to (i) bind to\nTf and increase its saturation and (ii) promote the binding\nto its receptors. However, the addition of higher concentra-\ntions of ferric iron to the culture medium did not have the\nsame effect, and may be indicative of cell damage due to iron\noverload.\nThe possible negative effects of ferrous iron addition to\nthe culture medium might be related to an oxidative stress\nburden mediated by free radical production through the Fen-\nton reaction. The fact that aTf addition to the culture medium\ndid not reverse the negative effects of the ferrous iron might\nbe highlighting the inability of iron in its ferrous state to bind\nto aTf. It is possible that the cell line might lack an effective\n60 C 2013 The Author(s) This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Licence (NC-BY) (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/)\nwhich permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\nTf promotes proliferation of SVZ cells\nferroxidase system that oxidizes the ferrous iron to its ferric\nform, such as that provided by astroglial ceruloplasmin.\nHowever, further determinations will be needed in the\nfuture to confirm if the effects of Tf on cell proliferation\nare mediated in these culture systems by supplying the cells\nwith the much-required iron for cell cycle progression and\nDNA replication (Yu et al., 2007). Other mechanisms might\nbe involved as well in the proliferation process, such as the\nactivation of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-\nERK1/2 (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2) transduc-\ntion signalling pathways downstream of the Tf\u00adTfRc2 com-\nplex formation (Calzolari et al., 2006). Besides, it would be\ninteresting to neatly discriminate the weight each of the TfRc\nhave on proliferation after Tf treatment in culture. A possible\nanswer might be reached with antibodies with blocking ac-\ntivity that recognize TfRc2, or by using interference RNA to\nsilence either TfRc. In addition, the different TfRc2 isoforms\nmight have differential roles in SVZ-derived cells in response\nto Tf.\nOverall, the data presented in this article provide evidence\nfor the use of Tf in the culture media to improve cell ampli-\nfication of SVZ-derived cells, considering their implications\nin the upcoming field of NSC (neural stem cell) replacement\ntherapies for CNS diseases (Low et al., 2008; Kim and de Vel-\nogel\nbeen suggested for clinical trials (Trounson et al., 2011). Fur-\nthermore, in the industrial biotechnology field there is great\ninterest in finding alternate components that can replace\nanimal-derived supplements in culture media, and Tf is one\nof them. Human Tf has proven to have a larger growth-\npromoting effect than the bovine analogue on human cells\nThe aim of this work is to provide a contribution to the\nculturing of neural cells and data that could be considered\nwhen formulating the culture medium for NPC amplification\nin vitro.\n"
