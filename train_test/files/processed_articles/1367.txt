Analysis of\nfactors related to HbA1c may help researchers to better identify children with an increased likelihood of\ndeveloping type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Little is known about\ntype 2 diabetes in children. The increase has been attributed,\nin part, to increasing obesity and overweight among children\nin the United States and in other parts of the world (4).\nSeveral studies have indicated that the prevalence of obesity\namong children and adolescents has increased alarmingly\nduring recent years (5\u00ad14). Similarly, physical inactivity has\nbeen on the rise among children and adolescents in the\nMost children or adolescents diagnosed with type 2\ndiabetes mellitus in the United States are overweight, have a\nfamily history of type 2 diabetes, and display signs of insulin\nresistance. Type 2 diabetes is reported more frequently in\nfemales and in ethnic groups with increased risk (16\u00ad18).\nEarly detection of diabetes may be crucial in reducing the\nimpact of the disease among young people and their families.\nIn addition, analysis of factors related to impaired glucose\nmetabolism might lead to a better understanding of the\ncurrent rise in type 2 diabetes among children. Hemoglobin\nA1c (HbA1c) is used as a quantitative measure of diabetes\ncontrol among persons with diabetes (26\u00ad28). Recently,\nassessment of HbA1c percentage has been suggested as an\nacceptable approach for diagnosing diabetes (19\u00ad21) and for\nuse as a screening tool for detecting type 2 diabetes in adults\nadults without diabetes, HbA1c was found to be significantly\nrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease and\nCorrespondence to Kamal M.

(21) conducted a meta-analysis and obtained\nHbA1c percentages were measured concurrently with oral\nglucose tolerance tests, to determine whether HbA1c can be\nused in place of the oral glucose tolerance test to diagnose\ndiabetes. The study showed that almost 90 percent of\npatients with an HbA1c percentage higher than 7 percent\ncould be classified as having diabetes using the oral glucose\ntolerance test.\nRace/ethnicity has been shown to be significantly related\nto HbA1c among people with diabetes, people with \"border-\nline diabetes,\" and people without diabetes. Among persons\nwith diabetes, African Americans were found to have a\nhigher mean HbA1c percentage than non-Hispanic Whites\nseventh-grade schoolchildren and was found to be higher\namong minority children at increased risk of type 2 diabetes\nthan among non-Hispanic White children (25).\nAccording to Fagot-Campagna et al. (31), among adoles-\ncents aged 12\u00ad19 years who were examined in the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III), the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 4.1 per\npercent confidence interval: 0.4, 7.4); and the prevalence of\npercent confidence interval: 0.2, 35.0). Adolescents with an\nincreased HbA1c percentage were more likely to be African\nAmericans with a high body mass index (BMI).\nThe objective of this article was to identify predictors of\nHbA1c among 4,928 nondiabetic young people who were\nexamined in NHANES III.\nThis analysis was based on data from NHANES III, which\nmethods have been described elsewhere (32, 33).

This version of\nSAS has new features (PROC SURVEYMEANS and\nSURVEYREG) that account for complex sample designs.\nAppropriate sampling weights were used for all analyses.\nIndividuals with missing values for any of the variables\nincluded in the final analysis were excluded. The dependent\nvariable was HbA1c.\nThe independent variables included age (in years) at phys-\nical examination, race/ethnicity, sex, BMI (weight (kg)/\nheight (m)2), maternal BMI, and poverty income ratio.\nPoverty income ratio was used as an indicator of socioeco-\nnomic status. It is the ratio of a family's income to the\npoverty threshold of a family of the same size for the same\ncalendar year. Maternal BMI was used as a crude measure of\nfamilial, genetic, and environmental factors. Univariate and\nmultivariate linear regression analyses were performed for\nassessment of the relation between HbA1c percentage and\nthe independent variables. Three categories were defined for\neach of the continuous independent variables: age, poverty\nincome ratio, BMI, and maternal BMI. Unadjusted as well as\nadjusted mean HbA1c percentages were calculated from\nlinear regression models treating these categories as dummy\nvariables. Then, treating age, poverty income ratio, BMI,\nand maternal BMI as continuous variables, separate models\nwere created for six sex-race/ethnicity categories. Finally,\nanalyses were conducted for four age categories and eight\nage-sex categories. Several interaction terms were examined\nbut were not found to be significant; thus, they were not\nincluded in the final models. No corrections were made for\nmultiple comparisons.\nRESULTS\nAfrican-American, and 1,441 non-Hispanic White children\nwho completed the medical examination; 49.3 percent were\nmales. African Americans and Mexican Americans were\noverrepresented in the sample, because NHANES III was\ndesigned to oversample these two ethnic groups. The\nweighted mean age of the children studied was 10.72 years.\nCharacteristics of the sample and the weighted mean values\nof the variables used in the analysis are given in table 1.\nNon-Hispanic Whites were older at the time of examina-\ntion, had a higher mean poverty income ratio, and had lower\nvalues for HbA1c, BMI, and maternal BMI than African\nAmericans and Mexican Americans. The highest BMI and\nmaternal BMI were observed among Mexican Americans.\nSex was significantly associated with HbA1c percentage\n(table 2).

This was true for African-Amer-\nican males and for females of all three ethnic groups, while\namong non-Hispanic White and Mexican-American males, a\nmore linear association of HbA1c with age was apparent.\nHbA1c was positively associated with BMI (figure 4) and\nnegatively associated with poverty income ratio (figure 5); p\nincome ratio, respectively. However, after data were\ncontrolled for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, this relation\nbecame insignificant.\nIn the multivariate analysis, maternal BMI was signifi-\ncantly associated with HbA1c after BMI was accounted for.\nHowever, after data were controlled for age, sex, and race/\nethnicity, neither BMI nor maternal BMI was related to\nHbA1c. African Americans and Mexican Americans had\nhigher mean HbA1c percentages than non-Hispanic Whites\nafter data were controlled for age, sex, BMI, maternal BMI,\nand poverty income ratio. Females had a significantly lower\nHbA1c percentage than males after other potentially\nconfounding variables in the model were accounted for\n(table 2).\nSeparate regression models were constructed for each\nethnic group. After data were controlled for BMI and\nmaternal BMI, age, and poverty income ratio, sex was\nrelated to HbA1c only among non-Hispanic Whites, with\nfemales having significantly lower mean HbA1c percentages\nthan males. BMI was significantly associated with HbA1c\namong African Americans and Mexican Americans but not\namong non-Hispanic Whites after maternal BMI, age, sex,\nand poverty income ratio were accounted for. When further\nanalyses were performed, BMI was associated with HbA1c\namong African-American males and Mexican-American\nfemales only (table 3).\nWhen analyses were performed separately in the four age\nstrata, African Americans maintained a significantly higher\nHbA1c percentage than did non-Hispanic Whites.

In the univariate analyses, many of the\ndemographic and anthropometric variables studied were\nrelated to HbA1c. However, when race/ethnicity was taken\ninto account, most of these relations became insignificant.\nRates of type 2 diabetes mellitus are higher among African\nAmericans and Mexican Americans than among non-Hispanic\nFIGURE 3.

Most cases of type 2\ndiabetes in children have been reported from minority popula-\ntions (16\u00ad18). This analysis indicated that mean HbA1c\npercentages were higher among nondiabetic African-Amer-\nican and Mexican-American young people than among non-\nHispanic Whites. We found that BMI was related to HbA1c\npercentage among African-American and Mexican-American\nchildren but not among Whites after data were controlled for\nmaternal BMI, age, sex, and poverty income ratio.\nAlthough socioeconomic factors are thought to influence\ntype 2 diabetes risk, poverty income ratio was not strongly\nrelated to HbA1c in these data, after the data were\ncontrolled for race/ethnicity. The three ethnic groups\nvaried significantly with regard to poverty income ratio,\nwhich suggests that poverty income ratio may serve as a\nproxy for socioeconomic status, even if it is a relatively\npoor indicator. However, the question of whether race/\nethnicity is a proxy for socioeconomic status remains and\nhas been actively debated in the literature. Race is clearly a\nsocial rather than a biologic or physiologic variable (39),\nand data show that socioeconomic status accounts for many\nof the observed disparities in health across racial groups\n(40). In the current study, poverty income ratio differed\nsignificantly by race/ethnicity, so we tried to control for it\nin the analysis. However, if poverty income ratio is not a\ngood indicator of socioeconomic status, controlling for it\nmay not have totally eliminated the effect of socioeco-\nnomic status.\nIt has also been observed that ethnic and racial differences\npersist even after socioeconomic status has been accounted\nfor (40). The ethnic differences in these data may reflect the\nincreased risk of diabetes among US minority groups, a\nfinding in line with other reports that most children with type\nOur findings had some design and measurement limita-\ntions. Data obtained from NHANES III are cross-sectional\nand thus limit our ability to draw conclusions about causal\nfactors; further longitudinal studies are warranted. In this\nstudy, poverty income ratio, an imperfect measure of socio-\neconomic status, was used. A combination of variables is\nlikely to reflect socioeconomic status more effectively.\nFurthermore, using BMI as a measure of adiposity to\ncompare children across various age and racial/ethnic groups\nmight not be optimal, since racial disparity in adiposity is\nlikely to be linked to pubertal maturation (41).\nNHANES III was a comprehensive national survey that\ncollected data on a wide range of variables. The survey, by\ndesign, oversampled African Americans and Mexican\nAmericans, thereby including large numbers of minority\nchildren. NHANES III provided the first representative data\nFIGURE 4.
