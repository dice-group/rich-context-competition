And whether or not it can lead to the actualization of past\ninjustices that can ignite new conflicts?\nIn order to investigate how digital media interact with a contentious European past, this article\nexamines how one episode of the Second World War--the capture of Kyiv by the Red Army in\nNovember 1943--is remembered through YouTube. Not only is this episode an important mile-\nstone of the war on the Eastern Front, it is also a \"historical wound\" (Chakrabarty, 2007), a trau-\nmatic mix of history and memory that divides collective experiences of the Second World War in\nUkraine and Russia. By exploring how it is represented through the world's largest video-hosting\nplatform, this article investigates the opportunities that digital media provide for remembering past\nconflicts and how these opportunities are used in Ukraine and Russia. This article also questions\nhow Russophone and Ukrainophone users of YouTube interact with contentious war memories and\nasks if the study of these interactions can deepen our understanding of how the past is viewed in\nUkraine and Russia and how Second World War memory is appropriated in the context of ongoing\nconflict.\nHistorical background\nIn September 1943, the Red Army approached the former capital of Soviet Ukraine, Kyiv, which\nhad been seized by the Germans 2years earlier. The battle that followed--known as the Battle of\nKyiv--was an integral part of a Soviet offensive that resulted in more than four million soldiers\nfrom both sides fighting along a 750-km-long frontline. Over the following 2months, Soviet troops\nmade several attempts to cross the River Dnieper and recapture the city, although these were unsuc-\ncessful because of the heavy losses sustained while crossing the river and the difficult terrain on\nthe German-controlled west bank. Finally, after weeks of bloodshed, the Red Army organized a\nsimultaneous attack on Kyiv from two bridgeheads--Lyutezh and Bukrin--and captured the city\non 6 November, just before the anniversary of the October Revolution, the most important state\nholiday in the Soviet Union. This victory, however, was achieved at the expense of heavy losses\nwhich were seemingly a result of haste linked to the desire to capture the city in time for the anni-\nversary (Korol, 2005: 22) as well as of the massive mobilization of Ukrainians, who were often\nsent to battle unprepared and according to some testimonies practically unarmed (Koval, 1999:\nThe successful actions of the Red Army during the Battle of Kyiv had a profound impact on the\ncourse of the war on the Eastern Front. The capture of Kyiv led to the destabilization of the German\nfront and a rapid Soviet advance in 1944, followed by the retreat of German troops from Ukraine.\nThe liberation of the Ukrainian capital also had significant symbolic and ideological meaning that\nwas extensively used in Soviet propaganda (Korol, 2003). Not only was the capture of Kyiv pre-\nsented as a decisive victory of Soviet people over their enemy, but the liberation of the \"immortal\nheart of Ukraine\" (Shulzhenko and Tykhonenko, 2013: 4) was also interpreted as a key condition\nfor the restoration of the Soviet rule in Ukraine. The propaganda, however, omitted the heavy\nlosses suffered by the Red Army in the course of battle and, instead, focused on praising the hero-\nism of Soviet soldiers and describing German losses (Shulzhenko and Tykhonenko, 2013: 3).\nAfter the end of the war, the Battle of Kyiv quickly became an integral part of the Great Patriotic\nWar myth that defined practices of public Second World War commemoration in the Soviet Union.\nDuring the Khrushchev period, the day of liberation, 6 November, became an official holiday--the\nDay of the Liberation of Kyiv from the Nazi invaders--and the actions of the Red Army during the\nBattle of Kyiv were unequivocally praised in Soviet historiography, which avoided any mention of\nMakhortykh 3\nthe battle's less glorious aspects (Hrynevych, 2005). Similarly, while numerous monuments com-\nmemorating the Second World War appeared in Kyiv during the Soviet period,2 the majority of\nthem were dedicated to the Soviet High Command, while the suffering of rank-and-file soldiers\nremained largely ignored. Only in the late 1970s did a few monuments dedicated to ordinary par-\nticipants of the Battle of Kyiv appear in the Ukrainian capital, and yet, these monuments com-\nmemorated soldiers who liberated the city from the victorious Lyutezh bridgehead. In contrast, the\nBukrin bridgehead, which distracted the majority of German forces and where the bloodiest clashes\ntook place, remained forgotten (Makhortykh, 2014).\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union had a dramatic impact on the collective memory of the\nSecond World War in the countries of the former Soviet bloc. The collapse of the Soviet system\nwas accompanied by the revision of the Soviet past, which included fierce criticism of the Great\nPatriotic War narrative that in the beginning of the 1990s was contrasted by \"a rich amalgam of\npassion, regret, nostalgia, rage and remembrance\" (Tumarkin, 2003: 602). While in Ukraine the\nannual Soviet-style celebration of the liberation of Kyiv continued after 1991, a number of\ntioning traditional views of the event. The revision of the Soviet narrative about the Battle of Kyiv\nmade it possible to integrate those traumatic memories that were left out by the glorious story about\nthe liberation into the public discourse of the Second World War; yet, a number of scholars (Jilge,\nnot to the demythologization of the Second World War, but to the formation of new myths, which\nemphasized the martyrdom and heroism of the Ukrainian people. In the case of the Battle of Kyiv,\nthis shift toward \"competing victimhood\" (Jilge, 2008) in the Ukrainian historiography of the\nSecond World War resulted in the deglorification of the event and the propagation of a view of the\nbattle as a Soviet crime against the Ukrainian people (Korol, 2005) or even an instance of genocide\nThese radical revisions of the traditional narrative of Soviet heroism and glorious liberation\nturned the Battle of Kyiv into one of the problematic issues in Ukrainian\u00adRussian memory rela-\ntions, which diverged sharply during the Perestroika and, in particular, in the first half of the 1990s.\nDespite significant challenges to the Great Patriotic War narrative in the late 1980s and early\n1990s, the cultural memory of Second World War in Russia experienced significantly fewer\nchanges when compared with the Soviet period than in Ukraine. The revival of the Soviet war nar-\nrative--together with Soviet traditions of Second World War commemoration--in Russia in the\nsecond half of the 1990s and especially in the beginning of the 2000s further contributed to the rise\nof \"memory wars\" (Kurilla, 2009) between the two countries, especially concerning the question\nof Soviet war crimes. This memory warfare was not limited to academic historiographies and,\ninstead, became increasingly present in political debates in Ukraine and Russia; an illustrative\nexample of such increased politicization in the case of the Battle of Kyiv is the fierce dismissal of\ncriticism of the Soviet High Command's actions by the Russian Minister of Culture, Vladimir\nthe anniversary\" and subsequent heavy Soviet losses (Korol, 2005) were no more than anti-Rus-\nsian fantasies.\nThese complexities demonstrate why memory of the Battle of Kyiv remains a source of contro-\nversy both inside and outside Ukraine. Similar to other historical wounds, which haunt collective\nmemories of war in different countries, the traumatic legacy of the Battle of Kyiv can hardly be\ncomprehended through the lens of national memory practices only. While the de-territorialized\nspace of digital media can provide new opportunities for dialogue about a contentious past and\neventually lead to the overcoming of historical trauma (Levy and Sznaider, 2002: 91), the degree\nto which these opportunities are used by Ukrainian and Russian internet users is currently unclear.\nBy examining how YouTube is employed for remembering the Battle of Kyiv and interacting with\nmemories about it, the study questions the impact of digital technology on traumatic memories of\nthe Second World War in Ukraine and Russia.\nLiterature review\nToday, both war and memory are \"narrated, experienced and performed\" (Kuntsman, 2010a: 1) in\ndigital media, bringing a fundamental shift in how conflicts are remembered. Not only does this\nshift have profound implications for how old and new conflicts alike are perceived by general\npublic, but it also opens new venues for appropriating their memory both for provoking and pre-\nventing future conflicts. The reach and speed of digital media produce increased connectivity\nbetween the forms, agents, and discourses of memory, leading to unprecedented opportunities for\nthe archiving and retrieving of the past (Hoskins, 2009). The consequences of this oversupply of\nevidence for war commemoration are many and vary from the increased ability to document war\natrocities to the burgeoning use of digital representations of conflict for information warfare;\ntogether these result in the transformation of \"modes of witnessing, feeling and remembering vio-\nWhile a number of studies (Berengrer, 2006; Hoskins and O'Loughlin, 2010; Matheson and\nStuart, 2010) examine how this transformation affects remembrance of contemporary conflicts,\nsignificantly less research has been done on the remediation of old wars in \"new\" media. In recent\nyears, a number of works on the use of digital media for the commemoration of past conflicts have\nnote, the majority of these studies paid only marginal attention to developments outside the West\nand, in particular, the post-Soviet countries.3 Consequently, the level of academic assessment of\ninteractions between digital media and contentious memories in Eastern Europe remains low, even\nwhile the extensive presence of the past constitutes one of the essential features of this region's\nThis article attempts to contribute to the closure of this gap in digital memory scholarship by\nlooking at how the Battle of Kyiv is remembered through YouTube, one of the online platforms\nwhose impact on remembrance of past and present conflicts is increasingly recognized. Not only is\nYouTube the world's largest video-sharing platform, used by millions of users to publish and watch\nvideos, it also allows individuals to comment on what they watched. Such a combination turns the\nplatform into a \"portal of cultural memory\" (Hilderbrand, 2007: 54) that provides users with an\nopportunity to share their view on the past by making audiovisual memorabilia and commenting\non others' creations. According to Jones and Gibson (2012), the heightened level of interaction\nwith memories that is enabled through YouTube not only enhances the remembrance experience\nbut also democratizes collective remembrance of the traumatic past. Similar views are expressed\nby Knudsen and Stage, who argue that YouTube can facilitate \"the creation of a democratized\nmemory practice\" (2013: 432) by allowing ordinary citizens to share their views on war com-\nmemoration and manifest their disagreement with dominant discourses of the past.\nAt the same time, Danilova (2014) in her study of digital commemoration of British fatalities in\nIraq and Afghanistan notes that digital media and, in particular, YouTube, can not only provide\nspace for alternative narratives of war and suffering but also sustain the mainstream framing of the\ncontentious past and foreclose public discussion of ethical dilemmas. Instead of questioning the\nambivalent context of British involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, digital memorials to British\nsoldiers strengthen the official framing of both conflicts by focusing on \"military professionalism\nand individual qualities of service personnel\" (Danilova, 2014: 278) and encouraging support for\nthe armed forces as well as military operations themselves. Drinot (2011) in his study of digital\nMakhortykh 5\nremembrance of the War of the Pacific provides an even more pessimistic assessment of the inter-\nactions between YouTube and war memories by arguing that, instead of facilitating production of\nnew global narratives of the past, the platform serves as an outlet for \"ultra-nationalism inflected\nby virulent racism\" (p. 381). Similarly, Benzaquen (2014) argues that comment culture on YouTube\nturns it into an \"aggressive and entertainment-oriented environment\" (p. 805) that complicates the\nplatform's use as an outlet for historical interpretations.\nThese diverging evaluations prompt critical assessment of YouTube's impact on the contentious\nmemory of old conflicts--especially in Eastern Europe, where \"digital media form a pivotal dis-\ncursive territory\" (Rutten and Zvereva, 2013: 2) for narrating and experiencing the past. By exam-\nining how Ukrainophone and Russophone users interact with memory of the Battle of Kyiv on\nYouTube, this article tests both optimistic and pessimistic assumptions by questioning the purpose\nbehind these interactions. While it is hardly debatable that YouTube can, in theory, enhance com-\nmemorative experiences and expand the limits of war remembrance, it is less clear whether the\nplatform is actually used for this purpose and whether or not it can at the same time promote intol-\nerant and biased views on the past.\nMethodology\nIn order to collect data for the study, I used YouTube's own search engine to work my way through\nthe platform's huge collection of audiovisual materials. On 12 March 2015, two queries--\"\n\"the Battle of Kyiv 1943\")--were used to search for videos that could be relevant for the study;\nnone of YouTube's filters were applied during the search, in order to avoid any possible limits on\ndata collection. The language of queries was chosen based on the official status of the Russian and\nthe Ukrainian languages in Russia and Ukraine, respectively; however, it is worth noting that the\nRussian language is also commonly used in Ukraine, especially in eastern regions, where it is a\npreferred language, and central regions, where both Ukrainian and Russian are equally common\n(Khmelko, 2004). One of the consequences of this complex linguistic situation is that it is hard to\ndetermine the nationality of users who produce YouTube clips and/or comments in Russian: these\ncan be either Russian-speaking Russians or Russian-speaking Ukrainians.\nBased on search results, I selected 50 YouTube clips that were related to the Battle of Kyiv. For\nthis purpose, I examined the descriptions of videos that were provided on YouTube; in those cases\nwhere such a description was absent, I examined the clip's content in order to decide whether or\nnot it should be included in the study. The final decision was based on whether or not content of a\ngiven video included explicit references to the Battle of Kyiv of 1943 and/or commemorative prac-\ntices associated with it.\nSimilar to earlier studies of YouTube and conflict memories (Benzaquen, 2014; Harju, 2014;\nKnudsen and Stage, 2013), I used content analysis to examine how the platform was used for com-\nmemoration on two levels: the level of representation (i.e. how the event was presented on\nYouTube) and the level of interaction (i.e. how YouTube users interacted with memory of the\nevent). In the first case, I explored the content of clips--as well as their descriptions on YouTube--\nin order to investigate how the Battle of Kyiv is framed online and what audiovisual genres are\nused to encode Second World War memory in the Web 2.0 environment.\nIn the latter case, I looked at how YouTube users interact with audiovisual memories about the\nBattle of Kyiv by examining different forms of feedback that are facilitated by the platform. While\nthe majority of studies on YouTube and memory (Drinot, 2011; Jones and Gibson, 2012; Knudsen\nand Stage, 2013) explore how users interact with each other and audiovisual materials verbally (i.e.\nthrough YouTube comments), the platform also enables nonverbal interactions through the systems\nof view counts and likes/dislikes. In this study, I considered both verbal and nonverbal forms of\ninteractions in order to investigate how Russophone and Ukrainophone users experience memory\nof the Battle of Kyiv online. Furthermore, I explored the significance of audiovisual genres used\non YouTube for representing memory of the Battle of Kyiv and how clips of different genres were\nreceived by YouTube users.\nFindings\nRepresentation\nIn this section, I examine video clips associated with the Battle of Kyiv that were found on\nYouTube. Using content analysis, I identified four major audiovisual genres that were used by\nUkrainophone and Russophone users to commemorate this event: tributes, documentaries, journal-\nistic reports, and amateur records.4 The majority of these genres (i.e. documentaries) are not unique\nto YouTube or digital media in general; however, their use for the remediation of Second World\nWar memory through online platforms such as YouTube remains underexplored. Below I examine\nexactly how each of these genres was used to commemorate the battle.\nTributes constituted one of the most interesting genres of war remembrance on YouTube, as\nthey employed digital technology for producing amateur accolades to those who fell in the Battle\nof Kyiv. As their name suggests, tributes were amateur clips that focused on praising the heroism\nand self-sacrifice of Soviet soldiers in a highly sentimental way; such a specific purpose together\nwith the use of amateurish video-making techniques differentiated tributes from other audiovisual\ngenres found in my study. Unlike other genres, which were characterized by relative uniformity in\nthe way they structured the representation of the battle, tributes tended to be more diverse and\npersonalized. While the choice of content varied significantly among videos in this genre, the\nmajority of them featured historical photos and/or footage as well as fragments of contemporary\ndocumentaries, together with several lines of explanatory text that provided brief historical back-\nground about the event. Often, tributes were accompanied with music, which varied from Soviet\nmilitary marches to Russian heavy metal.\nThe focus on the glorious aspects of the Battle of Kyiv is one feature that was common to almost\nall tributes. The majority of visuals5 that were used for clips in this genre showed Soviet soldiers\nin action, irrepressibly moving forward, whereas Germans were usually shown either retreating or\ndead. Similarly, explanatory texts described the battle as a brilliant operation that was perfectly\nexecuted by Soviet troops and led to significant gains on the Eastern Front. The subject of Soviet\nlosses,6 however, was almost completely excluded from tributes, which avoided referring to it\neither visually or textually. Neither photos, nor footage showed dead Soviet soldiers, and the only\nexact figure that was cited in tributes in relation to the Red Army was the number of soldiers who\nwere awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. In contrast, the only reference to Soviet losses\namong all the tributes analyzed suggested that less than 1% of the Red Army soldiers who fought\nin the battle were killed; by contrast, some contemporary evaluations suggest that Soviet fatalities\nconsistent that it is possible to speak about strongly established conventions for representing the\nBattle of Kyiv in this genre; the origins of these conventions seem to be rooted in the Soviet myth\nof the war as well as taboos associated with it.\nWhile the majority of tributes in Ukrainian and Russian alike articulated a sense of triumph and\njoy, a few clips attempted to problematize this Soviet-style interpretation of the Battle of Kyiv. A\nvideo titled \"    1943 \" (\"The Battle for Kyiv in 1943\") departed from the estab-\nlished practices of tribute-making by focusing not on active but on static images. Instead of\nMakhortykh 7\nframing the event through historical photos or footage, which showed Soviet soldiers on the move\nand instilled in the viewer a sense of action and excitement, the video deliberately chose contem-\nporary images that originated from the museum of the Battle of Kyiv at the Novy-Petrivtsi village\nnear Kyiv as well as the neighboring monument to Soviet soldiers who fell during the battle. By\nfocusing on postbattle images (e.g. museum stands and memorials) instead of battle images (e.g.\nphotos and footage of combat action), the video shifted the emphasis from the past to the present.\nWhile doing so, it attracted the viewer's attention to subjects that were omitted in other tributes,\nincluding the importance of remembering not only the victory but also the sacrifices made to attain\nit; however, it still fell short of openly discussing Soviet fatalities during the battle.\nThe extensive use of historical photos and footage was also common among the second genre\nof audiovisual representations of the battle, which is the documentary. As the term suggests, this\ngenre comprised nonfictional films that embodied \"a simulacrum of the perceptual experience of\nhuman existence\" (Aitken, 2013: 2). Many of these films were produced for educational purposes\nand then uploaded to YouTube--either as complete videos or fragments. While both tributes and\ndocumentaries used historical materials to illustrate the statements they make, documentaries usu-\nally included larger amount of contemporary content, such as commentaries from scholars and\ninterviews with eyewitnesses. Furthermore, unlike digital-origin tributes, documentaries were usu-\nally made for traditional media rather than digital media and relied less on the use of amateurish\ndigital video-making techniques.\nIn contrast to tributes, which demonstrated significant commonality between Ukrainophone and\nRussophone clips in predominantly promoting the glorious view of the Battle of Kyiv articulated by\nSoviet historiography, documentaries propagated different views on the event depending on their\ncountry of origin.7 These differences reflected significant distinctions between the Ukrainian and\nRussian historiographies of the battle, which were discussed earlier. Russian documentaries tended to\nreproduce the traditional Soviet view of the battle, which emphasized the successful implementation\nof the High Command's sophisticated strategy and the heroism of Soviet soldiers. While some of them\nreferred to the heavy Soviet losses, such references were limited to abstract statements (e.g. \"the waters\nof Dnieper were red with blood\") and avoided citing exact numbers.8 Similarly, while some Russian\ndocumentaries did mention the widespread perception that the battle of Kyiv was seemingly timed in\norder to mark the anniversary of the October Revolution, all of them dismissed this as fantasy.\nIn contrast, Ukrainian documentaries unanimously emphasized the significant losses sustained\nby the Red Army, ranging from 417,000 to 1 million killed in the battle. Many of them also accused\nthe Soviet High Command of deliberately destroying the Ukrainian population through criminal\nfield mobilizations designed to ensure the city was taken in time for the anniversary. The focus on\nsuffering--both of mobilized Ukrainians and Soviet soldiers in general--was a common feature of\nUkrainian documentaries, which often included visceral descriptions of the hardships experienced\nby Soviet soldiers during the battle. Many of these descriptions, however, relied on controversial\nimages (e.g. the story about German machine-gunners who shot too many Soviet soldiers and went\nmad9) that originated from the individual war memoirs or works by adherents of revisionist views,\nsuch as Victor Suvorov (2014) or Mark Solonin (2008). By employing these controversial images,\nUkrainian documentaries evoked the tendency toward myth-making that was common for Russian\ndocumentaries; however, unlike the latter ones which relied on memory tropes from the Soviet war\nmyths, Ukrainian documentaries tended to refer to opposite tropes that originated from revisionist\nworks on the Second World War. Some of the claims made in Ukrainian documentaries sounded\nalmost absurd--for instance, about Stalin's order to arm mobilized Ukrainian males only with\nhalves of bricks10--even though they were presented by documentaries' narrators as statements of\nthe same credibility as the ones produced by established scholars whose comments on the Battle of\nKyiv were also included in documentaries.\nYet, Russian and Ukrainian documentaries from YouTube differed not only in the factual sense\nbut also in the way these facts were represented. The majority of Russian documentaries relied on\nhistorical footage produced by Germans and Soviets in the course of the battle or contemporary\nanimation, stylized to resemble historical footage. Similar to tributes, these documentaries were\naction focused and brought the viewer into the thick of the Soviet offensive; at the same time, they\nusually omitted showing scenes of Red Army deaths or dead bodies. In contrast, Ukrainian docu-\nmentaries demonstrated limited use of historical footage; instead, the main focus was on historical\nreenactment, together with interviews with witnesses that made their approach more personal and\nfocused on the present--instead of the past. The subject of death was also much more present in\nUkrainian documentaries than in Russian ones: the former not only discussed death frequently but\nalso included gory images that communicated the pain and suffering to the viewer. Such a differ-\nence again can be explained by reliance on different memory frameworks: the Soviet myth of the\nGreat Patriotic War with its taboo on the discussion of Soviet fatalities in the case of Russian docu-\nmentaries and the revisionist narrative of the Second World War together with nationalistic dis-\ncourses of victimhood of Ukrainian people in the case of Ukrainian ones.\nUnlike tributes and documentaries, which were mostly focused on the battle itself, the final two\ngenres--journalistic reports and amateur records--dealt exclusively with the present-day context.\nThe former genre consisted of reports made by professional journalists for Ukrainian and Russian\nTV channels, whereas the latter included videos made by ordinary people. In both cases, the major-\nity of clips were dedicated to annual celebrations of the liberation of Kyiv in Ukraine in November\n2010\u00ad2013; however, the journalistic reports tended to provide a more complex view of the event,\noften including brief interviews with Soviet veterans and/or a brief explanation of the historical\nbackground of the battle, whereas the amateur records simply showed footage from celebration\nwithout any additional commentary.\nOne significant difference between journalistic reports and other genres concerned the political\ninstrumentalization of Second World War memory for present-day purposes. Such political instru-\nmentalization and appropriation was a defining feature of a number of journalistic reports pro-\nduced in 2012 and especially in 2013. This sort of instrumental use of memory of the Battle of Kyiv\nin the context of contemporary politics was typical of both Ukrainian and Russian mass media.\nOne report produced in 2012 for the Ukrainian TV channel, for instance, compared what at the time\nwas Ukraine's ruling party--the Party of Regions--to the Nazis who occupied Kyiv, suggesting\nthe party would have to be expelled during the new battle for the Ukrainian capital.11 In a similar\nmanner, a Russian channel complained about nationalistic distortions of history in Ukraine, citing\nas evidence the absence of red flags and greetings for the Red Army on the streets of Kyiv.12\nThis obtrusive appropriation of memory of the Battle of Kyiv in journalistic reports contrasted\nwith the absence of commentaries in amateur records. While this feature limits their interpretative\nvalue, the large number of such records, which were the most common genre of audiovisual repre-\nsentation of the Battle of Kyiv on YouTube, points to the importance of the celebration of the city's\nliberation for Ukrainian and Russian users, who considered it significant enough to be filmed,\nuploaded, and shared online. The analysis of amateur records also indicated which aspects of\noffline commemoration attracted the most interest from the audience: in the case of the Battle of\nKyiv, the majority of records focused on the historical reenactment of the Soviet offensive on the\nLyutezh bridgehead and demonstrated the producers' particular fascination with the use of authen-\ntic aircraft from the Soviet and German sides.\nThe findings of this section suggest that YouTube hosts different narratives about the Battle of\nKyiv, which vary significantly in their framing and interpretation of the event. The platform's abil-\nity to accommodate divergent views on the past and articulate the variety of emotions, ranging\nfrom grief to pride, supports earlier suggestions (Jones and Gibson, 2012; Knudsen and Stage,\nMakhortykh 9\n2013) about YouTube's potential for the democratization of collective remembrance. The co-exist-\nence of contradictory narratives on the same platform, however, does not necessarily lead to the\nformation of a new cosmopolitan and pluralist view on the contentious past. In contrast, my find-\nings suggest that, as in the case of other historical wounds (Drinot, 2011), digital clips dedicated to\nthe Battle of Kyiv tend to promote national as well as nationalistic interpretations of this episode\nof the Second World War. Consequently, instead of viewing YouTube as the source of new digital\nforms of transnational remembrance, it seems more reasonable to consider it as a prism, which\nfacilitates comparison of how the past is viewed in Ukraine and Russia.\nInteraction\nNext, I examined how YouTube users interacted with audiovisual memories of the Battle of Kyiv\nin verbal and nonverbal ways. I started with nonverbal forms of interaction, which include view-\ning, liking, or disliking of YouTube videos; while these forms of feedback have lesser interpreta-\ntive value than comments, they can exhibit general patterns of interaction as well as point to\ngenre-related variation in the way users interact with the past.\nTable 1 indicates that users' attention was distributed extremely unequally among individual\nvideos used to represent the Battle of Kyiv on YouTube. While the view count for some YouTube\nclips went into the hundreds of thousands, other clips were viewed only a few dozen times. The\nsame inequality--albeit on a lesser scale--was found in the distribution of likes and dislikes: while\nthe majority of videos were not (dis)liked at all or received one or two likes, some of them pro-\nvoked much stronger emotional reactions. While no statistical tests were done, all nonverbal forms\nof feedback seem related to each other--i.e. videos with larger view counts tended to receive more\nTable 1. Users' interactions with the Battle of Kyiv videos.\nMinimum 1st Quartile Median 3rd Quartile Maximum\nTributes \nDocumentaries \nAmateur records \nJournalistic\nreports\n\nlikes/dislikes as well as comments. That said, another study is needed to prove or disprove this\nsuggestion empirically.\nWhile the highly unequal reception of different representations of the Battle of Kyiv is not sur-\nprising and, thus, cannot be viewed as a finding by itself, it is worth considering why some of clips\nattracted considerably larger attention than others. While it is hard to explain, based on YouTube\ndata, why some videos provoked significant interest, whereas others did not, I considered several\nfactors that might influence users' preferences. My observations suggest that duration of a given\nvideo's presence on YouTube was not an influential factor: even while some of the most viewed\nvideos were uploaded to YouTube in 2011/2012, many others appeared around the same time but\nwere not viewed that often. In contrast, the choice of language seemed to be more relevant: the\nmajority of the most frequently viewed videos were made in Russian--or at least used Russian\ntitles. This strategy allowed videos' creators to target the more numerous Russophone audience,\nwhich included both Russian-speaking Ukrainians and Russians, whereas Ukrainian-only repre-\nsentations were reliant on a smaller target audience.\nThe most important factor linked to the popularity of a given clip, however, would appear to be\ngenre. Table 1 suggests that tributes and documentaries attracted significantly more attention--\nboth in terms of views and emotional responses--than amateur records and journalistic reports.\nWhile there are many possible reasons for this sort of distribution of interest in genres, I suggest\nthat one of these could be the fact that tributes and documentaries provided the viewer with a more\nemotional and authentic commemorative experience that resulted in reverberation of affective\nstates in and out of YouTube.13 Unlike reports and records that focused on content related to con-\ntemporary commemoration practices and that tended to provide brief--and often dry--commen-\ntary on the Battle of Kyiv, both tributes and documentaries were often affectively charged and\nshared with the viewer a wide range of memorabilia, varying from historical photos to interviews\nwith eyewitnesses. The use of sound, such as the Soviet war marches in tributes or sad instrumental\nmotifs in Ukrainian documentaries, is another factor that contributed to mobilization of interest\namong viewers of clips of these two genres who experienced what Thompson and Biddle (2013)\ncall \"affective transmissions\" (p. 5). Yet, the deeper examination of the reasons behind the attrac-\ntiveness of a particular genre for nonverbal interactions remains beyond the scope of current\nresearch and is a subject for a separate study.\nUnlike nonverbal forms of interaction, which pointed to significant distinctions in the reception\nof different genres of YouTube remembrance, the analysis of verbal interaction indicated much\nlesser inter-genre variety. Instead, the majority of verbal responses independent of the video's\ngenre expressed negative feelings varying from anxiety to rage, whereas positive emotions were\nexpressed rather rarely. Based on content analysis of comments, I suggest that users' reactions to\nrepresentations of the Battle of Kyiv mainly revolved around three highly contentious and emo-\ntionally charged subjects: the current situation in Ukraine, the struggle for historical truth, and\ncommemoration of Soviet victory in the Second World War.\nThe majority of responses to digital clips dedicated to the Battle of Kyiv involved appropriating\nSecond World War memory in connection to the current crisis in Ukraine. Often this was done by\ndrawing parallels between the war years and the current conflict in Eastern Ukraine in general\n(\"   ,   -- 2014?\" (\"Many images of burning\nhouses look completely like today--in summer 2014\"); xtyjlx) or by directly framing the post-\nEuromaidan Ukrainian government as successors to Nazi Germany (\"  !\n        --!\" (\"Greetings,\nKievites! Freedom to Kiev and the Russian and Ukrainian peoples from Maidan's homosexuals-\nfascists!\"); EVGENIY 61RUS). Many comments compared the Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine\nwithout a fight in 2014, and to whom?\");  ) and expressed a desire to reclaim\nUkraine which was seemingly lost for Russia after the overthrow of President Yanukovych in 2014\n(\"      \" (\"Seems like we should liberate it again\");\nNikolay Bukert).\nThe second most common type of reaction revolved around the question of historical truth and\nthe (in)adequacy of current commemorative practices related to the Battle of Kyiv. Unlike com-\nments related to the Ukraine crisis, which were produced mainly by Russophone users, comments\non historical truth were distributed equally between Ukrainophone and Russophone viewers. Both\ntypes of users were particularly active in commenting on the interpretations provided in Ukrainian\ndocumentaries. While a number of users praised the revision of the traditional Soviet narrative on\nthe Battle of Kyiv (\"       `9 ',    \"\n(\"THIS should be shown on TV on `9 May', not this Muscovite shit\"); OmyLeg), others were more\ncritical (\" , ,    --!   ,   \n   7- ,   ...  ,  ,\n     !\" (\"Wow, what a whore, a fag, he lied from the very beginning!\nIt was proven that Kyiv was not captured for 7 November, it was a coincidence ... Authors, you are\ncock-suckers, liberal condoms, I would like to fuck your mouths one by one!\"); osjabender). The\nmajority of comments of this type promoted a particular interpretation of the Battle of Kyiv--\neither from the Ukrainian or the Russian historiography--even while a few reactions criticized the\nnationalistic view of the past in general (\"    \n   \" (\"Another provocation for igniting national strife between\nRussians and Ukrainians\");  .).\nWhile I also found comments that expressed admiration for the heroism of Soviet soldiers\n(\"   !\" (\"Eternal memory for liberators!\"); AntiK AntiK) or\nemphasized the importance of remembering their sacrifices (\"    \n    \" (\"These films have to be shown on TV, so people will never for-\nget\"); MrMid1night), such reactions were not numerous. Consequently, they remained barely\nnoticeable against the backdrop of aggressive statements, many of which were of a nationalistic\n(\" ,       `',   , ,    ,\n !!!!\" (\"A nation of cowards, their surnames end with `ko', go to the forests, fags, you\nare not our brothers, but betrayers!!!!\");  ) or homophobic nature (\"  ,\n     .       \n.      ,   ,       \n .  ,   ?\" (\"Why, for fuck's sake, did you, a fascist homosexual,\ncrawled onto this YouTube channel? Continue masturbating over your Banderites'exploits on your\nown channels. I do not give a fuck about your shitty Council, both in Kyiv and the upper one, and\nfuck you too. Understand, you, fat-eater?\"; cc c). Even though the resulting environment could be\nidentified as an \"interactive commemorative space\" (Knudsen and Stage, 2013: 420), the metaphor\nof Drinot, who likened comments on YouTube as \"a nasty shouting match between anonymous\nMy findings suggest that nonverbal interactions with audiovisual representations of the Battle\nof Kyiv varied depending on the genre of the given video: tributes and documentaries provoked\nmore emotional reactions and attracted more attention than journalistic reports and amateur records.\nIn contrast, verbal interactions showed little variety between genres as the majority of comments\nexpressed negative emotions, which often appeared as aggressive statements addressed to other\nYouTube users. The predominance of such reactions--as well as the tendency for them to be\nframed in nationalistic or homophobic terms--problematizes the idea of using social media as a\ncommemorative space. While some users employed YouTube for what can be viewed as overcom-\ning historical controversies and debating over a contentious past, others used the platform for\nappropriating memory of the Battle of Kyiv in order to frame the current Ukrainian crisis and\ndehumanize their both real and virtual opponents. Consequently, while it is hardly debatable that\nYouTube provides a variety of opportunities for interacting with different visions of the past, it is\nworth noting that these interactions are often hostile and aggressive. However, despite the aggres-\nsiveness of its environment, YouTube remains a space where Ukrainian and Russian Internet users\ncan discuss their contentious past and its relation with the present, which is particularly valuable in\nthe context of ongoing crisis between two countries.\nConclusion\nThe findings of this study suggest that YouTube facilitates remembrance of the traumatic past by\nopening up a new space for commemoration, a space that is less limited by national borders than\noffline commemorative spaces. The de-territorialized environment of digital media accommodates\ndifferent views of the past and allows for representation and sharing of distinct historical narratives\nonline. In the case of the Battle of Kyiv, it leads to the co-existence of Soviet, Russian, and\nUkrainian interpretations of this event on the same digital platform. Even while these interpreta-\ntions are not necessarily represented equally, the variety of digital clips dedicated to the Battle of\nKyiv contrasts positively with offline commemorative practices, which tend to promote one-sided\nviews of the event and ignore alternative interpretations. Consequently, my observations comply\nwith the ones made by Jones and Gibson (2012) who argue that YouTube has the potential to enrich\nthe remembrance experience by enabling \"a cultural exchange of shared experience that more\ntraditional forms of remembrance are unable to provide\" (p. 127).\nAt the same time, my findings suggest that mediatization of war memories does not necessarily\nlead to the formation of new cosmopolitan narratives of the past that transcend \"ethnic and national\nboundaries\" (Levy and Sznaider, 2002: 88). Instead, even in the transnational space of digital media,\nmemory of the Battle of Kyiv is predominantly represented in terms of national--and often national-\nistic--interpretations of the Second World War. Similar to the Latin American context, where digital\nrepresentations of historical traumas are largely determined by local historiographies that portray\nthese traumas in highly contradictory ways (Drinot, 2011), Ukrainophone and Russophone users tend\nto use YouTube not to challenge national narratives of the past but to disseminate and propagate these\nnarratives online. While these users do interact with each other through the platform, these interac-\ntions are often limited to offensive comments that challenge opponents' views in an obnoxious way\nand impede discussions about the past instead of stimulating them. Consequently, instead of con-\nstructing new narratives about the contentious past, YouTube tends to recreate established practices\nof war commemoration in Ukraine and Russia and, thus, contributes to their conservation.\nAt the same time, even while YouTube discussions are permeated by \"user flaming and crass-\nness\" (Hess, 2009: 431), it does not necessarily invalidate the platform's potential for democratiz-\ning war remembrance. Despite the aggressive comment culture on YouTube, which turns it into a\n\"battlefield in transnational politics\" (Benzaquen, 2014: 805) and often takes the form of hate\nspeech, the platform serves as space where preeminent discourses of the past can be disputed and\nscrutinized. This opportunity for expressing public commemorative disagreement with dominant\nmemory narratives is particularly important for postsocialist countries, where war memories are\noften disproportionately politicized and regularly instrumentalized for collective mobilization.\nUnder these circumstances, social media such as YouTube can serve as a platform for political and\ncultural self-expression, thus facilitating comprehensive assessment of the contentious past and the\nestablishment of more pluralist narratives about the Battle of Kyiv.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publi-\ncation of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n 2. It is worth noting, however, that Soviet practices of Second World War commemoration were not static.\nThe first postwar decade in the Soviet Union was characterized by the predominance of informal com-\nmemorative practices as the official celebration of the Soviet victory was put to halt in 1947 by the\nStalin's decision. The Victory Day was reinstalled as state holiday only in 1965, when under Brezhnev \"a\nfull-blown cult of the Great Patriotic War\" (Tumarkin, 2003: 601) started to form. For more information\n 3. For a few notable exceptions, see works by Kuntsman (2010b), Morenkova (2012), and Rutten et al.\n 4. The typology of genres used in this study is a provisional one and is introduced for distinguishing dif-\nferent types of audiovisual content on YouTube. Some of genres names, such as tributes, are my own\nterms.\n 5. One example of such videos is a video clip titled \"The Great Patriotic War--the Battle for Dnieper (1943-\n1944)\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FLRJ7bi5fE) that combines historical footage with modern\nanimations. Another example is a video clip titled \"Battle for Dnieper. The Eastern Wall\" that uses static\nimages accompanied with a large amount of text (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOZc2CMsZZ0).\n 6. It is worth noting that the question of Soviet war fatalities remains controversial even today. During the\nSoviet period, the issue of human losses on the Soviet side was silenced; while during the Perestroika\ntime, the discussion on the matter has been initiated both in public and academic spheres, the evaluations\n 7. Unlike tributes, which were often produced by anonymous YouTube users and, thus, were hard to attrib-\nute to a particular country, documentaries uploaded on YouTube usually included information about their\nproducers. Such an information serves as more reliable identifier than the language of a clip, because, for\ninstance, a number of Ukrainian documentaries were produced in Russian, not Ukrainian. One example\nof such documentaries is the clip titled \"Battle for Kyiv--The documentary--Inter\" (https://www.you-\ntube.com/watch?v=zgFeUN-Sfrs) that was produced for the Ukrainian TV channel Inter.\n 8. See, for instance, a short documentary titled \"The liberation of Kyiv from German-fascist invaders. The\nrecord of 1943\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dG8pXz_-NA).\n9. One of possible sources of this memory trope is the memoirs of Nikolai Nikulin, who described the\nunsuccessful operations of the Red Army on the Volkhov front in 1942 (Pekarsh and Pernavskij,\n2015). It has, however, found its way to the Ukrainian documentaries about the Battle of Kyiv, such\nas the one titled \"Black infantry. Dnieper-Kyiv offensive operation\" (https://www.youtube.com/\nwatch?v=WUzBkI-mEJU).\n10. Such a claim was made in the Ukrainian documentary about the Battle of Kyiv titled \"Black infantry.\nDnieper-Kyiv offensive operation\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUzBkI-mEJU).\n11. The report titled \"Battle for Kyiv--`the Kyiv encirclement' for the government || Anna Kibenyul\" is\navailable on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-GXJAD0SG0.\n12. The clip originates from the Russian TV channel Russia and is titled \"Kiev celebrates the 65th anniver-\nsary of liberation from fascism\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFgch6QMZG0).\n13.
