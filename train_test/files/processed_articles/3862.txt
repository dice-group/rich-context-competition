    "abstract": "Abstract\nPeople with advanced dementia are frequently bed-bound, doubly incontinent and able to speak\nonly a few words. Many reside in care homes and may often have complex needs requiring\nefficient and timely response by knowledgeable and compassionate staff. The aim of this study\nis to improve our understanding of health care professionals' attitudes and knowledge of the\nbarriers to integrated care for people with advanced dementia. In-depth, interactive interviews\nconducted with 14 health care professionals including commissioners, care home managers,\nnurses and health care assistants in the UK. Barriers to care for people with advanced\ndementia are influenced by governmental and societal factors which contribute to challenging\nenvironments in care homes, poor morale amongst care staff and a fragmentation of health and\nsocial care at the end of life. Quality of care for people with dementia as they approach death may\nbe improved by developing collaborative networks to foster improved relationships between\nhealth and social care services.\n",

Currently, 850,000 people in the\nUnited Kingdom are living with dementia, and this figure will rise to over two million by\nUK care homes have dementia or another form of cognitive impairment (Care Quality\nCommission, 2010). Policy documents addressing dementia care are available in the UK\nand other countries including for example, USA and Australia (Ouwens, Wollersheim,\nHermens, Hulscher, & Grol, 2005), but there is little attention to care at the end of life\nPeople at the advanced stages of dementia may become doubly incontinent, unable to\ncommunicate their needs and often have multiple co-morbidities such as diabetes and\nhypertension (Gage et al., 2012). They are at increased risk of hospitalisation, following\nchest and urinary tract infections and frequently experience pain, anxiety and swallowing\nproblems (Vandervoort et al., 2013). Despite these complex needs, people with advanced\ndementia often receive fragmented and suboptimal care at the end of life (Gage et al., 2012;\nGoddard, Stewart, Thompson, & Hall, 2013), and anticipation of future needs or care\nplanning does not occur routinely. The recent White paper on the provision of optimal\nend of life care for people with dementia suggests that care for those approaching death\nshould be provided by a multidisciplinary team (van der Steen et al., 2014).\nIntegrated care involves excellent communication between services, information sharing\nacross disciplines and proactive anticipatory care, in particular management of symptoms\nand has been suggested to improve care outcomes (Wolfs et al., 2011). Integrated care\nmodels demonstrate improvement to both quality of care for those with chronic\nconditions (Ouwens et al., 2005) and quality of life of those at the early stages of\ndementia (Wolfs, Kessels, Dirksen, Severens, & Verhey, 2008). Importantly, people with\nadvanced dementia should also have access to palliative care services (Lloyd-Williams,\nAbba, & Crowther, 2014), although research suggests that current palliative care teams\nmay not be prepared for communication and behavioural problems presented by people with\nadvanced dementia (Kupeli et al., 2016).\nIn the UK, the majority (53%) of those with dementia died in a long-term care institution\nin 2010 (Sleeman, Ho, Verne, Gao, & Higginson, 2014). In the UK, the National Health\nService (NHS) allocates health and social care funding through local Clinical\nCommissioning Groups (CCGs). Clinical commissioners within CCGs are responsible for\ncommissioning services that are lacking in their locality. Care homes are regulated by the\nCare Quality Commission (CQC), which is an independent organisation responsible for\nregulating and monitoring health and social care service providers to ensure the provision\nof care is safe, effective and of a high quality. The CQC are also responsible for ensuring that\nsafeguarding procedures are adhered to by care homes. Safeguarding guidelines have been\ndeveloped to ensure that vulnerable individuals are protected from harm and neglect.\nHowever, care homes struggle to meet the needs of those who are approaching the end of\nlife (Davies et al., 2014; Goddard et al., 2013). It has been suggested that palliative services\nare fragmented (Davies et al., 2014) and care homes are isolated within the wider network of\nservices (Seymour, Kumar, & Froggatt, 2011). These issues are complicated by frequent\nreports that care home staff may have little skill in recognising when death is approaching\nand poor knowledge of medications commonly used to manage likely symptoms (Watson,\nHockley, & Dewar, 2006). None of these studies, however, examine the issue of integrated\npalliative care within the care home setting from the perspective of those working both in\ncare homes and provide support from external services.\nAims\nWe aimed to identify the barriers to providing integrated care as understood by care\nprofessionals working with people with advanced dementia residing in care homes (all\nwith some nursing beds). The work formed part of a larger national mixed methods\nprogramme to develop a complex intervention to improve end of life care for people with\nadvanced dementia, as well as support those close to them.\nMethods\nRecruitment\nWe used purposive sampling to recruit Health Care Professionals (HCPs) across a range of\norganisations providing care for people with dementia. To gain a thorough and detailed\nunderstanding of HCPs experiences of providing care, we used a realist approach and in-\ndepth interactive interviews (Pawson & Tilley, 1997). We interviewed a range of HCPs\nworking for various organisations across North and South London including care homes and\nNHS services such as memory clinics, mental health and commissioning services. Interactive\ninterviews enabled the interviewer and respondent to engage in a creative discussion without the\nrestrictive parameters imposed by tightly structured interview schedules (Pawson & Tilley,\n1997). Potential respondents were identified by research staff recruiting residents from care\nhomes to a parallel cohort study (Sampson et al., 2016) and through the research team's\nknowledge of other relevant HCPs. All respondents were sent a study information sheet and\na reply slip to return to the researcher within two weeks. Those who returned the reply slip\nindicating their interest were contacted by research staff and appointments were made for\ninterviews to take place at a location of the respondent's choice, which for the majority of\nHCPs was at their place of employment. Consent forms were completed on the day of the\ninterview after any questions had been answered. Ethical approval was granted by the\nData collection\nOur preliminary topic guide was informed by emergent findings from a rapid literature\nreview, workshops with health and social care professionals, carers and people with early\ndementia, and by information from an ongoing cohort study within the research programme\n(Sampson et al., 2016). We sought to explore service personnel's recognition of dementia as a\nlife-limiting illness, the management of acute medical problems, appropriateness of\nhospitalisation, the role of advance care plans and do not attempt resuscitation orders\nand HCPs views of where the health and social care system is failing to meet the needs of\npeople with advanced dementia and their families. The researchers used emerging\ninformation to explore significant and unanticipated issues in later interviews.\nData analysis\nAll interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and entered onto a qualitative software programme\n(Atlas-ti) for coding, management and retrieval of data. To ensure accuracy, two researchers\nchecked the transcripts with the audio recordings. Transcripts were initially read several times to\nachieve familiarisation with the data. We analysed and coded the transcripts using thematic\nanalysis as described by Braun and Clarke (2006). Units of text were broken down into\ncategories to develop appropriate codes which were then grouped together to form themes.\nWe used an iterative process to ensure that each unit of text was assigned to the correct\ncode(s) and theme(s) as new categories emerged. For rigour and transparency, we used\nmemos and reflective diaries. A third researcher reviewed three randomly selected interviews,\nand any differences in the coding framework were resolved through discussion. Minor\ngrammatical errors in quotes have been corrected to facilitate comprehension.\nFindings\nDescription of respondents\nthree health-care assistants, one nurse, one clinical nurse manager, one clinical manager\n(manages a memory clinic service in an NHS-based organisation), two care home managers,\none admiral nurse lead (specialist dementia nurse), one mental health nurse, one specialist mental\nhealth nurse and one occupational therapist. Two commissioners responsible for older adult\nservices within a CCG were interviewed. While the range of experience and length of time in\ntheir current role (11 months to 14 years) was variable, all of the respondents were experienced in\nthe health and social care sector. Interviews lasted approximately an hour.\nBarriers to integrated care\nThe data revealed three main themes consisting of several sub-themes; (1) social and economic\nsystem, (2) care home organisational issues and (3) a fragmented approach to care. A top-down\nhierarchical structure of how societal attitudes and the governmental system can influence\nthe organisation within care homes and a fragmented approach to care is illustrated in Figure 1.\nThe care home setting and fragmented approach to care also interact reducing the capacity of\nthe care system to meet the end of life care needs of those with advanced dementia.\nTheme 1: Social and economic system. The first theme is societal attitudes of older people and\nhow the state develops services and implements policies related to the provision of care for\npeople with dementia. Our data revealed that collectively as a society, we place less value on\nolder people than on younger people, especially those nearing the end of life.\nThat would be like shoving me in a home when I get older and they've got me listening to dance\nmusic all the time. It's homogenous kind of 'one size fits all'. . . There was something like the\nKing's report last year that said in society we're all so focused about the under threes and\nchildren, and actually the most vulnerable members in our society are older people, over the\nage of whatever it was. And I thought, 'Yeah, they are, because they just don't have a voice'\n(Specialist Mental Health Professional).\nThe commissioners were focused on issues related to the early stages of dementia rather\nthan care in the later higher dependency stages of dementia.\nSo we have a number of dementia projects, business cases . . . for example to enhance the memory\nassessment service, and improve our early intervention and diagnosis . . . I think what we're\n\u00b7 Conflicve relaonships\nbetween disciplines & sengs\n\u00b7 Lengthy referral processes\n\u00b7 Minimal care planning\n\u00b7 Poor communicaon\n\u00b7 Diffuse responsibility\nTheme 3: Fragmented\napproach to care\n\u00b7 Care home layout\n\u00b7 High turnover\n\u00b7 Low skill base\n\u00b7 Role burden\n\u00b7 Low salary\n\u00b7 Job dissasfacon\nTheme 2: Care home\norganisaonal issues\n\u00b7 Societal atudes towards older people\n\u00b7 Government policy\n\u00b7 Regulaons promong minimal care\n\u00b7 Business model of care\nTheme 1: Social and\neconomic system\nFigure 1. Barriers to integrated care for people with advanced dementia residing in care homes.\nenvisioning is some services will be key services . . . like the day service for people with\ndementia . . . a reading group (Commissioner for Older Adults Services).\nThere was consensus that UK Government strategy contributes to fragmented care.\nLimited funding and health and social care system reorganisation have been implemented\nto reduce costs, hence reducing the financial resources available for timely and coordinated\ncare.\n``I think now it's a big focus because of the viewing pathways, and looking at cost savings,\nand efficiencies,. . . it's financial priorities that we are expected to deliver on a big financial\nstrategy'' (Commissioner for Older Adults Services).\nThe data highlight a general concern by professionals that care homes are overly\ninfluenced by a business model of care, driven by profit rather than optimal care. Care\nhomes can work around equivocal regulations such as the Health and Social Care Act\n2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2010 by assigning nurses to provide assistance to\nhealth-care assistants when staffing levels are at minimal levels.\nBy law it should be five to one [ratio of care staff to residents]. So the extra five, I chipped in most\ntimes to assist. And I work on the floor . . . [Why do you think you're understaffed at the moment?]\nFrom my experience - its right across the whole country, you never get enough staff in. It's only,\noccasionally you might have three carers to support you, but most of the time, the shortness of\nthe adequate personnel is a crisis . . . Well, I do believe that one of the reasons is cost\neffectiveness. Not cost effectiveness - it's got to do with finance. Not finance in the sense that,\nit's [care homes] a profit making organisation, that doesn't make it easy. And the less staff you\nget to carry out the task, the more profit you make (Mental Health Nurse).\nTheme 2: Care home organisational issues. The physical layout of the care home may hinder the\nprovision of good quality care. Many care homes are arranged so that people with different\nlevels of need are housed on different floors of the building. Staff are required to work across\nthese settings and the focus of their tasks may vary. Having staff consistently assigned to one\nfloor was seen as promoting continuous care both to people with dementia and their families\nand enabled professional carers to adopt a more personalised approach.\nI don't know how confident the care home staff would have been to do it [make referrals] and\nalso they changed on a daily basis, that was the biggest,. . . not the staff in the home but the floor\nthat they worked on, yeah. So like you'd go do a ward round with (Doctor) and you'd sit\nthere and you'd say `so how's blah, blah been this week?' and they'll say `well I worked\ndownstairs for the last five days then I had two days off' and it would be like well what,\nyou know we did say `please can you try and keep the same staff on the same floors' and\nthen you'd have RMN's (Registered Mental Nurse) that worked on the middle floor which\nwas more sort of general nursing and you would have an RGN (Registered General Nurse) on\nthe bottom floor which was more psychiatric. There didn't seem to be any consistency to be\nhonest (Clinical Manager).\nA strongly held view was that care homes were ill-equipped to provide adequate end of\nlife care for residents with dementia. Due to the profit-driven nature of care homes,\nrespondents reported that staffing levels were poor, and staff turnover was high due to\nlimited professional development opportunities, demanding workloads, low pay and low\njob satisfaction resulting in high levels of role burden. Low availability of both trained\nand untrained staff resulted in demanding and stressful workloads forcing many staff to\naccept multiple responsibilities.\nThe workload also is extremely high for a nurse, for example the average amount of medications\nthat a care home resident might be on may be 10, and that's three times a day, they have to be\ngiven it at a certain time, the GP's coming, the social worker's doing a review, there's a new\nadmission, there's a transfer, there's a death, multiple, multiple things are happening at the same\ntime that the nurse has to literally split herself in a hundred (Care Home Manager).\nThe less staff you get to carry out the task, the more profit you make . . . you get disgruntled.\nWhy should I stretch myself etc . . . not that you don't to want stretch yourself, but the impact of\nworking endlessly has got a detrimental effect on your morale, output (Mental Health Nurse).\nCare home staff were anxious about increasing governance and scrutiny that did not\nappear to take account of general working conditions, poor resources, challenging\nworkload and the emotional demand of coping in these settings. Under the Department\nof Health's Care Act 2014, safeguarding requires local authorities to make enquiries if abuse\nor neglect is suspected. Some staff felt that enquiries were sometimes made into issues that\nwere not related to neglect and that the process of being investigated impacted on morale\nand created a sense of distrust.\nEverything's a safeguarding now, the bar is raised very, very high and we don't see it as a\nnegative, it is stressful when it happens in your home because you own your home and its,\nyou think it's a reflection on your home, and I think, I think the reason why it's so stressful is\nthat the social services raise safeguarding and then investigate . . . it's not safeguarding if they\ndidn't change me within 5 or 10 minutes; it's not a safeguarding. These are issues that we learn\nfrom. But already the flags are there, CQC (Care Quality Commission) is notified, and\neverything, everybody's aware, and it just has a negative impact on the care in itself . . . It does\nhave an impact. It does have an impact on morale (Care Home Manager).\nRespondents reported that the commercial priorities of care homes negatively influenced\nstaff career development leaving a considerable gap in training opportunities. These included\ntraining sessions on dementia, documentation completion, compassionate care and pain\nrecognition. However, high staff turnover was a major obstacle to training. Conversely,\nlack of training may contribute to turnover.\n[if I could ask you to name a couple of top priorities that you think will improve care for this very\nvulnerable group of patients, particularly those approaching the end of their life, what do you think\nyou'd say?] Staff - really well trained staff. Really well trained staff. Of all the stuff that you've\nsaid, I think that well, well trained staff (Specialist Mental Health Professional).\nThere's such a high turnover of staff at that level [care homes], as you probably know. We have\nto do it [training] regularly, but we have to do some kind of toolkit which is really train the trainer\nwith the toolkit, champions \u00ad it is a real challenge (Commissioner for Older Adults Services).\nRespondents described how a low-skilled workforce hampered the potential of care home\nstaff to deliver high-quality care resulting in poor symptom recognition and management.\nCare home staff argued that they were not provided with the training or support from\nexternal service providers to recognise and respond to symptoms presented by people with\nadvanced dementia as they approached the end of life.\nWhen someone says, `Oh, no, she's not in pain,' oh please - the nurses - `What do you mean she's\nnot in pain?' They need to be more educated with dementia, because they can't cope. There's\ncertain people that can cope with dementia, and a lot of people can't cope with dementia. A lot\nof people do not like working with them, because they can't cope with them. They don't know\nhow to respond to them (Health Care Assistant).\nSome senior care home staff expressed frustration in the lack of motivation of team\nmembers and reported a poor uptake of recommendations by other staff. These opinions\nhighlight the low skill base of care home staff, which appears to limit professionalism in role\nperformance leading to problems within teams.\nSome people will put some things in place but won't think about everything else and its sort of\nleft to me to do all the referrals and everything else. I'll say have you done this, have you done\nthat, have you done this, have you done that? (Care Home Manager)\nIt was suggested that care home staff appear demotivated in providing residents with\nanything more than basic care tasks, and consequently are perhaps unable to provide a\nmore personalised and compassionate approach to residents dying with dementia.\n``This is what I'm saying about carers in general, they won't motivate their brain. They will do, they\nwill wash, they will clean, they will feed, but not anything in between'' (Heath Care Assistant).\nTheme 3: Fragmented approach to care. Various thematic issues reflected fragmented\ncare resulting from problematic relationships between care home staff and external HCPs.\nCare home staff contended that their knowledge and experience of caring for residents were\nunder-recognised or devalued by other HCPs. Such issues deepen the apparent lack of trust\nbetween care home staff and service providers external to the care home.\nShe's developed, rapidly developing grade four pressure sores everywhere, we've done safe\nguarding and everything else, she's not on any analgesic but if you ask her she says she's not\nin pain. So did a pain assessment day before, did one again yesterday and our GP was on holiday\nuntil today so trying to speak to another GP its sort of, `I want something for pain relief but she\nwon't take anything orally because she's refusing all medication', `well if she says not in pain\nfrom your pain assessment then I can't prescribe something', `yes but looking at her, she is in\npain but she's one of these people that sort of keeps quiet', so it's more about, I suppose people\ntrusting you (Care Home Manager).\nThe processes implemented by care providers external to the care home, for example,\nlengthy referral processes and lack of advance care planning within primary and secondary\ncare also resulted in uncoordinated and fragmented care.\n[is it easy to get other HCP in when needed?] It's not very easy . . . the social worker is okay,\nbecause you have the contact number and you can contact them but if you need the OT\n[Occupational Therapist] or physio or dietician or any other specialist who come from\n(Borough of London) reach you just fax over the referral but sometimes they can be very\nlong because they have a long waiting list . . . And sometimes you need to re fax it to remind\nthem because our report is getting through but they still do not get in contact with us. Sometimes\ntwo weeks pass and still nothing . . . (Nurse).\nInformation sharing was described as at its weakest when people with dementia were\ntransferred between services, such as to hospital. In the quote below, a clinical manager\nlaments the poor communication and the ill-defined responsibility when a patient is\ntransferred to a care home from a psychiatric ward.\nThere's absolutely zero information about the history and even the GP doesn't have it either,\nyou know, which I think is terrible. Yeah . . . Just crap communication yeah. And it's up to the\nward to ensure that information is, or although maybe it's up to the placement officer, whoever\ndecides on placing them to get that information but they've probably not got it either (Clinical\nManager).\nCare home staff described how hospital staff did not understand the nature and challenges\nthat are faced by care homes. In the following quote, a care home manager points to ethical\nand procedural differences between residential care and hospital care, suggesting that\nresidential care is negatively vilified. Again, such feelings are likely to result in further\ndemoralisation in this sector and reduce integration of care.\nWhen they go to the hospital from here, they always have a UTI, they're always dehydrated, they\nhave faecal impaction . . . And it's ALWAYS, look that's what's happened, dehydrated. But none\nof this is true. What they [hospital staff] don't understand is that we don't force care here on\nanyone, for any reason whatsoever. We don't restrain, we don't restrain physically, chemically,\nwe don't put people in recliners that they can't get up out of, that's a restraint, we don't open\npeople's mouths and give medication if they're spitting it out, we don't put fluids in people's\nmouths if they don't want to drink, the same thing with food, ok, and we have a balance that we,\nthis is one of the stresses of the job in that when we admit somebody, and decide that we're going\nto care for that person, we have a duty of care. We also on the other hand have to balance that\nwith the person's right to refuse . . . and I think, not just the hospital but I believe, social workers\nneed to come in to care homes and I think they need to see for themselves what happens in care\nhomes (Care Home Manager).\nNHS-based services such as hospitals were described as having access to specialist\nresources and working in multidisciplinary teams in comparison to care home staff who\nwork independently of other service providers.\n``they [care home staff] work independently whereas in the hospital, if there's a problem, call the\ndoctor, call the physio'' (Care Home Manager).\nHCPs reported that they worked in silos, which hindered the development of an\nintegrated care approach.\nI still think there is, you know, they [HCPs] do work really well, but they do tend to work in\nsilos, everybody still does work in silos. And it does need to be a bit more integrated. So\nintegrated in terms of providers, and integrated across the pathway (Commissioner for Older\nAdults Services).\nThere was an element of diffused responsibility amongst providers of care for those with\nadvanced dementia. Each expert is expected to provide care when their specialist advice is\nsought but a single health-care provider rarely takes overall responsibility for the health and\nwell-being of those living in care homes.\nWe've got a single point of contact in this area so we'd refer via the single point of contact. For\ndieticians, and speech and language therapy we've got a form we fax off to the department. For\npalliative care we have to go through the GP and for podiatry we have to go through the GP\n(Care Home Manager).\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the barriers to providing integrated care\nto those with advanced dementia in care homes incorporating both HCPs working within\nand external to care homes. Given the growing population of people with dementia (Prince,\net al., 2015) and that the majority of people with advanced dementia die in long-term care\ninstitutions (Sleeman et al., 2014), understanding and addressing the barriers to providing\nintegrated care are critical. Our data suggest that three main factors hinder the development\nof an integrated approach to palliative care for those with advanced dementia: societal\nattitudes and governmental policy, the care home organisation and a fragmented\napproach to care. Within a youth-focused society, services for older people are given less\nemphasis and dementia care policy initiatives focus on assessment and the earlier phases of\ndementia.\nCare home staff experience high role burden associated with demanding working\nconditions, very low pay and limited professional development opportunities. Our findings\nillustrate poor communication and conflictive relationships between HCPs and service\nsettings, poor symptom management, lengthy referral processes, inter-agency ignorance,\ndiffused responsibility amongst care providers and minimal care planning. These factors\nresult in a fragmented rather than integrated approach to care.\nSome of these findings are not unique to our study. Previous research highlights that\ntensions arise when other HCPs do not recognise that care home staff are familiar with their\nresidents (Gage et al., 2012) and found disagreements regarding service responsibility (Jha,\n2008). Limited professional development opportunities and low pay for formal carers in this\nsector are prevalent in countries other than the UK (Forbes & Neufeld, 2008). However,\ncomparative work suggested that whilst health and social care services in the UK presented\npoor integration, care providers in the Netherlands functioned within collaborative networks\n(Kumpers, Mur, Hardy, van Raak, & Maarse, 2006). In addition, nursing homes in the UK\nhave adopted a social care approach, whilst the Netherlands draws from a medical care\nmodel, thus enabling continuous access to doctors and other medical expert care for people\nwith advanced dementia (Kumpers, Mur, Maarse, & van Raak, 2005) albeit at the cost of\nsocial needs.\nThe crucial need for integrated care, especially for those with advanced dementia has been\nhighlighted by researchers in the US (Shega et al., 2003). Provision of proactive and\nintegrated palliative care for people living with dementia in the community resulted in the\nrapid detection and management of symptoms and an increase in hospice referrals (Shega\net al., 2003). Similarly, multidisciplinary teams caring for those with dementia score higher\non quality indicators such as assessment and care planning, integration and provision of\nspecialist care when compared with single health or social disciplines. However, the level of\nintegration was not consistent across all multidisciplinary teams (Abendstern, Reilly,\nHughes, Venables, & Challis, 2006) suggesting that coordinated care depends on\nindividual teams at local levels. Similarly, UK studies indicate that collaboration at a\nlocal level is patchy and vulnerable to breakdown due to high staff turnover (Dening,\nGreenish, Jones, Mandal, & Sampson, 2012; Gage et al., 2012). While specialist palliative\ncare from hospices could provide support to care homes, research shows these services may\nonly be used in response to crises rather than as part of advance planning (Froggatt, Poole,\nBusiness-driven care homes foster a culture of minimalistic provision of care aimed at\nmeeting basic needs but neglecting, for example social interaction and emotional and\nspiritual support. A recent review found that these areas are just as important as ensuring\nthat the physical needs of those at the end of life are fulfilled (Perrar, Schmidt, Eisenmann,\nLack of professional development opportunities for care home staff also contributes to the\ncycle of poor provision of fragmented care. A recent review highlighted that providing\nstructured training programmes to formal carers working in care homes can improve\nbehavioural problems presented by people with dementia and reduce the use of antipsychotic\nmedication (Fossey et al., 2014). Integration of care should be available continuously\nthroughout the disease and not just at the diagnostic stage (Bullock, Iliffe, & Passmore,\nStrengths and limitations\nOur study has a number of strengths including the recruitment of commissioners and HCPs\nfrom a variety of services, the collection of rich data from in-depth interactive interviews and\nthe use of triangulation and consensus meetings to verify the credibility of the data. Our\nrealist approach to developing the topic guide informed by our findings from the other\ncomponents of the programme ensured that the interviews addressed issues that were\nemerging directly from our work with services.\nAlthough the study did not aim to be representative of all HCPs, data were collected from\nHCPs working in care homes and those providing care to care homes in the South East of\nEngland. However, these attitudes may not be applicable to other HCPs such as general\npractitioners and allied health professionals and those working in other areas of the UK or\nin other countries. Finally, an integrated approach to providing end of life care for people\nwith advanced dementia requires collaboration between care providers and family carers.\nAlthough it is a limitation that we have not included family carers perspectives, we did seek\ntheir views on this topic and hope to publish these findings separately.\nImplications\nOur findings have implications for research, policy and practice. They support two of the top\n10 research priorities for care at the end of life identified by the Palliative and end of life care\nPriority Setting Partnership (PeolcPSP) (2015) which worked in consultation with people\nwith dementia, their family carers and HCPs providing care for those with palliative care\nneeds. This report stresses the need for training to be provided to HCPs delivering palliative\ncare and research to develop a continuous model of care.\nWe suggest that integration of care would be developed by modifying structural factors\nand the network of services that currently function as separate entities when providing care\nfor people with dementia. The Better Care Fund (National Health Service (NHS) England,\n2013) proposed by the UK Government could help reduce the fragmentation in the\nprovision of good end of life care for those with dementia, for example, by developing\nnetworks and shared referral pathways to foster improved relationships between health\nand social care providers.\nOur finding that care homes operate on minimal staffing levels is not surprising as the\nHealth and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2010 is open to\ninterpretation stating that care services must employ ``sufficient numbers of suitably\nqualified, skilled and experienced persons.'' This should be replaced with definitive\nrecommendations on the optimal ratio of HCPs to residents in care homes to ensure good\ncare. In addition, good practice could be incentivised by rewarding care homes who adhere\nto such recommendations as part of standard practice.\nConclusion\nCare of people with dementia who are approaching death may be enabled by an integrated\napproach that includes improving the communication and relationships between all care\nproviders and creating multidisciplinary teams who draw on each other's knowledge to\nprovide optimal care. For this, a top-down approach from policy makers is required so that\nthe funding and resources are available to develop leaders in this field who will motivate all\ncare providers to work together at local level. Successful development of an integrated model\ncould result in an environment and culture where older people are more valued and cared for\nby a proactive, collaborative team of experts who provide health and social care.\n"
