Physicians play an important\nrole in cancer prevention by counseling patients on modifi-\nable lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking cessation to reduce\nthe risk of lung cancer. However, sun-protection counseling\nranks among the lowest topics of primary prevention dis-\ncussed between physicians and patients.4,5\nAcknowledging the importance of sun-protective behav-\niors in the prevention of skin cancer, multiple professional or-\nganizations, such as the American Academy of Dermatology,\nNational Institutes of Health, American Cancer Society, Ameri-\ncan Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Gynecolo-\ngists, and American Academy of Family Physicians, recom-\nmend physicians provide patient counseling regarding sun\nexposure and sun-protective behaviors.6-11 The US Preventa-\ntiveServicesTaskForceconcludedin2012thattherewas\"mod-\nerate certainty of moderate benefit\" from recommending pa-\ntient counseling on sun protection for fair-skinned patients\naged 10 to 24 years and that there was insufficient evidence\nto recommend for or against sun-protection counseling in pa-\nMajor recommendations for sun-protective behaviors are\nsimilar among different health care organizations.

Physicians mentioned sunscreen at\napproximately 12.83 million visits (0.07%). Mention of sunscreen was reported by physicians\nat 0.9% of patient visits associated with a diagnosis of skin disease. Dermatologists recorded\nthe mention of sunscreen the most (86.4% of all visits associated with sunscreen). However,\ndermatologists reported mentioning sunscreen at only 1.6% of all dermatology visits.\nSunscreen was mentioned most frequently to white patients, particularly those in their eighth\ndecade of life, and least frequently to children. Actinic keratosis was the most common\ndiagnosis associated with sunscreen recommendation.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite encouragement to provide patient education\nregarding sunscreen use and sun-protective behaviors, the rate at which physicians are\nmentioning sunscreen at patient visits is quite low, even for patients with a history of skin\ncancer. The high incidence and morbidity of skin cancer can be greatly reduced with the\nimplementation of sun-protective behaviors, which patients should be counseled about at\noutpatient visits.\nAuthor Affiliations: Center for\nDermatology Research, Department\nof Dermatology, Wake Forest School\nof Medicine, Winston-Salem, North\nCarolina (Akamine, Gustafson, Davis,\nLevender, Feldman); Departments of\nPathology and Public Health\nSciences, Wake Forest School of\nMedicine, Winston-Salem, North\nCarolina (Feldman).\nCorresponding Author: Scott A.\nDavis, MA, Department of\nDermatology, Wake Forest School of\nMedicine, Medical Center Blvd,\n@wakehealth.edu).\nResearch\nOriginal Investigation\n \nDownloaded From: http://archderm.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc.

Therefore, sunscreen is an\nimportant component of sun protection, as it prevents epider-\nmal and dermal damage secondary to UV radiation exposure.\nAs a result, sunscreen decreases the incidence of actinic kera-\ntoses, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanoma skin\ncancers.14-17 In addition, sunscreen is recommended for a di-\nversity of photosensitive skin conditions, such as actinic der-\nmatitis, melasma, porphyria cutanea tarda, polymorphic light\neruption, actinic prurigo, lupus erythematosus, and drug-\ninduced photosensitivity as seen with acne medications.18-20\nAlthough physicians are encouraged to counsel patients on\nsunscreen use, no studies in the medical literature, to our\nknowledge, report how often US physicians are recommend-\ning sunscreen. Therefore, the primary objective of this study\nwas to assess trends in sunscreen recommendations by dif-\nferent physician specialties to determine whether physicians\nare recommending sunscreen as their respective organiza-\ntions advocate. Also, patient education alters patient prac-\ntices; however, physicians often reserve such counseling for\ncertain subsets of patients. Hence, data regarding physician di-\nagnoses and patient demographics were evaluated to deter-\nmine which subsets of patients were most likely to receive sun-\nscreen recommendations.\nMethods\nDatawereobtainedfromtheNationalAmbulatoryMedicalCare\nSurvey (NAMCS), which is an ongoing survey conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics. The survey was started\ncollects descriptive data regarding ambulatory visits to non-\nfederal, office-based physicians in the United States. Sam-\npling is stratified by sampling units (county, contiguous coun-\nties, and standard metropolitan areas), physician practices\nwithin the sampling units, and patient visits within the prac-\ntice occurring within 52 weekly periods. Participating physi-\ncians are instructed to record information about patient vis-\nits for a 1-week period and include patient demographics,\ninsurancestatus,reasonforvisit,diagnoses,procedures,thera-\npeutics, and referrals made at that time. Data collected for the\nNAMCSareenteredintoamultistageprobabilitysampletopro-\nduce national estimates.\nIn the present study, the NAMCS database was queried to\nidentify patient visits between January 1, 1989, and Decem-\nmedication or over-the-counter product is recorded for a\nNAMCS patient visit, it indicates the product was currently\nbeing used by the patient, was dispensed in the office, or was\nprescribed or recommended by the physician at that particu-\nlar visit. After these visits were identified, data regarding pa-\ntient demographics, physician specialty, and physician diag-\nnoses were assessed. In addition, we looked at patient visits\nassociated with a diagnosis of skin disease (as previously de-\nfined by Fleischer et al21) and, more specifically, a history of\nskin cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-\n232.x). These visits were further characterized as visits to der-\nmatologists, internists, pediatricians, general or family phy-\nsicians, and other specialists. The top 10 diagnoses associ-\nated with the highest frequencies of sunscreen use by each\nspecialty were determined. Linear regressions were per-\nformed to determine trends in use during this period. All data\nwereanalyzedusingSASstatisticalsoftware(SASInstituteInc).\nThe study was declared exempt by the Wake Forest Univer-\nsity Health Sciences institutional review board.\nResults\nan estimated 18.30 billion patient visits; of those, sunscreen\ndifferences in sunscreen recommendation were detected with\nrespect to patient sex or ethnicity (Table 1). With regard to pa-\ntient race, sunscreen was recommended in 237 visits annu-\nally for every 100 000 visits by white US residents compared\nviduals. With data stratified by age groups of 10-year inter-\nvals,sunscreenwasrecommendedthemostforpatientsintheir\neighth decade of life (21.8% of visits associated with sun-\nscreen recommendation). In contrast, sunscreen was recom-\nmended the least for children younger than 10 years.\nThefrequencyofsunscreenrecommendationwas12times\ngreater for patient visits associated with a diagnosis of skin dis-\nease compared with visits with no reported skin disease. Al-\nthough sunscreen use was mentioned more frequently to pa-\ntients with skin disease, such recommendations were made\nat less than 1% of visits involving patients with a reported skin\ndisease diagnosis. There were no statistically significant dif-\nferences in sunscreen mention among different races in pa-\ntients with skin disease. However, sunscreen use was recom-\nmended more frequently for Hispanic compared with non-\nAnalysis by physician specialty revealed that dermatology\nvisits accounted for most of the appointments associated with\nsunscreen recommendation (86.4%), followed by visits with\ngeneral and family practitioners (9.6%), pediatricians (1.4%),\nother specialists (1.4%), and internists (1.1%). Although sun-\nscreen was most frequently recommended by dermatologists,\nthe mention of sunscreen was recorded at 1.6% of all dermatol-\nogy visits (Table 2).

The\ntop 10 list of diagnoses associated with sunscreen recommen-\ndation was similar among all specialists.\nDiscussion\nAlthough multiple professional health care organizations\nhighly recommend that physicians educate patients on sun-\nprotective behaviors, including proper sunscreen use, NAMCS\ndata indicate that physicians are mentioning sunscreen at a\nvery low percentage of all patient visits. Compared with black\npatients, white patients were 9 times more likely to be recom-\nmended sunscreen. Children and adolescents were recom-\nmended sunscreen the least compared with all patient age\ngroups. Likewise, sunscreen was mentioned at a low number\nof pediatric visits. Patients aged 70 to 79 years were recom-\nmended sunscreen the most frequently compared with other\nage groups, likely resulting from the tendency of this patient\npopulation to have visible solar damage and/or actinic kera-\ntoses appreciated on physical examination.\nThe findings are concerning because children and adoles-\ncents get the most sun exposure of any age group, as they tend\nto spend much of their time playing outdoors. Up to 80% of\nsun damage is thought to occur before age 21 years, and sun-\nburns in childhood greatly increase the risk for future\nmelanoma.1,22,23 The American Academy of Pediatrics recog-\nnizes the primary role pediatricians have in preventing skin\ncancer.Newguidelinesadvisepediatricianstodiscusssunpro-\ntection at least yearly during health maintenance examina-\ntionsandtofamiliarizethemselveswithmedicationswithpho-\ntosensitizing effects.10 The American Academy of Pediatrics\nalso recommends assuring parents of the low likelihood of de-\nveloping vitamin D deficiency in association with sunscreen\nFigure.
