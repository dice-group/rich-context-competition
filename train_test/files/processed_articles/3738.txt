It is based on a larger\nresearch project undertaken in Papua New Guinea (PNG),\nKomuniti Tok Piksa (KTP), which sought to explore the use\nof visual and creative methodologies in HIV prevention. The\nresearch was guided by an indigenous (Melanesian) approach\nand developed HIV prevention material by exploring and\ncapturing local narratives. This article focuses on one key\npart of the project responding to the question on how local\nnarratives and indigenous knowledge can be incorporated\nmost significantly in researching and designing strategies for\nsocial issues in a specific socio-cultural context.\nKTP put emphasis on building relationships and entering\nreciprocal spaces of exchange between researchers and\nresearch participants. Approaches and frameworks were\nnegotiated, developed, and re-configured by the various\ngroups and communities involved. This moves the focus of\ndiscussion to the relational accountability of the researcher\nand his or her ability to negotiate a space where various lev-\nels of participation emerge. Relational accountability\nbecomes thus an indicator for ethical research practice.\nThe results of the KTP project, some of which are the cre-\native products of the groups such as films, were diverse and\npolymorphous. As these products continue to be presented\nto audiences, they open up and continue a dialogue among\ncommunity members and researchers and among communi-\nties themselves. The KTP project has been considered a suc-\ncessful project by funders, communities, and wider audiences\ndue to the high identification level and community owner-\nship that was maintained throughout the creative production\nprocess from conceptualization to production, postproduc-\ntion, and distribution (Thomas et al., 2012).\nThe case study discussed in this article demonstrates the\nuse of an indigenous approach to visual research in develop-\ning communication for social change research strategies.\nAlthough the study can be situated within the wider field of\nhealth communication and approaches such as community-\nbased participatory research (CBPR; Blumenthal, 2011;\nRhodes et al., 2012), the focus of this article is on exploring\nthe way participatory action research (PAR) and visual\nresearch interact within an indigenous research approach.\nThe active engagement of community members in becoming\nactive researchers on the project is assessed within the facili-\ntation of media technologies that are being used as tools for\nself-reflection and self-representation.

Within\nand through these media, the relationship between facilitator\nand researcher and the various levels of \"research data\" that\nemerge are captured allowing us to consider how local narra-\ntives and indigenous knowledge can be incorporated in\nresearching and designing strategies for HIV prevention in a\nspecific socio-cultural context. By involving indigenous\nways of \"seeing\" and \"doing\" throughout the research pro-\ncess, this article presents an innovative framework for under-\ntaking participatory communication research.\nTo contextualize the approach within the issues under\nexamination, the article first provides a brief background to\nHIV and AIDS communication and presents the challenges\nspecific to PNG. The authors then illustrate the methodologi-\ncal foundation for the study exploring aspects of visual\nresearch and PAR before discussing the relevant components\nof an indigenous research approach focusing on the concept\nof relational accountability. The article argues that closer\nattention must be paid to the relational space that is formed\nbetween researchers and researched to create impactful pro-\ngrams and for researchers and project implementers to be\naccountable for their actions while undertaking participatory\ncommunication projects.\nHIV and AIDS Communication\nHIV andAIDS remains a complex social issue in which a vari-\nety of communication concepts have been explored over recent\nyears. Success stories in slowing down the spread of HIV and\nAIDS demonstrate that locally and regionally specific commu-\nnication approaches are required. Participatory communication\nbecomes important as it is recognized that communication\nmust move beyond awareness. As argued by Rico Lie (2008),\n\"awareness does not automatically lead to change\" (p. 293).\nThis is supported more generally by Gumucio-Dagron (2003):\nInformation alone does not generate changes, whereas\ncommunication--which implies participation, sharing of\nknowledge in a horizontal way, and respect for diversity and\nculture--is key to social change. (p. 3)\nHIV and AIDS is a very personal and emotional issue.\nAttitudes and behaviors are embedded in social and cultural\nnorms and are based on the situation of individuals.\nBehavioral patterns do not necessarily follow rational deci-\nsion-making processes and are therefore hard to guide and\nimpact (Airhihenbuwa & Obregon, 2000). These under-\nstandings are addressed in a recognized shift in HIV and\nAIDS communication, which foregrounds the use of local\ncommunity media away from mass media campaigns, sees\nHIV and AIDS as more than just a health issue, and moves\naway from aiming at individual behavioral change to the idea\nIn a country, such as PNG, this shift has began to\nbe addressed; however, specialized and highly contextual\napproaches are required. Earlier programs which focused on\nmass media campaigns might have been counter-productive,\nreinforcing fear about HIV and hence increasing discrimina-\ntion and stigma against those living with HIV (see King &\nLupiwa, 2009). Programs need not only deal with informing\npeople but also with reversing some of the misconception\nthat might have previously been created through more dis-\ntant media approach.\nThe Challenges in PNG\nAccording to the PNG National HIV and AIDS Strategy\nepidemic across regions of the country are not the same. In\ninfections were from the capital Port Moresby and all the\nHighland provinces (NAC, 2010) where this project has been\ntaking place. Despite an improvement in the knowledge of\npatterns of the pandemic, NAC (2010) notes that there is still\na lack of epidemiological and behavioral data to steer the\nnational response, specifically in planning for prevention\ninitiatives.\nThe dynamics of HIV transmission in PNG are influenced by a\ngreat diversity of sexual cultures, with different values, norms,\nbeliefs, and practices. The potential for sexual transmission of\nHIV is heightened by early sexual partnerships, including\npolygamy, extra marital sexual partnerships and inter-\ngenerational sex; the exchange of sex for cash, goods and\nservices; low and inconsistent condom use; high levels of sexual\nviolence and rape; mobility; and the use of penile inserts and\nAwareness campaigns in the country have faced enormous\nchallenges due to these reasons: diversity in cultural and tra-\nditional beliefs and modernization being chief among them.\nA medium that has shown some success comes through the\narts in theater and television drama. People are appreciating\nedutainment (informative and entertaining), because it is\nreaching a largely illiterate population who might not have\nregular access to mass media (Corrigan, 2006). Furthermore,\nif the focus is on socio-cultural change, the intervention has\nto \"focus on what is circulating within the social domain,\nwhat is shared within the community . . . which will not\nchange any individual behaviour directly, but it will address\nthe climate [and] set a frame for discussion\" (Lie, 2008,\nMoving away from mass media campaigns, a couple of\ninitiatives sought to use the arts as a means of both awareness\nand research, an innovating response to HIV. VSO Tokaut\nAIDS Awareness Community Theatre Project is an action\nresearch project that trialed community led theater in rural\nquality of theater defied language barriers as messages\nwere played out to reflect to communities, their realities.\nThomas et al. 3\nSimilarly, the approach of Community Conversations has\nbeen adapted by the national AIDS Council. Dialogues are\nfacilitated within communities to identify the driving\nforces of the epidemic, specific to local settings (Reid,\nThe success of these recent research and awareness initia-\ntives has been in its localized approach, appropriation of\ntechnology, and valuing of community experiences and\nbeliefs as a way of both facilitating the message creation and\ncreation of knowledge among participants. Such approaches\nare reinforced in a literature review (King & Lupiwa, 2009)\nwhich showed that cultural diversities, sensitivities, and fear\nare delaying the success of the national response to HIV and\nKTP: Developing New Approaches of\nWorking With Communities\nKTP springs from the fundamental idea that sustainable\napproaches to slowing the spread of HIV and AIDS need to\nbe developed by communities themselves to be successful.\nThis builds on strategies employed in CBPR and community\nhealth advocacy work acknowledging the need for ethical\nresearch and practice that prioritizes community ownership\nand community empowerment (Blumenthal, 2011; Rasmus,\nthe establishment of relationships between communities,\nfacilitators, and educators to develop sustainable communi-\ncation channels where an ongoing dialogue is facilitated that\nresponds to the specific challenges a community faces. To\nfacilitate this process, KTP developed a creative research\napproach that seeks to involve participants actively in the\ncreation of prevention messages that can be used to educate\nothers in PNG.\nThe KTP baseline study, conducted at the beginning of the\nproject in about 10 Highland communities, revealed a num-\nber of initial results (Thomas et al., 2012). \"Standard\" pre-\nvention messages are often rejected, in particular those\nexplicit about sex or condoms. As a result of earlier mass\nmedia interventions programs that were based on scaring the\npopulation, people's perceptions with the disease are that of\ndeath and as a disease with no cure. HIV is associated with\nprostitution and unfaithful sexual behavior. These factors\nhave resulted in high stigmatization of those who are HIV\npositive. In addition, a large number of people in the\nHighlands have a lack of practical knowledge about the dis-\nease, how to prevent themselves from it, and how to look\nafter those who are HIV positive.\nIn regard to awareness, people commented on the lack of\ninvolvement of those undertaking awareness in the local\ncommunities, pointing at infrequent visits, and lack or lim-\nited engagement and length of stay resulting in forgetting the\nmessage. In this, they demonstrated the missed opportunity\nto build on trust with local community members.\nGiven this feedback, it is relevant to consider the indige-\nnous social and cultural value systems as experienced day-\nto-day in communities. PNG culture can be viewed within\nthe larger region of Melanesia as a region that shares cultural\ncommonalities, political alliances and, despite a large lin-\nguistic diversity, a common language, Melanesian Tok Pisin.\nProminent in previous studies is that Melanesian culture is\nstrongly based on personal relationships, and these relation-\nships are key to any social change processes in the communi-\nties. The focal point of Melanesian societies is the community\nor the clan/wantok. Wantok in Tok Pisin (Melanesian Pidgin)\nmeans literally \"One Talk,\" the ones who speak the same lan-\nguage and, thus, share their same clan, tribe, and culture.\nLoyalty to one's community often takes priority over indi-\nvidual preferences. Through various relationships, the com-\nmunity provides a \"safety net.\" People are taken care of, and\nin turn, they have a series of obligations to the community\nKTP used the Melanesian understandings of relationships\nin its research and community approach. Incorporating these\nmeans grounding the approach in a Melanesian worldview\nand Melanesian community experience (sharing a lived\nexperience). Research processes should focus on these expe-\nriences, representing them in data collection and analysis.\nAbove all, research outcomes must be directed toward com-\nmunity benefit (Vallance, 2007). By putting a Melanesian\nframework as central to our inquiry, we have to put at its\ncentre the community and relationships that emerge through\nengaging in the research process. Careful attention needs to\nbe given to the way relationships are formed and the process\nof exchange the researcher enters. Collaboration between\nresearcher, potentially co-researchers, and research partici-\npants becomes a necessary element. KTP researchers are\nthemselves local or have links to these communities through\ntheir formal and informal networks (wantok system),\nenabling, thus, their entry to the communities and facilitating\ncommunication based on common background.\nKnowledge must be understood in the context of relation-\nships formed to develop a holistic understanding--relation-\nships with people, ancestors, and the environment.\nKnowledge of a community could be regarded as collective\nmemory (Thomas, 2011), common experiences that have\nshaped the community in the past. Being aware of this col-\nlective memory and incorporating it in research might help\nbuild bridges between the community and researchers.\nTo facilitate the entry into communities by the KTP team,\nit was important to enter with no direct agenda in mind and\nbeing open to community (Bishop, 2005). The focus was\nthus tuned into fulfilling a relational accountability to the\nteam and the community (Wilson, 2008) and giving the com-\nmunity a right to be understood (Husband, 1996). In\nMelanesia, this means engaging in reciprocal relationships, a\ngive and take, between the community and the KTP team.\nThere must be an understanding and a will from the commu-\n4 SAGE Open\nnity that a project such as KTP can be beneficial to the com-\nmunity in some way (see Vallance, 2007).\nForming such a basis for the formation of meaningful\nrelationships is essential for HIV and AIDS communication\nand has often been neglected. In most cases, outsiders decide\nwhat information is displayed and what communication\nchannels are used. In PNG, however, there is a need to under-\nstand what communication channels are most appropriate for\nHIV and AIDS communication. Given the strong focus on\nrelationships and community well-being in PNG culture,\nKTP sought to first create a space where these communica-\ntion channels could be explored and opened up.\nVisual Methods: Creating Spaces for\nReflection\nThe use of visual and creative methods with KTP can be cat-\negorized within \"arts-based research\" (Prosser & Loxley,\n2008). Arts-based research methods emphasize the fact that\n. . . people make sense of their lives through the interplay of\nsensory relations not accessible through discourse; words and\nnumbers are mere proxies for their direct experiences. Textbased\napproaches are limited because they fail to move beyond inherent\npsychophysical characteristics to reveal taken-for-granted,\nGiven the linguistic diversity in PNG and a previous focus\non pamphlets and billboards as HIV and AIDS prevention\nstrategies, arts-based methods address emotional and embod-\nied elements of decision-making processes. Visual method-\nologies and arts-based inquiry, hence, focus on creating\ndialogical engagement. Arts-based methods aim at creating\nrelationship and providing an \"arena of exchange\" for par-\nticipants (Bourriaud, 2002, p. 18). Visual experiences, in par-\nticular, form a key component in our daily lives. As\nMacDougall (2006) argues, \"visual knowledge provides one\nof our primary means of comprehending the experience of\nother people\" (p. 5). Visual information stays in our memory\nstronger than textual information does and images connect\nstrongly with our emotional experiences.\nKTP uses a process that strengthens the idea of identifica-\ntion and involves the screening back of material within the\ncommunity. The process of viewing one-self has been\ndescribed as empowering and raising self-confidence among\nparticipants. \"The act of seeing ourselves can join the links\nof self-observation, establishing a clear identity that may\nhave been non-existent. Identity and self-definition are nec-\nessary prerequisites for personal empowerment\" (White,\n2003, p. 66). In the process of seeing ourselves, we have the\nopportunity to create a distant position to ourselves, reflect-\ning on our actions. For communities, the collective watching\nof video material means the negotiation of shared meanings\nand understandings. It creates an opportunity to discuss per-\nceptions within a group. This process becomes particularly\nimportant within the context of HIV and AIDS which is sur-\nrounded by taboos and stigmatization. Knowledge is put out\nin the open, and through collective viewing, everyone is\nbrought on the same level for discussion.\nThe innovative research approach within the Highlands\ncontext has provided researchers an opportunity to apply\nlocal concepts and act them out through community partici-\npation. Using creative methods, as Knowles and Cole (2008)\nhave argued, is\npart of a broader commitment to shift the dominant paradigmatic\nview that keeps the academy and community separated: to\nacknowledge the multiple dimensions that constitute and form\nthe human condition--physical, emotional, spiritual, social,\ncultural--and the myriad ways of engaging in the world--oral,\nliteral, visual, embodied. (p. 60)\nArts-based research methods are closely linked to cultural\napproaches to transformation and social change. Highland's\ncultures are known for their capacity to express themselves cre-\natively. The setting thus provided a unique location to explore\nengagement in creative research methods with communities.\nIncorporating the visual approach with an understanding\nof Melanesian values confirms Bourriaud's (2002) concept\nof relational aesthetics that conceptualizes art practice away\nfrom the \"self-referentiality of modernist art,\" turning instead\nto the way art-making builds relationships with others and\nwith the world. Bourriaud believes that collaborative art and\nmedia making provide a space to explore these relations and\nour identity as it evolves through them. Here, relations, not\nmedia objects, are primary. A collective aesthetic means \"our\nvalues are embedded in our physical and affective relation-\nBy facilitating a collaborative creative process, values\nand decisions can be reflected on and collectively shared by\nparticipants. This process as we indicate in this article pro-\nvides an opportunity to tackle some of the driving forces of\nthe HIV epidemic and to ignite solutions developed by the\nparticipants themselves specific to their local setting and\nsituation.\nThe KTP Process: Using PAR for Social\nChange\nThe ethos behind participatory action research, involving\nconsultation and participation processes, is not for researchers to\nadopt the responsibility of improving each individual's and\nfamily's life. Instead, if individuals, families, communities and\ninstitutions including governments are interested in improving,\nor could be convinced to improve, then researchers and\npractitioners can use participatory action research to facilitate,\nsupport and assist the parties' own actions. (Kelman, Lewis,\nThe epistemological foundations of PAR, such as being con-\ntext-bound, focusing on real-life problems, seeking for\nThomas et al. 5\ndiversity and trans-disciplinarily (Bodorkos & Pataki, 2009),\nresonated with the nature and aims of this project. And as\nPAR's approach highlights, research subjects in this project\nhave been full participatory partners in the work of trying to\naddress the HIV/AIDS issue; the action to address this issue\narose from this collaborative work; and research was pro-\nduced throughout this process (Wisner, Stea, & Kruks, 1991).\nAction research starts \"from an orientation of change with\nothers\" rather than the change of others (Reason & Bradbury,\n2008, p. 1). Participants, researchers, and community mem-\nbers in this case engaged in processes of cyclic action from\nobserving, reflecting, planning, and action. The situational\ncharacteristic of action research allows for the evaluation of\nindividual and community transformations, revealing how\nknowledge is processed and constantly (re)formulated\nwithin the discourse of culture (see Gegeo & Gegeo-\nWatson, 2002). In this case, visual analysis and ethno-\ngraphic techniques have been used to engage community\nmembers in interpreting interviews and behaviors.\nCommunity interpretations were workshopped with local\nresearchers and participants through reflexive visual analy-\nsis. Video ethnography is increasingly recognized as an\neffective and accessible methodology, particularly in its\nability to create dialogical approaches to change (Iedema,\nThe PAR cycle (observe-reflect-plan-act) was activated in\nconsultation with the participant community and other\nmembers. Following initial observation, a baseline study,\nand community reflection and discussion, a specific set of\nactions was designed. This set of actions was then realized,\nbeing iteratively reflected on and revised as the research pro-\ngresses and as the community was given opportunities to\ncomment and respond. The main steps in the research pro-\ncess included the eight stages mentioned in Table 1.\nThe engagement in visual and filmmaking processes\nexpanded the action research framework. Due to the large\namount of visual data collected, the research facilitators\nunderwent a selection process of the material that was then\nincorporated in feedback sessions with the communities.\nReflection of the recorded material provided an additional\nlevel of validation of the analysis of the data and served as a\ntrigger for dialogue among participants (Figure 1).\nBy using visual tools and looking back at them, research-\ners as well as community members entered a process of par-\nticipation, observation, filming, selection, reflection, and\npositive change (see Iedema & Merrick, 2008). Through its\nexplorative nature, the project stayed open to adopting the\nmost effective and culturally appropriate processes. In a\ncountry with strong oral traditions, linguistic diversity, and\nhigh illiteracy rate, visual methods were tested and proved to\nbe appropriate in engaging communities in research and\ncommunity action practices. Through their potentially higher\nlevel of engagement, research results are more likely to ben-\nefit these communities.\nTable 1.The Komuniti Tok Piksa Process as Undertaken in the Ruti Community.\nNo Stage Description\n1 Consent and community\nintroduction\nThe local researchers first identified the community to conduct their research in. In\nthis case, the selection was influenced by an existing relationship of the leading local\nresearcher with this community through relatives which facilitated the entry into the\ngroup. A community introductory meeting was then held with the community and\nconsent was gained from the community.\n2 Baseline study Observation and interviews were conducted to assess the general level of HIV and\nAIDS education and knowledge in the community, the way in which information is\ndisseminated, and the particular interests of the community.\n3 Community profile and\ncommunicative ecology\nAs part of creating a comprehensive profile of the community and its members, the\nresearch teams created a profile of the community and facilitated the drawing of\ntheir communicative ecology map which along with the baseline formed the basis of\nknowledge and information dissemination patterns.\n4 Review research topics and debrief Having iteratively revised the research topics to be inclusive of community perspectives\nand needs, the researchers revised and planned the next stage. They incorporated\nrelevant community members, as the specifics of the research were finalized.\n5 Recording or creation The research team, supervised by the principal researcher, recorded community\nnarratives or facilitated, where appropriate, creative workshops. For example, some\ncommunities produced a film based on a dramatized story, and others created a song.\n6 Downloading and editing The filmed data were then digitized and edited on-site, involving participants.\n7 Screening or performing Once the product was prepared, the community was invited for a collective viewing.\nThe researchers together with the immediate participants then presented their artistic\ncreations to the community.\n8 Reflection, collective viewing, and\ndiscussion\nFollowing the screening, the researchers facilitated community discussion focusing on the\nissues raised by the visual outcome. Open discussion about HIV and AIDS relevant to\nthe community was stimulated.\n6 SAGE Open\nAn Indigenous Approach to Visual\nResearch and Practice\nIn the first phase of KTP, researcher teams traveled to 10\nHighlands communities to establish projects. The open\napproach meant that in each community, the creative pro-\ncesses varied. The level of participation was determined by\nthe communities, whether they contribute to the visual prod-\nucts by being interviewed or telling their own stories or\nactively participating in taking pictures.\nPrioritizing and Valuing Relationships\nIn trying to contribute to a growing body of understanding of\nindigenous research approaches in PNG, the project sought\nto open up a space where Papua New Guinean researchers\ncould examine their own understanding of what it meant to\ndo \"indigenous research.\" This meant to reflect not only on\nthe community's practices and actions but also on their own\nunderstandings and learning.\nAs I went through this research processes, I came to realise that\nan indigenous approach was everyday in action, most times\nunconsciously activated. The different approaches were helpful\nin shaping my view of the KTP approach, making me link the\nconcepts to things I recognized in my life. Reading other\npeople's work however did not give me a sense of how I could\ndo my own research using an indigenous research approach.\n(Eggins, reflections from her MA thesis on the project, 2011)\nThe indigenous research paradigm, especially from a\nMelanesian research approach, accepts relationships as fun-\ndamental to the experience (Mel, 2002). The indigenous\nresearcher is also a stakeholder in the relationship web and\nthus obliged to maintain it, taking the role of the researcher\nto another level, this of a \"critical, reflexive, stakeholder\nresearcher.\" The researcher's relationship to the community\nneeds to be clear and significant enough to make you a\nstakeholder to the relationship, and it must be openly\nacknowledged by members of the community:\nJoys came here through a connection; you young people sitting\nhere know this. She came and slept in my house and worked\nwith the youths and you showed your film in other communities.\nI am very happy about this. (Gigau, Closing comments, January\nLocal researchers experienced several challenges in the pro-\ncess of conceptualizing the project, their participation during\nthe process of entering the communities, establishing rela-\ntionships in regard to this project, and defining their role as\nfacilitators, co-researchers, and members of the community.\nIn this process, they had to leave aside prior knowledge of\nresearch methodologies that were not applicable within the\ncontext of this research project.\nThe need for reflection on their personal experiences and\nknowledge prior to this project and how they relate to their\nrole in the project was an important process for the local\nresearchers. An indigenous research approach is an encircle-\nment of ontology, epistemology, axiology, and methodology,\nwhere individual cultural groups process and create knowl-\nedge in everyday interactions (Gegeo & Gegeo-Watson,\nhas values that underpin its worldview, and the local research-\ners needed to develop an awareness of their worldview and\nthe impact it had on creating knowledge with the communi-\nties during the project process. Eggins developed her own\nmodel in an effort to make sense what indigenous means in\nthe research process with communities (Figure 2).\nIn the above diagram, the outer circles represent everyday\ncommunity encounters, issues, events Eggins experienced.\nThese are all related, not compartmentalized, flowing one\ninto another in day-to-day activities. The inner circles repre-\nsent community values, forming a foundation for ethical\nconducts. The outer and inner circles are not exhaustive and\ndependant on the community's activities and engagements.\nAt the centre is the community, and its well-being is achieved\nthrough experiences, transitions, resolutions, and awareness\nofthingsbothnaturalandsupernatural(spiritual).Negotiation\nwas an important component of the research experience, and\nknowledge of the community's values and expectations was\nimperative. With the tensions, for instance, around project\nbenefits, it was important that the researcher continued to\nnegotiate through dialogue, reasserting the value of mone-\ntary benefit as a sub-value compared with gutpela sindaun\n(Tok Pisin for well-being) and its importance of maintaining\ncommunity relationships. Part of this ongoing negotiation\nwas her engagement in reciprocity, that is, sharing of food or\nkill of a pig to say thank you.\nRelational Accountability as Process and Ethics\nWorking with communities requires an ongoing negotiation\nprocess of relationships including acquiring consent. Ignoring\nFigure 1. Ruti youth reviewing and discussing the visual material.\nThomas et al. 7\nrelational conflicts or harmonies that exist in a community\nwould certainly have a direct impact on the researcher's rela-\ntionship with the community. Relationships and accountabil-\nity to these relationships became an important part of the\nnegotiation process where transparency and openness were\nkey elements. Wilson (2008) affirms relational accountabil-\nity as a principle of researching indigenous communities. It\nwas paramount that the researcher maintained a good rela-\ntionship with the community, for their family's, the partici-\npants', and the project's sake. Jones, Crengle, and McCreanor\n(2006) note the importance of relationships in the Maori\nresearch process.\nA critical aspect of the research process has been\nwhakawhanaungatanga: allowing time and space to establish\nrelationships. The dynamics of whanaungatanga are critical in\ndetermining participation in research and negotiating access to\ncommunities. (Edwards et al., 2005, as cited in Jones et al.,\nThis extends to what the authors say is an embodiment of the\nnew relationship (between researchers and researched)\nbeginning with \"rituals of encounter, informed consent and\nability to opt out of the project and appropriate exit proce-\nof indigenous research such as Bishop (1998) and Smith\n(1999) write that research in indigenous communities using\nWestern epistemologies fail if its purpose is to improve con-\nditions of indigenous communities, instead of enabling the\ncommunities to seek their own answers.

A Melanesian epistemology is embedded in the rela-\ntionships that are formed and from which knowledge of the\nworld is acquired.\nIn these communities, there was an intricate network of social\nand family relationships that helped to ensure survival of the\nFigure 2.

People did not\ndefine themselves in terms of their individuality, but in terms of\ngroup affiliation. Basic to their thinking and knowing was\nRelationships are hard to measure and quantify, but everyday\nexpressions and ceremonial/symbolic gestures embodies the\nrelationships we have with one another. Negotiating these\nrelationships for the project included ongoing interactions\nbetween participants and the researcher and communication\nwith them, about them as individuals and community mem-\nbers and about the project. This enabled the researcher to talk\nto participants about their uncertainties (i.e., money) and\nplan for the future. The ongoing dialogue, including simple\nacts of communication, such as wishing goodnight over the\nphone, added value to the relationship. The youth partici-\npants of the Ruti village refer to Eggins as \"sister\" even after\nthe project's ending.\nNegotiation with the wider community was through a\ncombination of occurrences. In Eggins's case, following the\ninitial screening in Ruti village, people began to understand\nwhat the project was about. This became the focus of negoti-\nating the value of community's participation and the proj-\nect's continuity. As we dialogued after the screening, viewers\nappreciated the visual, talking about its use as a tool for pre-\nserving community images and traditional cultures.\nOn behalf of the community, I'd like to say thank you for doing\nthis. You came and got the youths involved in this drama film\nand after watching it, we in this small community like it and we\nare happy with you. (Viewer 6, Ruti screening, October 2010)\nWilson (2008) writes that an indigenous research paradigm\nis when \"the axiology and methodology are based upon\nmaintaining accountability to these relationships\" (p. 71).\nMantovani (1984) describes it in a different way: referring to\nrelationships (in general) making a community connected to\neach other in a web of interrelatedness, whether it be as\nfriends (positive relationships) or as enemies who pose a\nthreat to the literal sense of an end to life. Eggins's role as a\nresearcher/student/facilitator was clear to the participant\nyouths and community. But it was her connection to a family\n(her aunt in this case) in Ruti that strengthened her position.\nThe community's knowledge of her family ties has made her\nstatus a bit more than just researcher/student/facilitator. It is\na pre-set foundation that allows be to a firm stakeholder in\nthat relationship.\nThe relationships built on and forged are vital to the proj-\nect as well as the research process, where a space is created\nfor negotiation. The continued dialogue that she maintained\nas a researcher kept the relationship going and the doors\nopen for collaborative work. It is this relationship that makes\nEggins a stakeholder in the experiences that unfold, thus\nholding her accountable. The relationship thus transcends its\ntransactional character and enters a reciprocal long-lasting\nphase where all parties are equally accountable.\nThe value of \"community\" is surface-value because com-\nmunity has always been the way Melanesian have experi-\nenced a core value--being life translating to gutpela sindaun\nin Melanesian Pidgin for lack of terminology translation\n. . . the function of community is biological survival, emotional\nsurvival, meaning, all the facets that are embodied in the word\n\"life.\" Life is not only biological existence; it is health, wealth,\nwell-being, good relationships, security, prestige, strength, etc.\nThe community has been experienced as the \"only way to such\"\n\"life,\" and so it comes to share in the \"absoluteness\" of \"life.\"\nMantovani (1984) offers that relationships, with ancestors,\nwithin community, to other communities, to the total envi-\nronment, and exchange as pivotal to the interpretations of life\nwithin community. In research endeavors, this might be\ndescribed as an embodiment of the new relationship (between\nresearchers and researched) beginning with \"rituals of\nencounter, informed consent and ability to opt out of the\nproject and appropriate exit procedures\" (Jones et al., 2006,\nEngaging with the community in a meaningful way is\nvery important as all interactions have underlining meanings\nthat intricately connect everyone and everything in the\nmicrocosm of these Highland's communities. In linking such\na research approach to issues like HIV and AIDS, and find-\ning ways of potentially making awareness effective, both\nresearcher and community must be collaborative agents of\nchange, understanding how a community in transition values\ngutpela sindaun and especially how they interpret it. The\ntechnology and all it entails can become a tool for opening a\nspace for communication for social change and participatory\ncommunication.\nWhen HIV/AIDS awareness groups come to the village they just\ncome and talk and go away and people do not get their message.\nWhen KTP came into the community we thought that they were\nhere to do their research so we took them as another awareness\ngroup. But now we see what they were here for and we were part\nof the film that they made and it's very good for the community to\nknow more about HIV/AIDS . . . This film that we have made is\nvery good and it is powerful. The children can learn from it when\nthey grow up so I am very happy. (Older man, Mu Community in\nthe Simbu Province quoted in Thomas et al., 2012)\nRefocusing the researcher's actions on his or her relational\naccountability introduces a new perspective into the research\nprocess. This approach also opens up a space for creative\ncollaboration. Once trust has been build in the community\nand consent has been obtained for the participants to take part in\nthe research, a creative process begins. The building of the\nThomas et al. 9\nrelationships provides a space for creative collaboration.\nHence, certain groups within the participating communities\ncame forward with their ideas in regard to films, photogra-\nphy, and music.\nCreative collaborations bring in other aspects of this\napproach such as relational aesthetics and how reflection,\nfeedback, and dialogue result in reciprocity that need to be\nexplored in their own merit. In regard to research in indige-\nnous communities, there is a need to understand relational\naccountability as foundational for any intervention under-\ntaken to ensure active participation of communities through-\nout the process.\nConclusion\nPrevious HIV and AIDS prevention campaigns in PNG have\nlacked an understanding of local narratives and processes. The\nKTP project was designed to strengthen the level of commu-\nnity ownership and identification in HIV prevention materials\nto create a higher level of effectiveness of awareness cam-\npaigns. To achieve this, KTP carefully reviewed and managed\nresearchers' relationships with community members. The\nproject employed concepts of an indigenous research approach\nfocusing on relational accountability and reciprocity to ensure\nthat the participation by communities was maintained. This\narticle has presented key points in that process by reviewing\nthe researchers'and community experiences. It has argued that\nrelational accountability should be carefully examined as a\nkey component in any community intervention.\nUsing visual approaches to research and community prac-\ntice, in particular video, has presented itself as an appropriate\ntool to exchange and communicate ideas and knowledge\nabout HIV and AIDS in PNG communities. Following indig-\nenous principles can provide a more holistic approach to\ncommunication, incorporating embedded cultural practices,\nnorms, and everyday negotiations into the identified issues in\nregard to HIV and AIDS. The involvement of the community\nmembers in the creation of such material was crucial in mak-\ning it relevant to their specific situation and in creating a\nspace for dialogue among others in the community.\nVisual communication as a research tool can build on\nexisting community communication structures and serve as a\ncatalyst for sharing indigenous understandings. Communities\nfeel valued when their ideas are recorded. The open approach\nto let the participants guide the creative process allowed the\nresearchers to better understand community perceptions\nincluding scenarios of risky behavior. The viewing of the\nRuti film drama stimulated important community discussion\namong audiences. The product therefore serves as a stimula-\ntor within the local context.\nInvolving and training local researchers was a key com-\nponent of KTP's approach. Existing community relation-\nships were utilized and expanded throughout the project.\nThis was not without challenges, and ongoing negotiations\nevolved around managing expectations from the communi-\nties, researchers, and funding bodies. Five years after the\nproject started, the audio-visual materials continue to be dis-\ntributed in PNG and the wider Pacific, and the research team\ncontinues to negotiate relationships with community mem-\nbers who are involved in the distribution of the material.\nThe article has argued that for HIV/AIDS communication\nto be successful, appropriate communication channels need to\nbe opened up. This begins with the way connections to mem-\nbers of the community are established and how building trust-\ning-relationships with participants can provide access to local\nnarratives. This can be achieved by following indigenous\napproaches to research and media practices prioritizing rela-\ntional accountability of researchers and participants. Here, the\ngoal has been to mobilize the community to participate and\ndebate their views and for them to take ownership of HIV\nmessages and solutions to the HIV epidemic. Understanding\nparticipatory communication from a relational perspective can\nassist researchers to frame understandings of participation and\nengages them in an ethical process reviewing their own\ninvolvement with the community.\n"
