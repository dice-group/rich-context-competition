There was no difference in\nbaseline demographics, NIHSS, pre-stroke mRS,\nOTT, and risk factor profiles between Filipino subjects\nTable 1.

Sensitivity analyses assuming worst and\nbest outcomes for missing data showed qualitatively\nsimilar trajectories for all time points with the expected\nvariabilities in 95% CI (Figure 2). By comparison,\nalthough still in favor of MLC601, the effect sizes\namong non-Filipino subjects at different time points\nwere not of the same magnitude as those of the\nFilipino cohort as illustrated in Figure 3.\nDuring the study period up to M24, two recurrent\nstrokes and 16 deaths (including 7 classified as vascular\ndeath) were reported in the MLC601 group and one\nrecurrent stroke and 14 deaths (including 4 classified\nas vascular death) in the placebo group.

We have previously demonstrated that sub-\njects having more prognostic factors for poor outcome\nshowed better treatment effects with MLC601 at three\nmonths.4,5 Patients in CHIMES had relatively mild\nstroke severity many of whom recovered well by three\nmonths even in the placebo group,1 which likely\naffected the power of detecting the treatment effect.6\u00ad8\nThe study population from the Philippines, on the\nother hand, included more subjects with prognostic fac-\ntors for poorer outcome, such as female sex, stroke\nseverity, and treatment delay.\nThe durability of the benefits derived from treatment\nwith MLC601 is clinically important. Spontaneous\nrecovery to a certain extent in the initial three months\nafter stroke is well described, especially among strokes\nof milder severity.9 Thereafter, neurological and func-\ntional recovery occurs at a much slower rate. However,\na recent study from the Swedish Stroke Register\nshowed a high proportion of patients transitioning\nfrom independence at three months to dependence in\nactivities of daily living at 12 months after a stroke.10\nThis deterioration was more common in older patients\nand women. While demonstrating benefit at three\nmonths would already translate to improved quality\nof lives of patients and caregivers, a durable benefit of\nup to two years would translate to significantly higher\nquality-adjusted life years. MLC601 has been shown to\nhave neuro-restorative properties, in addition to its\nneuroprotective properties, in various animal and cel-\nlular stroke models by enhancing the natural neuro-\nrepair processes of the brain after an injury.11,12 The\ngradual but long-lasting beneficial effects of such treat-\nment strategy can, therefore, be expected in strokes of\nany severity, but logically can clinically be demon-\nstrated better in patients with worse prognosis among\nwhom improvements are likely to be more apparent\nwith treatment.\nThere are some limitations in this study. Variables\nsuch as quality of medical care, nutrition, and economic\nfactors were not collected which could have allowed us\nto assess their potential as confounders. There were no\ndata on the use of medications such as anti-thrombo-\ntics, statins, and anti-hypertensives that could have\naffected recurrent vascular events.\nThe main strength of the study, nonetheless, is the\nlong duration of follow-up of subjects randomized in\nan international multi-centre clinical trial with double-\nblinding of treatment allocation being maintained till\nthe end of the study period. The end-points used were\nthose employed in most stroke outcome trials.\nPerforming the functional assessments by telephone\nensured subject retention and minimized the loss of\ndata in our study. They have been shown to be as reli-\nConclusion\nTo conclude, the Filipino cohort in the CHIMES and\nCHIMES-E study had different prognostic and vascular\nrisk factor profiles as compared to other countries. The\nlarger and more durable beneficial effects with MLC601\nobserved in the Filipino population are most likely due\nto the presence of prognostic factors for poorer out-\ncome. This study supports our hypothesis that treatment\neffects are seen earlier and are sustained in stroke\npatients who have the potential to benefit from treat-\nment. A longer follow-up study design is preferred in\nassessing the efficacy of treatment in post-stroke recov-\nery trials. Our data further support the rationale for\nselecting subjects with potentially poorer outcomes in\nstroke recovery trials to improve the ability of the\nstudy to detect meaningful treatment effects.\n"
