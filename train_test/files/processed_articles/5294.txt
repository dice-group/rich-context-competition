Controlling for parental education, students' age\n(18-27 years), and gender, we aimed to explain between- and within-sample differences in the ACA by taking the students'\nliving situation, intimate relationship status, and expectations about their future perspectives into account. The participants\nindicated the ACA on the questionnaire based on criteria for reaching adulthood used in studies of adulthood conceptions.\nThe students also provided information about when they think they will start the first full-time career, get married, gain\nfinancial independence, and become a parent. The Europeans indicated less ACA than the Americans; 20% of the variance in\nthe ACA was, along with the country effect, explained by the intimate relationship status and future perspectives.\n",

Emerging adulthood is distinguished\nfrom adolescence and young adulthood in terms of demogra-\nphy, that is, a great deal of change and diversity in living situ-\nation, education/work-related issues, and partnership\narrangements; a sense of ambiguity in the perceived develop-\nmental status; optimistic views on one's own future possi-\nbilities; and prolonged identity exploration (Arnett, 2000,\n2006). The period appears in societies that postpone an indi-\nvidual's entry into adult roles and responsibilities, particu-\nlarly in postindustrial societies that emphasize the role of\neducation, professional training, individual choice, and per-\neconomic and social changes in those societies, traditional\nviews on adulthood stressing adult role transitions seem to\nhave been replaced in their importance by more individualis-\nConceptions of the Transition Into\nAdulthood\nResearch examining individuals' conceptions of the transi-\ntion into adulthood was initially conducted in the United\nadulthood is viewed, Arnett constructed a list of criteria for\nadulthood drawn from sociological, anthropological, and\npsychological perspectives.

The importance of family capaci-\nties (e.g., capability to support the family), norm compliance\n(e.g., driving safely), and interdependence (e.g., making life-\nlong commitments to others) are also widely stressed,\nwhereas legal/chronological (e.g., age 18) and biological\ntransitions (e.g., capability of bearing children) rank rela-\ntively low. Although this research suggests that little impor-\ntance is attributed to role transitions (e.g., parenthood), an\nactual entry into family-related adult roles (Arnett, 2001;\nZupancic, Komidar, & Puklek Levpuscek, 2014), and work-\nrelated transitions (Zupancic et al., 2014) has been shown to\nenhance emerging adults' perceived adult status.\nPerceived Adult Status and Achieved\nCriteria for Adulthood (ACA)\nThe present study investigated how emerging adults perceive\ntheir adult status in a cross-national perspective. The per-\nceived adult status has been predominantly studied by sim-\nply asking individuals whether they have reached adulthood.\nA majority of emerging adults have not responded affirma-\ntively but rather viewed themselves in a transition toward\nAccordingly, 78% of the Austrian and 86% of both the\nSlovene and the American emerging adult students perceived\nthemselves in-between an adolescent and an adult (Sirsch &\ngested that the perceived adult status is a multidimensional\nconstruct, which cannot be fully captured by looking for an\nanswer to a general question. They proposed each of the\ndimensions to be tapped separately by using criteria about\nthe conception of adulthood from the Arnett list, which refer\nto distinct conceptual categories such as Independence (e.g.,\nnot deeply tied to parents emotionally), Interdependence\n(e.g., committed to long-term love relationships), and Family\nCapacities (e.g., capable of caring for children). In line with\nwe quantified the concept of the perceived adult status by\nusing several criteria from the Arnett list in a modified\nresponse format, that is, asking individuals whether they\nthink that they have fulfilled each of the criteria to gain better\nand more specific insights into young peoples'perceptions of\ntheir own adult status.\nUsing a modified version of the criteria list, Kins and\nBeyers (2010) demonstrated that emerging adults' percep-\ntions of the achieved criteria for adulthood (ACA) are impor-\ntant as individuals'success in theACAis associated with their\nsubjective well-being. Moreover, an increase in the ACA,\nparticularly those criteria that refer to independence and inter-\ndependence, contributed to a positive change in emerging\nadults' well-being over time. Literature in related fields fur-\nther suggests that emerging adults show an increase of well-\nbeing with growing psychosocial maturity (Galambos,\nBarker, & Krahn, 2006) and after having successfully accom-\nplished developmental tasks concerning autonomy, educa-\ntion, work, and intimate relationships (Schulenberg, Bryant,\nOnly a few studies investigated the ACA (Kins & Beyers,\nZupancic et al., 2014) but none of them directly evaluated\ndata across national samples, which would provide a broader\ninsight into similarities and differences of the emerging\nadults' perceived adult status. We compared perceptions of\nthe ACA among university students in two European coun-\ntries (Austria and Slovenia) and the United States (Michigan).\nWe aimed to include two different European countries (both\nEU members) with same historical roots (differing from the\nUnited States) but different socio-economic system in the\nrecent past. Slovenia as a part of former Yugoslavia under-\nwent 45 years of so-called soft version of socialism after the\nSecond World War, which was notably different than in\nEastern European countries and thus, provided the people\nmuch more freedom and ties with the Western world. All\nthree countries differ in the social-welfare regime, which\nmay affect the young peoples' pathways to adulthood\n(Douglass, 2007). Austria can be characterized as a conser-\nvative regime, Slovenia closely resembles the Southern\nEuropean regime, and the United States may be placed\nwithin a liberal welfare regime. More importantly, these\nmodern societies were selected as emerging adulthood is a\ngeneral phenomenon of societies characterized by prolonged\neducation, financial dependence, delay in leaving parental\nhome, marriage, parenthood, and career start. We already\nknow that emerging adults in these three countries share sim-\nilar conceptions of adulthood (Townshend et al., 2009). At\nthe same time, these three modern societies (Austria,\nSlovenia, and the United States) differ in average age of\nattaining these adult transitions, which may also create dis-\nsimilar pressures as to when and how individuals perceive\nthemselves as adults. As suggested previously, the adult tran-\nsitions appear to shape emerging adults'perceptions of being\nZupancic et al., 2014) in spite of the fact that the individuals\nplace little importance on these transitions in their conceptu-\nalizations of adulthood.\nBased on these former findings, we focused on features\nthat may explain the individuals' perceptions of the ACA\nwithin--as well as between--the national samples. Given\nZupancic et al. 3\nthat our population of interest was university students, we\nincluded their subjectively expected age of adult transitions\n(full-time career, financial independence, marriage, and par-\nenthood) instead of actual transitions. In addition, the stu-\ndents' living situation and intimate relationship status were\naccounted for as further explaining factors of the ACA.\nExplanatory Factors of Student\nPerceptions of the ACA\nMoving out of the parental home and involvement in an inti-\nmate relationship are considered important adult transitions,\nwhich positively affect developmental processes necessary\nfor an individual to reach full adult status (e.g., Buhl, 2008;\nLarose & Boivin, 1998). Similarly, young people who antici-\npate fulfillment of personal plans about adult transitions ear-\nlier report higher levels of psychosocial maturity (Carroll\nLiving Situation\nResiding out of the family home may enhance individuals'\nattainment of several criteria for adulthood, in particular\nthose related to personal independence, that is, taking over\nresponsibilities of everyday life, relying on one's own judg-\nments, gaining financial independence, and restructuring\nrelationships with parents in terms of relations among equals\nwith parents has been suggested to inhibit individuals' inde-\npendence, well-being (White, 2002), achievement of psy-\nchosocial maturity, emotional autonomy, and self-reliant\nfunctioning (Beyers & Goossens, 2003; Beyers & Seiffge-\ndemonstrate that emerging adults living independently suc-\nceed better in achieving a number of adult criteria than those\nWe expected that the students living out of their parents'\nhome would report moreACAthan those residing in the fam-\nily home and that the students' living situation would con-\ntribute to both within- and cross-sample variability in the\nACA as the age of moving out varies among the countries of\nour inquiry.

Adolescents and emerging adults mainly focus on pro-\nductive (education, career) and reproductive future goals\nthey have relatively detailed conceptions of personal timing of\nachieving those goals and anticipate their lives as a sequence\nof finishing their education, starting a career, marriage, and\nFuture-oriented motivation and behavior are channeled\nby socio-cultural factors and institutional structures (e.g.,\nsocial expectations, demands, and opportunities), which cre-\nate an opportunity space for individuals' development. In\naddition, the individuals actively select their environments\nand construct future goals accordingly (Nurmi, 2004). It is\ntherefore not surprising that the anticipated timing of adult\ntransitions appears consistent with statistics of the median\nages at which individuals experience the respective transi-\nthese anticipations predict individuals' behavior before the\nNurmi, 2004). Young people who are closer to an expected\nadult transition report higher levels of exploration, commit-\nment, or mature behavior in the respective domain (Carroll et\nthe students' expectations of earlier personal transitions (the\nfirst full-time job, financial independence, marriage, and par-\nenthood) would contribute to endorsement of more ACA.\nConsistent with cross-national differences in the popula-\ntion data available for marriage and parenthood, earlier mean\n4 SAGE Open\nages of anticipated personal transitions were expected in the\nUnited States (i.e., the state of Michigan) than in Austria and\nSlovenia, which may also contribute to the variation in the\nACA among the samples.

The\nmean age of adult transitions also varies by social class: A\nhigher socio-economic class is associated with older ages\nStudy Goals\nThe goals of this study were to explore cross-national differ-\nences in the student-perceived ACA and to explain between-\nas well as within-country differences by variation in students'\nliving situation, intimate relationship status, and anticipated\nage of adult transitions. Controlling for age, gender, and fam-\nily background, two hypotheses were tested: (a) The U.S.\nstudents would endorse more ACA than their European\ncounterparts; (b) the three study variables would explain\nboth within- and between-country differences, that is, living\nout of parents'home, involvement in an intimate relationship\n(including its length), and earlier expectations of achieving\nfuture plans (full-time job, financial independence, marriage,\nand parenthood) would contribute to perceptions of having\nachieved more criteria for adulthood. We also explored\nwhether any of the explanatory variables shows a country-\nspecific relation to the perceived ACA. Due to a lack of\nbackground evidence, we refrained from formulating hypoth-\neses about possible moderating effects of country on the\nassociations between the study variables and the ACA.\nMethod\nParticipants\nStudents at the State University of Vienna, Austria (n = 210);\nthe State University of Ljubljana, Slovenia (n = 201); and\nGrand Valley State University in Michigan, the United States\n(n = 225) participated in this study, which is a part of a\nbroader project on emerging adulthood in the three countries.\nA vast majority of the Europeans took courses in social sci-\nU.S. students were mostly split between the social sciences\nwere predominantly of Austrian (85%) and Slovene ethnicity\n(95%); 84% of the Americans were Caucasian; 7% African;\n5% Asian; and 4% were Hispanic/Latino, Native American,\nor multiethnic.\nto 27 years.

The completion of the paper-and-pencil questionnaires\nwas anonymous and took approximately 45 min.\nInstruments\nThree questionnaires were relevant for this study. They were\ntranslated from English to German and Slovene and then\nback translated. Along with the questions about age, gender,\nstudymajor,ethnicity,andparents'education,theBackground\nInformation asked for students' living situation (in or out of\nparents' home), current intimate relationship status (single\nvs. in a relationship), and length of intimate relationship (1--\nin a relationship less than a year, 2--between 1 and 2 years,\nZupancic et al. 5\n3--more than 3 years). We created intimate relationship sta-\ntus by combining the two latter variables: \"0\" means \"no\nrelationship\" and represents the zero point of the variable.\nThis quantitative variable contains all participants and we\nassumed that the length of relationship is important because\nattachment, intimacy, trust, and eventually commitment\ndevelop over time. Furthermore, the qualitative variable\n\"single vs. in a relationship\" neither explained any substan-\ntial variance of perceived ACA (p = .28) nor in interaction\nwith culture (p = .08).\nA reduced number of items from the Conception of the\nTransition to Adulthood (CTA; Arnett, 2003) were applied in\na modified response version labeled the Achieved Criteria\nfor Adulthood (ACA). Instead of asking the respondents\nabout the importance of criteria proposed for reaching adult-\nhood (the CTA), the ACA asked the students to indicate\nwhether they believe they have already reached each of the\ncriteria in a yes/no response format. The 20 ACA items\nincluded criteria from the Independence (e.g., accept respon-\nsibilityfortheconsequencesofyouractions),Interdependence\n(e.g., learn always to have good control over your emotions),\nFamily Capacities (e.g., capable of running a household),\nand Norm Compliance (e.g., avoid drunk driving) categories\nof the CTA. Due to the respondents' age, student status, the\nfocus on the perceived ACA, and possible overlap with the\ncontrol/explanatory variables, the CTA items belonging to\nthe Biological, Legal/Chronological, and Role Transitions\ncategories were omitted entirely. Three other CTA items\nwere also ignored, namely, those concerning completed edu-\ncation, career settlement, and the item \"No longer living in\nparents' household\" as the latter overlaps with one of the\nexplanatory variables. However, some items that may appear\nat first glance to overlap with the explanatory variables (e.g.,\n\"Committed to a long-term love relationship\" and \"Capable\nof running a household\") were retained because they reflect\nsubjective judgments. For example, one may be engaged in a\nrelationship without being committed or live out of the\nparental home without feeling capable of managing his or\nher household properly.\nThe overall ACA score was defined as the percentage of\n\"yes\" answers to the items and separate item scores were\ncomputed in the same way (Table 1). The internal coherence\nof the 20-item overall ACA scores was relatively low (pos-\nsibly due to the restricted dichotomous response format) but\nstill acceptable, with Cronbach's s of .67 in Slovenia, and\n.56 in both Austria and the United States. In line with reports\nTable 1.

The\neffects at the item-level analysis were identical with the reduced sample (with students reaching any of the adult transitions and the respective four ACA\nitems excluded). ACA = achieved criteria for adulthood.\n6 SAGE Open\nabout low internal coherence of the ACA (Kins & Beyers,\net al., 2009), and several unsuccessful attempts to replicate\nArnett's conceptually derived categories (see Kins &\nBeyers, 2010), our results showed very low s for the cate-\ngory-level scores (e.g., from .26 to .32 for Independence).\nThe category-level scores were thus not considered in the\nmain analyses.\nThe Future Plans questionnaire was constructed by the\nresearch team. The rationale of the questions was to get\ninformation about how close/far from the adult transitions\nthe students view themselves at present. The participants\nwere asked when they think that they would start their first\nfull-time career, become financially independent from their\nparents, get married, and have a child. The ages were given\nin years. \"Never\" was a further answer option. The overall\nscore was defined as an average age expected across the four\ntransitions, with high values indicating later expectations.\nStudents who reached at least one of the transitions (n = 85)\nor answered \"never\" (n = 81) were excluded; 2.52% of the\nreached financial independence, and 0.90% (n = 6) were\nmarried and had a child. Cronbach's  was satisfactory for\nthe total sample ( = .82) and within the countries: Austria\nData Analyses\nThe analysis was divided into three steps. First, we computed\nan ANCOVA with control variables (age, gender, and parent\neducation) as covariates to test country differences in the\noverall perception of the ACA, followed by looking into vari-\nations in specific criteria. Second, we analyzed the country\ndifferences in explanatory variables (living situation, intimate\nrelationship status, and future plans) by ANOVAs. Third, we\ncomputed two models to test whether the explanatory vari-\nables explain variance of perceived ACA and reduce the vari-\nance explained by country: In the first model, we reanalyzed\ncountry differences--similar to the first analysis--with a\nreduced sample size. As the variable Future Plans had miss-\ning/inapplicable values, we tested model 1 with the reduced\nsample size (Austria: n = 136, Slovenia: n = 143, the United\nStates: n = 191) to directly compare with the second model.\nThe second model included the three explanatory variables to\nexamine how much between- and within-country variance is\nexplained by those predictors. We also included interaction\neffects between country and explanatory variables to explore\npotential country-specific effects of the predictors. Scheff\u00e9\ntests were applied for all post hoc comparisons.\nResults\nAnalyses of Country Differences in Student\nPerceptions of the ACA\nA one-way ANCOVA with country as independent variable\nand the students' age, gender, and parents' education as\ncovariates was performed with the entire sample to test for\ncountry differences in the overall ACA.

The signifi-\ncant age effect for the total sample disappeared due to a more\nrestricted age range of the reduced sample.

However, the results do not preclude associations in the\nopposite direction, that is, the students who believe they have\nfulfilled more ACA may be more likely to engage in intimate\nrelationships and feel closer to the adult role transitions.\nThe explained variance in the ACA increased from 2.4%\n(Model 1) to 19.8% after including living situation, intimate\nrelationship status, and future plans (Model 2).

Country differences in specific ACA\nmay, in part, provide an insight into those rather small over-\nall differences. Relative to the Europeans, more of the U.S.\nstudents viewed themselves as having achieved the criteria\nof lifelong commitments to others (belonging to the\ninterdependence domain) and family capacities related to\nkeeping family safe and caring for children. The link between\nsocietal and personal expectations can also explain the\nadvanced ACA scores of the American students. The mean\nage of marriage and birth of the first child is systematically\nlower in the United States (i.e., the state of Michigan;\nMathews & Hamilton, 2009) compared with Slovenia\n(Statistical Yearbook, 2013) and Austria (Statistik Austria,\nAmerican participants also planned to reach these goals ear-\nlier than the Europeans. This prospective may indicate\nAmerican students' take on more responsibilities (making\nlong-life commitments, driving safely) or at least illustrates\ntheir perception of being more prepared to take over adult\nobligations (caring for one's own family) and thus, consider\nthemselves as having attained more criteria for adulthood.\nThe Slovene compared with the Austrian and American\nstudents felt similarly independent although most of the for-\nmer lived in the parental household. They seem to counter-\nbalance: In spite of residing with parents, partly due to a very\nshort distance separating family home and university and\nlower family income (relative to Austria and the United\nStates; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and\nDevelopment, 2012), more Slovene (a majority) than\nAustrian and American students reported not being deeply\ntied to parents emotionally and scored higher on egalitarian\nrelationships with parents and independent decision making\nin comparison with the Austrians.\nExplaining Differences in Student Perceptions of\nthe ACA\nThe three study variables (living situation, relationship sta-\ntus, future plans) together explained a considerable portion\nof within-country variation in student-perceived ACA but\ndid not account for between-sample differences, which\nappeared very modest. The results are partly consistent with\nthe second hypothesis.\nInconsistent with our expectations based on related\nresearch (Beyers & Goossens, 2003; Beyers & Seiffge-\n(residing with parents or moved out) did not contribute to\ntheir perceptions of ACA. This may be due to the fact that we\ntreated the \"moved out\" group of students as a homogeneous\ngroup, which may not be correct. Relative to residing in the\nparental home, living in a single household or sharing an\napartment with peers has been shown to decrease the likeli-\nhood of feeling an adult in a German emerging adult sample,\nwhereas cohabitation with a partner increased the partici-\npants' perceptions of being an adult (Reitzle, 2007). If this\nwas true for our samples, the presumably lower ACA scores\nof the students living in a dorm (single) or sharing an apart-\nment could counterbalance the potentially higher scores of\nthose cohabiting and show no differences in the ACA as\ncompared with the students residing with parents.\nZupancic et al. 9\nThe differences in the ACA scores by future plans were\nsimilar across the countries, suggesting that earlier personal\nexpectations of adult transitions contribute significantly to\nthe criteria for adulthood the students believed they had\nalready achieved. However, the relation may run in both\ndirections: The students expecting the transitions earlier may\nput more effort in development of more adult-like behaviors\nmore criteria as a consequence. Likewise, the individuals'\nperceptions of having fulfilled more criteria for adulthood\nmay promote their feelings and expectations of being closer\nto the adult transitions.\nStudents' intimate relationship status also contributed to\nthe interindividual variation in their ACA scores. Along with\nrelated findings (e.g., Kins & Beyers, 2010; Lanz &\nresults suggest that emerging adults' involvement in an inti-\nmate relationship appears important to their perception of\nbecoming an adult in several modern societies. However, the\nassociations obtained should be viewed bi-directionally due\nto the correlational nature of our study. It is similarly plausi-\nble that the students who indicated more ACA feel more pre-\npared to form an intimate relationship, which could increase\nthe likelihood of their intimate engagements and/or trying to\nmaintain an already established relationship. In addition, the\nsignificance of the intimate relationship status effect varied\nslightly across the countries under our study. Leading a rela-\ntionship (including its length) was less reliably associated\nwith the ACA in the Austrian students compared with the\nSlovene and American students. The longer postponement of\nmarriage in Austria and higher planned age to reach adult\ntransitions, in particular becoming a parent, by the Austrian\nstudents may create opportunities to consider intimate rela-\ntions more as ways of exploration and less as being deter-\nmined pathways toward adulthood.\nIn spite of the impact of future plans and intimate rela-\ntionship status on the ACA scores, these effects did not nota-\nbly reduce the small country differences in the perceived\nACA, although the differences dropped to marginal signifi-\ncance, which may be due to the somewhat smaller number\nof students retained in the analyses. Other characteristics\nneed to be detected to account for the cross-national varia-\ntion in the perceived ACA. Countries, for example, differ in\nstructural conditions (educational systems, employment\nopportunities, housing market, social policy, cultural expec-\ntations concerning development in emerging adulthood) that\nmay affect student perceptions of self as an adult (Molgat,\n2007). A possible factor could also be that self-enhancement\nbias is stronger in the United States than in Europe (Silvera\nthis, the Americans may tend to overestimate their ACA. An\nalternative explanation refers to differences in societal val-\nues. The higher individualism in the United States compared\nwith Austria and Slovenia (Schwartz, 2007) cannot serve as\nan explanation because the differences in the ACA were\nmostly based on criteria related to family capacities and\ninterdependence, in which the Americans reached a higher\npercentage of achievement. Perhaps family values have a\nhigher relevance for students in the US (Michigan) com-\npared with the Austrian and Slovene students. Beside the\nachievement of independence, the focus of the former may\nbe stronger oriented toward starting their own family--\nwhich happens de facto earlier (see average marriage and\nchild birth age)--and by this, they may put forth more effort\nto make sure they have achieved these capacities. In general,\nthe assessment of students'individual values (e.g., Schwartz,\n2006) could be used to explore between- and within-country\ndifferences in the ACA further.\nNo differences in the ACA were found for gender, paren-\ntal education, and age (with reduced sample size), although\nwomen and young people of less educated parents in general\nexperience adult transitions earlier than men and individuals\ngrowing up in higher educated families (Arnett, 2003;\nSircelj, 2006). It is possible that testing students might erase\nthe respective group differences as female students and stu-\ndents coming from less educated homes may also postpone\nthe adult transitions for later. This means that gender and\nfamily background differences might occur in older emerg-\ning adults, especially after graduation.\nLimitations\nThe present study was cross-sectional in nature and focused\non university students who represent a relatively homoge-\nneous group of emerging adults, who perhaps share a global\nstudent sub-culture. Other same-aged groups may have a dif-\nferent timing of adult criteria achievement and the ACA in\nnonstudents may be linked to different factors than those\ncontributing to the student-perceived ACA. Our respondents\nwere predominantly female (although the ACA scores were\nnot affected by gender) and sampled from one university per\ncountry. The generalization of the findings to student popula-\ntion in the United States (or even Michigan) is thus, quite\nlimited; however, the two European samples were selected\nfrom the largest of a few extant universities.\nFurthermore, the ACA was assessed by the list of criteria\nthat were proposed to be relevant for adulthood fromArnett's\nwork. We only retained the items from the Arnett list that are\nrelevant to the characteristics of our student samples and\nfocused on several intrapersonal, interpersonal, family-\nrelated, and rule-abiding criteria for adulthood. Criteria\nlinked to other domains of attaining an adult identity may\nalso play a significant role in student perceptions of their\ndevelopmental status, for example, those in the area of occu-\npation, ideology, religion, politics, and taking over responsi-\nbilities for other societal matters. A qualitative analysis of\nfreely generated reports on important criteria for adulthood\nwould provide an answer of whether theArnett list is exhaus-\ntive to investigate personal views on the ACA. To extend\nknowledge on subjective representations of the ACA, emerg-\ning adults'beliefs about possible hindering or advancing fac-\ntors to become an adult may prove beneficial.\nConclusion\nOur results indicated that emerging adult students in Austria,\nSlovenia, and the United States (Michigan) differ in their\nsubjectively perceived overall ACA, yet to an apparently\nmodest degree. The Americans perceived themselves more\nadult, particularly due to their perceptions of achievements\nin the domain of family capacities, long-term commitments,\nand safe driving, in comparison with the European students.\nAlthough the participants' age, gender, parental education,\nand living out of parents' home were shown to play a negli-\ngible role in their ACA, engagement in an intimate relation-\nship and planning earlier personal transitions in vital life\ndomains of (re)production were demonstrated to be impor-\ntant contributors to within-country differences in the ACA\nacross the student samples. Nevertheless, those factors did\nnot provide a noteworthy account for between-country dif-\nferences in the ACA.\nIn spite of several limitations, our findings add to the\nunderstanding of the emerging adulthood period in individu-\nals who continue their education at a tertiary level. The\nAustrian and Slovene students'responses were directly com-\npared with those of their U.S. counterparts in Michigan;\ninstead of looking at the conceptions of adulthood, we\nfocused on the student-perceived ACA, and plausible demo-\ngraphic and individual contributors to between- and within-\ncountry variation in student perceptions of their ACA. Data\nfrom more countries and accounting for nonstudents would\nallow a country-level analysis, which can offer an insight\ninto demographical, cultural, and psychological factors con-\ntributing to various pathways of becoming an adult in con-\ntemporary societies.\n"
