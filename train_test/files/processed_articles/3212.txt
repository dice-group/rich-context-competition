Cross-country insurance through the\nunemployment insurance system can be achieved without affecting unemployment\noutcomes. The Ramsey-optimal policy however prescribes a more countercyclical\nreplacement rate when international risk sharing concerns enter the unemployment\ninsurance trade-off. We calibrate our model to Eurozone data and find that opti-\nmal stabilizing transfers through the unemployment insurance system are sizable\nand mainly stabilize consumption in the periphery countries, while optimal replace-\nment rates are countercylical overall. Moreover, we find that debt-financed national\npolicies are a poor substitute for fiscal transfers.\n",

This develop-\nment, together with the resulting strains on public budgets, has renewed calls to introduce\nsome form of public cross-country risk sharing, sometimes under the name of a \"fiscal\nunion\". Indeed, a widely held view is that a common currency exacerbates the need for\ninternational risk sharing mechanisms, and that fiscal transfers become desirable when\nthe private sector lacks such mechanisms (Mundell (1961), McKinnon (1963) and Kenen\nAt the same time, high unemployment levels in many developed countries have led\nto renewed interest in the design of unemployment insurance. In the Eurozone in par-\nticular, policy makers have argued that the unemployment insurance system is a good\nand politically viable channel to share risk across countries. The EU Commissioner for\nEmployment, L\u00b4\naszl\u00b4\no Andor, states that \"based on the expert work available to date, I\nconsider that the best form of [...] a countercyclical fiscal capacity at the EMU level\nwould be a scheme where the participating countries share part of the costs of short-term\nOur question is: If a group of countries were to introduce a common unemployment\ninsurance system, what should it look like? We answer it using a two-country business\ncycle model with search frictions in labor markets. Financial markets are incomplete and\nlabor is immobile across countries, so that country-specific risk and idiosyncratic unem-\nployment risk can only be partially insured privately. The government in each country\nmaintains a mandatory unemployment insurance system. In addition, a supranational\nunemployment insurance agency is able to administer an additional component of the un-\nemployment insurance system. This component can differ across countries as a function\nof country-specific shocks.\nStarting with a simplified version of our model, we derive two theoretical insights.\nFirst, a supranational unemployment insurance system can be used to insure against\ncountry-level risk without affecting unemployment levels. The intuition is as follows.\nUnemployment insurance affects unemployment levels by changing the relative value of\nemployment over unemployment, which determines incentives to search and wage bar-\ngaining outcomes. When a country is to receive a fiscal transfer, this relative value can\nbe kept constant by simultaneously increasing the level of benefits and lowering the rate\nof contributions to the unemployment insurance system. The opposite can be done in the\ncountry which is to send the transfer.\nSecond, the presence of an international risk sharing motive introduces a counter-\ncyclical element to the optimal unemployment insurance policy. Here, the intuition is\n1See Furceri and Zdzienicka (2015) and Kalemli-Ozcan, Luttini, and S\u00f8rensen (2014) for recent evi-\ndence on the lack of risk sharing mechanisms in the Euro area. S\u00f8rensen and Yosha (1998) also provided\ncomparable estimates in the past.\n2A harmonized unemployment insurance system within the Eurozone as a tool for international risk\nsharing has also been suggested by the President of the European Council (van Rompuy, 2012), the\nInternational Monetary Fund (Blanchard, Jaumotte, and Loungani, 2014), the German Institute for\nEconomic Research (Bernoth and Engler, 2013), the French Advisory Council (Artus, Benassy-Quere,\nBoone, Cailloux, Delpla, Farhi, Gourinchas, Tirole, and Wolff, 2013), Dolls, Fuest, Neumann, and Peichl\nenassy-Qu\u00b4\ner\u00b4\ne, Ragot, and Wolff\nas follows. The classic unemployment insurance trade-off for a social planner is between\nefficiency of employment and insurance. Too much insurance reduces search effort and/or\njob creation, while too little insurance harms risk-averse workers who cannot insure pri-\nvately against unemployment risk. When international risk sharing is present, the planner\nis shielding local consumption from fluctuations in local output. After a negative produc-\ntivity shock in one country, the planner can then afford to provide more generous insurance\nand shift employment towards countries where it is more productive. Therefore, insurance\nbecomes more countercyclical.\nWe then move on to a quantitatively richer model, where we calibrate the two countries\nto the core and the periphery of the Euro area. We compute the Ramsey-optimal policy\nand compare it with a policy of constant replacement rates and no international transfers,\nas such policies are currently in place in most countries. In computing optimal policy,\nwe rule out permanent or perpetual transfers: A country can receive a transfer payment\nin response to a shock (and does not have to pay it back in the future), but transfers\nhave to average out over time and in expectation, so that no country can expect to be a\npermanent net contributor or net recipient to the scheme. In our baseline simulation, the\noptimal unemployment insurance policy is countercyclical even without transfers, and it\nbecomes more generous when a country receives a transfer. The transfers themselves are\nsizable: The periphery receives 0.70 percent of GDP for every percentage point drop in\nits own GDP, but has to transfer an almost equal amount to the core for a percentage\npoint reduction in core GDP. However, there is overall very little country-specific business\ncycle risk in the model, owing to it being calibrated to the high correlation of GDP\namong Eurozone countries. As a result, transfers are unable to reduce consumption risk\neverywhere, but rather they distribute it more evenly by shifting some risk from the highly\nvolatile periphery to the more stable core.\nA common critique to a supranational unemployment insurance is that its objectives\ncould be achieved just as well by national policies financed with government debt. We\nshow that this argument does not hold: When transfers are replaced by debt as the\ninstrument of the Ramsey planner, the stabilization gains all but disappear. The reason\nfor this is that budget deficits have to be reversed in the future, but international transfers\nonly have to average out over time. This makes them much more effective at stabilizing\nthe economy. Fiscal risk sharing works much like a fairly priced insurance policy: Even\nthough, on average, the premia and expected payments net out to zero, one is still better\nbetter off buying the insurance than taking out a bank loan in the event of \"damage\",\nbecause the loan creates a large liability when times are bad.\nOur results have one practical limitation, which is that we abstract from the politi-\ncal moral hazard induced by risk sharing (Persson and Tabellini, 1996). It is plausible\nthat a fiscal transfer mechanism reduces incentives for national governments to carry out\nstructural reforms, and this is probably the main political reason for its opposition in\nthe Eurozone. In this paper, we acknowledge this concern insofar as we rule out policies\nwith permanent transfers from one country to another. However, our main focus is on\nthe potential economic benefits rather than the political economy.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We briefly review the related\nliterature in Section 2. In Section 3, we lay out a simplified version of our model with\nonly two periods. This allows us to show our theoretical insights analytically and provide\nintuition. In Section 4, we lay out the full dynamic model that we use for quantitative\nanalysis and calibrate it to the Euro area. Section 5 contains the numerical results from our\ncalibrated model. Section 6 discusses why government debt is not an effective replacement\nfor the risk sharing achieved by our unemployment insurance scheme. Section 7 concludes.\n2 Related literature\nOur analysis relates to the literature on international risk sharing and fiscal unions on one\nhand, and the literature on the design of optimal unemployment insurance on the other\nhand.\nIt is well known that the search externality in frictional labor markets can be corrected\nusing unemployment insurance. Because of costly search, employment \u00ad and the corre-\nsponding fluctuations \u00ad may be too low or too high, depending mainly on the relation of\nthe workers' bargaining power to the matching elasticity. In the steady state, this can\nbe resolved by changing the outside option of workers through unemployment benefits\n(Hosios, 1990). When workers are risk-averse, the correction of the search externality\nneeds to be weighed against the provision of insurance (Baily, 1978). Fredriksson and\nHolmlund (2006) survey the literature on optimal unemployment insurance in static and\nsteady-state situations. More recently, interest has emerged in unemployment insurance\npolicies that depend on the state of the business cycle. Here, a central point of debate is\nwhether benefits should become more generous in a recession in order to increase insur-\nance (countercyclical policy), or less generous in order to mitigate the fall in employment\n(procyclical policy). Earlier contributions such as Kiley (2003) and Sanchez (2008) sug-\ngest that there is room for countercyclical unemployment benefits. Landais, Michaillat,\nand Saez (2015) analyze a model with sticky wages and job rationing and find that a\ncountercyclical policy is optimal as the effect of insurance on equilibrium unemployment\nis smaller in recessions. Albertini and Poirier (2015) and Kekre (2016) find that more\ngenerous unemployment insurance can mitigate the aggregate demand deficiency when\nthe zero lower bound is binding. On the other side, Mitman and Rabinovich (2015)\nnumerically compute optimal dynamic policies and show that the cyclical stance of the\nunemployment insurance is procyclical in a setting when workers' outside option leads\nto inefficiently high wages. Moyen and St\u00a8\nahler (2014) analyze the optimal cyclicality of\nbenefits holding their average level fixed. They show that there are situations in which\nunemployment insurance should be countercyclical even when wages are directly affected\nand the bargaining power of workers is too high relative to the Hosios condition.3 Jung\nand Kuester (2015) analyze first-best policy with sufficiently many fiscal instruments.\nThey find that benefits should rise in recessions if hiring subsidies and layoff taxes also\nrise at the same time. These two instruments increase the incentives to hire and decrease\nthose to fire workers, which may compensate partly for increased wage costs. However,\nif hiring subsidies and layoff taxes are not adjusted, they also find procyclical benefits to\n3Moyen and St\u00a8\nahler (2014) compare the optimal benefit duration policy in Europe and the US. In their\nEuropean calibration, the bargaining power of workers is larger than the matching efficiency, implying\nthe optimal benefit to be negative in light of the Hosios condition. However, it is restricted to be positive.\nAdditionally, rule-of-thumb households make average marginal utility of consumption fluctuate relatively\nmuch. It can be shown that steady-state benefits above optimum and relatively volatile marginal utility\nof consumption make optimal benefit policy countercyclical even when the bargaining power of workers\nis already high.\nbe optimal.\nImportantly, the literature exclusively analyzes closed economies. Our paper instead\nanalyzes optimal policy when unemployment insurance can operate across multiple coun-\ntries and faces the additional objective of sharing cross-country risk.\nTurning to the literature on fiscal unions, Leduc, Dedola, and Corsetti (2009) have\nshown that, when asset markets are incomplete, country-specific productivity disturbances\ncan have large uninsurable effects on wealth and consumption paths. In a prominent re-\ncent paper, Farhi and Werning (2012) find that such uninsurable effects may be especially\nlarge in a currency union with nominal rigidities. They suggest forming a transfer union\nto insure against this risk. Many economists follow their view that, in federal unions,\na (fiscal) transfer mechanism to at least compensate for the uninsurable effects due to\nnominal rigidities may be desirable. However, there is still some debate on how to ideally\nestablish such a transfer mechanism or a fiscal union (see Bargain, Dolls, Fuest, Neu-\nmann, Peichl, Pestel, and Siegloch, 2013 and Bordo, Markiewicz, and Jonung, 2011 for a\ndiscussion). Evers (2012) provides a quantitative assessment of federal transfer rules and\nfinds that targeting regional differences in labor income generates highest welfare gains,\nwhich primarily stem from reducing the allocative inefficiencies of factor inputs caused\nby nominal rigidities. Dmitriev and Hoddenbagh (2013) find that a tax union, in which\nthe steady state income tax are harmonized, has to be preferred to cross countries fiscal\ntransfers only if the Armington elasticity is low. Evers (2015) shows that a fiscal revenue\nequalization system, that shares nominal tax revenues, destabilizes business cycles and\nworsens welfare while a fully centralized fiscal authority does the opposite. While these\npapers have mostly focused on symmetric countries, we show, in a model calibrated to\nEurozone data, that a transfer mechanism is desirable even without nominal rigidities.\n3 Simplified model\nThe intuition for our results can best be seen in a two-period model that allows us to\nanalytically prove our results and provide a graphical representation. The model is highly\nsimplified: In particular, the real exchange rate is constant and the two countries are in\nfinancial autarky. We will relax these assumptions in the quantitative part in the next\nsection.\nThere are two countries, which we call Home and Foreign. Home is inhabited by a\nmass   (0, 1) of workers, while Foreign is inhabited by a mass 1 -  of workers.\nIn each country, firms transform labor into a homogenous consumption good (in the\nquantitative model of Section 4 we will introduce imperfect substitutability between Home\nand Foreign goods). Firms are owned by workers, but make zero profits in equilibrium.\nWhile consumption goods can be traded across countries in competitive markets, labor is\nimmobile across countries and labor markets are subject to search frictions within each\ncountry.\nIn the first period, all workers start out as unemployed. In the second period, firms\npost vacancies and are matched with workers. Production and consumption take place\nonly in the second period. Expected utility of a worker at Home in the first period is:\nU = E [nu (ce\n) + (1 - n) u (cu\nwhere ce\nis his consumption level if he turns out to be employed, and cu\nhis consumption\nlevel if he turns out to be unemployed. n is the employment level per capita in the second\nperiod.4 We assume logarithmic utility: u (c) = log (c).\nIn the second period, the number of vacancies is v and the number of matches is given\nby\nn = m\nwhere  is the tightness in the labor market. Since the initial stock of employment is zero,\nemployment in the second period equals the number of matches and market tightness\nequals the number of vacancies.\nA firm that posts a vacancy incurs a cost v\n. The probability that the vacancy is filled\nis q = m\n-\u00b5. In that case, the match produces a units of output and the worker gets paid\na wage w. This wage is determined using Nash bargaining, where the bargaining power\nof workers is denoted  (the bargaining solution is described further below). A zero-profit\ncondition for vacancy creation prescribes\nv\n= q (a - w) (3)\nWe denote by y aggregate output in the Home country net of vacancy costs:\ny = an - v\nThe productivity a is a random variable which is only revealed in the second period. The\nForeign country has a similar structure to the Home country, but with possibly different\nparameters. We denote Foreign variables with an asterisk, e.g. y for foreign output.\nHome and foreign productivity (a, a) are the only sources of aggregate uncertainty.\nEmployed workers receive wages w which are taxed at the rate , while unemployed\nworkers receive unemployment benefits b. Payroll taxes  and benefits b are administered\nby an unemployment insurance agency. We assume that the two countries are part of\nan insurance union, such that the agency operates across both countries. It has to run a\nbalanced budget with the constraint:\n [(1 - n) b - nw] + (1 - ) [(1 - n) b - nw] = 0. (5)\n3.2 Social planner problem\nWe first look at the social planner problem. A utilitarian social planner maximizes a\nweighted average of worker utilities subject only to the resource constraint and the search\n4Throughout the paper, quantities will be expressed in per capita terms unless otherwise indicated.\nfriction by solving the following problem:\nmax\n\n\nn, , ce, cu,\nn, , ce, cu\n\n\n~\nE [nu (ce\n) + (1 - n) u (cu\n)]\n) E [nu (c\nu\n) + (1 - n) u (c\nu\n)]\ns.t. n = m\nn = \nm\n (nce\n+ (1 - n) cu\n)\n+ (1 - ) (nc\ne\n+ (1 - n) c\nu\n)\n=\n (an - v\n)\n+ (1 - ) (an - \nv\n)\nHere, ~\n is the relative weight the planner puts on workers in the Home country, which\nmight be more or less than the size of its population . Within a country, all workers are\nex-ante homogenous and so weighting of individual workers is inconsequential. The first\norder conditions of the planner problem are standard:\nv\n= m\n-\u00b5 (1 - \u00b5) a\n\nv\n= \nm\n-\u00b5 (1 - \u00b5) a\ncu\n= ce\nc\nu\n= c\ne\n\n~\n\nce\n=\n\nc\ne\nThe first two conditions are the Hosios conditions in each country, which determine the\nnumber of vacancies that maximize aggregate output net of vacancy costs. The remaining\nconditions prescribe full risk sharing within and across countries. The consumption levels\nof employed and unemployed workers within each country should be identical, and each\ncountry should consume a constant fraction of union output.\n3.3 Optimal policy with private insurance\nWe now come back to the competitive equilibrium. Throughout this chapter, we assume\nsome form of international market incompleteness, since our focus is on how unemploy-\nment insurance can be used to overcome a lack of risk sharing. In this section, we allow\nworkers to only insure domestically against idiosyncratic unemployment risk. Since all\nworkers are ex-ante identical, it is optimal for a Home worker to fully diversify his risk\nby selling his entire future income in exchange for a diversified portfolio of the income of\nall other Home workers' income. In this case, the consumption levels of all Home workers\nare equalized:\nce\n= cu\nThe wage w is assumed to be set by Nash bargaining. When workers have bargaining\npower , the Nash-bargained wage is simply:\nw (a, ) =\na\nwhere  is the net replacement rate, defined as\n =\nb\nA higher replacement rate improves workers' outside option and drives up wages. It\nthereby lowers the incentives for job creation and reduces employment.\nWe want to know what the optimal unemployment insurance scheme looks like in this\nsituation. Our first result is that a transfer of resources from one country to another can be\nimplemented through the unemployment insurance system without affecting unemployment\nlevels.\nWe first note that the budget constraint of the unemployment insurance agency can\nbe rewritten as\n0 =  (c - y) + (1 - ) (c - y) . (9)\nWe can therefore choose replacement rates ,  and a transfer from the Foreign to the\nHome country T = c - y as a policy and back out the necessary benefits b, b, ,  from\nthe budget constraint. We obtain:\nb = \nnw + T\nn + (1 - n) \nw\nnw + T\nn + (1 - n) \nThe unemployment level n and the wage w depend only on policy through the replace-\nment rate . Therefore, from the formula above we can see that a positive transfer from\nForeign to Home (T > 0) can be implemented by increasing unemployment benefits b and\nat the same time lowering payroll taxes . This way, all workers get to consume more, but\nthe net replacement rate  stays constant and the relative bargaining position of workers\nis unchanged. Since we generally have n > 1 - n, most of this transfer is achieved by\nreducing the contributions by the employed. Increased benefits of the employed are only\na minor part of such a neutral transfer.\nWhile it is possible to make transfers without affecting replacement rates, is this\nalso optimal? With privately insured unemployment risk, the insurance agency has to\nmitigate three inefficiencies: search externalities in the Home and Foreign countries and\nlack of international risk sharing. It also has three policy instruments: the Home and\nForeign replacement rates and a cross-country transfer. Indeed, there exists a policy that\neliminates all three inefficiencies. The replacement rates satisfying the Hosios condition\nare\n =\n\u00b5 - \n,  =\n\u00b5 - \nThese rates do not depend on the realizations of a and a and are therefore constant.\nThey also do not depend on the planner weight ~\n. The transfer T however does depend\non this weight. In principle, one can choose any value for ~\n. We determine it by imposing\nthat transfers are zero in expectation:\nThis condition implicitly defines a value for ~\n. This choice of the weight implies that\nneither country expects to be systematically subsidizing the other country through the\nunemployment insurance system. The value of the weight is\n~\n = E [y]\nE [y + (1 - ) y]\nand the resulting transfer policy is\nT = E [y] E [y]\nE \ny + y\ny\nE [y]\n-\ny\nE [y]\nThe Home country receives a transfer when its output is below average, but has to pay a\ntransfer when output in the Foreign country is below average.\n3.4 Optimal policy without private insurance\nSo far we have abstracted from the most important objective of unemployment insurance,\nnamely to insure against unemployment. We now remove the possibility to privately\ninsure unemployment risk. In this case, the optimal policy becomes genuinely second-\nbest and trade-offs emerge between all three policy objectives: maximizing net output,\nproviding insurance between employed and unemployed, and providing insurance across\ncountries.\nWe eliminate all asset trade in Period 1 (in the quantitative model of Section 4 we\nwill allow for trade of a non-contingent bond across the border). The consumption levels\nin Period 2 are simply:\nce\ncu\n= b = ce\nThe Nash-bargained wage now takes into account the curvature in the worker's utility\nfunction. When workers have bargaining power , the bargained wage is:\nw (a, ) =\na\n - (1 - ) log \nIn this situation, the social planner allocation is no longer feasible. Providing full\ninsurance against idiosyncratic unemployment risk calls for  = 1, but then the worker\ncaptures the whole surplus (w = a) and job creation collapses to zero. We therefore have\nto solve for the (second-best) Ramsey-optimal policy as follows:\nmax\n\n\nn, , ce, ,\nn, , ce, \n\n\n~\n E [nu (ce\n) + (1 - n) u (ce\n)]\n) E [nu (c\ne\n) + (1 - n) u (c\ne\n)]\ns.t. n = m\nn = \nm\nv\n= m\n-\u00b5 (a - w (a, ))\n\nv\n= \nm\n()-\u00b5\n(a - w (a, ))\n (nce\n+ (1 - n) ce\n)\n+ (1 - ) (nc\ne\n+ (1 - n) c\ne\n)\n=\n (an - v\n)\n+ (1 - ) (an - \nv\n)\nHere, we have substituted out most equilibrium conditions. In particular, choosing an\nunemployment insurance policy (b, b, , ) subject to the insurance agency's budget con-\nstraint is equivalent to choosing replacement rates and consumption levels (, , ce\n, c\ne\n)\nsubject to the aggregate resource constraint. The benefit and transfer levels can be in-\nferred from (10)-(11) as before. Again, we choose the social planner weight ~\n such that\nany transfers made across countries net out in expectation: E [T] = 0.\nThe problem has eight choice variables and five constraints, leaving three degrees of\nfreedom. These correspond to the three policy instruments ,  and the cross-country\ntransfer T. The first order condition determining the optimal transfer is derived as:\nT = E [y] E [y]\nE \ny + y\ny\nE [y]\n-\ny\nE [y]\nThis is the exact same expression as in (15). Each country consumes a constant share of\nunion output. The Home country receives a transfer when its output is below average,\nbut has to pay a transfer when output in the Foreign country is below average. The\nadditional question here is how transfers (and all other resources) are distributed among\nthe employed and the unemployed.\nThe answer to this question is contained in the first order condition with respect to\nthe replacement rate. For the Home country, it reads as follows:\nn + (1 - n) \n- n\n\nlog  +\nn + (1 - n) \n=:I()\n= - y\n\nn\ny\ny + T\n=:H()\nwhere n\n\n= dn\nd\n\nn\nis the elasticity of Home employment with respect to the Home replace-\nment rate, and y\n\n= dy\nd\n\ny\nis the elasticity of net Home output with respect to the Home\nreplacement rate. A symmetric condition is obtained for the Foreign country. The left-\nhand side I () is the marginal benefit of insurance when raising the replacement rate, at a\nfixed quantity of output available to the country. By raising , the unemployed's marginal\nutility increases relative to average marginal utility. This is the first term on the left-hand\nside of Equation (20). At the same time, a higher  reduces employment (through higher\nwages and lower job creation), which shifts the composition of the workforce towards the\nunemployed. This means that one marginal worker suffers a utility loss, which is the\n\"log \" term in the left-hand side of Equation (20). It also implies a composition effect\non the insurance budget, captured by the remaining term on the left-hand side. The\nright-hand side H () is the marginal cost of raising the replacement rate in terms of net\noutput lost (output minus vacancy costs. This cost is where the level of transfers T enter.\nA high transfer implies that the planner is relying less on domestic production to support\nFigure 1: Optimal replacement rate.\n\nH()\nI()\ndomestic consumption, lowering the marginal cost of raising domestic output.\nThe determination of the optimal replacement rate is graphically depicted in Figure\n1, which plots the functions H () and I ().5 We can see that the insurance term I () is\npositive and only equals zero at  = 1. Intuitively, holding output constant, it is always\ndesirable to increase the replacement rate until full insurance is achieved.\nThe efficiency term H () is first negative and then turns positive, approaching infinity\nas   1. Intuitively, when  is too high, there is too little job creation and the amount\nof resources available for consumption can be increased by lowering replacement rates,\nthereby lowering bargained wages and increasing job creation. In this case y\n\ntherefore H () is positive. Conversely, when  is too low, there is too much vacancy\nposting and the amount of resources available for consumption can be increased by raising\nreplacement rates. In this case, H () is negative.\nThe optimal replacement rate lies at the intersection between the two curves. Employ-\nment is always lower than in the social planner solution where H () = 0. The marginal\nbenefit of insurance is always positive and so the optimal  is higher than what the Hosios\ncondition would call for.\nWhat happens to the replacement rate when shocks to a or a hit the economy? We\nfirst keep the ratio y/ (y + T) constant. This is the case in particular when T = 0, as in\nthe limit   1 of a closed-economy. The left panel of Figure 2 depicts the effects of a\nrecession caused by a reduction in productivity a.\nA reduction in a increases the insurance term I () and scales up the efficiency term\nH (). The intuition is as follows. A reduction in productivity reduces employment.\nHolding total resources constant, this translates into an increase in unemployment risk\nfor each worker, raising the social benefit of insurance. I () shifts up for any value of\n. At the same time, lower productivity directly reduces net output for any level of\nemployment. Therefore, the average marginal utility of increasing output towards its\nefficient level increases and H () is scaled up for any value of . The figure shows that\nthe effects of these two forces on the replacement rate work in opposite directions, so that\nthe change in  is ambiguous. This ambiguity reflects the debate in the existing literature\n5Proposition 1 in the appendix proves that the shape of the I and H curves are indeed as depicted.\nFigure 2: Change of the optimal replacement rate in a recession.\n(a) Reduction in a.\n\nH()\nI()\n(b) Increase in T.\n\nH()\nI()\nabout the cyclicality of optimal unemployment insurance in closed economies--it is not\nclear whether, in a recession, it is more important to keep output from falling or to protect\nworkers from unemployment risk.\nIn our supranational insurance scheme, however, a drop in productivity a also triggers\nan incoming transfer T. The risk sharing condition (19) prescribes that T is a decreasing\nfunction of y, in order to keep average consumption of the Home country proportional to\nunion output. The increase in T then affects the optimal replacement rate, and it is this\nrisk sharing aspect that is novel to the literature on optimal unemployment insurance.\nSpecifically, the presence of international risk sharing makes the replacement rate more\ncountercyclical. This can be seen from the optimality condition (20). When a falls, Home's\noutput will relatively low compared to union output, and T will increase. The right panel\nof Figure 2 shows that the optimal replacement rate rises as a response, introducing\na countercyclical element to the optimal policy. When transfers increase, the planner\nis relying less on domestic production to support domestic consumption, lowering the\nmarginal cost of raising domestic output. The efficiency term H () shrinks and the\ntrade-off between efficiency and insurance shifts towards the latter. The replacement rate\n rises as a result.6\nNext, the Home replacement rate is increasing in Foreign productivity a. Foreign\nproductivity only affects the Home replacement rate because of its effect on Foreign output\ny and therefore transfers to the Home country. When the Foreign country experiences\na drop in productivity, it receives a transfer and T falls. The planner is now relying\nmore on Home output relative to Foreign output, and the trade-off between efficiency\nand insurance shifts towards the former. The replacement rate  falls in order to increase\nproduction at Home.\nFinally, we can show that when a and a are independent, the optimal Home replace-\nment rate is countercyclical in the limit as   0. When the Home country is small and\nits shocks are uncorrelated with the rest of the union, its risk can be completely diversified\n6The appendix provides a formal proof.\nat the supranational level. The appendix shows that in this case, shifts of the H function\ndue to transfers (right panel of Figure 2) dominate those due to movements in productivity\n(left panel). The Home replacement rate unambiguously rises when productivity falls. It\nis worth mentioning that even in the case   0, the optimal replacement rate is not one.\nThis might seem counterintuitive as it would be costless for the union to perfectly insure\nall workers in an infinitesimally small country. But this would imply that the country re-\nceives positive transfers in all states of the world, which we have ruled out with condition\n(13). The planner weight ~\n shrinks together with  to ensure that this condition holds.\nEvery country, regardless how small, has to be self-financed in expectation, even as its\nidiosyncratic business cycle risk can be better insured.\n4 Model for quantitative analysis\nThe simple model of the previous section illustrates the relevant trade-offs involved in\nsupranational unemployment insurance. In this section, extend the model along a number\nof dimensions and calibrate it to the core and periphery of the Eurozone. We numerically\nsolve for the Ramsey-optimal policies with and without the possibility of transfers. Our\nsimulation results of the optimal policies confirm the insights from the simple model.\nWe extend the simple model in the following dimensions. First, the model is dynamic\nwith an infinite horizon, where workers transition back and forth between employment and\nunemployment. Second, we allow for variable search effort, so that unemployment benefits\naffect the labor market not only through wage bargaining but also through their effect on\nsearch effort. Third, we add imperfect substitutability between Home and Foreign goods,\nso that movements in the terms of trade can partly insure against country-specific shocks\nto production. Fourth, we add price and wage rigidities to help the quantitative fit of\nthe model, in particular the volatility of unemployment. Finally, we allow for a limited\ndegree of trade of intertemporal non-contingent bonds, so that even in the absence of\nsupranational risk sharing mechanisms agents can somewhat smooth business cycle shocks\nintertemporally.\nTime is discrete at t = 0, 1, 2, .... As before, a unit mass of workers and firms populates\nthe economy, where   (0, 1) workers live in the Home country and (1 - ) workers\nlive in the Foreign country. We will only describe the model setup in the Home country.\nThe structure of the Foreign economy is identical up to potentially different parameter\nvalues. If we need to show variables and parameters of Foreign, they will be indicated by\nan asterisk.\nAt the beginning of period t, a fraction ut\nof workers at Home are unemployed. We\nassume that labor is immobile across countries, so that workers can only search for jobs\ndomestically. The number of total new hires is determined by the number of searching\nworkers ut\n, the search effort et\n, and the number of vacancies vt\n. Workers and vacancies\nare matched according to a standard Cobb-Douglas matching function\nmt\n= m\n(et\nut\nt\nwhere m\nis a matching efficiency parameter and \u00b5 is the elasticity of matches with respect\nto unemployment. Defining labor market tightness as t\n= vt\n/et\nut\n, the probability that a\nvacancy gets filled, and the probability that a worker putting in one unit of search effort\nfinds a job, are given by qt\n= m\n-\u00b5\nt\nand ft\n= qt\nt\n. Separation occurs at the exogenous\nrate s. Unemployed workers who separate have to wait one period before they can start\nsearching again. Accordingly, the laws of motion for employment and unemployment are\ngiven by:\nnt\n+ qt\nvt\nut\nA worker can be employed or unemployed. He maximizes expected lifetime utility, defined\nrecursively as follows:\nWt\n= u (cet\n) + Et\nUt\n= u (cut\n) + Et\nwhere Wt\nis the utility of an employed worker with consumption cet\nand Ut\nis the utility of\nan unemployed worker with consumption cut\n. Unemployed workers have to exert search\neffort et+1\nat the beginning of the next period to find a job. We assume the following\nfunctional forms:\nu (c) =\nk (e) = e\nThe consumption flow cjt\n, j  {e, u} denotes expenditure on a consumption basket. This\nbasket consists of goods produced in the Home and Foreign countries and is given by:\ncjt\n= ( (cjt,H\n) + (1 - ) (cjt,F\nHere, cjt,H\nis the amount of goods consumed and produced at Home, while cjt,F\nis the\namount of goods consumed at Home but produced in Foreign. The parameter   (-, 1)\ngoverns the elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic goods, which equals\n1/ (1 - ), and the parameter  represents the relative valuation of Home goods.7\nWe abstract from international trade costs so the law of one price holds for both goods.\nWe take the Home good as the num\u00b4\neraire and let pt\nbe the relative price of Foreign goods.\n7In the case of unitary elasticity of substitution ( = 0), the consumption basket is of the Cobb-\nDouglas form cjt\n= (cjt,H\n) (cjt,F\n)1-, so that the expenditure share on Home goods is exactly . A\nsituation where  >  then corresponds to home bias in consumption.\nThus, pt\nalso represents the terms of trade of the Foreign country. Next, we define the\nconsumer price index (CPI) at Home by Pt\n= (cjt,H\n+ pt\ncjt,F\n) /cjt\n. Utility maximization\nimplies that8\ncjt,H\ncjt,F\n= pt\n\nPt\nt\nNext, we specify workers' budget constraints and the financial assets to which they have\naccess. We want to capture an incomplete market setting in which workers can neither\nobtain perfect insurance of their idiosyncratic unemployment risk nor of country-specific\nrisk. We opt for a setting in which workers do not have access to individual savings at\nall, so that they cannot insure their idiosyncratic unemployment risk. However, both\nunemployed and employed workers will own a fixed amount of shares in firms, and firms\nare able to access a non-contingent international bond. As will become clear below, this\nallows us to introduce limited intertemporal trade while escaping the need to keep track\nof the distribution of assets when solving the model.\nEmployed workers receive a wage payment wt\n(in units of Home goods), of which an\namount t\nof payroll taxes is deducted. The unemployed receive unemployment insurance\nbenefits bt\n. All workers receive an equal share of profits t\nfrom the firms in their country\nof residence. Since firms discount profits at a household rate, holding shares in firms\neffectively gives agents a form of savings through firms' intertemporal decisions, but they\ncannot save individually and must consume their per period-income, which in real terms\nreads as follows:\ncet\n= (wt\n- t\n+ t\n) /Pt\ncut\n= (bt\n+ t\n) /Pt\nThe only choice variable for workers is the search effort et\nwhen unemployed. Maximiz-\ning the utility of the unemployed with respect to effort leads to the following optimality\ncondition:\nk (et\n) = ft\n(Wt\n- Ut\nWe assume that production is divided into a final and an intermediate goods sector,\nwith the latter being subject to search frictions. Each country produces a distinct final\ngood from domestic intermediates. Intermediate producers operate under monopolistic\ncompetition and are able to set prices.\nMore precisely, at Home there is a representative final good producer which purchases\na variety of differentiated intermediate goods, bundles these into a final good and sells\nthe latter as a price taker. The price of the Home country's final good is the same in\n8Having normalized the price of the Home good to one, note that Pt\nis Home CPI relative to Home\nPPI. It correspondingly holds that P\nt\nis Foreign CPI expressed relative to goods produced in Home. We\nwill, hence, express all Foreign variables relative to the price of goods produced in Home.\nboth countries and equal to one (the price for the good produced in Foreign is equal to\npt\n). The maximization problem of the representative retail firm reads\nmax\n{~\nyt(j):j[0,]}\nYt\n-\n\n^\n\n~\npt\n(j)yt\nwhere ~\npt\n(j) is the price of a specific variety j, and\nYt\n=\n\n^\n\nyt\n(j)( -1)/ dj\nis the final goods producer's production function. yt\n(j) is the final goods producer's\ndemand for the differentiated input j  [0, ]. The first-order condition for each input\nreads:\nyt\n(j) = (~\npt\n(j))- Yt\nCombining the latter with (32) and the zero profit condition, we obtain the producer price\nindex in the home country and normalize it to one:\n\n^\n\n~\npt\nNow, each intermediate producer operates the following technology:\nyt\n(j) = at\nnt\nwhich is linear in labor, and at\nis a productivity shock common to all firms. Employment\nis subject to search frictions. Firm j needs to post a number of vacancies vt\n(j), each of\nwhich leads to successful matching with a worker with probability qt\n. The vacancy filling\nrate is taken as given by the firm. Successful matches start production in the next period.\nFurthermore, firm j needs to pay its workers a wage wt\n(j), and it needs to pay a cost\nfor each vacancy, which takes the form of a constant quantity v\nof domestically produced\ngoods. Following Arseneau and Chugh (2007), the firm faces a quadratic cost of adjusting\nreal wages.9For each of its workers, the real cost of changing wages between period t - 1\nand t is\nw\nwt\n(j)\n(j)\n=\nw\n(wt\nwhere wt\n(j) = wt\n(j) is the gross real wage growth rate. The wage itself is\ndetermined through Nash bargaining, as described below. The firm can further save in\nnon-contingent international bonds dt\n(j) which pay a gross interest Rt\n, subject to portfolio\nadjustment cost d\nt\n(j), as is standard in the international economics literature (e.g.\nBenigno, 2009). Given that firms operate in monopolistic competition and the fact that\nfirms also set the price ~\npt\n(j) for their goods variety j, we assume that they also face\nRotemberg price adjustment costs that are similar to wage adjustment costs described\nabove, with p\nbeing the cost parameter. Finally, the firm has to pay a fixed cost F every\n9As pointed out by these authors, we adopted this assumption as cost of nominal wage adjustment do\nnot help increasing significantly the volatility of unemployment.

Technology and govern-\nment spending shocks are independent of each other, but we do allow for correlation of\nthe Home and Foreign technology and government spending shocks, respectively.\nWe require the autoregressive coefficients to be less than one to rule out permanent\nshocks. This choice is not innocuous in its policy implications. The first best allocation\nin our model would completely shield domestic consumption from domestic employment\nand instead tie it to union output. In the presence of permanent shocks that differentially\naffect the long-run level of GDP in each country, this would effectively prescribe perma-\nnent transfers from the country with higher per capita income to the one with lower per\ncapita income, and the Ramsey-optimal policy would then implement this prescription\nby permanent fiscal transfers. We do not see much practical relevance in such an extreme\nform of risk sharing and therefore focus exclusively on cyclical shocks. Any cross-country\ntransfers under the Ramsey planner will always fall back to zero in expectation.\nWhen we characterize optimal unemployment insurance policies, we define \"optimal\" to\nbe maximizing a utilitarian welfare function:\nE [~\n (nt\nWt\n) Ut\n) + (1 - ~\n) (n\nt\nW\nt\nt\n) U\nt\nWe solve for Ramsey-optimal policies involving the replacement rates t\n, \nt\nas well as a\ntransfer policy of the supranational agency, defined as\nTt\n) bt\n- nt\nt\nUnless stated otherwise, we implement transfer policies by setting bxt\n= Tt\n, b\nxt\n=\n/ (1 - ) Tt\n/pt\n, and xt\n= \nxt\n= 0. This is without loss of generality: For any other\nset of policies bxt\n, bgt\n, xt\n, gt\n, b\nxt\n, b\ngt\n, \nxt\n, \ngt\n, one can define Tt\nas above and set b\nxt\n= Tt\n,\nb\ngt\n= bgt\n+ bxt\n- Tt\n, \nxt\ngt\n= gt\n+ xt\netc. and achieve exactly the same allocation, as\nthe budget constraints of the public sector can be consolidated from a planner perspective.\nAs in the simple model, we choose the welfare weight on the Home country ~\n to rule\nout permanent transfers from one country to another:\nE [Tt\nWe also compute what we call a \"no-transfer\" Ramsey problem. There, we keep the\nplanner weight ~\n at the value imposed by condition (56), but now impose Tt\n= 0, so that\nthe Ramsey planner is left with the Home and Foreign replacement rates as instruments.\nComparing the \"full\" and the \"no-transfer\" Ramsey solutions will allow us to isolate the\ninteraction effect of transfers and unemployment insurance policies.\nWe calibrate the model to the Eurozone, where we identify the Home country with six Eu-\nrozone core countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Finland, France, Luxemburg, Nether-\nlands) and the Foreign country with six periphery countries (Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy,\nPortugal). In what follows, we use the term \"country\" in the model sense and use the\nwords \"Home\"/\"Foreign\" and \"Core\"/\"Periphery\" interchangeably. Our calibration is\nsummarized in Table 1.\nThe number of workers in the Home country is set to 60 percent, which corresponds\nto the relative size of the labor force in the Core. We set the discount factor  in both\ncountries to the standard value of 0.99 which yields an annual real interest rate of 4 per\ncent. The curvature of consumption  in both countries is set to 1.5 as reported in Smets\nand Wouters (2003). The parameter  in both countries is set to 0.744, implying an\nelasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign goods of 3.9 matching the European\naverage of estimates reported in Corbo and Osbat (2013). Given that value, we calculate\nvalues for the home good preferences ,  to match a GDP-weighted average of domestic\nexpenditure shares of 85 percent as estimated in Balta and Delgado (2009), and ensuring\nthat the relative price of foreign goods in steady state equals p = 1. The inverse elasticities\nof search effort ,  are chosen to match the estimate in Meyer (1990) of an elasticity\nof unemployment duration with respect to the level of benefits of 0.9. The effort scaling\nparameters e\n, \ne\nare set to normalize steady state effort in each country to unity.\nWe set the matching elasticity \u00b5 to the conventional value 0.5 according to estimates\nby Burda and Wyplosz (1994). The bargaining power of workers  is set at 0.9. As\nobserved by Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008), workers need to capture a high share of\nthe match surplus for a search model to reproduce the volatility of unemployment in the\nTable 1: Calibrated parameter values.\nParameter Symbol Core Periphery\nElasticity param. on Home/Foreign goods  0.744\nEffort cost scaling parameter e\nMatching elasticity  0.5\nWorker bargaining power  0.9\nMatching efficiency m\nVacancy costs v\nPrice adjustment cost p\nElasticity of subst. for intermediates 4.3\nWage adjustment cost w\nPortfolio adjustment cost d\nNet replacement rate \u00af\nCoefficient on inflation \nCoefficient on output growth y\nInterest rate smoothing R\nSteady-state TFP level \u00af\nAutocorrelation of TFP A\nStd. dev. of TFP shock  (a\nCorr. of TFP shock H/F  (a\n, \na\nSteady-state level of govt. spending \u00af\nAutocorrelation of spending g\nStd. dev. of spending shock  (g\nCorr. of spending shock H/F  g\n, \ng\nTable 2: Targeted moments.\nMoment Core Periphery Source\nCorr. of unemployment (filtered) 0.510 OECD\nprivate and government expenditure.

This holds true even in the presence of the wage rigidities we impose here.11\nThe matching efficiencies m\n, \nm\n; separation rates s, s; and vacancy costs v\n, \nv\nare\nset in each country to jointly match an average quarterly vacancy-filling probability of 70\npercent (Christoffel et al., 2009), a quarterly job finding rate of 30% (Elsby, Hobijn, and\nPeriphery.

This leads to a steady-state markup of\nintermediate good producers of 30 percent and a Phillips curve that has the same slope\ncoefficient on marginal cost as a corresponding Phillips curve with price rigidities \u00b4\na la\nCalvo with an average price duration of two quarters. This value is lower than what\nis common in the literature; stronger price rigidities would imply that unemployment\nrises after positive technology shocks because of the associated fall in markups. This is a\ncommon problem in New-Keynesian models with search frictions (see for example Gertler,\nSala, and Trigari, 2008). We do, however, allow for substantial wage rigidity and set the\nwage adjustment costs w\n, \nw\nto match the volatility of (HP-filtered) unemployment rates\nin each country.\nMonetary policy is described by a simple Taylor rule with a coefficient of inflation\n11Many ways have been proposed to address the fact that the standard search and matching model\nfails, for a standard calibration, to account for the cyclical properties of unemployment and vacancies,\nthe so called \"Shimer puzzle\" (Shimer, 2005). Contributing to this debate is beyond the scope of our\npaper.\n12Doing so avoids the problem of ending up with a negative replacement rate in the Ramsey solution.\nSince we are setting a high bargaining power for workers, the Ramsey planner tends to undo this bar-\ngaining power with a lower replacement rate. Without the fixed cost F, it is possible to set a negative\nreplacement rate (i.e. a tax on unemployment instead of an insurance) because unemployed workers can\nstill consume a positive amount of profits.\nof \n= 1.5, a coefficient on output growth of y\n= 0.5, and an interest rate smoothing\ncoefficient of R\n= 0.85.

The steady-\nstate levels of government spending \u00af\ng are set to match the share of government spending\nin GDP government spending process is parametrized to match detrended government\nexpenditure data.\nThe Eurozone-specific moments we target are summarized in Table 2. The Periphery\ncontributes about 40 percent of the EZ-12 labor force, but only about 35 percent of\nreal GDP. It also has a higher volatility of GDP and unemployment. Nevertheless, our\ncalibration features a higher degree of wage rigidity in the core than in the periphery. This\nis because the relative standard deviation of unemployment to output is actually higher\nin the core, so that for a shock of a given size unemployment has to rise more in the core,\nwhich is achieved by setting a higher degree of wage rigidity. Finally, the periphery has a\nhigher average unemployment rate, but a less generous unemployment insurance system\nas measured by net replacement rates, which in our calibration translates into a higher\ncalibrated value for the separation rate.\nWe now present the results from our numerical simulations. We first confirm that our\ncalibration of the status quo produces second moments that are close to the data. We then\ncompute Ramsey-optimal unemployment insurance policies, and also calculate optimal\npolicy without transfers, i.e. imposing that Tt\n= 0 holds at all times. Even without\ntransfers, we find that optimal replacement rates are countercyclical in the model. With\nregards to transfers, we confirm our predictions from the simple model: Replacement\nrates rise when a country receives a transfer, so the generosity of unemployment insurance\nbecomes more countercyclical in the presence of transfers. Nevertheless, the impact of\ntransfers on output and unemployment rates is relatively minor, indicating that transfers\ncan be implemented through the unemployment insurance system without causing large\ndistortions in labor markets. We then explore how our results differ under alternative\nscenarios.\nTable 3 summarizes key second moments of our calibrated model. The standard devia-\ntions of real GDP and unemployment in each country are targeted by the calibration. The\nstandard deviation of consumption is higher than in the data. This is an outcome of the\nfact that our model does not include capital and has a sizable share of output absorbed\nTable 3: Second order moments in benchmark calibration.\nVariable s.d. s.d. rel. to\ndom.

Corresponding moment in OECD data in brackets where available\nconsumption expenditure, and real wages are taken as manufacturing wages divided by CPI.\nby a relatively stable government expenditure process. We see this outcome as an accept-\nable cost of simplification, but the gains from stabilization might therefore be somewhat\noverstated. The standard deviation of wages, by contrast, is reasonable. The bottom row\nalso reports statistics on the Home trade balance as a percentage of domestic GDP. The\nstandard deviation is of a realistic magnitude. This implies that even in the absence of\ncross-country fiscal transfers, households are able to smooth international consumption\nrisk to some extent through savings in the bond market.\nThe contemporaneous correlations with GDP are close to the data, with the excep-\ntion of real wages. Our HP-filtered wage series display very little correlation with filtered\noutput. As for the cross-correlations across countries, the cross-correlation of unemploy-\nment is targeted by the calibration, and that of output and wages is within reasonable\nrange. But the correlation of real consumption across countries is very close to one. Our\nmodel therefore suffers from the Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992) consumption cor-\nrelation puzzle, overstating the amount of international risk sharing present in the data.\nAddressing the puzzle will likely strengthen our results.\nWe now compute Ramsey-optimal policies with and without transfers and confirm our\npredictions from the simple model about the cyclicality of policy instruments. The results\nare summarized in Table 4.\nThe left half of the table documents the standard deviations of optimal replacement\nrates and transfers and their correlation with output. The standard deviations of re-\nplacement rates are relatively large, around three percentage points. Remarkably, all\nTable 4: Cyclicality of the Ramsey-optimal unemployment insurance.\nsummary statistics: bivariate regression:\ns.d. corr. with\ndom.

Regression coefficients are obtained from regress-\ning each row variable simultaneously on the log of Home and Foreign real GDP.\nreplacement rates are countercyclical. Transfers to the Foreign country as a percentage\nof Foreign GDP are also large and countercyclical. In the Foreign country, replacement\nrates are more volatile and more negatively correlated when the planner has access to\ntransfers than without transfers (Tt\n= 0 imposed). However, in the Home country the\nopposite pattern can be observed.\nHowever, looking at correlation coefficients does not say much about the behavior\nof policy because it does not say by how much replacement rates change in response to\neconomic conditions. Moreover, GDP across the two countries is highly correlated, and so\ncorrelation coefficients mask differences in policy reactions to shocks originating at Home\nand in Foreign.\nFor these reasons, our preferred measures of the cyclicality of optimal policy are the\ncoefficients from bivariate regressions of replacement rates and transfers to Home and\nForeign GDP. These are shown in the right half of Table 4, and they clearly confirm our\npredictions from the simple model. On average, when Home GDP rises by one percent,\nreplacement rates fall by 1.37 percentage points in the Home country with transfers.\nWithout transfers, they only fall by 1.08 percentage points. Foreign replacement rates rise\nby 0.83 percentage points in the presence of transfers, compared to only 0.15 percentage\npoints without transfers. The Foreign country also receives, on average, a transfer of\n0.69 percent of its GDP when GDP at Home rises by one percent. The same patterns\nappear in response to changes in Foreign GDP: Replacement rates are countercyclical\nwith respect to domestic GDP and procyclical with respect to GDP abroad, and this\ncyclicality becomes stronger in the presence of transfers.\nTo further illustrate these results, we compare impulse response functions to a negative\nproductivity shock in the periphery in Figure 3 (the patterns are qualitatively similar for a\nshock in the core). Specifically, we contrast the optimal Ramsey planner response with the\nno-transfer Ramsey solution and the status quo policy (no transfers, constant replacement\nrates). The upper panel of the figure depicts the four direct policy instruments: Home and\nForeign benefits bt\n, b\nt\nand Home and Foreign payroll taxes t\n, \nt\n. These can be mapped\ninto the replacement rates and transfer policies, but we want to highlight how variations\nin these policy variables are implemented by the planner. After a negative productivity\nFigure 3: Impulse responses, negative Foreign productivity shock.\n(a) Policy instruments.\nBenefits (H)\nRamsey\nRamsey (no transfers)\nstatus quo\nBenefits (F)\nTaxes (H)\nTaxes (F)\n(b) Aggregate outcomes.\nUnemployment (H)\nConsumption (H)\nTrade balance (H)\nUnemployment (F)\nConsumption (F)\nTransfer (F)\nImpulse response functions to a one standard deviation negative productivity shock in Foreign.\nBenefits, taxes, GDP and consumption are in percent deviation from the steady state.

Trade balance (H) is in percent of Home real\nGDP and transfer (F) is in percent of Foreign real GDP.\nshock in the periphery, the Ramsey planner (solid red line) implements a transfer from\nthe core to the periphery. It does so by increasing unemployment benefits in the periphery\nand at the same time cutting payroll taxes, and effecting the opposite pattern in the core.\nBenefits drop below their initial level after six quarters in order to make the increase\nin unemployment dissipate more quickly, while taxes stay low for a long time. A large\ntransfer finds its way to the economy mainly by a reduction in payroll taxes which affect\nmost of the population, rather than benefits which only affect only the relatively few\nunemployed workers. When the planner does not have access to transfers (blue dashed\nline), the behavior of the instruments is markedly different. In the core, benefits and\ntaxes stay mostly flat after the shock. The level of benefits still rises in the periphery, but\nthis time the increase in benefits has to be financed by higher taxes. In the status quo\ncalibration with constant replacement rates, taxes also increase even though the level of\nbenefits barely moves. This is because unemployment increases markedly and persistently,\nand more recipients of benefits and fewer payroll contributors necessitate a higher level\nof contributions to balance the national unemployment insurance budget.\nThe lower panel of the figure depicts the aggregate outcomes under the different poli-\ncies. The responses of GDP and unemployment in the core are barely affected, but there\nare marked differences in the periphery where the shock hits. The Ramsey planner man-\nages to stabilize GDP and unemployment with respect to the status quo policy. However,\nthe response of these variables is nearly identical whether the planner can make use of\ncross-country transfers or not. This result obtains despite the fact that the transfer is\nsizable--0.28 percent of Foreign GDP at its peak--and underscores our prediction that\ntransfers can be channeled through the unemployment insurance system without distort-\ning labor market outcomes.\nOf course, transfers have a stabilizing function on consumption. Compared to the sta-\ntus quo, the planner without access to transfers already manages to stabilize consumption\nin both countries by reducing the size of unemployment fluctuations. Still, consumption\ndrops by more in the periphery where the shock originates. Transfers even out the burden\nof reducing consumption, raising it in the periphery and reducing it in the core. Finally,\nthe figure also depicts the response of the core trade balance. It is positive under all\nthree policies, reflecting the fact that the periphery runs a current account deficit to pri-\nvately smooth out the drop in consumption. It does so by taking up debt. However,\nnon-contingent debt is not the same as full risk sharing and the planner can improve on\nthis allocation. The transfer of course results in an even larger trade balance.\nHow important are the stabilization gains? We measure stabilization in terms of the\nreduction in the variances of consumption and unemployment , documented in Table 5.\nColumn (1) shows the standard deviations of unfiltered (log) consumption and unemploy-\nment in both countries at the status quo policy. Column (2) shows the same statistics at\nthe Ramsey policy without transfers. The Ramsey planner can achieve a reduction of at\nleast 20 percent in the volatility of consumption and at least 45 percent in the volatility of\nunemployment by adjusting national replacement rates alone. In Column (3), the planner\ncan additionally pool the unemployment insurance systems at the supranational level. In\nthat case, it achieves additional stabilization in the periphery: unemployment volatility\ndrops three percent, and consumption volatility drops 26 percent. In the core however,\nthe volatility of unemployment and consumption increase by 4 percent and 24 percent,\nrespectively, although they remain lower than under the status quo.\nTable 5: Gains from stabilization.\ns.d. % status quo Ramsey (no transfers) Ramsey Debt\nStandard deviations from simulated model data, unfiltered. Consumption is in logarithms.\nWhy is the planner not able to stabilize consumption in both countries? The answer is\nthat business cycles in the model are highly correlated, owing to the calibration. There is\nrelatively little country-specific risk that can be reduced through diversification. Instead,\nthe planner is implementing transfers to shift risk from the periphery to the relatively\nmore stable core. As a result, the standard deviations of consumption in the core and\nthe periphery move closer to each other. The policy distributes risk more evenly across\nthe two countries, but it is not a Pareto-improvement over the no-transfer policy: The\ncore would be better off without transfers. We conjecture that a Pareto improvement\ncould be achieved by a perpetual steady-state payment from the periphery to the core as\na compensation for the added risk. But this is ruled out by our requirement that transfers\nbe zero in expectation. We think that this point has not been appreciated in the existing\nliterature: A fiscal risk sharing mechanism in the Eurozone is likely to be detrimental\nto the more stable economies of the core even when permanent transfers are ruled out\nby design, simply because risk is perpetually shifted from more volatile to more stable\n5.3 Alternative scenarios\nHow sensitive are our results to the calibration? Our main qualitative result--transfers\nmake optimal unemployment insurance more countercyclical--hold up for any reasonable\nparametrization of the model, but the quantitative results are sensitive to several param-\neters. Table 6 computes the cyclicalities of optimal policy under a variety of alternative\nassumptions on the parameters.\nColumn (1) repeats the baseline calibration regression coefficients from Table 4. In\nColumn (2), the Home population share is increased to  = 0.8. This scenario implies that\nthe size of the Foreign country is roughly that of Spain within the Eurozone. Compared to\nthe baseline, the Home replacement rate becomes less countercyclical, Foreign replacement\nrates more countercyclical, and Foreign transfers become larger. These results are fully\nin line with the predictions from our simplified model: A smaller country can be better\ninsured by the union, and the countercylical effect of risk sharing on replacement rates\nbecomes stronger.\n13Our calibration to only two regions might understate the amount of diversifiable business cycle risk.\nAt the single country level, the component of risk that is diversifiable across the union is certainly\nlarger, so that it might be possible to reduce consumption volatility in every country with appropriate\nrisk-sharing policies.\nTable 6: Sensitivity of optimal policy to alternative scenarios.\nbivariate regression coefficients Baseline  = 0.8 A = 0 \u00af\nu = \u00af\nReplacement\nrate, Home\nReplacement\nrate, Foreign\nTransfer, Foreign,\nRegression coefficients are obtained from regressing each row variable simultaneously on the log of Home\nand Foreign real GDP.\nIn Column (3), the variance of Foreign productivity shocks is set to A\n= 0, so that\nalmost all output fluctuations come from shocks originating in the Home country. This\nscenario isolates the policy reaction to country-specific shocks, which arere not clearly\nvisible in the baseline because of the high correlation of shocks. The cyclicalities of\nreplacement rates and transfers increase everywhere.\nIn Column (4), the steady-state unemployment rate in the Foreign country is \u00af\nu re-\nduced to the value to that in the Home country \u00af\nu. This scenario can be thought of as the\nimplementation of labor market reforms in the Eurozone periphery that reduce structural\nunemployment. As a result, replacement rates become more countercyclical in the Home\ncountry and less countercyclical in the Foreign country, while the magnitude of transfers\nis roughly unchanged. Intuitively, when \u00af\nu falls, Foreign GDP becomes less volatile and\nits share in total GDP rises, meaning that the core will insure less risk of the periphery.\nReplacement rates become less countercyclical in the less well-insured Foreign country,\nwhile the opposite happens in the Home country.14\nIn Column (5), the elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign goods is set\nclose to unity. This scenario puts the economy close to the case studied in Cole and\nObstfeld (1991) where movements in the terms of trade achieve perfect risk sharing even\nunder financial autarky. In line with their finding, the size of optimal transfers is now\nclose to zero. The replacement rates become more procyclical as a result.\nMost other parameters of the model have little impact on the quantitative results.\nFor example, the choice of the bargaining weight  is crucial to match the volatility of\nunemployment in the model, but does not affect optimal policy. In Column (6), we set\n = \u00b5 so as to bring the model closer to the Hosios (1990) condition. The changes to the\ncoefficients in the table are relatively small and there is no clear pattern in the change of\ncyclicality. Similar results obtain when varying other parameters.\nLikewise, the degree of nominal price rigidities has little impact on the optimal policy.\nFigure 4 plots the bivariate regression coefficients on the optimal policy instruments as a\nfunction of the Rotemberg price rigidity parameter p\n. The dotted line marks the baseline\nvalue of p\n= 6.601. This is at the lower end of values used in the literature, as discussed\nabove. But a lower or higher value for p\ndoes little change to the cyclicality of the Home\n14A similar result obtains when the degree of wage rigidity in the Foreign country \nw\nis reduced.\nFigure 4: Sensitivity of optimal policy to price rigidities.\nReplacement rate (H)\np\nReplacement rate (F)\nTransfer/GDP (F)\nGDP (H), no trans.\nGDP (F), no trans.\nRegression coefficients obtained from regressing each row variable simultaneously on the log of Home and\nForeign real GDP, as a function of the parameter p\n(common across both countries), for the Ramsey-\noptimal policy with and without transfers. The black dotted line represents the baseline calibration value\np\nreplacement rate. It has some effect on the response of the Foreign replacement rate to\nchanges in Home GDP (red lines in the middle panel of the figure): Larger price rigidities\ninduce the Foreign replacement rate rise less, on average, when Home GDP rises. Still,\nthe qualitative conclusion of more countercyclical replacement rates in the presence of\ntransfers is unaffected by the size of price rigidities. 15 What's more surprising is that\neven the transfer policy is little changed as p\nvaries. The inefficiencies caused by the\npresence of a currency union and nominal rigidities emphasized by Farhi and Werning\n(2012) seem to be quantitatively unimportant compared with the other financial market\nimperfections in the model.\n6 The difference between debt and insurance\nIn writing this paper, we frequently encountered the argument that a fiscal risk sharing\nmechanism without permanent transfers would be no different from using government\ndebt to run countercyclical deficits. Here, we show that this argument does not hold. Our\nfiscal risk sharing mechanism works like a fairly priced insurance policy: Even though on\naverage, the premia and expected payments net out to zero, one is still better better off\nbuying the insurance than taking out a bank loan in the event of damage.\nWe modify our quantitative model to introduce national government debt. All debt is\ndenominated in nominal terms in the common currency of the two countries. The budget\nconstraint (43) of the Home government is modified as follows:\ngt\n+ ut\nbgt\n= gt\nnt\n+ dgt\n-\nd\ngt\npt\nNote that national governments face the same quadratic portfolio adjustment costs\n15This finding is in line with Kekre (2016) who finds that optimal unemployment insurance is affected\nby nominal rigidities and the ensuing demand externalities only when the zero lower bound on interest\nrates is binding.\nFigure 5: Debt is not the same as insurance.\nConsumption (H)\nRamsey\n(no transfers)\nConsumption (F)\nTrade balance (H)\nTransfer (F)\n(debt)\nImpulse responses to a one-standard deviation negative Foreign productivity shock.\nas the private sector. If this were not the case, the primary use of government would be\nto replace frictional private borrowing with frictionless public borrowing. The Foreign\ngovernment similarly can similarly issue debt d\ngt\n. The clearing condition (51) in the bond\nmarket is modified to read:\n- dgt\n) + (1 - ) pt\nd\nt\n- d\ngt\nWe then compute the Ramsey-optimal policies where the planner does not have access\nto cross-country transfers Tt\nbut can instead optimally choose the national government\ndebt levels dgt\nand d\ngt\n. As before, the planner can also choose the national replacement\nrates t\n, \nt\n. From a welfare perspective, the value of the Ramsey problem with debt is\nbounded from above by that with transfers, and from below by the value of that with\nnationally balanced budgets.\nIt turns out that the planner is not able to distribute risk very effectively with debt.\nThis can be seen immediately from Column (4) in Table 5: The values for the volatility\nof consumption in particular are very close to those without transfers (Column 2).\nIn Figure 5, we plot impulse responses after a negative country-specific productivity\nshock in the periphery, comparing the full Ramsey solution, the solution with debt, and\nthe solution with nationally balanced budgets (labeled \"no transfers\"). It is immediately\nclear that the solution with debt is very close to the solution with balanced budgets. The\ndrop in consumption is minimally shifted from Foreign to Home, which is reflected in a\nslightly higher trade balance. It is not advantageous for the planner to move resources\nfrom Home to Foreign with debt, and the reason is of course that debt has to be repaid.\nThe rightmost graph in Figure 5, labeled \"Transfer (F)\", depicts the budget deficit of the\nForeign government in the solution with debt. This is the closest correspondence to the\nsupranational transfers in the full Ramsey solution, which are also plotted. The planner\ndoes run a budget deficit in the periphery after the shock, but the optimal size of the\ndeficit is only about 0.08 percent of GDP at the peak, since it will have to be repaid\neventually (in the graph, starting four years after the shock). By contrast, when the\nplanner has access to transfers the stabilization gains are much larger, despite the fact\nthat transfers are temporary and equal zero in expectation. With debt, any \"transfer\" has\nto be repaid with certainty at some point in the future; with fiscal risk sharing, transfers\nonly have to average out over time.\n7 Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have used an international business cycle model with frictional labor\nmarkets and incomplete financial markets to discuss optimal unemployment insurance\npolicy operating across multiple countries. Theoretically, the possibility to set different\npolicies across countries augments the classic policy trade-off between efficient employ-\nment and insurance of unemployment risk with a concern for international risk-sharing.\nWe have shown that cross-country insurance through the unemployment insurance system\ncan in principle be achieved without affecting unemployment levels; and that the desir-\nability of international risk sharing introduces a countercyclical element to the optimal\nunemployment insurance policy.\nCalibrated to Eurozone core and periphery, our two-country model implied that opti-\nmal replacement rates are countercyclical even from a national perspective without trans-\nfers. Adding transfers markedly increased this countercyclicality, and the optimal trans-\nfers were found to be sizeable (about 0.7 percent of GDP following a one percentage point\ndecrease in GDP). However, we also found that, due to the high correlation of business\ncycles across the Eurozone, there is very limited scope to diversify risk. Instead, the opti-\nmal planner policy mainly implied a shift of consumption risk from the periphery to the\ncore in order to distribute it more evenly.\nThere is one important direction in which our findings could be extended in further\nresearch. The optimal policy we compute here is one in which the planner has perfect\nknowledge of the structure of the economy. One of the most difficult issues in implementing\na policy such as the one in this paper is that the structural rate of unemployment can\nonly be reliably estimated in hindsight, if at all. It would be useful to see whether\nsimple policy rules that are more easily implementable under imperfect information can\nreasonably approximate the optimal policy.\nAppendix: Propositions for Section 1\nThe optimal replacement rate in the absence of private risk sharing satisfies Equation (19)\nin the main text:\nn + (1 - n) \n- n\n\nlog  +\nn + (1 - n) \n=:I()\n= - y\n\nx\nn\n=:H()\nwhere x = y/ (y + T) is the income to consumption ratio of the Home country. Here, we\nprove the properties of the optimal policy as discussed in the text. Throughout, we make\nthe following assumption:\nAssumption 1. I is strictly concave, H and Hy are strictly convex in  given x.\nWe numerically verified for a wide range of parameters. The limit behavior of the\nfunctions at the corners is easy to prove and together with our assumption determines\nthe shape of the curves in the main text.\nn\n\u00af\nn\nwhere \u00af\nn = m\nm\nv\na\nand I (1) = 0. Also, we have\n\u00b5\n\n= +, and H () strongly convex given x.\nProof. We start with the insurance term I (). At the limit when   0, we have w  0\nand n = m\nm\nv\n(a - w)\n \u00af\nn. Therefore:\nn + (1 - n) \n-\nn\n\u00af\nn\n.\nThe remaining term of I () must therefore go to zero. Indeed,\nn\n\n=\ndn\nd\n\nn\n= -\na\na - w\n\u00b5\n\n=\nlog \n\u00b5\n\n - (1 - ) log \nand therefore\nn\n\nlog  +\nn + (1 - n) \n=\n\u00b5\n\n - (1 - ) log \nn + (1 - n) \nlog \nFor the case   1, the first term clearly disappears:\nn + (1 - n) \nand for the second term, we have:\n\u00b5\n\n - (1 - ) log \nn + (1 - n) \nlog \n-\n\u00b5\nlog \nTurn now to the efficiency term H (). As   0, n  \u00af\nTherefore\n- y\n\nx\nn\n= -\nx\nn\nw\na\n\n+\n\u00b5\nlog \nAnd as   1, w  1 and n  0+, so that\n-\nx\nn\nw\na\n\n+\n\u00b5\nlog \n- +.\nProposition 2. The optimal replacement rate is unique and strictly between exp \u00b5\n\nand one.\nProof. Since f () = H () - I () is continuous on [0, 1] and a strictly concave by our\nassumption, it crosses zero at most twice. But f (0) > 0 and lim\n- , so there is a\nunique interior solution  to f () = 0. Since I (0) > I (1) = 0 and I is strictly concave,\nI () > 0  (0, 1) and the optimum has H () > 0. Since H is a strictly convex\nH () = + and , H (0\n) = 0 for exactly one 0\n. Finally, H exp \u00b5\n\nProposition 3. The optimal replacement rate is strictly decreasing in x.\nProof. Taking the total derivative of the optimality condition with respect to x, we have\nI\nx\n-\nH\nx\n+\nI\n\nd\ndx\n-\nH\n\nd\ndx\n\nd\ndx\n= -\nI\nx\n- H\nx\nI\n\n- H\n\n.\nClearly, dI/dx = 0 and at the optimal , we have dH/dx = H () /x > 0. Furthermore,\nwe know that I (0) > H (0) and I () = H () for exactly one value of , so it must be\nthe case that dH/d > dI/d at the optimal . Therefore d/dx < 0.\nThis result shows in particular that the replacement rate is increasing in foreign pro-\nductivity a , since an increase in a raises y and therefore decreases x.\nFinally, we are going to establish countercyclicality of  in the limit case when Home\ncountry becomes very small, and when a and a are independent.\nProposition 4. In the limit as   0, the optimal replacement rate is unique, strictly\nbelow one, and strictly decreasing in a.\nProof. As   0, the risk sharing condition (19) becomes\nx = E [y]\nE [y]\ny\ny\n.\nThe optimal choice of  when x is chosen optimally can now be described as\nI () = ~\nH ()\nwhere ~\nH () = - y\n\nn\nE [y]\nE [y]\ny\ny\n.\nBy our assumption, ~\nH () is a strictly convex function. The value of ~\nH at zero is\n~\nE [y]\nwn\ny\nFor the limit at one, we note\n~\nH () E [y]\nE [y]\ny = -\na\n\n+\n\u00b5\nlog \n- +\nsince w  a as   1. Therefore, the optimal  when y/c is chosen optimally has the same\nproperties that we used before holding x constant. In particular, the optimal replacement\nrate is unique and strictly below one. Also, we have d ~\nH/d > dI/d at the optimal  as\nin Proposition (3). Taking the total derivative again, we have\nd\nda\n= -\nI\na\n-  ~\nH\na\nI\n\n-  ~\nH\n\nwhere the denominator of the fraction is negative, so d/da has the same sign as I\na\n-  ~\nH\na\n.\nThe derivatives of I and ~\nH with respect to productivity a are:\nI\na\n=\nI\nn\nn\na\n=\nn\na\nn + (1 - n) \na\n\u00b5\nlog \n-\nand\n ~\nH\na\n=\n~\nH\na\nTherefore d/da < 0.\nThe last two propositions combined establish the final result of Section 3. A decline\nin a raises , and at the same time output y falls. An increase in a also raises , and the\nlower replacement rate causes y to fall. Therefore, the replacement rate is countercyclical\nconditional on either productivity. Independence of the productivities then implies that\nit is also countercyclical overall.\nReferences\nAlbertini, J. and A. Poirier (2015, October). Unemployment Benefit Extension at the\nAndor, L.
