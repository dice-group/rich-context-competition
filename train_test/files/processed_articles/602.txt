RCMAR goals include\nimproving measurement of the health and well-being of underrepresented and disad-\nvantaged populations and strengthening the design of interventions targeted at reducing\nhealth inequities between racial and ethnic groups, particularly those that manifest at\nolder ages. During a RCMAR-sponsored preconference at the 2015 Annual Meeting of\nthe Gerontological Society of America (BSubjective Well-Being Assessment in\nMinority Aging Research^), participants reviewed advances in the measurement of\nsubjective well-being and applications in health disparities research. The papers in this\nspecial section reflect initial efforts by RCMAR-affiliated investigators to tackle issues\nraised during the workshop.\npractices in Alabama and found that adequate health literacy and better perceived health\nwere associated with an increase in the likelihood of happiness. Moreover, those with\nsufficient income were more likely to have better perceived health, and were more\nlikely to be happy. Teresi et al. (2017) evaluated the Feeling Tone Questionnaire (FTQ)\nHispanic community and institutional residents receiving long-term supportive ser-\nvices. They found that negatively worded items had relatively low reliability; 9-item\nand 13-item positive affect scales had high reliability and little differential item\nfunctioning (i.e., items performed equivalently) for race/ethnic subgroups. Palimaru\nand Hays (2017) investigated associations between a quality of life item and HRQOL\nReported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS\u00ae) project. They\n* Lisbeth Nielsen\nlisbeth.nielsen@nih.gov\n1 National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD, USA\nfound that health-related quality of life measures accounted for 69% to 75% of variance\nin perceptions of overall quality of life.\nThe NIA increased its support for research on subjective well-being during the last\ndecade to broaden our understanding of individuals' experience of the aging process.\nSubjective well-being measures include self-reports of momentary daily experiences of\nsuffering and positive emotions, as well as perceptions of overall life satisfaction or\ndissatisfaction and of life purpose and meaning. Subjective well-being measures extend\nthe concept of health beyond the mere presence or absence of illness or disability to\nincorporate the notion of positive health and functioning, which has received limited\nattention in the health sciences. But these measures have not been included regularly in\nepidemiological studies or clinical trials, thus limiting our ability to identify potential\nintervention targets, or to assess the extent to which our behavioral and biomedical\ninterventions improve the quality of life of older adults.\nAdvances in subjective well-being research have been bolstered by international\nefforts to improve metrics by which societal progress is assessed. In line with these\nefforts, NIA has supported the development of new measures and the collection of\npublicly-available population level data on subjective well-being. These data may serve\nas a critical index of the success or failure of interventions and policies aimed at\nimproving the health of older people, complementing other health measures and\neconomic indicators. NIA-supported projects contributing to this endeavor include\nthe Roybal Center for Translational Research on Aging at the Center for Health and\nWell-being at Princeton University (https://chw.princeton.edu/research-\nprograms/center-translational-research-aging), and numerous NIA-supported life\ncourse longitudinal surveys, including the Health and Retirement Study (HRS:\nhttp://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/), Midlife in the United States (MIDUS: http://midus.\nwisc.edu/), the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA: http://www.ifs.org.\nuk/elsa/), the Survey on Health and Retirement in Europe (SHARE: http://www.\nshare-project.org/); the Rush Memory and Aging Project (http://www.rush.\nedu/rumc/page-R12392.html), and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID:\nhttp://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/default.aspx). NIA has also funded a well-being module\non the American Time Use Survey at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (ATUS:\nhttp://www.bls.gov/tus/wbmquestionnaire.pdf). Using data from these and other\nstudies, NIA-supported researchers have documented a U-shaped age profile of well-\nbeing in the US population (Stone et al. 2010), a positive association between daily\nexperiences of positive affect and longevity (Steptoe and Wardle 2011), and associa-\ntions between higher levels of purpose in life and reduced risk of mortality (Boyle et al.\n2009), Alzheimer's disease (Boyle, Buchman, Barnes, & Bennett, 2010), and disability\n(Boyle, Buchman, & Bennett, 2010), after taking background health and demographic\nfactors into account. The MIDUS study was designed to allow researchers to examine\nthe links between biomarkers of health and dimensions of well-being \u00ad particularly its\neudaimonic aspects - with emerging findings showing links between subjective well-\nbeing and emotional recovery to a negative stimulus in the laboratory (Schaefer et al.\n2013), metabolic syndrome (Boylan and Ryff 2015), cognitive function (Lewis et al.\n2016), and mortality (Tsenkova et al. 2007). Harmonized well-being measures in the\nHRS and ELSA allowed researchers to examine cross-national differences in the links\nbetween educational attainment and subjective well-being in later life (Jivraj and\nNazroo 2014). Finally, the link between subjective well-being and income both at the\nindividual (Kahneman et al. 2006) and national level (Kahneman and Deaton 2010) has\nbeen explored by researchers at the NIA-funded Roybal Center, using data from a\nvariety of surveys including the ATUS and the Gallup World Poll.\nIn support of ongoing efforts to improve the quality of available population-level\ndata on subjective well-being, the National Institute on Aging sponsored the develop-\nment of a report on Guidelines on Measuring Subjective Wellbeing by the Organization\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (through the Committee on National\nStatistics at the National Academy of Sciences; Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development 2013). And in 2012, the NIA, in collaboration with the\nUK Economic and Social Research Council, sponsored a U.S. National Academy of\nSciences Panel on Measuring Subjective Well-Being in a Policy-Relevant Framework\n(jointly sponsored by the Committee on National Statistics and the Board on\nBehavioral, Cognitive, and Sensory Sciences), which offered advice on the collection\nof data on subjective well-being by national statistical agencies and in health-related\nresearch studies around the world (National Research Council 2013). The panel\nevaluated methods for studying experienced well-being (reports of momentary positive\nand rewarding, or negative and distressing, states), offered guidance on what research\nwould be needed for such measures to be useful for tracking changes in well-being in\nthe population relevant for policymaking, and considered whether such measures\nmight, at some future date, be treated as outputs of a policy-relevant satellite account\nthat would be adjunct to the Gross National Product.\nThe National Academy of Sciences Panel concluded that currently the most useful\napplication of these measures will be for targeted policy questions affecting specific\nsub-populations, rather than for global monitoring purposes. Thus, the extension of\nsubjective well-being research to the study of health disparities and to characterizing\nthe experiences of under-represented or disadvantaged populations in our society is\nboth important and timely. The RCMAR GSA preconference on Subjective Well-being\nAssessment in Minority Aging Research and the papers in this special section represent\na useful first step in that direction.\nReferences\nBoylan, J.
