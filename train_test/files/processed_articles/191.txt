We examined the relationships of selected social, clinical, and demo-\ngraphic correlates with four dimensions of the Centerfor Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D) scale in 3,401\ncommunity-dwelling elders in the Piedmont area of North Carolina. These correlates explained significant variation in\nsomatic complaints and depressed affect; effects of chronic disability and recent negative events were particularly ro-\nbust. Having a confidant explained reduced symptomatologyfor allfour dimensions, but particularlyfor low positive af-\nfect and interpersonalproblems. Positive affect was also buttressed by helping others. These patterns have particular rel-\nevance where treatmentfor depression is divorcedfrom considerations of the social environment of the elderly patient.\nMOST studies of the social correlates of depressive\nsymptoms do not take into consideration the multidi-\nmensionality of depressive symptom scales. This study uses\nGeorge's (1996) multistage conceptual model of the social\nprecursors of mood impairment to examine the differential re-\nlationships between social factors and four dimensions of de-\npressive symptomatology and to suggest implications of\nthose differences for research and clinical practice.\nFactor analyses of a number of depression rating scales\nhave repeatedly demonstrated the multidimensionality of\nmood states. Radloff (1977) reported a four-factor structure\nfor the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-\nD) Scale. The four factors included depressed affect (dyspho-\nria), low positive affect (lack of well-being), somatic com-\nplaints (retarded activity or enervation), and interpersonal\nproblems. This first-order structure has been generally con-\nfirmed by subsequent analyses (e.g., Davidson, Feldman, &\nCrawford, 1994; Hertzog, Van Alstine, Usala, Hultsch, &\nDixon, 1990). Factorial analyses of other self-report depres-\nsion measures such as the Beck Depression Inventory (Start-\nup, Rees, & Barkham, 1992), Zung Self-rating Depression\nScale (Kivela & Pahkala, 1987), and the Geriatric Depression\nScale (Sheikh et al., 1991), indicate that they also tap several\ndimensions of depression. The numbers and character of fac-\ntors vary with (1) the nature and wording of the items in-\ncluded in each measurement instrument (Zich, Attkisson, &\nGreenfield, 1990), (2) the relative emphasis of the instrument\non symptom frequency or severity (Giambra, 1977), (3) the\ncharacteristics of the sample population (Startup et al., 1992),\nand (4) the method of analysis (McCallum, Mackinnon,\nSimons, & Simons, 1995). However, the literature evaluating\npsychometric measures of depression provides considerable\nevidence that the entity being measured is to some extent mul-\ntidimensional. We review that literature below, using the ter-\nminology of \"depression\" and \"mood\" to refer to the overall\nconstruct being measured.\nAs Gibbons, Clark, & Kupfer (1993) have pointed out, rel-\natively few investigations of the risk of mood impairment\nhave addressed the dimensionality of depression scales.\nTherefore, inconsistencies in the extensive literature reporting\nrelationships between antecedent demographic, clinical, or\nsocial correlates and depression may be partly an artifact of\nthe traditional reliance on unidimensional summary measures\nof depressive symptoms. If precursor variables differentially\ninfluence the development of different dimensions of depres-\nsive symptomatology, then analyses based on the assumption\nthat depression is unidimensional may obscure differences in\nthe magnitude or even the direction of the relationships be-\ntween those correlates and impaired mood.\nSome evidence for the differential influence of precursor\nvariables on dimensions of depression is available, particu-\nlarly from studies involving depression measurement scales\nincluding items pertaining to both negative (depressed) and\npositive affect, which show that the two factors are separate\nand partially independent dimensions with potentially differ-\nNegative affect is more reactive to health and internal at-\ntributes, and positive affect more responsive to external\ngested that the positive subscale measures a clinically mean-\ningful dimension of depression, which may be associated\nwith depletion of social support networks or loss of positive\nexperiences, particularly in elders. In this context, research\nfocusing on the social correlates of multiple dimensions of\ndepression may provide information enabling clinicians to\nimprove the accuracy with which they target treatment\nmodalities to elderly populations.\nThis cross-sectional study provides a systematic analysis of\nthe relationships of selected social, clinical, and demographic\ncorrelates with four dimensions of depression (as defined by\nthe traditional four factors of the CES-D scale) in a large com-\nmunity-dwelling sample of elders in the Piedmont area of\nNorth Carolina. These correlates are evaluated in a framework\nbased on George's (1996) multistage conceptual model of the\nsocial precursors of mood impairment. George's schema pre-\nsents the development of psychiatric symptomatology as a\nmulti-step chronological process. Variables classed as demo-\ngraphic (e.g. age, gender, race) exert their influence at an early\nstage of this process, followed by life-achievement variables\nsuch as education and income. Variables expected to increase\nvulnerability to depression (chronic stressors such as disability\nor chronic medical conditions), and factors considered protec-\ntive against the development of depressive symptoms (particu-\nlarly social support), express their effects at a later stage in the\nprocess. The influence of any provoking agents, such as nega-\ntive life events, is expressed even later in the process, just be-\nfore the development of symptomatology.\nHypotheses\nOur research hypotheses were based on the literature inves-\ntigating the influence of vulnerability factors, protective fac-\ntors, and provoking agents on depression in older adults.\nBecause most of this research treats depression as a unitary\nconstruct, particular emphasis was given to studies systemati-\ncally examining relationships between psychosocial correlates\nand multiple dimensions of depression. These include Krause\nresults for three and two dimensions of the CES-D, respec-\ntively, and also Mitchell, Mathews, & Yesavage (1993), who\nused as dependent variables three dimensions derived from the\nfactorial structure of the shortened Geriatric Depression Scale\n(GDS). Two of the GDS-based dimensions are roughly equiva-\nlent to the depressed affect and reduced positive affect compo-\nnents of the CES-D. Comparability of results among these\nstudies is reduced not only by incomplete overlap among the\ndimensions of depression chosen for study, but also by the fact\nthat each research group operationalized social support as a\nmultidimensional construct using a different set of instru-\nments. Nevertheless, taken collectively, their findings demon-\nstrate that psychosocial variables are not related monolithically\nto dimensions of depression.\nFor independent variables classed as vulnerability factors,\nprotective factors, or provoking agents, we developed hy-\npotheses concerning 1) the equivalence of effect (in magni-\ntude and direction) across all four CES-D subscales, and 2)\nspecificity of effect of selected independent variables on each\ndimension of depressive symptomatology.\nVulnerability factors hypotheses. -- Functional disability\nand chronic medical conditions have both been shown to\npredict depression in elderly populations (Jorm, 1995).\nFunctional disability in particular is robustly related to in-\ncreased symptomatology in elders (La Gory & Fitzpatrick,\n1992); its effects have been demonstrated across all dimen-\nsions of both the CES-D (Berkman et al., 1986) and the GDS\n(Mitchell et al., 1993). Cognitive impairment was linked to\nincreased symptomatology for both dimensions of depression\ntested by Blazer et al. (1992). Other chronic stressors (e.g.\nchronic financial strain) also exert similar effects across all\ntested dimensions of depression (Krause, 1987). Accordingly,\nwe hypothesized that each of the three correlates classed as\nvulnerability factors (functional disability, cognitive impair-\nment, chronic medical conditions) would significantly and\nconsistently increase symptomatology across all four CES-D\nsubscales (depressed affect, somatic complaints, low positive\naffect, interpersonal problems).\nProtectivefactors hypotheses. -- Social support, the proto-\ntypical protective factor against late-life depression, is gener-\nally acknowledged as multidimensional, with some dimen-\nsions clearly protective and others apparently ineffective\nof each individual dimension of social support may vary\nacross depression subscales within both the CES-D (Blazer et\nCombining the reports of Krause (1987), Blazer et al.\n(1996) review, we hypothesized that 1) variables classed as\nprotective factors (satisfaction with social support, confidant\navailability, amount of social interaction, receiving instrumen-\ntal support, giving instrumental support) would exert differen-\ntial effects across the four CES-D subscales, with one excep-\ntion (social network size) which would not influence any\ndimension of depressive symptomatology; 2a) satisfaction\nwith social support was expected to protect against reduction\nand somatic complaints (as per Blazer et al., 1992); availabil-\nity of a confidant, (another measure of perceived social sup-\nport) was expected to follow the same pattern; 2b) social in-\nteraction and giving and receiving instrumental support were\nexpected to protect only against low positive affect.\nProvoking agents hypothesis. -- Provoking agents include\na variety of negative stressful life events (e.g., bereave-\nment, other personal losses, acute family crises) associated\nwith late-life depressive symptomatology (George, 1996;\nStephenson-Cino et al., 1992). Aggregate totals of negative\nlife events are typically higher for persons suffering depres-\nsion than for general population controls (Paykel, 1994). We\npredicted that the number of negative life events experienced\nby subjects in the previous year would demonstrate similar\nassociations, significantly increasing symptomatology on four\nCES-D subscales.\nOther correlates. -- We did not test specific hypotheses\nconcerning the roles of demographic or life-achievement vari-\nables in the development of each dimension of depression.\nHowever, our analyses were adjusted for demographic factors\n(age, gender, and race), as well as two life achievement fac-\ntors (education and income) which have been linked by previ-\ndepressive symptomatology.\nMETHODS\nDesign and Sample\nThis research used cross-sectional baseline data (1986-7)\nfrom the Duke University site of the Established Populations\nfor the Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly (EPESE).\nDetails of EPESE, a multi-site collaborative program funded\nby the National Institute on Aging, are described elsewhere\n(Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1986). The Duke EPESE, a random-\nized household sample of elders (n = 4,162) from five coun-\nties in the north-central (Piedmont) area of North Carolina, in-\ncluded an over-sample of African-American respondents\n(55% compared to 45% primarily White elders). Sample\nweights were developed to adjust sample distributions for\nprobability of selection within households of various sizes\nand for differential non-response and to match the demo-\ngraphic characteristics of the five-county area reported by the\nUS Bureau of the Census. Use of sample weights in the statis-\ntical procedures redistributed responses to the racial distribu-\ntion of the population: 36% African-American and 64% non-\nAfrican-American (Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1990). We excluded\nbaseline interviews provided by proxy informants (n = 162)\nand interviews with missing data on one or more of the CES-\nD depression items (n = 599), leaving an effective sample of\ncluded due to missing data on depression were, on average,\nslightly older (by 1.5 years), less educated (by 1 year), and\nmore likely (23% vs. 11%) to report 'poor' subjective health.\nThey also had lower average annual incomes (by $1,400). No\nrace or gender differences were observed.\nWhile 15% of the sample had missing data on at least one\n(of four) dimensions of depression, each separate dimension\nhad 5% or fewer missing cases. To test hypotheses about dif-\nferences in the effects of independent variables across dimen-\nsions, it was necessary to eliminate those (15%) with missing\ndata on any of the four dimensions. In supplemental analyses,\nwe reran our regression models on the four dimensions sepa-\nrately with 5% or fewer cases excluded for each separate\nmodel. The variance explained by each model, and the signifi-\ncance, direction, and magnitude of the individual coefficients\nwere virtually identical to the results reported below (where\n15% are excluded and differences in the effects of coefficients\nacross dimensions are tested). These supplemental results in-\ndicate that excluding 15% did not seriously bias our results.\nMeasures\nDependent variables. -- The dependent variables were\nscores from each of the four CES-D subscales: depressed af-\nfect, low positive affect, somatic complaints, and interper-\nsonal problems (Table 1). The CES-D had been modified to\npermit binary responses to each item, with response options\ncollapsed to a yes/no format for reporting the presence or ab-\nsence of a symptom during the week preceding the interview\n(Blazer, Burchett, Service, & George, 1991). Each dependent\nvariable was the sum of the number of symptoms reported by\na respondent for its respective subscale. Higher values on all\nsubscales indicate a greater degree of depressive symptoma-\ntology. Higher values on the \"low positive affect\" subscale\ntherefore represent reductions in positive affect.\nIndependent variables. -- Our analysis included three de-\nmographic variables (age, race, gender) and two life achieve-\nment factors (years of formal education, household income).\nThree potential vulnerability factors were examined. A com-\nposite measure of functional disability summed impairments\nassessed by the Katz activities of daily living (ADL) scale,\nthe Rosow-Breslau functional health status scale, and the\nNagi physical activity scale (Cornoni-Huntley et al., 1990).\nTest-retest reliability has been shown to be high for individual\nmore variable for Nagi (57-79%) items, and all three sum-\nmary scores have shown strong test-retest agreement (Smith\net al., 1990). Reliability and validity of both the original Katz\nscale and its subsequent modifications are widely accepted\nficient of 0.91 has been reported for the Rosow-Breslau scale\n(Kane & Kane, 1981).

The alpha coefficients for these two scales were\n0.55 and 0.43, respectively. The low reliability reflects the\nsmall number of constituent items as much as a lack of asso-\nciation. Social interaction frequency was scaled from 5 items\n(numbers of friends and relatives seen or telephoned in the\nTable 1.

Items\nincluded such domains as providing meals or transportation,\nloaning money, and giving advice or gifts. Social network size\nwas scaled by summing responses to 7 items concerning\nnumbers of friends/relatives in the respondent's social net-\nwork. (Landerman, 1996). Alphas were not calculated for\nthese scales because the constituent items are considered\ncause, rather than effect, indicators (Bollen, 1989), i.e., they\nwould not be expected to be correlated. Social interaction fre-\nquency, which was correlated with the other social support\nvariables and unrelated to any dependent variables, was\ndropped from further analysis to reduce collinearity.\nProvoking agents were represented by a single variable\nsumming the number of life events from 19 categories (e.g.,\nchanges in family structure, including deaths and divorce, and\nchanges in residence, health, or financial status) occurring\nduring the year prior to the interview and evaluated by the re-\nspondent as having a negative effect (Landerman, George,\nPreliminary regressions using a quadratic as well as a linear\nterm for income indicated a nonlinear relationship with de-\npression which could be adequately modeled with a single in-\ncome dummy coded 1 for respondents with <$6,000 in yearly\nincome. For other continuous independent variables, tests of\nnonlinearity were negative. Ranges, means, and standard de-\nviations for all variables are presented in Table 2.\nAnalytic Plan\nTo deal with skewed outcomes (counts of CES-D symp-\ntoms), the data were analyzed using PROC CALIS (SAS,\n1990) to perform weighted least squares using Browne's\n(1984) arbitrary distribution function (ADF). As discussed in\nBollen (1989), the ADF estimator performs well with skewed\ndependent variables. CALIS can also determine whether the\neffects of an independent variable vary across correlated out-\ncomes, and thus can test whether the regression effects of\nstress and social support differ significantly across the differ-\nent dimensions of depression. Such advantages outweigh the\nprincipal drawback of this strategy (i.e., it is not possible to\nestimate design effects with this version of LISREL). We con-\nsistently use a 0.01 level of significance to compensate for\npossible underestimation of standard errors associated with\nomission of design effects.\nAn initial saturated model was estimated with effects of the\npostulated vulnerability and protective factors, provoking\nagents, and other independent variables allowed to vary\nacross the four (correlated) dimensions of depression. For\neach regressor, an additional model was then estimated in\nwhich the unstandardized effects were constrained to be equal\nacross outcomes. The difference in fit between the uncon-\nstrained and the constrained models (based on the logs of\ntheir likelihood functions) is distributed as x2, and provided a\nsignificance test of whether the hypothesis of equal effects\nacross dependent variables was consistent with the data. To\neliminate potential confounding due to differences in scale,\nwe rescaled the dependent variables such that each depression\nsubscale ranged from zero (no symptoms) to five (maximum\npossible number of symptoms reported). This was done by\nweighting the (low) positive affect scale by 5/3, the somatic\ncomplaints scale by 5/6, and the interpersonal problems scale\nby 5/2. To test for possible distortion due to rescaling, the\nanalyses were repeated using the unsealed outcomes and\nusing logistic regression with each outcome dichotomized at\nzero versus one or more symptoms. The results were compa-\nrable to those reported below.\nMean imputations were used for independent variables with\nless than 2% missing data. For items with 2-5% missing data,\nwe imputed a regression-predicted score based on the other in-\ndependent variables in the regression model. For income, so-\ncial interaction, and negative life events, which had >5% miss-\ning data, we used stochastic regression imputation. This\nprocedure (imputation of an error term along with a regres-\nsion-predicted score) is designed to estimate accurately both\nthe variance and mean of the imputed variable, and therefore\nminimize bias in relevant tests of significance (David, Little,\nSamihel, & Triest, 1986). Significance tests were based on the\nnumber of missing cases prior to imputation.\nWe ran separate regressions of all independent variables\nand covariates entered simultaneously on each of the four di-\nmensions of depression. We report both unstandardized met-\nric coefficients, which permit comparison of the effects of the\nsame regressor across outcomes, and standardized beta coeffi-\ncients, which are used to compare the effects of different re-\ngressors on the same outcome.\nWhile causal direction cannot be assumed when cross-sec-\ntional data only are employed, we were guided in our interpre-\ntation of these analyses by the following principles: (1) Traits\nsuch as the demographic variables gender and race, and other\nfixed characteristics such as educational achievement, are as-\nsumed to pre-date symptoms of depression; (2) State phe-\nTable 2.

We base the latter\nprinciple on differences in temporal wording between depen-\ndent (CES-D) and independent variables in the EPESE ques-\ntionnaires. The stem of the CES-D scale items specifies \". . .\nduring the past week.\" In contrast, items measuring the inde-\npendent variables either require respondents to assess aspects\nof their social environment which were established prior to the\npast week (e.g., annual family income, level of education,\navailability of a trusted confidant), or explicitly indicate a time\nframe preceding and including the past week (e.g., amount of\nhelp given or received \"in the past year,\" negative life events\noccurring \"in the past year,\" and medical conditions \"ever\" di-\nagnosed.) Therefore, where the significance of albeit cross-\nsectional associations warrant, we will consider depressive\nsymptoms to be reactive to psychosocial correlates, while ex-\nplicitly noting the distinct possibility that the social environ-\nment was itself reactive to similar mood states prior to our first\ncontact with these subjects.\nRESULTS\nRelationships among subscales. -- Table 3 shows fre-\nquency distributions of, and correlations among, the four CES-\nD subscales. Most respondents were asymptomatic on the\nscales measuring interpersonal problems and low personal af-\nfect. Almost 40% of the sample reported at least one symptom\nof depressed affect, and over half reported at least one somatic\ncomplaint. Depressed affect and somatic complaints subscales\nshared over 1/3 of their variance with other subscales; shared\nvariance was lower (about 1/8) for the other two subscales.\nTests of equivalence. -- Table 4 summarizes x2 tests for the\nnull hypothesis of equivalent effects across all four dimen-\nsions of depressive symptoms. Equivalent (non-significant)\noutcomes were observed for two vulnerability factors (cogni-\ntive impairment and chronic health problems). Equivalent ef-\nfects were also seen for two protective factors hypothesized to\nshow differential effects. Availability of a confidant proved\nstrongly protective for all dimensions. Social interaction was\nnot related to any dimension (and was therefore omitted from\nthe models reported in Table 4). Hypotheses of equivalent\noutcomes across all dimensions for one protective factor (so-\ncial network size) and for the provoking agent variable (nega-\ntive life events) were not supported.\nTests of specificity. -- Overall, the full set of independent\nvariables was more strongly associated with somatic com-\nplaints and depressed affect than with the other two dimen-\nsions of depression, as indicated by the R2 values at the bot-\ntom of each column in the table. The unstandardized\nregression coefficients demonstrate specific differences in the\neffects of regressors across dependent variables. The general\npattern of stronger effects for depression and somatic symp-\ntoms and weaker effects for positive affect is most pro-\nnounced for differences in the effects of functional disability\nand negative events across subscales.\nIn supplemental analyses, we re-estimated the models for\neach subscale using Poisson regression. Poisson is especially\nuseful when the dependent variable is a highly skewed count\nand ordinary least squares assumptions are not met (Cameron\n& Trivedi, 1986). In general, the Rvs and patterns of signifi-\ncance with Poisson were consistent with our overall findings\nand conclusions. For each subscale, we calculated a 'pseudo\nRv (Land, McCall, & Nagin, 1996) based on the Poisson re-\npressed affect, positive affect, somatic complaints and inter-\npersonal problems) were almost identical to those reported in\nTable 4. Three coefficients which were trends (.05 <p < .10)\nin Table 4 were significant in Poisson (interpersonal problems\nwith cognitive impairment and satisfaction with social sup-\nTable 3.

Otherwise, the significant regressors\nwere the same across estimation techniques. Because no soft-\nware is available for structural equation modeling (LISREL)\nwith Poisson regression, we were unable to replicate our tests\nof whether the effects of regressors were different across sub-\nscales. (This is the reaso'h we use PROC CALIS with the\nADF estimator).\nOur hypothesis that each vulnerability factor would be pos-\nitively related to symptomatology held for only one of three\nvariables. Functional disability was strongly related to both\nsomatic complaints and depressed affect, and significantly re-\nlated to lowered positive affect, but not related to interper-\nsonal problems.\nOne of the two perceived social support measures (satisfac-\ntion with amount of social interaction) protected against so-\nmatic complaints and depressed affect. The other (availability\nof a confidant) was highly protective against all four dimen-\nsions of depression. Neither conformed to the pattern of ef-\nfects which had been expected (protection against somatic\ncomplaints and positive affect only). Size of social network,\nwhich had not been expected to exert protective effects\nagainst any dimension of depression, was positively associ-\nated with both depressed affect and interpersonal problems.\nGiving instrumental help protected against lowered positive\naffect (as hypothesized), but was also linked to increased in-\nterpersonal problems. Receiving instrumental help was not\nprotective against low positive affect (as hypothesized), but\ninstead was associated with depressed affect and somatic\ncomplaints.\nNegative life events acted as provoking agents for all four\ndimensions of depression (as hypothesized). Their effects\nwere more strongly expressed on the subscales measuring de-\npressed affect and somatic complaints than on the other sub-\nscales.\nIn the regression for each CES-D subscale, the magnitude\nof the standardized beta coefficient associated with each cor-\nrelate indicates its relative importance as an independent vari-\nable for that dimension of depression. These coefficients indi-\ncate that the vulnerability factor of functional disability and\nthe single variable representing provoking agents (negative\nlife events) were the two most powerful regressors both for\nsomatic complaints and (in reversed order) for depressed af-\nTable 4.

In contrast, non-availability of a confidant and giving lit-\ntle instrumental support were the most important regressors\nfor low positive affect. Confidant non-availability was also the\nmost important correlate of interpersonal problems; next in\nimportance were negative life events and, unexpectedly, giv-\ning much instrumental support.\nDISCUSSION\nGeneral patterns. -- Traditionally, depression has been\ntreated as a unitary construct in the epidemiologic literature.\nOur results underscore the limitations of such a strategy.\nCorrelations among the different depression subscales (Table\n3) were too low to be consistent with the presence of a single\nunderlying dimension; only that between depressed affect and\nsomatic complaints exceeded 0.35. This pair of dimensions\ncharacteristically shows the highest correlation among CES-D\nsubscales in samples of elders (e.g., Berkman et al., 1986;\nExplained variance for the full set of correlates for our\nsample of elders was considerably greater for somatic com-\nplaints and depressed affect than for the other two dimensions\nof depression. This pattern is somewhat similar to that seen in\nthe additive model of Krause (1987), where R2 values were\nsimilar for depressed affect and somatic subscales, and con-\nsiderably lower for the positive affect subscale (Table 2).\nBefore continuing, it is important to point out that our re-\nsults apply to the four dimensions of depression only as mea-\nsured by the CES-D. Our focus is on the utility of disaggre-\ngating the CES-D scale into its separate dimensions in\nepidemiological analyses. The findings indicate that the mea-\nsures of positive affect and interpersonal problems, which\nhave low variance and high skew, are less responsive to social\nfactors than depressive symptoms and somatic complaints.\nReplications using Poisson regression provide evidence that\nthese skewed distributions did not seriously distort the find-\nings for the measures employed. However, we cannot rule out\nthe possibility that different results would be obtained using\nmeasures of positive affect and interpersonal problems with\nhigh prevalence and less skew.\nDepressed affect and somatic complaints. -- Depressed af-\nfect and somatic complaints showed similar patterns of rela-\ntionship with respect to multiple variables. Both functional\ndisability and negative life events were more strongly related\nto depressed affect and somatic complaints than of low posi-\ntive affect and interpersonal problems. Our findings contrast\nwith other studies reporting more consistent effects of func-\ntional disability across dimensions. Berkman et al. (1986) re-\nported significantly increased symptomatology for every one\nof the 20 CES-D items in elders with one or more functional\ndisabilities. Similarly, Mitchell et al. (1993) reported that im-\npairment in instrumental activities of daily living was associ-\nated with increased symptoms across all dimensions of de-\npression on the GDS.\nSimilarities between depressed affect and somatic com-\nplaints were also seen with respect to protective factors.\nSatisfaction with the amount of social interaction was protec-\ntive for only these two dimensions of depression. Further-\nmore, only the depressed affect and somatic complaints sub-\nscales were significantly associated with instrumental support\nreceived. However, the direction of this association was unex-\npected: receiving support was linked to exacerbation rather\nthan reduction of symptoms. This counterintuitive finding is\nconsistent with the linkage between receipt of instrumental\nsocial support and worsened depressive affect reported by\nthat receipt of tangible support showed no association with\nthese two CES-D subscales. Our results may indicate that re-\nceiving support is a consequence rather than a cause of de-\npressive symptoms in these cross-sectional analyses.\nLow positive affect. -- The level of correlation between\nsubscales measuring low positive affect and depressed affect\n(0.32) is consistent with the characterization of these dimen-\nsions as relatively but not totally independent in much of the\nliterature on affect balance and well-being (Clark & Watson,\n1991). The strongest correlates of changes in positive affect\nwere two protective factors: availability of a confidant and\ngiving instrumental support. Our findings are consistent with\nthe report of Chappell & Badger (1989) that lack of a confi-\ndant is associated with reduced well-being. They also agree\nwith Krause's (1987) report that elders providing assistance to\nothers showed less symptomatology on the low positive affect\ndimension of the CES-D. Perhaps positive affect in elders\nwho give aid is partially maintained by comparison of their\nown situation with the lives of persons to whom they provide\nassistance.\nA national survey including separate measures for provi-\nsion of informal and formal support provides evidence for a\nmechanism linking support giving and reduction of symp-\ntomatology in other dimensions of depression, but it involves\nindirect rather than direct effects (Krause, Herzog, & Baker,\n1992). Their model indicates that provision of informal sup-\nport is directly linked to increased perception of personal con-\ntrol, which in turn is associated with reduction of depressed\naffect and somatic complaints. Krause et al. (1992) also sug-\ngested that giving support to others bolsters feelings of self-\nesteem. Our data did not include measures of personal control\nor self-esteem.\nOur finding that negative life events are associated with a\nreduction in positive affect contrasts with the report by Vaux\n& Meddin (1987) that negative life changes had no effect on\ntwo measures of positive affect in a sample of 144 Mid-\nwestern, rural elders. However, we found that negative life\nevents had a more powerful influence on depressed affect than\non low positive affect. This finding is more consistent with the\nmodel of Zautra & Reich (1983), which proposes that nega-\ntive events exert their influence primarily on negative affective\nstates, and positive affective states are influenced primarily by\npositive rather than negative events. Data on positive life\nevents were not available in our study.\nInterpersonal problems. -- Interpersonal problems (feeling\ndisliked and perceiving people as unfriendly) were correlated\nin our sample with the lack of a confidant and an impaired so-\ncial network. Unexpectedly, we also.found that giving instru-\nmental aid was linked to increased symptoms on the CES-D\ninterpersonal problems subscale. The direction of this rela-\ntionship is opposite to that seen for low positive affect. To the\nextent that caregivers are more isolated and absorbed in care-\ngiving tasks, they may be avoided or dismissed by friends and\nacquaintances, contributing to a discounting of the friendship\nand care of others.\nFactors which affected allfour dimensions. -- Two vulner-\nability factors showed consistent lack of effect across all di-\nmensions. Lack of association between cognitive impairment\nand these two CES-D subscales is not in agreement with other\npublished studies. Blazer et al. (1992) reported that cognitive\nimpairment predicted increased symptomatology for both low\npositive affect and somatic complaints. La Rue, Swan, &\nCarmelli (1995) reported that only lower positive affect was\nsignificantly linked to impairment on the MMSE. However,\nthe subjects included in these two studies were clinically or\ndemographically dissimilar from the EPESE: Blazer et al.\n(1992) included both middle-aged and elderly adults in their\nclinical study; while the community sample of elders by La\nRue et al. (1995) was restricted to men.\nLack of association between our measure of chronic medi-\ncal conditions and any dimension of depression may have\nbeen a function of including functional disability in our mod-\nels. Functional disability mediates much of the effect of\nhealth on depression, and also serves as an indicator of the\nseverity of these conditions. To confirm this speculation, we\nran the models without the disability variable, resulting in sig-\nnificant relationships between chronic conditions and both de-\npressed affect and somatic complaints, and a trend for their\nrelationship to interpersonal problems. Foelker & Shewchuk\n(1992) reported a positive correlation of total symptom count\non the Physical Health Domain Index with somatic com-\nplaints, but not with any other dimension of depression.\nThe single protective factor which consistently influenced\nall four dimensions of depression was confidant availability\n(which had not been expected to show protective effects on all\nsubscales). The importance of this dimension of social sup-\nport is well-documented in the literature (George 1996), but\nthe findings of this study provide new evidence concerning\nboth the breadth and specificity of its protective effect against\ndepressive symptoms.\nDespite the fact that negative life events were represented\nby an aggregate variable in this analysis, we found that per-\nsons who had experienced a large number of such events in\nthe preceding twelve months showed higher symptomatology\nacross all dimensions of depression. In contrast, Krause\n(1986) reported that summed measures of negative life events\nconsistently failed to predict risk on any CES-D subscale. He\nrecommended disaggregation of negative life events due to\nthe extent of variation among categories of stressful life\nevents with respect to the strength of their relationship with\nsymptoms on each CES-D subscale at different levels of so-\ncial support. Bereavement, for example, was significantly\nlinked to somatic symptoms when social support was limited\n(Krause, 1986). In supplementary analyses (not shown), we\nre-estimated our regression models using separate measures\nfor bereavement and non-bereavement events. The effects of\nbereavement and non-bereavement events (across outcomes)\nwere essentially the same in our analysis. Further investiga-\ntion of additive and interactive effects of disaggregated mea-\nsures of both negative life events and social support on the\nfour dimensions of depression, following the example of\nKrause (1986), might provide additional insight concerning\nrisk in subgroups of elderly persons.\nRelevant theoretical work (Bowlby, 1988; Sroufe & Rutter,\n1984) indicates that the relationship between the social envi-\nronment and depression is characterized not by a few power-\nful risk factors, but by a multiplicity of events and experiences\nwhich can exert modest effects. Disaggregating the CES-D\nprovides evidence that there are differences in effects across\ndimensions. These differences can be obscured, and modest\neffects which vary in strength across dimensions can be\nmissed altogether, if the scale is not disaggregated. Given this,\nand given that many of the effects expected are modest to\nbegin with, disaggregation is especially useful in epidemio-\nlogic attempts to map out the complex relationship between\nthe social environment and the risk of depression. Future re-\nsearch should also address whether these relationships are dif-\nferential by subgroups of the elderly, e.g., by gender.\nIn clinical practice, depressed affect and somatic com-\nplaints may most likely be reported concurrently with chronic\ndisability or recent negative events. Positive affect may most\neffectively be buttressed for elders who help others and have a\nconfidant. Clinicians who first attempt to optimize treatment\nof medical conditions (reduce chronic disability) and provide\ntimely crisis counseling to those with acute life stress will de-\ncrease the risk of multiple dimensions of depression. Beyond\nthese strategies, persons who present with certain symptom\nprofiles may have selective deficits in their social support sys-\ntems, including particular difficulties mobilizing support. This\nis a new finding and one with particular relevance where treat-\nment for depressed mood is divorced from considerations of\nthe social environment of the elderly patient.\n"
