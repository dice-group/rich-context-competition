Foster youth are often ex-\nposed to poverty and many other ad-\nverse childhood experiences including\nabuse, neglect, domestic violence, and\nparental substance use, and many un-\ndergo frequent placement and school\nchanges while in foster care.1,7,8 Several\ntheories exist regarding the effects of\nchronic and early exposures to ad-\nversity, all of which suggest that the\nmore stressors towhich one is exposed,\nthe higher the likelihood of a chronic\nphysical or mental health condition\nlater in life.9\u00ad15 However, to our knowl-\nedge only 1 retrospective study has\nevaluated this question specifically in\nfoster youth; this study suggested that\nadults with foster care experience had\nhigher odds of a physical health prob-\nlem than those who had never been in\nIn addition to, and likely because of,\nthese early exposures, a large per-\ncentage of youth emancipating from\nfostercareliveinpovertyorexperience\nunemployment or homelessness in\nyoung adulthood, potentially limiting\nConversely, extended Medicaid and FC\nprograms during young adulthood\nhave been associated with improved\nreproductive health access and out-\ncomes for this population; the impact\nof extended FC on other types of phys-\nical health problems in this population\nsions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA),\nformer foster youth: a provision extend-\ning Medicaid coverage through age 26\nyears to young adults who were in\nfoster care on their 18th birthday and\na provision that provides coverage to\nall nonelderly people with incomes\n#133% of the federal poverty level in\nparticipating states.24 However, many\nstates have not extended Medicaid to\nlow-income single adults, pursuant to\na recent US Supreme Court decision\nthat upheld the constitutionality of the\nACA but also held that state participa-\ntion in Medicaid expansion is op-\ntional.25 Thus, former foster youth who\nhave incomes ,133% of the federal\npoverty level who were not in care on\ntheir 18th birthday may not have ac-\ncess to Medicaid, depending on the\nstate in which they were emancipated\nfrom care. Additionally, many states do\nnot provide Medicaid coverage to for-\nmer foster youth who were emanci-\npated in another state. Finally, recent\nfederal legislation has also provided\nfinancial incentives for states to extend\nfoster care to age 21 (with accompa-\nnying extended medical coverage),26\nalthough many still routinely discharge\nfoster youth at age 18.\nAn understanding of this population's\nrisk of chronic medical problems and\nhealth care access will be helpful to\ninform policies and practices at the\nstate and federal levels. Our objective\nwas to compare the risks of chronic\nhealth problems and access indica-\ntors among young adults transitioning\nout of the foster system with those of\nyouth in the general population with\nand without exposure to economic\ninsecurity.\nMETHODS\nStudy Design, Sample, and Data\nCollection Procedures\nWeuseddatafrom2longitudinalcohorts:\nthe National Longitudinal Study of Ado-\nlescent Health (Add Health), a large,\nnationally representative sample of\nyouth transitioning to adulthood in the\nUnited States,27 and the Midwest Eval-\nuation of the Adult Functioning of\nFormer Foster Youth (Midwest Study),\na study evaluating youth in Illinois, Iowa,\nand Wisconsin as they transitioned out\noffostercare.1\u00ad4 Humansubjectsapproval\nand informed consent were obtained\nin both studies. The present analyses\nwere determined exempt for human\nsubjects review, because all data were\ndeidentified.\nAdd Health (Economically Secure and\nInsecure Groups)\nThe Add Health Study consists of 4\ndata waves collected primarily via\nin-home audio computer-assisted methods\n(baseline N for in-home interviews =\ncurrent study if they participated in\n4, and had not been in foster care by\nthen subdivided into 2 groups.

Youth who were in\na psychiatric or correctional facility,\nwere on runaway status, or had a dis-\nability preventing survey completion\nwere excluded. Most interviews were\nconducted in person, and computer-\nassisted techniques were used for\nsensitive subjects. Participants were\ninterviewed every 2 years until age 25\nor 26; we used data from waves 1\nipated in wave 1. Of those, 81% partic-\nipated in wave 5 as well and were\nincluded in the current study (foster\ncare or FC group; N = 596). Hereafter,\nwave 3 of Add Health and wave 1 of the\nMidwest Study will be referred to as\ntime 1, and wave 4 of Add Health and\nwave 5 of the Midwest Study will be\nreferred to as time 2.\nVariables\nAll variables were collected via self-\nreport.\nOutcomes\nIndividual Health Outcomes\nData were available at time 1 and 2 in\nboth studies for 2 outcomes: general\nhealth (dichotomized at fair/poor ver-\nsus good/very good/excellent) and BMI.\nWe also evaluated several chronic\nhealth conditions assessed at time 2\nonly. Wording of questions for these\nvariables differed slightly between\nstudies (Table 1). Participants were\ninitially asked whether they had a con-\ndition or health problem, whether it\nlimited their activities, and how long it\nhad been present. They were then\nasked about the following conditions:\nseizure disorder, attention-deficit/\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma,\ndyslipidemia, hypertension, and di-\nabetes. For these outcomes, youth\nwere coded as 0 if the youth reported\nthat a condition did not limit their daily\nactivities or had been present for ,1\nyear. We also assessed whether par-\nticipants reported being a chronic,\nregular smoker, defined as having ever\nsmoked \"regularly\" and smoking all of\nCombined Health Outcome Variables\n(Time 2 Only)\nWegenerated2summaryvariables:any\ncardiovascular risk factor (dyslipidemia,\nhypertension, diabetes, smoker, or BMI\n$30) and other chronic illness (seizure\ndisorder, ADHD, or asthma).\nHealth Care Access Indicators (Time 2\nOnly)\nWeassessedthefollowingdichotomous\nvariables: no insurance, having Medic-\naid, not getting needed medical care in\nthe past year, and time since last\nphysical examination (#1 year versus\nCovariates\nWe included gender, race (white ver-\nsus African American versus other\nrace), ethnicity (Hispanic versus non-\nHispanic), education level at time 2\n(high school diploma versus no di-\nploma) and economic insecurity at time\n2 (defined as currently homeless or any\nof the following in the past 12 months:\ninability to pay full amount of rent or\nutilities, eviction, utilities shut off, or\nbeing worried whether food would run\nout before there was money to buy\nmore), and current age as covariates in\nthe main analyses. For female-only\nanalyses, we also included a variable\nreflecting history of past or current\npregnancy, given a known impact on\nsome outcomes (eg, diabetes, hyper-\ntension).\nAnalyses\nWe performed descriptive statistics\ncomparing univariate associations be-\ntween the covariates and group status,\nthen we used multivariate regres-\nsion analyses (linear for continuous\noutcomes, logistic for dichotomous\noutcomes) to compare the health\noutcomes across groups after con-\ntrolling for covariates.

Finally, we\nperformed sensitivity analyses drop-\nping females who had ever been\npregnant from the hypertension and\ndiabetes analyses, giventhe difference\nin wording between studies for these\nquestions. For all analyses, we treated\nES as the reference group.\nRESULTS\nResults of univariate analyses indi-\ncated that all covariates were asso-\nciated with group status. They also\nrevealed a consistent pattern of graded\nincreasein riskacross cohorts formost\noutcomes, progressing from ES to EI to\nFC groups (Table 2). This pattern held\nafter adjustment for covariates. For ex-\nample, the EI group had a significantly\nhigher odds of reporting poor or fair\ngeneral health than the ES group (odds\nreported even higher odds of this out-\naverage BMIs in the EI and FC groups\nwere also higher than in the ES group,\nwith the FC group having the highest\nrelationship significant for FC only).\nFigure 1 contains results of the multi-\nvariate analyses of all time 2\u00adonly in-\ndividual health conditions, excluding\nseizures because there were no youth\nTABLE 2 Descriptives and Univariate Relationships Between Covariates/Outcomes and Cohort\nN Proportion/Mean SD N Proportion/Mean SD N Proportion/Mean SD\nCovariates\nAverage age\nOutcomes\nGeneral health\nAverage BMI\na Analysis includes females only.\nb No significance levels because there were 0 with outcome in Add Health ES (reference) group.\nwith seizures in the ES group. Figure 2\ncontains results of our 2 summary var-\niables. There were 2 notable exceptions\nto the pattern of graded increased risk\nfrom ES to EI to FC; the EI group was\nless likely to report ADHD than the ES\ngroup, but the FC group was by far the\nmost likely to report this outcome, and\nno differences were found by group\nfor dyslipidemia. When we compared\nthe FC and ES groups most ORs were\nsignificant; for diabetes the relation-\nship was nonsignificant but followed\na similar trend (P = .06). In contrast,\nthe EI group had only 2 outcomes for\nwhich odds were significant when\ncompared with the ES group (asthma\nrespectively).\nWith respect to insurance status, the EI\nand FC groups were once again more\nlikely to report having no insurance (OR\nspectively). Although the EI group was\nalso significantly more likely to report\nnot getting needed care in the past year\nthe FC group was less likely to report\n0.49) than the ES group. Neither group\nwas significantly different in terms of\nthe time since their last health exami-\nnation compared with the ES reference\ngroup.\nThe relationship between group status\nand outcomes did not vary by time for\nour 2 multiple-time-point outcomes\n(BMI and general health). With respect\nto gender moderation, interaction\nterms for the gender by FC analyses\nwere significant for all outcomes eval-\nuated except time since last exami-\nnation. Specifically, females in the FC\ngrouphadahigherBMIthanthoseinthe\nES group, but FC males had a lower BMI\nthan their ES counterparts (b = 1.73;\nP value of interaction term ,.001). In\ncontrast, both males and females in the\nFC group had a higher odds of having\n$1 cardiovascular risk factor and\nlower odds of not receiving needed\ncare compared with their ES counter-\nparts, but these gaps were significantly\nwider for females than males (P = .004\nand .041 for cardiovascular risk factor\nand not receiving needed care in-\nteraction terms, respectively). Both\ngenders were more likely to report\nhaving no insurance or receiving\nMedicaid if they were in the FC group;\nhowever, males in the FC group had\nhigher ORs than females for the no-\ninsurance outcomes (P , .001), and\nthe reverse was true for odds of re-\ngender by EI interaction was signifi-\ncant; for the Medicaid outcome, the\neffect of being in the EI group was\nlarger for females than for males (P =\n.049). Sensitivity analyses revealed\ntrends similar to the main analyses in\nall instances.\nDISCUSSION\nResults are consistent with the chronic\nstress literature and previous retro-\nspective work evaluating the adult\nhealth outcomes of former foster youth,\nwhich suggests that exposure to eco-\nnomic insecurity and the other chronic\nstressors associated with having been\nin foster care have the potential to in-\nfluence young adult health outcomes in\nLogistic regressions of individual dichotomous outcomes at time 2, by cohort.\nARTICLE\nconditions have their origins in the\nchildhood and teenage years; thus find-\nings are relevant not only for public and\nprivate agencies serving former foster\nyouth but also for those serving youth\ncurrently in foster care.\nOur access indicators suggest that\nformer foster youth do not perceive\na lack of needed medical care during\nyoung adulthood; previous analyses\nreveal that foster youth also perceive\nsimilar or higher rates of access to\nmedical care compared with general\npopulation youth while they are still in\ncare.1 However, it is important to note\nthat access to \"needed care\" does not\nequate to access to high-quality, evidence-\nbased care. Medical care for foster\nyouth is often discontinuous, making it\ndifficult for trusting patient\u00adprovider\nrelationships to form and evidence-\nAlthough little research has evaluated\ncontinuity and quality of care among\nemancipated foster youth, there is little\nreason to believe these problems improve\nas foster youth become young adults\nfacing homelessness, unemployment,\nand other issues known to affect quality\nFuture exploration is merited to de-\ntermine care-related contributors to\nthis group's disproportionate disease\nburden. Quantitative and qualitative\nresearch should be conducted to bet-\nter delineate the specific types of care\nthese youth receive (and lack), the con-\ntinuity and quality of provider relation-\nships they experience, and the degree\nto which they receive evidence-based\ncare for chronic medical conditions\nduring adolescence and the transition\nto adulthood. Current and former foster\nyouth may benefit from a level of pre-\nventive health care beyond that which\nis recommended for general popula-\ntion youth,32,33 including strategies to\npromote access to state-of-the-art in-\nterventions targeting modifiable car-\ndiovascular risk factors such as diet,\nexercise, and smoking cessation. Train-\ning and resources for caseworkers,\nfoster parents, and group home staff\nemphasizing the importance of conti-\nnuity and quality of health care pro-\nvider relationships in addition to timely\naccess may also be beneficial. Previous\nresearch on chronic disease man-\nagement in adult populations with\nthe types of maladaptive relation-\nship styles resultant from early ad-\nversity suggests that policies and\nprograms may need to be tailored to\nthe unique life experiences of foster\nyouth to have maximal effect, for ex-\nample, including individualized strategies\nto promote the formation of trusting\nrelationships with health care and al-\nlied providers.34 Support to maintain\nthese relationships across placement\nchanges may also be beneficial. Given\nthe moderating effect of gender in our\nanalyses of BMI and other cardiovas-\ncular risk factors, young women formerly\nin foster care should be a particular\nfocus in policy and intervention work,\nalthough male youth are also likely to\nbenefit.\nFinally,the needsofformerfosteryouth\nshould be considered when states are\ncontemplating participation in Medic-\naid expansion and other policies to\nextend insurance or foster care for\nthis vulnerable population. Our pre-\nvious work suggests that the majority\nof young women emancipating from\nLogistic regressions of summary outcomes at time 2, by cohort.\nfoster care are likely to be eligible for\nMedicaid undereither the low-income\nprovision or the foster youth\u00adspecific\nprovision of the ACA in participating\nstates.20 Given the similar poverty\nrates and lower insurance rates for\nmale former foster youth, these poli-\ncies have the potential to affect young\nmen formerly in foster care in a similar\nThis study has several limitations. First,\noutcomes were assessed by using\nslightly different questions in the 2\nstudies, which could have led to dif-\nferences in classification across cohorts.\nIn particular, the language excluding\npregnancy-related hypertension and\ndiabetes in the Add Health cohorts\ncould have artificially inflated ORs\nbecause these conditions were not\nspecifically excluded in the Midwest\nStudy. However, sensitivity analyses\nremoving young women ever pregnant\nfrom all 3 cohorts and thus removing\nthis potential bias demonstrated sim-\nilar results. Second, although we ad-\njusted for potential demographic and\nsocioeconomic confounding factors,\nsurvey questions cannot completely\nassess social determinants of health.\nThus, some degree of residual con-\nfoundingislikely.Third,someoutcomes\nwere rare, and we had suboptimal\npower to detect significant differences\nin these variables (eg, seizures). We\nwere also limited to a subset of health\noutcomes measured in both studies;\nfuture research should explore a wider\nvariety of health problems including\nmental health and substance-related\ndisorders, which are among the most\ncommon problems experienced by young\nadults.35 Finally, variables were self-\nreport. This limitation may have re-\nsulted in some misclassification of\noutcomes, biasing point estimates to-\nward the null.\nCONCLUSIONS\nYoungadultformerfosteryouthappear\ntohaveahigherriskofmultiplechronic\nhealth conditions, above and beyond\nthat which is attributable to economic\ninsecurity. Our data support the In-\nstitute of Medicine assertion that foster\nyouth should be prioritized when inter-\nventions to reduce health disparities\nin young adulthood are evaluated and\nimplemented,6 and when state and\nfederal governing bodies are consid-\nering policies to extend Medicaid or\nfoster care.\n"
