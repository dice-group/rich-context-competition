    "abstract": "Abstract\nAs in other sectors, increasingly higher performance and efficiency are also being required from health care employees. To\nachieve this goal, every health care organization should have a suitable human resource management system. The selection,\neducation, training, effective performance appraisal, and evaluation of leaders are particularly of key importance for every\norganization. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is used in this study to develop a model of practice outputs and inputs to help\nidentify the most efficient nurse leaders. The employees' performance appraisals are often closely related to their specific\norganizations. As leaders' behaviors are also influenced by external, non-discretionary factors, the three-stage DEA was used\nto include inputs not controlled by individual leaders. This article proposes a performance appraisal based on competency\nmodels of leadership for a larger professional group working across several different organizations, yet in similar professional\nand institutional environments. The empirical data in this article are based on two surveys that were conducted in 15\nSlovenian public hospitals.\n",

The effects of a good health care sys-\ntem can be observed in the productivity of the workforce,\nwhich in turn contributes to higher economic growth.\nTherefore, the assurance of a successful health care system\nshould be a priority in any country. Health care expenditures\nin developed countries comprise 8% to 16% of GDP, whereas\nemployees in the health and social work sector account for\n6% to 20% of all employees (Organization for Economic\nCo-Operation and Development, 2014). The health care sys-\ntems in the majority of European countries are designed so\nthat the largest portion, in terms of both health service pro-\nviders and funding, remains within the public sector\n(Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development,\n2014). The state should use its powers to ensure public sector\norganizations (including health care organizations) operate\nin an efficient and effective manner. One of the characteris-\ntics of the majority of public sector organizations is that their\nperformance greatly depends on the successful management\nof human resources.\nEmployee performance appraisals (PA) can support a\nwide range of human resource decision-making activities\nincluding pay raise, promotion, demotion, termination, and\ntraining of employees (Osman, Berbary, Sidani, Al-Ayoubi,\n& Emrouznejad, 2011). Well-designed and properly used\nappraisal systems are essential for effective functioning of\norganizations (Manoharan, Muralidharan, & Deshmukh,\nResearch on PA has evolved from a pure focus on how to\nmeasure performance to examining the social context where\nperformance appraisal takes place (Prasad, Suar, & Taraban,\nthe employees working in organizations are challenging\ntasks involving several factors. Each employee achieves cer-\ntain performance levels in various factors, and the resulting\ninformation can be overwhelming (Manoharan et al., 2009).\nThe development of PA system is especially important for\nleaders. Leaders can affect organization performance in differ-\nent ways. Devising more effective ways of managing the per-\nformance of managers and leaders has become a cornerstone of\norganizational and leadership development in recent years\n(Cheng, Dainty, & Moore, 2005).

A competence is an action that can be monitored,\nevaluated, and whose efficiency can be measured. On that\nbasis, we can define a leadership competence model as a sys-\ntem of key competences, designed based on research of key\nindicators of effective behavior of leaders (Kvas, Seljak, &\nStare, 2013). Competencies can only be defined on the basis\nof observation of the behavior of the individual (actions in\nreal situations; Stare & Seljak, 2013). They have become an\nimportant tool for introducing changes in organizations and\nin changing the behavior of the individual (Plessius &\nIn the competency approach, we compare employees'\nperformance against performance standards or desired\nbehaviors (Cheng et al., 2005). Competency based PAs have\nbeen seen as a powerful tool to underpin many human\nresource management activities also in healthcare organiza-\ntions (Osman et al., 2011; Rosenfeld, Pyc, Rosati, & Marren,\n2012). Such assessments can help to define job characteris-\ntics and desired levels of performance and hence, can pro-\nvide a basis for many aspects of the human resource\nmanagement in health care (Cheng et al., 2005).\nNurse leaders need to be familiar with the operation of the\nhealth care system, possess knowledge and skills from the\nareas of leadership, communication, and employee motiva-\ntion, and possess the ability to work in a team, ability to solve\ncomplex problems, and ability to work with health and other\ninstitutions. They usually perform a dual role--a profes-\nsional and a leadership role, which require additional knowl-\nedge and skills (Hogan & Nickitas, 2009; Yoder-Wise,\nA relatively long chain of leadership hierarchy has been\nforged in professional groups such as nursing: ranging from\nthe nursing director, leaders of wards, clinics, and sectors at\nthe top level to the charge nurse and team leader on the first-\nline management level. Not only are people in top positions\n(top managers and leaders) important in the organization\nhere, but also the entire hierarchical management structure\nwithin it (Kvas & Seljak, 2013b; Twedell & Jackson Gray,\nThe competency model of leadership in nursing emerged\nKvas et al., 2013). It consists of generic leadership compe-\ntencies (behaviors or actions) that show the characteristics of\nall leaders and role-specific competencies that are consid-\nered to be characteristic of leaders in nursing. Generic com-\npetencies comprise flexibility at work, creativity, leadership,\norganizational climate, organization, networking/influence,\nand realization skills.\nBased on analysis of the theory of nursing, leadership,\nand competency models (Biesma et al., 2008; International\nof role-specific competencies were selected:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Ethics: competencies demonstrating the ethical or\nnon-ethical conduct of nurses in leadership positions\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Interprofessional relationships: competencies demon-\nstrating correct understanding of the position of nurses\nin the health care system and their relationships to\ndoctors\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A positive attitude toward knowledge and education:\ncompetencies demonstrating the attitude of nurses in\nleadership positions toward their own and their subor-\ndinates' education\nA PA can only be successful if it includes as many differ-\nent aspects and results of employees' work as possible.\nLeadership outputs in particular should cover a wide range of\nperformance measures (Osman et al., 2011). The complex\nnature of the relationship between multiple inputs and mul-\ntiple outputs involved must be taken into account when\ndeveloping and applying competency models. The main\nresearch problem of our study was how to incorporate a large\nnumber of different aspects and results of nurse leaders'\nwork into a unified system that enables consistent classifica-\ntion. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a method that has\noften been used for performance appraisals based on a large\nnumber of inputs and outputs.\nThe main aim of this study is to assess leader performance\nin nursing care using a competency-based PA. DEA will be\nused to\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 identify the leaders with the highest and lowest per-\nformance appraisals,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 identify peers for leaders with the lowest performance\nappraisals,\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 identify what areas leaders with the lowest appraisals\nshould improve performance and quantify the perfor-\nmance improvement required in these areas, and\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 compare leadership performance among the 15 hospi-\ntals that participated in the study.\nMethod\nBasic DEA\nDEA was proposed by Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978),\nas a non-parametric method of efficiency analysis to com-\npare the relative performance of units relative to their best\npeers (efficient frontier) rather than average performers, and\nto identify benchmarks for inefficient units. The virtual pro-\nductivity ratio * o o\n= u Y v X\nr i\n* *\n/ is maximized subject to the\ncondition that the virtual ratio  of any unit j does not exceed\n1, and all the weights are strictly positive. This non-linear\nmodel can then be rewritten more explicitly in a linear for-\nSeljak and Kvas 3\nMinimize\no\no =\n=\n v x\ni ij\nr\nm\n,\nsubject to\nu y\nr rj\nr\ns\no\n=\n =\nu y - v x j , ,n,\nr\nr\ns\nrj i\ni\nm\nij\n   =\no; ...\nu v i m r s\nr i\n, ,... , & ,... ,\n = =\nwhere\no is the efficiency score of j0\nth decision-making unit\n(DMU) being assessed in the set of j = 1, . . ., n DMUs,\n is a non-Archimedean value to enforce strict positivity of\nthe weights,\nyrj is the observed amount of rth output produced by\nDMU j,\nxij is the quantity of ith input used by DMU j,\nur is the weight given to output r as determined by the linear\nprogramming, and\nvi is the weight given to input i as determined by the linear\nprogramming.\nOriginally, DEA was designed to empirically measure\nproductive efficiency of homogeneous DMUs. When\nexpanding the use of DEA to other areas (public administra-\ntion, measuring employee efficiency in various organiza-\ntions, etc.), one should ensure that the precondition of\nhomogeneity of the DMU is met. The efficiency of a DMU is\nusually influenced by a variety of factors that are difficult to\ndefine with a small number of inputs.\nDEA is most commonly used for assessing the efficiency\nof organizations and individuals. The most commonly\nassessed organizations include banks (Jablonsky, 2012),\npolice departments (Aristovnik, Seljak, & Mencinger, 2013),\nphysician practices (Rosenman & Friesner, 2004), hospitals\n(Pham, 2011), and nursing homes (Garavaglia, Lettieri,\nDEA-based employee PA or efficiency assessments are\nused for employees in industry (Tao, 2012), physicians\n(Chilingerian & Sherman, 2011), and nurses (Osman et al.,\n2011). Most of these studies assessed efficiency within a single\norganization or in similar cultural or working environments. To\ncompare employees in different organizations and at different\nlevels of leadership, the analysis must include additional vari-\nables to offset the influence of elements outside the control of\nan individual (or the organization that employs them).\nDEA With Non-Discretionary or External Inputs\nThe basic DEA models assumed that all inputs were discretion-\nary. However, in practice, the results of production processes\nalso depend on the effect of another type of variables that are\nbeyond the DMU control (Cordero, Pedraja, & Sant\u00edn, 2009).\nThese non-discretionary or external inputs affect the trans-\nformation of discretionary inputs into outputs (Ruggiero,\n1998). Therefore, the only way the DMU can correctly be\nevaluated is by taking into account the influence of those\nexternal variables on efficiency scores, so that they can be\ninterpreted as an appropriate measure of their performance.\nThis approach in the first stage estimates efficiency scores\nwith basic DEA program using only the discretionary inputs.\nThis produces a measure of the total inefficiency for the dif-\nferent DMUs comprising contributions both from the non-\ndiscretionary variables and non-measurable DMU\ninefficiency. Subsequently, a regression analysis is used in\nthe second stage to decompose both of them. Therefore,\nexogenous variables (z\nj\n) are explanatory variables, and the\ndependent variable is the first-stage efficiency score ( \n j\n;\n  \u00b5\n j j j\nf z\n= ( )+\n, .\nThis regression can be estimated by ordinary least squares,\nalthough the use of a Tobit regression is more widespread\n(Deyneli, 2011). Tobit regression is often used for data that\nare censored or truncated. Censored data occur when the val-\nues of the data are clustered around some threshold, either\nlower (left-censored) or upper (right-censored; Walker &\nMaddan, 2008). From the value of estimated coefficients, it\nis possible to identify the influential variables and their sign\n(positive or negative) and also to weigh the importance of\neach external variable in the efficiency estimate (Cordero et\nIn the third stage, DEA will be conducted using the dis-\ncretionary and non-discretionary input variables. The newly\nobtained values are introduced to the original DEA frame-\nwork as an input, adjusting for the uncontrollable environ-\nmentalfactorsthroughtheuseofacombinednon-discretionary\ninput. This model restricts the comparison set by removing\nfrom the potential reference set any DMU that has a more\nfavorable environment than the unit under analysis.\nThere has been a growing interest in the literature to study\nhow the effect of exogenous variables can be included in\nefficiency measures in such different sectors as education,\nbanking, or sports (Cordero et al., 2009). We can find articles\nthat have addressed this issue also in the health sector. DEAs\nwith non-discretionary inputs are used to compare nursing\nhomes (Fizel & Nunnikhoven, 1992), hospitals (Chilingerian\n& Sherman, 2011), or dialysis facilities (Kontodimopoulos,\nPapathanasiou, Flokou, Tountas, & Niakas, 2011).\nResearch Design and Participants\nThe study was part of a larger research project titled \"Leaders\nin Health Care.\" Following a literature review and input\nfrom an expert group, two questionnaires were designed spe-\ncifically for the purposes of the research. In the first\n4 SAGE Open\nquestionnaire, subordinates assessed the levels of 95 actions\nof their leaders. In the second questionnaire, leaders assessed\nwhat traits and characteristics they possess. Two surveys\nwere conducted within a research project carried out from\nThe survey was conducted in 13 greatest Slovenian gen-\neral and special hospitals and 2 university medical centers\nthat account for 87% of all hospital health care employees in\nSlovenia.\nThe sample from the first survey included 1,311 health\ncare professionals who assessed the level of competencies of\ntheir immediate superiors. Of the 1,311 health care profes-\nsionals, 84.3% were female. The average age of subordinates\npostsecondary or professional college, 2.7% bachelor's\ndegree or higher.\nThe sample from the second survey included 236 nurse\nleaders, who were asked to provide information regarding\ntheir education and job experience, and assess their knowl-\nedge, job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and lev-\nels of interpersonal and interprofessional relationships. The\ndata from second survey were used as discretionary inputs.\nOf the 236 nurse leaders, 7.2% were men. The average age of\nsubordinates was 42.3 years. Those who had a postsecondary\neducation or professional college comprised 88.6%, and\nthose with a bachelor's degree or higher comprised 11.4%.\nThe interconnection of the data from first and second sur-\nveys was ensured with a coding system. The data for non-\ndiscretionary inputs were obtained from hospital records.\nData\nDEA can incorporate various types of data. Our study com-\nbined interval and ordinal data. Although interval data have\nbeen used for DEA since it was developed, the use of ordinal\ndata has become more frequent only recently. Many authors\nutilized a 5-point Likert-type scale to convert qualitative data\ninto quantitative data for use in evaluations of performance\nOur study used data from various sources and aspects;\ntherefore, we also needed to prevent a possible data imbal-\nance. One of the best ways of making sure there is not much\nimbalance in the data sets is to have them at the same or simi-\nlar magnitude. A way of making sure the data are of the same\nor similar magnitude across and within data sets is to mean\nnormalize the data. The process to mean normalize is taken\nin two simple steps. First step is to find the mean of the data\nset for each input and output. The second step is to divide\neach input or output by the mean for that specific factor\n(Sarkis, 2007). Mean normalization was used to normalize\ndata for outputs and discretionary inputs.\nOutputs.The focus of our model is to enhance the output,\nrather than decrease the inputs. The outputs for evaluation\nthat can be controlled by the entities are important, because\nit is generally not very informative or motivating to be judged\non the basis of factors that you cannot control (Bogetoft &\nOtto, 2011). On the output side, it is important that the speci-\nfication encompasses the full range of leaders' behaviors.\nThe competency models are based on the assessment of\nbehavior in actual situations. Contrary to the prevailing\nmethod of self-evaluation in measuring leadership behavior,\nwe propose subordinates evaluation. The most reliable\nassessments of leaders are provided by people who are most\nfamiliar with their work--their immediate subordinates.\nSubordinates assessed 95 actions of their leaders, which\nwere divided into four groups of competencies. This resulted\nin four outputs: (a) generic competencies of leaders in public\nsector, (b) ethical competencies, (c) interprofessional rela-\ntionship, and (d) positive attitude toward knowledge and\neducation (Kvas et al., 2013). Each of the groups of compe-\ntencies was used as a single output variable, representing an\naggregate performance indicator of the level of leadership in\na specific area (Table 1).\nAssessments of each leader and their behavior provided\nus with information regarding the degree to which they meet\nthe norm defined in the competency profile. The assessed\nlevel of competencies of each nurse leader was compared\nwith leadership competency profiles developed within the\nresearch of the leadership competency model in nursing care\nThe relationship between the output variables was esti-\nmated using the Pearson's coefficient. Pearson's coefficients\np < .01 (Table 2), which means they were lower than the\nmaximum threshold, which in DEAstudies was 0.95 (Garc\u00eda-\nS\u00e1nchez, 2009). Therefore, all four were included in the\nanalysis.\nDiscretionary inputs. All discretionary inputs are (or could be)\ninfluenced by individual leaders. Input data were obtained\nfrom a survey submitted to leaders. We defined six indica-\ntors, which indicate what traits and characteristics leaders\npossess and which they presumably utilized for efficient\nleadership: (a) level of formal education, (b) skills and expe-\nrience (total years of employment), (c) self-assessment of\nknowledge, (d) job satisfaction, (e) communication and\ninterpersonal relationships, and (f) organizational culture and\ncommitment to the profession (Hogan & Nickitas, 2009;\nKvas & Seljak, 2013a; Westover, Westover, & Westover,\nPearson's coefficients among the output variables scored\nincluded in the analysis.\nNon-discretionary inputs.The second phase of the DEA\nincludes non-discretionary inputs that influence leadership\nperformance, but are not directly related to the leader. There-\nfore, influences not directly linked to an individual but rather\nto the characteristics of the hospital and their job position\nSeljak and Kvas 5\nneeded to be excluded from the first phase of DEA. Non-\ndiscretionary inputs represent characteristics of the leader's\njob position or the leader's organization: (a) the type (level)\nof leadership position, (b) number of subordinates, (c) type\nof hospital, and (d) number of health care employees.\nThe correlation between the non-discretionary inputs was\nlow. The only statistically significant correlation arose\nbetween the number of health care employees and the type of\nhospital (r = .737, p < .01). The analysis therefore includes\nall four variables.\nTable 1.

Output-oriented DEA model with constant\nreturns to scale is used in this study. Relationships between\nvariables were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. A signifi-\ncance level of alpha = .05 was used for all statistical tests.\nResults\nLeaders with an efficiency score of 100 are efficient, and less\nthan that value are categorized as inefficient (Table 3). This\nefficiency is a relative term, and it is related with a subgroup of\nindividuals with whom the examined DMU is best compared.\nA total of 203 (86%) leaders could improve their leader-\nship performance based on their potential. The average age\nare men. Thirty-three leaders achieved an efficiency score of\n100 and represent a role model for peers displaying lower\nassessments.\nTable 4 shows the basic demographic data and leadership\nperformance appraisals of the two lowest scoring leaders.\nThe performance appraisal values achieved by leaders and\npossibilities for improvement are shown for each of the four\ngroups of competencies (outputs). The assessment shows the\ndegree to which they would need to improve, based on exist-\ning inputs to achieve the performance level of their role\nmodel. Similar representations can be compiled for each of\nthe 203 leaders performing below requirements.\nLeader 1 achieved a relatively high score in ethics, but\nscored significantly lower in other areas. This leader has a\npeer within the same hospital with whom to compare himself\nor herself against and learn from and exchange experience\nwith.\nTable 3. Efficiency Scores for Nurse Leaders.\nEfficiency scorea Frequency (n, %) Sex (% of men) Age (years)\nYears of postsecondary\neducation\naValues above 100 signify that the assessed leader exceeds the norm in an individual area, whereas values below 100 signify failure to meet the norm.\nSeljak and Kvas 7\nOne of the major advantages of DEA is its ability to show\nthe improvements necessary to achieve efficiency. In the\ncomparison with the peer, Leader 1's greatest potential for\nimprovement lies in the area of generic competencies. This\nillustration shows that an increase in outputs does not depend\nmerely on the absolute values of outputs of an individual\nleader but also on peers in their organization. The logic\nbehind this example is that the improvement process begins\nwith an exchange between higher and lower scoring leaders\nwithin an organization.\nThe second poorest score was achieved by a leader whose\nassessment showed the lowest results in ethics and attitude\ntoward education. Leader 2 also has a peer within his or her\nhospital who could help improve Leader 2's outputs.\nWe then prepared an overview of leadership performance\nin all 15 hospitals within the scope of the final research ques-\ntion of the analysis (Table 5). It is in the interest of hospitals\nto use their leaders as efficiently as possible, for the perfor-\nmance of health care organizations, particularly in the public\nsector, greatly depends on the efficiency of their leaders.\nThis overview shows that eight hospitals employ efficient\nleaders who could serve as role models for their peers.\ncient leaders. The average efficiency score exceeded 80 in\nonly 3 hospitals. In comparison, the two ranking orders of\nhospital scores show certain differences. Although the hospi-\ntal with the highest score, Hospital 10, has no efficient lead-\ners, Hospital 12, with 27.8% of all highest scoring leaders,\nonly has an average performance score of 79.9, ranking\nfourth among all hospitals.\nThe ANOVA analysis reveals that arithmetic means of\nefficiency score of hospitals do not show any statistically\nsignificant differences. Therefore, we also used the post\u00adad\nhoc analysis. The lowest-ranking hospital, Hospital 4, shows\nstatistically significant differences from Hospitals 8 (p =\nhospital shows statistically significant differences from\non these results, Hospital 4 could cooperate with Hospital 8,\n10, or 12, and attempt to improve performance by exchang-\ning good practices with them. Similarly, the top-ranking\nthree hospitals could work together and organize leadership\nseminars or workshops.\nTable 5 shows the necessary percentages of improvement\nfor the four groups of competencies. The improvements are\nnecessary in the areas of competencies related to interprofes-\nsional relationships (Hospitals 7, 10, and 13) and generic\ncompetencies (all remaining hospitals).\nDiscussion\nThe poorest score was achieved in the competence area of\ngeneric competencies. The lack of generic leadership compe-\ntencies and the importance of their development in nurse\nleaders have also been shown in other studies. To achieve\nbetter leadership, in the future, nurse leaders will require a\nTable 5.

They are\nnot prepared to fully accept the role of leaders. The problem\nof role transition has also appeared in other research (Twedell\n& Jackson Gray, 2007). Nurse leaders even at the lowest\nleadership level should be aware of the importance of their\nrole as leaders and become active in developing and chang-\ning health care practices and leadership (Currie, Tolson, &\nBooth, 2007). A survey of nurse leaders in Slovenia showed\nthat nurse leaders were aware that they did not have enough\nmanagement and leadership knowledge--generic leadership\ncompetencies (Lorber & Skela Savic, 2011). This indicates\nthat the work of nurse leaders requires new knowledge that\nexpands beyond the borders of specific professional fields.\nMost continuing education programs for nurses are orga-\nnized for narrow professional fields of nurses'work (cardiol-\nogy, psychology, etc.). In addition to field-specific\nprofessional knowledge, other programs also need to be\norganized that would focus not only on a single topic or field\nbut also on comprehensive education (Yoder-Wise, 2011a).\nOne such area is leadership as it incorporates different scien-\ntific fields (human resources management, sociology, psy-\nchology, economics, etc.)\nThe second poorest score was achieved in the competence\narea of interprofessional cooperation. Leadership in nursing\ndepends on relationships within the professional group of\nnurses as well as relationships with other professions in the\nhealth care sector. These relationships depend on the role of\nthe medical profession in society and the state's approach to\nhealth and health care. In the past, the role of leader in the\nhealth care team was assumed by the physician (Hall, 2005).\nHowever, nowadays, the successful implementation of team\nwork can only be carried out through equal participation of\nall professions working in the field of health care in the form\nof interprofessional and trans-professional teams (Thylefors,\nNurse leaders would above all focus on interpersonal rela-\ntionships between nurses and other members of the health\ncare team (West & Lyubovnikova, 2013). Communications\nof nurse leaders with other leaders are frequent both inside\nand outside the organization. Best practices in health care\nteams should therefore comprise good interpersonal and\ninterprofessional relationships (Furukawa & Cunha, 2011;\nSpicer et al., 2011) that incorporate respect for the work of\nother team members. A study of other professional groups\nalso showed appropriate communication between team\nmembers (and with other stakeholders) to be an important\ncomponent of team success, being even more important than\nexperience, work history, and education (Stevenson &\nThe analysis based on our research provides important\ninformation for three groups of stakeholders:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Nurse leaders can use the analysis results as a guide-\nline for which areas they need to improve their com-\npetencies. During their studies, nurses adopt\nprofessional values and accept learning and training\nas an integral part of their profession. Based on the\nPAs, individual leaders can find peers within the orga-\nnization to serve as role models. The assessment also\nshows the degree to which they would need to improve\nto achieve the performance level of their role model.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Less efficient leaders and their role models (or \"nurse\ntrainers\") could form study groups in which they\ncould exchange ideas and learn. The highest manage-\nment structures of hospitals have the task of ensuring\nthe appropriate conditions for nurses to become and\nremain good leaders. Hospital managers need to\nensure that potential of nurse leaders is realized in the\nform of better leadership and a higher quality of health\ncare.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 National Health Service managers: All 15 participat-\ning hospitals are included in the public health care\nsystem and are, thereby, a part of the public sector.\nThe state as the owner of all public organizations\nshould understand these results as an indication that\ncertain differences in leadership performance exist.\nDifferences exist both among leaders and among hos-\npitals. The state should promote better leadership in\nnursing care through its representatives in hospital\nmanagement. The state should also, within its compe-\ntencies, organize training for nurse leaders in areas\nshowing poorer scores and promote exchanges of\ngood practices among hospitals.\nIn future, it would be worthwhile conducting the surveys\nin all Slovenian health care organizations. The study included\nonly nurse leaders in Slovenian public hospitals. Conditions\nare probably different in smaller health care organizations\n(health centers or nursing homes) and in private hospitals. A\nlarger sample of leaders would also allow for the inclusion of\nadditional inputs in the DEA.\nFurther research would also be required in assessing the\nlevel of competencies. Assessment of the competencies of\nleaders by subordinates was used in this study. The ratings\nwould have been different if assessments of superiors or\nleader self-assessments had been used. Some studies suggest\nthat these estimates could differ significantly (Kvas & Seljak,\n2013b). In the future, surveys should be carried out among\nall three groups and the evaluations compared.\nConclusion\nTasks performed by nurse leaders are similar, as are their cul-\ntural and working environments. Nurses are a professional\ngroup, and a characteristic of professional groups is that one\nSeljak and Kvas 9\ndoes not become a member solely on the basis of education\nand training but also by sharing the values of the professional\ngroup. The employees' PAs are often closely related to their\nspecific organizations. This article proposes a PA based on\ncompetency models of leadership for a larger professional\ngroup working across several different organizations, yet in\nsimilar professional and institutional environments.\nLeaders' PAs are also influenced by the characteristics of\nthe job position and organization. By including non-discre-\ntionary inputs, the analysis also takes into account these\nadditional factors. To assess the PA, this research used the\nthree-stage DEA, which incorporated both discretionary\ninputs--inputs related to leaders' characteristics, which they\ncan influence--and non-discretionary inputs on which lead-\ners have no influence, at least not in the short term. This\nenabled us to ensure better comparability among leaders\nemployed in different organizations and improved the homo-\ngeneity of the DMU. The calculated values of leadership per-\nformance allow comparisons among leaders employed in\ndifferent organizations.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAristovnik, A., Seljak, J., & Mencinger, J.
