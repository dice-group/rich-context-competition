We argue that a better understanding of how\ntraditional institutions affect cooperation will provide key\ninsights into how mobilization plays out in local communi-\nties. Specifically, we posit that traditional institutions but-\ntress cooperation by providing the selective incentives\nnecessary to solve collective action problems. To test this\nargument, we worked with the Buganda Kingdom in\nUganda, one of the oldest and largest pre-colonial institu-\ntions remaining in Africa, and employ a lab-in-the-field\nexperiment using modified public goods games. The exper-\nimental design allows us to test two possible causal mecha-\nnisms through which traditional institutions might affect\ncooperation and mobilization: a horizontal mechanism\ndriven by peer-to-peer effects; and a vertical mechanism\ndriven by access to social hierarchies. We find evidence for\nthe latter, and none for the former. This suggests that tradi-\ntional institutions increase cooperation because individu-\nals' expect that their cooperation and investment will be\nrewarded by social elites, rather than through an increase in\nthe salience of ethnic identity among co-ethnics. Our find-\nings not only speak to the role of traditional institutions in\nthese communities, but may also be informative for other\ncontexts in which culturally-based institutions and recog-\nnized representatives of identity-based groups (e.g., reli-\ngious leaders) can align individual interests to increase\nsocial cooperation in their constituencies to overcome col-\nlective action problems.\nTraditional institutions and social\ncooperation: Experimental evidence\nfrom the Buganda Kingdom\nMitchell Goist1 and Florian G.

While in Sub-\nSaharan Africa, traditional institutions have undergone\nsignificant changes during colonial and postcolonial peri-\nods, several scholars have recently shown the persisting\nimportance of traditional political institutions (for an over-\nRegarding contemporary traditional institutions, using\ndata from the Afrobarometer, Logan (2013) demonstrates\nthat constituents across the continent see traditional leaders\nas influential local actors. In her work, Baldwin (2013,\nleaders as \"development brokers,\" and how they leverage\npublic goods provision to mobilize constituents. Koter\n(2013) shows that where strong traditional leaders exist,\ncross-ethnic allegiances can emerge when political candi-\ndates, via these intermediaries, reach out to non-co-ethnic\ncommunities. Baldwin and Mvukiyehe (2015) demonstrate\nthat chiefs selected by customary mechanisms perform bet-\nter in providing public order in Liberia.\nYet, the link between traditional institutions and collec-\ntive mobilization in contemporary politics is still insuffi-\nciently understood. For instance, in explaining the positive\neffects that Gennaioli and Rainer (2007) find linking central-\nized traditional institutions with local public goods provi-\nsion, they are careful to highlight their findings as association,\nnot causation. Similarly, in their analysis of regional devel-\nopment patterns, Michalopoulos and Papaioannou empha-\nsize that, while robust, their results do not imply causation\nfurther research into the causal channels behind their find-\nings. Our study constitutes an attempt to identify the causal\nmechanisms by which contemporary traditional institutions\naffect social cooperation by using an experimental design.\nTheory and hypotheses\nWe assume that traditional institutions provide the mecha-\nnism through which co-ethnics can better solve collective\naction problems. We hold that signalling to constituents\nthat traditional institutions are involved in collective action\nscenarios cues the trust individuals have in their traditional\npolity, and assures participants that greater utility through\ncooperation--the collectively and individually more desir-\nable outcome than mutual defection--is achievable. This,\nin turn, increases the potential of constituents to cooperate\nfor a collective cause.1 In other words, if constituents find\nthemselves in situations of uncertainty which may lead to\ncollectively inefficient outcomes, the involvement of tradi-\ntional institutions and their representatives may offer\nassurance that individual contributions and investments\nwill be rewarded, thereby fostering cooperation. Thus, our\ngeneral hypothesis H\nis:\nH\nIf the involvement of traditional institutions in col-\nlective action is signaled to constituents, cooperation\namong constituents increases.\nWe assume that traditional institutions in general foster\nsocial cooperation. We use a stronger and a weaker defini-\ntion of constituents: the stronger definition entails individu-\nals whose ethnic identification matches that of the\ntraditional polity (co-ethnics). That is, respondents of the\nBaganda ethnic group may place trust in the institution of\nthe Kabaka and the Kingdom. The weaker definition refers\nto individuals who live within the geographic sphere of\ninfluence of the traditional polity (co- and non-co-ethnics).\nFor example, an individual identifying as Munyankole who\nlives in Kampala among a majority of Muganda may also\nadhere to calls for immunization by the Buganda Kingdom.\nUsing the stronger and weaker definitions reflects recent\nevidence, showing that ethnic identification can go beyond\none's core group if linked to potential public goods provi-\nsion because of the local ethnic geography (Ichino and\nNathan, 2013), and that governance authorities are strategic\nin their activities regarding the provision of public goods\ndepending on the ethnic setup of their constituency\n(Ejdemyr et al., Forthcoming).\nWe identify two causal mechanisms which may foster\nethnic identification and cooperation involving traditional\ninstitutions: (a) a horizontal \"peer\" effect; and (b) a vertical\neffect based on social hierarchies of the polity. We discuss\neach related hypothesis in order:\nH\nHorizontal signaling of support for the traditional\ninstitution to peers increases cooperation among\nconstituents.\nConstituents can signal their support for the involved\ntraditional institution to each other. This horizontal signal-\ning may increase contributions to the public good, as it cues\na coherent group identity, and fosters a constituent's trust in\nher/his peers' contribution. Constituents may rally even\nwithout their traditional leader instigating mobilization, by\nreferencing their institution to each other. This horizontal\nsignaling may trigger an increase in the salience of group\nidentity, which would buttress cooperation. This increased\nsalience could provide a greater psychological utility to the\nindividual, thereby balancing the cost the individual incurs\nfrom engaging in collective action.\nH\nVertical signaling of support for the traditional\ninstitution to traditional representatives increases coop-\neration among constituents.\nGoist and Kern 3\nThat is, constituents can signal their support for the\ninvolved traditional institution to that institution's repre-\nsentatives. This vertical signaling may increase contribu-\ntions to the public good, with constituents under the hope or\nexpectation that their contribution is rewarded at some\nfuture point, given their previous experience with public\ngoods provision of traditional institutions and their legiti-\nmate representatives. Signaling can happen via popular\nelections, although these frequently do not exist in more\ncentralized traditional polities. Alternatively, constituents\ncan voice their support or critique to representatives of the\norganization of the traditional polity, for example, village\nlevel chiefs or traditional bureaucracies who communicate\nthe critique through the ranks, similar to mechanisms in\nsmaller, more decentralized polities. This theory suggests\nthat selective incentives, in the form of increased favor with\nsuperior traditional representatives, provides the benefit to\noverride costs incurred from collective action. Mares and\nYoung (2016) provide related evidence that traditional\nleaders provide these selective incentives, in the form of\nboth positive and negative inducements, to further clien-\ntelistic practices. Similarly, Gottlieb (2017) suggests that\ntraditional leaders can employ threats of retribution to\nencourage pro-social behavior in a lab-in-the-field experi-\nment in Senegal.\nExperimental design\nThe Buganda Kingdom as a target polity\nThe Buganda Kingdom represents a prominent case of a tra-\nditional polity, since it plays a significant role in Ugandan\npolitics (Englebert, 2002; Lindemann and Goodfellow,\n2013). Buganda is the most influential of the constitutionally\nrecognized traditional institutions in Uganda. With about\n17% of the population identifying as Baganda, the ethnic\ngroup constitutes the largest in the country. Over 40% of\nMuganda constituents surveyed in the Afrobarometer (2009)\nsay they trust their traditional leaders \"a lot,\" and a majority\nof about the same percentage would like their influence to\n\"increase a lot.\" The king (kabaka), his administration, and\nparliament (lukiiko) are based in Kampala, Uganda's capital.\nToday, the Kingdom lays claims to much of the land in\nUganda's Central Region, and is frequently in open conflict\nwith the Ugandan government, which is dominated by\nPresident Museveni's co-ethnics, the Muyankole.\nThe partner in our experiment, the Buganda Cultural and\nDevelopment Foundation (BUCADEF), was established by\nthe Buganda Kingdom as a non-governmental organization\nin 1994 \"spearheading and directing social economic devel-\nopment in communities.\"2 To fund some of its activities in\nareas such as food security or sanitation, the BUCADEF\nprovides certificates to recognize individual donations and\ncontributions. For their donation to the Kingdom, benefac-\ntors receive a formal certificate stating the amount of the\ndonation, and displaying a text in Luganda language \"bless-\ning\" the donor, the seal of the Buganda Kingdom, as well as\nthe signature of the prime minister of Buganda (the Katikiro).\nBoth the success of the BUCADEF's efforts and previous\nwork suggest that these certificates are highly prized and\nconsidered a badge of social honor.3\nSample and experimental game\nTo tease out the causal mechanisms linking traditional\ninstitutions and social cooperation, we employ an experi-\nmental design. While observational methods might allow\nus to test hypothesis H\n, without experimental manipula-\ntion, it would be impossible to disentangle horizontal and\nvertical effects, as both are a large part of the Kingdom's\nofficial recruitment strategies. Therefore, a lab-in-the-field\napproach provides an opportunity to disentangle the iso-\nlated effects of each theoretical mechanism in a controlled\nenvironment. Due to space constraints, the online\nAppendices B, C, and D present the sample selection strat-\negy and sample details, the enumerator instructions, and the\naccompanying survey questionnaire employed several days\nprior to the intervention. Overall, we aimed at a sample of\n225 participants with 75 individuals for each of three treat-\nment conditions (see below), to which participants were\nassigned randomly upon arrival at the experimental site.\nOur primary outcome of interest is cooperative social\nbehavior. Following the behavioral economics literature,\nwe operationalize this outcome with a public goods game.\nIn the classic public goods game set-up, each individual is\nprovided with an endowment, from which they can allocate\nany amount to a central pot, keep it themselves, or split\ntheir endowment between the two options. All contribu-\ntions to the central pot are multiplied by 1.5, and then\ndivided evenly among the participants. In this set-up, it is\nindividually rational to defect and keep one's entire endow-\nment. However, we suggest that due to the salience of the\nKingdom, our treatment conditions may cause individuals\nto select the socially optimal solution and contribute a\ngreater portion of their endowment to the public goods pot.\nAt this point, our design diverges from the classic public\ngoods game set-up. In addition to the contributions being\ndivided evenly and returned to the players, in our design\nparticipants are informed that all contributions would be\nmatched and given to a charitable organization. This does\nnot alter the individual payouts that would be received from\na standard public goods game. There are three groups or\nexperimental conditions, to which participants were\nassigned at random. The first, or secular condition, is that all\ncontributions to the central pot would be matched, and the\nsum donated to a local school that caters to orphans and\nother disadvantaged children within Nansana district (the\nlocation of our experiment). Any individual who chooses to\ncontribute could also opt to receive a certificate bearing\ntheir name, the seal of the school, and the amount of their\n4 Research and Politics \ndonation. The second, or horizontal condition, also matches\neach player's contribution to the pot, but instead donates the\nmoney to the BUCADEF. In this condition, respondents are\nalso given the choice to receive a certificate closely resem-\nbling the original, bearing their name, the original Buganda\nKingdom seal, and the amount of their contribution.4 The\nfinal, or vertical condition, also matches each player's con-\ntribution to the pot and donates the money to the BUCADEF,\nbut instead of a certificate, the player is given the choice to\nsign a letter to the Director of the BUCADEF, disclosing\ntheir name and the amount that they contributed.5 These\nconditions are summarized in Table 1, and the materials\n(i.e., sample certificates in Luganda and letter in English)\nprovided to the recipients are shown in Figure 1 (Panels 1\nand 2) and Figure 2.\nThe control condition--that is, where matched contribu-\ntions to the public goods game are provided to the local\nschool--is designed to isolate the effect of altruism. In\nother words, this allows us to distinguish whether or not\nrespondents are responding to an explicitly ethnic appeal to\ncontribute to a good cause, or whether they only wish to\ncontribute to local public goods provision, and are indiffer-\nent as to the ethnic character of that contribution.\nThe first treatment, corresponding to the horizontal\nhypothesis, is ecologically valid, due to the previously dis-\ncussed policy of the BUCADEF providing similar certifi-\ncates to benefactors. We argue that this proxies peer-to-peer\neffects, as individuals can only display the certificates to\nfriends and acquaintances, thereby signaling their commit-\nment to the ethnic institutions, but not garnering them spe-\ncial favor with representatives of the Kingdom. Our\nargument is that this provides the potential for a positive\ninducement towards cooperation, as individuals receive a\npsychological utility for contributing to the Kingdom's\nefforts and receiving an official certificate from the\nKingdom, and/or that individuals receive a social utility\nfrom displaying this certificate, which would be widely\nrecognized throughout the territorial jurisdiction of the\nKingdom, to members of their social network.\nThe second treatment does the opposite. The letters were\ncollected at the end of the game and hand delivered to the\nhead of the BUCADEF. This does not allow the individual\nto signal to their peers that they contributed to the ethnic\ninstitution, but instead allows them to potentially curry\nfavor, receive recognition, or encourage service provision\nby Kingdom institutions. It is this potential for future ser-\nvice delivery, or the chance to make a contact with a power-\nful agent of the Kingdom, that we suggest will induce\ncooperation under the vertical hypothesis. It is important to\nnote that our design somewhat differs from findings by oth-\ners studying traditional leaders, in that the design itself, due\nto anonymity concerns, explicitly rules out the chance for\nretribution or negative inducements towards cooperation\nappeal to traditional institutions under the vertical condi-\ntion only contains the potential for positive, or reciprocal,\ninducements to cooperate, and precludes the possibility that\nindividuals would be sanctioned for their lack of\ncontribution.\nA similar condition, that is, a letter provided to the school\nheadmaster was deemed unnecessary, as the headmaster was\nTable 1.

Sample certificates.\nGoist and Kern 5\npresent when we played the games, in the general intake\narea, but was not present in the room where the actual games\nwere being played.6 This allowed individuals who donated\nto the school to discuss their contributions with him, thereby\nobviating the need for a formal letter. The dual effect of the\ncontrol condition, providing both peer-to-peer and vertical\nrecognition of a contribution to a secular institution, biases\nagainst a finding in either of the BUCADEF conditions.\nDiscussion of the design\nBefore turning to the analysis, we ease two possible con-\ncerns with our design at the outset. The first would be that\nrespondents were induced to contribute, not, as we hypoth-\nesize, to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the\nBaganda polity (the vertical condition), or benefits they\nwould receive from displaying the certificate to their peers\n(the horizontal condition), but rather by the threat of social\nsanctioning. We argue that these concerns are misguided.\nContributions were made confidentially, with only the enu-\nmerator able to determine the amount each individual con-\ntributed. Furthermore, certificates were handed out after the\nexperiment concluded, and on an individual basis. Finally,\nduring this entire process, no names were ever recorded.\nThe only exception--if an individual chose to provide his\nor her name on the letter to the BUCADEF--would have\ntaken place after the game concluded. The lack of names\nand the secrecy with which contributions were recorded\nstrongly minimized the threat of sanction as a potential\nmechanism driving our results.\nThe second, and perhaps more serious matter, is that we\ndo not have a fully saturated design by eschewing a sepa-\nrate secular analogue to the vertical condition. The concern\nhere may be that treatments included only a letter to the\nBUCADEF, and, because they were not provided with a\nletter to the school, that this some how biases our findings.\nFigure 2. Buganda Cultural and Development Foundation sample letter.\n6 Research and Politics \nHowever, this was a conscious design choice on our part to\nenhance ecological validity.As stated before, we argue that,\nwith the headmaster present after the debriefing, we create\na stronger control condition that potentially biases against\nour results.\nTo illustrate our argument, it is helpful to consider pos-\nsible confounding explanations that would explain a posi-\ntive finding for the vertical condition. The first is that\nrespondents chose to donate more, not due to any features\nof the Kingdom itself, but rather out of a sense of altruism.\nBy including the secular control condition benefiting the\nlocal school, if altruism were driving our results, we would\nexpect even contributions among all conditions. A critical\nreader might suggest that altruism is still driving our results,\nhowever, as it produces greater contributions to the\nKingdom because individuals judge the BUCADEF as a\nmore reliable provider of community goods. If this were the\ncase, then we would expect even contributions in both the\nvertical and horizontal conditions.\nThe only plausible confounding relationship that would\nproduce a false positive finding in favor of the vertical\ncondition would be that individuals have a strong prefer-\nence to write letters, for the sake of writing letters. For\nexample, one could argue, if there was an increase in con-\ntributions under the horizontal treatment, this could be\nexplained by people merely preferring certificates, which\ncould have some utility in and of themselves. This is why\nwe provided a similar treatment for the horizontal condi-\ntion. However, we see no reason to suspect that individu-\nals value a letter, a copy of which they do not get to keep\nor ever see again, for the sake of a letter itself, and rather\neschew an analogous, secular control for the vertical treat-\nment. In other words, our assumption is rather that the\nletter is useful only insofar as it allows access to social\nhierarchies that the respondent deems advantageous,\nwhich is exactly the theoretical mechanism that we pro-\npose under the vertical hypothesis. For this effect to be\nobserved without the social-hierarchy explanation being\ntrue, there would have to be a plausible explanation for\npeople preferring to contribute under the vertical condi-\ntion independent of: (a) altruism; (b) ethnic affiliation (as\nthis would suggest equal contributions under both the ver-\ntical and horizontal treatment); or (c) perceived social\npressure from other participants (since the contributions\nunder the vertical and horizontal treatments go to the same\nplace, it is assumed that any social desirability bias\ntowards increasing contributions would be the same).\nAnalysis\nThe results confirm the vertical hypothesis, and show no\nsignificant difference (substantively or statistically) for the\nhorizontal hypothesis. Table 2 provides the mean and stand-\nard deviations of the outcome, or the amount of money con-\ntributed by each individual during the public goods game.\nEach of the three experimental conditions consisted of 75\nindividuals, each randomly assigned to playing one round\nof the public goods game \u00ad thus, overall our experiment\ninvolved 225 participants. Figure 3 shows the distribution\nof the outcome, as well as the horizontal and vertical condi-\ntions. This figure shows that the larger mean of the vertical\ngroup is largely due to the increased density in the amount\nof individuals that contributed their entire endowment,\nwhich is the social optimum of the public goods game. This\nis reassuring, because it suggests that increased cooperation\nis actually leading to greater payouts to all members, and is\nnot about sacrificing individual benefit. Furthermore, this\ngives us confidence that participants understood the game\nand correctly weighed their incentives.\nIn addition to the Student's t-test, we avoid making par-\nametric assumptions by using a permutation test to com-\npare the observed values from the experiment with\npotential other draws from the resampled outcome distri-\nbution. As discussed in the design section, each individual\nin the experiment was randomly assigned to one of the\nexperimental conditions. The permutation test re-assigns\nexperimental conditions for the 225 other values resam-\npled from the outcome distribution. In other words, a per-\nmutation test mimics the logic of counterfactual analysis,\nby illustrating the distribution of outcomes if respondents\nin the control group were assigned treatment and vice\nversa. Unlike a t-test, which assumes a sampling distribu-\ntion in order to generate null-hypothesis significance tests,\na permutation test rebuilds a sampling distribution from\nobserved data. In this regard, it is similar to bootstrap or\njacknife methods of inference.\nThe logic of the permutation test is illustrated in Figure\n4, which confirms the earlier result: there is no discernible\nor significant difference in average contributions in the\nhorizontal condition, but there is a significant and positive\nshift in contributions in the vertical group. Figure 4 dis-\nplays the sampling distribution calculated by resampling\n2000 times from observed outcomes, and then shuffling\ntreatment and control conditions to obtain a distribution of\npotential effect sizes. The blue line illustrates the observed\neffect given the actual assignment of treatment and control\nconditions. As is evident from Figure 4, this effect in the\nvertical condition represents one of the strongest possible\neffects given the observed data, where it falls roughly in the\ncenter for the horizontal condition.\nTable 2. Difference in means.\nCondition Mean\ncontribution\n(USh)\nStandard deviation\ncontribution\n(USh)\nStudent's t (Ha\n:\ngreater) p-value\nGoist and Kern 7\nDiscussion and conclusion\nSignaling to constituents the involvement of traditional\ninstitutions and their representatives in collective action\nmay indeed increase cooperation among individuals (H\n).\nThe presented results suggest the relevance of the mecha-\nnism put forward in hypothesis H\n: vertical signaling\nbetween ethnic constituents and traditional institutions can\nbe a crucial instrument for collective action. This speaks to\nstudies assuming the path dependence of pre-colonial polit-\nical setups and related effects on public goods provision\ntoday (e.g., Gennaioli and Rainer, 2007). Our analysis of\nthe vertical mechanism contributes to the understanding of\nthe contemporary significance of traditional political insti-\ntutions and how they assure individuals to take part in\ncollective action and the provision of public goods. These\ntheoretical and empirical claims are corroborated by recent\nevents, for example, the involvement of the Mogho Naba,\nking of the Mossi, in the deal to re-establish an administra-\ntion after a military takeover in Burkina Faso.7 We find no\nsignificant difference in effects for hypothesis H\non the\nhorizontal signaling between constituents for mobilization.\nOverall, this may indicate that the identification mecha-\nnism primarily runs between constituents and the tradi-\ntional polity, rather than between constituents.\nOur findings and theoretical propositions show the\npotential for further exploration of the link between tradi-\ntional institutions, social cooperation, and mobilization.\nFirst, moving forward, similar dynamics could be tested\nFigure 3.

Second, the mobilization potential of tra-\nditional institutions could be compared with those of other\nactors, such as state or religious authorities.
