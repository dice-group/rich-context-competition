A survey of law enforcement agencies in the\nUnited States in 2014 offers a comparison suggesting a small but statistically significant effect: Political attitudes were\ncorrelated with assessment of threats posed by Muslim extremists, and threat assessment was not correlated with the\nnumber of Muslim Americans who had engaged in violent extremism within the agency's jurisdiction. By contrast, the\nperceived threat of right-wing terrorism was correlated with the number of incidents of right-wing violence and not\nwith political attitudes. These findings reflect the context of growing polarization of attitudes toward Muslims in the\nUnited States as well as the challenge of bringing counterterrorism policies into proportion with the actual scale of\nviolent extremism.\n",

In this view, security\npolicies and priorities are not direct reflections of relative\nthreats to public safety but are mediated by ideological con-\nsiderations that heighten the risks associated with some forms\nof threat and downplay others. With respect to Muslim\nextremism, arguably the defining threat of the present era, this\nperspective argues that certain government officials, policy\nexperts, and sectors of the public have exaggerated the scale\nof the threat, spending fortunes, instituting mass surveillance,\nand demonizing suspect populations as a result (Kundnani\nThis article offers a statistical test of this hypothesis by\ncomparing threat assessments by law enforcement agencies\naround the United States as recorded in a survey in the first\nhalf of 2014.

Terrorism, which occu-\npied a relatively minor place in the 2000 National Security\nstrategy (Bush 2002). A new federal agency was created with\ncounterterrorism responsibilities (the Transportation Security\nAdministration), others were combined into a new\nDepartment of Homeland Security whose primary mission\nwas to prevent terrorism in the United States (U.S. Congress\n2002), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) made\nterrorism its top priority (R.

[and] may prove to be as dangerous as groups\nlike al Qaeda, if not more so\" (R. S. Mueller 2006).\nThis \"evolving\" threat, \"as dangerous as\" the threats iden-\ntified right after 9/11, \"if not more so,\" became the official\nassessment of federal law enforcement agencies. In 2012, for\nexample, a year when the FBI indicted only 11 people for\noffenses related to international terrorism (Department of\nJustice 2016) and no attacks were carried out by Muslim\nextremists in the United States (Kurzman 2013), R. S.\nMueller(2012)reaffirmedtoCongressthat\"Counterterrorism\nremains our top priority. . . . The terrorist threat is more\ndiverse than it was 10 years ago,\" he explained, and \"home-\ngrown violent extremists . . . are increasingly savvy and\nwilling to act alone, which makes them difficult to find and\nto stop.\" James Clapper (2012), Director of National\nIntelligence, echoed this theme: While al-Qaeda has \"weak-\nened significantly,\" some homegrown violent extremists\n(HVE) \"have exhibited improved tradecraft and operational\nsecurity and increased willingness to consider less sophisti-\ncated attacks, which suggests the HVE threat may be evolv-\ning.\" Janet Napolitano (2012), Secretary of the Department\nof Homeland Security (DHS), made a similar point: \"While\nwe have made significant progress, threats from terrorism--\nincluding, but not limited to al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda related\ngroups--persist and continually evolve, and the demands on\nDHS continue to grow.\"\nFederal counterterrorism efforts focused almost exclu-\nsively on Muslim extremists rather than other forms of\nextremism. The National Strategy for Combating Terrorism\n(later renamed the National Strategy for Counterterrorism)\nmade no mention of any other form of terrorism (White\nprimer on radicalization dynamics produced by the\nNational Counterterrorism Center (NCTC 2012:3), noted\nexplicitly that it \"focuses on radicalization inspired by al-\nQa'ida and related groups that target US Muslims. . . .\nThere are other types of extremists--such as white suprem-\nacists and ecoterrorists--who commit violence in this\ncountry and are of concern to law enforcement, but such\nextremists are not specifically addressed here\" (see also\nA Control Case: Right-Wing\nExtremism\nAs it happens, one of these other types of extremism--(non-\nMuslim) right-wing extremism--generated a comparable\nnumber of fatalities to Muslim extremism and can serve as a\ncontrol case to test for ideological influences on threat\nassessment.\nRight-wing extremism encompasses a variety of ideolo-\ngies, including anti-government, sovereign citizen, and\nwhite supremacist movements (Balleck 2014; Caiani, della\nThe U.S. government has expressed concern about the vio-\nlent potential of these movements for many years, espe-\ncially after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the deadliest\nattack by domestic terrorists in U.S. history. An FBI assess-\nment in 2007 concluded that \"Militias and sovereign citi-\nzens demonstrated intent to harm and harass federal and\nstate judges, other officers of the court, and government\nemployees,\" although \"very few went beyond paper terror-\nism tactics to commit direct acts of violence or terrorism.\"\nrorism division were assigned to \"domestic terrorism\" in\n(The FBI categorizes almost all extremism by Muslims in\nKurzman et al. 3\nthe United States as \"international terrorism,\" on the pre-\nsumption that it is inspired overseas.)\nIn 2009, the Department of Homeland Security warned of\na possible upsurge in right-wing extremism (DHS 2009) but\nretracted the report and shut down the office that produced it\nafter complaints from conservatives who believed the report\ncast unwarranted suspicion on Americans with conservative\nbeliefs (Johnson 2012). (Similar complaints by Muslim\nAmericans about reports on Muslim extremism did not lead\nto retractions or offices being shut down.) \"The threat is\nreal,\" a Department of Justice trainer told local law enforce-\nment officers at a workshop on domestic terrorism in 2014.\n\"Since 2000, 35 law enforcement officers have been killed in\n26 incidents in which at least one of the suspects was a right-\nwing criminal extremist\" (Harris 2014). The Department of\nJustice has offered law enforcement training on right-wing\nviolence since 1996, soon after the Oklahoma City bombing\nBy the start of 2014, when we carried out our survey of\nlaw enforcement agencies, the amount of violence attributed\nto right-wing extremists was similar to or greater than vio-\nlence attributed to Muslim extremists.1 The Global Terrorism\nDatabase, maintained by the START Center at the University\nassociated with right-wing ideologies and 24 attacks by\nwing attacks resulted in fewer fatalities (17 vs. 24).2 The\nInternational Security Program at the New America\nist\" homegrown extremists and 21 fatalities from \"jihadist\"\nextremists through the end of 2013.

Right-wing extremists accounted\nfor 66 violent plots over the same period, including 31\nUsing a broader definition that includes hate crimes, Arie\nPerliger (2012) of the Combating Terrorism Center at the\nU.S. Military Academy counted 3,375 right-wing attacks\nrelationship between hate crimes and far-right ideological\nviolence, see Adamczyk et al. 2014; Dunbar, Blanco, and\nCr\u00e8vecoeur-MacPhail 2016; Mills, Freilich, and Chermak\nforthcoming.)\nNeither Muslim nor right-wing violent extremism\naccounted for a large proportion of violence in the United\nextremism was responsible for less than 1 percent of this\ntotal.

The proportion of murders due to violent\nextremism remained under 1 percent of the overall toll.)\nWhile the numbers have been relatively small, the compari-\nson of Muslim and right-wing extremists provides an oppor-\ntunity to identify ideological influences in the assessment of\neach form of threat.\nIdeological Polarization\nThe comparison of Muslim and right-wing violent extrem-\nism takes place against a backdrop of increasing ideologi-\ncal polarization in the United States (Abramowitz 2010;\nCampbell 2016). Although most Americans agree on most\nissues (Fiorina 2011), partisan identities manifest them-\nselves in a number of hot-button issues that have come to\nsymbolize our era. One of these issues is the place of Islam\nin America. As recently as the fall of 2001, however, that\nwas not the case.\nSix days after 9/11, President George W. Bush visited a\nmosque two miles from the White House and delivered a\nspeech praising Islam and Muslim Americans. \"Like the\ngood folks standing with me, the American people were\nappalled and outraged at last Tuesday's attacks. And so were\nMuslims all across the world,\" Bush (2011) said. \"The face\nof terror is not the true faith of Islam. That's not what Islam\nis all about. Islam is peace.\" As a Christian, Bush was not\nespecially qualified to interpret the meaning of Islam. But as\na public official who considered Islamic terrorism his num-\nber one priority, Bush did not want the war on terrorism to\nbe viewed as a war on Islam. In particular, Bush was con-\ncerned that vigilante attacks on Muslim Americans would\nundermine his administration's efforts to mobilize the\nworld's Muslims against al-Qaeda and other revolutionary\nwas an uptick in violence attributed to Muslim extremists, although\nthe scale of violence remained low (Kurzman 2016a).\n2After a review of all of the incident descriptions and notes in the\ndata set, right-wing ideologies were identified by the keywords\nabortion, Ku Klux Klan, Minutemen, Nazi, white, supremacist, anti-\ngovernment, pro-life, hate, gun, and anti-IRS and by targets includ-\ning reproductive, health, mosque, Obama, liberal, Holocaust, and\nSikh. Muslim extremism was identified by the keywords Muslim,\nArab, Taliban, Islam, Allah, Osama, Nidal, and Palestinan and by\ntargets including Israel and marathon.\n3Chermak and Gruenewald (2015) present totals for the period\nperiod, the pre-9/11 period, and the post-9/11 period. We estimated\nthe number of extremists post-9/11 by comparing the percentage\nmale in each period.\n4 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World \ngroups. Bush denounced such attacks as illegal and immoral\nas well as counterproductive. \"Those who feel like they can\nintimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger don't\nrepresent the best of America,\" Bush stated. \"They represent\nthe worst of humankind, and they should be ashamed of that\nkind of behavior.\" Even as the Bush administration placed\nMuslims in the United States under special scrutiny\n(Bakalian and Bozorgmehr 2009), officials were careful not\nto demonize the community whose assistance they sought in\npreventing terrorism.\nA series of surveys suggests that most Americans shared\nthe Bush administration's reluctance to denounce Muslims in\ngeneral. One of the most commonly asked items on this sub-\nject was some version of the question, \"Is your overall opin-\nion of Muslims very favorable, mostly favorable, mostly\nunfavorable, or very unfavorable?\" The question is an imper-\nfect indicator since it forces people to generalize about an\nentire group in a way that may not reflect more complex\njudgments, but it has been asked so often in nationally repre-\nsentative samples--24 times since 9/11--that it allows for\ncomparison over time. Unfavorable attitudes toward\nMuslims--combining somewhat unfavorable and very unfa-\nvorable, when both options were offered--rose from a\nmedian of 24 percent in the first eight surveys after 9/11\nThese surveys are summarized in Figure 1. (An even steeper\nrise is visible in 33 surveys asking about favorable and\nunfavorable attitudes toward Islam, where unfavorable\nresponses outnumber favorable responses beginning in 2006.\nThe rise in unfavorable attitudes is not so pronounced in 13\nsurveys asking about favorable and unfavorable attitudes\ntoward Muslim Americans; Kurzman 2014a.)\nThe overall rise in unfavorable attitudes toward Muslims\nwas accompanied by a striking rise in polarization. In sur-\nveys for which partisan breakdowns are available, the differ-\nence between Republicans' and Democrats' attitudes toward\nMuslims, also shown in Figure 1, rose from a median of 8\nThis trend toward polarization is not limited to party iden-\ntification but is also evident with ideological identification:\nThe gap between self-identified conservatives and liberals\n(four surveys), although we have found no survey data using\nthese categories after that year.\nOther data sources tell a similar story of polarization. The\nAmerican National Election Studies (ANES) of 2004 and\n2012, for example, included a \"feeling thermometer\" asking\nrespondents to rate their feeling toward Muslims on a scale\nfrom 0 (very cold and unfavorable) to 100 (very warm and\nfavorable). The gap in the mean rating of \"extremely liberal\"\nand \"extremely conservative\" respondents widened from 13\ndifferent metric, sociologists Clem Brooks and Jeff Manza\nFigure 1. Americans' unfavorable attitudes toward Muslims since 9/11, by party affiliation.\nKurzman et al. 5\npositive attitudes toward \"allowing law enforcement to bring\nin for questioning people of certain ethnic backgrounds if\nthese groups are thought to be more likely to engage in ter-\nrorist activities.\"\nThis polarization coincided with a campaign to cast suspi-\ncion on Muslims in the United States as potential terrorists\nand on American liberals as enablers of terrorism. Funded by\nconservative foundations and donors, this campaign encour-\naged media messaging and local mobilizations to block\nmosque construction, introduce legislation against shari'a\nlaw, and demand profiling of Muslims by law enforcement\nagencies to counteract a supposed plot by Muslims to under-\nYazdiha 2014). The campaign also cast liberals' defense of\nMuslims' rights as a front for terrorism and a betrayal of\nsociologist Christopher Bail (2015), fringe anti-Muslim\norganizations managed to get their message increasingly into\nmainstream media coverage of Muslims and developed\ninterlocking board memberships with mainstream conserva-\ntive organizations. Some anti-Muslim activists, posing as\nexperts on Islamic extremism, were hired to train law\nenforcement officers and military personnel (Sacirbey 2014);\naccording to an internal FBI review, 392 training presenta-\ntions contained \"offensive\" stereotypes of Muslims and\nIslam (Durbin 2012). The polarization of attitudes toward\nMuslims was vividly displayed in responses to these pur-\nported experts. The Obama administration, which entered\noffice in 2009, tried to remove anti-Muslim activists from its\npool of trainers in countering violent extremism (CVE), the\nphrase it adopted in place of counterterrorism (Cole 2012;\nDepartment of Defense 2011). By contrast, the Republican\nParty increasingly embraced anti-Muslim activists, who\nwere named as advisers to all of the leading presidential\nThe campaigns of Mitt Romney and Donald Trump, for\nexample, both affiliated themselves with an anti-Muslim\nactivist who had expressed the paranoid concern that Muslim\nextremists \"are already in possession of weapons of mass\ndestruction inside the United States\" and may have \"infil-\ntrated the agencies that protect national security--the FBI,\nDHS, Defense Department, military, and other institutions\"\nUnfounded suspicion of American Muslims escalated to\nthe point that many non-Muslims were willing to consider\nbanning the practice of Islam in the United States. In a sur-\nvey in October 2015, 67 percent of self-identified Democrats\nsaid Islam should be legal, 15 percent said it should be ille-\ngal, and 18 percent said they were not sure. Among self-\nidentified Independents, the responses were 60 percent\nlegal, 20 percent illegal, and 19 percent not sure.\nOnly two-thirds of these subsamples considered Muslims\ndeserving of freedom of religion, which is commonly hailed\nas a bedrock principle of Constitutional protection and\ninternational human rights (U.S. Commission on\nInternational Religious Freedom 2016:9). Among self-\nidentified Republicans, this proportion was less than half:\nOnly 40 percent said Islam should be legal, while 36 per-\ncent said it should be illegal, and 25 percent were not sure\nLocal Law Enforcement and Violent\nExtremism\nIn the aftermath of 9/11, many state and local law enforce-\nment agencies--municipal police departments, sheriffs'\noffices, state departments of public safety, and other agen-\ncies--increased their emphasis on terrorism prevention. In a\nsurvey of 219 state and local law enforcement leaders in\ninspired operational and/or policy changes in their agency\nThe federal government enlisted local law enforcement in\nthis mission. In 2003, the Bush administration began to\nestablish \"fusion centers\" around the United States to coordi-\nnate activities by local law enforcement officials and federal\ncounterterrorism officials. Within a decade, more than 70\nsuch centers were in operation (Monahan and Regan 2012;\n2009, the Obama administration inaugurated the Nationwide\nSuspicious Activity Reporting Initiative to train local law\nenforcement in a federal system of information sharing on\n\"suspicious activity\" related to violent extremism. In its first\nthree years, more than 200,000 officers received this training\nannounced a new strategy of community partnerships to pre-\nvent violent extremism in the United States, relying largely\non local agencies because \"The Federal Government will\noften be ill-suited to intervene in the niches of society where\nradicalization to violence takes place\" (White House\nMany local law enforcement agencies embraced the\ncounterterrorism mission, collaborating with researchers to\nestablish best practices for this work (International\nagencies used this mandate to experiment with community\nengagement (Schanzer et al. 2016; Weine et al. forthcom-\ning); others, most notably the New York Police Department\nunder Mayor Michael Bloomberg, went in the direction of\ncommunity surveillance (Apuzzo and Goldman 2013). This\ndifference in approaches suggests that local law enforce-\nment agencies may hold varied ideas about the severity of\nthreats from violent extremism, although this has not been\nstudied directly. This article examines to what extent ideol-\nogy may be associated with this variation.\n6 Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World \nMethods\nAs part of a survey on local law enforcement agencies' com-\nmunity outreach programs, we asked agencies to rate the\nlevel of threat from violent extremism in the United States in\nthe agency's jurisdiction:\nOn a scale from 1 to 5 (5 = Severe Threat, 1 = No Threat), please\nrate how severe your agency believes the threat of violent\nextremism is within your jurisdiction, for the following forms of\nextremism (check one box in each column):\nAl-Qaeda\u00adInspired Violent Other Violent Extremism\nExtremism\nThis survey was conducted in the first half of 2014, before the\nself-proclaimed Islamic State began to encourage violence in\nthe United States.At the time of the survey, al-Qaeda was seen\nas the dominant international terrorist network, and al-Qaeda\u00ad\ninspired violent extremism was an umbrella term that avoided\nthe derogatory connotations that were sometimes associated\nwith the phrase Islamic terrorism. The sampling frame was all\n480 state, county, and municipal law enforcement agencies\nwith more than 200 sworn officers, plus 63 additional county\nand municipal agencies with 200 or fewer sworn officers in\nselected jurisdictions that experienced an incident or prosecu-\ntion for violent extremism in recent years. The survey yielded\nresponses from 339 of the larger agencies (a 71 percent\nresponse rate) and 43 of the smaller agencies (a 68 percent\nresponse rate), for a total of 382 law enforcement agencies (a\ncounty agencies, and 206 municipal agencies, whose com-\nbined jurisdictions covered 86 percent of the U.S. population.\nThe survey was mailed to the commanding officer of the\nagency, with follow-up e-mails and telephone calls. The com-\nmanding officers themselves completed 49, or one-eighth, of\nthe surveys, generally in smaller agencies; the remainder were\ncompleted by officers selected by the commanding officer,\ngenerally individuals who directed or were involved in divi-\nsions investigating violent extremism.\nTo identify the ideological context in which these threat\nassessments were made, we merged the survey results with\ncity-, county-, and state-level estimates of ideology calculated\nby political scientists Chris Tausanovitch and Christopher\namericanideologyproject.com (Warshaw and Tausanovitch\n2015). This index, ranging from -1 (most liberal) to +1 (most\nconservative), draws on dozens of policy questions in seven\nlarge-scale surveys, aggregated through a multilevel regres-\nsion and poststratification (MRP) model. This variable was\nnot available for 18 small jurisdictions in the law enforcement\nTo measure the political attitudes of law enforcement\nagencies, we draw on data developed by Crowdpac.com, a\ntechnology company that has generated an index of political\nattitudes of law enforcement officers living in each state and\ncounty, based on publicly available data on campaign dona-\ntions. The index, ranging from -10 (most liberal) to +10\n(most conservative), is calculated through the campaigns and\norganizations that the recipients of the officers' campaign\ndonations have themselves contributed to as well as the can-\ndidates' statements and (for incumbent candidates) their vot-\ning record (Bonica 2014). Using the same method, Crowdpac\nhas also created an index of the average political attitude of\nthe entire population within each city, county, and state. City-\nlevel population attitudes are available at https://www.\ncrowdpac.com/games/lookup/hometown; county-level law\nenforcement attitudes are available at https://www.crowd-\npac.com/games/lookup/police; state-level law enforcement\nand population attitudes are available in Rohrlich (2015).\nCrowdpac was kind enough to provide additional data on\ncounty-level population attitudes for this project. These vari-\nables are imperfectly matched with one another: Law\nenforcement attitudes are available only at the county and\nstate levels, while population attitudes are available at the\ncity, county, and state levels. We have merged county-level\nlaw enforcement attitudes with city-level population atti-\ntudes, because many city police officers live outside of city\nboundaries (Silver 2014). From these variables, we gener-\nated a measure of the difference between law enforcement\nofficers' attitudes and population attitudes. Including this\nTo specify the number of incidents of violent extremism\noccurring within each agency's jurisdiction prior to the sur-\nvey in early 2014, we draw on the two most extensive data-\nbases of Muslim American extremism and right-wing\nextremism, respectively. The first is Kurzman (2017), which\nlists the name, location, and demographic characteristics of\n239 Muslim Americans involved with plots of violent\nthe law enforcement survey. The second data source is the\nlist of 4,420 right-wing violent extremist incidents between\nPerliger (2012); we thank Professor Perliger for sharing the\nlocation variable of each incident. Both data sets were aggre-\ngated to the level of city, county, and state and merged with\nthe survey results.\nThe two data sources on violent extremism adopt differ-\nent measurement approaches: The list of Muslim extremists\ncounts both incidents of violence and plots that were dis-\nrupted before they could engage in violence, which comprise\na large majority of the cases, while Perliger (2012) counts\nonly incidents of violence. Perliger includes hate crimes and\nideologically motivated property damage, while the list of\nMuslim extremists consists primarily of plots involving\nindiscriminate violence against persons. Despite these differ-\nent approaches, the two data sets allow us to compare juris-\ndictions with less or more violent extremism of each\nsort--that is, jurisdictions with less Muslim extremism as\nagainst those with more Muslim extremism and jurisdictions\nwith less right-wing extremism as against those with more\nright-wing extremism.\nKurzman et al. 7\nBoth measures of extremism involve count data that are\nhighly skewed and include many zero values: 73 percent of\nthe jurisdictions whose agencies participated in the survey\nhad experienced no cases of Muslim extremism since 9/11,\nand 46 percent of the jurisdictions had experienced no cases\nof right-wing violence. The inverse hyperbolic sine transfor-\nmation is designed to handle data of this form (Burbidge,\nMagee, and Robb 1988), although it is typically used for\ndependent variables; an alternative approach, adding a posi-\ntive number to the zero value cases and taking the natural\nlog, generated similar findings. (The pattern of significant\nand nonsignificant coefficients is the same for logged values\nWe also control for the population (logged) in each agen-\ncy's jurisdiction, drawn from the 2010 U.S. census (Social\nExplorer 2015), because larger populations may offer a greater\npool for recruitment by extremists. Models involving Muslim\nextremism also include the estimated number of Muslims as a\npercentage of total population in 2010 in each jurisdiction\n(Grammich et al. 2012). For the 83 jurisdictions whose Muslim\npopulation is not available in this data source, we set the figure\narbitrarily to .016 percent, which is the smallest value of the\nnon-missing data as well as the value of the 10th percentile.\nIdeology and Threat Assessment\nState and local law enforcement agencies were less likely to\nidentify Muslim extremism as a severe threat within their\njurisdictions than other forms of violent extremism (see\nFigure 2). Within the \"other\" category, the primary ideology\nidentified by these agencies was \"anti-government\" extrem-\nism, which was listed as one of the top three threats of violent\nextremism in 73.8 percent of the jurisdictions; this rate was\nalmost double the next most widely identified threat, Muslim\nextremism, which was listed as one of the top three in 39.3\npercent of the jurisdictions (Table 1).\nThis finding replicates threat assessments in two earlier\nof state agencies and 17 percent of local agencies reported\nthat right-wing terrorist groups were located in their juris-\ndiction; 38 percent and 3 percent, respectively, reported\nknowledge of \"religious groups using violence\" in their\n259 law enforcement officers ranked sovereign citizens as\nthe greatest potential threat (mean response of 3.20 on a\nscale of 1 [strongly disagree] to 4 [strongly agree]; Islamic\nextremists/jihadists were ranked second with a mean\nwith Islamic extremists/jihadists rated as a greater threat to\nstate security than right-wing groups (Freilich, Chermak,\nSwitching to multivariate regression with threat assess-\nment as the dependent variable (Table 2), we find that threat\nassessment of al-Qaeda\u00adinspired violent extremism is cor-\nrelated with the number of Muslim violent extremists in a\nFigure 2.

Logged\npopulation size is also correlated with threat assessment, as\nexpected, and the number of Muslims as a percent of the total\npopulation of the jurisdiction is correlated with threat assess-\nment of al-Qaeda\u00adinspired violent extremism.\nIntroducing ideology, however, has different effects on\nthreat assessment. For al-Qaeda\u00adinspired violent extremism\n(Model 2), political attitudes of the jurisdiction are a strong\npredictor of threat assessment, even stronger than the num-\nber of Muslim violent extremists, whose coefficient falls to\nmarginal statistical significance (p = .07). For other forms of\nviolent extremism (Model 5), political attitudes do not affect\nthreat assessment, which remains strongly correlated with\nthe number of right-wing violent incidents in the jurisdiction.\n(Another study has found evidence that conservative atti-\ntudes in a county are associated with the presence of far-right\nideological violence [Adamczyk et al. 2012], although we\nare unable to replicate this finding with our data.)\nThe law enforcement agencies in our survey reported\nlower levels of threat in conservative jurisdictions than in\nliberal jurisdictions. A shift of one point in the political ideol-\nogy scale (e.g., from the most liberal to the midpoint of the\nscale) is associated with a lower threat assessment of two-\nthirds of a point, on average, on a five-point scale.\nThis pattern holds in subsets of the sample as well, such\nas liberal jurisdictions only (political attitudes scale <0), con-\nservative jurisdictions only (political attitudes scale >0), and\nmiddle-of-the-road jurisdictions only (political attitudes\nscale between -0.5 and +0.5): More conservative jurisdic-\ntions, even within these subsamples, are associated with\nlower threat assessments for Muslim extremism, controlling\nfor the actual number of Muslim extremists, and are not sig-\nnificantly correlated with threat assessments for other\nextremisms, controlling for the actual number of right-wing\nincidents.\nThe pattern also holds with the percentage of votes cast\nfor Obama in 2012 and with an indicator of the party in\noffice. Agencies reporting to a Republican mayor, sheriff, or\ngovernor (or county board or executive for county agencies\nwith appointed sheriffs) were marginally more likely (p =\n.06) to rate threats from Muslim extremism lower than agen-\ncies led by Democrats and Independents, controlling for the\nactual number of Muslim extremists. Party affiliation did not\nmatter for the assessment of other forms of violent extrem-\nism. (A dummy variable for elected sheriffs was not signifi-\ncant for either form of threat.)\nThe pattern holds as well with a direct indicator of law\nenforcement officers' political attitudes, as calculated by\nCrowdpac from campaign donation data, although this indi-\ncator is not available for all of the jurisdictions surveyed for\nthis project. As shown in Table 2, threat assessment of\nMuslim extremism was associated with the difference\nbetween the political attitudes of law enforcement officers\nand the jurisdiction at large: Agencies where officers were\nmore conservative than the population they served rated the\nthreat of Muslim extremism higher than agencies where offi-\ncers were more liberal than the population (Model 3). The\ndifference between law enforcement attitudes and the popu-\nlation's attitudes was not significantly associated with the\nassessment of other forms of violent extremism (Model 6).\nThreat Assessment and Subsequent\nViolent Extremism\nLaw enforcement agencies' threat assessments may have\nbeen based in part on ongoing investigations of plots that had\nnot yet yielded arrests or otherwise come to public attention.\nThese cases would not have appeared in the data sets of vio-\nlent extremism.\nTo test whether this was the case, we counted Muslim\nAmericans associated with violent extremism in 2015, the\nyear following the survey (Kurzman 2016a). Cases were\nby online recruitment by the self-proclaimed \"Islamic State,\"\nalthough the pace of new cases dropped off sharply in the\ncases involved arrests of individuals attempting to join mili-\ntant groups overseas. No comprehensive list of right-wing\nviolent extremism was available for 2015, comparable to the\nPerliger (2012) data set for earlier years.\nThe number of Muslim American extremists in 2015 in\neach jurisdiction was strongly correlated with the number of\ncases in previous years as well as with logged population\n(Table 3, Model 1). The size of the Muslim population, net of\ntotal population, was not correlated with the number of cases\nin 2015--it was not correlated with the number of cases in\nprevious years either, although it was positively associated\nTable 1.

First, we note\nthat ideology mattered in the assessment of threats from\nMuslim extremism. Law enforcement agencies in liberal\nTable 2.

Agencies that were more\nconservative than the public they served rated threats from\nMuslim extremism more highly than agencies in which offi-\ncers were no more conservative than the jurisdiction at large.\nWe do not have evidence in these data sets to explain why this\nmight be so, but we do have evidence that this assessment was\ncorrelated more strongly with ideological factors than with the\nnumber of Muslim extremists in the jurisdiction.\nSecond, ideology did not matter in assessment of threats from\nother forms of violent extremism. These assessments were not\nthe inverse of the threat from Muslim extremism: They were not\nhigher in conservative areas than liberal areas. Instead, threat\nassessments hewed consistently to the number of incidents of\nright-wing violence in the jurisdiction. This is particularly nota-\nble because of the definitional mismatch between the indicator of\nviolence (right-wing violence only) and the threat assessment\ncategory of \"other violent extremism,\" which is not limited to\nright-wing extremism (although that was the most common form\nof extremism identified by the law enforcement agencies).\nDespite the statistical noise that we would expect from this mis-\nmatch, threat assessment in this \"other\" category was robustly\ncorrelated with the prevalence of right-wing violence.\nThird, the contrast between the two forms of extremism\noffers a telling comparison of the effect of ideology on\nthreat assessment. Ideology does not matter equally for all\nforms of threat assessment. In the context of increasing\npolarization of attitudes toward Muslims in America, ideo-\nlogical factors are associated with the perception of threat\nposed by Muslim extremists but not with perception of\nthreat posed by other extremists. This ideological context\noutweighs the effect of evidence of extremism by Muslims,\nbut it does not outweigh evidence of right-wing extremism.\nWe do not offer a theory of threat assessment, but we note\nthat these findings support the suggestion from the field of\ncritical terrorism studies that American responses to\nMuslim extremism are related more to ideological consid-\nerations than to the observable scale of the threat.\nFinally, law enforcement's threat assessment of al-Qaeda\u00ad\ninspired violent extremism did not predict the number of\nMuslims involved in violent extremism the following year,\ncontrolling for the number of cases in previous years. This\nfinding reinforces the impression that threat assessment\nregarding Muslim extremists may be detached from the actual\nlevel of threat, a \"moral panic\" in sociological terms. \"The\nUnited States is obsessed with terrorism, to an unhealthy and\nillogical degree,\" a recent analysis concluded. \"When politi-\ncians attempt to calm those fears, to put terrorism into per-\nspective, they are accused of ignoring danger, of coddling the\nenemy. Terrorists want attention; our hyper-sensitivity to their\nviolence feeds that need.\" This judgment came not from the\nfield of critical terrorism studies but from the former director\nof analysis at the National Counterterrorism Center and dep-\nuty director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center (Liepman\n"
