The authors used data from 2 repre-\nsentative epidemiologic studies of US adults aged 18 years or older, the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol\nand Related Conditions (NESARC; 2001\u00ad2002) and the National Comorbidity Survey\u00adReplication (NCS-R;\n2001\u00ad2003), to estimate the prevalence of obesity as a function of cannabis use. The adjusted prevalences of\nobesity in the NESARC and the NCS-R were 22.0% and 25.3%, respectively, among participants reporting no use\nof cannabis in the past 12 months and 14.3% and 17.2%, respectively, among participants reporting the use\nof cannabis at least 3 days per week. These differences were not accounted for by tobacco smoking status.\nAdditionally, after adjustment for sex and age, the use of cannabis was associated with body mass index differ-\nences in both samples. The authors conclude that the prevalence of obesity is lower in cannabis users than in\nnonusers.\nappetite; body mass index; body weight; cannabis; obesity\nAbbreviations: BMI, body mass index; NCS-R, National Comorbidity Survey\u00adReplication; NESARC, National Epidemiologic\nSurvey on Alcohol and Related Conditions.\nadults in the United States (1), contributing to 13% of total\nUS mortality (2). Clinical guidelines for obesity treatment\nrecommend lifestyle approaches, including the promotion\nof physical activity and a healthy diet (3). Pharmacologic\ntreatment may be appropriate to facilitate weight loss in pa-\ntients with a body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2)\ngreater than 30 or patients with a BMI greater than 27 in\nthe presence of coexisting conditions. Seven drugs are cur-\nrently approved for the treatment of obesity in the United\nStates. Their mechanisms of action are based on elevating\nmonoamine levels or lipase inhibition in the gastrointestinal\ntract.\nThe role of cannabis and endocannabinoids in appetite reg-\nulation has been extensively studied in the past 10 years (4).\nRimonabant, a selective antagonist/inverse agonist of the can-\nnabinoid CB1 receptor, was approved in more than 30 coun-\ntries for the treatment of obesity in 2006 but was withdrawn\nseveral years later because of safety concerns. Thereafter, the\ncommercial development of other cannabinoid CB1 receptor\nantagonists was stopped (5, 6). Based on the fact that canna-\nbis use increases appetite, clinical trials have suggested that\ncannabis derivatives may be a useful treatment for anorexia\nand weight loss associated with human immunodeficiency\nvirus infection (7, 8).\nTobacco use and smoking cessation have been associated\nwith weight loss (9) and weight gain (10), respectively. Al-\nthough some investigators have examined the relation between\ncannabis use and obesity in small samples, no large-scale study\nhas evaluated the association of cannabis use with weight\nin the general adult population. Therefore, we estimated\nthe prevalence of obesity as a function of cannabis use in\n2 representative national epidemiologic studies: the National\nEpidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions\n(NESARC) (11) and the National Comorbidity Survey\u00ad\nReplication (NCS-R) (12). We hypothesized that the prev-\nalence of obesity would be higher in cannabis users than in\nnonusers.\nData sources\nWe analyzed cross-sectional data on 2 population-based\nnationally representative samples, the NESARC participants\n(11) and the NCS-R participants (12). These studies have been\ndescribed extensively in previous reports (11\u00ad14). Both studies\ninvolved face-to-face surveys of US residents aged 18 years\nor older from the civilian, noninstitutionalized population.\nThe NESARC was a survey of 43,093 respondents (re-\nsponse rate \u00bc 81%) conducted by the National Institute on\nR was an independent survey of 9,282 respondents (response\nrate \u00bc 73.0%) conducted by the National Institute of Mental\nHealth (Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys)\nMeasures\nCurrent cannabis use. In the NESARC, the frequency of\ncannabis use in the preceding 12 months among users was\nassessed with the question, ``During the last 12 months, about\nhow often did you use marijuana?'' There were 7 possible\na month or less; and 7) no use in the past 12 months.\nIn the NCS-R, the frequency of cannabis use in the pre-\nceding 12 months among users was assessed with the ques-\ntion, ``On average, how often in the past 12 months have you\nused marijuana or hashish?'' There were 9 possible answers:\nper week; 4) several times per month (25\u00ad51 days per year);\nin the past 12 months.\nOn the basis of responses to these 2 similar questions, re-\nspondents were grouped into 4 categories of cannabis use to\nincrease consistency across the 2 studies: 1) no use in the\nlast 12 months; 2) at least once a year but less than once\na month; 3) from once a month or more to twice per week;\nand 4) from 3 days per week to every day.\nBMI and obesity. Data on self-reported height and weight\nwere available from 41,654 respondents in the NESARC and\nfrom 9,106 respondents in the NCS-R. BMI was calculated\nby dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in\nmeters. Participants were considered obese if their BMI was\nNCS-R). We used BMI as a continuous outcome for the linear\nregression analysis examining the relation between frequency\nof cannabis use and BMI. For all other analyses, we consid-\nered obesity as a categorical outcome (30 vs. <30).\nTobacco smoking. For both study samples, cigarette\nsmoking in the past 12 months was coded into 3 categories:\n1) current smoker, defined as someone who currently smoked\ncigarettes daily or occasionally; 2) ex-smoker, defined as\na tobacco nonuser who previously was a daily or occasional\nsmoker; and 3) never smoker, defined as a nonuser who had\nnever used any tobacco.\nOther measures. We also considered sociodemographic\ncharacteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, educational\nlevel, and marital status, as well as the use of other drugs\nin the past 12 months.\nIn both the NESARC and the NCS-R, age at interview\nyears. Marital status was classified as married/common-law\nmarried; widowed, divorced, or separated; or never married.\nEducational level was classified as less than high school,\nhigh school graduate, or some college or higher. Region of\nresidence was classified as Northeast, Midwest, South, or\nWest.\nCoding of race/ethnicity differed between the 2 samples.\nIn the NESARC, race/ethnicity was categorized as white,\nblack, Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/\nLatino, or American Indian/Alaska Native. In the NCS-R,\nrace/ethnicity was categorized as white, black, Asian, His-\npanic/Latino, or other (including American Indian/Pacific\nIslander).\nIn the NESARC, participants were asked whether they\nhad used sedatives, tranquilizers, opiates, heroin, amphet-\namine, cocaine/crack, hallucinogens, or an inhaler in the past\n12 months. In the NCS-R, participants were asked whether\nthey had used cocaine/crack or any other drug in the past\n12 months. In both samples, drug use in the past 12 months\nwas categorized as either no use of other drugs (except\ntobacco and alcohol) or use of other drugs.\nStatistical analyses\nWe first conducted univariate descriptive analyses for the\ncohorts' characteristics across the 4 groups defined according\nto the frequency of cannabis use in the past year (no use in the\nlast 12 months, at least once a year but less than once a month,\nat least once a month to twice per week, and 3 days per week\nto every day). We used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel v2\nstatistic to examine the statistical significance of differences\nobserved with categorical dependent variables. The thresh-\nold for statistical significance was P < 0.05. This analysis\nwas repeated including only the participants who had never\nsmoked tobacco.\nWe then fitted a logistic regression model with obesity as\na categorical outcome and the frequency of cannabis use in\nthe past year as the primary association of interest. We ad-\njusted for sex and age in our first model and for sex, age, race/\nethnicity, educational level, marital status, region of resi-\ndence, and smoking status in our second model. These co-\nvariates were chosen because they were associated with the\ndependent variable in the bivariate analysis. Goodness of fit\nwas determined by means of the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic.\nWe fitted a linear regression model with BMI as the outcome;\nuse of cannabis, as well as frequency of cannabis use in the\npast year, was the primary association of interest, adjusting\nfor sex and age.\nFor all analyses, data were weighted to reflect national\npopulation estimates. Results were analyzed using SUDAAN\nsoftware, version 10.01 (Research Triangle Institute, Research\nTriangle Park, North Carolina), to adjust for the complex\nsampling design.\nRESULTS\nin the NESARC and 7.3% of the participants in the NCS-R\nreported having used cannabis at least once in the past\n12 months (see Table 1 and Web Table 1 (http://aje.oxford-\njournals.org/)).

The same\nregression analysis in the NCS-R sample showed that when\ncontrolling for the confounding effects of sex and age, the\nodds ratio for obesity was significantly lower in the group of\nparticipants using cannabis ``more than once a year but less\nthan once a month'' than in those who had not used cannabis\nin the last 12 months.\nGiven that tobacco smoking affects weight, we conducted\nsupplementary analysis taking into account this effect. These\nanalyses did not affect the significance of the results (see Web\nAppendix). We also took pregnancy into account, without\nany effect on the results (Web Appendix).\nDISCUSSION\nThis cross-sectional analysis indicated that despite the\nevidence that cannabis use stimulates appetite in clinical\ntrials and laboratory studies, cannabis users are actually less\nlikely to be obese than nonusers in the general population.\nNumerous cross-sectional and prospective studies have\nexamined the association between BMI or obesity and the\nuse of several substances of abuse, including alcohol (15\u00ad18),\nclear (and negative) relation between the frequency of use of\na substance and body weight that has emerged so far has been\nfor tobacco.\nThree studies have specifically examined the relation\nfemales suggested that the rate of cannabis use in the last\n12 months is lower in obese subjects than in subjects with\na lower BMI (25). A second study showed that frequent\nuse of cannabis was associated with obesity in girls in a\nA third study showed that use of cannabis is associated with\na higher caloric intake but is not associated with a higher\nOur results should be interpreted in the context of several\nlimitations. Firstly, information on cannabis use, height, and\nweight was based on self-reports and was not confirmed by\ndirect measurement. Self-reports tend to underestimate BMI\n(28, 29) but are unlikely to influence conclusions about asso-\nciations, since they are unlikely to be related to cannabis use.\nFurthermore, the adjustments made for sociodemographic\ncharacteristics in our study further decreased the risk of mis-\nclassification (29, 30). Secondly, physical activity and diet\nare 2 major risk factors for obesity but were not taken into\naccount in this study. Despite these limitations, this analysis\nshowed that even if cannabis consumption increases appe-\ntite, people using cannabis are less likely to be obese than\npeople who do not use cannabis.\nTable 2.
