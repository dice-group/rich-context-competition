Significant LMCA disease,\nwhich is commonly defined as narrowing of\nthe luminal diameter of greater than 50%,\nis considered the highest risk coronary\nartery disease subtype and is associated\nwith a poorer prognosis than non-LMCA\ndisease.1 Before the era of drug-eluting\nstents (DESs), percutaneous interventions\ninvolving the LMCA were associated with\nconsiderable risks of acute complications\nand early mortality,2,3 as well as long-term\nrestenosis.4 Therefore, for the last several\ndecades, coronary artery bypass grafting\n(CABG) has been the standard revascular-\nization treatment for LMCA lesions.\nThe results of recent, randomized, con-\ntrolled, trials have shown that the perform-\nance of PCI with DESs has comparable\ncardiac adverse event rates with those of\nCABG in patients with LMCA disease,\nespecially in patients with less anatomically\ncomplex lesions.5\u00ad9 On the basis of these\nfavourable findings, the current guidelines\nrecommend performing PCI as an alterna-\ntive revascularization strategy for treatment\nof LMCA lesions with low or intermediate\nOne of the major issues associated with\nLMCA PCI procedures is the large reference\ndiameter of the left main stem. Several\nintravascular ultrasound (IVUS) studies\nhave shown that the maximal LMCA diam-\nmaximal diameter of most commercially\navailable DESs is 4.0 mm. Stent over-\nexpansion with larger post-dilation balloons\nmay be the only method of reducing the risk\nof incomplete stent apposition. The over-\nexpansion capacity of contemporary DES\nplatforms has been thoroughly investigated\nin several in vitro studies,14\u00ad16 while in vivo\ndata regarding this phenomenon are still\nlimited. Therefore, we aimed to determine\nthe efficacy and safety of over-expansion of\nthe current commercially available DESs\n(4.0 mm) in patients with LMCA disease.\nMaterials and methods\nThis was a single-centre, retrospective study.\nand June 2016 were retrospectively reviewed\nto identify the LM interventions that met the\nfollowing inclusion criteria: (1) interventions\nperformed on de novo LMCA lesions, (2)\ninterventions performed using DESs with a\nnominal diameter of 4.0 mm, (3) interven-\ntions involving post-dilation using non-\ncompliant balloons with a nominal diameter\nof no less than 4.5 mm, (4) and interventions\nin which IVUS measurements were per-\nformed before stent deployment and after\nthe final post-dilation. The following inter-\nventions were excluded from the study: (1)\ninterventions involving use of the two-stent\ntechnique for LM bifurcations and (2) inter-\nventions in which post-dilation was per-\nformed with the kissing balloon technique.\nThe appropriate institutional review board\napproved the study and informed consent\nwas obtained from each patient.\nIVUS measurement protocol\nAll IVUS images were independently\nreviewed and analysed by a skilled interven-\ntional cardiologist who was blinded to the\nnominal diameters and inflation pressure of\nthe post-dilation balloons. An Eagle Eye\u00d5\ncatheter (Volcano Europe BVBA, Brussels,\nBelgium) was used for pre- and post-\ninterventional IVUS measurements. A total\nof 100 mg of intracoronary nitroglycerin\nwas injected before each measurement.\nThe ultrasound images were recorded from\nthe left anterior descending or left circumflex\nartery to the left main ostium. A validated\ncomputer-based contour detection pro-\ngram allowed semi-automatic detection of\nthe lumen, stent, and vessel boundaries in\nlongitudinally reconstructed views of the\nregion of interest.\nIVUS data analysis\nQuantitative analysis was performed accord-\ning to the American College of Cardiology\nClinical Expert Consensus Document on\nStandards for Acquisition, Measurement\nand Reporting of Intravascular Ultrasound\nStudies.17 For the pre-interventional IVUS\nmeasurements, the left main lesion segment\nwith the smallest luminal cross-sectional area\nwas selected, and the following parameters\nwere measured: (1) minimal lumen diameter\n(mm), (2) minimal lumen area (mm2), and\n(3) plaque burden. For the post-interven-\ntional IVUS measurements, the left main in-\nstent segment with the largest in-stent area\nwas selected, and the following parameters\nwere measured: (1) maximal stent diameter\n(mm) and (2) maximal stent area (mm2).\nAdditionally, the left main in-stent segment\nwith the smallest in-stent area was selected\nfor measuring the minimum stent area\n(mm2). We used the maximal stent diam-\neter/area mainly because it is more likely to\nbe affected by the plaque burden and plaque\ncomponents than by stent over-expansion\ncapability. Calcification was measured in\ndegrees using the semi-quantitative grading\nmethod in the location of maximal stent area\nmeasurement.17 Calcification was divided\ninto two categories: (1) < 90, less than one\nquadrant; and (2) ! 90, no less than one\nquadrant.\nThe predicted stent diameter (mm) was\ncalculated using the balloon diameter and\ninflation pressure of the final post-dilation\nbased on the data provided by the manu-\nfacturers. The predicted stent area (mm2)\nwas defined as follows: p \u00c2 (predicted stent\ndiameter/2)2. The diameter expansion index\nwas defined as the ratio of the maximal stent\ndiameter to the predicted stent diameter\nafter post-dilation. The area expansion\nindex was defined as the ratio of the\nmaximal stent area to the predicted stent\narea after post-dilation.\nStatistical analyses\nCategorical variables are shown as numbers\n(percentages). Continuous data are shown\nas medians (interquartile ranges). Spearman\ncorrelation analysis was used to determine\nthe correlation between the maximal stent\ndiameter and predicted stent diameter, as\nwell as the correlation between the maximal/\nminimal stent area and predicted stent area.\nThe Mann\u00adWhitney U test and chi-square\ntest were used for intergroup comparison\nof continuous and categorical variables,\nrespectively. The multiple regression model\nwas used to further determine the potential\nfactors associated with stent expansion.\nStatistical analyses were performed with the\nSPSS statistical software package (version\n20.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and\nGraphPad Prism (version 5.0, GraphPad\nSoftware Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\nResults\nA total of 23 consecutive patients were\neligible for inclusion in this study. Most of\nthe patients were men and the median age of\nthe study population was 66 years. Acute\ncoronary syndrome was the major indica-\ntion for PCI (87.0%) and most of the lesions\nfeatured bifurcations (78.3%). The base-\nline and angiographic characteristics of the\nstudy population are summarized in Table 1.\nFour commercially available DESs with the\nlargest stent platform were analysed, including\nthe PROMUS ElementTM (N \u00bc 5), XIENCE\nXpeditionTM (N\u00bc 8), Resolute EndeavorTM\n(N \u00bc 7), and PartnerTM (N\u00bc 3) stents.\nThe designs of these four DESs are shown in\nAll of the included patients' IVUS images\nwere suitable for analysis.

The maximal\nstent diameter was linearly correlated\nwith the calculated stent diameter, with a\n(Figure 2). However, the area expansion\nwas also a linear correlation between the\nmaximal stent area and calculated stent area\n(Figure 2).

Our major finding was that\nover-expansion of DESs with post-dilation\n(4.5\u00ad5.0-mm post-dilation balloon) could\neffectively achieve the predicted stent diam-\neter. However, the predicted stent area\nachievement varied, which could have been\ndue to the presence of calcification.\nAn in vitro study showed that most of the\ncurrent DES platforms could be over-\nexpanded above their nominal diameters.14\nFor DESs with the largest design (4.0 mm),\na maximal stent diameter > 5.5 mm could be\nachieved using a 6.0-mm semi-compliant\nballoon at 14 atm.14 However, the in vivo\nbehaviour of these stents during the over-\nexpansion process may vary considerably.\nInteractions between stents and plaques/\narteries may cause recoil, deformation, and\nfracture of stents. Previous studies have\nshown that the magnitude of stent recoil\nreported in vivo is significantly greater than\nthat reported in bench testing. In an in vivo\nanimal study (Yorkshire pigs), Carrozza\net al.18 found that stent recoil can reach up\nto 30%, even after oversized post-dilation,\nin normal and compliant coronary arteries.\nBermejo et al.19 found that elastic recoil was\none of the major mechanisms responsible for\nresidual luminal stenosis in patients with\ncoronary artery disease. Additionally, in\ntheir study, the luminal dimensions after\nstenting were only 57% of the maximal\nachievable luminal dimensions after high-\npressure stent deployment, which was con-\nfirmed by subsequent studies.20,21 Therefore,\nunlike previous in vitro studies,14,16 our\nstudy provided direct in vivo evidence\nregarding over-expansion in patients with\nLMCA disease.\nNotably, one adverse event involving an\nacute severe stent fracture, which is a rare\ncomplication of stent deployment, occurred\nTable 3.

However, this design may jeopard-\nize the stability of the platform while the stent\nis over-expanded. Therefore, the number of\nconnectors in PROMOUS PremierTM stents\nhas been increased to five (4.0mm platform)\nin the proximal stent segment to enhance\nradial strength. Although the findings of the\ncurrent in vitro study showed that current\nDES platforms could be over-expanded to\nachieve a maximal stent diameter > 5.5 mm,14\nthe following two points must be taken into\nconsideration. The first point is regarding\nsample size. Only one stent for each platform\nis usually tested. The second point is regard-\ning stent-plaque interactions. Plaque distri-\nbution and components can lead to variations\nin radial force in different parts of the stent\nduring over-expansion. Moreover, significant\ncrown deformation has been observed in\nmost of the platforms when a maximal stent\ndiameter >5.5 mm was achieved in vitro.14\nFigure 3. A case of acute stent fracture during the process of over-expansion.\n(a) Image acquired immediately after stent deployment (PROMUS Element 4.0 mm \u00c2 16 mm); (b) post-dilation\nwith a Quantum 5.0-mm \u00c2 8-mm stent at 16 atm; (c) distal portion of a fractured stent; (d) IVUS shows that\nthe stent had fractured and that the struts had fallen into the lumen.\nTherefore, DES over-expansion in vivo\nshould be applied with caution, especially\nwhen using stents with a predicted diameter\nThe long-term outcome of DES over-\nexpansion in this population is still\nunknown. Kuriyama et al.22 reported that\nbare metal stent over-dilation resulted in a\nlarger intimal-luminal dimension\nand provided a larger follow-up lumen.\nUnfortunately, follow-up IVUS data were\nnot available in our study. Therefore, we\nwere unable to assess the effect of over-\nexpansion on intimal hyperplasia.\nOur study has several limitations. First,\nbecause of the small sample size of the study,\nit may have been underpowered for detecting\nother potential differences between two\ngroups. Second, as we mentioned above,\nfollow-up IVUS results were not available\nfor the patients who were included in this\nstudy. Third, we could not assess the effect of\nover-expansion on other DES parameters,\nsuch as drug coating and delivery. Finally,\ndifferent stent types, and differences in lesion\nlocation and preparation may also have\naffected the final results of stent expansion.\nConclusion\nThe findings of our in vivo study indicate\nthat DESs with a nominal diameter of\n4.0 mm can be over-expanded in patients\nwith LMCA disease. Achievement of the\npredicted stent area can be affected by the\npercentage of calcification. Stent fracture is\na potential complication of over-expansion\nof stents in vivo.\n"
