In AAA, the bond between humans\nand animals is used as an integral part of a patient's treat-\nment. AAA in health care involves a variety of species like\ndogs, cats, horses, and domesticated birds. Despite their\nincreasing application in a wide range of therapeutic ser-\nvices, the empirical evidence base ofAAAs is limited (Beetz,\nUvnas-Moberg, Julius, & Kotrschal, 2012; Munoz Lasa\net al., 2015). There are only few randomized studies which\nhave investigated the effect of AAA, as listed in Table 1\nHeinz, Lang, & Rapp, 2013; Menna, Santaniello, Gerardi, Di\net al., 2015; Wohlfarth, Mutschler, Beetz, Kreuser, &\nKorsten-Reck, 2013). Most of these studies were carried out\nin patients with psychiatric disorders.\nHowever, patients with cardiovascular disorders may also\nbenefit from AAA. AAA use in cardiovascular disease has\nbeen previously reported only from hospitalized patients. In\none study of patients with advanced heart failure, a 12-min\nhospital visit with a therapy dog improved hemodynamic\nparameters, neurohormone levels, and anxiety (Cole et al.,\nambulation was a safe and effective adjunct to an early\nambulation program for hospitalized heart failure patients\n(Abate, Zucconi, & Boxer, 2011). It is unknown, however,\nwhether these beneficial effects persist during a long-term\nfollow-up period after hospital discharge.\nIt has been observed that physiological variables such as\ncardiac autonomic activity change during short-term interac-\ntions with animals and are positively influenced by pet-\n1Krankenanstalt Rudolfstiftung, Vienna, Austria\n2University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria\n3Vienna Institute of Demography of the Austrian Academy of Sciences,\nAustria\nCorresponding Author:\nClaudia St\u00f6llberger, Krankenanstalt Rudolfstiftung, Steingasse 31/18,\nA-1030 Wien, \u00d6sterreich, Vienna, Austria.\nEmail: claudia.stoellberger@chello.at\nFeasibility of Home-Use Animal-Assisted\nActivities in Patients With Implanted\nCardiac Electronic Devices: A Pilot Study\nPeter Jirak1, Daniel Gerger1, Lisa M.

Parameters of cardiac autonomic activity are also regis-\ntered by modern implanted electronic devices (IED) like pace-\nmakers or cardiac defibrillators and can be measured by device\ninterrogation. Potential benefits of AAA on cardiac autonomic\nactivity could be ideally studied in patients with IED.\nSo far, AAA has been carried out mainly in institutions,\nsuch as nursing homes; rehabilitation units; psychiatric, sur-\ngical, or orthopedic departments of hospitals; or prisons\nAAA are unusual in Europe; however, they are an offered ser-\nvice in the United States for homebound patients and are\nappreciated by patients who are too sick to leave their homes\nby themselves (Harris et al., 1993). It is unknown if ambula-\ntory outpatients with cardiovascular disorders would be inter-\nested to be visited by AAA-teams in their homes. The aim of\nthis prospective pilot study was to assess the willingness of\npatients with IEDs to participate in AAA home sessions.\nMethod\nThe study is a prospective, single arm, observational study.\nSubjects included were consecutive outpatients with IEDs\nwho were scheduled for an appointment in the outpatient\nclinic for control of their IED between November 2012 and\ncommunity hospital in the center of a large city.\nStep 1: In the waiting area of the outpatient clinic, pam-\nphlets were displayed about AAA aimed to inform the\npatients.\nStep 2: The study physician (P.J. or D.G.) approached the\npatient in the waiting area, introduced himself as study\nphysician and informed the patient about AAA referring\nto the pamphlet.\nStep 3: If the patient showed interest, the patient was\ninterviewed by the study physician about current and pre-\nvious pet-ownership according to a preset questionnaire.\nThe subjects were offered AAA free of any charge. They\ncould choose being visited at home or to meet with the\ntherapy team in the outpatient clinic and between a dog\nand a cat as therapy animals. The potential health benefits\nof regular AAA-visits over the course of the study were\nidentified. Finally, patients were asked whether they were\ninterested in visits ofAAA-teams, and those who were not\ninterested were asked to explain precisely why.\nStep 4: In case they were interested, physicians explained\nto them the study procedures, the opportunities, aims,\nand potential benefits. The patients had to fill in a ques-\ntionnaire about their former experiences with animals.\nIn addition, the following demographic and clinical data\nwere documented: age, gender, type of IED, and current\nand previous pet-ownership. All these recruitments were\nTable 1.

The cardiologist responsible\nfor the clinical examination and check-up of each\npatient's IED was not involved in the study. This person\nwas informed of the activity of the study physician in the\nwaiting area, but did not interfere with or influence\npatients' decisions regarding their possible participation\nin AAA.\nStep 5: After initial contact, the patients were approached\nby telephone within 1 week by a certified AAA-team to\narrange an appointment. Informal records, without the use\nof a specific pro forma, were made of patients' reactions\nto the telephone call.\nThe AAA-teams considered the following activities\nwhich they typically carry out according to the preferences\nof the patients: encouraging patients to pet the dog, brush the\ncoat, throw a ball, give treats, let the dog perform some feats,\nor talk about the patient's experience with pets. As the pur-\npose of the pilot study was to determine feasibility of the\nAAA home visits, the activities during the AAA-visits were\nnot specifically planned in advance, and no preset protocol\nforms for documentation of the activities was developed.\nThe agreed procedure included writing an informal report\nabout each visit. If a current pet-owner expressed an interest\nin an AAA visit, the procedure included the plan of an indi-\nvidual approach by theAAA-team to avoid conflicts between\nthe visiting therapy animal and the resident pet.\nThe AAA-teams consisted of specially trained and certi-\nfied therapy dogs and their handlers, being members of the\norganization \"Tiere als Therapie\" (Animals for Therapy), an\nESAAT (European Society for Animal-Assisted Therapy)\nmember association with high quality standards and long\nexperience in AAA (http://www.en.esaat.org/). The require-\nments for the therapy animals of this organization are as fol-\nlows: excellent health status with a health certificate renewed\nevery year by a veterinarian, free of any pain, good-tempered\ncharacter, free of any parasites and precautions against para-\nsites, and completely vaccinated. Furthermore, therapy ani-\nmals are trained using positive reinforcement techniques to\nbe stress-resistant and relaxed with regard to contact with\nnew situations, children, and other animals and stress-resis-\ntant with regard to unknown sounds, movements, and optical\nstimuli. An annual evaluation of the therapy animal's behav-\nior and the AAA-team performance is carried out to ensure\nbest working practice.\nFor statistical analysis, differences among categories\nwere tested by applying Fisher's test for categorical vari-\nables and by t test for continuous variables. The analysis\nwas conducted by the statistical software R (R Core Team,\nThe study was ethically approved by the institutional\nreview board of the Wiener Krankenanstaltenverbund in\nVienna, and oral informed consent was obtained from all\nincluded patients for the interview in the waiting area.\nResults\nStep 1: Overall, 120 patients were asked to participate in\nthe interview in the waiting area.\nStep 2: Twenty of these 120 patients declined the inter-\nview because of the following reasons: no interest in the\ninterview (n = 8), language barriers (n = 7), and hardness\nof hearing (n = 5).\nStep 3: The remaining 100 patients were interviewed;\nhowever, 25 of them were excluded because they had no\nanalysis. Fifteen patients had antibradycardic pacemakers\n(PM), 44 had implanted cardioverter defibrillators (ICD),\n14 had an ICD combined with a cardiac resynchronization\ndevice (CRT-D), and two patients had a PM combined\nwith an ICD. All 75 patients were ambulatory, none of\nthem were wheelchair-bond or in need for assistance to\nattend the outpatient clinic.\nSix of the 75 patients did not provide information about\nprevious or current pet-ownership. From the remaining 69\npatients, the following information about pet-ownership was\nprovided: Sixteen of the patients (23%) were current pet-\nowners (dog: n = 6, cat: n = 4, dog and cat: n = 4, hamster:\nn = 1, bees: n = 1). The mean age of the 16 current pet-owners\nwas lower than that of the 53 current non-pet-owners (63.5\n33 patients reported previous pet-ownership (dog: n = 19,\ncat: n = 7, dog and cat: n = 5, hamster: n = 2). The clinical\ncharacteristics of the 49 former and current pet-owners did\nnot differ from the 20 patients who were never pet-owners,\nas listed in Table 2.\nStep 4: Twelve of the included 75 patients (16%) were\ninitially interested in receiving AAA during home visits.\nNone of the patients were interested in meeting with the\nAAA-team in the outpatient clinic. Ten of these 12 were\nprevious pet-owners and only two had never had a pet\n(p = .0553). Their clinical characteristics were not differ-\nent from those of the 63 patients who were not interested\nin AAA. The following reasons were given by the 63\npatients who were not interested in AAA: no interest at all\n(n = 19), too busy (n = 13), current pet-ownership (n = 11),\nliving outside of Vienna (n = 6), aversion to animals (n = 3),\nno trust inAAA(n = 4), language problems (n = 3), refusal\nto speak (n = 2), scheduled surgery (n = 1), and mental\nillness (n = 1).\nStep 5: Of the 12 patients who were initially interested,\nonly two agreed to a visit of an AAA-team in their homes.\nThe AAA-teams reported that during the visits, both\npatients were engaged. One patient was not interested in\nAAA but was happy to have someone to talk to. He did\nnot show any interest in the dog and considered himself\ninappropriate for AAA. Therefore, no further visits were\n4 SAGE Open\ncarried out. The second patient, a previous dog owner,\nwas interested in the dog, enjoyed, and was engaged in the\nvisit but still did not want a continuation of the visits\nbecause he did not expect any benefit for his situation.\nThe remaining 10 patients, who were initially interested,\nrefused a visit due to the following reasons: one patient's\nwife was hospitalized, therefore, AAA would have been too\nmuch stress for him. Another had too many appointments\nand no time for AAA, while a further patient was afraid that\nthe dog could harm her dialysis shunt. One patient from the\ngroup felt too healthy for any therapy, two had lost interest in\nAAA, and one was hospitalized and subsequently died. Two\npatients could not be contacted by telephone, and one could\nnot remember that he had claimed interest in AAA.\nOverall, the results of this pilot study showed that 23% of\npatients with IEDs were current pet-owners, 48% previous\npet-owners, and 29% have never owned a pet. Pet-owners\nwith IEDs were younger than non-pet-owners. Only 16% of\npatients with IEDs expressed an interest in visits of AAA-\nteams in homes, while only two patients agreed to a visit.\nWhile only two patients (2.6%) were visited, both patients\ndeclined continuation of AAA. Thus, it seems that AAA-\nvisits in their homes were not valued by patients with IEDs,\nalthough a high proportion of them were previous or current\npet-owners.\nDiscussion\nThe low rate of interest forAAAmay be due to the fact that the\nincluded patients considered themselves as relatively healthy,\nthus avoiding any additional contact with the hospital. This\nassumption is substantiated by the finding that none of the\npatients wanted AAA-team visits in the outpatient clinic.\nSurprisingly, although 12 patients were interested in and\nconsented to home visits, in only two cases were visits actu-\nally completed. It is possible that patients were fearful of\njeopardizing their care by saying no, even if the physician\nwas not objectively coercive in any way and the physician,\nwho explained the study, was not the care provider. A further\nfactor may be the lack of a specific protocol or script for the\ntelephone call making the visit appointment. It is therefore\nnot possible to be sure that each patient received exactly the\nsame information over the phone.\nIt remains unclear if outpatients with cardiovascular dis-\norders are willing to accept visits of AAA-teams in their\nhomes. The results of our pilot study suggest a low rate of\nacceptance due to various reasons, mainly because the\npatients consider themselves as too busy or healthy, or are\nnot interested in AAA. As home settings differ from institu-\ntions in patients' degree of control, privacy, and how time is\nspent, patients' estimation of AAA might differ between\nthese settings (Harris et al., 1993). Patients may prefer not to\nhave \"guest pets\" in their homes.\nBased on these experiences with this subset of outpatients\nwith IEDs, it has to be investigated whether AAA in another\nsetting, outside the patients' homes, would be more accepted\nor whetherAAA-team visits in patients'homes with advanced\nstages of heart failure would be an option. For further studies\nconcerning AAA in patients with cardiovascular diseases, we\nsuggest focusing on institutions like rehabilitation centers or\nday care centers. Furthermore, the monitoring function of\nIEDs could be used to assess the influence of animal\u00adhuman\ninteraction on parameters of cardiac autonomic activity in\ninterested patients, pet-owners as well as non-pet-owners,\nwith IEDs. Care has to be taken to define a protocol for infor-\nmation transmitted by phone between AAA-teams and\npatients to avoid misunderstandings.\nLimitations of the study are the low number of patients\nand the absence of any assessment of psychiatric comorbidi-\nties like depression or anxiety, which could have had an\nimpact on the very low interest in AAA. Furthermore,\ndegrees of sickness and functional disability were not\nassessed. Information on the ethnic and religious background\nof the patients was not gathered, meaning that any possible\nrelationships between these factors and interest in AAA\ncould not be assessed.\nOur findings suggest that the previously reported benefits\nof AAA in ambulatory outpatients with cardiovascular disor-\nders may not be feasible to investigate during home visits of\noutpatients with IEDs by AAA-teams. More studies with\npatients across the range of cardiac illness severity are needed.\nTable 2.
