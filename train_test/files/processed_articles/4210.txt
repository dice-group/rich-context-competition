U.S. adults are becoming more\nsupportive of same-sex marriage, and there are a number of\nreasons for this increase. In the 1988 General Social Survey\n(GSS), only 12.5% of theAmerican public agreed or strongly\nagreed that same-sex marriages are acceptable (Smith,\nAmerican public supported same-sex marriage (Pew\nResearch Center, 2013). Today, public opinion polls show\nthat half or more of the public support same-sex marriage\nSmith et al., 2015). These polls also show that support for\nsame-sex marriage has increased across all birth cohorts/age\ngroups over the last decade (e.g., Smith et al., 2015). Another\nindicator of the change in cultural outlooks is the number of\nstates that now recognize same-sex marriage as legal.\nCurrently, 14 states have not legalized same-sex marriage.\nHowever, that number is about to change as the U.S. Supreme\nCourt ruled that same-sex couples have a right to marry any-\nwhere in the United States.\nAlthough the ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court may sug-\ngest that research which examines support for same-sex mar-\nriages is now moot, there are strong reasons to advocate\nadditional research on this volatile and timely social issue.\nWith the exception of legal abortion, few social issues have\nbeen more divisive and garnished more media attention than\nsame-sex marriage. In addition, there are several issues such\nas workplace rights and family law which will likely emerge\namong gay-rights advocates and become a lightning rod for\nsocial debate and political decision making. For example,\nprivate- and religious-based schools may lose their tax-\nexempt status should they refuse to alter their policies against\nsame-sex marriage. Moreover, the judicial decision reached\nby the Supreme Court will surface in public debates among\npolitical candidates at the state and federal levels. Hence,\nexplicating the variables that influence attitudes regarding\nsame-sex marriage remains an important topic for social sci-\nence research.\nOur research focuses on differences in attitudes toward\nsame-sex marriage as they are shaped by religiosity and spir-\nituality across birth cohorts. The impact of religion on issues\nrelated to sexuality and family needs little documentation\n(e.g., Sherkat & Ellison, 1999), while the interest in spiritual-\nity is a more recent topic among scholars (Hill et al., 2000).\nReligiosity refers to an individual's level of emersion within\na religious community--often defined by the liturgical doc-\ntrines of the denomination. Spirituality connotes an outlook\n1University of Central Florida, Orlando, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nDavid A.

We elect to examine attitudinal variations by\nbirth cohorts because they have been shown to be important\npredictors for attitudinal outlooks regarding sexuality and\nfew studies examined the religious, spiritual, and secular\ncorrelates of public attitudes toward same-sex marriage\n(Sherkat, Powell-Williams, Maddox, & de Vries, 2011). The\nGSS included the question about same-sex marriage in 1988\nand has in every survey since 2004. In the last decade, other\nnational probability surveys such as the Pew Research Center\nGSS years because they include items that tap religiosity,\nspirituality, and attitudes toward same-sex marriage and\nafford the opportunity to examine differences across younger\nand older birth cohorts. Although it would be highly useful to\nexamine the role of religiosity and spiritualism as they affect\nthe mundane experiences of individuals who must interpret\nand incorporate these values into their daily lives (Walls,\nWoodford, & Levy, 2014), our research relies on survey data\nthat cannot tap into this aspect pertaining to same-sex mar-\nriages. However, our analysis does point to an important\ncomponent of the cultural resources that establishes the basis\nfor an individual's syncretism (Woodford, Walls, & Levy,\nThe trends in attitudinal change are not evenly distrib-\nuted across birth cohort/generation, religious identification,\nreligious participation, belief, or subjective spirituality.\nRecent research (Jones, Cox, & Navarro-Rivera, 2014;\nTaylor, 2014) shows significant differences in outlooks by\ncohort over the last decade. Current research identifies four\ncohorts for comparisons of social attitudes and behaviors:\n(a) the Millennial cohort, (b) Generation X, (c) the Baby\nBoom cohort, and (d) the Silent Generation (e.g., Bengtson,\nMillennial cohort as people who were born between 1981\nand 1996, Generation X as those who were born between\nwho were born before 1945. We follow this operationaliza-\ntion for our cohort comparisons of attitudes toward same-\nsex marriage.\nThe purpose of our study is to examine cohort compari-\nsons of religiosity and subjective spirituality on attitudes\ntoward same-sex marriage in three ways. First, we examine\nmean differences in attitudes among the four cohorts in the\nanalysis with and without controls. Second, we regress atti-\ntudes toward same-sex marriage on birth cohort, religiosity,\nspirituality, and control variables for the entire sample. Third,\nwe run separate regression analyses to assess the relationship\nbetween religion and spirituality on attitudes toward same-\nsex marriage within each cohort controlling for sociodemo-\ngraphic variables.\nReligiosity, Spirituality, and Same-Sex\nMarriage\nReligious intensity and commitment can be manifested in a\nnumber of ways. Religiosity involves a number of elements\nor facets of one's life, and there are multiple aspects as to\nwhat the term or concept conveys (see Ellison, Gay, & Glass,\nrelationship between religiosity and social attitudes and\nbehaviors has a long history in social science research.\nRecent research demonstrates that various aspects of religi-\nosity impact attitudes toward same-sex marriage (Jones\n2011). Personal identity with a religious tradition, denomina-\ntion, or family of denominations reinforces personal out-\nlooks of what is viewed as acceptable or unacceptable\nbehavior. Van Geest (2007) suggests that conservative evan-\ngelical Protestants are more likely to see same-sex marriage\nas a moral issue that runs counter to their value systems.\nMainline Protestants are much more in favor of gay rights\n(Van Geest, 2008). Some research indicates attitudes of\nCatholics appear to be becoming more in line with mainline\nProtestants (Sherkat, de Vries, & Creek, 2010), even though\nothers (e.g., Olson et al., 2006) find differences. Hence, iden-\ntity with a religious tradition likely affects attitudes toward\nsame-sex marriage and may vary by birth cohort. Steensland\net al. (2000) is currently the most widely used religious cat-\negorical scheme and is the operationalization for affiliation\nin the present study. Public religious participation through\nattendance at religious services reinforces these views.\nAttendance at religious services promotes a social network\nof individuals who are likely to share particular outlooks.\nBelief in the literal interpretation of sacred writings and sub-\njective practices such as prayer are also important compo-\nnents of religiosity. Recent research reports a significant\nrelationship between the subjective components of religios-\nity and attitudes toward same-sex relations (e.g., Barringer,\nGay, & Lynxwiler, 2013; Ford, Brignall, VanValey, &\nIn addition, subjective spirituality can be an alternative to\nreligious influences on attitudes and behaviors. Even though\nsocial scientists have addressed subjective spirituality in the\ncohort and religion literature (e.g., Roof & McKinney, 1987;\nWuthnow, 2007), little research has examined the relation-\nship between subjective spiritual views and attitudes toward\nsexuality and same-sex marriage. This study operationalizes\nspirituality as spiritual but not religious (SBNR). Research\nconsistently recognizes a relationship between spirituality\nHowever, a significant percentage of the population concep-\ntualizes spirituality as separate from religiosity and that is the\noperationalization for the current analysis. Recent research is\nbeginning to examine the impact of SBNR identity on atti-\ntudes toward same-sex sexuality (e.g., Barringer et al., 2013).\nOur research extends this line of inquiry by addressing the\nGay et al. 3\npossible influence of SBNR on attitudes toward same-sex\nmarriage and whether the influence varies by birth cohort.\nReligious Affiliation\nRecent research documents substantial religious denomina-\ntional differences in attitudes toward same-sex sexuality\nLoftus, 2001) and same-sex marriage (Burdette, Ellison, &\nidentity with a religious group is likely important in attitude\nformation. For some time, research has assumed that reli-\ngious denominations are the \"locus of subcultural differ-\nterm subculture carries varied connotations, it usually refers\nto norms and practices that are shared by members of the\ngroup that are distinct from the larger population. Hence,\nattitudes toward same-sex sexuality and same-sex marriage\nare likely to vary by religious affiliation and its correspond-\ning ideology. Recent research addresses the role denomina-\ntion or religious tradition plays in influencing attitudes and\nbehaviors concerning the morality of same-sex sexuality\nthat evangelical and sectarian religious traditions are the\nleast tolerant of same-sex relations. A major question in the\nliterature continues to be how we categorize religious affilia-\nSteensland et al., 2000). Currently, the most widely used reli-\ngious categorical scheme is the one developed by Steensland\net al. (2000), and it is the scheme used in the present study.\nThe Steensland et al.'s typology of religious traditions is\noperationalized as Catholic, Jewish, mainline Protestant,\nevangelical Protestant, African American Protestant, \"Other\"\naffiliates, and unaffiliated/no religious preference. An impor-\ntant aspect of this study is the variation of the religious tradi-\ntion effect by cohort. Unfortunately, due to sample size issues\nfor certain religious groups in our society (e.g., members of\nthe Jewish faith, Mormon respondents, Muslims), our analy-\nsis is restricted to the largest religious traditions in the\nGSS data. They are Catholics, mainline Protestants, evan-\ngelical Protestants, African American Protestants, and no\nreligious preference respondents. Hence, the study focuses\non Protestants, Catholics, and no preference respondents.\nPublic Religious Participation\nIndividuals who participate in public religious activities are\nmore likely to incorporate the ideas expressed in the larger\ngroup. Attendance at religious services is the structured\nactivity that affords the most available route to public par-\nticipation. Attendance exposes the individual to norms\nand practices of the group and reinforces attitudes\nand behaviors associated with a particular religious\nSherkat et al., 2011). Evangelical religious traditions are\nthe most likely to be intolerant of same-sex relations (Gay\nWoodford et al., 2012) while the more mainline Protestant\ndenominations have been more supportive of same-sex\nthough attendance at religious services or public partici-\npation may reinforce the variations in attitudes by reli-\ngious tradition, the bulk of the literature reports that\nattendance overall reduces the support for same-sex mar-\nriage (Becker, 2012; Cochran, Chamlin, Beeghley, &\nFenwick, 2004). Extending this line of inquiry, we exam-\nine the relationship between attendance at religious ser-\nvices and attitudes toward same-sex marriage for each of\nthe four cohorts.\nBiblical Literalism and Prayer\nTwo subjective aspects of religiosity are beliefs and prayer.\nOne of the most important aspects of the relationship between\nreligious belief and attitudes toward same-sex marriage in\nthe United States is a belief in the literal interpretation of the\nBible. For this study, the Bible is the primary sacred text for\nthe traditions in American mainline religion. Biblical literal-\nism is the belief that the words in the Bible were inspired by\nGod and are to be interpreted literally. This interpretation of\nthe Bible is most commonly found among evangelical\ndenominations of Christianity, although it is not exclusive to\nthem (Burn & Busso, 2005). Even though research reports\nsubstantial heterogeneity within religious denominations,\nevangelical and sectarian Protestant groups are much more\nlikely to interpret same-sex sexuality as morally wrong\nPrayer is also a significant component of subjective religi-\nosity as individual religious behavior. Roof and McKinney\n(1987) refer to individualistic phenomena as the \"new volun-\ntarism\" that leads to enhanced privatization of faith that is\nmore anchored in personal realms. Using the 2014 GSS, a\nsimple cross tabulation of frequency of attendance and fre-\nquency of prayer shows that roughly 30% of respondents\nwho never attend religious services pray at least once a day.\nAs Wuthnow (2007) points out, \"prayer is fairly common\namong the American public\" (p. 128). Americans pray for all\nkinds of reasons both internal and external, contrition and\nthanksgiving, and personal and collective. Sociological\nresearch uses frequency of prayer as an independent variable\n(Ellison, Bradshaw, Flannelly, & Galek, 2014) and a depen-\ndent variable (Baker, 2008). And some religious profession-\nals encourage the use of prayer to search for a \"life partner\"\nunder certain circumstances. Finally, recent research\n(Barringer et al., 2013) shows that the frequency of prayer is\nrelated to attitudes toward same-sex relations. Hence, prayer\nis included in our analysis of attitudes toward same-sex\nmarriage.\n4 SAGE Open\nSubjective Spirituality\nSubjective spirituality may have a different and more subtle\neffect on attitudes toward same-sex marriage. It is a more\ndifficult concept to measure than religiosity and is influenced\nby a variety of personal and societal factors (Ammerman,\n2013). Spirituality is not necessarily institutionally grounded\nand is subject to individual interpretations. It is more per-\ntently show that the majority of Americans report that they\nare both spiritual and religious (Marler & Hardaway, 2002),\nsified as SBNR. Heelas and Woodhead (2005) suggest that\nAmericans are increasingly using spirituality as a guide for\nunderstanding in their everyday lives.\nIt is beyond the scope of this article to provide a definition\nof \"spirituality.\" The GSS does not ask respondents what\nspirituality means to them. Some social scientists suggest\nthat religion and spirituality are distinct concepts (Schlehofer,\nOmoto, & Adelman, 2008). Even though research clearly\nshows that the two are not mutually exclusive (Marler &\nHardaway, 2002), a number of surveys (e.g., GSS) demon-\nstrate that a significant percentage of respondents report that\nthey are spiritual in one question but not religious in another.\nWhile we may not know their subjective definitions, we do\nknow that the combination of the questions indicate that they\nfeel they are spiritual, but they do not feel they are religious.\nRecent research reports that these SBNR attitudes are related\nto favorable outlooks toward same-sex sexuality (Barringer\net al., 2013). This may very well extend to attitudes toward\nsame-sex marriage. Those who are SBNR are less likely to\nattend religious services or identify with a particular denomi-\nnation, and hence less likely to be influenced by a particular\nreligious organization's stance on same-sex relations. Recent\nresearch shows that respondents identifying as SBNR varies\nacross birth cohorts (Gay & Lynxwiler, 2013).\nCohort, Religiosity, Spirituality, and Attitudes\nToward Same-Sex Marriage\nAs noted earlier, we are interested in the relationship between\ncohort, religiosity, spirituality, and attitudes toward same-sex\nmarriage. Ryder (1965) is most frequently cited as the\nresearcher to emphasize cohort in the study of changes in\nattitudes and behavior. Since this seminal work 50 years ago,\ncohort comparisons have been used to examine a wide range\nof attitudes and behaviors. Many of these studies use an Age/\nPeriod/Cohort design. However, this study is limited to\ncohort comparisons at one point in time because the data are\ncross-sectional and some questions of interest are only asked\nin certain years. Nevertheless, we can identify different birth\ncohorts even though they are at different ages in 2012 and\n2014. As noted earlier, support for same-sex marriage has\nincreased for all birth cohorts (Pew Research Center, 2015;\nSmith et al., 2015). Whether or not attitudes change over the\nlife course is not our research question. Moreover, the issue\nof same-sex marriage was not part of public discussion sev-\neral years ago. Why emphasize cohort when only cross-sec-\ntional data are available? Birth cohorts were socialized in\ndifferent time periods and cultural epochs depending on the\ntime they were born. Baby Boomers experienced different\nreligious, cultural, and institutional aspects of society than\nthe Millennials. Generation X lived through different experi-\nences than the Silent Generation and so on. As a result, the\ndeterminants of attitudes may vary across birth cohort\nregardless of their current age. Therefore, we are interested\nin more than simple age effects. Other researchers have also\nexamined cohort effects using GSS data (e.g., Sherkat et al.,\nby examining the potential differential effects of religiosity\nand spirituality on attitudes toward same-sex marriage by\ncohort.\nWe follow the operationalization of birth cohorts used in\ncurrent social scientific studies (Jones et al., 2014; Pew\nthat younger birth cohorts (i.e., the Millennials and\nGeneration X) are more accepting of same-sex marriage than\ntheir older cohort counterparts. But it is more than just a sim-\nple younger versus older distinction. Each of these polls\nshows that support for same-sex marriage across cohorts is a\nconsistent, albeit unsurprising, pattern. The Millennials show\nthe highest level of support followed in order by Generation\nX, the Baby Boomers, and the Silent Generation. While this\ncould be an age effect, it may also reflect a cohort effect. This\nfinding in and of itself does not tell us anything new.\nHowever, little research has compared the determinants of\nattitudes toward same-sex marriage within birth cohort. And\nwhile research has examined the relationship between religi-\nosity and cohort (Hoge, Johnson, & Luidens, 1994;Wuthnow,\ntionship between religiosity, spirituality, cohort, and attitudes\ntoward same-sex marriage. Should Millennials and\nGeneration X carry their current attitudes toward religion,\nsame-sex marriage, and other social attitudes and behaviors\nthroughout their life course, our society will experience sig-\nnificant change on several dimensions.\nMillennials are more likely to report no religious prefer-\nence, and they attend religious services at lower levels than\nall other cohorts. They pray less frequently and have the low-\nest percentage of respondents who hold a literal interpreta-\ntion of the Bible (Gay & Lynxwiler, 2013). Millennials have\nthe lowest proportion of respondents who identify with\ndenominations that are categorized as evangelical or main-\nline Protestants. The percentage who identify as Catholics is\nvery similar to all other birth cohorts. For the most part, all\nindicators are that they are less religious. Do these trends in\nreligiosity and spirituality across cohort affect attitudes\ntoward same-sex marriage?\nThe purpose of this research is to take a step in that direc-\ntion. Toward that end, first we examine mean differences in\nGay et al. 5\nattitudes among the four cohorts in attitudes toward same-\nsex marriage with and without controls. Second, we regress\nattitudes toward same-sex marriage on birth cohort, religios-\nity, spirituality, and control variables for the entire sample.\nThird, we analyze separate regression analyses to assess the\nrelationship between religion and spirituality on attitudes\ntoward same-sex marriage within each cohort controlling for\nsociodemographic variables.\nControl Variables\nCohort differences in attitudes toward same-sex marriage\nmay be related to factors other than religious and spiritual\nmatters. Recent research demonstrates the importance of\ncontrolling for a variety of sociodemographic variables (e.g.,\nSherkat et al., 2011). This research demonstrates that atti-\ntudes toward same-sex marriage vary by marital status, gen-\nder, socioeconomic status, geographic residence, and race\nand ethnicity to mention a few. As a result, this study incor-\nporates control variables in the analysis. Previous research\nhas demonstrated that women are more supportive of same-\nsex sexuality and same-sex marriage. Higher educational\nattainment has also been associated with support for same-\nsex marriage. Sherkat et al. (2010) reports variations in atti-\ntudes by race, region of residence, and community size.\nPeople who live in the south and reside in rural areas are\ngenerally less supportive of same-sex marriage. Baunch\n(2012) points to the importance of including African\nAmericans in an analysis of attitudes toward same-sex mar-\nriage and Ellison, Acevedo, and Ramos-Wada (2011) report\nthe importance of the variation among Hispanics. It is pos-\nsible that the inclusion of African American Protestants will\naffect the results for other African Americans. It is also likely\nthat evangelical Protestants will affect the Hispanic effect.\nEllison et al. (2011) point to the strong opposition by evan-\ngelical Latinos as contributing to considerable heterogeneity\nof attitudes toward same-sex marriage. Given the presence of\nrace and ethnicity in the literature, dummy variables to rep-\nresent African American and Hispanic respondents are incor-\nporated in the analysis. In short, drawing from previous\nresearch, we also included a dummy variable for female\nrespondents, dummy variables for divorced/separated and\nnever married respondents, a dummy variable for southern\nresidence, a Likert-type scale item for community size, and a\n20-point scale for years of educational attainment.\nAnalytic Strategy\nThe analytic strategy used ordinary least squares (OLS) mul-\ntiple regression to examine the effects of birth cohort, religi-\nosity, spirituality, and sociodemographic variables on attitudes\ntoward same-sex marriage.Adummy variable for survey year\nwas included to assess whether survey year affected the anal-\nysis. The inclusion of the survey year dummy variable did not\naffect the analysis in any significant way. That is, the inclu-\nsion of the variable did not affect the significance level of\nany of the independent or control variables.\nMethod\nLike many previous studies of differences in religious, social\nand political attitudes, data for this study were taken from the\nGSS. The data in these surveys were collected from nation-\nwide samples through interviews (Smith et al., 2015). For the\nfollowing analysis, only respondents who were interviewed\ndata set because the data set contains survey items tapping\nattitudes toward same-sex marriage, religious and spiritual-\nity items, and a wide range of sociodemographic and back-\nground characteristics of respondents. A total of 2,977\nrespondents were asked the question concerning same-sex\nmarriage. Our analysis focused on religious traditions identi-\nfied by Steensland et al. (2000), and as a result, not all\nrespondents in the total sample are included in the analysis.\nAs we analyzed birth cohorts separately, some groups were\nomitted due to small sample sizes. For example, the total\nsample only included 40 respondents who identified as\nJewish and 18 who identified as Muslim. Moreover, there\nwere other religious affiliations that were not part of the\noperationalization of religious traditions incorporated in the\nanalysis due to limited sample size. Furthermore, one of the\ndifficulties with the GSS data was identifying Asian\nAmericans and other races and ethnic groups. Of the total\nrespondents on the race question, 458 were coded \"other\"\n(White and Black are the other two categories). The Hispanic\nquestion for ethnic origin was more direct. Finally, with the\nlistwise deletion of data for the analysis, the final sample size\nis 2,375. See the appendix for the total frequencies for all\nvariables and categories included in the analysis.\nDependent Variable\nThe item addressing attitudes toward same-sex marriage was\nread the following statement: \"`Homosexual' couples should\nhave the right to marry one another.\" The respondents were\nthen presented five response categories that ranged from 1\n(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). All other responses\n(i.e., \"can't choose\" and \"no answer\") are excluded from the\nanalysis.\nIndependent Variables\nBirth cohort. Four birth cohorts were identified for the analy-\nsis. The Millennial cohort was identified as respondents who\nidentified as respondents who were born between 1965 and\n6 SAGE Open\nthe Silent Generation were those who were born before 1945\n(n = 393). The baby boom cohort served as the reference\ncategory.\nReligious affiliation. Religious affiliation was measured using\ntwo questions in the GSS. The first question was, \"What is\nyour religious preference? Is it Protestant, Catholic, Jewish,\nsome other religion, or no religion?\" An additional question\nasked whether the response to the first question was Protes-\ntant. The question was, \"What specific denomination is that,\nif any?\" These two questions were used to recode religious\naffiliation in accordance with the Steensland et al. (2000)\ncategorical scheme. Hence, not all religious affiliations were\nincluded in the analyses. In addition, to run separate models\nfor each birth cohort, Jewish respondents were omitted due\nto small sample sizes within cohorts. The resulting religious\ncategories were mainline Protestants, evangelical Protes-\ntants, African American Protestants, Catholics, and no reli-\ngious preference. Mainline Protestants served as the reference\ncategory.\nAttendance at religious services. Public religious participation\nwas measured by religious attendance. The question was,\n\"How often do you attend religious services?\" The responses\nranged from 0 (never) to 8 (more than once a week). Only\nvalid responses were used in the analysis. That is, \"don't\nknow\" and \"no answer\" responses were omitted from the\nanalysis.\nBiblical literalism.Literalism was measured through the fol-\nlowing question to assess their beliefs concerning the Bible.\n\"Which of the following statements comes the closest to\ndescribing your feelings about the Bible--`The Bible is the\nactual word of God and is to be taken literally'; `The Bible is\nthe inspired word of God but not everything in it should be\ntaken literally, word for word'; or `The Bible is an ancient\nbook of fables, legends, history, and moral precepts recorded\nby man?'\" Respondents who considered the Bible to be \"the\nactual word of God and is to be taken literally\" were coded\n(1) and all others were coded (0) for the analysis.\nPrayer. The final variable that addresses subjective religios-\nity was the question concerning prayer. The frequency of\nprayer is measured by the following question: \"About how\noften do you pray?\" Responses were coded (1) never, (2) less\nthan once a week, (3) once a week, (4) several times a week,\n(5) once a day, and (6) several times a day. \"Don't know\" and\n\"no answer\" responses were omitted from the analysis.\nSBNR. We use two items from the GSS to operationalize the\nSBNR variable and followed the measurement strategy of\nprevious research (e.g., Chaves, 2011). The first question\naddressed subjective spirituality. The question in the GSS is,\n\"To what extent do you consider yourself a spiritual person?\nAre you . . . \" The possible responses ranged from 1 (very\nspiritual) to 4 (not spiritual at all). Subjective religiosity was\nmeasured by a question tapping the importance of religion in\ntheir everyday lives. The question in the GSS was, \"To what\nextent do you consider yourself a religious person? Are you\n. . . \" The possible responses to this question ranged from 1\n(very religious) to 4 (not religious at all). \"Not applicable,\"\n\"don't know,\" and \"no answer\" responses for both of these\nquestions were omitted from the analysis. An SBNR dummy\nvariable was created through a combination of the subjective\nspirituality and religiousness questions. Individuals who\nreport being \"very spiritual\" or \"moderately spiritual\" on the\nspirituality variable and \"slightly religious\" or \"not religious\nat all\" on the religious variable were coded (1) and represent\nthe SBNR respondents. All other valid responses were coded\n(0). \"Don't know\" and \"no answer\" responses were omitted\nfrom the analysis.\nControl Variables\nMarital status and gender. The marital status question in the\nGSS asks respondents if they are currently married, wid-\nowed, divorced, separated, or have ever been married. Mari-\ntal status was recoded to represent three statuses. Dummy\nvariables were created to represent respondents who were\nmarried or widowed, divorced or separated, and never mar-\nried. Married respondents served as the reference category in\nthe analysis. Gender was coded (1) to represent female\nrespondents and males were coded (0).\nSouthern residence and community size.A dummy variable\nwas created for southern residence. The GSS includes an\nitem that indicates the respondent's area of residence. The\ncoding followed the U.S. census coding for region. The\nresulting codes in the GSS are (1) New England, (2) Middle\nAtlantic, (3) East North Central, (4) West North Central, (5)\nSouth Atlantic, (6) East South Central, (7) West South Cen-\ntral, (8) Mountain, and (9) Pacific. A dummy variable was\ncreated using the South Atlantic, East South Central, West\nSouth Central codes to represent the South (South = 1, all\nothers = 0). Urban residence was measured using the Survey\nResearch Center (SRC) Belt Code (Survey Research Center,\nUniversity of Michigan). The variable was recoded so that\nthe \"central city of the 12 largest SMSAs\" was coded (6),\n\"central city of the remainder of the 100 largest SMSAs\" was\ncoded (5), \"suburbs of the 12 largest SMSAs\" was coded (4),\n\"suburbs of the remaining 100 largest SMSAs\" was coded\n(3), \"other urban\" was coded (2), and \"rural\" was coded (1).\nEducational attainment. The responses for educational attain-\nment in the GSS were in years of school completed and\nranged from 0 to 20. Using years of education as proxy for\neducational attainment was relatively straightforward for\nyears 0 through 12. Years of education after high school may\nbe more subjective. That is, for many people, it may take\nlonger than 2 years to obtain an associate degree or longer\nGay et al. 7\nthan 4 years to get a bachelor's degree and so on. The\nassumption is that the number of years beyond high school\nreflects the appropriate vocational and academic degrees.\nRace and ethnicity.Dummy variables were created for race\nand ethnicity by using the questions concerning race and\nHispanic identification. For purposes of this analysis, respon-\ndents who identified as White, African American, or His-\npanic (regardless of race) were included. White respondents\nserved as the reference category.\nResults\nTable 1 displays the means, standard deviations, and propor-\ntions for attitudes toward same-sex marriage, the religious\nvariables, subjective spirituality, and the control variables for\neach cohort in the analysis. The table also presents the sam-\nple size for each of the cohorts. Hence, proportions in the\ntable reflect the number of respondents represented by each\ndummy variable. The table exhibits some interesting com-\nparisons on the dependent and independent variables across\nthe four cohorts.

There was also a pattern of mean\ndifferences.Asteady decrease in level of acceptance was evi-\ndent across the four cohorts. The Millennial cohort had the\nhighest mean score (more likely to agree that same-sex cou-\nples should be allowed to marry) and the Silent Generation\nhad the lowest.\nSecond, the table shows both religious affiliation category\ndifferences and similarities. The proportion of each cohort\nwho was Catholic was relatively constant. The same was\nthe case for African American Protestants. The cohort differ-\nences were among no preference respondents, evangelical\nProtestants, and mainline Protestants. Table 1 shows that the\nproportion of no religious preference respondents was highest\namong the Millennial cohort and lowest among the Silent\nGeneration. This pattern was reversed for both evangelical and\nmainline Protestants. The Millennials had a lower proportion\nof these two religious categories than the older cohorts.\nThird, the Millennial cohort had the lowest mean and pro-\nportion scores for the remaining three religiosity variables\n(i.e., attendance, Biblical literalism, and frequency of prayer).\nThe Silent Generation had the highest mean for attendance at\nof Biblical literalist (.35), and the highest mean for the fre-\nresearch shows that attendance has a tendency to increase\nTable 1.

In addition, the Millennial cohort attends religious\nservices less than the baby boom cohort did at the same age.\nBengtson et al. (2013) contend that the oldest birth cohort in\nthis study is the most religious among the cohorts identified,\nand the results in Table 1 are consistent with their research.\nWe also examined mean differences across religious affil-\niation categories for the total sample. An ANOVA revealed\nsignificant religious affiliation mean differences for attitudes\nWith one exception, all post hoc mean comparisons were sta-\ntistically significant (p < .001). The lone exception was the\ndifference between mainline Protestants and African\nAmerican Protestants. Hence, these two religious categories\nappear to be more similar than dissimilar in their attitudes\ntoward same-sex marriage. This is important to note because\nmainline Protestants represent the reference group for all\nregression models in Tables 2 and 3.\nThe subsequent analyses addressed the relative impact of\nreligiosity, spirituality, and sociodemographic variables on\nattitudes toward same-sex marriage for the full sample (Table\n2) and for each cohort (Table 3). Table 2 displays two models\nwhere attitudes toward same-sex marriage were regressed on\nthree dummy variables for cohort (Model I) and on the cohort\ndummy variables, religious and spirituality independent\nvariables, and controls (Model II). The first model included\ndummy variables for three of the birth cohorts and accounted\nfor 6.5% of the variation in attitudes toward same-sex atti-\nregression coefficients for the Millennial cohort, Generation\nX, and the Silent Generation. The Baby Boom cohort was the\nreference group for both models. The coefficients represent\nmean differences (Model I) and adjusted mean differences\n(Model II) between the three dummy variables representing\nthe Millennials, Generation X, and the Silent Generation and\nthe Baby Boom reference cohort. Model I shows that the\np < .01) had higher scores than the Baby Boomers on the\nattitudes toward same-sex marriage scale. In contrast, the\nSilent Generation had a lower score (b = -.451, p < .01) than\nthe Baby Boomers. The coefficients in Model II control for\nreligious and spirituality independent variables and the\nsociodemographic control variables. The model explained\n32.4% of the variation in attitudes toward same-sex marriage,\ndummy variables mirrored the results without controls. That\nis, cohort differences remained when religious, spirituality,\nand control variables were included in the full model.\nTable 2 also displays the results for the religious and spiritu-\nality variables for the total sample. Model II shows that evan-\ngelicalProtestantsweresignificantlylesssupportiveofsame-sex\nmarriage than mainline Protestants (b = -.260, p < .01). Catholic\nrespondents (b = .222, p < .01) and no preference respondents\n(b = .197, p < .05) were more supportive than the comparison\ncategory. African American Protestants were not signifi-\ncantly different from mainline Protestants. Table 2 shows\nthat as attendance at religious services increased, support for\nsame-sex marriage decreased. This is also the case for fre-\nquency of prayer. Respondents who believe in the literal\ninterpretation of the Bible were less supportive of same-sex\nmarriage than those who do not hold those beliefs. The final\nindependent variable in Model II represents the SBNR\nrespondents. Those who were SBNR had a higher score on\nthe attitudes toward same-sex marriage scale than all others.\nThis is consistent with previous research on the relationship\nbetween subjective spirituality and attitudes toward same-\nThe sociodemographic control variables showed a pattern\nthat is generally consistent with the extant literature. Females\nwere more supportive than males, never married respondents\nwere more supportive that married respondents, and south-\nerners were less supportive than respondents in other parts of\nthe country. In addition, as community size increased, so did\nsupport for same-sex marriage, and higher educational\nattainment predicted greater support. The variable represent-\ning African American respondents was not statistically sig-\nnificant and neither was the variable representing Hispanic\nrespondents. Thus, the analysis of the full sample provided a\nbaseline for cohort differences, the impact of religiosity and\nspirituality, and other determinants of attitudes toward same-\nsex marriage. All but one of the cohort differences remained\nwhen controls were included. We extend the existing litera-\nture on cohort and religiosity differences by analyzing each\ncohort independently.\nTable 3 displays the results of the regression analysis for\neach cohort. That is, separate regression analyses were run for\nMillennials, Generation X, Baby Boomers, and the Silent\nGeneration. These regression analyses afforded the opportu-\nnity to examine the unique determinants of attitudes toward\nsame-sex marriage by cohort. Each model includes the reli-\ngious, spirituality, and control variables. The first model shows\nthe coefficients for the Millennial cohort and accounted for\nysis for Millennials shows that Catholics (b = .391, p < .01),\nAfrican American Protestants (b = .552, p < .01), and no pref-\nerence respondents (b = .429, p < .01) were more supportive of\nsame-sex marriage than mainline Protestants. While other\nresearch points to some variation within religious tradition, this\nresearch also points to differences between religious traditions\namong young adults even when control variables are included\nin the models (Walls et al., 2014). Interestingly, there was no\nsignificant difference between evangelical Protestants and\nmainline Protestants. Like the model for the full sample in\nTable 2, respondents who believe in the literal interpretation of\nthe Bible were less supportive. In addition, as the frequency of\nprayer increased, support for same-sex marriage decreased. In\ncontrast to other cohorts, attendance at religious services had\nnoeffect on attitudes toward same-sex marriage for Millennial\nGay et al. 9\nrespondents. SBNR respondents also showed no significant\ndifference.\nIn the Generation X model of Table 3, we see a different\npattern of results.

Like the Millennial cohort, as attendance at\nreligious services increased, support for same-sex marriage\ndecreased. The effects of the belief in the literal interpretation\nof the Bible and the frequency of prayer were consistent with\nthe Millennial cohort and the analysis of the full sample.\nHowever, unlike the Millennial cohort, respondents identified\nas SBNR were more supportive of same-sex marriage than\nThe third model in Table 3 presents the results for the\nBaby Boom cohort and accounts for 30.9% of the variation\n< .001.

The model for the Silent Generation shows that\nevangelical Protestants were significantly less supportive\nthan the reference category (b = -.507, p < .01) and no reli-\ngious preference respondents were significantly more sup-\nportive of same-sex marriage (b = .625, p < .01). Catholics\nand African American Protestants showed no significant dif-\nferences from the mainline Protestant reference category.\nThere were only two religious or spiritual variables in the\nmodel that were significant. Attendance at religious services\nhad a marginally significant negative effect (b = -.048, p <\n.10). And respondents who believe in a literal interpretation\nof the Bible were less supportive of same-sex marriages (b =\n-.189, p < .01). There was no significant effect for respon-\ndents who were identified as SBNR.\nAmong the control variables, female respondents were\nconsistently more supportive than males across all cohorts.\nThis is also the case for educational attainment. For all\ncohorts, as educational attainment increased, so do attitudes\ntoward same-sex marriage. There was no consistent pattern\nfor the other control variables. The effect of southern resi-\ndence was found among Baby Boomers but not among other\ncohorts. This finding raises some interesting questions con-\ncerning southern residence.\nDiscussion\nLimitations\nFirst, our study uses a cross-sectional design, and we are\nsomewhat limited as a result. We are unable to examine\ncohorts when they were at the same age (e.g., Millennials\nand Baby Boomers when they were both in their twenties),\nwe could not follow a cohort over time, and the data are sim-\nply not available to assess period or time of measurement\neffects. Therefore, we could not conduct a thorough Age/\nPeriod/Cohort research design. Nevertheless, the GSS data\ndo afford the opportunity to assess the relationship between\nTable 3.

Issues related to same-sex marriage are very\nimportant at this particular time in American society, and we\nare able to point to several interesting patterns or trends. We\nwere able to examine the determinants of attitudes toward\nsame-sex marriage within cohorts and compare these effects\nusing national data.\nSecond,thisstudywasalsolimitedtoProtestants,Catholics,\nand no religious preference respondents. This is due to small\nsample sizes of other religious categories and the analytic\nstrategy to examine each cohort separately for comparisons.\nThe focus was to examine the determinants of attitudes toward\nsame-sex marriage for each cohort.As a result, Jewish respon-\ndents, Muslim respondents, and other religious respondents\ndid not have a large enough sample size to be included in the\nanalysis. And third, the analysis is limited to White respon-\ndents, African American respondents, and Hispanic respon-\ndents. Hence, a number of racial and ethnic groups are not part\nof the analysis. In addition, we were not able to further exam-\nine the variation among Latinos identified by Ellison et al.\n(2011). Future research should examine comparisons using\nmore diverse data.\nConclusion\nThis study shows several interesting patterns. First, among\nthe Millennial cohort, respondents who identify with evan-\ngelical Protestant denominations show no significant differ-\nences from their mainline Protestant counterparts. The bulk\nof the social scientific literature concludes that White evan-\ngelical Protestants are the least likely set of denominations\nto support same-sex marriage. However, this is not the case\nfor the Millennial cohort. They may think of same-sex mar-\nriage in different ways than their older cohorts. Second,\nattendance at religious services has no effect on Millennials'\nattitudes. This runs counter to the extant literature for the\ngeneral population (Sherkat et al., 2011). Attendance at reli-\ngious services has shown a consistent negative relationship\nwith attitudes toward same-sex relations. That is, increased\nattendance has been associated with less support for same-\nsex marriage. However, recent research (Walls et al., 2014)\nfound no effect for attendance among a sample of college\nstudents when other controls were included in the models.\nThird, among Millennials, African American Protestants are\nmore likely to support same-sex marriage than their pre-\ndominantly White, mainline Protestant counterparts. This\nruns counter to other cohorts where African American\nProtestants and mainline Protestants are in line with one\nanother. Fourth, while SBNR respondents are more support-\nive of same-sex marriage for Generation X and the Baby\nBoomers, this is not the case for the Millennial cohort.\nIf these patterns persist for the Millennial cohort, some\naspects of the relationship between religiosity, spirituality,\nand attitudes toward same-sex marriage are likely to change\nin the general population.\nThese results call for additional research on the relation-\nship between religiosity, spirituality, and attitudes toward\nsame-sex marriage for the Millennial birth cohort and\nGeneration X. A smaller percentage of the Millennial cohort\nidentifies as evangelical, but 14% of the sample does express\nan evangelical religious preference. The results suggest that\nyounger evangelical respondents are more supportive of\nsame-sex marriage than their older counterparts. Perhaps the\nmost striking result is that attendance at religious services\nhas no effect on same-sex attitudes for Millennials.Affiliation\nand participation are components of institutional effects that\nare simply not present for this younger cohort. Therefore,\ngoing back to \"church\" later in the life course is not likely to\nhave the same effect as it may have had for the Baby Boom\nThe subjective aspects of religiosity in the analysis are\nconsistent with previous research. Those who believe in the\nliteral interpretation of the Bible are less supportive of\nsame-sex marriage. The relationship between the literal\ninterpretation of the Bible and attitudes toward same-sex\nmarriage is consistent across all four cohorts. The other sub-\njective component of religiosity is the frequency of prayer.\nPrayer occurs inside and outside the religious institution.\nFor Millennials and Generation X, as the frequency of\nprayer increases, support for same-sex marriage decreases.\nFuture research should examine this relationship in more\ndetail.\nAll indications are that there are changes in the American\nreligious landscape. Younger adults in general are less reli-\nHowever, our conclusions concerning the Millennial evan-\ngelical Protestants are not based on them being less religious.\nEven though the percentage may be lower than other cohorts,\ntheir attitudes do not differ from the mainline Protestants. The\nresults show this is also the case for attendance at religious\nservices. Therefore, our results show a differential impact of\nreligiosity and spirituality on attitudes toward same-sex mar-\nriage for the Millennial cohort. As the Millennial cohort and\nGeneration X age, social scientific research is needed to\nassess the extent to which these younger age cohorts exhibit\nchanges in religiosity, spirituality, and attitudes toward same-\nsex marriage. These two cohorts are the most likely to experi-\nence the changes of same-sex marriage in our society. Future\nresearch can address a wide range of issues now that law pro-\ntects fairness and equality in marriage.\nAuthors' Note\nData were made available via the International Consortium for\nPolitical and Social Research (ICPSR), Ann Arbor, MI.
