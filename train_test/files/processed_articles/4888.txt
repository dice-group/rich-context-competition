When they have, the data\nwere usually limited to the election-year performance of the\nmarket and only a subset of elections (Biewald, 2003; Chan\nthe net percentage change in the stock market in the years\npreceding all American presidential reelection bids. For this\nstudy, \"reelection\" is an election featuring an incumbent\npresident, whether or not he initially obtained office via an\nelection.\nWe find a significant positive relationship between the\nstock market's net percentage change during the 3 years prior\nto a reelection bid and the incumbent's popular vote-margin\npercentage. The net percentage change in the stock market for\n1-, 2- and 4-year periods preceding the election is each a\nweaker yet significant predictor of reelection outcomes. Our\nresults are robust to multiple variations in the elements of the\ntesting procedure: measures of the stock market's perfor-\nmance, measures of election outcomes, statistical methods\nused to gauge the relationship between the two, durations of\ndata, and the presence of additional variables. The relationship\ndoes not extend to the incumbent party's candidate when the\nincumbent does not run. We find that relationships between\nthe incumbent's popular vote-margin percentage and the pre-\nceding net percentage change in gross domestic product\n(GDP), the inflation rate and the unemployment rate are often\ninsignificant and always weaker than those between the\nincumbent's popular vote margin and net percentage change in\nthe stock market.\nOur results contribute to the literature by elucidating the\nrelative value of stock indexes for election forecasting mod-\nels, challenging economic voting hypotheses, exploring an\nunderlying motivator of financial and political choice, sug-\ngesting a strategy for political party officials and candidates,\nand offering ideas for future research. At the theoretical\nlevel, our findings are consistent with Prechter's (1979,\n1Socionomics Institute, Gainesville, GA, USA\n2Emory University School of Medicine,Atlanta, GA, USA\n3University of Cambridge, UK\nCorresponding Author:\nMatthew Lampert, Faculty of Human, Social and Political Science,\nDepartment of Sociology, University of Cambridge, Free School Lane,\nCambridge CB2 3RQ, UK\nEmail: mel46@cam.ac.uk\nSocial Mood, Stock Market Performance,\nand U.S. Presidential Elections:\nA Socionomic Perspective on\nVoting Results\nRobert R.

The\n\"big three\" popularity functions traditionally mentioned in\nthe literature are economic growth, inflation, and unemploy-\nJones (2002) considered many models developed since\n1952 that attempt to predict U.S. elections and concluded\nthat the most effective single predictor of these election out-\ncomes is the state of the election-year economy. Fair (2002)\nlooked for a relationship between a number of different eco-\nnomic factors and the percentage of the popular vote received\nby the incumbent party's presidential candidates between\nthe election-year GDP growth and the percentage of popular\nvotes received. Biewald (2003), however, repeated Fair's\nstudy with an additional 50 years of data and found that\nelection-year GDP growth is only weakly correlated with\nelection results.\nNannestad and Paldam (1994) found that studies relating\neconomic growth to election outcomes yielded inconsistent\nresults, so they discarded GDP as an explanatory variable\nand instead emphasized inflation and unemployment. Jones\n(2002) found some evidence for a relationship between the\nelection-year inflation rate and the percentage of popular\nvotes received. Biewald (2003), however, found that with the\ninclusion of an additional 50 years of data, the inflation rate\nwas no longer related to election results. Chrystal and Peel\n(1986) found that neither inflation nor unemployment was\nrobustly related to the popularity of the government.\nthe Democratic Party's share of the two-party popular vote\nbased on several factors, including the rate of change in\ngross national product for two different durations prior to an\nelection, a time trend variable coded according to which\nparty was in power, and whether the election involved an\nincumbent. One version of this model (Fair, 1988) achieved\na strong coefficient of determination (R2) of .89.\nTo an iteration of Fair's model, Gleisner (1992) added the\npercentage change of the Dow Jones Industrial Average over\na 10-month period prior to the election. This addition signifi-\ncantly improved the fit of the model and rendered Fair's time\ntrend variable insignificant. Chan and Jordan (2004) found\nthat the equity market's performance for 10 months prior to\nan election was a better predictor than GDP growth of incum-\nbents' election results in recent years. The following section\nexplores a possible theoretical explanation for these\nimproved results.\nSocionomicVoting\nImplicit in much of the economic voting literature is the pas-\nsive organism model of human action: Humans are seen as\nessentially reactive. Many of the social sciences have\nadopted this stimulus\u00adresponse model of human psychology\npopularized by behaviorist psychologists such as Watson\nrejected this model as too simplistic or inaccurate, it lives on\nin many implicit assumptions of other social sciences,\nincluding political science.\nSpecifically, the conceptualization of popularity and reac-\ntion functions carries with it three assumptions: (a) that there\nis a reciprocal causal relationship between the electorate's\nopinions of its elected leaders (popularity functions) and the\neconomic policy responses of those leaders (reaction func-\ntions); (b) that voters react to economic conditions, political\nevents, and manipulation so that various economic and policy\ninputs have reactive voting outputs; and (c) that voters act con-\nsciously and rationally after logically evaluating candidates'\npolitical policies and deciding whether these policies have\nserved (under the theory of retrospective voting) or will serve\n(under the theory of prospective voting) their best interests.\nIn contrast, socionomic theory offers competing models\nof mood, human action, and making choices. Prechter (1999)\nposited that social mood--the aggregate, unconscious levels\nof optimism and pessimism in a society--emerges spontane-\nously in self-organizing human social systems, fluctuates\naccording to an internally regulated growth process described\nby Elliott's (1938) wave model, is impervious to economic\nand political stimuli, and drives collective human action and\nnonrational decision making unconsciously in contexts of\nuncertainty. Presidential elections--the focus of our study--\nappear to qualify as a context of uncertainty. Delli Carpini\nPrechter et al. 3\nvincingly the typical voter's pervasive ignorance and uncer-\ntainty with respect to information about elections. Rahn\n(2000) found that \"public mood\" may be an important influ-\nence on political decision making, concluding that the degree\nof uncertainty accounts for the extent to which mood influ-\nences political behavior.\nSocionomic theory specifically applies to the reelection\nhypothesized that when social mood has been trending\ntoward optimism, voters will be more inclined to desire to\nkeep the incumbent in office; and when social mood has\nbeen trending toward pessimism, voters will be more inclined\nto desire a change from the incumbent. Contrasting sharply\nwith Stimson's (1991) more cognitive \"policy mood\" con-\ncept, Prechter proposed that the policies of the incumbent\nand his challenger are irrelevant to this dynamic. He sur-\nmised that voters unconsciously (and erroneously) credit\nincumbents for their positive moods and blame incumbents\nfor their negative moods. This explanation appears similar to\nwhich voters blame the incumbent for consciously perceived,\nexternally produced, negative economic circumstances. In\nthe socionomic formulation, however, voters blame the\nincumbent for unconsciously experienced, internally regu-\nlated, negative social mood.\nUnder socionomic theory, policy statements and actions\nby leaders are powerless to affect the mood of the voters;\ninstead, the mood of the voters has a powerful effect on the\npolicy statements and actions of leaders. Three studies sup-\nported this formulation. Kuklinski and Segura (1995)\nreviewed literature concerning mood and politics and\nreported that mood appeared unresponsive to politicians'\nefforts to influence it. They further argued that Stimson's\npolicy mood concept \"might better be viewed as affective:\nwhen people become dissatisfied and angry, they come to\nfavor less government or at least a change in the govern-\nment's current activities\" (Kuklinski & Segura, 1995, p. 13).\nNofsinger & Kim (2003) found a relationship between the\ntrend of social mood and the subsequent actions of U.S. law-\nmakers. They reported that Congress tended to tighten\ninvestment restrictions after social mood had become more\nnegative, as indicated by a substantial decline in stock prices,\nand tended to loosen investment restrictions after social\nmood had become more positive, as indicated by a substan-\ntial rise in stock prices. Geer (2006) reported that, rather than\nnegative political ads making voters feel more pessimistic,\nvoters' preexisting attitudes instead affected how candidates\nchose their advertising. In concert with these suggestive\nideas, socionomic theory explicitly proposes that economic\nand political trends are results of social mood, not causes, so\nthe direction of predictive power between mood and social\nevents is the opposite of that traditionally assumed.\nSocionomic theory affirms the active organism model of\nhuman action (Overton & Ennis, 2006; Overton & Reese,\n1973) that humans are innately and spontaneously active in\ntheir cognitive, affective, and conative processes. Under the\nsocionomic model, voters do not passively wait for politi-\ncians' policies and promises to program their responses but\nrather express social mood spontaneously. Under the hypoth-\nesis that changes in social mood unconsciously impel\nhumans to take social actions expressing their moods, socio-\nnomic theory proposes that changes in indicators of social\nmood can be used to anticipate the direction and character of\nsocial trends, including those in politics.\nSocionomic theory pertains to voting tendencies at the\naggregate level. Many individual voters may, to a degree or\nfor a time, consistently cast ballots along party lines, reli-\ngious lines, single-issue lines, philosophical lines, or some\nother overriding factor. We suspect that \"swing\" voters with\nlittle or no philosophical anchor are among the ones acting\nmost readily to express social mood in the voting booth.\nRegardless of departures from socionomic motivation at the\nindividual level, social mood under this theory can power-\nfully regulate voting outcomes at the aggregate level.\nargued that, for the present, stock market indexes appear to\nbe the best available indicator of social mood, because inves-\ntors can act swiftly in this context to express their optimism\nand pessimism. Recent work in the area of online social sen-\ntiment analysis by Bollen, Mao, and Zeng (2011) and Gilbert\nand Karahalios (2010) provided empirical support for the\nidea that financial markets are responsive to changes in\nsocial sentiment. Because stock market averages register\nchanges in mood and possess an extensive data history, they\nare uniquely appropriate for the long-term historical analysis\nthat we undertake in this article.\nRiley and Luksetich (1980) saw the stock market as an\nindicator of social mood. They implied, however, that political\nparties influence mood by shaping the public's expectations of\nfuture business conditions. Socionomic theory, in contrast,\nproposes that social mood--a hidden, independent variable--\nsimultaneously determines both stock market outcomes and\nincumbent presidential reelection outcomes. This formulation\navoids the error, as we see it, of confusing the indicator with\nthe cause. Santa-Clara and Valkanov (2003) ruminated over\nwhether political variables cause fluctuations in stock returns,\nor the reverse.According to socionomic theory, neither formu-\nlation is correct; rather, social-mood trends regulate stock\ntrends and political trends concurrently.\nA popular explanation for why the economy often lags\nthe stock market is that investors accurately anticipate,\nmonths in advance, the economic future and then rationally\nPrechter (2003) challenged this idea on both theoretical\nand empirical grounds. Socionomic theory proposes instead\nthat macroeconomic indicators, such as rates of economic\n4 SAGE Open\ngrowth, inflation, and unemployment, respond to social\nmood to some degree, but they do so far less immediately, as\nit takes months on average for business people to carry out\nmood-motivated decisions due to the time requirements of\nmeeting, planning, lending or borrowing, opening or closing\nfacilities, hiring or firing, building or reducing inventory,\nand so on. In the aggregate, these delayed results show up as\nincreases or decreases in production, expansions or contrac-\ntions of credit, and increases or decreases in the labor force.\nInvestors, on the other hand, can buy or sell in the stock\nmarket almost immediately in response to social mood, so\nits effects appear there prior to appearing in macroeconomic\nindicators.\nSocionomic theory stands in contrast to expectations the-\nory in postulating that social mood regulates other social\nvariables, including the economy, which is merely another\nresult rather than the cause. We shall offer evidence that the\ntrend of social mood, not the trend of the stock market per se,\nregulates voting with respect to the reelection or rejection of\nincumbents.\nSocionomic theory (Prechter, 1999) made the following\npredictions regarding incumbents' reelection attempts:\n1. An increasingly positive social mood, indicated by\na rising stock market, will positively influence an\nincumbent's reelection chances.\n2. An increasingly negative social mood, indicated by\na falling stock market, will negatively influence an\nincumbent's reelection chances.\n3. Extreme changes in social mood, indicated by\nextreme changes in the stock market, will tend to\nmotivate more extreme voting preferences for or\nagainst the incumbent.\n4. An indicator of social mood, the stock market, will\npredict the outcomes of reelection bids better than\nwill rates of economic growth, inflation, and/or\nunemployment.\nMethod and Results\nTo investigate these formulations, we first examine the rela-\ntionship between the net change in the stock market and the\nensuing popular vote margin--the number of percentage\npoints separating the incumbent from his nearest challenger\nin the popular vote--for or against incumbent presidents in\nU.S. elections. The Dow Jones Industrial Average serves to\nrepresent the U.S. stock market from 1897 to the present.\nPrior to 1897, we use the Foundation for the Study of\nCycles' data series, which normalizes stock market data\nfrom earlier indexes to the Dow to create a longer series\n(DJIA) that encompasses all U.S. presidential elections from\nthat is likely to reflect social mood in an election. For pur-\nposes of validation, we also consider four other measures of\nincumbent performance: percentages of total popular vote,\npercentages of total electoral vote, electoral vote-margin\npercentages, and overall wins and losses of elections.\nNext, we examine the relationship between the stock mar-\nket and the fates of incumbents in landslide elections. We\nthen relate the stock market to the popular vote margin for an\nincumbent's political party when the incumbent does not\nrun. A final set of analyses assesses the predictive ability of\nthe \"big three\" economic indicators--GDP, inflation, and\nunemployment--when modeled individually and together\nwith the stock market.\nPredicting Incumbent Election Results\nWe first compare the popular vote margin for or against an\nincumbent president with the stock market's net percentage\ngain or loss for the 3-year period preceding the election. We\noperationally define the 3-year period as the span of time\nfrom November 1 of the year after the previous election\nthrough October 31 of the year of the election under consid-\neration. We select this period because we observe anecdot-\nally that society tends to judge a president by the trends that\noccur during the bulk of the presidential term, barring much\nor all of the first year, for which the credit or blame is typi-\ncally assigned to the predecessor. Our analysis includes all\npresidential elections in which an incumbent candidate ran,\nbeginning in 1824 when popular vote data were first avail-\nable. A linear regression analysis yields a large and statisti-\nresults for the test described above (see Line 3) as well as\nfurther statistical results.\nTo assess the robustness of the results, we examine a\nnumber of variations in model parameters and analytic\napproaches. As shown in the table, significant positive pre-\ndictive relationships continue to emerge when varying the\nmeasuring period for the stock market to 1, 2, and 4 years.\nWe also bifurcate the data at two cutoff points: (a) the turn of\nthe 20th century and (b) the 100-year anniversary of the\ninception of popular vote tallies, which also roughly corre-\nsponds to the midpoint of the data span. The 3-year results\nmaintain across these bifurcated data sets. This consistency\nis compatible with socionomic theory, which proposes that\nsocial mood's influence on reelection results should be com-\nparable despite any changes between the 19th and 20th cen-\nturies in terms of campaign strategies, communications\ntechnology, election rules, extent of public participation, and\nso on. To relax distributional assumptions and lessen the\ninfluence of potential outliers, we also apply the nonpara-\nmetric Spearman's rank correlation test to all data condi-\ntions, and we obtain similar results, per Table 1.\nAs a final test of robustness, we repeat the entire analysis,\nsubstituting four other measures of election results in place\nof popular vote margin. Bivariate linear regression models\nfor three of these indicators--percentage of total popular\nvote that the incumbent receives, percentage of total elec-\ntoral vote that the incumbent receives, and electoral vote\nPrechter et al. 5\nmargin (the number of percentage points that separate the\nincumbent from his nearest challenger in the electoral\nvote)--produce similar results to those presented in Table 1.\nEvaluating the fourth measure, the incumbent's overall suc-\ncess or failure in winning the reelection bid, requires use of\nlogistic regression. Although this dichotomous variable suf-\nfers from a reduction in reliable score variance in compari-\nson with the continuously scaled criterion variables\nconsidered earlier, positive predictive relationships generally\nemerge, with a statistically significant (p = .022) logistic\nregression coefficient associated with the condition of pri-\nmary theoretical interest (see Table 2).\nTo summarize, our results signify that a net gain in the\nstock market during the 3 years preceding an election is\nstrongly predictive of more votes cast for the incumbent rela-\ntive to his nearest challenger, and a net stock market decline\nduring that period is strongly predictive of fewer votes cast\nfor the incumbent relative to his nearest challenger. More\ngenerally, net stock market changes for 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-year\nperiods preceding Election Day all serve as significant pre-\ndictors of election outcomes.\nIncumbentWins/Losses in Landslides\nSocionomic theory proposes that more extreme changes in\nsocial mood tend to motivate more extreme voting prefer-\nences for or against the leader. We test this hypothesis with\nregard to reelection bids by examining the relationship\nbetween prior net percentage change in the stock market and\nincumbent vote margin when both are large.\nWe look first at landslide victories as measured by\nelectoral vote margins. Records of electoral votes extend\nfarther back in time than popular vote tallies and thus pro-\nvide more data points to test. To define extreme conditions\noperationally, we deem an election a landslide victory if the\nincumbent competed for and won reelection by defeating\nthe nearest competitor with an electoral vote margin\nof 40% or greater. We deem the election a landslide loss if\nthe incumbent running for reelection trailed the winner\nby an electoral vote margin of 20% or greater. We define a\nlarge positive stock market change as a net gain of 20% or\nmore in the preceding 3-year period, and a large negative\nstock market change as a net loss of 10% or more. We\nchoose asymmetric percentage thresholds for electoral vote\nmargin and net stock market change, that is, (+40%, -20%)\nand (+20%, -10%), respectively, to be consistent with the a\npriori positive biases in both data series: Historically,\nan incumbent has a better than 50% chance of reelection,\nand the stock market tends to have a positive trend.\nWe summarize all historical data meeting these criteria in\na contingency table (Table 3). Fisher's exact test indicates a\nhigh degree of association between the two variables\n(p = .009). Although only 15 elections meet the criteria for\nanalysis, we can have confidence that the observed associa-\ntion is unlikely to have arisen due to chance in view of the\nexceptional predictive accuracy associated with these data\n(i.e., a 93% classification rate). Results as good or better\nwould occur less frequently than 1 time in 100 if there is, in\nfact, no relationship between the variables in the theoretical\npopulation.\nThe strong relationship between landslide elections and\nstock price movements is robust across a number of varia-\ntions in the parameter definitions, scaling, and indicators in\nthe model, including the following:\n\u00b7 the computation method used to define net stock\nmarket movement (i.e., whether considering per-\ncentage changes or lognormal changes);\nTable 1.

Similarly, we find that the predictive success rate\nwhen using electoral vote thresholds of (+20%, -10%) and\nthe nominal DJIA with stock market thresholds of (+20%,\nceding 4-year stock market thresholds in the nominal DJIA\nof (+0%, -0%), thereby relaxing the requirement that the\nmovements be large, and electoral vote thresholds of (+40%,\nWith regard to alternative definitions of election results, a\nlarge electoral vote advantage can sometimes occur in tan-\ndem with only a small popular vote advantage because of the\nnature of the Electoral College. Consequently, we analyze\npopular vote landslides as a further means of testing the rela-\ntionship under consideration. Because popular vote margins\nPrechter et al. 7\nare associated with fewer data points and tend to fall within\na tighter percentage range, we use smaller thresholds for\npopular vote margins (+10%, -5%) and 3-year percentage\nstock market changes in the nominal DJIA (+10%, -5%).\nEven under these conditions, the data produce a predictive\nanalyses, subjecting the popular vote-margin data to the\nmany conditional and definitional variations described above\ndo not diminish this strong relationship. For example, using\npopular vote-margin thresholds of (+10%, -10%) and 3-year\nstock market thresholds of (+0%, -0%) in the nominal\nDJIA, we obtain a predictive success rate of 92% (12 out of\nAs a final test of robustness, we combine the preceding\nmethodologies and define a landslide election victory as one\nin which the victor wins by a large margin in either the popu-\nlar vote (when data are available) or the electoral vote. This\nis also a somewhat more intuitive definition of what might\nqualify as a landslide victory. Using the same thresholds as\nbefore for electoral vote margin (+40%, -20%), popular vote\nmargin (+10%, -5%), and stock market lognormal change\n(+0.2, -0.1), we obtain a perfect classification rate (12 out of\n12, p = .005). Again, the results are robust to the many varia-\ntions we consider. For example, using thresholds of (+50%,\nvote margin, and (+0.1, -0.05) for stock market lognormal\nchange results in a 94% predictive success rate (15 out of 16,\nObserving confirmatory findings in response to numerous\nmethodological and analytical variations allows us to con-\nclude with a high degree of confidence that large stock mar-\nket advances tend to be strongly associated with subsequent\nlandslide victories as opposed to landslide defeats for incum-\nbent candidates in reelection bids. Conversely, large stock\nmarket declines tend to be strongly associated with subse-\nquent landslide defeats as opposed to landslide victories for\nincumbents. The stock market movements and election\nresults shown in Figure 1 illustrate this association visually.\nFigure 1 also includes some events that are outside the\nboundaries of our restrictive statistical tests. We add them to\ngive readers a flavor of the power of extremities in social\nmood to influence the tenure of leaders. Examples are King\nGeorge III's ousting as ruler of the American colonies in the\nstocks, the regional rejection from ballots of many candi-\nprices, and Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974 during the\nbiggest stock market decline in 36 years.\nPredicting Election Results for an Incumbent's\nPolitical Party\nWe next investigate whether the relationship between net\nstock market change and popular vote margin extends to a\npresident's political party when the president is not running\nfor reelection. As shown in the linear regression results in\nTable 4, we find no association between the 3-year net per-\ncentage change in the nominal DJIA and the popular vote\nmargin for a nonrunning incumbent's political party. We are\ninclined to hypothesize that voters project their moods on\nindividual leaders, not parties.\nConsidering Predictors OtherThan\nthe Stock Market\nIs the stock market a unique predictor of presidential reelec-\ntion outcomes, or do any of the \"big three\" economic vari-\nables yield stronger results? In this section, we explore the\npredictive power of GDP, inflation as measured by the\nProducer Price Index (PPI), and the unemployment rate.\nGDP\nOne might posit that GDP is the determining variable that\ninfluences both the stock market and election outcomes, in\nwhich case the link we observe between the stock market\nand election outcomes is spurious. The data do not support\nthis causality, however, for two reasons.\nFirst, in line with the leading indicators literature (Mitchell\nmovement to be a far better predictor of GDP than GDP is of\nsimple correlation of .35 (p < 10-7) between contemporaneous\nlognormal yearly changes in both the DJIA and GDP. Yet,\nwhen lognormal yearly changes in the DJIA are used to pre-\ndict the subsequent year's lognormal movement in GDP, we\nobserve a significant beta weight of .25 (p < .0002), versus no\nrelationship at all ( = -.02, p = .81) when we use lognormal\nyearly changes in GDP to predict the subsequent year's log-\nnormal movement in the DJIA. Thus, GDP does not predict\nstock market movement, but--in accordance with socionomic\ntheory (Prechter, 1999)--the stock market predicts GDP.\nSecond, we find that GDP exhibits a weaker relationship\nto incumbents' election outcomes than we observe for the\nDJIA. We repeat all of the regression analyses for incumbent\ncandidates, applying the same procedures and time intervals\ndescribed in earlier sections, but use GDP--both nominal and\nreal--as the predictor variable. The resulting regression equa-\ntions are much weaker in predictive ability than those for the\nDJIA. For example, substituting the 3-year percentage change\nin nominal GDP for the DJIA to predict the incumbent's pop-\nular vote margin produces weaker relationships across the\nboard, including a reduced linear regression beta weight (.33\nas opposed to .57 for the DJIA) and a smaller Spearman's\nrank correlation (.27 vs. .59). Similar results occur when sub-\nstituting real GDP as the predictor ( = .47 vs. .57,  = .46 vs.\n.59). Although GDP continues to be a statistically significant\npredictor of reelection outcomes in several of the analyses,\nthe level of significance is weaker than that of the DJIA.\nWhen predicting the dichotomous criterion of election win/\n8 SAGE Open\nloss, neither real GDP nor nominal GDP emerges as a signifi-\ncant predictor in logistic regression.\nThese results lead to the conclusion that GDP alone is not as\nuseful as the stock market alone in predicting reelection out-\ncomes. It is still possible that both GDP and the stock market\ntogether predict election results, a scenario we take up shortly.\nInflation and Unemployment\nWe next apply the analyses described in the above section\nwhile using the PPI, a measure of inflation, as the predictor\nvariable in simple regression. Using the 3-year percentage\nchange in the PPI rather than the DJIA to predict an incum-\nFigure 1. Landslide elections and the DJIA\nNote: DJIA = Dow Jones Industrial Average and normalized predecessor averages; DJIA/PPI = DJIA divided by the Producer Price Index. Landslide victory\ndefined as 40% electoral vote margin or 10% popular vote margin; landslide loss defined as -20% electoral vote margin or -5% popular vote margin.\nStock data are from 1760 to 2004.The most recent year in which an incumbent ran for reelection was 2004; that election did not yield a landslide result.\nTable 4.

The unem-\nployment rate, with data available from 1940 to the present,\nfails to register as a significant predictor in the same simple\nregression analysis. It yields a beta weight of -.11 and\nSpearman's rho of -.18. Neither the PPI nor the unemploy-\nment rate is able to predict better than at chance levels with\nregard to overall election win/loss.\nThe results are consistent with the negative conclusions\nthough our study of the unemployment rate may be some-\nwhat affected by loss of power due to small sample size. In\nsum, these sets of analyses suggest that changes in unem-\nployment and inflation rates (as measured by the PPI) in the\n1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-year periods prior to elections have no dis-\ncernible relationship to presidential reelection outcomes.\nMultiple Predictors\nAll of our analyses up to this point have used single predic-\ntors. We now investigate multiple predictors to allow for\npossible increases in predictive efficacy arising from vari-\nable covariations (suppressor effects, variable interactions,\netc.). To identify any combinations of indicators that may\noffer stronger predictive power, we repeat all of the analyses\ndescribed above using multiple regressions on various sets\nof predictor variables. We include the set that results from\nusing hierarchical regression to determine the variable entry\nsequence. We omit the unemployment rate due to an insuf-\nficient number of common data points.\nIn a large number of analyses, the DJIA remains the only\nsignificant predictor of election outcomes when combined\nwith nominal GDP, real GDP, and/or the inflation rate. With\npopular vote margin as the criterion, none of 11 combinations\nof various independent variables registers as a significant pre-\ndictor; the DJIA remains a significant predictor in all such\ncombinations. A similar pattern of results arises in conducting\nnonparametric analyses of these variables. With election win/\nloss as the criterion, every combination of variables again fails\nto register as a significant predictor, whereas the DJIAachieves\nstatistical significance in all such combinations.\nTo address the possibility that our statistically significant\nresults may simply be an outcome of performing a large\nnumber of tests, we conduct an omnibus Simes' test for mul-\ntiple comparisons, where the complete null states that the\nDJIA is unrelated to election outcomes. Requiring a family-\nwise error rate of .05, and pooling in all the p-values reported\nin Tables 1 to 3, we find that the complete null stands\nrejected. Our findings indicate that none of the alternative\nmeasures we test are as powerful as the stock market in pre-\ndicting U.S. presidential reelection outcomes.\nDiscussion\nIn summary, we find that the stock market's performance\nprior to a U.S. presidential election is a significant predictor\nof an incumbent's reelection success. Our results are robust\nto variations in the independent variable (nominal returns in\nthe DJIA vs. lognormal returns, and data durations of 1, 2, 3,\nand 4 years), variations in the dependent variable (popular\nvote margins, electoral vote margins, and a categorical win/\nloss measure), statistical methods used, and the presence of\nintervening variables. Generally, incumbents who preside\nover a net advance in the stock market tend to obtain a\nhigher vote margin than incumbents who preside over a net\ndecline in the stock market in the 1, 2, 3, and 4 years before\nthe election. Of all the variations we test, the relationship\nbetween the 3-year net percentage change in the DJIA and\nthe incumbent's popular vote margin is the strongest and\nachieves the highest level of significance. Large stock mar-\nket advances during the final 3 years of incumbent candi-\ndates' terms tend to be strongly associated with subsequent\nlandslide victories, as opposed to landslide defeats, for\nincumbents in their reelection bids. Conversely, large stock\nmarket declines during the final 3 years of incumbent candi-\ndates' terms tend to be strongly associated with subsequent\nlandslide defeats, as opposed to landslide victories, for\nincumbents in their reelection bids. The significant relation-\nships between stock market changes and election results do\nnot extend to the incumbent's party during elections that\nfeature no incumbent candidate. This difference suggests\nthat voting behavior changes depending on whether the elec-\ntion includes an incumbent.\nWe find no significant relationship between the success\nof reelection bids and prior net percentage change in infla-\ntion (as measured by the PPI) or unemployment. GDP-based\nsimple regressions are sometimes significant but always\nweaker than comparable regressions based on the stock mar-\nket. The stock market remains a significant predictor of the\noutcome of incumbents' reelection bids when considered\nwith combinations of the aforementioned macroeconomic\nvariables in multiple regression analyses. The importance of\nthese other variables remains relatively weak or insignificant\nwhen examined in combination with the stock market.\nAs a proposed hidden variable, social mood cannot be\ntested directly or proven as a voting motivator in these analy-\nses. It is possible that other hidden variables may contribute\nto or account for our findings. Nevertheless, our results are\nconsistent with the predictions made under the theory that\nmotivated the study while being substantially contrary to\neconomic voting perspectives, a topic we explore next.\nIs the Stock Market Per Se a Causal Factor in\nReelection Results?\nHow can we ascertain whether it is more likely changes in\nsocial mood--rather than changes in the stock market per\nse--that influence reelection outcomes? We now consider\nother economic voting arguments that may account for our\nfindings. For example, from the idea of egotropic voting,\none could argue that grateful stockholders--people who\nmade money in the stock market--would credit the incum-\nbent for their financial success and vote accordingly,\nwhereas those losing money in the market would reject the\nincumbent (see, for example, Chan & Jordan, 2004).\nAnother potential explanation might be a variation on the\nidea of sociotropic voting, in which presumably \"voters are\ninfluenced by their subjective views of the national economy\neven though they are not much swayed by their personal\neconomic standing\" (Erikson, 2004, p. 1). Perhaps voters,\nwhether they own stock or not, watch the stock market and\nvote accordingly for the well-being of society.\nThe grateful (or ungrateful) stockholder explanation seems\nuntenable given that the data for GDP, PPI, and unemploy-\nment fail to support egotropic hypotheses of \"grateful economic\nparticipants,\" \"grateful savers,\" or \"grateful employees.\" This\nproblem for such an explanation seems doubly serious given\nthat economic participants, savers, and employees have\nalways outnumbered stockholders, usually substantially. We\nare unaware of any reason why sociotropic voters' basis for\njudging social well-being should be the stock market averages\nin lieu of these other variables.\nA cursory statistical analysis, moreover, substantially\ninvalidates the grateful stockholder explanation. Data\ncovering more than 100 years show that increased stock\nownership within the population does not positively influ-\nence the relationship between stock market movement and\nincumbents' performance in reelection bids. A rigorous test\nof the grateful stockholder explanation--of gain or loss in\nstocks per se as a possible lurking variable--is confounded\nby the lack of compatible data. (Available stock market\ndata, election data, and stock ownership data cover different\ntime periods; historical stock ownership data tend to be spo-\nradic; and election data featuring incumbents are available\nfewer times than once every 4 years.) We nonetheless devise\nsome simple tests. Stock ownership was likely negligible\nacross the national population prior to 1900, and indeed we\ncould find no robust data series; stock ownership from 1900\nhouseholds held stock (Investment Company Institute and\nthe Securities Industry Association, 2005). The grateful\nstockholder explanation would seem to require that the rela-\ntionship between the stock market and election outcomes\ndifference should be enough to reject the null hypothesis\nthat postulates no such difference. To test this idea, we con-\nduct multiple linear regression to predict election outcomes\nby stock market performance, time period (dichotomous\ninteraction of stock market performance by time period. The\ninteraction effects do not emerge as statistically significant,\nthus failing to support the grateful stockholder explanation.\nFurthermore, as we see in Table 1, the association between\nelection outcomes and stock market performance is stronger\nboth are significant. Thus, we can safely conclude that voter\nresponse to stock market gains/losses does not explain our\nresults.\nSocionomic theory encounters no such counterindications\nfrom the data. Its explanation holds: Voters in the aggregate\nare not responding to stock market changes, economic\nchanges, inflation rates, or the availability of jobs; nor are\nthey voting rationally for social improvement. Rather, they\nare voting in accordance with trends in social mood. An\nincreasingly positive social mood produces a rising stock\nmarket as well as votes for the incumbent, and an increas-\ningly negative social mood produces a falling stock market\nas well as votes against the incumbent, thus producing the\npositive relationship we observe. When no candidate in a\npresidential election is the recognized leader whom voters\nhave unconsciously credited or blamed for their mood, they\nappear to base their voting decisions substantially on other\nfactors.\nFuture Research and Practical Implications\nTheoretical assumptions can instill \"strong prior beliefs on\nquestion. Bias is especially strong against newer ideas,\nwhich in recent years have included the proposal of nonra-\ntionality in aggregate human behavior (Burnham, 2005,\npp. 41-52). One value of the socionomic hypothesis is that it\nprompted this investigation of a relationship between certain\ntypes of social variables, a tack that previous political\nresearchers' theoretical assumptions seem to have impeded\nthem from considering.\nWe did not set out to optimize a model for predicting elec-\ntions but to explore a theoretical point. Nevertheless, we\nhope our approach will open a new avenue for scholars who\nbuild models to predict election outcomes. Instead of assum-\ning that the economy is the primary mover of voting prefer-\nences, researchers may wish to begin investigating indicators\nof social mood as predictors of reelection outcomes and to\nreinterpret economic data as resulting from voters' moods\nrather than causing them.\nResearchers may also wish to explore some of the nuances\nthat our rigid statistical tests are unable to detect. For exam-\nple, George H.W. Bush lost his bid for reelection even though\nthe Dow was higher over the three years leading to Election\nDay. The broader Value Line Geometric Index, however, was\ndown 11% over the 3.1 years prior to Election Day. So,\nBush's landslide loss is not incompatible with socionomic\ntheory even though our tests scored it otherwise. Similar\nsubtleties attend other apparent departures from socionomic\nexpectations, but we have assiduously avoided data fitting to\ncapture such results. Also, distinguishing between bull mar-\nkets and bear market rallies reveals some informative\nnuances regarding incumbents' popularity and reelection\nchances. Future researchers may wish to investigate these\nconsiderations further. Future political studies might also\nexamine the relationship of social mood to the timing of new\ndictatorships, the frequency of political apologies, and out-\nbreaks of peace and war. Under a broader umbrella, we pro-\npose analyzing social mood as it relates to a wide variety of\nsocial activities, from instances of mass celebration or\ndestructive riot to trends in fads, fashions, and popular\nentertainment.\nOur results suggest a practical strategy for political par-\nties: Whenever one of a party's potential candidates is an\nincumbent who has served during a period of major mood\nsetback as indicated by a large net decline in the stock mar-\nket--in real or nominal terms--that party may increase its\nchance of retaining control of the presidency if it chooses to\nnominate a candidate other than the incumbent. Our findings\nalso may be of practical value to those who wish someday to\nseek the presidency: A newcomer's chance of success\nimproves when competing against an incumbent who has\nserved during a period of declining social mood. Likewise,\nan incumbent who has held office during a major setback in\nsocial mood may wish to consider declining to run for a sec-\nond term and await more favorable conditions to pursue the\npresidency again or retire from presidential politics to spend\nhard-earned political capital on other efforts.\nConclusion\nStock market performance relates significantly and posi-\ntively to the outcome of U.S. presidents' reelection bids.\nHypotheses of economic voting fail to account for our find-\nings. Our results, however, are consistent with Prechter's\nsocionomic theory, specifically that social mood, an inter-\nnally regulated psychological variable reflected in stock\nindexes, is more powerful than economic variables in moti-\nvating voting behavior whenever a leader faces reelection.\nOur work supports the inclusion of stock market perfor-\nmance in models that forecast the outcomes of reelection\nbids of U.S. presidents and, we hope, prompts further litera-\nture on socionomic voting.\n"
