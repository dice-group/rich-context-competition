Short-term\nand temporary postoperative cognitive dys-\nfunction (POCD) may occur although\nPOCD may also continue beyond 7 days.5,6\nModerate levels of sedoanalgesia may\nimprove patient satisfaction and procedural\ncomfort and can be achieved through pre-\nmedication. The ideal premedication agent\nshould provide sedation and anxiolysis, and\nshould increase the quality of recovery and\nmaintenance.4 Midazolam and tramadol are\nshort-acting drugs that may be used as\npremedication. Data regarding oral admin-\nistration of tramadol in ERCP premedica-\ntion have not been published in English.\nFurthermore, studies evaluating the effect of\npremedication on cognitive function in the\nearly period after outpatient ERCP are also\nlacking.\nThe current study aimed to determine the\nsedative and analgesic contributions of\npremedication with oral midazolam or tra-\nmadol and the effects on early period cog-\nnitive function in patients undergoing\nelective ERCP under controlled remifentanil\nanaesthesia.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population [B-heading]\nelective ERCP in the Endoscopy Unit of the\nGastroenterology Department, Karadeniz\nTechnical University Medical Facility,\nhaving American Society of Anesthesiology\n(ASA) risk status I\u00adIII were enrolled in the\ncurrent study. Patients were excluded if they\nwere classified as having an ASA status\nof > III, morbid obesity, major organ dys-\nfunction (respiratory, renal and hepatic),\nhistory of drug addiction, known hypersen-\nsitivity for tramadol, midazolam or remifen-\ntanil, or a mini-mental test (MMT)\nThe study was registered with the Clinical\nTrials.gov protocol registration system\nInstitutional Ethics Committee of Karadeniz\nAll patients participating in the study pro-\nvided written informed consent.\nStudy procedures [B-heading]\nAt 45 min prior to the start of the ECRP\nprocedure, patients were taken to the\npreoperative preparation room of the\nEndoscopy Department. Vital signs includ-\ning blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral\noxygen saturation and respiration rate\nSystems, Milwaukee, WI, USA), Bispectral\nindex (BIS; BIS-XP Quatre, AspectTM\nMedical Systems, St Newton, MA, USA),\nmodified Ramsey Sedation Scale (mRSS)\nscore and pain score (numeric rating scale\n(NRS), 0\u00ad10) were recorded at baseline in all\npatients by the same researcher (HU) who\nwas unaware of the study drug. Target\nscores for effective sedation were defined\nPatients were randomized by closed-\nenvelope method to receive 0.15 mg/kg mid-\nazolam (Dormicum\u00d5, Roche Mu\n\u00a8 stahzarlari\n\u00b8., Istanbul, Turkey) (group M) or 1 mg/\nkg tramadol (Contramal\u00d5, Abdi Ibrahim\nIlac\n\u00b8 San., Istanbul, Turkey) (group T)\nadministered orally in 10 ml of cherry juice\nwithout particles.\nPatients were moved to the endoscopy\nunit 30 min after administration of pre-\nmedication. Nasal cannula were inserted to\nbe maintained throughout the whole pro-\ncedure and started with 4 l/dk O2\n. With\npatients in the lateral decubitus position,\nanalgesia and sedation at adequate depth\nwas achieved during ERCP using 1 mg/kg\nremifentanil (Ultiva\u00d5 GlaxoSmithKline,\nIstanbul, Turkey) administered intraven-\nously via perfusor (Perfusor\u00d5 compact S,\nB/BRAUN, Melsungen, Germany) for\n5 min. Remifentanil was maintained at\n0.2 mg/kg per min throughout the procedure.\nIncomplete sedation was considered when\nuncontrolled movements, hypertension\n(increase of ! 40 mmHg from baseline sys-\ntolic blood pressure (SBP)), tachycardia\n(increase of ! 30% from baseline heart rate\nor ! 90 beats per min), BIS ! 90, or mRSS\nscore 2 were observed. In cases of incom-\nplete sedation, up to two further doses of\n1 mg midazolam were administered intra-\nvenously. If, despite additional midazolam,\nsedation was still inadequate (mRSS 2 or\nBIS ! 90), 0.5 mg/kg propofol was adminis-\ntered intravenously as a rescue sedative.\nOver sedation was defined as hypotension\n(20% decrease from baseline in SBP or\nSBP < 90 mmHg), bradycardia (heart rate-\n50 beats per min), development of\nbradypnea (respiration rate six per min),\noxygen desaturation (SpO2\nBIS 70, or mRSS score! 5. In the event of\nover sedation, remifentanil infusion was tem-\nporarily discontinued. Anaesthesia manage-\nment was carried out in all ERCP procedures\nby the same anaesthetist (IC) who was\nunaware of the premedication drug. ERCP\nprocedures were performed by the same\nendoscopist (MA) who was also blinded to\npremedication drug. During the process,\nhyoscine-N-butyl bromide (Buscopan\u00d5\n20mg/ml ampoule, Eczacibasi Drug\nCompany, Istanbul, Turkey), a smooth mus-\ncale anti-spasmolytic, was used to control\noddi sphincter spasm; the amount of hyoscine\nN-butylbromide used was recorded.\nPatients with a NRS score > 3 after entry\nto the recovery room post-ECRP received\n1 g paracetamol intravenous infusion\n(Perfalgan\u00d5, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Istanbul,\nTurkey). Aldrete scores were recorded at entry\nto the recovery unit and after 60min. Patients\nin whom ERCP was successfully completed or\nwho had undergone their final study\nevaluations (in the case of an unsuccessful\nprocedure), who did not experience any side\neffects, had a NRS score< 3 and who fulfilled\nrecovery criteria (modified Aldrete sedation\nscore ! 9), were discharged accompanied by a\nresponsible adult attendant.\nThe primary study endpoint was meas-\nurement of early period cognitive function;\nthe secondary endpoint was determination\nof sedative efficacy.\nPatient evaluations [B-heading]\nVital signs were automatically measured at\nprespecified time-points during ERCP and\nin the recovery unit as shown Table 1.\nSedation, agitation and pain levels were\nevaluated in terms of BIS, mRSS and NRS\nat various time-points before, during and\nafter the procedure as presented in Table 1.\nCognitive function was evaluated before\nadministration of premedication and 60 min\npost-ERCP using the MMT.7 The MMT is\nan 11-question measure that tests five areas\nof cognitive function: orientation (10\npoints), registration memory (three points),\nattention and calculation (five points), recall\n(three points) and language (nine points) for\na maximum score of 30 points. If MMT\nwere considered to be cognitively impaired;\na decrease of !2 in the total MMT score was\nconsidered as a decrease in cognitive\nAdequacy of patient sedation during\nECRP was evaluated using an endoscopist-\nstructured questionnaire administered after\ncompletion of the procedure. Endoscopist\nsatisfaction with adequacy of sedation was\nscored as: 0 \u00bc bad, 1 \u00bc medium, 2 \u00bc good\nand 3 \u00bc excellent. Patient satisfaction score\nwith sedation adequacy was also recorded\nbefore discharge as: 0 \u00bc bad, 1 \u00bc medium,\n2 \u00bc good and 3 \u00bc excellent. Simple question-\nnaires were used to gauge patient experience\nof endoscopy and endoscopist satisfaction\nbefore discharge. Although unvalidated,\nboth questionnaires were considered ade-\nquate for this pilot study.\nTotal remifentanil dose used during\nERCP, need for additional analgesics (use\nof paracetamol in patients with a NRS\nscore > 3), procedure success ratio (success-\nful: unsuccessful procedures), side effects of\ntreatment and patient preference for pre-\nmedication during next ERCP were also\nrecorded.\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 software, version 13.0.1 (SPSS Inc.,\nChicago, IL, USA). Variables were analysed\nusing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to\ndetermine if they were normally distributed.\nMeasurable data were compared between\ntreatment groups using Student's t- test for\nnormally distributed data and Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test for data not conforming to\na normal distribution. Differences between\ngroups over time were evaluated using\nrepeat measures variance analysis (post-hoc\npaired t-test) for normally distributed data\nand Freidman's test (post-hoc Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test) for non-normally distrib-\nuted data. 2-test was used to compare\nqualitative (nominal) and sequential\n(ordinal) data in the different groups.\nMeasurable data were presented as\nmean \u00c6 SD and qualitative and sequential\ndata as frequencies and percentages.

As a consequence, benzodi-\nazepines and analgesics are frequently used\nA limited number of studies have eval-\nuated premedication in ERCP and differing\nconclusions have been drawn regarding the\nsedative contributions of benzodiazepines.\nIn one study, 7.5 mg midazolam orally\n30 min prior to ERCP conducted under\npropofol sedation was shown to be asso-\nciated with a reduction in desaturation as a\nconsequence of a decreased need for propo-\nfol; in addition, a positive synergistic effect\nof both drugs was noted with respect to\nanxiolysis.13 Another study, however,\ndemonstrated that premedication using\n1 mg lorazepam orally in patients undergo-\ning ERCP had no advantage in decreasing\nsedative needs and increasing haemo-\ndynamic stability.14\nA previous randomized, double-blind,\nplacebo-controlled trial compared the seda-\ntive effects of oral premedication with 7.5 mg\nmidazolam with 150 mg clonidine adminis-\nTable 4.

No significant change was,\nhowever, observed in sedation scores.\nInconsistency may be detected between BIS\nand sedation scores but the reason for this is\nnot clear.15 In contrast, the present study\ndemonstrated a correlation between BIS\nvalues and sedation scores. The current\nstudy used similar midazolam doses to\nthose employed in the study by Paris\net al.15 but levels of sedation were lower.\nThis may be due to residual benzodiazepine\nsedative effects. In the previous randomized\nstudy in which the average surgery time was\nmore than 120 min, no residual sedative\neffect with respect to BIS values was\nobserved after 120 min in the PACU in\nmidazolam-treated subjects. No sedative\neffects were observed after 60 min in the\nPACU in both treatment groups in the\ncurrent study.\nTramadol is also used as premedication\nfor general anaesthesia and sedation\nalthough its use is not as widespread as\npreviously compared with midazolam as a\npaediatric premedication or in dental sur-\ngery.18 Use of tramadol premedication in\ngastroenterological procedures has been\ninvestigated although no follow-up assess-\nment of any sedation/analgesia scale was\nperformed.16 A previous placebo-controlled\nstudy demonstrated that tramadol pre-\nmedication (100 mg orally) significantly\ndecreased anxiety scores and analgesic\nneed in patients undergoing surgical extrac-\ntion of the mandibular third molar.17\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopan-\ncreatography is generally planned as an\nambulatory procedure. POCD is a relatively\nfrequent occurrence that may negatively\naffect recovery and discharge after out-\npatient interventions. It can be defined as a\n20% decrease in psychomotor test (e.g.\nDigit-Symbol-Substitution Test (DSST),\nTrieger Dot Test and MMT) scores from\npreoperative values.19 Therefore, it is\nimportant to consider the effects of drugs\nused in anaesthesia and premedication on\nPOCD. The incidence of POCD has been\nreported to range between 7% and 60%\ndepending on the patient groups or proced-\nure type investigated.20 Studies have shown\nthat cognitive function and psychomotor\nperformance decreased significantly after\nmonitored anaesthesia care and after gen-\neral anaesthesia when sedative drugs and/or\nanalgesics were used.21 Patient discharge is\nusually planned within 2\u00ad3 h following inter-\nventional and endoscopic procedures but\nthe effects of a medication on POCD plays\nan important role in determining when to\ndischarge a patient, particularly after with\nambulatory surgery with sedoanalgesia.\nFindings from the International Post-\nOperative Cognitive Dysfunction Study-1\ndemonstrated that rates of POCD were\n25.8% in the first week following surgery\nThe effects of premedication on post-\noperative cognitive function are investigated\nwhen patients are fully conscious using\nneuropsychological tests performed both\npre- and postprocedure.7 The MMT is one\nof the most frequently used tests in the\nevaluation of early postoperative cognitive\nfunction or psychomotor recovery quality,\nwith an MMT score of <25 regarded as\nindicating POCD at Day 1.7,22 Subtests (e.g.\ntendency, registration memory, attention\nand calculation, recall and language) help\nto evaluate different cognitive functions;\nanaesthetic agents especially have a negative\neffect on memory. A study in elderly patients\nundergoing cataract surgery demonstrated\nthat there was a correlation between deteri-\noration in postoperative memory\nperformance in Luria tests and the first\nbenzodiazepine dose.23 In studies performed\nin healthy subjects, it was suggested that\nmidazolam might be a key drug in the\ndevelopment of prolonged psychomotor\nand subjective impairment;21,24 impairment\nin hand-eye coordination was found to\ncontinue even at 75 min after administration\nof midazolam.21 Another study demon-\nstrated that 5 mg diazepam administered\nintravenously before gastrointestinal endos-\ncopy caused significant impairment in cog-\nnitive function compared with control\npatients in the early period (30 min), which\nwas independent of blood drug level, patient\nage and plasma albumin levels.25\nPreferred drugs for premedication prior\nto endoscopic procedures are those with\nshort-term effectiveness that contribute to\nsedation and/or analgesia but that do not\ndelay recovery. Some studies assert that\ndischarge is not delayed with benzodiazep-\nines in outpatient surgeries. In one evalu-\nation in elderly patients who underwent\ncataract surgery under local anaesthesia,\n0.049 mg/kg midazolam oral premedication\nprovided adequate sedation and cognitive\nfunctions were protected compared with\ncontrols.26 The authors of this study recom-\nmended midazolam premedication because\nno differences in numerical and verbal\nmemory and concentration tests were\nobserved during the early postoperative\nperiod (120 min) and it was well tolerated\nwith respect to vital findings.26 In another\nstudy, it was reported that the incidence of\ndeep sedation and desaturation increased\npreoperatively following premedication with\nintravenous midazolam premedication in\ngeriatric patients although mental and psy-\nchomotor recovery was not affected in the\nearly postoperative period (60 min and\nmidazolam (2 mg), fentanyl (50 mg) and/or\npropofol (35 mg) was administered to\nhealthy subjects, no clinically significant\npsychomotor impairment was observed at\nmeta-analysis of premedication studies that\ninvolved use of benzodiazepines for preven-\ntion of presurgery anxiety, no delay in\ndischarge time was observed; in some of\nthe included studies it was reported that\ndespite some minimal impairment in psy-\nchomotor function, this did not delay\nThere are few data available regarding\nthe postoperative cognitive effects of trama-\ndol used as premedication. In the limited\nnumber of studies in the literature, cognitive\nfunction was investigated in patients who\nwere received tramadol for postoperative\nanalgesia. In one study, it was shown that\npostoperative tramadol was an important\nrisk factor for POCD in patients aged >75\nyears who underwent major abdominal sur-\ngery.29 Results from another study that\nevaluated the performance side-effect profile\nof high and low dose oral tramadol (200 mg\nor 50 mg four-times daily) in subjects being\ntreated for opioid dependence, demon-\nstrated that lower doses of tramadol were\nwell tolerated in cognitive and psychomotor\ntests including DSST.30\nIn the present study, a decrease in total\nMMT score and all subcategories was\ndetermined in the midazolam group at\n60 min post-ERCP with respect to baseline,\nbut this did not reach statistical significance.\nAlthough there was a decrease in MMT\ntotal score in the tramadol group, no\ndecrease was observed in `memory' (recall)\nsubcategory. A significant impairment was\ndetermined in the recall subcategory in\npatients who received tramadol as pre-\nmedication compared with patients who\nreceived midazolam premedication.\nIn conclusion, premedication with mid-\nazolam in patients undergoing ERCP pro-\nvides more effective sedation compared with\ntramadol premedication but is also asso-\nciated with in memory. With respect to\nPOCD, it was determined that cognitive\nfunction in the early postoperative period\nwas generally maintained and satisfying\nprocedure comfort was provided with both\ndrugs. While midazolam may be preferred\nfor premedication for ERCP due to more\neffective sedation, clinicians should be pre-\npared for dysfunction in the recall subcat-\negory of the MMT in the post-procedure\nperiod.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
