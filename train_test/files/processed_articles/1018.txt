    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: According to a national public opinion survey, Americans strongly support gov-\nernment solutions to help people with chronic conditions and their caregivers. Such solu-\ntions include a Medicare prescription drug benefit, a tax credit for caregivers, a tax break\nfor people who purchase private long-term care insurance, and public long-term care insur-\nance. A majority is willing to support several of these initiatives by paying higher taxes, but\nour survey suggests that other initiatives may not have sufficient support to offset their in-\ncremental costs. In addition, support for these proposals varies systematically by individual\ncharacteristics, which suggests that there are different constituencies for each proposal.\nAnumber of proposed health care reforms would have a major\nimpact on millions of Americans with chronic conditions and their care-\ngivers. In this paper we compare public support for four initiatives that\nhave received considerable policy attention in recent years: a Medicare prescrip-\ntion drug benefit, creation of public long-term care insurance, a tax break for un-\npaid caregivers, and a tax break for persons who purchase private long-term care\ninsurance.\nTo assess the level of support for each of these policies, we conducted a nation-\nally representative survey of Americans regarding their knowledge, attitudes, and\nperceptions of chronic conditions. One survey component asked respondents\nabout their level of support for each policy and their willingness to pay higher\ntaxes to enact it. We then compared willingness to pay with cost estimates of en-\nacting each initiative. The objectives of this paper are to (1) examine the overall level\nof support for each policy; (2) compare the public's willingness to pay higher taxes\nto enact each policy; and (3) compare the public's willingness to pay with the esti-\nmated cost of each program. We also attempt to determine the sociodemographic\nD a t a W a t c h\n\u00a92002 Project HOPE\u00adThe People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nMaeThamerisasenioranalystattheMedicarePaymentAdvisoryCommission.WenkeHwangisanassistant\nscientist,andGerardAndersonisaprofessorattheJohnsHopkinsBloombergSchoolofPublicHealth.Allauthors\nareaffiliatedwithPartnershipforSolutions:BetterLivesforPeoplewithChronicConditions,anationalprogram\noftheRobertWoodJohnsonFoundation.\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

A telephone survey consisting of fifty-one questions, requir-\ning approximately fifteen minutes to answer, was administered to a national ran-\nweighted according to age, sex, race, and level of education and income so that the\nsample would be representative of the U.S. public. All reported survey results have a\nsampling error of \u00b13 percent. Respondents were asked a series of questions in the\nfollowing three areas: (1) support for four specific policy initiatives; (2) willingness\nto pay $250 for each supported initiative; and (3) willingness to pay $500 for each.2\nn Demographic characteristics. The demographic characteristics of the survey\n62.8 percent had some college education; and 33.2 percent had annual incomes\npercent were caring for someone with a chronic condition, 14.1 percent both had a\nchronic condition and were caregivers, and 40.9 percent neither had a chronic con-\ndition nor were caregivers.\nCurrent Legislative Status And Cost Estimates\nn A new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Under current law, the Medicare\nprogram does not cover prescription drugs provided outside of the hospital. To esti-\nmate the costs of developing a Medicare prescription drug benefit, the Congressio-\nnal Budget Office (CBO) assumed a base case for a benefit that would provide cover-\nage for all outpatient drug costs of Medicare enrollees, whereby the federal\ngovernment would pay 50 percent of premiums, beneficiaries would pay 50 percent\ncoinsurance, and stop-loss protection would be provided after $4,000 in out-of-\npocket spending.3 This base case would cost the federal government an estimated\n$31.6 billion in 2004. Using various options that change beneficiaries' cost sharing,\nthe stop-loss amount, the cap, and combinations of these, the CBO estimated a range\nof $21.4 billion\u00ad$42.0 billion in annual costs to cover the costs of a Medicare drug\nbenefit.\nn Government-funded long-term care insurance. Long-term care--which in-\ncludes skilled nursing facility (SNF) and other facility-based care, home health care,\nhome and community-based waiver services, and personal care--is now financed\nthrough a wide mix of public and private sources. Public financing, which funds 62\npercent of all services, comes from Medicaid, Medicare, state programs, the Depart-\nment of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Administration on Aging. Private financing\nincludes private insurance, philanthropy, and out-of-pocket payments. The CBO es-\ntimated that more than $120 billion was spent on long-term care for the elderly\nalone in 1999.4 In our analysis we assume that all $120 billion would be paid by pub-\nlic sources or an increment of $46 billion in public spending ($120 billion \u00b4 0.38).\nn Tax break for unpaid caregivers.

This means-\ntested tax credit was estimated to cost $5.5 billion over five years by President\nClinton's 1998 Long-Term Care Initiative.\nn Tax break for purchasers of long-term care insurance. The Health Care In-\nsurance Act of 2001 (S.B. 24) seeks to provide a tax credit for qualified long-term\ncare premiums. Although there are no current estimates for the cost of a tax break\nfor persons who purchase long-term care insurance, given the approximately 6 per-\ncent of the adult population who purchase such insurance (twelve million persons)\nbillion a year.6 This is without assuming any increase in the number of subscribers\nbecause of the tax credit.\nSupport For Policy Initiatives And Willingness To Pay\nAccording to our survey results, Americans overwhelmingly support policy ini-\ntiatives that would help persons with chronic conditions (Exhibit 1). Between\none-half and three-quarters of survey respondents \"strongly\" supported each of\nthese four initiatives. These are the data that are usually reported in the media and\nused to influence public policy. However, when issues of financing these initia-\ntives are introduced, the results and relative rankings can change.\nWillingness to pay has been widely used as a way to measure the demand for\nbenefits in health and health care.7 It has also been used in other public policy ar-\neas such as clean air and water, less congestion on roads, and other services for\nwhich a private market does not exist.8\nOnce the possibility of higher taxes was introduced in our survey, the level of\nsupport for all four options declined (Exhibit 2).9 Of respondents who had re-\nported strong support for a specific policy, 9\u00ad13 percent were unwilling to pay a\nminimum of $250 in additional taxes for that policy. Still, a majority of respon-\nD a t a W a t c h\nAmericans' Support For Policy Initiatives Related To Chronic Conditions, 2000\nPolicy initiative Strongly support Somewhat support\nDrug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries\nGovernment-funded long-term care insurance\nTax break for persons who provide unpaid care\nTax break for persons who purchase long-term care insurance\nSOURCE: Johns Hopkins University/Robert Wood Johnson Foundation/Harris Interactive Survey on Chronic Illness in the United\nNOTE: Each respondent was asked the following question: \"I'm going to read you a list of proposed health reforms that might\nbe passed by Congress.

On the\nother hand, while half of respondents strongly supported a tax break for the pur-\nchase of private long-term care insurance, only 37 percent were willing to pay an\nadditional $250 or more in taxes to finance this policy. None of the four proposals\nobtained a majority of supporters if it involved an additional $500 in taxes.\nCost Versus Level Of Support\nn Medicare drug benefit. Almost two-thirds of respondents were willing to\npay $250 or more to support a new Medicare prescription drug benefit, the equiva-\nlent of $25 billion annually. According to the CBO, the estimated cost to taxpayers\nof adding this benefit to Medicare, using different cost-sharing mechanisms, is in\nn Long-term care insurance. Almost 60 percent of respondents expressed the\nwillingness to pay $250 or more to support government-funded long-term care in-\nsurance. Given this level of support, approximately $25 billion could be available for\nthis benefit expansion. However, according to the CBO estimates, government costs\nfor providing long-term care insurance for the elderly alone in 1999 were more than\n$120 billion. Because the public sector now supports 62 percent of the cost for the\nelderly, the incremental cost of providing long-term care insurance for the elderly\nwould be at least $46 billion, and even greater if demand for long-term care services\nincreases. Given this estimate, the public does not appear to be willing to fully fund\nthe incremental cost of public long-term care insurance.\nn Caregiver tax break. More than half of respondents said that they would be\nwilling to pay at least $250 to support a tax break for persons who provide unpaid\ncare to family members or friends.

The\nproposal introduced in 1998 estimated spending $5.5 billion over five years for such\nan initiative.11 The public, therefore, appears to be willing to pay a far greater amount\nto support caregivers than what this initiative would cost.\nn Tax break for long-term care insurance purchasers. Finally, only 37 percent\nof respondents would be willing to pay $250 in additional taxes to support a tax\nbreak for persons who purchase long-term care insurance. As stated before, this pro-\nposal would cost an estimated $12 billion\u00ad$36 billion.12 Our survey suggests that\nonly a scant majority of Americans strongly support this option, before any higher\ntaxes to support this option are discussed. Once the possibility of higher taxes is in-\ntroduced, support erodes considerably.\nCharacteristics Of Supporters For Each Policy Initiative\nTo determine the characteristics of the U.S. population that support each spe-\ncific health policy, we conducted logistic regressions for each policy using three\nmodels. The three models differed in the dependent variable selected: Model 1 ex-\namined the likelihood of supporting versus not supporting each policy; Model 2\nexamined the likelihood of supporting each policy by indicating willingness to\npay a minimum of $250 versus not supporting each policy by paying extra taxes;\nand Model 3 examined the likelihood of being willing to pay $500 to support each\npolicy versus not supporting that policy at all. Model 1 identifies general public\nsupport, Model 2 identifies the public's willingness to pay, and Model 3 shows the\ngreatest support for the policy. In all three models the independent variables were\nsex, age, race, educational status, and association with chronic conditions.13\nn Strongest supporters. In general, women, blacks, and caregivers were the\nstrongest supporters of each of the four policies. Educational level did not appear to\nbe correlated with support of any policy. Age as a predictor depended on the specific\npolicy. Persons ages 45\u00ad64 were the strongest supporters of a tax break for purchas-\ners of private long-term care insurance and for caregivers.\nn Least likely to support. Surprisingly, persons age sixty-five and older were\nleast likely to support government-funded long-term care insurance and a new\nMedicare drug benefit. Although this result may appear to be counterintuitive, a\n1998 survey reported the following similar findings: Only 58 percent of persons age\nsixty-five and older favored a proposal to improve Medicare by covering prescrip-\ntion drugs, compared with 71 percent of persons under age sixty-five; and only 64\npercent of elderly respondents supported Medicare coverage of long-term nursing\nhome care, compared with 70 percent of persons under age sixty-five.14\nn Possible explanations. There are several possible explanations for the\nD a t a W a t c h\n\"Persons age sixty-five and older were least likely to support\npublic long-term care insurance and a Medicare drug benefit.\"\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

First, 73 percent of Medicare benefi-\nciaries already have prescription drug coverage.15 Second, according to the 1998 sur-\nvey, the elderly were somewhat more likely than their younger counterparts were to\nrate keeping taxes down as a \"very important\" issue (70 percent versus 66 percent)\nand therefore may be less amenable to any changes in Medicare that might require\nadditional taxes. Third, the elderly were much more likely than their younger coun-\nterparts were to report that Medicare is doing a \"good job\" in serving health care\nconsumers (74 percent versus 44 percent), and therefore the elderly may be less\nlikely to desire major changes in the program. Similarly, persons under age sixty-five\nwere more likely to report that Medicare's benefits are \"less generous\" than are those\nof most private health insurance plans (35 percent versus 21 percent of elderly re-\nspondents). Some or all of these factors could explain this unexpected finding.\nSince the time of the survey (March\u00adNovember 2000), the economy and the\ngovernment's budgetary situation have deteriorated, and the policy agenda has\nbeen radically revised. Public support for specific alternatives may have shifted\nduring this period. We also recognize that public opinion is only one factor that\ninfluences public policy. Finally, we note that public opinion can change rapidly,\nas demonstrated by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act passage and its re-\npeal only a year later.\nAlthough numerous surveys have asked Americans about their sup-\nport for a number of health-related policies, this is the first survey to focus\non the public's willingness to pay for specific proposals related to caring for\npeople with chronic conditions. There appears to be support for prescription drug\ncoverage at the level now being discussed in Congress, a willingness to fund tax\ncredits for persons who provide unpaid care at a higher level than the proposed\ncost, and an unwillingness to pay for an expansion of government-funded or pri-\nvate long-term care insurance at the proposed cost.\nThisanalysiswasfundedbyPartnershipforSolutions,anationalprogramoftheRobertWoodJohnson\nFoundation.\nNOTES\n1. The survey was conducted by Harris Interactive. Participating households were identified using\nrandom-digit-dialing procedures for U.S. telephone numbers. Efforts were made to increase the response\nrate and to encourage participation. Specially trained interviewers called back people who had initially re-\nfused to participate and offered them a financial incentive ($15) for their participation. The adult with the\nmost recent birthday in the household was identified and asked to participate. Eligibility was limited to\nEnglish and Spanish speakers. A total of 2,970 persons were contacted, and 1,663 completed the survey.\nThe response rate of 56 percent was calculated as the percentage of eligible households for which an inter-\nview was completed.\n2.

For each, please indicate if you would strongly support it, somewhat sup-\nport it, somewhat oppose it, or strongly oppose it.\" Only those respondents who reported strong support\nfor each initiative were further queried, \"How willing are you to support [each specific initiative] if it\nmeant a $250 increase in your taxes?

Willingness to pay is a survey-based method to determine monetary valuation of interventions that can-\nnot be examined in the marketplace. Formal methodological analysis and validity testing of willingness to\npay has not been fully established. The limited published literature has shown some evidence that an\nopen-ended form of monetary valuation and dichotomous choice survey questions may overestimate ac-\ntual willingness to pay. See B. Liljas and K. Blumenschein, \"On Hypothetical Bias and Calibration in\nsus Real Willingness to Pay in the Health Care Sector: Results from a Field Experiment,\" Health Economics\nasked respondents the level of their support. The survey questions were asked in a hierarchical fash-\nion-that is, only the respondents who said that they supported the policy option were asked the $250\nwillingness-to-pay question, and so forth. This approach may reduce the impact of willingness-to-pay re-\nsponses that clearly are not possible.\n9. Given the recent focus on a tax cut, respondents might have felt differently and reported higher levels of fi-\nnancial support if the survey had discussed a reduced tax cut in return for benefits versus a tax increase in\nreturn for benefits. Willingness-to-pay questionnaires have been shown to be sensitive to how the ques-\ntions are worded and whether a reduction or an increase is proposed.\n11.

In the survey, a special screener was developed to identify respondents with a chronic condition or who\nwere caregivers for someone with a chronic condition, or both. Respondents were asked if they had a con-\ndition that has lasted or was expected to last twelve months or more and if it placed limitations on any one\nof the following: (1) age-appropriate task performance, including school attendance for children and work\nfor adults; (2) basic self-care; or (3) independent-living skills necessary for community residence; or if the\ncondition required ongoing medical intervention. If a respondent answered yes to any of these questions,\nthey were deemed to have a chronic condition. The respondent was also queried as to whether he or she\ncurrently or in the past year acted as a caregiver. This was defined as anyone who provides unpaid help or\narranges for paid or unpaid help for a relative or friend because they have a chronic illness or because they\nare getting older.
