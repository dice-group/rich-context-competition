Such mechanisms\nclaim to reduce the information asymmetry between the issuers and investors.\nThe certifications that have a positive influence include investment banker reputa-\ntion, group or venture capital affiliation, association with financial institutions and\nanalyst coverage, among others. The positive influence is claimed to be greater in\nthe emerging markets, where frictions due to information asymmetry are relatively\ngreater compared to the developed markets. It is in this context that the Indian\nmarket regulator added a unique certification for IPOs in May 2007 by mandating\nthe grading of IPOs by an independent rating agency. It is expected to reduce the\ninformation asymmetry by providing comprehensive issue-related information to\nthe market, especially to the retail investors in an `easy-to-use' format. While the\ngrades make no comments on the issue pricing, they are expected to reflect the\nfundamental strength of the IPO.\nThe article empirically examines whether the introduction of grading has influenced\nthe demand and pricing efficiency of IPOs. The approach involves cross-sectional\nregressions of the measures of underpricing and demand as dependent variables\nwith a set of dependent variables to represent various firm, issue and market\ncharacteristics. The sample of graded IPOs used in the study has 182 issues during\nThe study does not find any significant impact of grading on IPO pricing or demand.\nGrading, which is expected to guide the retail investors, does not appear to influence\ntheir demand. While the grades appear to have an impact on the demand of the\ninstitutional investors, it has no influence on the IPO pricing efficiency. The graded\nissues, which are expected to have lower information asymmetry, do not have a\nrelatively lower underpricing compared to the ungraded issues. Further, we find\nthat the differences in the grading do not significantly explain the cross-sectional\ndifferences in market-adjusted underpricing. These results do not support any\nincremental certification role of IPO grading, as reported earlier by some studies\nwith a smaller sample.\nIPO Underpricing\nIPO Grading\nIPO Certification\nEmerging Markets\nVIKALPA\nThe Journal for Decision Makers\nManagement, Ahmedabad\nSAGE Publications\nsagepub.in/home.nav\nhttp://vik.sagepub.com\nThe Indian stock market regulator, the Securities\nand Exchange Board of India (SEBI), mandated\nthe grading of all initial public offerings (IPOs)\nGrading is a feature exclusive to IPOs in India.\nAccording to SEBI, `The grade represents an assess-\nment of the fundamentals of that issue relative to the\nother listed equities in India.'2 It is expected to provide\nincremental, readily interpretable and independent\ninformation about an IPO to investors and, thus, help\nthem better assess its investment potential.\nThe expected positive role of IPO grading appears\nto be theoretically linked to two different strands of\nevidence. First, it is well known that the IPO market\nfaces significant information asymmetry. Several IPO\nunderpricing models use information asymmetry as\nthe key explanatory factor (e.g., Benveniste & Spindt,\nleading to higher underpricing. Accordingly, firms\nattempt to reduce underpricing through credible\nsignalling of their true quality. The employed signalling\nmechanisms include (a) underwriter's reputation,\n(b) the presence of venture capitalists in the pre-issue\nfunding, (c) group affiliation, (d) the quality of the\nboard of directors and (e) credit rating, among others.\nThese are found to have some degree of positive\nimpact on the pricing efficiency of IPOs. For instance,\nassociation with venture capitalists (Barry, Muscarella,\nand underwriter reputation (Carter & Manaster, 1990)\nare found to reduce underpricing. Credit rating, a\ncertification mechanism very close to IPO grading, is\nalso reported to reduce underpricing in the US market\n(An & Chan, 2008). Second, there is evidence that\nindividual investors often fail to objectively assess\nIPOs, as they suffer from behavioural biases (e.g.,\nLjungqvist, Nanda & Singh, 2006). Grading could help\nthem to make a more objective judgement, as it claims\nto compress the various issue-related information into\nan `easy-to-use' symbol. These suggest that the impact\nof grading on IPO bidding and pricing could largely\ndepend on the degree to which the rational investors\nregard grades as a unique source of incremental price-\nrelevant information. If indeed, grading provides\nunique, unbiased and more accurate issue information,\nit could positively impact the demand for high-quality\nIPOs and improve the pricing efficiency of IPOs.\nThe introduction of mandatory grading, however,\nwas not uniformly welcomed in the Indian market\non the following grounds. First, it was contended that\ninvestors who are unable to understand and analyse the\nissue information would also be unable to understand\nthe meaning of grades. A popular financial daily\nwrote, `Indeed, assigning grades to new issues can lull\ninvestors into a false sense of security about the risks\nand rewards of equity investing and can make equity\nlook safer than it is' (The Economic Times, 2007). Second,\nthere were concerns whether the rating agencies would\nhave enough incentives to strive for objective grades.\nWhile the reputation of a credit rating agency could be\nverified with the actual defaults of debt securities, it\nwould be difficult to ascertain the truthfulness of IPO\ngrades due to the volatile nature of equity cash flows.\nThird, the investment banking community maintained\nthat grading would increase the issue costs. Fourth,\nanalysts asserted that without a comment on the issue\nprice, IPO grading had very little relevance. On the\ncontrary, retail investors generally welcomed the idea\nof IPO grading. They possibly felt that grading would\nreduce their dependence on issue advertisements\nand brokers. However, they demanded that the issue\npricing be also brought into the scope of grading.\nThe available evidence on the impact of IPO grading\npresents conflicting evidence on its role. While Deb and\nMarisetty (2010), one of the earliest studies on grading,\nfound that the IPOs after the introduction of grading\nwere associated with lower underpricing, Khurshed,\nPaleari,Pande,andVismara(2011)foundnosuchrolefor\ngrading in underpricing. Further, Khurshed et al. (2011),\nwith a larger sample, found no support for the two key\nfindings of Deb and Marisetty (2010): (i) the high-grade\nissues are associated with better IPO pricing and (ii)\nretail investors respond to IPO grading with increased\nsubscription of the high-grade issues. Khurshed et\nal. (2011), instead, argued that grading positively\ninfluenced the subscription pattern of the institutional\ninvestors, which, in turn, positively impacted the retail\nsubscription. This close link between the institutional\nand retail investors' demands was attributed to the\nevidence of retail investors following the institutional\ninvestors' bids, which was possible due to the high\ntransparency of book building in India. However, the\nsubmission of bids by the retail investors towards the\nend of the bidding window significantly improves their\nability to assess the probability of receiving an allotment.\nSuch an assessment also helps them to reduce the\nopportunity cost of funds underlying the application.\nThis behaviour would be more salient during the hot\nIPO periods due to greater subscription levels and the\navailability of more investment opportunities. These\nmotives of the retail investors imply that `the retail\ndemand following the institutional demand' cannot be\nfully attributed to the information asymmetry faced by\nthe former. It is somewhat surprising that IPO grades\ninfluence the demand of the relatively more informed\ninstitutional investors rather than that of the individual\ninvestors. If the institutional demand is influenced by\nthe IPO grade, then it is critical to examine whether\nit necessarily improves the pricing efficiency in a\nmarket like India, where institutions dominate price\ndiscovery and the market demand. The results of Deb\nand Marisetty (2010) may be partly attributed to their\nrelatively small sample of graded issues from a cold\nmarket period, as they did not control for the market\nconditions. Overall, the available research on the IPO\ngrading leaves a number of important questions not\nadequately addressed. This article is a modest attempt to\nresolve some of the contentious findings on the impact\nof IPO grading, given its status as a unique certification.\nThe results suggest that grading has not significantly\nimpacted the pricing of IPOs in India. While\nthe institutional demand for IPOs seems to be\ninfluenced by the IPO grades, it does not have any\nsignificant impact on the retail demand, once the\npossible influence of the demand of institutional\ninvestors is accounted for. No significant change is\nobserved in the bidding approach of retail investors\nafter the introduction of grading. For institutions,\nthe low-grade IPOs appear to have weaker demand\nand IPOs with high grades experience stronger\ndemand. These findings together tend to suggest that\nthe IPO grading as a certification mechanism has\nnot performed its expected role to a great extent. It is\nperhaps difficult to assign reliable IPO grades due to\nthe volatile nature of the equity cash flows. Further,\nthe transparency of book building in India affords\nretail bidders to learn from the real-time demand\nschedule of the institutional investors. This could\nalso make IPO grading redundant for the retail\ncategory demand. The failure of IPO grading needs\nto be examined at a deeper level.\nImportant Features\nIPO grades are assigned on a five-point scale. The\nlowest grade (Grade 1) denotes poor issue fundamen-\ntals and the highest grade (Grade 5) denotes strong\nfundamentals, relative to that of the listed firms in India.\nThe grade is expected to only reflect the various issue\nfundamentals such as the industry prospects, firm's\nfinancial position, the quality of its management and\ngovernance, risks and prospects of its new projects and\nthe firm's regulatory compliance. It does not take the\nissue pricing into account and, thus, does not constitute\nan assessment of the fairness of the IPO price.\nThe rating agency is expected to use the information\ndisclosed by the issuer and that obtained from other\nsources. An issuer dissatisfied with the grade assigned\nby one agency can approach another. However, the\nissuer is bound to disclose all the assigned ratings.\nThe IPO grade along with the rationale given by the\nagency has to be displayed in every advertisement\nof the issue, including the issue prospectus and the\nabridged prospectus. The rating rationale is expected\nto detail the key findings and conclusions about the\nvarious aspects considered in assigning the grade.3 The\nred herring prospectus must carry the IPO grade. The\ncost of the grading is borne by the issuer, which could\nlead to conflicts of interest in IPO grading as reported\nin credit rating (e.g., Smith &Walter, 2001).\nTestable Hypotheses\nThe nature of IPO grading suggests that it can be\nregarded as an additional certification of the IPO\nfundamentals. This approach had been adopted by\nthe earlier articles on this issue (Deb & Marisetty, 2010;\nKhurshed et al., 2011). Based on the literature on infor-\nmation asymmetry and the role of certification in IPO\npricing, we hypothesize the following impacts in the\nIPO market with the introduction of grading.\nFirst, if grading performs its expected role as a certifi-\ncation, it is reasonable to expect that the more informed\ninstitutional investors (qualified institutional buyers\n[QIBs] hereafter) would be less reliant on the IPO\ngrades in their bidding compared to the retail investors,\nas they have greater access to information and better\nanalytical skills. The retail investors, on the contrary,\nare more likely to use the IPO grades. Hence, we expect\na varying level of influence of grading on the retail and\ninstitutional demand.\nSecond, if the IPO grade provides incremental,\nprice-relevant information and summarises the bulky\npublic information into an easy-to-use form, it could\npotentially improve the IPO pricing efficiency. This is\nexpected as the IPO grading could potentially improve\nthe information quality and reduce the informa-\ntion asymmetry in the market. Both these outcomes\nare claimed to reduce IPO underpricing over time.\nLjungqvist (2004) provided a detailed discussion on\nthese issues. Further, if the grading reduces information\nasymmetry, then it could nudge the pricing of all IPOs\ntowards their respective fair price in a rational market,\nand all issues, irrespective of their grades, should have\nsimilar levels of risk-adjusted underpricing. This could\nreduce the cross-sectional variation of underpricing\nwith the introduction of grading.\nThird, by acting as a certification mechanism, if grading\nhelps to reduce underpricing, then its role would\npossibly be more evident in the case of the relatively\nsmall firms and firms belonging to relatively nascent\nindustries, as these firms are documented to suffer\nfrom greater information asymmetry.\nMethodology\nThe possible influence of IPO grading on the demand\nfor issues from various investor categories is examined\nwith cross-sectional regressions. The regressions take\nthe following form:\ni i i i\n= + + +\n   \n .\nGRADE\nwhere N T S\ni\nis the number of times IPO i is subscribed\nby an investor category (retail or QIB), and X\ni\nis a set\nof variables to reflect the firm and issue characteristics,\nand market conditions around the time of the issue (as\nexplained later in this section).\nD\nGRADE\nrepresents a dummy variable to reflect the issue\ngrade. The economic and statistical significance of the\ngrade-related dummy would indicate the influence of\ngrade on the demand for IPOs.\nThe impact of grading on IPO pricing efficiency is\nexamined with the following cross-sectional regression\ninvolving net underpricing as the dependent variable.\nThe independent variables reflect the key firm, issue\nand market characteristics along with categorical varia-\nbles to reflect the grades:\nU P X D n\ni i i i\n= + + +\n \n \n. .\nGRADE\nwhere U P\ni\nis the market-adjusted return on IPO of\nstock i defined as below:\ni\n= -\nListingdayclosing price\nIssueprice\nMarketreturn from issue\nedatetolisti\nThe market return is proxied by the return on Sensex,\none of the most popular equity indices in India.\nPrimarily, the regressions examine whether the grade,\nwhich is expected to convey the issue characteristics,\nhas any direct influence on the pricing efficiency.\nThe independent variables (X\ni\n) included in the above\nregressions attempt to capture the ex-ante information\nasymmetry surrounding an IPO, as the underpricing\nand issue demand are believed to reflect the informa-\ntion asymmetry. The issue and firm size are widely\nbelieved to proxy for investors' ex-ante uncertainty. The\nlength of the history of a firm's operating performance\n(age) is another proxy usually employed to capture the\ndegree of information asymmetry (for a discussion on\nthese proxies, refer to Ljungqvist, 2004). The extent of\nownership retained by the promoter is found to offer\nsome explanation for underpricing. As the informa-\ntion asymmetry surrounding different industries could\nsignificantly vary, the regressions also control for the\nindustry effects, as often employed in the empirical\nanalysis of IPO underpricing. The study also controls for\nthe clustering of IPOs, which is believed to significantly\ninfluence the demand and underpricing of issues (e.g.,\nHelwege & Liang, 2004). The definitions of the variables\nemployed in the regressions are summarised in Table 1.\nData\nThe IPO-related data are taken from the Prime database\nand the firm-level financial data from the CMIE Prowess\ndatabase. The sample comprises all the 352 IPOs over\nthe 6-year period between October 2005 and September\n2011. One of the IPOs is removed from the sample due\nto the unavailability of its post-listing price. IPOs before\nOctober 2005 are not included in the sample primarily\ndue to an important change in the book-building\nprocess--replacement of discretionary allocation\nMoreover, the Indian IPO market has significantly\nevolved on many fronts, such as the institutional profile,\nissue pricing, allocation, disclosures and listing norms,\netc., in the last decade. These changes would make\ncomparison of the IPO pricing efficiency or bidding\npatterns over a long period of time unreliable in India.\ni\n= -\nListingdayclosing price\nIssueprice\nMarketreturn from issue\nedatetolisting.\nTable 1: Definitions of Independent Variables in the Regressions\nVariable Brief Description\nFirm-related variables:\nln (Size) Log of issue size of an IPO\nln (Assets) Log of the book value of the assets of\nthe issuer\nDE Pre-issue debt-to-equity ratio based on\nbook value\nRONW Pre-issue PAT/Net worth\nHolding Post-issue promoter holding/Total no. of\nshares\nAge No. of years since incorporation at the\ntime of IPO\nD (group) Dummy indicating whether firm is\naffiliated to a business group\nMarket-related variables:\nD (hot) Months with top 1/3 no. of issues are\nclassified as hot, otherwise cold\nAll-NTS No. of times subscribed by all investor\ncategories\nRetail-NTS No. of times subscribed by retail\ninvestors\nQIB-NTS No. of times subscribed by QIB investors\nIssue-related variables:\nD (grade) Dummy indicating whether the issue is\ngraded\nD(1), D(2), D(3) or D(4/5) Actual grade assigned to the issue used\nas a category (`Grade 4' and `Grade 5'\nare combined)\nD (bookbuilt) Dummy indicating whether the issue is\nbookbuilt\nNote: RONW: Return on net worth, PAT: Profit after tax.\nOverall Characteristics of the Sample\nA brief description of the sample IPOs is provided\nin Table 2. The sample represents a total issue size of\ncrore per year and about `387 crore per issue. The\nsample period corresponds to one of the most active\nphases for IPOs in India and accounts for nearly 79\nper cent of the issue volume and 84 per cent of the\nissue value during the decade ending September 2011.\nMost of the IPOs are offered through book-building\nmethod (88 per cent). The median of the overall\nsubscription of IPOs is about 5 times and the mean\nabout 17 times. This suggests that there are many\nhighly subscribed issues. For instance, eight IPOs are\nsubscribed more than 100 times. The category-wise\nsubscription also has many extremes. The retail has\nsubscribed three IPOs more than 100 times and the\nQIBs have crossed the `100 times' mark in as many\nas 16 issues. The mean subscription levels peaked in\n2007, which is also the peak IPO activity year. The\nsubscription level has significantly declined towards\n2011. Among the investor categories, the demand of\nthe QIBs appears to be greater than that of the retail\nfor most of the years.\nIt appears that there is clustering of IPO activity in\nIndia, as reported from other markets. The monthly\nissue volume, issue size and its three-monthly moving\naverage over the period are given in Figure 1. The\nand the maximum issue amount is in October 2010\nTable 2: Summary Statistics of IPOs\nIssue Size (` crore) No. of Issues Subscription Levels\nYear No. of\nTotal Average\nissue\nBook built Fixed\nprice\nGraded Avg. listing\ntime (days)\nMean overall Median\noverall\nMedian\nretail\nMedian\nQIB\nSource: Prepared by Authors.\nNote: The table gives the summary statistics of the sample of IPOs. Average listing time is the time between issue date and listing date.\nvoluntarily graded by the issuers (grading was optional till April 30, 2007).\nThere are no IPOs in 7 months out of the 73 covered\nby the data, and another 7 months have only one issue\nand 2011 appear to fit the description of a `hot phase' in\nthe Indian IPO market.\nGiven the apparent IPO clustering and the docu-\nmented evidence of the conditions on issue pricing,\nthe study attempts to control for market conditions\nin the regressions. Each month in our dataset is clas-\nsified as a `cold' or a `hot' month, based on the 3\nmonth centred moving average of the number of IPOs\nduring that month relative to the average number of\nIPOs during the period. The moving average takes\ncare of any seasonality in the issue of IPOs. The top\none-third months are classified as hot months and the\nremaining months as cold months. Out of the total\n73 months, 18 months are classified as hot months.5\nThere is a greater demand for IPOs during the hot\nperiod (median subscription about 10 times) rela-\ntive to the cold period (median subscription about\nBy the issue size, the IPOs appear to be concentrated\naround two sectors: power, and `construction and real\nestate'. These two industries together accounted for\nabout 47 per cent of the total issue size. By the number\nof issues, `construction and real estate' was the domi-\nnant industry, with about 16 per cent share of the IPOs.\nThe industry clustering suggests the need to control for\nindustry in the regressions.\nCharacteristics of the Graded IPOs\nThe final sample has 182 graded issues. The distribu-\ntion of the IPO grades and a brief profile of the graded\nissues are given in Tables 3 and 4, respectively. As\ngiven in Table 3, only about one-fifth of the graded\nIPOs have been assigned high grade (Grades 4 or 5)\nand about 12 per cent are graded at the lowest level\n(Grade 1). The lowest grade IPOs accounted for a\nlarge share of the IPOs during the year 2007. By the\nissue size, nearly 60 per cent of the IPOs are high\ngrade and only 1 per cent is in the lowest grade. This\nskewness could possibly be due to a link between firm\nsize and grades. Overall, the distribution of the grades\nsuggests no significant bunching in the IPO grades.\nIt appears that the issuers, who are larger, relatively\nlow-levered and have a greater return on equity, tend\nto receive the highest grading. This pattern could be\nexpected, as grading focuses solely on the fundamen-\ntals of the firm.\nIPO Volume Trend\nNo. of IPOs\nIPO Value Trend\nIssue Size (Rs. cr.)\nIssue Year Issue Year\n\u00ad No. of issues\n\u00ad\u00ad MA no. of issues\n\u00ad Issue Size\n\u00ad\u00ad MA Issue Size\nNote: IPO volume is the number of IPOs per month and IPO value is the total value of issues during a month. MA no. of issues and MA issue\nsize are three-monthly centred moving average of the issue volume and issue value, respectively.\nFigure 1: Trends in IPO Volume and Value\nAs given in Table 4, the high-grade IPOs seem to attract\ngreater overall subscription. Across the entire sample,\nthe median QIB and retail demand appears to be greater\nfo\nr the high-grade IPOs. For instance, the median QIB\nsubscription of` `Grade 4' issues are about 20 times,\ncomparedto1.1timesofthe`Grade1'IPOs.Forlow-grade\nIPOs, the retail demand seems to be greater than that\nof the QIB demand. For instance, the median `Grade 2'\nIPO is subscribed 3.3 times by the retail compared to 1.1\ntimes by the QIB. Partly, the lower QIB subscription of\nlow grade IPOs could be due to the internal investment\nrestrictions on issuer features such as firm size, leverage,\nprofitability, etc. It appears that compared to the large\nvariation in institutional subscription across grades, the\nretail subscription does not vary as much. These features\nof the subscription pattern suggest, at least, that the IPO\ndemand of retail and QIB are not always similar.\nTable 4: Brief Profile of the Graded IPOs\nFirm Indicators (median) Median Subscription Levels Mean Subscription Levels\nGrade Avg. issue size\n(` crore)\nAvg.pre-issue\nassets\nDebt/equity RONW Holding Overall retail QIB Overall retail QIB\nSource: Prepared by Authors.\nNote: The avg. issue size is the mean issue size of the IPOs in each grade; avg. assets is the book value of pre-issue assets; debt\u00adequity ratio\nis based on the pre-issue book value of debt and equity; RONW is the pre-issue PAT/net worth; and holding is the post-issue promoter holding.\nThe subscription levels represent the ratio of the number of shares applied to the total number of shares available.\nFeatures of IPO Underpricing\nA comparison of the pricing efficiency, as reflected in\nthe underpricing, is given in Table 5. All the issues\nin the sample period are not underpriced. A sizeable\nnumber (about 36 per cent) of the issues are found to\nbe overpriced, relative to their first-day closing price.\nNearly two-thirds of the overpriced IPOs are issued\nin cold market conditions. IPO underpricing appears\nto have significantly declined over the sample period.\nhas declined to about 5 per cent in 2011. The apparent\nimprovement in the pricing efficiency could be attrib-\nuted to a number of developments in the Indian market\nsuch as a broadened investor base, improved informa-\ntion disclosure by issuers, more effective aggregation\nof issue-related information and improved regulation.\nWhile there are many significant regulatory and struc-\ntural changes in the market over this period, the higher\nunderpricing of the earlier years could also be due to\nthe greater time gap between the issue and listing and\nthe associated cost of tied-up funds. For instance, the\naverage time period between issue date and listing date\nIt appears that larger IPOs have more efficient pricing\nin India. The average underpricing of IPO groups\nvarying in issue size and firm age is given in Table 5.\nThe top one-third of IPOs by size (issues of `150 crore\nand above) have an average underpricing of about 13\nper cent as against 32 per cent of the bottom one-third\n(issues below `60 crore). The larger issues are\ndocumented to have lower information asymmetry\nworld over. The age of the firm does not seem to have\nany significant unconditional influence on the IPO\npricing efficiency. The underpricing appears to be\ngreater during the hot periods than the cold periods.\nFor example, IPOs experience average underpricing\nTable 3: Distribution of the IPO Grades\nGrade No. of IPOs Years\nSource: Prepared by Authors.\nNote: The two graded IPOs in 2006 were graded voluntarily by\nthe issuers, the remaining were graded under the mandate of the\nregulator. The three firms given `Grade 5' were Coal India Ltd, the\nlargest public sector coal mining firm in India; MOIL, the largest public\nsector Manganese ore producer and L&T Finance Holdings Ltd, the\nfinance arm of the largest engineering and construction firm in India.\nof about 29 per cent during the hot months compared\nto about 15 per cent during the cold months. This\npattern is similar to the finding from markets including\nthe United States (Helwege & Liang, 2004). Table 6\ngives the average underpricing of IPOs grouped by\nthe overall and category-wise subscription levels.\nIPOs that have attracted the top one-third overall\nsubscription (subscribed more than 14.24 times) have\nsignificantly greater underpricing than the IPOs with\nbottom one-third overall subscription (subscribed less\nthan 2.48 times). This relatively higher underpricing\nof the IPOs with greater investor demand can be\nunderstood as a hot market phenomenon having\ngreater investor sentiment.\nTable 5: Underpricing of IPOs over Years\nIssue Size Age of Firm Mar\nSource: Prepared by Authors.\nNote: The bottom 1/3 IPOs by size correspond to issues below `60 crore, middle 1/3 correspond to issues between `60 and `150 crore and\ntop 1/3 are issues above `150 crore. By age, bottom 1/3 correspond to firms of less than 10 years age, middle 1/3 are firms of age between\n10 and 15 years and top 1/3 are those with age of 15 years and above. The hot market indicates whether the issue month falls into the top\none-third months by the moving average of the number of issues (otherwise cold market). The underpricing figures are the average first-day\nunderpricing for each group in percentage. The difference in the yearly underpricing between the `top 1/3' and `bottom 1/3' by issue size is\nstatistically significant at 5 per cent level for the issue size except for 2005 and 2008. It is statistically significant for firm age at the 1 per cent\nlevel, except in 2009, where it is significant at the 2 per cent level.\nTable 6: Subscription and Underpricing\nIssue Overall Subscription Retail Subscription QIB Subscription\nSource: Prepared by Authors.\nNote: The overall subscription groups are as follows: bottom 1/3 represent issues subscribed below 2.5 times; middle 1/3 are subscribed between\n2.5 and 14.3 times and top 1/3 are issues subscribed 14.3 times and above. The retail subscription groups are as follows: bottom 1/3 are issues\nsubscribed below 2.5 times; middle 1/3 are subscribed between 2.5 and 8.7 times and top 1/3 are issues subscribed 8.7 times and above. The\nQIB subscription groups are as follows: bottom 1/3 are issues subscribed below 1.7 times, Middle 1/3 are subscribed between 1.7 and 14.4\ntimes and top 1/3 are issues subscribed 14.4 times and above. The underpricing figures are the average first-day underpricing for each group in\npercentage. The difference in the yearly underpricing between the `top 1/3' and `bottom 1/3' is statistically significant at 10 per cent level for the\n`overall subscription' (except in 2011, where it is significant at 12 per cent level), 1 per cent level for the retail category (except for 2008, where it is\nsignificant at 5 per cent levels) and 1 per cent level for the institutional category (except 2008, where it is significant at 10 per cent levels).\nThe grade-wise average underpricing is given in\nTable 7. The average underpricing seems to decline with\nhigher grading, except in the case of Grade 5. However,\nthe Grade 5 sample has only three IPOs, which makes\nthe finding less reliable. The median underpricing does\nnot show a declining trend with higher grading. Hence,\nthe averages are being influenced by large underpricing\nvalues of a few IPOs.\nTable 7: Grades and Underpricing\nYear Mean Median Mean Median Mean Median Mean Median Mean Median\nSource: Prepared by Authors.\nNote: The two IPOs in 2006 were graded voluntarily by the issuers. The underpricing figures are the average first-day underpricing for each\ngroup in percentage.\nThese univariate relations suggest that IPOs that are\nlarger or issued in cold markets have lower under-\npricing and grading has no conspicuous influence on\nthe underpricing.\nGrading and IPO Demand\nWe adopt a robust regression procedure to analyse the\ninfluence of grading on IPO demand due to the presence\nof many outliers in the subscription data. The results of\ntherobustregressionsinvolvingthedemand(Equation1)\nof the retail and QIB investors are given in Table 8.\nPanel A gives the results where the demand of the other\ninvestor category is not included among the regressors\nand Panel B gives the results where the demand of the\nother investor category is included among the regres-\nsors. The overall results suggest that both the institu-\ntional and retail demand for IPOs is apparently influ-\nenced by the grades. The coefficient of the grade dummy\nfor the low-grade IPOs (D(1), D(2) and D(3)) is negative\nfor both the retail and QIB demand. The significance of\nthe coefficients of grading is greater in the case of QIBs.\nTable 8: Grading and Demand for IPOs--Regressions\nPanel A Panel B\nParameter Retail Demand Institutional Demand Retail Demand Institutional Demand\nCoefficient p-value Coefficient p-value Coefficient p-value Coefficient p-value\nIndustry control Yes Yes Yes Yes\nSource: Prepared by Authors.\nNote: The dependent variable in all the cross-sectional regressions is the number of times an issue is subscribed by an investor category (NTSi ),\nmeasured as the ratio of the number of shares bid to the number of shares eligible for the category. All the 351 IPOs during the sample period\nare included in the regressions. Panel A regressions do not have the demand of the other investor category among the regressors and Panel B\nregressions include the demand of the other investor category as regressors. All the variables are as defined in Table 1. Coefficients significant\nat 10 per cent or below are given in bold type.\nFor the QIB category, the results (given in Panel A of\nTable 8) indicate that the demand is weaker for the rela-\ntively low-grade IPOs, compared to the high-grade or\nungraded IPOs. The coefficient of the grade dummy is\npositive for the high-grade IPOs. These results are intu-\nitive as the institutional investors are believed to be\nrelatively more informed and rigorous in their invest-\nment approach, compared to their retail counterparts. It\nis also likely that the institutional investors have invest-\nment policy constraints that restrict their investments\nin IPOs having poor fundamentals. The other varia-\nbles with significant impact on the IPO demand of this\ncategory are the issue-related fundamentals: RONW,\ngroup affiliation, issue size and market conditions. As\nsuggested by the coefficient of the `hot\u00adcold' dummy\n(D(hot)), the demand for IPOs is greater during the hot\nperiod. These variables carry their expected signs.\nOn the contrary, the demand from the retail investors\n(as given in Panel A of Table 8) for both the low- and\nhigh-grade IPOs appears to be negative, relative to the\nungraded IPOs. The negative coefficient of the grade\ndummy is significant only for `Grade 2' and `Grade 3'\nIPOs.As the relatively low-grade IPOs have poor funda-\nmentals and are risky, the appetite for such IPOs ought\nto be lower, especially when these risk\u00adreturn charac-\nteristics are revealed to the market. The weaker demand\nfor the low-grade IPOs, compared to the ungraded IPOs,\ntentatively suggests a guidance role for the IPO grade in\nthe case of the retail investors. While the coefficient of\nthe dummy representing the high-grade issues (D(4/5))\nis insignificant for the retail category, its negative sign\nmerits some explanation. It is found that the high-\ngrade IPOs are larger issues by amount. For instance,\nthe average issue size of the overall sample is about\n`388 crore and the average size of `Grade 4' and`Grade\n5' issues is about `1,346 crore. These issues are over-\nsubscribed by the retail to a lower degree compared to\nthe average issue. This is possibly due to the limited\ninvestible funds available with them. The institutional\ninvestors have far more funds to invest, and hence may\ninvest more aggressively in the high-grade IPOs, as indi-\ncated by the positive coefficient of the grade dummy in\nthat case. Generally, the very large issues are unlikely\nto top the demand, when measured as the `number of\ntimes subscribed'. Hence, employing the `number of\ntimes subscribed' as a measure of the demand from\nthe investor categories itself is not without problems in\ncapturing the true relative issue demand.6\nOn the impact of the grade on IPO demand, Deb\nand Marisetty (2010) had found that it was the retail\nsubscription that was influenced by the grades. This\nstudy finds that the demands of both the retail and\ninstitutional investors are influenced by the IPO\ngrades. The contrasting results could be due to the\ndifference in their approach. First, they did not control\nfor market conditions industry. Second, their sample\nhad only 48 graded issues and a large number of them\nwere issued during a relatively cold period. Third, it\ncould also be due to the influence of outliers in the\ndata. The robust regression employed in this study\ntakes care of the outliers.\nIn a related article, Khurshed et al. (2011) found that it\nwas the demand of the institutional investors that was\nsignificantly influenced by the IPO grade. They found\nthat the institutional demand was relatively weaker\nfor the low-grade issues and stronger for the high-\ngrade issues. However, they did not find any signif-\nicant role of IPO grading in the retail demand and\nlinked this insignificance of the grades to the claim\nof the retail bids following the QIB bids, due to high\ntransparency of book building in India (Khurshed,\nBased on the evidence of the mutual influence of retail\nand institutional demand, we modify the cross-sectional\ndemand regressions (given in Equation 1) by adding the\ndemand of the other category as a regressor. The results\nof these regressions are given in Panel B of Table 8. The\ndemand of each of the investor categories apparently\ninfluences the demand of the other, as indicated by the\nsignificance of the associated coefficients (QIB-NTS and\nretail-NTS). On inclusion of the demand of institutional\ninvestors, the coefficients of the grade dummy turn\ninsignificant in the case of the retail demand.\nOverall, these results tend to suggest that the IPO grade\nhas some degree of influence on the investor demand.\nThe impact appears to be stronger in the case of the\ninstitutional investors. The direction of the impact for\nboth the categories suggests the following. First, the\nlow-grade issues experience weaker demand compared\nto the ungraded issues. Second, the high-grade issues\nexperience greater demand from the QIBs compared to\nthe ungraded IPOs. It is apparently puzzling to see why\nthe grade leaves a greater impact on the demand of the\nmore informed institutional investors, rather than that\nof the retail category. It is possible that the association\nbetween grades and demand for the institutional\ncategory found here could be just a reflection of the\nindependent IPO investment assessment done by the\ninstitutions based on the issue fundamentals.\nGrading and Bidding Behaviour\nIf grading had effectively supplemented or improved\nthe quality of issue-related information, available to\nthe retail investors, it would have allowed bidders to\ntake more informed IPO investment decisions. Such an\noutcome could influence the bidding behaviour of the\ninvestors, such as the (a) proportion of individual bids\nat cut-off and (b) bidders' degree of distinction of IPOs\nwith bright future prospects from their poor counter-\nparts. One would expect effective IPO grades to reduce\nthe number of bids submitted by the retail investors\nwithout a price quote (bids at cut-off).7 If the IPO\ngrades perform their expected role, then it would also\nenable the investors to better distinguish among issues\nwith differing future prospects. Our findings on these\naspects of the impact of IPO grading are as follows.\nFirst, the proportion of individual investors bidding for\nIPOs at cut-off price for the graded IPOs is apparently\nno different from that for IPOs without grade. About\n62 per cent of the individual investors' bids continue\nto be at cut-off price.8 Second, the retail demand of\nIPOs, with varying levels of post-listing returns, seems\nto be by and large unchanged for the graded issues\ncompared to the ungraded ones. These findings about\nthe bidding behaviour suggest a less influential role of\ngrading in the IPO market.\nGrading and IPO Underpricing\nThe possible impact of grading on underpricing is exam-\nined with cross-sectional regressions involving under-\npricing (as given in Equation 2). Two sets of regressions\nare estimated: (i) with only a single dummy variable to\ndistinguish the graded issues from the ungraded ones\nand (ii) with multiple dummy variables to distinguish\nacross the grades. The significance of the grade dummies\ncould imply the influence of grading on the IPO pricing.\nThe results of the regressions involving a single dummy\nare given in Model 1 of Table 9. The results indicate that\nwhereas grading is expected to be negatively related to\nunderpricing, the related dummy variable is not signif-\nicant (D (grade)). This seems to suggest that grading\nhas no significant influence on the pricing of IPOs. This\ninsignificance of grading has been reported earlier by\nKhurshed et al. (2011). However, our results contrast\nwith that of Deb and Marisetty (2010) who had found\nthat IPO grading helped to significantly reduce under-\npricing in India. The differences might be due to the\nlarger sample employed in this study and for the\nreasons identified earlier in the article.\nTable 9: Grading and Underpricing--Regressions\nVariable Model 1 (All IPOs;\nDummy Graded)\nModel 2 (Graded IPOs;\nDummy--Actual Grades)\nCoefficient p-value Coefficient p-value\nIndustry control Yes Yes\nSource: Prepared by Authors.\nNote: The dependent variable in all the cross-sectional regression\nmodels is the net underpricing (UPi) as defined in Equation 3. `Model\n1' is the regression involving all the IPOs during the sample period.\n`Model 2' involves only graded IPOs and has dummies to capture the\nIPO grades. All the variables are as defined in Table 1. Coefficients\nsignificant at 10 per cent or below are given in bold type.\nThe results further suggest that the only significant\nfactors that influence underpricing are the issue size\n(ln(Size)) and demand for IPOs (All-N T S). Larger\nissues appear to achieve better pricing, as expected. This\ncould be attributed to its lower information asymmetry.\nThe market demand of IPOs, captured by the number\nof times the IPOs are subscribed (All-N T S), suggests\nthat IPOs with greater market demand have higher\nunderpricing. This somewhat counter-intuitive result\ncan be understood as IPOs that experience high demand\nduring a hot period are often listed at a premium. This is\npossiblyduetotheunmetdemandintheprimarymarket.\nDuring hot markets, investors often exhibit a greater\ninclination to own assets, irrespective of their price. The\ngreater underpricing of IPOs during hot markets is also\nreported from elsewhere (Helwege & Liang, 2004).\nThe study further examined whether, among the\ngraded cohort, IPOs with higher grades have lower\nunderpricing compared to those with relatively lower-\ngrades. The results of the cross-sectional regressions\nwith the actual grades as categorical variables are\ngiven in Model 2 of Table 9. The insignificance of all\nthe grade dummies (D(2), . . . , D(4/5)) reinforces the\nearlier evidence on the failure of grading to positively\ninfluence underpricing. As in the case of Model 1, the\nmost significant factor influencing underpricing is the\ndemand of IPOs.\nIt was expected that IPO grading would help to\nalleviate the information asymmetry around the\nIPOs. It is interesting, therefore, to examine whether\ngrading has any impact on the pricing of relatively\nsmall IPOs, where the information asymmetry is\nbelieved to be high. The study examined this issue\nthrough cross-sectional regressions involving the\nIPOs of only small firms similar to regressions in Table\n9. All the firms that belong to the bottom one-third\nwhen ranked by the pre-issue assets are taken as the\nsample of small firms. We find no evidence for the\nsignificance of grades on underpricing (results not\nreported for brevity).\nCONCLUSION\n`IPO grading' attempts to give comprehensive issue-\nrelated information in an `easy-to-use' format to the\ninvestors. This was expected to positively influence\nthe IPO demand and improve the efficiency of IPO\npricing in India. We examine the extent to which\nthese expectations from IPO grading are realised in\nthe market.\nWhile it appears that grading positively influences the\ndemand for high-grade IPOs, there is a significant diffi-\nculty to regard it as an evidence in favour of the miti-\ngation of information asymmetry by grading for the\nfollowing reasons. First, grading, which is expected\nto guide the retail investors, does not appear to influ-\nence their demand. There is also no evidence that the\ngrading helps to better translate the issue information\ninto a price quote. Even with grading, the proportion\nof retail bids without a price quote remains very high.\nSecond, while the grades appear to have an impact\non the demand of the institutional investors, it has no\ninfluence on the IPO pricing efficiency. The extent of\nunderpricing is unrelated to grades. The graded issues,\nwhich are expected to have lower information asym-\nmetry, do not have a relatively lower underpricing\ncompared to the ungraded issues. Further, the high-\ngrade issues do not have lower underpricing relative\nto the low-grade issues. It is possible that the evidence\nof the influence of grade on the demand of the institu-\ntional investors could be just due to the independent\nprocessing of the issue-related information by them\nrather than the use of grades. For these reasons, it is\nnot appropriate to argue that the significance of IPO\ngrading in the institutional investor demand is suffi-\ncient evidence for the contributory role of grading.\nThese results on the impact of IPO grading in India\non pricing efficiency sharply contrast with the finding\nof Deb and Marisetty (2010) that the grading leads to\nlower underpricing.\nThe insignificant role of grading in IPO pricing almost\nsuggests that grading has not performed its expected\nrole as a certification of the underlying issue quality.\nThe reasons for the failure of this innovative certifi-\ncation could be many. It is perhaps difficult to assign\nreliable IPO grades due to the residual nature of the\nequity cash flows. Whereas credit rating is based on a\nset of reasonably measurable criteria whose failure can\nbe tracked, the post-IPO stock performance has only a\nweak tractability. This weak tractability may not suffi-\nciently incentivise agencies to assign grades objec-\ntively and, thus, erodes its role as a credible signal of\nIPO quality. Further, the transparency of book building\nin India appears to allow prospective retail bidders to\nbenefit from the almost real-time demand schedule of\nIPOs of the institutional investors. This could also make\nIPO grading redundant.\nNOTES\n1 Prior to the introduction of mandatory grading, the regu-\nlator had introduced optional grading of IPOs in April 2006.\n2 Frequently asked questions on IPO grading. Retrieved 31\nJuly, 2012 from http://www.sebi.gov.in/faq/ipo.html\n3 Every grade report explicitly mentions that the grade is\nnot an opinion on the issue pricing.\n4 The maximum issue size in October 2010 was contributed\nby a large IPO of a public sector firm.\n5 Cold months outnumber the hot months due to a large\nnumber of months in the calendar period without any\nissues.\n6 For instance, the IPO of Coal India Ltd, a very popular\nissue in India, with an issue size of about `15,200 crore was\nsubscribed only about 15.2 times compared to the sample\naverage of 18 times.\n7 In India, the retail investors are allowed to bid at `cut-off\nprice', which leads to bidding for shares without quoting a\nprice. This is allowed on the assumption that many retail\ninvestors might not have the wherewithal to quote a\nprice. If the IPO grading reduces information asymmetry,\nfor the retail investors, then more retail investors could be\nable to form an opinion about the IPO price.\n8 About 31 per cent of the total bids are submitted at cut-off.\nAssuming a total individual investor quota of 50 per cent\nand an almost equal level of subscription by individual\nand institutional investors, this translates into 62 per cent\nof individual bids.\n"
