    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Using information from case studies, published documents, and\nthe Current Population Survey, this paper describes and classifies state ap-\nproaches to providing health insurance to low-income populations (as of 1997).\nIt examines the link between the scope of state efforts and uninsurance rates\nfor low-income populations. Findings indicate that the breadth of state policies\ncontributes to differences in insurance coverage for low-income persons across\nstates.\nEmployer-sponsored health insurance is the corner-\nstone of the U.S. health insurance system for the nonelderly\npopulation. Nearly 160 million children and nonelderly adults\nsystem, however, inherently leaves a sizable gap in health insurance\ncoverage: Persons without a connection to the workforce, and even\nmany who are linked to the workforce, may not have access to\naffordable health insurance or may choose not to buy it. Nationwide,\nthirty-six million persons were uninsured in 1995.2\nThe rate of uninsurance varies greatly across states, from a low of\n7.2 percent in Tennessee to a high of 25.7 percent in New Mexico.\nStates have undertaken a number of strategies for addressing the\nneeds of the uninsured.3 This paper focuses on publicly funded\nhealth insurance programs.4 States have used three main types of\ngovernment-subsidized health insurance programs--Medicaid,\nGeneral Assistance (GA) medical care, and other state-subsidized\nprograms--to provide health insurance to low-income populations.\nMedicaid covered thirty-five million persons at a cost of $151\nbillion in 1995.5 With the passage of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA)\nof 1997, another federal/state program, the State Children's Health\n\u00a9 1998ThePeople-to-PeopleHealth Foundation, Inc.\nShruti Rajan is a research associateat the Urban Institute's HealthPolicy Center.\nFEDERALISM\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ M a y / J u n e 1 9 9 8\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Several states also have\nused GA programs to provide health insurance or have created state-\nsubsidized health insurance programs to serve persons who are in-\neligible for Medicaid.\nThis paper examines the approaches states have taken in using\nthese programs to cover the uninsured and the relationship between\nstates' approaches and their uninsurance rates. As part of the As-\nsessing the New Federalism (ANF) project, this research focuses on\nthirteen states: Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Massachu-\nsetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York,\nTexas, Washington, and Wisconsin.6 The ANF project is a large,\nmultiyear research effort undertaken by the Urban Institute to moni-\ntor and analyze health care and social policies at the state level. This\npaper draws on information collected through in-depth case studies\ndocuments. Unless otherwise noted, specific information on state\nprograms is drawn from the case studies. Data from the March 1996\nand 1995 Supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS) are\nused to examine the composition of health insurance coverage na-\ntionally and across states.\nPublic Support For Health Insurance\nUltimately, the generosity of a state's approach is a function of how\nthe state uses its subsidized programs to provide coverage to its\nlow-income population. Before discussing the specific ways in\nwhich states have structured these programs, I present a brief de-\nscription of each type of program.\nn Medicaid. Most prominent is the Medicaid program, a joint\nfederal/state entitlement program that provides health insurance for\ncertain low-income populations. Medicaid is administered at the\nstate level, but responsibility for program funding and for setting\nprogram policy is shared by the federal and state governments.\nStates receive a federal financial match for their Medicaid expen-\nditures. The federal match is adjusted to account for a state's fiscal\ncapacity and ranges from 50 percent in states with higher capacity,\nsuch as New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, to 79 percent in\nstates with relatively low capacity, such as Mississippi. Federal fi-\nnancial participation makes expansion of Medicaid eligibility ap-\npealing to states relative to expanding health insurance programs\nthat are funded by state and local dollars.\nStates make many eligibility decisions within federal guidelines.\nFederal law requires states to provide Medicaid to three major\npopulations. The largest group (56 percent of Medicaid enrollees in\nINSURANCE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 7 , N u m b e r 3\nN e w F e d e r a l i s m\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

Finally, the Medic-\naid program pays Medicare cost-sharing amounts on behalf of cer-\ntain low-income Medicare beneficiaries.8\nStates may extend coverage to additional populations via \"op-\ntional\" Medicaid coverage rules. First, certain medically needy indi-\nviduals may qualify for Medicaid. As of this writing, thirty-six states\nhad such programs. Second, states may broaden poverty-related\nMedicaid coverage for pregnant women and for children under age\none to as high as 185 percent of the federal poverty level. Twenty-\neight states had exercised this option by 1996.9 In addition, through\nthe 1902(r)(2) statute, states may disregard income and resources\nabove the established limits for pregnant women, children under age\nnineteen, and qualified Medicare beneficiaries (QMBs). This statute\nhas been particularly important in raising eligibility standards for\nchildren age six and older; twelve states used this option in 1996.10\nFinally, states may set a special income standard for institutional-\nized persons. This standard may not exceed 300 percent of the basic\nSSI benefit.\nStates also may broaden Medicaid eligibility through Section 1115\nwaivers, which have grown increasingly popular among states since\n1993. Some states have broadened eligibility to all uninsured persons\nwith incomes below a certain level. Other states have leveraged federal\nmatching funds by using Section 1115 waivers to extend Medicaid\ncoverage to participants in GA and other state-subsidized programs.\nn General Assistance. State GA programs provide cash or\nin-kind assistance primarily to temporarily disabled, low-income\npersons who do not qualify for federal assistance programs, such as\nAFDC (Temporary Assistance to Needy Families [TANF] as of\n1997), SSI, or Medicaid. Of the forty-two states with GA programs,\nthirty-two provide both medical and cash assistance.11 Although the\namount of cash or in-kind assistance offered by GA programs is\ngenerally low, medical coverage under such programs can be gener-\nous and in many instances is comparable to Medicaid coverage.\nDespite their significance to the safety net, the recession and sub-\nsequent state budget reductions in the early 1990s caused states to\nscale back GA spending, according to one report.12\nn Other state-subsidized programs.

In fact, many states have designed their programs\nto promote self-sufficiency and avoid the \"welfare stigma\" often asso-\nciated with Medicaid and GA. A major attraction of these programs\nis that they do not have to be open-ended entitlement programs.\nSome states have used Section 1115 demonstrations to leverage\nMedicaid federal matching funds for their programs. A few states have\nintegrated Medicaid, GA, and state-subsidized programs into a single\nprogram under these demonstrations. Other states have kept their\nstate-subsidized programs separate from Medicaid but have negoti-\nated a federal financial match for state spending on participants who\nwould be eligible for Medicaid under a 1902(r)(2) expansion.\nA Typology Of States' Health Insurance Systems\nStates' publicly supported health insurance programs can be classi-\nfied into three broad coverage categories (comprehensive, moderate,\nand limited). The \"comprehensive\" category includes states that tend\nto maximize Medicaid eligibility standards and thus take advantage\nof federal financial participation. These states also use state funds to\nfinance insurance coverage through GA medical care, state-subsi-\ndized programs, or both. The \"moderate\" category includes states that\nalso tend to maximize federal financial participation and implement\nbroad Medicaid eligibility standards but do little to provide insurance\ncoverage using only their own funds. Finally, the \"limited\" category\nincludes states that have extended Medicaid coverage little beyond\nfederal requirements and thus have not taken advantage of the federal\nmatching funds (despite the high federal matching rate in many of\nthese states). In addition, these states typically have not used state or\nlocal monies to support health insurance programs for the uninsured.\nEach state's approach was classified based on the scope of the\nstate's Medicaid eligibility standards and the extent of coverage\nprovided through its GA medical care and state-subsidized pro-\n\"`Comprehensive' states tendto maximize Medicaid eligibility stand-\nards and thus take advantage of federal financial participation.\"\nINSURANCE\nH E A L T H A F F A I R S ~ V o l u m e 1 7 , N u m b e r 3\nN e w F e d e r a l i s m\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on October 31, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The generosity of Medicaid eligibility was assessed by con-\nsidering, among other factors, AFDC income limits, the extent of\nexpansion of eligibility beyond mandatory populations, and the per-\ncentage of low-income (below 200 percent of poverty) populations\neligible for Medicaid.15 The existence and size (in terms of enroll-\nment) of a GA medical care and/or another state-subsidized health\ninsurance program also were taken into account. A comparison of\nthe relative sizes of the programs was based on the ratio of enrollees\n(from each program) to uninsured persons in a state.16\nn \"Comprehensive\" states.

All four have broad-\nbased Medicaid eligibility and relatively far-reaching GA and state-\nsubsidized insurance programs. Their commitment to creating a\nstrong health care system is evident in other efforts, including the\nlarge uncompensated care pools to fund care for the uninsured in\nNew York and Massachusetts, extensive insurance market reforms\nin New York, and the comprehensive health care reform legislation\nthat was passed and implemented during the early 1990s in Minne-\nsota, Massachusetts, and Washington.\nMassachusetts. Massachusetts has developed a strong publicly\nfunded health insurance system. It has set relatively high AFDC\nincome limits and Medicaid coverage that extends beyond man-\ndated levels to infants and pregnant women. The state operates a\nGA medical care program as well as three state-subsidized pro-\ngrams serving distinct target populations. The first of these, the\nChildren's Medical Security Plan, offers coverage to all uninsured\nchildren; children from families with incomes below 200 percent of\npoverty receive subsidies. A second program, the Medical Security\nPlan, serves adults who have incomes up to 400 percent of the\nfederal poverty line and are receiving state and federal unemploy-\nment benefits. The third program, CommonHealth, provides health\ninsurance to working adults with disabilities and to children with\ndisabilities who are ineligible for Medicaid. As of April 1997 the\nChildren's Medical Security Plan was serving 33,000 children, the\nMedical Security Plan had 16,700 participants, and CommonHealth\nUnder its Section 1115 waiver program, the state plans to inte-\ngrate the CommonHealth and Medical Security Plan into Medicaid.\nThe structure of these programs would remain the same, but the\nstate would begin to receive a federal financial match for program\noutlays. The demonstration also will expand Medicaid coverage to\nchildren with family incomes below 200 percent of poverty.\nMinnesota. Minnesota has a long history of providing generous\nhealth care benefits to the poor. The state supports a comprehensive\nMedicaid program with broad service coverage and liberal eligibility\nstandards. Through optional eligibility rules, Minnesota provides\nMedicaid coverage to children under age twenty-one and pregnant\nwomen with family incomes up to 275 percent of poverty. The state\nhas been equally progressive with its GA medical care and state-\nsubsidized health insurance program, MinnesotaCare. Eligibility for\nMinnesotaCare has been expanded since it began in 1992. Today the\nprogram covers children through age twenty-one with family in-\ncomes below 275 percent of poverty and single adults and childless\ncouples with incomes up to 175 percent of poverty.

New York has one of the most far-reaching publicly\nsupported health insurance systems among the study states and in\nthe country. The state's AFDC income limit at 53 percent of poverty\nis among the highest across the study states. Medicaid eligibility for\ninfants and pregnant women has been expanded beyond the feder-\nally mandated level, and the state offers a medically needy program.\nNew York also is one of the most generous states in terms of its GA\nand other state-subsidized programs. Of the GA programs studied,\nNew York's Home Relief program stands out as being the most\ngenerous, in terms of both eligibility and service coverage; it is by far\nSimilarly, New York's state-subsidized Child Health Plus program\nfor low-income children has relatively broad eligibility standards\n1996 nearly doubled funding for the Child Health Plus program.\nWith this new funding, the state expanded both program benefits\nand eligibility. The program now covers children through age eight-\neen in families with incomes below 222 percent of poverty.\nWashington. Washington State also has a history of implement-\ning innovative, progressive health insurance programs for its low-\nincome population. Medicaid eligibility is generous, covering all\nchildren under age nineteen with family incomes below 200 percent\nof the poverty line and pregnant women with incomes up to 185\npercent of poverty (Exhibit 1). Washington's Basic Health Plan\n(BHP) program was the first of its kind and has served as a model for\nother states. The BHP subsidizes individuals, families, or employers\nto purchase health insurance coverage from a specified group of\nplans. Persons with incomes up to 200 percent of poverty receive\nsubsidies on a sliding scale, but those with higher incomes may join\nby paying the full premium. The employer buy-in option allows em-\nployers to purchase coverage for employees through the BHP, al-\nthough few employers have chosen to participate.

Infants and pregnant women\nwith incomes up to 185 percent of poverty and children up to age\nsixteen with incomes below 150 percent of poverty qualify to receive\nMedicaid benefits.

The state has set\nAFDC income limits above the national average, has established a\nmedically needy program, and has expanded eligibility for pregnant\nwomen and for infants beyond the mandated level. Although the\nstate operates a moderate-size GA program and a relatively small\nstate-subsidized program for low-income persons, the primary fo-\ncus of its health care reform efforts has been on market-based re-\nforms. In fact, legislation creating the state-subsidized Health Ac-\ncess New Jersey program was passed in 1992, but efforts to\nimplement the strong insurance market reforms (along with other\nfactors) delayed its implementation until 1995.\nWisconsin. Wisconsin has extended Medicaid eligibility to chil-\ndren and pregnant women with family incomes up to 185 percent of\npoverty and operates a medically needy program.

Nationally, Medicaid insured\nnearly the same proportion of low-income persons as did employer-\nsponsored coverage (Exhibit 4). In contrast, the percentage of all\nnonelderly persons with employer-sponsored coverage was more\nthan five times the percentage with Medicaid coverage.\nAmong the three groups of study states, employer-sponsored cov-\nerage rates were comparable at about 35 percent. However, Medic-\naid coverage levels were higher on average among states in the \"com-\nprehensive\" and \"moderate\" groups than among states in the\n\"limited\" category. \"Comprehensive\" and \"moderate\" states had\nabove-average Medicaid coverage rates (Exhibit 4). Medicaid cover-\nage in the five states in the \"limited\" category fell nearly five percent-\nage points below the national average.\nDifferences in the composition of insurance coverage across the\nthree categories are similar for low-income adults but are more\nstriking if we consider coverage for low-income children (Exhibit\n5).22 Low-income adults in states with more limited publicly funded\n\"Nationally, Medicaid insured nearly the same proportion of\nlow-income persons as did employer-sponsored coverage.\"\nHealth Insurance Coverage Of Nonelderly Adults And Children With Incomes Below\n200 Percent Of Poverty, By Scope Of Publicly Supported Health Insurance Programs,\nAdults\nComprehensive\nModerate\nLimited\nChildren\nComprehensivec\nModerate\nLimitedc\nSOURCE: Urban Institute tabulations of the March 1995 and March 1996 Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS).\na Estimates have been corrected for underreporting of Medicaid coverage using the Urban Institute's Transfer Income Model\n(TRIM-2) microsimulation model.\nb Includes individually purchased plans, nonelderly Medicare enrollees, military insurance, and other state-subsidized health\ninsurance programs.

The uninsurance rate\nis lowest in the \"comprehensive\" category and highest in the \"lim-\nited\" group. Employer-sponsored coverage levels for low-income\nadults are relatively comparable across the three categories. Medic-\naid coverage in the \"comprehensive\" and \"moderate\" categories is\nabout 40 percent higher than in the \"limited\" category.\nAs with adults, more low-income children were uninsured in\nstates with more restrictive publicly funded health insurance pro-\ngrams than in other states. Again, the uninsurance rate was lowest\nin the \"comprehensive\" states and highest in the \"limited\" states.\nEmployer-sponsored coverage levels were similar across the three\ncategories and were comparable to employer coverage levels for\nadults. However, Medicaid, with its focus on families with children,\ncovered a much higher percentage of low-income children than did\nemployer-sponsored coverage. As expected, Medicaid coverage\nrates are also highest in the \"comprehensive\" and \"moderate\" states.\n\"Crowd-out\" effect. An important question is whether broad-based\npublicly funded insurance programs \"crowd out\" or substitute for\nprivate coverage. Many have argued, and it is generally agreed, that\nthere is some \"crowding out\" of private insurance but that the ex-\ntent of the problem is difficult to estimate.23 If there were consider-\nable crowding out of private insurance, one would expect to see\nstates with moderate or comprehensive publicly supported pro-\ngrams having consistently lower rates of employer-sponsored cover-\nage than is true in states with more limited public programs.\nThere appears to be low correlation between the generosity of\npublic programs and employer-sponsored insurance levels. Some\nstates have generous public programs and lower-than-average rates\nof employer coverage for low-income persons (New York and Cali-\nfornia), and some have limited public programs and relatively high\nemployer coverage for low-income populations (Alabama and Colo-\nrado). At the same time, several states have far-reaching public pro-\ngrams and high levels of employer coverage (Minnesota, Massachu-\nsetts, Wisconsin, and Michigan), and some states have neither\nbroad public efforts nor high employer coverage (Texas and Missis-\nsippi). These patterns support the notion that the amount of substi-\ntution of public for private coverage is small.\nConclusions\nThe publicly supported health insurance programs discussed in this\npaper have been successful, on average, in filling some of the gaps in\nhealth insurance coverage left by our employment-based health in-\nsurance system.

In fact, Medicaid provided insurance to\nnearly the same percentage of low-income nonelderly persons as did\nemployer-sponsored coverage. The program has been a particularly\nimportant source of coverage for low-income children: Medicaid\ncovered 49 percent, and employer-sponsored coverage, 35 percent,\nof low-income children.\nHowever, even in states with more comprehensive programs,\ngovernment-supported health insurance programs were not de-\nsigned to achieve universal coverage. Thus, these programs have\nallocated some resources to the most vulnerable populations but\nhave left many persons, primarily childless adults, without access to\naffordable health insurance.\nIt is also important to remember that publicly funded health in-\nsurance is only part of the picture. Virtually all fifty states have\npassed legislation reforming the small-group insurance market.\nStates also have used other approaches not based on insurance to\nmeet the health care needs of the uninsured, such as support of\nsafety-net providers. Charity or uncompensated care has been an-\nother significant means of providing medical care to under- and\nuninsured persons.24 In California, county-based indigent care pro-\nserving medically indigent persons. New York and Massachusetts\nhave established uncompensated care pools to subsidize hospitals\nand health centers providing charity care.

Hospitals and physicians in Alabama\nhave experienced less financial pressure, given the slow development\nof managed care there. These providers have been able to preserve a\nsubstantial financial cushion to subsidize care to the under- and un-\ninsured. Providers and policymakers in Mississippi and Texas have\nattempted to provide access to care for the uninsured through a\nsystem of public hospitals and clinics. Although improving access to\ncare is important, it is not equivalent to providing insurance: Unin-\nsured persons are more likely to postpone getting needed medical\ncare and are less likely to receive routine physician services.25\nWithin the context of a voluntary, employment-based health care\nsystem, many factors affect the delivery of care to the under- and\nuninsured.

There are also a number of private (often with some public financial support)\nhealth insurance subsidy programs for low-income populations. The Blue\nCross/Blue Shield Caring programs for children are examples of such pro-\ngrams to address the health care needs of the uninsured. In this paper we focus\non health insurance subsidy programs funded and operated by state (and\nlocal) governments and operating in several counties or statewide.\n14. D. Lipson and S.

Information on the generosity of Medicaid eligibility policies was drawn from\ncase studies, published documents, and tabulations of the CPS.\n16. The estimated ratios tend to understate the magnitude of these programs in\nreaching the uninsured. Because small sample size does not allow us to esti-\nmate the number of low-income uninsured persons by state, we must define\nthe target population as all uninsured persons in the state. However, most GA\nand other state-subsidized programs are targeted to low-income persons.\nEstimates of the number of uninsured were tabulated using the CPS.\n17.

This includes the population with incomes up to 200 percent of poverty. The\nfocus is on Medicaid eligibility because it is not possible to estimate the size of\nthe population eligible for GA and other state-subsidized programs using the\nCPS. The CPS does not allow for accurate identification of persons covered by\nGA and other state-subsidized programs, nor does it have adequate sample\nsize at the state level to make reliable estimates of narrow subpopulations.\nEstimating Medicaid eligibility and enrollment levels using data available\nfrom the CPS is complex. For example, because the CPS does not contain\ninformation on individuals' medical expenditures, it is difficult to estimate\neligibility for a state's medically needy program. It also is not possible to\nestimate full-year or person months of Medicaid enrollment and eligibility\nusing the CPS.\n20. Lipson and Schrodel, StateInitiatives in HealthCare Reform.\n22.
