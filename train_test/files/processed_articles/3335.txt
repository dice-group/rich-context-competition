Parameters related to the block procedure and\npatient comfort were assessed.\nResults: Thirty patients were included in each group. The block performance time was longer in\nthe pen \u00fe group than the pen \u00c0 group despite a reduced number of needle insertions. The\ncomplete block rate was higher and intraoperative analgesic usage lower in the pen \u00fe group\ncompared with the pen \u00c0 group. Patient satisfaction and complication rates were similar in the two\ngroups.\nConclusion: The pen device seems to be a helpful addition to PNS for ABPB, with improved\nresults in terms of block success and patient comfort, but further studies are needed to confirm\nthese findings.\n",

The anatomical structure of the\naxilla makes the target nerves more reliably\nand easily reachable and this method is\nreadily accepted by the patient.1,2\nThe use of a pen device for nerve local-\nization in axillary brachial plexus block\n(ABPB) has become accepted in anaesthesia\npractice, but little has been published con-\ncerning its efficacy. This device connects to a\nperipheral nerve stimulator, enabling nerve\nmapping without puncturing the skin\n(Figure 1).\nIn this prospective study, ABPB was\nperformed using peripheral nerve stimula-\ntion (PNS) alone or preceded by nerve\nlocalization with a pen device. The two\nprocedures were compared in terms of the\nblock success rate, block performance time,\nnumber of needle insertions and reposition-\nings, complications and patient comfort.\nPatients and methods\nPatients\nPatients undergoing unilateral hand or fore-\narm surgery suitable for ABPB at the\nFaculty of Medicine, Akdeniz University,\nAntalya, Turkey, over a period of 8 months\naged between 18 and 65 years and who had\nan American Society of Anesthesiologists\n(ASA) status of class I\u00adIII were enrolled.\nPatients who were not suitable for regional\nanaesthesia were excluded from the study.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine,\nAkdeniz University, and written consent\nwas obtained from all study participants.\nPatients were premedicated with 1 mg\nintravenous midazolam. Arterial blood\npressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram and\nperipheral oxygen saturation were moni-\ntored throughout the procedure. Patients\nwere randomly divided using a sealed enve-\nlope system into two groups to receive PNS\nvia an inserted needle either alone\n(pen \u00c0 group) or preceded by nerve localiza-\ntion using a pen device (pen \u00fe group).\nProcedure in the pen \u00c0 group\nThe arm to be operated on was positioned at\nflexion. The axilla was cleaned with povi-\ndone\u00adiodine. Following infiltration of 30 mg\nlidocaine subcutaneously to provide skin\nanaesthesia in the area where the block\nwas to be performed, the axillary artery\nwas palpated. A 50 mm Stimuplex\u00d5 needle\nconnected to a Stimuplex\u00d5 nerve stimulator\n(B Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was\ninserted through the skin and subcutaneous\ntissue alongside the artery. Electrical stimu-\nlation at 2 Hz and 2 mA was applied to the\nneedle. Muscle contractions in the forearm,\nhand and fingers (stimulated by the muscu-\nlocutaneous) were observed and the needle\nrepositioned until movements associated\nwith the particular nerve to be blocked\nwere seen. When stimulation of the needle\nproduced the most powerful contractions,\nthe current was reduced to 0.5 mA. If the\ncontractions ceased, the needle was repos-\nitioned until muscle contractions occurred at\nthe lower current levels. Confirmation was\nobtained that the needle was not inside a\nblood vessel by negative aspiration. Then\n70 mg lidocaine was injected via the needle,\nFigure 1. Percutaneous nerve localization pen\ndevice.\n10 ml normal saline (total volume 40 ml)\n(single injection technique).\nProcedure in the pen \u00fe group\nThe arm to be operated on was positioned\nand the axilla prepared as for the\npen \u00c0 group. The pen device (Stimuplex\u00d5\npen, B Braun) was placed in a sterile bag and\nconnected to the Stimuplex\u00d5 nerve stimula-\ntor. The pen device was held like a pen in the\noperator's hand and the end of the device\nwas placed on the skin. After palpation of\nthe axillary artery, electrical stimulation at\n2 Hz and 5 mA was applied to the pen device\nas it was moved across the skin above the\nartery. Muscle contractions in the forearm,\nhand and fingers (stimulated by the muscu-\nlocutaneous) were observed and the pen\ndevice repositioned until movements asso-\nciated with the particular nerve to be\nblocked were seen. When stimulation of the\npen device produced the most powerful\ncontractions, the current was reduced to\n2 mA. If the contractions ceased, the\npen device was repositioned until muscle\ncontractions were seen at the lower current\nlevel. The position of the pen device\nwas marked on the skin using a sterile\nmarker pen.\nThe pen device was then disconnected\nfrom the nerve stimulator and a 50 mm\nStimuplex\u00d5 needle was connected in its\nplace. The needle was inserted through the\nskin and subcutaneous tissue at the position\nmarked. Electrical stimulation at 2 Hz and\n2 mA was applied to the needle. Muscle\ncontractions in the forearm, hand and fin-\ngers were observed and the needle repos-\nitioned until movements associated with the\nparticular nerve to be blocked were seen.\nWhen stimulation of the needle produced\nthe most powerful contractions, the current\nwas reduced to 0.5 mA. If the contractions\nceased, the needle was repositioned until\nmuscle contractions occurred at the lower\ncurrent levels. Confirmation was obtained\nthat the needle was not inside a blood vessel\nby negative aspiration. Then 70 mg lidocaine\nwas injected via the needle, followed by\nsaline (total volume 40 ml) (single injection\ntechnique).\nAssessment of procedure\nThe block performance time, defined as the\ntime between palpation of the axillary artery\nto the time when the needle was removed,\nwas measured by an assistant using a\nchronograph. In addition, the total number\nof times the needle was withdrawn through\nthe skin (needle insertion count) or repos-\nitioned without withdrawal (needle passage\ncount), the duration of the operation, and\nthe need for any additional intraoperative\nsedation or local anaesthesia to the surgical\narea were recorded by the anaesthetist, who\nwas not blinded to the procesure.\nEvaluation of block success\nTo assess sensory block in the operation\narea, a pinprick test on all four terminal\nbranch areas was conducted every 5 min\nfollowing the injection of local anaesthesia.\nThe result was scored on a scale from 0 to 2,\nwhere 2 represented total loss of both pain\nand touch (complete block), 1 represented\nloss of pain but not touch (partial block),\nand 0 represented persistence of both pain\nand touch (no block).\nA modified Bromage scale3 was used to\nperform motor block assessment every 5 min\nfollowing the injection of local anaesthesia.\nThe result was scored on a scale from 0 to 3,\nwhere 0 represented absence of movement in\nthe upper extremity, 1 represented the pres-\nence of movement in the fingers only, 2\nrepresented the presence of flexion in the\nwrist, and 3 represented the presence of\nflexion in the elbow.\nWhen indicated by a partial sensory\nblock score 1, a motor block score 1 or if\nthe patient became irritable, additional\nintravenous sedation was given consisting\nof an initial bolus of 50 mg of fentanyl\nfollowed by a 1 mg bolus of midazolam if\nrequired. In patients who continued to suffer\nfrom pain despite receiving more than two\ndoses of both sedative drugs plus subcuta-\nneous prilocaine to the surgical area, the\nblock was deemed to be unsuccessful and\ngeneral anaesthesia was commenced via a\nlaryngeal mask (Table 1). These patients\nwere excluded from the study.\nOverall block success was defined in\nterms of the need for additional intravenous\nsedation or local anaesthesia to the surgical\narea. No requirement for additional intra-\nvenous sedation or local anaesthesia was\ndefined as complete block success and was\nassigned a score of 0. The need for add-\nitional sedation was assigned a score of 1,\nand the need for additional local anaesthesia\nand additional sedation was assigned a score\nof 2; a score of 1 or 2 was defined as assisted\nblock success.\nIn addition, the need for intraoperative\nanalgesia (50 mg fentanyl intravenously) was\nscored at 60 and 90 min from the beginning\nof the block procedure, with the absence of\nanalgesic use being assigned a score of 0, use\nof a single dose of analgesic being assigned a\nscore of 1, and use of two doses of analgesic\nbeing assigned a score of 2.\nEvaluation of pain\nPain in the surgical area and pain related to\nthe block procedure were evaluated using a\nvisual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 1\nTo assess pain in the surgical area,\npatients were asked to score the pain\nbefore commencing the surgical procedure,\nat 5 min and 10 min following local anaes-\nthesia administration for axillary block, at\n10 min intervals for 1 h during surgery, then\nend of the operation.\nTo assess pain related to the block per-\nformance, patients were asked to score the\npain felt in the axilla due to needle entry and\ndrug administration.\nPatient satisfaction and complications\nAt the end of the operation, all patients were\nasked whether or not they would be happy\nto undergo the same anaesthesia procedure\nagain in the future.\nVascular complications (arterial or\nvenous puncture), neurological complica-\ntions, complications in the injection area\n(haematoma or infection), local anaesthetic\ntoxicity/allergic reactions and any other\ncomplications were recorded.\nStatistical analyses\nFor our sample size (n \u00bc 30 in each group),\nwith a significance level of 0.05 and effect\nsize of 0.55, post hoc analysis showed a\npower of 0.73. Results were expressed as\nfrequencies, percentages or means \u00c6 SD.\nPearson's 2 or Fisher's exact test were\nused to establish relationships between\nTable 1.

All statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SPSS software version 18.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P-value of\n<0.05 was considered to be statistically\nsignificant.\nResults\nA total of 60 patients were randomly\nallocated to the pen \u00c0 group (n \u00bc 30) or the\npen \u00fe group (n \u00bc 30). There were no statis-\ntical differences between the groups in terms\nof age, sex, body mass index or duration of\noperation (Table 2). In addition, there were\nno statistical differences in blood pressure,\nheart rate or oxygen saturation between the\ngroups nor any statistical change in these\nparameters within each group pre- and\npostoperatively (data not shown).\nBlock performance times, needle inser-\ntion counts and needle passage counts are\nshown in Table 3. Overall block success in\nthe two groups is shown in Table 4.\nComplete block occurred significantly\nmore frequently in the pen \u00fe group com-\npared with the pen \u00c0 group (P \u00bc 0.007). In\nthe pen \u00c0 group, of the patients with partial\noped complete sensory block by 30 min; in\naddition, sensory block scores associated\nwith radial block appeared to settle more\nquickly than those associated with blockade\nof the other brachial plexus nerves (data not\nshown). However, these differences were not\ntaken into consideration when assessing\noverall block success.\nThe need for intraoperative analgesia\ngroups is shown in Table 5. Significantly\nfewer patients required intraoperative anal-\ngesia at 60 min in the pen \u00fe group than in\nthe pen \u00c0 group (P \u00bc 0.019). This time point\nis of particular interest in evaluating anaes-\nthetic success as it represents the time at\nwhich the planned surgical intervention is\nlikely to occur following performance of the\naxillary block and the completion of other\npreparations. There was no statistical differ-\nence between the groups at 90 min.\nWhen compared using the Student's t-\ntest, there was no significant difference in the\npreoperative VAS score for pain in the\nsurgical area between the two groups.\nAfter 60 min, the VAS score had decreased\nsignificantly compared with the preoperative\nvalue in both groups (Table 6), but there was\nno significant difference between the two\ngroups. In addition, there were no signifi-\ncant differences in VAS scores for pain in the\nsurgical area at all other time points (data\nnot shown).\nWhen compared using the Mann\u00ad\nWhitney U-test, there was no significant\ndifference in the VAS score for pain in the\nTable 2.

No\ncomplications at the injection site\n(haematoma or infection), neurological\ncomplications, local anaesthetic toxicity/\nallergic reactions or other complications\nwere observed in either group.\nDiscussion\nBrachial plexus block is a frequently used\nmethod of regional anaesthesia.

In a study by Casati et al.12\ninvolving 60 patients, ABPB carried out\nusing ultrasonography or PNS for nerve\nlocalization was compared in terms of the\ntime to block onset, block success, proce-\ndure-related pain and patient satisfaction;\nTable 3.

On the other hand, Bloc et al.14\ndemonstrated that ultrasonography-guided\nmethods were associated with greater\npatient satisfaction and comfort than PNS.\nIn the present study, ABPB performed\nusing PNS preceded by nerve localization\nwith a pen device was compared with PNS\nalone. A number of articles have shown that\npain at the time of peripheral nerve block is\nmostly associated with multiple electroloca-\nreported that the cause of major pain at\nthe time of the procedure was the with-\ndrawal and repositioning of the needle,\nwhereas Standl and Burmeister19 correlated\npatient dissatisfaction with repeated muscle\ncontractions and needle movements. In a\nstudy of peripheral block performed on 3996\npatients using PNS, a high success rate of up\nto 94% was obtained; however, 74% of the\npatients said that they would prefer a differ-\nent anaesthetic method next time, mainly\ndue to discomfort during performance of the\nblock.20 In the present study, the needle\ninsertion count was significantly lower in\nthe pen \u00fe group compared with the\npen \u00c0 group.\nDuring nerve localization in PNS, the\nneedle may need to be repositioned many\ntimes. Repeated insertion and withdrawal of\nthe stimulation needle and its repositioning\nin the subcutaneous tissue may alter the pain\nresistance of the patient and additional\nanalgesia/sedation may be necessary during\nTable 6.

In a study by Goldberg et al.,22\nthe techniques of transarterial fixation, par-\naesthesia and nerve stimulation were com-\npared and shown to have similar success\nrates. However, only single doses of anaes-\nthesia were used, whereas multiple injections\nmay have been more suitable.23 In a study by\nBaranowski and Pither24 comparing ABPB\nusing multiple injections guided by nerve\nstimulation or paraesthesia, no difference in\nsuccess rates was found between these tech-\nniques. However, the number of patients in\nthe PNS group was low and there were\nvariations in the number of nerves detected.23\nIn contrast, a study of 100 patients comparing\nmultiple injections guided by nerve stimula-\ntion or paraesthesia reported shorter per-\nformance times, faster onset times and higher\ncomplete block rates, particularly in the\nradial and musculocutaneous nerves, in the\nneurostimulation group.18 In the present\nstudy, complete block rates approaching\n50% were obtained in the pen\u00c0 group, with\nhigher rates of 80% in the pen \u00fe group.\nAlthough there is a theoretical risk of\nneedle trauma to nerves in ABPB, a number\nof studies have reported either no neuro-\nlogical complications15,25 or low rates of\ntemporary neurological dysfunction.20,26\nTherefore, it seems that the use of stimula-\ntion needles is not associated with increased\nnerve damage. In the present study, no nerve\ndamage was observed in either group. A\nsmall number of arterial and venous\npunctures occurred, but the rate of vascular\ncomplications was not significantly different\nin the two groups. However, ultrasonog-\nraphy has been shown to superior to PNS in\nterms of vascular complications.27\nIn contrast to studies that have compared\ndifferent nerve identification methods, the\npresent study used the same fundamental\napproach in both groups (PNS) but this was\nfacilitated by use of the pen device in the\npen \u00fe group. As the pen device is a recent\ndevelopment, very little has yet been pub-\nlished concerning its use. However, there are\na number of studies of ABPB conducted\nusing other types of percutaneous electrode\nguidance (PEG) that resemble the pen device\nin that they are simple and non-invasive.\nThe use of modified electrocardiography\nelectrodes or isolated needles has been\nshown to decrease the needle exploration\ntime and needle passage count and to reduce\nprocedure-related pain.28,29 The success rate\nof block performed following PEG using an\ninsulated needle was reported as >85% by\nCapdevila et al.9 This is similar to the block\nsuccess rate of 80% using the pen device in\nthe present study.\nThese studies with PEG suggest that\nsupporting techniques such as the pen\ndevice used in the present study could\nimprove results in terms of block perform-\nance time and patient satisfaction. However,\nWegener et al.30 have suggested that the pen\ndevice is not a reliable method compared\nwith high-resolution ultrasonography for\nnerve localization. Theoretically, the pen\ndevice works on the principle that the\nthreshold current needed to stimulate the\nnerve is dependent on the distance from\nthe electrode to the nerve.31 However, since\nelectrical resistance in biological tissues\ndemonstrates variability,32,33 this correl-\nation is not always linear.34 Thus the pen\ndevice is unlikely to be able to provide\nlocalization information as reliably as a\nmethod that generates real-time images\nsuch as ultrasonography.\nThe results of the present study, together\nwith those reported in the literature for\nother types of PEG, suggest that use of the\npen device can increase block success with\nPNS. However, further clinical studies with\na greater number of subjects are needed to\nconfirm these findings.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n\u00b4 A, Vloha JD, Kuroda MM, et al.
