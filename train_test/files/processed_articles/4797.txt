Hilsenrath, PhD1\n Keywords\ncapital expenditure, health care, stock price firm-specific information, market concentration, consolidation, investment,\nhealth sector, market signals, merger and acquisition\nOriginal Research\nIntroduction\nInvestors collect, analyze, and interpret firm-related infor-\nmation to create their own private firm-specific information.\nThis information can be about the demand for the firm's\nproducts or about strategic issues, such as competition with\nother firms.1 Informed investors trade on their private firm-\nspecific information so that this information is stored in\nstock prices as stock price firm-specific information.2 The\nfirst present direct evidence that managers learn from this\ninformation is in capital expenditure (CAPEX) decisions.1\nStock price firm-specific information significantly increases\nthe sensitivity of CAPEX to Tobin's Q, the stock price\u00adbased\nmeasure of the value of firm fundamentals, suggesting that\nstock price firm-specific information provides managers new\ninformation in their decision making. In other words, manag-\ners learn from financial markets.1\nSome may wonder why outside investors possess firm-\nspecific information that managers, who run the business\ndaily, do not have. We do not argue that managers know less\nthan outside investors do. However, it is possible that manag-\ners do not possess every piece of information related to firm\nvaluation. A firm's valuation depends not only on internal\ninformation about business operations but also on external\ninformation, such as the state of the economy, the position of\ncompetitors, the demand by consumers, and so on.3 Outside\ninvestors discipline the market and related information can\nbe useful to managers. Stock prices aggregate many inves-\ntors' information offering considerable firm-specific infor-\nmation not known by managers.\nRecently, the stream of literature about manager learning\nfrom financial markets has grown rapidly. It extends from\nCAPEX to cash savings, dividend payments, seasoned equity\nissuance, labor investment, and M&A investment.4-10 These\nstudies argue that when stock prices reflect more firm-spe-\ncific information, managers make corporate decisions that\nare more aligned with the value of firm fundamentals and\ntherefore achieve higher operating performance. Among all\nthese studies on stock price informativeness, no such study\nhas focused on a particular industry. This article aims to fill\nthis gap with a health care focus.\nOur research question is whether managers in the health\ncare industry learn from financial markets in making\ninvestment decisions. Insider trading is widely understood,\nbut we explore what in some respects is the reverse of insider\ntrading, where public information is profitably employed by\n1University of the Pacific, Stockton, CA, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nPeter E.

We not only examine CAPEX investments\nbut also investments through M&A deals. The article goes\nbeyond reporting health care specific financial analysis. It is\ntranslational research with the objective of informing the\nhealth care management community of relevant develop-\nments in the field of academic finance. It is an effort to cross-\nfertilize the silos that too often divide us.\nUsing a sample of 2256 firm-year observations during the\ncific information increases the sensitivity of both CAPEX\nand M&A to Tobin's Q. The results provide novel industry-\nlevel evidence to the literature that managers in the health\ncare industry learn from financial markets. As the health care\nindustry is heterogeneous and includes important subsectors,\nwe split the industry into 3 subsectors--Drugs, Health\nServices, and Medical Equipment and Supplies. We find that\nin the Drugs subsector, both CAPEX and M&A investment\nincrease sensitivity to Q when stock prices are more informa-\ntive. However, this relation holds in M&Ainvestment only in\nHealth Services and does not hold at all in Medical Equipment\nand Supplies. After comparing firm characteristics, we find\nthat firms in the Drugs subsector have the highest stock price\nfirm-specific information and least managerial private infor-\nmation. Therefore, managers in a better information environ-\nment are more likely to believe the information creation\nability of financial markets. In addition, Drug firms are much\nlarger than those in the other 2 subsectors, which may moti-\nvate managers to learn from the market.\nThis article is the first to address managerial learning\nfrom financial markets in the health care industry. Financial\nmarkets bridge managers with investors who do not always\nhave direct communication with management. Previous\nstudies show that inside managers possess more firm-spe-\ncific information and information flows from inside manag-\ners to outside investors through announcement of\nfirm-specific issues such as earnings announcements and\nequity issuance.11,12 We argue that the information flow can\nalso be the other way around from outside investors to inside\nmanagers. Possessing more complete knowledge from finan-\ncial markets can help health care managers improve decision\nmaking.\nData and Methods\nWe begin our sample collection from the entire universe of\nstocks found in COMPUSTAT/Center for Research in\nSecurity Prices (CRSP) database. We define the health care\nindustry using the health care industry classification in\nFama-French 12 industry definition. Furthermore, we define\nsubsectors following the Standard Industrial Code (SIC) def-\ninition in the SIC Manual from US Department of Labor\nDrugs subsector. This includes the following nomenclature:\nMedicinal Chemicals & Botanical Products, Pharmaceutical\nPreparations, In Vitro & In Vivo Diagnostic Substances, and\ndefine Medical Equipment and Supplies. The nomenclature\nhere includes the following: Surgical & Medical Instruments\n& Apparatus Orthopedic, Prosthetic & Surgical Appliances\n& Supplies, Dental Equipment & Supplies, X-RayApparatus\n& Tubes & Related Irradiation Apparatus, and Electro\nMedical & Electrotherapeutic Apparatus. SIC codes 8000 to\n8099 define Health Services. This nomenclature includes the\nfollowing: Offices & Clinics of Doctors of Medicine;\nNursing & Personal Care Facilities; Skilled Nursing Care\nFacilities; Hospitals; Medical Laboratories; Home Health\nCare; Misc. Health & Allied Services, NEC; and Specialty\nOutpatient Facilities, NEC. These 3 subsectors compose the\nhealth care industry. Firms with negative capital expenditure\nor negative acquisition are excluded as are those with less\nthan $10 million book value. To avoid extreme values, firms\nwithTobin's Q greater than 100 or less than zero are excluded.\nTable 1 lists the sample distribution and descriptive statistics\nfor the sample of 2256 firm-year observations in the health\nWe measure M&A investment with COMPUSTAT item\n129 and measure CAPEX investment using COMPUSTAT\ninformation is stock return nonsynchronicity (). It equals\nlog [(1 - R2) / R2], where R2 derives from specification (1):\nit ft mt ft jt ft it\n- = + \u00d7 -\n( )+ \u00d7 -\n( )+\nwhere R\nit\nis firm i's daily stock return, R\nft\nis the daily risk-free\nreturn measured by the 1-month Treasury bill rate, R\nmt\nis the\ndaily market value-weighted return on all New York Stock\nExchange (NYSE), American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and\nNational Association of Security Dealers Automated\nQuotations (NASDAQ) stocks (from CRSP), and R\njt\nis the\ndaily value-weighted return of the SIC 3-digit industry.\nThis model is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)\ncontrolling for industry return. It splits the variation of a\nstock return into 3 components: a market-related variation,\nan industry-related variation, and a firm-specific variation.\nAs prices move in response to new information, stock price\nmovements should reflect new market, industry, and firm-\nspecific information. Under the standard theoretical frame-\nwork of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, price movements\nshould reflect all related information. If there is no public\nnews announcement of any kind about a firm, its stock price\nmovements are completely attributable to market and indus-\ntry news. That is, the R2 of the specification (1) shall be 1.\nHowever, the R2 increases marginally when excluding dates\nwhen firm-specific news is publicly released, indicating that\nstock return nonsynchronicity (1 - R2) may reflect investors'\nprivate firm-specific information.2 Empirical evidence pro-\nvides strong support that stock return nonsynchronicity\nincreases with informed trading profit and decreases with\ninformation collection and trading cost, suggesting that it\nOuyang and Hilsenrath 3\nproxies for investors'private firm-specific information about\nAs (1 - R2) is skewed, we employ logistic transformation\nof the ratio (1 - R2) / R2.17 Recent studies employ similar\nmeasures of stock return nonsynchronicity to proxy for stock\n100 daily stock return observations during the last fiscal year\nto ensure explanatory power. One concern of our study is\nwhether the primary results are sensitive to the particular\nmeasure of stock price informativeness. In unreported tests,\nwe rerun the regressions using the stock return nonsyn-\nchronicity including Fama-French 3 factors and the momen-\ntum factor in the market model or including lagged market\nand industry returns in the model. We also employ the mea-\nsure when cumulating the returns in days where no trading\ntook place to account for infrequent trading of daily fre-\nquency returns. Our results hold when using these alternative\nmeasures.\nTobin's Q is measured as the ratio of market-to-book\nvalue of assets. The market value of assets is comprised of\nthe value of assets in place and the present value of growth\nopportunities. If Tobin's Q is greater than 1, it suggests that\nthe firm has positive net present value growth opportunities.\nTherefore, higher Tobin's Q suggests a firm has more growth\nopportunities. The Q-theory of investment argues that the\nfirm's investment rate should rise with its Q.23 M&A is\nTable 1.

Because managers\npresumably know the accounting numbers beforehand, the\nearnings' surprise can be a reasonable measure of manage-\nrial private information. We control for firm size since\nsmaller firms tend to have higher stock return nonsyn-\nchronicity and they are less likely to have resources other\nthan equity to finance large acquisitions. We need to address\nthe concern that our main results are not driven by the firm\nsize effect. We also include controls of firm leverage and\ncash holdings as high leverage can lead to underinvestment\nand excess cash flow can cause over-investment.25,26 All\nthese variables are measured at the previous fiscal year. The\nsupplementary material provides a detailed explanation of\neach variable.\nOuyang and Hilsenrath 5\nResults and Discussion\nTable 1 presents basic statistics for the main variables in each\nhealth care subsector as well as in the whole health care\nindustry. The average M&A investment accounts for 10.55%\nof total book assets in the health care industry. Health\nServices has the highest M&A investment (11.77%), signifi-\ncant at 1% level. The average CAPEX investment accounts\nfor 5.55% of book assets in the health care industry, much\nlower than M&A investment. Among the 3 subsectors,\nHealth Services has higher CAPEX investment, significant\nat 1%. Tobin's Q is highest in the Drugs and lowest in Health\nServices, significant at 1%. Stock return nonsynchronicity is\nhighest in Medical Equipment and Supplies. However, as it\nis negatively correlated with firm size (coefficient, -0.66; P\n< .01), we split firm size and rank stock return nonsyn-\nchronicity into quintiles. The average ranking of stock return\nnonsynchronicity in Drugs becomes the highest, and signifi-\ncant at 1%. Firms in the Drugs category have the biggest\nsize, lowest managerial private information, and highest cash\nflow. Firms in Medical Equipment and Supplies have the\nlowest leverage ratio. It is important to note the heterogene-\nity of the 3 subsectors. The Drugs subsector enjoys patent\nprotection for much of its revenue and is very much a\nfor-profit arena. To some extent, this applies to Medical\nEquipment and Supplies as well. But Health Services com-\npetes differently and includes a substantial nonprofit element\nwhich is not directly observed in this study because of the\nnature of our data.\nTable 2 presents estimation results from ordinary least\nsquares (OLS) regressions. Panel A reports the whole sam-\nple. Results show both CAPEX and M&A investments\nincrease with Q. Stock price informativeness () increases\nsensitivity of internal capital investment to Q, suggesting\nmanagers learn from financial markets in making CAPEX\ninvestment. Moreover,  increases sensitivity of M&A\ninvestment to Q, suggesting managers learn from financial\nmarkets in making M&A investment decisions. The coeffi-\ncient of managerial private information and Q (AI \u00d7 Q) is not\nstatistically significant. The last 3 columns of Table 2 show\ntotal investment also becomes more sensitive to Q because of\nhigher stock price informativeness.\nPanel B in Table 2 shows estimation results in each indus-\ntry subsector. Due to limited space, we only report the coef-\nficient estimates of  \u00d7 Q using the same regression models\nas in panel A. These regression models are models (3), (6),\nand (9). In the Drugs category, findings indicate managers\nlearn from financial markets in both CAPEX and M&A\ninvestments. This observation is not surprising as Table 1\nshows firms in this subsector have the largest size, highest\nstock price informativeness, and lowest managerial private\ninformation. Managers in Health Services appear to only\nlearn from the market in making M&A investment decisions.\nManagers tend to be more receptive to financial markets in\nmaking these strategic decisions perhaps because Health\nServices has the highest level of M&A investment. In\nMedical Equipment and Supplies, stock price informative-\nness does not affect the sensitivity of CAPEX or M&A to Q.\nIf managers learn from financial markets, we would expect\nmore informed decisions aligned with firm fundamentals and\nimproved future firm performance. In Table 3, we test the rela-\ntion between stock price firm-specific information and future\noperating performance including return-on-asset (ROA), sales\nincrease, and asset turnover. ROA measures total asset profit-\nability, Sales Increase measures sales revenue growth, andAsset\nTurnover measures total asset management efficiency. We did\nnot use  \u00d7 Q but  directly because managerial learning should\nbenefit firm performance for both high and low Q firms. For\nhigh Q firms, managerial learning helps to increase investment\nto achieve growth opportunities; for low Q firms, managerial\nlearning helps to curb overinvestment, which also helps to\nimprove firm performance. We find that stock price firm-spe-\ncific information consistently increases future operating perfor-\nmance. This observation is consistent with the managerial\nlearning argument. In unreported tests, we find that stock price\nfirm-specific information increases future asset turnover and\nROA, respectively, in Drugs and Health Services, supporting\nthe argument that manager learning improves future firm per-\nformance. In Medical Equipment and Supplies, we find that\nTable 3. Future Firm Performance and Stock Price\nInformativeness.\nFuture\nreturn-on-asset\nFuture sales\nincrease\nFuture asset\nturnover\nNote.

Results suggest stock price informativeness affects\nfuture firm performance through channels other than manager\nConclusions\nThis article presents new evidence that managers in health\ncare learn from financial markets in making organizational\ndecisions about CAPEX and M&A investment. We find both\nCAPEX and M&A investment become more sensitive to Q\nwhen stock prices are more informative of firm-specific\ninformation. Results suggest financial markets provide man-\nagers new information about the value of firm fundamentals\nso that managers are more likely to invest through M&A and\nCAPEX when informed stock prices are higher. Further anal-\nysis shows managerial learning from financial markets\nimproves future firm operating performance. Among the 3\nindustry subsectors, managers in the Drug subsector are most\nlikely to learn because firms in this sector have the highest\nstock price information and lowest managerial private infor-\nmation. Managers in Health Services tend to learn only for\nM&A investment. This subsector also has the highest per-\ncentage of investment through M&A.\nThere is much concern about consolidation and market\npower in health care, especially in the wake of theAffordable\nCare Act which facilitates clinical and financial integration.\nThe purpose of integration is to improve efficiency and\navoid \"tragedy of the commons\" thought to be behind\npoor cost and outcome performance in the United States.30\nUnfortunately, integration is also associated with consolida-\ntion and higher levels of market power. The result may yield\ngreater productive efficiency but higher allocative ineffi-\nciency.31,32 Economists and others have been concerned\nabout social welfare and monopoly since at least the time of\nAdam Smith. Yet, most of the related literature, especially in\nhealth care, does not fully explore mechanisms by which\nmanagers invest and acquire to gain efficiency in production\nand/or market power. This article helps fills the void and may\nserve to stimulate further research in this arena.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nSupplementary Material\nThe supplementary materials are available at http://journals.sage\nReferences\n1.
