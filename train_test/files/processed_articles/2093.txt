Excess fatness\nin most epidemiologic studies has been defined on the basis of\noverweight or obese BMI (in kg/m2) criteria developed by the\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (6, 7). However, it has\noften been debated whether BMI represents body fat adequately\n(8\u00ad11). For example, although the relation of mortality and\ncomorbidities with BMI is well recognized as J-shaped (3), risk\nof mortality could monotonically increase with fat mass (12\u00ad14).\nTherefore, it remains an open question as to whether the defi-\nnition of human obesity should be based on BMI or body fat.\nThere have been considerable efforts aimed at linking BMI\nwith the percentage of body fat on relatively small sample sizes\nwith varied body-composition measurements (15\u00ad21). However,\namong these efforts, Gallagher et al (21) used the percentage\nof body fat measured by DXA5, which has been accepted as\na reference method of body-composition measurement for large-\nscale studies and proposed an approach for the development of\nguidelines that predict the percentage of body fat on the basis of\nBMI from a relatively large, if convenient, sample size. For this\nreason, estimates of percentage of body fat of Gallagher et al\n(21) have served as percentage of body fat ranges for research\npurpose (see, eg, reference 22). Nevertheless, there exists no\nconsensus of percentage of body fat criteria to define obesity or\nexcess percentage of body fat (23) despite that the American\nAssociation of Clinical Endocrinology/American College of En-\ndocrinology suggested 25% and 35% of body fat as cutoffs for\nobesity in men and women, respectively (24).\nThe NHANES had begun to use DXA scanners to measure\ntotal body fat and, thus, the percentage of body fat since 1999\nwhen it became a biannual regular survey. This introduction of\na reference measurement method in the NHANES offers an\nimportant opportunity to further develop and update predic-\ntions of the percentage of body fat on the basis of BMI with in\nvivo body fat measured by using DXA from an unprecedented\nnationally representative large-size sample.

These developed cutoffs of percentage of body fat were\nstratified by sex, age, and race-ethnicity by using the NHANES\nWe used adult subjects aged 18 y from the US NHANES\n2004. Subjects were measured in vivo for regional body fat dis-\ntributions by using DXA scanners in mobile examination centers.\nA Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer (Hologic Inc)\nsoftware version 8.26:a3* (Hologic Inc). Because the algorithm of\nthe QDR-4500A densitometer (Hologic Inc) overestimated lean\nmass by 5 6 1% (25), the NHANES DXA lean mass was de-\ncreased by 5%, and an equivalent kilogram weight was added to\nthe fat mass without affecting the total mass (26). However, self-\nreported pregnant women (even those women with negative\npregnancy test results), and subjects heavier than 300 lb (136 kg)\nor taller than 6 ft 5 in (195 cm) were excluded from the DXA\nmeasurement on the basis of NHANES criteria (27). Anthropo-\nmetric measures were also available including measured height\nand weight with BMI calculated as weight (in kg) divided by\nheight (in m2), which was used for the current study.\nWith respect to missing data, ;22% of subjects in the\nfat measurement that was due to invalid DXA scanning (28).\nReasons for missing data included, but were not limited to,\nmeeting aforementioned exclusion criteria, the presence of certain\nnonremovable objects (eg, prostheses), excess X-ray noise, and\n2004 generated 5 imputed data sets for missing DXA regional\nbody-composition measurements; imputation for missing DXA\ndata in later NHANES surveys are currently ongoing (28). Nev-\nertheless, imputation was not applied to pregnant women or to\nsubjects with amputated body parts and, thus, these subjects were\nexcluded from the current study. Also excluded were subjects\nwho had incomplete anthropometric BMI measurements and\nhighly variable imputed DXA measurements.

The percentage body fat\ndiffers between men and women (21) and is also associated\nwith ethnicity (29). In this study, we considered the following\nNHANES race-ethnicity classifications (with the NHANES\nvariable name RIDRETH1) categorized by the NHANES: NHW,\nNHB, and MEX who are Hispanic and of Mexican origin. Other\nHispanics and other racial-ethnic and multi-racial groups were\nexcluded because of very small sample sizes.\nAge was categorized into the following 3 groups: 18\u00ad29,\nfollowing considerations: 1) total potassium declines after ;30 y\nof age in both men and women (30); 2) age of 50 y is approx-\nimately when women progress into menopause, which affects\nbody fat mass (31); and 3) unweighted sample sizes are ap-\nproximately equal across the 3 age groups for both men and\nwomen in all ethnic groups except NHW who include more\nolder subjects than other groups.

Therefore, by adhering to the analytic guidelines sug-\ngested by the NHANES (32), we took into account sampling\nstrata, the primary sampling unit, and individual sampling\nweights for descriptive and inferential statistical analyses by\nSURVEYREG with SAS v9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc). Statistical\nanalyses were applied to each of 5 imputed data sets, which\nyielded 5 sets of results from which final results were obtained on\nthe basis of a pooling method proposed by Rubin (33) by applying\nSAS PROC MIANALYZE (SAS Institute Inc). For descriptive\nstatistics, we reported the mean and SEM. For inferential sta-\ntistics, we reported estimated regression coefficients and SEs.\nGraphical presentations and a lowess fit (34) were performed by\nusing S-plus v8.1.1 (TIBCO Software Inc).\nDeterminations of ranges of percentage of body fat\nFirst, we inspected a scatter plot of percentage of body fat\ncompared with BMI for men and women and showed that the\nrelation between them was apparently nonlinear as shown by the\nlowess fit (Figure 1). The nonlinear pattern of the relation was\nconsistent across the 9 combinations of age and ethnicity strata\nin both men and women. To linearize the relation, we trans-\nformed BMI into the inverse BMI (ie, 1 4 BMI). The linearity\nof 1 4 BMI was apparent on the basis of the lowess fits (Figure\nselected subjects for each sex from the first imputed data set.\nHowever, the lowess fits were based on entire subjects for each\nsex. Again, the linear pattern was consistent across the combi-\nnations of the strata. Therefore, we fit the simple linear model\nPercentage of body fat \u00bc b\n\u00fe b\nwith SAS PROC SURVEYREG (SAS Institute Inc). Goodness\nof fit was quantified by R2, which was a square of the correlation\nr between percentage of body fat and 1 4 BMI. We determined\ncutoffs of percentage of body fat by replacing BMI with cor-\nresponding BMI cutoffs in the prediction equations:\nPercentage of body fat \u00bc b\n\u00fe b\nPercentage of body fat \u00bc b\n\u00fe b\nPercentage of body fat \u00bc b\n\u00fe b\nPercentage of body fat \u00bc b\n\u00fe b\nand\nPercentage of body fat \u00bc b\n\u00fe b\nFinally, on the basis of estimated cutoffs, we estimated the\nsex-age-race-ethnicity\u00adspecific population-level prevalence of\nsubjects who were conditionally BMI\u00adpercentage of body fat\ndiscordant. Specifically, we estimated the prevalence of subjects\nwhose percentage of body fat was greater than or equal to the sex-\nage-race-ethnicity\u00adspecific cutoffs that corresponding to a BMI\nrespectively.\nRESULTS\nDescriptive statistics\nSubject characteristics are described in Table 2. NHW and\nMEX subjects were the oldest and youngest, respectively, in\nboth sexes. In men, the percentage of body fat was the lowest in\nthe NHB group despite that BMI was comparable across the 3\nracial-ethnic groups, and NHB subjects were older than MEX\nsubjects. In women, however, the difference in percentage of\nbody fat was not biologically meaningful, if significant, across\nthe 3 groups despite that the NHB group had the greatest BMI,\nand MEX subjects were the youngest.\nPrediction equations\nEstimated regression coefficients of Equation 1 along with\nthe sample size used in each stratum categorized by sex, age,\nPrediction equations on the basis of estimated coefficients in the regression\nform of percentage of body fat = b0\nAge and\nrace-ethnicity n b0\nMen\nWomen\nAll results were based on the pooling of results from the 5 sets of National\nCenter for Health Statistics\u00adimputed data and were obtained with NHANES\nsampling design effects taken into account.

The predicted relation be-\ntween the percentage of body fat and BMI is depicted in Figure\n3, which shows that the relation depended on age and race-\nethnicity in both men and women. Intercept estimates and slope\nestimates differed across the strata. However, the estimated re-\ngression coefficient b1\nwas significantly ,0 across all strata\ndefined by sex, age, and race-ethnicity, which supported that the\npercentage of body fat is an increasing function of BMI with an\nupper limit. All of the estimated coefficients were significant at\nand race-ethnicity. Although R2 was slightly higher in women,\nnegative changes in the percentage of body fat per unit change\nin 1 4 BMI (and, thus, positive changes per BMI) were greater\nin men in MEX subjects regardless of age and in 18\u00ad29- and\n50\u00ad84-y-old NHW subjects (Table 3). In contrast, the changes\nwere smaller in men in NHB subjects regardless of age.\nPredicted percentage of body fat and its cutoffs\nCutoffs of percentage of body fat predicted on the basis of the\nestimated equation presented in Table 3 are shown in Table 4.\nAcross age and racial-ethnic groups, cutoffs of percentage of\nwomen, cutoffs for these same BMI values ranged from 24.6%\nmen, fat cutoffs of percentage of body fat that corresponded to\n(50\u00ad84-y-old NHWs), whereas for women, cutoffs ranged from\nAdditional inspection of Table 4 and Figure 3 revealed the\nfollowing patterns. First, cutoffs of percentage of body fat were\nhighest in the oldest age group regardless of sex and race-ethnicity.\nCutoffs of percentage of body fat monotonically increased with age\nin NHWand NHB subjects, except for in NHW men with a BMI of\n40. However, in MEX subjects the mid 30\u00ad49-y-old group had the\nlowest cutoffs of percentage of body fat for BMI 30 for both men\nand women (Table 4). Furthermore, in MEX men, the youngest\ngroup (ie, age 18\u00ad29 y) had the highest predicted percentage of\nbody fat for BMI .45 (Figure 3). Second, with respect to racial-\nethnic differences in percentage of body fat, NHB subjects had\na lower percentage of body fat for the same BMI compared with\nthat of NHW and MEX subjects regardless of age and sex. Third,\ncutoffs of percentage of body fat were higher in women than\nin men for any given BMI regardless of age and race-ethnicity\n(Figure 3).\nFinally, with regard to the predicted percentage of body fat\u00ad\nBMI association, changes in the predicted percentage of body fat\nper BMI unit change were relatively smaller for larger BMIs. This\nresult was due to the slopes of the tangent lines of the estimates\ncurves that declined with increasing BMI. This relation was also\nreflected on the lowess curves, which showed that the percentage\nof body fat bent downward after a BMI of ;30 for both men and\nwomen (Figure 1). As could be inferred from Table 4 or from\nthe prediction equations, rates of change in percentage of body\nFIGURE 3.

Furthermore, for\nevery BMI interval, percentage of body fat changes per BMI\nunit decreased with increasing age within each race-ethnicity for\nboth men and women.\nPrevalence of subjects who were conditionally\nBMI\u00adpercentage of body fat discordant\nThe population level\u00adweighted prevalence estimates of sub-\njects who were conditionally BMI\u00adpercentage of body fat dis-\ncordant is presented in Table 5. In general, prevalence estimates\nwere associated with the 3 demographic factors. The prevalence\nalence was higher in older subjects regardless of sex and BMI.\nThe prevalence was the lowest in the NHW group for women\nregardless of age and BMI levels. For the lower BMI of 25, the\nprevalence was the lowest in NHB group for men. Overall, the\nprevalence depended on the 3 demographic factors considered in\nthis study.\nDISCUSSION\nThe principal finding of this study was that cutoffs of per-\ncentage of body fat that corresponded to BMI cutoffs sub-\nstantially varied depending on age, sex, and race-ethnicity, which\nare perhaps the most representative demographic factors. Spe-\ncifically, the cutoff of percentage of body fat was the highest for\nthe same BMI in the oldest age group, was the lowest in NHB\nsubjects, and was higher in women (Tables 3 and 4). The relation\nbetween BMI and the predicted percentage of body fat was\nassociated with different racial-ethnic backgrounds (Figure 3).\nThese findings were consistent with those from numerous pre-\nvious studies. For example, ethnic differences in DXA-measured\npercentage of body fat for BMI in young men and women were\nalso noted by Jackson et al (35) in a recent study. Therefore, these\nfactors should be taken into consideration in clinical settings\nwhen body-composition measurements are evaluated. At the\nsame time, unlike BMI, anticipated clinical guidelines con-\ncerning body fat should be flexible on the basis of those factors.\nTo this end, we believe that the developed prediction equations\n(Table 3) with high R2 may have primary clinical usefulness\nbecause they are very simple to apply and useful to predict\npercentage of body fat for any given BMI. Furthermore, more\ncareful clinical attention and/or an additional medical exami-\nnation may be warranted for subjects who are conditionally\nBMI\u00adpercentage of body fat discordant whose BMI is lower but\nwith a higher percentage of body fat as presented in Table 5.\nThe finding that the percentage of body fat is a nonlinear\nfunction of BMI does not necessarily imply that allocations of\nweight gain to body composition are not necessarily proportional\nas far as fat increases are concerned. Strong linear relations\nbetween BMI and both fat mass and fat-free mass were observed\nCutoffs of percentage of body fat in reference to BMI cutoffs (in kg/m2) in men and women1\nAge and race-ethnicity\nCutoffs of percentage of body fat\nMen\nWomen\n1 Cutoffs were determined on the basis of estimated prediction equations presented in Table 2.

Nevertheless, the percentage of body fat\nappears to change at a BMI of ;30 kg/m2, after which the\npercentage of body fat tends to plateau in men and women\n(Figures 1 and 3). Furthermore, the percentage of body fat ap-\npears to be 50% and 60% in men and women, respectively\n(Figure 1). Indeed, the estimated intercepts (Table 3) serve as\nupper bounds, or asymptotes, for the percentage of body fat at\nvery large BMI values. Therefore, the percentage of body fat is\nlimited by ;55% and ;65%, which were the greatest intercept\nestimates, in men and women, respectively, regardless of eth-\nnicity, age, and BMI. Of note, the addition of the 14 BMI2 term\nto the simple Equation 1 models did not substantially, although\nsignificant in some cases, increase R2 in either men or women.\nHowever, the majority of previous prediction equations had\nbeen based on an assumed linear relation between the percentage\nof body fat and BMI (16\u00ad20), although studies tried to fit non-\nlinear equations. For example, Jackson et al (15) used the log\nBMI with percentage of body fat on the basis of underwater\nweighing, and Gallagher et al (21) used 1 4 BMI with the DXA-\nmeasured percentage of body fat. The approach of Gallagher\net al (21) is the same as that applied in the current study and,\nthus, makes comparison feasible. Compared with the cutoffs\nreported in Gallagher et al (21), the current cutoffs of percentage\nof body fat tend to be higher, especially in younger groups,\nregardless of age, sex, and ethnicity. For example, the percent-\nage of body fat that corresponded to a BMI of 25 for subjects\nAfrican American women, respectively, in Gallagher et al (21)\n[Table 3 in Gallagher et al (21)], whereas our newly developed\ncutoffs of percentage of body fat are ;35% and ;37% in\nNHWs and NHBs, respectively, for people aged 18\u00ad50 y (Table\n4). The underlying reasons for the overall increase in percentage\nof body fat for the same BMI are unknown even if the samples\nwere different between our study and the study of Gallagher et al\n(21). Potential causes include variation in DXA system cali-\nmass was increased by 5% as previously mentioned), sample-\ncharacteristic differences, and ecologic factors such as secular\ntrends in diet and activity levels and their translation into body-\ncomposition effects.\nFlegal et al (36) also reported the relation between the per-\nfor subjects aged 20 y. However, Flegal et al (36) applied an\nempirical approach on the basis of descriptive statistics, which\nwas not model based and, therefore, differs from other ap-\nproaches in the literature including ours used in the current\nstudy. Specifically, Flegal et al (36) matched weighted percen-\ntiles of the percentage of body fat with those of BMI in an age-\nand sex-specific fashion by using percentiles of the percentage\nof body fat as the reference (in contrast, we used BMI cutoffs as\nreferences). Although the approach of Flegal et al (36) could\nprovide more accurate BMI values that correspond to given\nintervals of percentage of body fat and age, it does not provide\nPopulation-level sex-age-race-ethnicity\u00adspecific prevalence estimates of subjects who were conditionally\nBMI\u00adpercentage of body fat discordant1\nRace-ethnicity\nPercentage of body fat greater than or equal to cutoffs\ncorresponding to BMI (in kg/m2) of 25 in subjects\nMen aged\nWomen aged\nPercentage of body fat greater than or equal to cutoffs\ncorresponding to BMI of 30 in subjects with\nMen aged\nWomen aged\n1 All values are prevalences (%) 6 SEs.

Despite these\ndifferent approaches, both approaches agree on a similar con-\nclusion that the BMI\u00adpercentage of body fat relation varies by\nage, sex, and race-ethnicity.\nThe DXA method is not available in most primary care clinical\nsettings, although it is primarily used in research settings. An-\nthropometric indicators such as BMI and skinfold thickness\nmeasurements are frequently used to derive estimates of per-\ncentage of body fat, perhaps primarily because of the little cost\nand ease of measurement (37). For this reason, these methods and\nothers, such as bioimpedance analysis, are used for screening\npurposes followed by more precise and sophisticated, and\nyet costly, methods that include DXA, computed tomography,\nand MRI (38). Although DXA systems often provide slightly\ndifferent values for the percentage of body fat, as do all cross-\nevaluated body-composition methods, the NHANES DXA-\nmeasurement and -calibration approaches are extremely well\ndocumented in publications and on the Web and, thus, are\ncomparable and reliable. Nevertheless, because the ranges of\npercentage of body fat in the current report were developed with\na specific DXA system and related calibration (39), it is important\nthat the estimates of percentage of body fat provided by other\navailable clinical and research methods, including other DXA\nsystems, are calibrated to the values acquired in NHANES.\nOtherwise, the ranges of NHANES percentage of body fat will\nnot be reliable when applied in these settings. Therefore, although\ncorrelations among DXA systems for values of percentage of\nbody fat are significant (40), an important need exists for stan-\ndardization of the percentage of body fat, which we believe\nremains as an important issue in the field.\nThe current study had limitations. First, the developed ranges\nof percentage of body fat were not developed on the basis of\ncomorbidity and mortality outcomes. Therefore, risk ratios across\ncutoffs of percentage of body fat are not known, and it is also\nunknown if the developed cutoffs are optimal for maximizing\nsensitivity and specificity in diagnosing comorbidities. Once\ndeveloped on the basis of comorbidity and mortality outcomes,\nsuch cutoffs of percentage of body fat will undoubtedly have\ngreater clinical use. Nevertheless, the choice of comorbid health\noutcomes is both important and complicated; it will require long-\nterm follow-up of NHANES subjects for reliable assessments of\ndata included pediatric sample with subjects ,18 y old, we did\nnot attempt to develop prediction equations because the de-\nvelopment of weight status criteria on the basis of cutoffs of\npercentage of body fat in the pediatric population should be\nbased on population percentiles of percentage of body fat (41) as\nwas adopted for the development of weight-status criteria on the\nbasis of BMI percentiles. Because the pediatric population,\nunfortunately, does not have well-established cutoffs of per-\ncentage of body fat that define normal weight and obesity (42),\na future study should address this issue. Third, the percentage of\nbody fat\u00adBMI relation may depend on the age within each age\nstratum; especially in older participants within the 50\u00ad84-y-old\nage stratum as noted by Flegal et al (36).\nIn conclusion, NHANES cutoffs of percentage of body fat as\ndeveloped in the current report can serve as a useful research and\nclinical tool. Future studies are appropriate for continually\nupdating the DXA database on nationally representative samples\nand to further explore topics such as the development of body-\ncomposition ranges in relation to morbidity and mortality in both\nadult and pediatric populations.\nWe are grateful to the anonymous reviewers for their valuable suggestions\nthat resulted in a great improvement of the manuscript.\nThe authors' responsibilities were as follows--MH and SHB: conceived and\ndesigned the study; MH: acquired data, conducted statistical analyses, and had\nprimary responsibility for the final content of the manuscript; MH, MSF, and\nSBH: analyzed and interpreted data; MH, AP, and SBH: drafted the manu-\nscript; and all authors: read, provided critical revisions to, and approved the\nfinal manuscript.
