The\nphrase would later become the defining mantra of David\nCameron's coalition government (d'Ancona, 2013).\nHowever, the idea of being `in it together' is not only a\nrhetorical device for justifying difficult decisions; it is also\nan age-old principle at the heart of representative democ-\nracy. The presence of some `communion of interest and\nsympathy in feelings and desires' was central to Edmund\nBurke's conception of `virtual representation'(Judge, 1999:\n101), while James Madison in Federalist No. 57 insisted\nthat without a `communion of interests and sympathy of\nsentiments... every government degenerates into tyranny.'\nThe centrality of shared experiences is also reflected in\nrecent scholarship about the political representation of\ngroups in contemporary Britain and elsewhere (Campbell\net\npoliticians recognise, perceptions of solidarity are an\nimportant reality of their own. Citizens who believe that\ntheir leaders have different interests may punish them at the\nballot box, and may even become disenchanted with demo-\ncratic processes.\nThis paper explores the extent to which Britons perceive\na `communion of interests'between themselves and elected\npoliticians in general, focusing specifically on Members of\nParliament (MPs). It further explores the relationship\nbetween these perceptions and indicators of specific and\ndiffuse political support (Easton, 1975). A number of com-\nmentators have suggested that Britain is witnessing the\nemergence of a disconnected political class (Oborne, 2007;\nRiddell, 2012).

Capturing such perceptions is likely\nto be important for scholars who wish to understand popu-\nlar evaluations of political processes. If voters do not think\nthat politicians share their experiences, they may feel\nunrepresented; they may even think that politicians are una-\nble to represent them. Drawing on new survey data, we\ndemonstrate the importance of this dimension of represen-\ntation in Britain. We show that citizens generally say that\npoliticians are less affected by social and economic condi-\ntions and are less reliant on public services than they are,\nand that the size of this perceived `discommunion' affects\nturnout, support for the incumbent government and satis-\nfaction with democracy.\nRepresentation and interests\nScholarly interest in political representation has generated a\nvast and varied literature. Our study is broadly concerned\nwith an aspect of what Pitkin (1967) terms `descriptive rep-\nresentation.' This view of representation focuses on the\ncharacteristics of representative agents, usually members of\nlegislative institutions. It is characterised by the notion\n`that a representative body is distinguished by an accurate\ncorrespondence or resemblance to what it represents, by\nreflecting without distortion' (Pitkin, 1967: 60). Calls for\nmore accurate correspondences or resemblances between\ncitizens and political elites are frequently heard in Britain\nand elsewhere. These calls are often made specifically to\nhelp politically disadvantaged groups, notably women and\nethnic minorities, overcome adverse selection biases\nThe `descriptive representativeness' of elected repre-\nsentatives does not refer only to their visible characteris-\nto the experiences they share with other members of the\ncommunity: thus `a representative with a background in\nfarming is to that degree a descriptive representative of his\nor her farmer constituents.' Shared experiences are espe-\ncially important because they facilitate policy responsive-\nness, or what is usually termed `substantive representation'\n`shared experience... might reasonably expect to promote a\nrepresentative's accurate representation of and commit-\nment to constituent interests.' Certain visible characteris-\ntics, notably gender and race, can exert a powerful influence\non a representative's ability to share experiences. For these\nreasons, many scholars have concluded that descriptive\nrepresentation improves the chances of substantive repre-\nWhile the descriptive representativeness of political\ninstitutions can have profound consequences, so too can\npopular perceptions of the same. There is good evidence,\nfrom Britain and elsewhere, that citizens generally want\nrepresentatives who are `like them,' either in appearance or\nthought, who are local, and who have experienced what\nthey have experienced (Arzheimer and Evans, 2012;\nCutler, 2002). There is also good evidence that higher lev-\nels of perceived descriptive representativeness can forge\n`bonds of trust' between citizens and their representatives\nlegitimacy of political institutions (Sawer, 2000); and can\nstrengthen perceptions of policy responsiveness (Schwindt-\nBayer and Mishler, 2005). Yet such evidence, especially in\nterms of how perceptions translate into action, generally\npertains to the perceived representativeness of politicians'\nvisible characteristics, not their experiences. Perceptions of\npoliticians' experiences, however, are also likely to shape\ncitizens' beliefs about representatives' abilities to promote\ntheir interests, and are thus likely to shape citizens'satisfac-\ntion with incumbent authorities and democratic processes.\nIn the next sections of this article, we investigate how these\nissues play out in Britain.\nSurvey and data\nTo explore how British citizens think their elected repre-\nsentatives' everyday experiences compare with their own,\nwe fielded a small battery of survey questions in an online\nsurvey of the British adult population. The survey was\norganised by the British Cooperative Campaign Analysis\nProject (B/CCAP) and was administered in April 2010 by\nYouGov.1 Although B/CCAP as a whole was a multi-wave\npanel study, our key instruments were included in only one\nwave, making our analysis essentially cross-sectional.\nThese instruments measured the extent to which citizens\nthought both they and most MPs were affected by or expe-\nrienced three distinct and important areas of public policy:\nthe economy, crime and public services.2 Respondents were\npresented with the following questions.\nCrime in Britain affects different people in different ways. To\nwhat extent are different groups affected by crime?\nSome people rely more than others on public services like\neducation and health. How reliant are different groups of\npeople on public services?\nChanges in the state of Britain's economy affect people in\nvarious ways. To what extent are different people affected\nwhen the economic situation deteriorates?\nFor each question, respondents were asked to locate them-\nselves on a 0\u00ad10 scale, where 0 meant they were not at all\nAllen and Sarmiento-Mirwaldt 3\naffected by crime or the economic situation, or were not at\nall reliant on public services, and 10 meant they were very\nmuch affected or reliant. Respondents were also asked to\nlocate `most MPs' on the same 0\u00ad10 scale.\nThe results are reported graphically in Figures 1\u00ad3.\nTaken together, they suggest the existence of a perceived\ndiscommunion between ordinary citizens and MPs across a\nnumber of policy domains. In terms of the first domain\n(Figure 1), respondents generally perceived MPs to be\naffected less by crime (mean score of 3.3) than they them-\nselves were (4.4). There was an even greater discommunion\nwith respect to the second domain (Figure 2). Respondents\ngenerally said that they were more reliant on public services\n(mean score of 5.9) than were MPs (3.4). The greatest per-\nceived discommunion between citizens and MPs was evi-\ndent when we asked respondents about the economy (Figure\n3). Very few respondents said that they were unaffected by a\ndeterioration in the economic situation, whereas many more\nsaid that they were greatly affected (the mean score was\n6.6). Many took the opposite view, however, when it came\nto their elected representatives (3.4): respondents were more\nlikely to say that MPs tended to be less affected by\nFigure 1. Crime: to what extent are you and most Members of Parliament (MPs) affected?\nFigure 2. Public services: to what extent are you and most Members of Parliament (MPs) reliant?\n4 Research and Politics \neconomic downturns, and very few said MPs were very\nmuch affected.\nWhen interpreting the results, it is important to empha-\nsise that the question explicitly refers to `most MPs' and\ntaps respondents' perceptions of the broader political class,\nrather than specific individuals or groups of politicians.\nVoters may well perceive the experiences of their own MP,\nor of MPs from a particular political party, to be somewhat\ndifferent to those of MPs in general, something we are una-\nble to explore here. It is also important to emphasise that,\ndespite the low regard in which elected politicians are\ngenerally held, not all respondents automatically located\nmost MPs at the extreme end of the scale. Figures 1\u00ad3 show\nvariation in MP placement, with respondents offering dif-\nferent opinions about the extent to which MPs experienced\nthe three policy areas.\nThe individual-level drivers of\nperceptions\nThus, most Britons would appear to perceive a gap between\nthemselves and politicians with respect to how they are\naffected by crime and economic downturns, and in how\nreliant they are on key public services. To some extent,\nthese perceptions are almost certainly a product of contex-\ntual factors, including prevailing economic and social con-\nditions and recent government policies. The size of any\nperceived discommunion is thus likely to change over time.\nWhile the results from our single national cross-sec-\ntional survey cannot tell us much about the temporal nature\nof perceived discommunions, we are able to investigate\nsome of the individual-level factors that drove perceptions\namong British voters before the 2010 General Election.\nOne obvious place to begin is the notion that representa-\ntives' visible characteristics are likely to have some impact\non their actual life experiences. Thus, citizens who share\nthe same social characteristics of most MPs may be more\nlikely to believe that their experiences are closer to those\nof MPs--and vice versa--than individuals who least\nresemble the `typical' MP. When it comes to age, gender,\neducation and socio-economic status, which are all factors\nassociated with membership of Parliament (see Cowley\npeople, men, university graduates and those with higher\nincomes to perceive a greater communion of interest\nbetween themselves and MPs than younger people,\nwomen, non-graduates and those with lower incomes.\nPartisanship, attentiveness to politics and media consump-\ntion may also be expected to affect perceptions. Individuals\nwho identify with the major parties may be more likely to\nbelieve their experiences are closer to those of most MPs\nthan those who do not, given the integrative role of parties\nand partisanship. Similarly, those who pay close attention\nto current affairs may perceive a greater sense of commun-\nion with their MPs, since people who are interested in poli-\ntics tend to have a stronger sense of political efficacy\n(Craig etal., 1990). Meanwhile, readers of serious `broad-\nsheet' newspapers may perceive their experiences to be\ncloser to those of MPs than `tabloid' readers, in line with\nthe media-malaise thesis (Newton, 2006).\nTo investigate these relationships, we first created meas-\nures of the perceived discommunion--or what might be\ntermed a respondent's sense of `in it togetherness'--for\neach of the three policy areas. We focused on the magnitude\nof the perceived discommunion, since this arguably matters\nmost in terms of politicians' capacity to be responsive.\nFigure 3. Economy: to what extent are you and most Members of Parliament (MPs) affected?\nAllen and Sarmiento-Mirwaldt 5\nAfter all, politicians may be less responsive to citizens'\ninterests if they have less of a stake in a given policy area,\nbut they may also be less responsive if they have a greater\nstake. Our measures were therefore of the absolute gaps\nbetween where respondents located themselves on the rel-\nevant 0\u00ad10 scale and where they located most MPs. The\ndistributions of the resulting `gaps' are shown in Figure 4.\nAs can be seen, and in line with Figures 1\u00ad3, the crime\n`gap' and thus the scale of the perceived discommunion in\nthis domain was the smallest (mean score of 2.4). The econ-\nomy gap (4.0) was the largest of the three, with the public\nservices gap (3.3) in the middle.\nWe then created a composite discommunion scale,\nwhich was simply the arithmetic mean of the crime, public\nservices and economy gaps. This three-item scale had a\nCronbach's alpha of 0.74, indicating good reliability. We\nthen used this 0\u00ad10 scale, where a low score reflects a\nsmaller gap and a high score reflects a greater gap, as a\ndependent variable in an analysis of what drives respond-\nents' perceptions of a discommunion of interests between\nthemselves and most MPs. Because of the way we con-\nstructed the dependent variable, a negative coefficient\nmeans that the relevant variable reduces the scale of the\nperceived discommunion, whereas a positive sign indicates\nthat this variable increases it.\nWhile our primary interest is investigating the magni-\ntude of the perceived discommunion, we also recognise\nthat the direction of perceptions may matter.As Figures 1\u00ad3\nsuggest, most citizens take the view that MPs are more\nsheltered from the everyday challenges that they have to\ngrapple with, and it is these citizens who can be expected to\nhave the most pronounced concerns about a distant and\nunrepresentative political class. To explore the importance\nof direction as well as magnitude, we created a second\nvariable based on the positive gap between respondents'\nself-perceptions and perceptions of most MPs: after sub-\ntracting the latter from the former, we excluded the nega-\ntive scores before creating another three-item 0\u00ad10 scale.3\nThe resulting variable provided a measure of how much\nmore respondents thought they were affected by crime and\neconomic downturns than MPs were, and how much more\nreliant on public services they thought they were.\nThe results of our analyses are reported in Table 1. Both\nthe `absolute' and `positive' models are very similar in\ndirection and statistical significance. Among the independ-\nent variables, age was significant insofar as younger\nrespondents, contrary to expectations, perceived a smaller\ndiscommunion than middle-aged ones, whereas the percep-\ntions of those over the age of 54 were not statistically dif-\nferent from those of middle-aged respondents. Graduates\nand richer people (those earning over \u00a340K) also perceived\na smaller gap, in line with expectations. Those who paid\nmore attention to politics, here measured on a four-point\nscale, perceived a larger gap, a relationship that went\nagainst what we anticipated. Newspaper readership was not\nsignificant. As for partisanship, respondents who identified\nwith Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats\nbelieved the gap to be smaller, but only for those who iden-\ntified with the Labour Party was the coefficient significant\n(p < 0.05) in both models. Still, this finding suggests that\npartisanship continues to integrate citizens into political\nprocesses, as anticipated.\nThe consequences of perceived\ndiscommunions\nWe now come to the implications of perceived discommun-\nions of interests between voters and their leaders, starting\nMagnitude (size of 'absolute' gap)\nPercentage\nCrime gap\nPublic services gap\nEconomy gap\nFigure 4. Magnitude of perceived discommunion of interests across three policy domains.\n6 Research and Politics \nwith voting behaviour. As illustrated by the 2010 coalition\ngovernment's narrative of being `in it together,' politicians\nare conscious that citizens' perceptions of mass-elite soli-\ndarity may have electoral consequences. We were able to\nexamine whether this was so in the context of the 2010\nGeneral Election, thanks to the multi-wave panel-design of\nthe B/CCAP: all respondents who participated in the April\nable to relate citizens' pre-election perceptions to their\nreported turnout and vote choice.\nWe expect a greater sense of discommunion to suppress\nturnout, in much the same way that a low sense of external\nefficacy does (Clarke etal., 2004). Voters who have less\nconfidence in the system's ability to respond to them are\nless likely to vote; voters who think their MPs enjoy very\ndifferent experiences to them may think them less able or\nwilling to be responsive. We also anticipate that, among\ncitizens who do vote, a greater sense of discommunion is\nlikely to reduce support for the incumbent party, in line\nwith the standard `reward\u00adpunish' model of voting behav-\niour (Clarke etal., 2009). In addition to these anticipated\nrelationships between the magnitude of perceived discom-\nmunion and voting behaviour, we also expect the direction\nof perceptions to matter: respondents who say most MPs\nare much less affected by economic and social conditions\nthan they themselves are, as opposed merely to enjoying\ndifferent experiences than their MPs, will be even less\nlikely to vote or support the incumbent party.\nTo test these expectations, we included both our `abso-\nlute'or magnitude measure and our `positive'or directional\nmeasure of perceived discommunion, together with a num-\nber of controls, in two multivariate models: a model with\nthe dependent variable of reported turnout, a simple dummy\nvariable where 1 means the respondent did vote; and a\nmodel with the dependent variable of reported vote choice,\na dummy variable where 1 means that the respondent\nrecalled voting for the incumbent Labour party. Our control\nvariables include age, sex, education and income, party\nidentification, newspaper readership, political attentiveness\nand retrospective evaluations of the national economy, a\nkey indicator of government `performance' (Clarke etal.,\nTable 2 reports the results of our first two models. When\nit comes to reported turnout at the 2010 General Election,\nperceptions of both an absolute and a positive gap depressed\nthe chances that a respondent would vote, but only in the\nlatter case was this effect large enough to be statistically\nsignificant. This finding is consistent with our expectation\nabout the additional importance of the direction of any per-\nceived discommunion. In both models, political attentive-\nness increased turnout, as one would expect: people who\nfollowed daily affairs were more inclined to vote than those\nwho did not. Age also mattered: those under 35 were less\nlikely to vote than older groups, conforming to well-known\npatterns of voting behaviour. When it comes to explaining\nvote choice, both the magnitude and the direction of per-\nceived discommunion were significant and negatively\nsigned: people who thought MPs were further removed\nfrom their experiences in absolute terms were more likely\nto vote against the government, and those who thought MPs\nwere less affected by economic and social conditions were\neven more likely to vote this way. Among the other varia-\nbles, a perception that the national economy had deterio-\nrated made a vote for the incumbent party less likely, while\nTable 1. Ordinary least squares model of the perceived discommunion of interests.\nMagnitude (`absolute' gap) Direction (`positive' gap)\nnon-reader; no party identification.\nAllen and Sarmiento-Mirwaldt 7\nLabour identifiers were significantly more likely to vote\nLabour, and Conservative identifiers were less likely to\nvote Labour, although the last relationship was significant\nonly in the magnitude model.\nWhile there is evidence that a sense of discommunion is\na factor in aspects of voting behaviour, perceptions of\nmass-elite solidarity may also have other political conse-\nquences. In particular, such perceptions can be expected to\naffect levels of diffuse support for the political system\n(Easton, 1975). We explored this possibility by examining\nthe relationship between perceptions of discommunion and\nsatisfaction with democracy, as measured on a four-point\nscale, ranging from 1 (`not at all satisfied') to 4 (`very satis-\nfied'). In essence, we expect a greater sense of discommun-\nion to be associated with lower levels of satisfaction with\ndemocracy: respondents who think politicians are consist-\nently not `in it together' with them may feel that the system\nis failing at a basic level. Once again, we further expect this\neffect to be more pronounced among respondents who said\nMPs are much less affected by a range of economic and\nsocial conditions than they themselves are.\nIn contrast to our models of turnout and voting Labour,\nthe direction of causality is more difficult to establish with\nabsolute certainty. However, it is far more likely that\nrespondents' relatively specific perceptions--in this\ninstance of their own and most MPs' experiences of crime,\nthe economy and public services--affect a general sense of\nsatisfaction with democracy, rather than the other way\nround. There may, however, be some confounding factors,\nsuch as a general sense of disengagement or disillusion-\nment with elected politicians, which may account for both\nrespondents' perceptions of most MPs' experiences and\ntheir satisfaction with democracy. In order to mitigate this\npotential problem, we controlled for political attentiveness\nand perceptions of elected politicians'standards of honesty,\nmeasured on a scale from 1 (`very low') to 5 (`very high').\nTable 3 presents the results.\nThe table shows that, even after controlling for these\ninfluences, perceptions of a discommunion of interests had\na significant and negative impact on satisfaction with\ndemocracy: people who perceived a greater discommunion\nwere less likely to express satisfaction with democracy; the\nrelationship was marginally greater in the directional\nmodel. Among the control variables, those who identified\nwith one of the three mainstream parties, and especially\nLabour and the Conservatives, were more likely to express\nhigher levels of satisfaction with democracy. Those who\nfelt that the national economy had deteriorated were less\nlikely to express satisfaction. Attentiveness was negatively\nsigned in both models, meaning that respondents who paid\nmore attention to politics were likely to express satisfaction\nwith democracy, perhaps because they were more familiar\nwith recent scandals, but this relationship was only signifi-\ncant in the second model. Those who perceived politicians\nTable 2.

The graph suggests\nthat the likelihood of being `very satisfied' with democracy\nwas low, but there was a slight downward trend: as percep-\ntions of a discommunion increased in size, satisfaction with\ndemocracy decreased. The reverse was true for the likeli-\nhood of being `very dissatisfied,' which increased with an\nTable 3.

The chances are that\nsomeone was `fairly satisfied' with democracy decreased\ndramatically as the sense of discommunion grew. The prob-\nability of expressing `a little' satisfaction increased quite\nsubstantially as perceptions of a discommunion increased\nfrom a small gap to a medium-sized one. Thus, Figure 5\nillustrates the effect that a sense of discommunion has on\nsatisfaction with democracy, even after controlling for\npotentially confounding factors such voters' disengage-\nment and mistrust of politicians.\nConclusion\nAt a time when many citizens appear to feel alienated from\nestablished political processes, it is important to identify\nwhat it is about politics that people dislike. We would not\ngo so far as to say that a perceived discommunion of inter-\nests is absolutely fundamental to any explanation of con-\ntemporary political disaffection, but we do suggest that it is\npart of the story, and that it is also relatively neglected fea-\nture of public opinion that merits further inquiry. There are\ncertainly good reasons to think that liberal democracies\nneed communions of interest, perceived as well as real,\nbetween their politicians and citizens. Shared experiences\nand interests help politicians respond better to popular pref-\nerences. Knowing that politicians face the same experi-\nences and challenges may also boost citizens'confidence in\ntheir elected representatives. As we have shown in the case\nof Britain, the greater the perceived communion, the greater\nthe sense of satisfaction with democracy. There is also evi-\ndence that perceptions of shared experiences and interests\ncan affect voting behaviour, irrespective of performance\nevaluations--in this instance whether to turn out to vote,\nand whether to support or oppose an incumbent party.\nThe findings presented in this paper are, of course, lim-\nited in time and space. It is unclear how typical Britain is of\nother liberal democracies in terms of its pronounced mood\nof not-in-it-togetherness, and the effects of these beliefs on\ndiffuse and specific support. It is also unclear whether the\nresponses we measured in 2010 were above or below the\nhistorical mean in Britain. Moreover, our data prevent us\nfrom exploring whether citizens perceive a greater com-\nmunion with specific representatives, in particular their\nown local MP, than the political class in general. Further\nresearch is clearly needed to explore the spatial and tempo-\nral dynamics of these beliefs, and how they are shaped by\neconomic, social and institutional factors. Further research\nis also needed to explore the relationship between percep-\ntions, on the one hand, and aspects of politicians' behav-\niour, such as constituency service, and social characteristics,\nsuch as gender and professional backgrounds, on the other.\nKnowing more about these dynamics and relationships may\nhelp us understand better the current political disenchant-\nment in Britain and in other liberal democracies. As we\nhave demonstrated in this article, it matters if citizens think\nthey and politicians really are `in it together'.\n"
