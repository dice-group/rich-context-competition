    "abstract": "Abstract\nType 2 diabetes mellitus prevalence is growing globally, and the leading cause of mortality in these patients is cardiovascular\ndisease. Epigenetic mechanisms such as microRNAs (miRs) and DNA methylation may contribute to complications of\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus. We discovered an aberrant type 2 diabetes mellitus\u00adsmooth muscle cell phenotype driven by\npersistent up-regulation of miR-145. This study aimed to determine whether elevated expression was due to changes\nin methylation at the miR-145 promoter. Smooth muscle cells were cultured from saphenous veins of 22 non-diabetic\nand 22 type 2 diabetes mellitus donors. DNA was extracted, bisulphite treated and pyrosequencing used to interrogate\nmethylation at 11 CpG sites within the miR-145 promoter. Inter-patient variation was high irrespective of type 2 diabetes\nmellitus. Differential methylation trends were apparent between non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes mellitus\u00adsmooth\nmuscle cells at most sites but were not statistically significant. Methylation at CpGs -112 and -106 was consistently\nlower than all other sites explored in non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes mellitus\u00adsmooth muscle cells. Finally, miR-145\nexpression per se was not correlated with methylation levels observed at any site. The persistent up-regulation of miR-\n145 observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus\u00adsmooth muscle cells is not related to methylation at the miR-145 promoter.\nCrucially, miR-145 methylation is highly variable between patients, serving as a cautionary note for future studies of this\nregion in primary human cell types.\n",

A common promoter lies\nupstream of the miR143HG start site to regulate expres-\nsion of both miRs;8 however, individual promoters for\nTargeting of messenger RNAs by miRs is a form of epi-\ngenetic regulation, whereby gene expression is modulated\nindependently of changes to the DNA sequence. Another\nform of this regulation, DNAmethylation, is also important\nin directing messenger RNAexpression. Due to its involve-\nment in cancer, a number of studies have examined meth-\nylation immediately upstream of miR-145.3\u00ad6 This region\ncontains 11 potential methylation sites (Figure 1(b)), yet\nwhile methylation across this region was generally\nincreased in malignant pleural mesothelioma tissue3 and\nprostate cancer sections,6 in glioma the scenario was more\ncomplex with increased methylation in cell lines5 but not in\nintact tissue samples.4 It is therefore crucial to carefully\nconsider source material (i.e. tissues, cell types) when\ninvestigating any potential differences in methylation and\nexploring its relevance to disease pathology.\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an escalating global\nburden and an area of intensive research; recent studies\nhave highlighted the importance of differential methyla-\ntion in this multi-faceted disease.10\u00ad12 The leading cause of\nmortality in T2DM is coronary heart disease13 and patients\nfrequently require surgical intervention through coronary\nartery bypass grafting using the patient's own saphenous\nvein (SV). However, outcomes in T2DM patients are infe-\nrior to those without a diagnosis of diabetes.14 Moreover,\nachieving tight glycaemic control does not ameliorate car-\ndiovascular complications, at least in the medium term.15,16\nThe relative resistance of macrovascular complications to\nglucose normalisation is suggestive of metabolic memory\n\u00ad a concept believed to possess a strong epigenetic compo-\nnent inducing long-lasting and potentially irreversible\nchanges in cell function.17\nIn support of this theory, we demonstrated potentially\ndetrimental phenotypic changes in a number of cardiovas-\ncular cell types derived from multiple patients with\nT2DM.18\u00ad22 Specifically, we discovered an aberrant SMC\nphenotype from the SV of T2DM patients which was char-\nacterised by increased spread cell area, cytoskeletal disar-\nray and reduced proliferation, and driven by elevated\nexpression levels of miR-145.19 The ability of SMC to\ndynamically switch and modulate their phenotype is\nrequired for adaptive vessel remodelling and is critical fol-\nlowing bypass grafting. This persistently aberrant venous\nphenotype conceivably contributes to the poor surgical\noutcomes in this patient group, although it is not necessar-\nily representative of global changes within all SMC in the\ndiabetic patient. Importantly, maintenance of the pheno-\ntype throughout serial passaging19,20 supports the idea of\nepigenetic regulation at the level of differential miR-145\nexpression, which itself may be modulated via DNA meth-\nylation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to interrogate\npotential methylation sites immediately upstream of the\nmiR-145 coding region and to determine whether there\nwere any differences between SMC cultured from patients\nwith or without T2DM.\nMethods\nReagents\nAll tissue culture reagents were from ThermoFisher (Life\nTechnologies), Paisley, UK, except foetal calf serum (FCS)\nwhich was from LabTech International, Uckfield, UK.\nDNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and\npyrosequencing reagents were from Qiagen, Crawley, UK.\nRNA extraction kit was from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel\nHempstead, UK, and miR reverse transcription and Taqman\nassays were from ThermoFisher (Life Technologies).\nCell culture\nSMCs were isolated and cultured from SV fragments col-\nlected from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass\ngrafting at the Leeds General Infirmary as previously\ndescribed,23 with local ethical committee approval (LREC\nCA01/040) and informed written patient consent. This\nstudy conformed to the principles outlined in the\nDeclaration of Helsinki. All cells irrespective of diabetic\nstatus were maintained under identical conditions in\nmedium comprising Dulbecco's modified eagle medium\n(DMEM) with 10% FCS, 100\u00b5g/mL penicillin-streptomy-\nmM glucose, at 37\u00b0C in a\nhumidified incubator with 5% CO2\nin air. All experiments\nwere performed on cells between passages 3 and 5, across\nDNA isolation and bisulphite conversion\nDNA was extracted from confluent cells using a QIAamp\nDNA Micro Kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\nTwo micrograms of DNA was subsequently converted\nusing EpiTect Plus Bisulfite Kit according to manufactur-\ner's instructions to convert any unmethylated cytosine\nresidues to uracil residues.\nPyrosequencing\nPyrosequencing assays were designed using PyroMark\u00ae\nAssay Design SW 2.0 for the region flanking the miR-145 and\nmiR143HG transcription start sites. These included an ampli-\nfication primer set where one primer was biotinylated, and a\nsequencing primer.Amplicon length was restricted to <200bp\nto ensure optimal pyrosequencing. Bisulphite-converted DNA\nwas amplified using Pyromark\u00ae PCR Kit on a thermal cycler\ns at\nmin final extension stage at\n72\u00b0C (primer sequences are listed in Table 1). A small aliquot\nwas electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel to ensure a single,\nintense band was observed. The remaining product was subse-\nquently used for pyrosequencing, in triplicate, on the\nPyromark\u00ae Q24 according to manufacturer's instructions. The\nmethylation status of each CpG site was determined using\nPyroMark\u00ae Q24 Software. Standard curves were generated\nusing known proportions of unmethylated and fully methyl-\nated control DNA.\nRNA extraction and miR-145 expression\nRNA was extracted from 7\nTotal RNA Mini Kit as previously described.24 Expression\nof miR-145 was determined using Taqman MicroRNA\nReverse Transcription Kit and Taqman assays specific to\nhuman miR-145-5p and snoU6 (housekeeper) in triplicate\naccording to manufacturer's instructions.\nStatistical analysis\nData are expressed as mean\n\u00b1\nstandard error of mean\n(SEM), with n representing experiments performed on dif-\nferent donors' cells in each group. Patient age was tested\nfor normality in GraphPad Prism v6.05 using the Shapiro\u00ad\nWilk normality test followed by t-test. The proportion of\npatients of each sex was tested by binomial test. As\nmethylation sites were not acting independently of each\nother, we used a multivariate model to examine differences\nat separate sites using the formula\n~Diabetes+Age\n( )\n+\n+Sex\nDiabetes, age and sex were classified as independent\nvariables, and all methylation sites (189 etc.) as dependent\nvariables. Correlation was assessed using R squared.\nSignificance was considered at p<\ntions were performed using GraphPad StatMate 2.0.\nResults\nPatient demographics\nNon-diabetic (ND) patients had a mean age of 59.0\u00b12.5\n\u00b1\nwere 87% male. The age of patients in both groups was\nnormally distributed and not significantly different from\neach other (p\n=\n0.21). The proportion of male:female\npatients was analysed using the binomial test as the num-\nber of females in each group was too small to be analysed\nusing chi-square test; again, there was no significant dif-\nference in the proportion of males:females (p=0.47). Of\nthe patients receiving treatment for T2DM, 4.3% were diet\nwere additionally supplemented with insulin.\nTable 1. Primer sequences used in pyrosequencing assays.\nRegion CpG sites Primer sequences\nMethylation assay design\nA series of pyrosequencing methylation assays were\nmoters (Figure 1). The region of interest covering 11\npotential CpG methylation sites in the miR-145 promoter\nwas analysed with two primer sets to ensure that pyrose-\nquencing assays were of an optimal length. Using a range\nmethylated), we characterised the sensitivity of the assays\nto detect methylation at each position before constructing\na standard curve for each CpG site, from which methyla-\ntion data for individual patients was interpolated. In gen-\neral, the assays were sensitive to the degree of methylation\nas exemplified in Figure 2(a) for CpG -32; however, sen-\npoorer than that at other sites (Figure 2(b)).\nMethylation levels at the miR-145 promoter in\nSMC isolated from ND and T2DM patients\nMethylation levels were determined for each site from 22\nND and 22 T2DM-SMC (Figure 3(a)). Overall, there was\na tendency to reduced methylation in T2DM-SMC for\nat more proximal positions, this pattern was lost and there\nwere no consistent trends in methylation at CpGs -32 to\n+13 (Figure 3(a)). Inter-patient variation was high at all\nsites regardless of diabetes; however, the degree of varia-\nbility was less at CpGs closer to the transcription start site.\nGiven this variation, and despite analysis of a total of 44\npatient samples, the study was not sufficiently powered\n(Table 2) to detect a change in methylation of 5% (the\nmean difference observed across the 11 separate CpG\nsites). Analysis of the mean methylation across all 11 sites\nrevealed no significant differences in miR-145 methyla-\ntion in T2DM-SMC (Figure 3(b)).\nlower than at other sites. To ensure these data were robust,\nwe analysed these two positions using three different\nassays (Figure 1(b) and Table 1) and reliably detected con-\nsistently lower levels of methylation at these particular\nsites (Figure 3(c)).\nCorrelation of miR-145 expression with\nmethylation\nMethylation of this region of the miR-145 gene has previ-\nously been reported to correlate with its expression.6 Given\nour previous report of elevated miR-145 expression in\nin RNAsamples that were prepared in equivalent cells from\nFigure 1.

However, pyrograms were consistently\nof a poor quality due to large homopolymeric regions and\ndid not yield reliably quantifiable results (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of\nDNA methylation in primary human SV-SMC in two\ndefined patient cohorts. A key strength was that analysis\nwas performed in cells from multiple patients. Few studies\nhave examined methylation specifically in the SV, and\nthose that have predominantly analysed DNA from whole\ntissue wherein global changes in methylation in distinct\ncell types were potentially masked.25\u00ad27 Using pure popu-\nlations of human primary cells is therefore a key strength\nof this study. Other studies have used SMC derived from a\nsingle commercial source.28 However, this could lead to\nmisinterpretation of any observed differences because, as\nwe have clearly demonstrated here, a single sample is\nwithout doubt not representative of a diverse patient popu-\nlation. Our study using isolated SV-SMC from a total of 44\npatients provides a broad view of inter-patient variation in\nmethylation that is related to venous SMC specifically.\nWhile the patient donors used in this study were age\nand sex-matched, we did not have access to full patient\ndemographics [e.g. body mass index (BMI), HbA1c and\nstatins] some of which could conceivably impact our data\nanalysis if they were found to differ between the two\ngroups. However, in our previous, larger study we had\naccess to clinical data on HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein\ncholesterol (LDL-C) and creatinine for the patient donors\nand also the proportion who were receiving statin therapy,\nangiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,\n-blockers, anticoagulant drugs and diuretics. We found\nthat T2DM patients had significantly higher fasting glu-\ncose and HbA1c, but all other parameters were identical\nbetween ND and T2DM patients including cardiovascular\ntherapies.19 Therefore, it is likely that the only known dif-\nference between the two patient groups analysed here was\na clinical diagnosis of diabetes.\nWe focussed our attention on the region immediately\nupstream of miR-145 as this is the only area that has previ-\nously been interrogated. We observed trends towards\nconsensus indicates that promoter methylation and gene\nexpression are inversely related;29 the observed subtle\nreduction in methylation would support this hypothesis,\ngiven higher expression levels of miR-145 we reported in\nT2DM-SMC.19 Previous studies demonstrated both hyper-\nmethylation and reduced expression in both mesothelioma\nand prostate cancer.3,6 miR-145 modulates cellular prolif-\neration2,7 and our observations together with the aforemen-\ntioned cancer studies support a role for increased miR-145\nmethylation (and lower expression) in hyper-proliferative\ndisorders such as cancer and reduced methylation (and\nhigher expression) in T2DM-SMC in which we unambigu-\nously demonstrated reduced proliferation.18\u00ad20\nlower than at all other sites; this was validated by three sepa-\nrate assays. Reduced methylation at these specific CpGs has\nonly once previously been demonstrated in prostate cancer\npatients.6 Therein, a reduction in methylation at CpGs -112\nand -106 was observed in some, but not all, patient samples\nas we found in this study, suggesting that reduced methyla-\ntion at these sites might be specific to SMC or non-malignant\ncells. This highlights the cell-specific nature of DNA meth-\nylation30 and emphasises the importance of examining meth-\nylation in primary, patho/physiologically relevant cell types.\nThe key finding of this study was the marked variability\nin miR-145 methylation, irrespective of T2DM.\nFigure 4. Correlation of miR-145 methylation and expression: (a) correlation of miR-145 expression with methylation at CpG\n-189 and (b) mean methylation across the entire region (n=22 of each population).\nMethylation across the entire region was not statistically\ndifferent between ND and T2DM-SMC. Retrospectively,\nusing these data we performed power calculations (Table\n2) which indicated that a population >200 would be\nrequired to achieve statistical power. Because we have pre-\nviously demonstrated robust, consistent up-regulation of\nmiR-145 expression with sample sizes of 10 per patient\npopulation,19 the fact that we would require up to 200 for\nmethylation studies adds weight to our argument that dif-\nferential methylation of the miR-145 promoter is not the\ncausative factor for its elevation in T2DM-SMC.\nSince methylation at CpG -189 was most divergent\nbetween ND and T2DM cells, we investigated whether this\ncorrelated with miR-145 expression. However, methylation\nat this site alone or across the entire region did not correlate\nwith expression, agreeing with a previous study in glioma.4\nIn contrast, Suh et al.6 demonstrated a correlation between\nmethylation and expression in 47 cancer cell lines includ-\ning breast, colorectal, pancreatic, prostate and kidney; stud-\nies that by their nature, minimise inherent variability that is\nattributable to that in primary cells and tissues.\nWe previously demonstrated a consistent up-regulation\nplausible that expression and regulation of the host gene\nmiR143HG is more critical for the enrichment of both miR-\nmiR143HG promoter has not yet been studied.We attempted\na series of pyrosequencing methylation assays upstream of\nmiR143HG; however, the capacity to interrogate this region\nwas overwhelmed by technical issues due to large homopol-\nymeric regions. As a result, pyrosequencing methylation\nanalysis was inconsistent and unreliable. Nevertheless, the\nability to develop a robust assay to interrogate the host gene\npromoter would possibly be valuable.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, pyrosequencing is a robust and accurate\ntechnique to quantify DNA methylation at multiple sites in\nhuman SV-SMC. A key finding was the very high degree of\nvariation in methylation between cells from different indi-\nviduals irrespective of diabetes status, underscoring the\nimportance of adequate sample sizes to provide sufficient\npower when working with material from unrelated indi-\nviduals and delivering a cautionary note for future studies.\nIn cancer, matched malignant and normal tissue from the\nsame patient almost certainly provides improved statistical\npower of analysis, and this approach can also be used for\natherosclerosis or other localised pathologies;31,32 however,\nit is neither practical nor possible when examining com-\nplex, systemic diseases such as T2DM. The high variability\nthat we have shown in methylation makes it incredibly\nunlikely that changes in methylation are responsible for the\npersistent and, more importantly, consistent up-regulation\nof miR-145 expression in T2DM-SMC; however, we can-\nnot discount that methylation of miR143HG may contrib-\nute to these differences. Importantly, epigenetic signatures\nare not limited to DNAmethylation \u00ad it is likely that a com-\nplex interplay between methylation, chromatin and histone\nmodifications and transcription factors are involved in reg-\nulating miR-145 expression. While a detailed examination\nof the miR143HG region may prove informative, studies\nthat adopt a `whole population' approach may not provide\nthe answers being sought. T2DM is a complex heterogene-\nous pathology that is the culmination of multiple genetic\nand environmental risk factors. In the future, the advent of\npersonalised medicine whereby a patient is treated on the\nbasis of their unique epigenetic signature may provide the\nrevolution in treatment of T2DM and its complications.\nGiven the increasing epidemic of T2DM and its attendant\nmorbidity, such novel targets for therapy are urgently\nrequired.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThis work was funded by a project grant awarded by the Dunhill\ndesign, collection, interpretation or analysis of data; writing of the\nmanuscript; or the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.\nReferences\n1.
