    "abstract": "The two films reviewed below, Ladies in Lavender and Autumn Spring, both focus on the transformations of characters in old age. In the former, two old sisters live a quiet life in a cottage on the coast of Cornwall in \u00b4 in WWI. The other has never experienced a great love in her life. Suddenly their serene life is turned topsy-turvy when they rescue a young Polish man who is washed up on shore below their cottage. Bradley Fisher, the reviewer for this film, analyzes the awakening of love in old age both as a folly for one of the minor characters in the film and as a profound event for one of the two sisters. He proposes that when one of the sisters finally is able to gain a perspective on her feelings of love and loss, she reaches a state of elderhood--representing an attain- ment of identity based upon self-awareness and self- knowledge. She reaches a state whereby she can redirect her passion for the young man. Now she realizes and accepts her status as his mentor and his advocate. At the same time, Fisher proposes that the relationship between the two sisters has been strength- ened by virtue of their shared bonds regarding the experiences of love and loss. This film explores some of the tragic elements of old age and examines the desire to seek love and renewal even late in life.",

In the former, two old sisters\nlive a quiet life in a cottage on the coast of Cornwall in\n\u00b4 in WWI. The other\nhas never experienced a great love in her life. Suddenly\ntheir serene life is turned topsy-turvy when they rescue\na young Polish man who is washed up on shore below\ntheir cottage. Bradley Fisher, the reviewer for this film,\nanalyzes the awakening of love in old age both as\na folly for one of the minor characters in the film and as\na profound event for one of the two sisters. He\nproposes that when one of the sisters finally is able to\ngain a perspective on her feelings of love and loss, she\nreaches a state of elderhood--representing an attain-\nment of identity based upon self-awareness and self-\nknowledge. She reaches a state whereby she can\nredirect her passion for the young man. Now she\nrealizes and accepts her status as his mentor and his\nadvocate. At the same time, Fisher proposes that the\nrelationship between the two sisters has been strength-\nened by virtue of their shared bonds regarding the\nexperiences of love and loss. This film explores some of\nthe tragic elements of old age and examines the desire\nto seek love and renewal even late in life.\nThe second film, Autumn Spring, appeared on Czech\ntelevision in 2001. The reviewer, Howard Schwartz,\nanalyzes the relationship between an old couple as an\nexample of the contrasting philosophies of activity and\ndisengagement. Whereas the husband delights in playful\ncreativity and harmless con games--in order to maintain\nhis zest for the possibilities of engagement--his wife has\nembraced the philosophy that life has ended for both of\nthem. She prefers to make arrangements for the end of\nlife and spends most of her time organizing her funeral\nand their burial arrangements. Their competing philos-\nophies collide repeatedly, and the results are often\nhilarious. This film focuses on the comic elements of old\nage and portrays the old characters affectionately and\nrespectfully. Thus, the struggle between activity and\ndisengagement must be resolved--one way or the\nother--and done so with comic effect.\nAt the core of both films is the presence of veteran\nactors and actresses who bring a lifetime of acting\nexperience to bear on their roles and transform their\ncharacters from caricatures of old age to convincing\ncharacters rich with idiosyncrasies and passions. In\nLadies and Lavender Judi Dench and Maggie Smith\ncreate indelible portraits of two elderly sisters--one who\nis stiff and stern and in charge of the household and the\nother who is restless and intuitive and still trying to come\nto grips with her aging. Watching these two actresses at\nwork--establishing their characters and playing off\ntheir strengths against each other--is one of the simple\njoys of watching this film. Likewise, the three veteran\nactors in Autumn Spring create rich characters that\nreveal both their shortcomings and their strengths. They\ninhabit their roles, and they express the fullness and\nvariety of their characters with deft touches, including\ngestures, the way they express dialogue, and their skills\nat interacting within key scenes. Each of these five actors\nin the two films brings 40 to 50 years of experience from\nthe theater and the cinema to their roles.\nIn the past several years three other audiovisual\ncolumns have included reviews of feature-length\nfictional films: Aging, Intergeneration, and Community\nand Tea with Mussolini; Aging and Loss: Feature-\nSchmidt, Last Orders, and Iris (United Kingdom); and\ncluding reviews of several international films--After\nLife, Central Station, The King of Masks, The Shower,\nYi Yi, and ^\nEtre et Avoir (To Be and To Have)--and\none American film, The Straight Story.\n--Robert E.
