Serum adiponectin, leptin, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-6\nand high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were quantified.\nResults: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 28.6% (22/77). Patients with metabolic\nsyndrome had lower adiponectin concentrations and higher leptin, TNF-a, IL-6 and hsCRP\nconcentrations compared with patients without metabolic syndrome. In addition, metabolic\nsyndrome was associated with higher glycosylated haemoglobin and insulin dose, and increased\ninsulin resistance.\nConclusions: The proinflammatory state associated with metabolic syndrome in patients with\ntype 1 diabetes leads to deterioration of glycaemic control and an increase in the required daily\ndose of insulin. Early and proactive diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in these patients will allow\nmedication and lifestyle optimization, in order to prevent the occurrence of diabetes complications\nand improve health-related quality-of-life.\nJournal of International Medical Research\nReprints and permissions:\nsagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav\nimr.sagepub.com\n1Department of Internal Medicine II, ``Victor Babes''\nUniversity of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania\n2Department of Functional Sciences, ``Victor Babes''\nUniversity of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania\n3City Hospital, Timisoara, Romania\n4Department of Diabetes Nutrition and Metabolic\nDiseases, ``Carol Davila'' University of Medicine and\nPharmacy, Bucharest, Romania\n5Department of Infectious Diseases, ``Victor Babes''\nUniversity of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania\nCorresponding author:\nBogdan Timar, Department of Functional Sciences, ``Victor\nBabes'' University of Medicine and Pharmacy, 2 Eftimie\nEmail: timar.bogdan@umft.ro\nCreative Commons CC-BY-NC: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial\n3.0 License (http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits non-commercial use, reproduction and\ndistribution of the work without further permission provided the original work is attributed as specified on the SAGE and Open Access page\n(http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/openaccess.htm).\n",

In addition, proinflammatory\nstatus was evaluated by quantifying each\npatient's adiponectin, leptin, TNF-a, IL-6\nand hs-CRP concentrations, and the rela-\ntionship between proinflammatory status\nand quality of metabolic control, daily\ninsulin dose, and prevalence of diabetes\ncomplications was examined.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study enrolled patients with type 1\ndiabetes, treated between April 2012 and\nEmergency Hospital, Timisoara, Romania.\nInclusion criteria were aged <45 years;\nbasal\u00adbolus insulin analogue monotherapy\n(without any other antidiabetic or insulin\nsensitizer agents). Data regarding history of\ndiabetes, daily insulin requirement (per kg\nbody weight), dietary habits, alcohol\nintake, smoking profile and physical activ-\nity were obtained from medical records.\nHeight, weight, blood pressure (according\nto European Society of Cardiology\nGuidelines22) and abdominal and hip cir-\ncumference were measured for each patient;\nbody mass index (BMI; kg/m2) and waist-to-\nhip ratio (WHR) were calculated. Metabolic\nsyndrome was diagnosed according to\nAll patients provided written informed\nconsent and the study was approved by the\nEthics Committee of the Emergency\nHospital, Timisoara, Romania.\nLaboratory analyses\nPeripheral blood (5 ml) was taken from\neach patient after an overnight fast, for\nquantification of concentrations of\nserum triglyceride, total cholesterol,\nhigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol\n(HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein choles-\nterol (LDL-C) (all via enzymatic methods),\nglycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (immu-\nnoturbidimetric method; Abbot Architect\nc8000 clinical chemistry analyser, Abbot\nLaboratories, Irving, TX, USA), adiponec-\ntin, leptin, TNF-a, IL-6 (all via enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay, Biovendor\nLaboratory Medicine, Candler, NC, USA),\nand hs-CRP (nephelometry method). Insulin\nresistance was assessed using the estimated\nglucose disposal rate (eGDR), according to\ntension: 0 for no and 1 for yes)\u00ad\nis an inverse correlation between insulin\nresistance and eGDR.24\nStatistical analyses\nData were presented as mean \u00c6 SD (for\ncontinuous variables with Gaussian distri-\nbution), median (interquartile range [IQR];\nfor continuous variables without Gaussian\ndistribution), or n (%) (categorical vari-\nables). The 95% confidence intervals for\nprevalence were calculated according to\nWilson's procedure.\nPatients were stratified according to the\npresence or absence of metabolic syndrome.\nBetween-group comparisons were made\nusing Student's t-test, Mann\u00adWhitney\nU-test or 2-test with Yates correction, as\nappropriate. The distribution of continuous\nvariables was tested for normality using\nShapiro\u00adWilk test and Levene's test for\nequality of variances. Pearson's correlation\ncoefficient was used to evaluate correlations\nand regression strength in the study popu-\nlation as a whole, with statistical significance\nassessed using t-distribution test.\nStatistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA) for Windows\u00d5.

This\nsuggests that metabolic syndrome is more\nprevalent at younger ages in patients with\ntype 1 diabetes than in the general popula-\ntion of a similar age group. The presence of\nmetabolic syndrome in patients with type 1\ndiabetes was associated with increased insu-\nlin resistance and proinflammatory state in\nthe present study. This leads to a premature\nrendering young patients with type 1 dia-\nbetes as vulnerable to cardiovascular disease\nas the older population without diabetes.\nMetabolic syndrome is less common in\npatients with type 1 diabetes than in those\nwith type 2 diabetes,29 possibly because\ninsulin resistance caused by abdominal\nTable 1.

This finding\nunderlines the important role of adiponectin\nin reducing inflammation the atherogenic\nprocess, which is known to have a consider-\nable inflammatory component.34 Leptin was\nelevated in the presence of metabolic syn-\ndrome in the present study and was directly\ncorrelated with BMI. This suggests that\nabdominal obesity (a characteristic of meta-\nbolic syndrome) is associated with hyperlep-\ntinaemia, and that these patients may\nhave developed leptin resistance. IL-6 and\nTNF-a are correlated with abdominal obes-\nity,35 thus linking obesity and metabolic\nsyndrome in type 1 diabetes to proinflam-\nmatory status and atherosclerosis.\nThe present study is unusual in that it\nanalyses the relationship between metabolic\nsyndrome, adipocytokines, glycaemic con-\ntrol and inflammation in adults (median age\n34 years) with type 1 diabetes. Other studies\nhave generally focused on children or\nyounger adults.36 The inflammatory and\nmetabolic states of patients with type 1\ndiabetes and metabolic syndrome in the\npresent study were similar to patients of a\nsimilar age with type 2 diabetes.37 In add-\nition, the present study assessed directly the\nrelationship between the components of\nmetabolic syndrome and adipocytokines\nand glycaemic control.\nIn conclusion, the proinflammatory state\nassociated with metabolic syndrome in\npatients with type 1 diabetes leads to further\ndeterioration of glycaemic control and an\nincrease in the daily dose of insulin needed.\nSince the development of chronic diabetic\ncomplications is strictly related to the qual-\nity of glycaemic control, the presence of\nmetabolic syndrome would lead to an\nincreased risk of developing chronic com-\nplications.
