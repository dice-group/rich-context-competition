PNS is usually\ntreated with corticosteroids, but some\npatients do not respond to treatment and\neventually progress to end-stage renal fail-\nure. Glomerular pathology is a crucial prog-\nnostic factor in PNS, with concomitant\ntubulointerstitial damage recognized as a\nsignificant factor contributing to poor prog-\nnosis.1 Since oxygenation abnormalities are\na primary cause of (and unifying mechanism\nfor) progression to tubulointerstitial fibro-\nsis,2 a suitable noninvasive and reproducible\nmethod for evaluating changes in intrarenal\noxygenation may aid in assessing tubuloin-\nterstitial alterations and predicting progno-\nsis. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD)\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is such a\ntechnique.\nThe basic principle of BOLD MRI is that\nmagnetic field perturbations (caused by\nparamagnetic molecules such as deoxyhae-\nmoglobin) lead to a loss of phase coherence\nand signal attenuation in gradient echo T2*\nweighted sequences. The R2* (1/T2*) relax-\nivity rate of spin dephasing is proportional\nto tissue deoxyhaemoglobin levels,3,4 and\nchanges in R2* can be interpreted as\nchanges in oxygen partial pressure (pO2\n) in\ntissues.5,6 BOLD MRI has been shown to\ngive reproducible results in oxygenation\nmonitoring in normal kidneys,7,8 and has\nbeen used to detect renal oxygenation\nchanges in hypertensive disease,3 diabetes,9\ntransplanted kidneys10 and acute renal\nThe aim of the present study was to use\nBOLD MRI to evaluate renal oxygenation\nin patients with PNS, in order to test\nthe hypothesis that renal tissue oxygen-\nation correlates with renal function,\ntubulointerstitial alterations and treatment\nresponse.\nPatients and methods\nStudy population\nThe study recruited sequential patients with\nPNS, admitted to the Department of\nNephrology, the First Affiliated Hospital,\nCollege of Medicine, Zhejiang University,\nHangzhou, Zhejiang, China, between\nInclusion criteria were: (i) initial onset of\nPNS; (ii) no prior corticosteroid therapy; (iii)\nno history of other kidney disease, hyperten-\nsion, diabetes or other vascular disease; (iv)\navailability of follow-up data. Healthy con-\ntrol subjects with no history of renal disease,\nhypertension, diabetes or other vascular dis-\nease were recruited from individuals\nundergoing health examination at the\nMedical Examination Centre, the First\nAffiliated Hospital, College of Medicine,\nZhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang,\nChina. Participants with contraindications\nto MRI (such as claustrophobia) were\nexcluded.\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nMedical Ethics Committee of the First\nAffiliated Hospital, College of Medicine,\nZhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang,\nChina, and all participants provided written\ninformed consent prior to enrolment.\nMRI protocol and analysis\nIn order to standardize hydration status and\nsodium balance, all participants were nil by\nmouth and received no intravenous transfu-\nsion 4 h prior to MRI. In addition, no\ndiuretic agents were taken 12 h prior to\nMRI.12 MRI was performed using a 3 T\nclinical system (Signa HDx\u00d5, GE Medical\nsystems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) with an\neight-channel body coil. After conventional\ncoronal, axial T1-weighted and T2-weighted\nimaging, BOLD MRI was acquired with a\ngradient-recalled-echoes sequence. A total of\nfive coronal sections centred at the renal\nhilum were scanned with section thickness of\n5 mm and intersection gap of 1 mm. Each\nsection corresponded to 16 different gradient\nechoes and was acquired during a 15-s breath\nparameters were repetition time 150 ms, flip\nImaging analysis of BOLD data was\nperformed interactively using research soft-\nware (FuncTool\u00d5 2, GE Healthcare) at the\nworkstation (GE ADW 4.4, Sun\nMicrosystems, Santa Clara, CA, USA).\nR2* maps of the kidney were automatically\ngenerated, and each map was delineated by\ntwo experienced radiologists (R.Z. and Q-\nD.W.) who were blinded to clinical data.\nRadiologists worked together and with con-\nsensus. For the R2* map, three coronal\nsections centred at the hilum of each kidney\nwere selected. A total of three regions of\nupper, middle, and lower parts of the\nkidney were traced in the cortex and medulla\nof each section, carefully avoiding renal\nsinus and susceptibility artefacts. In total,\nR2* values of nine cortical and nine medul-\nlary ROIs were collected per kidney\n(Figure 1), and the mean of these 18 cortical\nR2* and medullary R2* values was\ncalculated.\nLaboratory analyses\nPeripheral blood and urine samples were\nobtained from each participant on the day of\nthe MRI. Analyses included haemoglobin,\ntotal serum protein, serum albumin, serum\ncreatinine, urinary protein and estimated\nglomerular filtration rate (eGFR; calculated\nby the ModiEcation of Diet in Renal Disease\nRenal pathology\nPatients underwent renal biopsy the day\nafter MRI, and biopsy specimens were pro-\ncessed for light, immunoFuorescent, and\nelectron microscopies. Formalin-fixed speci-\nmens were stained with hematoxylin and\neosin, periodic acid\u00adSchiff stain, periodic\nacid silver methenamine and Masson's tri-\nchrome. Consecutive frozen sections were\nstained with direct immunoFuorescence\nusing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-\nlabelled murine monoclonal antibodies\n(Dako, Denmark) for Immunoglobulin\n(Ig)G, IgA, IgM, C3, C4 and C1q.\nFormalin-fixed and frozen sections were\nexamined via light microscopy.\nElectron microscopy of two glomeruli per\npatient was performed to observe epithelial\nfoot process fusion, electron dense deposits,\nand thickness of the glomerular basement\nmembrane and tubuloreticular structures.\nPathological grading (Katafuchi criteria14)\nof renal tubulointerstitial damage was per-\nformed independently by two experienced\npathologists, and agreement was reached by\nconsensus if necessary.

Prednisone\nwas gradually withdrawn over the following\n8 weeks according to the individual needs of\nthe patient. Patients received immunosup-\npressant therapy (cyclophosphamide, trip-\nterygium or tacrolimus) as required. All\npatients were followed up for 12 months. If\nproteinuria resolved during the initial 8\nweeks of treatment and did not return\nduring the remaining 12 months of follow-\nup, the patient was defined as a treatment\nresponder. Treatment nonresponders were\ndefined as those patients whose proteinuria\nremained during the initial 8 weeks of\ntreatment. Treatment-dependent patients\nwere defined as those whose proteinuria\ndisappeared during the initial 8 weeks of\ntreatment but relapsed during the remaining\n12 months of follow-up.\nStatistical analyses\nThe study sample size was determined to be\n20 patients, according to the findings of an\nearlier study.10 Data were mean \u00c6 SD.\nPaired samples t-test was used to compare\ncoronal R2* and medullary R2* between the\nright and the left kidneys; independent\nsamples t-test was used to compare coronal\nR2* and medullary R2* between patients\nand controls. Patients were stratified into\nsubgroups according to PNS pathological\ntype and treatment response, and between-\nsubgroup differences in coronal R2* and\nmedullary R2* were analysed using one-way\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA). Spearman's\ncorrelation coefficient analysis was used to\nevaluate relationships between clinical,\nlaboratory and pathological variables\nand R2*. Statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SPSS\u00d5 version 16.0 (SPSS\nFigure 1.

The absence of\ncorrelation between R2* values and serum\ncreatinine in the present study may be\nexplained by the fact that this parameter is\naffected by extrarenal factors including age,\nweight, diet and drug use.22 Our finding of a\nsignificant positive correlation between\nmedullary R2* and TIDS is compatible\nwith the findings of others,21 and suggests\nthat BOLD MRI may reflect the degree of\ntubulointerstitial changes.\nAlthough medullary R2* values\nincreased with more advanced kidney\ndamage (low eGRF/high TIDS) in patients\nwith PNS in the present study, mean medul-\nlary R2* values were significantly lower than\nthose in healthy controls. This may be due to\nthe effect of reduced blood supply (as a\nresult of tubulointerstitial fibrosis and the\nloss of peritubular capillaries) lowering\nmedullary oxygenation in patients with ser-\nious tubulointerstitial lesions.\nThe present study found no statistically\nsignificant relationship between treatment\nresponse and R2* values. Prognostic factors\nin PNS are complex; with severe tubuloin-\nterstitial damage recognized as a major\ncontributing factor for poor prognosis.23\nPrognosis may also be affected by fac-\ntors including glomerular pathological\ntype, although we found no significant\nbetween-group differences in R2* values\nwhen patients were classified according to\ndisease type.\nThis study has several limitations, includ-\ning the small sample size. Future studies\nshould include larger patient groups. In\naddition, we performed BOLD MRI only\nonce for each patient. Renal oxygenation is\na dynamic characteristic that is influenced\nby a number of local and systemic factors,\nand may vary at different disease stages.24\nDynamic monitoring of renal oxygenation\nchanges with noninvasive BOLD MRI\nwould be useful throughout treatment.\nBOLD MRI may provide useful informa-\ntion for assessing the effect of pharmaco-\nlogical interventions and adjusting\nmedication regimens.\nIn conclusion, the medullary oxygen con-\ncentration was higher in patients with PNS\nthan in control subjects.
