Often, knowledge is available in the minds of conspecifics that would be risky,\ninefficient, or even impossible to derive through individual exploration of the environment.\nThus, conspecifics can be rich sources of relevant information for a learner. Indeed,\ndecades of research on humans and other species attest to the centrality of social learning\nfor the acquisition of adaptive information and skills (see Galef, 1976; Hoppitt and Laland,\n2008; Rendell et al., 2011). Observing another's actions can lead a na\u00efve organism to focus\nThe origins of pedagogy\nattention on relevant environmental features (stimulus enhancement), to identify causal\ncontingencies (affordance learning), or to model the actions or goals of another\n(imitation/emulation) (see Galef and Giraldeau, 2001; Hoppitt and Laland, 2008). In these\ncases, the learner may exploit information made available by actions the knowledgeable\nactor performs for the actor's own immediate benefit, without regard to the audience\n(Danchin, Giraldeau, Valone, and Wagner, 2004). Such passive forms of social learning are\nobserved across diverse taxa (e.g., in fish: Laland, Atton, and Webster, 2011; insects:\nand other mammals: Thornton and Clutton-Brock, 2011).\nHowever, some information may be more effectively transmitted with active\ninvolvement of the knowledgeable individual (Boyd and Richardson, 1985). In teaching,\nalso referred to as pedagogy, a knowledgeable individual facilitates learning by altering its\nbehavior in the presence of a na\u00efve observer. Teaching is widespread amongst humans\n(Strauss, Ziv, and Stein, 2002), and according to one recent proposal (hereafter, the\n\"Natural Pedagogy\" or \"NP\" hypothesis), human teaching relies on dedicated mechanisms\nthat evolved for the purpose of social transmission (Csibra and Gergely, 2009, 2011), and\nare unique to our species (Csibra, 2007)1. Alternatively, the ability to learn effectively from\nteachers could be acquired over the course of ontogeny via domain-general learning\nmechanisms, without requiring genetic adaptations for social transmission2\nIn parallel to this developmental literature, there has emerged a growing body of\nresearch on teaching in nonhuman animals (for reviews, see Caro and Hauser, 1992;\nThornton and Raihani, 2008). This work is not only relevant for evaluating the claim that\nthe form of pedagogy observed in humans is species-specific (Csibra, 2007), but also for\nunderstanding the selection pressures that might have given rise to teaching, and the range\nof cognitive machinery that might support it. To most evolutionary biologists and\nbehavioral ecologists, information transfer constitutes a form of teaching if it meets three\n. To begin to\ndistinguish between these possibilities, recent experiments have explored how social-\ncommunicative contexts modulate learning early in human development, generating an\nintriguing set of empirical phenomena. However, the representations that support\ndifferential learning in teaching contexts remain poorly understood, and the extent to which\nthere is continuity in these processes across species is unknown.\n1 We do not make a theoretical distinction between teaching and pedagogy. While the term \"teaching\" is\ngenerally used with nonhuman animals, and the term \"pedagogy\" reserved for humans, we do not find it\nuseful to adopt this usage when it is an open question which cognitive processes support the various teaching\nphenomena observed across species and over development. Instead, we use these two terms loosely and\ninterchangeably, aiming to highlight a number of more subtle distinctions necessary to characterize how\ndifferent cognitive systems support teaching and pedagogical learning.\n2 These are not mutually exclusive accounts. It is possible, for example, that domain-general learning\nmechanisms exploit domain-specific perceptual schemas and/or motivational processes (see Heyes, 2012b,d).\nSimilarly, evolved learning constraints can still exhibit experience-dependent plasticity, perhaps interacting\nwith knowledge acquired via domain-general learning mechanisms. We highlight these two views as\nopposing extremes, acknowledging the nuanced positions between them.\nThe origins of pedagogy\ncriteria. To qualify as teaching, (1) the knowledgeable individual must modify its behavior\nin the presence of a na\u00efve observer, (2) incurring a cost (or at least gaining no immediate\nbenefit) from doing so, and (3) the observer must acquire knowledge or skills more\nefficiently than it otherwise would (Caro and Hauser, 1992)3\nAlthough interest in teaching is shared across evolutionary and developmental\ndisciplines, these lines of research have operated largely independently, yielding distinct\nemphases in each field. Studies of nonhuman animals tend to focus on whether and how a\nteacher caters its behavior to an audience to facilitate learning, whereas studies of human\nchildren focus on how the learner's assumptions allow the learner to effectively exploit\npedagogical communication. In this review, we aim to integrate these perspectives by\nidentifying cases of active information transfer in human and nonhuman animals and\ndiscussing what is known about the mechanisms that support these behaviors. We then\nsuggest how our understanding of teaching in human ontogeny might take lessons from\nevolutionary theories, and from particular examples of teaching in nonhuman species, and\npropose ways in which findings and models from developmental psychology could inform\nour understanding of the evolution of social transmission mechanisms.\n. Phenomena that satisfy these\ncriteria have been documented infrequently, but there are, nonetheless, examples in several\ndistantly related nonhuman species (ants, Temnothorax albipennis: Franks and Richardson,\n2006; meerkats, Suricata suricatta: Thornton and McAulliffe, 2006; pied-babblers,\nTurdoides bicolor: Raihani and Ridley, 2008). We argue that, despite these advances,\nfurther research is needed to understand the cognitive processes supporting teaching in\nthese species and, in particular, the mechanisms by which na\u00efve individuals learn from\nteaching when it occurs.\nLearning from Others: Characterizing the Problem\nAll learners face the problem of generalizing from past observations or experiences\nto future, unseen events. Suppose, for example, that we observe that a new toy makes a\nnovel sound. Given this observation, we must identify the actions or interventions needed\nto generate the sound and the set of objects that might share this sound-making property, as\nwell as make numerous other inferences about whether the toy has additional hidden\nproperties, and whether the sound is accidental, or central to the object's function.\nRecently, Bayesian models have been used as a flexible framework for specifying inductive\ninference problems at a computational level (Marr, 1982), formalizing how prior\nknowledge in a domain can interact with observed data to support such underdetermined\ninferences (Griffiths, Kemp, and Tenenbaum, 2008). While each of the inferences above is\n3 Notice that this definition does not provide criteria for differentiating teaching from many forms of\ncommunication that result in learning, including ones we might not readily identify as teaching in humans.\nWe assume that there exists no hard and fast line between teaching and other such forms of communication,\nbut that teaching generally communicates declarative or procedural information that generalizes to other\ncontexts (e.g., \"elephants have trunks\"), as opposed to transiently relevant, episodic information (e.g., \"look,\nthere is an elephant in the room\").\nThe origins of pedagogy\nunderspecified by a single observation, learners can make rich, rational inferences on the\nbasis of limited experience if assumptions are made about the processes by which the\nobservations have been sampled (Bonawitz et al., 2011; Gweon et al., 2010; Shafto,\nGoodman, and Frank, 2012). Consider, for example, observing that the novel toy makes the\nsound when on its side, but learning this either from observing the wind blow over the toy,\nfrom a person intentionally placing the toy on its side, or from a person saying \"let me\nshow you how this works\" before placing the toy on its side. In the latter pedagogical\ncontext, a rational learner can make especially strong inferences based on assumptions\nabout others' communicative intentions and tendencies (e.g., that teachers tend to\ncommunicate complete, relevant, and generic information). Computational models of social\nlearning have used a Bayesian framework to demonstrate that pedagogical instruction\nlicenses a stronger set of inferences than mere observation of another agent's behavior, so\nlong as a learner assumes that a teacher is knowledgeable and provides representative,\nmaximally informative data (Shafto and Goodman, 2008; Shafto, Goodman, Gerstle, and\nWhy Study Teaching in Children?\nWhile these computational models show that a rational learner can generalize\nefficiently by making assumptions about pedagogical communication, this does not mean\nthat all forms of teaching meet these assumptions, nor that making such assumptions is\nnecessary for a learner to benefit from teaching. A teacher's behavior might directly\nmodulate attentional or motivational factors that facilitate learning, even if the learner has\nno prior assumptions to recruit when interpreting teachings acts. Do children have intuitive\nknowledge of pedagogical communication that constrains the inferences made from\ninformation provided in pedagogical contexts? Or does learning from human pedagogy rely\non simpler attentional mechanisms that merely function to highlight relevant, generic\ninformation? Recent studies with human children and infants, reviewed in the following\nsection, have aimed to distinguish between these possibilities.\nThese developmental studies also aim to shed light on the origins of receptivity to\npedagogy. One possibility is that children's ability to learn efficiently in social contexts,\nand from teaching specifically, is itself learned over the first few years of life. As children\nlearn specific facts about people and their communicative tendencies, they might construct\na \"theory of pedagogy\" that supports interpreting and learning from others' pedagogical\nacts. The alternative proposed by Csibra, Gergely, and colleagues (the NP hypothesis;\nCsibra and Gergely, 2009, 2011) is that human infants have an innate receptivity to\nteaching that allows them to capitalize on the information provided in pedagogical\ncontexts. This would involve genetically-adapted mechanisms for detecting acts of\nostensive communication (via features like direct gaze and infant directed speech), and\ninferential constraints, already evident in infancy, that dictate the patterns of generalization\nmade when these cues are present. Studies of humans across early development provide\none method for examining the contributions of innate structure and experience to the\nemergence of effective pedagogical learning (see section titled \"Relationship to Cognitive\nArchitecture\" for further discussion of the connection between innateness and specialized\nThe origins of pedagogy\nmechanisms).\nEvidence for Receptivity to Teaching in Children and Infants\nDo humans in fact learn from teaching by making assumptions about the nature of\npedagogical communication? An emerging body of research suggests that children's\nlearning is modulated in nuanced ways by the context in which data are obtained, and that\nchildren make uniquely strong inferences under pedagogical conditions. In an experiment\nby Bonawitz and colleagues (2011), for example, preschool children viewed an\nexperimenter demonstrate one of several functional affordances on a novel toy (e.g.,\npulling a squeaker to make a sound) and were then given an opportunity to play\nthemselves. In some conditions, the experimenter presented the information pedagogically\n(e.g., \"This is my toy. I'm going to show you how my toy works\"). In other conditions, the\nsame affordance information was provided, but the demonstration violated key pedagogical\nassumptions, either because the toy was new to the experimenter, or because the\nexperimenter was interrupted mid-demonstration. Children in the latter two conditions\ntended to explore and discover non-demonstrated functions of the toy. Children in the first\ncondition, however, restricted exploration to the demonstrated function. These children\napparently assumed that a teacher would communicate the full functionality of the toy, and\nthus inferred that the demonstrated affordance was its sole function.\nBased on these and related findings (Buchsbaum, Griffiths, Gopnik, and Shafto,\nthat children make assumptions about the communicative properties of teaching episodes\n(e.g., that a pedagogical demonstration will exhaust the functionality of a novel object).\nFurther evidence that children (and adults) expect teachers to provide complete and\nrepresentative information comes from the finding that learners evaluate an individual\nnegatively for omitting relevant information when teaching others (Gweon, Pelton, and\nSchulz, 2011). Thus, by preschool years, children are able to take into account a range of\nrelevant variables when interpreting communicative acts (i.e., whether the teacher\ncompleted the demonstration or was interrupted), and make flexible inferences about the\nrelevance and scope of the knowledge provided in these contexts.\nThe presence of these abilities in human children is consistent with the view that\nhumans possess an innate adaptation for receiving pedagogical communication, but also\nwith the view that children construct the relevant assumptions (e.g., that teachers are\nknowledgeable and helpful, and communicate complete, relevant, generalizable\ninformation) over the first several years of life. Both views predict that children will learn\nefficiently from teachers, but make different predictions about the developmental trajectory\nof these pedagogy-specific inferences; the proposal that such inferences are learned implies\nan initial period in which infants, new to pedagogical contexts, will fail to make them,\nwhereas the NP hypothesis predicts that such assumptions will be in place from the earliest\nexposure to pedagogical communication.\nAttempts by proponents of the NP hypothesis to characterize infants' understanding\nof pedagogy focus on two key claims. First, adults tend to communicate with infants in\nsystematic ways, and it is argued that infants are innately attuned to these behaviors,\nThe origins of pedagogy\nleading them to attend preferentially to instances of pedagogical communication (Csibra\nand Gergely, 2006). Consistent with this claim of communicative sensitivity, there is ample\nevidence that human infants attend to infant-directed speech (Pegg, Werker, and McLeod,\n1992) and eye contact (Farroni, Csibra, Simion, and Johnson, 2002) and that these\nperceptual sensitivities play a non-trivial role in information transfer, eliciting gaze-\nfollowing and joint attention from infants (Deligianni, Senju, Gergely, and Csibra, 2011;\nThe second, more controversial claim is that infants, like older children, represent\nthe communicative intent behind these signals and make specific assumptions about the\ninformation being communicated, which guide subsequent processing and generalization of\nNP hypothesis, the cues described above lead an infant to infer that information\ncommunicated will be shared across individuals, new or relevant to the learner himself, and\ngeneric or kind-generalizable (that is, will hold across instances of a type or category,\nrather than pertaining to the current exemplar alone). To support this proposal empirically,\none must show not only that infants learn differently in pedagogical contexts, but also that\nthey do so via specific assumptions about the information communicated through\npedagogy. Evidence for this second claim rests on several key findings.\nFirst, infants preferentially encode stable, category-relevant features of objects\nwhen engaged communicatively (Yoon, Johnson, and Csibra, 2008). In a violation-of-\nexpectation paradigm (in which infants look longer at unexpected events), infants were\nrepeatedly shown events in which a person either pointed to an object (communicative\ncondition) or reached for it (non-communicative condition), followed by test events in\nwhich the object changed either location or identity. If infants expect that pedagogical\ncommunication will provide new knowledge that generalizes across contexts, ostensive\ncommunicative cues might lead infants to preferentially encode the identity of the referent,\nrather than transient properties that will not generalize to other instances (i.e., the referent's\nlocation). Consistent with these predictions, infants look longer when there is a location\nchange following non-communicative reaching, but look longer when there is an identity\nchange following communicative pointing. In a related study, Futo and colleagues find that\ninfants map novel functions onto objects (evidenced in their use of function to individuate\nspatiotemporally ambiguous objects) only if the objects' affordances are demonstrated with\nthe cues described above (Futo, T\u00e9gl\u00e1s, Csibra, and Gergely, 2010). These findings suggest\nthat the information an infant encodes when observing a given object differs depending on\nwhether the infant has been engaged pedagogically, or is simply observing the intentional\naction of another.\nFurther evidence for pedagogy-specific learning biases in infancy comes from a\nstudy by Top\u00e1l and colleagues showing that ostensive communicative cues modulate\nperseveration in Piaget's A-not-B task (Top\u00e1l, Gergely, Mikl\u00f3si, Erdhegyi, and Csibra,\n2008). In this classic paradigm, an experimenter repeatedly hides a toy in a location and\nallows the child to search for it. After repeatedly retrieving the toy from the first location,\ninfants continue to search that location even when they witness the experimenter hide the\ntoy in a new place. While this perseverative error is normally explained in terms of the\ncognitive control required to inhibit returning to the previously successful search location,\nThe origins of pedagogy\nTop\u00e1l and colleagues (2008) find that the effect depends heavily on the social-\ncommunicative context of the hiding event. When the experimenter exhibits ostensive cues\nwhile hiding the toy originally, infants make the perseverative error 81% of the time. When\nthese communicative cues are absent, error rates drop by half. This effect of\ncommunicative context is interpreted as evidence that infants encode the ostensively\nsignaled hiding event as conveying generic information (i.e., \"toys are hidden here\"), which\ncontinues to influence search behavior in subsequent trials4\nTaken together, these findings suggest that infants encode different information in\npedagogical and non-pedagogical contexts. But are the data described above clear evidence\nthat infants represent the communicative intentions behind pedagogical overtures, and that\ntheir learning depends on specific assumptions about the nature of the information\nintentionally provided by others? Furthermore, the NP hypothesis asserts that humans learn\nfrom pedagogy via an adaptation that is unique to our species, a claim that obviously\ncannot be resolved with evidence from human infants alone. Experiments with nonhuman\nanimals are necessary to assess whether forms of social learning present in early infancy\nare indeed fundamentally different from those observed in other species. In the following\nsections, we expand upon these developmental data and consider possible interpretations in\nlight of findings with nonhuman animals. We begin by reviewing empirical phenomena\nfrom nonhuman animals, and discussing evolutionary theory relevant to teaching.\n.\nEvidence for Teaching in Nonhuman Animals\nIn evolutionary biology and behavioral ecology, there has been a long-standing\ninterest in the forms of social transmission present across taxa. Recent research with several\nwild and captive animal populations has revealed behaviors that meet Caro and Hauser's\n(1992) functional definition, suggesting that teaching is a key form of social learning in\nsome nonhuman systems. One example of teaching in a nonhuman species is the\ntransmission of prey-handling skills in wild meerkats (Thornton and McAuliffe, 2006).\nMeerkat pups must learn to handle a range of mobile and potentially dangerous prey, and\nadult meerkats facilitate this learning process by bringing killed or disabled prey to young\npups, and providing increasingly intact prey as pups mature. Critically, adults engage in\nthese behaviors only when begging pups are present (criterion 1), and incur no obvious\nimmediate benefit from provisioning pups in this way (criterion 2). This creates\nopportunities for pups to safely practice prey handling, and experimental interventions\nconfirm that these behaviors facilitate skill acquisition (criterion 3).\nThe three functional criteria are also met by the case of tandem running in ants\n(Temnothorax albipennis). Knowledgeable individuals guide na\u00efve nest-mates to food\nsources by running in tandem, slowing their pace as na\u00efve individuals learn the route\n4 Similar effects have been found with domesticated dogs (Canis familiaris) (see Top\u00e1l, Gergely, Erdh\u00f6hegyi,\nCsibra, and Mikl\u00f3si, 2009), however only in human infants is the effect robust to change in the identity of the\nexperimenter. This is taken as evidence that humans, but not dogs, interpret the communicative act as\nproviding generic information that holds irrespective of the individuals involved.\nThe origins of pedagogy\n(Franks and Richardson, 2006; Richardson, Sleeman, McNamara, Houston, and Franks,\n2007). The leader modifies its behavior based on feedback from the follower, taking longer\nto obtain food than it would in the absence of a follower, and the na\u00efve individual locates\nthe food source more quickly than without a leader. Furthermore, the follower takes a more\nefficient path home, suggesting that tandem running not only facilitates the outbound\njourney, but results in learning the location of the food source with respect to the nest.\nOther examples include the teaching of food calls in pied-babblers (Raihani and Ridley,\n2008), and putative evidence in several other taxa (elephants [Loxodonta africana], Bates et\nImportantly, these examples are classified as teaching according to a functional\ndefinition that makes no assumptions about the intentions or internal representations of the\nteacher or learner (Caro and Hauser, 1992). Operationalizing teaching in a mechanism-\nindependent way has led to skepticism about the relevance of animal findings to an\nunderstanding of human teaching (Csibra, 2007). The value of a strict, outcome-based\ndefinition of teaching has been a topic of recent debate (Byrne and Rappaport, 2011;\nRapaport and Byrne, 2012; see response from Thornton and McAuliffe, 2012. Here, we\nsimply assume that the utility of a particular operationalization depends on what exactly is\nat stake in the research (for example, do we want to identify an animal model for human\nteaching, or to understand how social learning problems are solved in diverse neural\narchitectures?). Because these research goals vary across disciplines and individual studies,\nand are only occasionally made explicit, we begin our discussion of how developmental\nand comparative approaches may benefit one another by reviewing a few central\nmotivations of evolutionary biologists and comparative psychologists studying teaching.\nWhy Study Teaching in Animals?\nOne motivation for investigating teaching across non-human taxa is to uncover the\nselection pressures that lead to the evolution of different forms of social transmission, and\nthe ecological or life-history conditions under which different behaviors manifest (Fogarty,\nStrimling, and Laland, 2011; Laland, Odling-Smee, and Gilbert, 2008; Leadbetter and\nevolutionary dynamics perspective, active teaching presents several puzzles (Dawkins and\nKrebs, 1978). Although mechanisms for learning from others would serve a clear adaptive\nfunction, the advantage of mechanisms for actively transmitting knowledge to others are\nless obvious. Active teaching constitutes a form of cooperation (Hoppitt et al., 2008;\nThornton and Raihani, 2008) and is therefore of interest to researchers exploring how\nseemingly altruistic behaviors can be evolutionarily stable strategies (Hamilton, 1964;\nNowak, 2006; Trivers, 1971). Teaching might, for example, be more likely in eusocial or\ncooperatively breeding societies, due to kin selection (Burkhart, Hrdy, and van Schaik,\n2009; Rapaport, 2006), which could partially explain the taxonomic distribution of\ndocumented teaching behaviors.\nTo characterize the evolution of teaching, we also need an account of the\ninformational content that tends to require active transmission from a knowledgeable\nThe origins of pedagogy\nindividual in the first place (see Fogarty et al., 2011 for a more comprehensive discussion).\nEach of the documented animal examples involves teaching of a distinct type of\ninformation: procedural skills in the case of meerkat prey-handling, a location in the case of\ntandem running ants, and a general association in the case of pied-babblers (for discussion\nof different forms of teaching, see Caro and Hauser, 1992). In the case of humans, Csibra\nand Gergely (2009, 2011) have argued for the role of active communication in transmitting\nfunctional or means-end information (relevant to exploiting and manufacturing causally\nopaque cultural artifacts like tools), and in spreading conventional knowledge systems\n(rituals, religions, food practices, languages, etc.). They argue that it was specifically the\ntechnological complexity of hominin artifact cultures that created selection pressure for\nrapid and robust transmission mechanisms. Similarly, Tomasello and colleagues have\nargued that intentional teaching is a key means by which our species sustains cumulative\nculture and cultural ratcheting (Tomasello, 1999; see also Dean, Kendal, Schapiro, Thierry,\nand Laland, 2012). However, studies with nonhuman animals suggest that the presence of\ncausally opaque cultural products like tools and social conventions is not necessary for the\nevolution of all forms of teaching.\nWhile work in evolutionary biology has traditionally been concerned with ultimate\nrather than proximate levels of analysis (Tinbergen, 1963), understanding the cognitive\nprocesses that underlie behavioral phenomena will be crucial to understanding their\nphylogenetic origins (Chittka, Rossiter, Skorupski, and Fernando, in 2012; MacLean et al.,\n2011). A key question for understanding the evolution of cognition concerns the specificity\nwith which natural selection adapts systems to their environment (for a range of views, see\nnatural selection favor specific adaptations to a particular set of information-processing\ndemands, and under what conditions are general-purpose resources exploited? In defense of\na strongly domain-general view, Heyes has recruited comparative and neuroscientific\nevidence that social learning covaries with nonsocial learning across taxa, can be observed\neven in asocial species, and exhibits many of the key signatures of associative processes\nknown to operate across disparate domains (Heyes, 2012b,d; see also Behrens, Hunt,\nWoolrich, and Rushworth, 2008). On the other hand, in meerkats and tandem-running ants,\nteaching presumably relies on mechanisms precisely catered to very specific learning\nproblems of prey-handling and food localization in each species (Franks and Richardson,\n2006; Thornton and McAulliffe, 2006). While it is unknown whether these mechanisms\ncould, under the right environmental pressures, be co-opted to meet other transmission\nneeds, the rigidity of these teaching phenomena (see below) suggests content-specific\nadaptations that are limited in scope. Identifying the conditions under which a more flexible\nmulti-purpose teaching mechanism might evolve remains an important project for\nevolutionary biologists (see proposal in Csibra and Gergely, 2011).\nTeaching also presents an interesting case for understanding the range of cognitive\nprocesses than could meet a particular functional demand, and the diversity of\nneuroarchitectures that would support these processes (Chittka et al., in press; Leadbetter\nand Chittka, 2007). In general, a contribution of comparative psychology can be to test\nhypotheses about which psychological mechanisms are necessary to support a behavior of\ninterest (see, for example, Mendes, Rakoczy, and Call, 2008; Phillips and Santos, 2007 on\nThe origins of pedagogy\nthe necessity of linguistic representations for kind-based object individuation). Based on\nthe forms of teaching evident in humans, it has been suggested that effective teaching\ninvolves abstract inferential abilities, including representations of the knowledge and\nbeliefs of the learner (Premack and Premack, 1996; Tomasello, 1999). Others focus on\nmorphological prerequisites, suggesting that forms of social learning might be uniquely\nsupported by the expanded primate neocortex (Humphrey, 1976; Reader and Laland, 2002).\nEvidence of teaching in insect and avian systems creates demand for more nuanced\narticulations of such claims. Because it is not always clear what sort of representations are\nprerequisites for a given behavior (see, for example, Cruse and Wehner, 2011), identifying\nmanifestations of an ability across taxa can reveal the diversity of solutions to a basic\nfunctional or computational problem. Furthermore, when convergent evolution leads to\nanalogous cognitive mechanisms across taxa, it may be useful to characterize how these are\nimplemented in distinct neuroarchitectures (Emery and Clayton, 2004)5\nIndeed, cases of teaching in nonhuman animals speak to the diversity of solutions to\nthis class of learning problem. Consider, for example, the meerkat's ability to provide skill-\nappropriate prey in response to begging calls (Thornton and McAullife, 2006). A key\nquestion is whether meerkats possess an abstract representation of the pup's skill level, for\nwhich begging calls are just one reliable cue, or whether they respond to begging calls\ndirectly, without an intermediate inference about skill level. Empirical evidence falls in\nfavor of the latter interpretation. When presented playbacks of begging calls from pups\ndiffering in age from those actually in the group, helpers provision based on the age to\nwhich recorded calls corresponded, failing to use other relevant information to provision\nthe pups appropriately (for example, knowledge that the pup successfully handled intact\nprey previously). Such research characterizing how, in the abstract, an organism could\nsolve a problem (along with an account the actual algorithms a neural system could\nimplement to do so) will be crucial to understanding the evolution of functionally defined\n.\nResearch on teaching can also shed light on the range of proximate mechanisms that\nhave evolved to sustain cooperative strategies more broadly. Do prosocial or other-\nregarding motivations play a necessary role in teaching? Some claim that an intrinsic\nmotivation to share information and mental states drives teaching in humans (Tomasello,\nCarpenter, Call, Behne, and Moll, 2005, Byrne and Rappaport, 2011) and perhaps other\ncooperatively breeding species (Burkhart and van Schaik, 2010). It is quite likely, however,\nthat active information transfer occurs in the absence of empathic motivations (see relevant\ndiscussion in Vasconcelos, Hollis, Nowbahari, and Kacelnik, 2012). There is currently little\ndata to speak to this question; whether any nonhuman species share information with a\n5 Of course, for certain purposes, homology is essential. The areas of human cognition that have been most\nfruitfully and rigorously characterized (i.e., the visual system) have clearly benefited from the\nneurophysiological methods afforded by the primate model (van Essen, Anderson, and Felleman, 1992). For\nthis purpose, establishing common mechanisms is highly relevant, as the insights from the animal model to\nthe human system will depend on the degree of homology between the neural substrates.\nThe origins of pedagogy\nmotivation to increase the na\u00efve individual's wellbeing remains an open question for\nempirical research.\nHuman Pedagogy: Insights from Nonhuman Animals\nHaving laid out some key aims of research on the evolution of teaching, and some\nexisting empirical findings with nonhuman animals, we now ask whether this body of work\ncan constrain or inform the study of pedagogy in human learners. What can developmental\npsychologists learn from the study of teaching in other taxa? In interpreting experiments\nwith human infants, the comparative perspective may be especially useful. As mentioned\nabove, comparative evidence has been used to argue that many forms of social learning\nmay depend on domain-general associative processes (Heyes, 2012b,d) rather than\nmechanisms evolved for the purpose of social transmission. This question remains\nunanswered with respect to our species' receptivity to pedagogy: Do humans have an\ninnate adaptation for learning from teachers, triggered by a set of communicative signals\nfor which evolution has prepared us? Or do humans rely on powerful domain-general\nlearning mechanisms that enable them to quickly learn about human communication,\nrecruiting previous teaching experiences to interpret subsequent communicative acts?\nIn considering the mechanisms supporting social learning across species, Heyes\n(2012b) emphasizes the distinction between perceptual mechanisms and learning or\ninference processes themselves, pointing out that general-purpose learning mechanisms can\nrely on input analyzers specialized for social information. That is, a species might have\nattentional or perceptual mechanisms (e.g., gaze-detectors) that facilitate the detection and\nexploitation of social information, while the subsequent processing of that information\n(e.g., categorization, inference, storage in long term memory) might depend on fully\ndomain-general resources. However, on Heyes' view, even the input mechanisms\nthemselves can be developed in a domain-general fashion, via experience with social\nstimuli reliably signaling fitness-relevant resources (see for example, Leadbetter and\nChittka, 2007; Raihani and Ridley, 2008). As with other species, these questions remain\nwide-open with respect to human learning, and domain-general alternatives should be\nconsidered in parallel to the intriguing proposal put forth by Csibra and Gergely (2009).\nWhereas Heyes (2012b) endorses a view in which social learning phenomena\ndepend on resources that are both domain-general and representationally impoverished\n(i.e., associative mechanisms), it is also possible that organisms \"learn to learn\" socially via\ndomain-general mechanisms that operate over abstract, structured representations (see\nKemp, Perfors, and Tenenbaum, 2007). Another possibility is that input analyzers specific\nto ostensive communication might interact with mechanisms that are specific to the social\ndomain, but broader in scope than the learning mechanisms assumed in the NP hypothesis\n(e.g., innate systems for representing goal-directed actions: Wood, Glynn, Phillips, and\nHauser, 2007; social relationships: Seyfarth and Cheney, 2003). On the latter view, unique\nand powerful forms of social learning could emerge as newly evolved perceptual\nsensitivities combine in piece-meal fashion with phylogenetically older social-cognitive\nmachinery.\nBeyond the issues of domain-specificity and innateness, the presence of effective\nThe origins of pedagogy\nteaching in nonhuman animals highlights the question of whether the representations\nsupporting receptivity to pedagogy in human infants need be as rich as those posited by the\nNP hypothesis. While the studies reviewed above suggest infants are attuned to\ncommunicative signals of others, and that ostensive-communicative cues facilitate generic\nknowledge acquisition, it is not clear that these phenomena reflect the sophisticated\ninferences that have been modeled and empirically demonstrated in older children. In the\nanimal literature, there is considerable evidence that complex, adaptive behaviors can be\nsupported by relatively lean mechanisms (Leadbetter and Chittka, 2007), and specifically\nthat instances of effective teaching can depend on fairly simple stimulus-response\nmappings (Thornton and McAuliffe, 2012). For example, in the case of a meerkat adult\nmodifying prey to match a pup's skill level, playback experiments indicate that the link\nbetween begging calls and prey modification is rigid and direct, likely relying on a\nmechanism that transmits very particular species-relevant information without high-level\ninferential abilities on the part of the teacher or recipient. With humans, as with other\nanimals, we must distinguish between social-gating mechanisms (Kuhl, 2007) that might\nfunction to transmit generic knowledge from teacher to learner in pedagogical contexts, and\nmechanisms that do so by actually representing communicative intent and assumptions\nabout the nature of the information provided.\nThe developmental experiments reviewed above appear to be open to multiple\ninterpretations. The finding by Topal and colleagues (2009), for example, could be\nexplained in terms of an attentional mechanism that leads to a stronger, more robust\nrepresentation of the initial hiding event under pedagogical conditions. In the absence of\npedagogical cues, working memory representations might be transient and weak, such that\nprior locations do not compete, and infants successfully search in the current location.\nWhen accompanied by pedagogical cues, both location representations are maintained,\ncreating competition and a need to inhibit return to the prior location. Thus, the effect of\nsocial context might not depend on any sort of inference about the relevance or genericity\nof the initial hiding location, but simply a change in the strength of the location\nrepresentation at the time of encoding.\nAs for Yoon and colleagues' (2008) finding that infants selectively encode kind-\nrelevant information in a communicative context, it is possible that infants actually have a\ngeneral tendency to encode and detect changes in the salient surface features of an object\n(evidence that features are not used for numerical individuation does not directly bear on\nthis issue). On the other hand, the object's location becomes a highly relevant property\nwhen the target of a goal-directed reaching action. Thus, it is possible that detection of\nsurface features in the communicative context reflects a baseline encoding of this featural\ninformation, with the detection of location information in a reaching context being an effect\nof the reaching cue specifically. Both interpretations are plausible, and a baseline condition\nis needed to distinguish between these possibilities6\nFurther experiments might seek to dissociate ostensive cues themselves from the\n.\n6 Thanks to Elizabeth Spelke for pointing out this interpretation.\nThe origins of pedagogy\ninference that the cues are supposed to license. What sort of information can infants exploit\nwhen evaluating the relevance of a given communicative event? As reviewed above,\npreschool-aged children distinguish between a communicative act that is successfully\ncompleted and an act that is interrupted (Bonawitz et al., 2011). Similarly, Bonawitz and\ncolleagues find that children can learn from pedagogical overtures directed at a third-party\nwho shares similar knowledge to the self (a child, in comparison to an adult), suggesting\nthat direct eye-contact and contingency are not essential, but that children can flexibly\nevaluate the relevance of the information provided. Can infants identify the intention to\nteach in a similarly flexible, rational manner, even when the prototypical cues are lacking\nor misleading? Younger children (18-months) learn from third-party social interactions\neven when the target is an adult (Meltzoff and Brooks, 2008), so it remains to be seen\nwhether toddlers could exploit other cues to the self-relevance of the information provided.\nSimilarly, infants might discount ostensive cues if provided with evidence that these cues\ndo not signal self-relevant information, for example, if given evidence that the\ncommunicative act was actually intended for a person with a different knowledge state than\nthe infant. Such flexibility would provide stronger evidence for the view that infants\nrepresent the information as intended for them, and make inferences on this basis7\nThese experiments are designed to test the most extreme view, that infants form\nhighly abstract representations of communicative intent, integrating a range of superficially\ndisparate pieces of evidence to infer that pedagogical assumptions hold. However, a\nnumber of intermediate possibilities exist, and experiments exploring the scope and\nflexibility of these abilities will be essential. Here, we do not argue for any particular\ninterpretation of the existing data, but simply wish to note the range of alternatives that are\ncurrently open. The animal literature attests to the power of natural selection to shape\nfunctional transmission behaviors without abstract inferential mechanisms (Leadbetter and\nChittka, 2007, Thornton and McAuliffe, 2012), and the developmental community would\ndo well to consider leaner mechanisms that could support human social learning as well\n.\nThe Evolution of Teaching: Insights from Human Development\n.\nThus far, we have argued that the study of human pedagogy would benefit from the\nempirical phenomena and theoretical insights of recent work with nonhuman animals. But\nthe evolutionary biologists among us hope that information can flow in the opposite\ndirection as well. We now consider potential contributions of developmental psychology to\n7 Of course, a domain-specific learning mechanism of the kind proposed by Csibra and Gergely (2009) need\nnot integrate all relevant information. Indeed, a key characteristic of domain-specific systems is their\nautomaticity, and their reliance on a restricted set of inputs (Fodor, 1983). The question is whether infants'\nlearning depends on a representation of communicative intent, as opposed to a more direct mapping between\ncommunicative cues and certain encoding strategies. Flexible integration of multiple cues to communicative\nrelevance is just one way to argue for the former.\n8 See Heyes, 2012a on the role of parsimony in evaluating comparative data.\nThe origins of pedagogy\nunderstanding the evolution of teaching and the mechanisms supporting teaching across\ntaxa. First, although the distinctive feature of teaching is that the knowledgeable individual\nplays an active role in transmission, developmental studies highlight the fact that the term\n\"active\" is equally relevant for the learner. A complete account of teaching will involve\ncharacterizing the processes involved in instructing others and those involved in\ncapitalizing on instruction received. Recent developmental and computational modeling\nwork has emphasized the cues by which humans identify teaching contexts (Csibra and\nGergely, 2006), and how the inferences they make in these contexts depend upon\nassumptions about the nature of information provided (Shafto and Goodman, 2008). These\nare potentially fruitful areas for future research with nonhuman animals.\nAbove, we reviewed evidence that human infants may be specifically attuned to\nbehaviors that accompany communicative or pedagogical acts by adults. Do other species\nexhibit behavioral signatures that signal a mode of active information transfer, and if so, do\nna\u00efve individuals exploit these cues to identify opportunities for learning? If teaching\nevolved in response to the substantial costs or dangers associated with individual\nexploration, selection may have favored rapid identification of contexts in which these\ndangers are ameliorated. Given that ostensive cues appear to have co-evolved with\ncorresponding attentional biases in humans, it seems plausible that similar coordination\nwould exist in other species. The meerkat pup, for example, would do well to identify prey\nthat have been selected for them specifically (and thus are likely to be in a state manageable\nfor their skill level) and to avoid unmodified prey, or prey modified for a more experienced\npup. Consistent with this, Thornton and McAuliffe (2006) find that pups are more likely to\ninteract with prey provisioned by a conspecific helper than identical prey provisioned by an\nexperimenter, without a helper nearby.\nIt is possible that meerkats actually represent the fact that prey provisioned by\nconspecifics tend to be manageable for their skill level, and engage in otherwise risky\nexploratory behaviors because the teaching context suggests it is safe to do so. However, it\nis also possible that pups simply avoid food provided by a foreign individual.\nManipulations analogous to those used by Bonawitz and colleagues (2011) might help to\ndistinguish these possibilities. For example, Bonawitz found that children treat a\npedagogical demonstration differently if the demonstration is interrupted. Are meerkats\nsimilarly sensitive to whether the provisioner was interrupted while disabling the prey?\nChildren also selectively learn from teaching directed at a third party when the information\nis likely to be relevant to the self (i.e., when the demonstration is directed towards another\nchild, but not when directed towards an adult). Could an experiment be designed to test\nwhether meerkats also prefer to handle prey modified for a comparably skilled pup\ncompared to prey modified for a more experienced individual?\nSimilar experiments could be designed with tandem running ants. Would ants\nexplore less when taught the location of food (compared to a social foraging situation that\ndid not involve teaching), analogous to the way human children engage in restricted\nexploration following what they assume to be a complete and representative demonstration\n(Bonawitz et al., 2011)? Restricted exploratory behavior seems to be a key signature of\nteaching in humans, and one that is intimately related to its primary function of restricting\nthe learner's hypothesis space to support rapid learning (Bonawitz et al., 2011). Might this\nThe origins of pedagogy\nbe a recurring phenomenon across taxa? Suppose an ant encounters a suboptimal food\nsource either by following a tandem guide or by simply arriving at the source at the same\ntime as another individual--would ants that discovered the food themselves be more likely\nto forgo low quality food and continue foraging, compared to those guided to this food\npatch? And if so, could experiments be designed to distinguish the effects of teaching from\nmore general social influences on foraging? While Franks and colleagues have\ncharacterized some of the flexibility in ants' tandem running behavior (Franklin et al.,\n2011; Richardson et al., 2007), it is currently unknown whether ants would be sensitive to\nthe various nuanced distinctions that modulate learning in human children. Probing the\nflexibility and sophistication of teaching across taxa will be crucial to understanding the\nevolution of different forms of social transmission, and the mechanisms supporting\nteaching in other species.\nRecall also Gweon's studies in which children expect complete and representative\ninformation from teachers, and negatively evaluate others for omitting relevant information\nin third party interactions (Gweon et al., 2011). As discussed above, evolutionary theorists\nhave often conceptualized teaching as a form of cooperation (Burkart and van Schaik,\n2010; Thornton and Raihani, 2008). It appears that, in humans, the cooperative nature of\nteaching is actually represented by the recipient, and the expectation of helpful,\nrepresentative information is part of what enables efficient transmission of knowledge in\npedagogical contexts. Do other species anticipate the informational benefits of teaching\ninteractions, and represent the interaction as a cooperative one? These questions may be\ncrucial to understanding the evolution of teaching, as the learner's assumptions about the\nhelpfulness of a teacher can make teaching a uniquely efficient mode of social transmission\nAnother key claim from the developmental literature is that teaching evolved to\nfacilitate the transmission of cultural knowledge, and that children are specifically adapted\nto learn generic, conventional information from others (Cisbra and Gergely, 2011). Under\nthis view, humans expect that the information provided during ostensive communication\nwill not pertain only to the immediate present, but will generalize across people and time.\nGiven that this generalizability is argued to be uniquely human, is there any evidence that\nnonhuman animals are biased to learn generic information from others? Meerkat pups\nclearly learn procedural knowledge that they generalize to future encounters with prey\nitems, and it is possible that animals learn regularities that enable generalization beyond the\nparticular teaching instances. For example, the ant could learn across tandem running\ninstances that food sources tend to be located near certain environmental features, and this\nassociation could then facilitate future foraging.\nHowever, these examples involve multiple instances of teaching, and the NP\nhypothesis is primarily concerned with the ability to generalize in the absence of exposure\nto regularities that would otherwise be necessary to warrant such inferences (Cisbra and\nGergely, 2011). It is proposed that human learners can generalize from a single teaching\ninstance (e.g., if taught a new fact about a dog, assume it to be true of all dogs, rather than\nidiosyncratic to the particular referent) based on an assumption that teachers provide\ngeneric, representative information (Csibra and Gergely, 2011). Bonawitz and colleagues\n(2011) provide evidence that preschool children do possess inductive constraints powerful\nThe origins of pedagogy\nenough to support rapid learning under pedagogical conditions (see also Futo et al., 2010;\nGelman et al., 2012; Shafto et al., 2010). Future research with nonhuman animals might\nexplore whether teaching in nonhuman animals ever supports this rapid sort of learning.\nAdapting the computational approaches that have been used to formalize learning and\ninference in children will be useful for assessing whether animal learning is best fit by\nmodels that assume pedagogical sampling, or those containing a weaker set of assumptions\nRelationship to Cognitive Architecture\nWhile this review has focused primarily on questions regarding the origins of the\nability to learn from teaching, the theories discussed herein can be associated with distinct\nclaims about the underlying architecture as well. For example, if receptivity to pedagogy is\nconstructed via domain-general learning mechanisms that detect regularities in the\ncommunicative interactions experienced over development, one might expect that the\nacquired knowledge will be represented and exploited using general-purpose cognitive\nmachinery. Across domains, we interpret observations in light of our prior knowledge of\nthe domain (e.g., interpret water droplets as rain rather than a sprinkler when the sky is\ngray, due to our intuitive knowledge of weather). One possibility is that the neural\nmachinery that represents and exploits regularities in pedagogical communication to\ninterpret subsequent communicative acts is highly general (it might operate across domains\nas diverse as weather prediction and pedagogical communication, or it might rely on\nmechanisms that are specific to social or mental state information [e.g., Saxe and\nKanwisher, 2003], but not to pedagogical communication specifically). This perspective\nmight also predict that these representations will be flexible, such that reliable\ncommunicative tendencies can be learned and unlearned based purely on the learners'\nexperiences in relevant communicative contexts.\nNativist accounts, on the other hand, tend to be associated with claims of domain-\nspecific systems operating with some rigidity throughout the lifespan (Spelke, 2003).\nUnder this view, the abilities that emerge early in development are the result of functionally\nspecialized neural circuits that were shaped by natural selection to solve evolutionarily\nrelevant problems in efficient, content-specific ways. Thus, in the case of pedagogy, an\ninnate adaptation might involve a dedicated neural mechanism for receiving\ncommunicative instruction from teachers. A strong version of this view might also predict\nthat learners would respond to a fixed set of inputs (those that were communicatively\nrelevant in the environment in which the system evolved), and do so in a relatively\nautomatic, inflexible way. Rather than taking into account any and all relevant information\nto interpret diverse communicative acts, the cues exploited in pedagogical contexts might\nbe limited and relatively indefeasible.\nDo findings from developmental and evolutionary disciplines bear directly on these\nquestions regarding the specificity of the neural architecture, and the flexibility of its\noperation? Many theorists have assumed that there will be reliable relationships between\nthe origins of particular abilities (built from rich innate structure or from domain-general\nlearning mechanisms), the neural localization of these abilities (specialized neural circuits,\nThe origins of pedagogy\nor recruitment of non-specific neural resources), and the signatures that characterize the\nrelevant processing (fast, automatic, and constrained, or controlled, defeasible, and\nflexible) (Fodor, 1983). While this is an intriguing possibility, the relationship between\nthese dimensions may not be so straightforward; learning can yield localized neural\nmodules (e.g., VWFA in humans: see relevant discussion in Kanwisher, 2010), and innate\ncontent could, in principle, be represented and recruited for inferences in a way that is\ncommon across domains. Thus, we argue that future empirical and conceptual work is\nneeded to clarify the relationship between these dimensions, and to establish the relevance\nof evolutionary and developmental data to claims regarding the underlying cognitive\narchitecture.\nConclusions\nThe last decade has seen heightened interest in the development and evolution of\nteaching. However, extant dialogue between disciplines has generally expressed skepticism\nabout the extent to which comparative data contributes to the study of human teaching\n(Byrne and Rapaport, 2011; Csibra, 2007). We welcome these concerns, and attribute them\nto ambiguity in the aims and assumptions underlying much current work in comparative\npsychology (see Boesch, 2007; Thornton and Lukas, 2012). It is increasingly common for\nresearchers to compare performance of children and other animals, yet it is not always clear\nwhat is to be gained from these comparisons. In this review, we aimed to expand upon\nthese critical analyses of the relationship between human and nonhuman teaching.\nAlthough the correspondence between teaching in humans and nonhuman animals is\nlimited, we find the comparative approach to nonetheless be useful. Findings from these\ndifferent disciplines can be mutually informative so long as researchers are explicit about\nwhat is assumed and at stake in the comparisons.\nIt is important to note that in arguing for an evolutionary perspective on human\nteaching, we are not endorsing a narrowly adaptationist approach. Rather we aim to\ndelineate the numerous ways in which our evolved cognitive architecture might support\nactive forms of social learning. We find it premature to favor one or another alternative\nbased on the evidence available at this stage, but aimed to identify key distinctions and\nopen questions, and suggest ways of distinguishing between these viable alternatives.\nCharacterizing the evolution of the human mind will involve integrating theories and\nfindings from evolutionary biology, comparative and developmental psychology, cognitive\nneuroscience, and computational modeling to understand how natural selection shapes\nneural systems to solve fitness-relevant problems in their environment.\nWe propose that continued research on teaching across phylogeny and ontogeny\nwill be crucial to understanding the diverse forms social learning can take, and the possible\nmechanisms that can support effective transmission of different types of information. With\nrespect to humans, it may be crucial to understanding our species-specific ability to\nmaintain a rich, cumulative cultural inheritance (Fogarty et al., 2011; Tomasello, 1999).\nHumans inhabit dynamic, complex, and richly diverse environments, constructing\nintellectual, political, and cultural institutions that massively outstrip the achievements of\neven closely related species, and exhibit ratcheting over time. A central problem for\nThe origins of pedagogy\nevolutionary and developmental researchers is to characterize the key cognitive ingredients\nthat drive these vast, undeniable differences (Heyes, 2012d; Tomasello et al., 2005). The\nstudy of teaching, along with other forms of social transmission, has the potential to yield\nprogress on this question by characterizing how changes occurring over phylogenetic\ntimescales support forms of learning that widen this gulf over ontogeny.\n"
