We develop a tax micro-simulation model for the\nnewly available Panel on Household Finance (PHF) data.

The nominal income growth as well as the deterioration of tax progression at the\nmiddle and top of the income distribution between 1998 and 2009 can be the impetus for this change.\nThis result implies that delaying adjustment might reduce redistribution. We also suggest that these\nresults might not be restricted solely to Germany.

This phenomenon is known as \"bracket creep\" (fiscal\ndrag/cold progression). The essential function of the tax system is to finance the\ngovernment expenditure and serve the redistribution function. Since bracket creep\nredistributes income from households to the government, it is important to\nquantitatively measure how this redistribution changes the revenue and redistribution\neffects of the tax-benefit system. Furthermore, gross income distribution and the tax\nschedule evolve over time. Many developed countries witnessed, in particular, the\ngrowing inequality before the crisis and capital income expanding at a faster pace than\nnon-capital income ( > ). A dual tax system to levy a flat rate on capital income and\nprogressive rates on non-capital income has been introduced in several countries. We\nmay expect the effect from bracket creep not to be constant. Frequent empirical\nassessment contributes to the understanding of the roles played by the evolution of both\nincome distribution and the tax-benefit system.\nContribution\nAs a case study, we perform a tax micro-simulation on the newly available PHF data\ncovering the entire range of German income distribution in 2009. The micro-simulation\nstudy can separate the effect of bracket creep through the tax schedule from the effect\nvia other tax components and enables relative inflation compensation to differ between\ncapital and non-capital incomes, and between households.\nResults\nOur micro-simulation illustrates an inverted U-shaped redistributive effect of bracket\ncreep as the inflation rate increases. This contrasts with Immervoll (2005) who, in a\nmicro-simulation study using 1998 income data on Germany, the Netherlands and the\nUK, documents that bracket creep can always enhance the overall redistributive effect\nof the tax system. Under both bracket creep and r > g, a dual tax system with a flat\ncapital income tax can reduce the redistribution further. Pre-tax policies attempting to\ncurb this degeneration can even exacerbate the situation under our assumptions.\nNichttechnische Zusammenfassung\nForschungsfrage\nNominales Einkommenswachstum zum Schutz gegen Inflation f\u00fchrt bei einem\nprogressiven Steuersystem nicht zu einem vollst\u00e4ndigen Erhalt der realen Kaufkraft der\nB\u00fcrger, da sie dadurch auch auf eine h\u00f6here steuerliche Progressionsstufe gezogen\nwerden.

The result is underproportional growth\nof real income or even a loss in real income, particularly when income growth is\npredominantly or only nominal.3 Since bracket creep results in a real loss by taxpayers, the\ngovernment naturally enjoys a real gain.\nThe discussion on bracket creep, similar to other topics on the personal income tax (PIT)\npolicy, centres on revenue and redistributive effects.4 On one hand, the public asks to what\nextent bracket creep raises the average tax level and government revenue without explicitly\ntargeted legislative policies (OECD (2008a)). On the other hand, inflation can alter the\ndistributional property of the nominally defined tax system such that the relative increases in\nthe tax burden are uneven between the poor and the rich due to tax progressivity.\nUnderstanding the redistributive effect of bracket creep in depth can enhance the public\ndebate and help policy makers to determine by how much each country is willing to design\nthe countermeasure towards bracket creep (eg inflation indexing by adjusting various\nparameters in the tax function) to restore the redistribution effect of the tax system.\nWe investigate both the revenue and redistributive effects of bracket creep by conducting a\ncase study of German income distribution, with a focus on the latter effect. Immervoll (2005)\nquantitatively assesses this effect using EUROMOD, a Europe-wide tax-benefit micro-\nsimulation model, for Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. The data for Germany refer to\n1998. The author finds that fiscal drag enhances the overall equalising effect of the income\n2 The German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) differentiates between the broad and narrow sense. In the\nbroad sense, this concept refers to the disproportionate increase in income tax revenue along with any nominal\nincome growth (DIW (2014)), while in the narrow sense, it refers to the inflation-induced increase in income tax\nrevenue alone. We will only concentrate on the definition in the narrow sense since it draws more attention in the\nliterature and public debate. However, the mechanisms are the same if we want to extend our discussion to the\ndefinition in the broad sense.\n3 The German literature describes this effect as \"Kalte Progression\" (see, eg Broer (2011)), which literally\nmeans \"cold progression\". The term \"cold progression\" explicitly covers all distortions of the tax function\ninduced by inflation.\n4 As for the significant effects of the PIT policy, for many countries, PIT is an important source of revenue. For\ninstance, in Germany, about one third of all taxes come from income taxation (Federal Ministry of Finance\n(2011)); on the other hand, as income taxes affect a large number of taxpayers, income taxation is deemed the\nmain tool of redistribution. There has been a wide range of literature focusing on the effectiveness and\nprogressivity of income taxation serving to reduce inequality. See eg Kakwani (1980) or Atkinson (1970).\ntax (IT) and social insurance contribution (SIC) system. Although inflation diminishes the tax\nprogressivity, the average tax burdens are increased substantially. The latter effect dominates\nin his evaluation.\nFollowing this study, we also adopt the approach of micro-simulation using a model\ndeveloped for the newly available Panel on Household Finance (PHF) data. The reference\nyear is 2009. Similar to Immervoll (2005), in the baseline scenario, we assume full inflation\ncompensation so that all income components grow at the same pace with inflation. As an\nextension, we also introduce the variation for the nominal growths between different income\ncomponents, which are not bound to be the inflation rate. Our simulation covers both IT and\nSIC by applying the relevant fiscal rules but taking all the transfer income as given in the data.\nThere have been many studies which estimate the distributional feature of bracket creep by\nmodels. As Auerbach and Feenberg (2000) indicate, the aggregate relationship between total\ntaxes and total income does not give any insight into the changes between income\ncomponents and/or taxpayers within one tax unit, and cannot separately analyse the impacts\nfrom different parts of the tax system.5 In particular, we contribute to the literature, taking\nadvantage of the micro approach, by singling out the effect of bracket creep through the tax\nschedule from other tax components and simulating different nominal growth rates for capital\nand non-capital incomes.\nOur result implies that the effect of the average tax burdens no longer plays a pivotal role and\nthe impact from progressivity becomes dominant when inflation climbs. Both of these are the\nbuilding blocks of the redistributive effect of the IT and SIC system. Consequently, we\nobserve an inverted U-shaped overall redistributive effect when inflation grows. Under\nbracket creep, the Gini coefficient of after-IT-SIC income distribution reaches a minimum\nwhen cumulated inflation is about 20%. Assuming constant annual inflation of 2%, cumulated\ninflation can reach 21.9% after 10 years, which is not implausible if frequent indexation is not\ninstitutionalised.6 On the other hand, bracket creep reduces tax progressivity and enlarges the\naverage tax burdens. These impacts are still consistent with Immervoll (2005).\n5 Dolls (2012) further points out that the micro approach can discriminate between each fiscal effect and also the\nbehavioural response of agents. A macro approach based on ex-post analysis cannot do this and, moreover,\nsuffers from endogeneity and identification problems.\n6 In the following text, we calculate cumulated inflation throughout German history. 20% is far from the upper\nbound among the plausible scenarios. Allowing all the social benefit income lags in inflation compensation, we\nshow that the minimum point can be reached at a cumulated inflation of 10%. On the other hand, cumulated\nBracket creep purely through the tax schedule is remarkably overall regressive. As permitted\nunder the dual tax system (by means of a yield test), the upper middle part of distribution\nwould be more willing to opt the capital taxable income out of the (non-capital) income tax\nbase than the lower middle part when nominal income grows. And tax savings through this\nchannel are also positively correlated with the income level. With moderately low inflation\ncumulated to a certain degree, bracket creep can even refund the middle part due to these\nsavings, and the effect is higher for the upper middle part.\nBetween 1998 and 2009, nominal income increased at a relatively faster pace with growth at\nboth ends of income distribution, and the tax rates and progressivity for the middle and top\nparts of the distribution declined substantially. Our analysis suggests that they are the\npotential drivers in reshaping the overall redistributive effect of bracket creep documented as\nthe difference between the results obtained by Immervoll (2005) and us. Our empirical\nevidence implies that delaying indexation for too long could have significant distributional\nimplications which merit attention.\nAlthough concerns about low inflation or deflation have emerged recently, the motivations for\nthis topic are still valid and are shared by many countries. Market income inequality has been\ngrowing in many parts of the world. Taxpayers in many countries have witnessed a period of\ncontinuous tax reforms. The most homogenous evolution is the drop of the top PIT rates\nreassessment of bracket creep. The German case serves well for such an exercise since it has\nfollowed all these developments in income distribution as well as in the IT and SIC system.\nAs our study will demonstrate by using the recent empirical results on the relationships\nbetween income distribution, preferences for redistribution and policy alternatives, the rising\nrole from the declining progressivity observed from our German case might not be isolated.7\nOne major tax reform in 2009 was the introduction of a dual tax system with a final\nwithholding tax (Abgeltungssteuer) at the flat rate of 25% on capital income and separating it\nfrom the income tax base. Capital income was included in the income tax base in 1998.8\ninflation at this minimum point can vary if we adopt the generalised Gini coefficient and assign different weights\nfor the population over the income distribution (the standard Gini measure, which we use, implies an equal\nweight for everyone; see Immervoll (2005) for a discussion and application of the generalised Gini coefficient).\n7 As for the German specifics, favourable economic developments, increasing scarcity on factor market incomes,\nloose monetary policy as well as the need to accommodate the higher subsistence standard might reinforce the\n8 To be clear, throughout the paper, the income tax base is the one that is subject to the progressive tax schedule,\nwhich is equivalent to the non-capital income tax base since 2009 when the dual tax system was introduced.\nCompared with 1998, the top of the income distribution would benefit more from this reform\nsince their marginal income tax rate can be higher than 25% and capital income concentrates\nat the top. Moreover, this advantage grows with income due to tax progressivity and the\nincreasing level of concentration. We can expect this reform to reduce the progressivity of the\ntax system (Jenderny (2013) and Bartels and Jenderny (2014)).9 In terms of bracket creep, the\nhigher the share of income subject to a flat rate tax for a tax unit, the lower the increase in real\ntax burden it will suffer. Therefore, by the same reasoning as above, we can expect bracket\ncreep under the same inflation rate to induce lower progressivity through the IT and SIC\nsystem in 2009 than in 1998. Potentially, as this reduction is expected to pick up when\ninflation grows, this can be another driver behind the inverted U-shaped development of the\nredistributive effect due to bracket creep.\nThe other notable phenomenon in recent decades has been the rise of wealth-income ratios in\nseveral developed countries as well as a higher rate of return on capital relative to labour (ie\n> ) as documented by Piketty and Zucman (2014) and Piketty (2014). These authors also\nidentify > as a driver for the increasing wealth-income ratios because faster growth in\ncapital income would raise the capital share in total income and wealth is even more\nconcentrated than labour income.\nAs another contribution to the literature, we further simulate a few scenarios which introduce\n> such that the inflation-induced nominal growth on capital income is faster than that on\nnon-capital income. For the first group of scenarios in this context, we maintain the constancy\nof / in the population. Compared with a counterfactual comprehensive tax system\nincorporating capital income under the same progressive tax schedule with non-capital\nincome, the current dual tax system significantly worsens the redistribution under all bracket\ncreep scenarios. The aggravation is even stronger as capital income grows faster. With the\nnominal growth rates of 2% for capital income and 0.5% for non-capital income, the\nredistributive effect of the comprehensive tax system can be 6.2% higher than that of the dual\ntax system. For the second group of scenarios, we allow the extent of inflation compensation\nto vary between capital and non-capital incomes, with the former always larger, across the\ndistribution. The relative growth of the two incomes can hinge on the ratio of capital and non-\ncapital incomes for each household. Building on a few reasonable assumptions regarding the\nBefore 2009, there was no separation of the capital and non-capital income tax bases. Thus, reference is made to\nonly one income tax base.\n9 Both document the evolution of German capital income taxation in detail.\ninflation compensation process, our simulations show that the redistributive effect of the IT\nand SIC system under bracket creep with > is always weakened relative to the effect\nwithout > . In the relatively plausible scenario, the peak of the inverted U-shaped\ndevelopment of the redistributive effect occurs at an even lower inflation rate of 10%.

Section 5\nprovides the quantitative assessment on how bracket creep reshapes the equalising effect of\nthe IT and SIC system.

In section 7, we perform the simulations under > . We conclude in section 8.\n2 Bracket Creep\nA macroeconomic approach to assess the impact of bracket creep for a given economy is to\nobserve the development of the income tax revenue in relation to GDP (Broer (2011)). As the\nstatistics show, this relation has been rather stable in Germany since the mid-1970s,\noscillating between 8% and 10%. This means that by means of regular and major tax reforms,\nprogression-related revenues have been returned to income taxpayers and hence, the revenue\neffect of bracket creep has been indirectly phased out. The effect of bracket creep in Germany\nhas been analysed in various studies, which we summarise below. We further describe the\nmeasures undertaken by the government to compensate for this effect.\n2.1 Micro-evidence of bracket creep in Germany\nEven though the relation between income tax revenue and GDP has been constant since the\nmid-1970s, when regarding shorter periods of time, especially those intervals when no major\ntax reforms occurred, significant bracket creep effects could be observed \u00ad \"(...) infrequent\ninflation adjustments can indeed cause additional tax burdens - even at low rates of inflation\"\n(Immervoll (2005), p 38). The studies below have quantified the fiscal consequences and\nredistributive implication of bracket creep in Germany using household micro-data.\nBach (2012) analyses the effects of bracket creep according to the draft of the German\nparliament (Deutscher Bundestag), which proposes a tax reform to explicitly fight the\nGerman government, and full inflation compensation of all incomes, the inflation-induced\nincrease in tax revenue will amount to 6.9 billion for both years. This is in the same scale of\nthe tax burden generated through bracket creep alone is lower in absolute terms for low\nincomes than for high incomes, yet the ratio between this new tax burden and the remaining\nincome taxes is higher for low incomes than for high incomes. We show the same pattern in\nabsolute terms and, as inflation grows, in relative terms by means of an empirical analysis\nalthough our denominator in the ratio is the gross income. Beyond the current literature, our\nextended simulations analyse the additional distortion of the redistribution effect introduced\nby the heterogeneous nominal growth between income components.\n2.2 Neutralising bracket creep\nIn order to offset bracket creep, many countries have institutionalised frequent indexation to\nmodify the tax deductions, brackets and even marginal rates by referencing to the movement\nof cost-of-living. For instance, the USA implemented such a practice as part of the Economic\nRecovery Tax Act in the early 1980s, as documented in Auerbach and Feenberg (2000). Heer\nand S\u00fcssmuth (2013) find a more significant and contemporaneous relationship between the\nGini coefficient and inflation rate dynamics if indexation is more frequent as households\nadjust their labour supply and saving decisions more instantly and less precipitately. The\npractices which Germany has introduced to adjust its tax and benefit systems for bracket\ncreep are briefly summarised below.\nIn Germany there is no automatic indexation. Nevertheless, there are some legal criteria from\nwhich indexation implications are actually derived. For example, there is a \"pension formula\"\nfor calculating adjustments of the contributions as well as the payout level (Gutierrez et al\nConcerning the income tax schedule itself with the tax rates, credits, deductions and bracket\nlimits, discretionary amendments are driving the evolution. For instance, the adjustment of the\nbasic allowance is not primarily motivated by changes in the CPI, but rather according to the\nforecast development of the minimum income needed. This level can be derived from the\n\"margin of subsistence report\" which is presented to the German parliament by the Federal\ngovernment every two years.10 The justification for the last two increases is contained in the\ndraft law to reduce the effect of bracket creep (Bundestag (2012)). Moreover, within these\nadjustments, further political objectives were mixed, as is the case for changes in the\nminimum tax rate. These among other concerns have led to a total of 13 changes in the\nincome tax schedule since 1990 (Hechtner, Massarrat-Mashhadi, and Sielaff (2012)).\nRecently, the government decided to evaluate and analyse the development of progressivity\nevery two years via a progression report (Progressionsbericht). In this context, studies\nassessing the redistributive effect of bracket creep can be contemporaneously valuable.\n2.3 The impact of distortions induced by inflation on personal tax and\nthe income concepts adopted\nBesides PIT, another source of inflation-induced real impact on personal tax can be excise tax.\nSince the tax bases are the volume of transactions, the real value of tax decreases as inflation\ntakes effect. However, accounting for it in our calculations is beyond the scope of this paper\nsince we do not have the relevant data at our disposal and, for comparability, we follow the\nsame practice as in Immervoll (2005) and exclude such an impact. German households are\nalso subject to a non-negligible amount of consumption tax (ie value-added tax). But this tax\nis not relevant in real term because it is a proportional tax on the value added.\nThe tax base on capital income is also nominally defined, and the part to compensate for the\ninflation-induced loss of capital is thus not tax-exempt (Immervoll (2000)). Some countries\nacknowledge this distortion and adjust for it although Germany, among others, does not take\nany action. However, we do not consider such a loss as belonging to the concept of bracket\ncreep as it is not caused by tax progressivity; in particular, a flat rate on capital income has\nbeen in place in Germany for private households since 2009.\nIn our paper, social insurance contributions are considered when calculating the pre-tax\nincome because, fundamentally, the net disposable income reflecting the power to consume\n(ie, the Haig-Simons (H-S) income concept) should be the income measurement for welfare\nanalysis. In other words, any redistribution changing the distribution of such an income\nconcept will have welfare implications and should be counted. On the other hand, our income\nconcept covers all the private and public transfer income (see section 4.2 below). By\n10 The tenth \"margin of subsistence report\" (Existenzminimumbericht) was published in 2015 and can be\naccessed at:\nPM05-anlage.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2\nincluding the statutory social insurance contributions, we will fully derive the net disposable\nincome. This practice is also common in the public finance literature, such as Immervoll\n(2005; see section 2.2), as well as recommended by the international institutes.11\n3 Measuring Progressivity of Income Tax Schedules\nAlthough the income tax schedule can be rather progressive in most areas, the whole tax\nsystem may not be progressive if all of these areas are underpopulated. In the following, we\nwill present the methods to measure the (local) progression of an income tax schedule alone,\nand also its redistributive effects in terms of (global) progressivity when income distribution\nis also jointly considered.\n3.1 Inequality measures related to progression and progressivity\nYet, in order to make clearer the building blocks of progression and progressivity, we will\nfirst briefly introduce the relevant inequality measures.\nLorenz curve\nA Lorenz curve can be defined for a distribution of y in a population, which can be gross/net\nincome, tax, wealth etc. Every point ( , ) on the Lorenz curve captures the share of total y,\n100  , received/paid by the lowest 100  percent population ranked by y, with and\n [0,1]. Let the density and cumulative density functions for income distribution be (y)\nand (y). The Lorenz curve is then defined as\n( ) = ( )\nwhere represents the average income for the whole population (Lambert (2001)).\nLorenz domination\nThe concept of Lorenz-domination was first proposed by Atkinson (1970). Its goal is to show\nif one income distribution is more equal than another. To guarantee that one income\ndistribution is more equal or less equal than another, one of the Lorenz curves must be\ncompletely above the other one (Jakobsson (1976)). Consider, for example, two distribution\nfunctions (y) and (y) and their respective Lorenz curves ( ) and ( ), then is\nLorenz-dominating if\n11 See, for example, the OECD's definition of disposable income:\nhttp://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=3020.\n( )  ( ) for all  [0,1].\nA problem arises when two Lorenz curves intersect at some point. Then we cannot claim\naccording to Lorenz-dominance which distribution is more equal (Kakwani (1986)). To still\nallow for a distribution ranking, the Gini coefficient is computed for every Lorenz curve.\nGini coefficient\nThe Gini coefficient G is an area measure of the extent to which a given Lorenz curve departs\n= 2 - ( ) .\nAs a share measure of the area below the line of perfect equality (45\u00b0 line), it ranges between\n0 and 1. For an income distribution, a -value of zero means that the distribution is perfectly\nequal, while a -value of one would mean that in that population all the income belongs to\none single income unit, irrespective of the population size.\nConcentration curve\nFor the measure of progressivity discussed below, it will be necessary to compute not only\ncurves for gross taxable income shares with respect to the share of the ranked gross taxable\nincome units, but also the relation of the tax burden distribution with respect to the gross\ntaxable income distribution. The concentration curve |\n() allows for such a relation as it\ndepicts the shares of a first distribution against the shares of a second distribution\nLet us assume that the gross tax function takes the form (y), where y represents the gross\ntaxable income level. Further, (y) stands for the distribution of gross taxable income. It\nfollows that the concentration curve of taxes with respect to gross taxable income ( )|\n( )\nis defined as:\n( ) ( ) y\n( )\n,\nwhere is the average tax liability. Every point ( , ) on the concentration curve\n( )|\n( ) captures the fraction of total tax liabilities, 100  percent, paid by the poorest\nwe replace tax by net income, we can also produce a concentration curve |\n() for the\ndistribution of net income x with respect to gross taxable income y.\nConcentration coefficient\nLikewise, the concentration coefficient for a concentration curve is defined in the same\nfashion as the Gini coefficient is for a Lorenz curve. As a consequence, the concentration\ncoefficient can be expressed as twice the area between the line of perfect equality and a\ngiven concentration curve ( ) (Lambert (2001)). Following our example from above, the\nconcentration coefficient for the concentration curve ( )|\n( ) is defined as\n( )|\n( ) = 2 - ( )|\n( ) .\n3.2 Measures of progression\nFirst of all, it is vital to differentiate between (local) progression and (global) progressivity.12\nProgression measures identify the degree of progression of a tax schedule itself. Progressivity\nmeasures though intend to capture the change in equality of income distribution after applying\na certain redistribution policy. To determine progressivity, it is indispensable to know both\nthe pre and post-tax income distribution. However, the characteristic of the tax schedule itself\nis sufficient for calculating the progression.\nIn their seminal paper, Musgrave and Thin (1948) present four methods of measuring tax\nprogression: average rate progression, marginal rate progression, liability progression and\nresidual progression. All these measures describe the progression at the local point of income\ndistribution. Therefore, they are called local progression. In terms of average rate progression,\na tax schedule is said to be progressive (regressive) if the average tax rate increases (decreases)\nwith income. Respectively, in terms of marginal rate progression, a tax schedule is said to be\nprogressive (regressive) if the marginal tax rate increases (decreases) with income. Both\naverage and marginal rate progression can help to infer that a tax schedule is progressive or\nregressive. But they cannot help to rank two or more tax schedules. For this purpose,\nMusgrave and Thin (1948) introduce liability and residual progression.\nLiability progression\n12 They are also often referred to as structural progression (local progression) and effective progression (global\nprogressivity).\nLiability progression can be defined as liability elasticity \u00ad the ratio of the percentage change\nin tax liability to the concurrent percentage change in taxable income. It can be shown that\nliability progression equals\n( )\n( )\nwhere ( ) is the marginal tax rate and ( ) is the average tax rate. Whenever this elasticity\nis larger than 1, meaning that the marginal tax rate ( ) is larger than the average tax rate\n( ), the tax schedule is defined as \"liability elastic\", and accordingly, the income tax\nschedule is progressive. It will become clear that the redistributive property of a tax schedule\nis closely linked to local tax elasticity.\nResidual progression\nResidual progression is another measure of elasticity, which refers to net income. It is\ndesigned to analyse the residual elasticity, the percentage change in income after tax in\nresponse to a 1% increase in income before tax. It can be shown that residual progression\nequals\n( )\n( )\n.\nAgain, the tax schedule is progressive if the marginal tax rate is higher than the average tax\nrate. Contrary to liability progression, in this case the residual elasticity will be less than 1.\nThe tax schedule is then \"residual inelastic\".\n3.3 Measures of progressivity\nWe discuss the redistributive effect of tax schedules on income distribution, which is\ndetermined by both the empirical income distributions and the tax schedule. We only cover\nthose progressivity measures that will be used in our empirical analysis.\nRedistributive effect\nThe measure Musgrave and Thin (1984) introduce in their seminal paper captures the\nredistributive effect ( ) of a tax schedule by subtracting the net income Gini coefficient ( )\nfrom the gross taxable income Gini coefficient ( )\n= - .\nAccording to the definition of the Gini coefficient described above, we can also express as\ntwice the area between the Lorenz curve of gross taxable income ( ) and the Lorenz\ncurve of net income ( ):\n= 2 [ ( ) - ( )] .\nA positive value of implies a progressive redistribution through taxation since it reduces\nthe inequality of income distribution by the income tax levied. A negative value of implies\nthe opposite. And a value of zero means that we are dealing with a proportional income tax\nsystem.\nKakwani (1977a and 1977b) demonstrates that the redistributive effect, as presented by\nMusgrave and Thin, only depicts a change in inequality, without capturing tax progressivity\non its own. Plotnick (1981) recognise a further complication when comparing the Gini\ncoefficient of the distribution of pre-tax income with that of post-tax income, namely that\ntheir respective Lorenz curves do not guarantee that, say, the 40% poorest income units in\nterms of pre-tax income are the same 40% poorest income units in terms of post-tax income.\nThis problem, which is caused by income taxation due to differences in the tax treatment of\nincome units, was categorised by Atkinson (1980) and Plotnick (1981) in the process of\nreranking.\nThe widely accepted Kakwani decomposition of the redistributive effect captures, on the one\nhand, the progressivity effect through the vertical effect measuring how the inequality of\nincome distribution among income units is reduced or amplified without changing their ex-\nante relative positions, and, on the other, the horizontal effect in terms of reranking, which\nonly captures the change in the relative positions of income units in the income distribution\nafter the application of the income tax schedule. Formally, the Kakwani decomposition states\nthat\n= - = - ,\nwhere is the vertical effect and is the reranking effect. Furthermore, is a function of\nthe Kakwani index ( ) and the average tax rate ( ). is simply the ratio of\naggregate tax revenue and total household pre-policy income. We next elaborate on the other\nfactors - , and .\nVertical effect\nIn order to be able to measure Kakwani's vertical effect (Urban (2009)) or in other words, to\ncalculate the redistributive effect alone without allowing for reranking, Reynolds and\nSmolensky (1977) propose an index which equals the Gini coefficient of gross taxable\nincome minus the concentration coefficient of net income with respect to gross taxable\nincome |\n. It can also be expressed as twice the area between the Lorenz curve of gross\ntaxable income ( ) and the concentration curve of net income with respect to gross\ntaxable income |\n= 2 [ ( ) - |\n( )] .\nThe in the Kakwani decomposition is actually equivalent to .\nKakwani index\nAs mentioned previously, Kakwani (1977a) not only shows that the redistributive effect\ncaptures a change in inequality alone, but he further introduces a progressivity measure\nknown in the literature as the index. He argues that the progressivity of income\ntaxation should be measured as the departure from proportionality of a certain tax system.13\nFollowing this logic, Kakwani (1977a) introduces an index to measure the progressivity of\nincome taxation as the difference between the concentration coefficient of taxes with respect\nto gross taxable income ( )|\nand the Gini coefficient of gross taxable income . This\nindex is thus twice the area between the Lorenz curve of taxable ( ) income and the\nconcentration curve of taxes with respect to gross taxable income ( )|\n( ) (Lambert\n= 2 [ ( ) - ( )|\n( )] .\nThis index and jointly determine and their impacts offset each other.\nReranking effect\nReranking occurs when income earners change their rankings in the population measured by\nthe income distribution before and after tax. Before giving a suitable mathematical expression\nfor the reranking effect, it is important not to mistake the reranking effect as being\nsynonymous with the horizontal effect. The latter is caused by an unequal treatment of equals\nthrough the tax system. Yet, horizontal inequality does not necessarily need to rerank income\nunits after taxation (Aronson, Johnson and Lambert (1994)). Hence, we can state that\nreranking always implies horizontal inequity, while the opposite statement is a misleading one.\n13 A proportional tax system will result in the same Gini coefficient for pre-policy and post-policy income.\nAs previously stated, it was Atkinson (1980) and Plotnick (1981) who introduced an index to\nmeasure the reranking effect ( ) of income taxation as the difference between the Gini\ncoefficient of net income , and the concentration coefficient of net income with respect to\ngross taxable income |\n. It can also be expressed as twice the area between the Lorenz\ncurve of net income ( ) and the concentration curve of net income with respect to gross\ntaxable income |\n( ) - ( )] .\nIf reranking exists, then, for instance, the 40% poorest income units in terms of pre-tax\nincome will not be the same 40% poorest income units in terms of post-tax income. To know\nexactly what happened to the 40% of poorest income units after taxation, we compute the\nconcentration curve of net income with respect to gross taxable income, which, in turn, helps\nus to separate the reranking effect from the overall redistributive effect.\nIn summary, the vertical effect or the pure progressivity effect, calculated by the Reynolds-\nSmolensky index, measures the total increase in equality caused through income taxation,\nwhile the reranking effect, calculated through the index introduced by Atkinson (1980) and\nPlotnick (1981), \"(...) measures how much of this equalising effect is `undone' by reranking\"\n3.4 Channels of inflation-induced distortion on the redistributive\neffect\nTo mathematically conceptualise the distortions of the tax function through inflation, let us\nuse a general formula for income taxes:\n( ) = ( \u00ad ( ) ) \u00ad ( ),\nwhere t(y) represents taxes with respect to the pre-tax income level y, s(.) stands for the tax\nrate schedule, a(.) includes all the deductions, and finally c(.) stands for tax credits. In terms\nof s(.), liability progressivity will drop with the rise of y if liability elasticity is monotonically\ndecreasing (Keen, Papapanagos and Shorrocks (2000)).14 Inflation-induced erosions of tax\ncredits will always reduce liability progressivity. However, the effect is ambiguous as far as\nthe erosion of deductions and tax bracket limits are concerned. Additionally, inflation erosion\nmay not always increase the taxable income y (eg when considering the tax deductibility of\nsocial contributions).\n14 Liability elasticity for the German tax schedule in recent years is monotonically decreasing almost everywhere\nBesides the liability progressivity, the size of the tax burden and income sharing within\nhouseholds due to splitting also contribute to the redistributive effect of a tax system.15 The\nsocial insurance contributions constitute the other force in reshaping the distributions of\ndisposable household income. Immervoll (2005) argues that it is necessary to apply the micro-\nsimulation approach in order to quantitatively measure the impact when confronted with these\nindefinite distortions.\n4 Data and Methodology\nIn this section, we illustrate the data, the micro-simulation model adopted and how the\nsimulation scenarios are set up.\n4.1 Data and micro-simulation model\nIn our model, all calculations are performed on income data from the Panel on Household\nFinances (PHF), a national panel survey about German household finances and wealth. The\nPHF is part of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS), a joint effort which\ncollects ex ante harmonised micro data in the euro-area countries (Von Kalckreuth, Eisele,\ntheir balance sheets, pension claims, savings, incomes and other issues related to their\nfinances. The reference year for these data was 2009.\n15 See Appendix A for a description of the tax treatment for partners with different pre-tax income forming the\nsame household as well as of the structure of the tax function in Germany.\nTable 1 Income variables relevant to tax conversion and microsimulation\nIncome\nvariable\nHousehold\n(h) or\npersonal (p)\nlevel\nLabel\nAccounting\nperiod\nvariable1)\nVariable to\ndetermine whether\nincome flow is\nreceived throughout\nthe year2)\nMonths received if\nthe income flow is\nnot received\nthroughout the\nGross-net\nCOMPANIES\nNotes: 1) Income value can be provided on either an annual or monthly basis. This variable does not exist when we only ask for annual income. 2-3) When we ask for\nannual income only, this variable does not exist. 4) Respondents can provide either gross or net figures. We assume that the gross income is always reported if this\noption is not available. Usually, they are not liable for tax pursuant to the tax code or the respondents most probably provide the gross value given the special\ninstitutional setting in Germany (eg unemployment income (dpg1000) is partially levied since it enters the tax base to boost the marginal tax rate for the other income\ncomponents due to progressivity, but the tax on it is waived). 5) In German upfront taxation, bonus income (dpg0210) is added to annual employment income\n(dpg0200) to determine the total annual tax liability. Then the tax liability for the annual employment income is calculated separately. The difference becomes the tax\nliability for the bonus income which we perceive in forming the net bonus income reported.\nThe tax micro-simulation model we use is developed from a module of the net-gross\nconversion of income which is embedded in the imputation process for the PHF. The\nPHF questionnaire allows the respondent to select from a flexible dimension of formats\nregarding income information: components (eg labour, capital, pension, social\nbenefits,...), individual and household levels, time (yearly, monthly, quarterly, other\nspecified duration or months whenever the flows are incomplete throughout the year),\ngross or net, quantity in brackets and different currencies. Table 1 summarises these\nspecifications for all the income variables involved with tax conversion and micro-\nsimulation.\nTherefore, we have to convert all the income variables to a common unit \u00ad the annual\ngross concept \u00ad in order to ensure a legitimate basis for implementing imputation\nalgorithms and miscellaneous estimates. Appendix B describes the main assumptions\nand procedures involved with the gross-net conversion.\nThe tax micro-simulation can be deemed a gross-to-net conversion where the input is all\nthe gross income components liable to tax aggregated from all members of each tax unit.\nThe tax unit is formed by either single persons or married heterosexual couples.\nCompared to the tax conversion, the procedures involved in tax class choice are omitted.\nWe assume that spouses always file a joint tax return and that capital income is treated\nseparately by the flat rate withholding tax (Abgeltungssteuer).\nThis model is similar in many aspects to the Siena Micro-simulation Model (SM2) and\nEUROMOD, particularly regarding the rules on tax treatment and social insurance\ncontributions.16 The main difference between the SM2 and the model we used is that we\ndo not perform the iterative process between imputation and net-gross income\nconversion when some information required for conversion is missing.17 In the case of\nsocial benefits, we only use the self-reported benefit incomes. We use all the lump-sum\ntax allowances for each tax unit. Instead, EUROMOD imputes the social benefits\nincome by assuming full take-up and matches with official tax statistics to simulate the\n16 The SM2 is a flexible tool for net-gross income conversion and imputation used in some countries.

For the case of Germany in\n17 The iterative process consists of applying imputation and modelling routines iteratively and in\ncombination (Betti et al (2011)). The iterative process seems to be ideal but is rather resource-demanding.\nindividual-specific tax expenses.\nTable 2: Income distribution of tax payers: Wage and Income tax statistics vs PHF\nNext, we assess the representativeness of our income distribution. The weighted\nproportion of the total income (Summe der Eink\u00fcnfte) earners estimated from our\noriginal data according to the fine brackets in the wage and income tax statistics (Lohn-\nund Einkommensteuerstatistik 2010, Federal Statistical Office (2014)) agrees with the\nBrackets of total income (Summe\nder Eink\u00fcnfte)\nPersons liable for\ntax\n%\nPersons\nliable for tax\n%\nNotes: 1) The bracket with negative income is collapsed into the first one since negative figures are not\nallowed in the PHF. 2) We assume the PHF covers all the residents liable to income tax, which is the\nentire population of 20 years and older, less young adults eligible for child benefit. This size estimate is\net al (2013a), which is stable at around 65 million. The same estimate from the PHF is around 65.4\nmillion.\nSources: Wage and income tax statistics (Table 3, Federal Statistical Office, 2014, p.14) and own\ncalculation using PHF data and the same concept of total income (Summe der Eink\u00fcnft, \u00a7 2, German\nincome tax law (EStG)).\nofficial statistics satisfactorily (see Table 2).18 One potential source of deviation lies in\nthe fact that the wage and income tax statistics collect only information on the full\npopulation of tax filers but the population of non-tax filers is possibly incomplete.19\nSuch a difference is reflected by the evidence that the count is almost always higher in\nthe PHF data, which are supposed to cover all potential taxpayers. This table shows that\nthere is a slightly higher coverage of low income earners, which can be accounted for by\nthe concentration of potential non-tax filers among those marginally employed. 20\nAlthough wealthy households are oversampled in the PHF data (Schmidt and Eisele\n(2013)), the top rich households are still underrepresented in the PHF income\ndistribution.\nTo further assess our coverage, we calculate or collect the summary statistics for the\ntotal population, the number of tax filing units, gross market income, and relevant\nincome components calculated from income tax statistics, PHF data and, for comparison,\nthe national accounts. This is simply to reproduce Table A2 in Bach et al (2013a) for the\ncase of 2009 using PHF data. That table presents a comparison of the structure of the\nITR-SOEP data base with the national accounts. All the figures in our 2009 PHF\nestimates are very close to those in the ITR-SOEP results, particularly in 2005.21 The\ncorresponding figure for the 2005 ITR-SOEP data is 57.2%. Given the fact that the total\nnumbers of tax filing units and potential tax units should be stable within such a short\ntime interval, this similarity implies that the PHF data represent the potential tax unit\npopulation well. Compared to the national account aggregates, our coverage of income\ncomponents in the 2009 PHF data resembles that in the 2005 ITR-SOEP data. In the\n18 The 2009 wage and income tax statistics are unavailable. Since there were few changes to the income\ntax code between 2009 and 2010 and income distribution should be stable within such short duration in\nGermany, using the benchmark from 2010 should be justified. We could consider updating our\n19 German legislation on filing tax returns is outlined in Appendix A. Among the non-tax filers for whom\nfiling tax is not compulsory, the following populations are not represented or are underrepresented in the\nwage and income tax statistics: marginally employed, retirees/pensioners and those capital income earners\nwith few other sources of income.\n20 Appendix A explains the cause of such a concentration from the legislative perspective.\n21 Bach et al (2013a) match the Income Tax Return data (ITR) from income tax statistics and the German\nSocio-Economic Panel (SOEP) in such a way as to cover the whole German income distribution (1992-\n2005) from the bottom to the top. This integrated data is denoted ITR-SOEP. Given the similarity of the\nresults, we decide not to show them in order to save space. However, they are available on request.\n22 Total potential tax units consist of the entire population of 20 years and older, less young adults eligible\nfor child benefit; married couples count as one tax unit. We estimate the total of potential tax units from\nPHF data instead of census statistics as in Bach et al (2013a).\n2009 PHF data, the gross market income totalled 81.2% of primary income of private\nhouseholds, as documented by the national accounts statistics. This is in the range of the\nratios in other years. The wage income coverage is 98.1% in the 2009 PHF data, which\nis close to and better than the counterparts in other years. Business and capital income\nfrom the 2009 PHF data as a percentage of entrepreneurial and property income from\nTable 3: Income deciles from the PHF and decile means from survey data in 2009:\nequivalised disposable household income ( per year)\nDecile\nThresholds\nfrom PHF\nOverall:\nNotes: The \"modified OECD\" scale is used for equalising incomes of\nhouseholds of different structure and size. The respective weights are 1 (first\nadult), 0.5 (subsequent adults) and 0.3 (children aged below 14).\nSource: Own results using PHF data, EU-SILC micro data for 2009 and SOEP\nhas been adjusted to match the EUROMOD/EU-SILC concept where losses and\ncosts from renting and leasing as well as capital investment have been excluded\nTable 3 provides a comparison of equivalised disposable household income from\ndifferent sources. The PHF results are by and large close to the other three sources. In\nparticular, the PHF decile means are almost always within the interval between EU-\nSILC and SOEP for the lower half of the distribution. The PHF data overrepresent\ndeciles six to nine compared with EU-SILC and SEOP, which potentially indicates a\nhigher degree of oversampling. This is also reflected in the higher median and mean\nfrom the PHF data. The Gini index is also higher for the PHF. Together with the\nevidence in Table 2, the PHF income distribution seems to exhibit a longer and thinner\ntail among the top income earners.\nGiven these comparison results, we assert that the PHF should be capable of\nrepresenting the whole distribution of income except the very top. To assess the tax\nsystem empirically, it is essential that both the overall income tax revenue and the tax\nburden shares as simulated by our model are consistent with the benchmark statistics.\nTo meet the first condition, it is necessary to \"reweight\" the PHF income distribution to\namend the missing top distribution. This exercise uses the benchmark statistics from the\nIncome Tax Statistics (Einkommensteuerstatistik, Federal Statistical Office (2013)) in\n2009 which releases only the tabulated distribution of tax filing units in Table 3. These\nstatistics are preferred over the 2010 wage and income tax statistics discussed above\nbecause the former refers to 2009 and the tax unit is the direct basis in deriving income\ntax instead of the individual tax payer. The fluctuation of the top distribution between\nneighbouring years might not be negligible and almost all of them should have filed a\ntax return given the relatively higher incentive for them to take the rich set of\nallowances and deductions available only when filing a tax return. Since the PHF\ngathers no tax units in the brackets of  2,500,000 or more, we multiply the weights of\nthe richest subsample available in the PHF (those tax units in the bracket between\ngross taxable income from the tax units in the bracket between 1,000,000 and\ntop three brackets starting with 1,000,000 in the income tax statistics.\n4.2 Simulation scenarios\nIn this section, we describe the set-up we use to produce the empirical findings. For\neach inflation scenario, we proceed in the same manner as Immervoll (2005). We\nprorate all the incomes according to the inflation rate specified.23 Micro-simulation is\nthen performed under different inflation scenarios based on the income with and\nwithout nominal growth. The net income data under each regime are all saved toanalyse\nthe redistributive and revenue effects.\n23 Our study also partly relies on the assumption about zero real growth in income. Brenke and Grabka\n(2011) argue that real gross hourly wages in Germany have stagnated on average during the last decade.\nFor our simulations, we used a range of inflation rates between 1 and 90 percent. Taking\na historical perspective, over a few periods when there is no adjustment in combating\nbracket creep in Germany, the loss of real purchasing power as inflation accumulates\ncan climb by a non-negligible degree. As mentioned above, the German government\nonly takes discretionary measures against bracket creep by mixing such a purpose into\nvarious tax reforms aimed at relieving the general tax burden. In a narrow sense, only\nthe year with tax relief for the whole population to lower the average rates, progressivity\nand total tax revenue can be deemed a moment to offset the bracket creep effect.24 As\ndocumented by Corneo (2005) and Bach et al (2013a), there have been two periods,\nand 26.9% for the latter.26 We observe that there is almost a continuous increase in\nconsidered, in a broad sense, as an inflation cumulating duration in the context of\nbracket creep, with (cumulated) inflation accruing to 185.4%. Recently, there was no\nmajor tax relief between 2006 and 2014. This period produces cumulated inflation of up\nto 15.3%. By taking various standards, our simulated inflation scenarios seem to be\nreasonable.\nThroughout our paper, the economic income concept is adopted such that all sources of\nincomes are counted regardless of their taxability. Our gross income includes wage\nincome, business income, capital income, private and public transfer income (see Bach\net al (2013a) for the definitions which we also apply). The net, or disposable, income is\nderived as gross income minus income taxes, solidarity surcharge, church tax, capital\nincome tax and social insurance contributions.\nIn this exercise, we profit from the strength of the micro-simulation approach, which\n\"(...) lies precisely in its ability to analyze one type of change at a time while holding\n`everything else' constant\" (Immervoll (2005), p 44). On the other hand, we recognise\n24 One major approach to reduce the general tax burden is to drop the average tax rate for all. In terms of\nbracket creep, depressing the progressivity can also work, sometimes independent of the change in\naverage tax rate. Besides these options, other policy changes can also deflate the effective tax load, eg by\nshrinking the tax base, which can be indirectly measured by the change in tax revenue.\n25 The author chooses 1958 as the starting year, when income splitting for spouses was introduced into the\ncurrent system of family taxation.\n26 We calculate these from the annual inflation available in the \"Consumer Prices (MEI)\" dataset of\nOECD statistics (http://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DatasetCode=MEI_PRICES, accessed on 7 May 2015).\nthat the accuracy of our empirical findings might be enhanced by taking into account\npotential behavioural reactions to a real income drop owing to bracket creep.\nFurthermore, there are some differences between our simulation environment and\nreality. Similar to the drawbacks in the EUROMOD summarised by Immervoll (2005),\nand in spite of the fulfilling recovery of the distribution reported by income tax statistics\nand other sources, there are still uncertainties in defining what is counted in a given tax\ncategory, tax evasion, less than perfect representation of tax rules in model algorithms\nand, importantly, shortcomings in the underlying micro-data, such as\nunderrepresentation of high income groups or missing information about tax\nexpenditure. Furthermore, while our reweighting on the top rich should have pulled the\nrevenue effect in to line with income tax statistics, we do not recover the distribution\nperfectly. The real income distribution should be more concentrated because we retrieve\nthe missing income from the top rich by inflating the population of the less rich\nsubgroup instead of imputing this small group at the very end of the income distribution.\nWe can then infer that our result is simply a conservative estimate.\n5 Empirical Findings\nThis section provides quantitative answers as to how bracket creep changes the\nequalising effect of the IT and SIC system.\n5.1 Inverted U-shaped relationship of RE and inflation rate\nBefore proceeding with the empirical analysis, we should review the concepts on\ndefined in section 3.2. Figure 1 illustrates the measurement of and the further\ndecomposition, which can reinforce our intuitive understanding of the following results.\nis simply the area between the Lorenz curves (LC) for taxable and net income. If we\nassume the population rankings were not disturbed by the redistribution, our measure of\nis exactly the , which is the area between the LC for taxable income and the\nconcentration curve (CC) for net income. In most cases, the rankings using taxable and\nnet income are not constant. Therefore, the difference between and constitutes\nthe reranking effect (R) which is, as observed from Figure 1, the area between CC for\nnet income and LC for net income.\nFigure 1 A graphical exposition of the redistributive effect, vertical effect and\nreranking\nTable 4: Loss of household net incomes as a percentage of gross income induced by\nbracket creep under different inflation scenarios\nInflation\nrate %\nDeciles\nNotes: Decile groupings are determined by the distribution of the equivalised household disposable\nincome (EHDI) in the regime without indexation. The \"modified OECD\" scale is used for equivalising\nincomes of households of different structure and size. The respective weights are 1 (first adult), 0.5\n(subsequent adults) and 0.3 (children aged below 14). Relative loss is calculated for each household as\nthe difference of net income before and after bracket creep divided by the gross income and multiplied\nby 100. Each cell contains the decile mean of the relative loss from all the households within deciles.\nIn each row, darker background shading emphasises lower values. The smallest value per row is in bold\nand italics.\nSource: Tax micro-simulation model using PHF data.\nWe first examine how differently German households along the net income distribution\nwould incur losses from bracket creep under different inflation scenarios. Table 4\npresents this evaluation. Every column depicts the mean percentage loss of German\nhousehold net income with respect to gross income in every decile of the distribution.27\nFor instance, with the nominal gross income growing at the same pace with 1% of\ninflation, the household in the 7th decile can experience a loss of real net income\naveragely equivalent to 0.161% of their gross income. Irrespective of the decile\nobserved, the higher the inflation rate involved in bracket creep, the higher the loss of\nall household incomes. Nevertheless, regarding the losses in household income\ndistribution, an uneven development becomes clear. The poorest as well as the richest\nhouseholds will not lose as much in relative terms from bracket creep as those\nhouseholds at the middle of the income distribution. This pattern is strongly related to\nthe varying progression along the income tax schedule. A large number of household\nincomes will remain below the basic tax allowance while, at the opposite end of the\nincome distribution, the top two richest deciles will face the flat marginal income tax\nrates. At the same time, all the other household incomes that are in the more progressive\npart of the income tax function will thus experience a higher relative income tax load\nfor every additional euro they earn. Bach et al (2013b) gather similar results when\nanalysing the relief effect for households after applying an indexation proposal which\nrecovers the average tax rates for almost all parts of the income distribution.28\nIn addition, the rank of relative loss is not constant under different inflation scenarios.\nAs inflation grows above 1%, the poorer receive a greater relative loss than the richer as\nthe shading becomes increasingly darker in the lower part of the distribution represented\nby the heat map. The largest loser shifts from the richer middle class (7th decile) to the\npoorer middle class (6th decile; see the column highlighted in bold font). The exception\nat the case of 1% seems to be driven by the outliers. As a robust illustration, we present\nthe distribution of relative loss in an alternative Figure 2 when the inflation rate is 1%, 5%\nand 10%. The relative loss is defined by the same approach as before. However, this\ndisplay differs from the previous tabulation in three respects: first, the income\n27 Table 13 in Appendix C contains the decile mean value of the absolute loss. For instance, in terms of\nequivalised household disposable income, the households in the 6th decile lose an average of 153 for a\none-shot nominal income growth at 4% cumulated inflation. Due to tax progressivity, the absolute loss of\nbracket creep grows monotonically with the income level.\n28 This indexation is thus a mirror image of bracket creep on the tax schedule.\ndistribution is defined over the equivalised gross household income (EGHI); second, the\npercentile is used to decompose the income distribution; third, the median of relative\nloss is calculated for each percentile. This figure demonstrates the local polynomial\nsmooth plot of the bivariate relationship between relative loss and income distribution\nand ignores the underlying scatterplot for clarity.29 We also mark the peak and the\nassociated EGHI where the relative loss achieves the maximum for each scenario.\nBesides the bell curve development of the relative loss and ever increasing relative loss\nwith inflation as observed from previous tabulation, we can identify exactly the EGHI at\nwhich the relative loss starts to fall. For example, when nominal income growth is 5%\nfor the whole distribution, the relative loss due to bracket creep increases with EGHI, as\nlong as it is smaller than  22,182, and falls thereafter. The monotonic downward trend\nof the maxima as inflation grows starting from 1% supports our outlier judgment for the\ncase of 1% in the previous tabulation.\nFigure 2 Relative loss (change of net income divided by gross income) over gross\nincome level owing to bracket creep\nscenarios (1%, 5% and 10%) are illustrated and indicated on the top of the fitting cureves. Besides, the\npeak and the associated equivalised gross household income (y) where the relative loss achieves the\nmaximum for each scenario are represented by the droplines.\nSource: Tax micro-simulation from PHF data.\nTo investigate the underlying mechanism, we turn to the Kakwani decomposition of RE\n29 The 95% confidence interval almost collapses along the curves so that we choose not to display it.\nrelative loss\npercentile of equivalised household gross income\nintroduced in section 3. Table 5 contains this result by presenting the redistributive\neffect of the IT and SIC system hit by bracket creep under different inflation scenarios.\nTable 5: Redistributive effect (RE) of the IT and SIC system with bracket creep under\ndifferent inflation scenarios\nIt becomes evident that there is an inverted U-shaped RE evolution when inflation\nmounts up. This simply echoes the evidence found above on the relative loss. The\nhighest RE is associated with about 20% inflation. In the other exercise, in which all the\nsocial benefit incomes lag in nominal compensation, the peak arrives at about 10% of\ninflation.30 This fact is in contrast with Immervoll (2005), who shows that fiscal drag\nalways intensifies the RE and this effect is monotonic with inflation. Similar to his\nstudy, bracket creep worsens the progressivity of the IT and SIC system as the Kakwani\nindex drops when inflation grows but the ever increasing average tax counteracts with\nthe progressivity effect. We show that in 2009 the effect of average tax no longer\ndominates as claimed by Immervoll (2005). Since RE is the sum of VE and R, and R is\nmuch smaller in relative terms, VE also bears the pattern of inverted U-shaped\ndevelopment, which is the function of the Kakwani index and ATR.\nTo explore the causes of the inverted U-shaped development, we further decompose the\nRE introduced purely by bracket creep into two parts of the contributions: income tax\nschedule (ITS) and deductions \u00ad taxable income \u00ad social insurance contributions (DTS)\nas explained in section 3.4. To do so, we isolate the RE due to bracket creep (on ITS\n30 See Table 14 in Appendix D.

This indexation is to adjust all\nthe slopes and corners on the bracket such that the nominally inflated taxable income\nshould be subject to the same average tax rate as the one when income is not inflated.\nAs mentioned above, this indexation is a mirror image of the bracket creep on the tax\nschedule only. Table 6 presents this result.\nTable 6: Separate redistributive effects (RE) owing to the bracket creep effect on the\nincome tax schedule (ITS) and deductions - taxable income - social insurance\ncontributions (DTS)\nSurprisingly, RE is negative for the bracket creep on ITS. If there is no change between\ngross income and taxable income as defined in the tax code, bracket creep can be\noverall regressive in terms of the redistribution through ITS only. A dual tax system\nbetween income tax and capital income tax induces such a remarkable change. Through\na yield test, taxpayers can file capital income tax together with non-capital income as\nlong as the total tax liable drops compared with the one, as a default, from the sum of\ntwo separate taxes \u00ad a capital income tax withheld at source and an income tax on non-\ncapital income. This potential saving consists of two parts. The first part derives from\ncapital income which depends on the difference between the marginal tax rate of the\n31 See the notes below Table 6 for the approach to reach such decomposition.\nInflation\nrate %\nG_pre G_post RE ATR Kakwani VE R RE\nNotes: For the ITS, G_pre represents the Gini of EHDI after indexation and G_post is the Gini of EHDI\nafter inflation but without indexation.

To\nsave space, we only demonstrate the RE for the DTS.\nIn each column, darker background shading emphasises higher values.

The second part comes from the non-capital\nincome which is determined by the difference between the marginal tax rates of two tax\nbases \u00ad non-capital taxable income added with and without capital taxable income.\nThese two parts of savings, for most at both ends of the distribution, are meaningless\nbecause their marginal tax rates are far away from 25% and they are situated in the flat\ntax rate (either zero or the top rates, 42% or 45%). Therefore, only the middle part of\ndistribution is relevant. Due to the progressivity and the positive relationship of the\nconcentration of capital income and total income, both parts of saving are more likely to\nfall below zero for the relatively richer middle class as nominal income grows.\nConsequently, the extensive margin is higher for some of them to switch from filing\nboth incomes together to the default state. The intensive margin of such a switch is also\nhigher for the richer at the middle of distribution as trivially inferred from the structure\nof these two parts of savings. On the whole, the part of bracket creep induced by the tax\nschedule renders a regressive redistribution. It reflects that the effect from the yield test\nof a dual tax system dominates the effect from tax progressivity.\nThe overall equalising effect measured by RE from income tax again bears an inverted\nU-shaped relationship with the inflation rate. This should be explained again by the\ninteraction of progressivity (Kakwani index) and the average tax rate. However, we also\nobserve the kink points on both evolutions of the average tax rate and the Kakwani\nindex. As inflation moves above 20%, the average tax load starts to become negative\nand Kakwani switches from negative to positive. This means some populations even\ngain considerably from the bracket creep on tax schedule only. The intensive margin of\nthe switch discussed above contributes to such a gain.\nThe overall RE development from DTS, as inflation rises, illustrates the monotonically\ndecreasing progressivity. Therefore, we can infer that the offsetting redistribution\neffects developed with the growth of the inflation rate between ITS and DTS introduce\nthe other channel for the inverted U-shaped relationship in the overall IT and SIC\nsystem, besides the interaction between progressivity of the tax schedule and the ever\nincreasing tax burden.\n5.2 Revenue effect of bracket creep\nWe next evaluate the revenue effect of bracket creep. Table 7 demonstrates the tax\nrevenue gain from bracket creep under four different inflation scenarios. For instance, if\ninflation as well as nominal incomes had increased by 4%, the government would gain\naround 5.73 billion more in real income tax revenue, even though real incomes\nexperienced no change at all. This 5.73 billion represents a redistribution of income\nfrom households to the government which is to be fully attributed to the effect of\nbracket creep.\nTable 7: Revenue gain after bracket creep under different inflation scenarios\nReal revenue gain (in  billion)\nInflation rate %\nSource: Tax micro-simulation model using PHF data.\nWe observe that the ratio of real revenue gains in either of the two scenarios is very\nclose to the ratio of their inflation rates. Under a moderately low inflation rate, this can\nbe considered as a rule of thumb as we can show that the relative real revenue gain is\nmore or less the inflation rate \u00ad which generally holds under both the flat rate and\npiecewise-linear taxes with lump-sum allowances.32 In a country where there is no\nautomatic indexation, it is not unrealistic to build up relatively high (cumulative)\ninflation, implying that the revenue effect can grow to a considerable degree from\n32 Let the tax schedule function be ( ) = + , where is the taxable income, for a bracket in the\nrange of to . The total tax revenue under no inflation is thus = ( ) = ( - ) + ( -\n) if there is a uniform income distribution on this bracket (this can be considered as an approximate to\nreality or we can imagine dividing one bracket into however many brackets where each distribution is\nclose to uniform). It is then trivial to derive the total real tax revenue under inflation\n= ( ) /(1 + )\n( )\n( )\nand show ( - )/  as long as is negligibly small compared\nwith ( + ), which is the case for Germany. Summing up all the brackets, we should achieve the same\nresult. We ignore the jump up to the higher bracket for the top end as we assume a moderately low\ninflation rate and some degree of offsetting from the other top end in the lower bracket.\nThe quadratic term in the German tax schedule function is almost zero. Thus, the German tax schedule\nfunction approximates to a piecewise-linear tax with lump-sum allowances.\nbracket creep, unless there are some other compensation mechanisms.33 Then the size of\nredistribution can grow proportionally with cumulated inflation as we show in Table 7\neven when inflation does not pick up dramatically.\n6 Discussion\nOur finding of the inverted U-shaped development of the redistributive effect would\ncontribute more economic insight if we also studied the relevant root in income\ndistribution and tax schedule between 1998 (reference year in Immervoll (2005)) and\n2009. On the other hand, our evaluation can shed some light on the discretionary\ninflation indexation which is typically practiced in Germany.\n6.1 The underlying changes in income distribution and tax\nTo understand how much income distribution and tax schedule changed between 1998\nand 2009, we plot the taxable income distribution from PHF data as well as the\nImmervoll (2005)). Such a comparison is shown in Figure 3.35 We observe that the\nwhole income distribution shifts upwards. In particular, the highest peak at the very low\nend grows at the fastest pace.36 Using official income tax statistics, Table 4 in Hechtner\net al (2012) documents the same pattern with the poorest two decile means of taxable\nmarginal tax rate drops everywhere. Corneo (2005) indicates that such a sharp downturn\nstarted in 1999 together with progressivity and tax revenue.37 Figure F.1 in Online\nAppendix depicts this drop for local progression (ie, an increase in residual progression\nalmost everywhere). The most significant evolution occurs at the highest peak in the\n33 Germany employs these discretionary alternatives in offsetting the revenue effect, which usually does\nnot fully account for the redistribution effect.\n34 A rigorous examination should be built on an analytical tool linking local progression and global\nprogressivity. Jakobsson (1976) and Kakwani (1977b) present the theories. Nevertheless, their conditions\nare too strong and of little practical value for the German tax system. Our exploration borrows the\nintuition from them but can be speculative.\n35 The rich tax (Reichensteuer) area is not included. With the domain extended to cover it, none of the\nconclusions change.\n36 This is a result of the behavioural response predicted from the standard labour supply model (see the\nanalysis and empirical evidence presented by Saez (2010)).\n37 Figure 1 in Bach et al (2013a) documents the decrease in average and marginal tax rates everywhere\ndensity plot of taxable income. It moves from an area much below the basic allowance\nin 1998 to somewhere in the second tax bracket. The outcome of this evidence is the\ndramatic increase between 1998 and 2009 in local empirical progression and the tax\nburden for the lower part of taxable income distribution, specifically the second decile\n(corresponding to the highest peak), which is documented in Figure F.2 and Figure F.3\nin Online Appendix. The effect of income growth dominates the overall downgrading of\nlocal progression for this part of distribution. On the other hand, the tax rates and\nprogression drop more remarkably at the middle and top of the distribution (see also\nThere can be two parallel versions of analysis on progressivity of the tax schedule by\nadopting either liability or residual progressions as introduced in section 3.2. We first\nexplore by using the latter approach since it can better accommodate the joint\ndevelopment of the income distribution and tax schedule. The other approach is then\noffered as a comparison of the same analysis in Immervoll (2005).\nWe can now consider the bracket creep effect as the shift of income distribution to the\nright with the tax curve fixed. In 1998, as the local maxima of taxpayer density moved\nto start paying tax and towards the more progressive tax zone, global progressivity was\ngradually enhanced. But in 2009, this mass of population was already situated in the\nvery progressive area and heavily levied (see Figure F.2 and Figure F.3 in Online\nAppendix).39 Moving to the right means that they are pushed to a less progressive area.\nRegarding the right tail of the distribution, it is still far from the flat tax zone\ncontributing little to progressivity in 1998. But it is not so far in 2009. Additionally, the\nmiddle and high income groups are confronted with much lower progression as stated\nabove. Their evolution due to bracket creep becomes the other channel to lower the\n38 Besides the decline in tax rates, structural change between 1998 and 2009 in the tax system fuels the\ndrop in progression markedly: the threshold to enter the top brackets with marginally flat tax is lower so\nthat more of the middle income population is no longer subject to directly progressive tax (the marginal\ntax rates increase with taxable income); additionally, capital income was excluded from the progressive\ntax schedule and replaced with a flat rate much lower than the top marginal tax rates (25% compared with\n42% and 45%) which dampens the tax load and progression of the middle and top distribution more than\nthe lower part.\n39 These areas for both years correspond to the first valley at the basic allowance in the residual\nprogression curves as displayed in Figure F.1 in Online Appendix.\nFigure 3: Taxable income distribution and marginal tax rates in Germany (1998 vs\nSource: A. Figure 1, Immervoll (2005); B. own derivation using PHF data\nFigure 4 Liability progression of the German income tax schedule (2009) over\ntaxable income\nSource: Own derivation\nThe above analysis takes the perspective of residual progression. We can also perform\nthe other version of analysis by adopting liability progression and linking it to global\nprogressivity via the Kakwani decomposition. Figure 4 plots the liability progression of\ndistribution from the bottom would join the \"tax-paying club\" was the main driver to\nlower liability progressivity. However, this movement from the bottom part of the\ndistribution is slightly offset by a movement in the opposite direction as the middle and\ntop of the distribution are simultaneously pushed to a more progressive tax zone. On the\nother hand, many households have their taxable income inflated and spread onto the\nlinear progressive part of the tax schedule (the most progressive zone) from the zero tax\n40 The basic shape of the counterpart for the 1998 tax schedule resembles this one.\nzone. Consequently, there is a significant increase in the overall tax burden, which\nImmervoll (2005) empirically shows, dominating the decreasing liability progressivity.\nIn 2009, the offsetting force against lowering liability progressivity was weaker or\nprobably even reversed, as we can draw from the discussion above. Furthermore, the\nincrease in the average tax rate as induced by nominal income growth was also weaker\nsince the tax rates were cut strongly at the middle and the top of distribution and less of\nthe population switched from paying nothing to a positive tax. The role of the rising\naverage tax burden does not dominate much, especially when inflation is cumulated up\nto a certain point.\n6.2 Delaying indexation\nGiven our results, the debates on the cost \u00ad benefit analysis of specific inflation targets\nmight benefit from including the redistributive effect through bracket creep, which is\nechoed in Altig and Carlstrom (1991, 1993). Besides the buildup of sizeable income\nredistribution from households to the government as shown in the preceding section,\nbracket creep may raise concerns about inequality. We argue, based on our result, which\ndiffers from Immervoll (2005), that delaying indexation aimed at fixing the distortion of\ntax redistribution, and allowing inflation to cumulate, does not always enlarge the\nequalising effect of the IT and SIC system. Delaying indexation for long enough can\nyield different redistribution implications.\n6.3 Is the German evidence relevant for other countries?\nImmervoll (2005) documents that the monotonically enhancing equalising effect\nintroduced by higher inflation-induced erosion is present not only in Germany but also\nin the Netherlands and the UK. The assessment in Levy, Nogueira, Siqueira, Immervoll\nand O'Donoghue (2010) yields the same pattern for Brazil's income data in 2003. As\nnominal income grows over the whole distribution, the average tax rate is higher and the\nliability progressivity as indicated by the Kakwani index is lower in all these countries.\nThese dynamics still persist in our simulation. But the dominant influence from the\nincreasing average tax rate is not preserved. In our result, the increasing tax burden for\nthe rich cannot compensate the reduced progressivity. The question that follows is\nwhether this is a development specific only to Germany and whether the role of falling\nprogressivity also expands to turn around the positive growth path of the redistributive\neffect in other countries' tax-benefit systems when inflation cumulates. This\ninvestigation can be very meaningful for all the countries without automatic inflation\nindexing or with only infrequent adjustment.41\nVerbist (2004) and Verbist and Figari (2014) find two lines of relationships between\ninequality and the redistribution preference to be always significant: a negative\nassociation between the pre-tax income inequality and the average tax level as well as a\nnegative one between the average tax level and local progressivity, as measured by the\nKakwani index. The former relationship seems to confirm the perception that more\nunequal societies demand less redistribution by lowering the average tax level.42 The\nlatter can be interpreted as a result of the political bargaining process. It is easier to\nconvince the higher part of the distribution to take on a greater tax burden when the tax\nweight is rather mild. But when the aggregate tax volume reaches a certain level, a\nmuch broader part of the distribution would be required by the others to share the\nburden so that their relative difference is less prominent.\nOver the last decade many studies have demonstrated the remarkable rise of pre-tax\nMcKnight, T\u00f3th and van de Werfhorst (2014)). According to the relationships discussed\nabove, we should observe a trend of a lower average tax level as well as higher\nprogressivity in those countries with growing inequality. These combinations represent\na new range of both the average tax level and the Kakwani index which have not been\ndocumented in the previous tax-benefit systems before and after bracket creep. 43\n41 OECD (2008a) shows that there are several countries which do not implement automatic inflation\nindexing in Annex Table S.A4. Box 1 in the same paper reports that the scope of adjustments is not\ncomplete, time lags can be notable and the targeted compensation may be insufficient if the inflation\nthreshold is not reached.\n42 In the political economy literature, the \"Meltzer-Richard model\" argues that growing inequality tends\nto impoverish the median voters and hence lends support to more redistribution. The \"Moene-Wallerstein\nmodel\" disagrees but points out that common factors exist for both higher inequality and less\nredistribution, eg capital market imperfection, strong belief in individual responsibility and the market.\nSee section 5 of Verbist and Figari (2014) for this debate. Also note that the scope and measurement\nadopted by the studies in Verbist (2004) and Verbist and Figari (2014) are close to ours although the\nempirical evidence on this debate is not unanimous due to different data sources and years of studies.\n43 Following our argument, the starting point of the average tax rate in our 2009 German case is lower\ncase is higher than the counterpart in 1998. As discussed above, the empirical results always present an\nincreasing average tax rate and a declining Kakwani index as inflation grows. Therefore, as inflation\nclimbs, the simulated range of the average tax rate may always be lower in our study than that in\nTherefore, it leads us to postulate a possible switch of regime such that reduced\nprogressivity plays a more pivotal role in changing the redistributive effect when\ninflation accumulates. Potentially, the lower average tax level and higher progressivity\ncan be the driving forces such that the marginal contribution from the former is weaker\nand the marginal contribution from the latter is stronger as inflation increases.\n7 Capital income grows faster under flat rate tax\nIn the next stage of simulation, we start by introducing the environment of > , which\nsets the inflation compensation to differ between capital and non-capital incomes, with\nthe former always larger. There are two groups of scenarios: and are homogeneous\nor heterogeneous. First, the assumptions are proposed. Outcomes and investigation then\nfollow.\n7.1 Assumptions and scenarios\nA more interesting question arises. How would the redistributive effect of the IT and\nSIC system under bracket creep change if there were a dual tax system as well as > ?\nWe provide a simulation exercise below using our German case. However, this is not an\nissue specific only to Germany since such a dual income taxation has been introduced in\nNordic countries, Austria and the Netherlands. Before describing the scenarios to be\nsimulated, we first lay out and justify our assumptions.\nOne straightforward scenario to start with is to allocate the constant nominal growth\nrates ( and ) for both capital ( ) and non-capital ( ) incomes over the whole\npopulation and set / , as a measure of relative inflation compensation between capital\nand non-capital incomes, to be a number larger than one.44 Specifically, we consider\nthree combinations of and :  and ,  and /2 and 2 and /2. With this setting, it\nmakes sense to compare the first and second combinations as well as the second and\nthird combinations to identify the effect from larger / , since, at least, one component\nof incomes grows at the same pace for the same . To demonstrate the contribution of\nImmervoll (2005) and the simulated range of the Kakwani index in our study may always be higher than\n44 We associate with the total non-capital income which mainly includes the labour income for most of\nthe population. Also, for clarity, we actually treat and as the growth multipliers instead of growth\nrates in the following text. For example, the after nominal growth is .\nthe dual tax system to redistributive effect, a parallel simulation is always executed,\nreplacing the dual tax system by a comprehensive tax system for each combination. We\nrestore the comprehensive tax system by adding all the capital incomes to rental income\nand leaving capital incomes at zero. Under German tax law, rental income is included in\nthe non-capital income tax base. Throughout the paper, the scope of capital incomes in\nsimulation is, in line with German tax law, the capital return from private businesses or\ncompanies, financial investment and private pensions.45\nIt is trivial to speculate that imposing the comprehensive tax system to subject capital\nincome to progressive tax should enhance the redistributive effect of the IT and SIC\nsystem. As capital income is concentrated, incorporating capital income into the same\nincome tax base should raise the average and marginal tax rates of the top distribution.\nAdditionally, by dropping the dual tax system, we eliminate one significant regressive\nredistribution channel through bracket creep in the German dual tax system revealed in\nsection 5.1 \u00ad there is no longer any option available for the rich middle class to switch\nbetween filing capital income together with non-capital income as in the comprehensive\ntax system for tax return and treating them separately as in the dual tax system.\nHowever, when > is introduced, the total effect of bracket creep might not be clear.\nOn the one hand, > suggests that the total gross income would increase faster for\nthe rich than for the poor because of the concentration of capital income. As a result, the\ntax rates for the rich would be boosted even more than the others, which helps to\nequalise the distribution. But the faster growth of nominal income at the top could also\nmean the opposite because more rich households would be pushed into the flat rate\nzones in the German tax schedule, as illustrated in section 6.1, which reduces the\nredistributive effect through bracket creep.\nAs inflation hits, everyone seeks to secure inflation compensation from the various\nincome sources owned. Under this reality, the previous group of scenarios seem to be\nprofit distributions from a participating interest in a non- publicly traded business or a private partnership\nnot wholly owned by a household. dhg0800 is supposed to be mainly dividend and interest income.\ndpg0800 covers the distributions from private pensions. There is not enough information to derive the\nshare of earnings from a private pension which is taxable (Ertragsanteil). We treat 100% of dpg0800 as\ncapital income. Alternatively, we also experiment with a share of 18% which is considered, according to\nthe German Tax Code (Abgabenordnung), as the capital-earning part of most other private pensions\nwhich are not occupational or Riester or R\u00fcrup pensions. The results change little.\nrather unrealistic since and , in particular, / , could be as heterogeneous as the\nincome composition can be. A more reasonable assumption is that / depends on the\nrelative share of both incomes (ie / ) in each household.46 The most plausible\npostulation is that / is positively related with , which argues that each household\nmakes more of an effort and/or has more bargaining power to demand inflation\ncompensation from the income source which contributes the higher share. Alternatively,\nwe also entertain with a contrasting idea that / is negatively dependent on .47\nAdditionally, we always assume that households with maximum can obtain the\nlargest / among their choice set (maximum capital income bargaining restriction).\nThis is plausible since these households should have virtually no non-capital income as\ncapital income concentration is quite extreme.48\nAs before, we still assume that total nominal growth only compensates the aggregate\nreal loss due to inflation but not beyond. This is represented by an identity + =\n( + )(1 + ) , which is transformed as the inflation compensation\nrestriction ( , ; ) = + - (1 + )(1 + ) = 0, where is the inflation rate.\nThis again reflects that there is only inflation-driven nominal growth. Furthermore, in\ndoing so, we do not have to confront the difficulty, inherent in the previous\nhomogeneous and group of scenarios, of separating the redistributive effect\nintroduced by the bracket creep effect on the IT and SIC system from the effect induced\nby the shift of pre-tax income.49\nFinally, we impose  1 to reflect a wage rigidity restriction, and the core, >\nrestriction.\n46 We assume that households with the same share an identical / .\n47 This scenario might occur as a result of government interference in wealth concentration, for example,\nby rationing the capital return conditional on the income composition. A portfolio reshuffling can also be\na driving force, for instance, due to asymmetric information on return-risk generated by a varying degree\nof involvement in the capital market proxied by .\n49 To compare two income -tax systems which differ in both dimensions, Pogorelskiy, Seidl and Traub\n(2010) as well as Dardanoni and Lambert (2002) independently proposes two approaches. It is beyond the\nscope of this paper to proceed in that direction.\nFigure 5 Simulation assumptions and scenarios for compensating inflation when\nr>g\nFigure 5 illustrates the permissible combination of inflation compensation through\ncapital and non-capital incomes, and , and the simulation scenarios, given the ratio\nof capital and non-capital incomes for each household. The area RZC defines the\nchoice set for all the . ( , ; _ ) = 0 and ( , ; _ ) = 0 are the borders of\ninflation compensation restrictions, where _ and _ are the maximum and\nminimum observed in our sample. All the households are situated at one point on their\nown restriction ( , ; ) = 0, which is a straight line within the borders and passes\nthrough point C. > restriction rules out the area below the line CO. The vertical line\nRZ represents the wage rigidity restriction. On the other hand, by our assumptions the\nmaximum non-capital income growth is 1 + , under which the capital income growth\nis the same. Point C is in such a situation. This set should always include point Z as\nrequired by maximum capital income bargaining restriction. In the end, each scenario\nshould be defined by a set of points in the area RZC, which intersects with each line\n( , ; ) = 0, and neither of these two points stay on the same line ( , ; ) = 0.\nWe conduct simulations on three scenarios as indicated by s1 to s3 in Figure 5.50 The\nfollowing text describes the main motivations behind and we present the detailed\nconstruction of, the scenarios in Appendix E. s1 can be considered a steady state\nscenario \u00ad / is constant for all, which simply becomes a straight line ZM as an\nextension of the line OZ. The remaining two scenarios allow full heterogeneity in , ,\nand / . As already emphasised, the most important mechanism to relieve bracket\ncreep under a dual tax system is to raise the share of capital income, which is the\nequivalent of lifting / . With respect to the distribution effect, we postulate that the\nhigher the / assigned to the poor relative to the rich, the more equalising effect of\nbracket creep on the IT and SIC system.51 The income level is positively associated with\ncapital income concentration, ie , and the line ( , ; ) = 0 becomes steeper as\ndrops. Therefore, s2 is a pro-rich biased scenario and s3 is a pro-poor biased\nscenario.52 s1 might be ranked between the other two scenarios. Alternatively, we\nshould expect that s3 can improve (or worsen) the equalising effect of the IT and SIC\nsystem under bracket creep more than (or less than) the other two can. The same\npostulation applies to the relationship between s1 and s2.\nBoth gross capital and non-capital incomes are inflated according to and , located by\nfinding the intersection point of each scenario path and ( , ; ) = 0 given for each\nhousehold in the data. We consider the households with only capital (non-capital)\nincome by assigning full nominal growth equal to the inflation rate to capital (non-\ncapital) income. The same simulation procedure as described in the previous section is\nthen executed for each scenario.\n50 To make our exercise simpler, we only allow the combination of and to move on a continuous\nstraight line as decreases.\n51 The following analysis proves that this speculation is not sophisticated enough.\n52 Among the pro-rich and pro-poor groups of candidates, these two scenarios are both the median ones\nbecause point P is the middle point in the line RM, and point Q is also the middle point in the line MC.\n7.2 Results and analysis\nWe then present the simulation outcomes for both homogeneous and heterogeneous\nand groups of scenarios.\nTable 8 Redistributive effect (RE) of the IT and SIC system under dual and\ncomprehensive tax systems between r>g and r=g when r and g are homogeneous\nInflation\nrate % -\n\nr g G_pre\nDual tax system\nComprehensive tax\nsystem\nRE\nrelative\nchange\nbtw two\nsystems %\nRE/G_pre Relative\nchange from the\ncomparision\nscenario %1)\nRE RE/G_pre RE RE/G_pre\nDual\ntax\nsystem\nComprehensive\ntax system\n \n\nNotes: 1) The comparision scenario is the one sharing either r or g under the same inflation rate.

With\n> and homogeneous and , those with relatively more capital income would\nenjoy faster nominal growth of total gross income. Hence, G_pre is no longer constant\nin these two scenarios. Furthermore, we observe a growing G_pre as inflation rises.\nThis widening of inequality is even stronger as the gap between and rises. For\nexample, the G_pre when capital income grows by 20% and non-capital income grows\nby 5% is 0.4013. It is larger than the counterpart when capital income grows by 10%\nand non-capital income grows by 5%, which is 0.4004. This development of inequality\nserves as evidence for the uneven distribution of capital income. Higher inflation\ntriggers more intense concentration of capital income. Besides, due to this complication,\nwe have to normalise the RE measure by dividing it with G_pre when we compare the\nscenarios when > and those when = .\nThe reinstatement of the comprehensive tax system is always conducive to the\nredistribution. The relative change in RE between the comprehensive and the dual tax\nsystems is always well above zero. This change is persistently larger as / moves up\nfrom 1 to 2 and from 2 to 4. When the gap between and expands, the RE-\nsuppressing effect of > due to pushing the rich faster towards the flat tax zones\nunder the comprehensive tax system is increasingly dominated by the RE enhancing\neffects \u00ad higher total average and marginal tax rates at the top of distribution as well as\nthe disappearance of the tax arbitrage opportunity for the rich middle class. The\nintensification on redistribution by a switch to the comprehensive tax system is quite\nsizable, and is further enlarged by > . For instance, even with 2% nominal growth\non capital income and 0.5% nominal growth on non-capital income, the relative change\nof RE between the two systems amounts to 6.2%, which is larger than 6.1%, a\ncounterparting measure when capital income grows at a slower rate of 1% and non-\ncapital income grows at the same rate of 0.5%. For a highly skewed distribution, this\nmagnitude is rather significant. As a benchmark, when = , the largest RE relative\nchange between various other inflation scenarios and the 1% scenario occurs when\ninflation hits 90%, which is just 2.9% in absolute terms.\nAs capital income grows faster, under the current dual tax system redistribution of the\nIT and SIC system always seems to be weakened. The most straightforward evidence is\nthat relative changes of RE/G_pre from the comparison scenario are always negative for\nall the inflation rates under the dual tax system. Again, the size of these effects is\nsignificant. The other supporting sign is that the peak of RE/G_pre or RE developments\narrives at much lower inflation rates when > . In particular, when capital income\ngrows at twice the inflation rate and non-capital income grows at half the inflation rate,\nRE/G_pre or RE are always monotonically decreasing with a higher inflation rate.\nIn keeping with the previous evidence that the crossing marginal contribution of >\non the introduction of the dual tax system is negative to redistribution, relative changes\nof RE/G_pre from the comparison scenario mostly become much closer to zero as we\nswitch from the dual tax system to the comprehensive one. This contribution can even\noffset the deterioration of RE by bracket creep as some relative changes of RE/G_pre\nare positive. The other indication about the positive effect of recovering a\ncomprehensive tax system is that the peak of RE/G_pre or RE developments arrives at\nmuch larger inflation rates under the comprehensive tax system for all three\ncombinations of and .\nTable 9 Redistributive effect (RE) of the IT and SIC system under the bracket\ncreep scenarios when r>g and r and g are heterogeneous\nRE\nPercentage change of RE w.r.t. the\nbenchmark\nInflation rate %\nScenarios Scenarios\nNotes: RE represents the redistributive effect.

The highest value per row is in bold\nand italics.\nSource: Tax micro-simulation model using PHF data.\nNext, we turn to the results simulated from the heterogeneous and group of\nscenarios. Table 9 presents the redistributive effects of the IT and SIC system under\nthree scenarios when and can be heterogeneous. Again, we observe from the left\npanel the inverted U-shaped development of RE with respect to inflation for the s1 and\ns2 scenarios. But the maximum is reached at a lower inflation rate of 10% compared\nwith the benchmark bracket creep scenario when = (see Table 5). RE starts to decline\neven from the very low inflation for s3. More surprisingly, all scenarios introduce a\ngreater disequalising effects as, in the right panel, the percentage change of RE with\nrespect to the benchmark scenario is always negative, even for the pro-poor biased\nscenario s3. Contrary to our prediction, this fall is most significant in s3, followed by s1\nand then s2. The difference is fairly sizeable in s3 as, for instance, a fall in 2.48% of RE\ncompared with the benchmark can arise at 4% of inflation.\nThe other influential channel which distorts the redistributive effect we ignored is the\ncrowding-out of non-capital income by capital income. Triggered by the inflation\ncompensation and > restrictions, is smaller than 1 + , so that all the households\nhave less nominal non-capital income after inflation compensation than the benchmark\nscenario. Under our maximum capital income bargaining restriction, this reduction is\nlarger for those with a higher (the rich) than for those with a lower one (the poor). As\ndemonstrated by Figure 5, every point is horizontally farther away from 1 + as the\nhouseholds move towards the point Z, with rising, over any of these three scenario\npaths. Consequently, the rich can shift more income from non-capital to capital\ncomponents in relative terms (with respect to non-capital income), and also in absolute\nterm, since they usually have more non-capital income than the poor. Due to the\nprogressivity on the tax for non-capital income as we explained before, the top of the\ndistribution should enjoy more tax relief relative to their tax base than the bottom part.53\nTaking scenario s3 as an example, Table 10 displays the relative decline of non-capital\ntaxable income compared with the benchmark scenario at the same inflation rates. This\ndrop prevails over the whole distribution and grows as inflation rises. As expected, as\nincome deciles move downwards, this shrinkage of the non-capital income base\ndepreciates monotonically.54\nFurthermore, as the scenario becomes less pro-poor biased, this crowding-out effect\ndeclines for all. Figure 5 shows that each point on the scenario paths, defined by the\ninflation compensation restriction given the same , moves closer to 1 + when the\nscenario shifts from s3 to s1, and then s2, or the path becomes flatter. As we can see\nfrom Figure 5, when the scenario path spirals downwards, this increase in non-capital\nincome is stronger for the rich than for the poor in both relative and absolute terms.\nTable 11 and Table 12 provide such evidence regarding the relative change of non-\ncapital taxable income from s3 and s1, and from s1 to s2 respectively. These changes\nare all positive across the distribution, and they are almost always positively related\nwith the income level.55 Tax progressivity further reinforces such an uneven rise of non-\ncapital income so that the ranking of RE drops in s3, s1 and s2 from high to low.\n53 This statement might not be accurate enough if there is a non-negligible part of the top distribution with\na share of non-capital income that is much smaller than the share of capital income. However, this\nsituation is rather unlikely in Germany.\n54 The same pattern occurs for the other two scenarios, although evidence for this is not shown in order to\nsave space.\n55 The exception occurs in the first decile of Table 12, and is most likely caused by non-monotonicity, at\nthe bottom of income distribution, of the procedure for deriving the taxable income from gross income in\nthe German tax system (ie the impacts from tax deductions, social insurance contributions...).\nTable 11 Percentage change of non-capital taxable income between the bracket\ncreep scenarios s1 and s3 when r>g and r and g are heterogeneous\nTable 12 Percentage change of non-capital taxable income between the bracket\ncreep scenarios s2 and s1 when r>g and r and g are heterogeneous\nInflation rate\n%\nDeciles\nNotes: Decile groupings are determined by the distribution of the equivalised household disposable\nincome (EHDI) in the regime without indexation.

The effect of bracket creep is more\npronounced among taxpayers in Germany due to the continuously increasing marginal\nrates. On the other hand, the government can also lose real revenue on particular taxes\nsuch as excise tax due to inflation erosion. Therefore, these aspects have triggered many\ndebates to address this issue.\nOur study provides an answer by investigating both the redistributive and revenue effect\nof bracket creep. In our analysis, we use a tax micro-simulation model developed for the\n2009 income distribution from the newly available PHF data.58 By simulating under a\nmore complete list of inflation rates than Immervoll (2005), we produce an inverted U-\nshaped overall redistributive effect from the IT and SIC system when inflation grows.\nThe reduction of tax progressivity and growing average tax burdens are still consistent\nwith the findings by Immervoll (2005). Furthermore, bracket creep purely through the\ntax schedule is strikingly overall regressive since the possibility of switching the capital\nincome into and out of the income tax base, as nominal income grows, benefits the\nupper middle part of distribution more than the lower middle part. The recent empirical\ninvestigation shows that the rise in market income inequality is associated with a lower\naverage tax level and higher tax progressivity. Therefore, it is worth examining whether\nthe current widening income inequality among many countries might have caused them\nto enter a new regime \u00ad the initial average tax level is too low (or tax progressivity as\nthe offsetting force is high enough) so that the development of the redistribution effect\nis no longer dominated by the upward movement of the average tax level induced by\nmajor OECD countries in the mid-1970s, but they fell to about 40% on average by the late 2000s. Verbist\n58 Most of the results should still be valid in 2014 (Hechtner et al, 2012; Figure 8 in this paper depicts the\nempirical residual elasticity for deciles and p99 of income distribution shifts little). Fundamentally, there\nhave been no major changes in income tax and social insurance since 2009.\nbracket creep. In this sense, our simulation with the German data can hopefully\ncontribute to this examination.\ndistribution at both ends at a faster pace. Meanwhile, the tax rate and progression of the\ntax schedule declined significantly at the middle and top of the distribution. These\nfactors contributed to a diminishing of the redistributive effect in the IT and SIC system\nwhen inflation introduces nominal income growth, since a large mass of taxpayers were\npushed to a relatively less progressive tax zone in 2009 compared with 1998. This\nfinding implies that frequent monitoring of the redistributive effect in bracket creep is\nnecessary because it provides the timely evaluation of the progressivity aspect of tax\nreform.\nAssuming the current development of income distribution and tax progression persists,\nwe claim that delaying indexation might not always enhance the equalising effect of the\nIT and SIC system. Our results suggest that a decision to act against bracket creep\nshould take this development into account.\nThe other part of simulations incorporates the contemporaneous evidence > such\nthat the nominal growth needed to compensate inflation is stronger in capital income\nthan in non-capital income. We divide the scenarios by allowing the heterogeneity in\nand or not. When and are homogeneous within the population, our simulation\nshows that a restoration of the comprehensive tax system always significantly reduces\nthe inequality of disposable income under all kinds of simulated inflation scenarios. For\ninstance, even with 2% nominal growth on capital income and 0.5% nominal growth on\nnon-capital income, relative change of RE between the current dual tax system and the\ncounterfactual comprehensive tax system amounts to 6.2%. With higher nominal\ngrowth on capital income than non-capital income, this effect is even intensified. With a\nshift to the comprehensive tax system and faster growth in capital income, the RE-\nenhancing path can be prolonged until a peak which is much further above the initial 20%\nin the equal growth scenario under the dual tax system. Under the current dual tax\nsystem, faster growth in capital income exasperates the redistribution dynamics as\ninflation picks up. The redistributive effect can, with rising inflation, start to enter the\ndropping path with inflation much lower than 20%.\nAlthough the scenarios simulated with heterogeneity in and are not exhaustive, the\nredistributive effect of the IT and SIC system under bracket creep deteriorates for all the\nscenarios simulated under a few plausible assumptions regarding the inflation\ncompensation process under > . Crowding-out the non-capital income to a greater\nextent at the top of distribution becomes the dominating mechanism to explain the\nincreasing disequalising effect.\nWe would suggest pursuing this direction of research further in the future. Capital\nincome and wealth data can be enriched by the approaches in Bartels and Jenderny\n(2014) as well as Saez and Zucman (2014). We can explore the extent to which our\nresults can hold good if we revise some of our assumptions and extend beyond the\ncontext of inflation compensation. Many critical questions regarding the design of\ncapital income taxation remain to be answered, particularly if asset price booms are\nfuelled by the extensively expansionary monetary policy around the world.\nWe also acknowledge that caveats exist in our data and simulation. The very top of the\nincome distribution might not be precisely represented, although our reweighting\npartially resolves the problem in terms of tax revenue. The actual tax and contributions\nto which households are subject may depend on several factors (eg exemptions) and\nrules we do not fully account for. However, using a new data set which oversamples\nhouseholds at the top of income distribution, our study can provide valuable insights\ninto the redistributive effects in different parts of the distribution.\nAppendix A German system of tax and social security\ncontributions\nThe German income tax schedule includes a basic allowance, the directly progressive\nand the marginally flat tax brackets. Nominal taxable incomes above the basic\nallowance are subject to a marginal tax rate increasing linearly with income until a\nthreshold is hit. Incomes exceeding this threshold are taxed by the constant marginal tax\nrates.59 Married couples can enjoy the marriage tax benefit mainly through a splitting\nrule for spouses (joint taxation of couples) such that the joint tax liability is twice the\ntax liability derived from the point of the tax function where taxable income is half of\nthe couple's income. Due to tax progressivity, almost all couples can reduce the total\ntax liability by filing tax jointly.\nFurthermore, since 2009, capital incomes of private households have been \u00ad in the\nnormal case \u00ad subject to a flat tax rate of 25% for the part above a saver's allowance.\nThey are treated as a withholding tax separate from the above-mentioned income tax.\nHowever, tax payers can instead include the capital incomes in the income tax base if\nfiling jointly is more favourable. This can be done when they file their annual tax return.\nThe authorities then perform a yield test to determine whether withheld tax is to be\nrefunded. Initially designed for funding German re-unification, a surcharge of 5.5% on\nboth income and capital income tax burdens (as well as on the corporate tax burden for\ncorporations) is additionally levied. Members of the catholic and protestant churches\n(and some smaller churches) are supposed to pay a church tax, with income and capital\nincome tax burdens as the tax base. There is a flat rate of 8% or 9% on this tax base,\ndepending on the federal state.\nWage tax and withholding taxes on interest and dividends have to be paid upfront.\nThen, by filing a tax return every year, the discrepancies between up-front and final tax\nliability are resolved. However, the obligation to file tax is binding only for the self-\nemployed and anyone with multiple income sources, but only in particular cases for\nwage earners. It is much more favourable for high income earners to file tax because\nthey can claim itemised deductions as well as other allowances to save tax; this\npossibility is only available when filing a tax return. Consequently, low income earners\nare more likely to be underrepresented in the income tax statistics covering only the tax\nfiler population.\n59 There was only one marginal flat tax bracket before 2007. The rich tax (Reichensteuer) was introduced\nin 2007 with the other bracket bearing a higher flat marginal tax rate at the top of the distribution. In\nMany Germans are subject to statutory social insurance contributions. Theese include\npension insurance, health insurance, long-term care insurance, statutory unemployment\ninsurance, and accident insurance. Employees and employers are obliged to pay\nstatutory social insurance contributions. These levies are progressive for the lower part\nof the income distribution because there are limits below which contributions on\nearnings are waived. For earners with gross income above the limits, contributions are\nproportional to nominal gross income up to a ceiling. Gross income above this ceiling is\ndisregarded. Income ceilings are adjusted roughly according to wage growth.\nCivil servants and the self-employed are not obligated to pay compulsory social\ninsurance contributions. Many opt out of such insurance and choose to be covered by\nthe private system, eg private health insurance. Pensioners only have to contribute to\nhealth insurance and long-term care insurance.\nAppendix B Gross-net tax conversion\nThe raw income data in the PHF contains either gross (brutto) or net (netto) values.\nWhile the survey asked for gross figures to be provided wherever possible, some of the\nincome questions in the questionnaire gave the option of providing net figures.\nInterviewers recorded this distinction in one two-level categorical BR variable. In order\nto perform a consistent analysis, we converted all the reported figures so that they are all\non the annual gross base.\nThe conversion carries a few assumptions. The main one is that the respondent reports\nthe upfront net income figure which is the gross figure minus the source tax (usually\nwage tax / Lohnsteuer) and default social insurance contributions. This is usually what\nthe employee respondent can gather from his/her payslip which conforms to the\ninformation-retrieving process they should follow. We also assume the same context for\npension and self-employment incomes as the setting is similar for these incomes.\nThe second important assumption is that spouses choose the tax class\n(Lohnsteuerklasse) which ensures that the aggregate upfront net employment income\nfor both is highest among all the alternative combinations: III/V, IV/IV or V/III. One\ncomplication in German upfront taxation is the choice of tax class by married partners.\nIn almost all cases, couples have to decide between two arrangements: first, that one\nspouse receives the full marriage benefits (class III) while the other receives none (class\nV), and, second, that each shares the marriage benefits (IV for both). However, the\nchoice of tax class is not asked for in the questionnaire. Therefore, we have to carry out\nan optimisation which is equivalent to a rationality assumption. We ignore the\npossibility of choosing tax class VI, which applies to income from second and\nsubsequent employment.60 We apply tax class I to all single persons with tax liability\nwho are not single mothers. Tax class VI is assigned to the latter. Tax class I defines the\nlowest tax deductions and those with class VI can enjoy some additional tax benefits.\nThe gross to net calculator is specified by strictly following the protocol published by\nthe Federal Ministry of Finance as well as the rules regarding social insurance\ncontributions.61 Note that capital income is always treated separately with regard to the\nflat rate withholding tax (Abgeltungssteuer).\n60 Everyone is asked to report employment income as one figure which we cannot separate among\nmultiple jobs, if any.\n61 See PAP 2009 (Ge\u00e4nderter Programmablaufplan f\u00fcr die maschinelle Berechnung der vom Arbeitslohn\neinzubehaltenden Lohnsteuer, des Solidarit\u00e4tszuschlags und der Ma\u00dfstabsteuer f\u00fcr die Kirchenlohnsteuer\nWe then discuss the structure of the tax conversion. The conversion is composed of\nthree major steps.\nFirst, all of the reported income variables are converted one by one to the gross figures\nunder all the eligible tax classes the respondents can take if the BR indicators show they\nwere the net figures. This is achieved by a non-linear solver based on the gross to net\ntax calculator. The tax class is one input parameter that this tax calculator uses.\nNext, for all spouses who are eligible for classes III/IV/V we calculate the alternative\naggregate net figures under tax class IV using the version of the gross figures under\nclasses III and V. Using the total net figures across all the income components reported\nby both partners, a yield test algorithm determines the optimal tax class.\nFinally, we assign the gross figure to each variable which is associated with the optimal\ntax class as produced in the first step.\nThe bonus income (dpg0210) should be entered into the tax base together with the\nemployment income to determine the joint marginal tax rate as stipulated by the\nGerman Tax Code. Our conversion also takes this complex matter into consideration.\nhttp://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Downloads/Steuern/Steuerarten/Lohnsteuer/Progra\nAppendix C Absolute real loss of household net\nincomes owing to bracket creep\nTable 13: Absolute real loss of household net incomes owing to bracket creep\nunder different inflation scenarios\nInfla\ntion\nrate\n%\nDeciles\nNotes: Decile groupings are determined by the distribution of the equivalised household disposable\nincome (EHDI) in the regime without indexation.

In the end, and for each household can be denoted by the\nobservables , , as well as the hypothetical . We use and to represent\nthe solution in the scenario ( = 1, 2 or 3) and and to denote the coordinate for\npoint . The following derivation refers to the geographical representation in Figure 5.\nThe basic process is to deduct the algebraic expression of each scenario path (ie ZM,\nZQ and ZP lines), and they are solved jointly with the inflation compensation\nrestriction ( , ; ) = + - (1 + )(1 + ) = 0.\ns1: r/g shares a constant equal to the r value in point Z, since g value in point Z is one.\nLetting g = 1 in F(r, g; k) = 0, we solve the g to have this slope. The multiplication of\nthis slope and g is then inserted into r in F(r, g; k) = 0 in order to solve g and then r .\nThe results are\ns2: and are first obtained by inserting the multiplication of the slop solved above\nand g into r in F(r, g; ) = 0. and are both 1 + . We then solve the Q as the\nmidpoint of line MC. With the coordinates of both Z and Q, we derive the expression of\nline ZQ and finally to achieve\ns3: With = 1, we solve by insert 1 into in F(r, g; ) = 0. P is the midpoint\nof line RM.
