Mahaffey,1 Robert P. Clickner,2 and Rebecca A. Jeffries2\n1Office of Science Coordination and Policy, Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances, U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency, Washington, DC, USA; 2Westat, Rockville, Maryland, USA\nBackground: The current, continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) has included blood mercury (BHg) and fish/shellfish consumption since it began in\nObjectives: This study was designed to determine BHg distributions within U.S. Census regions\nand within coastal and noncoastal areas among women of childbearing age, their association with\nMethods: We performed univariate and bivariate analyses to determine the distribution of BHg\nand fish consumption in the population and to investigate differences by geography, race/ethnicity,\nand income. We used multivariate analysis (regression) to determine the strongest predictors of\nBHg among geography, demographic factors, and fish consumption.\nResults: Elevated BHg occurred more commonly among women of childbearing age living in\ncoastal areas of the United States (approximately one in six women). Regionally, exposures differ\nacross the United States: Northeast > South and West > Midwest. Asian women and women with\nhigher income ate more fish and had higher BHg. Time-trend analyses identified reduced BHg and\nreduced intake of Hg in the upper percentiles without an overall reduction of fish consumption.\nConclusions: BHg is associated with income, ethnicity, residence (census region and coastal\n\nproximity). From 1999 through 2004, BHg decreased without a concomitant decrease in fish con-\nsumption. Data are consistent with a shift over this time period in fish species in women's diets.\nKey words: blood, coastal, fish, mercury, NHANES, regional.

Unbiased population estimates\ncannot be made for other U.S. geographic\nsubdivisions, such as coastal and noncoastal\nregions, because weights have not been devel-\noped for them; however, distributional esti-\nmates can be made.\nExplaining patterns of MeHg exposure\nis challenging because MeHg concentrations\nwithin and among fish species are known to\nNRC 2006). Regional distributions of BHg\nand Hg exposure estimated from the patterns\nof fish consumption (i.e., Northeast, Midwest,\nSouth, and West, as well as overall coastal\u00ad\nnoncoastal differences) remain \nquestions.\nThe purposes of the present study of Hg\nexposures are to provide for the first time sep-\narate estimates of BHg distribution and fish\nconsumption for the individual U.S. Census\nregions and for coastal and noncoastal popu-\nlations. Such data are useful in determining\nwhere to focus efforts to reduce Hg exposure.\nThe present analysis can be used to determine\na) distributions of BHg concentrations and\nfish consumption that differ across the four\nU.S. Census regions and between the coastal\nand noncoastal populations, b) significant\ntemporal trends in BHg levels and fish con-\nc) BHg concentrations associated with racial/\nethnic and income level. Trends in patterns\nof fish consumption, if present, could be used\nto assess the impact of national fish adviso-\nries and Hg reduction programs. Data on\ngeographic/ethnic groups and socioeconomic\nassociations could be used to target interven-\ntion programs. The regional results can be\ngeneralized to provide population estimates\nfor the U.S. Census regions.\nMaterials and Methods\nMethodology for data analysis. We evalu-\nated data for examinees who participated in\nto assess the statistical association between\nseafood consumption and BHg by region of\nresidence, race/ethnicity, and annual income.\nFurther, we examined time trends for both\nBHg and fish consumption. NHANES is an\nannual survey conducted by the NCHS. The\ndata include BHg levels, 24-hr dietary recall,\nand 30-day finfish and shellfish consumption\nfrequency for women 16\u00ad49 years of age who\nreside in the United States. The NHANES\nsampling frame includes all 50 states. The\ndocumentation and publicly available data\nfor NHANES can be found online [Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n2006b]. The regional data are not publicly\navailable but can be accessed by special request\nto the National Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS) through its   Data Center.\nProcedures for submitting a proposal in order\nto access data that are not publicly available\ncan be found online (CDC 2006c). We per-\nformed all analyses using SAS, version 9.1\n(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).\nFollowing NHANES analytic guide-\nlines (CDC 2006a), we used SAS procedures\nthat accurately incorporate the stratification\nand multistage sampling of NHANES: Proc\nSurveyMeans, Proc SurveyReg, and Proc\nSurveyFreq (SAS Institute Inc.). The weights\nprovided by NCHS compensate for the\n\noversampling of various subpopulations and\nadjust for nonresponse bias. We used weights\nfor estimating statistics for coastal and non-\ncoastal regions to retain these adjustments.\nBecause we considered the variables of interest\n(BHg and fish consumption) to be related to\nsome of the factors that were oversampled, we\nretained these adjustments to minimize the bias\nin the estimates. For example, NHANES over-\nsampled Mexican Americans, who also have\nlower BHg than do other racial/ethnic groups.\nIf the weights were not used to estimate the dis-\ntribution of BHg, the results would be biased\nlow. We recognize that some bias may remain\nwithin the estimates because the weights were\nnot specifically created for the geographic\nregions of coastal and noncoastal; however,\nthese subdivisions (e.g., coastal, noncoastal,\nPacific, Atlantic) are based on counties, the\nprimary sampling units of NHANES (CDC\n2006a). All multivariate analyses were done\nunweighted because factors associated with\nthe dependent variables and for which over\nsampling was based were included as co\nvariates\nand thus adjusted for in the modeling.\nIn order to estimate long-term Hg intake,\nwe combined data collected through the 24-hr\ndietary recall and the 30-day fish frequency\nquestionnaire to estimate 30-day Hg intake\n[for specific methodologies, see Mahaffey\nwe found statistically significant differences\nin amount of fish consumed per meal from\nthe 24-hr dietary recall by either coastal sta-\ntus (participants who lived in a county that\nbordered the Pacific or Atlantic Oceans, the\nGulf of Mexico, or the Great Lakes vs. those\nseparate averages. We generated statistically\nrepresentative estimates from these data using\nthe statistical weights provided by NCHS and\nfollowing the relevant analytical guidelines\nMethodology for defining coastal and non\ncoastal areas. Fish consumption is generally\nbelieved to be a major contributor to BHg\nconcentration. We hypothesized that patterns\nof fish and shellfish consumption would vary\nbetween U.S. residents who live on or near the\ncoast (within ~25\u00ad50 miles) and those who\nlive inland. We further hypothesized that fish\nconsumption patterns, and thus BHg con-\ncentrations, may also vary by specific coast\n(e.g., residents near the Atlantic Coast may\nhave different BHg concentrations than those\non the coast of the Gulf of Mexico) and spe-\ncific inland region (e.g., West vs. Midwest).\nTo test these hypotheses, we categorized\nNHANES respondents as living in either a\ncoastal or a noncoastal county and further cat-\negorized them by eight regions: Atlantic Coast,\nNortheast, Great Lakes, Midwest, South, Gulf\nof Mexico, West, and Pacific Coast.\nTable 1.

We\ndefined all counties that bordered the Pacific or\nAtlantic Oceans, the Gulf of Mexico, or any\nof the Great Lakes as coastal. Additionally, we\ndefined counties that bordered estuaries and\nbays as coastal, as well as counties whose cen-\nter point was within approximately 25 miles\nof any coast even if not directly bordering a\ncoast. [For the list of counties, see Supplemental\nMaterial, Table 13 (http://www.ehponline.\norg/\nthen defined the four coastal regions based on\nnearest body of water; for example, counties in\nCalifornia, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, and\nHawaii that we defined as coastal were catego-\nrized as Pacific Coast. We separated noncoastal\ncounties into four inland regions using the U.S.\nCensus regions; for example, noncoastal coun-\nties in California, Oregon, Washington, and\nAlaska along with the entire states of Idaho,\nMontana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,\nArizona, Utah, and Nevada became the West\nregion (we classified all of Hawaii as coastal).\nWe also designated the entire state of Florida as\ncoastal, split between the Atlantic Coast and the\nGulf of Mexico. We designated Miami-Dade\nCounty as Atlantic Coast, and Monroe County\nas Gulf of Mexico. These subdivisions run the\nrisk of small sample sizes; however, the defini-\ntion of coastal was sufficiently broad to avoid\nsingle primary sampling units.\nResults\nTable 1 shows the distributions of estimates\nof the number of women with BHg con-\ncentrations > 3.5 \u00b5g/L and > 5.8 \u00b5g/L, by\nregion.

Individual\nMahaffey et al.\nstates with higher Hg exposures [e.g., Hawaii\n(Sato et al., 2006), Florida (Karouna-Renier\net al. 2008)] and greater fish consumption\n[Florida (Denger et al. 1994)] have substan-\ntially broader fish consumption advisories\n(e.g., Hawaii and Florida) aimed at reducing\nHg exposure from high-Hg\u00adcontaining spe-\ncies obtained locally (Florida Department\nthe federal advisory's emphasis on four spe-\ncies of highly contaminated fish (U.S. EPA\n2008b) and the states' emphasis on game-\nfish, the most commonly consumed finfish\nin the United States is tuna. Interpretation\nof Hg exposure from tuna was complicated\nby the specific wording of the dietary ques-\ntions asked of the NHANES examinees,\nwhich did not differentiate between light or\nskipjack tuna and albacore tuna. The latter\ncontains approximately three times more Hg\nthan does the former: 0.38 \u00b5g/g for frozen\nand fresh tuna, 0.35 \u00b5g/g for canned alba-\ncore, and 0.12 \u00b5g/g for canned light tuna\nChanges in MeHg exposure over time.\nDuring the past decade, the U.S. EPA initi-\nated substantial interventions aimed to reduce\nHg releases and exposures (U.S. EPA 2008a)\nand issued advisories to limit consumption\nof high-Hg fish (U.S. EPA 2008b). Because\nof worldwide atmospheric distribution and\nsubsequent deposition of Hg, local condi-\ntions and locally caught fish are not the main\ncontributors to Hg intake for most people\n(Sunderland 2007). Although there are eco-\nnomic indications that consumption of some\nspecies of fish may have decreased in response\nto these advisories (Shimshack et al. 2007),\nHg exposures may not follow a similar time\ntrend despite regulatory efforts to reduce Hg\nexposures. A recent analysis of a nationally\nrepresentative study specifically addressing\nfish-consumption patterns did not support\nthis suggestion (Bradbury 2007). Our analy-\nsis of NHANES data calculating 30-day Hg\nintake indicated that there was no consis-\ntent trend in fish consumption by women\nof childbearing age over the 6-year period\nConclusions\nSignificant geographic differences in BHg\nconcentrations occurred within the United\nStates: We found highest exposures in coastal\nareas and the Northeast census region. In the\nNortheast, 19% of women had BHg con-\ncentrations  3.5 \u00b5g/L. The highest 5% of\nBHg concentrations exceeded 8.2 \u00b5g/L in\nthe Northeast and 7.2 \u00b5g/L in coastal areas,\nconcentrations more than twice the 3.5 \u00b5g/L\nlevel of concern. BHg levels were predicted\nby the quantity and type of fish consumed.\nfrequency of elevated BHg levels among\nwomen of childbearing age declined without\na significant change in quantities of fish and\nshellfish consumed. This pattern suggests a\nmore discerning series of choices in type of\nfish eaten rather than an overall reduction\nin fish consumption. Within all geographic\nregions, women at highest risk of elevated Hg\nexposures were more affluent and more likely\nto be of Asian or island ethnicity.\nReferences\nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease  . 1999.\nATSDR Announces Updated Toxicological Profile for\nMercury.
