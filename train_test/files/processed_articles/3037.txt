A graded increase in the prevalence ratio (PR) was observed with\nincreasing severity of overweight and obesity for all of the health outcomes except for\ncoronary heart disease in men and high blood cholesterol level in both men and women.\nWith normal-weight individuals as the reference, for individuals with BMIs of at least\n40 kg/m2 and who were younger than 55 years, PRs were highest for type 2 diabetes\nwomen (PR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.9-8.9). Prevalence ratios generally were greater in younger\nthan in older adults. The prevalence of having 2 or more health conditions increased\nwith weight status category across all racial and ethnic subgroups.\nConclusions Based on these results, more than half of all US adults are considered over-\nweight or obese.

To\nimprove the reliability of estimates for\nnon-HispanicblacksandMexicanAmeri-\ncansaswellasyoungchildrenandtheel-\nderly, NHANES III oversampled these\ngroups. Further details of the design\nandoperationofthesurveyareavailable\n  Criteria\nThe survey protocol included a home\ninterview and a standardized physical\nexamination in a mobile examination\ncenter or a limited examination in the\nsubject's home for subjects unable to\ntravel. In both settings, body weight and\nheight were measured by trained tech-\nnicians with standardized equipment\nand procedures.\nWe used the National Heart, Lung,\nand Blood Institute's definitions for the\ncutoff points between overweight and\nobesity and between obese and its class\nlevels.11 Using a reference category of\nmal weight), the 4 classes as shown in\nTABLE 1, which also lists the World\nHealth Organization's cutoff points.1\nBoth organizations use the same catego-\nries with the exception of the BMI range\ncalls it preobese and the National Heart,\nLung, and Blood Institute calls it over-\nweight. Both organizations consider per-\nsons with a BMI of between 25.0 and\nyears old, we excluded pregnant wo-\nmen (n = 164) and persons who did not\nhave height or weight measurements\nHealth Outcomes\nOn the basis of previous research, we\nselected for study health conditions for\nwhich excess weight is an established\nrisk factor and for which sample sizes\nwere adequate. These conditions in-\ncluded high blood pressure, type 2 DM,\nhigh blood cholesterol level, coronary\nheart disease (CHD), and gallbladder\ndisease. In addition, for analyses that\nconsidered the number of comorbidi-\nties, osteoarthritis was included.\nHighbloodpressurewasdeemedpres-\nent if subjects reported that a physi-\ncian had ever told them that they had\nhypertension or high blood pressure,\nor if the mean of at least 3 blood pres-\nsure readings (measured by NHANES\ntechnicians) exceeded 140 mm Hg sys-\ntolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic. The spe-\ncific details of the blood pressure mea-\nsurements are published elsewhere.20\nThe average of all available blood pres-\nsure measurements was used.\nIdeally, type 2 DM should be de-\nfined based on self-report of physician\ndiagnosis and fasting plasma glucose\nlevels. However, fasting plasma glu-\ncose levels were unavailable for 44% of\nthe sample. Therefore, type 2 DM was\ndefined only by self-report of diag-\nnosed disease. Because the structured\ninterview item for physician-diag-\nnosed DM did not distinguish type 1\nfrom type 2 DM, we identified sub-\njects with type 2 DM on the basis of the\ninformation provided in the question-\nnaire. We started with all those who re-\nsponded affirmatively to the question:\n\"Has a physician ever told you have dia-\nbetes?\" We then excluded those who\nreported having DM only during preg-\nnancy. Of those who remained, we ex-\ncluded those with type 1 DM (diagno-\nsis before age 30 years and number of\nyears of insulin use equal to within 1\nyear of duration of disease). Those who\nremained were considered to have type\n2 DM. This approach may misclassify\na small number of persons with type 2\nDM as having type 1 DM, and an even\nsmaller number of persons with late-\nonset type 1 DM as having type 2 DM.\nSubjects were classified as having\nhigh blood cholesterol levels if they\nreported that a physician had told them\nsuch or if measured serum cholesterol\nmg/dL). Levels were determined by\ncontract laboratories using reference\nanalytical methods.21\nA diagnosis of CHD was based on a\nhistory of having had a \"heart attack,\"\ncongestive heart failure, or angina.\nHeart attack and congestive heart fail-\nure were based on self-report of phy-\nsician diagnosis. The location of chest\npain as described by self-report was\nused for classification of angina based\non established criteria.22\nGallbladder disease or osteoarthritis\nwereconsideredpresentforsubjectswho\nhadeverbeentoldbytheirphysicianthat\nthey had either condition.\nData Analysis\nAll analyses were conducted using\nspecializedsoftwarethatadjustsforcom-\nplex sample designs.23 Sample weights\nwere applied to produce nationally\nrepresentative estimates.

The crude prevalence estimates\nshowed a generally similar magnitude\nand pattern across racial and ethnic\ngroups by sex with 2 exceptions: among\nnon-Hispanic white women the preva-\nlence of BMI of 25 kg/m2 or higher\n(overweight or obesity) was lower and\namong Mexican American men preva-\nlence was higher compared with other\nracial or ethnic sex groups.\nForbothmenandwomen,highblood\npressure was the most common over-\nweight- and obesity-related health con-\ndition and its prevalence showed a\nstrong increase with increasing weight\nstatus category (TABLE 3). The preva-\nlence of type 2 DM, gallbladder dis-\nease,andosteoarthritisincreasedsharply\namong both overweight and obese men\nand women corresponding with the in-\ncreasing weight classes. High blood cho-\nlesterol level was very prevalent in both\nsexes but showed no increase in preva-\nlence with increasing weight category.\nHowever, men and women with BMIs\nof 25 kg/m2 or more, were more likely\nthan persons of normal weight to have\nhigh blood cholesterol levels. Because\nthese estimates are not adjusted for age\nor smoking status, they reflect the pres-\nence of these health conditions in the US\npopulation.\nSex-specific PRs by weight class for\nthehealthconditionsconsideredshowed\nno evidence of race and ethnicity\u00ad\nweight class interactions for either sex.\n(Racial-andethnic-specificPRsareavail-\nable from A.M.)

This finding is strik-\ning given that individuals with the mild-\nest degree of overweight comprise more\nthe United States. For the majority of\nhealthconditionsstudied,basedonover-\nweight status and age, PRs are in-\ncreased.

We observed that the cross-\nsectional relationship of obesity class\nto the comorbidities studied was gen-\nerally strongest among the younger age\ngroups. Nonetheless, the PRs were sig-\nnificantly elevated in the older age\ngroup except for gallbladder disease\nin men and high cholesterol level in\nboth sexes.\nOur analysis of multiple comorbidi-\nties did not include CHD, because of\nthe potential for \"double-counting\" of\nCHD with known cardiovascular risk\nfactors such as hypertension, type 2\nDM, and high blood cholesterol level.\nOur consideration of only the most\ncommon obesity-related comorbidi-\nties and avoidance of double counting\nsuggests that we have likely underes-\ntimated the disease burden associated\nwith overweight in the population. The\nburden to the individual is increased for\nthose with more severe obesity be-\ncause they are more likely to develop\na second or even a third morbidity.\nOur approach has several limita-\ntions. Foremost, a cross-sectional ap-\nproach to evaluate the relationship of\nobesity to the morbidities that we ex-\namined does not provide evidence for\ncausality. In some individuals, weight\nloss may accompany some of these\nconditions, particularly CHD. Because\npersons in the higher obesity classes\nwere at increased risk of death, we may\nhave underestimated the impact of\nweight on adverse health, particularly\namong older individuals. Reliance on\nself-report of physician-diagnosed dis-\nease underestimates disease burden.\nFor example, a definition based on self-\nreport of diagnosed disease underesti-\nmates DM prevalence by more than\noverweight and chronic health condi-\ntions increases the likelihood of diag-\nnosis in heavier people and represents\nan additional source of bias. In addi-\ntion, using BMI as a weight measure\nprovides an indirect measure of fatness\nand does not reflect fat distribution,\nwhich may affect the risk of comorbid-\nity independent of BMI. Moreover, BMI\ndoes not distinguish between fat mass\nand lean tissue mass and may underes-\ntimate fatness in older adults who have\ngreater amount of body fat at a given\nBMI than younger ones, due to age-re-\nlated declines in muscle mass.39 Fur-\nthermore, we did not adjust our cross-\nsectional statistical models for variables\noften included in models that estimate\nFigure.

Our\nresults might have changed if these\nvariables had been included. However,\nthe consistency of our cross-sectional\nfindings with incident chronic disease\nin several large prospective studies26-29\nsuggests that the cross-sectional asso-\nciations we observed are likely to re-\nflect true associations. The aforemen-\ntioned misclassification and biases\nwould likely have a minor impact on\nthe magnitude of these estimates.\nInconclusion,thesenationaldatasug-\ngest that clinicians are likely to encoun-\nter morbidity more frequently among\ntheir patients with elevated BMI, even\nthose patients in the overweight cat-\negory. A general pattern of increasing\nprevalence with increasing severity of\noverweight and obesity is consistent\nacross racial and ethnic groups for all of\nthe health conditions considered, with\nthe exception of high blood cholesterol\nlevel. Without concerted initiatives to\nprevent and treat overweight in adults,\nthe health care system will increasingly\nbe overwhelmed with individuals who\nrequire treatment for obesity-related\nhealth conditions.\nFunding/Support: This work was supported by Roche\nLaboratories, Inc, Nutley, NJ.\nPrevious Presentation: Presented in part at the An-\nnual Conference of the North American Association\nfor the Study of Obesity, Cancun, Mexico, Novem-\nREFERENCES\n1.
