    "abstract": "Abstract\nObjective: To determine the quantity and quality of articles in the field of knee arthroplasty\nworldwide and elucidate the characteristics of global scientific production.\nMethods: Web of Science was used to identify articles in the field of knee arthroplasty from 2011\nto 2015. The total number of papers, number of papers per capita, total number of citations, and\nmean number of citations were collected.\nResults: In total, 11,590 papers were identified. The number of publications significantly increased\nfrom 2011 to 2015. Most originated from North America, East Asia, and West Europe. Most\n(88.51%) were from high-income countries, 11.48% were from middle-income countries, and only\n0.01% were from lower-income countries. The United States had the most articles and total\ncitations. Sweden had the highest mean citations, followed by Denmark and Canada. However,\nwhen adjusted by population size, Denmark had the most articles per million population, followed\nby Switzerland and the Netherlands.\nConclusions: The number of knee arthroplasty publications has rapidly increased in recent years.\nThe United States is the most prolific, but some European countries are more productive relative\nto their population.\n",

Original articles and reviews were\nincluded, and letters, editorial material,\nand corrections were excluded. The country\nof the corresponding author's institution\nwas considered the source nation.8,9\nThe number of articles and number of\ncitations were used as the quantity and\nquality indicator, respectively, of scientific\nproduction. Countries were classified into\nhigh-, upper-middle-, lower-middle-, and\nlow-income countries based on the categories\nset by World Bank.12 The gross national\nincome per capita was used to determine the\nor less as low income.12\nCountries with 1% publications were\nconsidered the main prolific countries. The\nfollowing data were collected: the total\nnumber of papers, the number of papers\nper capita, the total number of citations, and\nthe mean number of citations. The Central\nIntelligence Agency was used to gather the\npopulations of different countries.13 The\nnumber of articles published in the top five\njournals from the top five countries and the\nnumber of articles published from the top\nfive countries in the top five journals were\nalso collected.\nSPSS (version 19.0; IBM Corp., Armonk,\nNY) was used for all statistical tests.\nA P value of < 0.05 was considered to\nindicate statistical significance.

The United\nStates was the most prolific country in two of\nthe top five journals (Journal of Arthroplasty\nand Clinical Orthopaedics and Related\nResearch); the United Kingdom was the\nmost prolific country in Knee; Japan was\nthe most prolific country in Knee Surgery,\nSports Traumatology, Arthroscopy; and\nGermany was the most productive country\nin International Orthopaedics.\nDiscussion\nDue to worldwide contributions, the field of\nknee arthroplasty has shown great improve-\nments in recent years.2\u00ad4 The present study\nproved that the United States had far more\nknee arthroplasty publications than other\ncountries. Generally speaking, the United\nStates has been the most prolific country in\nmultiple medical fields for many decades.7\u00ad11\nMoreover, the United States had the highest\noverall number of citations and highest\nmean number of citations in the present\nstudy. This suggests that the United States\nnot only published a large quantity of\narticles in knee arthroplasty, but also high-\nquality publications in this field. Even with\nits high population, the United States\nremains one of the top countries with respect\nto the number of publications per capita.\nTherefore, the United States was the most\nprolific country in knee arthroplasty\nresearch worldwide.\nIn terms of the countries' contributions, a\ndescribing the ratio of non-high-income\nversus high-income countries14; this has\nbeen proven in multiple fields.7\u00ad11 A similar\nresult was found in the present study. China,\nTurkey, and India, three of the main prolific\ncountries, have played increasingly important\nroles in scientific production worldwide.7\u00ad11\nThis may reflect their rapid economic\ngrowth.15,16 However, only one article was\npublished among the low-income countries,\nindicating the lack of knee arthroplasty\nresearch in these countries. Insufficient finan-\ncial support, a lack of experienced research-\ners, and low-level medical care may be\nWhen adjusted by population, some\nEuropean countries, including Denmark,\nSwitzerland, and the Netherlands, ranked\nhigher. Moreover, some European coun-\ntries, such as Sweden and Denmark, were\nalso the top countries according to the mean\nnumber of citations. These results may\nindicate that some smaller European coun-\ntries not only have a relatively high output\nof publications in knee arthroplasty research\nTable 3. Top five countries in top five journals.\nUnited\nUnited\nUnited\nThe number of articles from each country is shown in parentheses.\nJA, Journal of Arthroplasty; KSSTA, Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy; CORR, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related\nResearch; IO, International Orthopaedics.\nbut also publish relatively high-quality art-\nicles. Although China, Turkey, and India\nwere three of the most prolific countries,\ntheir per-capita numbers of publications\nwere rather small. This may indicate that\ntheir outputs are relatively low, and further\nimprovement should be encouraged.\nThe United States was the most prolific\ncountry in the Journal of Arthroplasty and\nClinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,\nand these were also the two most prevalent\njournals in the United States. In fact, they\nare issued in the United States. More articles\nmay be submitted by authors in the United\nStates than by authors in other countries.\nSimilar findings were also demonstrated in\nthe other three top journals in the present\nstudy.\nThis study had some limitations. First,\nonly Web of Science was used to identify\nreports on knee arthroplasty. Papers from\njournals outside Web of Science were\nexcluded despite their contributions to\nglobal scientific production. Second, with\nrespect to the mean number of citations, it is\nmore reasonable to normalize the citations\nby the number of researchers instead of the\noverall population. In fact, it may be impos-\nsible to obtain the number of knee arthro-\nplasty researchers in each country. Third,\nthis was a cross-sectional survey at one time\npoint. The number of articles from each\ncountry may have been different if the study\nhad been conducted at another time point.\nFourth, it was difficult to distinguish articles\nfocusing on knee arthroplasty from those\nthat only mentioned or tangentially\naddressed it. Nevertheless, this study still\nprovides a comprehensive survey of knee\narthroplasty research and may therefore be\nused to track overall trends.\nConclusion\nA significant increase in knee arthroplasty\nThe United States was the most prolific\ncountry in knee arthroplasty. When popula-\ntion size was considered, some European\ncountries may have been more prolific.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any\nfunding agency in the public, commercial, or not-\nfor-profit sectors.\nReferences\n1.
