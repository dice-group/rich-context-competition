In this article, a recently\ndeveloped spatial point pattern test is discussed that compares the similarity of two different data sets.

In the\nsocial sciences, the most common forms of spatial analysis\nare conducted on points and areas, with the latter accounting\nfor the majority of such studies: understanding spatial pat-\nterns across census units, neighborhoods, counties, prov-\ninces/states, or countries, for example. However, the analysis\nof spatial point patterns is of interest to a number of disci-\nplines including criminology (Ratcliffe, 2005), ecology\nOne of the most commonly asked questions in the analy-\nsis of spatial point patterns is whether or not the spatial pat-\ntern follows one of the theoretical distributions: uniform,\nrandom, or clustered. Although this may be of some interest,\nit has been long known that human activities and their condi-\ntions are clustered in space (Gatrell et al., 1996). As such, a\nspatial point pattern test that can identify differences in the\nforms of clustering would be particularly instructive: is a\nphenomenon more clustered than expected, for example?\nResearchers may be interested in knowing how similar two\ncrime types are with regard to their spatial pattern or two\ndisease types. Identifying differences in crime and disease\ntype spatial patterns could help researchers identify unique\nrisk factors that may be addressed. Alternatively, if clusters\nof both can be identified, a common intervention may be\npossible.\nWhen analyzing spatial (point) patterns, there are two\nforms of analysis: global and local. Global spatial analyses\ninvestigate the spatial pattern and provide an overall statistic\nfor the entire study area; local spatial analyses investigate the\nsame spatial pattern, but provide statistics for all areal units\ninvolved such that the output of the analyses can be mapped.\nMoreover, it is now well-understood that global spatial anal-\nyses can mask local spatial patterns (Anselin, 1995; Getis\nAn area-based nonparametric spatial point\npattern test: The test, its applications, and\nthe future\nMartin A Andresen\n Keywords\nSpatial point pattern test, nonparametric, Monte Carlo, pattern similarity\nInstitute for Canadian Urban Research Studies, School of Criminology,\nSimon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada\nCorresponding author:\nMartin A Andresen, Institute for Canadian Urban Research Studies,\nSchool of Criminology, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive,\nEmail: andresen@sfu.ca\nOriginal Article\n2 Methodological Innovations\nquently, both forms of analysis should be considered if data\nare available.\nIn this article, a relatively recent spatial point pattern test\nis discussed. This spatial point pattern test identifies the simi-\nlarity of two spatial point patterns. As such, it is not con-\ncerned with the theoretical distributions of uniform, random,\nand clustered. The test, its applications, and directions for\nfuture research are all covered. This test is area-based (e.g.\ncensus tracts and neighborhoods), as opposed to point-based1\n(measured actual and expected distances between points),\nnonparametric, and provides both global and local output.\nBecause this spatial point pattern test is nonparametric, it\ndoes not rely on any underlying data-generating process or\ndistribution, or require that particular assumptions be met.\nThese assumptions usually involve particular statistical dis-\ntributions for the data, but with nonparametric tests, no such\nassumptions are required. In the case of this spatial point pat-\ntern test, it is a permutation test that generates its own distri-\nbution for the purposes of statistical inference.\nAll that is required are two spatial point pattern files and\nan area-based file; the graphical user interface that performs\nthe test, discussed below, can generate a grid of any size to\nact as the area-based file for analysis. The global output is an\nindex of similarity, S-Index, and the local output is an\nindicator of spatial similarity for each areal unit in the analy-\nsis that can be mapped; this latter output, and its interpreta-\ntion, is shown in an example below.\nSpatial point pattern test\nThe spatial point pattern test developed by Andresen (2009)\naddresses the issue of comparing the similarity of two point\npatterns without being concerned about the statistical con-\ncepts of randomness, uniformity, and clustering. This test is\nconceptually simple, but computationally intense. With the\ndevelopment of a graphical user interface (see Figure 1), the\napplication of this test is straightforward. For the purpose of\nunderstanding the nature of the test itself, an illustration is\nprovided here. There are a number of steps necessary to\nundertake the spatial point pattern test that are outlined below\nand illustrated in Figure 2--the steps are not discussed spe-\ncifically in terms of Figure 2, rather this figure is included to\naid in the understanding of the testing process through a vis-\nualization of the discussion.\nThe first step for the test is to identify the necessary data for\nanalysis. Although a somewhat manifest statement, there are\nsome data conditions necessary to conduct the test. At this\ntime, although future developments are discussed further\nbelow, two geo-referenced point-based data sets for\nFigure 1. Screenshot of the graphical user interface.\nAndresen 3\ncomparison are necessary. The geo-referencing is necessary\nbecause each point must be assigned to an individual areal unit\nof analysis. The areal unit data may take any number of differ-\nent forms: a set of grids placed over the study area, neighbor-\nhood boundaries, census tracts, or some other form of census\nboundary areas (census block groups, dissemination areas,\noutput areas, etc.). Although all of the examples just listed\nwould have complete coverage over the study area, this is not\nnecessary for the test. Rather, all of the geo-referenced point\ndata need to be assigned to an area; this becomes particularly\nimportant for some research questions, described in detail\nbelow. Briefly, street segments have been used in applications\nof this spatial point pattern test; street segments are polyline\nfiles that do not have complete coverage over a study area, by\ndefinition of the data. During the geocoding process, points\nare often placed on the appropriate side of the street based on\nthe address locator such that the points are not directly on\nthe polyline. This can be overcome through the use of small-\narea buffers around each street segment to place each geo-\nreferenced point within, but there will still be empty spaces\nbetween the buffers.\nOnce all of the necessary data are collected, the first deci-\nsion that needs to be made is which geo-referenced point\ndata set shall be deemed the base data set and the test data\nset; the base data are considered the baseline. From the per-\nspective of undertaking the test, this choice may be of little\nconsequence, but there may be \"natural\" choices. For exam-\nple, if the spatial point patterns of a phenomenon are being\nthe test data set. In this situation, the implicit question is\nwhether the 2015 data have a similar spatial pattern to the\n2014 data: has something changed over the year?\nThe base data set is manipulated the least during the test.\nEach geo-referenced point is assigned to an areal unit, the\nnumber of points within each areal unit is aggregated, and\nthe percentage of the points within each areal unit is calcu-\nlated. This allows for the comparison of data sets with differ-\nent numbers of points. This set of percentages will then be\nused to compare to the test data set that undergoes a Monte\nCarlo simulation process.\nSimilar to the base data set, the geo-referenced points\nwithin the test data set are assigned to an areal unit. At this\nstage, however, the process for the two data sets changes.\nRather than calculating a single percentage for each areal\nunit, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to create a con-\nfidence interval for each areal unit. A random sample (with\nreplacement) of the test data set is undertaken, selecting 85%\nof the entire test data set--this value is based on Ratcliffe\n(2004), but can be modified in the graphical user interface.\nThe percentages of points falling within each areal unit of\nthis randomly sampled data set are then calculated and\nstored. This process is repeated a number of times in order to\ncalculate a confidence interval for subsequent statistical test-\ning (200 is used for convenient cut-offs to generate a 95%\nconfidence interval).2 All of these percentages within each\nareal unit can then be ranked, removing the top and bottom\n2.5% of percentages to create a 95% nonparametric confi-\ndence interval. The percentage for the base and the upper\u00ad\nlower estimates for the test data are then compared. If the\npercentage of points for an areal unit in the base data set is\nwithin the corresponding confidence interval for the test data\nset, this areal unit is considered similar. This is repeated for\neach of the individual areal units of analysis.\nFigure 2. Steps for the spatial point pattern test.\n4 Methodological Innovations\nThis information can then be applied to calculate a global\nIndex of Similarity, S, that ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1\n(perfect similarity). This Index is calculated as follows\nS\ns\nn\ni\ni\nn\n= =\n\nwhere n is the number of areas, s\ni\nis equal to 1 if the spatial\npattern of two data sets is considered similar for areal unit i,\nand 0 otherwise. This Index of Similarity, then, represents\nthe proportion of areal units that exhibit similar spatial pat-\nterns. Finally, the output from the spatial point pattern test\ncan also be mapped such that the researcher can visualize\nwhere the two geo-referenced point-based data sets are (dis)\nsimilar. The graphical user interface, developed by Nick\nMalleson at the University of Leeds, is freely available (writ-\nten in Java to be platform independent): https://github.com/\nnickmalleson/spatialtest.\nThe last decision to be made is whether the two spatial\npoint patterns are to be considered similar, or not. This is\ndone using the global S-Index value. Although there is no\nstatistical method of identifying a threshold for similarity, a\nrule of thumb has been used in the application of this test.\nThere are rules of thumb for the interpretation of many statis-\ntics: at what point does R2 indicate an acceptable level for\ngoodness-of-fit? The rule of thumb used in the current con-\ntext relates to the literature that considers multicollinearity in\na multiple regression context and bivariate correlations. With\nregard to the multiple regression context, the variance infla-\ntion factor is often used to measure the degree of multicol-\nlinearity. O'Brien (2007) states that variance inflation factors\nranging from 5 to 10 (and greater, of course) may be cause\nfor concern. In a bivariate correlation context (most similar\nto the application of this spatial point pattern test), this cor-\nresponds to correlation coefficients ranging from 0.80 to\nbe considered \"strong,\" but these higher values are consid-\nered to be more conservative. Consequently, the research\nimplementing this test most often uses 0.80 as a threshold for\nsimilarity. However, it should be noted that this threshold is\nnot, and should not be, considered in a binary context such as\nstatistical significance. As the S-Index value approaches\n0.80, the two spatial point patterns should be considered\napproaching similarity.\nThe general underlying principle for this spatial point\npattern test is that the spatial pattern of the base data set is\ngiven (the percentages for the individual areal units are\njust calculated), but the spatial pattern for the test data set\nis one possible realization of the actual spatial point pat-\ntern. The randomization process maintains the underlying\nspatial pattern (data-generating process) of the test data set\nwhile creating sampling variation allowing for nonpara-\nmetric statistical inference through the calculation of con-\nfidence intervals.\nApplications of the spatial point pattern\ntest\nPrevious applications of the spatial point pattern\ntest\nThe first application of the spatial point pattern test is in the\npaper that initially develops the test (Andresen, 2009). In this\nfirst application, Andresen (2009) shows that the spatial\npoint patterns of theft of vehicle, burglary (commercial and\nresidential), and an aggregate of violent crime all appear to\nhave similar spatial patterns. However, the analysis shows,\nusing both census tracts and dissemination areas (the\nCanadian equivalent to the census block group in the United\nStates), that their similarities are actually quite low: S-Index\nsimilarity identified using the spatial point pattern test dis-\ncussed above, S0.80, none of these crime spatial patterns\ncan be considered similar. Consequently, any analysis of this\naggregated spatial pattern may be of little use because it does\nnot represent any particular crime that could be targeted for\nprevention or reduction. In fact, it is possible that one could\naggregate a number of clustered crime types into a spatial\npattern that appears to be random. Because of this, Andresen\n(2009) argues that the aggregation of different crime types is\nproblematic if one is implicitly or explicitly concerned with\nunderstanding spatial patterns of crime.\nIn an investigation of crime concentrations and the impor-\ntance of considering spatial scale when trying to understand\nspatial crime patterns, Andresen and Malleson (2011) con-\nsider the stability of spatial crime patterns through an applica-\ntion of the spatial point pattern test over time: same crime\ntype, but investigating changes in its spatial patterns over\nyears. Andresen and Malleson (2011) analyzed the crime\ntypes of assault, burglary, robbery, sexual assault, theft, theft\nof vehicle, and theft from vehicle considering census tracts,\ndissemination areas, and street segments. Overall, they found\nthat when considering census tracts and dissemination areas,\nthe spatial crime patterns were only relatively stable over\ntime for the rare events of robbery and sexual assault. Only\nwhen the authors analyzed the stability of spatial crime pat-\nterns at the street segment level did stability/similarity over\ntime emerge. However, this result was driven by the large per-\ncentage of street segments that did not have any crime; the\nS-Index values were all below 0.52 after this was controlled\nfor in a sensitivity analysis. The results and sensitivity analy-\nsis undertaken by Andresen and Malleson (2011) show a par-\nticularmanifestationofthemodifiablearealunitproblem--see\nmodifiable areal unit problem refers to statistical results\nchanging when the areal units change. There are two forms of\nthe modifiable areal unit problem: scale and zoning. The scale\nproblem is described above, indicating a change in the results\nwhen the scale of the analysis is changed. The zoning prob-\nlem occurs when smaller units are organized in a different\nAndresen 5\nway, but at the same spatial scale--shifting an existing set of\nneighborhoods, for example. This is a problem because (very)\ndifferent statistical results can emerge when changing areal\nunits. In fact, Fotheringham and Wong (1991) were able to\ngenerate any result through the modification of areal units.\nThis proves to be an important factor with this spatial point\npattern test and is discussed further, below.\nIn an extension of the original work done by Andresen\npattern test to investigate the similarity of spatial patterns of\ndifferent crime types. The primary research question was\nwhether it was appropriate to aggregate different crime types\nto their aggregate forms when the research is concerned with\nspatial patterns of crime: property crime and violent crime,\nfor example. Andresen and Linning (2012) also considered\nthree different spatial units of analysis (census tracts, dis-\nsemination areas, and street segments), but included crime\ndata from Ottawa (commercial burglary, residential burglary,\ncommercial robbery, individual robbery, other robbery, theft\nof vehicle, and a number of different aggregations) and\nVancouver (the same crime types as Andresen and Malleson,\n2011). Overall, they found that spatial crime patterns were\nnot similar across all crime types for census tracts and dis-\nsemination areas--different forms of robbery in Ottawa were\nthe exception. Only when street segments were used as the\nareal unit of analysis did the S-Index value reach the thresh-\nold of 0.80; however, this only occurred in Ottawa (all crime\ntypes) and Vancouver (robbery and sexual assault). Their\nconclusion was clear: only in a situation when crime is\nincredibly concentrated (Ottawa's central business district) is\nit appropriate to aggregate different crime types together.\nAndresen and Malleson (2013b) explicitly investigate the\nimpact of the modifiable areal unit problem using the spatial\npoint pattern test using data from Vancouver, Canada, and\nLeeds, England. Specifically, Andresen and Malleson\n(2013b) consider the change in the spatial patterns of crime\nover time using two different areal units of analysis in each\ncity. They then compare the results for the different spatial\nscales to investigate the percentage of the smaller areal units\nwithin the larger areal units that exhibit the same change.\nGenerally speaking, these authors find that approximately\none-half of the smaller areal units exhibit the same spatial\nchange as the larger areal units that the smaller areal units\nfall within. Clearly, any results found for larger areal units\nare being driven by one-half of the smaller areal units. This\nshows the relationship between the modifiable areal unit\nproblem and the ecological fallacy in this context--the eco-\nlogical fallacy is committed when the researcher makes\ninference at a finer scale of resolution than is being analyzed,\nmaking inferences regarding individuals when neighbor-\nhoods are the unit of analysis, for example. Moreover,\nbecause of the nature of statistical testing, Andresen and\nMalleson (2013b) found that in some cases, none of the\nsmaller areal units of analysis exhibited the same spatial\nchange as the larger areal units. This was investigated in\ndetail, and it was found that only when the data were aggre-\ngated to the larger areal units was (marginal) statistical sig-\nnificance obtained in the results. As such, care must be taken\nwhen making statistical inferences with spatial data.\nIn another consideration of (in)appropriate aggregation of\ncrime data, Andresen and Malleson (2013a) investigated the\nsimilarity of spatial crime patterns across the different sea-\nsons of the year. Their research question was concerned with\nthe value of yearly counts of crime, and corresponding rates,\nwhen considering any explanation of the respective patterns.\nIf the spatial patterns of crime changed from season to sea-\nson, are the spatial patterns of a yearly aggregate meaning-\nful? Considering both census tracts and dissemination areas,\nAndresen and Malleson (2013a) found that the spatial pat-\nterns of crime were rather dissimilar for seven of the eight\ncrime types investigated. Only robbery and sexual assault\nhad S-Index values that exceeded the threshold of 0.80, and\nonly for dissemination areas. However, it should be noted\nthat these two crime types have low counts and there are\nmany dissemination areas, so the zero-value issue emerges\nhere as well--Andresen and Malleson (2013a) did not under-\ntake sensitivity analyses in this instance. Regardless, this\nshows that spatial patterns of crime change throughout the\nyear and must be considered, as stated by the authors, when\nconsidering crime prevention initiatives.\nThe next analysis of spatial point pattern similarity was\nundertaken by Andresen and Malleson (2014) in an analysis\nof crime displacement from a police foot patrol initiative.\nMost investigations of crime displacement (the movement of\ncriminal activity because of a crime prevention initiative,\nsuch as a police foot patrol) have a treatment area and a\ncatchment area that immediately surrounds the treatment\narea; this is done because it is assumed that crime may be\ndisplaced and move around the corner (Weisburd et al.,\n2006).Although there are still many questions to be answered\nregarding this process, research in this sub-field of crime\nprevention finds evidence for a diffusion of benefits: crimi-\nnal activity decreases in both the treatment area and the\ncatchment area (Guerette and Bowers, 2009; Johnson et al.,\nAndresen and Malleson (2014) ask the following ques-\ntion: in the presence of a diffusion of crime prevention ben-\nefits, does the spatial pattern of criminal activity change, or\ndoes criminal activity go down in the same way in all places?\nFor example, suppose the levels of crime were the same in\nthe treatment area with a crime prevention initiative and the\ncatchment area without that crime prevention initiative:\ncrime goes down everywhere to the same degree. However,\ncrime could go down everywhere but at different rates in dif-\nferent places. Such a situation could be illustrated with a bal-\nloon: crime goes down everywhere such that the balloon now\nhas less air in it, but it goes down more in the treatment area\nwith the crime prevention initiative. This can be visualized\nby pushing down in the center of a deflated balloon. Crime\nhas gone down everywhere, but the spatial pattern has\n6 Methodological Innovations\nchanged such that there is now relatively more crime in the\nsurrounding area. This situation may occur when offenders\ndo move around the corner from the crime prevention initia-\ntive, but are less active there than before.\nIn their analyses, Andresen and Malleson (2014) found\nmoderate support for a change in the spatial pattern of crime\n(in the presence of criminal activity decreasing in both the\ntreatment area and the surrounding catchment area), indicat-\ning that the distribution of criminal activity shifts toward the\nsurrounding area although that criminal activity decreases\neverywhere. This has important implications for further crime\nprevention initiatives because it shows a rational response\nfrom offenders: offenders decrease criminal activity, but shift\ntheir remaining criminal activity away from where the police\nare known to be.\nAlthough they consider multiple methodologies to address\ntheir research question, Tompson et al. (2015) investigate the\nsimilarity of open-source crime data in the United Kingdom\nto actual police-recorded crime data. The issue is that in order\nto make criminal event data available to the public while\nsimultaneously considering privacy and confidentiality, the\ndevelopers of the open-source data undertake a process of\ngeomasking that adds \"noise\" to the data such that actual\nlocations of criminal events cannot be known. Tompson et al.\n(2015) were concerned whether this geomasking changed the\nunderlying (and true) spatial crime patterns. Overall, these\nauthors found that the similarity of these two data sources was\nnot particularly high when considering small areas of analysis\nsuch as postal codes and output areas. However, when consid-\nering larger geographic areas, Tompson et al. (2015) found a\nhigh degree of similarity between the two different data\nsources for most crime types (lower layer super output areas\nand middle layer super output areas).\nIn another consideration of temporal aggregation,\nAndresen and Malleson (2015) investigated the similarity of\nspatial crime patterns for different days of the week for\nassault, burglary, robbery, sexual assault, theft, theft of vehi-\ncle, and theft from vehicle considering census tracts and dis-\nsemination areas. Similar to the seasonality research of\nAndresen and Malleson (2013a), this research found that the\nspatial patterns of crime changed significantly for different\ndays of the week; the only exceptions were robbery and sex-\nual assault with disseminations areas.\nExtending the work of Andresen and Linning (2012), Melo\net al. (2015) investigated the appropriateness of aggregating\ncrime types in Campinas, Brazil. In their analysis, Melo et al.\n(2015) not only considered a number of spatial scales (pon-\nderation areas, census tracts, and street segments) but consid-\nered the impact of zero-values beyond what has been discussed\nabove. Melo et al. (2015) undertook a sensitivity analysis that\nonly considered non-zero street segments to test the similarity\nof spatial point patterns in two ways; first, they considered a\nstreet segment non-zero if it had any criminal event, similar to\nthe sensitivity analyses discussed above, and, second, they\nconsidered a street segment non-zero if it had any crime that\nrelated to the two crime types being tested. Melo et al. (2015)\nfound that the former definition of a non-zero street segment\nstill resulted in a high degree of similarity in the spatial point\npatterns of most crime type comparisons. However, with the\nlatter, and arguably more appropriate, definition of a non-zero\nstreet segment, very few of the comparisons achieved or\napproached the threshold S-Index value of 0.80. This result is\nparticularly important because of the great detail in the crime\ntypes analyzed, indicating that it is almost never appropriate to\naggregate crime types if one is concerned with spatial crime\npatterns.\nIn an extension of Andresen and Malleson (2013a),\nLinning (2015) investigated the spatial patterns of seasonal-\nity in Vancouver and Ottawa considering the micro-spatial\nunit of analysis, the street segment. Despite the presence of\ntemporal seasonal patterns, Linning (2015) found no evi-\ndence for changing spatial patterns of crime in either city.\nThis result shows the importance of the areal unit of analysis\nand the modifiable areal unit problem.\nAnd most recently in the context of crime, Pereira et al. (in\npress) investigated the spatial patterns of homicide in Recife,\nBrazil. There has been a significant drop in homicides in\nRecife in recent years, and Pereira et al. (in press) found that\nthese homicides were highly concentrated. Moreover, Pereira\net al. (in press) found a high degree of spatial similarity from\nyear to year while the homicide rate dropped almost 50%\nbecause so much of the city does not have any homicides.\nEven when considering non-zero areal units of analysis (cen-\nsus tracts and street segments), there was a moderately high\ndegree of spatial similarity. Specifically, the use of the spatial\npoint pattern test in conjunction with other analyses indicates\nthat homicides simply stopped occurring in particular places\nin Recife.\nAt this time, Andresen (2010) is the only application of\nthis spatial point pattern test that is outside of a criminological\ncontext--this potential is discussed further below. In this arti-\ncle, Andresen (2010) investigates the changing spatial pat-\nterns of interprovincial and international trade after the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement entered into force in 1994.\nInternational trade theory predicts that when barriers to trade,\nsuch as tariffs, are removed, spatial patterns of interprovincial\nand international trade may change. Andresen's (2010) data,\nhowever, are not points but values assigned to Canadian prov-\ninces and US states. In an effort to apply the spatial point\npattern test to these data, Andresen (2010) uses the concept of\na quasi-point: if British Columbia exports CAD5\nmillion of\ngoods to Texas, place 5 points within Texas for an analysis\nof changing trading patterns for British Columbia. With\nprovinces and states being the units of analysis, as long as\nno inference is made at larger cartographic scales (smaller\nareas), issues regarding the ecological fallacy will not emerge\n(Openshaw, 1984a). In any event, the quasi-point proved to\nbe instructive for the use of the spatial point pattern test. As\nexpected, Andresen (2010) found that the spatial patterns of\ninterprovincial and international trade changed substantially\nAndresen 7\nafter the North American Free Trade Agreement entered into\nforce. Moreover, the mapped output from the spatial point\npattern test was able to show that the spatial pattern of trade\nshifted toward the United States, away from Canadian prov-\ninces, after the removal of trade barriers.\nAn example of the test and its output\nAlthough instructive and containing interesting information\nfor the spatial analysis of crime, the above discussions are\nlimited without a complete presentation of the results.\nHowever, a full detailed account of all of these analyses is far\nbeyond the scope of this article. As such, a detailed account\nof the seasonality study undertaken by Andresen and\nMalleson (2013a) is discussed here, with a map of the output\nfrom the spatial point pattern test.\nAs stated above,Andresen and Malleson (2013a) found that\nspatial crime patterns were not similar from season to season,\nan indication that aggregating criminal events to a yearly\naggregate may be problematic. As shown by Linning (2015),\nthis may not be the case at the micro-spatial unit of analysis, but\nthis result may have important implications for understanding\nspatial crime patterns at more spatially aggregated levels.\nConsidering all crime types, Andresen and Malleson\nfor census tracts and dissemination areas. This is clearly not\neven close to the threshold value of 0.80, indicating a lack of\nspatial similarity. Perhaps more interesting, however, is the\nlocal spatial output from the spatial point pattern test. Figure\n3a shows Vancouver with some points of interest, and Figure\n3b shows the output from the test comparing the yearly\naggregate to summer. In summer, the spatial pattern of crime\nshifts more toward the places where people spend their rec-\nreational time: Kitsilano Beach out toward the University of\nBritish Columbia (UBC), Stanley Park, downtown, Queen\nElizabeth Park, and the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE).\nThese locations attract residents and tourists alike during the\nsummer months, shifting the concentrations of targets for a\nnumber of different crime types. This is exactly what would\nbe expected according to theories of environmental criminol-\nogy (Andresen, 2014), showing the utility of visualizing the\noutput of the spatial point pattern test.\nPotential applications of the spatial point pattern\ntest\nThe discussions above have shown the utility of this spatial\npoint pattern test in the context of understanding the spatial\npatterns of crime, and one application within the interna-\ntional trade literature. However, the potential applications of\nthis spatial point pattern test are in any context when the\nsimilarity between two spatial point patterns is of interest. In\nparticular, this test is useful when the researcher is not par-\nticularly concerned whether the spatial pattern of their data is\nconsidered uniform, random, or clustered.\nThis is similar to the issue of how to calculate a crime rate\nand choose the appropriate denominator (Andresen, 2011). If\none is interested in the spatial patterning of traffic collisions,\nthe base consideration is not the theoretical distribution of a\nclustered phenomenon, but the underlying distribution of\ntraffic overall: is the clustering of traffic collisions different\nthan the overall clustering of traffic? If so, where? This has a\nnumber of applications within the social science, but also the\nhealth sciences, environmental studies, and urban planning.\nDirections and considerations for the\nfuture\nThus far, the research on this spatial point pattern test has\ngenerated one methodological issue that must always be con-\nsidered, a number of extensions to the spatial point pattern\ntest and its software, and some theoretical implications for\ntesting. Each is discussed in turn.\nThe methodological issue relates to the modifiable areal\nunit problem (Fotheringham and Wong, 1991; Openshaw,\n1984b) and non-zero street segments. In the context of street\nsegments, many social phenomena will have some degree of\nclustering. In Vancouver, there are just over 10,000 street seg-\nments that an analysis must consider. If the phenomenon\nunder study is a relatively rare event, concentrations will nec-\nessarily appear in global statistics: a crime type that has 1000\nevents in a particular year will have a minimum level of con-\nments). In this situation, even if all of these criminal events\nmove to a completely different set of locations within the city,\nthe S-Index value will be 0.80, indicating spatial similarity.\nAlthough technically true, because 80% of the city has the\nsame levels of criminal events (zero), this is problematic for\nunderstanding the spatial crime patterns in a city, especially if\none wishes to prevent those criminal events.\nAs such, when considering the similarity of two spatial\npoint patterns, one must be aware of this potential when ana-\nlyzing data using a large number of small areal units of anal-\nysis. This is a particular form of the modifiable areal unit\nproblem when the change in the S-Index with a change in the\nareal units of analysis will most often be known: the greater\nthe number of areal units in the study area and the fewer the\nnumber of events under analysis, the more similar two spa-\ntial point patterns will appear to be. Consequently, this is not\na property of the spatial point pattern test, but a consequence\nof assigning a relatively small number of events to a large\nnumber of places.\nThe first extension to the spatial point pattern test relates\nto the concept of the quasi-point introduced by Andresen\n(2010) in the context of international and interprovincial\ntrade pattern changes. It is a relatively simple task to have the\nprogram that runs the spatial point pattern test to create\nquasi-points if the data are organized appropriately. For\ninstance, if the data were organized such that areal unit of\nanalysis i had a count of n events (e.g. events is a general\n8 Methodological Innovations\nterm here that could refer to millions of dollars of interna-\ntional trade), the program could generate an analysis data set\nthat would then include n observations for areal unit i.\nConsequently, rather than having i observations each having\na count of events, the analysis data set would have i\u00d7n\nobservations each representing a single event. These could\nbe quasi-points, as defined by the researcher in some\nmeaningful way for the analysis. Alternatively, such data\ncould represent actual points in a manner that the researcher\ndoes not have access to the original data: a count of events\nwithin a neighborhood, for example. It is not uncommon for\ncriminal event data to be available as counts within some\nareal unit (neighborhoods, police beats, census tracts, etc.) as\na means of maintaining confidentiality for the victims.\nFigure 3. Spatial point pattern test local output, all crimes, yearly aggregate versus summer: (a) Vancouver and points of interest and\n(b) spatial point pattern test local output.\nAndresen 9\nSecond, the graphical user interface could be further\ndeveloped to describe the differences and similarities\nbetween the two point patterns analyzed. For example, some\nbrief descriptive statistics could be provided. The graphical\nuser interface calculates the S-Index, so the user could manu-\nally calculate the non-similarity index: 1\n-\nS. However, it\nmay be of particular interest to the researcher to know the\npercentages when base\n>\ntest and test\n>\nbase. Moreover, if\nlayers of census data could be added, the different outputs\n(insignificant change, base\n>\ntest, test\n>\nbase) could be auto-\nmatically compared to those census data. Of course, these are\nall subsequent analyses that could be undertaken within other\nGIS software, but this availability will make the current\ngraphical user interface more functional for the user.\nThird, in case the standard distributions of uniform or ran-\ndom are of interest to the researcher, the graphical user inter-\nface could generate a random or uniform set of points within\nthe study area (with an option for how many points). These\npoints could then be used as the base data set to investigate\nhow similar the spatial pattern of interest is to a random or\nuniform spatial pattern.\nFourth, further investigations into the threshold values of\nthe S-Index need to be undertaken. Specifically, the S-Index\ncould be calculated with comparisons to a random distribu-\ntion, for example, to generate a distribution of the S-Index\nvalues that could be used for identifying the threshold for\nsimilarity. Such a method would be preferable to the ad hoc,\nthough instructive, method discussed above.\nAnd fifth, a natural extension of the spatial point pattern\ntest is to move beyond \"bivariate\" comparisons. At this time,\nthe program for the spatial point pattern test is set up to com-\npare two spatial point patterns. However, there is no reason\nwhy this test cannot be expanded into a multivariate context.\nIn such a testing situation, one could find the degree of simi-\nlarity across three or more spatial point patterns. Figure 4\nshows four different possibilities for such a multivariate spa-\ntial point pattern test. The dashed horizontal line represents\nthe base percentage of points for the test, and the vertical\nlines represent the confidence intervals for the various test\ndata sets: comparing the spatial pattern of crime in 2000\n(base) versus a number of subsequent years (test data sets).\nIn these scenarios, the base percentage is always within the\nconfidence intervals (a), initially within the confidence inter-\nvals but then the confidence intervals fall to zero represent-\ning the crime drop (b), sporadically similar for the base and\nsubsequent test data sets (c), and never similar over time (d).\nSuch a comparison would be particularly instructive for\nthe crime and place literature that has been concerned with\nthe stability of crime concentrations over time (Weisburd\net al., 2012). Although pairs of years over time can be com-\npared to investigate the stability (Andresen and Malleson,\n2011), knowing whether places are consistently stable over\ntime would be particularly instructive for the crime and place\nliterature. As such, in a multivariate spatial context, this spa-\ntial point pattern test could investigate the stability of spatial\nyears, as investigated in the crime\nFigure 4. Multivariate spatial point pattern test.\n10 Methodological Innovations\nand place literature. Such an extension to the spatial point\npattern test could prove to be important. It is possible, for\nexample, that a spatial pattern may appear to be stable over\ntime when undertaking pair-wise comparisons but be quite\ndifferent when considering the entire study period. Such a\nsituation could emerge when year-to-year patterns are simi-\nlar but similar in different places in each pair-wise compari-\nson. Only when considering the entire study period within a\nsingle test could spatial stability be truly confirmed or denied.\nFinally, the development of different testing methodolo-\ngies has implications for testing theories. For example, tests\nof theories within environmental criminology (place-based\ntheories) often consider random and uniform distributions as\nthe baseline. Are criminal events clustered, relative to a ran-\ndom distribution? However, we know that human activities,\nboth criminal and non-criminal, are clustered in space. As\nsuch, testing to see whether a specific human activity is clus-\ntered is essentially tautological.Amore sensible baseline dis-\ntribution for the clustering of crime would be a representation\nof the road network. Road networks tend to have greater den-\nsity in the central business district than the suburbs, so ran-\ndomly placed points on a road network will appear clustered.\nA point-based representation of the street segments in a road\nnetwork could be used as the base data set with crime data as\nthe test data set to investigate any greater concentrations of\ncrime in particular areas. This information could then be\nused when conducting theoretical testing, rather than solely\nrelying upon census data.\nConclusion\nThis article has reviewed the development, applications, and\nfuture for a relatively recent spatial statistical test used in the\nsocial sciences. This is a spatial point pattern test that is non-\nparametric and finds the degree of similarity between two\nspatial point data sets. The output from this test is a global\nstatistic of similarity, the S-Index, and local output that can\nbe mapped. The current applications for this test are domi-\nnantly criminological, but the potential for its use outside of\nspatial criminology should be quite apparent from the dis-\ncussions above.\nAlthough this spatial point pattern test is still in its infancy,\nits utility beyond identifying uniform, random, and clustered\nspatial point patterns has been shown here. Most human,\nsocial, and environmental processes are not random or uni-\nform across space. Consequently, a test that allows for com-\nparisons of spatial point patterns without a concern for these\ntheoretical distributions is instructive for the social and envi-\nronmental sciences.\nThere is still a lot of work to be done to make this spatial\npoint pattern test more practical for uses on other contexts,\nbut these are programming tasks with no need for further\ndevelopment of the test itself. As with the current graphical\nuser interface (https://github.com/nickmalleson/spatialtest),\nfuture developments of the test will continue to remain freely\navailable and open source. In addition to the flexibility\nenhancements discussed above, it is hoped that this new spa-\ntial point pattern test will soon be available as a library within\nthe R Project for Statistical Computing (http://www.r-pro-\nject.org/).\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship, and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1.
