This study investigated the effects of cognitive and emotional status on subsequent lower body func-\ntion in a population-based sample of older Mexican Americans.\nMethods. A 2-year prospective cohort study included Mexican Americans aged 65 and older who scored 18 or\nhigher on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at baseline interview and for whom complete data on a summary\nperformance measure of lower body function were available at the 2-year follow-up interview (n  2068).

In a multivariate analysis, continuous MMSE (b  0.06; SE 0.02, p  .004) and Center for Epidemiological\nStudies\u00adDepression (CES-D) (b  0.53; SE 0.17, p  .002) scores at baseline were significantly associated with a\nsummary performance measure of lower body function 2 years later, controlling for age, gender, marital status, educa-\ntion, selected medical conditions, and baseline summary performance score. A significant MMSE\u00adby\u00adCES-D interac-\ntion (p  .002) on summary performance score was also found after adjustments were made for age, gender, marital\nstatus, education, chronic health conditions, and baseline summary performance score. After adjusting for age, gender,\nmarital status, education, selected medical conditions, and baseline summary performance score, subjects with low cog-\nnition (MMSE score 18\u00ad21) and high depressive symptoms (CES-D score  16) were the most likely to have poor sum-\nmary performance scores 2 years later (b  0.95, SE 0.36, p  .008), followed by subjects with high cognition\n.03), with high cognition (MMSE score  21) and low depressive symptoms (CES-D score  16) used as the reference.\nConclusions. Our results confirm prior investigations showing both cognitive function and emotional health predict\nsubsequent lower body function, and extend these findings to older Mexican Americans. In addition, our results indicate\nthat good emotional health moderates the impact of low cognition on subsequent physical function.\nPTIMAL mental health (cognitive and emotional func-\ntioning) is an important factor for maintaining physical\nfunction. The deleterious effects of poor mental health in\nlate life on functional ability have been well characterized\n(1\u00ad11). Several aging studies have reported on the relation-\nship between poor cognitive functioning and increased limi-\ntations in activities of daily living (ADLs) (1\u00ad5). Moritz\nand colleagues, using data from the New Haven Estab-\nlished Populations for Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly\n(EPESE), showed that the odds of reporting disability in\nADLs at the 3-year follow-up were about 2.5 times greater\nin subjects with low cognitive ability at baseline compared\nwith those with normal cognitive ability (2). Data from the\nNun Study showed older women with low-normal cognitive\nfunction on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) at\nbaseline had twice the risk of ADL disability at follow-up\nrelative to those with high-normal cognition (3).\nStudies have also reported on the association between\nemotional health and subsequent disability among older\nadults (6\u00ad11). Cronin-Stubbs and colleagues, in a study of\n3434 older persons living in the community, reported a gra-\ndient of risk between increasing number of depressive\nsymptoms and ADL disability, adjusting for relevant risk\nfactors (11). Penninx and colleagues reported in a group of\nthat an increasing number of depressive symptoms at base-\nline was a significant predictor of declining lower body\nfunction 4 years later, adjusting for relevant sociodemo-\ngraphic factors and health status (9).\nIt is not clear, however, if cognitive ability and emotional\nhealth interact to affect physical functioning in older Mexican\nAmericans. Thus, the purpose of this study is two-fold. First,\nwe investigate the independent relationships of cognitive\nability and emotional health on lower-body function 2 years\nlater in a community sample of older Mexican Americans.\nSecond, because past research has shown good emotional\nhealth to positively influence the rate of recovery 1-year post\nmedical event (12), we plan to test the hypothesis that good\nO\nemotional health will moderate the association between low\ncognitive ability and decline in lower body function.\nMETHODS\nSample\nData are from the Hispanic Established Population for the\nEpidemiologic Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE). The H-EPESE\nis an ongoing National Institute on Aging-funded commu-\nnity-based study of 3050 Mexican American subjects aged\n65 and older (13). The sample was designed to be generaliz-\nable to approximately 85% of older Mexican Americans liv-\ning in five southwestern states including Texas, California,\nColorado, Arizona, and New Mexico (13). A full description\nof the rationale, methods, and subject characteristics can be\nfound elsewhere (13). The response rate at baseline inter-\nviewed in person and 272 (8.9%) by proxy. Only subjects\nwho scored 18 or higher on the MMSE were asked to at-\ntempt the lower-body performance tasks. Thus, the present\nstudy includes data on subjects who scored 18 or higher on\nthe MMSE and who also had complete data on a summary\nperformance measure of lower body function (n  2068) at\nMeasures\nCognitive function.--The MMSE is a 30-item measure-\nment instrument used to assess cognitive function. It is\namong the most frequently used cognitive screening mea-\nsures in studies of older adults (14), but it cannot be used to\ndiagnose dementia. The English and Spanish versions of the\nMMSE were adopted from the Diagnostic Interview Scale\n(DIS) and have been used in prior community surveys (15).\nScores have a potential range of 0 to 30, with lower scores\nindicating poorer cognitive ability. MMSE score was used\nas a continuous variable (range 18\u00ad30) and was dichoto-\nEmotional health.--The Center for Epidemiological\nStudies\u00adDepression (CES-D) scale is widely used as a mea-\nsure of emotional health in community studies of older peo-\njects are asked whether they have experienced certain\npositive or negative feelings or symptoms in the past week.\nResponses are scored on a four-point scale (0 to 3). Scores\nfor the positive items are reversed and the 20 items\nsummed. The CES-D has a potential range of 0 to 60, with\nhigher scores indicating increased depressive symptoms. In\nthe analysis, CES-D score was used both as a continuous\nand dichotomized variable. Individuals with a score of less\nthan 16 were classified as having low depressive symptoms\nfied as having high depressive symptoms (n  432) (17).\nSummary performance measure of lower body func-\ntion.--The summary performance measure is comprised of\nthree lower-body activities: a timed 8-foot walk, rising from\na chair five times, and a hierarchical standing balance task\n(19,20). Using previously established criteria (19), perfor-\nmance on each task is classified on a scale ranging from 0 to\n4. Subjects unable to perform the particular task received a\n0 score, and a 1\u00ad4 score was assigned to those able to com-\nplete the task. When the three tasks were summed, an over-\nall summary performance measure score ranging from 0 to\n12 was created, where higher scores represented better func-\ntioning.\nCovariates\nBaseline sociodemographic variables included age, gen-\nder, marital status, education, and selected health condi-\ntions. Subjects were asked if they ever had a physician diag-\nnosis of heart attack, stroke, arthritis, or diabetes.\nStatistical Analyses\nWe examined selected baseline variables for all subjects\nwho scored 18 or higher on the MMSE at baseline by sum-\nmary performance category using contingency tables (2\nanalysis using a two-tailed p value  .05). Four multivariate\nGeneral Linear Models (GLMs) assessed the independent\nrelationship of continuous MMSE and CES-D score at base-\nline on summary performance score 2 years later. The first\nmodel included the continuous MMSE and CES-D scores,\nand summary performance score; the second model added\nage, gender, marital status, and education; and the third\nmodel added selected medical conditions including heart at-\ntack, stroke, diabetes, and arthritis. The fourth GLM model\nadded the continuous MMSE\u00adby\u00adCES-D interaction term.\nUsing GLM models, we next examined the association of\nhigh (score  21) and low (score  21) MMSE score by\nhigh (score  16) and low (score  16) CES-D score on\nsummary performance score 2 years later. The first model\nadjusted for baseline summary performance score, age, gen-\nder, marital status, and education, and the second model\nadded selected health conditions including heart attack,\nstroke, diabetes, and arthritis.\nRESULTS\nTable 1 presents baseline sociodemographic characteris-\ntics, selected diseases, CES-D and MMSE scores, by sum-\nmary performance category 2 years later. Subjects aged 65\u00ad\n74 were more likely to have higher summary performance\nscores 2 years later, while those aged 85 and older were\nmore likely to have lower summary performance scores 2\nyears later. Women, the unmarried, and those with less edu-\ncation, CES-D  16, and lower MMSE scores were more\nlikely to be in the lowest summary performance category at\nfollow up.\nFigure 1 shows the percent change in summary perfor-\nmance score from baseline to the 2-year follow-up by CES-D\ncent change was categorized as a decline, no change, or im-\nprovement.

With the addition\nof age, gender, marital status, and education (Model 2), both\nMMSE and CES-D remained significant predictors of sum-\nmary performance score. Both variables continued to be sig-\nnificant with the further addition of selected medical condi-\ntions (Model 3). Using MMSE and CES-D as continuous\nvariables and adjusting for the variables in Model 3, we then\ninvestigated the relationship between an MMSE\u00adby\u00adCES-D\ninteraction term on 2-year summary performance score.

There is a\nsignificant relationship between higher baseline MMSE\nscore and physical performance score 2 years later among\nolder Mexican Americans, after adjusting for relevant so-\nciodemographic characteristics, selected medical condi-\ntions, and summary performance score at baseline. Addi-\ntionally, we found a significant inverse relationship between\nbaseline CES-D score and physical performance score 2\nyears later. These findings are consistent with previous\nstudies (1\u00ad11). We also found a previously unreported inter-\naction between cognition and emotional status. Subjects\nwith poor cognitive and CES-D scores were significantly\nmore likely to have poorer summary performance scores 2\nyears later compared to those with poor cognition and\nnondepressed affect. The interaction between MMSE and\nCES-D score on summary performance suggests that the\npresence of subsyndromal depressive symptoms may exac-\nerbate the deleterious effect of impaired cognition on physi-\ncal performance in older adults.\nPrevious research has demonstrated an association be-\ntween depression and impaired physical function among\nolder adults with dementia (21\u00ad24). These studies suggest\nthat clinical depression is a major contributor to excess dis-\nability. Past studies in older adults have also shown that\nsubsyndromal depressive symptoms are significantly asso-\nciated with incident disability and subsequent physical de-\ncline in older blacks and whites (9\u00ad11,25). For instance,\nPenninx and colleagues, using a summary performance\nmeasure, showed depressive symptoms were predictive of\nsubsequent physical decline in community-living older\nadults (9). Our results extend these studies by showing the\nTable 1.

Because depression or depressive symptoms\nare associated with lack of energy, fatigue, and decreased vi-\ntality, individuals with high depressive symptoms may be\nless motivated to engage in mobility-related activities. Con-\nversely, cognitively impaired individuals with good affect\nmay be more motivated to engage in physical activities and\nother healthy lifestyles. Thus, good emotional health may\nmoderate the adverse consequences of impaired cognition on\nphysical health. Ostir and colleagues showed that a high\nlevel of positive emotion was significantly associated with\nless ADL disability 2 years later (26).\nFurther, specific cognitive deficits may interfere with tests\nof physical performances such as task-sequencing impair-\nments (apraxia). Hence, persons with low MMSE scores\nmay be less able to engage in physical and social activities.\nThis disengagement may also stem from decreased motiva-\ntion associated with depressed mood as well as the disabling\neffect of specific cognitive deficits on mobility tasks. The\nco-occurrence of cognitive and affective impairments further\ncompromises the adaptive and coping capability of older\npersons to environmental and medical stressors. This might\ntranslate into less physical exercise, poor adherence to treat-\nment regimen, and low motivation to engage in other healthy\nlifestyles, factors that may moderate subsequent physical de-\ncline and scores on lower body performance measures.\nThere are other possible explanations for how poor cog-\nnitive and emotional function at baseline may result in\npoorer physical performance. An unrecognized medical\ncondition, such as a minor stroke, may cause depressive\nsymptoms or impairment of cognition, which in turn may be\nreflected in poorer mobility performance. In this scenario,\ncognitive and affective deficits might manifest much earlier,\nbefore demonstrable deficits in physical performance mea-\nsures are recognized. Previous studies have demonstrated a\nsignificant association between low cognitive function and\nan increased risk of subsequent stroke (27,28). We have no\ndirect evidence in our study that incident limitations in\nphysical performance at follow-up are due to stroke or any\nspecific medical condition known to be associated with de-\npression and impaired cognition.\nThis study has some limitations. The first is the generaliz-\nability to other populations. For instance, some items on the\nCES-D, such as the concepts of happiness, hopefulness, life\nenjoyment, and feeling good, may be interpreted differently\nin different cultures. However, the relationship between\nTable 2.

For example, past studies have reported on the asso-\nciation between high depressive symptoms and increased\nrisk of subsequent physical decline among older blacks and\nwhites (9\u00ad11). A second limitation is the reliance on self-\nreported CES-D measures in cognitively impaired subjects.\nHowever, all subjects included in the analysis had to score\n18 or higher on the MMSE, which would remove some of\nthe potential bias.\nOur study has several strengths including its large commu-\nnity-based sample, its prospective design, and its use of ob-\njective measures of lower body function. Objective measures\nof lower body function have a number of advantages over\nself-reports, including increased validity and reproducibility\nand less bias from variations in culture, language, mood, cog-\nIn conclusion, the present findings showed the independent\nand interactive effects of cognitive and emotional status on\nsubsequent physical disability 2 years later in a large commu-\nnity sample of older Hispanics. Multiple approaches are\nneeded to maintain function in cognitively impaired elders.\nOne approach is the early recognition and treatment of depres-\nsion. Further, community-based programs to promote in-\ncreased physical activities and intellectual engagements in the\nolder population, particularly among the cognitively impaired,\nmerit further study. The results of this study and others may\nlay the groundwork for the development of diagnostic and\ntherapeutic strategies to prevent or delay the onset of cognitive\nand physical disability in older Mexican Americans, one of\nthe fastest growing ethnic groups in the United States.\n"
