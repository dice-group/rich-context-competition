In HELP,\nall patients were 80 years of age or older\nand were enrolled at the time of emer-\ngency hospital admissions.

We\nexpected that the likelihood of having\nCPR at the end of life would reflect pa-\ntients' prognoses and preferences. We\naimed to measure the strength of those\nassociations and to assess the poten-\ntial impact of other clinical and demo-\ngraphic factors.\nMETHODS\nStudy Population\nThe data collection methods used in\nSUPPORT have been reported previ-\nrolled patients 18 years of age or older\nwho met specific severity criteria for 1\nof 9 serious illnesses (nontraumatic\ncoma, acute respiratory failure, mul-\ntiple organ system failure with sepsis\nand multiple organ system failure with\nmalignancy, chronic obstructive pul-\nmonary disease, congestive heart fail-\nure [CHF], cirrhosis, metastatic colon\ncancer, or inoperable non\u00adsmall cell\nlung cancer) who were admitted to 1\nof 5 medical centers: Beth Israel Hos-\npital, Boston, Mass; MetroHealth Medi-\ncal Center, Cleveland, Ohio; Duke Uni-\nversity Medical Center, Durham, NC;\nSt Joseph's Hospital, Marshfield, Wis;\nand the University of California Medi-\ncal Center at Los Angeles. Some pa-\ntients were eligible for the study at the\ntime of admission; others became eli-\ngible as their condition worsened while\nin an intensive care unit. Patients were\nexcluded if they died or were dis-\ncharged within 48 hours of study en-\nrollment; were admitted with a planned\ndischarge within 72 hours; did not\nspeak English; or had the acquired im-\nmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),\nmultiple trauma, or pregnancy. SUP-\nPORT entry criteria and enrollment\nhave been reported in detail else-\nwhere.15 In these analyses, we grouped\npatients with acute respiratory failure\nand patients with multiple organ sys-\ntem failure and sepsis together be-\ncause our previous work had found\nthem to be overlapping categories with\nsimilar prognoses and treatments.16\nHELP enrolled patients 80 years of\nage and older, with any diagnosis ex-\ncept elective surgery, AIDS, or mul-\ntiple trauma, who had an unplanned\nhospitalization for 48 hours or more at\n1 of 4 teaching hospitals (Beth Israel\nHospital, MetroHealth Medical Cen-\nter, St Joseph's Hospital, and the Uni-\nversity of California Medical Center at\nLos Angeles)betweenFebruaryandNo-\neligibility for HELP at the time of hos-\npital admission.\nInstitutional review committees at all\nparticipating hospitals approved the\nstudy. Informed consent was obtained\nprior to interviews.\nData Collection\nThe data collection methods used in\nHELP were identical to those in SUP-\nPORT for the purposes of this analy-\nsis. The following descriptive vari-\nables were recorded from medical\nrecords: diagnoses including comor-\nbid conditions,17 vital signs, common\nlaboratory values, and a clinical assess-\nment of neurological status using the\nGlasgow Coma Scale. We obtained the\ndate of any attempt at CPR (documen-\ntation in the medical record of a call for\nthe CPR team and their having initi-\nated CPR) and the date of death from\nthe record. Disease severity was as-\nsessed using the Acute Physiology, Age,\nChronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)\nPatients and their surrogate decision-\nmakers were interviewed in the first\nweek of entry into SUPPORT or HELP.\nInterview data included demographic\nfactors, perceived quality of life (us-\ning a 5-point scale), and functional sta-\ntus 2 weeks prior to admission using a\nmodified Katz activity of daily living\n(ADL) scale ranging from 1 to 7\npoints.19 Patient interview data were\njects, the surrogate's response was cali-\nbrated to patients' responses and sub-\nstituted as described previously.20 When\nboth patient and surrogate responses\nwere unavailable, we imputed ADL (for\n814 patients) and quality of life values\n(for 868 patients) using a logistic re-\ngression model adjusting for patients'\ninterview status, diagnosis, age, coma\nscore, APS, comorbidities, dementia,\nand sites.20 When we restricted our\nanalysis to patients without imputed\ndata, our results were unchanged; there-\nfore, we present models including im-\nputed data as our primary analysis.\nPreferences about resuscitation were\nassessed with the following question:\n\"As you probably know, there are a\nnumber of things doctors can do to try\nto revive someone whose heart has\nstopped beating, which usually in-\ncludes a machine to help breathing.\nThinking of your current condition,\nwhat would you want your doctor to\ndo if your heart ever stops beating?: (1)\nwould want doctors to try to revive; (2)\nwould want doctors not to try to re-\nvive; (3) would want CPR but no ven-\ntilator; and (4) `don't know'\"(the last 2\nresponses were recorded if the patient\nor surrogate volunteered them). For our\nanalyses, responses 1 and 3 were in-\ncluded as showing a preference for CPR.\nPatients who responded \"don't know\"\nwere also considered as if they had\nstated a preference for CPR, as would\nbe done in clinical practice.

All surrogate inter-\nviews reported here were conducted\nprior to the patient's death. No data\nabout preferences were available for 820\nsubjects (32.7%), either because a sur-\nrogate could not be identified or the pa-\ntient or their surrogate declined to an-\nswer the question.\nIn a separate interview within 5 days\nof enrollment, but prior to patient\ndeath, the most senior physician avail-\nable on the treatment team was asked\nto state the probability (0-100) that the\npatient would live for 2 months or\nmore. Physician interview data were\nStatistical Analysis\nIn this secondary analysis of SUP-\nPORT and HELP data, we identified all\npatients in the SUPPORT and HELP\nstudies who died during their index ad-\nmission and/or received CPR during\ntheir enrollment hospitalization. We\nconsidered CPR to have been pro-\nvided if we found chart documenta-\ntion of CPR on or after the third day af-\nter study admission. Since patients were\nexcluded from SUPPORT if death oc-\ncurred during the first 48 hours of study\nenrollment, we excluded all CPR at-\ntempts tried on the first 2 calendar days\nof study entry.\nPatients were characterized with\ndescriptive statistics. To study the\nbivariable association between CPR\nattempts and patients' characteristics,\nweused 2 teststoanalyzediscretevari-\nables and the Wilcoxon test for con-\ntinuous variables. We used logistic\nregression models to determine which\nfactors were associated with a CPR\nattempt at the time of cardiopulmo-\nnary arrest. Independent variables\nincluded in the model were patient age,\nrace, sex, disease group, preferences for\nCPR, APS on day 3, number of ADL\ndependencies, patient reported qual-\nity of life, physician's estimate of\npatients' 2-month survival, and study\nsite. We used the c statistic as a mea-\nsure of the ability of the model to dis-\ncriminate between those who did and\nthosewhodidnotreceiveaCPRattempt\n(0.5 = no discrimination, 1 = perfect\nused as the criterion for significance. In\na secondary analysis, we added to the\nmodel whether the patient had a DNR\norder prior to cardiopulmonary arrest\nto explore whether variation in DNR\norders explained the variation in CPR\nweobserved,butfoundthatDNRorders\nwere highly collinear with use of CPR,\nresulting in substantial increases in SEs\nand an unstable model. Separately, to\nassess whether secular trends con-\nfounded our results, we also adjusted\nfor year of study entry and results were\nsimilar to our primary analyses.\nRESULTS\nrienced cardiopulmonary arrest, and\nthird study day during their index hos-\npitalization.

Patient or surrogate prefer-\nence to attempt CPR was associated\nwith having CPR, yet 13% of patients\n(or surrogates) who received CPR pre-\nferred to forego CPR, and 38% of pa-\ntients who wanted CPR or were un-\nsure did not receive CPR at the end of\nlife. Patients who had CPR were\nyounger, more often African Ameri-\ncan, and more often male. We found\nsubstantial variation by site and diag-\nnosis. Patients with fewer ADL depen-\ndencies and better APS were more likely\nto receive a CPR attempt.\nOf the 514 patients who received\nCPR on or after day 3 of the study en-\ntry, 15 (3%) had DNR orders written\non or before the day prior to the CPR\nattempt, and 50 had DNR orders writ-\nten on the day of the attempt, while 449\nhad no DNR orders written. Of the 93\npatients who survived CPR, 1 had a\nDNR order written the day of the CPR\nattempt, 8 had DNR orders written sub-\nsequently, and 1 had a DNR order prior\nto the CPR attempt. Of the 421 pa-\ntients who had CPR but died during the\nindex hospitalization, 293 died on the\nsame day of the last CPR attempt, and\n128 lived more than 1 day after the last\nCPR attempt. Among the 293 patients\nwho died on the same day of the last\nCPR attempt, 29 had DNR orders writ-\nten that day. Among the 128 who lived\nmore than 1 day after the last CPR at-\ntempt, 93 had DNR orders written be-\nfore death.\norders in place.

Patients in coma were\nleast likely to have a resuscitative ef-\nfort. Use of CPR varied substantially\nacross sites.

Most patients who\ndied more than 1 day following a CPR\nattempt had a DNR order written prior\nto death. We found that the likelihood\nof attempting resuscitation at the time\nof cardiac or pulmonary arrest varies\nsubstantially with prognosis and pref-\nerences, quality of life, diagnosis, site\nof hospitalization, and patient age, sex,\nand race.\nMostmedicalethicistssuggestthatde-\ncisions about resuscitation should be\nguided by patient preferences and by the\nlikelihood of success of the resuscita-\ntive effort or the patient's prognosis for\nsurvival. In our study, the physician es-\ntimate of 2-month survival and patient\npreference have an important effect on\nuse of CPR, but are similar in magni-\ntude to other variables. Although less\nthan 60% of patients who had DNR or-\nders died during their initial hospital-\nization in SUPPORT,7 similar factors\nwere associated with the timing of DNR\norders among all patients in SUPPORT\nand the use of CPR among patients ex-\nperiencing cardiopulmonary arrest. Pre-\nvious work in SUPPORT identified a\nstrong association between patient pref-\nerences and DNR orders,7 and in our\nstudy, patients with a DNR order gen-\nerally did not receive an attempt at re-\nsuscitation at the end of life. Although\nthere was a strong correlation between\npreferences, DNR orders, and use of\nCPR, 9% of patients who died without\nCPR did not have a DNR order in place.\nOf the 114 patients who died without a\nCPR attempt, DNR order or note, 42 pa-\ntients or their surrogates had ex-\npressed a preference for CPR.\nPatients for whom we had no data\nabout preferences had a rate of CPR at-\ntempt similar to those who preferred\nCPR.

This lack of congru-\nency between preferences and treat-\nment may reflect changes in preferences\nor prognoses in the time between in-\nterviews and cardiopulmonary arrest or\nmisunderstood communication be-\ntween patients and physicians.

In other work, patient prefer-\nences were not associated with the use\nof life-sustaining treatment.24\nOur data show higher rates of CPR\nattempts for patients for whom physi-\ncians felt there was reasonable likeli-\nhood of surviving 2 months. In a re-\ncent study of intensive care unit\npatients, severity of illness (APACHE\nIII score) was the most important vari-\nable associated with a DNR order.25\nConversely, when death is not ex-\npected imminently, physicians may be\nreluctant to forego resuscitation.

Patients with end-stage CHF\nfollow a less predictable course,26,30 and\nthis diagnosis may be a more impor-\ntant influence on the decision to at-\ntempt CPR than the survival progno-\nsis itself. Furthermore, despite a poor\nlong-term prognosis, patients with ad-\nvanced CHF may be quickly resusci-\ntated from an event caused by a car-\ndiac arrhythmia. Physicians may also\nhave different thresholds of perceived\nchance of survival of patients for rec-\nommending CPR for patients with CHF\nor chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-\nease compared with those with can-\ncer.31 The ambiguity in prognosis for\nCHF and the ability of patients with\nCHF to respond well to treatment even\nlate in the course may explain the in-\ncreased use of CPR for patients with\nCHF compared with patients with other\ndiseases included in our study.\nThe patients who received resusci-\ntation attempts did not significantly dif-\nfer in severity of illness (as measured\nby APS) on the third study day or in\nfunctional status 2 weeks earlier, in the\nadjusted analysis, when compared with\nTable 2.

This contrasts with other re-\nports in which more functionally de-\npendent patients received less aggres-\nsive care than others. However, our\nmeasure for functional status may be\ninaccurate, in part, because it was im-\nputed (rather than reported directly by\npatient or surrogate) for one third of our\nsubjects. Alternatively, for the seri-\nously ill patients included in SUP-\nPORT, there may have been less varia-\ntion in functional status compared with\nthose described in other studies. Ad-\nditionally, the strong correlation be-\ntween prognostic estimate and mea-\nsures of disease severity may have\ndampened any possible effect of func-\ntional status and APS on use of CPR in\nour multivariable model. In contrast to\nour findings on functional status, we\nfound that patients were more likely to\nreceive CPR if they reported better qual-\nity of life prior to hospitalization.\nSeveral studies suggest that hospi-\ntalized older persons who are seri-\nously ill have similar rates of short- and\nlong-term success of resuscitation at-\ntempts compared with younger pa-\ntients.32,33 Long-term survival and func-\ntional status were worse after successful\nCPR for individuals older than 70 years\nin another study.34 In our study, older\npatients were less likely to receive CPR,\neven after adjustment for patient pref-\nerences and severity of illness. This ob-\nservation is consistent with other ob-\nservations that suggest that less\naggressive care is provided to older pa-\ntients.35 Less aggressive care for older\npersons may reflect patient and physi-\ncian values.36,37 Other analyses of SUP-\nPORT data found that older seriously\nill patients preferred CPR less often than\ndid younger patients.38 While differ-\ning preferences are not sufficient to ex-\nplain the effect we document, older per-\nsons or their families may be more\nreadily persuaded to avoid CPR as their\nclinical situation worsens.\nAfrican American patients had higher\nrates of attempts at CPR than non\u00ad\nAfrican Americans, even after adjust-\nments for their greater preference for\nCPR. Differing priorities in end-of-life\ncare have previously been observed be-\ntween various cultural and racial\nfects these differences have on deci-\nsions to attempt CPR at the end of life.\nVariation in rates of attempted resus-\ncitation by site suggests that decisions\nto attempt resuscitation are influ-\nenced by the culture of local medical\npractices. The influence of the institu-\ntiononthelikelihoodofattemptingCPR\nwas more powerful than patients' pref-\nerences,whichisdifficulttojustify.Pro-\nfound geographic variation in care for\nthe dying has been demonstrated in\ndecisions about attempting resuscita-\ntion are made in different settings and\nwhat influences guide these decisions\nmay help to identify ways to improve\ncare for the seriously ill.\nThis study has several limitations.\nFirst,ouranalysisfocusesonfactorsasso-\nciated with use of CPR but because we\nrestricted our analysis to the index hos-\npitalization, our data cannot be used to\nestimate the longer-term survival of\npatientsfollowingCPR.Additionally,in\nouranalysis,wedonotaccountforvaria-\ntioninsuccessofCPRindifferentpatient\npopulations or in different institutions,\nnor do we present data on factors asso-\nciatedwithsuccessfulCPR.However,the\nlikelihood of successful CPR is gener-\nally low in hospitalized patients, espe-\ncially in those similar to patients in\nHELP were based in academic referral\nhospitalsandmayhaveattractedpatients\nmore likely to desire aggressive care.\nLimiting our description to those who\nhad successful CPR or died during their\ninitialhospitalizationexcludesinforma-\ntion on outcomes experienced shortly\nafter hospital discharge or in other set-\ntings. Since patients who died or were\ndischarged within the first 48 hours of\nenrollment were excluded, our results\ndonotgeneralizetopatients'entirehos-\npital stay. Since we did not collect data\nontheexacttimeDNRorderswerewrit-\nten,weareunabletotellwhichoccurred\nfirstwhenaCPRattemptandDNRorder\noccurred the same day. However, it is\nlikely that DNR orders were generally\nwritten after CPR attempts when they\noccurred on the same day.\nOur reliance on surrogate re-\nsponses and imputed interview data in\nboth SUPPORT and HELP may intro-\nduce bias. Surrogates may not accu-\nrately understand or predict patients'\npreferences.43 Yet in many clinical set-\ntings, surrogates function in a role of\ndecision maker. Functional status data\nderived by imputing the number of\nfunctional deficits from a logistic re-\ngression model may reduce our ability\nto find differences in functional status\namong patient groups. Finally, our\nanalysis uses data from SUPPORT and\nPractice patterns regarding CPR and\nend-of-life care for seriously ill pa-\ntients may have changed since these\ndata were collected.\nWe found that a CPR attempt was as-\nsociated with patient or surrogate pref-\nerences for CPR and the physician's es-\ntimate of better survival at 2 months.\nHowever, the size of these effects is\nmodest and comparable to the effect of\nother factors. The variation in use of\nCPR across different diagnoses may be\nexplained by variability in the clinical\ncourse of disease and prognostic un-\ncertainty. Patients' race, sex, age, and\nsite of hospitalization, however, had sig-\nnificant effects that are more difficult\nto explain. Future work to improve CPR\ndecision making should include per-\nceptions of CPR effectiveness and seek\nto understand cultural forces in medi-\ncal and lay communities that cause the\nvariations we observed. Additionally,\nsystems to ensure that patients' prefer-\nences are addressed and that DNR or-\nders are written and followed need fur-\nther attention and improvement.\nAuthor Affiliations: Division of Geriatrics, LDS Hos-\npital, Salt Lake City, Utah (Dr Goodlin); Center to Im-\nprove Care of the Dying, George Washington Uni-\nversity, Washington, DC (Drs Zhong and Lynn); Center\nfor Gerontology and Health Care Research, Brown Uni-\nversity, Providence, RI (Dr Teno); Department of Medi-\ncine, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH (Dr\nFago); University of Tennessee, College of Medicine,\nChattanooga Unit, Chattanooga (Dr Desbiens); De-\npartment of Medicine, University of Virginia, Char-\nlottesville (Dr Connors); Department of Medicine, Uni-\nversity of California at Los Angeles (Dr Wenger); and\nDepartment of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medi-\ncal Center, Boston, Mass (Dr Phillips).
