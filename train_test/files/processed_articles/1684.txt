The purpose of this\nstudy was to determine the prevalence of the different combinations of factors that make up the\nmetabolic syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program and to examine\ntheir association with all-cause mortality in younger and older men and women.\nthe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with public-access mortality data\nlinkage (follow-up  14.2  0.2 years) were studied.\nRESULTS -- Metabolic syndrome was present in 26% of younger (aged 65 years) and\n55.0% of older (aged 65 years) participants. The most prevalent metabolic syndrome combi-\nnation was the clustering of high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and elevated blood pressure\nin younger men (4.8%) and triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and elevated waist circumference in\nyounger women (4.2%). The presence of all five metabolic syndrome factors was the most\ncommon metabolic syndrome combination in both older men (8.0%) and women (9.2%).\nVariation existed in how metabolic syndrome combinations were associated with mortality. In\nyounger adults, having all five metabolic syndrome factors was most strongly associated with\nmortality risk, whereas in older men, none of metabolic syndrome combinations were associated\nwith mortality. In older women, having elevated glucose or low HDL as one of the metabolic\nsyndrome components was most strongly associated with mortality risk.\nCONCLUSIONS -- Metabolic syndrome is a heterogeneous entity with age and sex variation\nin component clusters that may have important implications for interpreting the association\nbetween metabolic syndrome and mortality risk. Thus, metabolic syndrome used as a whole may\nmask important differences in assessing health and mortality risk.\nSince the introduction of the meta-\nbolic syndrome operational criteria\nby the National Cholesterol Educa-\nsurveillance of metabolic syndrome has\ngarnered considerable research interest.\nMetabolic syndrome has been shown to\nbe associated with increased all-cause and\ncardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality\nrisk (2,3), but, of late, the clinical utility of\nmetabolic syndrome has also been criti-\ncized (4,5). One of the criticisms is that\nbecause metabolic syndrome is opera-\ntionalized as three or more of the five\ncomponents, the 16 possible combina-\ntions that result may present with differ-\nent pathophysiology, consequences, and\ntreatment options, depending on which\nfactors are present. Indeed, studies that\nhave compared metabolic syndrome clus-\nters for their ability to predict mortality\nhave demonstrated variations in mortality\nrisk among the different metabolic syn-\ndrome operational definitions (6,7) and\nthe different metabolic syndrome clusters\nor components (6,8).\nHowever, it has also been reported\nthat the prevalence of each metabolic syn-\ndrome risk factor differs with sex (9,10),\nand, thus, it follows that men and women\nmay be characterized by different meta-\nbolic syndrome combinations. To date, it\nis unclear whether these sex differences\nare consistent across the life span and\nwhether the different combinations of\nmetabolic syndrome are similarly related\nwith mortality risk in younger and older\nmen and women. Thus, the purpose of\nthis study was to provide U.S. estimates of\nthe prevalence of the different metabolic\nsyndrome combinations and quantify the\nrisk of all-cause mortality for these unique\nmetabolic syndrome phenotypes in\nyounger and older men and women.\nMETHODS -- The Third National\nHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES III) is a nationally representative\ncross-sectional survey conducted between\n2 months. The sample was collected us-\ning a stratified, multistage, probability clus-\nter design.

Blood pressure was manu-\nally measured by a physician at the home\nexamination after the participant had\nbeen quietly seated for 5 min. Metabolic\nsyndrome was diagnosed as three or more\nof the following five factors as defined by\nthe revised NCEP criteria (1): 1) fasting\ntriglycerides 1.69 mmol/l or lipid med-\nications; 2) systolic blood pressure 130\nmmHg, diastolic blood pressure 85\nmmHg, or antihypertensive medications;\n3) fasting plasma glucose 5.6 mmol/l or\ndiabetes medications; 4) HDL cholesterol\n(women); and 5) waist circumference\nStatistical analysis\nAll analyses were stratified by age (18\u00ad65\nyears and 65 years) and sex. Sex differ-\nences in the frequencies and prevalence of\neach metabolic syndrome combination\nwithin each age-group were determined\nusing a 2 test. To account for the poten-\ntial effects of prevalent CVD on mortality\nrisk, participants with a reported history\nof stroke or heart attack were excluded\nfrom the mortality analyses. Cox propor-\ntional hazards regression was used to as-\nsess the relative risk of all-cause mortality\nacross metabolic syndrome definitions,\nadjusting for age, sex, income, smoking\nstatus, white ethnicity, and physical activ-\nity. Because of the low number of deaths\nassociated with some of the definitions,\nthe analyses were only conducted for met-\nabolic syndrome definitions with one,\ntwo, three, four, or all five factors with\neach factor as a required component (i.e.,\nthree metabolic syndrome factors with\none of the factors being elevated glucose,\nfour metabolic syndrome factors with\none of the factors being low HDL cho-\nlesterol, and so on). To account for the\nhierarchical sampling structure of the\ndata, all statistical analyses were per-\nformed using SAS (version 9.1) survey\nprocedures or SUDAAN 10.0, weighted\nto be representative of the U.S. popula-\ntion.

In\nyounger men and women, having all five\nmetabolic syndrome factors was most\nstrongly associated with mortality risk,\nwith no clear association between the\nnumber of metabolic syndrome factors\nand mortality risk (i.e., more metabolic\nsyndrome factors did not equal greater\nmortality risk). In older men, the various\nmetabolic syndrome combinations were\nnot associated with elevated mortality\nrisk, whereas in older women, regardless\nof the absolute number of metabolic\nsyndrome components, having elevated\nglucose or low HDL was most strongly\nassociated with mortality.

This observation suggests\nthat metabolic syndrome is a heteroge-\nneous entity and, when used as a dichoto-\nmous outcome, may mask the differential\nassociations with health risk.\nThe clinical definitions for metabolic\nsyndrome are evolving (15,16), and it is\nclear that the presentation of metabolic\nsyndrome is different between the sexes\nand changes with age. As reported previ-\nously, abdominal obesity is the most com-\nmon metabolic syndrome factor in\nwomen (9). In fact, all combinations that\nwere more common in women than men\ncontained waist circumference, whereas\nthe metabolic syndrome combinations in\nmen were more heterogeneous in their\nmake-up. This finding may suggest a\ngreater relative importance of abdominal\nobesity in the development of metabolic\nrisk in women than men. We have re-\nported previously in this cohort that an-\nthropometric measures of obesity are\nmore strongly associated with mortality\nrisk in women than in men (17).\nAs expected, all metabolic syndrome\nrisk factors were more prevalent in the\nolder than younger adults; however, it\nwas interesting to note that the sex differ-\nences in the prevalence of the various\nmetabolic syndrome factor combinations\nwere largely abolished in older adults. In\ncombinations of metabolic syndrome fac-\ntors were equally prevalent in men and\nwomen possibly because of the large\nnumber of people developing metabolic\nrisk factors by the time they are aged 65\nyears (i.e., prevalence approaching\n100%). However, upon closer inspection,\neven in the older population, less than\nhalf had an abnormal value for most of the\nvariables. Perhaps the diminished sex dif-\nferences in the metabolic risk profile may\nbe in part due to the diminished sex dif-\nferences in total and visceral adiposity\nwith age (18) and the cardiometabolic ef-\nfects of menopause (19).\nMetabolic syndrome is operational-\nized by NCEP for ease of use to be three or\nmore of the five components. However,\nfrom these results, it is clear that the con-\nsequences of the 16 possible combina-\ntions may vary according to which factors\nare present. Variation in the risk of CVD\nmorbidity and mortality associated with\nthe different metabolic syndrome pheno-\ntypes has been described (7,20) and taken\ntogether with our results suggests that im-\nportant variations in mortality risk by\nprevalent clusters of components may be\nmasked when metabolic syndrome is\nused as a whole. Indeed, these results are\nin accordance with a study by Guize et al.\n(6) who reported that different combina-\ntions of metabolic syndrome factors are\ndifferently associated with risk of all-\ncause mortality, wherein the combination\nof waist, triglyceride, and glucose was\nmost strongly associated with all-cause\nmortality. However, this study combined\nmen and women and used participants\nwith no metabolic syndrome factors as the\nreferent group. In the other study to date,\nHong et al. (8) also collapsed their sample\nacross men and women and did not ex-\namine differences with aging, beyond the\ninclusion of age and sex as covariates. In\nthat study, clear differences in mortality\nrisk were demonstrated, along with a\nclustering of blood pressure, triglycer-\nides, HDL, and glucose that was most\nstrongly associated with all-cause mortal-\nity risk. Demographic, covariate, and an-\nalytical differences between these studies\nand the current analysis make it difficult\nto compare but provide some of the first\nevidence that variation in mortality risk\nmay be an important consideration when\none is making treatment decisions on the\nbasis of metabolic syndrome combina-\ntions. Indeed, differences in how the var-\nious metabolic syndrome combinations\nrelate to mortality risk may be in part due\nto the differences in how these metabolic\nsyndrome combinations relate to incident\ncoronary heart disease, CVD, and type 2\ndiabetes morbidity wherein the effects are\nOur results suggest that there are im-\nportant sex and age differences in the way\nthe different metabolic syndrome combina-\ntions relate to mortality risk; however, the\nassociation between the various metabolic\nsyndrome combinations and mortality risk\ndoes not appear to be related to their prev-\nalence. For example, although HDL was\none of the most common metabolic syn-\ndrome components in younger women and\namongtheleastcommoninolderwomen,it\nwas one of the stronger correlates of mortal-\nity risk in both age strata. Furthermore, in\ncontrast with previous observations (22),\nthe association between metabolic syn-\ndromeandmortalityriskdoesnotappearto\nbe related to the number of metabolic syn-\ndrome factors one displays. Although hav-\ning all five metabolic syndrome factors was\nmost strongly associated with mortality risk\nin younger men and women, there was no\nclear association between the number of\nmetabolic syndrome factors and mortality\nrisk. For example, in younger women, hav-\nFigure 3--Variation in the relative risk of all-cause mortality in younger and older men and\nwomen according to metabolic syndrome components. *P  0.05, adjusted for age, income cate-\ngory, smoking status, white ethnicity, and physical activity level.
