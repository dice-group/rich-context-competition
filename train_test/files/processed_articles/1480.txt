Survival information was available for .99% of the subjects after a median follow-\nup of 8.8 years. We divided our sample using sex-specific tertiles of BF%. The highest tertile of BF (.23.1% in\nmen and .33.3% in women) was labelled as NWO. When compared with the low BF group, the prevalence of meta-\nbolic syndrome in subjects with NWO was four-fold higher (16.6 vs. 4.8%, P , 0.0001). Subjects with NWO also had\nhigher prevalence of dyslipidaemia, hypertension (men), and CV disease (women).

Body mass index has shown many advantages as\na surrogate of BF, such as simplicity and reproducibility, and epide-\nmiologic studies have shown an association between extreme\nvalues of BMI and increased mortality.5\u00ad 8 However, a significant\nlimitation of using BMI is its failure to differentiate between an elev-\nated BF content and preserved or increased lean mass, especially in\nAn excess in adiposity has been clearly associated with numer-\nous comorbidies and pathophysiologic processes, including insulin\nresistance, altered lipid metabolism, and endothelial dysfunction.16\nTherefore, the determination of adiposity by methods more\nPublished on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

Briefly, of a sample of 39 695\npeople selected for the NHANES III, 33 994 were interviewed and\n30 818 submitted to an examination by a physician at a mobile exam-\nination centre which included extensive anthropometric, physiological,\nand laboratory testing. For this study, 14 025 adult subjects aged .20\nyears had bioelectrical impedance analysis to estimate body compo-\nsition.21 From those, we selected subjects with blood samples and\nAnthropometric measurements and body\ncomposition analyses\nAll personnel performing NHANES III anthropometric and body com-\nposition measurements were previously trained and followed a strict\nprotocol.21 \u00ad24 Body weight was measured with an electronic load\ncell scale to the nearest 0.01 kg. Participants wore only under-shorts\nand disposable paper shirts, pants and foam slippers. Stature was\nmeasured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a fixed stadiometer. Participants\nwere positioned with heels, buttocks, back, and head against the\nupright surface of the stadiometer with the head positioned in the\nFrankfort horizontal plane. Waist and hip circumference were\nmeasured by a trained examiner and determined using a measuring\ntape positioned at the high point of the iliac crest for the waist and\nat the greatest circumference of the buttocks. The measurement\nwas made with a minimal respiration to the nearest 0.1 cm, with the\ntape snug but not compressing the skin.24 Body mass index was\ncalculated as weight in kilograms divided by squared height in meters\n(kg/m2) and waist-to-hip ratio was calculated as waist circumference\ndivided by hip circumference. Children younger than 12 years of age,\npregnant women and subjects with pacemakers were ineligible for\nbioelectrical impedance analysis. All subjects were requested to\navoid eating or drinking anything except water during the fasting\nperiod. There were no restrictions on physical activity or alcohol con-\nsumption before the fasting period. The prediction equations for total\nbody water and fat free mass use resistance measured with data from\nRJL bioelectrical impedance analyzers (Clinton Twp, MI, USA).25\nNHANES III resistance data were obtained using Valhalla impedance\nanalyzers. Therefore, bioimpedance resistance was converted to RJL\nRes values (V) and was used to calculate BF as previously described\nby Chumlea et al.26 The prediction equations used to estimate lean\nmass are the following:\nwhere S2/Res represent the stature squared divided by resistance\n(cm2/V). We then calculated BF % as follows:\nBF% \u00bc\nweight-lean mass\nweight\nDetailed information on the bioelectrical impedance analysis pro-\ncedure is presented elsewhere.26\nLaboratory measurements\nLipids were measured enzymatically with the use of commercially avail-\nable reagents (Cholesterol/HP, cat. no. 816302, and triglycerides/GPO,\ncat. no. 816370, both from Boehringer Mannheim).

Glucose was measured using standard assay (Sigma\nchemical, St Louis, MO, USA), and plasma insulin was measured with\nthe Pharmacia insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Pharmacia diagnostics,\nSweden). We determined the insulin sensitivity index using the\nupdated computer model homeostatic model assessment (HOMA2)\nindex.27 The apoB and apoAI were measured by radial immunodiffu-\nsion in the first 8.2% of the specimens during the first 5 months of\nthe study and by rate immunonephelometry for the remaining speci-\nmens.28 Serum leptin concentrations were measured by radioimmuno-\nassay at Linco Research, Inc. (St Charles, MO, USA).29 C-reactive\nprotein was measured using a modification of the Behring latex-\nenhanced C-reactive protein assay (Behring Diagnostics, Westwood,\nMA, USA), as previously described.30 Detailed methodology on labora-\ntory procedures of NHANES III is published elsewhere.31\nNormal weight obesity, metabolic syndrome,\nand cardiovascular risk factor definitions\nNormal weight obesity was defined as subjects with a normal BMI\nspecific tertiles of BF% (.23.1% in men and .33.3% in women).\nThe updated ATP-III definition of metabolic syndrome17 was met\nwhen three or more of the following criteria were present: (1) waist\nwomen; (3) triglycerides !1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) or specific treat-\nment for this lipid abnormality; (4) systolic blood pressure!130\nmmHg or diastolic blood pressure !85 mmHg or treatment of pre-\nviously diagnosed hypertension; and (5) fasting glucose !5.5 mmol/L\n(100 mg/dL) or previously diagnosed diabetes.

Overall, 20 024\nadult NHANES III participants were eligible for mortality follow-up\nby linkage with the National Death Index, of whom 3384 were ident-\nified as deceased. A complete description of the methodology used to\nlink NHANES III records to the National Death Index can be found\nelsewhere.36 Cardiovascular deaths were defined as those with\nof follow-up were calculated for each participant based on the end of\nfollow-up (date of death for those assumed deceased or 31 December\n2000, for those assumed alive minus the date of the NHANES III exam-\nination).

We used BF as\na continuous variable for the primary analysis in this study. For second-\nary analyses, we divided our sample of normal BMI subjects into sex-\nin women); medium BF content (second tertile); and high BF content,\ndefined as NWO (.23.1% in men and .33.3% in women). We stra-\ntified all our analyses by sex based on the biologic effect of this variable\non BF. All analyses were adjusted for age and race/ethnicity.\nOnly subjects with fasting and morning samples (n \u00bc 2127) were\nused for analyses of HOMA2, glucose, and metabolic syndrome. We\nperformed log transformation to reduce the skewness of HOMA2, tri-\nglycerides, C-reactive protein, and leptin. We defined subjects as\nhaving an elevated apoB/apoAI ratio, C-reactive protein, and leptin if\nthey were in the upper sex-specific quartile of these measurements.\nWe calculated the prevalence and P-values for trend (adjusted for\nage and race) for metabolic syndrome, CV risk factors, and cardiome-\ntabolic measures between BF groups at baseline. To assess the effects\nof central obesity, we performed similar analyses using sex-specific ter-\ntiles of waist circumference and used the lowest tertile as the refer-\nence combining men and women. After testing the linearity of the\nassociation between BF% and metabolic syndrome, we used logistic\nregression models adjusted for age and race to determine if there\nwas a dose response association between sex-specific quartiles of\nBF% with insulin sensitivity (lowest quartile as the reference). We\napplied Cox proportional hazard regression to estimate relations\nbetween BF% as a continuous variable and sex-specific tertiles of\nBF% with total and CV mortality for men and women (lowest tertile\nused as the reference). Hazard ratios were calculated after adjusting\nfor age and race and smoking (model 1-reference), further adjustment\nfor waist circumference (model 2), waist-to-hip ratio (model 3), and\nfurther adjustment for CV risk factors, namely dyslipidaemia, hyperten-\nsion, diabetes, history of CV disease (model 4). The assumption of\nhazard proportionality was confirmed by examining interactions of sur-\nvival time and timed-dependent variables in Cox models. Finally, to\nassess the generalizability of our results, we compared our selected\npopulation of subjects with normal BMI with body composition ana-\nlyses and blood measurement to subjects in NHANES who did not\nhave these measurements. A two-sided alpha of 0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.

The condition has been previously defined\nbut its prevalence has never been studied in the general popu-\nlation. Results from our study suggest that NWO might be a key\nfactor in the emerging worldwide epidemic of obesity, metabolic\nsyndrome, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.\nOur study shows that NWO is significantly associated with car-\ndiometabolic dysregulation and a high prevalence of metabolic syn-\ndrome, which is in fact, similar to the prevalence of metabolic\nsyndrome described in overweight subjects.38 Additionally, this is\nthe first study showing that in women, NWO is independently\nFigure 1 Risk for lower insulin sensitivity according to body fat percent quartiles (lowest quartile as the reference) in subjects with a normal\nbody mass index.

Romero-Corral et al.\nassociated with an increased risk for CV mortality. These findings\nprovide important insights into understanding obesity--subjects\nwho would otherwise considered non-obese, based on a normal\nBMI, may actually have an excess in BF, and therefore be at\nhigh risk for cardiometabolic dysregulation and CV mortality.\nA normal BMI therefore does not necessarily imply protection\nfrom consequences of increased BF.\nSupporting our current observations, recent studies have\nreported the presence of several metabolic abnormalities in\nwomen with normal BMI with a medium-to-high BF content.\nDe Lorenzo et al.39 reported that 28 women with high BF\n(.30%) had a significantly lower resting metabolic rate and\noxygen consumption, when compared with 20 women with\nnormal BMI and no excess in BF (,30%). Furthermore, in a\nsimilar group of women (n \u00bc 20), De Lorenzo et al.40 noted that\nplasma levels of several inflammatory biomarkers, including\ninterleukins, and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in\nwomen with a normal BMI but high BF content, supporting the\nconcept that subjects with NWO may be predisposed to\ndevelop metabolic syndrome and CV disease.\nBecause bioimpedance does not give information about fat dis-\ntribution, we explored the impact of central obesity in our results\nby performing analyses using sex-specific tertiles of waist circum-\nference. Interestingly, an increased waist circumference (.87 cm\nin men and .82 cm in women) was similarly associated with CV\nrisk as were sex-specific tertiles of BF% (Figure 2A and B). This\nhas important clinical implications because devices for measuring\nBF are not widely available in clinical practice. In contrast, waist cir-\ncumference can be easily and inexpensively measured. However, it\nis important to note that an increased waist circumference was not\nrelated to higher CV mortality as was BF content in subjects with\nNWO and only 2% of men had central obesity according to the\nATP-III criterion. Thus, while central deposition of fat may play a\ncrucial role in cardiometabolic abnormalities,41 \u00ad43 it does not\nfully account for the higher risk for CV mortality noted in subjects\nwith NWO. Furthermore, we found that the higher CV mortality\nnoted in subjects with NWO remained significant, even after\nadjustment for central obesity. Finally, the association between\nNWO and CV mortality persisted in women, even after adjusting\nfor CV risk factors, several of which could be considered inter-\nmediate mechanisms linking NWO and mortality.\nOur study has several potential limitations. First, we used an\narbitrary cut-off for BF% based on tertiles to define NWO. The\nharmful effects of an excess in BF very likely follow a continuum\nrather than a specific threshold for acquiring clinically significant\ncardiometabolic disturbances. Unfortunately, neither the World\nHealth Organization nor any major scientific society involved in\nthe study of obesity has defined a normal value for BF%. We\nbelieve that the use of tertiles to classify those with a relatively\nhigh BF% is more valid than using an arbitrary cut-off not pre-\nviously validated. Second, misclassification could have occurred in\nthis study, as subjects could have had changes in their body com-\nposition during the follow-up period. However, this concern is\ntrue for most epidemiologic studies that only use baseline\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\nTable 4 Metabolic syndrome components, definition, and cardiovascular risk factors in women with a normal body\nmass index by body fat tertiles\nAge1race Padj\n-value\nfor trend\nMetabolic syndrome N (%) N (%) N (%)\nfor hypertension\nHigh fasting plasma glucosea (.5.55 mmol/L)or\npreviously diagnosed diabetes\nCardiovascular risk factors\nP-values adjusted for age and race.\naFasting morning samples.\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\n...............................................................................................................................................................................\nTable 5 Total and cardiovascular mortality in men and women with a normal body mass index by body fat tertiles\nHazard ratio\nHazard ratio\nHazard ratio\nHazard ratio\nModel 1: Adjusted for age, race, and smoking status.\nModel 2: Adjusted age, race, smoking status, and waist circumference.\nModel 3: Adjusted age, race, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, smoking, and waist-to-hip ratio.\nModel 4: Adjusted for age, race, smoking status, waist circumference, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes, and CV disease.\nFigure 2 Comparison of metabolic syndrome components and definition (ATP-III) in subjects with a normal body mass index by sex-specific\ntertiles of body fat (A) and by sex-specific tertiles of waist circumferences (B).\nA.

Third, bioelectrical impedance underestimates upper-body\nobesity, especially in athletes and elderly patients.44 Other more\naccurate methods to estimate BF%, such as hydrostatic weighing\nor dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, may be preferable to esti-\nmate body composition.45 Nevertheless, bioelectrical impedance's\nacceptable accuracy, simplicity, lack of radiation, and relatively low\ncost make it a practical and feasible alternative for measuring body\nfatness, especially in large populations.46,47 Fourth, there were rela-\ntively few CV events at follow-up in our sample, limiting the stat-\nistical power to assess the relationship between NWO and\nmortality. The low rate of events may have occurred because\nour sample of normal weight subjects comprised a relatively\nhealthy, young group, with a mean age of just over 40 years.\nFinally, due to the cross-sectional nature of our analyses linking\nBF content to cardiometabolic dysregulation, we cannot establish\ncausality or directionality between these two factors. However,\nnumerous studies in different settings have shown that increases\nin adiposity worsen most cardiometabolic measures, while adi-\nposity reduction has been related to improvements in most cardi-\nometabolic markers.14,16 Furthermore, there is strong evidence\nshowing an association between metabolic syndrome and CV mor-\ntality, supporting the notion that NWO may increase CV mortality\nby increasing cardiometabolic dysregulation.\nImplications\nBased on the latest US census and obesity prevalence data, we esti-\nmate that NWO is present in 30 million Americans, many of\nwhom may be unaware of their heightened cardiometabolic risk\ndespite their normal BMI. Because self awareness of a condition\nis the initial step in behavioural modification and incorporation of\ntherapeutic lifestyle changes, it might be relevant to incorporate\nBF measurement in the regular physical exam, using simple\nmethods to diagnose NWO in clinical practice. The cardiometa-\nbolic dysregulation found in subjects with NWO, such as insulin\nresistance, altered lipid profile, and metabolic syndrome are poten-\ntially remediable if appropriately treated with diet, exercise, and\npossibly pharmacological therapies.\nConclusions\nNormal weight obesity is associated with significant cardiometa-\nbolic dysregulation, including metabolic syndrome and CV risk\nfactors. Furthermore, NWO appears to be associated indepen-\ndently with increased CV mortality in women. Screening for adi-\nposity in subjects with a normal BMI could better identify those\nat higher risk for cardiometabolic disturbances and CV mortality.\n"
