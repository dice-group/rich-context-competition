As we will show, Ragona-Scina\n` 's observation\nchallenged early theories of color vision and his method for producing it was new for most\nvision researchers.\nFor both his observation and method, Ragona-Scina\n` 's paper was widely cited up to\naround the end of the 19th century, and more sporadically after that. Mausfeld (2003),\nwho made the most recent citation of Ragona-Scina\n` we have found, observed that\ncontrast colors ``are actually still in want of a satisfactory explanation'' (p. 415), a\ntranslation into English exists of Ragona-Scina\ndifficult!) Italian. Here, we give some biographical information about Ragona-Scina\n` , set\nthe paper into its historical and theoretical context, and provide a translation of Ragona-\nScina\nWho Was Ragona-Scina\n`?\nRagona-Scina\n` changed his name in his published papers to Ragona by 1848. We refer to him\nin this paper as Ragona-Scina\n` .\nDomenico Ragona-Scina\nyouth, Ragona-Scina\n` was close to his maternal uncle, Domenico Scina\nWorking Group for the History of Astronomy (WGHA), 1999), an eminent physicist,\nmathematician, and historian (Alberti, n.d.). Scina\n` guided Ragona-Scina\n` into a scientific\ncareer, tutoring him for the last few years of his own life (WGHA).\n` received an undergraduate degree in mathematics and physics from\nthe Royal University of Palermo (Sicily), becoming the third assistant at the Royal\nObservatory of Palermo (ING). In the same year, he was appointed as an adjunct\nprofessor in Physics at the Athenaeum in Palermo, elevating him to second assistant at the\nObservatory.\nIt is tempting to suppose that Ragona-Scina\n` added the Scina\n` part to his family name some\ntime prior to 1847 to honor his uncle, but then returned to his family name, Ragona, when he\nfelt he had discharged his educational and intellectual debt.\n` became director of the Palermo Observatory for 10 years. During\nhis tenure, he brought the astronomical equipment of the observatory up to the cutting edge\n` became director of the\nAstronomical Observatory in Modena (ING), where he dedicated himself to meteorology\nand seismology, and similarly upgraded the extant apparatus for studying meteorology\n` was also partly responsible for founding the Italian\nAlthough Ragona-Scina\n` published extensively in astronomy, meteorology, and seismology\n(ING), our interests are in his contributions to the methods and findings of visual perception.\nHe wrote two papers in 1847 (Ragona-Scina\none in 1873 (Ragona, 1873), all on color vision. His method anticipated that in vision\nresearch of using angled glass for optical superimposition, which found its full flowering\n2 i-Perception\nwith multi-field tachistoscopes. These were popular in vision research from about 1910 to\nabout the 1970s when they were largely supplanted by oscilloscopes and then computer\nWhat Was Ragona-Scina\n`'s Method and What Was His Observation?\nRagona-Scina\n` 's (1847b) method was to look through a colored sheet of glass tilted about 45\nto a horizontal line of sight at a black, filled circle drawn on a vertical white sheet of paper\nwhile at the same time seeing the reflection, from the front surface of the glass, of a similar\nhorizontal white sheet of paper with its own black, filled circle. For example, when Ragona-\nScina\n` used green glass, he saw the black, filled circle on the vertical piece of paper tinted with\nred. The black, filled circle reflected from the horizontal piece of paper, visible near to, but\nnot superimposed on, the filled circle seen through the glass, was tinted with green, because it\nis a mixture of black and green (Ragona, 1859). Ragona-Scina\nremarkable that he could perceive red in the filled circle viewed through the glass when the\nonly light his eyes were receiving from that filled circle was green and white.\nRagona-Scina\n` (1847a) also described another study in which he achieved the same results\nby using a crystal of Island spar--a bi-refringent, polarizing material--to achieve optical\nsuperimposition. Ragona-Scina\ncomplementary colors he was perceiving were a phenomenon of perception, referring to\nthem as ``subjective colors'' (p. 1). Moreover, he gave an explanation of the subjective\ncolors that seems substantially acceptable today: The background of green plus white sets\nFigure 1. Reproduction of an oil painting of Ragona-Scina\nO'Shea et al. 3\na general adaptation level so that an area missing green appears red (p. 3). Ragona (1873)\nemphasized that the reflected circle does not need to be present to experience the\nphenomenon and that its explanation involves processes similar to those producing\ncomplementary-color afterimages.\nWhat Was the Context of Ragona-Scina\n`'s Method?\nThe basic method Ragona-Scina\n` (1847b) used to superimpose two images had already been\nset forth by Giambattista della Porta in 1558 (see Porta, 1658). It was to use a piece of glass to\nreflect an image of an object into the eyes of someone who was also looking directly, through\nthe piece of glass, at some other object. This technique began to be used in the middle of the\n19th century in theatres in England to project ghosts--actually reflections from a large,\nangled, piece of glass of actors portraying ghosts in a side room to the stage--onto the\nmain scene on the stage (Pepper's ghost, 2015).\nInterest in color contrast, particularly in Germany, was stimulated by the observations of\nGoethe (1810) on colored shadows. For example, Brandes (1827) used glass sheets to\ncombine different colored patches by reflection and transmission, as did Osann (1833,\npatches could be observed. We have no evidence that Ragona-Scina\n` was aware of their\nwork because he does not cite them. It seems common in science that academic credit does\nnot necessarily go to the originator of an idea, either by accident (Merton, 1968; Stigler, 1980)\ndepicting Ragona-Scina\n` 's ``apparatus.'' Helmholtz's figure is incorrect in one minor aspect\nand rather misleading in another. The minor error is that Helmholtz showed the eye above\nthe horizontal paper, looking down, instead of to the right, say, of the vertical paper. Of\ncourse this modification will work perfectly well if perhaps not so conveniently for an\nsimilar to Helmholtz's.\nHelmholtz's (1867) and similar figures are misleading because they imply that Ragona-\nScina\n` (1847b) had an actual apparatus, with a piece of glass at exactly 45, allowing very\ncareful positioning of the black, filled circles, whereas there is no such evidence of that in\nRagona-Scina\nresemblance to the one depicted by Helmholtz or to the arrangement Ragona-Scina\n`\ndescribed in 1847. The 1859 apparatus had both filled circles drawn on a single horizontal\nsheet with the glass held in a clamp in front of a viewing tube and relied on reflections from\nthe front and rear surfaces of the glass, a technique used by Brandes (1827) and Dove (1838).\nAs will be evident in our translation, it seems to us that Ragona-Scina\n` simply held the glass in\none hand and tilted it manually.\nRagona-Scina\n` (1873) did finally build an apparatus similar to that illustrated by\nHelmholtz (1867) and used it to superimpose transmitted contrast colors in very close\nproximity to reflected colors, but mainly for the beauty the combined images offered viewers.\nHering (1887) also built an apparatus to provide the horizontal and vertical surfaces, and\nslotted in the colored glass at 45. He replaced the black, filled circles by concentric rings of\nblack and white. The vertical image had the opposite arrangement of blacks and whites from\nthat of the horizontal. This does presuppose accurate construction of the apparatus and of\nthe images, and very careful positioning of the images to ensure that the blacks of one are\n4 i-Perception\noptically superimposed on the whites of the other and vice versa, similar to that achieved by\nRagona-Scina\nfigure (p. 406). This sort of precision anticipates the optical arrangement of multi-field\ntachistoscopes. These were invented by Dodge (1907), who replaced the colored glass with\nsmoked glass.\nOther citations of Ragona-Scina\nproposed an improvement of the method using transmitted light, Breese (1899) who\nsuggested the method could be used for optically superimposing images to produce\nalluded to Hering's development of the method for assessing color blindness, and Parsons\nWhat Was the Context of Ragona-Scina\n`'s Observation?\nGood reviews of the history of other examples of simultaneous color contrast exist including\nby Helmholtz (1867) and by Mollon (2006). Helmholtz pointed out that Leonardo da Vinci,\n`'s method. Here is Southall's translation\nof Helmholtz's description of the figure, ``ab and ac are two white paper surfaces, one horizontal, the other\nvertical; and ad is a colored plate of glass inclined to the two paper surfaces at 45; e and f are two black\nspots. An observer at B, looking down on the apparatus from above, sees the surface ab through the colored\nglass, and the surface ac reflected in it. The image of ac coincides apparently with ab, and the image of the\nblack spot f is at g, say, not far from the spot e.'' (Helmholtz, 1924, p. 283).\nO'Shea et al. 5\nin 1519, was already familiar with the phenomenon in painting. Mollon attributed the first\nreport of complementary colored shadows to von Guericke (1672); Helmholtz cited Rumford\nof contrast colors to Jean-Baptiste Meusnier, who reported it to Monge (1789; for a\ntranslation, see Kuehni, 1997). Helmholtz said that contrast color was carefully studied by\nChevreul (1839) in fabrics, that Dove (1838) observed it with colored glass on metal mirrors,\nand that Meyer (1855) observed it with colored papers.\nHelmholtz (1867) and later authors all accepted the validity of Ragona-Scina\nobservation, presumably because they were able to make it themselves, as were we.\nIn present day visual science, we would say that the region of the retina from which one\nsees the color complementary to the background receives no preponderance of light\nconsisting of wavelengths that would ordinarily appear as the complementarily color. For\nexample, a black, filled circle seen through a green glass does not deliver any long-wavelength\nlight to the retina where the filled circle projects. Nor does the optically superimposed white\nlight present any preponderance of long-wavelength light. So Ragona-Scina\nobservation was a challenge to theories of color vision such as Young's (1804) that color\nis a consequence of wavelength of light.\nMollon (2006) reported that Monge (1789) developed a surprisingly modern theory of\ncolor vision, in which colors arise from the ratios of some then-unknown property of light\nfrom differently colored objects in a scene, and that the observer has to make some judgment\nof the properties of the illumination. This theory was designed to account for four key\nobservations of color vision:\n(1) That a red object looks white when looked at through a red glass.\n(2) That a white object looks white when looked at through a red glass.\n(3) That colored shadows exist.\n(4) That simultaneous color contrast exists.\nAgain, in present day visual science, we would say Monge proposed that the brightest area\nin a scene appears white, even if it is contains a preponderance of a particular range of\nwavelength, say long wavelengths that ordinarily appear red. Other areas containing a\nbalance of all visible wavelengths, which ordinarily appear white must shift their color in a\ndirection complementary to white to maintain the same ratios with it. Monge's emphasis on\nratios anticipated later theories such as Land's retinex theory (e.g., Land, 1977).\nHelmholtz (1867) was unaware of Monge's theory and developed his own. He proposed a\nphysiological explanation residing in the retina and a higher-level psychological explanation.\nThe physiological explanation is now known as trichromatic theory, involving ratios of\nactivities among three receptors in the eye; it does not require any inference, conscious, or\nunconscious (Hurvich & Jameson, 1969). Helmholtz (1867) conceded that trichromatic\ntheory was unable to explain Ragona-Scina\n` 's (1847b) observation or other examples of\nsimultaneous color contrast (see later). The psychological explanation is known as\nunconscious inference, or to use Helmholtz's words, an error, or an illusion. For example,\nhe proposed that the green background suggests to the observer that the spot is illuminated\nby greenish light. Under such an illuminant, Helmholtz said, the observer makes the\nunconscious inference that a dark greenish spot must have arisen from a dark pink spot\nand that is what is perceived. This sort of thinking anticipates modern approaches to color\nconstancy (e.g., Foster, 2011) and the effects of experience and judgment on perception (e.g.,\nAsch, 1956). It is certainly true that judgment plays a part in making any phenomenological\nobservation and its role is still a matter of debate (e.g., Gilchrist, 2015).\n6 i-Perception\nHering (1887) reported a series of careful experiments addressing Helmholtz's explanation.\nFor example, he showed that the contrast colors are visible even when the observer is\nunaware he is looking through colored glass. Hering (1890) also had observers look at a\ndark spot on a white background with red glass over one eye and with blue glass over the\nother. Although this yielded a purple background via binocular combination of colors, when\nobservers crossed their eyes, they saw two dark spots, one tinted with cyan and the other with\norange, thereby ruling out any unconscious inference from illumination, which should have\nmade the spots appear yellow.\nHering (1887) offered a physiological explanation of contrast colors involving reciprocal\ninhibition between neighboring regions of the retina. This was a notion of almost uncanny\nprescience, because the discovery of retinal ganglion cells having receptive fields responsive to\nlight and dark in center and surround regions (Kuffler, 1953) and the discovery of lateral\ngeniculate nucleus cells having receptive fields responsive to complementary colors in center\nand surround regions (De Valois, Smith, Kitai, & Karoly, 1958) did not emerge until the\nfollowing century.\nAny full explanation of the phenomenology of simultaneous color contrast will likely\ninvolve a rapprochement between bottom-up, physiological explanations and top-down,\nThe Translation\n`\n(Communicated by the author.)\nDear Mr. Cirelli.\nI send a brief account of a pretty phenomenon I observed in the past few days, and of\nwhich I cannot find any report by physicists.\nDraw two, equal, black, filled circles on two, white pieces of paper, then arrange the two\npapers at right angles, the first in a horizontal plane and the second in a vertical plane.\nLook at the black circle of the vertical paper through a glass of any color. When the glass\nis parallel to the vertical paper, the circle is seen perfectly black on a background of the\nsame color as the glass. Slightly tilting the glass, and placing its lower part closer to the\nvertical card, and the upper part nearer to the eye, the circle continues to be black. But, by\ntilting the glass more, at a certain point, the horizontal paper reflected on the glass is\nprojected onto the vertical paper. Then a sudden metamorphosis occurs, as the\ntransmitted circle of the vertical paper changes its black to a very distinct color\ncomplementary to that of the glass. Simultaneously, the vertical paper, which was tinted\nthe same color as the glass, becomes white from the superimposed reflection of the card.\nThe reflected circle is always seen tinted the same color as the glass. That is, if the glass is\ntilted so that the two circles, the reflected one and the transmitted one, appear aligned next\nto each other on the opposite background, the reflected circle is seen as the same color as\nthe glass, and the transmitted circle as the complementary color, on a white background. If,\nfor example, a green glass is used, the reflected circle will be seen as green, and the\ntransmitted circle as red; if a blue glass is used, the reflected circle will be seen as blue,\nand the transmitted circle as yellow, etc.\nO'Shea et al. 7\nThus, a white surface transmitted by a colored glass coinciding in the same place with a\nwhite reflected surface is seen as white; a black circle on a white background transmitted by a\ncolored glass coinciding with a white reflected surface is seen tinted with the color\ncomplementary to that of the glass; a black circle on a white background reflected by a\ncolored glass coinciding with a transmitted white surface is seen tinted with the same color\nas the glass. The experience can be produced in different ways, and it is always very enjoyable.\nThe complementary-colored circle has a beautiful appearance when light is shone onto the\ntransmitted paper from a conveniently located lamp. It brings wonder to note that these two\ncircles, the reflected one and the transmitted one, which fall next to each other on the\nopposite backgrounds, have the same appearance, one (colored like the glass) and the\nother (colored like the complementary color). I have been the first to observe the following\nfacts, part of which I have published the data, which can be verified by anyone, by moving a\ncolored glass under a large crystal of Iceland spar through which a black circle can be seen on\na white background.\n1. In the superimposed, homologous images of the circle and glass, the circle is seen tinted\nwith the color complementary to that of the glass, against a white background.\n2. When superimposing opposite images, the circle is seen tinted with the same color of the\nglass against a white background.\n3. When superimposing opposite images, the more intense the color of the glass, the blacker\nthe circle appears and the less it shares the color of the glass.\n4. The more intense the glass, the weaker is the circle tinted with the complementary color in\nthe superimposed homologous images.\n5. At a certain degree of intensity of the glass,1 in the coincidence of the homologous images,\nthe circle becomes completely invisible, that is, at a certain degree of intensity, the colored\nglass acts completely as an opaque body would in similar circumstances.\n6. This degree of intensity for the same circle is relative to the darkness of the color of the\nglass, and for the same glass is relative to its distance from the paper bearing the circle, and to\nthe intensity of the latter.2\n7. By moving a black piece of cardboard in the opposite direction from the colored glass, the\ncircle tinted with the complementary color in the white background becomes black on the\nbackground of the same color of the glass; and when the intensity of the glass is such as to\nrender the circle totally invisible in the superimposition of the homologous images, the black\ncircle reappears completely distinct and equally black on the background colored like the\nglass.\n8. By moving not a black cardboard, but another colored glass in the opposite direction, a\ncircle tinted by the complementary color appears the same color as that of the second\nglass, albeit not generally, but always within the intensity relationships between the two\nglasses, relationships that produce in this case variable and beautiful appearances,\netc., etc.\nEqually it is observed in the experience we are talking about, that the more intense the\nglass, the weaker and duller is the transmitted circle tinted with the complementary color\nof the reflected paper, and the darker is the reflected colored circle with the same color of the\ntransmitted paper; that at a certain degree of intensity of the glass the transmitted circle\ndisappears altogether when its color is the same of the reflected paper, while the reflected\ncircle is completely black; that moving a black cardboard onto the horizontal paper, the\ncomplementary circle becomes black on the background of the same color of the glass, or\nreappears when it was invisible: a very simple effect, because the black cardboard intercepts\nthe reflected paper that coincides with the transmitted one. There is perfect correspondence in\nappearances arising from a colored glass, instead of a black cardboard. To give an idea of\n8 i-Perception\nthis, I include the following table. The first column gives the color of the glass that moves\nover the horizontal paper, the second column the tint that is assumed by this glass when seen\nby its reflection and projected onto the transmitted paper (vertical), the third column the tint\nthat it is assumed by the transmitted circle when superimposed on the reflected,\ncomplementary-colored paper and on this glass.\nWhen keeping a green glass in front of the eye\nRed . . . Green . . . Black\nOrange . . . Yellow . . . Reddish purple\nBlue . . . Green-blue . . . Dark blue.\nWhen keeping a blue glass in front of the eye\nPale yellow . . . Reddish . . . Saturated yellow\nRed . . . Saturated blue . . . Black\nGreen . . . Dark green . . . Pale green.\nBy moving these glasses under a large crystal of Iceland spar in the opposite direction, it\nis observed that there is a full match of appearances. For example, if a green glass is moving\nfrom the right to the left side, the image of the right side of the black circle will be seen as\ngreen, and the left side as red; therefore, by moving an orange glass from the left side to the\nright, the red image becomes purple, and the two images will be seen on a yellow\nbackground.\nIn the experience I am talking about, the image tinted with the complementary color,\nwhich in principle is easy to see, also becomes much weaker as the glass is tilted more, and\nfinally disappears at some tilt, depending on whether the glass is more or less intense. When it\nhas disappeared, it can be made to reappear by means of a black cardboard or of another\ncolored glass. This disappearance is perhaps dependent upon the intensity of the reflected\nwhite surface onto which the transmitted circle is superimposed which becomes more\nintense with the greater obliquity of superimposition. If you look at the transmitted\ncircle through a good bi-refringent prism, two circles tinted with the complementary\ncolor of the glass can be seen; however, tilting the glass, they do not disappear\nsimultaneously, even when the main section of the prism is horizontal; but first one\ndisappears, and after a sufficient interval the other image disappears too. This interval\nbetween the two disappearances perhaps depends on polarization by refraction, which\nthe transmitted circle assumes relative to the tilt.\nTrust me\nYour affectionate friend\nD. Ragona-Scina\n`\nConclusion\nWe have provided a brief biography of Domenico Ragona-Scina\nhis method for making observations of simultaneous color contrast (Ragona-Scina\n` ,\n1847b), set them into their historical and theoretical contexts, and provided a\ntranslation of the paper. We hope this will prevent errors from being propagated by\nauthors who rely on secondary sources and spark renewed interest in this unexplained\nphenomenon.\nO'Shea et al. 9\n"
