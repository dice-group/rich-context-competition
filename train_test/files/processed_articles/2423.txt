We developed a fast, easy and\nreliable method of assessing olfactory thresholds, and used it in the first study of olfactory\nsensitivity in a nationally representative sample of U.S. home-dwelling older adults. We vali-\ndated our method via computer simulation together with a model estimated from 590 nor-\nmosmics. Simulated subjects were assigned n-butanol thresholds drawn from the\nestimated normosmic distribution and based on these and the model, we simulated admin-\nistration of both the staircase and constant stimuli methods. Our results replicate both the\ncorrelation between the two methods and their reliability as previously reported by studies\nusing human subjects. Further simulations evaluated the reliability of different constant sti-\nmuli protocols, varying both the range of dilutions and number of stimuli (6\u00ad16). Six appro-\npriately chosen dilutions were sufficient for good reliability (0.67) in normosmic subjects.\nFinally, we applied our method to design a 5-minute, in-home assessment of older adults\n(National Social Life, Health and Aging Project, or NSHAP), which had comparable reliabili-\nty (0.56), despite many subjects having estimated thresholds above the strongest dilution.\nThus, testing with a fast, 6-item constant stimuli protocol is informative, and permits olfacto-\nry testing in previously inaccessible research settings.\n",

The time re-\nquired to administer the threshold test depends on a subject's performance and may be pro-\nlonged, particularly for those with olfactory dysfunction. In particular, population-based\nepidemiological studies--often conducted in the home by interviewers without specialized\ntraining in administering psychophysical measures--impose constraints of time and resources\nthat preclude the use of gold-standard measures of olfactory assessment such as the\nstaircase method.\nSuccessful efforts to shorten the Sniffin' Sticks olfactory sensitivity protocol using the meth-\nod of constant stimuli [4] have been made [5,6]. While these methods have advanced the field\nof olfactory testing, they still require presentation of at least 16 dilutions and are therefore not\npractical in most field or survey settings due to time constraints and both subject and\ninterviewer burden.\nSniffin' Sticks Threshold Test\nThe Sniffin' Sticks threshold test involves 16 distinct dilutions administered using the staircase\nmethod. The test begins at one of the two weakest dilutions (pen 15 or 16), chosen randomly.\nDuring each presentation three felt tip pens are offered to the subject: one pen contains the tar-\nget odor (a specific dilution of n-butanol) while the other two are blank, with the relative posi-\ntion of the target rotated with each presentation. Subjects are asked to indicate which of the\nthree pens contains the target odor. Each time a subject correctly detects the odor at a given di-\nlution, that same dilution is presented a second time in case the original correct response was\ndue to chance alone (as expected at least one third of the time). Following a second consecutive\ncorrect response at a given dilution, the test is made more difficult by presenting a weaker dilu-\ntion that is half the strength of the previous one. If at any point the subject gives an incorrect re-\nsponse, the test is made easier and a stronger dilution that is twice the strength of the previous\nis presented. Each change from weaker to stronger or stronger to weaker is considered a \"rever-\nsal.\" The Sniffin' Sticks staircase protocol is administered until 7 reversals are observed. The di-\nlutions presented at each of the last 4 reversals are then averaged to estimate that subject's\nthreshold [1,3] (hereafter referred to as the staircase-estimated threshold). This method is ac-\ncurate and reliable for subjects whose thresholds fall within the range of dilutions used, but\nalso time and labor intensive which is prohibitive in many settings.\nStaircase Method vs. Method of Constant Stimuli\nThe staircase method is dynamic, requiring the experimenter (or interviewer) to modify which\ndilutions are presented based on the subject's previous responses, and similar to other psycho-\nphysical methods relies on the subject's response history to determine when the procedure\nends [1,3,7,8]. Although yielding a reliable threshold estimate, the method is relatively complex\nand requires significant time (up to 20 minutes) and training to administer [1].\nIn contrast, the method of constant stimuli uses a fixed number of presentations. Each sub-\nject receives the same set of stimuli, though their order may be varied between subjects (ideally\nin a random manner) to avoid bias due to possible order effects. While this method is typically\nless efficient than adaptive methods (which administer a higher proportion of stimuli near\neach specific subject's threshold), it is considerably easier to administer and, unlike the staircase\nmethod, administers the same total number of stimuli to each subject.\nL\u00f6tsch and colleagues [6] demonstrated that thresholds obtained using the method of con-\nstant stimuli with 16 dilutions are strongly correlated with those obtained using the staircase\nmethod (r = 0.84). Further, the method of constant stimuli exhibited similarly good test-retest\nreliability (0.79 versus 0.82 for staircase).

To the same 100 subjects, they also adminis-\ntered a constant stimuli version of the threshold test using 16 dilutions. Each dilution was\nadministered once in random order, and the threshold (defined as the dilution yielding a cor-\nrect response probability of 2\n) was estimated separately for each subject using an Item-response\nTheory (IRT) model (described below).\nL\u00f6tsch et al. demonstrated that the method of constant stimuli can be applied to olfaction\nthreshold testing yielding reliable validated data. Although shorter than the staircase method,\ntesting 16 dilutions still requires the presentation of 48 separate pens (16 targets and 32 blanks).\nSee also Wise et al. [9] who investigate two alternative methods for reducing the time required\nto measure olfactory sensitivity, both of which still require a relatively large total number\nof stimuli.\nStudy Overview\nOur goal was to design a shorter, easier olfactory threshold test suitable for survey studies and\nyet accurate and reliable enough for scientific research. Such a test would permit incorporating\nolfactory threshold assessment into existing large, population-based studies, thereby allowing\nolfaction research among both the general population and previously understudied subpopula-\ntions, as well as interdisciplinary research on the relationships between olfactory function and\nphysical and mental health. We accomplished this goal in three steps: (1) We developed an IRT\nmodel for estimating olfactory thresholds using data from either the staircase or constant sti-\nmuli protocols, and validated it using previously collected staircase data from 590 normosmics;\n(2) We used computer simulations based on the model to replicate the results of a previous\nstudy in human subjects comparing staircase and constant stimuli protocols, and to examine\nthe effects of reducing the number of constant stimuli (dilutions) used; and (3) We developed\nand administered a 6-dilution constant stimuli protocol to a representative sample of the\nhome-dwelling, older adult population of the United States, and used the simulation-based\nmethod in (2) to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the resulting data.\nMethods\nItem Response Theory (IRT) model\nAs described above, the staircase method is usually scored by averaging the dilutions corre-\nsponding to the last four reversals to estimate an individual's true underlying threshold--an\napproach not available following the administration of constant stimuli. An alternative ap-\nproach, applicable to data from either the staircase or constant stimuli method, is to fit a statis-\ntical model to the data from which an estimate of the true underlying threshold may be\nobtained. When used with staircase data, this approach is more efficient because it uses a sub-\nject's entire response history (instead of just the last four reversals) to estimate his or\nher threshold.\nA common model for such data is a logistic IRT model in which the probability of correctly\nidentifying the odorant pen increases monotonically with increasing concentration, from a\nlower asymptote of 1\n(for concentrations that are undetectable by the subject and therefore\nequally likely to be selected as each of the two blank pens) to an upper asymptote of one (for\nconcentrations that are always detected). This model may be written as\nij\n\u00fe\ni\n\u00c0 bd\nij\nOlfactory Thresholds of U.S. Older Adults: Development and Validation\nwhere Yij\ndenotes the response (1 for correct or 0 for incorrect) by the ith subject for the jth\npresentation with dilution step dij\n,  is a slope parameter describing the rate at which the prob-\nability of a correct response decreases with increasing dilution, i\nis a subject-specific intercept\ndescribing the subject's underlying olfactory ability, and Logit-1() is the inverse logistic func-\ntion. For the Sniffin' Sticks threshold test, dij\n1.22 ppm). The model may be fit separately to each subject's data (as in [6]) or simultaneously\nto the data from multiple subjects. The latter involves modeling the parameters i\nas drawn\nfrom an underlying probability distribution (typically taken to be the Normal distribution); the\nresulting model is known as a Generalized Linear Latent and Mixed Model (GLLAMM) [10].\nIn the analyses reported below, this model was fit in Stata release 13 [11] using the gllamm\nSetting P(Yij\nin Equation (1) and solving for dij\nyields i\n/ , which corresponds to\nthe threshold for subject i. Thus, threshold estimates can be obtained after fitting the model by\nusing estimates of each individual's underlying olfactory ability (\n^\ni\n) (obtained, for example, via\nempirical Bayes methods) and the estimated slope (\n^). These model-estimated thresholds repre-\nsent the point on the dilution-response curve corresponding to a 2\nprobability of a correct re-\nsponse, and are therefore comparable to the staircase-estimated threshold, which estimates the\nsame point on the dilution-response curve by taking the average of the last four reversals.\nWe fit the GLLAMM model described above to previously collected n-butanol Sniffin' Sticks\nthreshold data obtained via the staircase method from 590 normosmic subjects (all of whom\nwere tested at the ENT-Department of the TU Dresden) [13]. Normosmic subjects were identi-\nfied based on a cumulative \"TDI score,\" a summation of the scores of the Threshold task, a De-\ntection task, and an Identification task [14].\nExamining the Properties of Alternative Protocols Using Computer\nSimulation\nL\u00f6tsch et al. [6] demonstrated that constant stimuli administration of 16 dilutions may be used\nto shorten and simplify the assessment of olfactory threshold and still achieve high reliability,\nwhich raises several additional questions. Among these are: (1) Can the instrument be short-\nened further, for use in settings with stringent time and/or other constraints; (2) Given a fixed\n(possibly smaller) number of stimuli, what is the optimal subset of dilutions to choose relative\nto the distribution of olfactory abilities in the population being studied; and (3) Can one esti-\nmate the reliability of a given constant stimuli protocol without conducting a separate human\nsubjects validation study?\nTo answer these questions, we developed software for simulating the administration of both\nthe staircase method and the method of constant stimuli to a sample of virtual subjects with ol-\nfactory abilities drawn from a specified distribution. By using a distribution chosen to match\nthat of a target population (ideally estimated from previously collected data or from the exist-\ning literature) and by varying the number and dilutions of the stimuli used, we can evaluate\nand compare the measurement properties of several constant stimuli designs. This procedure\ncan thus be used both to design a new study and to evaluate the properties of protocols used in\nprevious studies.\nApplication to a Population-Based Study of Aging\nThe National Social Life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP) is a U.S. national longitudinal\nstudy of health and aging, with baseline data collected from a probability sample of 3,005 adults\nOlfactory Thresholds of U.S. Older Adults: Development and Validation\napproved by the Institutional Review Boards of The University of Chicago and the National\nOpinion Research Center (NORC); all respondents provided written, informed consent. The\nweighted distributions of demographic variables in the NSHAP sample closely match those\nfrom the U.S. 2002 Current Population Survey, confirming that the NSHAP sample is repre-\nsentative of the U.S. population of home-dwelling, older adults [15].\nOdor identification was measured in Wave 1 [16,17]. At Wave 2 we again measured odor\nidentification and added a threshold measurement to permit the first ever estimates of olfactory\nthreshold for this population. Unfortunately, the omnibus nature of the study which includes a\nlengthy questionnaire, several physiological measurements and collection of several biological\nsamples, all conducted in the home, precluded use of the staircase method. Specifically, the\nstudy did not allow the time required for the interviewers--who did not have training or expe-\nrience in the administration of psychophysical measurements--to administer the staircase\nmethod or even a 16-dilution constant stimuli protocol, both of which would have exceeded\nthe 5 minutes available. Further, the interviewers were limited in their ability to transport addi-\ntional supplies to respondents' homes, given all of the other materials necessary to complete\nthe interview. Thus, we had to develop a shorter and simpler method of olfactory threshold\nthat reduced both interviewer and respondent burden.\nNSHAP Threshold Protocol\nAlthough there were no existing data on olfactory sensitivity in the U.S. population of older\nadults, based on previous threshold testing in this age group [13,18] and results from the odor\nidentification data in Wave 1, we anticipated that the distribution of thresholds would have a\nconsiderably lower mean than for younger adults. Thus, we selected the following 6 dilutions\nand 8.0%, which correspond to dilution steps 6, 5, 4, 2, 1 and 0 in the Sniffin' Sticks threshold\ntest. Although pen 1 (4% n-butanol) is the strongest dilution used as part of the Sniffin' Sticks\nthreshold test, given the expected prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in NSHAP's older adult\npopulation, we added the 8% n-butanol pen (pen 0) into our protocol to enhance our ability to\ndiscriminate among those with dysfunction.\nThese target dilutions were each administered along with two additional blank pens, in\norder of increasing concentration (from pen 6 to pen 0) to minimize the possibility that a rela-\ntively strong concentration might subsequently make it more difficult to detect a weaker con-\ncentration (habituation) [19]. The position of the target pen as either the first, second, or third\npen for a given presentation was varied across the six presentations, but uniform for all respon-\ndents. Although randomizing both the order in which the dilutions were administered and the\nposition of the target pen would have been ideal, this additional complexity would have in-\ncreased the time and the risk of administration error.\nUnlike clinical or laboratory settings, in order to maintain cooperation and a good rapport\nthroughout the interview, respondents in survey studies are typically permitted to refuse to an-\nswer any question, or to respond by indicating that they don't know. Thus, although NSHAP\ninterviewers were instructed to encourage respondents to do their best to select a pen even if\nthey were not sure which was the target, some respondents still insisted that they didn't know\nor refused to answer. Not surprisingly, such responses were more common at the weakest con-\ncentrations. Treating such responses as incorrect would create a negative bias in the threshold\nestimates, since had these respondents guessed, they would have been correct at least one-third\nof the time by chance. Thus, in order to obtain a more accurate estimate of the threshold distri-\nbution for use in the work described below, we used multiple imputation with an imputation\nOlfactory Thresholds of U.S. Older Adults: Development and Validation\nmodel which specified that the probability of a correct response in these cases was 1\napproach could also be used when generating estimates of individual thresholds.\nResults\nValidation of IRT Model Among Normosmics\nAmong the normosmic sample, the estimated slope parameter () was 1.12 (SE = 0.06), and\nthe mean and variance of the i\ntively. Fig. 1A shows a histogram of the 590 staircase-estimated thresholds determined from\nthe average of the last four reversals, together with a Normal density curve with the same mean\nand standard deviation (solid black). In addition, the distribution of thresholds (obtained by di-\nviding i\nby \n^) estimated from the IRT model is also plotted (grey dashed). The means of the\ntwo distributions are nearly identical, demonstrating excellent correspondence between the\nmodel-estimated thresholds and threshold estimates obtained using the staircase method,\nthereby validating the model. As expected, the variance of the model-estimated distribution is\nslightly greater, because the staircase method does not permit threshold estimates outside of\nthe range of dilutions administered (1\u00ad16).\nFig. 1B shows a Bland-Altman plot [21] comparing the two sets of estimates (difference be-\ntween staircase-estimated and model-estimated thresholds versus the model-estimated thresh-\nold) together with a LOWESS smoother. For those in the middle 50% of the model-estimated\nthreshold distribution (7.0\u00ad11.2), the average difference between staircase and model-estimat-\ned thresholds is only 0.16 with a standard deviation of 0.80, reflecting a relatively close corre-\nspondence between the two measures despite a small, positive bias in the staircase estimates.\nFig 1. Histogram and Bland-Altman plot. A. Histogram of 590 normosmic staircase-estimated thresholds (as determined by the mean of the last 4\nreversals), together with a normal density curve with the same mean and standard deviation (solid black). In addition, the distribution of estimated thresholds\nfrom the fitted model is also plotted (dashed grey).B. Corresponding Bland-Altman plot comparing staircase-estimated thresholds and model-estimated\nthresholds among the 590 normosmics together with a LOWESS smoother.\nOlfactory Thresholds of U.S. Older Adults: Development and Validation\nAt the high end of the distribution of model-estimated thresholds where the odorant con-\ncentrations are weakest, the staircase estimates demonstrate a clear negative bias. This is due to\nthe fact that the maximum possible value of the staircase estimates is 16, even among those\nwhose true threshold may be even higher. In contrast, at the low end of the distribution where\nthe odorant concentrations are strongest, the staircase-estimated thresholds exhibit a positive\nbias. This is due to the fact that the staircase protocol begins at the weak end of the dilutions\nand works its way toward the strong end; erroneous reversals early on to a weaker dilution (re-\nversing to a weaker dilution despite having a true threshold at a stronger dilution) can then re-\nsult in a misleadingly weak dilution being included when computing the staircase-\nestimated threshold.\nReplicating L\u00f6tsch et al.\nTo demonstrate that our computer simulation method yields similar results to those from a\nstudy using human subjects, we used our method to replicate the results of L\u00f6tsch et al. [6]. Fol-\nlowing their protocol, we simulated the administration of both the staircase and constant sti-\nmuli methods with 16 dilutions to 100 subjects. Although L\u00f6tsch et al. utilized a general sample\nof adults including both normosmics and those with olfactory dysfunction (approximately\n18%), their publication did not report an overall mean and standard deviation of the estimated\nthresholds, and thus we drew abilities for our simulated subjects from the distribution of abili-\nties estimated from the 590 normosmics described above. Given these abilities, responses were\nthen simulated from the model above using the estimated value of 1.12 for . Five hundred rep-\nlications were performed, each with a sample of 100 subjects.\nOur simulations yielded mean reliabilities for the staircase and constant stimuli methods of\n0.86 (not shown) and 0.84 (Table 1), respectively, only slightly higher than the test-retest\nTable 1. Reliability of several constant stimuli protocols based on simulated administration to the 590 normosmic distribution, n = 100 subjects\naThis configuration presents the identical 6 dilutions used for a given protocol twice for a total of 12 stimuli\nbA configuration using 8 odd dilutions yielded similar results\ncSE = standard error\ndNA = not applicable.\nOlfactory Thresholds of U.S. Older Adults: Development and Validation\nreliabilities reported by L\u00f6tsch et al. of 0.82 and 0.79, and nearly identical to results reported by\nHaehner at al. [22] who estimated a test-retest reliability of 0.85 for the staircase method when\nadministered to human subjects. In addition, the mean correlation between the staircase and\nconstant stimuli methods was 0.86, as compared to 0.84 for L\u00f6tsch et al. Of note, L\u00f6tsch et al.'s\nreliability estimates were based on a single sample of 100 subjects, and may therefore reflect\nsome random variation (compare the sampling variability represented by the 5th and 95th per-\ncentiles of the reliability distributions reported in Table 1) as opposed to our estimates obtained\nby averaging the results from 500 independent replications.\nOur reliability estimates may also be slightly higher than their test-retest reliability estimates\ndue to one or more of the following: (1) variability across days in both the administrator and\nthe subject that is not captured in our simulation (though prior work has shown that the Snif-\nfin' Sticks are reliable with repeated testing and across days [23]), (2) possible variation in effec-\ntive pen concentrations with repeated use, also not captured in our simulation (though a recent\npublication [24] has demonstrated that this effect is relatively small), and (3) potential differ-\nences in reliability between PEA and n-butanol (though a publication by Croy et al. [25] sug-\ngests that these odors exhibit similar reliability). In light of these differences, our results are\nquite consistent with those of L\u00f6tsch et al., demonstrating the ability of our method to repro-\nduce reliability estimates from studies of human subjects.\nReducing the Number of Stimuli\nNext, we used our method to examine the effects of reducing the number of stimuli and of the\nchoice of dilutions relative to the threshold distribution of the population. We evaluated de-\nsigns using 12, 8, and 6 stimuli, carefully selecting their dilutions to cover the range of thresh-\nolds, as well as targeting specific areas of the distribution. Like before, a sample size of 100\nsubjects with 500 replications was used.\nAs expected, reducing the number of stimuli reduced the reliability from 0.79 for 12 evenly\ndistributed dilutions down to 0.65 for only 6 dilutions (Table 1). This was due entirely to reduc-\ning the number of stimuli presented (as opposed to reducing the number of distinct dilutions),\nsince presenting 6 dilutions each twice (12 stimuli total) yielded nearly identical reliability\n(0.81) as 12 distinct dilutions. Interestingly, the reliability is relatively robust to differences in\nthe selection of dilutions, such as using a smaller range of dilutions under the center of the abil-\nity distribution or shifting the dilutions to one end of the distribution. Only the scenario in\nwhich the dilutions were located exclusively at the tails of the distribution (with none in the\ncenter) yielded a significant decrease in reliability.\nAlthough data from 16 dilutions can be analyzed by fitting the model separately to each sub-\nject's data (as done by L\u00f6tsch et al.), a smaller number of dilutions requires using a random effects\nmodel as we have done here. Still, as seen in Table 1, we were unable to obtain threshold estimates\nin a substantial fraction of replications when using 8 or fewer stimuli, due to the model's failure\nto converge. This problem was nearly eliminated in all but one case (Tails) by moving to a sample\nsize of 1,000 subjects (Table 2). Similar convergence problems could be avoided in smaller studies\nby using Bayesian methods to fit the model, ideally basing the priors on existing data [26].\nA plot showing the relationship between the model-estimated threshold and the true thresh-\nold for a single replication (n = 100) of both the full 16-dilution design and the 6-dilution de-\nsign (with dilutions evenly distributed over the range of dilutions) is shown in Fig. 2 (Panels A\nand C). Corresponding Bland-Altman plots (model-estimated threshold minus true threshold\nplotted versus true threshold) depicting the difference between the model-estimated and true\nthreshold together with a LOWESS smoother are also shown in Fig. 2 (Panels B and D). The\ncorrelation between the model-estimated and true thresholds for the 6-dilution design is 0.78\nOlfactory Thresholds of U.S. Older Adults: Development and Validation\nfor this replication, only slightly below the average of 0.81 across all replications. The biggest\ndifference between the two designs is the conditional bias (i.e., conditional on the true thresh-\nold) for the 6-dilution design, which increases toward the tails of the distribution. This condi-\ntional bias is a property of the empirical Bayes method we have used to estimate the individual\nthresholds, and is due to the individual estimates being shrunk toward the overall mean. The\namount of shrinkage decreases as the reliability of the estimates increases; it is, for example,\nsubstantially reduced if each of the 6 dilutions is presented twice. Despite this, the empirical\nBayes estimates are unconditionally unbiased, thereby permitting estimation of the mean\nthreshold for the population [27].\nImportantly, this shrinkage is beneficial when using the estimated thresholds as a covariate\nin the analysis of other variables. Consider an analysis examining the relationship between ol-\nfaction and another health outcome (for example cognitive function) in which the outcome is\nregressed on olfaction threshold, perhaps adjusting for additional covariates. If threshold esti-\nmates obtained using the average of the last four reversals (as in the staircase method) or by fit-\nting an IRT separately to the data for each individual (as in L\u00f6tsch et al.) are used, the\nestimated slope will be biased downward in magnitude, with the amount of bias increasing as\nthe reliability decreases. This well-known phenomenon is known as regression attenuation or\ndilution. However, using the empirical Bayes estimates to measure olfactory threshold can\neliminate this bias [28]. As noted above, this advantage can be achieved regardless of whether\nthe data are collected using the staircase or constant stimuli methods.\nEstimates of Threshold for the U.S. Population of Older Adults\nTwo-thousand two-hundred and seven NSHAP Wave 2 respondents, aged 62\u00ad90 at the time of\nthe interview, completed the 6-dilution n-butanol constant stimuli detection task. Comments\nTable 2. Reliability of several constant stimuli protocols based on simulated administration to the 590 normosmic distribution, n = 1,000\nsubjects with 500 replications.\naThis configuration presents the identical 6 dilutions used for a given protocol twice for a total of 12 stimuli\nbA configuration using 8 odd dilutions yielded similar results\ncAll reliabilities have a standard error 0.001\ndNA = not applicable.\nOlfactory Thresholds of U.S. Older Adults: Development and Validation\nfrom field interviewers indicated that respondents reacted favorably to the olfactory protocol\nAs expected, the estimated mean threshold for older adults in the U.S. was substantially\nlower than for the normosmic sample (2.4 vs. 9.4), while the estimated standard deviation was\nonly slightly smaller (3.0 vs. 3.6). The estimated slope parameter was 0.76, indicating that the\nprobability of a correct response increases less quickly with increasing concentration than for\nthe normosmics (for whom the slope was estimated to be 1.12). This is due to the fact that\nsome respondents in this older adult sample may be completely anosmic, and therefore for\nthem, an increase in concentration does not increase the likelihood of a correct response. Al-\nthough this could be accommodated by extending the model, fitting such a model would re-\nquire more extensive data than are available here (see discussion).\nAccuracy and Reliability of the NSHAP Protocol\nTo evaluate the measurement properties of the NSHAP protocol, we performed a computer\nsimulation study in the same manner as described above. Although the GLLAMM model fit to\nthe NSHAP data assumes a Normal distribution of olfactory thresholds, the estimated Normal\ndistribution with mean 2.4 and standard deviation 3.0 corresponds to 12% of the population\nhaving a threshold of 16% n-butanol (pen-1) or stronger and 7% of the population having a\nthreshold of 32% n-butanol (pen-2) or stronger.\nFig 2.

In partic-\nular, according to this distribution, 9% of the population has a threshold of 16% n-butanol or\ngreater, only 1% has a threshold of 32% or greater, and none has a threshold of 64% or greater.\nThe estimated slope parameter of 0.76 was used to simulate individual responses. A sample\nsize of 2,000 respondents was used to approximate the NSHAP sample, and as before, 500 rep-\nlications per condition were performed.\nThe mean correlation between the model-estimated thresholds from data collected using\nthe NSHAP protocol and the true thresholds was 0.75, yielding an estimated reliability for the\nNSHAP protocol among older adults of 0.56 (Table 3, row 3). Surprisingly, the reliability was\nonly slightly higher when administering the full 16 dilutions used by L\u00f6tsch et al. (0.65;\nTable 3, row 1). This is due to the fact that many of those dilutions are far from the center of\nthe threshold distribution for older adults. However, reliabilities for other possible 6-dilution\nprotocols were considerably lower; for example, 6 dilutions chosen evenly from across the full\nrange of standard dilutions (a plausible approach in the absence of any information about the\nstudy population) yielded a reliability of only 0.36.\nA plot showing the relationship of the model-estimated thresholds for the NSHAP 6-dilu-\ntion constant stimuli protocol and the true thresholds for a single replication is shown in\nFig. 4A, and a corresponding Bland-Altman plot with LOWESS smoother is shown in Fig. 4B.\nThe model-estimated thresholds are unconditionally unbiased (that is, for the sample as a\nFig 3. Distribution of Thresholds for Normosmics and NSHAP. Threshold distributions used for simulations, based on model-estimated distributions for\nthe 590 normosmic sample and the NSHAP Wave 2 sample (n = 2,207) of older adults. The means and standard deviations for both samples are as\nestimated by the IRT model; the Normal distribution for the NSHAP sample has been replaced by a gamma distribution with identical mean and standard\ndeviation, to more closely approximate the likely distribution of thresholds in the population.\nOlfactory Thresholds of U.S. Older Adults: Development and Validation\nwhole), but as with the evenly distributed 6-dilution design administered to normosmics\n(Fig. 2, Panel D), the conditional bias increases toward the tails of the distribution--especially\nat the weak end, due to the lack of pens with weak concentrations. As a result, the method un-\nderestimates the ability of the best smellers, though these represent a relatively small propor-\ntion of the population of older adults.\nNote that the apparent gap in Fig. 4A between a model-estimated threshold of 6.1 and the\nnext highest estimated threshold of 4.4 (as well as the corresponding gap in Fig. 4B) is an arti-\nfact of the inherent discreteness in using only 6 stimuli, yielding a total of only 64 possible re-\nsponse patterns. Although the 63 response patterns corresponding to 0\u00ad5 correct items yield\nestimated thresholds which overlap (for example, a response pattern with 5 dilutions correctly\ndetected may yield an estimated threshold similar to a response pattern with only 4 dilutions\ncorrectly detected, depending on where the correct responses appear), with only 6 stimuli there\nare no response patterns to fill the gap between 6 correct and the next highest pattern (5 correct\nresponses with one error at the weakest dilution).\nFinally, when the full staircase method (with 16 dilutions) is administered via simulation to\nthe NSHAP distribution and scored in the standard way (average of the last four reversals), the\nreliability is actually lower than for the NSHAP 6-dilution protocol (reliability = 0.41; Fig. 4,\nPanel C), and the conditional bias at the low end of the threshold distribution where the odor-\nant concentrations are strongest is greater (Fig. 4, Panel D). This results from the limitation in\nthe standard scoring method identified above, by which two or more erroneous reversals early\non among the weaker dilutions can lead to respondents with relatively poor olfaction receiving\nrelatively high threshold estimates representative of better smellers (Fig. 1, Panel B)--a tenden-\ncy that is exacerbated in the NSHAP sample due to the high proportion with poor olfaction. It\nis important to recognize that this is a limitation of the scoring procedure only, and that apart\nfrom the time and training required, there is no problem in principle with using the staircase\nTable 3.

However, once the data have been collected, using the IRT model to estimate individ-\nual thresholds will reduce bias and increase precision.\nPublic Availability of Data and Software\nThe method described here for estimating the performance of a specific staircase or constant\nstimuli protocol intended to assess olfactory threshold can be easily applied by researchers who\nwish to evaluate or design a specific assessment (not limited to olfaction) for their own pur-\nposes. As illustrated here, the first step in designing a new protocol is to acquire information\nabout the threshold distribution in the target population. Hummel et al. [13] provide norma-\ntive data for n-butanol threshold, including means, standard deviations and percentiles for\nthreshold distribution by age and gender. The NSHAP Wave 2 data described here are publicly\navailable through the National Archive of Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA, https://\nwww.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACDA/) [30], and provide data for the general population of\nhome-dwelling, older adults up through age 90. Even if one is focusing on a unique or narrowly\ndefined subpopulation for which he or she already has data, consulting publicly-available re-\nports and data sources is encouraged, especially if one's own data are from a small sample. Al-\nthough data on n-butanol threshold may be informative in planning a threshold testing\nFig 4. Scatter and Bland-Altman Plots for NSHAP. A.

Doing so facilitates an\nexamination of the sensitivity of the results to miss-specifying the population distribution.\nDiscussion\nWe have shown here how computer simulation can be used to evaluate the measurement prop-\nerties of tests of olfactory threshold without the cost or time required to conduct a study with\nhuman subjects. This method is capable of reproducing estimates of reliability obtained from\nhuman subjects studies, with the possible exception of a relatively small component of variabil-\nity due to short-term variation within subjects themselves and/or in the physical administra-\ntion of the test (due to slight variations in the pens or the way in which they are administered).\nThis additional variability could be estimated by comparing the test-retest reliability estimated\nfrom human subjects studies to the reliability estimated from simulation, and incorporated\ninto the reliability estimates generated from the latter, if desired.\nUnlike the staircase method, assessment based on the method of constant stimuli requires\nusing an IRT model to obtain individual threshold estimates. This model can also be fit to data\ncollected using the staircase method to obtain less biased and more precise threshold estimates\nthan the standard scoring method. Although such a model can be fit separately to the data for\neach subject if the number of stimuli is large, a random effects version of the model must be\nused when the number of stimuli is small.\nMoreover, the shrinkage estimates of threshold--obtained either by using empirical Bayes\nmethods following maximum likelihood estimation of a random effects model, as done here, or by\nusing a hierarchical Bayesian model--yield threshold estimates which, when used as a covariate in\na subsequent regression model, eliminate attenuation bias due to measurement error. Still, for those\nresearchers who want an immediate measure of olfactory performance without having to fit a sta-\ntistical model, the correlation between the model-estimated thresholds (with multiple imputation\nfor non-response) and the number of correct responses (0\u00ad6, treating don't know and refused as in-\ncorrect) in the NSHAP dataset is 0.92. Thus, the latter may be adequate in certain cases, such as\nwhen the objective is merely to demonstrate a relationship between olfaction and another variable.\nThere are ways in which the IRT model used here might be extended. For example, we do\nnot consider a learning effect, though estimating such an effect would require that the order of\npresentation of dilutions be varied across subjects, and any learning effect is likely to affect only\nthe first few presentations. More important, perhaps, is the fact that both the IRT model and\nour simulations assume that everyone has an actual threshold value (a dilution which they are\nable to detect with probability 2\n), therefore excluding the possibility of subjects who are truly an-\nosmic (unable to detect the odor at any concentration). A mixture model [32] in which a propor-\ntion of subjects (to be estimated from the data) are truly anosmic may match reality more closely\n--especially among older adults--however estimating such a model would likely require several\nadditional dilutions, possibly with repetition, at the low end (high concentration).\nOlfactory Thresholds of U.S. Older Adults: Development and Validation\nTo our knowledge, our results show for the first time that home-dwelling older adults have\nsubstantially worse olfactory sensitivity, a finding that has important implications for the health\nand safety of older adults and the resulting public health burden. Further, these results confirm\nthe value of the constant stimuli method for obtaining valid and reliable estimates of olfactory\nthreshold in cases where restrictions on the length and/or complexity of the test preclude ad-\nministering the staircase method. We have demonstrated that even with only 6 dilutions each\npresented once, reliabilities in the range of 0.56\u00ad0.67 can be achieved, thereby extending the pos-\nsibility of olfaction threshold measurement to a much wider range of research settings. When\npossible, however, higher reliability is generally desirable, and may be achieved even with only\n6 dilutions by presenting each dilution twice. Finally, it should be noted that we did not examine\nthe reliability of model-based estimates using data collected with the staircase method, nor other\nareas in which the staircase method may have an advantage due to its dynamic presentation of\ndilutions. For example, the staircase method has successfully been employed using the Sniffin'\nSticks in a wide range of clinical research [33\u00ad35]. Thus, when possible, researchers may still\nwish to use this method, though ideally with model-based threshold estimates.\nDoty et al. [36] called attention to the importance of reliability in olfaction assessments, fo-\ncusing on the relationship between reliability and the number of stimuli administered. The re-\nsults reported here underscore the critical importance not only of the total number of stimuli,\nbut also of the choice of dilutions relative to the threshold distribution of the population. This\nis evident in the fact that for the NSHAP population, 6 dilutions spread evenly across the range\nof dilutions yielded considerably lower reliability than 6 dilutions concentrated under the larg-\nest area of the NSHAP threshold distribution (0.36 versus 0.56). Further, 6 dilutions picked\nfrom the center of the dilution range with only minimal coverage of one tail of the NSHAP dis-\ntribution yielded the lowest reliability reported (0.13). Lastly, even 16 dilutions when spread\nacross the full range only increased the reliability to 0.65. Thus, researchers designing their\nown measurement protocol should consider carefully the olfactory ability of the population to\nwhich it will be administered.\nIn this investigation we have focused on overall reliability, since a main goal of the NSHAP\nstudy is to examine the relationship between olfactory threshold and other variables. However,\nthose wishing to use olfactory threshold measurement for other purposes (for example, in a clinical\nsetting) will probably want to focus on other performance aspects, such as bias for individual\nthreshold measurements and the sensitivity and specificity associated with specific cutoffs. The\ncomputer simulation method described here could be used equally well to examine these quantities.\n"
