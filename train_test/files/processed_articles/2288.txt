Using the data from the South African World\nHealth Survey (WHS), the current study aims to evaluate the degree of health care service\nresponsiveness (both out-patient and in-patient) and comparing experiences of individuals who\nused public and private services in South Africa.\nconducted in South Africa in 2003, the WHS \u00ad as part of a World Health Organization (WHO)\nproject focused on health system performance assessment in member countries.\nResults: Health care utilization was among those who attended in-patient care 72.2% attended a\npublic and 24.3% a private facility, and of those who attended out-patient care 58.7% attended a\npublic and 35.7% a private facility. Major components identified for out-patient care responsiveness\nin this survey were highly correlated with health care access, communication and autonomy,\nsecondarily to dignity, confidentiality and quality of basic amenities, and thirdly to health problem\nsolution. The degree of responsiveness with publicly provided care was in this study significantly\nlower than in private health care. Overall patient non-responsiveness for the public out-patient\nservice was 16.8% and 3.2% for private care. Discrimination was also one of the principal reasons\nfor non-responsiveness in all aspects of provided health care.\nConclusion: Health care access, communication, autonomy, and discriminatory experiences were\nidentified as priority areas for actions to improve responsiveness of health care services in South\nAfrica.\nBackground\nThe majority of South Africans depend on the public\nhealth sector for their health care needs [1]; the percentage\nof adults who reported that they have medical aid in the\nShisana et al.

In\nmany areas of South Africa, the Primary Health Care\n(PHC) facilities are the only available or easily accessible\nhealth service for local communities.

PHC is the basic mechanism for providing health\ncare [4]. It was formally introduced in South Africa in\nApril 1994 as the major principle for health care provision\nwith the implementation of two policies, \"Free health care\nfor pregnant mothers and children under the age of six\nyears\" as well the \"Universal Access to PHC for All South\nAfricans\" [4]. The Department of Health's strategic frame-\nof care as one of the four key challenges currently facing\nthe health sector in South Africa [5]. Quality of care is con-\ncerned with the interface between provider and patients,\nbetween health services and community. A quality per-\nspective changes the focus of health systems development\nfrom establishing structures to addressing what happens\nin the structures. Improving quality can, therefore, be\nregarded as a second phase of health care transformation\nin South Africa. The first phase was concerned with creat-\ning coherent health care structures and the second phase\nwith ensuring quality of service delivery [5].\nVariations in the perception of quality occur as a result of\nthe heterogeneous nature of the definition of quality.\nStudies have pointed to variations in perception of quality\nby different socioeconomic groups as well as the environ-\nmental aspects such as the social, organisational and tech-\nnological context of the service [6]. Van Vuuren and Botes\n[7] found among a culturally diverse population in an\nurban area in South Africa (greater Bloemfontein) that\nvariables such as population group, age and employment\nstatus influence their attitudes towards professional\nhealth care. They further emphasise the importance of\nbringing these issues to the attention of health care policy\nmakers. Peltzer [8] found in a community survey in rural\nSouth Africa a low acceptability of primary health care:\n78% felt that the medical services are poor. Bediako, Nel\nand Hiemstra [9] found among hospital and out-patients\nin the North-West Province that more than half of the\npatients (56.8%) were not satisfied with the availability of\nmedicines and other supplies. Approximately two thirds\nof patients (65.2%) did not know about the quality of tel-\nephone services rendered. There was a high level of dissat-\nisfaction (63.1%) among patients regarding accessing\ndoctors after hours. Most patients were satisfied with the\nwere dissatisfied. De Jager and Du Plooy [10] found\namong in- and out-patients in a provincial hospital in\nGauteng significant differences between in- and out-\npatients. Personal safety and cleanliness of facilities were\nregarded as the most important variables in the assurance\nand tangibility dimensions. The level of satisfaction was\nthe highest for clear information and communication at\nan understandable level in the tangibility and assurance\ncategories, respectively. The South African Department of\nHealth [2] found that there was an increase in the percent-\nage of adults who expressed dissatisfaction with all types\nof health services, except for traditional healers, compar-\ning the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of 1998\nand 2003. Generally, the results show that considerably\nmore people are dissatisfied with the services rendered in\nthe levels of dissatisfaction with the services rendered by\nsolo practitioners in the private sector (7.9%) seem to be\non the increase during the period between the surveys.\nThe major reasons for dissatisfaction with the public sec-\ntor hospitals and community health centres were long\nand shortages of staff (doctors/pharmacists). Major rea-\nsons for dissatisfaction in the private hospital/clinic sector\nand private doctor were also long waiting times (26.7%\nnational population-based survey and found that both\nrace and socio-economic status (SES) were significant pre-\ndictors of levels of satisfaction with the services of the\nhealth care provider; White and high SES respondents\nwere about 1.5 times more likely to report excellent serv-\nice compared with African Black and low SES respond-\nents, respectively.\nPatients' views are being given more and more impor-\ntance in policy-making. Understanding populations' per-\nceptions of quality of care is critical to developing\nmeasures to increase the utilization of primary health care\nservices.\nA population-based survey was conducted in South Africa\nin 2003, the WHS \u00ad as part of a WHO project focused on\nhealth system performance assessment in member coun-\ntries. Among the surveyed aspects was the evaluation of\nhealth care provision, based on the concept of \"respon-\nsiveness\" [12]. Using the data from the South African\nWHS, the current study aims to evaluate the degree of\nresponsiveness with provided health care (both out-\npatient and in-patient), and comparing the experiences of\nindividuals who used public and private services in South\nAfrica.\nMethods\nSample and procedure\nThe country sample (n = 2352) was nationally represent-\native and probabilistically selected using a multistage clus-\nter design. All respondents were selected using a Kish table\nfor selection within a household. The study included: (1)\nall individuals who had been hospitalized in the previous\nfive years (stayed overnight in a hospital or other type of\nlong-term care facility), and (2) among those who had not\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 1: Last visit responsiveness in percent by public or private out-patient care (n = 424, excluding NGO and other: n = 25)\nOut-patient care Total\nPublic\nPrivate\nPatient satisfaction\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nbeen hospitalized in the previous five years, all individu-\nals who had used an out-patient health service in the past\n12 months. Only the participants who had used an in-\npatient and/or out-patient health services were requested\nto complete the responsiveness questions. The number of\nresponses obtained was a function of the overall response\nrate as well as the rate of service utilization in the previous\n12 months for out-patient and 5 years for in-patient serv-\nices. More detailed information about the World Health\nSurvey is available on its website http://www.who.int/\nhealthinfo/survey/en/index.html. To adjust for the popu-\nlation distribution as represented by the UN Statistical\nDivision and for non-response, post-stratification correc-\ntions were made to the sampling weights.\nParticipants were interviewed face-to-face by lay people\nwith at least a high school-level education; interviewers\nwere trained in a week-long course using a standard man-\nual and audiovisual aids as well as role-plays. Practice\nfield interviews were reviewed by supervisors before actual\ndata collection. All questionnaires were translated into\nmajor languages in South Africa and back-translated using\na standard WHO protocol. The quality of translations was\nindependently verified by bilingual experts before field\nimplementation. Informed consent was obtained from all\nrespondents and the study was cleared by ethics review\ncommittees.\nOutcome measures\nThe questionnaire included in this analysis used the\nhealth system responsiveness module. Responsiveness\nrelates to patient's experiences with the health system,\nwith a focus on the interpersonal aspects of the care, and\ndiffers from patient satisfaction, a construct that reflects\npeople's expectations in addition to their experiences\nQuestions covered the following aspects: traveling time to\nthe health care provider (item wording: For your last visit\n[or hospital stay], how would you rate the traveling time\nto the health care provider [or hospital]?); waiting time\nbefore being attended to; being greeted and talked to\nrespectfully; respect for intimacy during physical exami-\nnation and care; clarity of explanations by the health care\nproviders; availability of time to ask questions about the\nhealth problem or treatment; possibility of obtaining\ninformation on other types of treatment or tests; partici-\npation in decision-making on the health care or treat-\nment; patient's freedom to speak privately with the health\nprofessionals; personal information kept confidential;\nfreedom to choose the health care provider; inside the\nfacility cleanliness including toilets; and available space in\nwaiting and examination rooms. For participants who\nreceived in-patient care, two additional aspects were\nincluded: ease in receiving visits by family members (item\nwording: For your last hospital stay, how would you rate\nthe ease of having family and friends visit you? and con-\ntact with the outside world) [13]. Response options for\nthese responsiveness items were 1 = very good, 2 = good,\n3 = moderate, 4 = bad, and 5 = very bad. These item\nresponses were dichotomised into \"1\" and \"2\" = 1, and 3\u00ad\n5 = 0. In addition, there were three items for both out-\npatients and in-patients related to the health profes-\nsional's skills (item wording for out-patients: In your\nopinion was the health care provider's skill adequate for\nyour treatment? and item wording for in-patients: In your\nopinion, was the skill of the health care providers ade-\nquate for your treatment?), availability of medicines, and\nadequacy of equipment in the care; response options for\nthese items were \"yes\" or \"no\". Cronbach alpha for the 16\nitems out-patients responsiveness scale was .89 for this\nsample and for the 18 items in-patient responsiveness\nscale .90 for this sample. Further, participants were asked\nTable 1: Last visit responsiveness in percent by public or private out-patient care (n = 424, excluding NGO and other: n = 25) (Continued)\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 2: Last visit responsiveness in percent by public and private in-patient care (n = 633, excluding NGO and other: n = 23)\nIn-patient care Total\nPublic\nPrivate\nPatient satisfaction\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nwhether they felt they had been treated worse by the\nhealth care providers (whether they felt discriminated) for\non any of the following reasons: sex, age, lack of money,\nsocial class, ethnic group or skin color, type of illness, or\nnationality. Response options for these 7 items were \"yes\"\nData analysis\nThe first stage of this work included a descriptive analysis\nof the degree of responsiveness based on a set of variables\nthat expressed the user's degree of experience, according to\nfive response levels (1 = very good to 5 = very bad). For\neach of the items, the degree of responsiveness was esti-\nmated by the percentage of \"good\" or \"very good\" answers\nand the percentage of positive answers to three other\ndichotomous variables (yes or no), related to the health\nprofessional's skills, availability of medicines, and ade-\nquacy of equipment in the care. Percentages of patients'\nexperiences were analyzed by \"type of care\" (out-patient\nor in-patient) and by public and private health care service\nTo explain total variation in the data set using a smaller\nnumber of factors, the second stage of the analysis used\nprincipal component analysis with varimax rotation.\nLogistic regression was conducted for public versus private\nhealth care provider, and linear regression for the total\nresponsiveness scale (16 responsiveness items for out-\npatients and 18 responsiveness items for in-patients), sep-\narately for public and private health care utilization.\nDemographic variables included sex, two age groups (18\nto 39 and 40 years and above), two educational groups\n(up to primary school completed and above) [13], dis-\ncriminatory experiences were summed up and converted\ninto a binary variable with 1 = indicating any of the six dis-\ncriminatory experiences and 0 = no such experiences.\nFor the statistical analysis the data were weighted accord-\ning to the sampling design using Stata software version\n10.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA).\nResults\nwas 80% and the individual response rate was 90%. Aver-\nage item missing rates were less than 1% (range 0\u00ad1.8%)\nfor the responsiveness questions. Of the 2352 interview-\nprior to the survey. Of these, 72.2% attended a govern-\nment public facility, 24.3% a privately operated health\nTable 2: Last visit responsiveness in percent by public and private in-patient care (n = 633, excluding NGO and other: n = 23) (Continued)\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nfacility, 1.3% an NGO and 2.4% other. Among the partic-\nonce in the year prior to the interview. Of these, 58.7%\nattended a government public facility, 35.7% a privately\noperated health facility, 0.9% an NGO and 4.7% other.\nOverall, 5.1% reported to have health insurance. The type\nof the last out-patient health care provider visited was\nphysiotherapist and 2.4% other, none indicated tradi-\ntional health practitioner.\nAccording to the evaluation of out-patient care (see Table\n1), \"waiting time for care\" showed the lowest degree of\nresponsiveness (51.2%) among all the areas analyzed.\nWhile, the aspects related to health professionals' skills\nbility of medicines received (87.1%), and respect for inti-\nmacy during physical examination (77.9%) had the\nhighest responsiveness scores. The percentage of users\nwho gave \"good\" or \"very good\" ratings was lower among\nusers of the public health care system for all aspects stud-\nied, both for out-patient and inpatient care. The percent-\nage of users who rated their experiences with \"bad\" or\n\"very bad\" was 16.8% for public and 3.2% for private out-\npatient care (see Table 1).\nTable 4: Percentage of patients who experienced some type of discrimination by public and private in-patient care\nReason for discrimination Total Public Private OR (95% CI)\nTable 3: Percentage of patients who experienced some type of discrimination by public and private out-patient care\nReason for discrimination Total Public Private OR (95% CI)\nOut-patient care\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nTable 5: Principal component analysis with varimax rotation of health care responsiveness by out-patient and in-patient care (only\nitems loading .40 or more are recorded)\nOut-patient experiences In-patient experiences\nFrequency (%) Factor 1 Factor 2 Factor 3 Factor 1 Factor 2 Factor 3 Factor 4\nOut-patient =\nOP\nIn-patient = IP\nTime/\nCommunication\n/Autonomy\nDignity/\nConfidentiality/\nBasic amenities\nHealth\nproblem\nsolution\nCommunication/\nAutonomy/\nConfidentiality\nTime/dignity Health\nproblem\nsolution\nBasic\namenities/\nsupport\nTraveling time to\nthe health care\nprovider\nTime\nBeing greeted and\ntalked to\nrespectfully\nRespect for\nintimacy during\nphysical\nexamination\nClarity of\nexplanations\nTime for\nquestions\nPossibility of\nobtaining\ninformation on\nother types of\ntreatment\nAutonomy\nParticipation in\ntreatment\ndecision-making\nPrivacy with\nhealth\nprofessionals\nConfidentiality of\npersonal\ninformation\nCleanliness inside\nthe health facility\nQuality of basic\namenities\nAvailable space in\nwaiting and\nexamination\nrooms\nSatisfactoryhealth\ncare provider\nskills\nHealth problem\nsolution\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nAmong all the aspects of in-patient care responsiveness\n(Table 2), the lowest percentage of responsiveness was\nattributed to \"freedom to choose the health care provider\"\n(55.7%), while areas related to adequate health care pro-\nvider skills, equipment, and availability of medicines had\nthe highest health system responsiveness.\nA significant proportion of out-patient care users experi-\nenced discrimination for the following reasons: 11.9%\nreported feeling they had been treated worse than others\nbecause of lack of money and 9.3% because of their social\nclass. Among users of the public services these figures were\nreported they had been treated worse because of their skin\ncolour. Interviewees who had been hospitalized in the\nprevious five years reported lower discrimination rates\nthan out-patients, with \"lack of money\", race and \"social\nclass\" as major factors. Users of in-patient and out-patient\npublic health care reported significantly higher discrimi-\nnation rates than private health care patients (see Table 3\nPrincipal component analysis found for out-patient care\nresponsiveness three main factors explaining 58.5% of the\nvariance and for in-patient care responsiveness four fac-\ntors explaining 62.9% of the variance.

Only\nprivate health service and lower discrimination experi-\nenced were consistently associated with the total patient\nsatisfaction score.\nDiscussion\nThe study conducted among a nationally representative\nsample in South Africa found that of those who attended\nvate facility, and of those who attended out-patient care\nnone indicated traditional health practitioner. Similarly,\nShisana et al. [3] found in a nationally representative\nstudy that the majority (70%) indicated that they usually\nattended public health care services, 23.3% attended pri-\nvate health care services, and 0.1% utilised traditional\nhealth practitioners.\nThe international comparison of health care responsive-\nness using the same measures and analysis found that\noverall South Africa (67% for out-patients and 68% for in-\npatients) had much lower responsiveness than Brazil\n(80% for out-patients and 76% for in-patients) and Israel\nand 14 European countries (81% and higher) for both\nout-patient and in-patient care.

The relative rankings of the domains among\nout-patients were similar in South Africa and Brazil, with\nthe three highest rankings on confidentiality, dignity and\ncommunication, and the three lowest on waiting time,\nautonomy and quality of basic amenities. Regarding rela-\ntive rankings on the domains among out-patients rank-\nings were similar in South Africa and Brazil, with quality\nof basic amenities ranking third, after dignity and confi-\ndence. Rankings for European countries were similar, with\nthe exception that quality of basic amenities was ranked\nhigher than in middle income countries (Brazil and South\nPrincipal component analysis found in this study that\nresponsiveness in out-patients included as major factors\nwaiting time/communication/autonomy followed by dig-\nnity/confidentiality/basic amenities, and for in-patients\ncommunication/autonomy/confidentiality, waiting time/\ndignity and lastly quality of basic amenities/support. Sim-\nilarly, Valentine, Darby and Bonsel [16] found from gen-\neral population surveys of \"health systems\nresponsiveness\" in 41 countries that most respondents\nselected prompt attention as the most important domain.\nDignity was selected second, followed by communica-\ntion. Access to social support networks was identified as\nthe least important domain. The factor solutions from this\nstudy did not confirm the domain structure of 7 domains\nof previous studies [17]. This study underlines different\nclustering patterns of responsiveness for out-patients and\nin-patients in South Africa, in the Brazilian WHYS study\n[13] and in a study in Taiwan that found five factors\n(respect, access, confidentiality, basic amenities, and\nsocial support) [18]. For example, \"autonomy\" was in this\nand the Taiwanese study [18] not conceptualized as a\nunique domain. Further, studies are needed to identify the\nstructure of health systems responsiveness domains in\ndeveloping countries.\nRegarding health care provider skills among out-patients\nin this study similar results were found between this study\nTable 6: Multivariate linear regression of demographic and health variables on total patient satisfaction [Dependent Variable:\nAmbulatory or in-patient responsiveness]\nOut-patients In-patients\nTotal patient satisfaction Total patient satisfaction\nSex\nFemale\nAge\nEducation\nForm of payment\nPrivate\nDiscrimination\nNo\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nMajor components identified for out-patient care respon-\nsiveness in this survey were highly correlated with health\ncare access, communication and autonomy, secondarily\nto dignity, confidentiality and quality of basic amenities,\nand thirdly to health problem solution. Thus, from the\nperspective of health service users in South Africa, health\ncare responsiveness was primarily related to health care\naccess, communication and autonomy. Each of the three\ncomponents got the lowest responsiveness ratings (59%\u00ad\n77%) compared to the other components (dignity, confi-\ndentiality, basic amenities and health problem solution)\nThe degree of responsiveness with publicly provided care\nwas in this study significantly lower than in private health\ncare; a finding which was also found in local studies [2,8]\nand in the Brazilian WHS [13]. Overall lack of responsive-\nness for the public out-patient service was 16.8% in this\nstudy, which is lower to the DHS survey (23.3%) measur-\ning patient dissatisfaction [2]. Both studies were con-\nducted in the same year, 2003. Possible explanations for\nthe above differences may lie in the better quality of pri-\nvate services or that expectations are already high among\nthe population, both for users and nonusers, and because\nthe different measures used in terms of getting a lower\nscore with the responsiveness measure as compared to a\ndissatisfaction measure. In this study 15.4% of public out-\npatients were dissatisfied with the availability of medi-\ncines, which seem lower than in some local studies,\n56.8% [9]. In multivariate regression analysis sex, age and\neducational level were not found to be associated with\nhealth care responsiveness unlike in some other studies\nAnother problem identified in this study and also con-\nfirmed in the Brazilian WHS [13] was the high percentage\nof individuals who felt discrimination, regardless of pub-\nlic or private health care. Discrimination was also one of\nthe principal reasons for dissatisfaction in all aspects of\nprovided health care. The principal sources of discrimina-\ntion identified by respondents were lack of money, social\nclass and race. Gueveiva et al. [13] also found among the\nBrazilian WHS lack of money and social class as major fac-\ntors of health care discrimination. It is important to note\nthat the percentages of individuals who felt they had been\ntreated worse than others on grounds of social exclusion\nwere consistently higher among users of the public health\ncare system, a practice that runs counter to the Bhato Pele\n(People first) guiding principles of the South African\nhealth care system. According to a qualitative study by\nMashego and Peltzer [19] discrimination was also identi-\nfied among primary public care users.\nUnlike in some other studies [7], this study did not find\nsignificant associations between socio-demographic vari-\nables (age, sex and formal education) and patient satisfac-\ntion.\nConclusion\nHealth care access, communication, autonomy, and dis-\ncriminatory experiences were identified as priority areas\nfor actions to improve responsiveness and patient satisfac-\nTable 7: Health care responsiveness (percentage of respondents who responded either \"good\" or \"very good\") comparisons across\nOut-patient experiences In-patient experiences\nSouth Africa Brazil Israel European countries* South Africa Brazil Israel European countries*\n*European countries included were: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxemburg, Netherlands,\nPortugal, Sweden, and United Kingdom\nPublish with BioMed Central and every\nscientist can read your work free of charge\n\"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for\ndisseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\"\nSir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK\nYour research papers will be:\navailable free of charge to the entire biomedical community\npeer reviewed and publishedimmediately upon acceptance\ncited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central\nyours -- you keep the copyright\nSubmit your manuscript here:\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/info/publishing_adv.asp\nBioMedcentral\n(page number not for citation purposes)\ntion in South Africa. Implications for policymaking\ninclude that the result from the survey can be used to pri-\noritize efforts when resources are limited. The data seem\nto provide a clear message to prioritize reforms that\nimprove prompt attention, but not at the expense of\npatient dignity and communication, which may damage\nthe acceptability of health services to users, and result in\nbarriers to access.\nStudy limitations\nIn this survey all respondents who had been hospitalized\nin the five years prior to the survey were asked about their\nmost recent hospitalization, and all others were asked\nabout their most recent ambulatory visit in the previous\nyear. The result is that the set of respondents who\nanswered the questions about ambulatory care is small\nand not representative of the general population, but\nrather of the population that had not been hospitalized\nduring the previous five years. The cross-sectional study\ndesign did not permit an investigation of the cause-effect\nrelationship between responsiveness and independent\nvariables.
