Griffith, PhD\nDepression is a costly and debilitating illness; approxi-\nmately 16% of the US population (>32 million people)\nwill meet the criteria for major depressive disorder in\na given year.1 Typically, women are diagnosed with depres-\nsion twice as often as men. This sex ratio appears in almost ev-\nery setting, including Western and most non-Western com-\nmunity studies.2-5 Most research exploring this difference\nfocuses on explanations for why women are at greater risk for\ndeveloping depression.\nMore than 10 years ago, an alternative approach to explain-\ning this disparity was proposed. This literature critiques the\nvalidityofthecurrentdiagnosticcriteria,arguingthatmenmay\nexperience alternative depression symptoms.6 In part be-\ncause traditional depressive symptoms (eg, sadness, crying)\nare at odds with societal ideals of masculinity, men may be re-\nluctant to report experiencing these symptoms. Second, men's\nexperiences of depression may manifest with symptoms that\nare not currently included in traditional diagnostic criteria.\nAddis7 proposes 4 conceptual frameworks within the exist-\ning literature that address how gender shapes men's experi-\nences, expressions, and reactions to depression: (1) the sex dif-\nferences framework, (2) the masked depression framework,\n(3) the masculine depression framework, and (4) the gen-\ndered response framework.\nThe sex differences framework is rooted in the idea that\nthe construct of depression is the same in men and women\nand seeks to investigate sex differences in a range of related\nvariables, including symptoms.7 Although this has been a\npopular approach to date, it is often critiqued for relying on\noppositional binaries that understand \"male depression\"\nonly as it is contrasted with \"female depression, \" which fails\nto acknowledge the heterogeneity that exists within these\ngroups.\nThe masked depression framework proposes that men are\nmore likely to express their emotional and psychological dis-\ntress in the form of \"depressive equivalents\"7 because direct\nadmission of sadness and emotional weakness or vulnerabil-\nity in men is seen as socially unacceptable.8 The biggest cri-\nIMPORTANCE When men are depressed they may experience symptoms that are different\nthan what is included in the current diagnostic criteria.\nOBJECTIVE To explore whether sex disparities in depression rates disappear when alternative\nsymptoms are considered in the place of, or in addition to, more conventional depression\nsymptoms.\nNational Comorbidity Survey Replication, a nationally represented mental health survey, we\nevaluated sex differences in symptom endorsement in 2 new scales that included alternative\ndepression symptoms. We analyzed sex differences in symptom endorsement using 2-sided,\ndesign-based, .05-level t tests and multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of\ndepression.\nRESULTS Men reported higher rates of anger attacks/aggression, substance abuse, and risk\ntaking compared with women. Analyses using the scale that included alternative, male-type\nsymptoms of depression found that a higher proportion of men (26.3%) than women (21.9%)\n(P = .007) met criteria for depression. Analyses using the scale that included alternative and\ntraditional depression symptoms found that men and women met criteria for depression in\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE When alternative and traditional symptoms are combined,\nsex disparities in the prevalence of depression are eliminated. Further study is needed to\nclarify which symptoms truly describe men's experiences of depression.\nSupplemental content at\njamapsychiatry.com\nAuthor Affiliations: Women's &\nGender Studies and Health Policy\nStudies, University of Michigan,\nDearborn (Martin); Program for\nResearch on Black Americans,\nInstitute for Social Research, Center\non Men's Health Disparities,\nDepartment of Health Behavior &\nHealth Education, School of Public\nHealth, University of Michigan, Ann\nArbor (Neighbors); Center on Men's\nHealth Disparities, Department of\nHealth Behavior and Health\nEducation, School of Public Health,\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor\n(Griffith); now with the Center for\nMedicine, Health, and Society,\nVanderbilt University, Nashville,\nTennessee (Griffith).\nCorresponding Author: Lisa A.\nMartin, PhD, Women's & Gender\nStudies and Health Policy Studies,\nUniversity of Michigan, Dearborn,\nResearch\nOriginal Investigation\nDownloaded From: http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/ by a Labtiva Inc. User on 11/20/2015\ntique of this framework is that it remains difficult to identify\nthe depressive equivalents.\nThe masculine depression framework hypothesizes that\nthe struggle to adhere to hegemonic masculine norms places\nmen at risk for experiencing an alternative depression vari-\nant often characterized by externalizing symptoms.7 Rather\nthanappearingsad,menexperiencingemotionalpainaremore\nlikely to react with anger, self-destructive behavior, self-\ndistraction, or numbing of pain with substance use, gam-\nbling, womanizing, and workaholism.9 Others have pro-\nposed that irritability could be the key symptom linking men\nand depression.8 Winkler et al10 found that male patients with\ndepressionscoredsignificantlyhigheronirritability,weremore\nprone to overreact to minor annoyances, experienced anger\nattacks (sudden spells of anger and aggression with physical\nfeatures similar to panic attacks), had lower impulse control,\nexhibited greater substance use, and experienced more hy-\nperactive behavior compared with depressed female\nThe gendered response framework states that men's re-\nsponses to negative affect, including depressed mood, grief,\nand sadness, are shaped by men's adherence to or rejection of\nhegemonic masculinity. Gender socialization can direct some\nmen to withhold or restrict emotional expression, leaving men\nwith limited ways to express their feelings of emotional pain\nand psychological distress. Therefore, clinicians would need\nto look at alternative negative outcomes to identify depres-\nsion in their patients.7\nCurrently, 2 scales exist that evaluate the presence of al-\nternative \"male-type\" depression symptoms in groups of clini-\ncal patients. The Gotland Male Depression Scale (GMDS) was\ndeveloped as part of a study investigating suicide in Sweden\nand originally validated with a sample of men in treatment for\nsubstance abuse.3,12,13 Since then, the GMDS has been used in\navarietyofsettingswithclinicalsamplesofmenandwomen.14\nThe second measure designed to identify male-type depres-\nsion is the Masculine Depression Scale (MDS).15-17 The MDS is\na self-report scale designed to capture alternative symptoms\nproposed in the literature to be more common in men's pre-\nsentation of depression. Men who scored high on masculine\nnorms adherence were less likely to endorse traditional de-\npression items. Although both the GMDS and the MDS have\nprovided empirical evidence supporting men's alternative ex-\npression of depression, neither scale has been used in a na-\ntionally representative sample of US residents.\nThe present study was a secondary analysis of the Na-\ntional Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R),18 a nation-\nally representative sample of mental health data. We ad-\ndressed a gap identified by Addis's masculine depression\nframeworks7 by combining externalizing symptoms (eg, sub-\nstance abuse, irritability, and anger) with traditional depres-\nsion symptoms within the context of a nationally representa-\ntive self-report sample. We created 2 new depression measures\nby combining externalizing symptoms of depression pro-\nposed by 2 previously validated measures of male-type de-\npression, the GMDS and the MDS, with traditional depression\nsymptoms. The first scale, referred to as the Male Symptoms\nScale (MSS), exclusively includes alternative male-type symp-\ntoms of depression, while the second scale combines these\nsymptoms with traditional depression items to create the Gen-\nder Inclusive Depression Scale (GIDS) (see the eAppendix in\nthe Supplement for a description of the GIDS).\nMethods\nSample Description\nThe present study uses secondary data analysis of the NCS-R,\na nationally representative survey of the incidence and preva-\nlence of mental disorders among English-speaking adults of\nthe United States. It includes assessments based on the diag-\nnostic criteria of the American Psychiatric Association as re-\nported in the DSM-IV.6 The NCS-R interview was adminis-\nincluded a core diagnostic assessment of all respondents\n(N = 9282). Part II was administered to a subset of the part I\nrespondentswhometlifetimecriteriaforanycoredisorderplus\na 1-in-3 probability subsample of other respondents (n = 5692).\nPart II questioned respondents about correlates and addi-\ntional disorders. (For a full description of the development of\nthe NCS-R, see Pennell and colleagues.18) This study used the\npart II sample.\nCreation of the MSS and GIDS\nWe used a 2-step process to create the 2 scales. One of us\n(L.A.M.) conducted an extensive literature review to con-\nstructalistofalternativemale-typedepressionsymptoms.She\nthen compared this list against the NCS-R questionnaire and\ndata set to determine whether appropriate variables captur-\ning the desired symptoms could be identified. eTable 1 in the\nSupplement lists the symptoms identified from the literature\nreview and whether they were included in the MSS or GIDS.\nSymptoms were excluded from the scales for one of 3 pos-\nsible reasons: (1) symptoms were deemed inappropriate, (2)\nequivalentitemswerenotavailable,or(3)thenumberofpeople\nfor whom data were available for a symptom was too small to\nbe useful for the analysis (ie, <250 people).\nThefirstscaledevelopedforthepresentanalysisistheMSS,\nwhich was developed to assess a male-type depression. It as-\nsesses 8 constructs that have been proposed in the literature\nas externalizing symptoms of depression in men: (1) irritabil-\nity, (2) anger attacks/aggression, (3) sleep disturbance, (4) al-\ncohol/other drug abuse, (5) risk-taking behavior, (6) hyperac-\ntivity, (7) stress, and (8) loss of interest in pleasurable activities.\nTwo of the symptoms included in the MSS (sleep disturbance\nand loss of interest in pleasurable activities) are part of tradi-\ntional measures of depression but were included because they\naddressexternalizingactionsandappearassymptomsineither\nthe GMDS or the MDS.\nThe second scale designed to assess male depression is the\nGIDS, which consists of 15 symptoms. The GIDS includes all\nthe MSS symptoms as well as 7 traditional symptoms of de-\npression, including sad/depressed mood, loss of vitality, tired-\nness, ambivalence, anxiety/uneasiness, and complaintive-\nness (feeling pathetic).

User on 11/20/2015\n25 items appear in the screening section of the NCS-R, 3 items\nweretakenfromthe30-daysymptomsassessmentportion,and\n1 item each came from Neurasthenia, Personality, and Mania.\nMost items assess the lifetime presence of the symptom; there-\nfore, we frame the prevalence of the depression using the MSS\nand GIDS as lifetime estimates of depression.\nScoring the MSS and GIDS\nWe calculated a simple index for each of the 2 scales that added\n1 point for each symptom endorsed in the scale. Symptoms\nwere considered present as long as one of the items assessing\nthatconstructwasendorsed.ScoresontheMSScanrangefrom\n0 to 8. Respondents were divided into 2 categories: individu-\nals with scores of 1 to 4 were classified as not meeting depres-\nsion criteria, and those with scores of 5 or higher were consid-\nered depression cases. The GIDS includes 25 items assessing\n15 symptoms, and GIDS scores can range from 0 to 15. We split\nthis group into 3 severity levels: respondents with GIDS scores\nof 1 to 4 were labeled mild cases, not meeting depression cri-\nteria, those with scores of 5 to 9 symptoms were considered\nmoderate cases, and those with scores ranging from 10 to 15\nwerelabeledseverecases.Welatercombinedthemoderateand\nsevere groups so that respondents with a score of 5 or higher\non a scale were identified as meeting criteria for depression.\nThe 5-point cutoff is modeled after the DSM-IV definition of\nmajor depressive disorder: the presence of at least 5 symp-\ntoms of depression that occur within the same 2-week period\nis one of the main requirements for meeting the diagnostic cri-\nteria for major depression.6\nStatistical Analysis\nWe used STATA 10.0 statistical software (SE version; StataCorp\nLP) for all statistical analyses.19 The sampling methods used in\nthe data collection necessitated using the complex survey data\nmethods in the STATA statistical package to correctly calculate\nthestandarderrors.InternalconsistencywasmeasuredbyCron-\nbach . Values of 0.7 or greater are acceptable, whereas values\nof 0.6 or less indicate that the items may not be related or do\nnot measure the same construct.20 Concurrent validity of the\nMSS and GIDS was investigated by correlational analyses with\nlifetime diagnoses of major depressive episode (MDE), alcohol\nabuse, other drug abuse, and intermittent explosive disorder\n(IED). Bivariate analyses tested for potential sex differences in\nsymptom endorsement for each of the newly constructed de-\npression scales. Statistical significance was evaluated using\n2-sided, design-based, .05-level tests.\nHypotheses\nHypothesis 1 was that the MSS and GIDS will exhibit a posi-\ntive strong correlation with MDE and be moderately corre-\nlated with alcohol abuse, other drug abuse, and IED. If the new\nscales are indeed measuring depression, we expect them to be\nclosely correlated with an existing measure of depression. If\nmen mask depression with substance abuse, as suggested in\nthe literature, we would expect the 2 scales to be positively re-\nlated to alcohol and other drug abuse. Because anger has been\ntheorized to be a depressive symptom for men and IED has\ndemonstratedmoderatebutsignificantcomorbiditywithmood\ndisorders, we expect to find a moderate relationship between\nIED and the MSS and GIDS.21\nHypothesis 2 was that male depression as measured by the\nMSS will be more prevalent among men than women. The MSS\nincludes symptoms that depressed men could be more will-\ning to admit to in the place of traditional depression symp-\ntoms. The MSS is based on the literature showing that men are\nmore prone to irritability, hyperactivity, violence, and so-\nthoughitispossiblethatsomewomenwillendorsetheseatypi-\ncal male-type symptoms, if the MSS truly captures male\ndepression, then depression should be more prevalent among\nmen than women.\nHypothesis3wasthattheprevalenceofmaledepressionas\nmeasuredbytheGIDSwillresultinnogenderdifferences.Incon-\ntrast to the MSS, the GIDS takes a different approach. The GIDS\ncombinesthemale-typesymptomsoftheMSSwithseveraltra-\nditionalsymptomsofdepression.Thus,theGIDSisdesignedto\nbe inclusive of both traditional and male-specific symptoms of\ndepression.Thishypothesisassumesthatmaledepressionisnot\na separate disorder from major depression but that the current\nsymptom profile does not include symptoms that reflect men's\nexperiences. If this is the case, then the GIDS will identify an\nequal number of depression cases across the sexes.\nHypothesis 4 was that men will endorse the nontradi-\ntionalsymptomswithgreaterfrequencythanwomenwill.This\nfinal hypothesis investigates whether there are sex differences\namong the specific items that have been added as alternative\nexpressions of depression. So far, the literature reports mixed\nresults regarding symptom endorsements. M\u00f6ller-Leimk\u00fchler\net al17 used the GMDS in a clinical sample of men and women\nand found no differences in the percentages of item endorse-\nment between the sexes. Winkler et al10 found that male pa-\ntients with depression scored significantly higher on irritabil-\nity, experienced anger attacks, had lower impulse control,\nexhibited greater substance use, and experienced more hyper-\nactive behavior compared with depressed female patients.\nResults\nSample Characteristics\nThe demographic characteristics of the sample are summa-\nrized in Table 1.

Table 2 summarizes the correlation coefficients among\nthe MSS, the GIDS, and MDE, other drug abuse, alcohol abuse,\nand IED.

We also found sex differences in the\nrate of endorsement of the specific items constituting the MSS.\nMen endorsed the following items at significantly higher rates\nthan women: anger attacks/aggression, substance abuse, and\nrisk-taking behavior. Women endorsed 4 symptoms at signifi-\ncantly greater rates than men: stress, irritability, sleep prob-\nlems, and loss of interest in things you usually enjoy, such as\nwork, hobbies, and personal relationships.\nGender Inclusive Depression Scale\nUsing the 5-point cutoff, we found no sex difference in the\nprevalence of depression as assessed by the GIDS, which con-\nfirmed our third hypothesis. We also compared prevalence by\nthe3severitylevels:mild(1-4symptoms),moderate(5-9symp-\nand 62.0% of women fell into the mild category, 28.3% of men\nand 28.9% of women fell into the moderate category, and 8.5%\nof men and 9.1% of women fell into the severe category. No sig-\nnificant sex differences were demonstrated at any severity\nlevel.\nHypothesis 4 stated that men would endorse the alter-\nnative symptoms of depression at higher rates than women,\nbut the results of these analyses were mixed. Men endorsed\nsubstance abuse, anger attacks/aggression, and risk-taking\nbehavior at higher rates than women when depression was\nassessed by the MSS (Table 3) (see eTable 2 in the Supple-\nment for the GIDS item endorsements). When depression\nwas assessed using the GIDS, men endorsed anger attacks/\naggression, substance abuse, risk-taking behavior, and\nhyperactivity more than women. Women endorsed 6 symp-\ntoms at significantly higher rates than men: stress, indeci-\nsiveness, anxiety, sleep disturbance, depressed mood, and\ncomplaintiveness. Irritability was endorsed equally by men\nand women. Examining the top endorsed symptoms\nrevealed similar patterns for men and women. Depressed\nmood was the principal symptom for both men and women,\nand anger attacks/aggression, stress, irritability, and\nanxiety/uneasiness constituted the remainder of the top 5\nsymptoms reported for both sexes.\nDiscussion\nThis is the first study, to our knowledge, to assess the impli-\ncations of considering alternative, male-type symptoms of\ndepression for sex differences in the prevalence of depres-\nsion in a nationally representative sample of US adults.\nAlthough men were likely to endorse many traditional\ndepression symptoms, men were significantly more likely to\nreport symptoms of anger attacks/aggression, irritability,\nsubstance abuse, and risk-taking behaviors over symptoms\nsuch as withdrawal from friends, sleep problems, and feel-\nings of complaintiveness. These results suggest that relying\nonly on men's disclosure of traditional symptoms could lead\nto an underdiagnosis of depression in men and that clini-\ncians should consider other clues when assessing depres-\nsion in men.\nThisstudyincluded2measuresofdepressioncriteria.Both\nscales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency. The 2\nscales also were highly correlated with each other, as well as\nwith MDE, indicating that they are measuring related con-\nstructs. The fact that the 2 scales were more strongly corre-\nlated with an established depression construct (MDE) com-\npared with the other disorders provides evidence of construct\nvalidity, namely, that these scales measure an alternative ex-\npression of depression.\nThe MSS consists of alternative symptoms suggested by\nthe literature as well as traditional symptoms that are not\nstereotypically associated with femininity. The MSS found\nthat depression was more prevalent among men than\nwomen and more prevalent among men than major depres-\nsion. Using the MSS, we found that men endorsed some of\nthese male-type symptoms at higher rates than women did,\nincluding anger attacks/aggression, substance abuse, and\nrisk-taking behavior. Women endorsed stress, irritability,\nsleep problems, and loss of interest at significantly higher\nlevels. The loss of interest and sleep items are part of tradi-\ntional depression criteria, and psychological distress is often\nperceived as a proxy for depressed mood; therefore, it is not\nsurprising that women endorsed these items at higher rates\nthan men. The fact that irritability was endorsed more by\nTable 3.

User on 11/20/2015\nmen than women was somewhat surprising but consistent\nwith the findings of Fava et al23 that more women than men\nmeet criteria for an irritable-type depression.\nThe second scale, the GIDS, included traditional depres-\nsion items as well as the alternative, male-type items from\nthe MSS. The MSS appeared to identify depression in a\ngroup of men who disclosed more externalizing symptoms.\nHowever, we know that men's experiences of depression are\nnot uniform. For some men, these alternative symptoms\nwould be enough to assess depression, while others would\nexperience the more traditional symptoms of depression.\nGiven that a significant number of women also met our\ndepression case criteria using the MSS indicates that both\nwomen and men would benefit from a scale that contains an\narray of symptoms that better reflect the heterogeneity of\nthe depression experience. Similar to the MSS results, the\nGIDS identified depression in men more often than when\nonly the traditional DSM-IV criteria were used. This rate also\nwas higher than the number of depressed men identified\nwith the MSS. The most important finding was that, when\nthe GIDS was used, men and women met criteria for depres-\nsion in equal proportions. When alternative symptoms were\nincluded in depression case criteria, more male depression\ncases were identified than when traditional criteria were\nused, indicating that men experience these symptoms in\ngreater numbers. This finding is similar to the work by\nM\u00f6ller-Leimk\u00fchler et al,17 which found that men and\nwomen met criteria for depression at similar rates using the\nGMDS with a clinical in-patient sample.\nDespitethesignificantfindingsreportedinthisstudy,there\nare noteworthy limitations. First, because this was a second-\nary data analysis, not all constructs put forth in the literature\ncould be included. For example, others have proposed that de-\npressed men commonly try to mask or ignore their emotional\npain by overworking, overexercising, or changing their sexual\nbehavior.24 These symptoms, along with other risky behav-\niors such as gambling, could not be assessed in the present\nstudy. Although a few questions regarding job performance,\nexercise, and gambling were available owing to the structure\nof the interview, using them would have resulted in an insuf-\nficient sample size. In addition, several of the included con-\nstructs were imperfect for this study. For example, the items\nthat assess taking chances and reckless behavior were not put\ninto the context of linking the behavior to an emotional con-\ndition. However, these items were still included because they\nwere the best items available. Future studies should include\nitems that assess the excluded behaviors. Finally, we cannot\nbe confident that all the symptoms assessed in our scale were\npresent during the same time period. Although most of the\nitems came from the screening section of the interview, some\nitems used a lifetime context while others were limited to the\nThe present study examined sex differences in rates of de-\npression.The2newscalesweredevelopedusingthebestproxy\nitems in the NCS-R item bank. Therefore, we are not propos-\ning that these scales be used in future study, rather we hope\nthat these findings provide evidence for future nationally rep-\nresentative assessments of depression to include measures of\ngender norms as well as expanded item pools.\nFuture studies may want to include measures of gender\nin addition to sex because often, when masculinity is mea-\nsured, the degree of masculinity explains more variance in de-\npression rates than does sex alone.17 Therefore, future stud-\nies trying to understand the differences between men and\nwomen in the prevalence of depression should include mea-\nsures that attempt to understand how masculinity and femi-\nninity influence depression rates rather than relying on sex\nalone as an indicator.\nUltimately, the results of this work have the potential to\nbring significant advances to the field in terms of the per-\nception and measurement of depression. These findings\ncould lead to important changes in the way depression is\nconceptualized and measured. Future iterations of this\nwork should build on the findings here to continue to\nexplore the relationship between sex, gender, and depres-\nsion. Our findings showed that men are willing to endorse\nthe alternative depression symptoms, leading to the elimi-\nnation of sex differences in the prevalence of depression.\nThe goal of this analysis was to explore whether the ways in\nwhich men and women experience depression is different\nfrom the way depression currently is identified in commu-\nnity surveys. The current depression criteria may be biased\ntoward detecting symptoms that are more common in\nwomen. Our findings, however, highlight that male-type\nsymptoms also are fairly common in women. Gender is\nlikely to play an important role in how men and women\nconceptualize and experience depression. Therefore, fur-\nther study is needed to clarify which symptoms truly\ndescribe men's experiences of depression. This study sug-\ngests that asking about irritability, anger, and substance\nabuse is important when assessing depression in men and\nwomen.\nAuthor Contributions: Study concept and design:\nMartin, Neighbors.\nAnalysis and interpretation of data: All authors.\nDrafting of the manuscript: All authors.\nCritical revision of the manuscript for important\nintellectual content: All authors.\nStatistical analysis: Martin, Neighbors.\nAdministrative, technical, or material support:\nMartin.\nStudy supervision: Neighbors.\nConflict of Interest Disclosures: None reported.\nAdditional Contributions: We thank the 5\nreviewers, who provided us with helpful feedback\non an earlier draft of this publication.\nREFERENCES\n1.
