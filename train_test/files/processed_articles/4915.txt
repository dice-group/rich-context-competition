On that very same day, even before flags nation-\nwide could be lowered to half-staff, the Senate Majority\nLeader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, released a written\nstatement announcing that the Senate would not act on any\nnomination by President Barack Obama. \"This vacancy\nshould not be filled until we have a new president,\" the\nRepublican senator declared.\nMcConnell's resolve is being tested by Obama's nomi-\nnation of Merrick Garland, but McConnell's threatened\nexercise of negative agenda power aims to preserve\nRepublican Party cohesion. Nominating an extremely\nqualified and ideologically moderate nominee might\ndrive a wedge between the conservative and moderate\nclusters of Republican senators. Senators facing difficult\nre-election battles might be tempted to defect from the\nparty position if forced to vote, and so obstructing the\nconfirmation process shields these senators from a con-\ntroversial choice.\nA strategic explanation for McConnell's actions, such as\nthe one in the last paragraph, depends on an implicit theory\nof how senators decide whether to support or oppose a\nSupreme Court nominee. This paper uses one such theory\nto forecast current senators' votes on Merrick Garland's\nnomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, in the unlikely case\nthat a vote actually takes place. The forecasts are necessar-\nily conditional, awaiting measurement of the nominee's\ncharacteristics, particularly his ideological reputation and\nperceived qualifications. Nonetheless, a model that com-\nbines parameters estimated from existing data with values\nof some measurable characteristics of senators--particu-\nlarly their party affiliations, party loyalty levels, and ideo-\nlogical \"ideal points\"--is sufficient to identify potential\nswing voters in the Senate.\nForecasting the Senate vote on\nthe Supreme Court vacancy\nScott J.

Cameron et al., 1990; Epstein et al.,\nmodels of senators' confirmation voting behavior and one\nmore complicated model. We begin by describing each\nmodel, then show how it performs on explaining senators'\nvoting behavior between the administrations of Franklin D.\nRoosevelt and George W. Bush. Comparing the three mod-\nels' performance at predicting senators' voting behavior for\nBarack Obama's first two nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and\nElena Kagan, reveals how the nominating process has\nbecome more partisan, so that models that pay insufficient\nattention to partisanship fit the current political environ-\nment poorly.\nFirst, the \"deferential\" model would emphasize the una-\nnimity that historically characterized the constitutional\nAdvice and Consent process. From Hugo Black in 1937 to\nconfirmed by the Senate.1 Senators cast 1906 yea votes in\ntotal, versus just 83 nay votes; the average nominee received\n96% of senators' support. Over the long run the deferential\nperiod covering 12 presidents and 41 nominations, the def-\nerential model correctly predicted 87.2% of votes.\nSecond, the \"partisan\" model would emphasize whether\nan individual senator shares the president's party affilia-\nmodel would have been successful on fewer than 63.9% of\nsenators' votes.\nThird, the \"Segal\" model has four explanatory varia-\nbles: the president's political strength, meaning that his\nparty holds a majority of seats in the Senate and that it is\nnot an election year; each senator's party affiliation in rela-\ntion to the president;2 the nominee's reputation in terms of\nqualifications;3 and the proximity of each senator's ideo-\nlogical position to the nominee's reputed perceived ideol-\nogy.4 These four variables plus an interaction between\nideological proximity and qualifications form a model that\nwould have been successful on 90.2% of votes on nomi-\nSo far, we have described the relative accuracy of these\nthree models in terms of in-sample validation, i.e. referring\nback to the votes that were used to generate the model's\nparameters. A recent perspective holds that we should use\nout-of-sample validation5 to judge models. King and Zeng\nstate, \"We must regard models that make causal inferences\nas also capable of forecasting. ... Scholars would do well to\njudge all models in terms of their forecasting prowess,\nregardless of the purpose for which they were originally\nvalidation would be assessing how well each model would\nfare at predicting senators' votes on future nominees.\nThe deferential model and Segal model fared surprisingly\npoorly in forecasting senators' votes during the confirma-\ntions of Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Both nominees\nwere portrayed in the media as highly qualified, and Obama\nwas a \"strong\" president, as Democrats held the Senate's\nmajority. If one used all nominees from Black through Alito\nto estimate the parameters of the Segal model, and then used\nthose parameters to generate forecasts of votes on Sotomayor\nand Kagan, the prediction would have been near unanimous\nsupport among Republicans. In reality, 31 of 99 senators\nopposed Sotomayor's confirmation and 37 of 100 senators\nopposed Kagan's confirmation. Forecasting strict party-line\nvoting would have correctly predicted 92.5% of senators'\nvotes on Obama's nominees, compared to just 65.5% for the\ndeferential model and 67.8% for the Segal model.6\nWhen examining political phenomena that take place over\nlong spans of time, models must account for dynamics: \"The\nonly way that forecasts can remain accurate far into the future\nis if the causal structure giving rise to the data remain stable\"\nout-of-sample predictions suggests that consideration of\nSupreme Court nominees has switched from a regime in\nwhich the president's nominee is presumed worthy of confir-\nmation unless his or her reputation or ideological position\nundermines that presumption, to a regime in which voting is\nlargely based on party considerations. Our challenges are to\nexplain the transition over time and to use that knowledge to\npredict behavior on current and future nominees.\nThe partisan dynamic\nTwo recent articles on Supreme Court confirmations rec-\nognized the increased role of partisanship on senators'\nvotes. Shipan (2008) noted that while senators in the pres-\nident's party have always been more likely to support\nnominees than senators in the opposing party, the gap\nwidened from less than 10% between Presidents Kennedy\nand Ford, to nearly 20% when Reagan took office, and\nthen continued to grow. Shipan used a counter variable to\nestimate the changing importance of party considerations,\nso his model can be extrapolated indefinitely, but ulti-\nmately his analysis does not identify a theory of precisely\nwhy partisanship has become more relevant to Supreme\nCourt confirmation voting.\nBasinger and Mak (2012) argued that party cohesion\nprovides both a theoretical link missing from Shipan's\napproach and an empirical measure of how important parti-\nsan considerations are to senators.7 Legislative parties'\ncohesion and partisanship in the electorate tend to be in\nequilibrium: as parties' brand names become more mean-\ningful cues for voters, reinforcing those brand names\nbecomes more imperative to legislators. As party cohesion\nrises, senators who belong to the president's party should\nBasinger and Mak 3\nbe more likely to rally around the president's nominees,\nwhile senators who belong to the opposing party should be\nincreasingly likely to oppose nominees. Thus, rising levels\nof average party cohesion explain the transition over time\nfrom a deferential regime to a partisan regime.\nBasinger and Mak (2012) also theorized that variations\nwithin each party should be influenced by individual sena-\ntors'levels of party loyalty. Members of each party who are\nmore loyal than average will be more likely to adhere to\ntheir party's position, while \"maverick\" or independent-\nminded senators will be more likely to defect. The most\nloyal senators in the president's party are most likely to\nsupport the president's nominee, and the most loyal sena-\ntors in the opposing party are least likely to support the\nnominee, all else being held equal.\nAverage party loyalty in a Congress and relative party\nloyalty (measured as the deviation from the average in that\nCongress) can be incorporated into empirical models as a\nmultiplicative interaction. We include each term separately\nand in interaction with a dummy variable indicating\nwhether the senator shares the president's party affiliation\nor belongs to the opposition party.\nTo estimate the parameters of the party loyalty model, we\nused all nominations in the dataset, from Hugo Black\nthrough Elena Kagan, and utilized a probit regression model.\nThe party loyalty model's estimated coefficients and stand-\nard errors are shown in the second column of Table 1; for\ncomparison purposes, we also provide the Segal model esti-\nmates in the first column of Table 1. A positive coefficient\nindicates that an increase in a variable's value makes a yea\nvote more likely, while a negative coefficient indicates the\nopposing effect. Using either model, a senator was signifi-\ncantly more likely to vote for the nominee when\nthe president was in a strong political position and as the\nnominee's qualifications rose, and a senator was signifi-\ncantly less likely to vote for the nominee when the president\nbelonged to the other political party and as the nominee was\nreputed to be further away in ideological space.\nThe party loyalty model adds two variables plus two\ninteraction terms: average party loyalty8 and relative party\nloyalty9 are included by themselves and as interactions with\nthe opposing-party variable. The positive coefficient for\naverage party loyalty indicates that the likelihood of the\nsame-party senators supporting the president's nominee\nincreases as the level of party unity rises. When we take\ninto account the interaction term (average party unity \u00d7\nopposing party), the likelihood of opposition party mem-\nbers voting for the nominee decreases as the level of party\nunity rises. Thus, increasing cohesion leads to a widening\ngap between \"typical\" members of two parties. Similar cal-\nculations can be carried out for relative party loyalty: more\nloyal members of the president's party are more likely to\nsupport nominees while more loyal members of the oppos-\ning party are less likely to support nominees, all else equal.\nThe party loyalty model out-performs the Segal model\naccording to several measures of in-sample performance. The\nparty loyalty model predicts more senators' votes correctly,\nby a margin of nearly 93% versus 89%. Since the null model\nclassifies 86.2% correctly, the party loyalty model eliminates\nmore than twice as many erroneous classifications.\nIn the section titled \"Models of senators' confirmation\nvoting behavior,\" we performed an out-of-sample analysis\nof model fit to augment the in-sample analysis. We can\nduplicate that analysis by using just the votes for Black\nthrough Alito to estimate model parameters. The Segal\nmodel's in-sample correct classification statistic is 90.2%,\nTable 1. Competing models of Supreme Court confirmation votes.\nSegal model Party loyalty model\nAIC: Akaike Information Criterion; BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion.\nNote: Cell entries are probit coefficient (standard error).\nEvery coefficient is statistically significant at p < .01 (two-tailed).\n4 Research and Politics \ncompared to 92.6% for the party loyalty model. When these\nmodel parameters were applied to predict votes on\nSotomayor and Kagan, the Segal model's out-of-sample\ncorrect classification statistic is 67.8% of votes, compared\nto 94.0% for the party loyalty model.\nTo substantiate the predictive superiority of a model\nwhich incorporates the changing importance of partisan\nconsiderations in Senate voting, we generated out-of-sam-\nple forecasts for every nominee in the dataset using both the\nSegal model and the party loyalty model. Figure 1 plots the\npercent of incorrect predictions for each model. The two\ntrack quite closely from Black through Breyer. After\nmargin), there was an 11-year gap until Justice Roberts was\ncan clearly see that the Segal model begins to deviate from\nthe party loyalty model, with a far higher error rate for the\nformer, for the four most recent nominees.\nIn summary, incorporating the average level of Senate\nparties'cohesion and the relative loyalty of individual sena-\ntors allows for more accurate predictions of senators' votes\nin-sample as well as out-of-sample. In what follows, we\nwill apply the party loyalty model to forecasting senators'\nvotes on the current nominee, Merrick Garland.\nThe known and the unknown\nWhen generating forecasts, scholars rely on a few known\nelements, and then make educated guesses to fill in\nunknown elements. Senators' party affiliations are known\nwhen the election is final, and rarely change mid-session;\nJames Jeffords of Vermont and Arlen Spector of\nPennsylvania provide notable recent exceptions. Because\nsenators' party affiliations are known and rarely change,\naggregate party affiliations can be computed, allowing the\npresident's strength to be filled in; James Jeffords again\nprovides the notable exception.\nThe characteristics of individual senators, other than\ntheir party affiliations, are also unknown but also can be\nestimated. Ideological positions can be estimated using the\npast voting behavior of individual senators (see Poole and\n(2012), who used the Common Space DW-NOMINATE\nscores, which are estimates of a single ideal point for each\nmember of Congress for his or her entire record of service\nin Congress, and which are updated weekly. The model's\npopulation parameters are unknown but can be estimated\nusing existing data.\nHistorically, individual senators' party loyalty levels\nwere not calculated until the end of a Congress, but\nCongressional Quarterly provided us with party loyalty\nLoyalty scores are calculated as the percent of the time that\nsenators joined their party majority on so-called \"party\nunity votes,\" which are roll call votes on which majorities\nof the two parties are on opposite sides.\nAlthough Obama's nominee is known, Merrick\nGarland's salient characteristics have not yet been\nFigure 1. Comparison of out-of-sample forecast errors.\nBasinger and Mak 5\nmeasured. Segal and Cover (1989) pioneered the practice\nof measuring nominees' qualifications and ideological\nposition using newspaper editorials. Faced with incomplete\ndata, we can still make educated guesses and consider vari-\nous alternative scenarios.\nConditional forecasts\nOur forecast of senators' votes are conditional statements,\nof the form, \"Suppose the nominee has qualifications Q\nand ideological position N; then a senator with party affili-\nation P, party loyalty level L, and ideological position S\nwill vote for the nominee with probability Y, given the\npresident's strength and the contemporaneous level of\nparty cohesion (L).\" Party affiliations for each senator (Pi\n)\nare known; we assign values of ideological position (Si\n)\nusing Common Space first-dimension DW-NOMINATE\nscores; we assign each senator's party loyalty level (Li\n)\nusing scores for 2015; we calculate the average level of\nparty cohesion ( L = 91.9) and then calculate each sena-\ntor's relative loyalty as Li\n\u00ad L; we set the value of presi-\ndential strength equal to 0, since Democrats hold the\nminority of seats in the Senate. We used the party loyalty\nmodel to estimate the model's parameters.11 In order to\ncompute Y, we need only insert values of Q and N.\nAs an illustration, consider two senators, the most con-\nservative Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and the\nmost liberal Republican, Susan Collins of Maine. These\nsenators'Common Space DW-NOMINATE scores are \u00ad.07\nand +.10, respectively, and their party loyalty levels are\nboth 63%, far below the average in the first term of the\nSuppose Merrick Garland's qualifications are per-\nceived as being as high as those of John Roberts (Q = .97).\nIf Garland's ideological position was reputed to be at\nObama's own ideal point (N = -.366 according to a recent\nestimate by Lewis et al. (2016)), then one would calculate\nthe squared distance between that point and each senator's\nideal point, and insert that value into the equation, and use\nthe standard normal cumulative distribution to generate a\npredicted probability. Manchin's probability of support-\ning a nominee with qualifications equal to Roberts and\nObama's ideal point is 99.7%, while Collins' predicted\nPerhaps it is unrealistic to anticipate that Obama would\nselect an extremely liberal nominee when the opposing\nparty controls the Senate. Moraski and Shipan (1999) theo-\nrized that the president and Senate would perceive that any\nnew appointment to the Supreme Court would move the\nmedian justice; with eight sitting Justices, the feasible\nrange of the new median is between the 4th nominee (pres-\nently Breyer, at N = +.007) and the 5th nominee (presently\nthe current situation as a \"Fully Constrained President,\"\nsince the median senator's ideal point, recently estimated at\n+.275, is on the opposite side of the Supreme Court median\nfrom the president. If Obama nominated someone whose\nideological position was reputed to be identical to\nKennedy's ideal point \u00ad which was the median prior to\nJustice Scalia's death \u00ad then Sen. Manchin's probability of\nsupporting such a nominee increases marginally from\nFor a wider set of senators, Table 2 shows the names,\nCommon Space scores, and party loyalty levels of the five\nmost conservative Democrats and the 17 most liberal\nRepublicans in the Senate. An asterisk after the name indi-\ncates that the senator is up for re-election in 2016, a condi-\ntion which applies to 10 Republican senators shown in the\nTable. Table 2 then shows the predicted probabilities of\nsupporting a hypothetical nominee with impeccable cre-\ndentials and three different ideological positions: at\nPresident Obama's ideal point, at Justice Kennedy's ideal\npoint, and at the median senator's ideal point. Notice the\nabsence of probabilities above 50% among Republican\nsenators in any of the three conditions. Interestingly, our\nmodel's predictions shown in the middle column directly\ncontradict the expectation stated by Cameron and Kastellec:\n\"Obama should nominate the best confirmable nominee --\na Kennedy clone... -- whom the Senate would approve.\"\nFigure 2 amplifies the seeming hopelessness of the\nnomination by showing the predicted probabilities of all\ncurrent Republican senators voting for clones of two sit-\nting Justices \u00ad Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\u00ad if they, instead of Merrick Garland, had been nominated\nby President Obama during the year 2016. Senators are\nordered by their ideological position, from liberal (left) to\nconservative (right). The graphs of predicted probabilities\nare not monotonically decreasing because the predictions\nalso take into account relative party loyalty, which is only\nmodestly correlated to ideological extremity. The figure\nalso includes 95% confidence intervals around the pre-\ndicted probabilities.\nSonia Sotomayor would not gain much Republican sup-\nport in the 114th Congress; just nine Republican senators\nvoted for her when she was confirmed in 2009, although\nthat includes Susan Collins, Lamar Alexander, and Lindsey\nGraham. Perhaps more surprisingly, Ruth Bader Ginsburg\nwould not gain much Republican support in the 114th\nCongress either, despite the fact that in 1993 she earned the\nsupport of 40 out of 43 Republicans, including Charles\nGrassley,OrrenHatch,JohnMcCain,andMitchMcConnell.\nFigure 2 shows that a Ginsburg clone would be more likely\nto receive support from moderate Republican senators than\na Sotomayor clone, due to her higher qualifications and less\nliberal reputation, yet the president's partisan label is so\nimportant in the present regime that no Republican senator\nis predicted to vote for any Obama nominee. Indeed, if we\nextrapolated the analysis to imagine Obama hypothetically\nnominating a clone of Stephen Breyer, Anthony Kennedy,\n6 Research and Politics \nFigure 2.

The Segal model theorizes\nthat ideological distance and qualifications are the primary\ndeterminants of senators' votes on Supreme Court nomi-\nnees, and so by naming a moderate and exceptionally well\nqualified nominee, Obama could attract sufficient\nRepublican votes to guarantee confirmation. This expecta-\ntion is na\u00efve given the current politics. With the Senate's\npresent composition, a successful confirmation requires\nthat there be zero Democratic defections, and at least four\nRepublicans plus two Independents must support the nom-\ninee. With partisan cohesion in the Senate at unprecedent-\nedly high levels, Obama faces little risk of losing any\nDemocratic votes, but gaining Republican votes seems\nunlikely, no matter how much political capital13 the\nPresident spends on the nominee.\nBy accounting for a more nuanced and refined under-\nstanding of the confirmation process, the party loyalty\nmodel reveals that any candidate that President Obama\ncould select, whether liberal, conservative, or moderate,\nwould be rejected if a vote was allowed to take place. So\nwhy nominate anyone at all?\nOur model of senators' political calculus incorporates\nthe nominee's qualifications and ideology, the president's\npolitical strength, the Senate's partisan environment, and\neach senator's party loyalty and ideological position. What\nis missing from the political calculus is the senator's beliefs\nabout the election, including their own prospects for re-\nelection, their party's prospects of holding the Senate\nmajority after the election, and their presidential candi-\ndate's prospects for victory. So few nominations take place\nduring the election year that it would be infeasible to incor-\nporate electoral effects into the empirical model. For now,\nthese factors must remain part of the disturbance term \u00ad i.e.\nfactors that affect the probability of voting for the nominee\nthat are unmeasured and/or idiosyncratic.14 The results we\ncomputed in Table 2 and Figure 2 capture the systematic\ncomponent of the data; Obama's hope for a successful con-\nfirmation must come from the stochastic component, that\nis, from outside the traditional decision-making calculus.\nAs the election approaches, un-modeled factors might\naffect Republican senators' choices. Swing-state senators\nmay sense potential electoral advantage from casting a vote\nagainst partisan gridlock; or, all senators might concede\nthat the post-election environment will be worse than the\nstatus quo, if Hillary Clinton is the likely victor and if she\nis likely to have long coattails. The fact that 10 of the 17\nRepublican senators listed in Table 2 are up for re-election\nin 2016 might significantly reshape their voting calculus in\na predictable yet unprecedented way.\nAuthors' Note\nAn earlier version of this paper was delivered at the 2014 Southern\nPolitical Science Association Meeting, on the panel: The Limits of\nExecutive Power.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\nFunding\nThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency\nin the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nNotes\n 1.

The \"same-party\" dummy variable is coded equal to 1 if the\nsenator belongs to the same party as the president, and coded\nequal to 0 otherwise.\n 3. Our final measure is a nominee's lack of qualifications, cal-\nculated by subtracting Segal and Cover's (1989) qualifica-\ntion score from 1.\n 4. The measure of \"ideological distance\" is calculated by squar-\ning the difference between each nominee's and each senator's\nCommon Space DW-NOMINATE scores. To place the nomi-\nnee and senators on the same scale, we regress the nominating\npresident's Common Space score on the nominee's Segal\u00ad\nCover score whenever the president's party held the Senate\nmajority. Next, we use the regression coefficients to predict\nnominees' Common Space scores using the linear equation:\nDue to concerns about the scaling of the first dimension during\nthe \"Conservative Coalition\" years, we replicated the analysis\nin Table 1 using ideal point estimates generated by Michael\nBailey.

We compute relative party loyalty for each senator by sub-\ntracting average party loyalty in that Congress from the sena-\ntor's raw party loyalty score.\n10. Although Angus King and Bernard Sanders are officially\nIndependents, we group them with Democrats for calculat-\ning average and relative party loyalty.\n11. The party loyalty model's out-of-sample forecasts have an\naverage forecasting error of five yea/nay votes for each con-\nfirmation. Out-of-sample forecasts failed to accurately pre-\ndict the outcomes of three nominations (Haynsworth, Bork,\nand Thomas) of the 43 in the sample.\n12. This prediction conflicts directly with the analysis of\nCameron et al. (2013) as highlighted by Cameron and\nKastellec (2016). The latter claim that hypothetical nomi-\nnees who are ideologically more conservative than Breyer\nbut more liberal than Kennedy could earn in excess of 50\nvotes in the current Senate; ideological clones of Earl Warren\nor Potter Stewart should earn in excess of 60 votes according\nto their model.\n14. Another factor that we must leave to the error term is public\nopinion on the nominee. Research by Kastellec et al. (2010)\nhas tied senators' votes to public opinion, showing that sena-\ntors are more likely to vote for a nominee--holding all other\nfactors in the Segal model constant--when voters in their\nown state view the nominee more favorably.
