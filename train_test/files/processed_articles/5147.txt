    "abstract": "Abstract\nBaby schema has been considered a key stimulus that triggers feelings and thoughts of cuteness. Kawaii is a Japanese word that\nroughly translates to cute in English, but its meaning appears to be broader than cute. Specifically, cuteness is often regarded\nas synonymous with infant physical attractiveness, whereas kawaii is used not only for babies but also for noninfantile objects.\nIn this study, psychophysiological responses were compared between two types of kawaii pictures: human babies and animals\n(kawaii with baby schema) or objects such as desserts and dress accessories (kawaii without baby schema). Twenty female\nuniversity students were asked to view various pictures twice. Both types of kawaii pictures were rated to be more pleasant\nthan neutral pictures, elicited a greater activation of the zygomaticus major muscles associated with smiling, and were viewed\nfor a longer period when the same pictures were presented again. The effect of baby schema appeared in the zygomaticus\nmajor muscle activity, which was greater for pictures with baby schema. The findings suggest that the word kawaii expresses\npositive feelings that are more generic than infant attractiveness and that are associated with a motivation to approach a\npreferable object.\n",

The word and the phenomenon have often been\nregarded as a representative of Japanese pop culture (Botz-\nYomota, 2006). Because various stimuli are expressed as\nkawaii, it is difficult to define what kawaii is in general. The\nword is often translated into English as cute. However, the\ntwo words seem to differ in nuance. Specifically, cuteness\nhas been regarded as synonymous with infant physical attrac-\nwhereas kawaii is used more widely referring to broader cat-\negories of stimuli that do not necessarily have infantile fea-\ntures. Because the word and the culture of kawaii are getting\nknown in the world and because more and more researchers\nare involved in the research on cuteness and use the term\nkawaii in their articles (e.g., Buckley, 2016; Dale, Goggin,\nLeyda, McIntyre, & Negra, 2017; Kringelbach, Stark,\nAlexander, Bornstein, & Stein, 2016), it is important to\nexplain the commonalities and differences between cute (in a\nclassical sense) and kawaii. Although the word kawaii is\noriginally an adjective, we used it as a noun in this article.\nPrevious studies regarding cuteness have revolved around\nthe concept of Kindchenschema (Lorenz, 1943). As an ethol-\nogist, he conceived that there is an innate releasing mecha-\nnism that makes humans feel cute and promotes nurturing\nand protection behaviors in response to particular stimuli.\nBaby schema is the physical characteristics that are typically\npossessed by young animals and babies, such as a large head\ncompared with the body, a rounded body shape, and a soft\nbody surface. Empirical studies have shown that infant faces\nwith higher baby schemas are perceived to be cuter (Alley,\nSprengelmeyer, Wiffen, & Perrett, 2010; Sprengelmeyer\net al., 2009), are viewed for a longer period (Parsons, Young,\nKumari, Stein, & Kringelbach, 2011; Sprengelmeyer, Lewis,\n(Borgi, Cogliati-Dezza, Brelsford, Meints, & Cirulli, 2014),\nactivate brain areas related to reward and emotional process-\ning such as the nucleus accumbens and amygdala (Glocker\net al., 2009b; Zebrowitz, Luevano, Bronstad, & Aharon,\n2009), and increase the motivation for caregiving (Alley,\nproducts (e.g., cars) with baby schema are evaluated to be\ncuter (Miesler, Leder, & Herrmann, 2011; see Cheok &\n1Osaka University, Suita, Japan\n2Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan\nCorresponding Author:\nHiroshi Nittono, Graduate School of Human Sciences, Osaka University,\nEmail: nittono@hus.osaka-u.ac.jp\nPsychophysiological Responses to Kawaii\nPictures With or Without Baby Schema\nHiroshi Nittono1 and Namiha Ihara2\n Keywords\ncuteness, baby schema, facial electromyogram, viewing duration, approach motivation\n2 SAGE Open\nFernando, 2012, for its application to interactive media).\nAlthough a few exceptions exist (e.g., Nenkov & Scott,\n2014), previous research on cuteness has mainly dealt with\nbabies or infant-related features (see Kringelbach et al.,\n2016, for a recent review). As the Japanese word kawaii is\noften used to refer to such objects, cute and kawaii have a\nsimilar meaning in this respect.\nHowever, there are other types of stimuli that are referred\nto as kawaii but are not directly related to babies. Ihara and\non 166 university students about 93 animate and inanimate\nobjects (expressed in either words or short phrases) that\nwere sometimes described as kawaii. Half of the raters were\nasked to judge the degree of kawaii of each item on a 5-point\nscale, whereas the other half judged the infantility of the\nstimuli. As a whole, a moderate positive correlation was\nfound between the mean rating scores of kawaii and infantil-\nity across the 93 items (r = .50). However, items also existed\nthat were high in kawaii and low in infantility (e.g., smile,\ncheerful person, flower, dessert, and dress accessory). In a\nsecond study, Ihara and Nittono (2012; see also Nittono,\n2016) searched for common psychological factors in the\nfeelings toward various stimuli that are often referred to as\nkawaii. Japanese university students (N = 180) were asked\nto imagine a scene in which they encountered each of the\nfour types of kawaii stimuli: those with baby schema (e.g.,\nbabies, stuffed animals), humans (e.g., smiling, cheerful\nperson), nonliving objects (e.g., desserts, accessories), and\nidiosyncratic objects that are not usually described as kawaii\nalthough the respondents personally feel them to be kawaii\n(e.g., lizards, mushrooms). They then rated their feelings\nand thoughts on six 5-point scales: two adjectives (kawaii,\ninfantile), two scales of approach motivation (I want to be\ncloser to it, I want to keep it nearby), and two scales of nur-\nturance motivation (I want to help it when it is in trouble, I\nwant to protect it). Results showed that the profiles of the\nsix rating scores differed in shape significantly across the\nfour types of kawaii, which suggests that psychological\nstates associated with these kawaii stimuli differ. However,\npartial correlation analyses revealed that higher kawaii rat-\nings were associated with a greater approach motivation, but\nnot with a greater nurturance motivation, for all types of\nkawaii. This finding is inconsistent with the baby schema\nhypothesis, which implies that the feelings of kawaii are\nlinked with caregiving and protection. Rather, the feelings\nof kawaii are related to a strong approach motivation to\ninteract with the stimulus.\nIn this exploratory study, we compare psychophysiolog-\nical responses with kawaii stimuli with baby schema (e.g.,\nbabies, infants), which are typical examples of cute stimuli,\nand kawaii stimuli without baby schema (e.g., desserts,\naccessories), which are less well studied, to understand the\nfeelings of kawaii more extensively. Because these pictures\ncan be regarded as affective stimuli, we recorded psycho-\nphysiological responses to these pictures by following a\nstandard research protocol of affective picture processing\n(Lang, Greenwald, Bradley, & Hamm, 1993). Subjective\nratings (pleasant, unpleasant, arousing, kawaii, infantile,\nand I want to approach), facial electromyograms (EMGs),\nskin conductance response (SCR), and viewing duration\nwere recorded.\nField observation studies have shown that babies and\ninfants make us smile and move us to approach them\n(Nishiyama, Oishi, & Saito, 2015; Schleidt, Schiefenhovel,\nStanjek, & Krell, 1980). When a facial EMG is recorded in\nlaboratory studies, pictures of babies elevate the activity of\nthe zygomaticus major muscles, which are associated with\nsmiling (Bradley, Codispoti, Cuthbert, & Lang, 2001;\neffect is not limited to living things. Miesler et al. (2011)\nmanipulated the front designs of cars to enhance baby schema\nfeatures (e.g., enlarging the headlights [eyes] and shrinking\nthe middle grill [nose]) and asked participants to judge the\nattractiveness and cuteness of the objects. When the partici-\npants rated cuteness (but not when they rated attractiveness),\nbaby-faced car fronts induced a higher level of zygomaticus\nmajor muscle activity. Another measure, viewing duration,\nalso varies with cuteness. Viewing duration has been shown\nand for high-arousal positive and negative stimuli (Lang\net al., 1993). Recent research showed that positive stimuli\nwere viewed longer than negative stimuli when the stimuli\nhad been presented before (Kron et al., 2014). When partici-\npants can adjust their viewing time, faces with higher baby\nschema are looked at for a longer period (Parsons et al.,\nstudies reported that the subjective rating of cuteness was\npositively correlated with viewing duration, but not corre-\nlated with the level of zygomaticus major muscle activity\nfacial EMG and viewing duration measures can produce\ndifferent patterns of results.\nBecause no standardized stimulus set exists for kawaii,\nwe presented a number of pictures to the participants and\nmade a post hoc selection of the stimulus sets that are con-\ntrolled in their levels of kawaii, pleasantness, and arousal\naccording to the participants' rating scores. By doing so, we\ncan compare the patterns of subjective, behavioral, and phys-\niological measures that co-occur in the same participants. We\nexamined whether the known responses to kawaii pictures\nwith baby schema (e.g., increases in positive subjective rat-\nings, zygomaticus major muscle activity, and voluntary\nviewing duration) also occur in response to kawaii pictures\nwithout baby schema. Moreover, only women were recruited\nin this study because women are more sensitive and respon-\nsive to cuteness in infants (Hahn, Xiao, Sprengelmeyer, &\nPerrett, 2013; Lehmann, Huis in't Veld, & Vingerhoets,\nalso Berman, 1980, for the importance of situational vari-\nables) and to kawaii stimuli in general (Nittono, 2016).\nNittono and Ihara 3\nMethod\nParticipants\nTwenty female university students (20-27 years old, M =\n22.2 years) participated in the study. All declared that they\nhad normal or corrected-to-normal vision. They were right\nhanded according to the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory\n(Oldfield, 1971). The protocol was approved by the Research\nEthics Committee of the Graduated School of Integrated Arts\nand Sciences, Hiroshima University. Written informed con-\nsent was obtained from the participants.\nStimuli\nIn total, 40 color pictures were selected from the Internet\nthrough a Google image search. To make the stimuli vary in\nthe levels of kawaii and infantility, kawaii and infantile pic-\ntures (e.g., baby), kawaii and less infantile pictures (e.g., des-\nsert plate), less kawaii and infantile pictures (e.g., preterm\ninfant), and less kawaii and less infantile pictures (e.g., adult\nmale face) were selected through a discussion among three\nfemale university students who did not serve as participants.\nThe materials and the data are available from the correspond-\ning author on request.\nProcedure\nParticipants were tested individually in a sound attenuated\nroom. The experiment consisted of two sessions. The partici-\npants first rated 40 pictures one by one while recording psy-\nchophysiological measures and they then viewed the pictures\nagain as long as they wished. This two-step procedure was\nadapted according to a classic study on affective picture pro-\ncessing (Lang et al., 1993). The pictures were presented with\nInquisit 3.0 (Millisecond software, USA) on a 21-inch cath-\node ray tube display placed 100 cm in front of the partici-\npants'eyes. Each picture extended to fit within a 30 cm by 30\ncm frame (visual angle = 17\u00b0).\nIn the rating session, each trial started with a screen with\na serial number for 2 s. Next, a fixation cross appeared for 6\ns. Then, each picture was presented for 6 s in a randomized\norder. During this period, facial EMGs and SCRs were\nrecorded. After the offset of each picture, a rating screen\nappeared. The participants judged their impressions of the\npicture on six 6-point scales (pleasant, unpleasant, arousing,\nkawaii, infantile, and I want to approach; 1 = not at all, 6 =\nvery much). Among them, the item I want to approach was a\ndependent measure of primary interest, whereas the other\nitems were used for post hoc stimulus selection. When the\nparticipants clicked on the \"Finish\" button, the next trial\nstarted 1 s after. A short break was inserted after every 10\ntrials. Two practice trials were conducted at the beginning\nwith pictures that were not used in the experiment.\nIn the free viewing session, the same pictures were presented\nagain in a random order. When the participants clicked on a\nmouse button, a fixation cross appeared for 1.5 s, which was\nfollowed by a picture. They were instructed to view each picture\nas long as they wished and click on the mouse button again to\nmove to the next trial, which started with a fixation cross. The\ninterval (in milliseconds) between the picture onset and the\nmouse click was designated as the viewing duration. A short\nbreak was inserted after every 10 trials. Four practice trials with\nfour different pictures were conducted at the beginning.\nPost Hoc Stimulus Selection\nAfter the experiment, the mean score of each rating scale was\nobtained by averaging the data of all participants (N = 20).\nBased on these mean rating scores, three categories of stim-\nuli were selected from the 40 pictures. Figure 1 illustrates\nsome examples of each category. Five pictures each were\nFigure 1. Sample pictures of two kawaii categories and the\nneutral category.\nNote.

The kawaii pictures with baby schema\ndepicted a human baby's face without an expression and\nbaby animals (chick, puppy, piglet, and white bear). The\nkawaii pictures without baby schema depicted blossoms, a\ndessert plate, macaroons, a wedding dress, and perfume bot-\ntles. The neutral category consisted of six pictures: an adult\nmale face without expression, a tadpole, a newborn croco-\ndile, scientific glassware, a men's suit, and a do-it-yourself\ntoolbox. The former three pictures were living things (as a\ncontrol for the kawaii pictures with baby schema) and the\nlatter three pictures were nonliving things (as a control for\nthe kawaii pictures without baby schema). The level of infan-\ntility was equalized between the neutral pictures and the pic-\ntures of the kawaii without baby schema. Because the total\nnumber of pictures was small, we could not set up two differ-\nent neutral categories.\nPhysiological Measurements\nBiosignals were recorded with a sampling rate of 1,000 Hz\n(filter settings: direct current to 200 Hz) using QuickAmp\n(Brain Products, Germany). The data were analyzed with\nBrain Vision Analyzer ver. 2.0 (Brain Products, Germany).\nFacial EMG.The facial EMG activities of the corrugator\nsupercilii muscles, which are associated with negative emo-\ntion (Lang et al., 1993), and of the zygomatic major muscles\nwere recorded bipolarly over the left eyebrow and at the left\ncheek, respectively, according to the guidelines (Fridlund &\nCacioppo, 1986). Ag/AgCl electrodes (4-mm diameter) were\nused. The recorded waveform was filtered with a digital\nhighpass filter of 15 Hz (12 dB/oct), rectified by reversing\nthe negative values into positive absolute values (Larsen,\nNorris, & Cacioppo, 2003). The mean value of the 6-s period\nafter the stimulus onset was calculated. Visual inspection\nconfirmed that there were no excessive artifacts in the ana-\nlyzed period. The mean value of the 1-s period before stimu-\nlus onset was used as a baseline. To correct for the positive\nskewness of the EMG data, the mean values were subjected\nto a natural logarithm transformation. The difference between\nthe baseline and the poststimulus period was calculated as\ncorrugator supercilii and zygomatic major. To understand\nthe time course of facial EMGs, the mean values of seven 1-s\nperiods from 1 s before to 6 s after stimulus onset were also\ncalculated without a baseline correction.\nSCR. The SCR was recorded with the canonical 0.5 V con-\nstant voltage method using a galvanic skin response (GSR)\nsensor of QuickAmp (Brain Product, Germany). Two Ag/\nAgCl electrodes filled with 0.05 M NaCl electrolytes were\nplaced on the volar side of the middle phalanges of the\nindex and middle fingers of the left hand. No highpass filter\nwas used for recording or analysis. The SCR was visually\ninspected and its amplitude (in \u00b5S) was scored as the differ-\nence value between the initial deflection in the period of 1\nto 4 s after stimulus onset and the peak within 5 s thereafter\nregarded as no response and coded as 0. To conform the\ndata to the normal distribution, the amplitude value (\u00b5S) +\n1 was converted to a natural logarithm. This transformation\nmakes the amplitude value of no response trials 0. The\nmean amplitude across trials was calculated including no\nresponse trials.\nStatistical Analysis\nFor subjective ratings, viewing duration, change scores of\nfacial EMGs, and SCR amplitude, the mean values were cal-\nculated for the three stimulus categories. A one-way multi-\nvariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with repeated\nmeasures was conducted for each measure. A MANOVA,\nrather than an ANOVA, was used because it can solve the\nType I error inflation inherent in repeated-measures designs\n(Vasey & Thayer, 1987). To correct for the positive skew-\nness, the viewing duration was converted to a natural loga-\nrithm. The time courses of facial EMGs were analyzed by\ntwo-way MANOVAs with the factors of stimulus category\n(3) and time (7). The significance level was set at .05. A post\nhoc comparison of means was made by Bonferroni t tests\n(two-tailed) with an adjusted comparison-wise significance\nlevel. Uncorrected p values are reported in the text, whereas\nsignificant differences after correction are shown in the fig-\nures. In addition, a picture-by-picture correlation analysis\nwas conducted. For each of the 40 pictures, the mean value\nof each measure was calculated from all the participants'\ndata (N = 20). A scatterplot showing the relationship between\nkawaii rating score and each measure was made. Spearman's\nrank correlation coefficient (r\ns\n) was calculated because the\nvalues might not be normally distributed.\nResults\nValidity Check of Stimulus Selection\nFigure 2 shows the mean values of subjective, behavioral, and\nphysiological measures for each category of pictures. As\ndescribed above, a post hoc selection of pictures was made in\nthe present study. To check the validity of the manipulation,\none-way MANOVAs were conducted. The pleasantness,\nunpleasantness, and kawaii scores differed across the three cat-\np\np\np\nrespectively. Multiple comparisons of means revealed that,\ncompared with the pictures in the neutral category, the pictures\nin both kawaii categories were rated to be more pleasant,\nless unpleasant, and more kawaii. No significant differences\nwere found between the two kawaii categories. The effect of\nNittono and Ihara 5\ncategory was significant also for the arousal score, F(2, 18) =\np\n2 = .285. Although the score was numerically\nhigher for both the kawaii categories than for the neutral cate-\ngory, pairwise multiple comparisons did not reveal any signifi-\ncant difference. The infantility score differed significantly\np\nkawaii pictures with baby schema were rated to be more infan-\ntile than the kawaii pictures without baby schema and the neu-\ntral pictures. In sum, these results confirmed the validity of the\nselection procedure.\nSubjective Ratings\nThe subjective measure of approach motivation (I want to\np\n2 = .893.

As shown in Figure 2, a multiple comparison of\nmeans revealed that, compared with the neutral pictures,\nboth types of pictures induced greater zygomaticus\np = .009 for kawaii with baby schema and kawaii without\nbaby schema, respectively. Importantly, the response was\nsignificantly greater for the kawaii pictures with baby\nschema than for the kawaii pictures without baby schema,\nFigure 3 shows the time courses of facial EMGs without a\nbaseline correction. A two-way MANOVA with the factors\nof stimulus category and time (seven 1-s periods) showed\nno significant effects on the corrugator supercilii muscles,\nF < 1.34, p > .289. Regarding the zygomaticus major muscles,\nthe main effects of stimulus category and time and the\n\np\np\np\n2 = .899, respectively. A test of the simple\nmain effect for each time point showed that, although no dif-\nferences were found at the baseline period, F < 1, the catego-\nries differed as early as 0 to 1 s after stimulus onset, F(2, 18)\np\n2 = .315. In this period, a significant dif-\nference was found only between the kawaii pictures with\nbaby schema and the neutral pictures. After 1 s, the three\ncategories differed significantly from one another. The data\nconfirm the findings of the change score analysis. That is,\ncompared with the neutral pictures, both types of kawaii pic-\ntures induced greater zygomaticus major muscle activity.\nMoreover, the activity was still greater for the kawaii pic-\ntures with baby schema than for the kawaii pictures without\nbaby schema.\nSCRs occurred rarely. The mean SCR frequencies were\nschema, the kawaii pictures without baby schema, and the\nneutral pictures, respectively. The mean amplitude (includ-\ning no response trials) did not differ significantly among\np\nPicture-by-Picture Analysis\nIn the analysis of category differences described above, the\nmean kawaii score was numerically higher for the kawaii\npictures with baby schema than for the kawaii pictures with-\nout baby schema. This slight, nonsignificant difference does\nnot seem to cause the higher zygomaticus major muscle\nactivity for the kawaii pictures with baby schema. To test this\nhypothesis, a picture-by-picture analysis was conducted.\nFigure 4 shows the scatterplot of the relationship between the\nkawaii score and each measure. The data are based on the\nmean values of 20 participants. For most measures, the dis-\ntribution ranges of the five kawaii pictures with baby schema\n(solid circles) and the five kawaii pictures without baby\nschema (open circles) overlapped each other. However, this\nwas not the case for zygomaticus major muscle activity. The\ndifference between the two sets of five data points was sig-\nnificant in a nonparametric Mann\u00adWhitney U test, U = 2.00,\np = .032. This result supports that, although the kawaii score\nvaried across pictures, the kawaii pictures with baby schema\ninduced greater zygomaticus major muscle activity than the\nkawaii pictures without baby schema as a whole.\nFigure 4 also shows the Spearman's rank correlation coef-\nficientsbetweenkawaiiratingandothermeasures.Significant\ncorrelations were obtained for subjective measures (pleas-\nant, unpleasant, infantile, and I want to approach), viewing\nduration, and two facial EMG measures (zygomaticus major\nand corrugator supercilii muscles). Except for corrugator\nsupercilii muscle activity, significant differences between\nstimulus categories were also obtained in the main analysis\ndescribed above.\nDiscussion\nThe purpose of this exploratory study is to understand the\ncommonalities and differences between the two types of\nkawaii stimuli with or without baby schema by comparing\npsychophysiological responses recorded while participants\nwere viewing the pictures of each category. The kawaii pic-\ntures with baby schema induced more positive subjective\nfeelings, greater zygomaticus major muscle activity, and a\nlonger viewing duration than the neutral pictures. These\nresults are consistent with the previous findings about psy-\nchophysiological responses to baby pictures (Bradley et al.,\nThe present study newly found that similar responses\noccurred also for kawaii pictures without baby schema. The\ndifference between the presence and absence of baby schema\nFigure 3. Time courses of facial muscle activities in response to\nthe three stimulus categories.\nNote. No significant differences were found regarding the corrugator\nsupercilii muscles. Zygomaticus major muscle activities showed significant\ndifferences between kawaii with and without baby schema. Error bars\nindicate standard errors of the means.\nNittono and Ihara 7\nappeared in the activity of the zygomaticus major muscles,\nwhich was greater for the kawaii pictures with baby schema.\nPositive Feelings\nBoth types of kawaii pictures were associated with a higher\nscore of pleasantness, a lower score of unpleasantness, and a\nstronger feeling related to approach motivation than the neu-\ntral pictures. These findings were confirmed by the picture-by-\npicture analysis. The kawaii score was positively correlated\nwith the scores of pleasantness and desire to approach and\nnegatively correlated with the score of unpleasantness.\nHowever, the mean arousal scores of the kawaii pictures\nwere not significantly higher than that of the neutral pictures.\nThis result is consistent with the rare occurrence of SCRs to\nthese pictures (less than 20%). Bohlin (1976) reported a sim-\nilar frequency of SCRs when participants listened passively\nto tone stimuli that were presented at a random interval of 20\nto 40 s. Therefore, the low occurrence rate of this study is not\nan exceptional case. An SCR is a measure of sympathetic\nnervous system activity and is known to be elicited by high-\narousal affective pictures, regardless of their valence (Lang\net al., 1993). The result of a subjective rating suggests that\nthe rare occurrence of SCRs is mainly because the kawaii\npictures were not arousing. Bradley et al. (2001) also showed\nthat pictures depicting babies and their family (\"Family\" cat-\negory) were rated as less arousing and induced smaller SCRs\nthan other categories of high-arousal positive pictures (e.g.,\nerotic couples). Shiota, Neufeld, Yeung, Moser, and Perea\n(2011) reported that viewing baby animals was associated\nFigure 4. Scatterplots depicting the relationship between kawaii ratings (1 = not at all and 6 = very much) and respective measures.\nNote. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (r\ns\n) were calculated from the 40 data points.\n8 SAGE Open\nwith increased heart rate and increased respiratory rate.\nHowever, Sherman, Haidt, and Coan (2009) argued that\nheart rate and skin conductance level, which is another mea-\nsure of sympathetic autonomic activity, did not consistently\nincrease from the baseline when participants watched a slide\nshow of baby animal pictures. These findings suggest that\nfeelings of kawaii are associated with a low-to-moderate\narousal state. In a review article on autonomic nervous sys-\ntem activity in emotion, Kreibig (2010) wrote that no conclu-\nsive statement could be made on the affection-related\nemotions because the amount of research was small. More\nstudies are required to understand the autonomic responses\nunderlying perceiving cute or kawaii objects.\nFacial Expressions\nConsistent with the well-established findings (Bradley et al.,\nthe pictures with baby schema activated the zygomaticus\nmajor muscles associated with smiling. In the present study,\nwe newly found that kawaii stimuli without infantile fea-\ntures also elicited a smiling response, although its intensity\nwas smaller than that of kawaii stimuli with baby schema.\nBradley et al. (2001) suggested that not all stimuli with posi-\ntive valence induce a smiling response. Specifically, family\npictures depicting babies and children induced greater zygo-\nmaticus major muscle activity, whereas other pleasant pic-\nture categories, such as erotic couples, adventure, sports,\nand nature, did not. Smiling is a social behavior affected by\nthe social context (Fridlund, 1991). Research has shown that\nlaughter, which is often associated with big smiles, is highly\ncontagious to multiple members of a group and has a func-\ntion of fostering social bonds with them, more efficiently\nthan one-to-one grooming (Dezecache & Dunbar, 2012;\nProvine, 2016). Given that smiling has a role in expressing\nnonhostility in the social context, it may enhance particu-\nlarly for pictures that depict or are suggestive of affiliative\nsocial relations.\nIn the picture-by-picture analysis, a positive correlation\nwas found between the kawaii score and the change in zygo-\nmaticus major muscle activity. More kawaii pictures elicited\na greater zygomaticus major EMG response. This finding,\nhowever, does not mean that the EMG amplitude of the\nzygomaticus major muscles can predict the intensity of the\nsubjective feelings of kawaii. Even when the subjective rat-\nings of kawaii were equivalent, the presence of baby schema\nenhanced the facial EMG response. A previous study also\nshowed that, although baby pictures elicited greater zygo-\nmaticus major muscle activity, the size of the facial EMG\nresponse did not correlate with the subjective ratings of cute-\nAlthough the two types of kawaii pictures differed in their\ninfantility scores, infantility itself did not cause changes to\nthe zygomaticus major muscle activity. Among 40 pictures,\nthere were infantile but not kawaii stimuli (e.g., a premature\nbaby who undergoes a medical procedure, children in horror\nmovies), which correspond to the data points at the upper\nleft corner of the scatterplot labeled Infantile in Figure 4.\nThe zygomatic major muscle activity was low for these\npictures (see the lower left corner in the scatterplot labeled\nzygomaticus major). Therefore, kawaii is a key factor for\neliciting greater zygomaticus major muscle activity.\nRegarding the corrugator supercilii muscles, no signifi-\ncant differences were found among the three categories,\nwhereas the picture-by-picture analysis showed a significant\nnegative correlation between the change score of corrugator\nsupercilii muscle activity and the kawaii score. The latter\ncorrelation is due to the pictures with negative valence that\nwere not included in the analysis of the category differences.\nThese pictures were associated with lower kawaii scores and\nhigher corrugator supercilii responses. The amplitude of\nEMG over the corrugator supercilii muscles increased mono-\ntonically with the level of unpleasantness (Lang et al., 1993;\nLarsen et al., 2003). As shown in Figure 3, the activity of the\ncorrugator supercilii muscles appears to be slightly lesser for\nthe kawaii pictures than for the neutral pictures, although the\ndifference was small and nonsignificant. In the present study,\nthe level of corrugator supercilii muscle activity was not high\nat the baseline because participants were in a relaxed state. If\nthey were in a stressful and negative state with elevated cor-\nrugator supercilii muscle activity, kawaii stimuli may serve\nto lower the activity level significantly.\nViewing Duration\nRegardless of the presence or absence of baby schema, both\ntypes of kawaii pictures were viewed voluntarily for a longer\nperiod when they were presented for the second time. Pictures\nof babies who are rated to be cuter or that have a higher level\nof baby schema are viewed for a longer period in a free view-\ning task (Hildebrandt & Fitzgerald, 1978; Power, Hildebrandt,\n& Fitzgerald, 1982) and in a task in which participants can\nlengthen and shorten the duration of picture viewing by but-\nThe present study showed a similar increase in viewing dura-\ntion for kawaii pictures without baby schema. This result is\nconsistent with the subjective rating of desire to approach,\nwhich was higher for both types of kawaii pictures than for\nthe neutral pictures, supporting the hypothesis that feelings of\nkawaii are associated with approach motivation. We used a\npassive viewing task according to a tradition of affective pic-\nture processing research (e.g., Lang et al., 1993). In a future\nstudy, this finding should be tested using an active button-\npress task described above that is conceptually more suitable\nfor measuring the level of approach/avoidance motivation.\nLimitations and Future Directions\nThere are several limitations in this exploratory study. First\nof all, the number of pictures presented were relatively small.\nNittono and Ihara 9\nThis was because we avoided boring participants with a lon-\nger sequence of pictures, which would reduce participants'\ngeneral motivation. A further study with a larger number of\npictures would be worthwhile. In addition, the present study\nused a post hoc selection of stimulus sets. This protocol is\nuseful to control variables within the group of participants\nactually analyzed. However, to increase the generalizability\nof the results, it may be better to predefine the picture sets\nfirst by a preliminarily survey with a larger sample size.\nSecond, only women participated in the study. Women\nare generally more sensitive to and interested in babies\nSprengelmeyer et al., 2009), although the motivation to see\ncute babies may not differ between men and women (Parsons\net al., 2011). One question is whether these gender differ-\nences exist for kawaii stimuli without baby schema. Because\nwomen are more interested not only in babies but also in\nkawaii things without baby schema (Nittono, 2016), some\ngender differences may exist. However, these differences are\nprobably more influenced by culture than by biology.\nThird, this study did not care for individual differences in\nkawaii responses. A previous research study suggests that\npeople with high empathy characteristics showed greater\nresponses to baby schema (Lehmann et al., 2013). Kanai and\nNittono (2014) showed that the relationship between empa-\nthy and feelings of kawaii was observed not only for babies\nbut also for inanimate kawaii objects, such as clothes and\naccessories, in which living creatures were not used as a\nmotif. In future studies, it is worth investigating how other\npersonality variables related to empathy, such as autism and\npsychopathy, are associated with responses to baby schema\nand responses to kawaii stimuli without baby schema.\nFourth, further research must examine whether the pres-\nence or absence of baby schema in kawaii pictures affects\nother types of behavior and physiological measures. It has\nbeen shown that viewing kawaii pictures with baby schema\npromotes careful behavior and narrows the focus of attention\n(Nittono, Fukushima, Yano, & Moriya, 2012; Sherman et al.,\nto test whether this effect also occurs after viewing kawaii\nstimuli without baby schema. It will offer an answer to the\nquestion of whether this effect is due to baby schema or due\nto a positive emotion with a strong approach motivation.\nConclusion\nTraditionally, cuteness is regarded as synonymous with\ninfant physical attractiveness. The Japanese word kawaii is\nused to describe babies and infantile features, but it is also\nused for noninfantile objects. In this exploratory study, we\nfocused on the latter type of kawaii without baby schema.\nBoth types of kawaii pictures induced a positive emotion\nwith a strong approach motivation (indexed by subjective\nrating and viewing duration) and a smiling response as\ncompared with neutral pictures, although the smiling\nresponse was larger for the pictures with baby schema than\nfor the pictures without baby schema. These findings suggest\nthat the word kawaii used in present-day Japan expresses\npositive feelings that are more generic than infant attractive-\nness and that are associated with a motivation to approach a\nproposal of baby schema, recent research has just begun to\nshow that the feelings of cuteness are not directly associated\nwith protection and nurturance (Nenkov & Scott, 2014;\nSherman & Haidt, 2011). The present study suggests that the\nconcept of kawaii (and potentially also the concept of cute-\nness) would be broader than the responses to baby schema.\nStudying about kawaii can be useful for developing a more\nelaborative model of the universal feelings of cuteness.\nAuthors' Note\nPart of this study was presented at the 16th World Congress of\nAnnual meeting of the Australasian Society for Psychophysiology\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with\nrespect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this\narticle.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support\nfor the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This\nstudy was supported by Japan Society for Promotion of Science\nReferences\nAlley, T.
