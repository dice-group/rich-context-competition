For example, Blacks\nappear to have a greater social acceptance of overweight,\nless body weight dissatisfaction, and higher body weight\nideals compared to Whites [2-8]. Additionally, emerging\nevidence in nationally-representative cohorts suggest that\nBlacks, and to a lesser extent Hispanics, may have lower\nrates of perceived overweight compared to Whites [9-11].\nIndeed, Kuchler et al [9] reported that overweight Blacks\nand Hispanics were significantly more likely to perceive\nthemselves to be at average weight, compared to Whites.\nInaccurate weight status perceptions have been posited to\ndrive obesity-related behaviors, such as food consump-\ntion and intentional physical activity [2,9-11]. Impor-\ntantly however, much of the data examining perceived\nweight status were collected prior to the secular shift\ntowards greater U.S. public awareness of the obesity epi-\ndemic and its associated comorbidities. A consequence of\nthis heightened awareness has been calls for greater physi-\ncian diagnosis and counseling for weight loss among over-\nweight and obese patients [12-16]. No previous studies\nhave examined racial/ethnic differences in perceived\nweight status remain after controlling for self-reported\nreceipt of medical diagnosis of overweight.\nThus, the purpose of the present study was to examine\nwhether racial/ethnic differences exist in perceived weight\nstatus among overweight adults (accounting for receipt of\nmedical diagnosis of overweight), using data from the\nSurvey studies.\nMethods\nThe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n(NHANES) is a stratified, multistage probability sample of\nthe civilian non-institutionalized U.S. population\n[17,18]. NHANES includes over sampling of Mexican-\nAmericans and non-Hispanic Blacks. Approximately 9965\npersons aged 2 months to 85 years were studied in\npants; we categorized individuals as: non-Hispanic White,\nnon-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, or other. Height and\nweight were measured using a standardized protocol at a\nMobile Examination Center (MEC)[19,20]. Body mass\nindex (BMI) was calculated as kg/m2; we utilized standard\nthresholds to classify individuals as normal/underweight\n(BMI>=30). Covariates included: age (in years); education\n(categorized in the three levels available in public release\ndata: less than high school, high school diploma, more\ncohabitating, widowed/divorced/separated, never mar-\nried), self-reported health status (excellent, very good,\ngood, fair, poor; collapsed into three categories due to\nsmall numbers), and; self-report of a medical diagnosis of\noverweight (yes/no). All analyses were limited to individ-\nuals aged 18 and older, who were overweight or obese,\nand did not report being pregnant. Statistical analyses\nwere performed using SUDAAN (version 9, Research Tri-\nangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). Sample\nweights account for differential non-response, non-cover-\nage and intentional over-sampling of some groups. Logis-\ntic regression was used to examine the likelihood of\nmisperception overall, by BMI class, and jointly by BMI\nclass and gender.\nPerceived weight\nParticipants were asked a standard perceived weight ques-\ntion, \"Do you consider yourself now to be overweight,\nunderweight, or about the right weight?\" [21,22] As all\nstudy participants were overweight (or obese), we consid-\nered those whose responses placed them in a combined\n\"about the right weight/underweight\" category to exhibit\n\"misperception\" or \"inaccurate\" perceptions of their\nweight status. Through use of this terminology, we make\nno attempt to suggest that respondents either intention-\nally or non-intentionally exhibited inaccuracies in their\nweight perceptions, as our data do not allow for the\nexplicit examination of this question.\nResults\nThe prevalence of weight status misperception varied by\nrace/ethnicity and gender. Across racial/ethnic categories,\nmen were more likely to misperceive their weight than\nwomen (Table 1). Comparing racial/ethnic categories, for\nboth men and women, Blacks were most likely and\nWhites least likely to misperceive their weight status. For\nboth men and women, across racial/ethnic categories, the\nprevalence of weight status misperception was higher\namong overweight, than among obese participants.\nAmong women, the prevalence of misperception was\nhighest among overweight Black women (40.9%) and\nlowest among obese White women (3.9%). Similarly,\namong men, misperception rates were highest among\noverweight Black men (66.4%), and lowest among obese\nIn multivariable analyses adjusting for all covariates,\nwere 70-percent more likely than Whites to misperceive\ntheir weight.

However, among obese participants, only\nBlack men had an increased likelihood of weight status\nto their White counterparts.\nDiscussion\nThe disproportionately elevated and steadily increasing\nrates of overweight and obesity among racial/ethnic\nminority communities [1] constitutes a major public\nhealth crisis. The major determinants of the obesity epi-\ndemic in all populations \u00ad dietary and physical activity\npractices \u00ad may be heavily patterned by sociocultural\ninfluences, such as the tendency to misperceive one's\nweight status. In the present study, we found that over-\nweight and obese Blacks, compared to their White coun-\nterparts, were disproportionately more likely to categorize\nthemselves as being \"about the right\" weight.\nOverweight Black men and women each had more than a\ntwo-fold increased likelihood of perceiving their weight\nstatus. Relative to Whites, obese Black adults were even\nmore likely to exhibit weight status misperceptions. These\nresults were independent of sociodemographic character-\nistics, traditional individual-level measures of socioeco-\nnomic position, and self-reported receipt of physician\ndiagnosis of overweight. Our findings highlight the\nimportance of more frequently incorporating sociocul-\ntural factors, particularly perceived weight status, into\nboth clinical and public health obesity reduction\napproaches for Blacks.\nRacial/ethnic differences in perceived weight among\nwomen have been previously shown; however, most stud-\nies have been conducted among relatively small, select\nsamples, including high proportions of college students.\nAmong the few previous studies conducted using nation-\nally-representative data, Paeratakul et al (in the 1994\u00ad\n1996 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals\nand the Diet and Health Knowledge Survey) showed that\nWhites were 2.3 times more likely than non-Whites to per-\nceive themselves to be overweight. However, the authors\nfailed to disaggregate the non-White category to examine\nwhether Blacks and/or Hispanics had higher odds of inac-\ncurate perceptions. In the NHANES III cohort, Kuchler\nand Variyam [9]reported that the prevalence of perceived\noverweight was lower among both overweight and obese\nBlacks, compared to Whites. Trends for Hispanic respond-\nents in the study were similar to those of Blacks; however\nthe prevalence of misperception among obese Hispanics\ndid not significantly differ from Whites. Kuchler and Var-\niyam's analysis was limited to the presentation of preva-\nMen Women\nOverweight OR (95% CI) Obese OR (95% CI) Overweight OR (95% CI) Obese OR (95% CI)\nWhite Ref Ref Ref Ref\n* All models adjusted for age, education, income, marital status, self-reported health status, and self-reported medical diagnosis of overweight.\nAll Overweight Obese All Overweight Obese\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2006, 3:40 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/3/1/40\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nlence data; however, this allows us to compare the\nprevalence of misperception in the NHANES III cohort\nsamples. Over a period of time characterized by secular\ntrends for weight gain in the general population, misper-\nception rates among Black in particular, continued to\nincrease among both men and women. Among over-\nweight men, the prevalence of misperception increased in\nall racial/ethnic groups (White: 8%, Black: 14%, Hispanic:\n22%); however, for obese men, misperception rates\ndecreased for both Whites and Hispanics by about 13.5%,\nwhile over the same period they increased by over 49% for\nBlacks. Among women, sizeable increases were seen in the\nprevalence of perceived normal weight among both White\nand Black overweight (44% and 52% respectively) and\nobese (16% and 21% respectively) women. However,\namong Hispanic women, a 5% decrease in mispercep-\ntions was seen for both overweight and obese women.\nWhat might explain the greater potential for overweight\nBlacks to misperceive their weight status? As has been pre-\nviously mentioned, considerable research evidence has\nidentified myriad sociocultural influences (e.g. heavier\nbody image ideals, fewer social pressures to lose weight)\nthat might be implicated [2-8]. An unanswered question\nconcerns whether Blacks' tendency to misperceive their\nweight status is a function of weight satisfaction, or a lack\nof awareness about the extent of their overweight. Given\nprevious evidence of Blacks' high levels of weight satisfac-\ntion, it is possible that responses to the studied perceived\nweight question may have been biased among those who\nwere more weight satisfied. Alternatively, our findings\nmay highlight a lack of awareness about the clinical\nthresholds for overweight and obesity; this limited aware-\nness may be influenced by the high prevalence of the con-\nditions among Blacks. We have previously speculated\nthat, rather than considering their membership in BMI-\ndefined categories, some Blacks might rely on social com-\nparison to make judgments about their respective weight\nstatus. Given that overweight and obesity among Blacks\n(particularly among women) has reached nearly norma-\ntive levels, such social comparison among the overweight\nmight negatively bias individuals' judgments about their\nrespective weight status. Whether this potential mecha-\nnism extends to Black men (given their lower absolute lev-\nels of overweight and obesity compared to women) is\nunclear. The mechanisms responsible for Blacks' weight\nstatus perceptions may be particularly important to dis-\ncern, given our finding that misperceptions persisted after\nadjustment for self-reported physician diagnosis of over-\nweight.\nWe were surprised to find that racial/ethnic differences\ngoing perceived weight remained after adjusting for\nadjustment for receipt of physician diagnosis of over-\nweight. Physician diagnosis and counseling for weight\nreduction among the overweight has increasingly been\nrecommended, [12-16] though its frequency remains low\n[23]. Given that Blacks remained more likely to misper-\nceive their weight after adjustment for the diagnosis vari-\nable, we hypothesize that some Black patients might be\nresistant to physician diagnoses of overweight. Generic\nmessages of a patient's overweight (i.e. those that do not\ndiscuss the clinical thresholds of overweight in some\ndetail, provide a description of the health risks associated\nwith overweight and obesity), or non-comprehensive\ncounseling may have little effect, particularly given that\nmany Blacks do not recognize the health consequences of\noverweight and obesity [11] and may not be readily moti-\nvated by weight-related aesthetic concerns. However, as\nweight status misperception may also protect against eat-\ning and body image disorders (which are less common\namong Blacks), misperception correction strategies\nshould be carefully considered.\nOur study has several strengths and extends prior findings\nin a number of important ways. First, rather than present-\ning only prevalence data, our focus was to systematically\nexamine sources of racial/ethnic variation in perceived\nweight status, adjusted for relevant confounders. Our data\nwere collected during the period of time when public\nawareness of obesity and its associated health conse-\nquences increased dramatically. One might have expected\nthe greater public attention to obesity occurring during\nthis period to have enhanced individual's ability to more\naccurately perceive their weight status. Of course, a\nnumber of considerations may limit interpretations\ndrawn from our findings. BMI as a measure of body\nweight does not incorporate body fat distribution, which\nmay be differentially associated with obesity-related\nhealth conditions by race/ethnicity. Furthermore, the var-\niable reflecting physician diagnosis of overweight was not\ntime-delimited (e.g., prior 12 months), thus providing\nsome possibility of temporal differences in the time since\nreceipt of diagnosis. However, responses to this variable\nare unlikely to vary systematically by race/ethnicity. Small\ncell sizes in some categories may have impacted our esti-\nmates. Finally, Mexican-Americans are overrepresented in\nthe NHANES category; thus, there should be cautioned\nown revelations made to other Hispanic sub-groups.\nCorrecting misperceptions of weight status may be neces-\nsary to actively and successfully engage individuals in\noverweight and obesity control efforts. As increasing\nattention is directed towards the treatment and preven-\ntion of obesity among racial/ethnic minorities, identify-\ning similar disproportionately prevalent sociocultural\ninfluences should be a high priority.\nPublish with BioMed Central and every\nscientist can read your work free of charge\n\"BioMed Central will be the most significant development for\ndisseminating the results of biomedical research in our lifetime.\"\nSir Paul Nurse, Cancer Research UK\nYour research papers will be:\navailable free of charge to the entire biomedical community\npeer reviewed and publishedimmediately upon acceptance\ncited in PubMed and archived on PubMed Central\nyours -- you keep the copyright\nSubmit your manuscript here:\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/info/publishing_adv.asp\nBioMedcentral\nInternational Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity 2006, 3:40 http://www.ijbnpa.org/content/3/1/40\n(page number not for citation purposes)\nDeclaration of competing interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nGB and KY equally contributed to the conception, design,\nacquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data,\ndrafting of the manuscript and have both given approval\nof the final version for publication.\n"
