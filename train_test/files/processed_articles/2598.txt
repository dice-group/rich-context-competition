    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Nearly two-thirds of US office-based physicians work in\npractices of fewer than seven physicians. It is often assumed that larger\npractices provide better care, although there is little evidence for or\nagainst this assumption. What is the relationship between practice size--\nand other practice characteristics, such as ownership or use of medical\nhome processes--and the quality of care? We conducted a national survey\nof 1,045 primary care\u00adbased practices with nineteen or fewer physicians\nto determine practice characteristics. We used Medicare data to calculate\npractices' rate of potentially preventable hospital admissions (ambulatory\ncare\u00adsensitive admissions). Compared to practices with 10\u00ad19 physicians,\npractices with 1\u00ad2 physicians had 33 percent fewer preventable\nadmissions, and practices with 3\u00ad9 physicians had 27 percent fewer.\nPhysician-owned practices had fewer preventable admissions than\nhospital-owned practices. In an era when health care reform appears to\nbe driving physicians into larger organizations, it is important to\nmeasure the comparative performance of practices of all sizes, to learn\nmore about how small practices provide patient care, and to learn more\nabout the types of organizational structures--such as independent\npractice associations--that may make it possible for small practices to\nshare resources that are useful for improving the quality of care.\nThe Affordable Care Act and initia-\ntives by private health insurance\ncompanies are driving major\nchanges in the ownership of physi-\ncian practices, the incentives prac-\ntices face to improve the care they provide, and\nthe processes practices use to improve care.\nMany practices are consolidating into larger\nmedical groups.1 Many others are shifting from\nphysician ownership to hospital ownership.2\u00ad5\nPractices are increasingly subjected to pay-for-\nperformance and public reporting programs6,7\nand are being encouraged to implement process-\nes used in patient-centered medical homes.8,9\nDespite these changes, and despite calls to focus\nmore attention on physician practices,1,10,11 rela-\ntively little is known about the comparative per-\nformance of different types of physician practice\nWe used data from a large, unique data set, the\nNational Study of Small and Medium-Sized Phy-\nsician Practices (NSSMPP),16 to analyze the as-\nsociation between an important outcome of\ncare--the ambulatory care\u00adsensitive admission\nrate--and key characteristics of physician prac-\ntices, including their size and ownership, the\nprocesses they use to improve care, and the ex-\nternal incentives they are given to improve qual-\nity and control costs.\nThe NSSMPP focused on primary care\u00adbased\npractices with nineteen or fewer physicians.

A patient-\ncentered medical home score was calculated for\neach practice as a percentage based on the proc-\nesses used by the practice.

Neg-\native binomial models are appropriate when the\noutcome is a count variable and the variance is\nlarger than the mean. Model 1 estimated the\nrelationship between practice size, ownership,\nand percentage of primary care physicians and\nthe number of ambulatory care\u00adsensitive admis-\nsions a beneficiary had in 2008. The second mod-\nel added the patient-centered medical home\nscore and the incentive variables. Model 2 asks,\nfor example, \"What is the strength of the associ-\nation between practice size and ambulatory\ncare\u00adsensitive admissions, holding the patient-\ncentered medical home score and other variables\nconstant?\" However, the score and other varia-\nbles vary by practice size, so we included model 1\nbecause it may be of interest to test the strength\nof the association between practice size and am-\nbulatory care\u00adsensitive admissions without\nholding the patient-centered medical home\nscore and other variables constant.\nIn both models we controlled for beneficiary\ncharacteristics, the hospital referral region in\nwhich the practice was located, the six-month\nperiod during which the practice responded to\nthe survey, and the percentage of primary care\nphysicians in the practice.

However, it has eight lim-\nitations.\nFirst, although it is based on a very large, ran-\ndomly selected sample of small and medium-size\nprimary care\u00adbased practices in the United\nStates, we cannot claim that it is a precisely rep-\nresentative sample, because no \"gold standard\"\ndata set exists that contains the population of US\nphysician practices.\nSecond, our study does not include practices\nthat are primarily composed of specialist physi-\ncians. Third, our study does not include practices\nwith twenty or more physicians. However, most\nphysicians work in practices with fewer than\ntwenty physicians. Although it is possible that\nmuch larger practices would have lower ambula-\ntory care\u00adsensitive admission rates, a recent\nstudy27 found higher readmission rates in very\nlarge practices. The national ambulatory care\u00ad\nsensitive admission rate for practices of all sizes\nis 5.5 per hundred patients per year.20 This rate\nwas 5.1 for practices in our study with one to two\nphysicians and 4.3 for practices with three to\nnine physicians (Exhibit 1).\nFourth, our data on practice characteristics\nand incentives are self-reported by a single\nknowledgeable leader of each practice.

Other studies of\nthe patient-centered medical home have includ-\ned only practices that volunteered to participate\nand, therefore, may have differed systematically\nfrom other practices.\nSixth, our incentive results should be inter-\npreted with the caution that we did not measure\nthe intensity of the pay-for-performance or pub-\nlic reporting incentives and had only a partial\nmeasure of the extent to which practices had\nan incentive to control the cost of care. Seventh,\nour data come from 2008. It is possible that since\nthen larger practices have done more to reduce\npreventable admissions.

Practices exposed to public\nreporting had somewhat higher rates.\nAs a sensitivity analysis, we ran both models\nwhile excluding the 10 percent of beneficiaries\nwho had only one claim with a physician in the\nNSSMPP sample. Results of this analysis were\nvirtually identical--the same variables were sta-\ntistically significant--to the results just pre-\nsented (data not shown).\nDiscussion\nIn our large national study of small and medium-\nsize primary care\u00adbased practices, practices with\n1\u00ad2 physicians had ambulatory care\u00adsensitive\nadmission rates that were 33 percent lower than\nthose of the largest small practices (having 10\u00ad19\nphysicians). Practices with 3\u00ad9 physicians also\nhad rates that were lower than the rates for the\nlargest small practices, although slightly higher\nthan the rates for practices with 1\u00ad2 physicians.\nThese findings were unexpected, since small\npractices presumably have fewer resources to\nhire staff to help them implement systematic\nprocesses to improve the care they pro-\ntient-centered medical home scores than the\npractices with 1\u00ad2 physicians (though not higher\nthan those with 3\u00ad9 physicians) and so appear to\nuse more such processes, but these higher scores\nwere not associated with lower ambulatory care\u00ad\nsensitive admission rates in multivariate an-\nalyses.\nPossible Reasons For The Differences Our\ncross-sectional analysis cannot determine\nwhether there is a causal relationship between\npractice size or ownership and ambulatory care\u00ad\nsensitive admission rates. Larger practices are\nlikely to have more resources to implement or-\nganized processes to improve care, and these\nprocesses are likely to result in better perfor-\nmance on process measures of care, such as ap-\npropriate test ordering for people with diabe-\ntes.29,30 But it is possible that small practices\nhave characteristics that are not easily measured\nAdjusted Ambulatory Care\u00adSensitive Admission Rates Across Practice Characteristics, Per 100 Patients, 2008\nPractice size\nPractice ownership\nAny risk for hospital costs\nPay-for-performance (range 0\u00ad3), mean value\nPublic reporting (range 0\u00ad2), mean value\nPatient-centered medical home score\nSOURCE Authors' analyses using data from the National Survey of Small and Medium-Sized Physician Practices and Medicare claims.

For ex-\nample, there is evidence that patients in smaller\npractices are better able to get appointments\nwhen they want them and better able to reach\ntheir physician via telephone, compared to larg-\ncians, patients, and staff know each other better\nin small practices, and that these closer connec-\ntions result in fewer avoidable admissions.5,15,31\nWe cannot fully exclude the possibility that the\nlargest practices, which had a somewhat higher\npercentage of specialists, had patients who were\nsicker and, therefore, more likely to have an am-\nbulatory care\u00adsensitive admission. However, we\ncontrolled for the percentage of specialists in\npractices and for patients' demographic charac-\nteristics and comorbidities, and we found that\nthe smallest practices cared for a significantly\nhigher percentage of dual-eligible patients and\nfor patients with more comorbidities.\nOther Findings To our knowledge, no study is\ndirectly comparable to ours, but two studies had\nresults that are relevant and broadly consistent\nwith ours, although their methods differed.\nMichael McWilliams and colleagues found that\nsmaller practices had slightly lower readmission\nrates (1.9 percent lower) than medium-size and\nlarge practices.27 The size categories in that study\nwere quite large (the mean number of physicians\nin small, medium, and large practices, respec-\ntively, was seven, forty-three, and 217), ambula-\ntory care\u00adsensitive admission rates were not an-\nalyzed, and patient-centered medical home\nscores and pay-for-performance and public re-\nporting incentives were not included. John\nKralewski and colleagues, in a study of Medicare\npatients with diabetes, found that smaller prac-\ntices had fewer ambulatory care\u00adsensitive admis-\nsions and lower overall costs of care.33 Use of\npatient-centered medical home processes and\nincentives faced by the practices were not includ-\ned in the analyses. Practices in this study ranged\nfrom 5 to 750 physicians, and size was measured\nas a continuous variable, so the performance of\nsmall practices in this study is not clear. In a\nstudy with results that differed from ours, twenty\nlower ambulatory care\u00adsensitive admission rates\ncompared to the average for all other physicians\nin their hospital referral regions.29 These practic-\nes are self-selected members of the Council of\nAccountable Physician Practices and may not\nbe representative of large groups in general.\nPhysician-owned practices had lower ambula-\ntory care\u00adsensitive admission rates than hospi-\ntal-owned practices in both bivariate and multi-\nvariate analyses--approximately 13 percent\nlower in multivariate analysis, although the ef-\nfect was somewhat smaller and did not reach\nstatistical significance in model 1. Kralewski\nand colleagues found higher ambulatory care\u00ad\nsensitive admission rates for patients with\ndiabetes in hospital-owned practices,33 and\nMcWilliams and colleagues found higher read-\nmission rates in large hospital-owned practices\nbut did not analyze rates in small and medium-\nsize hospital-owned practices.27\nHospital ownership would be expected to re-\nsult in a lower ambulatory care\u00adsensitive admis-\nsion rate if hospitals provided additional re-\nsources to practices to hire staff and implement\nsystematic processes to improve care.5,16 In fact,\nhospital-owned practices used more patient-\ncentered medical home processes than physi-\ncian-owned practices. But these practices never-\ntheless had higher ambulatory care\u00adsensitive\nadmission rates. Hospital acquisition of a prac-\nticemight disruptlongstandingreferral relation-\nships between the practice's physicians and spe-\ncialists outside the practice and might lead to\nother changes that result in worse performance\nby the practice and higher ambulatory care\u00ad\nsensitive admission rates.5\nWe did not find an association between the\nambulatory care\u00adsensitive admission rate and\nthe use of patient-centered medical home proc-\nesses or between that rate and pay-for-perfor-\nmance or public reporting incentives. Prior re-\nsearch has resulted in inconsistent findings\nregarding the relationship between patient-\ncentered medical homes and physician practice\nthat practices subject to public reporting of per-\nformance had somewhat higher ambulatory\ncare\u00adsensitive admission rates. The reason for\nthis is not clear, although it should be noted that\nthese rates are not typically used as a publicly\nreported measure of practice performance.\nConclusion\nOur results suggest that the common assump-\ntion that bigger is better45 should not be accepted\nwithout question, at least in practices of nine-\nteen or fewer physicians. Given physician prac-\ntices' fundamental importance as the base from\nwhich most health care delivery emanates, it is\nsurprising that so little information exists on the\ncomparative performance of different types of\npractices.12 Evidence on the relationship of struc-\ntures to processes to outcomes in physician prac-\ntices is scarce. More research effort and funding\nwould help to close this information gap.\nMeanwhile, public policy makers and health\ninsurance company executives might consider\nWeb First\nDownloaded from HealthAffairs.org by ${individualUser.givenNames} ${individualUser.surname} on November 01, 2017.\nCopyright Project HOPE--The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc.\nFor personal use only.

The Medicare Shared Savings\nand Pioneer accountable care organization\n(ACO) programs, as well as private health insur-\nance companies, contract with independent\npractice associations. In addition, the Medicare\nShared Savings Program offers an Advance\nPayment Program that provides large loans to\ndevelop ACO infrastructure to relatively small\nindependent practice associations or medical\ngroups with less than $50 million in annual rev-\nenue. Thirty-five Advance Payment contracts\nhave been signed to date. Regional Extension\nCenters--similar to those funded by the Office\nof the National Coordinator for Health Informa-\ntion Technology--could also be of use in helping\nsmall practices implement organized processes\nPhysicians in small practices have no negoti-\nating leverage with health insurers, so insurers\ntypically pay them much lower rates for their\nservices than they pay to physicians who practice\nin larger groups or are employed by hospitals.\nThis policy might be penny wise and pound fool-\nish if it drives small practices out of existence\nand if further research confirms that small prac-\ntices have lower ambulatory care\u00adsensitive ad-\nmission rates, and possibly lower overall costs\nfor patients' care, than larger groups.\nLeaders of hospitals and large medical groups\nthat absorb physician practices might consider\nwhether there are advantages to trying to pre-\nserve the small practice environment within\ntheir organizations, while providing resources\nto help small practices proactively improve care\nfor their populations of patients.\nSmall practices have many obvious disadvan-\ntages. It would be a mistake to romanticize them.\nBut it might be an even greater mistake to ignore\nthem, and the lessons that might be learned from\nthem, as larger and larger provider organiza-\ntions clash to gain advantageous positions in\nthe new world of payment and delivery system\nchanges catalyzed by health care reform. \nThe Commonwealth Fund provided\nfinancial support for obtaining Medicare\ndata and for conducting the analyses\nand writing the paper.
