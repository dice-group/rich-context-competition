As the oldest members of the country's 78-\nmillion-strong baby boom generation approach re-\ntirement, the public and private sectors, and the larger\nsociety, are pondering the social, political, and eco-\nnomic impacts that the graying of the boomers may\nportend. In contrast to the ``apocalyptic demography''\nscenario (Robertson, 1990) often favored by the mass\nmedia, proponents of a civic engagement perspective\noffer a far more positive assessment. These analysts\nargue that, with increased life expectancies and more\neducation than their parents, ``boomers will enter later\nlife with many healthy, productive years ahead'' and\n``have the potential to become a social resource of\nunprecedented proportions by contributing to the civic\nlife of their communities'' (Harvard School of Public\nIn 2004, the Gerontological Society of America\n(GSA) and the American Society on Aging (ASA) each\nindependently launched initiatives to examine and\npromote civic engagement among older adults.

We begin this\narticle with a brief review of the semantics of civic\nengagement and provide some historical background\non older adult volunteerism. We then demonstrate the\nutility of a critical gerontology framework, which\nbrings together political economy and humanities per-\nspectives to explore several unaddressed questions\nregarding civic engagement and older adults. As\ngerontologists and engaged scholars who are deeply\ninvolved in the conduct and study of an intervention\nsupporting civic engagement in older Californians, we\napproach this task as loving critics. Our goal is to\nbroaden the dialogue to include the problematic\nnormative and political economic dimensions of the\ncivic engagement discourse and, more specifically, the\npromotion of volunteerism for older adults. Only by\nasking difficult questions can we expand and improve\nthe options for those who take a civic engagement path\nin later life, while supporting those who do not.\nDefining Civic Engagement\nThe term civic engagement has been used in reference\nto a wide variety of activities, including voting, being\ninvolved in political campaigns, participating in paid\nand unpaid community work, staying up to date on\nnews and public affairs, and helping one's neighbor.\nCapturing some of this breadth, political scientists\nRamakrishnan and Baldassare (2004, p. v) define civic en-\ngagement as ``both political participation and civic\nvolunteerism.'' In the influential report promoting civic\nengagement among older adults, Reinventing Aging:\nBaby Boomers and Civic Engagement, the Harvard\nSchool of Public Health/MetLife Foundation Initiative\non Retirement and Civic Engagement defines civic\nengagement as the process in which individuals are\n``actively participating in the life of their communities''\nthrough voting, joining community groups, and volun-\nteering (2004, p.3). However, in operationalizing civic\nengagement with regard to older adults, the authors\nfocus solely on the activity of volunteering rather than\noffer a more extensive and multifaceted treatment of the\nconcept. Like many scholars in this emerging field, these\nauthors use the terms volunteerism and civic engage-\nment interchangeably. When civic engagement is re-\nduced to the act of formal volunteering, other activities\nassociated with civic life, including voting, engaging in\ncommunity activism, staying informed about current\nevents, caregiving, and having informal connections, are\nnotably ignored. Because this article focuses primarily\non civic engagement as the term is being used in the\ncontemporary discourse on older adults (that is, in\nterms of formal volunteering), we are unable to do\njustice to the broader concept here. The semantic issue\nbecomes important, however, as we explore the roles\nolder adults are now being encouraged to play in civic\nlife as community volunteers, the political and economic\nforces that underlie these roles, and the types of civic\nengagement that often are left out of the conversation.\nHistorical Context\nAlthough the promotion of civic engagement in\nolder adults has achieved considerable attention in the\nfirst years of the 21st century, efforts to institutionalize\nsuch engagement through volunteer programs may\nF. Kennedy proposed the development of a National\nService Corps to provide service opportunities for\nyouth and older persons. At the time, just 1 in 10\nindividuals was engaged in volunteer service (Freed-\nman, 1999). The National Service Corps was to have\nserved as a ``domestic Peace Corps,'' involving full-time\nservice for at least 1 year and providing living expenses\nfor participants, and aimed at addressing poverty. As\nFreedman explains, it was the latter provision that\nultimately led to the program's defeat in Congress,\nwhere segregationists characterized it as ``a back door\nto racial integration in the South'' (p. 84).\nGrowing pressure to address poverty in the elderly\npopulation, however, and the realization that involve-\nment of low-income elders in stipendiary service could\nhelp overcome conservative opposition to ``another\ngovernment handout'' led to the creation of the Office\nof Economic Opportunity's Foster Grandparents Pro-\ngram in 1965. Originally designed to provide minimum\nwage to low-income seniors working 20 hr a week with\nchildren in settings such as orphanages and hospitals,\nthe program today involves seniors of all income levels\nwho provide mentoring, tutoring, and emotional\nsupport to at-risk youth (see http://www.seniorcorps.\norg/about/sc/index.asp).\nTwo other federal programs fostering volunteerism\nin older adults also trace their lineage to the 1960s: the\nSenior Companionship Program, which gives financial\nsupport to low-income adults aged 60 years and older\nwho provide in-person services to other seniors in need;\nand the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, which\nconnects volunteers aged 55 years and older with\na range of service opportunities in their communities.\nIn addition to these three national Senior Corps pro-\ngrams, through which approximately half a million\nseniors volunteer (see http://www.seniorcorps.org/\nabout/sc/index.asp), a number of other entities have\nplayed an important role in promoting volunteering\namong older adults. Organizations such as the Execu-\ntive Service Corps (http://www.escus.org), the Experi-\nence Corps (http://www.experiencecorps.org), and the\nNational Retiree Volunteer Coalition (http://www.\nnrvc.org) have helped connect substantial numbers of\nseniors to volunteer opportunities in their communities.\nSeldom mentioned in the literature on civic engage-\nment and older adults, however, is another type of\norganization through which many older Americans\nwork to foster social change and promote social justice.\nOrganizations such as the Gray Panthers (http://\nwww.graypanthers.org), founded in 1972 to fight all\nforms of age discrimination and other social injustices,\nand the Older Women's League (http://www.owl-\nnational.org) work to change the systems that foster\ninequities in society. The Older Women's League's\nmotto, ``Don't agonize--Organize!,'' indeed resonates\nwith many midlife and older Americans for whom civic\nengagement means first and foremost building grass-\nroots efforts, coalitions, and broad social movements\nto create a more just nation and world. As we suggest\nin the pages that follow, in ignoring or discounting\nthe history and contemporary manifestations of such\nactivities, proponents of civic engagement in older\nadults tend to wittingly or unwittingly feed into\na historically conservative vision of volunteerism as\nan alternative to welfare-state programs.\nCivic Engagement and Baby Boomers:\nA Critical Gerontology Perspective\nOlder adults are being encouraged to become\ncivically engaged by volunteering in their communities\nin part because of the believed benefits of such service to\ntheir health and well-being. Three decades of research\non health and formal volunteer activity have indeed\nout, ``a positive, if modest, relationship between the\ntwo'' (see Chappell, 1999, and Morrow-Howell, Hinter-\nlong, Rozario, & Tang, 2003, for helpful reviews of this\nliterature). As these and other analysts note (cf. Musick\n& Wilson; Thoits & Hewitt, 2001), however, with a few\nexceptions, problematic research designs and the lack\nof information about diverse populations make it diffi-\ncult to ascertain how volunteering is experienced by\ndifferent individuals and communities. Further research\nclearly is needed to examine interactions between race,\ngender, class, and volunteering; how volunteering is\ndefined and counted; the differential distribution of\nbenefits; and the causal pathways between volunteering\nand health. At the same time, as we already noted, far\nmore attention also must be paid to broader questions\nconcerning the political economy context within which\nthe new emphasis on volunteerism and civic engage-\nment is taking place, the potential impact of this\nburgeoning movement on the perceived meanings of\naging and later life, and the ways in which the civic\nengagement movement, like the productive aging\nmovement (Holstein, 1999), may unwittingly devalue\nthose older adults for whom such engagement is either\nnot possible or not chosen. It is to these broader and\nfrequently ignored questions that we now turn.\nTo broaden the dialogue about these larger ques-\ntions, we employ a critical gerontology framework,\ndescribed by Baars (1991) as ``a collection of questions,\nproblems, and analyses that have been excluded\nfrom the established mainstream'' (p. 220). As Chris\nPhillipson and Alan Walker (1987) suggest, what is\nproposed in critical gerontology is ``a more value\ncommitted approach to social gerontology--a commit-\nment not just to understand the social construction of\nageing but to change it'' (p. 12). Critical gerontology\nhas been characterized as evolving along two paths\nthat sometimes intersect but tend to remain distinct\n(Minkler, 1996). The political economy path views\naging in broad structural terms and considers how\npolitical and economic contexts and factors such as\nrace, class, and gender interact to help shape and\ndetermine the experience of aging and growing old\n(Calasanti & Slevin, 2001; Estes, Biggs, & Phillipson,\nin contrast, is more concerned with putting ``a human\nface--and a human body and spirit--on ageing and\ngrowing old'' (Minkler, p. 470). It focuses on the\nmeaning of aging as understood from the inside out\noffer useful insights into the rationale for, and poten-\ntial pitfalls of, the new emphasis on civic engagement\nand volunteerism in later life.\nTraveling critical gerontology's political economy\npath, we begin by situating the new push for civic\nengagement and volunteerism among older Americans\nwithin its broader sociopolitical context: the politics\nof retrenchment that have been a central feature of\nAmerican political and economic life over the past three\ndecades. From this perspective, it is no accident that the\nview of older Americans as ``a growing yet largely\nuntapped civic resource for responding to community\nneeds through both paid and unpaid work'' (GSA, 2004)\nhas emerged with the decline of the welfare state. The\nfederal government's diminished funding for many\nsocial services and public programs places greater\nresponsibilities on already deficit-ridden states and\nmunicipalities, which in turn often call on individuals,\nfamilies, and volunteerism to help take up the slack. The\nrenewed call for older adult volunteers has emerged in\npart from this devolution, and it suggests a new twist on\nproductive aging models that have become increasingly\npopular in gerontology. As Holstein (1999) suggests, ``In\na society witnessing a shift in both political and moral\neconomics, the productive aging scenario can become\nthe unintended handmaiden for a political agenda that\ndelegitimizes old age benefits'' (p. 366). This too can be\nsaid for the civic engagement scenario as older adults are\ncalled on to be useful and to counter budgetary\nshortfalls through volunteering while their own safety\nnets are disintegrating.\nThe economic and political imperative behind the\nnew emphasis on civic engagement and older volun-\nteerism is acknowledged in a number of key writings in\nthis field in the United States (Freedman, 2002; Jirovec\nUnited Kingdom (Anheier & Salamon, 2001; Biggs,\n2001) that note the desperate economic need to fill\ngaps in services and systems now vacated or severely\nunderfunded by government. For example, Chappell's\nassessment of the impact of changing fiscal policies on\nvolunteerism rings as true in the United States as it does\nin her native Canada:\nThe devolution of service programs, previously\nprovided by government to the voluntary sector,\nhas enormously increased pressure and opportunities\nfor the voluntary sector. The partial withdrawal of\ngovernment responsibility has meant that adminis-\ntrative and financial responsibility for the social\nsafety net for vulnerable persons and groups now falls\nto the community. (p. 8)\nIn the United States, Jirovec and Hyduk (1998)\nsimilarly assert that we are ``in an era of diminishing\ngovernmental responsibility for the human services,''\nraising concerns among social welfare professionals\nwho are ``likely to have more involvement with non-\nprofit, voluntary agencies, and more duties related to\nthe development and evaluation of volunteer programs\nthat older adults may have to take the responsibility for\nfilling these service needs, stating, ``Growing social\nproblems and reduced public expenditures will demand\nincreased volunteerism. . . . Thus, our society may\nrequire the productive engagement of older adults''\nCivic Ventures founder and president Marc Freed-\nman (2002), one of the most visible champions of civic\nengagement for older adults in the United States, offers\na more positive perspective on the ``daunting human-\nresource shortages that exist all across the nonprofit\nand public-service sector.'' He suggests that older\nvolunteers ``might well produce a windfall for Amer-\nican communities in the 21st century . . . [and] along the\nway bring opportunities for greater fulfillment and\npurpose in later years'' (p. 86).\nThere is indeed recognition among scholars in the\nfield of civic engagement and volunteerism that the\neconomic imperative serves as a powerful motivator\nfor the current promotion of volunteering in later life.\nHowever, for many proponents of initiatives pro-\nmoting civic engagement and older volunteerism, this\nrecognition is not followed by a deeper look at what\nthe economic imperative suggests. Do the politics of\nretrenchment and devolution, and the resulting cut-\nbacks in health and human services, mean that older\npeople now have a responsibility to be productive and\nto give back to the community through civic engage-\nment and volunteering? Who is being served by\nrecruiting older adults in large numbers to fill these\nservice needs? If federal and state governments are\ntaking away resources that support the community\ngood, is the answer to have older people--many\nof whom have already been negatively and dispro-\nportionately affected by these cutbacks--step in to\nfill those unmet needs, thereby releasing govern-\nment of long-term responsibility? Does such a sub-\nstitution of resources even accomplish what it is being\nset up to do?\nAmong the few American scholars who have\ncritically examined such questions, political scientists\nTheiss-Morse and Hibbing (2004) argue that ``Volun-\nteering in a soup kitchen will help hungry individuals in\na town but will do nothing to address broader prob-\nThese analysts assert that a narrow focus on volunteer-\ning, viewed by many as a helping activity and not\na political activity, serves to devalue and detract from\nthe necessity of other types of civic engagement, such as\npolitical involvement to promote increased governmen-\ntal responsibility and action to address basic human\nneeds. As social historian Theodore Roszak (2001)\nfurther points out,\n[V]olunteerism is not politically neutral; it has\nalways been closely linked to conservative values\nas the glowing alternative to mandatory govern-\nment programs. Voluntary service is the rich man's\nsubstitute for the welfare state and is often falsely\nopposed to government, as if the two must be at\nFrom this perspective, presenting older volunteers as\na primary resource for addressing fundamental social\nand economic problems is misleading and dangerous,\nletting government off the hook in the provision of\nbasic goods and services for the community and, in\nparticular, for its most vulnerable members.\nIn his critical look at the emergence of social policies\nand public discourse promoting volunteerism and\nproductive or positive aging in Britain, Biggs (2001)\noffers a similar analysis. Utilizing a critical narrativity\nframework, he asks, ``How does social policy, and the\nstories it tells, influence the spaces in which we might\ngrow old?'' (p. 303). Bringing to bear both political\neconomy and humanities perspectives, he examines\nwhy and how ``the British Government has embarked\nupon a large, if not to say baffling, array of initiatives\nto promote positive aging'' (p. 307). Similar to the\nproductive aging discourse in the United States, the\npositive aging perspective in Britain evolved in part\nas images of aging as frailty and dependence on the\nwelfare state gave way in the 1990s to new perceptions\nof the elderly as a potent ``grey market'' with ``the\ncapacity to participate much more effectively in a\nvariety of social arenas than we previously thought\npossible'' (p. 307). In Britain, as in other parts of\nWestern Europe and the United States, the ``aging\npopulation is being redefined as a social, political and\neconomic opportunity'' (p. 310), with older citizens\nvalued for their ability to contribute to the market\neconomy through paid or unpaid workforce participa-\ntion. The emerging social policies promoting paid work\nand volunteer opportunities for older adults both create\nand reflect a new public discourse on what it means to\nbe old. In Biggs' words,\nWe are told a story of autonomous older people,\nactively involved in their communities, achieving joy\nthrough the return of work and voluntary activities.\nIt also appears that later life is being defined as\na relatively homogeneous part of the life course,\nbeginning at approximately age 50. Work-like\nactivities are presented as a sort of social therapy\nthat capitalizes on postmodern aging and simulta-\nneously draws older people back into the social\nmainstream. Another marginalized group is saved!\nThe danger of this story is that it ignores the\ndiversity of the aging population, the ways in which\nsociety's structural and social forces advance opportu-\nnities for some and limit them for others, and the\neconomic and political incentives for utilizing older\nvolunteers. Further, it ignores the effects of this social\nconstruction of aging, as defined by one's productivity,\non the lives of those who are growing old. By putting\nforth a view of volunteerism and lifelong labor as\nnormative ideals to which older people should aspire,\nsociety tacitly devalues the worth of those older people\nwho cannot or choose not to engage in such activity.\nIt is in the latter regard that the humanities path in\ncritical gerontology offers useful insights, attending as\nit does to questions of how we value aging and raising\nquestions of the meaning of later life from the\nperspective of those who live it.\nSuch questions were cast in stark relief by ``Mary,''\nan older woman who called in to a radio talk show\nfeaturing civic engagement proponent and scholar\nMarc Freedman (2002). As he tells the story, Mary\ndisagreed with his perspective on the healthiness and\ndesirability of being productive in late life. In Freed-\nman's words, ``She was someone who had worked hard\nsince age 16, for more than 40 years functioning as\na paragon of productivity, only opting to put on the\nbrakes when her boss persisted in heaping greater and\ngreater responsibility on her. Finally, she said, `That's\nit,' and retired'' (p. 87). Freedman explained that Mary\nwas exhausted and ``was offended by what sounded\nlike my exhortation to take on more duties, make\ncontributions, do more work'' (p. 87). He acknowl-\nedged the validity of this woman's concern, and\nexplained that his intention is to ``expand opportunities\nand options, not obligations . . . [to] widen the range of\ncompelling pathways available to individuals in later\nFreedman's response to Mary is commendable in\nsuggesting that volunteerism and civic engagement\nshould be viewed as opening new opportunities, not an\nadmonition to follow a particular path. However, the\nquestions of how this promotion of productivity may\nbe read as expectations and how this may then affect\nthe lives of older adults like Mary remain unaddressed.\nFurthermore, the issue is oversimplified, and therefore\nmissed, when it is reduced to being a matter of choice.\nFreedman suggests, ``Not everyone will want to pursue\npublic service in later life. Some will prefer to hit the\n[golf] links, while others will choose to do nothing\nat all. It is their privilege'' (p. 87). This assertion that\n``it is their privilege'' not to volunteer misses the fact\nthat some older people do not have a choice due in\npart to their lack of privilege in a market economy\nthat discriminates against people by class, race,\ngender, age, and health status (Estes et al., 2003;\nQuadagno & Reid, 1999). For many, having to serve\nas a full-time caregiver for a partner or parent with\nAlzheimer's disease, unexpectedly being called upon\nto raise one's grandchildren, or having to work in\na minimum-wage job simply to make ends meet may\nsharply constrain choice in relation to valued volun-\nteer activities.\nIn their recent study, The Ties that Bind: Changing\nDemographics and Civic Engagement in California,\nRamakrishnan and Baldassare (2004) explore the\ndifferential involvement of diverse communities in civic\nvolunteerism and political activities. In examining the\nissue of choice, they give this explanation:\n[A]lthough civic engagement may involve acts of\nindividual choice, these choices are often structured\nby various social, economic, and institutional\nfactors. Thus, for instance, poverty and lack of\neducation mean fewer skills that are relevant to\npolitical participation and fewer opportunities to\nbe mobilized into participation in political activities\nand volunteerism. (p. 1)\nA critical gerontology framework enables us to raise\nimportant questions about how the burgeoning move-\nment for late-life volunteerism sits within a political\nand historical context, and to consider the ways in\nwhich social and structural factors influence one's choice\nor ability to volunteer or be productive in a socially\nvalued manner. Within a humanities context, we also\nmust ask how the emphasis on volunteering as a desir-\nable, or even required, activity to achieve a more mean-\ningful later life may affect the self-images of older people\nand society's images of what aging should look like. In\nhis critique of Britain's policy narrative that emphasizes\ncivic engagement and active aging as the means by which\nan older life has social value, Biggs (2001) points out\nthat other meaningful and very personal experiences of\nlate life are thereby devalued and even contradicted:\nInterpretations of the life tasks of maturity that\nemphasize other potentialities surrounding aging--\nspirituality (Howse, 1999), gero-transcendence\n(Tornstam, 1996), ``the well-earned rest'' and\ncontemplation through ``coming to terms with\noneself''--may not be compatible with an active/\npositive narrative of productive aging. (p. 313)\nSimilarly, Holstein (1999) points to research in\ncultural psychology, anthropology, and philosophy\nthat suggests ``cultural messages which elevate an ideal\nof productive aging can easily subvert--or, at a mini-\nmum, complicate--an older person's ability to find\ncoherence and purpose in the face of frailty and dis-\nability'' (p. 367). In addition to preventing individuals\nfrom embracing all the possibilities of the aging process,\nnotions like productive aging and civic engagement\nin later life may limit what gerontologists and society\ncan learn about aging and may contribute to a less\nrespectful view of older persons. In Holstein's words,\nBy assuming the desirability of productivity and\nreducing the vision of an aging society to it,\nadvocates bypass a critical task--to understand\naging in all its manifestations and to respect elders\nnot only when they are contributing in any way\nelucidated to date, but also when they become more\nThe growing movement to institutionalize volun-\nteering and civic engagement among older Americans\nmust be approached with thoughtfulness and a critical\neye for whether such efforts are as healthy and\nempowering as current promotions suggest. The\nauthors of Reinventing Aging engage in some reflection\non the dangers of the active aging paradigm, stating\nthat, in an attempt to counter previous decline and loss\nimages of late life, ``society may have too willingly\nembraced the contrasting image of the `active senior'--\nindefatigable, healthy, usually wealthy, and eternally\nyoung'' (Harvard School of Public Health/MetLife\nFoundation, 2004, p. 5). However, the authors do not\nretreat from their presumption of productive aging as\nbeing desirable, good, and empowering. As they assert,\nProductive aging will require careful planning by\nindividual boomers. An organized effort could help\nboomers envision, and plan for, a life that achieves\nmeaning in their later years by connecting in new\nways to the larger community around them. (p. 5)\nThe implication here is that, without a plan for\nproductivity, one cannot have ``a life that achieves\nmeaning in their later years.'' Again, this paradigm\nignores other ways of achieving meaning, fulfillment,\nand peace as one ages.\nWithout underplaying the value of civic engagement\nand volunteerism for those who choose such a path in\nlater life, and the value of efforts such as the GSA's\nrecent initiative to expand options for such engagement,\nwe caution that an overemphasis on civic engagement\nand volunteerism in later life, like the earlier emphasis\non productive aging, can contribute to the stigmatiza-\ntion and disempowerment of those elders who fail to\nmeet our criteria for ``a good old age'' (Cruikshank,\nstigmatization and disempowerment may negatively\nimpact the well-being of individuals and communities,\nas it implicitly suggests that older people may be of\nlesser value if they are not able to contribute, whether\nin paid or unpaid capacities, in the market economy.\nSummary and Conclusion\nFrom our stance as loving critics, we have used\na critical gerontology framework to highlight some\nof the less frequently asked questions regarding the\nmeaning and significance of the new emphasis on civic\nengagement and older adults. Although we did not\nintend this discussion as a detailed treatment of these\nissues, we offered it as an attempt to broaden the\ndialogue on civic engagement and older adults and to\nmove it into some largely uncharted terrain.\nAlthough this conversation remains in its infancy,\nseveral initial recommendations may be offered. First,\nalthough volunteerism and other forms of civic\nengagement should not be required of older adults,\nthose who are interested in participating should be\nencouraged and enabled to do so. For low-income\nindividuals who wish to volunteer but for whom there\nmay be economic impediments, the provision of\ngovernment stipends to make such participation\npossible should be expanded. At minimum, reimburse-\nment for transportation and other volunteer-related\nexpenses should be provided to those for whom desired\nparticipation might otherwise be a hardship.\nSecond, and at the same time, we should be critically\naware of how programs stressing civic engagement\nand volunteerism in older adults may impact and reflect\nthe social significance of later life. In the words of\nter Meulen and colleagues (1994), ``The societal role\nassigned to the elderly and the public programs\ndeveloped on their behalf, will not only influence the\nself-perception of the aged, but will also project\na picture of the value placed on them by society'' (p.\nS10). To help foster such critical awareness, the forums\nin which the virtues of civic engagement and older\nadults increasingly are being discussed should be\nexpanded to include frank discussions of the potential\npitfalls and limitations of this approach, and how these\nmay be addressed.\nThird, we must consciously expand conventional\nnotions of civic engagement to include the work of\norganizations such as the Gray Panthers and other\ngrassroots movements led by older adults that focus on\nbroad social change objectives. As Gray Panthers\nfounder Maggie Kuhn (1991) asserted, ``The old,\nhaving the benefit of life experience, the time to get\nthings done, and the least to lose by sticking their necks\nout, [are] in a perfect position to serve as advocates for\nthe larger public good'' (p. 38). All too often, such\nefforts are left out of the discourse on civic engagement,\nwhose political roots have favored individually focused\nsocial betterment over broader institutional and policy-\nlevel change initiatives.\nFinally, the creation of an environment honoring\nand enabling diverse civic engagement opportunities\nmust be broadened still further to respect those elders\nwho do not volunteer, for whatever reasons, in order\nthat we may embrace aging in all its forms, lives,\nabilities, and meanings. For in last analysis, a real\ncommitment to a good and satisfying later life would\nmean ``recognizing and reinforcing the essential mean-\ning of old age,'' which transcends things such as\nwhether or not people volunteer and involves more\nfundamentally the right to flourish and grow and ``live\na good old age'' in whatever ways are possible and\nhonoring environment means involving older people, in\nall their diversity, in determining how our social\ninstitutions and ways of living can reflect a broader\nappreciation for all older adults, regardless of whether\nor not they are civically engaged.\nAs gerontologists, we must continue to advocate for\nand develop programs and policies that promote an\nenvironment respectful of older people for who they\nare, not simply for what they can contribute. Such an\nenvironment would enable older people to live with\ndignity and to create their own meanings for later life.\nFor some, that will include volunteer work and other\nforms of civic engagement.
