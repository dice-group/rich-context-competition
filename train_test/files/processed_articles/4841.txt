Presence of KLF6 and the antigen Ki-67 in malignant melanoma and\nhealthy tissue samples from each patient was detected by immunohistochemistry. The proliferation\nindex was calculated on the basis of Ki-67 expression. The relationship between KLF6 and\nclinicopathological characteristics was also analysed.\nResults: KLF6 was detected more frequently in normal healthy skin tissue compared with\ncutaneous malignant melanoma lesions (n \u00bc 40). There was a negative correlation between the\npresence of KLF6 and the proliferation index. The presence of KLF6 was also significantly\ncorrelated with tumour diameter, lymph node metastasis, tumour\u00adnode\u00admetastasis stage and\n3-year survival rate.\nConclusions: KLF6 protein is downregulated in human cutaneous malignant melanoma lesions\ncompared with healthy skin tissue. KLF6 may be involved in tumour progression and may be a\ntumour suppressor and prognostic marker for cutaneous malignant melanoma.\n",

The present study\naimed to investigate the presence of KLF6\nprotein in patients with cutaneous malig-\nnant melanoma and to examine the\nrelationship between KLF6, clinicopatholo-\ngical characteristics, cell proliferation and\nsurvival.\nMaterials and methods\nTissue samples and clinical\ndata collection\nComplete pathological data were retrospect-\nively collected from consecutive patients\nwith cutaneous malignant melanoma, trea-\nted at the Department of Dermatology and\nPathology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong\nUniversity, Jinan, China between January\npatients had received preoperative antic-\nancer treatment. There were no other spe-\ncific inclusion or exclusion criteria for the\nstudy. Tissue samples were obtained from\nincluded cases: samples were fixed in 10%\nneutral formalin and embedded in paraffin\nwax before sections of 3-mm thickness were\ncut and transferred onto slides. The diagno-\nsis of cutaneous malignant melanoma was\nconfirmed by histological analysis, accord-\ning to the World Health Organization\nclassification of skin tumours;9 tumour\u00ad\nnode\u00admetastasis (TNM) stage was also\nconfirmed.10 Control specimens were\nobtained from areas of healthy unaffected\nskin tissue, taken from the same patients\n(healthy tissue sites were 3 cm away from the\nmelanoma tissue).\nThe study protocol was approved by the\nEthics Review Committee of Qilu Hospital,\nShandong University and all patients pro-\nvided written informed consent.\nImmunohistochemistry of KLF6 and Ki-67\nThe presence of KLF6 in malignant melan-\noma tissues was analysed by immunohisto-\nchemistry. The proliferative rate of tumour\ncells was determined by immunohistochem-\nistry analysis of the nuclear antigen Ki-67.\nSections (3 mm thick) were deparaffinized\ntwice (10 min each) in dimethylbenzene and\nrehydrated through graded concentrations\nof ethanol. Slides were incubated in\n0.001 mol/l ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid\n(pH 8.0) and underwent high-pressure steam\nantigen retrieval for 5 min. Tissue sections\nwere then incubated in rabbit antihuman\nKLF6 monoclonal antibodies (Abcam,\nmouse antihuman Ki-67 ready-to-use mono-\nclonal antibodies (ZhongShan Golden\nBridge Biotechnology Company, Beijing,\nChina) for 1 h at 37C. The slides were\nthen washed three times in 0.01 M phos-\nphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.3). Slides\nwere incubated with a secondary antibody\n(horseradish peroxidase goat antimouse,\nused without dilution; supplied by DAKO,\nGlostrup, Denmark]) for 1 h at 37C. The\nslides were then washed three times in PBS,\npH 7.2. Immunohistochemistry was per-\nformed using the EnVisionTM method\naccording to the manufacturer's instructions\n(DAKO). Diaminobenzidine-treated slides\nwere counterstained with Giemsa staining,\nto mask yellow-pigmented granules in the\nmelanoma cells; this was undertaken to\navoid them obscuring the immunohisto-\nchemistry staining.\nGrading standards of\nimmunohistochemistry\nThe presence of KLF6 and Ki-67 was\ndetermined by light microscopy (BX51,\nOlympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) and was\nobserved by yellow-to-brown staining in the\ncytoplasm and nucleus. KLF6 staining was\nevaluated in five randomly-selected high-\npower (\u00c2 400) microscope fields with the\nmost intense staining, in which the total\nnumber of cells and the number of posi-\ntively-stained cells were counted. The total\nnumber of cells from five fields was ! 200;\nthe percentage of cells staining positive was\ncalculated and the results were graded as\n4, > 50% of cells stained positive. Grade 1\nwas defined as negative for staining and\ngrades 2\u00ad4 were defined as positive. The\nproliferation index was calculated according\nto the method of Bologna-Molina et al.11\nBriefly, the percentage of cells staining\npositive for Ki-67 was calculated using\nphotomicrographs (one per case) obtained\nrandomly-selected fields of view, where\ntumour cells were predominant; the prolif-\neration index \u00bc cells staining positive for Ki-\nStatistical analyses\nAll statistical analyses were performed using\nSPSS\u00d5 statistical software, version 16.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for\nWindows\u00d5.

An antiproliferative effect of KLF6\nthrough upregulation of the cyclin-depen-\ndent kinase inhibitor p27 has been demon-\nstrated in lung cancer.25 In addition, KLF6\nhas been shown to interact with c-Src pro-\ntein, leading to the inactivation of Erk and\nAkt (which are critical for cell proliferation\nand survival) and the suppression of oestro-\ngen receptor-mediated cell growth in breast\ncancer.26 Research has also suggested that a\nKLF6-related epigenetic mechanism may be\ninvolved in tumour cell proliferation.27\nData from the present study indicate that\nfewer cutaneous malignant melanoma\nlesions had evidence of KLF6 immunohis-\ntochemical staining compared with healthy\ncontrol tissues, taken from the same patient.\nIn addition, the presence of KLF6 protein\nwas shown to be negatively correlated with\ntumour cell proliferation. The present study\nalso demonstrated that KLF6 was asso-\nciated with tumour diameter, TNM stage\nand lymph node metastasis. Therefore,\nKLF6 expression levels might reflect the\ndegree of malignancy of cutaneous malig-\nnant melanoma. More patients with positive\nKLF6 staining had tumours in TNM I/II\nstages compared with TNM III/IV, and\nmore had no evidence of lymph node metas-\ntasis. Furthermore, shorter survival rates\nwere determined in patients with no evi-\ndence of KLF6 staining. Taken together,\nthese data support an essential role for loss\nor downregulation of KLF6 in the develop-\nment and progression of cutaneous malig-\nnant melanoma.\nThe authors acknowledge that there were\nsome limitations to the present study. First,\nbecause malignant melanoma is rare in\nChina, the number of patients included in\nthe study was small. Secondly, this was a\nretrospective analysis of archived patient\ndata; larger, prospective studies are needed\nto clarify these initial study findings.\nIn conclusion, the present study revealed\nthat KLF6 expression is downregulated in\ntissue samples of cutaneous malignant mel-\nanoma compared with healthy control sam-\nples from the same patients. These data\nindicate that KLF6 may be involved in\ntumour progression and may be a tumour\nsuppressor and prognostic marker for cuta-\nneous malignant melanoma.\nDeclaration of conflicting interest\nThe authors declare that there are no conflicts of\ninterest.\nFunding\nThis project was supported by a grant from\nShandong Province Science and Technology\nReferences\n1.
