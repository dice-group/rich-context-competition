Foster\ninvestigated the interactional adjustments produced by L2 English learners working on different types of language learning\ntasks in a classroom setting. This replication study duplicates the methods of data collection and data analysis of the original\nstudy, but alters the conditions by exploring interactional modifications in the language production of English as a foreign\nlanguage (EFL) students. It followed the three parameters set originally by D. Foster: speech production, comprehensible\ninput, and modified output. It was thus carried out within the Benem\u00e9rita Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla (BUAP). The\nparticipants' differences were seen as affecting the results of this replication where a corpus shows participants conducting\nsignificant amounts of meaning negotiation and producing modified output. This disparity in results is interpreted as deriving\nfrom a closer examination of interaction as suggested by Pica, Holliday, Lewis, and Morgenthaler.\n",

Its secondary\nmission is to provide a link between the communities within\nthe state of Puebla through specific outreach programs such\nas the courses for modern languages. One such program is\nknown as the \"Cursos de Extensi\u00f3n Universitaria (CEU),\"\nwhich are short courses mainly given to the general public.\nThe focus of this research is located in the interaction occur-\nring among English as a foreign language (EFL) students in\nthis program. The purpose was to explore the ways class-\nroom interaction inhibits or promotes interactional modifica-\ntions in the language production of students. This study sets\nout to observe the extent to which EFL upper-intermediate\nlearners produce comprehensible oral input in general and\nmodified output, particularly as they engage in group- or\npair-work in a natural classroom setting. It also seeks to see\nif task type and participant structure may affect speech pro-\nduction and interactional modifications.\nStatement of the Problem\nFollowing second language acquisition (SLA) research tradi-\ntion, the study analyzes language interactions in controlled\nconditions, determined by \"task type\" and \"participant struc-\nture\" as accurately suggested by D.

Since the 1980s, a sig-\nnificant number of studies have been carried out, which\nobserve language learners solving specially designed tasks.\nThese \"referential communication tasks\" have been used to\nSuch tasks have been investigated as to how they induce\nL2 production, the negotiation of meaning, and/or the mod-\nhave typically not been conducted in classrooms: The\nempirical immensity of task-based research in SLA has\ntaken place under laboratory conditions rather than in actual\nclassrooms.\nSome classroom-based studies move one step further\nand analyze conversational group and dyadic interaction\namong L2 learners. Evidence from these studies shows that\nstudents' interaction improves communicative use of the\ninterest to SLA researchers interested in the pedagogical\napplication of their investigations is whether the results\nthey have obtained can be replicated under \"normal class-\nroom conditions\" (D. Foster, 1998, p. 6). Task evaluations\nperformed by teachers, then, may serve as a way of testing\nthe transferability of research insights (R. Ellis, 1997). D.\nSmall group work in EFL classrooms is a widespread practice,\nenthusiastically endorsed in much of the literature. It is seen as\nbeneficial in several ways: it increases the amount of class time\navailable to an individual student to practise speaking the target\nlanguage; it decreases the amount of time students spend\nlistening (or not listening) to other class members interacting\nwith the teacher; it avoids the anxiety and self-consciousness\nthat prevent some students from speaking up in front of the\nwhole class; it allows the teacher more opportunity for individual\ninstruction. In sum, it can help to create a positive and relaxed\nlearning environment. (p. 1)\nResearch of the language produced by small groups has\nintended to justify these hopes. It has been seen, for instance,\nthat when interacting in small groups students talk more\nthan they do in teacher-fronted activities, that they do not\ntalk less accurately or carefully (Porter, 1983), and that they\nhave the opportunity to practice a greater variety of speech\nOther research has focused on whether students working\nin dyads or groups can provide each other with the\nComprehensible Input (Krashen, 1982, cited in Gass &\nment in SLA.\nIn this vein, D. Foster (1998) questions the extendibility\nof laboratory results on negotiation for meaning in L2 class-\nrooms based on her research findings. She goes on to describe\nnegotiation in interaction and she comes to the conclusion\nthat there was no significant evidence of interaction in the\nclassroom she studied. Classrooms are not as easily con-\ntrolled as laboratories; this characteristic of classrooms needs\nto be taken into account when, as D. Foster does, going\nbeyond the laboratory to fulfill what she states as \"if lan-\nguage acquisition research wants to feed into teaching meth-\nodology, the research environment has to be willing to move\nout of the laboratory and into the classroom'' (p. 21).\nFurther classroom-research is needed to increase data\ntypicality that would support \"negotiation of meaning\" as a\nThis study hopes to contribute to interaction and SLAinquiry\nthrough a replication of D. Foster's (1998) \"negotiation for\nmeaning\" study within a real classroom\nSignification of the Study\nInteraction, broadly stated, refers to communication among\nindividuals, particularly when they are \"negotiating mean-\ning\" or working to prevent a breakdown in communication\nPica, Doughty, & Young, 1986). Language learning may be\nseen merely as input, but it requires favorable conditions\noffered by an interactive context. As such, interaction is a\nnecessary condition for acquisition, which outweighs input\nreceived in any other way (Eckerth, 2009). Within SLA\nresearch, input obtained via interaction has been conceptual-\nized and researched in terms of \"comprehensible input,\"\n\"negotiation of meaning,\" and \"comprehensible output\"\n2006). The interrelatedness of these three notions is con-\nrevised version of the Interaction Hypothesis. In other words,\nconversational interaction in an L2 forms the basis for the\ndevelopment of language rather than being only a forum for\npractice of specific language features.\nThis has been most recently expressed by Long (1996) as\nthe Interaction Hypothesis: negotiation for meaning, and\nespecially negotiation work that triggers interactional adjust-\nments by the native speaker (NS) or more competent inter-\nlocutor, facilitates acquisition because it connects input,\ninternal learner capacities, particularly selective attention,\nand output in productive ways. It is proposed that environ-\nmental contributions to acquisition are mediated by selective\nattention and the learner's developing L2 processing capac-\nity, and that these resources are brought together most use-\nfully, although not exclusively, during negotiation for\nmeaning. Negative feedback obtained during negotiation\nwork or elsewhere may be facilitative of L2 development, at\nleast for vocabulary, morphology, and language-specific\nsyntax, and essential for learning certain specifiable L1\u00adL2\ncontrasts.\nA question of interest to FL acquisition researchers inter-\nested in the pedagogical application of their investigations is\nwhether the results they have obtained can be replicated\nunder \"normal classroom conditions\" (D. Foster, 1998, p. 6).\nWithin SLA research, input obtained via interaction has been\nconceptualized and researched in terms of \"comprehensible\nthree notions is concisely expressed in Long's revised ver-\nsion of the Interaction Hypothesis.\nFrom the middle of the 1980s onward, a large number of\nstudies have been conducted which observe language learn-\ners working on specially designed tasks. These \"referential\ncommunication tasks,\" as they have been called (Kay &\ntion shared among vs. split between interlocutors) and infor-\nmation flow between interlocutors (one-way vs. two-way).\nUsually, then, such tasks have been investigated as to how\nthey induced L2 production, the negotiation of meaning,\nand/or the modification of output (Gass, 1997; Gass &\nAlthough research on task-based learning is primarily\nconcerned with the cognitive and interactive conditions of\nlanguage acquisition, such studies on negotiated interaction\nalso argue to be directly or indirectly significant to SLA and\nL2 pedagogy. Tasks, although they were developed for\nresearch, are claimed to be of immediate applicability as a\nteaching tool in the L2 classroom (Eckerth, 2009; Loewen,\nPica, 2005; Pica, Holliday, Lewis, Berducci, & Newman,\n1991). Conversely, these studies have typically not been con-\nducted in classrooms: The empirical immensity of task-based\nresearch in SLA has taken place under laboratory conditions\nrather than in actual classrooms. A question of some interest\nto SLA researchers interested in the pedagogical application\nof their research is whether the results they have obtained\ncan be replicated under normal classroom conditions. Task\nevaluations performed by teachers, then, may serve as a way\nof testing the transferability of research insights (R. Ellis,\nTask evaluations performed by teachers, then, may serve\nas a way of testing the transferability of research insights (R.\npants while they were working in small groups and in pairs\n(dyads/participant structure) on different language learning\ntasks (task types). D. Foster as teacher-researcher, could\neffectively gather three sets of oral discourse production\ndata: (a) for the amount of speech production, she collected a\ncorpus of 918 c-units; (b) as for comprehensible input\n(expressed in negotiation moves), she gathered a corpus of\n87 moves (9.4% of the total corpus); and (c) for modified\noutput, she collected 20 moves (2.1% of the total corpus).\nHer results inform no clear effect for task type or grouping\non the frequency of incidences of student output in the three\nareas of the study.\nMethod\nFollowing SLA research tradition, this study analyzes lan-\nguage interaction in controlled conditions, determined by\n\"task type\" and \"participant structure.\" But, it goes beyond\nD. Foster's original research conditions by not only situating\nthe study in a \"Mexican classroom\" but also using communi-\ncative tasks taken from English as a second language (ESL)\nbooks applied on an EFL context. The process of research is\nalso controlled as it follows D. Foster's (1998) questions pre-\nsented below, which address the three areas of Long's (1983)\ninteractional hypothesis: (a) Comprehensible Input: To what\nextent do students in dyads and groups negotiate for meaning\nto make input comprehensible? (b) Modified Output: To\nwhat extent do students in dyads and groups modify their\nlanguage to make it comprehensible to others? Given the\nimplicit acquisitional prospective of negotiated interaction,\nthe question arises as to how to best create a learning envi-\nronment in which negotiation of meaning and interactional\nadjustments can occur. Since the 1980s, a significant number\nof studies have been carried out which observe language\nlearners solving specially designed tasks. These \"referential\ncommunication tasks,\" have been used to prompt interaction\nThe Research Tradition\nThe design of this study integrates methodological principles\nas Chaudron (1985) asserts that both qualitative and quanti-\ntative approaches to research on second language learning\nare considered, with the special case of second language\nclassroom research being used for illustration. It is evident\nthat both approaches are relevant to determine (a) the impor-\ntant variables to investigate and (b) the relationships those\nvariables have to second language learning outcomes. Based\non these principles, this study is mainly quantitative, but it\nincludes some qualitative assumptions as Doughty's (2000)\naccurately suggests,\nBy hearing laughs and calm breathing, researchers, when\ntranscribing and coding data in c-units, may assume that a\nrelaxed atmosphere is being preserved so as to permeate their\nresult with qualitative comments . . . the researcher's qualitative\ncomments enhance which otherwise would be raw numbers,\npercentages and statistics by enlightening numbers with\n4 SAGE Open\nThis study codes participants' utterances in c-units (com-\nmunication units) that generated frequencies which were\ninterpreted on a qualitative basis following Doughty (2000)\ncriteria of meaning negotiation.\nMeasuring Spoken Performance in Interaction\nOne of the interesting features within interaction research\nhas been the different ways in which researchers have fea-\ntured and measured performance (Skehan, 1998; Skehan &\nferent choices that investigators have made have reflected\ntheir theoretical positions. With respect to complexity, P.\nFoster, Tonkyn, and Wigglesworth (2000) argue strongly for\nthe use of what they term theAS-unit (Assessment of Speech)\nthrough communication units (c-units). This, they argue, is\nmore appropriate for a spoken language context, and pro-\nvides a more appropriate measure than Text-units (T-units as\nlyze speech production through communication units\n(c-units) that are explained as\nIndependent utterances which provide referential or pragmatic\nmeaning . . . By excluding false starts but allowing for ellipses,\nc-units are arguably more sensitive to the transmission of\nmeaning and a more appropriate measure for an investigation\n\"an independent grammatical predication: the same as a\nT-unit; except that in oral language, elliptical answers to\nquestions also constitute complete predications.\" In other\nwords, c-units account for multiple messages within each\nindividual turn and, therefore, provide \"a sensitive and accu-\nrate measure of the amount of language produced by the par-\nThe Participants\nThere are 10 students in an EFL upper-intermediate level\nclass within the \"Cursos Estacionales.\" The participants are\npresently studying the 8th of 10th required English courses\nto obtain a diploma certifying their linguistic competences.\nThey share the same L1 background in Spanish as well as\ntheir Mexican nationality. Their ages range from 20 to 36.\nSix are females and four are males.\nPseudonyms were used to identify learners: Nashielly,\nRodrigo, Laura, Victor, and Karla have a master's degree in\nbusiness administration, whereas Francisco, Patty, Roc\u00edo,\nDulce, and Alberto hold a bachelor in arts degree in manage-\nment. Participants have been involved in business negotia-\ntions overseas (mainly in the United States and the United\nKingdom). They have also carried out important projects\nwith international companies such as General Motors and\nVolkswagen. In addition, the upper-intermediate students are\nto take Cambridge First Certificate. In that respect, students\nare trained in the communicative competences necessary to\nfulfill Cambridge language standards. In opposition to D.\nFoster's (1998) participant election criterion where subjects\n\"can be seen as highly typical of the very large number of\npart-time learners of English throughout Britain,\" these\nlearners were representing different social realities and pro-\nfessional profiles (p. 5). In this respect, such criterion is seen\nas a wider view of context, which acknowledges different\nsocial backgrounds. Thus, these are special highly trained\nbusiness people who do not belong to the common random\nsample from the part-time learners in the United Kingdom.\nBesides, these ones are learning English within a FL context\nas opposed to D. Foster's participants who were totally inter-\nacting in different L2 settings, not only in the classroom but\nalso out there in the streets and suburbs. These 10 partici-\npants considered necessary to enhance their English compe-\ntence through constant practice of language. That is one of\nthe main reasons they took the course. The second reason\nwas to be involved in an interactional course where spoken\nproduction was the priority. As the Facultad de Lenguas\nBUAP is working with spoken interaction competences as\nthe Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR)\nestablished, participants saw in this program an opportunity\nto do so.\nThe Setting\nThe \"CEU\" were established to promote the acquisition of a\nFL through admitting students from different ages and back-\ngrounds. The English program's syllabus entails five levels\nof language attainment: intro, basic, intermediate, upper-\nintermediate, and advanced. This program runs two modali-\nties: weekly and weekend courses. Weekly courses are taken\ntwice or 3 times a week to account for 100 hrs of language\nlearning, whereas weekend sessions are taken on Saturdays\nand Sundays to account for 50 hrs of language learning. A\nreal classroom-environment was thus preserved in the week-\nend modality. In addition, the protocol of data gathering was\nscheduled 4 times according to the class routine. That is,\nrecordings were taken within four normal classes while stu-\ndents were performing negotiation of meaning tasks adopted\nfrom two sources: the Cutting Edge upper-intermediate book\nMacMillan's teaching website, Task 1 (Kay & Jones, 2008).\nAt the time of data gathering, the class had been running\nfor more than 3 months, and all students had been properly\nplaced in the upper-intermediate level. Not only did the\nteacher conduct research himself but he also influenced stu-\ndents' grouping arrangements so that the possible bias of\ncould have been significantly reduced. In other words, both\nthe teacher's and students' common communicative task-\nbased approach behaviors were exerted weekly as part of the\nclass ongoing pace; nothing was altered during the whole\nresearch process. Thus, students were acquainted to work in\ndyads and groups to solve different communicative tasks\nduring the entire course. In addition, their permission was\ngranted to use the mp3 recorders to gather the data for this\narticle.\nThe Tasks\nThis study used, as D. Foster (1998) suggests, four types of\ntasks: two for students working in dyads and two by students\nworking in groups of five. Two of the tasks should only be\ncarried out if the subjects shared \"individually held informa-\ntion.\" These are defined as \"required information exchange\ntasks.\" The other two tasks should supply similar informa-\ntion to all subjects. They are explained as \"optional informa-\ntion exchange tasks.\"\n1. A conscious raising task-text repair: Learners were\nasked to decide on the meanings of some British idi-\noms by selecting the correct option from three differ-\nent choices within two given worksheets (A and B).\nThen, the dyads had to work out an appropriate ver-\nsion of the idiom to fill in some sentence gaps within\nWorksheet C, pointing out that each idiom appears\nonly once and that it may be necessary to change the\nverb forms. Completing a text repair task involved\ninserting lexical items such as idioms in accordance\nwith tense and subject\u00adverb agreement. Although\nthis task focuses on specific L2 features, it does not\nface participants with isolated, de-contextualized lin-\nguistic forms, thus having them make use of their\nown language resources. However, as there is no\nobligation to exchange information, this task is clas-\nsified as optional information exchange.\n2. Picture differences: Each affiliate of the dyads was\nprovided either Sheet A or B of a photocopy of 12\nsmall line drawings. Some of these drawings had\nslight discrepancies. Without showing each other\ntheir versions, the learners had to describe the pic-\ntures in their worksheet to the partner and decide on\ntheir correct order. In addition, dyads were required\nto create a coherent story line with those pictures.\nThat could only be done by learners trading informa-\ntion, and was typified as \"a required information.\"\nFor the small group arrangement the tasks recorded were\nas follows:\nConsensus, the great diamond robbery: This is a\ndiscussion task in which subjects were supposed to\npose a problem and then they were given a number\nof possible courses of action. Once they had reached\na consensus on which path to follow, they got a fur-\nther piece of information which divulged the\nconsequences of their alternative and set them a\nnew problem to solve. They again had to reach a\nconsensus, which entailed further problems and\noptions until the task ended. Each group had to\nwork out a plan to steal the precious diamond and\nescape without getting caught. As all the informa-\ntion was available to all the members of the group,\nthis task was typified as \"an optional information\nexchange.\"\nThe Supersaver map: Each participant received a\ncopy of a newspaper article about the construction of\na new supermarket, a map of the possible sites where\nthe supermarket could be built and an identity card\nspecifying not only the role each participant had\nwithin the council of the town but also giving signifi-\ncant clues about the roles which the others in the\ngroup did not know.\nTime was given for participants to familiarize with their\nroles. Then, the chairperson began the debate ensuring that\neveryone had anything to say. At the end of the debate, stu-\ndents took a vote on whether to allow the supermarket to be\nbuilt. As this task could not have been carried out without\nsubjects sharing their individually held information with the\nother members of the group, it was typified as \"a required\ninformation exchange.\"\nData Collection, Transcription, and\nCoding\nThe first 10 min of every interaction were transcribed and\ncoded. The transcription system used was fairly standard.\nThree periods were used to indicate a longer pause. A ques-\ntion mark indicated raising intonation, an exclamation mark\nindicated noticeable emphasis, and quotation marks identi-\nfied words that were read from the worksheet. Score tran-\nscription had been used to better account for pauses and\noverlapping turns. Doughty's (2000) model was used for\nfaster identification of breakdowns in communication and\nfor revealing how the errors were followed up and repaired\n(see Figure 1). Triggers, signals, responses, and reactions\nwere identified, classified, and coded. No effort has been\nmade to select examples of interactional sequences system-\natically or to choose negotiation moves according to specific\ncriteria, for example, their degree of \"typicality.\" The only\nprinciple that guided the selection was the desire to show at\nleast one interactional sequence from each of the learners'\ndyads and groups in the corpus.\nAmount of Speech Production\nNot only did the coding of the data include the number of\nturns and c-units (communication units) but also noted how\nmany of these were produced during the completion of tasks.\nThe definitions for these units were adopted from Long\n6 SAGE Open\n(1983), a c-unit is \"a t-unit or isolated phrase not accompa-\nnied by a verb, but which has communicative value\" (p. 1).\nThis study used c-units as the primary units of analysis, as\nthey most appropriately account for those utterances that\nmight not be complete, lacked a verb, or are simply exclama-\ntions, but are used as elements for communication.\nThe Negotiation Model for Analysis\nThe negotiation model proposed by Doughty and Pica (1986)\nand used by D. Foster (1998) was adopted for this study\n(Figure 1). According to Doughty and Pica (1986), the essen-\ntial feature of the negotiation sequences \"is the opportunity\nthat is provided to the learner to process utterances in the L2\nwhich become more comprehensible\" (p. 43). Her model\nincorporates a trigger, a signal, a response, and a reaction. A\ntrigger is \"an utterance or part of an utterance that is not\nunderstood\" (p. 48). A signal is used by the interlocutor to\nexpress a lack of comprehension. A response then comes\nfrom the first speaker trying to repair the problem. A reaction\nis an extension or a response to the repair. In this article,\ndirect and indirect responses are considered without further\ndifferentiation as both are part of the negotiation process.\nTo operationalized signals, Long's (1983) confirmation\nchecks, clarification requests, and comprehension checks\nwill be used. These types of input modifications are used to\nnegotiate meaning. Also following Long, the responses in\nthe data will be identified as repetition, expansion, or refor-\nmulation. Along with the original study, negotiated interac-\ntion was coded for clarification requests (a request for\nfurther information from an interlocutor about a previous\nutterance), comprehension checks (the speaker's query of the\ninterlocutor(s) as to whether or not they have understood\nthe previous speaker utterance(s)), and confirmation check\n(the speaker's query as to whether or not the speaker's\n[expressed] understanding of the interlocutor's meaning is\ncorrect; D. Foster, 1998, referring to definitions from\nModified Output\nAlso in accordance with the original study and to measure\nmodified output, the transcripts were coded using the defini-\ntions from Pica et al. (1989) for semantic modification moves\n(through synonym, paraphrase, for example), morphological\nmodification moves (through addition, substitution, or dele-\ntion of inflectional morphemes and/or functors), phonologi-\ncal modification moves (the pronunciation of the phonemes\n/s/ in third-person singular and the use of /-t/, /-d/, /-d/, /-d/\nsuffix, also \u00add in simple past tense), and syntactic modifica-\ntion moves (through embedding and elaboration in clauses).\nResults and Discussion\nThe replication sought to explore whether, insofar as D.\nFoster's findings concerning transferability of laboratory\nresults to classroom conditions, transferability of experimen-\ntal research findings also applies to classrooms in a different\nsocio-cultural context. In that, this study closely followed the\nresearch procedures adopted in the original study, further evi-\ndence will hopefully contribute to the claim that negotiation\nof meaning is not only a primary factor in FL acquisition but\nalso the main trigger of SLA. In this vein, Eckerth (2009)\ncontributed with differentiate findings, by using immediately\nstimulated recall interviews that reveal transcript turns where\nL2 German students noticed and recognized that they acquired\na morphological, lexical, or syntactical item. In this regard,\nnegotiation of meaning through the task-based approach is\nthoroughly supporting the paradigm that selective attention\nand interpersonal communication generate SLA.\nWhen students signal incomprehension about a lexical,\nmorphological or complexity task item, a response from the\nother interlocutor is given trying to fill the gap . . . 15\nconversational turns later the item is acquired by the speaker\nwho asked for clarification ( in turn 7) by using it abundantly\nthrough the entire act speeches of the following turns. (Gourlay,\nAs will be specified in the following sections, the relevant\nparameters such as participants, setting, tasks, data collection\nprocedures, and data coding were identically or closely com-\nparable with those in the original research. While observing\ntask-based language learner performance in an actual EFL\nclassroom, the coded data were presented in the form of sim-\nple totals and percentages. In the following section, the infor-\nmation derived from examination of students' classroom\nperformance is presented beginning with Table 1 where the\nFigure 1. Negotiation process.\ncomposition of learner dyads and groups (e.g., 1a, 2b, 3a, 4b)\nand their distribution across tasks (indicated by numbers) are\ntypified. Mp3 recorders are identified by letters (e.g., a, b, c).\nIn the present study, it was generally the same students work-\ning together on the different tasks. This allowed for a perfor-\nmance comparison across learners as well as across tasks. The\ndata will be presented according to the parameters aforemen-\ntioned: The first category concerns language production, the\nsecond category examines comprehensible input, and the\nfinal one looks at modified output. Within each of these three\ncategories, tables specify the performance of the dyads as\nnumbers and percentages. (Quote deleted)\nLanguage Production\nThe Table 1 shows that, in dyadic interaction, cross-talk\nclearly reveals a less speech production for Task 2 with\nrequired information exchange (30.75%), as compared with\nthe grammar Task 1. Contrastively being the exception Dyads\nrevealed by Table 2, this does not only hold true in terms of\nthe total of c-units produced by all dyads, but mostly also in\nterms of percentages. Such a result is in conflict with D.\nFoster's data, which showed an opposite ratio of participants'\nc-units with less language production within the optional\ninformation exchanged Task 1. Furthermore, compared per-\ncentages across dyads are inconsistent with D. Foster's study\n(1998) due to the fact that the overall amount of language\nproduction in this replica does not vary widely. This is fairly\nsupported by the standard deviation, which is low (3.05) with\nall the scores clustered around the mean (131.8).\nThis table further suggests that group participant structure\nallows for the production of a similar score. For Task 3, par-\nticipants' scores vary slightly from Groups 3a to 3b with a\ndifference of just three c-units. Moreover, for the group task\nwith required information exchange participants' language\nproduction is measured with a range of 53 c-units. The results\nsummarized in Table 2 are similar to D. Foster's original\nstudy where Task 3 is associated with more language produc-\ntion as well. Standard deviation is even lower (2.5) showing\nan index of minimum disparity among scores which assumes\nthat scores do not vary widely in groups as well.\nAs described in the previous table, there is a slightly wider\nrange of scores throughout all the tasks as a whole showing a\nstandard deviation of 3.5 is also low indicating a narrow dis-\ntance of the scores from the mean. There is a slight possibil-\nity that D. Foster's (1998) claim that the conscious raising\ntask-text repair (1) seemed to promote the production of an\nextensive number of c-units.\nComprehensible Input\nNegotiation of meaning was measured by determining the\nnumber of negotiation moves (comprehension checks,\nconfirmation checks, and clarification requests) made by\neach dyad and group. The scores for these variables are\nshown in Table 3. The least (9.23%) was produced by Dyad\n1e doing the same task. The most negotiation moves (20.65%\nof c-units) were produced by Group 3b doing an optional\ninformation exchange task.\nAs can be seen in Table 3, a similar tendency indicates\nthat the second highest score for negotiation moves (20.32%)\nwas for Group 3a performing an information exchange task\nas compared with the second lowest (19.71%), which was\nGroup 4a doing a required information exchange task.\nThis article shows students negotiating to a significant\n313 negotiation moves were produced as a result of accom-\nplishing all tasks as opposed to 87 signals of clarification\nin D. Foster's study (9.5% of her total corpus). As required\ninformation exchange tasks were adapted to elicit partici-\npants' negotiation by having them hold and give specific\ninformation, they were expected to elicit more meaning\nnegotiation.\nContrastively, concise results reveal that optional infor-\nmation exchange tasks are generating as much negotiation\nmoves as the required information ones. These insights are\nseen as a direct consequence of using different tasks and\nEFL participants within a different socio-cultural back-\nground. This outcome strongly contrasts with Eckerth's\npants producing more negotiation moves for the required\ninformation exchange tasks. Thus, D. Foster's \"pretend and\nhope strategy\" is clearly not being used by the participants\nof this study that seem to engage vigorously in meaning\nnegotiation when a breakdown in communication is pro-\nduced. The significant amount of modified utterances indi-\nrectly supports this claim.\nTable 1.

Foster's participants let signals of clarification pass\nwithout any modification due to the fact they felt was not\nnecessary to negotiate meaning. A yes or no answer was\nenough to clarify a comprehension check. Conversely, the\nEFL participants of this study were highly involved in clari-\nfication because they perceived that engaging in constant\ncommunication would enhance their FL competences to the\nfullest.\nIt seems warranted to conduct research which would ver-\nify such predictions in real classrooms, in settings where\nlearners share their mother tongue and have limited out-of-\nschool exposure to the target language (Eckerth, 2009; D.\nGass, & McDonough, 2000). The present article contributes\nto this line of inquiry by exploring the occurrence and value\nof \"negotiated interaction\" among EFL upper-intermediate\nMexican learners prompted by optional and required infor-\nmation exchange tasks. It thus inquires to what extent \"mean-\ning negotiation\" is attempted by these students in dyads and\nsmall group work.\nTable 3 clearly reveals that students without the obliga-\ntion to exchange information reacted rather similarly in the\namount of negotiation they undertook. This evidence is\ncontrasting with D. Foster's (1998) findings that show par-\nticipants reacting very differently during the completion of\nan optional information exchange task. In the same vein,\nthe obligation to trade information, entailed by Tasks 2 and\n4, produced similar results (both of them scored 176\nmoves), so as to show that negotiation of meaning is pro-\nlific when participants are engaged in required information\nexchange tasks (Doughty & Pica, 1986, cited in Doughty,\nAs shown in Table 1, the instances of c-units these tasks\ngenerated from participants were within a much narrower\nrange of 11.42. Despite the high frequencies of negotiation of\nmeaning, the corpus is of 313 moves representing 16% of the\ntotal corpus compose of 2,016 c-units. Unlike D. Foster's\n(1998) insights that show participants not engaging in mean-\ning negotiation, this study shows most students at least nego-\ntiating to some extent. Table 4 shows that all of participants\nthus attempted some negotiation work.\nTable 4 illustrates the distribution of negotiation moves\nwithin dyads and groups. As can be seen, an analysis of the\nway that individual members shared the production of nego-\ntiation moves reveals, not surprisingly, that some shared\nmore or less equally (e.g., Dyads 1c, 1e, and 2b, and Group\n3b), others less equally (e.g., Dyads ld and 2e and Groups 3a\nand 4a), and yet others very unequally (e.g., Dyad 2a and\nGroup 4b). It is important to note that the required informa-\ntion exchange task showed the shared responsibility for\nnegotiation only in 2b, 2c, and 2d (three of them dyads) and\nGroup 4b. On these occasions, one member was very domi-\nnant: In 2b, Patty produced 10 and Francisco 9 negotiation\nmoves; in 2c Victor produced 7 and Rocio 9, respectively; in\n4b, Nashielly is slightly exceeding Alberto with 12 and 11,\nrespectively. A closer look at the data in Table 8 reveals how\ndyads shared the production of meaning negotiation moves\nas compared with the most reluctant interlocutor.\nAs compared with D. Foster's (1998) original study, this\narticle shows participants meaning negotiating to a great\nextent.\nThe incidence of modified output (i.e., utterances that\nwere morphologically, semantically, syntactically, or phono-\nlogically altered in response to a negotiation move) was cal-\nculated for each dyad and group. Most modification moves\nwere made by Dyad 2e doing a task that required agreement\non sequencing some line drawings. Furthermore, Table 5\nshows the other dyads closely following 2e (e.g., 2d with\nTable 3. Number of Negotiated Input Moves as % of Total\nc-Units.\nn % n % n %\nn % n % n %\nTable 2. Number of c-Units Produced by Students in Dyads and Groups.\nRecorder a Recorder b Recorder c Recorder d Recorder e Total c-units %\nwas a conscious raising task-text repair, Dyad 1c produced\nclosely followed by Dyad 1d that produced 15 instances of\nmodified output (15.15% of the total of c-units produced by\nthis dyad in particular).\nTable 5 illustrates the distribution of negotiation moves\nwithin dyads and groups. As can be seen, an analysis of the\nway that individual members shared the production of nego-\ntiation moves reveals, not surprisingly, that some shared\nmore or less equally (e.g., Dyads 1c, 1e, and 2b and Group\n3b), others less equally (e.g., Dyads ld and 2e and Groups 3a\nand 4a), and yet others very unequally (e.g., Dyad 2a and\nGroup 4b).\nAs can be seen in Table 6, figures are broken down to\nshow the negotiation moves each interlocutor made within\ndyads. In the majority of cases, the reluctant participants'\nratio of negotiation moves varied widely from their interloc-\nutors. In Task 1, Karla negotiated twice as vigorously as\nNashielly. Similarly, during the completion of Task 2 Karla\nwas the one who exceeded in the meaning negotiation\nendeavor. Francisco who has been seen as a dominant inter-\nlocutor in Task 4a producing 13 negotiation moves just pro-\nduced 8 in Task 1 with a 62% as compared with Patty who\ncontributed 38% more negotiation moves to the same task.\nTable 6 shows that, in dyadic interaction, cross-talk com-\nparison sheds light on meaning negotiation. Laura who was\nahead with 14% of Rodrigo in Task 1 increased their domi-\nnance with a 44% in Task 2 with required information\nexchange. Almost the same ratio is kept by Rocio and Victor\nwith Rocio being slightly above Victor throughout Tasks 1\nand 2. Dulce also maintained the dominance of meaning\nnegotiation with a 67% ahead in Task 1, but reducing her\ndominance to 25% during Task 2.\nTable 6 reveals that the interlocutor who dominated in one\ndyad dominated all dyads and tasks. Karla exceeded twice as\ncompared with their interlocutors when signaling incompre-\nhension in both tasks. Similarly, Patty who dominated her\ninterlocutor producing twice as many negotiation moves in\nTask 1 reduced his domination in Task 2. Furthermore, Rocio\nand Dulce slightly exceeded their interlocutors when asking\nfor clarification in Task 2. It is important to note that interac-\ntants engaged significantly in meaning negotiation during\nTask 2 with required information exchange. This insight is\npartially in accordance with D. Foster's (1998) and Eckerth's\nModified Output\nTable 5 summarizes cross-talk analysis through group inter-\naction. Group 3b produced 43 frequencies of interactional\nmodifications (23.37%), whose participants carried out a\nconsensus task, nearly followed by Group 3a with a narrow\nrange of 6. However, within the supersaver's map task with\nTable 4.

Group 4b produced most inter-\nactional modifications (42 modified output moves or\n22.11%). Participants produced a significant number of\ninteractional modifications. A concise analysis throughout\nthe scores is called for as students generated a significant\namount of optional and required information exchange. This\nis seen as evidence of the occurrence of modified output that\nwould be a direct consequence of cognitive processes (Pica\ndominated the conversation in one task, he or she tended to\ndominate across all tasks and group structures, is strongly\nproved by the empirical data of this article. Data within this\nstudy are showing participants negotiating to some extent\nwith all signals of incomprehension triggering a significant\nquantity of interactional adjustments.\nTables 7 and 8 show participants eagerly engaged in task\ncompletion producing high frequencies of interactional\nadjustments. This insight is due to the fact that signals of\nincomprehension were not always directed at one individual,\nbut many who took responsibility for answering. In contrast,\n4a was the participants' arrangement that produced less out-\nput adjustments. The score is also informing, a total of 29\ninteractional output moves were attempted as a response to\nFrancisco exhaustive meaning negotiation. These interac-\ntional adjustments were highly semantic due to the fact that\nparticipants held individual informative roles that were cru-\ncial to the task completion.\nAs can be seen in Tables 7 and8, the tasks with required\ninformation exchange provided most output modifications.\nSuch results highly contrast with D. Foster's (1998) study\nwhere groups and dyads were generally noisier and none of\nthe participants took the responsibility of answering confir-\nmations and clarifications. In addition, the absence of any\nstrict requirement to fulfill the task inclined her students not\nto pay close attention to the form of their language.\nAs can be revealed in Tables 4, 7, and8, the most notable\nfeature is there were not any frequencies of zeros. That is,\nstudents remaining silent or applying D. Foster's hope and\npass strategy. Such an insight is definitely in conflict with D.\nFoster's quantitative results: 28 scores were for 0, and a fur-\nther 8 were for only 1. Nevertheless, this study is strongly\nrelated to the data reported by Pica et al. (1989), which\nshowed that their 10 NSs made a total of 327 negotiation\nmoves during the three tasks they were set, and that the 10\nnon-native speakers (NNSs) interlocutors made 327\nresponses, of which an impressive 116 were modified. Within\nthis study, a total of 312 responses were interactional modi-\nfied out of 313 negotiation moves. Furthermore, D. Foster's\nclaim that a NNS deciding that a breakdown in communica-\ntion is the fault of his NNS interlocutor, might not feel\nobliged to attempt a repair is inconsistent with this study\nresults. Overall participants were engaged in meaning nego-\ntiation to some extent with 99.6% of output adjustments\nbeing produced by more competent interlocutors.\nSummary and Conclusion\nThis study contributes to the applied linguistics field through\nshowing reliable data that support \"negotiation of meaning\"\nas an effective way of constructing Foreign Language\nAcquisition. However, it was carried out with a small sample\nthat makes it hard to generalize to a wider Mexican popula-\ntion. In addition, by virtue of being a cross-sectional study\nwhere interactions had been recorded through four class\nTable 5. Distribution of Negotiation Moves Within Dyads\nand Groups (Expressed as Number of Moves Students Made to\nPrevent a Breakdown in Communication).\nn % n % n %\nn % n %\nn % n % n %\nn % n %\nn % n %\nn % n %\nsessions, a longitudinal study taking into account recalled\nsessions with participants was not possible to be accom-\nplished. Although figures seem not to address a significant\ncorrelation between task type and participant structure, tasks\nwith optional information exchange elicited a considerable\namount of meaning negotiation and interactional\nadjustments.\n(a) Amount of language production: Participants uttered\nan impressive corpus of 2,016 communication units as\nopposed to D. Foster's corpus of 918 c-units. This in turn\nsupports the fact that they were intensive language produc-\ners. None of them remained silent or shy. Even the ones who\nappeared to be at times hesitant contributed with substantial\nlexical items to the fulfillment of the four tasks. (b)\nComprehensible input: A significant corpus of meaning\nnegotiation was also gathered (313 negotiation moves) as\nopposed to D. Foster's 7 moves. Participants seemed to be\nsignaling incomprehension vigorously when a breakdown in\ncommunication was raised. (c) Modified output: A notewor-\nthy corpus of interactional modifications was obtained (312\nresponses) as opposed to D. Foster's 20 moves. In addition,\nall participants produced at least some output as a response\nto a signal of incomprehension. Being nearly all negotiation\nmoves responded with interactional modifications. The con-\nsciousness raising task, with optional information exchange,\ngenerated morphological modifications throughout four of\nfive dyads. That is, this study showed participants' gram-\nmatical awareness by identifying the morphological inflec-\ntion of the third-person singular in present tense when coping\nwith some phrasal verbs such as \"economical with the truth\"\nin the conscious raising task-text repair (1). This research\nbased on tasks taps into grammatical modifications and\nshows that learners can be manipulated into negotiations for\nmeaning that involve verb tense and aspect.\nIn this vein, Pica, Kanagy, and Falodun (1993) accept that\nnegotiation for meaning (when it occurs) is far more likely to\nbe over lexical items than over grammatical morphology.\nEight of 10 participants of this study nevertheless showed\ngrammatical awareness by identifying the morphological\ninflection of the third-person singular in present tense when\ncoping with some phrasal verbs in Task 1. Pica et al. (1993)\ncalls for research based on tasks that will \"tap into grammati-\ncal modifications\" and which will presumably show if learn-\ners can be manipulated into negotiations for meaning that\nwill involve, for example, verb tense and aspect. Again a\nclose view of the data reveals that the conscious raising\ngrammar task fairly answers Pica's query by triggering most\nstudents' signals of incomprehension that were morphologi-\ncally modified by their interlocutors.\nImplications for Teaching English for Students of\nOther Languages (TESOL): A Classroom Stance\nof Negotiation of Meaning\nIt is needed to explore why so many of the students in this\nstudy were motivated to initiate or pursue negotiation for\nmeaning. It is not difficult to suggest possible explanations.\nAccording to D. Foster (1998), to hold up the interaction\nevery time there is a problem utterance, and painstakingly to\nattempt to repair it is a sure way of making the task frustrat-\ningly slow. Similarly, indicating to others each time you fail\nto grasp their meaning is a sure way of making yourself look\nand feel incompetent.\nUnlike D. Foster's participants, the students of this study\nwere willingly engaged in meaning negotiation. They did not\nseem to be embarrassed or incompetent due to the fact that\nthey perceive negotiation on a different way. Such perception\nwas strongly related to the practice of language. The more\nthey negotiated, the further they accomplished their own\nstance of the tasks' purposes. Contrary to Aston's (1986,\ncited in Eckerth, 2009) assumption that those group-work\ntasks that are designed to maximize negotiation for meaning\nmay end up de-motivating and discouraging students by\nmaking them feel unsuccessful and ineffective; the tasks\nadapted in this study had an opposite effect. In the same vein,\nPica (1994) acknowledges that negotiating for meaning is a\nTable 7.

The present study directly supports this claim.\nImplications for a Task-Based Approach\nWithin SLA\nIt is strongly acknowledged that the task designed proce-\nmote meaning negotiation.

Thus, what\nhas been called the \"permeability of tasks\" (Mondada &\npoints to major challenges in task-based research. There\nseem to be good reasons for bringing together qualitative\nanalyses of contextualized task-based interactions with\nquantifications of isolated linguistic units when researching\nissues of SLA. Rather than perpetuating unproductive \"para-\nmethodological perspective seeks to connect different\napproaches \"to link, but not reduce, one perspective to\nanother\" (Wertsch, 1998, cited in N. Ellis & Larsen-Freeman,\nSuch an integrated approach might be one way to inform\nacademics about potential gaps between \"intended\" and\n\"actual\" pedagogy (Seedhouse, 2005) and to improve the\ncontent validity of research constructs. If supported by further\nresearch, evidence of learners' task adaptation, this author\nsuggests, does not question the validity of interactional adjust-\nments and its significance for SLA (Doughty, 2004; Gass,\nsuggest, prevent tasks and their range of influence from being\nresearchable \"at the level of probable outcomes\" (my empha-\nsis). However, they continue, this does not imply that \"task\ncharacteristics might have a deterministic impact on perfor-\nmance\" (my emphasis).\nCombining a stimulated recall methodology with an anal-\nysis of task performance, a future study can try to show in\nwhat way learners' task perceptions can influence their task-\nbased interactions. This study will also attempt to contribute\nto the understanding of task-based EFL classroom learning\nas being perceived by the learners as a cognitive activity, a\ncommunicative event, and a social process. However, as the\nempirical base of these and related findings is still limited,\nthey call for more classroom-based interventionist studies\nAppendix\nConfirmation Check From Dyad 1b When Carrying Out the Optional Information Exchange Task: Deciding on the Correct Meaning of\nSome Phrasal Verbs.\nParticipant Negotiation moves within the corpus Participants' negotiation moves\nPatty Seven (6), \"What does it mean if someone is\n`economical with the truth'\" the letter A? \"They\ndeliberately leave out information in order to\ncreate a false impression of a situation.\"\nSignal: Confirmation check\n Francisco Mhh mmh (8) Response: Exclamation\n Francisco But the problem is the he (9) . . .
