    "abstract": "Abstract--Increased stiffness of the conduit arteries has been associated with increased risk of death and cardiovascular\ndeath in a number of populations. None of these populations, however, are fully representative of the US population.\nThe cohort examined in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) that was free of overt\ncardiovascular disease was selected to be representative of the US population. We assessed and quantified the increased\nrisk of death associated with elevated pulse pressure in this population. A cohort of 5771 subjects from NHANES I was\nused to determine the value of adding pulse pressure to standard cardiovascular disease risk factors for assessment of\nthe risk of death during a mean follow-up period of 16.5 years. Analyses were performed by use of the SUDAAN\nstatistical package for performing Cox proportional regression, logistic regression, and other standard methods in\ncomplex, weighted samples. Pulse pressure increased with increasing age, body mass index, cholesterol level, and mean\narterial pressure. With increasing pulse pressure, the percentage of cigarette smokers decreased and the percentage of\ndiabetics increased. Despite these associations with known risk factors, pulse pressure was independently predictive of\nan increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and all-cause mortality. It provides\nindependent prognostic information beyond that provided by known risk factors that were evaluated in this study,\nincluding the Sixth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood\nPressure hypertension classification. A 10 mm Hg increase in pulse pressure in persons 25 to 45 of age was associated\nwith a 26% increase in risk of cardiovascular death (95% confidence interval [CI], 5 to 50) and with an 10% increase\n(95% CI, 2 to 19) in persons 46 to 77 years of age. In a cohort designed to be representative of the US population,\nelevated pulse pressure has been shown to provide independent prognostic information. This variable may be a marker\nfor the extent of vascular disease and may contribute to the occurrence of clinical events. (Hypertension. 2001;38:793-\n",

Additionally, the pulse wave\nvelocity of the pressure pulse is increased. This results in\nearlier return of reflections from the periphery that, as\nstiffening progresses, arrive in the central aorta in late systole\nrather than early diastole. This contributes to an augmentation\nof peak systolic pressure and a reduction in diastolic pressure\n(and consequently an increase in pulse pressure). In addition\nto aging, arterial stiffening appears to be hastened by a\nnumber of conditions, including hypertension,12 meno-\npause,13 glucose intolerance,14 elevated homocysteine lev-\nels,15 polymorphisms of the angiotensin type I receptor\nAlthough a number of populations have been studied, none of\nthem is fully representative of the US population as a whole.

Data were collected from a complex, stratified proba-\nbility sample of 23 808 individuals in the civilian noninstitutional-\nized US population through a variety of questionnaires and a\nstandardized medical examination administered from mobile hospi-\ntals. Starting in 1982, the NHANES Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study\nwas conducted to provide a database for studies on the relationship\nof baseline clinical, nutritional, and behavioral factors to subsequent\nmorbidity and mortality. The study is described in detail else-\n1975). Direct information on smoking habits at baseline was avail-\nable from a subsample of 6903 of the original participants of\nNHANES I who were given a detailed examination. After those who\nwere taking blood pressure medication were eliminated, a subsample\nof 5771 persons with all values of the variables of interest was\navailable for our analyses. The mean length of follow-up was 16.5\nyears (range, 16 days to 22 years). Mortality data were collected\nCauses of death were coded according to the ninth revision of the\nInternational Classification of Diseases.25 If the decedent's code was\nbetween 390 and 459, the cause of death coded was attributed to\ncardiovascular disease (CVD). Coronary heart disease (CHD) was\nto 77 years of age were successfully traced, and death certificates\nStatistical Methods\nage who, when appropriately weighted according to the geographic\nand demographic strata from which they were drawn, accurately\nrepresent the US population of the same ages. Analyses were\nperformed with the SUDAAN statistical package,26 which contains\nprocedures for performing Cox proportional-hazards regression,\nmultiple linear regression, logistic regression, and other standard\nmethods applied to complex, weighted samples. Covariates used in\nthese analyses were the following risk factors for CVD measured or\nobserved at baseline: gender, race (specified as black or nonblack on\nNHANES I data forms), diabetes, and cigarette smoking (each as\nbinary variables), as well as age, body mass index, serum cholesterol,\nand mean arterial pressure calculated as one third systolic plus two\nthirds diastolic blood pressure.\nThe JNC VI classification of blood pressure for adults 18 years\nof age21 was also used. We assigned ordinal scale values of 1 to 5 to\nthe respective categories of optimal, normal but not optimal, high\nnormal, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 or higher hypertension.\nQuartiles of pulse pressure were calculated with the NHANES\ndetailed sample weights, which produced unequal numbers of\nsubjects in the 4 groups of our analysis cohort but represent equal\nnumbers of persons in the United States. For the same reason, the\napproximate median age at baseline of 45 years divides the cohort\ninto 2 groups of unequal size. Tests for trend in mean risk factor\nvalues across pulse pressure quartiles were made with linear regres-\nsion for continuous valued factors and logistic regression for the\nbinary factors (race, gender, smoking, and diabetes). All Cox\nproportional-hazards regression survival analyses are reported in\nterms of hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nPulse pressures and mean arterial pressures are expressed in units of\nResults\nKnown risk factors for CVD were assessed as a function of\nquartile of pulse pressure (Table 1). Increasing pulse pressure\nis associated with increasing age, body mass index, choles-\nterol level, and mean arterial pressure; an increasing percent-\nage of diabetics; and fewer cigarette smokers. The percent-\nages of blacks and women display significant U-shaped\ndistributions. A Cox regression analysis, adjusted for the\ninfluence of known CVD risk factors, including mean arterial\npressure level, assessed the effect of pulse pressure on overall\nmortality, CVD mortality, and CHD mortality. Tables 2\nthrough 4 display the results of these multivariate analyses.\nPulse pressure is significantly associated with total mortality\nin patients above the median age of 45 years and with CVD\nand CHD mortality in patients of all ages. Pulse pressure was\nmost strongly associated with the risk of CHD death (Table\n4). Mean arterial pressure is associated with total and CVD\ndeath in all ages and with CHD death in patients 46 years\nof age. Pulse pressure is not associated with an increase in\nnon-CVD. Compared with persons of other races, blacks are\nat increased risk for death from all causes and for death as a\nresult of CVD but not of CHD. No evidence was found of an\nTABLE 1.

It shows that pulse pressure retains its\nprognostic significance for cardiovascular death in persons of\nall ages. An increase in pulse pressure of 10 mm Hg in\npersons 45 years of age produces an estimated increase in\nthe risk of CVD death of 24%; the same increase in persons\n45 years of age predicts an increase in risk of 12%.\nDiscussion\nThis analysis assesses the significance of pulse pressure on\nthe risk of death in a cohort of patients that is specifically\ndesigned to be representative of the US population. It dem-\nonstrates that pulse pressure is associated with an increased\nrisk of all-cause, CVD, and CHD death independent of mean\narterial pressure but not with death from noncardiovascular\ncauses. Furthermore, it provides a quantitative estimate of the\nhazard ratios in the US population. Interestingly, blacks are at\ngreater risk for all-cause mortality than persons of other races,\na finding that appears to be based solely on non-CHD deaths.\nIn this cohort, they did not appear to be at increased risk for\ndeath from CHD.\nBy including the JNC VI classification as a covariate in a\nCox regression model with pulse pressure and the other CVD\nrisk factors, we have demonstrated that pulse pressure has\nprognostic significance independent of the JNC VI classifi-\ncation. A general approach to risk assessment in any data set\nusing blood pressure is improved by including both systolic\nand diastolic pressures. Because of the equivalence of the\ninformation conveyed by either mean arterial and pulse\npressures or systolic and diastolic blood pressures, the use of\neither pair in any regression model results in identical values\nof the statistical measure of fit of the models. Although\nsystolic blood pressure is a major prognostic determinate, the\ninclusion of information from diastolic or pulse pressure\n(which is systolic minus diastolic blood pressure) may add\nprognostic information, depending on the database examined.\nSystolic pressure includes substantial contributions from both\nthe steady-flow (mean arterial) and pulsatile (pulse pressure)\ncomponents of hemodynamic load. Our model includes mean\narterial and pulse pressures, which incorporate systolic and\ndiastolic pressures.\nThis analysis suggests that pulse pressure determination\nmay prove useful in further refining the assessment of\nprognosis.\nComparison With Other Studies\nA number of studies in diverse cohorts support the notion that\npulse pressure carries important, independent prognostic\ninformation.

In 1989,\nDarne et al8 reported their study of 27 000 French subjects in\nwhom pulse pressure was associated with cardiovascular\ndeath independent of other known risk factors, including\ndiastolic and mean arterial pressures. Madhavan et al6 studied\n2207 hypertensive patients in a union-sponsored hypertension\ncontrol program. In this study, an elevated pretreatment pulse\npressure was associated with adverse cardiovascular events.\nFang et al7 examined data on 5730 participants who entered\nAfter 5.4 years of follow-up, an elevated pulse pressure was\nidentified as the most important predictor of a subsequent\nmyocardial infarction. Domanski et al5 showed an association\nbetween pulse pressure and the risk of stroke in patients\nentered in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program\n(SHEP). Using a proportional-hazards model, they demon-\nstrated an 11% increase in the risk of stroke and a 16%\nincrease in total mortality for each 10 mm Hg increase in\npulse pressure.\nPatients entered in the Survival and Ventricular Enlarge-\nment (SAVE) trial were also studied.2 For the 2231 post\u00ad\nmyocardial infarction patients in the trial (left ventricular\nejection fraction 0.40), multivariate analysis showed pulse\npressure to be an independent predictor of all-cause mortality\nand myocardial infarction.\nPatients entered in the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunc-\ntion (SOLVD) study, who had left ventricular ejection frac-\ntion 0.35, were shown on multivariate analysis to have a\nstrong association of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular\ndeath with pulse pressure.1 In fact, in this study, an increase\nin mean arterial pressure was associated with reduced mor-\ntality, whereas an increase in pulse pressure was associated\nwith increased mortality. Across a wide spectrum of diseases\nfrom severe hypertension to heart failure with lowered mean\narterial pressure, an elevated pulse pressure was found to be\nan indicator of heightened CVD risk.\nChae et al3 followed 1621 healthy elderly subjects with no\nhistory of heart failure and a mean age of 77.9 years for an\naverage of 3.8 years. After adjustment for other CVD risk\nfactors, pulse pressure was shown to be independently asso-\nciated with the risk of developing heart failure.\nData from 50 years of follow-up of participants in the\nFramingham study demonstrated that pulse pressure, rather\nthan systolic or diastolic pressure, had the strongest associa-\ntion with mortality.4 Although Framingham comprises an\ninitially healthy cohort of adults in an eastern Massachusetts\ncity, the design of NHANES I provides a population that is\nrepresentative of the US population.\nPathophysiology Associated With Increased\nConduit Vessel Stiffness\nThere are a number of potential mechanisms by which\nincreased arterial stiffness could worsen prognosis. The\nloading caused by increased vascular stiffness has been\nshown to be associated with increased left ventricular\nmass.28\u00ad30 Increased pulse pressure is also associated with\nincreased intimal and medial thickness of the carotid ar-\ntery.31\u00ad33 Data from animal studies suggest that the ventricle\nis more susceptible to ischemia when the aorta is stiff34,35 and\nthat coronary occlusion results in greater ventricular\nAlthough the presence of atherosclerosis may increase\narterial stiffness, increased stiffening occurs even in popula-\ntions in which atherosclerosis is unusual, as demonstrated by\nthe work of Avolio et al11 in China. It is possible that aortic\nstiffening may be atherogenic. In a primate model, athero-\nsclerosis severity was found to increase with an increase in\npulsatile strain.37 In addition, increased pulse pressure has\nbeen associated with reduced NO production by the endothe-\nlium,38 which has been shown to be atherogenic.39 It should\nbe added that pulse pressure changes may occur with changes\nin stroke volume. Thus, an elevated pulse pressure should be\nviewed as both a marker of vascular disease and a contributor\nto disease progression.\nStudy Limitations\nCaution must be exercised in the interpretation of models of\nmortality in survey data based on death certificates. The\ncauses of death listed on death certificates are not always\naccurate.40 However, they are useful in establishing trends\nand have been shown to track well with studies of mortality\nthat used more accurate methods of ascertainment.41\nBecause the white-coat effect may raise initial blood\npressures measured in the office setting,42 a single measure-\nment can overestimate blood pressure levels. Multiple mea-\nsurements reduce the variability of the measurements.43\nClinical Implications and Conclusions\nThis study demonstrates and quantifies the prognostic impor-\ntance of pulse pressure in a cohort that is representative of the\nUS population. Because there is a functional component of\nTABLE 5.

The demonstration that pulse pressure adds\nprognostic information beyond that of known CVD risk\nfactors, including the JNC VI classification, suggests that it\nmay be useful as an additional factor in risk assessment for\nfuture therapeutic decision making.\nReferences\n1.
