Bond3\n1Centre for Cognition and Neuroimaging, Brunel University, United Kingdom.\n2Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.\n3Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths College, University of London, United Kingdom.\nWe investigated mental health and cognitive function in 195 community-dwelling adults aged 18 to 92 years (M =\n46.64). We assessed several cognitive domains, including psychomotor, executive function, and episodic memory.\nWe found a significant Age 3 Mental Health interaction in relation to within-person (WP) variability (trial-to-\ntrial variability in reaction time performance) in a four-choice psychomotor task and a Stroop task, but not in\nrelation to mean reaction time measures from those tasks. Poorer mental health was associated with greater WP\nvariability in older adults. We did not find this effect in relation to memory. The findings suggest that measures of\nWP variability may be sensitive to relatively subtle effects associated with age and poor mental health, and that\nthey provide valuable insights into cognitive function in old age.\nKey Words: Intraindividual--Variability--Depression--Anxiety.\nALTHOUGH investigation of reaction time (RT) mean\nperformance for a given cognitive task can provide\nvaluable information, there are good reasons to consider the\nwithin-person (WP) variability of RTs across trials of that task.\nThe suggestion that WP variability (also referred to as intrain-\ndividual variability) is indicative of neurobiological disturbance\nLi & Lindenberger, 1999) is supported by an accumulating body\nof research. For example, WP variability is greater with older\nHultsch, MacDonald, & Dixon, 2002; West, Murphy, Armilio,\nCraik, & Stuss, 2002), and also in relation to a range of con-\nditions involving some form of neurobiological disturbance (see\nMacDonald, Ba\n\u00a8ckman, & Nyberg, 2006, for review). Relative to\nmatched controls, WP variability is greater in the presence of\nmild cognitive impairment or mild dementia (Christensen et al.,\n2005; Hultsch, MacDonald, Hunter, Levy-Bencheton, &\nStrauss, 2000; Strauss, Bielak, Bunce, Hunter, & Hultsch,\n2007), traumatic brain injury (e.g., Stuss, Murphy, Binns, &\nParkinson's disease (Burton, Strauss, Hultsch, Moll, & Hunter,\nbehavioral work, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nwork in young adults (Bellgrove, Hester, & Garavan, 2004)\nsuggests that WP variability in a go\u00adno-go response paradigm\nwas systematically related to activity in the frontal cortex. A\nstructural MRI study by Anstey and colleagues (2007) in adults\naged 60 to 64 years found that WP variability was associated\nwith corpus callosum size in individuals with mild cognitive\ndisorders but not in individuals in a normative sample. Another\ninvestigation by this group in healthy older adults found that the\nextent of frontal white matter lesioning was associated with\nmeasures of WP variability but not with measures of processing\nspeed (mean RT), memory, or global cognition (Bunce et al.,\n2007). Together, this behavioral and brain imaging work sug-\ngests that WP variability (a) reflects neurobiological disturbance\nor decline and (b) is associated with systematic brain activity or\nstructures in the frontal cortex.\nAs research suggests that measures of WP variability may\nreflect disease pathology that involves the central nervous\nsystem, in the present study we addressed questions that have\nreceived little attention to date. That is, how far are measures of\nWP variability sensitive to mild psychopathology? Does age\nhave any bearing on associations where they exist? Specifically,\nwe were interested in the possibility that persons experiencing\npoor mental health in the form of mild depression or anxiety,\nsocial dysfunction, and loss of confidence, although functioning\napparently normally in their everyday lives, were more variable\nin their responding than were persons unaffected by such mild\npsychopathology. Additionally, it was important to assess\nwhether age had any bearing on these associations.\nTheoretically, there are both cognitive and neurobiological\nreasons to expect depression or anxiety, and relatedly, social\ndysfunction and loss of confidence, to affect cognitive\nperformance. Cognitive perspectives draw largely on resource\ntheory (e.g., Kahneman, 1973), and they emphasize attentional\nresource reductions and task-irrelevant thoughts. Specifically,\nthe cognitive capacity available to process information may be\nreduced (but not eliminated) in depressed persons, and this\ntogether with the tendency to deploy the remaining resources\ntoward depression-related thoughts results in cognitive deficits,\nparticularly in more effortful processing (Hartlage, Alloy,\nVazquez, & Dykman, 1993). Similarly, elevated anxiety may\naffect cognitive performance by detrimentally influencing ex-\necutive control mechanisms, and working memory in particular,\nsuch that reduced information-processing capacity and effi-\nciency results (e.g., Eysenck & Calvo, 1992).\nNeurobiological accounts include the glucocorticoid hypoth-\nesis (e.g., Sapolsky, 1999), which suggests that elevated stress\nlevels trigger the secretion of glucocorticoids. Although this\nmay serve beneficially in adapting to acute stressors, longer\nterm secretion may be harmful to the nervous system, particu-\nJournal of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES Copyright 2008 by The Gerontological Society of America\nlarly the hippocampus. Empirically, several studies have dem-\nonstrated cortisol-related deficits in memory (e.g., Lupien &\nResearch has also identified a high density of corticosteroid\nreceptors in the frontal lobes (Murros, Fogelholm, Kettunen, &\nVuorela, 1993), the brain structure held to support executive\nfunction (Cabeza & Nyberg, 2000). As glucocorticoid exposure\nincreases in old age (Sapolsky, 1999), and anxiety and depres-\nsion frequently occur together, this raises the possibility that\nolder persons experiencing anxiety or depression may be at\ngreater risk of cognitive deficits, particularly in domains reliant\non frontal systems. This possibility was underlined by recent\nwork (Stawski, Sliwinski, & Smyth, 2006) showing stress-\nrelated cognitive interference to be associated with poorer\nperformance on working memory and episodic memory tasks\nin older adults, and also research suggesting measures of\nexecutive function to account for depression-related cognitive\ndeficits in older adults (Elderkin-Thompson, Mintz, Haroon,\nAlthough studies exist that suggest an association between\nmental health and WP variability, the amount of research in\nthe area is limited. For instance, a recent investigation found\na significant positive association between WP variability and\nnegative affect in college students recording higher neuroticism\nscores (Robinson, Wilkowski, & Meier, 2006). A further study\nat the WP level that took age into account examined day-to-day\nvariability in stress and WP variability among young adults\n(Sliwinski, Smyth, Hofer, & Stawski, 2006). For a two-back\nworking memory task, a significant Stress 3 RT interaction\nsuggested that higher WP stress was associated with slower, but\nnot faster, RTs. Although there was a trend suggesting this\neffect was stronger in older adults, it was not significant.\nTogether, even though these investigations point to an asso-\nciation between poor mental health and intraindividual vari-\nability, it remains unclear as to whether this effect is stronger in\nolder adults relative to younger adults, and also whether\nmeasures of WP variability reveal associations when mean RT\nmeasures do not.\nIn the present study, we recorded self-reports of mental\nhealth through the 12-item General Health Questionnaire\ndeveloped to measure general health and included items\nrelating to both psychiatric and somatic complaints. A shorter\n12-item version was later developed that specifically assesses\nminor psychiatric disorders relating to state (rather than trait)\nfeelings. Research investigating the factor structure of this\nversion (e.g., Weneke, Goldberg, Yalcin, & U\n\u00a8 stu\nsee Ma\n\u00a8kikangas et al., 2006) suggests the scale to measure\nconstructs relating to anxiety and depression, social dysfunc-\ntion, and loss of confidence. The measure has been used exten-\nsively in various settings, and it effectively identifies persons\nwho would be classified as suffering a minor psychiatric\ndisorder (see Goldberg et al., 1997). Importantly from the\npresent perspective, a study in 5,438 persons (Goldberg et al.)\nshowed that age did not affect the scale's validity.\nIn addition, a correlation of 0.69 was reported between the\nGHQ-12 and the Beck Anxiety Inventory in an outpatient\nsample with anxiety disorders (Gao et al., 2004), and our own\nwork in a community-based sample (Bond & Bunce, 2000)\nproduced a mean correlation of 0.54 over four time points with\nthe Beck Depression Inventory. On the basis of earlier research,\nwe predicted that poor mental health, as recorded by the GHQ,\nwould be associated with poorer cognitive performance.\nBecause of the well-established evidence of age-related changes\ntheoretical rationale presented earlier whereby the mechanisms\nby which stress and depression affected cognitive function\ninvolved frontal regions and, relatedly, executive processes, we\nexpected that associations, where they existed, would be par-\nticularly strong in older adults.\nWe chose our cognitive variables to measure specific\ncognitive domains. We were particularly interested in psycho-\nmotor performance, because earlier studies (Bunce et al., 2004;\nMacDonald, Hultsch, & Bunce, 2006) have shown that older\nadults exhibit a greater response variability in such tasks. Our\nfirst aim was to compare standard measures of mean RT with\nWP variability metrics while taking age and mental health into\naccount. Was it the case that measures of WP variability were\nsensitive to subtle, but nonetheless important, effects that more\ncommonly used metrics were not? Our second aim, given the\nempirical research described earlier, was to assess episodic\nmemory and executive function in the expectation that they too\nwould be sensitive to Age 3 Mental Health associations.\nIndeed, as theoretical accounts of the mechanisms by which\nmental health influences cognition commonly suggest frontally\nmodulated or executive control mechanisms, we reasoned that\nwhere Age 3 Mental Health associations were found in relation\nto memory and psychomotor tasks, they would be accounted\nfor by independent measures of executive function. Our third\naim, therefore, was to test this possibility.\nMETHODS\nParticipants\nThrough local organizations (e.g., bridge clubs) and re-\nsearcher contacts, we recruited healthy persons living in the\ncommunity for the study. During the initial screening,\nparticipants provided details of their health (including psychi-\natric conditions) and medications. Two persons reported\nneurological conditions (Parkinson's disease and minor stroke);\nwe did not test them further. The remaining 195 persons (53%\n65 years for cognitive impairment by using the Mini-Mental\nState Examination (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). In\nthis study, we included only those individuals recording a score\nof 26 or higher on that examination. Apart from conditions\ntypically found in older persons (e.g., blood pressure or prostate\nproblems), all participants were free of major health or mental\nhealth disorders. None reported using antidepressants. We\nmeasured verbal IQ through the National Adult Reading Test\n(NART; Nelson, 1982), and here we report estimated full-scale\nfor biographical, NART, and GHQ variables are presented in\nMental Health\nthat assesses mental health through various questions (e.g.,\nHave you recently. . . ``lost much sleep over worry,'' ``felt that\nyou couldn't overcome your difficulties,'' ``been losing\nconfidence in yourself''). We utilized the widely used Likert\nmethod of scoring, in which each item was scored 0 (not at all)\nto 3 (much more than usual). We report the scale mean, in\nwhich higher scores indicate poorer mental health. A Cronbach\nalpha of a \u00bc .89 suggested that internal consistency was good\nfor this scale.\nCognitive Tasks\nEpisodic memory. --We created a list of 40 semantically\ntarget words presented at a rate of 5 s per word on a personal\ncomputer (PC) screen. At test following several other tasks, we\nhad the 20 target words randomly intermixed with 20 distracter\nwords and individually presented on the PC screen for 5 s each.\nResearchers instructed the participants to respond ``yes'' for\ntarget words and ``no'' for distracter words by using designated\nkeyboard keys. We recorded the hits and false alarms. In order\nto take response bias into account, here we report on adjusted\nhits (i.e., hits minus false alarms).\nExecutive function. --Recent research suggests that executive\nfunction is characterized as involving separable but related\nprocesses of switching between mental sets, monitoring and\nupdating working memory, and inhibiting prepotent responses\n(Miyake, Friedman, Emerson, Witzki, & Howerter, 2000).\nTherefore, we selected our measures of executive function to\nreflect these constructs. For switching, we used the Alternate\nCategory Task (Parkin, Walter, & Hunkin, 1995), which\nrequired the alternate generation of as many unique animal and\ncountry names as possible within 1 minute. We awarded a point\nfor each successful animal\u00adcountry switch. We summed the\npoints to give a total score that reflected set-switching\nperformance.\nFor updating, we presented 105 digits from 1 to 9 individ-\nually on a PC screen at a rate of 1 s each. Embedded at random\nintervals were 11 strings of three odd numbers. We instructed\nparticipants to press the keyboard spacebar each time they\ndetected a string of three odd numbers. Thus, for each digit\npresentation, the individual had to update working memory in\norder to detect three continuous odd-number presentations. We\nrecorded the correct detections (hits) and false alarms. Here, in\norder to take response bias into account, we report adjusted hits\nas a summary measure of updating working memory.\nFor inhibition, we used a version of the Stroop color\u00adword\ntask administered on a PC as a measurement. Participants were\nrequired to respond to the ink color (red, blue, yellow, or green)\nof the printed words red, blue, yellow, and green by using the\nappropriate keyboard key. We administered 16 practice trials,\nfollowed by 96 pseudorandomized test trials, half of which\nwere congruent (word\u00adcolor matched) and half of which were\nincongruent (word\u00adcolor not matched). We computed measures\nof mean RT and WP variability for this task (see the paragraphs\nthat follow).\nPsychomotor. --We administered two-choice RT (2-CRT)\nand four-choice RT (4-CRT) tasks by means of a PC. In the\ntwo-choice version of the task, a black disk (0.5 cm in\ndiameter) was presented pseudorandomly either left or right of\na central fixation cross. In the four-choice version of the task,\nthe black disk appeared in one of four locations (lower or upper\nleft or right). Participants were required to press designated\nkeyboard keys that mapped spatially onto the position of the\ndisk on the screen as quickly but as accurately as possible. We\ncounterbalanced the tasks across participants, and in each\ncondition we administered 20 practice trials prior to 100 test\ntrials.\nComputation of Mean RT and WP Variability\nFor correct trials of the Stroop and 2-CRT and 4-CRT tasks\nwe computed mean RT, and the intraindividual standard\ndeviation (ISD) as a measure of WP variability, following the\nprocedures of Hultsch and colleagues (2002). We inspected\ndata distributions for the respective tasks for any extremely fast\nor slow latencies that may reflect various sources of error (e.g.,\naccidental key presses, task interruption). In order to eliminate\nsuch trials, we set a lower boundary of 150 ms, and an upper\nboundary of the individual mean RT \u00fe 3 SD, beyond which\ntrials were excluded. We replaced the eliminated RTs with the\nage group mean RT for that particular task. For the Stroop task,\nno trials were replaced at the lower bound, but for the upper\ncongruent and incongruent conditions were replaced. For 2-\nwere replaced for this reason. As removing outliers and\nreplacing missing values in this way reduces variability, the\nTable 1.

NART \u00bc National Adult Reading\nTest (estimated full-scale IQ); GHQ-12 \u00bc 12-item General Health Question-\nnaire (scale average score).\nprocedure represents a conservative approach to the study of\nWP variability.\nFor each task, we computed mean RT from the raw correct\nresponse latencies, and for WP variability, we computed the\nISD. Because the raw ISD increases in direct relation to\nage-related increases in RT, it is appropriate to statistically\npartial out such systematic age differences from ISD measures.\nOtherwise, larger ISDs are confounded by older adults' slower\nresponding relative to that of younger adults. Similarly, trial-to-\ntrial variance may reflect learning effects, or other systematic\ntime-on-task influences. Therefore, we used a regression pro-\ncedure (Hultsch et al., 2002) to partial out the effects of\nchronological age, and trial-related (i.e., trial number) variation\nin responding from ISDs, and their higher order interaction.\nSpecifically, we regressed RTs on chronological age (entered\nas a continuous variable) and trial number to produce residuals\nthat were statistically independent of differences stemming\nfrom either of those sources. We then converted the residual\nscores to t scores (M \u00bc 50, SD \u00bc10) to facilitate comparisons\nacross tasks, and then we used them to compute ISDs. As\nnonsignificant correlations between GHQ and mean RT sug-\ngested that RTs did not vary according to GHQ (see Table 2),\nwe did not enter GHQ scores into this procedure.\nFor the Stroop task, as congruent and incongruent conditions\nfor the respective measures were highly correlated (mean RT \u00bc\ntwo conditions as summary measures of mean RT and WP\nvariability.\nMissing Data\nAcross the 195 participants, for missing data on a minority of\nvariables (i.e., updating\u00bc2.1%, inhibition\u00bc0.5%), we imputed\nvalues with the EM algorithm in SPSS by using all of the\nvariables in the present study (see Shafer & Graham, 2002).\nRESULTS\nBivariate correlations together with means and standard\ndeviations for the respective variables are presented in Table 2.\nIn most cases, age correlated with the cognitive variables in the\ndirection expected. Older age was significantly associated with\nlower recognition scores, slower RTs, and greater WP\nvariability. Older age was also associated with higher NART\nscores. There were associations between executive function and\nWP variability in the direction expected; higher switching\nscores were significantly correlated with lower variability in\nboth the 2-CRT and 4-CRT tasks, and also the Stroop task. In\naddition, higher updating scores were significantly associated\nwith lower variability in the 4-CRT task. The correlation\nbetween age and GHQ scores was nonsignificant. Correlations\nbetween GHQ and cognitive variables were predominantly\nnonsignificant, the exception being that higher GHQ scores\nwere associated with greater WP variability in the 4-CRT task.\nAssociations between gender and the other variables were all\nnonsignificant.\nWe used a series of hierarchical multiple regression models\nto explore the relationship between age, mental health, and the\ncognitive variables. As NART scores were associated with both\nage and several of the cognitive measures, we computed all of\nthe models having adjusted for that variable at Step 1. This\nprocedure controls for the possibility that age differences in\nIQ underlie age differences in the cognitive variables, and,\ntherefore, act as a confound. At Step 2, we entered chrono-\nlogical age and GHQ scores, followed by the Age 3 GHQ\ncross-product interaction term at Step 3. It is important that, if\nStep 3 significantly added to the variance (R2) explained in the\ncognitive variable having taken age and GHQ scores into\naccount, then it would suggest that the strength of association\nbetween mental health and cognitive function varied according\nto age. As a result of the number of regression models\nexamined, we set alpha conservatively at p , .01.\nThe results of the hierarchical multiple regressions are\npresented in Table 3. At Step 2, the beta weights suggest that\nthe respective associations between age and GHQ scores and\nthe other variables did not differ greatly from the bivariate\ncorrelations reported in Table 2. Age independently predicted\nStroop and 4-CRT intraindividual variability. Of particular\ninterest, though, was Step 3, where the Age 3 GHQ cross-\nproduct interaction term was entered. For the majority of\nvariables, entry of this term did not add significantly to the\nvariance explained in the cognitive measures. However, for the\nWP variability in the Stroop and 4-CRT tasks, that interaction\nTable 2. Bivariate Correlations Between Age, Cognitive, and Mental Health Variables\nNotes: Gender 1 \u00bc Men, 2 \u00bc Women; NART \u00bc National Adult Reading Test; 2-CRT or 4-CRT \u00bc two- or four-choice reaction time; ISD \u00bc intraindividual\nstandard deviation; GHQ \u00bc General Health Questionnaire-12.\nterm was significant. In both instances, the equivalent inter-\nactions for mean RT were nonsignificant (ps . .90). Regression\nlines for the significant interaction terms are presented in Figure\n1. Although the Stroop task exhibited greater variability overall,\nin both tasks, for persons with low GHQ scores, greater age is\nnot associated with a marked increase in WP variability.\nImportantly, however, for individuals recording higher GHQ\nscores, not only is WP variability greater, but the degree of\nvariability increases with older age. In other words, poorer\nmental health is having a greater impact on the response\nvariability of older persons.\nIt is of note that the significant Age 3 GHQ interaction was\nfound for ISDs in the more demanding 4-CRT task and not for\nthe two-choice version of the task. As this may reflect\na selective effect related to task demands (i.e., the increase\nfrom two to four choices), we repeated the regression model,\nbut this time we controlled for 2-CRT ISD at Step 1. This made\nno difference to our original finding. As this procedure effec-\ntively controls for the WP variability attributable to the two-\nchoice task and leaves residuals reflecting the increase from two\nto four response choices, the finding supports the view that it is\nWP variability in the more effortful psychomotor condition that\nis particularly sensitive to Age 3 Mental Health relations.\nWe also wished to confirm that our regression procedure for\nremoving age and time-on-task influences on RT from ISD\nmetrics had been successful and had no bearing on the current\nfindings. Therefore, we repeated the regression models for\nStroop and 4-CRT ISDs, but this time we controlled for the\nrespective mean RT measures at Step 1. Although in both cases\nthe first-order effects for age and GHQ were attenuated, the\nAge 3 GHQ interactions were unaffected (Stroop \u00c1R2 \u00bc .03,\neffects for WP variability were independent of mean RT.\nFinally, our further aim in this study was to assess if the\nindependent measures of executive function accounted for\nsignificant Age 3 GHQ interactions where they were found.\nThis was of particular interest, given (a) the finding of\na significant Age 3 GHQ interaction in respect to Stroop and\n4-CRT ISDs, and (b) the theoretical role of executive control in\nmental health\u00adcognition relations, and also in explanations of\nWP variability. Therefore, we ran a further series of regression\nmodels for Stroop and 4-CRT ISDs, but, respectively, we\ncontrolled at Step 1 for switching, updating, and, in the case\nof 4-CRT, inhibition. If the respective executive function\nmeasures accounted for the associations found in the original\nmodels, then the effect size of the Age 3 GHQ interaction\nwould be attenuated in these repeated analyses. When adjusting\nfor switching and updating, we found that only marginal\nattenuation occurred (for 4-CRT controlling for switching,\nupdating, \u00c1R2 \u00bc .03, p , .01). However, when examining\n4-CRT ISDs having controlled for Stroop ISDs, we found that\nR2 was markedly attenuated (\u00c1R2 \u00bc .01, p . .06). This latter\nfinding suggests that variability in inhibition is accounting for\nsome of the Age 3 GHQ-related variability in 4-CRT.\nDISCUSSION\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate age,\nmental health, and WP variability in a continuous age range\nspanning young adulthood to persons in their early 90s. The\nwork extends research describing an association between\nintraindividual variability and neurological disorders, and it\nsuggests that having mild mental health problems (i.e.,\ndepression and anxiety, social dysfunction, loss of confidence)\nin old age is associated with variability in cognitive per-\nformance. Several important findings were produced. First,\nalthough the association between mental health and cognitive\nfunction did not vary according to age for the majority of\nvariables, significant Age3GHQ interactions were produced in\nrelation to WP variability in the Stroop and 4-CRT tasks.\nPoorer mental health and older age were associated with greater\nvariability. Importantly, a dissociation was evident, as measures\nof mean RT for those variables were not similarly related to age\nand mental health. Second, the association for 4-CRT remained\neven when we controlled for the two-choice equivalent of this\nmeasure, suggesting the effect was selective to the more\neffortful task condition. Finally, the significant Age 3 Mental\nHealth interaction in relation to 4-CRT WP variability was\naccounted for by executive function measures of inhibition, but\nnot by switching or updating. Overall, the findings were\nunrelated to gender, and they were independent of verbal IQ.\nThe present findings build on earlier research at the WP level\nthat found a weak but nonsignificant association between age,\nday-to-day stress, and variability (Sliwinski et al., 2006). It is\nTable 3. Hierarchical Regression Analyses: Cognitive Variable Regressed on Age, GHQ-12, and the\nAge 3 GHQ Cross-Product Interaction Term\nSwitching Updating Stroop (ms) Stroop ISD Recognition 2-CRT (ms) 2-CRT ISD 4-CRT (ms) 4-CRT ISD\nNotes: NART \u00bc National Adult Reading Test; GHQ-12 \u00bc 12-item General Health Questionnaire; CRT \u00bc Choice Reaction Time; ISD \u00bc Intraindividual\nimportant that the dissociations found here suggest that\nvariability measures may be sensitive to relatively subtle\neffects of age and mild mental health problems, whereas\nmeasures of mean RT are not. This sensitivity to mild effects is\nunderlined by the observation that persons aged 18 to 29, 30 to\nline with functioning community-dwelling persons in those age\nbands elsewhere (Mullarkey, Wall, Warr, Clegg, & Stride,\n1999). This suggests that participants were representative of the\nnormal population and were not experiencing major mental\nhealth problems.\nThe reason for the dissociation with mean RT measures may\nbe related to the finding that increased WP variability is largely\ndue to a greater proportion of slower responses falling into the\ntail of the individual's RT distribution (e.g., Spieler, Balota, &\nmay represent fluctuations in executive control (Bunce et al.,\n2004; West et al.) or, relatedly, attentional lapses (Bunce,\nWarr, & Cochrane, 1993), although this latter view has been\nquestioned (Salthouse, 1993). It was noted earlier that attentional\nresources may be reduced in depression, and that task-irrelevant\ndepressive thoughts may result in cognitive deficits, particularly\nin more effortful processing (Hartlage et al., 1993). As the\ncognitive effects of depression are modulated by frontally\nsupported executive processes, and as fluctuations in these\nprocesses are thought to underlie WP variability, it is plausible\nthat measures of intraindividual variability are more sensitive to\nthe deleterious influence of poor mental health at a lower\nthreshold than mean RT measures. Had our participants been\nexperiencing greater mental health problems, we would expect\nmeasures of mean RT to capture Age 3 GHQ associations too.\nThe present dissociations underline the possibility that WP\nvariability is a particularly sensitive behavioral marker of\ncognitive or neurobiological disturbance. Indeed, regarding the\nlatter point, recent research (Bunce et al., 2007) has shown that,\nin a relatively young (60\u00ad64 years) group of healthy older adults,\nthat white matter lesioning of the frontal cortex is related to WP\nvariability, but not mean RT, for the same psychomotor task.\nThis work, together with the findings of the present study, clearly\nsuggests that measures of WP variability have the potential to\ndetect associations or conditions in circumstances where more\ncommonly used measures of accuracy and mean RT do not.\nTherefore, the measures may provide a valuable addition to\nscreening and assessment batteries in health care settings.\nTwo further aims of the study were to assess how far\nexecutive function and memory varied as a function of age and\nmental health, and also to establish if findings for WP variability\nwere accounted for by measures of executive control. Although\nthere was no evidence that memory varied according to age and\nmental health, our research did show that, consistent with\nresearch elsewhere (e.g., Elderkin-Thompson et al., 2006;\nSheline et al., 2006), executive function was associated with\nmental health-related cognitive deficits in older adults. Specif-\nically, we found a significant Age3Mental Health interaction in\nrespect to inhibition, but not in relation to measures of switching\nand updating. This finding is consistent with the view that\na failure to inhibit intrusive thoughts related to depression and\nanxiety, social dysfunction, and loss of confidence underlies\nmental-health-related cognitive deficits, and that reduced\nattentional resources in old age exacerbates this effect.\nThis interpretation was underlined by the additional finding\nthat the Age 3 GHQ interaction in respect to 4-CRT variability\nwas substantially attenuated when we controlled for variability in\nthe Stroop task, our measure of inhibition. One should exercise\ncaution when interpreting this latter finding, however, because of\nstatistical concerns relating to variance-partitioning procedures,\nand population mean confounds, in cross-sectional samples (e.g.,\nHofer & Sliwinski, 2001; Lindenberger & Po\nSliwinski & Hofer, 1999). Furthermore, consideration of Table\n2 suggests that the respective measures of executive function\nwere weakly correlated, and Table 3 indicates there was little\nshared variance between age and both switching and updating.\nAs these findings were unexpected, it raises the possibility that\nthe present measures did not capture those constructs with\nFigure 1. Regression lines for the Age 3 GHQ interaction in\nrelation to (a) four-choice reaction time within-person variability, and\n(b) Stroop within-person variability (GHQ \u00bc General Health\nQuestionnaire-12; ISD \u00bc intraindividual standard deviation).\nsufficient rigor and that alternative measures should be\nconsidered for future research. Despite these limitations, though,\nwe believe the findings relating to the measure of inhibition have\npotentially important theoretical implications that should be\ninvestigated further through longitudinal research.\nThere are several further limitations to the present study that\nwe should acknowledge. First, as noted, cross-sectional data\nwere used, and therefore we are unable to draw any conclusions\nconcerning causality. Second, although the finding of a signif-\nicant Age3GHQ interaction in relation to WP variability in the\n4-CRT but not the 2-CRT task suggests that it is during more\neffortful processing, which places greater demands on execu-\ntive control, that mental health\u00adcognition effects are strongest,\nwe did not independently measure the perceived workload\nassociated with the respective tasks. Therefore, we cannot\nconfirm that an increase in perceived demands occurred, and\naccordingly, that interpretation should be treated with appro-\npriate caution. Finally, although the GHQ possesses good\npsychometric properties and is widely used as a measure of\nmental health (Goldberg et al., 1997), the short version we used\ndoes not specifically delineate between anxiety and depression.\nTherefore, although we can assume that participants recording\nhigher GHQ scores were experiencing elevated anxiety or\ndepression, it is not possible to say which. Current work in our\nlaboratories involving an independent sample of adults\ndistinguishes between those mental health constructs and will\nshed light on this issue.\nTo conclude, the finding of significant Age 3 Mental Health\ninteractions in respect to WP variability, but not measures of\nmean RT, raises the possibility that moment-to-moment\nfluctuations in information processing may characterize the\ninfluence of poor mental health on cognition in older persons.\nThis finding not only is of theoretical interest but also suggests\nthat measures of WP variability are sensitive to relatively\nsubtle, but nonetheless important, mental-health-related effects\nthat may be masked in other metrics and cognitive measures.\nAs the present study builds on research suggesting that\nmeasures of WP variability and mean RT dissociate in the\npresence of possible disease pathology, it is plausible that\nmeasures of WP variability may not only provide valuable\ntheoretical insights but also have considerable potential for\nassessment and diagnostic purposes in health care contexts. It is\nimportant for future research to explore this potential further.\n"
