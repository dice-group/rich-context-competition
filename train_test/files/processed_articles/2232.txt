Taken together, these\nthree areas show early promise for state suicide prevention efforts.\nConclusions: In each of the states, NVDRS data analyses are being shared with injury prevention\ncolleagues, suicide prevention planning groups and policymakers, and adapted to respond to unique state\nand local suicide problems. A powerful surveillance tool, the NVDRS is bringing new clarity and direction\nto these state-based efforts. The NVDRS can serve as a model for other countries looking to establish timely\nsuicide surveillance systems and data driven prevention strategies.\nSuicide is the eighth leading cause of death among males\nin the US, and the eleventh leading cause overall.1 Yet it\nis only within the past couple of decades that suicide has\nbeen framed as a preventable public health problem.2 The\nSurgeon General's 1999 Call to action to prevent suicide3 and the\n2001 National strategy for suicide prevention4 called for the\ncreation of surveillance systems to better define and track the\nproblem and guide and evaluate interventions. Responding to\nthis call, and backed by the Institute of Medicine's report,\nReducing suicide: a national imperative,5 which explicitly\nrecommended the adoption of the National Violent Death\nReporting System, the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) established the NVDRS in 2002.\nThe NVDRS is currently implemented in 17 states.\nPreviously, death certificates were the only ongoing data\nsource on suicides, supplying limited information such as\ndecedent demographics, place and date of death, and method\nof death. The NVDRS augments these data by linking to it\ninformation from death investigation reports filed by\ncoroners, medical examiners, and law enforcement that\nilluminate why the victim ended his or her life.6 Data include\ntoxicological test results; the victim's mental health and\ntreatment status; previous suicide attempts and threats; and\nwhether the victim was coping with problems involving\nphysical health, intimate partner relationships, school, work,\nand other issues. The CDC contracts with a state agency\n(usually the state health department) to collect the data\nusing software supplied by the CDC. The state agency\ncontrols the manner in which the data are collected and\nreleased locally and can add state defined data elements. The\ndata are forwarded to the CDC's national database stripped of\npersonally identifying information.\nThe systematic collection of state level data on the\nprecipitating circumstances associated with suicide was\nstates in the nation responded to the Surgeon General's call\nto action by establishing statewide planning bodies to chart a\ncourse for reducing suicide.7 The only local data to guide\nthese early efforts were death certificates; most states relied\non psychological autopsy studies conducted in other states or\nother countries to describe risk factors and precipitating\ncircumstances.8\nThis article describes how the more detailed state level data\nmade available by the NVDRS have been used thus far in\nseven states that were early adopters of the NVDRS: Alaska,\nColorado, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina,\nand Virginia. Alaska and Colorado began data collection in\nthe relatively early phases of data collection and analysis,\ntheir suicide prevention efforts currently fall into three areas:\n1. describing the problem of suicide and identifying\nopportunities for intervention;\n2. collaborating on statewide suicide prevention plans; and\n3. forming new partnerships for targeted prevention\ninitiatives.\nThe case definition for data noted throughout this paper is\ndecedents who were residents of one of the seven NVDRS\nstates, who died during the data collection year (2004 for\nAlaska and Colorado, 2003 for the remainder), and whose\ndeath certificate indicated an underlying cause of death in\nInternational Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, US\nversion). We used the Pearson x2 statistic when comparing\nthe proportion of victim groups for whom various circum-\nstances were endorsed.\nAbbreviations: CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;\nNCHS, National Center for Health Statistics; NVDRS, National Violent\nDeath Reporting System; SUPRE, Suicide Prevention; WHO, World\nHealth Organization.\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nThe NVDRS data enable states to examine the demographic\ncharacteristics of the groups at highest risk for suicide in the\nstate (table 1) as well as those circumstances preceding\nsuicide that may assist in tailoring prevention strategies\nNationally, 2003 marked the first year in which the age\nhowever, and in some of the NVDRS states, elder suicide\nrates continued to outstrip that of younger age groups\n(table 1). Oregon had the sixth highest elder suicide rate in\nthe nation;1 Oregon VDRS personnel examined the circum-\nstances noted in elders' death investigation reports and\nlearned that most were coping with a physical health\nproblem and that 37% had visited a physician in the last\n30 days (fig 1). While psychological autopsy studies are\ndivided on whether physical illness is an independent risk\nfactor for suicide after controlling for depressive illness,9 the\nfinding does suggest the critical role that healthcare providers\ncan play in screening for, and responding to, suicide risk.\nMid-life adult men make up the largest number of suicide\ndecedents, and strategies for reaching out to this group have\nnot yet been well developed.10 The Colorado site investigated\nthe occupations of decedents and found that construction\nwas the most frequently noted industry, accounting for 14%\nof the state's 776 suicide victims ages 18 and older (male and\nfemale) in 2004. This suggests that unions and construction\nemployers may serve as potential new partners for targeting\nthis population. Also in Colorado, 30 suicide victims aged 18\nand older died either during attempted arrest, while under\narrest or while in jail or prison, suggesting the need to work\nwith law enforcement and criminal justice personnel on\nminimizing suicide risk.\nThe Virginia site's report on 2003 deaths noted that,\noverall, one in four suicide decedents had served in the armed\nservices and, among males ages 65 or over, nearly 60% were\nveterans. Although veterans did not appear to be over-\nrepresented among suicide decedents (61% of US men over\nthe age of 65 are veterans), the finding does suggest a venue\n(veteran's hospitals and services) for reaching older men to\nscreen for suicide risk. For instance, the Virginia Department\nof Veteran's Services reported 17 194 hospital admissions and\nthese numbers represent a profound potential for assess-\nments and referrals for suicide prevention (personal com-\nmunication with Fred Fralin, Benefits Services Manager,\nMaryland's VDRS data suggest the need for different\nprevention strategies for women and men. Both the highest\nrates and the largest number of female victims were those\nthe death investigation report provided at least partial\ninformation on circumstances associated with the suicide\nproportion of women than men were noted as being in\ncurrent mental health treatment (p,0.01). These findings\nsuggest that interventions focused on improving mental\nhealthcare are an indicated strategy for women in this age\ngroup, but relying solely on that strategy for men may miss a\nsignificant portion of potential victims.\nVictims who have not previously come to the attention of\nthe mental healthcare system pose a unique challenge to\nsuicide prevention. The New Jersey VDRS project investigated\nwho these victims are. Among New Jersey cases about which\ncircumstance information was available, there was no\ndocumentation of a mental health disorder or a previous\nsuicide attempt in over 40% of the cases. These suicides\ndiffered from those for whom a previous mental health\nhistory was documented in several important ways: they\nwere more likely to occur among non-whites and the foreign-\nborn and were more likely to be committed with a firearm.\nThese findings are being shared with suicide prevention\npolicymakers in the state.\nOne objective of the National strategy for suicide prevention was\nto increase the number of states with a comprehensive\nsuicide plan in order to focus intervention efforts, resources,\nand funding. Six of the seven NVDRS states that are the\nsubject of this paper have released suicide prevention plans,\nand the seventh is in the process of developing one with the\nassistance of NVDRS data.7 Three of the state's plans focus\nonly on youth suicide, but at least two of these are currently\ndeveloping plans for other age groups, again with the\nassistance of NVDRS data. Particularly in these early stages\nof data collection and report release, surveillance data from\nthe NVDRS are re-energizing the planning process in several\nstates.\nCollaborations between NVDRS sites and statewide suicide\nprevention groups were strongest among the first-wave\nNVDRS adopters (Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, South\nCarolina, Virginia), as most of these had already released\nFor example, in Oregon where suicides outnumbered\nHealth problem Saw a doctor in past\nFigure 1 Proportion of male suicide victims ages 65 or over whose\ndeath investigation report noted a health problem or a recent physician\nIn current mental health treatment (p0.01)\nFigure 2 Proportion of suicide victims 45\u00ad59 years old whose death\ninvestigation report noted they were in current mental health treatment,\nUsing NVDRS data for suicide prevention ii29\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nTable 1 Suicide in seven study sites: selected characteristics\nAlaska* Colorado Maryland New Jersey Oregon\u00c0 South Carolina Virginia\nn Rate` n Rate n Rate n Rate n Rate n Rate n Rate\nGender\nRace\nEthnicity\nAge (years)\nUnknown 1 NA\nMechanism of injury n % n % n % n % n % n % n %\n*Data for Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, and Virginia reflect 2003 violent deaths to the state's resident population.

According to NCHS standards, rates based on fewer than 20 cases are considered unreliable for analysis purposes.\nii30 Powell, Barber, Hedegaard, et al\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\npriority. While Oregon had already developed a youth suicide\nprevention plan, it released the Oregon Older Adult Suicide\nPrevention Plan in early 2006. Oregon's VDRS data and\npersonnel took a lead role in defining the scope and\ncharacteristics of this plan. The Oregon site has added state\ndefined data elements to the system, such as the date of the\nvictim's last physician visit, in response to local planning\nneeds. Oregon has also released a fact sheet on elder suicide.\nLike Oregon, Virginia had already released a youth suicide\nprevention plan for the state. The Virginia VDRS site is a\nmember of the group that is now developing the state's\nlifespan approach to suicide prevention. Virginia is a 2005\nrecipient of federal Garret Lee Smith Memorial Act funds for\nyouth suicide prevention, and the NVDRS site is supplying\ndata to assist in planning interventions.\nNew Jersey's VDRS program is immersed in a wide\nnetwork of suicide prevention collaborations and is recog-\nnized as a critical resource for collaborative work on suicide\nprevention. New Jersey has not previously released a state\nplan and is currently developing a lifespan suicide prevention\nplan. NVDRS data are being used in that effort. Preliminary\ndata from the New Jersey VDRS were used by the New Jersey\nteam when they participated in the Suicide Prevention\nResource Center's Bi-Regional Suicide Prevention\nConference in June 2005. This conference was geared\ntowards assisting states in developing their plans.\nIn South Carolina, data collection started with year 2003\ndeaths and immediately began to impact suicide prevention\nin the state. Preliminary data were used in the South Carolina\nSuicide Prevention Strategic Plan, which was released in\nJune 2005. The overall focus of the plan is to increase public\nawareness of suicide as a public health problem. The State\nSuicide Prevention Strategic Plan led to formation of the\nSouth Carolina Suicide Prevention Coalition. NVDRS staff in\nSouth Carolina and the State Department of Health and\nEnvironmental Control participate in this new Coalition.\nThe final use of NVDRS data is in sparking new or renewed\npartnerships between NVDRS agencies and other state or\nlocal agencies focused on suicide or violence prevention.\nThese new partnerships put surveillance data into the hands\nof subject matter experts who apply them in developing or\nevaluating interventions.\nAlaska's VDRS initiatives will assist researchers and injury\nprevention specialists in three areas. The first is the firearm\nlocker installation program, which is conducted jointly by\nHarborview Injury Prevention and the Alaska Tribal Native\nHealth Consortium-Injury Prevention Programs. The suicide\nrate in Alaska is among the highest in the nation, and is\nAlaskan natives. Since many high risk populations in Alaska\nparticipate in subsistence and sport hunting, the firearm\nlocker installation program has two functions: to prevent\naccidental discharge by a youth and to hinder easy access to\nloaded firearms during chemical intoxication and/or a mental\nhealth crisis. Second, the Alaska Departments of Law and\nPublic Safety is collaborating with the Alaska VDRS project to\nprovide expanded analyses and more specific data on the\nenvironment, weapons, and victim/perpetrator histories in\ndomestic violence related death events. A dangerous time for\na victim of intimate partner abuse is when she or he is\nattempting to leave the relationship. As legislative statutes\nand regulations are developed, evaluated, and modified in the\narea of domestic violence, this partnership will identify\nstrategies that are most effective in protecting victims of\nabuse. Third, the Alaska VDRS data will be used to\ncomplement forensic data from suicide cases as part of the\nAlaska Suicide Follow-Back Study. Designed as a psycholo-\ngical autopsy study to review circumstances leading to a\nsuicide attempt, including review of medical and school\nrecords, this study is being conducted by the Alaska Injury\nPrevention Center through the Alaska Statewide Suicide\nPrevention Council\nVirginia's VDRS project is taking advantage of the incident-\nbased feature of the NVDRS to describe multiple victim\nincidents, such as murder-suicides, homicides with multiple\nvictims, and suicide pacts. Of the 39 multiple victim death\nevents identified for 2003, 18 were family or intimate partner\nhomicides, and in 14 of these the suspect also took his own\nlife. Using these data as a springboard, collaborations are\nnow underway between VDRS project staff and the Virginia\nSexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance to use\nVirginia's VDRS data to understand the dynamics of\nmurder-suicides and intimate partner violence perpetration.\nAlso in Virginia, publication of a statistical overview of\nVirginia's VDRS data from 2003 has prompted requests for\ndetailed community level portraits of suicide victims,\ncircumstances, and mechanisms of injury to assist localities\nin understanding and preventing suicide in their own\ncommunities. This Virginia Department of Health collabora-\ntive effort is between NVDRS staff in the Office of the Chief\nMedical Examiner and the Center for Injury and Violence\nPrevention.\nLIMITATIONS\nNVDRS data on the circumstances that precede suicide\ndepend upon the completeness and quality of the death\ninvestigation reports from which they are drawn. Coroners,\nmedical examiners, and law enforcement vary from one\njurisdiction to the next and from one individual to the next in\nthe types of questions they ask during a death investigation,\nwho they ask, and whether and how thoroughly they record\nthe information. What may appear to be, for example, a\nhigher treatment rate among victims in one jurisdiction over\nanother may in fact reflect one medical examiner's office\nmore thorough documentation than another's. It is impor-\ntant, therefore, particularly as the system grows to a 50-state\nsystem, to work toward greater uniformity in death\ninvestigation procedures and documentation. As NVDRS\nsites apply the data to local injury problems and share results\nwith the death investigators who supplied the data, this\nshould become easier to do.\nCONCLUSION\nTaken together, these three areas of use for NVDRS data--\nbetter describing the problem and identifying opportunities\nfor prevention, revitalizing strategic planning processes\nwithin states, and forging new partnerships for prevention\ninitiatives--show early promise for state suicide prevention\nefforts. In each of these seven states, NVDRS data analyses\nare being shared with injury prevention colleagues, suicide\nprevention planning groups and policymakers, and are being\nadapted to respond to unique suicide problems. A powerful\nsurveillance tool, the NVDRS is bringing new clarity and\ndirection to these state based efforts.\nAt the same time, the need for suicide prevention strategies\non the international level has been recognized. The World\nHealth Organization (WHO) describes suicide as a largely\npreventable public health problem and has acknowledged\nthat greater reliability is needed in suicide reporting within\ncountries.11 This is one of the components of WHO's suicide\nprevention (SUPRE) program, a worldwide initiative that\nalso seeks to break down the barriers to talking about suicide\nin order to prevent it. In its Guidelines for suicide prevention, the\nInternational Association of Suicide Prevention notes great\nvariation in quality and availability of suicide data by country\nUsing NVDRS data for suicide prevention ii31\nwww.injuryprevention.com\ngroup.bmj.com\ninjuryprevention.bmj.com\nDownloaded from\nand that results to date indicate differences in demographic\ncharacteristics and methods of suicide between countries.12\nImplemented internationally, the NVDRS initiative could be a\nvaluable tool for providing information useful for framing\neffective suicide prevention strategies within countries,\ncreating databases for international comparisons, and serving\nas a model for countries in developing data infrastructure and\nbasic surveillance strategies.\nAuthors' affiliations\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nV Powell, Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Virginia Department of\nHealth, Richmond, VA, USA\nC W Barber, National Violent Injury Statistics System, Harvard School of\nPublic Health, Boston, MA, USA\nH Hedegaard, Injury, Suicide and Violence Prevention, Colorado\nDepartment of Public Health and Environment, Denver, CO, USA\nK Hempstead, Office of Injury Surveillance and Prevention, New Jersey\nDepartment of Health and Senior Services, Trenton, NJ, USA\nD Hull-Jilly, Division of Public Health, Section of Injury Prevention and\nEMS, Alaska Department of Health and Social Services, Anchorage, AK,\nUSA\nX Shen, Injury and Violence Prevention, Oregon Department of Human\nServices, Portland, OR, USA\nG E Thorpe, Center for Preventive Health Services, Maryland Department\nof Health and Mental Hygiene, Baltimore, MD, USA\nM A Weis, Division of Injury and Violence Prevention, South Carolina\nDepartment of Health and Environmental Control, Columbia, SC, USA\nThis work was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC), National Violent Death Reporting System Grant: VA, U17/\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and\ndo not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention.\nREFERENCES\n1 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury\nPrevention and Control.
