Over half a century after its first publication in 1960,\nSoC's insights into the logic of disarmament and deterrence\nstand out as an early and brilliant example of the important--\nsometimes vital--benefits that can be gained by analyzing\nstrategy as a rational form of behavior. Highlighting the scope\nof his contribution, Schelling's work has been duly heralded\nfor its practical influence on U.S. national security doctrine\nand foreign policy in the nuclear age (Ayson, 2004; Freedman,\nit has played in the development of game theory (Crawford,\nHowever, SoC also raises significant theoretical questions\nthat have yet to be fully addressed. At a more immediate\nlevel, it seeks to determine the kind of rationality involved in\nstrategic interaction. At a more fundamental level, it asks\nwhether game theory can provide an appropriate framework\nfor dealing with problems of interdependent decision in\ndomains as applied and diverse as economics, politics, and\nmilitary warfare. Many economic readers of SoC assume\nthat these questions have been successfully answered and\nthat game theory, by formalizing many of Schelling's ideas,\nhas realized his vision for the discipline. In doing so, they\ntend to underestimate the originality of Schelling's project\nand overlook its relevance to current research. As such, the\nlessons SoC holds for game theory and for the study of stra-\ntegic decision-making deserve to be revisited.\nTwo points must be kept in mind when assessing SoC's\ncontribution. First of all, Schelling's study of strategy has a\nstrong behavioral aspect. One of its main goals is to identify\nthe actual processes that constitute strategic reasoning.\nIndeed, many of the moves and tactics typically encountered\nin the context of bargaining and conflict are difficult to\nsquare with standard assumptions about rational play and\ncannot be properly understood without a deeper investiga-\ntion. Examples include commitments, threats and promises;\nbrinkmanship; and various instances of the \"hands-tied\"\nparadox which consists in influencing outcomes by weaken-\ning one's position (reducing one's options, relinquishing ini-\ntiative, and so on). These processes also play a central role in\nSchelling's analysis of another important phenomenon:\n1Independent Researcher, France\nCorresponding Author:\nNeil Martin, Independent Researcher, 33 rue Corot 92410 Ville d'Avray,\nFrance.\nEmail: Neil.martin@sciencespo.fr\nStrategy as Mutually Contingent Choice:\nNew Behavioral Lessons from Thomas\nSchelling's The Strategy of Conflict\nNeil Martin1\n Keywords\ngame theory, strategic reasoning, interdependent decision-making, theory of mind, ecological rationality\n2 SAGE Open\nplayers' ability to coordinate decisions in a wide range of\nsettings.1\nSecond, Schelling's study of strategy has a broader theo-\nretical ambition. By integrating strategic processes and con-\ntent into game theory, Schelling hopes not only to improve\nthe discipline's practical applicability but to establish it as a\ntheory of interdependent decision that can help make sense\nof complex interactions in a wide range of domains. In this\nrespect, SoC is as much about the implications of strategy for\ngame theory as it is about the application of game theory to\nstrategy.\nTo provide a clearer assessment of SoC and of its complex\nlegacy, I address three questions successively in this article.\nWhat does Schelling's theory of interdependent decision con-\nsist in? What research program does it belong to? And what\ndoes it contribute to game theory? In the section \"Schelling's\nProject: Bringing Strategy Into Game Theory,\" I present\nSchelling's project as developed in SoC. In my view,\nSchelling's theory of interdependent decision does not simply\nrestate game theory in slightly less abstract terms, but pro-\nposes to reconstruct it in line with a more realistic understand-\ning of strategy. In \"Schelling's Research Program: An\nEcologically Rational Perspective on Strategy\" section, I show\nthat while Schelling's theory of interdependent decision draws\non psychological and contextual elements, it still refers to a\nmeaningful conception of rationality. In this respect, it can be\nrelated to Gigerenzer and Selten's \"ecological rationality\" pro-\ngram. In the section \"Schelling's Contribution: A Behavioral\nModel of Strategic Reasoning,\" I argue that SoC delivers\nresults under the form of a heuristic model of strategic reason-\ning. The final section \"Conclusion: Drawing Lessons From\nSoC\" concludes by reassessing SoC's legacy on three points:\nits relation to game theory, how Schelling's model of strategic\nreasoning compares to competing economic models, and the\npossibility of extending this model.\nSchelling's Project: Bringing Strategy\nInto Game Theory\nStrategy as a Starting Point for Game Theory\nSchelling's conception of strategy is highly original. He does\nnot think of the notion in usual game-theoretic fashion as a\nplan or rule of action that can be directly derived from the\nplayer's available information and set of feasible choices--\ngiven individual preferences and prior assumptions about\nrationality. Instead, he considers it as a mode of decision-\nmaking that relates to interactive contexts. Strategy, for\nSchelling, is not ordinary instrumental rationality as it applies\nto the pursuit of long-term goals or to competitive activities in\nthe field of battle or play. It is what becomes of rationality\n\"[when a player's best course of action] depends on the choices\nthat others will make or are making\" (Schelling, 2006, p. 3), an\nthe analysis of strategy constitutes a necessary first step toward\nunderstanding how rational individuals take decisions in \"an\nenvironment that consists of other people responding to their\nenvironment, which consists of people responding to an envi-\nSchelling's intuition is that the processes through which\nrational individuals take decisions in interactive contexts are\nspecific and need to be identified as part of the analysis. This\nintuition is supported by a number of different observations:\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Interactive contexts confront players with a well-\ndefined task. When players are interdependent, taking\ndecisions becomes less a question of determining\nwhich course of action is best for oneself and more a\nmatter of predicting what others will do. In this\nrespect, strategy draws attention to the way in which\nplayers form expectations in social settings.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Players adopt particular forms of reasoning in these\ncontexts. These forms of reasoning are distinctly stra-\ntegic. The most notable example studied in SoC is that\nof \"focusing,\" which involves predicting the behavior\nof others we are interacting with by anticipating the\nexpectations they may have of us. These forms of rea-\nsoning are also problematic from the point of view of\ngame theory, as they often rely on contextual variables\n(labels, background elements, and so on) that are not\ncaptured by the game's formal description and payoff\nstructure.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Strategic reasoning of this kind can contribute to the\nemergence of social order. SoC establishes a link\nbetween significant macro-phenomena, such as the\ninformal regulation of conflict (including nuclear\ndeterrence) or the robustness of large-scale schemes\nof voluntary cooperation, and players' ability to\njointly negotiate mutual expectations--through tacit\nas well as explicit means--and single out particular\noutcomes as a solution to common coordination\nproblems.\nThis conception of strategy provides the cornerstone for\nSchelling's project of establishing game theory as a theory of\ninterdependent decision. It unites SoC's two main parts: (a)\nits criticism of game theory and (b) its proposed reorientation\nof the discipline.\nSchelling's Criticism of Game Theory\nSchelling criticizes different aspects of game theory in\nSoC: the discipline's focus on zero-sum games; its lack of\npractical applicability in non-zero-sum contexts; and the\nlimits of its mathematical approach to strategic behavior.\nThese critical themes, some of which have been addressed\nby modern game theory, reflect a common underlying argu-\nment that remains potent, namely that game theory's tradi-\ntional methodology is ill-adapted to the interactive\ndimension of strategy.\nThe crux of Schelling's argument lies in the distinction he\nmakes between zero-sum and non-zero-sum games. In\nSchelling's view, zero-sum games constitute a special case\nand cannot be used as a starting-point for understanding stra-\ntegic behavior because of the role played by the minimax\ntheorem in these contexts. The minimax theorem provides\nplayers with a rule of action for zero-sum games (minimize\nyour potential losses) that is both optimal in terms of\nexpected utility and, more importantly, independent of what\nothers do. In this respect, what makes zero-sum games more\ntractable for game theory also limits their practical value by\ntaking the interactive element and much of the uncertainty\nout of the game.\nRational players engaged in a zero-sum game do not need\nto consider their opponents' expectations and actual choices.\nIndeed, they can factor them out of their decision-making:\nAll that really matters to them is the other's payoff function\nand the particular way in which it relates to their own.\nMoreover, players have no incentive to coordinate decisions\nand no reason to communicate. Consequently, the equilib-\nrium solution defined for zero-sum games by the minimax\ntheorem is not only unique and rational, it is one that cannot\nbe improved on by joint action. In other words, the strategy\nof zero-sum games is self-centered and interdependence has\nno influence on decision-making, at least in any positive\nsense.\nThe same conclusions no longer hold in non-zero-sum\ngames. Here, decision-making is more complex: It covers\nsituations where the best course of action can be inseparably\nlinked to what another does, where mutual expectations are\nkey to coordinating on an efficient outcome and players have\nan interest in communicating.2 By failing to sufficiently\nadjust its methodology to reflect this greater complexity,\nearly forms of game theory have bypassed the interactive\ndimension of strategy rather than addressing it.\nThe methodological differences between Schelling's\napproach and that of traditional game theory are further\nunderlined by his focal-point explanation of bargaining.\nTraditional theories of bargaining start by identifying either\nthe formal characteristics of a general solution for non-zero-\nsum games or a rational rule of action that applies to these\ncontexts. It is then assumed that rational players can recon-\nstruct the solution based on these characteristics or select the\nappropriate rule of action and, in doing so, align their expec-\ntations of each other so that they achieve the equilibrium pre-\ndicted by the theory. Schelling argues instead that solutions\nto actual bargaining problems do not seem to share any par-\nticular characteristics other than being recognized as such by\nthe players. In this view, what makes a given solution ratio-\nnal to a set of players is something simpler and more funda-\nmental: the fact that it is \"salient\" or \"uniquely prominent\"\nfor them in some commonly understood way which leads\nthem to form concordant mutual expectations of each other.\nSalience, however, is a deeply problematic property. It\ncannot easily be formalized, nor can it be attributed ex ante\nto an outcome with any certainty. Indeed, although salience\nis often attached to a discernible variable in the game's envi-\nronment, formulation, or contextual background, it does not\noverlap with any objective quality in particular. It cannot be\nassimilated to a subjective trait of the players either, though\nit can be influenced by who they are and what they know\nabout each other. Instead, the type of salience involved in\nfocal-point coordination is constructed \"on the spot\" by the\nstrategic reasoning of players as part of a common exercise\nin coordinated problem-solving.3\nThe implications of Schelling's criticism of game theory\nare most evident here. To properly understand how rational\nindividuals make choices in non-zero-sum contexts, game\ntheory must be able to analyze what their strategic reasoning\nconsists in. For Schelling, this cannot be done by purely\nmathematical means. When game theory seeks to formalize\nstrategic reasoning in mathematical terms, it sets itself at a\nlevel of abstraction that misses the \"essentials of the situation\nand of the behaviour in question\" (Schelling, 1960, p. 13). By\ndoing so, it leaves itself unable to properly grasp the nature of\nthe processes involved in interactive decision-making or the\ncontextual variables that are relevant to its outcome. What\nSchelling proposes is another option, which aims to model\nstrategic reasoning at a level of lesser abstraction. To achieve\nthis aim, he adopts a richer non-mathematical approach that\ntakes account of the environmental and behavioral aspects of\nstrategy.\nSchelling's Proposed Reorientation of Game\nTheory\nWhat shape this alternative approach might take is outlined\nin the second part of SoC (chaps. 4-6), devoted to a reorien-\ntation of game theory. It includes an attempt to reclassify\ngames and a proposal to enrich game theory along at least\ntwo axes.\nSchelling's reclassification of games builds on his distinc-\ntion between zero-sum and non-zero-sum games. It highlights\na key aspect of strategic behavior, namely that it is sensitive\nto the degree of conflict and collaboration inherent to a game,\nas measured by the commonality and divergence of interest\nbetween players.4 Commonality and divergence of interest\nare understood here as broad features of the game which\ninfluence the behavior of players at a deeper level than simple\nindividual payoffs. Most significantly, they affect the nature\nof communication between players. In this respect, what con-\nstitutes rational play varies depending on whether the essence\nof the game consists in revealing one's intentions to a partner\n(pure collaboration), concealing one's intentions from a rival\n(pure conflict), or selectively communicating them to some-\none who is both a partner and a rival (mixed motives).\nThis reclassification clarifies the sense in which non-\nzero-sum games are more complex than zero-sum ones.\nCommunication and enforcement play a crucial role in\ninteractive contexts that they do not have otherwise. In\n4 SAGE Open\nbargaining games, communication has a tactical as well as\nan informational significance. Players not only need to\nfind ways to communicate with others, they must also\nensure that their communication is credible. Pure collabo-\nration presents an analytically useful limiting case for non-\nzero-sum play where the bargaining element is absent. In\nthis simplified case, the players still need to coordinate\ndecisions around a common interest and the only feature of\nrelevance to them in the game's structure is the communi-\ncation system. In the zero-sum game by contrast, there is\nno scope for communication between rational players and\nno need for enforcement. In theory therefore, communica-\ntion and enforcement systems are not part of the structure\nof zero-sum games and can be abstracted away from their\nanalysis without loss.\nSchelling's proposals for enriching game theory introduce\ntwo additional components designed to help it match the\ncomplexity of strategic behavior in non-zero-sum games. A\ntheory of interdependent decision must thus include, first of\nall, a perceptual axis which addresses the way in which play-\ners identify each other's intentions, what resources they rely\non to do so, and what expectations they can form on this\nbasis. A theory of interdependent decision must also include\na communicational axis, whose object is to specify the means\nof communication and enforcement that are available to\nplayers, as well as the opportunities these moves create for\ninfluencing the expectations and actions of others. This\nimplies looking beyond the easily separable \"institutional\"\nchannels provided for by the rules of the game or the design\nof the experiment. Indeed, one of SoC's main conclusions\nconsists in showing that, far from constituting \"cheap talk,\"\ntacit and informal modes of communication not only influ-\nence behavior but often underpin more overt and enforceable\nforms of communication.\nSchelling's Research Program: An\nEcologically Rational Perspective on\nStrategy\nStrategic Environments and Reasoning in SoC\nSchelling's quest for greater realism sees him introduce psy-\nchological elements and contextual variables into the frame-\nwork of game theory without renouncing the latter's reference\nto individual rationality. His theory of interdependent deci-\nsion is meant to be a theory of rational choice in contexts of\ninterdependent decision. However, it draws significant con-\nclusions about the nature of rational choice in contexts of\ninterdependent decision from the empirical study of strategy.\nThese conclusions shed light on the type of rationality\nSchelling is referring to and on the research program his\nproject belongs to.5\nMost importantly, Schelling takes the cognitive limitations\nof players as an integral part of the analysis of strategy. The\ncoordination problems players encounter in contexts of\ninterdependent decision place heavy demands on them as\nstrategic choices often have to be made in real-time, with lim-\nited information and scope for learning. Yet, the experimental\nevidence also confirms that players routinely overcome coor-\ndination problems of this kind in a wide range of settings, and\nthat the outcomes they achieve can be surprisingly efficient\nand robust. The challenge for Schelling consists in explaining\nhow players whose cognitive abilities are finite manage to\nsolve such problems without the help of complex calcula-\ntions, high levels of foresight, and exacting standards of\nmutual knowledge. In other words, how players coordinate\ndecisions using processes that are psychologically realistic,\ncomputationally fast, and informationally frugal.\nSchelling's non-mathematical approach to strategy is suf-\nficiently flexible to address this challenge. It does so by com-\nbining two lines of inquiry: (a) into the actual abilities of\nplayers and (b) into the nature of strategic environments. The\nresult is an ecologically rational perspective on strategy.6\nEcologically rational models explain behavior based on two\nsets of factors: \"[the heuristic processes through which] a\njudgment or decision is reached [and] the class of environ-\nments in which these heuristics will succeed or fail\"\n(Gigerenzer & Selten, 2001, p. 4). What sets ecological ratio-\nnality apart from other versions of bounded rationality is its\nevolutionary perspective and strong emphasis on the adap-\ntive aspects of human behavior. Ecological rationality bets\non the capacity of rational individuals to simplify their deci-\nsion-making process by using contextual resources when\nfaced with complex tasks, rather than counting on pure cog-\nnitive ability and sophisticated reasoning. The effectiveness\nof these ecologically rational modes of behavior derives\nfrom a match between the structure of the heuristics indi-\nviduals apply to a given task and the structure of the environ-\nments in which they have to perform this task.\nSchelling draws on both sets of factors in SoC. First of all,\nhe redefines strategic reasoning on more detailed procedural\ngrounds. His analysis of strategy brings two basic mental\nfaculties into the picture: mutual perception and pattern rec-\nognition. Pattern recognition is a simple and well-established\nphenomenon which reflects the ability to discover and infer\npredictable regularities in one's environment and in the\nbehavior of others. It falls under the perceptual component of\nSchelling's theory of interdependent decision and is not\nproblematic. SoC provides further evidence of players' pro-\npensity to use pattern recognition as a basis for reasoning in\nstrategic settings.7\nMutual perception plays an even more important role in\nSchelling's understanding of strategic reasoning. It consists\nin a type of joint awareness through which players are able to\nrecognize the relevance of particular variables to a common\ncoordination problem, attribute the same recognition to oth-\ners, and adjust their sense of what is relevant in light of the\ninferences they can make about these others. This \"joint\nawareness\" underpins the construction of salience and the\nprofoundly interactive modes of reasoning that constitute\nstrategic behavior in non-zero-sum games. When successful,\nit allows players to form mutually consistent expectations of\neach other and take decisions as if they were acting accord-\ning to a concerted plan.8\nMutual perception is more difficult to analyze than pat-\ntern recognition and its implications for game theory are less\nstraightforward. Schelling views it as an intuitive faculty that\nis undemanding in informational and cognitive terms, and\nwhose reliability can be demonstrated under experimental\nconditions. In this respect, he considers that rational players\nhave, within their perceptual apparatus, a mind-reading abil-\nity which endows them with the \"capacity to determine intro-\nspectively the choices that a partner would make.\"9\nConsequently, SoC's account of strategic reasoning intro-\nduces into game theory something like a theory of mind\nmechanism to explain how players predict the behavior of\nothers and form mutual expectations.10\nSecond, Schelling pays greater attention to the nature of\nthe contexts within which strategic reasoning takes place.\nGame theory usually defines a strategic environment as \"any\nsituation in which individuals are affected by each other's\nfurther distinction between two senses in which decisions\ncan be interdependent. The first \"strict\" sense of interdepen-\ndence requires that players be bound by a relation of mutual\ncontingency--in which case they need to know what choices\nothers are making to take their own decisions. The second\n\"wide\" sense implies only that individual decisions involve\nexternalities--meaning that players simply care about the\nchoices others make without these choices being essential to\ntheir course of action.\nThis distinction becomes explicit in Schelling (2006, pp.\nis often overlooked, yet I would argue that it is fundamental\nto Schelling's theory of interdependent decision since SoC\nbuilds on the assumption that strategic behavior can be\nrelated to contexts of strict interdependence. Indeed, mutual\ncontingency features as a condition for effective coordina-\ntion.11 It also enters into the definition of key concepts such\nas \"games of strategy,\" \"theory of strategy,\" strategic behav-\nior and moves, and is what gives the notion of deterrence and\nthe game of pure collaboration their strategic dimension\ncan be concluded that Schelling identifies strategic environ-\nments with a special class of games. These games are referred\nto simply as \"games of strategy,\" but they can more appropri-\nately be described as \"games of mutual contingency.\"\nGames of Mutual Contingency and Their\nCharacteristics\nGames of mutual contingency provide an abstract represen-\ntation of the complex social environments which give rise to\ninteractive decision-making. As such, they allow us to char-\nacterize strategic environments in terms that are tractable for\ngame theory. These games do not capture the material con-\ntent and contextual resources that are essential to rational\nplay in real strategic environments, but valuable lessons\nabout the logic of strategic reasoning can be drawn from the\nstudy of their general structure.\nGames of mutual contingency form a broad class which\ncuts across coordination, bargaining, and conflict. What\nthese games have in common is the fact that the \"need to\nknow\" condition is written into their payoff structure. A\ngame of mutual contingency is a game in which payoffs are\nconfigured in such a way that they exclude dominant indi-\nvidual strategies. Schelling studies a number of these games\nin SoC, including such typical cases as the Rendez-Vous\ngame, the Assurance game, the game of Chicken, and the\nMatching Pennies game.12\nThe lack of individually dominant strategies presents\nplayers with a problem, as can easily be verified from\nFigure 1. The game either lacks an equilibrium in pure\nstrategies--in which case players cannot solve it without\nusing more sophisticated mixed strategies,13 or it has mul-\ntiple equilibria, in which case players must find a way to\ncorrelate their choices. This immediate problem (defining\nor selecting an equilibrium without dominant strategies) is\nfurther compounded by the fact that players are interdepen-\ndent not only in terms of the decisions they take (the best\ncourse of action for each player depends on the choice she\nexpects another to make), but also in terms of the expecta-\ntions they can form about each other (what choice a player\ncan expect another to make depends on what that other\nexpects the player's course of action to be, knowing that the\nplayer is in a similar situation to start with). In this respect,\ninterdependence of expectations represents the main and\nirreducible feature of mutually contingent choice. Game\ntheory has found it particularly difficult to define rational\nbehavior under these conditions, because it cannot explain\nhow players form mutual expectations and reach a determi-\nnate outcome without specifying a common principle of\nchoice for them--through rational deduction or by social\nGames of mutual contingency are highly indeterminate\nfrom a formal point of view. At a more practical level, how-\never, they have other characteristics that can be more readily\nexploited by players. Most importantly, they are situations in\nwhich players find themselves unable to compare alternative\ncourses of action because interdependence of expectations\nprevents them from mapping their choices to outcomes with\nany degree of certainty. Out of the numerous options avail-\nable, what action to play is not a question of frequency or\nprobability, but of what the other will do and what that other\nwill expect us to do. In this respect, games of mutual contin-\ngency are situations in which predictors for the behavior of\nothers constitute the main--in some cases sole--reasons to\nact and players need to identify cues to take decisions. As a\nresult, the nature of the decision-process itself changes in\nsituations of mutually contingent choice.\n6 SAGE Open\nEqually significant, non-zero-sum games of mutual con-\ntingency are situations in which players can benefit from\nmaking their intentions or expectations known to those they\nare interacting with. These are \"desperately cooperative\nFigure 1. Examples of games of mutual contingency in The Strategy of Conflict.\nsituations,\" to borrow Schelling's expression, in which action\nis de facto endowed with a signaling value. Individual action\nof any sort, insofar as it provides information about a play-\ner's intentions or expectations, also provides other players\nwith a reason to act. The rationale for strategic moves can be\nfound here: They are cues for the action of others and means\nof leading them to make particular choices by playing on the\nexpectations they have of us.\nSchelling's Contribution: A Behavioral\nModel of Strategic Reasoning\nThe Foundations of Schelling's Model\nSchelling's core aim throughout SoC is to model strategic rea-\nsoning as part of a wider effort to make sense of interactive\nbehavior. By adopting an ecologically rational perspective, he is\nable to establish the psychological and environmental founda-\ntions on which such a model can be built. This model allows us\nto reconstruct strategic reasoning as a simple heuristic process\nwhich governs the way in which players search for information\nand take decisions in contexts of mutually contingent choice. It\nposits that players are capable of mutual perception--implying\nthe existence of a theory of mind mechanism--and that they are\nrational in the limited sense that they exploit the underlying\ncharacteristics of their environment to achieve their goals. In\nthis respect, SoC successfully accomplishes Schelling's project\nand uses the analysis of strategy as a basis for developing a more\nrealistic behavioral form of game theory.\nThe first element in this model derives from the fact that\nthe structure of information is specific in contexts of mutually\ncontingent choice. Indeed, mutual contingency defines the\ntype of information that players can search for. In strategic\nenvironments, search concerns cues rather than alternatives.\nPlayers cannot simply compare payoffs when deciding\nbetween given courses of action; they must also determine\nadequate reasons for their choices. Their main task does not\nconsist in exploring or expanding their opportunity set in\nsearch of an optimal outcome for themselves, but in finding a\nset of predictors associated with the different courses of\naction available to them and to those they are interacting with.\nTo do so, players must either\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 obtain cues from their environment that will enable\nthem to form expectations about the choices others are\nmaking or will make.15\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 or, provide cues that will enable others to predict the\nchoices that the player is making or will make, through\nthe use of strategic moves.\nThe search for cues does not take place at random, as\nmutual contingency also helps define what constitutes a\n\"valid\" cue. For players who need to coordinate their choices\nto reach a particular outcome, a valid cue is one that gives at\nleast one of them a reason to act and can be recognized as\nsuch by both, allowing them to form concordant expectations\nof each other. In other words, it must be a common signal\nthat both players can perceive as relevant to the coordination\nproblem they face. Environmental cues can therefore be\nmeasured along a single dimension, that of salience. Players\nwho are capable of mutual perception can identify this\ndimension and use it to guide their search for cues.16\nSimilarly, to constitute a valid cue, a strategic move must\nact as a credible signal. That is, it must convey the player's\nintentions or expectations in a way that can be recognized by\nthe other and affect his expectations of the player's own\nbehavior--either by fostering an expectation or by dislodg-\ning an existing one. It should be noted that mutual contin-\ngency only defines the form of cues (commonality and\nsalience for environmental cues; credibility for strategic\nmoves), not their content. What is salient and what is credi-\nble depends on the players as well as on the situation and can\nvary from case to case. Whether the players succeed in coor-\ndinating on a common cue or not, and what that cue consists\nin, remain inherently empirical questions for Schelling.\nIn a second crucial foundation for this model, SoC offers\npsychologically plausible bases for understanding how\nboundedly rational players can limit their search, select cues,\nand take decisions. Mutual perception also plays an impor-\ntant role here. The ability to attribute perceptions of salience\nto others, to form beliefs about the way in which their expec-\ntations are influenced by the common environment and\nupdated in the course of interaction, provides players with a\nsimple and natural stopping rule that limits the search pro-\ncess. In contexts of mutually contingent choice, this search\nprocess is conducted by both players and ends as soon as\nthey perceive themselves to be acting on the same cue--that\nis, as soon as they identify a cue salient enough to focus the\nmutual expectations they have of each other.\nThe existence of cues also dispenses with the need for\ncomplex decision rules. By allowing players to form\ndefined expectations of each other's behavior, environmen-\ntal cues, coordinated problem-solving, and strategic moves\nreduce the indeterminacy of games of mutual contingency\nand make \"solutions\" more easily identifiable. In bargain-\ning for instance, strategic moves can narrow the choice\nbetween a potentially unlimited set of options down to a\nsingle binary decision: take it or leave it. Two cases apply\nhere. Players must either solve the simple maximization\nproblem that others have posed them or that they have con-\nstructed together. Or else, if possible, they can engage in\nfurther strategic maneuvering to change the outcome to\ntheir potential benefit. This can be done by providing\nanother cue to those they are interacting with or by neutral-\nizing an existing cue.\nStrategy as Heuristics of Mutually Contingent\nChoice\nTaking the above into account, I argue that strategic reason-\ning, as presented in SoC, can be modeled in the following\nway:\n8 SAGE Open\nIn the model presented in Figure 2, strategic reasoning\ncombines three types of rules to produce applied heuristics\nfor mutually contingent choice17:\n1. A simple search rule that is adapted to the specific\nstructure of strategic environments.\n2. A simple stopping rule that can be referred to as take\nthe most salient. In contexts of mutually contingent\nchoice, the object is not to determine which cue is\nmost salient from the player's own point of view, but\nwhich one is most likely to be jointly recognized as\nsuch. Mutual perception allows players to adjust their\nsense of what is salient, by placing themselves in the\nother's position. The take the most salient rule is per-\nfectly tailored to the type of fast and frugal decision-\nmaking that is often required in strategic interaction.\nIt is sensitive to the constraints under which a player\noperates (in terms of time, energy, and material\nresources) when stopping the search for information.\nIn this respect, salience can function as an \"aspiration\nlevel\" for partial or interrupted search (stop search as\nsoon as a suitably striking cue is found) or as a crite-\nrion for assessment in a full search (assess all avail-\nable cues and select the most salient).\n3. Simple decision rules which imply only that players\nact on the strongest cue and choose their preferred\noutcome given the other's predicted behavior. No\nmore than they need complete information to take a\ndecision, players do not make complex calculations of\nutility or probability in this model. The model simply\nrequires that they be able to compare outcomes in a\nway that allows them to solve reduced maximization\nproblems (what course of action is better if the others\nact in a given way?). Furthermore, where moves are\ncostly as is generally the case in bargaining, players\nmust be able to compare costs in such a way that they\ncan make broad estimates about the efficiency of a\nstrategic move (How likely is a threat or promise to be\nbelieved? Is the move worth making to obtain a par-\nticular outcome?).\nSchelling's theory implies that the status of cues will likely\nbe influenced by the nature of interaction and that the expec-\ntations players form about each other's reactions and modes\nof thinking will vary between contexts of Collaboration,\nBargaining, and Conflict. Similarly, the availability, cost,\nand effectiveness of moves will depend on the particular\ncharacteristics of the communication and enforcement sys-\ntems. The theory leads to one general conclusion however,\nwhich the present model seeks to highlight, namely that stra-\ntegic reasoning has a common basic structure which reflects\na logic of mutually contingent choice.\nConclusion: Drawing Lessons From\nSchelling's attempt to engage strategic behavior more directly\nin SoC has presented game theory with something of a\ndilemma. On one hand, the depth and influence of Schelling's\nanalysis have helped establish the practical value of game\ntheory and open up a wide range of real-world applications.\nOn the other, much of the theoretical underpinning for this\nanalysis, including Schelling's investigation of the actual pro-\ncesses involved in strategic reasoning, is still considered\nFigure 2. A schematic model of the reasoning process for mutually contingent choice.\nproblematic and remains at the margins of the discipline.\nConflicting interpretations of SoC in the literature, between\nthose who claim Schelling as a user and inspiration for game\ntheory and those who view him instead as a critic or as a pro-\nducer of game theory, illustrate this continued ambivalence.\nThe present article revisits this debate by paying closer atten-\ntion to Schelling's theory of interdependent decision. It argues\nthat SoC develops a coherent and innovative behavioral basis\nfor analyzing strategy, which is more properly understood in\nconnection with the bounded rationality program as put for-\nward by Gigerenzer and Selten (2001). Read in this light, SoC\ncan be shown to anticipate on notions such as ecological\nrationality, fast-and-frugal heuristics, and theory of mind by\nseveral decades.\nThis connection is important to make for several reasons.\nHistorical first of all, as it allows us to situate Schelling's\ncontribution in response to the debate mentioned above. In\nthis perspective, Schelling should be seen neither simply as\nan applied user nor as an outside critic, but truly as a pro-\nducer of game theory--albeit one who belongs to a branch of\nthe discipline that is experimental in method and behavioral\nin outlook.18 Conceptual also, as the reference to ecological\nrationality and fast-and-frugal heuristics allows us to clarify\nsome of the key aspects of Schelling's theory. The former\nnotably underlines the essential link which Schelling makes\nin SoC between the process of strategic reasoning and the\nparticular information structure of interactive social environ-\nments. While the latter can help us organize the various non-\nstandard elements (salience, focusing, mutual perception)\nintroduced by Schelling's analysis into a defined and realis-\ntic model of strategic reasoning.\nInteresting as these considerations may be in terms of\nhow we read Schelling and assess his contribution, the most\nimportant lessons to be drawn from SoC concern its implica-\ntions for experimental research. Schelling's theory of inter-\ndependent decision, as modeled here, makes a number of\npredictions regarding strategic behavior and interaction\nwhich can be used to highlight avenues for research and out-\nline areas in which Schelling's project could be taken up by\nthe ecological rationality program.\n1. Schelling's theory of interdependent decision is built\naround the assumption that strategic reasoning can be\nmodeled by heuristics that reflect a logic of mutually\ncontingent choice.\nThe heuristic nature of strategic reasoning is well estab-\nlished experimentally. Evidence of players' ability to solve\ncomplex coordination problems with limited information\nand time can be found going back to SoC and has been con-\nfirmed by subsequent studies, including Mehta, Starmer, and\nSugden (1994). SoC adds to our understanding of strategic\nreasoning by connecting it to the information structure of\ninteractive environments and by defining mutual contin-\ngency as its basic logic. Both of these dimensions offer\nopportunities for research, regarding the way in which play-\ners treat information and cues in different contexts or the way\nin which changes in conditions relating to mutual contin-\ngency affect strategic reasoning.19\nFurthermore, Schelling's model maps the decision-mak-\ning process for a wide class of games that cover several reg-\nisters of interaction (coordination, bargaining, conflict) and\ntranslate into different modes of strategic behavior. In this\nrespect, it does not necessarily compete with other existing\nmodels which operate within more restricted contexts but\ncan potentially integrate them into a broader framework.\nSchelling's model might notably accommodate cognitive\nhierarchy models (Camerer, Ho, & Chong, 2004), which are\nused to explain behavior in p-beauty games, under the cate-\ngory of conflict game theory and team-reasoning models\n(Bacharach, 1999; Bardsley, Mehta, Starmer, & Sugden,\n2010), which apply to coordination games, as an example of\nstrategy in collaborative contexts.\n2. Schelling's model predicts that perceptual and com-\nmunicational elements should influence strategic\nreasoning.\nSchelling's proposal to include more applied questions of\nperception and communication within the framework of\ngame theory has interesting consequences which deserve to\nbe explored more thoroughly. It implies first of all a recogni-\ntion of the highly context-dependent nature of ecologically\nrational heuristics. Insofar as these elements have an infor-\nmational or signaling value which players can use to inter-\npret the nature of interaction, they can contribute to trigger\nstrategic reasoning (does the choice-situation involve mutual\ncontingency?) and determine which mode of mutually con-\ntingent choice applies (is the logic of play dominated by con-\nflict, collaboration, or a mix of both?). Experimental\nevidence showing that both perception and communication\ninfluence strategic behavior and outcomes can therefore be\ntied in to Schelling's model.20 In this respect, it can also\nengage with another important aspect of the ecological ratio-\nnality program--the role of non-cognitive factors such as\nframes and emotions in decision-making--while suggesting\nnew research questions to investigate--such as the extent to\nwhich the trustworthiness of communication can act as an\nindicator of others' intentions and a basis for inferring the\nnature of interaction.\n3. Perceptual and communicational elements can con-\ntribute to social order by extending the logic of mutual\ncontingency beyond the original class of games\ndefined as strategic environments in SoC.\nAnother central assumption of Schelling's model is its\nidentification of strategic environments with games of\nmutual contingency. In this respect, SoC's conclusions could\nbe summarized as follows: When players need to know what\nchoices others are making or will make in order to take their\nown decisions, they adopt a specific mode of reasoning\nwhich enables them to overcome the coordination problems\nthat arise in interactive social settings. Interestingly, Schelling\nproceeds to extend these conclusions beyond the two-player\ngames of mutual contingency defined in SoC as \"games of\nstrategy\" and on to situations that are marked by wide--\nrather than strict--interdependence:\n\u00b7\nhow signaling can help players achieve cooperation in\na two-player Prisoner's Dilemma. Here, mutually\ncontingent choice is not a natural feature of the game\nbut can be imposed on it through the use of strategic\nmoves which modify the payoff structure.\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 A second extension of the model consists in using\nmutually contingent choice to explain how coopera-\ntion emerges in an n-player version of the Prisoner's\nDilemma. This second case is more complex. With a\nlarge number of players involved, the problem of\nindividual choice with externalities takes on an added\ndimension which gives it the characteristic aspect of\na social dilemma. Players have no immediate basis\nfor strategic reasoning (the n-player Prisoner's\nDilemma is not a game of mutual contingency).\nMoreover, they cannot alter the structure of the game\nwith strategic moves (as in the two-player version of\nthe game) because they only interact through a com-\nmon aggregate that none of them can influence sin-\ngle-handedly. Yet even here, Schelling argues that\nplayers engage in coordinated problem-solving and\ncollective forms of bargaining that can give rise to\n\"social contracts.\"21\nThese extensions of Schelling's model imply that the link\nbetween strategic environments and games of mutual contin-\ngency is an analytical rather than a practical one. What\ndefines a strategic environment is the use of mutually contin-\ngent choice as a logic of play, not simply the game's payoff\nstructure. This logic of play can be sustained by communica-\ntional elements (such as strategic moves), as well as by social\nobjects such as norms or conventions insofar as they trans-\nform the way in which players perceive the nature of interac-\ntion. In this respect, as Schelling himself suspected, strategic\nmodes of reasoning and the heuristics of mutually contingent\nchoice which they rely on may have an important part in the\nemergence of cooperation and social order.\n"
