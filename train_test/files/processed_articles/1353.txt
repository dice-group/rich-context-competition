The association of prevalent diabetic retinopathy with serum\nascorbic acid and -tocopherol was studied among participants with type 2 diabetes (40 years) (n = 998) in the\nretinopathy. The overall odds ratio for retinopathy among participants in quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 for\nserum ascorbic acid was 1.3 (95% confidence interval: 0.8, 2.3), with a p for trend = 0.60 after adjustment for the\nconfounders of smoking, race, waist/hip ratio, hypertension, and duration of diabetes. The overall odds ratio for\nretinopathy among participants in quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 for serum -tocopherol was 2.7 (95%\nconfidence interval: 1.6, 4.6), with a p for trend = 0.14 after adjustment for confounders. After removal of\nsupplement users of vitamin C (n = 307) or vitamin E (n = 298), the odds ratio changed direction or was\nattenuated: adjusted odds ratios for retinopathy among participants in quartile 4 compared with quartile 1 for\n0.9, 2.9), respectively. In summary, no significant associations were observed between serum levels of major\ndietary antioxidants and retinopathy. Recent use of supplements for treatment of complications of diabetes may\nexplain the direct associations.\nascorbic acid; diabetic retinopathy; nutrition surveys; vitamin E\nAbbreviation: NHANES III,  .\nPersons with diabetes suffer from micro- and macrovas-\ncular disease such as diabetic retinopathy, a disease of the\nretinal microvasculature. Retinopathy occurs in just over 2.5\npercent of the population aged 18 years or more (1).\nAscorbic acid and -tocopherol are nutrients hypothesized\nto prevent retinopathy by affecting presumed pathogenic\nfactors: protein glycosylation, insulin sensitivity, retinal\nblood flow, and oxidative stress (2\u00ad24). Not all studies,\nhowever, support these hypotheses (25\u00ad30). The majority of\nresearch investigating the potential protective effect of\nascorbic acid and -tocopherol has been conducted in\ndiabetic animal models and short-term supplementation\ntrials. Only one population-based study has investigated the\nrelation between the risk of severity of diabetic retinopathy\nand these antioxidant nutrients, using dietary intake from\none 24-hour recall (31). This previous study showed an\nincreased risk of diabetic retinopathy with increasing intake\nof vitamins C and E (31). Additional research is needed to\nassess the association between these micronutrients and\nretinopathy in the general population of persons with\ndiabetes.\nThe Third National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES III) provides the opportunity to investi-\ngate the association between biomarkers of ascorbic acid and\n-tocopherol intakes and the odds of prevalent diabetic\nretinopathy in a large sample of free-living persons (32). The\npurpose of this research was to investigate the association\nbetween serum ascorbic acid and -tocopherol concentra-\ntions and prevalent retinopathy using data from NHANES\nIII. We hypothesized that participants in the highest,\nReprint requests to Dr. Julie A. Mares, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 610 North Walnut\ncompared with the lowest, quartile of serum ascorbic acid\nand -tocopherol would have less retinopathy.\nStudy design\nNHANES III was conducted by the Centers for Disease\nnationally representative probability sample of the US\nnoninstitutionalized civilian population. A multistage proba-\nbility sample design was used with oversampling of certain\nsubgroups to allow more precise estimates, including non-\nHispanic Blacks, Mexican Americans, and adults over 60\nyears of age. All eligible participants were invited to\ncomplete a household interview to obtain information on\ndemographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health\nhistory, and dietary behavior. All interviewed persons were\ninvited to participate in a medical examination that was\nconducted at a mobile examination center. The examination\nincluded body measurements, fundus photography, urine\ncollection, a 24-hour dietary recall interview, and phle-\nbotomy to measure a number of hematologic factors.\nSample selection\nPersons with type 2 diabetes were identified from a total of\nmore years who were eligible for the survey, 11,448 persons\nwere interviewed and 9,737 were examined in the mobile\nexamination center. These analyses were restricted to non-\nHispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Mexican Amer-\nicans. Persons of other races or ethnicities were excluded (n =\n371), because the sample sizes were too small to allow statis-\ntically reliable estimates.\nA total of 1,434 persons were classified as having type 2\ndiabetes. Participants who reported being diagnosed with\ndiabetes by their physician and who recalled being diag-\nnosed at age 30 or more years were considered to have type\nhours, completed an oral glucose tolerance test, and had a\nplasma glucose level equal to or greater than 200 mg/dl, he/\nshe was also considered to have type 2 diabetes (n = 297)\nPersons with missing or ungradable fundus photographs\nfor retinopathy were excluded (n = 256). Persons were also\nexcluded if they had missing serum ascorbic acid or -toco-\npherol values (n = 75), missing food frequency data (n = 1),\nor missing data for potential confounders or other significant\ncovariates (n = 104). Thus, a total of 998 participants with\ntype 2 diabetes were eligible for inclusion in these analyses,\nand 20 percent (n = 199) had retinopathy. Overall, the\nsample used in these analyses was 70 percent of all non-\nHispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, or Mexican-American\npersons 40 years of age or more classified with type 2\nTo understand the differences between the sample we\nselected for our study (n = 998) and those persons who were\nexcluded (n = 436) from the original sample of non-Hispanic\nWhite, non-Hispanic Black, and Mexican-American persons\nwith type 2 diabetes for missing data, we compared the\ndemographic, physical, lifestyle, dietary, and medical char-\nacteristics of these two samples. The persons with type 2\ndiabetes who were excluded from this study were older (65\nican and non-Hispanic Black than non-Hispanic White\n(Mexican American: 6.3 percent vs. 5.2 percent; non-\nwere less likely to be anemic (hemoglobin of <15 g/dl: 93\nhave had higher plasma cholesterol concentrations (6.0 vs.\nrespect to sex, glycosylated hemoglobin, body mass index,\ndietary intake, hypertension, smoking, prevalent retinop-\nathy, cardiovascular disease, or supplement use.\nSerum data\nSerum samples were analyzed for -tocopherol and\nascorbic acid levels using reversed phase high-performance\nliquid chromatography with multiwavelength detection at\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey labo-\nratory located at the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\ntion. Detailed descriptions of laboratory analyses are\ndescribed elsewhere (34).\nSerum -tocopherol values were log transformed because\nof the skewness of the data. Because -tocopherol levels are\ndirectly associated with serum cholesterol levels (35)\n(Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.33), log-transformed\nserum -tocopherol values were regressed on serum choles-\nterol to compute residuals. The residuals were used in anal-\nyses to remove the effect of interindividual lipid level\nvariation on serum -tocopherol measurements.\nDietary and supplement data\nThe dietary and supplement data collected included a 24-\nhour recall, query for supplement use including questions\nregarding dose and duration, and a 60-item food frequency\nquestionnaire (36). The food frequency questionnaire was\ndesigned to estimate dietary intake over a 1-month period of\ntime prior to the interview (36). The nutrient composition\ndatabases used to create the nutrient estimates were devel-\noped using foods reported in the NHANES III 24-hour\nrecalls as described previously (37).\nThe food frequency questionnaire was not quantitative or\ncomprehensive for energy-yielding foods. Additionally, the\nfood frequency questionnaire data could not be used to\nadequately represent the intake of dietary vitamin E, of\nwhich -tocopherol is one isomer, because the food\nfrequency questionnaire queried for intakes of fats and oils\nbut did not differentiate between animal and vegetable fats.\nOnly vegetable fats are rich sources of vitamin E. Addition-\nally, the use of added fats and oils in cooking, a large source\nof vitamin E in the diet, was not assessed in the NHANES III\nfood frequency questionnaire. For these reasons, analyses of\nthe association between dietary sources of vitamins C and E\nare not presented in this paper.\nAscorbic Acid, -Tocopherol, and Diabetic Retinopathy 227\nFundus photography and grading\nRetinopathy was assessed by nonmydriatic fundus photo-\ngraphs of one randomly chosen eye for all participants aged\n40 years or more. Photographic fields were graded, in a\nmasked fashion, by trained graders at the Ocular Epidemi-\nology Grading Center, University of Wisconsin Medical\nSchool. The presence and severity of retinopathy, as well as\nthe presence of specific diabetic lesions, were classified\nusing the Modified Airlie House Classification scheme and\nthe Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study severity\nscale (38). Participants were classified as having no retinop-\nathy, mild nonproliferative retinopathy, moderate nonprolif-\nerative retinopathy, or proliferative retinopathy. The\noutcome variable was binary: any retinopathy (mild,\nmoderate, or proliferative) versus no retinopathy.\nStatistical analyses\nOdds ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals for retin-\nopathy were calculated using logistic regression for each\nquartile of serum ascorbic acid and -tocopherol, with those\nin the lowest quartile as the reference category. The Wald\ntest for trend was performed on continuous serum ascorbic\nacid or -tocopherol concentrations.\nThe variables tested as potential confounders were race,\nduration of diabetes, treatment group (a categorical variable\ndefined as dietary treatment only, oral hypoglycemic agent\nuse, or insulin use), insulin use, oral hypoglycemic agent\nuse, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, hypertension, smoking\nstatus, and hemoglobin concentrations, as a marker for\nanemia, as shown in table 1. If treatment type was deter-\nmined to be a confounder, then neither insulin use nor oral\nhypoglycemic agent use was added to the final model to\navoid the effects of multicollinearity. Potential confounders\nwere entered singly into the logistic regression model. If the\nfactor changed the beta coefficient 10 percent or more, it was\ndetermined to be a confounder. If an inverse association was\nfound between either ascorbic acid or -tocopherol, then\nglycosylated hemoglobin, a monitor of longitudinal blood\nglucose control, was added to the final model to investigate\nto what degree glycosylated hemoglobin might explain the\nprotective effect of these nutrients on retinopathy.\nThe relations of these serum nutrients to retinopathy were\nevaluated for interactions. The consistency of relations of\nserum ascorbic acid and -tocopherol to retinopathy was\nevaluated after stratification of the overall analyses by poten-\ntial effect modifiers (i.e., race, blood glucose control, dura-\ntion of diabetes, and the treatment type used to control blood\nglucose levels). Analyses were stratified by the median\ncutpoint for duration of diabetes (10 years) in this popula-\ntion. The sample was also stratified by glycosylated hemo-\nglobin levels above and below the American Diabetes\nAssociation recommended cutoffs for poor and good\nglycemic control using glycosylated hemoglobin (39). The\nlikelihood ratio test, comparing the logistic regression\nmodels with and without interaction terms, was used with an\nalpha level of 0.10 or less to determine significance.\nFurther exploratory analyses were conducted after\nremoval of supplement users. We categorized supplement\nusers of vitamin C or vitamin E to be participants who\nconsumed the nutrient in supplement form at the level of at\nleast one recommended daily allowance per week. Other-\nwise participants were considered nonusers. Serum nutrient\nlevels may reflect recent use of supplements and not long-\nterm supplement use or dietary status. Recent use of supple-\nments might also have occurred as a result of diabetes\nseverity or complications.\nTotal interview or examination sample final weights were\napplied to all estimates to account for differential probability\nof selection and for nonresponse (40). For each regression\nanalysis, the jackknife replication method was used to obtain\nappropriate variance estimates (41).\nAll analyses were conducted using SAS version 8.2 soft-\nware (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).\nRESULTS\nSerum ascorbic acid and diabetic retinopathy\nDistributions of risk factors by level of serum ascorbic\nacid. Differences in potential risk factors of retinopathy\nbetween high and low quartile ranges of serum ascorbic acid\nconcentrations are shown in table 1. Participants at the\nhighest level of serum ascorbic acid were older and more\nlikely to be female, non-Hispanic White, users of hypogly-\ncemic agents, leaner, persons with smaller waist/hip ratios,\nand less hypertensive. Participants at the highest level of\nserum ascorbic acid were also more likely to be past smokers\nand supplement users than those individuals in quartile 1.\nPersons in quartile 4 of serum ascorbic acid also had higher\nserum -tocopherol concentrations, higher intake of dietary\nvitamin C, carbohydrates, and dietary fiber, but lower\ndietary intake of total, saturated, and monounsaturated fat\ncompared with persons in quartile 1 of serum ascorbic acid.\nRelations of serum ascorbic acid to retinopathy. The odds\nof retinopathy did not differ between persons in the high\nversus the low serum ascorbic acid quartile (odds ratio = 1.4,\nconfounders did not alter this association (table 2). After\nsupplement users of vitamin C were removed from the\noverall analyses (n = 301), serum ascorbic acid was no\nlonger directly associated with retinopathy (table 2).\nAnalyses were conducted in separate strata for potential\neffect modifiers. Associations were not consistent across race\nor treatment groups. There was a borderline significant inter-\naction by race (p for interaction = 0.09) and treatment group\n(p for interaction = 0.02). For non-Hispanic Blacks and\nMexican Americans, the risk of retinopathy was lower in\nquartile 4 compared with quartile 1, but the association was\nstatistically significant only among Mexican Americans (table\n2). Additionally, the association between serum ascorbic acid\nand retinopathy was inverse, albeit not statistically significant,\namong persons who used oral hypoglycemics or insulin for\nglycemic control (table 2).\nTABLE 1.

Participants in quartile 4 for serum -tocopherol were\nmore likely be non-Hispanic White, past smokers, and\nsupplement users compared with participants in quartile 1\nfor serum -tocopherol (table 1). Participants in quartile 4\nfor serum -tocopherol were also more likely to have greater\nserum ascorbic acid, triglyceride, and cholesterol concentra-\ntions and greater intake of dietary fiber than participants in\nquartile 1 for serum -tocopherol (table 1).\nRelations of serum -tocopherol to retinopathy. The crude\noverall odds ratio for retinopathy among persons in high\nversus low serum -tocopherol quartile ranges was direct\nAdjustment for confounders did not change the direction but\nslightly increased the magnitude of this association (table 3).\nAfter removal of supplement users of vitamin E (n = 298),\nthe adjusted relation was attenuated (table 3).\nThere was a statistically significant interaction of the rela-\ntion of serum -tocopherol to retinopathy by treatment type\n(p for interaction = 0.009) and also by level of glycosylated\nhemoglobin (p for interaction = 0.003). The odds ratios were\nslightly attenuated in persons using insulin or oral hypogly-\ncemic agents to control their blood sugar (table 3). Stratifica-\ntion by glycosylated hemoglobin resulted in attenuation of\nthe odds ratio in the direction of the null in persons with poor\nglycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin, 7 percent) and\nstrengthening of the association in persons with good\nglycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin, <7 percent)\n(table 3).\nSupplements of vitamins C and E and diabetic\nretinopathy\nThe relation between the odds of prevalent retinopathy and\nduration of supplement use containing vitamin C or E was\ninvestigated (table 4). There was no relation between reti-\nnopathy and supplement use of either nutrient for a period\nfrom 1 to less than 5 years. The relation between supplement\nuse of vitamins C and E for at least 5 years was directly\nrelated to the risk of diabetic retinopathy, but it was not\nstatistically significant.\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough we hypothesized that those participants in the\nhighest, compared with the lowest, quartile of serum\nascorbic acid would have less prevalent retinopathy, we\nfound no such overall association. We may have failed to\nfind a protective effect of ascorbic acid on retinopathy\nbecause people at a higher risk for retinopathy may have\nbegun to use supplements subsequent to the development of\nretinopathy. This could have masked a potential inverse\nassociation. In support of this, the overall association was\nTABLE 2.

This may contribute to\nrandom measurement error of ascorbic acid exposure,\nreducing the ability to observe a statistically significant\nprotective relation of serum ascorbic acid. Perhaps, the\nprimary window of exposure for the development of retinop-\nathy occurs earlier then what was detected by our study's\nmeasurements. If a person had made dietary changes as a\nresult of diabetic complications prior to 1988, this would not\nhave been reflected in the single measurements of serum\nascorbic acid collected in NHANES III.

There was no association between\nserum ascorbic acid and retinopathy among non-Hispanic\nWhites, and the odds ratios for retinopathy were less than 1.0\namong non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican Americans. When\nthe NHANES III sample weights were applied to the anal-\nyses, the non-Hispanic White subgroup, which was not over-\nsampled in NHANES III, was given a greater amount of\nweight in the overall weighted analyses. This may have\nresulted in the overall direct association, although not statis-\ntically significant relation, observed between serum ascorbic\nacid and diabetic retinopathy.\nContrary to our hypothesis, we observed a direct overall\nassociation between serum -tocopherol and retinopathy.\nSimilar to the results of the serum ascorbic acid analyses, the\ndirect association found between serum -tocopherol and\nretinopathy was attenuated after exclusion of supplement\nusers of vitamin E. The recent use of vitamin E supplements\nfor treatment of complications of diabetes may have resulted\nin the positive association reported. At the same time, long-\nterm supplement use of vitamin E was directly, although not\nsignificantly, associated with retinopathy. Thus, the direct\nassociation with vitamin E may reflect the earlier presence of\ndiabetic complications or other characteristics of persons\nusing vitamin E supplements.\nThe statistically significant, direct relation between serum\n-tocopherol and retinopathy was not consistent across treat-\nment groups. This interaction was probably driven by the\ndirect relation between serum -tocopherol and retinopathy\nin the dietary treatment group, which had too few cases to\nreport a stable risk estimate. There was no statistically signif-\nicant relation between serum -tocopherol and retinopathy\nin persons who used insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.\nSome studies have found diet to be protective against\nretinopathy in only those persons with poor glycemic control\n(44) (A. E. Millen, University of Wisconsin-Madison,\nunpublished manuscript). For this reason, we stratified our\nanalyses by glycemic control. We did not observe an inverse\nassociation in those persons with poor blood glycemic\ncontrol (glycosylated hemoglobin, 7 percent), but the direct\nrelation between -tocopherol and retinopathy was attenu-\nated in this subgroup. We observed a direct association in\nthose persons with good blood glycemic control (glycosy-\nlated hemoglobin, <7 percent), but the small number of cases\nin this subgroup may have prevented us from determining a\nstable estimate of the relation of -tocopherol to retinopathy.\nTo date, this is only the second epidemiologic study inves-\ntigating the relations between diabetic retinopathy and anti-\noxidant nutrients. The San Luis Valley Diabetes Study\ninvestigated the relation between antioxidant intake and the\nrisk of severity of retinopathy among participants with type\n2 diabetes (31). Mayer-Davis et al. found a statistically\nsignificant risk for increased severity of retinopathy with\nincreasing levels of ascorbic acid intake over time and an\nincreased risk of retinopathy with increasing intake of\nvitamin E in participants not using insulin. The San Luis\nValley Study was unable to explain the observed direct asso-\nciations between antioxidant intake and retinopathy;\nhowever, they used only a 24-hour recall, which is not reflec-\ntive of long-term dietary intake. Clearly, both the present\nstudy and the San Luis Valley Study are limited by their\ncross-sectional design that can be problematic when\nanalyzing relations of conditions that develop over the long\nterm.\nOur analyses may have been biased by the exclusion of\nthose persons with missing data who were identified to have\ntype 2 diabetes. These persons were older with a longer dura-\ntion of diabetes and were therefore at a greater risk of reti-\nnopathy. Their exclusion may have diminished our ability to\ndetect an association if one exists. Additionally, our sample\nsize would have been larger if persons from the afternoon or\nevening sample of NHANES III had been more accurately\ndiagnosed with diabetes (45). Overall, this study was limited\nby statistical power (e.g., power to detect an odds ratio of\n0.60 in quartile 4 for retinopathy = 80 percent), with power\ndiminishing in stratified analyses.\nIn summary, we observed no relation between serum\nascorbic acid or -tocopherol and retinopathy in NHANES\nIII. The large body of evidence that indicates a potential for\nprotection in animal studies and short-term supplementation\ntrials is inconsistent with the sparse epidemiologic data to\ndate. Inconsistent results across population subgroups in this\nstudy, as well as insufficient statistical power to evaluate\nrelations in subgroups, indicate the need to further evaluate\nthese associations in large prospective studies.\n"
