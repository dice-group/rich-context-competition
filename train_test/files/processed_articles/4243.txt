In all, 15 patients\nwith recent-onset tinnitus took part in our manualized short-term music-therapeutic treatment. Tinnitus severity and\nindividual tinnitus distress were assessed by the German version of the tinnitus questionnaire (TQ) and the Attention and\nPerformance Self-Assessment Scale (APSA) at three different measurement times: baseline (T\n), start of treatment (T\n), and\nend of treatment (T\n). Score changes in TQ and APSA from start to end of treatment indicated significant improvements in\ntinnitus-related distress. According to the Jacobson and Truax reliable change index (RC), 73.3% of the patients showed a\nreliable reduction in individual TQ-score. The neuro-music therapy for recent-onset tinnitus according to the \"Heidelberg\nModel\" introduced in this pilot study seems to provide an effective treatment option for patients with recent-onset tinnitus.\n",

Its prevalence\nrate is estimated to be about 10% to 15% of the general popu-\nlation (Hall et al., 2011). In Germany, about three million\npeople suffer from tinnitus, and this number is rising by\nTinnitus is classified according to the duration of the\nsymptoms. The term chronic tinnitus refers to tinnitus symp-\ntoms lasting longer than 3 month. The diagnosis of acute tin-\nnitus comprises those perceptions that are persisting for a\nmaximum of 3 months.\nThe sudden appearance of tinnitus can be triggered by dif-\nferent factors. The most common causes are sudden sensori-\nneural hearing loss as well as noise-induced hearing loss,\nresulting from exposure to high-intensity sounds (acute\nacoustic trauma). Furthermore, acute tinnitus frequently\noccurs as a result of stressful and emotionally charged life\nsituations or as a side effect of medication.\nThe persisting tinnitus symptoms are often leading to sub-\nstantial distress and, as a consequence, many tinnitus patients\ndisplay other psychiatric comorbidities or psychological\nstress symptoms (Gabr, Abd El-Hay, & Badawy, 2011). For\npatients with acute tinnitus, D'Amelio et al. (2004) showed\nthat depression and strong emotional reactions experienced\nimmediately after initial manifestation of tinnitus might be\nof prognostic value concerning the level of emotional dis-\ntress and decompensation in chronic stage of tinnitus.\nTo date, there are several treatment options for patients\nwith recent-onset tinnitus. Pharmacological approaches have\nbeen established equating tinnitus with sudden sensorineural\nhearing loss (Hesse & Laubert, 2010) or with any cochlear\ndamage (Shim, Song, Choi, Lee, & Yoon, 2011). However,\nnone of these treatment modalities has yet shown repeated\nefficacy in controlled trials (Elgoyhen & Langguth, 2011).\nFurthermore, different types of psychotherapeutic interven-\ntion supporting and accompanying medical treatment have\nbeen evaluated (Gerhards & Brehmer, 2010; Schildt,\nT\u00f6nnies, & B\u00f6ttcher, 2006). These adjuvant psychotherapeu-\ntic interventions consist of one or more of the following ele-\nments: psycho-educative counseling, relaxation training, and\ngeneral as well as tinnitus-related stress management. In par-\nticular with regard to coping with tinnitus, their effectiveness\nhas been demonstrated in the above-mentioned studies.\nHowever, these psychotherapeutic interventions are mainly\n1German Center for Music Therapy Research, Heidelberg, Germany\n2University Hospital for Ear, Nose, and Throat,\nUniversity of Heidelberg, Germany\nCorresponding Author:\nMiriam Grapp, German Center for Music Therapy Research (Deutsches\nZentrum f\u00fcr Musiktherapieforschung [Viktor Dulger Institut] DZM e.V.),\nEmail: miriam.grapp@dzm-heidelberg.de\nNeuro-Music Therapy for Recent-Onset\nTinnitus: A Pilot Study\nMiriam Grapp1, Elisabeth Hutter1, Heike Argstatter1,\nPeter K.

So\nfar, the research on neural changes associated with tinnitus\nperception has focused almost exclusively on patients with\nchronic tinnitus. Electrophysiological and neuro-imaging\nstudies in patients with chronic tinnitus give increasing evi-\ndence of alterations both within the central auditory system\n(Husain et al., 2011; Lanting, de Kleine, Bartels, & van\nareas (Landgrebe et al., 2009; Lanting, de Kleine, & van\nConcerning the auditory pathway (e.g., dorsal and ventral\ncochlea nucleus, inferior colliculus) and the central auditory\nsystem, three neural mechanisms underlying tinnitus genera-\ntion have been identified (Adjamian, Sereda, & Hall, 2009;\ntaneous firing rate and hyperactivity of neurons in the audi-\ntory pathway, (b) changes in the temporal firing patterns\nresulting in an increased neural synchrony, and (c) reorgani-\nzation of the cortical tonotopic map. Thus, tinnitus-related\nbrain changes are the result of an increased neuronal plastic-\nity, a form of \"reprogramming the brain\" (Bartels, Staal, &\nIn recent neuro-imaging studies in patients with chronic\nsubjective tinnitus, the involvement of nonauditory brain\nareas is moving more and more into the scientific focus.\nThese brain areas include structures involved in attention\nand concentration such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\n(DLPFC), the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and\nthe anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; Vanneste et al., 2010;\nWunderlich et al., 2010) as well as areas of memory recollec-\ntion and consolidation, such as the hippocampus and the\nparahippocampal gyrus (Landgrebe et al., 2009; Vanneste\net al., 2010). Two highly integrative structures also seem to\nbe of importance for neural tinnitus generation: the insular\ncortex and the precuneus (van der Loo, Congedo, Vanneste,\nvan De Heyning, & De Ridder, 2011). The involvement of\nthese manifold brain structures implies the existence of neu-\nral tinnitus networks with coactivation of tinnitus areas all\nover the brain (Schlee, Hartmann, Langguth, & Weisz, 2009).\nWithin these networks special attention shall be given to the\nlimbic system, which may be responsible for the emotional\nevaluation of tinnitus sounds. The amygdala in particular is\nsuspected of mediating emotional decompensation in chronic\ntinnitus (de Ridder et al., 2006). Current research regarding\nthe role of the limbic system in the pathophysiology of tin-\nnitus emphasizes that its influence is much more extended\nthan previously proposed (Leaver et al., 2011; Rauschecker,\nHowever, studies investigating neural changes in the case\nof recent-onset tinnitus are still rare. Job et al. (2012) found\nneural hyperactivities in attention- and emotion-related areas\nespecially in the insular, the prefrontal, and the ACC in mili-\ntary adults with acute acoustic trauma and consequent tinni-\ntus. The main objective of a recent study conducted by\nVanneste, van den Heyning, and de Ridder (2011) was to\ninvestigate the differences of the neural network between tin-\nnitus of recent-onset and chronic tinnitus. Their results indi-\ncate that the neural structures detected in both acute and\nchronic tinnitus were not only identical (comprising auditory\ncortices, insula, dorsal ACC, and premotor cortex) but also\nrevealed differential activity and connectivity patterns within\nthis network.\nWithin the context of an increased understanding of neural\nmechanisms underlying tinnitus generation, the need for a\nnew therapy approach based on neuroscientific findings\nbecomes apparent, especially for patients with acute tinnitus.\nThe neuro-music therapy for recent-onset tinnitus intro-\nduced in this research paper strives for an integration of strat-\negies to manage the psychological state and possibly for a\nrestore of the underlying neurophysiological reorganization.\nComplementary music- and psychotherapeutic interven-\ntions were developed to intervene at different levels of the\nneural tinnitus network: (a) a targeted auditory training\nfocusing on tinnitus processing in the central auditory sys-\ntem, (b) techniques of auditory attention control and concen-\ntration, as well as (c) psychotherapeutic intervention\nstrategies for enhancing emotional control of tinnitus. These\ntechniques and interventions were structured into modules\nleading to a manualized short-term music-therapeutic treat-\nment concept (see \"Materials and Methods\" section for a\ndetailed description of this music therapy manual).\nPrevious studies demonstrated that in chronic subjective\ntinnitus such an integrative music therapy approach, referred\nto as the \"Heidelberg Model of Music Therapy,\" has proven\nto be an efficient means to reduce tinnitus distress and loud-\nness (Argstatter, 2009; Argstatter, Grapp, Hutter, Plinkert, &\nThe aim of this pilot study was to adapt and to evaluate\nthe neuro-music therapy approach as a new treatment option\nfor patients with recent-onset tinnitus after initial medical\ntreatment has failed.The specific interventions were expected\nto be able to intervene at an early stage in those neuronal\nprocesses leading to a chronic manifestation of the tinnitus\nsymptom. The efficacy of the therapy should initially be\nreflected in a significant reduction of subjective perceived\ntinnitus distress.\nMaterials and Methods\nPatients\nThe pilot study was conducted in accordance with the\nDeclaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics\ncommittee. To decide whether patients were eligible for our\nstudy, they underwent some initial examinations. The inclu-\nsion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1.\nGrapp et al. 3\nwith acute tinnitus (6-12 weeks) were included in our pilot\nstudy. They gave written, informed consent. Some important\ndemographic and tinnitus-related characteristics of the\nincluded patients are provided in Table 2.\nMeasures and Covariates\nPrior to music-therapeutic treatment, patients underwent a\nstandard audiological evaluation and otolaryngological\nexamination, including pure-tone audiogram, tympanometry,\notoacoustic emission, stapedius reflex tests, and vestibular\ndiagnostics. If these results were without pathological find-\nings, patients were included in this pilot study.\nTo investigate the patients' general mental state, the\nGerman version of the Symptom Check List\u00ad90\u00adRevised\ntreatment. The SCL-90-R helps to evaluate a broad range of\npsychopathological symptoms.

The\narithmetic mean of these individual scales results in a global\nseverity index (GSI).\nTinnitus severity and individual tinnitus-related distress\nwere assessed by the German version of the tinnitus ques-\ntionnaire (TQ; Goebel & Hiller, 1994) and the Attention and\nTable 1.

The questionnaire\nrecords tinnitus-related complaints on a global TQ-score as\nwell as on the five subscales: (a) emotional and cognitive\ndistress, (b) tinnitus intrusiveness, (c) auditory perception\ndifficulties, (d) sleep disturbances, and (e) somatic com-\nplaints. The range of values is between the minimum score of\n0 and the maximum score of 84, whereas high values indi-\ncate high tinnitus-related distress.\nThe APSA is a self-rating scale comprising 30 items. It\nhas been developed to measure especially attention and per-\nformance problems in tinnitus patients. The range of values\nfor this questionnaire is between the minimum score of 0 and\nthe maximum score of 120. Higher scores indicate more\nproblems with attention and performance.\nTo measure and quantify therapy success, TQ-scores as\nwell as APSA-scores obtained at three different measure-\nment times (baseline [T\n], start of treatment [T\n], and end of\ntreatment [T\n]) were compared. Statistical analysis was per-\nformed by using the program IBM SPSS Statistics 20. Due to\nthe small sample size, the comparison of means at different\nassessment times was conducted by the nonparametric\nWilcoxon Signed Ranks Test for two related samples using a\nlevel of significance of p value < .05. In addition, Cohen's d\neffect size was calculated to measure the magnitude of the\ntreatment effect.\nChanges in individual TQ-score were evaluated by the\nreliable change index (RC) according to Jacobson and Truax\n(1991). This approach allows for individual changes being\nclassified as reliable changes if they are unlikely to be due to\nsimple measurement unreliability. The RC is defined as the\nchange in a client's score (x\nprae\n\u00ad x\npost)\ndivided by the standard\nerror of the differences (S\ndiff\n) for the test being used. Thus,\nthe formula for calculating the RC is\nRC prae post\ndiff\n=\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx x\nS\n.\nS\ndiff\ncan be calculated from the standard error of measure-\nment (SE):\ndiff\n= ( )\n,\nSE can be estimated using a test's standard deviation (s\nx\n)\nand reliability (r\nxx\n):\nSE s r\nx xx\n= \u00d7 -\n( )\nIf the RC is 1.96 or greater, then the difference is statisti-\ncally significant at the .05 significance level. To compute the\nRC for the global TQ-score, standard deviation and reliabil-\nity of the TQ manual (Goebel & Hiller, 1998) were used.\nThis yields a critical difference of 6.1 in TQ raw score which\nequals a change of at least 8 percentage points.\nNeuro-Music Therapy\nAccording to the \"Heidelberg Model\"\nThe neuro-music therapy for recent-onset tinnitus is a manu-\nalized short-term music-therapeutic treatment lasting for\n10 consecutive 50-min sessions of individualized therapy.\nTherapy took place in the German Center of Music Therapy\nResearch in Heidelberg on 5 consecutive days (from Monday\nto Friday) with two therapy sessions per day. The comple-\nmentary music- and psychotherapeutic interventions were\nstructured into the following modules.\nModule 1: Psychotherapeutic Interventions\n1. Counseling: All patients received a comprehensive\npsycho-educative counseling to establish a cognitive\nmodel of tinnitus. Patients were informed about the\nunderlying neuroscientific principles of the music ther-\napy. As the specific modules used in therapy were\nbased on the patients' individual tinnitus sound, their\n\"tinnitus-equivalent\" had to be set up. For patients who\ndescribed their tinnitus as tonal, tinnitus frequency was\nmatched by a sine wave generator of the type\nGwINSTEK SFG-2104 which produced pure sinusoi-\ndal tones in Hertz. For patients with noise-like tinnitus,\nthe program \"noise estimator\" which generated noises\nof diverse bandwidth and pitch designed by \u00a9Dr.rer.\nmed. Christoph M. Krick, Neurocenter of the Saarland\nUniversity, was used to match the subjective tinnitus.\n2. Individual Consultation: After the fifth therapy ses-\nsion, a psychotherapeutic consultation took place to\nreview the course of treatment up to now. During this\nconsultation, patients could also talk about stressful\nlife situations or tinnitus-related fear for the future.\nModule 2: Resonance Training\nThe Resonance Training was intended to increase blood cir-\nculation of the entire head, especially in tinnitus-related\nbrain regions, and to innervate the auditory pathway via\nsomatosensory stimulation (Levine, Abel, & Cheng, 2003).\nThe patients learned a vocal exercise stimulating the cranio-\ncervical resonating cavities.\nTo ensure that the Resonance Training was performed\ncorrectly, the therapist palpated the nasal root, the frontal and\nparanasal sinuses, as well as so-called \"trigger points\" on the\nback (Alvarez & Rockwell, 2002).At these points, resonance\nproduces a clearly discernible vibration. During the interval\nbetween the sessions, the patients had to exercise in\nResonance Training for 3 min every hour.\nModule 3: Neuroauditive Cortex Training\nThe Neuroauditive Cortex Training used tone sequences cen-\ntered around the transposed frequency of the patients'\nGrapp et al. 5\npreviously determined \"tinnitus-equivalent.\" These tone\nsequences were performed live on a piano by the therapist\nand had to be vocally imitated by the patient. At the begin-\nning of the intervention, the sequences consisted of only two\ntones. With increasing difficulty, up to five tones were pre-\nsented. The tone sequences should be atonal and performed\nin quick succession.\nA systematic and targeted training of inaccurately into-\nnated musical sounds enabled the patients to exert influence\non their auditory processes as they learned to actively filter\nout irrelevant information and to concentrate on relevant\nacoustic stimuli. In addition to an increased auditory atten-\ntion control, this training aimed at a neuronal reorganization\nof the auditory cortex.\nModule 4: Tinnitus Reconditioning\nThe Tinnitus Reconditioning offered coping mechanisms\nrelated to stress control along with a sound-based habituation\nprocedure.\n1. Relaxation training: As it was a well-known and\neffective relaxation exercise, the music-therapeutic\nrelaxation training according to Bolay and Selle\n(1984) was adapted to the needs of the tinnitus ther-\napy. By means of music as calming background\nstimulus, the balance between the activity of the\nsympathetic and the parasympathetic branches of\nthe autonomic nervous system should be restored.\nThe attention was diverted from the tinnitus, and\nphysical relaxation was supported. In addition, the\npatients imagined a positive autobiographic episode\n(e.g., reminiscence of a holiday experience) that\nserved as anchor stimulus: the retrieval of this\n\"well-being-imagination\" should trigger bodily and\nmental relaxation.\n2. Habituation training: During the relaxation exer-\ncise, the tinnitus sound was integrated intermit-\ntently into the background music. The volume was\nadapted to the individual hearing level compensat-\ning for a potential hearing deficit. For this purpose,\nbefore the training session started, the patients had\nto set the background music to a convenient level\nsuch that they could easily listen to the music while\nstill being able to follow verbal instructions from\nthe therapist.\n3. Stress management (Tinnitus Map): Subsequently\nthe patients had to set up a \"tinnitus-map.\" This map\nidentified situations aggravating or intensifying the\ntinnitus. These aversive situations were imagined\noccasionally during the relaxation when instructed by\nthe therapist. The patients thus learned to decouple\ntinnitus and aversive associations.\nResults\nPsychological Characteristics\nof Acute Tinnitus Patients\nTo evaluate patients'general psychological distress, the SCL-\n90-R questionnaire was applied prior to treatment. To enhance\nthe informational value and comparability of the results, indi-\nvidual raw scores were transformed into standard T-scores\nbased on a German representative population sample (Hessel,\nSchumacher, Geyer, & Br\u00e4hler, 2001). The data revealed high\npsychological distress in patients with recent-onset tinnitus:\n12 out of 15 patients (80%) achieved T-values above the nor-\nmal range on the GSI-score and on three or more subscales.\nreached particularly high values.\nTherapy Outcome\nSubjective Tinnitus-Related Distress. Score changes in TQ from\nbaseline to start of treatment as well as from start to end of\ntreatment are presented in Table 3. For a better comparison\nof the single values, TQ raw scores were transformed into\ncumulative percentages based on a German representative\npopulation sample (Goebel & Hiller, 1998). The TQ-scores\nindicated a slight improvement in subjective experienced tin-\nnitus distress from T\nto T\n, even without any therapeutic\nintervention. These improvements were primarily related to\nthe subscale Sleep Disturbances.\nWhen, comparing TQ-scores at T\nwith TQ-scores at T\n,\nthere were significant improvements in global TQ-score and\nin all but one TQ subscales. The most notable changes were\nachieved in the subscales Emotional and Cognitive Distress\nand Tinnitus Intrusiveness. With the exception of Sleep\nDisturbances, Cohen's effect size values exceeded d = 0.8\nindicating large effects and a high clinical significance of the\nintervention.\nTQ-score changes on individual level were evaluated by\nthe RC. According to the formula developed by Jacobson\nand Truax, a change that exceeds 8% can be regarded as reli-\nable (see \"Materials and Methods\" section). Inspecting the\ndata, 4 of the 15 patients (26.7%) achieved a change smaller\nthan this. The lowest change was zero (for 1 patient) so there\nwere no patients with reliable deterioration and 73.3%\nshowed reliable improvement. The individual TQ-score\nchanges are displayed in Figure 1. Each point reflects the\nscores of one patient: the x-axis is the T\n(beginning of treat-\nment) score, and the y-axis is the T\n(end of treatment) score.\nThus, points lying between the two dashed diagonals show\nno reliable change and points below the lower dashed line\nshow reliable improvement.\n6 SAGE Open\nTable 3.

In addition to subjective\npsychological and physiological-tinnitus-related distress,\nalmost all patients with acute tinnitus explicitly complain of\ndeficits in attention as well as concentration difficulties.\nTherefore, the APSA was used as a complementary question-\nnaire to evaluate therapy success. A Wilcoxon signed-ranks\ntest indicated no significant APSA-score change from base-\na significant improvement in attention and performance\nDiscussion\nThe neuro-music therapy for recent-onset tinnitus according\nto the \"Heidelberg Model\" introduced in this pilot study\nseems to provide an effective treatment option for patients\nwith acute tinnitus after initial medical treatment has failed.\nBoth a significant improvement in subjective perceived tin-\nnitus distress and a reduction in tinnitus-related attention\ndeficits are evident immediately after the treatment.\nMoreover, the large effect sizes indicate a high clinical and\npractical significance of the intervention.\nThe improvements in tinnitus-related distress (measured\nvia TQ) concern the patients' not only cognitive and emo-\ntional dealing with tinnitus but also tinnitus intrusiveness\nand auditory perception difficulties. It may therefore be\ninferred that neuro-music therapy goes far beyond pure\nsymptom management. Instead, the individual treatment\nmodules are able to intervene at an early stage in those neu-\nronal processes leading to a chronic manifestation of the tin-\nnitus symptom: On one hand, a controlled intervention into\nthe neuronal mechanisms of tinnitus generation in the central\nauditory system is possible by means of \"Resonance\nTraining\" and \"Neuroauditive Cortex Training,\" and on the\nother hand, the ability of the limbic system to identify and\ninhibit irrelevant sensory signals is thought to be strength-\nened through \"Tinnitus Reconditioning.\"\nConcerning changes in TQ subscales, it must be noted\nthat there is a significant improvement on the TQ subscale\nSleep Disturbances from baseline to start of therapy, even if\nthis single subscale has to be interpreted carefully due to its\nsmall number of items. Poor sleep additionally increasing the\npsychological strain is a common accompaniment of acute\ntinnitus. The reduction of sleep disturbances prior to music\ntherapy may be explained by habituation mechanisms or by\nthe consumption of sleeping medication.\nThis pilot study continues the line of research evaluating\nthe effectiveness of the \"Heidelberg Model of Music Therapy\nfor Tinnitus.\" Previous studies by Argstatter (2009) and\nArgstatter et al. (2012) have shown that this integrative\nmusic therapy approach is an efficient means to reduce tin-\nnitus distress and loudness in patients with chronic tinnitus.\nThe data collected in this study allow for initial conclusions\nthat the \"Heidelberg Model of Music Therapy for Tinnitus\"\ncan be extended to the treatment of recent-onset tinnitus.\nApart from the successful therapy outcome, the majority\nof tinnitus patients included in our study displayed a striking\nprofile of high psychological distress. In particular, depres-\nsion and anxiety seem to be an intrinsic part of the everyday\nlife of most patients with acute tinnitus. These findings are\nconsistent with earlier studies indicating high prevalence\nrates of psychiatric comorbidity among tinnitus patients\nAsapilotstudy,oursamplesizeconsistingofonly15patients\nwas very small. Moreover, because there was no control\ngroup of patients receiving no treatment, we cannot rule out\nthat other factors apart from the music-therapeutic interven-\ntions had influenced the positive therapy outcome. To\nstrengthen our results, the neuro-music therapy approach for\nrecent-onset tinnitus will be reevaluated based on a wider\npatient sample. In addition, two control groups will be\nincluded in the study design: a waiting group and a group of\nhealthy controls.\nThis pilot study was based solely on questionnaire data\nrepresenting improvements in subjectively perceived tinni-\ntus distress. However, as the proposed music therapy concept\nfocuses on neural mechanisms underlying tinnitus genera-\ntion, a reduction in tinnitus distress should be reflected in\nstructural and functional alterations of the neural tinnitus\nnetwork.\nBased on previous studies and relating to the expected\neffects of the respective modules, we hypothesize that there\nwill be functional and anatomical changes (a) in primary\nauditory areas due to the targeted auditory training, (b) in\nbrain structures involved in attention and concentration (e.g.,\nDLPFC and VLPFC, ACC) due to the concentration training\nand the increased auditory attention control, and (c) in limbic\nareas due to increased emotional control of the tinnitus and\nits aversive associations.\nIn our forthcoming study (ClinicalTrials.gov registration:\nimaging (fMRI) will be used to test these hypotheses. We\nexpect to identify both relevant neuronal correlates of\ntinnitus-related distress in the acute phase and changes in\nneuronal activity from the start to the end of the treatment.\nAs an intrinsic noise cancellation system, the limbic sys-\ntem plays a crucial role in chronic manifestation of tinnitus.\nIf the limbic filtering function is impaired, the evaluation of\nthe tinnitus sensation's perceptual relevance is affected and\nthe gain control of the tinnitus perception is disturbed. By\ntesting this model of Rauschecker et al. (2010) using fMRI in\npatients with chronic tinnitus, Leaver et al. (2011) showed\nfunctional and anatomical anomalies in limbic and primary\nauditory areas. These anomalies were highly intercorrelated\nindicating the importance of auditory-limbic interactions in\ntinnitus. For further research, it might be of interest to con-\nfirm these results for recent-onset tinnitus, especially with\n8 SAGE Open\nregard to the question of how tinnitus develops into a chronic\ncondition.\nIn this pilot study, we reported a significant change in\ntinnitus-related distress immediately after the treatment.\nHowever, the neuro-music therapy strives not only for short-\nterm improvement but also and above all for a durable symp-\ntom reduction. To investigate the stability of the therapy\noutcomes, our future research will include systematic follow-\nup examinations of the patients 3 months after the comple-\ntion of therapy.\nAnother important aspect for future research is the com-\nparison between patients receiving Psychotherapeutic\nIntervention only, patients receiving Resonance Training\nonly, patients receiving Neuroauditive Cortex Training only,\nand patients receiving Tinnitus Reconditioning only. Thus, it\ncan be investigated to what extent the individual interven-\ntions contribute to the therapy success and if the interaction\nof the single treatment modules is of particularly significance\nfor the effectiveness of the \"Heidelberg Model of Music\nTherapy\" for recent-onset tinnitus.\nConclusion\nThe results of this pilot study show, in a small group of\npatients, the efficacy of the neuro-music therapy for recent-\nonset tinnitus according to the \"Heidelberg Model.\" To con-\nfirm and to generalize these results, this treatment approach\nwill be reevaluated based on a wider patient sample and\ncompared with both a waiting group and a group of healthy\ncontrols.\nThe neuro-music therapy is expected to intervene at an\nearly stage in those neuronal processes leading to a chronic\nmanifestation of the tinnitus symptom. Beyond a reduction\nof subjective perceived tinnitus distress, a successful therapy\noutcome should be reflected in alterations of the neural tin-\nnitus network. In our forthcoming study, task-based fMRI\nwill be used to investigate neuronal correlates of tinnitus-\nrelated distress in the acute phase and changes in neuronal\nactivity from the start to the end of the treatment.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAdjamian, P., Sereda, M., & Hall, D.
