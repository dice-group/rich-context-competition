    "abstract": "Abstract\nThis article proposes the concept of sustainable flood memory as a critical and agentic form of social and cultural\nremembering of learning to live with floods. Drawing upon research findings that use the 2007 floods in the\nSouth West of England as a case study, we explore and analyse the media representations of flooding, the role of\ncommunity and communicative memory of past floods for fostering resilience, and map emotional and affective\nresponses to floods. To approach flooding in this way is critical to understanding how communities engage in\nmemory practices (remembering and strategically forgetting) in order to cope with environmental changes.\nMoreover, the article embraces a research design and strategy in which `memory studies' is brought into a\nconversation not only with geography (mental maps), social sciences and flood risk management policy but also\nwith stakeholders and communities who collect, archive and remember flood histories in their respective regions.\n",

The materialisation of flood\nremembrance, for example, in texts, images, (social) media, landscape, shared practices, depends\nupon the social, cultural and economic conditions of a potential collective in the geographical area\nat flood risk. While the cultural memory of flooding may well be alive and attached to feelings of\nresilient community in one section of a floodplain, further down river, personal memories of past\nfloods may be hidden, forgotten or ignored. As the river moves through regions and settings, car-\nrying a mnemonic capacity to imprint landscapes as well as minds, the capacity for sustaining\nflood memory is mobile and in flux.\nWithin the media-scape, flood narratives are equally dynamic. They are recorded and rep-\nresented nationally and globally as human stories of natural disaster, that issue forth a politics\nof vulnerability and/or triumph. Memorable data as tweets also become mappable along\nfloodplains (see Graham et al., 2012). The aftermath of a flood requires a multi-stakeholder\nresponse debated in the mediated public sphere of news broadcasting and print editorials. An\nenvironmental policy around flooding is as much a media and cultural policy of remembering\nto live with water as it is hard engineering and dredging. In this article, we offer a theoreti-\ncally informed analysis of visual and interview data of remembering and forgetting practices\nof and in flood risk communities within a geographic region of the United Kingdom. This\nresearch formed part of the Sustainable Flood Memories Project (2010\u00ad2013) funded by the\nEconomic and Social Research Council (ESRC), and our focus was upon the value and func-\ntion of flood memory as a tangible and travelling discourse, form and practice within and\nacross settings.\nThe project sought to increase understanding of how flood memories provide a platform for\ndeveloping lay knowledge. The aim was to create social learning opportunities in communities for\nadaptive capacities and flood resilience. The notion of community resilience can be viewed through\na series of different lenses \u00ad institutional, infrastructural, psychological; social, economic, cultural,\nenvironmental; and coping or adaptive (see, for example, Norris et al., 2008; Steiner and\nMarkantoni, 2013). Recent catastrophic floods in the United Kingdom continue to impact adversely\non human livelihoods, highlighting both the limitations of strategies that solely rely on `expert'\nflood knowledge, and the potential value of integrating lay knowledge in flood risk management\n(FRM) (McEwen and Jones, 2012). What is often missing from knowledge exchange activities\nbetween experts and communities is the role that memory plays both on the ground and in organi-\nsational and institutional narratives.\nBackground contexts\nRecent research critically reflects upon floods and their representation. The following have\naddressed contested or competitive mediations of flooding within nations and regions during and\nHowever, the social and cultural differences between these flood events are not only a result of the\nclimatic and geographic distinctions between regions and weather systems but also the dynamic\ninheritance of social attitudes towards water embedded in place and context while travelling across\nsettings. From local modes of storytelling to national news and social media networking, floods are\niterative, itinerant and relational, offering up insights into change as well as acknowledging conti-\nnuities in local community experience.\nElsewhere, we have written in depth about our concept of `sustainable flood memory' (see\nMcEwen et al., 2012). This is conceived as an approach to memory work that is community-\nfocused, archival, integrating individual/personal and collective/community experience, involving\ninter-(vertical) and intra-(horizontal) generational communication, with concern for the future.\nSuch memory is `sustainable' in the sense that it creates and supports the conditions for its further-\nance, with strong attention to knowledge exchange and social learning, and to using associated lay\nexpertise in delivering on future resilience needs. Here, we consider flood memory as the narra-\ntives, oral and archived histories and folk memories of previous flood events and their impacts that\nare embedded in local communities' heritage and culture. Living with floods and flood risk can\nbecome a part of peoples' individual, family and community memory and identity, which makes it\ndynamic, mobile and shareable but also easily lost, neglected or silenced.\nIn the broader context of communicating water issues, Stedman (2014) has noted that the\nwater sector can be a subject of intense emotion [...]. It is such a vital sector that its activities affect people\nin a very direct and personal way, and this significant level of concern must be understood and respected\nin order to communicate well. (p. 126)\nFurthermore, as Linton (2010) states, `water [as a cultural/political issue] is everywhere' (p. x).\nThis is clearly so for flooding, as in the United Kingdom and globally there have been a series of\nsevere flood events and, in relation to climate change, flood risk looms ever larger across many\nareas previously imagined not to be at risk. `Sustainable flood memory' research is a proposed\nintervention into water communication that demonstrates how the discursive terrain of thinking\nwater has become necessarily multi-disciplinary on the one hand and stakeholder/community\nengaged on the other (see Herve-Bazin, 2014).\nInpopularwriting,floodscontinuetoofferconnectivityacrosstimeandplace\u00adasinWithington's\n(2013) Flood: Nature and Culture which converges Noah, the China floods of 1931, and the bro-\nken levees of New Orleans \u00ad offering historical repertoires of disaster (see also Kempe, 2003). This\nmay imply a collective memory of flooding. It may also assume that there is nothing working\nagainst personal remembering and resilience within and outside the flood risk area, such as the\neconomic drive to move on (`business as usual'), a resistance to collective victimhood (`our finest\nhour'), the mediation of flooding as traumatic (`we need to forget') or the flood as rare/extreme\n(`the one in one hundred year event'). The media templates of deluge, disaster or even problematic\n`cleansing' of a built environment in response to floods may even further forgetting.\nTherefore, in developing a site-specific and applied memory approach to flooding in selected\ncatchment areas along a river system in England \u00ad with differing lived experiences and relation-\nships to that river \u00ad it becomes less easy to apply a historical rupture thesis whereby cultural nar-\nratives of resilience are said to give way to narratives of vulnerability. As in Gutsch's Ohio River\n(US) research in 2011, in which a `mental mapping' methodology (see Cloke et al., 2004; Gould\napproached flood risk and resilience from the perspective of narrative. This was in terms of `con-\nnecting' extant flood materialisation and creating new narratives by bringing people together to\nshare experiences, memories and anecdotes.\nWhile we did not undertake `mental mapping to construct [a] place' (Gutsch, 2014: 105) of\nflooding that we could decode through stories, we did explore memories of flooding as always\nalready produced by and through a watery sense of place. It was from the perspective of water,\nthe river and the flood that we sought to gather, connect and construct transferable and mediated\nmemories. If places defined by rivers and floods are to be interpreted by researchers then we\nneed approaches that not only elicit stories from mapping the self in relation to place but that\nalso `story' water in relation to the self and community. Future research may wish to extend this\nidea into exploring water's memory (its chemical composition as an archive of human stories)\nand storying the river as a reflection of a social mentality at any given point in time. To start with\npersonal and community immersion in (narratives of) water (its abundance and scarcity, its\ndestruction and vitality), is a response to Furedi's call for `a more systematic engagement with\nthe historical dimension of disaster consciousness' in his analysis of flood narratives in the\nUnited Kingdom. Thus, we offer our flood memory as an opportunity to `illuminate the distinc-\ntive features of the contemporary response to adversity' (Furedi, 2007: 250) as deeply personal,\nsomatic and affective. The aim is to draw upon a wider repertoire of agentic, resistant, mnemonic\ntactics that individuals and communities may or may not inherit, remember and re-use that a\nfocus on the broader contextual historical and collective narratives of flooding may miss. These\ntactics cannot always be textually analysed by the researcher nor easily communicated by media,\nbut they are connective and mobile.\nAbout the ESRC Sustainable Flood Memories Project\nFloods in the United Kingdom continue to impact adversely on human livelihoods, highlighting\nboth the limitations of `expert' flood knowledge and the potential of lay knowledge in FRM\n(McEwen and Jones, 2012). The need to link `elite strategies to daily life' is very much at the\nheart of the political economy of disaster and risk management (see Jones and Murphy, 2009: 5).\nIn the case of catastrophic events, such as the 2007 UK Floods, the control of the elite production\nand consumption of flood knowledge provided both constraints and opportunities. The emer-\ngence of more visible, distributed flood awareness through social networks suggests that new\ntechnologies of remembering and connecting flooding are emerging. In the light of this, we\ndetermined an urgent need post-2007 to evaluate the extent to which, and in what ways, com-\nmunity flood memories contributed to local/lay flood knowledge that build resilience to chang-\ning flood risk and flood events. It was the emphasis upon flood memory that was unique to the\nway we designed and executed the research: not only through analysis of extant flood heritage\nand materialisation in the region but as produced by the participants in our research as stakehold-\ners, actors and followers of flooding.\nThe UK ESRC funded interdisciplinary research project ran from 2010 to 2013 and compara-\ntively studied four floodplain settings in the lower Severn Valley, United Kingdom, after the\nextreme 2007 floods. These floodplain groups have different histories, forms and levels of past\nflood experience, and different degrees of community development. It was their `watery sense of\nplace' post-2007 that connected the settings through their shared and increasingly mediated col-\nlective memory of extreme flood and water scarcity. However, the selection of the case study\nsettings was based upon a large and varied amount of demographic data (i.e. population size, liv-\ning arrangements, households with lowest floor level above ground, old/new build property, age,\ngender, ethnic group, household composition, qualification levels, rural/urban, employment lev-\nels, transient/permanent population, average distance from river, average distance to commute to\nwork, regularly flooded or first time). The project aimed to evaluate the extent to which communi-\nties with a history of past flood events are more resilient to future floods than communities with\nno previous flood history, or floodplain groups without any shared memories of flooding.\nSimilarly, we were also interested in the emergence of new digital technologies for recording,\nsharing and remembering flooding across settings. Below we outline the aims, methods and meth-\nodological issues of the project, before exploring emergent themes from the results and drawing\nout the important role of emotion, affect, trauma and active forgetting as constitutive features of\na sustainable flood memory.\nFlood memory work methodology\nOur `sustainable flood memory' approach was based upon a site-specific, interdisciplinary meth-\nodology of memory work, visual ethnography, archival research, oral history interviewing, and\nflood agency reflections. In what follows, we present the methodology that sought not only to\nunderstand the mechanisms by which flood memory is (or is not) sustained in the region and on the\nground but also how our project produced flood memory as an outcome. Our research of flood\nresilience through flood memory took into account long-standing personal and collective memo-\nries of flooding, the trauma or excitement during flood events, and the variety of mechanisms\nwhereby communities already create, store and re-purpose their flood knowledge. This entailed\nworking closely, carefully and ethically with communities and individuals. Some of these were still\ntraumatised by their experiences of floodwaters destroying their homes but nevertheless wished to\nshare their experiences, have these recorded and not forgotten. There was only one case in which a\nvery valuable respondent to an earlier project, who had previously created a digital story for\nYouTube on her traumatic experience of the 2007 flood, broke all contact with the project team.\nThis may have been due to `flood fatigue' (`i.e. people wanting to move on and not dwell on the\npast' (see Walker et al., 2010: 86)) as the same respondent declined to be involved in flood anni-\nversary activities. There may of course be other reasons for this withdrawal. `Flood fatigue' was a\nterm more used by the local media organisations, but was also declared to us by other respondents,\nas a form (or tactic) of forgetting.\nThe four floodplain settings comprised the following (see Census Data, Table 1):\nSetting 1. An established urban community with a significant history of episodic extreme floods,\nregular experience of flooding, and corresponding flood memories. This is a small town with a\nmixed demographic of ages and social classes, small and large housing developments, good\naccess to services, roads and employment. The topography of the town is at the confluence of two\nrivers, sandwiched between a heavily used motorway to the East and the Cambrian Mountains to\nthe West.\nSetting 2. A `newer'urban community with no previous flood history (with no widespread flood\nlatter is characterised by estates built in the 1960s, and the 2011 census indicates that it contains\na higher proportion of retirees than the town average but with lower levels of unemployment.\nThis setting is adjacent to Setting 1 and so shares the same topography.\nSetting 3. A floodplain city ward with a history of extreme flooding including recent experience\nin 2007, and with significant transient or intermittent residential patterns. This is a densely\nTable 1. Summary demographic statistics for each setting.\nAge Tenure\n Age\nAge\nAge\nAge\nTotal owner\noccupied (%)\nSocial\nrented (%)\nPrivate\nrented (%)\nTotal ethnic\nminorities (%)\npopulated area (relative to size) of a key city in the region, comprising of lower income families\nand individuals, social housing and includes a traveller settlement. It is of mixed age with some\ntransitory occupants and although ethnic diversity is not a key feature of this particular setting\n(which is located near the river), the wider city does have a longer history of immigration. This\nsetting is topographically broader and flatter, and acts as the lower floodplain of the river on its\nroute to the sea.\nSetting 4. An established rural community with a significant history of episodic extreme floods\nover many centuries. These are small groups of houses, with a higher than average age for the\narea, comprising retired professionals, farmers and settled owner-occupiers, who are all White\nand middle class. Close to a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Setting 4 presents\nas a typical Cotswold village surrounded by buildings and landscape features of historical and\ncultural interest. It is a well-preserved and tended environment with high levels of social, cul-\ntural and economic capital. The enterprising farmer at the centre of village life (only resident\nwho lived through the 1947 floods) is also a living archive of flood memories, documentation\nand past resilience strategies.\nA total of 65 residents were interviewed in-depth across the case study settings, using snowball-\ning techniques and a quota approach to sampling on the basis of gender and age (but not ethnicity).\nThe method sought to identify interviewees who would have strong memories of the 2007 floods,\nas well as past floods. These interviewees self-selected or were selected by the researchers because\nthey were keen to share their memories and watery senses of place.\nThese interviewees were typical of the settings, in so far as they represented those who were\ninterested in local flooding, had been affected by the severe 2007 flood, or had historic memories\nof flooding and community they wished to share. Of course, this did not capture every memorable\nexperience of the 2007 floods from these communities and did not mean the interviewees were\nindexical to the entire communities'memories of floods. On the one hand, the research team found\nit difficult to engage younger members of all these communities in the research (18\u00ad25 and 26\u00ad40\nage groups), which suggests an identifiable disinterest based on age, demands of employment/\nfamilies, ownership of property and settlement across the settings. On the other hand, the interest\nin flooding among our interviewees flowed across the settings (as the river does), while revealing\nsome setting-specific differences. Selecting for typicality (i.e. viewing the memories as coming\nfrom a contained cultural memory of living with/without floods), and also selecting for inter-\nchanges (i.e. recognising that water is always in transit across communities) was the balance we\nstruck. As Erll (2011) has argued, `Mnemonic constellations may look static and bounded when\nscholars select for their research, as they tend to do, manageable sections of reality (temporal,\nspatial, or social ones), but they become fuzzy as soon as the perspective is widened' (p. 14).\nWe sought to widen our perspective on flood memory from a detailed focus upon class, ethnic-\nity and socio-economic status or upon the representation of floods in specific content, carriers or\ncontainers of flood memory (see Erll, 2011). To mentally map the place of flood could make `place'\na container of those memories that might be in danger of creating a cultural `levee syndrome'\n(memories held back and repressed) in which we have contained not only the river but also the\nability to remember and thus imagine water differently. To collect, connect and reinforce flood\nmemories is to accept that flood communities and flood communication are not always rational. In\nfact, we could use the workings of flood memory to explain how the collective memory of disaster\ndecays over time (such as in Gould and White's reference to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake),\nand needs that `sharp jolt of reinforcing information' (Gould and White, 1986: 28) that memory\nwork provides. Thus, we offer a broader perspective on how people at flood risk live in permeable\ncommunities, to both water and to remembering, as well as how forgetting, loss and neglect of\nflood memory also travels within and across these settings:\nIn the transcultural travels of memory, elements may get lost, become repressed, silenced, and censored,\nand remain unfulfilled. This is a consequence of the existence and variable permeability of borders.\nMovement across boundaries is always contingent on specific possibilities and restrictions, which can be\nof a medial, social, political, or semantic nature. (Erll, 2011: 14)\nThe semi-structured interviews covered recording, communicating and maintaining or discard-\ning flood memories, and their perceived relationships to community resilience, as well as showing\nup trans-cultural flood memory across places and settings. Emergent and recurrent themes were\nexplored using NVivo, and thematic nodes were used to pattern the responses to make visible the\nreiterated and itinerant themes, such that we could undertake a thematic analysis.\nOur focus upon finding evidence of active remembering and active forgetting (drawing on the\nwork of Connerton, 2008) in these communities speaks to continua and dis-continua that a historical\u00ad\nscientific approach may miss. We worked from the premise that flood memories can be practised\nvertically (between generations/over time) as much as horizontally (during the incidence of flooding\nthrough a wide variety of persons, media and communications). Connection of the horizontal and\nvertical `planes' on which `memory transmission' occurs is, says Pickering and Keightley (2013:\n115), critical for understanding `the mechanism by which experience derived from others becomes\nintegrated into our own life-stories'. Thus, we explored how flood memories can be sustained across\ncommunities with differing flood experiences and demographics. In what follows, we focus upon the\nfollowing: flood history to (mediated) flood memory; remembering as resilience; emotion, trauma\nand forgetting; and the underlying economies of remembering floods.\nFrom flood history to (mediated) flood memory\nThe 2007 floods were produced by the combination of fluvial, pluvial (rainfall) and excess ground-\nwater, causing extreme flooding in South West England. The `flood rich' period of the last two\ndecades on the middle/lower River Severn had been preceded by a `flood poor' period in the\nflooding in the region were likely to be older and long-term residents. The largest flood in the\nperiod of living memory had occurred in March 1947, in which snowmelt caused by warm rain on\nsnow had added to the volume of water moving down the River Severn, and had been well docu-\nmented by photographs which could be readily remediated from archives by journalists covering\nfor their iconicity and capacity to trigger popular memory, and not for their hydrological or geo-\ngraphical similarity. Their connection also marked old and new media templates as narratively\ncoterminous but technologically distinct.\nOn 25 July 2007, Martin Wainright of The Guardian newspaper wrote,\nBritain is no world-beater when it comes to flood prevention and control, but the country has few equals\nin putting up memorials to great soakings of the past. Everywhere from York to Gloucester via London,\nnotched poles mark the riversides, engraved with historic high-water levels. Prominent on them all is the\ndate 1947, the benchmark year in living memory for every subsequent flood. (Wainright, 2007 (online))\nThis region and this period of time were important for our research for two key reasons. First, the 1947\nand 2007 floods had been intensely mediated through print newspaper and video respectively, with\nphotographs connecting both events. They were being connected in terms of a collective memory to\nreinforce a `Blitz spirit'. Many of our interviewees, mentioned the war as an important marker of British\nresilience to flood disaster. This historical connectivity, neglected living with water as a continuous activ-\nity, and produced the flood narrative in terms of national identity that conjoined extreme weather and war:\nSource: Gloucestershire Echo. Published with permission.A gentleman walked up to me and said in a\nGerman accent, `Tell me, what is the difference between Germany and [Setting 1]? Four years ago we had\nmassive floods and there was looting and fighting. I come to [Setting 1] and everybody has a smile, they're\nout sweeping the streets, emptying their houses of water. It's so different \u00ad why?' I said, `It's the Dunkirk\nspirit!' (Male, 66, Setting 1, describing the floods of 2007 for a digital story)\nSecond, the floodplain residents of the region were a source of living and potentially transmit-\ntable memories of resilience, who had access (whether they knew it or not) to a long history of\nflood materialisation. Thus, the kinds of material that we came across during our interviews and\ncorrespondence ranged from contemporary archives, such as photograph galleries on mobile\nphones and text/image/video files on laptops, to the more traditional, such as newspaper clippings\nin albums, in public houses and personal scrapbooks gathered in plastic carrier bags. One inter-\nviewee kept a decanter on her table, which contained (after over 5years) a volume of turbid water\nfrom when the flood had entered her property (see Figure 2 below). As a memento, this bottled\nfloodwater, was an unexpected materialisation but certainly served to anchor flood memory in a\ntalking point for visitors, such that its story demanded to be told.\nSource: Gloucestershire Echo. Published with permission.\nVan House and Churchill (2008) argue that `[b]oth personal and collective memory rely in part\non the records of the past and on our technologies and practices of remembering' (p. 295). This\nmnemonic connectivity remembered as a living with water (literally living with a decanter of\nfloodwater) was a continuous activity but was not always shared or shareable within and across the\ncommunity. Private remembering of flooding took on micro-discursive and anecdotal proportions\nthat became intimate remembrances with researchers.\nMoreover, it is important to note that this region has materialised flooding over many centuries\nbut that this memorialisation does not necessarily lead to an active remembering as resilience.\nDated public flood marks in the Setting 1 Abbey (see Figure 3), on town walls, commercial build-\nings and in public spaces were joined post-2007 by unofficial flood marks of residents inside and\noutside their homes and gardens (see Figure 4).\nPhotographs of watermarks, or fingers pointing to where water had risen to, became icono-\ngraphic of domestic flood photography and readily shared with researchers.\nOther material evidence of flooding in local landscapes such as stage boards, gauges, barriers\nand large engineering defence systems (see Figure 5) lived alongside less material stories,\nFigure 2. Floodwater in a decanter.\nSource: Andrew Holmes. Published with permission.\nanecdotes, hard copy/digital photographs, collections of maps, scrapbooks, virtual (online) collec-\ntions, and repeated or painful memories (see Figure 6).\nOur research was able to collect a wide repertoire of mediations of flood events from archives\n(official and unofficial). We were also able to show how flood memory continues to be embedded\nin the landscape (flood marks, hard engineering, home protection systems, flood gauges and\nembankments), materialised through domestic media (photographs, home video and increasingly\nsocially networked media and stories): often made personal in its anecdotalisation.\nThis repertoire was in opposition to the iconographic Setting 1 Abbey surrounded by floodwater\nas readily available media shorthand for (biblical) deluge, used both to mediate the flood but also to\ntrigger forgetting by regional stakeholders with image fatigue. Any future Google search of the 2007\nUK Floods will elicit these aerial shots. However, the far more `personal face' of disaster sought out\nby journalists and produced by emerging Facebook groups suggested that media, memory and flood-\ning were becoming critically intertwined. Thus, the 2007 UK Floods provided a benchmark against\nwhich to review policy and practice, and to measure the old/new mechanisms involved in sustainable\nflood memory. Here, an increased focus on community resilience viewed through different lenses\n(institutional, psychological, infrastructural) was integrated with an approach that drew out the mem-\nories of how flooding and FRM policies had played out in historical and living memory.\nTowards remembering as resilience\nIn 2005, the UK Environment Agency's (the environmental regulator, hereafter EA) Report\n`Improving flood warning awareness in low probability and medium-high consequence flood zones'\nSource: Lindsey McEwen.

It recognised the need to profile different target\naudiences in terms of flood awareness, probability and history; the need to define the communication\nobjectives in line with the value systems and perceptions of those different audiences; and to establish\nthe communication mix and channels for delivering different message components. From a media\nand communication studies perspective, this framework conceptualises flood risk as environmental\nevent content and the community as an audience in broadcast terms. Such a framework presents a\nnumber of key questions about FRM in the twenty first century. What are the value systems and per-\nceptions in mixed communities along a floodplain and how might they have been materialised over\ncenturies (not just in the recent past)? What would be the best channels for exchanging messages of\nflood awareness, probability and history in a mixed-media culture where community members are\nnot passive consumers of information but actively living with water? How are communication reper-\ntoires incorporating new methods of engagement with flood risk communities already engaged in\ndiverse practices of personal, collective, social, cultural, archival and materialised flood memory?\nA total of 2years later, the EA was tested to its limits. Water supplies had become contaminated\n(effecting 350,000 people), electricity was in danger of being overwhelmed, with the less noted\nunderlying threat posed to the national security systems of Government Communications\nHeadquarters (GCHQ) being a possibility. While this region had a long history of flooding as noted\nabove, and with 2007 the wettest summer since records began in 1776, it was now becoming popu-\nlarly remembered as a region in crisis, taken by surprise, and un-prepared.\nHowever, at a local level, preparedness was marked in terms of community memory. For example,\nin rural Setting 4, we found evidence of preparedness in the village between new and established resi-\ndents through their references to remembering. In the excerpts below, a new family describe not\nknowing what to do in a flood, but their neighbours knock on their door and advise them:\nBut they knew about the floods and they knew the impact and they knew we'd been flooded and they know\nwhat it's like to have the road flooded and the inconvenience of it, whereas the [family name 1], and the\n[family name 2] who'd only moved in 7days earlier, those people, you felt sorry for them really. (Female\nMoreover, despite the differences between settings in terms of size and demographics, the\nremembering practices of older residents played a pivotal role in the transmission of flood memory\nfor resilience. Those with access to or in a good relationship with this older resident below were in\na privileged position for preparedness:\nAcross the river here, there used to be railings \u00ad about three foot, three foot six and when the river was\nrising if you could see the top of the railings you knew you were alright. Once the railings had disappeared\nyou thought, look out, possibly it's coming. And very often it did. So when the flood is about the only\ncontrolling factor, about whether you are going to get it bad or indifferent is whether there is a high tide\nand whether there is a southwesterly wind with it. South Westerlies push the tide and can bring it up here\nhalf an hour quicker. So, if you've got fresh water, high tide, plus wind, it's a fine line if you're going to\nget flooded or not. (Male, 74, Setting 3)\nThe lay expertise of a local flood protagonist was a prominent feature of this urban community,\nand he goes on to describe how he watches local river gauges to judge the power of any coming\nflood, which is a technique used by other older residents of the city:\nAnd then the Sunday morning I got up early and I could see the water was going to come in because at\n[name] Lock there's measurements and if it's 23-feet which the normal river level is about 10. At 23 it's\ngoing to come in the house.\nYou do get warnings but I go by my own warnings. By the lock, if it's 23-feet. (Female, 79, Setting 3)\nFlood marks, flood gauges, early warning systems (mediated by television, radio and online),\npublic photographs, videos and news reports are the mnemonic practices that ensure that floods\ncannot be entirely erased from lived memory. Nevertheless, remembering resilience (as in the pre-\nvious generation's ability to live with floods) is not the same as remembering as resilience (the\nactive use of personal, collective and cultural memory for social cohesion and preparedness).\nWhile there is less emphasis on how individuals engage with the longer history of flooding in a\ncommunity (materialised through hard engineering, heritage and archives) or the ways in which\nflood communities come into existence through a collective memory of flood knowledge of lay\nexpertise, our research revealed a wide variety of strategies for remembering were being used.\nMarking and recording floods, childhood memories, organisational memory, archival memory and\nthe recollections between stakeholders all played a crucial role in keeping flood memory alive.\nClearly, there are aspects of mental mapping taking place in these accounts. People have spatialised\nmemories of processes and events that form a geographical basis for assessing risk and action in\nrelation to flood events. We feel that there is a complex interplay between the conscious, rational\naspects usually associated with mental mapping and the subconscious and affective processes of\nmemory and habitable place sensing.\nThere were, however, differences in the case study areas in terms of the depth and prominence\nof flood memories. In Setting 3, a small core of (mostly) elderly residents possessed high levels of\nlay expertise. One resident would note the river level as it reached the fence posts by the river and\ncould estimate the time until it reached his street. Looking back to her youth, another resident\ndescribed how she would go to a little hole in a floorboard, through which she poked a stick to find\nout if there was any water under the house yet, its rising or falling. Such ways of remembering\nseemed to be in transition. The interviewees described a disappearing past in which people were\nvery aware of flooding and accepted its effects. One resident told of her disbelief at the reactions\nof newer residents during a recent flood:\nI was quite amused with this recent flooding. Neighbours were ringing up the fire brigade to come and\npump out the water and demanding sandbags from the council. Never thought of this in the old days \u00ad just\naccepted it. (Female, 82, Setting 3)\nIf the case study area in Setting 3 was characterised by strong but fragmenting and disappearing\nflood memories, Setting 1's interviewees demonstrated a more active flood resilience and aware-\nness. Setting 1 had several prominent flood marks in the town centre. During interviews, most local\nresidents produced some kind of personal archive \u00ad be it an album of photographs, a scrapbook or\nan Images folder on a computer. Many described flooding in stoical terms: We just get on with it;\nwe knew it was a flood risk area when we bought the house, it has always been thus, and always\nthus will be. This watery sense of place was often accompanied by a frustration with the town's\nsubsequent media portrayal as a `flood town'. In Setting 1, the Chamber of Commerce (a body\nrepresenting local business) worked hard to express that the town was open to business and that\nflooding was normal and regular, just extreme in 2007.\nPerhaps due to its rural location, small size and the relative wealth of its inhabitants, Setting 4\ninterviewees often described neighbourhood bonds that, unlike Setting 3, remained not only tight\nbut also enabled one of the villages to mobilise a powerful flood defence committee that went on\nto create real change:\n[The Flood Committee] were lucky because [Resident 1] was the secretary, [Resident 2] was the solicitor\nand did all the legals, and [Resident 3] was the engineer. And [TV Presenter] whose mother used to live in\nthe village said if he were still working at [Television Programme] he said he would do a programme on\nthis village. (Female, 73, Setting 4)\nThe Setting 4 community's accounts of resilience also contrasted to the other case study areas\nin that they illustrated how the residents had used their lay knowledge to affect the subsequent\nwork of the agencies on the ground. The individual lay knowledge held in Setting 4 was arguably\nno greater than that of some of the residents of the Setting 3 case study area, but whereas the latter\nvoiced frustration and anger at being ignored by the council and agencies, the Setting 4 residents\nhad succeeded in working in an agency partnership to get a new flood defence system built for their\nvillage. Although the Setting 4 interviewees gave accounts of disagreement, the testimonies of\nflood resilience were markedly different to Setting 3 and this can be seen in two quotations below,\nboth on the subject of neighbours:\nEverybody mucks in. If they know people on the River, they help people on the River. The community is\ngood. (Male, 55years, Setting 4)\n... All strangers ... I don't know anybody next door that side. You see, this house this (other) side was all\nknocked into flats. I think it's either six or seven self-contained units for students. Never see anybody.\nOf the four case study areas, it is unsurprising that Setting 4, a rural village setting with an\nestablished community and a long history of flooding was considered the most resilient. A\nsmall community of 20 houses, with most residents over 50years of age, it defined itself as `a\nvery close-knit community' (Male, 75, Setting 4). During the 2007 UK Floods, the vulnerability\nof residents in their 90s, and the need for younger community members in their 70s to go\nthrough a process of moving furniture upstairs, rescuing residents in boats, and moving vehi-\ncles away from rising waters is less a matter of having an `emergency plan' and more that `we\nwould rely on local knowledge' (Male, 75, Setting 4). Trivial acts of remembering are lifelines:\nevery time it floods, they move their cars to higher ground and the milkman (who remembers\nwhich car belongs to which resident) leaves the milk on top of the right cars. Moreover, impor-\ntant memories serve to instruct present and future generations. The 1947 flood experience is\npassed down from father to son, knowledge of ancient flood banks (with rumour or legend that\nmonks constructed them), and memories of the three different types of flood defence systems\nI think the big advantage is really experience and the next generation experiencing what could be a problem\nin future. My thought is that this third flood bank, year after year it seems to want making higher, so\nobviously the flooding situations over the years getting worse and I think experiences from previous floods\nis quite a benefit for the next generation to understand. (Male, 75, Setting 4)\nFor communities to be aware of flooding (and very importantly to prepare and take action)\nas a form of `socio-ecological resilience' (Adger et al., 2005: 1036), then they need to record\nand remember in some (everyday) way (e.g. home video, photographs or flood marking). We\nfound in our review of the settings that it is very difficult to ensure policies compel people to\ntake any action without them remembering prior flood experience. Even if communities have\nexperienced flooding, the evidence suggests that they not only need repeat experience or need\nto remember the flood events repetitively, but they have to deal with the social and economic\ncompulsion to forget.\nEmotion, trauma and forgetting flooding\nThe continuum of local and sustained knowledge communicated in and between communities\nthrough remembering as integral to resilience, was made possible in our research through sharing\nmemories across the catchments (see follow on ESRC Knowledge Exchange Project 2013\u00ad2014).\nHowever, in gathering that evidence we became equally sensitised to the emotional trauma of the\nflood event and how the remembering of its impact in the present moment of the research interview\nmay re-perform that trauma. This occurred in one workshop as participants re-viewed their digital\nstories with fellow community members and found the mediated remembering distressing. In our\ncoding of the thematic analysis of the interview data, we found that emotion and affect were key\nthemes around which we could build nodes for interpretation (see Figure 7 which demonstrates\nhow we coded the node of Emotion and Affect).\nExamples of active forgetting in the flooded communities were intriguing, and emotion and\naffect played a key role in forgetting; stress over the loss of material items (white goods, furniture,\ngardens and d\u00e9cor) was overshadowed by stories of spoiled family heirlooms, photograph albums\nand mementos. There are memories of the floods that interviewees thought better not discussed,\nmore in terms of the emotional trauma remembering would have on the collective sense of identity\nand community, than on the personal. In the course of the interviewing, we spoke with people who\nhad archives, which they felt \u00ad if publicised \u00ad could be damaging to local businesses or the percep-\ntions of the community:\nThere's massive resistance to acknowledging flooding here [in the county], to the extent that some\nwouldn't take up the grants for property protection. They didn't want to show that their house had been\nflooded. (Councillor, Setting 3)\nWhile we had expected reluctance to remember due to personal trauma and distress, less antici-\npated was the shared urge to forget because of cultural, economic, commercial and governance\nreasons (i.e. the selling of a house, the attracting of new people and tourists, and the effacement of\ndisruption to local business), and attribution of responsibility for flood protection to the State). In\none case, this was connected to the widespread miscommunication that followed the floods and the\ncoverage in national newspapers to the point where people decided to keep quiet and bury their\npersonal archives and memories:\nI've got a whole load [of photographs] that I've kept on the side somewhere but I never got to upload them.\nI was going to but then a couple of months after the flood, a lot of the business people were saying `We've\ngot to do something about [Setting 1 town]'. You mention [Setting 1 town] and all people think about is\nthis picture that appeared in the Telegraph by Getty images of [Setting 1 town] Abbey surrounded by\nfloods. And a lot of the business people thought it was quite negative. So I didn't publicise too much that\nI had the pictures because I didn't want people whinging. (Male, 40, Setting 1)\nTherefore, to forget flood risk (personally and collectively) can be to live with inscribed vulner-\nability in a deep and abiding way but also to remember flood risk (as an individual) is an equally\nvulnerable position to take.\nThe political economy of remembering and forgetting flooding\nAs Krause et al. (2013) argue, `[f]loods are a threat to livelihoods and landscapes in many\nplaces around the world and at many points in history. Yet, they also seem to be an intrinsic\nFigure 7. NVivo-generated image of the `Emotion and Affect' model, showing the child nodes (created\nthrough line-by-line coding) and the Parent node, or Theme, which they are clustered under.\ncomponent of many landscapes and livelihoods' (p. 218). There is much research and policy\nliterature on living with rather than against floods (see Cabinet Office, 2008; Few, 2003;\nJencson, 2000; L\u00f3pez-Marrero and Tschakert, 2011), as well as understanding flooding through\nvalue systems of good and bad water as in Walker et al.'s (2011) flooding as a `socio-natural-\ntechnical assemblage' (p. 2304). In our research, flooding was remembered as `bad water', for\nexample,\nVery nasty stuff floodwater \u00ad very toxic. (Male, 65, Setting 4)\nI couldn't let the cat out because the garden was thick with mud. All this Severn silt you know, trying with\nbuckets to wash it away, and I thought, `I think I'm a bit too old for this'. And my sister-in-law says, `you\nshouldn't be living there'. (Female, 79, Setting 3)\nWhile childhood memories of flooding suggested `good water':\nI've always been brought up around flooding. As a child, we used to walk the floods. We've done it on\nChristmas day, walk to the pub at [meadow], across the embankments \u00ad the flood barriers. There was water\nrushing \u00ad it was quite deep \u00ad all holding hands, linked, and mum had wrapped scarves around our hands.\nI wasn't very old \u00ad 10 or 11-years old \u00ad when I was here in the flood. And I just had the happy memories\nof rowing around in boats and thought it was quite exciting at that age. (Male, 75, Setting 4)\nThe political economy of flood risk shows (see Oliver-Smith, 2009), as does any vulnerability\nto disaster, how `societies incorporate extreme events, whether chronic or one-time/short-lived,\ninto their social, political, and ideological structure' (Jones and Murphy, 2009: 3). If that structure\nis driven by an underlying economy of an urge to forget (to move on, back to normal, business as\nusual, deferral of responsibility) then flood preparedness and resilience is low. Some flood memo-\nries collected also described the breaking up of communities and the loss of local flood knowledge.\nThis is a particular feature of interviews with older members of the community. In the examples\nbelow, two residents of Setting 3 describe the emergence of transient populations in their estate and\nthe subsequent loss of relationships with neighbours:\nWell a builder might probably buy my house, you know. There's a guy next door, he's doing a lot of\nbuilding. ... a house that sold two doors down, and they were actually working on it when the 2007\nfloods came. That was sold to a builder. I don't think you'd get family people buying it. (Female, 79,\nSetting 3)\nAll strangers ... I don't know anybody next door that side. You see, this house this (other) side was all\nknocked into flats. I think it's either six or seven self-contained units for students. Never see anybody.\nFor the development of flood memory and relationships with other stakeholders, the implica-\ntions of these changing communities are unknown. What is clear is that within some of the settings\nthe project encountered members of the community who had a high profile in terms of local flood-\ning and whose advice was trusted beyond that of the local government or the environmental regula-\ntor. In the excerpt below, a resident of Setting 3 describes a neighbour:\nThere's a guy by us \u00ad they call him Noah because he's permanently on about the floods. ... Oh God, he's\na legend. (Female, 79, Setting 3)\nEverything he said would, has happened. It all came true. It all came true. Because the Authority said, `No,\nno, it won't make any difference, you won't get floods and all this'. It's always in the newspapers, and\neverything he said happened, all of it. He predicted everything. (Female, 79, Setting 3)\nMoreover, while political and economic factors drive an exposure to environmental vulnerabil-\nity, as communities expand on coastline cities or in lowland river confluences, those same com-\nmunities materially inscribe their social relations into this built and natural environment (see\nHarvey, 1996). That is, they find ways of remembering flooding (through protagonists such as\n`Noah' above) and flood events over time (through their own personal media collections). At the\nsame time, they are potentially storing those memories in `hard to reach' places, forgetting them or\nnot passing on inheritable knowledge. As the County Archivist stated, when our project promoted\ncommunity remembering,\nI think from a collection point of view, it's made us aware of the value of the material we've got because\nof course we have a lot of plans and maps and other documentation which could be used and is used for\nplanning for development and also future planning for flood relief and things like that. So it just makes you\nrealise that our documents, they have a really important current use as well as for more academic or\nrecreational researchers. (County Archivist)\nConclusion\nIt is not surprising that floods engender long and generalist views of their iconicity and connected-\nness to deep time events considering their impact on communities and lives. Our research only\nfocused on the contemporary flooding of 2007, that had evoked memories of the 1947 floods in the\nregion and began to connect with the deeper archival evidence of floods marked locally both on\nbuildings and in the local county archive. This chimes with the theoretical paradigms of trans-\ncultural memory (Erll, 2011) as noted above, in which memory travels in time and through time,\nalways connecting and being (re)mediated (Garde-Hansen, 2011). As the waters retreat, subside or\nare pumped away, the complacency around inadequate flood barriers and management soon prof-\nfers critical reflections upon local or societal factors that contribute to consequences, from blocked\nditches and drains to global climate change. Thus, a cultural memory of flooding and a collective\nmemory of flood events play a significant and under-researched role in the individual's sense of\nfuture preparedness. With the shift to a paradigm of distributed FRM, the implications for com-\nmunity responsibility and action tend to be significantly underestimated. This awareness is critical\nif communities are to adapt and prepare for future floods, and to take on lead or partnership roles\nin FRM with agencies in changing risk contexts. Community\u00adagency collaborative working at a\nlocal level is a key requirement in local resilience building (see work of the UK's National Flood\nForum) and a memory policy may play an important role in a working across settings agenda.\nIt is worth highlighting that Twitter was yet to come of age in 2007 and this may suggest (to a\nmedia literate urban elite) that regional communities were unable to connect and cope. Yet, a\nlonger view of inherited flood memory tells us something quite different. Resilient communities\nhave access to a wide range of flood materialisation and expertise as found in those settings where\nlay experts were active in communicating their memories and knowledge. Forgetting, though, was\na critical issue: through a loss of flood markers, living witnesses and archival material, and in more\nmacro terms through the political and economic drive to forget. Epistemologically, flood history as\na discipline (in its focus upon disruption, change, adaptation, loss and vulnerability) may forget\nflood memory as a personal and local practice of continued resilience. Thus, future researchers\nshould not limit the study of flood memory to the contemporary period. As we have suggested and\npublished elsewhere, there are deeper histories that draw remembering and forgetting into a rela-\ntionship with flood preparedness (see Krause et al., 2013; McEwen et al., 2012).\nWe have not had the space here to analyse in depth the relationship between memory and the\narchival evidence of flooding in the four settings. Evidence curated for the first time for one of the\ndigital storytelling workshops we ran in Setting 3 revealed an appetite among communities for\nresearching flood archives of local material. Clearly, more research should be undertaken on\nremembering and forgetting over a longer period of time in order to cast light upon the inheritance\n(or not) of customary knowledge and local cultures whose economic activity depends upon or is\ndisrupted by flooding. Such a folkloric memory approach to flooding (that our research only hints\nat) may shed more light on understanding the inheritable social frameworks of flood knowledge\nthat communities may or may not have access to. As we suggested at the beginning of this article,\nwe should understand sustainable flood memory as travelling, across settings as well as through\ntime, and the vehicles by which it moves (in minds, media or archives) require continued connec-\ntion and communication. A sustainable flood memory not only requires improved flood communi-\ncation with and between communities but a questioning of `traditional consultation methods' in\nfavour of `a more pro-active participatory role involving local communities, academics and policy\nThe extent to which flooded communities can take ownership of their own flood materialisation\n(from hard engineering to storytelling) may have an important function for resilience. It also\ndemands `strong interdisciplinarity' in research across the sciences and arts. Therefore, the role of\nthe social, creative and cultural plays just as significant a part in remembering as defence systems,\nbarriers and dredging. Our research, then, is produced within the tension between drama and con-\ntinuity that has characterised UK flood policy as a fairly recent paradigm shift from flood defence\n(working against water) to FRM (working with water). An overview of this shift is provided by\nPender and Faulkner's (2011) edited collection Flood Risk Science and Management, whose cover\nfeatures the iconic 2007 aerial shot of the Setting 1 Abbey surrounded by floodwaters, and an\nimage that members of that community wished to strategically forget for economic reasons. Thus,\nthe implication for us, as researchers, in `dredging up' the memories of flooding, was never far\nfrom our minds and built into our ethical approach.\nFinally, ensuring that communities learn to live with floods has to address a set of dynamics at\nwork in the settings that a memory studies approach reveals: childhood memories and emotional\nresponses of fun and fear, the making and recording of flood memories in the domestic and public\nspheres by individuals, the active forgetting of flooding by businesses and organisations, the\nremembering relationships and organisational memory practices among flood actors, stakeholders\nand flood researchers. Personal memory is a finite resource of potentially high-energy engagement.\nForgetting how to live with flooding reveals a political economy of mismanaging memory (as\nmuch as water) that drives vulnerability. This may go some way to explaining why the direct com-\nmunication effects of flood awareness campaigns do not necessarily produce rational behaviours,\nand that `a stronger model linking domains of psychology, social science and information technol-\nogy' is required (Clark and Priest, 2008, ESRC Report). For this reason, our follow on projects\nwere to work with the EA (the environmental regulator) to explore the role of digital and social\nmedia for producing more sustainable flood memories through personalised and networked digital\nstorytelling and web-based applications.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publi-\ncation of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publica-\ntion of this article: This research was funded by UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Grant\nthe referees for their valuable critique.\nReferences\nAdger WN, Hughes TP, Folke C, et al.
