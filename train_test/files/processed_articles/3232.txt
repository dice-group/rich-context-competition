Introduction\nIn numerous journal articles2 and official statements by central banks3\n, the allocative\nadvantages of minimum reserve requirements have been analyzec1. A classification into\nthe following four functions of minimum reserves has emerged in this literature as a rough\nconsensus:\n1. Reserve requirements can ensure that there is a certain structural demand for central\nbank reserves. In the case of an unstable or even vanishing demand for central bank\nmoney, the central bank can thus guarantee the exist.ence and rough stability of this\ndemand.\n2. Unremunerated reserve requirements are also a sort of tax on the crea,tion of deposit\nmoney by commercial banks. This tax may be efficient from the point of view of the\ntheory of optimal taxation or it may be perceived as a 'fair' price for some central\nbank services for the private banking sector.\n:3. By raising the banks' costs of creating deposit money, unremunerated reserve requi\nrements may stabilize the monetary sector of the economy and thereby reduce the\nimpact of monetary shocks on real economic activity. The increase of the interest\nrate elasticity of the demand for money is often cited as the most important element\nof this stabilization effect.\n4. Areserve requirement that has to be fulfilled only as an average within a certain\nreserve maintellance period enhances the flexibility of banks in their money mana\ngement and contributes to the smoothing of short-term interest rates, as transitory\nliquidity shocks are mapped into interest rate variations in a cushioned way.\nAs often as these functions have been affirmed, they have also been questioned many\ntimes.4 Especia.lly private banks who are subject to reserve requirements and who have\n1I wish to thank Henner Asche.

Of course, any remaining errors are mine.\n\nto compete with foreign banks that are not have criticized reserve requirements for a\nlong time. For example, the Bundesverband deutscher Banken [1996, 20] concludes in a\nstudy on the desirable instruments of the European Central Bank that minimum reserve\nrequirements are neither necessary for an effieient monetary poliey nor for money market\nmanagement anel thus should not be used in stage three of the European Monetary Union.\nThe crucial question in the current debate on minimum reserve requirements is probably\nwhether the functions 3 and 4 mentioned above are really relevant or not. Both pretend\nthat (constant) minimum reserve requirements can contribute to economic stabilization.\nTlwy can be analyzed to a large extent separately: function 3 is tied to the incompleteness\nof remuneration and the size of the reserve requirement. It is independent of any averaging\nprovision. Fundion 4 is dependent on averaging yet independent of the remuneration of\nrequired reserves, and it is even independent of the size of the reserve requirement as the\nbanks' capacity to build up temporary balances at their central bank accounts can be\nchosen regardless of the size of the reserve requirement.\nIn this paper, I have attempted to base my analysis as much as possible on an 'incomplete\ninformation' approach. Economic reality differs from textbook neoclassical models in so\nfar as in the real world coordination problems resulting from incomplete information have\nfar-reaching economic consequences. Money itself is an institution which would have no\nrelevance in the neoclassical world of perfect information and zero transaction costs. It.\nis added to the real economy as a veil, or in other words, there is a perfect diehotomy\nbetween the real and the monetary 'seetor'. This implies that any true mierofoundation\nof the t.heory of money (which may be classified into the theory of monetary order and the\ntheory of monet.ary poliey) must be founded on thc economics of incomplete information\n(or on the economics of 'transaetion costs').\nHayek [1945, 519] was the first author t.o stress the fundamental role played by incomplete\ninformation in thc analysis of economic order:\n\"VVhat is the problem we try to solve when we try to construct. a rational ecollomic order? ..\nTh/? peculiar cllaracter of the problem of a rational economic order is determined precisely\nby the fact. that knowledgl\" of t1lP circumstances of which we mllst make use never exists in\ncOllcent.rated or integrated form, but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently\ncoutradictory knowledge which all the separate individllals possess.\"\nThe monetary order of an ecollomy is one aspect of its general orgallizat.ion. Thus,\naceording t.o Hayek, a genuine analysis of the problem of designing a mOlletary order\nmust. a.s alrea.dy remarked, he founded on the analytics of ineomplete information. This\n\nnatura.lly inclueles the question of whether or not rmmmum reserve requirements are\nbelleficial and whether or not an averaging option should be granted 1,0 banks concerning\nt.heir reserve fulfillment.5\nThe objective of a central bank should be to provide a monetary system mlmmlzmg\ntransaction costs in the real economy (by provieling a medium of exchange, a store of\nvalue, and a unit of account) and which, at the same time, is not itself a source of\ndestabilization anel macroeconomic coordination failure. The central bank's instruments\nfor achieving this purpose can be grouped into two categories, namely: (1) the design of\nthe monetary order and (2) the design of areaction function (a function which maps any\nobservation by the central bank of the state of the economy into a monetary policy). There\nshould exist Olle simultaneous specification of both groups of instruments which minimizes\nthe macroeconomic coordination failure generated by instabilities of the monetary sector\nand which thereby maximizes economic welfare.\nBut why should it not suffice to choose an adequate reaction function in order to achieve\noptimum stability? \\Vhy shoulel the monetary order as weIl be relevant for stabilization?\nIt is again Hayek [1945. 524J (a committed opponent of the idea of a centrally pla,nned\nemnomy) who gives the genera.l answer to this question by stressing the fundamental\nrelationship between the dispersion of information and the necessity of a decentralization\nof fconomic decision taking:\n\"If we agrf'e that. thc economic problem of societ.y is mainly one of rapid adaptat.ion to\nrhangf's in t,he part.icular circul11st.ances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the\nultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who\nkllOW dirf'ctly of the relevant. changes and of the resourees immediately available to meet\nthem... We must solve it by some form of deeent,ralization.\"\nThe claim of the idiosyncratic relevancy of the monetary order for macroeconomic stability\nis related to this insight. If all information on the (monetary) state of the economy were\nconcentrated at the centra.l bank, stabilization policy could probably be reduced to the\nchoke of an optimal reaction function. But if information about monetary conditions\n18 dispersed among many a.gents, one should expect that the stability behavior of the\nSThe eritique of any microfoundat.ion of the theory of monetary poliey and of monetary order that\nis not based Oll some ineomplete and asymmetrie information setting is in a sense similar to that of\nCoase [1960] eoncerning welfare economics. Coase showed that traditional welfare eeonomies is built on\nshaky ground as it analyzes phenomena such as externalities and monopolist.ic priee setting in a zero\ntransartion-cost, (or eomplete information) framework, despite the fact that those types of eoordination\nfailure ean be explained only with transaction costs (or incomplete information).\n\neconomy cannot be analyzed without looking at the monetary order and the way ill\nwhich it shapes the disclosure of private information and its aggregation a,nd transmission\ninfo financial prices and quantities.\nThe discussion of bot.h stabiliza,tion aspects of reserve requirements will in thi8 sense illu\nstrate that (1) the stahilization of the real sedor of the economy hy shaping the monetary\norder has to be a.nalyzed in the framework of an incomplete information approach and\ntbat. (2) a dispersion of information is a necessary condition for the idiosyncratic influ\nellce of the monetary order (beyond the central bank's reaction funetion) for economic\nstabiliza.tion.\nIn tlw rest of the paper we proceed as follows: In seetion 11, two aspects of minimum\nreserve requiremcnts that arf' not of an informational economic nature in thc narrow\nsemw will be briefly rf'viewed. First, thc quest.ion of whether or not minimum reserve\nrequirements are lleeded in order to create a structural demand for centra} bank mOlley\nis analyzed; secondly, it, is examined what can be said about the efficiency of minimum\nreserve requirements from the point of view of the theory of optimal taxation (function\n2). In sections III and IV, both stabilizing functions of (consta.nt) minimum reserve\nrequirements are discussed using approaches founded as far as possible on an incomplete\ninformation setting. Section 111 primarily reviews and classifies the literature about the\nstabilizing impact of the non-remuneration of minimum reserve requirements (regardless\nof averaging provisions). Section IV ana.lyzes in t,he framework of a signal extrartion\nmodel t.he implications of the granting of an averaging provision, regardless of t.he size amI\nremunerat.ion of the required reserves. In both sections III and IV, the crucial question\nis whf'ther t,he reviewed instit.utional arrangements can enhance the information flOWR\nhet.ween tlw centra.l bank. private banks and the genera.! public and if they can t.h11S\ncont.ribut.e to a reduct.ion of macroeconomic coordination failure in the form of fluct.ua.tiom;\nof emnomic act.ivity originating in shocks in the monetary sedor. In Section V, a summary\nof t.he results is given and some conclusions are drawn.\n\n11. Short review of two functions of reserve requirements which are not related\ndirectly to a problem of incomplete information\nIn this section, we briefly review two aspeets of minimum reserve requirements which\ncannot be interpreted directly as being related to some 'built-in stabilizing' effeet due to\nthe dispersion of information between the central bank and the private banking seetor.\n11.1 Creating an artificial structural demand for central bank money\nIn the oider literature justifying reserve requirements, it was sometimes claimed that only\nsuch requirements would ensure that the creation of deposit money by private banks did\nnot lead to an infinite monetary expansion and thus an undetermined price leveL6 The\ncritical assumption far deriving this result is that currency and deposit money are perfeet\nsubstitutes. This can be easily illustrated in the framework of the theory of the money\nmultiplier (between the monetary base and, for example, MI): if the ratio of currency\nto transaetion deposits is not well-defined and thus possibly zero (because of the perfect\nsubstitutability of both categories of MI), then the money multiplier will be undefined 01'\neven infinite (if thc voluntary reserve holdings of the banking seetor are zero). Then, a\npositive minimum reserve requirement limits the expansion of MI and thus is a necessary\ncondition for the existence of a finite price level.\nIn the present real world, deposits and currency are not perfeet substitutes. If riIoney\nholders have weIl defined preferences for different components of MI, banks will not be\nahle to create an arbitrary quantity of deposit money, as their customers will transform\napart of the bank money into currency. Even if banks hold no reserves at all, MI will be\nwell-defined and finite for any quantity of central bank money.\nBut this present stability is no guarantee that innovations in the private money supply\nwill not introduce in the near future a greater instability of the money multiplier and, in\nthe medium term, a far-reaching decline in the demand for central bank money.7 These\nwhether minimum reserve requirements are necessary is already discussed extensively for example by\nany quantity of deposit. money. hut he nevertheless advocates the introduction of a minimum reserve\nrequirement in Great Britain: \"These regulations would greatly strengthen the power of control in the\nhands of lohe Bank of England placing, indeed. in its hands an almost complete cOlltrol over the volume of\nbank-money without in any way hampering the legitimate operations of the joint stock banks.\" (Keynes\n[1930, 11, 77)). He also suggests that the reserve ratio should be variable and adjusted as a function of\n'Fama [1980] allalyzes the relevance of minimum reserve requirements in a. futuristic, currency-free\n\nprospects are a strong argument in favor of generally keeping the minimum reserve instru\nment, even if, for other reasons, the reserve ratios would be reduced to zero for the time\nbeing. A raising of the reserve ratio in response to a substantial shrinking of the demand\nfor central bank money would guarantee at least the rough stability of the monetary sy\nstem. The private economic agents' knowledge of the fact that the centra.l bank has a\npowerful instrument in its hand to guarantee a chosen scarcity of central bank money\nstabilizes expectations and secures the confidence of the markets in the monetary order,\nwhich is a crucial condition for the effident work of any modern exchange economy.\nHow can the function of minimum reserves reviewed in this section be exactly separated\nfrom the one reviewed in section III? The potential shock assumed here (the shrinking of\nthe natural demand for central bank money) is permanent and not transitory as the shocks\nin section III, where a eonstant reserve requirement is seen as a so-called built-in stabilizer.\nAnother difference is that here it is ultimatively irrelevant what kind of good is subjeet\nto reserve requirements. In section III, it is decisive that certain kinds of bank deposits\nare subject to the reserve reqnirement. A third differenee is that the function of reserve\nrequirements discussed in this section can become a necessary condition for maintaining\ncentral bank money as the nurruiraire of the economy, whereby the function discussed in\nseetion III never becomes really fundamental for the preservation of the monetary order.\nII.2. Allocative implications of the taxation effect of reserve requirements\nUnremunerated or only partia.lly remunerated reserve requirements are also a kind of\ntax on the bank deposits that are subject to the reserve requirement and are a souree\nof income to the central bank. In general, taxes are related to some form of allocative\ndistortions and related welfare losses.\nA number of papers analyze in a rather abstract form the alloeative effects of the taxation\ncomponent of reserve requirements in the context of models of overlapping generations\neconomy. If in such a. context, the central bank defines some good as the mImeraire for which no natural\ndemand exists, then areserve requirement would be a necessary condition for having weil defined prices\nexpresssed in this numeraire. However, the best long-term solution in such a case would be to choose auy\nreal good as t.he numeraire for which scarcity is weIl defined without the creation of an artificial demand.\nFor example, Browne (1996] analyzes concretely the current and expected innovations in the demand for\ncurrency and in payment. systems and their implications for monetary stabilit.y.\nBAll t.hese models are deterministic, such t.hat potent.ial benefits from reserve requirements related to\ntheir impact on information flows are not. analyzed in their framework. Romer (1985] points out t.hat\n\nviewed by Baltensperger [1982b]: he thinks that the taxation effect of reserve requirements\ncompensates for another distortion, namely the one implied by the non-remuneration of\ncurrency which is a substitute for deposit money. The non-remuneration of compulsory\nreserves would then neutralize the distortion by rendering currency relatively more attrac\ntive compared to deposit money.\nUltimately, one has to ask whether the tax effect of a non-remunerated reserve represents\nan optimal tax according to the theory of optimal taxation, whieh postulates the optima\nlity condition that thc marginal welfare eost of a11 kinds of tax income should be equa1.\nThus, the releva.nt question in the ease of the central bank's (or the sta.te's) ineome from\nreserve requirements Is whether the marginal welfare eost (considering a11 benefits and\ndistortions ) equals the marginal welfare costs of other forms of taxes. Let us assume that\nthc relevance of function 3 of minimum reserve requirements (discussed in the next see\ntion) can be neglected. Then the justification for the non-remuneration of reserves rests\nexelnsively on taxation aspects, as function 1 and 4 are independent of remuneration.\nIn the case of open capital markets (and stable exchange rates), the international mo\nbility of at least apart of deposits is relatively high, such that sman differenees in the\ntax on deposits (implicit in the reserve requirement) imply large outfiows of certain types\nof deposits. The sensitivity of the tax basis regarding the size of the tax is thus rather\nhigh. In such a context, it is not efficient to tax the concerned deposits and it should\nbe expected that thc (national) marginal welfare eost of income generated by those unre\nmunerated reserves is higher than the one of other forms of public income. 1'0 avoid the\nrelat.ed inefficieneies. required reserves on the sensitive types of bank liabilities could be\nremunerated or the coneerned reserve ra,tios could be reduced.9\nreserve requirements are not exa.ctly eqllivalent to a tax on deposits. He derives an optimal combination of\npublic im'ome from monet.ary expansion, minimum reserve requirements and debt expansion. Sargent and\nWallace [198.'i] analyze the implications of paying interest. on required reserves and reach the conclusion\nt.hat. sueh an arrangement. would imply a continuum of equilibria. This result seems to be related to the\nassumpt.ion timt all forms of money are perfect substitut.es. Mourmouras and Russe! [1992] analyze under\nwhieh conditions an unremunerated minimum reserve and a deposit taxation ar~' 'broadly equivalent'.\nFreeman and lIaslag [199.'5J claim that the distortionary effects of reserve requirements are always larger\nthan those of normal taxes.\nreserves: internat.ional dist.ortions between different financial centers; dist.ortions bet.wcen financial inter\nmediaries that are subject to reserve reqllirements and those whieh are not (or between deposits whieh are\nsllbject. t.o reserve requirements and deposits whieh are not); disl,ort.ions between different kinds of banks\nwhich differ for example in t.he amount of free reserves they would hold without any reserve requirement.\nThe second type of distortions implies t.hat there should be a permanent observation of whether substi\ntutes for deposits su bject to reserve requirement.s a.re created by banks 1.0 eireumvent. reserve regulations.\n\nAn alternative to the adjustment of a countries tax implicit in reserve requirements for\nthe reasons mentioned naturally consists in an adequate adaptation of the reserve requi\nrements in the other countries of the region of high mobility of deposits. The crucial point\nis that the implicit taxes on the more mobile types of deposits should be harmonized. In\nthe case of such a harmonization, the sensitivity of the tax base (the volume of deposits)\nregarding the reserve ratio would be much lower and it would be difficult to prove that the\nmarginal welfare cost of public income induced by a low reserve requirement on deposits\nis higher than the welfare costs of other types of tax income.\nThe emergence of such substit,utes raises the marginal welfare costs of the reserve l'equirement tax and\nshould eventually be prevented by some regulat.ory or legal action.\n\nIII. U nremunerated constant reserve requirements as a tool of macroeconomic\nstabilization (regardless of averaging provisions)\nIn this section, we review the problem of minimizing the impact of stochastic exogenous\nshocks on endogenous goal variables in the framework of Poole's [1970] method. In the\nbasic specification, it is assumed that the reduced form of the macroeconomy can be\nrepresented by the following system:10\nwhere ;Tt E Rn is a vector of stationary economic variables (i.e. GDP growth, inflation,\nmoney supply growth, interest rates, etc), ;1:0 E Rn is the vector of natural or goal values,\ntt E Rm 1S a vector of exogenous shocks which do not affect the natural (or goal) values\nof the endogenous variables and which are not anticipated by the central bank. The ex\npected values of the elements of tt are zero and the variance-covariance matrix of tt is\nknown. The matrix A E Rn*m describes the relationship between exogenous shocks and\nthe endogenous variables. The central bank can influence the matrix A with its parame\nters<p (<Pb <Pz, ...,<Pk)' Those parameters can be divided into the two subcategories of\ninstruments: (1) monetary order parameters (as the size and remuneration of minimum\nreserves), (2) parameters of thc rcaction function of the ccntral bank (as the interest rate\nelast.icity of money supply). Let the central bank have a quadratic utility function:\nn\n~Vt = -\nL Oi(Xti XOi)Z (2)\ni=l\nThe Oj represent. the weights of the endogenous variables in the central bank's utility\nfUllction. The central bank determines the values of the parameters <P to maximize the\nexpeded value of this function (corresponding to a minimization of a weighted sum of the\nvariances of the endogenous variables).\nOnly one part of the literature presented in this section explicitly analyzes the stabilization\neffect of reserve requirements. The other part looks at the choice of the reaction function\nand the central bank's instrument. But in both cases, the ultimate questioll is the Olle of\nshaping the matrix A in the reduced form (1). In fact, it does not make sense to have\ntwo parallel stabilization theories (one for the monetary order parameters and one for the\nreadion function) as both are closely interrelated.\n10 A variant of this model where the eoefficients themselves are stochastic has also been discussed in\neonsider this slightly more complex variant here. Another interesting extension of the model is the one\nhy Kareken, Muench and Wallace [1973J and LeHoy and Waud [1977J. In these papers, the problem of\nsignal extrartion is int.roduced in a multiperiod specification of the stabilization model.\n\nIn the following, we give a short survey of parts of the related stabilization literature. The\ncontributions are grouped into four categories. In a fifth section, we contribute another\nvariant of the stabilization model illustrating the relevance of the dispersion of information\nfor the significance of employing minimum reserves as an instrument of stabilization.\nof minimum reserves on intermediate targets as monetary aggregates or inte\nrest rates. 11 The general conclusion of those papers is that the size and remuneration\nof reserve requirements is relevant for monetary stabilization which implies that reserve\nrequirements are in principle useful to stabilize the monetary sector. However, none of\nt.he papers really shows that the destabilization induced by a lowering of reserve require\nments from a low level (as for example the one prevailing in the US or Germany for the\npresent) to zero would be substantial. On the contrary, Brunner and Lown [1993a, 204],\nwho estimate their model, come to the following conclusion: \"[O]ur work... suggests that\nlower reservf' requirements are unlikely to have much impact on volatility in the reserve\nmarket. Although there may be other reasons for maintaining a certain level of reserve\nrequirements, a significant increase in volatility of reserves and the funds rate does not\nappear to be one of them.\"\nA general problem of this approach is that it is not well-motivated to focus on the stahili\nzation of intermediate targets and not of final ones. It is assumed implicitly that both are\nequivalent, which is not necessarily true. I2 To criticize this assumption does not imply\nCl. critique of looking at intermf'diate targets as monetary aggregates at all. This may\nstill be the best way to assure credibility and the ultimate goal of a low inflation rate.\nThe point is that the stabilization of monetary aggregates by reserve requirements may\ntheoretica.lly end up raising the volatility of the real sector.\nThe rest of the literature reviewed here analyzes the stabilization impa.ct of policy para.\nmeters on the final goal variables of price level and GDP.\n11 In the framework of models which are more differentiated in the time dimension, Kopecky [1988] and\nLasser [1992] analyze the relative impacts on the stability of monetary aggregat.es of a lagged reserve\naccounting, a contemporaneous reserve accounting and an 'ahnost contemporaneous' reserve accounting.\nPolleit [1996] analyzes the relevance of a differentiation of reserve ratios with regard to different kinds of\nbank deposits on the stabilization of different monetary aggregates with reserve requirements.\ndesverband deutscher Banken [1996, 19] criticize the stabilization of intermediate targets in the case of\nminimum reserves.\n\n2. Richter [1968J was the first author to analyze the role of minimum reserves as a\nmacroeconomic built-in stabilizer in a comparative-static setting.13 He coneludes that\nthe stahilization effect. of reserve requirements ultimately depends on the coefficients of\nthe model, but that the case in which minimum reserve requirements a,ct as a \"built-in\nSiegel [1981J and Baltensperger [1982aJ show in their models that the variability of the\nmonetary aggregate is minimized by a 100% reserve ratio. But the reserve ratio mi\nnimizing the variability of the pr'ice level depends on the coefficients of the model and\nthe correlation structure of the shocks. It can take any value between zero and one.\nBa1tensperger [1982a, 214] remains agnostic in his conelusions: \"The fractional reserve\nsystem has a fiexibility and elasticity that may be a disadvantage in some situations, but\nthat may equally be an advantage in other situations. I conelude that it is difficult and\nprobably not advisable to choose between a low and a high reserve requirement on the\nbasis of this kind of stability considerations.\"\nSiegel [1981] is more courageous and estimates his model for the US with quarterly data\nfrom between 1952 and 197:3. He coneludes that the optimal average reserve requirement\nwould have been 7% instead of the actual 11.5%. On the other side, the difference in the\nstanda.rd deviation of the quarterly price level would only have been minor. For reserve\nabout 0.5% respectively. Thus, the consequence of a reduction of the reserve ratio from\na high level (compared to the present one in Germany) to zero would have been rather\nmmor.\n3. The weIl known model of Poole [1970] focuses on the question of the optimal monetary\ninstrument (a monetary aggregate, an interest rate or an intermediate solution) in a\nstochastic IS-LM model, without explicitly considering minimum reserves. He is one\nof the first authors to stress the relevance of the incompleteness of information for such\nproblems: \"The choice of instruments problem is elearly a consequence of uncertainty, and\nanalysis of the problem requires a stochastic model\" (Pooie [1970, 214]). The stochastic\nIS-LM model contains the following two equations:\nwhere Y is the GDP, M is a monetary aggregate, r is the interest rate, ao, al, bOl b1, b2\n13Reserve requirements influence the multipliers of Richter's model, which is not explicitly stochastic,\nbut which ('an be easily interpreted as such if the exogeneous variables are seen as random variables.\n\nare coefficients with al < 0, b1\n> 0. The random variables /1, v both have an\nexpected value of zero, variances (j~, (j~, and a covariance (j11M\"\nThe realizations of these\nrandom variables take place such that the central bank is not able to react by adjusting\nits instruments.The model has two equations and three variables (y, M, r). The central\nbank chooses between fixing M, r or the parameters Mo, h in the linear money supply\nfunction\nM = Mo + hr (5)\nIn a deterministic framework (a framework of complete information) where (j~ = (j~ = 0,\nit is irrelevant which instrument the central bank chooses. Any intended (natural) value\nof Y can be realized with any instrument.\nThis is no longer true in the case of uncertainty. With a combined policy (5) (which\nincludes the cases of a pure monetary and pure interest rate instrument as special cases),\nwe obtain thf' following reducf'd form for Y:\nao(b2 - h) + alMo b2 - h al\nY= - /1+ V\n+ al bl - h b2\n+ al bl - h b2\n+ al bl - h\nThe policy parameters hand Mo are now relevant for the level and the variance of Y and\nthus for the expected value of the central bank's utility function. The central bank should\nset h at a level where it minimizes the destabilizing influence of the exogenous shocks,\nand in a second step it should choose 1\\,/0 such that it obtains the preferred expected value\nof Y.\nHow is Poole's observation related to the stabilization effect of minimum reserve requi\ncentral bank uses the minimum reserve ratio instead of Poole's interest elasticity of money\nsupply (h) to stabilize the economy. Both approaches can and indeed must be unified in\none model. A separate analysis of the stabilization impact of the centrals bank's money\nsupply function on the one hand and built-in stabilizers as minimum reserves on the other\nis not useful as the impacts of both types of policy parameters are interdependent. In\naddition, we are interested in the question of whether there are 'redundancies' in the sense\nthat the central bank does not need as many policy parameters as available to achieve\nthe highest possible stability. If some stabilization policies imply certain welfare losses\n(independently of the stabilization problem), a redundancy should be noted as it implies\nthat the best stabilization result can be obtained without using the instrument(s) with\nbad properties. This is the insight of Horrigan [1988].\n4. Horrigan [1988] shows in the framework of a macroeconomic model with rational\nexpectations that the size and remuneration of required reserves are irrelevant from the\n\npoint of view of stabilization of the price level and economic activity, as the impact of\nreserve reqnirements can also be obtained by an adequate adjustment of the interest rate\nelasticity of the money supply. He is the first author to explicitly merge the minimum\nreserve literature ala Baltensperger [1982aJ with the general stabilization literature ala\nThe redundancy hypothesis ean be easily il1ustrated in the framework of an augmented\nmodel of Poole [1970J (Horrigan's model is slightly more eomplicated in its representation).\nA fixed money multiplier is introduced into the model and the supply of eentral bank\nmoney is modelled similarly to the money supply in the original model. Suppose that\nthe relevant monetary aggregate M 1S related to the quanitiy of eentral bank money\nZ = Z~ +gr by:\nlvI = k(Z~ +gr), (7)\nwhere k is the money multiplier whieh ean be determined by the eentral bank via the\nminimum reserve ratio. The eentral bank now has three poliey parameters, but the\nredundancy of one of them i8 obvious. Any money supply function ~o/Is = .0/10\n+hr ean\nbe implemented for any value of k by choosing adequately the values of Z~, g. Minimum\nreserve requirements a.re thus not necessary in this framework and shollid not be used for\nreasons of simplicity (evenif minimum reserves do not imply any special welfare losses).\nThe redundaney re:mlt of Horrigan [1988] thus includes this simple fixed money multiplier\nvariant of the Poole model.\nBut how robust is this result? Are minimum reserves redundant in any reasonable model\nof the economy? It is easy to show that this is not the case. By small modifications of the\nmodel of Horrigan (including the introduetion of additional noise terms), the redundaney\nresult breaks down. Again, this ean be easily illustrated in Poole's [1970] elementary\nsetting by augmenting equations (3) and (4) by the following one:\nA1 = k(Z~ +gr +(), (8)\nwhere ( is an additional random variable with E(C) = 0, a varianee (J'~, and eovarianees\n(J'tf.L' (J'Zv' The redueed form for Y now becomes\nAgain, the central bank minimizes the varianee of }r by choosing k and 9 and then sets\nZ~ such that E(Y) = Y\"'. The eoeffieient of ( in (9) reveals that there is HO longer any\nredundaney in the parameters of the central bank. All three are needed to obtain the\noptimal stabilization around a prefered expected value of Y.\nIn general one should expect that if the modelling of the economy is suffieiently eomplex\nand if suffieiently many exogenous shocks are included, then it beeomes very unlikely\nthat minimum reserves and the interest rate elasticity of the eentral bank's money supply\nare eompletely redundant. This is espeeially plausible if one eonsiders that different\nsubjects in the eeonomy should have different information about the state of the eeonomy\n(which is relevant for their optimization behavior). IL for example, the banks have private\ninformation about the monetary state of the eeonomy, this should be a sufficient reason\nto make reserve requirements non-redundant as they shape ineentives of a category of\neconomie agents whieh have relevant information the central bank does not have.\nHorrigan's [1988] contribution consists more in having demonstrated that the impact of\nminimum reserves on macroeconomie stability cannot be seen independently of other\npolicy parameters of the central bank and that the question of the neeessity of minimum\nreserve requirement has to be analyzed in eonjunction with all other availahle monetary\npolicy instruments. The redundaney result itself is probably not correct in a complex\nworld. But that does not prove the necessity of minimum reserves as the insight on the\ntheoretical relevanee of reserve requirements for stability is only a first and relatively\nminor step towards the claim that a certain minimum reserve requirement is optimal for\na certain conerete economy.\n5. Now an additional version of Poole's [1970] model is presented illustrating how the\ndispersion of information between the central bank and the private banking sector can be\nseen a.., the crueial dimension of the redundaney question. This time equations (3) and\n(4) are eompleted by:\nThe terms /iN and /ic represent the ex ante expectations of the realization of the monetary\nshock 1/ by t.he eentral bank and the private banking sedor, respectively. It is assumed\nfor hoth that the money market shock is relevant for their optimizing behavior. This\nimplies that the degree of anticipation of shoeks must playa role for the stability of the\nmacroeconomic system. Equation (10) represents the supply of central bank money by\nthe central bank. It is assumed that the central bank observes ex ante\nwhere (N is a noise variable with an expected value of zero and a variance (J'~,N' The\nparameter Cl is another policy parameter of the central bank. By choosing Cl, the central\nbank decides on the relevance of prior information about the shock for its monetary\n\npolicy. Equation (11) represents the creation of money by the private banking sector. It\nis assumed that the private banks observe a variable\nVG = V\nwhere (G is another noise term with an expected value of zero and a variance O'Z,G' The\nrandom variables (G and (N are assumed to be uncorrelated. If we assurne that C2 =f. 0,\nthen the money market shock is indeed relevant for the private banks' money supply.\nThe central bank now has Jour policy parameters to achieve its goals, namely g, k, Cl and\nZ~. But how many parameters does the centra.l bank really need for the stabilization of\nY'? The reduced form of Y now takes the following form:\nY = ao(b2 - kg) +alkZ~ + al\n+blal - kg b2+blal - kg b2 +blal kg\n+blal - kg bz +blal kg\nThere are now four random variables influencing Y. In table 1, we distinguish mne\ncombinations of ex ante knowledge of the central bank and private banks. For both, three\ncases ean be distinguished, namely perfect anticipation of v (O'Z,G 0; O'Z.N 0), partial\nanticipation of v (O'Z,G > 0 and finite; O'Z,N > 0 and finite), and no prior information on\n(0). Let us assume that Z8 is always used after the determination\nof the other parameters to implement the optimal value of E(Y). Of the remaining three\nparameters two or three are necessary, depending on the information dispersion:\nTablf 1: Non-redundant policy parameters\nrZ,G r(,G I, rZ,G\nA~, g) Cl and k and 9 * cd k/1) and (k or g)\nO'Z,N > 0, finit Cl and k and 9 * Cl and k and 9 * Cl and (k or g)\n= 0 and k and 9 * Cl\n= 0 and k and 9 '\" Cl\n= 0 and (k or g)\nMinimum reserves are non-redundant in the combina,tions with a star '*'. Thus, the\ndispersion of information is a. crucial dimension for the question of whether minimum\nreserves are redundant or not. Since the interactions between economic variables are very\ncomplex in the real worId and knowledge about monetary conditions is widely dispersed,\nwe should expect that minimum reserves and the interest rate elasticity of the reserve\nsupply are ultimately not redundant.\nConclusion of Section III: In the real worId, non-remunerated required reserves have\na spe6fic influence on macroeconomic stability and especially on the variability of real\n\neconomic activity around its natural level. The redundancy result of Horrigan [1988] is a\nspecial case, which is especially unlikely in the case of differences between the knowledge\nof banks and the knowledge of the central bank about the monetary state of the economy.\nAs such differences certainly exist in reality, the minimum reserve instrument is in principle\neffective for stabilization purposes. The precise stabilization impact of reserve require\nments depends on the size of the requirement. A wrong positive reserve ratio can lead to\nless stability than a reserve ratio of zero. The best reserve ratio from the point of view\nof stabilization depends on the economic structure, the information dispersion among the\ndifferent economic agents and the variance-covariance structure of the exogenous shocks.\nThe empirical implementation of this insight in the form of an estimation of the optimum\nmimimum reserve ratio has not been realized up to now in a convincing way. Moreover,\naccording to the few empirical contributions which have been made so far, the estimated\nimpact of low reserve requirements on economic stability is rather smalI.\n\nIV. A veraging provisions and the information content of money market rates\nIV.1 Some preliminary welfare economic remarks on the decentralization of\nmonetary decision rights\nThe granting of averaging provisions m the fulfillment of reserve requirements to the\nprivate banks has been advocated in the literature as a means of smoothing short term\nsmoothing effect of reserve requirements with averaging provisions results from the fact\nthat the banks can use the additional reserves for intertemporal arbitrage in refinancing.\nFinally, the intertemporal arbitrage activity of the whole banking sector implies that the\ninterest rate effects of all anticipated temporary liquidity shocks are smoothed away.\nUnfortunately, the literature does not explain the informational and real sector conse\nquences of the smoothing of money market interest rates. This deficit has been detec\nted by opponents of minimum reserve requirements. For example, the Bundesverband\ndeutscher Banken [1996, 19] explicitly denies that more erratic money market rates in\nGermany (due to an abolishment of reserve requirements) would do any damage to the\nreal economy.\nWhy should the smoothness of short term interest rates be an objective of the design of\nthe monetary order? In answering this question, it is important to note that the central\nbank could always achieve a complete smoothing of interest rates by an infinite interest\nrate elasticity of money supply at a certain interest rate (which would be modified from\ntime to time when the central bank would have received any news about the optimal\ninterest rate for achieving its final goals). Such a supply function could be implemented\nby two standing facilities, a deposit facility and a lending facility offering and charging the\nsame interest rate, respectively. The fact that central banks generally do not implement\nsuch a system shows that centra.l banks do not really want to smooth a. tout prix. They\nprefer certain market developments to be reflected in interest rate movements. What\nkind of developments does the central bank want to be smoothed out and what kind\nof developments does it want reflected in interest rates? Does an averaging provision\nsmoothes out the 'bad' fluctuations and does it conserve the 'good' ones?\nIn this section the smoothing argument will be further developed to be able to answer such\nquestions. In the framework of a simple signal extraction model, this section will illustrate\nthat an averaging option may facilitate, for private market observers on the one hand and\n\nfor the central bank on the other hand, improved extraction of the permanent component\nin the money market intel'est rate and thus enhance the aggregation of a certain type of\ndispersed information into prices according to Hayek [1945]. In this sense, an averaging\nprovision can be seen as a decentralization of monetary decision rights reflecting the\ndispersion of knowledge about monetary conditions.\nIn traditional welfare economics, the regulation of a market (or a pigou tax or subsidy)\nhas to be motivated by some externality. Which externality at the money market could\nmotivate a regulation of banks' liquidity cushions (such as, for example, a minimum\nrequirement)? Why shouldn't the cushions banks hold voluntarily be optimal from the\npoint of view of society? In answering this question, one should be aware of the fact\nthat money is a natural monopoly good because its consumption has positive network\nexternalityeffects. The provision of natural monopoly goods is a public task or has to be\nat least regulated by the state. In the design of the monetary order, one therefore does not\nhave anyway a classical market situation as the reference point of a regulatory analysis\n(Hayek [1976] denies this point by claiming that a private provision of money should be\nefficient). It thus does not make any sense to criticize minimum reserve requirements for\nbeing a regulation not in conformity with the principles of a market economy as it has\nsometimes been done by opponents of reserve requirements. On the other side, the lack\nof a pure market reference does not rule out a comparative welfare analysis. The welfare\nimplications of two alternative regulations of the monetary order can always be compared.\nThis remark in mind, it is suggested hen\" that the granting of an averaging provision can\nbe interpreted as fo11ows: the holding of liquidity cushions implies opportunity costs in\nthe form of interest rates for the banks. In deciding about the size of liquidity cushions,\nballks compare their private marginal benefit to their private marginal costs. But beside\nthe private returns of liquidity cushions, these ha.ve an important positive externality,\nas they enhance the information content of money market rates concerning the longer\nterm prospects of monetary and real interest rate conditions which are a basic variable\nfor a11 intertemporal investment decisions of the economy.14 Because of this positive\nexternality, the cushions chosen by banks would be too small from the point of view of\nsociety. A subsidization of cushions or a prescription of cushions in the form of reserve\nrequirements (with averaging) both influence the effective quantity of liquidity reserves.\nThe additional capacity of intertemporal arbitrage in refinancing i8 the crucial element of\naveraging provisions. In general, it is not relevant whether the compulsory reserves are\n14See Hirshleifer [1971] and Grossman and Stiglitz [1976] for a general analysis of t.he welfare a:,pects\nof t.he production and aggregation of information.\nremunerated or not and whether the averaging capacities are created by a positive reserve\nrequirement or by permitting the banks temporary overnight overdrafts as in the Bank of\nCanada's system of 'averaging around zero'. (Still another possibility to internalize the\npositive externalities of liquidity cushions would be to pay an interest rate on voluntary\nreserves. )\nThe choice of those details has some distributional implications. It can also have allocative\nimplications if the banks ca,n consider the costs of the regulation in some prior decision\nillfluencing the burden of the regulation, as for example in the case of an unremunerated\nreserve requirement when the banks can transfer deposits subject to reserve requirements\nabroad.\nAnother welfare eifect of the smoothing of interest rates should be briefly mentioned:\nFor money users, transitory scarcity shocks are relevant in so far as they imply that the\nmarginal costs of borrowing money fluctuate. It is plausible under various settings that a\nconstant interest rate corresponding to the average of fluctuating interest rates is better\nin welfare terms for money users than fluctuating rates. If banks have any information\nabout the permanent/transitory decomposition of shocks the central bank does not have,\nthen the banks' liquidity cushions implied by minimum reserves with averaging help to\nsmooth the ma.rginal costs of borrowing money and thereby raises welfare. This benefit of\nsmoothing could be realized by standing facilities which would guarantee a fixed interest\nrat.e (which i8 not true for the signal extraction argument).\nIV.2 The idea of a small signal extraction model\nIn the framework of a two period model, the 'informational efficiency of t.he money market'\n(which is defined here as the information content of the money market interest rate with\nrespect to its permanent component) will be analyzed for the case of no averaging and the\ncase of an averaging provision with an averaging length of two periods. Three independent\nshocks occur on the money market: two transitory shocks relevant only in the first and\nsecond period respectively and a permanent shock relevant in both periods and further on.\nNone of the shocks is correlated with any other. The transitory shocks are viewed as short\nterm liquidity shocks for which the interest rate is not relevant. Such liquidity shocks may\noccur at special transaction dates (as for example tax payment dates), at special currency\nwithdrawal dates (as for example in Germany on Saturdays in December), in connection\nwith very large single transactions, etc. The permanent shock can be interpreted as a\nvariable refiecting the monetary policy stance of the central bank and/or as a variable\nreflecting structural development.s on the side of money users, as changes in the domestic\n\nuse of currency, changes m the currency demand of foreigners, innovations in payment\nsystems, etc.\nDifferent interpretations of the model can be given concerning the information flows on\nthe money market. We distinguish three groups of agents: banks participating in the\nmoney market, market observers (a11 other private agents for which the interest rate is\nrelevant) and the centra.l bank. None of the agents has to have prior ,information about\nthe permanent shock but it is assumed that the central bank and the private banking\nsector both have specific ex ante knowledge about thc transitory shocks affecting thc\nmoney market. It could be assumed, for example, that the transitory shocks are the sum\nof one trallsitory shock anticipated exclusively by the central bank and one anticipated\nexclusively by the private banking sector. For reasons of simplicity, we assume that the\ncomponent of transitory shocks that is anticipated by the central bank is automatica11y\nneut.ralized by it, so that. we can concentrate on thc transitory shocks about which the\nprivate banks ha.ve some private aclvance information and the central bank does not.\nOnly in the case where the private banking sector had no specific advance information\nabout transitory shocks at a11 would the argument of the model break down. In this\nunrealistic case, it would be :mfficient to have the central bank smooth away a11 transitory\nshocks, 01' speaking in Hayek's [1945] vocabulary, as the1'e would be no real dispersion of\nknowledge, no decentralization of decision 1'ights would be necessary.15\nIn the choice of an order of t.he money market, one important goal should be to maximize\nthe informational efficiency of the market in the sense of the information content of the\ninterest rate concerning its permanent component. The extraction of the permanent\ncomponent of the money market interest rate is of interest for a11 three types of economic\nagents: for the banks and market observers to be able to take better economic decisions\nand for the central bank to be able to implement a better monetary policy with the goal\nof price and output stabilization.16 Some authors (Kasman [1993], Ayuso, Haldane and\nwrites about its possibilities of anticipating and neutralizing transit.ory money market shocks: \"In order t,o\nplan and to undert.ake its operations effident.ly. the Bank maintains running forecast.s of the cash position\nof tlw banking syst.em - daily for several weeks ahead, and on a weekly or mont,hly basis over a longer\nhorizon... There is considerabJe ullavoidable uncertainty in such forecast.s. The faft.ors which contribut,e to\n(,he market.'s position are known with varying degrees of certainty at. varying stages in advance.\" It. could\nalso be the case that the central bank is in principle capable of collecting all the information the private\nbanking sedor has about transitory money market shocks by itself and of intervening correspondingly,\nhut, that. t.he resource costs of such a dat.a collection would be very high and t.hat it. is just. more efficient\nt.o delegate t.he smoothing task to t.he private banks which are much doser to the necessary information.\n16The estimation of the permanent component of the money market interest rate is import.ant because\n\nRestoy [1994], King [1994]) claim that a lIigher volatility of the short term interest rate\nhas 110 impact on signal extraction problems as there is no significant positive correlation\nbetween the volatility of money market rates and the volatility of longer term (f\u00fcr example\none year) rates. But this reasoning does not necessarily seem convincing: If the volatility\nof transitory liquidity shocks is less stable than the one of permanent shocks, then one\nshould not observe a positive correlation between the volatility of the short term rate and\nthe volatility of the long term rate. In periods of a large variance of thc transitory shocks,\neconomic subjects could learn only little about innovations in the permanent component.\nThus, the correlation between short- and long-term rate volatility could even be negative\nand the low correlation between both volatilities does not prove the irrelevance of the\nsignal extraction problem.\nIn the model, central bank money is lent for exactly one period. At the beginning of each\nperiod, central bank money (the only kind of money in the model) is alloted to banks for\none period via an auction to which the private banks have to submit demand functions.\nAfter receiving the money, the banks lend money to their customers. If no averaging\nprovision exists, the money lent by banks to customers must correspond exactly to the\nmoneY received at the auction. At the end of the period, the customers return the money\nto the banks and the banks return the money received at the auction to the central bank.\nOlle could ask how interest is paid on the money lent as there is no money in the system\nexcept that which is lento We can assurne that interest rates are paid in some real unit\nas ounces of gold. As the relative price 'units of money per ounce of gold' is well-defined,\nevery interest rate payment can easily be expressed in ounces of gold.\nIn the following, three variants of the model will be presented. They differ with respect\nto the ex ante knowledge of private banks concerning transitory money market shocks.\nThc two extreme cases of no averaging at all and unrestricted averaging will be analyzed\nin all three variants. In the sections following section IV.3, different partial restrietions\nto averaging will be discussed in the framework of the first variant.\nit is correlat.'d (or even eorresponds) to t.he long-term interest rate via some arbitrage equation.\n\nIV.3 The information content of the money market interest rate with and\nwithout averaging\nThe three variants (aL (b), a.nd (c) of the model each suppose a different anticipation\nof the transitory shocks by the private banks. If averaging is allowed, the competing\nbanks (which are assumed to be identically informed) will participate to the first money\nmarket auction in such a way that the expected money market interest rates in both\nperiods are equal (as long as this condition is not fulfilled, individual banks could lower\ntheir refinancing costs by some intertemporal reallocation of refinancing). We thus have\nto cakulate the money demand functions of the banks which guarantee this condition.\nAssurne that. the money demand by bank customers is deterministic and constant in each\nperiod. The difference between the quantity of money allotted to the banks in the money\nmarket auction and the money passed on by the banks to their customers represents the\nbanks' reserve holdings in the respective period.\nFor reasons of simplicity, the demand functions submitted by banks to t.he money market\nauction will be restricted to parallel shiftings of the money demand functions of the bank\ncustomers. Let the aggregated money demand function of the customers be, in both\nm t\nd = a - b\"\nwhere a, bare constants with a > 0, b > 0 and i is the rate of interest. to be paid. Let a\nsmall 'm' stand in general for quantities of money lent to customers and a capital ']\\;1' for\nquantities of money at the level of the money markeL The quantity of money available at\nthe money market auction for the private banks is assumed to be, in the first and second\nperiod respectively:\nMt = Al x - Yl + di1\nwhere d > 0 is a constant and x, Yl, Y2 are uncorrelated random variables with E(x) =\nE(Yd = E(Y2) = 0 and Var(x) = a;, Var(Yl) =\na;, Var(Y2) = a;. This should be\ninterpreted as follows: the central bank offers a quantity of money Al + di, but this\nsupply is reduced (augmented) by demand shocks of x + Yl (period 1) and x + Y2 (period\n2). Various causes of the money market shocks can be imagined. In the variants (a) and\n(b) of the model, we can interpret the shocks as arising at the level of the banks just before\nthe auction. In this interpretation, the banks would face two kinds of money demand by\ncustomers: one which is independent of interest rates, which cannot be infiuenced by the\nbanks, and which occurs as realizations of a random variable before the auction (x +Yl\nin the first and x + Y2 in the second period); and one which depencls on the interest rate\n\nset by the banks and which is identical each period. Then, the banks would enter the\nfirst money market auction with a demand function Mt = al - bi1\n+:r +Yl and would be\nconfronted with the money supply MI = M +dito Keeping this possible interpretation\nin mind, we further develop the model by formally localizing the shocks on the money\nsupply side. In the case of variant (c), it is more difficult to localize the shocks in the\nWithout an averaging option, the market equilibrium of both periods has to be calculated\nseparately. With averaging, the model has to be solved in all variants in the following\nthree steps:\n1. The private banks submit money demand functions Ml at - bit to the auctions\n(t 1,2). The expected money market equations in both periods are thus:\n\n\nThen, the expected equilibrium interest rates are:\n\n\nIn the intertemporal arbitrage equilibrium, those expected rates have to be identicaL\n2. The (identical) expected interest rates ca,n be calculated from the condition that\nover both periods, the money demanded by bank customers must correspond to the\nmoney received by banks at the money market auctions) such that the bank reserves\nare zero on average (a positive reserve requirement could be treated correspondin\ngly):\nE(Af{(i)) +E(Af;(i)) = m~(i) +m~(i) (22)\n{:;> E(i*) _1_\n(a _M +E(x) + E(Yd +E(Y2)) ' (24)\n17Howevel', one could imagine a similar variant where the shock would occur at the level of the banks\nafter the auction. Then. the banks would have to decide after the shock on the allotment of money to\nthe regular customers' demand.\n\n3. With this equilibrium interest rate, al and a2 can now be calculated by substituting\n+ E(Yd _ --'-'---\"- (26)\nWith the al cakulated, the banks enter the first auction in each of thc three variants (a),\n(b), and (c).\nVariant (a) of the model\nIn this variant, the private banks exact1y anticipate both transitory shocks YI, Y2 before\nthe first auction; interest rate differentials will be arbitraged away completely even ex\npost. This property permits a representation of the two periods' money markets and the\naggregated market in a simple diagram. The equilibrium interest rate with averaging\ncan be found as the intersection of the aggregated demand and supply functions. By\ndrawing a line back to the individual periods' diagramms, one can determine the money\ntransferred to the bank customers and the refinancing balances.\nMf(id\n2 aggregated market\nMf(i) + Mt(i)\nThe variables have thc following interpretation: if is the equilibrium interest rate in the\nfirst period, if averaging is not allowed; i* is the equilibrium interest rate in both periods,\nif a.veraging is allowed; M; (Mt') is t.he quantity of money allotted on the money market\nto the banks in period 1, if averaging 1S (not) allowed; mi is the quantity of money lent by\nthe banks to their customers in period 1, if averaging is allowed; Mt is also the quantity\nof money lent by the banks to their customers in period 1, if averaging is not allowed.\nCorresponding variables are used for the second period. The reserve balance of t he banks\nin t.he first period is M; mj'; in the second period t.he balance is exactly reversed and\nequals mi  lvl2\u00b7\nBefore the first auction, when the banks plan al, a2, they anticipate perfectly the transitory\nshocks; therefore: E(Yd = Yl and E(Y2) = Y2, implying: al = a + (-Yl + Y2)/2 and\nZI Z2 = d +b a - . +x + 2\nThe reserve balance of the banks in the first period is tlms: SI A1f(ir) - mt(ir)\nal bir - (a - bij) = (-Yl +Y2)/2; in the second period it is S2 -SI-\nWe are now interested in measuring the information content of the interest rate concerning\nits permanent component x, with and without averaging. The problem of estimating the\nrea.Iization of unobservable random variables of which an observed variable is a linear\ncombination is treated in the theory of signal extraction (see for example Sargent [1979,\nIn the case of one observed variable, the linear least-square signal extraction model has the\nfollowing structure: Let i* be an observed variable and assurne that it is known that i* =\na'.Y, where a '\n= (aO,al, ...a n ) is a vector of known coefficients, X = (XO,XI,X2,\"\"Xn)'\nis a vector of random variables, Xo 1 (deterministic) and for j l...n, E(xj) = 0,\nVar(xj) a} and COV(Xj, Xl) 0, Vj =I- I. We are looking for a linear estimator of one\nof the unobserved random variables, Xk, using the observation of i\"'. One has thus to\ncalculate the two coefficients \u00dfo, \u00dfl in the equation Xk = \u00dfo +\u00df1i*, in order to minimize\nthe squared error of the estimation:\nIt is shown in appendix 1.1 that the optimal coefficients \u00dfo, \u00dfl are:\n\nBy substituting those values of \u00dfo, \u00dfl, one obtains the expected squared error in estimating\nthe unobserved variable Xk:\n\nNow, the quality of the extraction of the permanent component of the interest rate will be\nanalyzed. The cases with and without averaging will be compared, both for the situation\naft.er the first and the second period's auction. It will be shown that temporarily the\nsignal extraction is better with averaging than without.\n\u00b7 Information content of the interest rate in the first money market auction\nWith averaging. Here, the linear relationship between the interest rate and\nthe unobservable money market shocks is:\nd+b(a-M+x+ 2 )\nBy using the signal extraction formula (see appendix 1.1), we get the estimator\nfor the permanent component x:\nE(xli~) = -(a\nThe expected squared error of the estimation is:\nE((x - x?) =a;\nLet us now introduce a numerical example which will be used several more\ntimes in the course of the paper. Let d =0,5, b 0,5,\na = 10. Then, when observing for example ii = 8:\nThe interest rate expected for the second period is also 8. The interest rate\nexpectf'd in the long run (for the time after the maintenance period) is 7.\nThe squared errot' in estimating ;T (identical to the one of estimating the long\nrun interest rate) is 1/3. For each additional interest rate point observed, the\nexpectation concerning x, and in thf' specific example also the expectation\nconcerning the permanent interest rate rises by 2/3. This 'slope coefficient'\nbecomes smaller when the va.riance of Y rises and larger if the variance of x\nrises. If a money market is exposed to a strong transitory shocks, the signal\nconcerning the long-term interest rate given by a rise in the interest rate by\none percentage point is weaker then on a money market with a low transi\ntory volatility. Hence, if the transitory volatility rises, an adaptation of the\ninterpretation of changes in the money market rate prevents the expectatio\nnal errors rising proportionally. But this adaptation cannot prevent. a certain\ndeterioration of the extraction of the permanent component of the interest rate.\nIt should be noted that the information content of the interest rate concerning\nits permanent component (at the beginning of areserve maintenance period)\ncan be further increased by extending the maintenance period bf'yond two\nperiods. The expected squared error in estimating x (after observing the first\n\nauction'sinterest rate) will be, expressed as a function of the length n of the\nmaintenance period:\nIf the length of the maintenance periods goes to infinity, the expected squared\nerror approaches zero. Of course, the supply of central bank money would no\nlonger be well-defined with an infinite maintenance period.\nNo averaging. In this case, the interest rate in the first period will be:\nUsing again the signal extraction formula, we get the estimator for the perma\nnent component:\nThe expected squared error is:\nThis error is al'llJaYs [arger than the one in the case of averaging. In the specific\npermanent component is:\n'#\n.\nand the squared error is 1/2. The expected interest rate for the second period\n(which is identical to the interest rate expected in the long run) is E(iflif\n\u00b7 Information content of both periods' interest rates taken together.\nWith averagillg. Both periods' interest rates are identical here, implying\nthat the second period cannot add any information to the first \u00fcne, meaning:\nThe expected estimation error is also unchanged relative to the situation before\nthe second auction.\n\nWithout averagmg. In this case, the interest rate of the second auction\ncontains additional information. As we observe now two independent interest\nrates, we have to apply the signal extraction model generalized to TI observa\ntions as presented in appendix 1.2. The linear relationship between the shocks\nand the interest rate in the second period is:\n- M+x +Y2)\nThus, the matrix A which describes the relationship between all observed va\nriables and the unobserved shocks (Ur, if)' = ao +A.(x, YI, Y2)', see appendix\nA =\n(d~b d~b ~)\nBy applying the signal extraction formula derived in appendix 1.2, we get the\ntwo coefficients (\u00dflJ \u00df2)':\n-:--(d_+_b\nThe identity of the weights of both interest rates follows from the symmetry\nof both lines of the matrix A. The estimated values of (\u00dfll \u00df2) have to be put\ninto the signal extraction formula\nM)] +\u00df2[Z2 - (d +b) (a M)]\nThis estimator has to be substituted into the squared estimation error which\nyields a rather complicated expression. For the specific example (d = b 0.5,\nand thus, for example:\nThe interest rate expected in the long run is 7. The squared estimation error\nis 1/3. Thus, after both periods, the information content of interest rates is\nindependent 0/ whether averaging is allowed or not. This result is not only\nvalid for the specific example, but general.\nIn this variant (a) of our model, the information content of the money market rate can\nthus be raised by granting an averaging option, but only temporarily. At the end of a\ntwo-day maintenance period, observing the interest rates is equally informative with and\n\nwithout averaging. But since a temporary informational advantage is clearly useful for\neconomic decision taking during t.he maintenance period, we can conclude for this variant\nof the model that averaging is useful.\nVariant (b) of the model\nIn this variant, the banks only become informed about the second transitory shock after\nthe first money market auction.

To assure the identity of expected interest rates, the conditions al\nand E(a2) = a +Yd2 have to be respected and thus:\nJust before the second period's auction, the banks learn about the second transitory\nshock.

Thus, when planning al before the first\nauction, E(Yd E(Y2) = O. As the banks have no useful knowledge about thc transitory\nshocks before the first period to engage in intertemporal arbitrage, al = a will be chosen\nand the equilibrium interest rate is:\nCoutrary to the two preccding variauts, the auction itself reveals new information to the\nbanks which is used to decide about thc reserve balance SI and the quantity of money leut\nto customers ml.

The first lines of the matrices A (the first\nperiod's interest rate equations) are identical. But in the second lines (the second\nperiod's interest rate equations) one can see an additional noise term in the case of\naveraging relative to the case without averaging. This noise term is related to thc\nfact that the surprise in the first money market auction implies an inverse balancing\nnced in the second period.\nIn the following table 2, the resuIts of all three variants of the money market model are\ndisplayed far the cases of averaging and no averaging and for thc situation after one and\nafter two periods.

In variant\n(a), both have identical informational properties. In variant (b), the quality of signal\nextraction is better with an averaging option. In variant (c), observers of the interest\nrates can learn more about their permanent component if there is no averaging provision.\nAll in all, one may conclude that an averaging provision is certainly favorable to signal\nextraction at the beginning of a maintenance period and that its total benefits should be\nceteris paribus higher, the better the banks participating in the money market anticipate\ntransitory liquidity shocks.\nAfter having analyzed the extreme cases of unlimited averaging and no averaging at all,\nwe will review intermediate arrangements in the next section. Intertemporal arbitrage\nmay be restricted by a limitation of the reserve balance, by a reserve balance fee (in the\nform of a difference between the overdraft and the surplus interest rate) or by the setting\nof an interest rate corridor implemented by a deposit and a lending facility. Only the\nvariant (a) of the model will be considered, but the results in variant (b) would be rather\nsimilar.\nIVA The effect of limiting the reserve balance\nExisting minimum reserve arrangements with averaging provisions (as in the US or in\nGermany) have a limitation to the overdraft relative to the required average reserve hol\nding: banks are not allowed to have a negative balance on their central bank account\novernight. Therefore, the maximum allowed reserve balance corresponds to the size of the\nreserve requirement. This is not a general necessity. In principle, the limitation of the\nreserve balance (the allowed overdraft relative to the required reserves) is independent of\nthe size of the reserve requirement. For example, the averaging around zero - arrangement\nof the Bank of Canada allows for overdrafts without having a positive reserve requirement\nat all.20 With a positive reserve requirement, one could imagine granting an averaging\ncapacity of one half, 01' double, or tripie of the reserve requirement, and so on.21 We\nwill now analyze briefly in the framework of variant (a) of the model presented above the\nimplications of a limitation of the averaging capacity for the information content of the\ninterest rate concerning its permanent component.\nSuppose that the aggregated averaging capacity (the allowed reserve balance) of the banks\nsyst.em.\n21 If the averaging capac.ity is bigger than the reserve requirement, then banks should be required to\nprovide collaterals for the net. overdrafts.\nis limited to Smax. Vve can then derive critical values of the difference between the\nfirst period's and the second period's transitory shocks, at which the averaging capacity\nis exactly exhausted. Pairs of shocks with bigger differences cannot lead to additional\narbitrage. The information content of the interest rate thus must be interpreted by\ntaking into account the fact that the interest rate can be the result of three different\nlinear equations mapping the shocks into the interest rates. It has been shown above that\nthe balance in period 1 in variant (a) of the model is: 51 = (-Yl + Y2) /2. Thus, the\nmaximum averaging capacity will be exhausted if I- Yl + Y21 ~ 25max. If the averaging\ncapacity is exhausted, the linear relationship between the money market shocks and the\niuterest rate is transformed into another linear relationship. \\Ve thus have to distinguish\namong three situations:\n1. If IYl - Y21 < 2Smax, the linear relationship between the shocks and the observed\ninterest rate is:\n'. 1 ( ~-.,. + + Yl + Y2 )\nZ\n= -- a - lVi X\n- 5 max - M + x + Yl)\n3. If (Yl - Y2) :S -2Sma.x, then al = a + Smax and thus:\nZ1 = d + b a + max - - + x + Yl )\nThe bigger Smax is, the more often case 1 is the underlying one, and the more similar the\nsignal extraction problem becomes here to the one with unlimited averaging. The smaller\nSmax, the more often cases 2 or 3 are relevant, and the more similar the signal extraction\nproblem becomes to the one without any averaging.\nIn appendix 2.1, the calculations to obtain the information content of interest rates in the\ncase of a limited averaging capacity are given. Here, we only look at the signal extraction\nproblem in the specific example (d = b = 0.5, u; u; = 1, M = .5, a = 10) with normally\ndistributed shocks and represent the information content of the interest rate as a function\nof Sma.x graphically.\n\nThe expected estimation error falls as a convex function from 1/2 at Smax\nas Smax -7 00. The marginal costs of narrowing the averaging capacity (with respect to\ninformational efficiency) thus rise monotonously. If the central bank only has an aversion\nto very large reserve balances of the banks, it can forestall such balances by a sufficiently\nbroad limitation without badly damaging the information content of interest rates.\nIV.5 The effect of an averaging fee\nIt is costless for banks to undertake intertemporal arbitrage activity in the framework of\nareserve averaging facility if reserve overdrafts and surpluses are rewarded and charged\nrespectively with the same interest rate. This has not necessarily to be the case. The\nBank of Canada's avemging around zero system charges interest rates on overdrafts but\ndoes not remunerate the required compensating surpluses (Bank of Canada [1991, 26]).\nLet ih be the credit interest rate for positive balances and let is be the debit interest rate\nfor negative balances with is\n2: ih . In our two-period model, the averaging fee then is,\nindependently of whether the overdraft takes place in the first or second period, equal\nto IS1\\(is\nih ). The competing banks will smooth the interest rate until the expected\ninterest rate difference IE(iz) - E(idl exactly equals is\nih \u00b7 Let us define A = is - ih\nas the cost of averaging. Again, we will focus exclusively on variant (a) of the model.\nSimilarly to the case of a limitation to the averaging capa.city, three situations have to be\ndistinguished:\n1. If IE(iz) EUl)1 ~ A ~ -A(d +b) ~ Yl - Yz ~ A(d +b) without any averaging\n\nactivity, then no averaging will take place, so that:\nd +b(a M +x\n+Yl )\n2. If E(i2) - E(id > A {:} Yl - Y2 > A(d +b) without any averaging activity, then\nthe banks will have an overdraft in the first period, 51 > 0, so that: i2 - i 1\n= A,\nimplying:\n3. If (E(i2) - EUl)) > >. {:} Yl - Y2 < ->'(d +b) without any averaging activity,\nthen the banks will have a reserve surplus in the first period, 51 < 0, so that:\n-(E(i2 ) - E(il )) A, implying:\nZI = d +b a - M +x + 2 - '2\nThc higher the averagillg fee, the more often the first situation is relevant and the more\nthe signal extraction problem resembles to the one without any averaging at all. The lower\nthc averaging fee, the more often situations 2 and 3 are relevant and the more the signal\nextraction problem resembles the case of unlimited averaging. The formal treatment of\nthc signal extraction from the first period's interest rate in the case of an averaging fee\ncan be found in appendix 2.2. Again, we will restrict ourselves here to looking at the\ninformation content of the interest rate after the first auction graphically in the specific\na; = a; = 1, NI = .), a 10) with normally distributed shocks.\nThe expected squared error in estimatillg the permanent component x is plotted in the\nfollowing figure as a funet,ion of the averaging fee. The squared error starts with 1/3 (no\nfee) and grows monotonously to 1/2 (infinite fee). The function is convex up to a certain\nvalue of >. and then becomes concave. By imposing a small averaging cost, thc central\nbank can prevent averaging taking place in thc case of small transitory shock differentials\nwithout badly harming informational efficiency.\n\nIn the case of an averaging fee, the aspect of income generated for the central bank may be\nof some interest too. The expected quantity of averaging can be expressed as a function\nof the fee as folIows:\nU('\\) = - (dHl\nf ( )f ( ) (IYl- Y21 _ '\\(d +b)) d d\n'\\(d +b)) d d\n=\nThe fee income function N('\\) is then N(,\\) = U(,\\)'\\. Both functions are plotted for\nthe specific example in the following two figures. If the central bank has well-defined\npreferences concerning informational efficiency on the one hand and income on the other,\nshe can choose a corresponding optimal ,\\ which has to be smaller or equal to the ,\\ which\nmaximizes income. Obviously, the central bank can come elose to the income maximizing\n,\\ without. seriously reducing the information content of the money market rate.\n.,\\ ,\\\nIV.6 The role of an interest rate corridor implemented by a deposit and a\nlending facility\nIf x, the permanent shock to the scarcity of money, is interpreted exclusively as a variable\nin the hand of the central bank, and if one thus interprets the problem of communicating\ninformation via the money market interest rate as a problem of revealing the intended\ncentral bank policy, then it would be best - in the framework of our model - to set a very\nnarrow interest rate corridor implemented by two standing facilities. This way, the central\nbank could completely stabilize the interest rate and reveal ;1: as precisely as desired. The\nfact that no central bank has chosen such a framework shows that the central bank wants\nthe money market interest rate to reveal information about (permanent) developments\ncoming from the central bank money demand side. The central bank may desire such an\ninformation revelation for itself (to use the information in its monetary policy decisions)\nand also for other market observers. In this section, we thus assurne that x is exclusively\na variable reflecting developments in the structural component of the scarcity of money\ncoming from the side of the market.\nIf the ioterest rate is adsorbed by one of the corridor rates, some information about x is\nlost. The more narrow the corridor is, the more information is thus lost. If the interest\nrates of the deposit and lending facilities are identical, the observation of the interest rate\nis naturally worthless and E(x - X)2 =\na;. There are critical values of\nwhich lead to a corridor interest rate and beyond which the size of this sum is irrelevant\nfor the observed interest rate. In the corridor implemented by the deposit rate iez and the\nlending rate i1Zl\nthe interest rates ii' and if are distributed as if there were no corridor.\nLet j* and j# be the interest rate variables with and without averaging, as weIl as without\nany corridor. Then: P(i~ ilJ\ni:Jj(ii)dii, and PUi = iez )\n= J~~ J(ji)dji, as weIl\nJiez\nas\nil and P('# f( '#)d'#\n'# Zlz\n'#)d'#\n')\nz\nBecause of the lligher variance of j without averaging, P(\nif Zlz\n') + Pi\n(' #\nprobability of the realization of a corridor inteTest rate without averaging is always bigger\nthan PUi = !/z)\n+ P(ii iez ), the corresponding probability with averaging. The density\nfunctions J(ii), J(if) are plotted for the specific parameter coostellation a 10; M\n!); a.~ = 1; a~ 1; d 0.5; b = 0.5 and llormally distributed shocks in the following figure.\n\nThe density functions are drawn as thick points at izz ,iez\nto express that they cannot\nbe represented correctly here as a positive probability lies on a base of size zero. The\nfigure illustrates that a narrowing of the corridor reduces the difference in the information\ncontent of interest rates between the cases with and without averaging: the narrower\nthe corridor is, t.he more often the same interest rate occurs with and without averaging,\nnamely a lending rate or a deposit rate.\nThe- decision of the centraI bank about the width of the corridor may depend primarily\non the ide-a it has about the direction of the information flows via the money market\ninterest rate: from the central bank to the private banking sector or from the private\nbanking sector to the central bank. The more the centraI bank itself uses the interest\nrate to assess the structural developments in the demand for central bank money, the\nwider thc corridor should be. If the money market rate is primarily designed to reveal\ninformation about the central bank's policy intentions, the corridor should be narrow and\nthe relf>vance of having an averaging option becomes small.\nIV.7 Selection and combination of restrietions to averaging\nFoUl' possibilities to reduce the quantity of averaging can be considered: (1) limiting the\nallowed private banks' reserve balances, (2) charging an averaging fee, (3) implementing\nan interest ra.te corridor by two standing fa.cilities, and, if one quits the framework of our\ntwo-period model: (4) the shortening of the length of the maintenance period.\nHow and to what extent the averaging activity should be restricted naturally depends on\nthe motivations for this restriction. There is no extensive analysis of this question in the\nminimum reserve literature. Let us briefly discuss two possible motivations.\nThe fi1'St follows from the fact that the granting of an unrestricted averaging option\nimplies the inability of the central bank to implement anticipated changes of money market\ninterest rates in the course of an averaging period. In the medium term, there is an optimal\nnominal interest rate being a function of, among others, the inflation rate, the inflation\nrate relative to the target rate, the degree of capacity utilization, exogenous shocks, etc.\nThe centra.l bank tries to implement an interest rate path that follows as closely as possible\nthe path of the optimal interest rate. Let us assurne now that the central bank and the\nprivate banks know the path of the optimal interest rate. Then, the private banks will\nsmooth out the anticipated changes of the nominal interest rate, independently of whether\nthey are due to transitory shocks 01' to attempts of the central bank to have the interest\nrate follow changes in the optimal interest rate. Then the interest rate will not follow\nthe optimal path but will move around this path in steps. In the following figure, this\nis il1ustrated for the case of an optimal interest rate following a path i = 6 t/4 and\nmaint.enauc<' periods of onf' aud four mondls.\n5.5 illtprest rate pa.th with a 4-month averaging period\n5 imerest rate path with a I-month averaging period\ntimf'\nThe deviations of the effective interest rate from the optimal one imply a suboptimal\nmonetary steering of the economy with related welfare losses. The longer the maintenance\nperiod, the bigger the average deviation will be and the bigger th~ welfare losses due to\nthe subotimal monetary steering will be: In the case of falling optimal interest rates\nlt 70 a.t (0 > 0) and an Tl - month maintenance period, the average deviation of the\nInterest rate from its optimal value is na/2.\nAn obvious reduction in this deviation can therefore be attained by shortening the main\ntenance period.22 Other possibilities to reduce or eliminate this problem completely are\ncons of carry-oller-pr'ovisions, which allow to the banks to carry over reserve balances at the end of a\nmaintenance period into the following maintenance period. Such provisions currently do not eXlst in\nGermany, but in the US, where hanks can carry over up to two percent of their reserve requirement as a\nbalance into the next maintenance period. The pros and wns of carry-over provisions should have some\n\nto impose a maximum reserve balance Smax or a fee A. If the averaging fee is bigger than\nna/2, there will be no smoothing out of anticipateel optimal interest rate changes. If the\nfee is lower, the interest rate will be fixed elose to the beginning and end of the averaging\nperiod. In the middle of the period, the interest rate will still follow the optimal path. If\nthe central bank chooses a monetary quantity path consistent with the optimal interest\nrate path if no averaging is allowed, then the introduction of an averaging option with a\nmaximum reserve balance implies a fixed rate in the middle of the averaging period and a\nparallel path t.o the optimum path elose to the heginning and end of the period. It should\nbe noticed that the central bank can ultimately implement any interest rate path if there\nis a limit to the reserve balance by varying the quantity of reserves supplied sufficiently\nin the course of the averaging period.\nThe 8ccond motivation for limiting the amount of averaging activity can be derived from\nthe variant. (c) of the two-period model presented in section III.3. It has been shown there\nthat in the case of unanticipated transitory shocks, the anticipation errors that occured\nin tbc time span since the beginning of an averaging period add noise to the interest\nratf' anel thus do harm to the quality of signal extraction. The longer the maintenance\npf'riod, the stronger this effect should become.23 The beginning of a maintenance period\nis always a phase of a special purity of the interest rate signal: first, there is a relatively\nlong time horizon for averaging, and second there is no noise ballast resulting from former\nunanticipateel transitory shocks. It is thus in a certain sense advantageous to have frequent\nheginnings of maintenance periods. The optimallength of a maintenance period could be\ncalculated in the framework of a modellike the one presented in section III.2 generalized\nto n periods anel to both anticipat.ed and unanticipated transitory shocks.\nAnother question is whether an averaging fee or a limitation of the banks' balances is\npreferable if one wishes any restrictions to the averaging activity. With an averaging\nfee, all pairs of transitory shocks (Yl,Y2) = (Yl'Yl +e) with e > A(d +b) are mapped\ninto the same interest rate. With a limitation to reserve balances, this is in a certain\nway reversed: if the difference hetween both transitory shocks is relatively small, all\npairs of shocks are mapped into the same interest rate, namely all pairs (Yl, Yl + e) with\nsimilarities with those of the lengthening of the maintenance period. The carry-over reduces the variance\non t.he last days of the maintenance periods, but this variance may at least partlally show up in the next\nperiod. The existence of a carry-over provision in the PS has to be considered in relation t.o the length of\nt.he mailltenance period of only two weeks. An argument for the German solution of a longer averaging\nperiod (olle month) without the possibility of carrying over balances may be that it is somehow simpler.\nWe do not intend to review the arguments for and against carry-over provisions in more detail here.\naveraging.\n-Smax/2 < e < Smax/2. We can conclude that, roughly speaking, with a fee, the large\ntransitory shocks are better smoothed away than the weak ones, and with a limit to the\nreserve balance the weak transitory shocks are better smoothed away than the large ones\n(but we should keep in mind that weak transitory shocks are more frequent than large\nones). Beyond those considerations, the following two arguments speak in favor of an\naveraging fee:\n\u00b7 The fee A is a source of income for the central bank. If all other welfare effects of\nthe fee are similar to those of a corresponding balance maximum, then the fee is\npreferable because in general, the marginal welfare cost of public income generated\nby taxes is positive.\n\u00b7 If a fee is imposed, it is irrelevant how the information about transitory shocks\nis spread among different banks. Even if only some few banks are informed, the\namelioration of informational efficiency will be as good as if the whole banking\nsedor had this information. If the balances are limited, this is not the case: the\nfewer banks are informed, the smaller the balancing capacity iso The assumptions\nthat the dispersion of information varies from transitory shock to transitory shock\nand that in most cases only a minority of banks are informed seems realistic. Then\nthe signal extraction problem becomes relevant for the whole banking sector, too,\nand the dispersed knowledge about a variety of transitory shocks not only has to\nbe transmitted to other sectors of the economy, hut also has to be aggregated (and\nrevealed) in the banking sedor itself. The theory of aggregation of various pieces\nof dispersed information into one price is another topic in the theory of information\nThe argument may be expanded to the case in which it is costly for banks t.o become\ninformed about transitory shocks. In the case of a fee, only a few banks have to invest.\nin the production of the relevant information. In the case of a balance limitation,\nthc quantity of resomces spent for information production would have to be larger\nto attain the same degree of informational efficiency because more banks have to\nbecome informed to provide a certain volume of balances.\nAn advantage of a balance limitation may be that with such an arrangement the centra]\nbank can always implement any interest rate path if it sufficiently varies the reserve supply\nin the course of the averaging period.\nWhat can be said about the interactions of a corridor with an averaging fee amI with\na limitation of the reserve balance? In the case of a combination of a. corridor with\n\na limitation of the reserve balance, from a certain narrowness of the corridor on, the\nmaximum balances will never be attained, so that they are irrelevant and redundant. In\nthe case of a combination of a corridor with an averaging fee, there will never be any\naveraging activity if the fee has a certain size relative to the width of the corridor. As\nin both cases, a money market with identical properties can be constructed with simpler\nrules, both cases should be avoided.\nThe systems in use in the US and Germany work with a balance limitation (corresponding\nto the volume of required reserves). In Germany, this limit is never used up by the banking\nsector as an aggregate. This could be interpreted as showing that there is no effective\nlimitation to balancing in Germany. But that interpretation is not necessarily correct if\none agrees that the ex ante information on shocks is not always widely spread among\nbanks. The informed banks may have used up their balance while others do not use\ntheir balances at all because they do not have the relevant knowledge for averaging. The\ninformation content of the interest rate then could not reach the qua1ity it would have\nwith unlimited averaging.\n\nV. Conclusions\nIn this paper, the contributions of reserve requirements to the stabilization of financial\nmarkets and economic activity were analyzed, stressing the role played by incomplete\ninformation. If one agrees that in a world of perfect information, money is a neutral veil,\nit becomes doubtful whether a theory of money which does not rely on the economics of\ninformation can bc helpful. In thc theory of economic policy, this view has generally been\naccepted since the introduction of the theory of rational expectations. In the theory of\nmonetary order, it is also not new, but in many approaches, the underlying informational\nproblems are still rather implicit. Especially section IV of the paper contributed to a more\nbasic incomplete information foundation of one aspect of reserve requirements, namely\naveraging prOVISIons.\nAltogether, four functions of minimum reserve requirements were analyzed m varymg\ndegrees of depth in this paper:\n1. Areserve requirement contributes to the structural demand for central bank money.\nThis may be of interest to guarantee the existence of any demand for central bank money\n01' to roughly neutralize a strong decline in the natural demand for it (section II.1). As\nimportant technological innovations have to be expected in the near future in the use\nof money as a means of pa,yment by non-banks and in the area of payment systems,\nthis function of reserve requirements could become relevant. Therefore, even if the re\nserve requirements are reduced for other reasons to zero for some while, the instrument\nshould be preserved such that it could be reactivated any time. This would contribute\nto the confidence of economic agents into the capacity of the central bank to determine\nin all eventualities the scarcity of central bank money and thus to control indirectly its\npurchasing power.\n2. Areserve requirement. is in a cert.ain wa,y also a t.ax on bank deposit,s and thus has to\nbe analyzed from t.he point of view of t.he t.heory of opt.imal taxation (section 11.2). The\nhigh degree of int.ernational mobilit.y of some of the banks' liabilities subject t.o reserve\nrequirements speaks in favor of a harmonization of the concerned reserve ratios in the\nregion of high mobility of capital. In the case of such a harmonizat.ion, it would be much\nmore difficult to argue t.hat the marginal welfare losses of areserve requirement 'tax' are\nhigher than those of other taxes generating public income. If harmonization were not\npossible, one could also think about remunerating reserves to reduce or eliminate any\ntaxation aspect and t.hus any related distortion.\n3. The incompleteness of the remuneration of required reserves should influence in the real\nworld (where information is dispersed) in an idiosyncratic way macroeconomic stability\nand the variability of GDP around its natural (or goal) value (section III). On the other\nhand, it should be very difficult to estimate the corresponding optimal reserve ratios.\nMoreover, it is not dear at all apriori that a small reserve requirement should be better\nthat none. Finally, the stabilization impact of a small reserve requirement (due to that\nfunction) like the one currently in effect in Germany is likely to be weak anyway.\n4. If minimum reserves only have to be fulfilled on average over a certain maintenance\nperiod) banks can smooth away anticipated transitory money market shocks and thereby\nraise the information content of money market rates concerning their permanent compo\nnent. For this function, it is not relevant (on an abstract) model-theoreticallevel) whether\nrequired reserves are remunerated or not, and, as the capacity of banks to build up tem\nporarily reserve balances is not necessarily tied to the size of areserve requirement, it is\nalso irreleva.nt how large the reserve requirement is (section IV). This positive informa\ntional impact seemed to be relatively robust, such that one is tempted to conclude that\nan averaging option granted for aperiod that is not too long should be advantageous for\ninformational flows and financial stability under the circumstances of the US or German\nmoney market, despite the fact that it seems difficult to derive empirically an optimal ave\nraging system (in the sense of estimating a money market model and using the estimated\nparameters in some optimality conditions derived theoretically).\nIn Germany (and many other countries), the four functions have up to now been im\nplemented together in the form of an unremunerated minimum reserve requirement with\naveraging. However, it has been argued here that the functions may be at least split into\nthree groups that can be implemented independently. Only the functions 2 and 3 cannot\nbe analyzed and implemented independently.\nCertainly, many issues remain to be solved. To mention only a few: (1) It should be\npossible to integrate both stabilization arguments (the arguments of section 111 and IV)\nin the framework of one model. (2) The model of section IV could be enriched by the\nintroduction of areaction function of the central bank (taking into consideration the\nincomplete information the central bank has about the permanent component of the\ninterest rate). The interest rate would change its time series properties but the structure\nof the signal extraction problem would in principle remain. A more general formulation\nof the transitory and permanent shocks and of the time structure of the model would be\nnecessary. (3) Is it possible to analyze in a marginalistic framework the question of the\noptimal length of the averaging period and of the restrietions to averaging in the form of\n\nlimitations to reserve baJances and averaging fees and would it be possible to implement\nthis model empirically,?z4 (4) Is it possible to work out more precisely the nature of the\npositive externality of liquidity cushions of banks operating on the money market which\nwas assumed to be the ultimate source of the benefits of averaging provisions'?\nIt should be a general task of future research to further develop the idea that the theories\nof monetary order and of monetary policy are interrelated and should always be based on\nan analysis of a situation of strategie interaetion of eeonomic subjects with some explieitly\ndefined informational ineompleteness and asymmetry.\n24Hamilton [1996] shows that it is possible to analyze empirically even relatively complicated institu\ntional details of the money market..\nAppendix 1: The basic least square signal extraction formula\nAppendix 1.1 One observation and n unobserved shocks\nLet i* be the observed variable and assurne that it is known that\nwhere cl = (0'0, a}, ...an ) is a vector of known coefficients, X =(xo, Xl> X2, ... , Xn)' is a vec\ntor of random variables, Xo 1 (deterministic) and for j l...n E(xj) 0, Var(xj) = a]\nand C'ov(Xj, xd = 0, Vj =f l.

The\nproblem can be simplified by defining: z i* - ao and thus: z Ax. We are looking for\na vector \u00df ERn! satisfying: \u00df = argmin(E(Xk - Xk)2) with Xk = \u00df'z.

If (Yl - Y2) ~ 2Smax, then al = a - Smax and thus:\nSmax - M + x + Yl)\nWe shall define h as the random variable corresponding to this random variable\nir.\n3. If (YI - Y2) :::; -2Sman then al a + Smax and thus:\n+ Smax - M+ x + Yl)\nWe shall define h as the random variable corresponding to thiB random variable it.\nThe information content of the money market rate after the first auction can be calculated\nas follows as a function of Smax. To calculate the density function J(ii), one can sum up\nthe three density function J(jl), J(h)' J(j3) while assuring by the choice of the limits\nof the integrals in the calculation of the marginal densities that the (Yl - Y2) are in the\n25A remark cOllcerning the notation \"fu(v)\" ofthe density fUllctions: The variable in the index is the\none determining the density function. The variable in the bracket is the one which is mapped into a\nprobability. If both are identical, the variable in the index can be omited.\n\nThe value of the realization of xis never relevant for the probability of being in one of the\nthree eases. Thus, the impact of the transitory shoeks on the interest rate ean be analyzed\nin a first step independently of x. If x is set to be eonstant, then ij (respeetively jll j2, h)\nis only a function of the two transitory shocks Yl, Y2. In the following, let x O. Then\nthe relationship between jl,Yt,Y2 is: jl = (a - NI +(Yl +Y2)/2)/(d +b). Whenever this\nequation is fulfilled, then fUI ,Yl ,Y2} = fUI ,Y2b else f(jl ,Y11Y2) = O. Let us define q(j, Yt, Y2) as\na functioll equal to one if the equation is fulfilled and equal to zero if it is not. The first\nterm of f(ii) then ean be written as follows:\nThe inner integral in this expression can only have either the value one or the value zero.\nIt is one if 2( (d +b)jl a.\n+AI Jh/2) E [Yl - 2Smax,Yl +2Smax]. But then, we ean omit\nthis integral if we make sure that we integrate only over the va1ues of Yl for whieh this\ncondition is fulfilled. Thus:\nYl - 2Smax < 2((d +b)jl - Cl +NI - Yd2) < Yl +28max\nWe shall designate the lower bound as Ql and the upper bound as Q2. Then, the first\nterm of f(\nin ean be written as follows:\nConcerning the seeond term of fUn: Y2 does not appear in the equation defining h.\nThus, Y2 is statistieally independent of the other random variables and the term ean also\nbe writtell as folIows:\nBut the density feh.lI,) contains a linear interdependenee, namelY:)1 (a Smax NI +\nYd/(d +b). Thus, the second term of f(ii) ean be transformed similarly to the first one:\nThe restriction on one unique value of Yl E [-00, +00] ean be expressed by omitting the\nexteriorintegral amI by substituting Yl in the limits of the inner integral by the linear\n\nrelationship in ir. Let R1\n= (d +b)ir - a +Smax +M - 2Smax (d +b)ii a - Smax +M.\nThen the second term of f(in finally becomes:\nAfter similar transformations, one can express the third term of fU;) as:\n= (d + b)ii a - Smax +\u00c4l +2Smax (d +b)ii - a + Smax +M. Finally, the\ndensity f(ii ,x=O) can be summarized as follows:\nIn the two following figures, the specific example a\n0..5; b = 0.5 with normally distributed shocks is illustrated. In the figure on the left, density\nfunctions of the interest rate are plotted for various values of Smax under the assumption\nthat.1: O. The values Smax considered are 0 (corresponding to the case without any\naveraging); 0.2; 0.5; 1; 3; 20 (corresponds practically to the case of unlimited averaging).\nThe variance of the interest rate caused by the transitory shocks can be chosen precisely\nin t.he range given by the two extreme arrangements of none and unlimited averaging.\nThe variance of ii under the assumption of a constant x is drawn as a function of Smax\nin rhe fignre on the right side:\nfUi)\n\"*\n~ow,\n;J;\n<:an be reintroduced into the analysis. The observed interest rate is a linear\nfunction in the random variable x and in a random variable which is composed from Yl\nand Y2, depending on Sma.x. We shall designate the random variable composed from the\ntwo transitory shocks as z. Then, the expected squared error in estimating x when one\nobserves ii is:\n\nIn the specific exarnple (with 0'; 1), we obtain:\nz z\nAppendix 2.2: The information content of the money market rate with an\naveraging fee in variant (a) of the money market model\nSimilarly to the case of a limitation to the reserve balance, in the case of an averaging fee\nA, three situations have to be distinguished:\n1. If without any intertemporal arbitrage of the banks, the condition IE(i2 ) - E(idl :::;\nA {::} -A(d + b) :::; YI - Y2 :::; A(d + b) is fulfilled, then no arbitrage activity takes\nplace and the interest rate equation in the first auction is:\nd + b(a - M +x +Yd\nWe shall define)1 as the randorn variable corresponding to this randorn variable ii:.\n2. If without any intertemporal arbitrage activity E(i2) - E(i1 )\n> A {::} YI Y2 >\nA(d + b), then the banks will build up a refinancing balance SI > 0 such that:\nE(i2 ) - E(i1 ) = A. Then the interest rate equation in the first auction becornes:\nZl\n= d +b a - M +x + 2 +2\"\nWe shall define h as the random variable corresponding to this randorn variable ii:.\n:3. Jf without any intertemporal arbitrage activity (E(i2 ) - E(id) > A {::} YI - Y2\n<\n-A(d +b), then the banks will build up a refinancing balance SI < 0 in the first\nperiod, such that: -(E(i2 )\nE(id) A. In this case the interest rate equation in\nthe first auction becornes:\n-- a-M+x+ -\nWe shall define j3 as the random variable corresponding to this randorn variable i;:.\nTo calculate the density function J(\nin, we must once again surnmarize three different\ndensity functions while assuring by properly chosen limits of the integrals that (Yl - Y2)\nis always in the relevant range:\n+::0 lYd,\\(d+bl\n-IX\u00b7 Yl -'\\(dH)\n\n1Yl -'\\(d+b)\n+\nIf x is a constant, then ii becomes a linear function only in the two random variables Yl\nand Y2. The realization of the permanent shock is again irrelevant for the probabilities of\nthe three different cases, so that again, the stochastic influence of x can be neglected in a\nfirst step. Again, set x = O. Then the linear relationship between the variables j1, Yt, Y2\nis: 11 = (a - M + Yd/(d + b). The random variable Y2 does not appear in the equation\ndetermining j1. Thus Y2 is statistically independent of the other random variables and\nthe first term can also be written:\n\nlYl+'\\(d+b)\nl Y1 +'\\(d+b) \n\n\n\nThe density fUl,Yl) now still contains the linear relationship mentioned above. Let q(jll Yl)\nhf' a function which takes the value 1 if the relationship is fulfilled and zero if it is not.\nThen the first term may be written as follows:\njYl +,\\(d+b) jYl +,\\(d+b)\nfjl,Yl u;, Yd f(Y2)(Y2)dY2 dYl = q(i~, YdfJl (i;) f(Y2) (Y2)dY2dYl\n-= Yl -'\\(d+b) -00 Yl-'\\(d+b)\nBut this restriction by q on one unique value of Yl E] 00, oo[ can also be expressed by\nomitting the exterior integral and by substituting Yl in the limits of the inner integral\nby the linear relationship in ii. Define R1\n= (d + b)jl - a + M - >.(d + b) and R 2\n(d + b)jl a + M + >'(d + b). Then the first term of f(i';J can finally be written:\nIn the second term, the linear relationship between hand Yl, Y2 is (for x 0):\n}f;f + Yl + Y2) + ~\nWhenever this equation is fulfilled, f(h'Yl'YZ) = fUl,Yll' otherwise f(jl'Yl'YZ) = O. We shall\ndefine q(ii, Yt, Y2) as a function which takes the value one if the linear relationship holds\nand otherwise takes the va.lue zero. Then the second term of f(in can be written as\nfollows:\nBut the inner integral of this expression can only take the value one or the value zero. \n\nIt takes the value one if and only if 2((d + b)j2 a + M - x Yl/2 - (d + b)>'/2) E \n\n\nOO,Yl - >'(d + b)]. We can thus omit this integral if it is assured that the exterior\nintegral only integrates over values of YI for which the fo11owing relationship holds:\n2((d + b)i~ - a +1ft - Yd2 (d + b)>'j2) < YI - >'(d + b) {:} Yl > (d + h)i~ a M\nWe shall define this bound as VI' Then the second term can fina11y be written as:\nThe third term of !i.\n)\ncan be treated similarly to obtain:\nSumming up, the density function !(ii,x=O) can thus be written:\nIn the following figure on the left side, the density functions of ii are plotted in the\n= 0) and normally\ndistributed random variables for various values of the arbitrage fee >..
