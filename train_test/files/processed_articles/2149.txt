To explore the\neffect modification of obesity on the association between 25(OH)D and insulin resistance/type 2\ndiabetes, data were examined from a nationally representative sample.\nRESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdThe analytic sample for the type 2 diabetes\nanalysis (n = 12,900) was limited to participants from the National Health and Nutrition Exam-\nassigned to the morning session and free of diabetes were limited to the insulin resistance analysis\n(n = 5,806). Multiplicative interaction was assessed through a cross-product interaction term in a\nmultiple logistic regression model. The presence of additive interaction between insufficient\n25(OH)D and obesity (indicated by BMI or waist circumference) was evaluated by calculation of\nthe relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) and attributable proportion due to interaction (AP).\nRESULTSdThere wasnomultiplicativeinteraction of insufficient 25(OH)Dand obesity on type 2\ndiabetes or insulin resistance. Furthermore, none of the RERI or AP values were statistically\nsignificant in the diabetes analysis. However, there was strong additive interaction between\ninsulin resistance. In addition, 47% of the increased odds of insulin resistance can be explained\nCONCLUSIONSdWithin a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample, abdominal obe-\nsity and insufficient 25(OH)D interact to synergistically influence the risk of insulin resistance.\nRecent meta-analyses and systematic\nreviewstudiesindicatethathighserum\nconcentration may be associated with\nlower risk of insulin resistance and type\n2 diabetes (1\u00ad4). Vitamin D is thought to\nimpact type 2 diabetes through various\nmechanisms, including impaired pancre-\natic b-cell function and insulin resistance\n(5,6). Many of these pathways are biolog-\nically relevant to obesity as well, given that\nobesity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes\nAlthough the association between\n25(OH)D and insulin resistance is consis-\ntentlyobserved across multiplestudies,this\nassociation may vary by obesity status.\nSerum 25(OH)D concentration was not\nassociated with insulin sensitivity in obese\nCaucasian women either before bariatric\nsurgery or 10 years postsurgery (17). Obe-\nsity may modify the association between\n25(OH)D concentration and risk of type\n2 diabetes. It has been demonstrated that\nthe association between serum 25(OH)D\nconcentration and A1C was stronger in\nBritishadultsthathadahighBMIcompared\nwith adults that had a low BMI after full\ncovariate adjustment (15).\nBecause of decreased bioavailability of\nvitamin D due to excess storage in body fat\ncompartments, obesity may interact with\nvitamin D to synergistically influence risk of\ninsulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (18).\nHowever,thepossibleinteractionofvitamin\nD and obesity with regard to type 2 diabetes\nand insulin resistance has not been well\nstudied. In a recently published study, the\nassociation of serum 25(OH)D concentra-\ntion with insulin sensitivity was found to be\nstronger in overweight individuals than in\nnormal-weight individuals (19). Although\nsuggestive, this study was limited in that it\nfeatured a small sample of younger adults\nfrom a university campus with limited\nracial/ethnic groups. To further explore\nthe effect modification of obesity on the\nassociation between 25(OH)D and insulin\nresistance/type 2 diabetes, we examined\ndatafromtheNationalHealth and Nutrition\nExamination Survey (NHANES), a large,\nnationally representative sample from\nacross the U.S.\nMETHODSdNHANES are nationally\nrepresentative surveys conducted by the\nNational Center for Health Statistics\n(NCHS), part of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention.

The NCHS ethics\nreview board approved the survey, and\nparticipants provided informed consent\nprior to participation.\nData were analyzed from NHANES\nlimited to participants .20 years of age.\nSurvey questions that assess smoking be-\nhavior were only asked to participants .20\nyears of age. The unweighted response\nMEC-examined sample.\nSerum 25(OH)D concentration\nconcentration was measured using a radio-\nimmunoassay kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater,\nMN) (20). The coefficient of variation for\nwas between 10 and 13%, and the sensitiv-\nity for the assay was 1.5 ng/mL (21). Serum\n25(OH)D data files were updated in No-\nbecause NCHS has recommended that\nthe adjusted data rather than the previously\navailable, unadjusted data be used for all\nanalyses of serum 25(OH)D concentration\n25(OH)D concentration is generally\nunderstood to reflect total intake of vitamin\nD from cutaneous synthesis and dietary\nintake (23). The Institute of Medicine\nreleased a report in November 2010 on vi-\ntamin Dstatuscategorizingserum25(OH)D:\nrisk of deficiency, ,12 ng/mL; risk of inad-\nng/mL; and possible harm, .50 ng/mL\n(3). For multiple regression analysis, vita-\nmin D status will be reported as sufficient\nFew (;1%) participants are at risk for pos-\nsible harm due to high serum 25(OH)D\nconcentration.\nOutcomes\nCasedefinition oftype2 diabetes was based\non fulfillment of the American Diabetes\nAssociation criteria (24) for diabetes diag-\nnosis (fasting plasma glucose concentration\nmg/dL during an oral glucose tolerance\ntest, or A1C $6.5%) or an answer of\n\"yes\" to any of the following questions.\n1) Other than during pregnancy, have\nyou ever been told by a doctor or other\nhealth professional that you have diabe-\ntes or sugar diabetes? 2) Are you taking\ninsulin now? 3) Are you taking diabetes\npills to lower your blood glucose?\nInsulin resistance was estimated using\nthe homeostatic model assessment for in-\nsulin resistance (HOMA-IR) by the following\nformula: (fasting serum insulin [mU/mL] 3\nfasting plasma glucose [mg/dL])/405\n(25). HOMA-IR correlates well with data\nusing the hyperglycemic clamp technique\n(25,26), which is recognized to be the gold\nstandard for measuring insulin resistance.\nInsulin sensitivity has been defined by the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) as\nvalues below the highest quartile of the\nHOMA-IR index, as measured in subjects\nwithout diabetes (27). For this analysis,\nsubjects in the highest quartile will be\ncategorized as insulin resistant.\nA fasting blood glucose test was per-\nformed on eligible participants who were\nexamined in the morning session after a 9-h\nfast. Since an oral glucose tolerance test was\nadded to the laboratory protocol in\nvalues (after a dose of 75 g of glucose)\nwill be included in this analysis. Plasma\nglucose was measured using an enzyme\nmethod. There were changes to the equip-\nment and laboratory from NHANES\nglucose and insulin measurements were\nperformed by the Fairview Medical Center\nLaboratory at the University of Minnesota\n(Minneapolis, MN), and for NHANES\nments were performed by the Diabetes Di-\nagnostic Laboratory at the University of\nMissouri (Columbia, MO). Insulin was\nmeasured using the Tosoh AIA-PACK\nIRI immunoenzymometric assay in\nInsulin ELISA immunoassay in NHANES\ntained using a high-performance liquid\nchromatography system. The Boronate\nAffinity high-performance liquid chro-\nmatography system determines total\nglycohemoglobin by measuring the 1,2-cis\ndiol group found in A1C.\nCovariates\nAge, race/ethnicity, sex, education, season\nof examination, physical activity, and\nsmoking were obtained by self-report. Sea-\nson was assigned as winter if the period of\nexamination was between 1 November and\n30 April or summer if between 1 May and\n31 October. The average level of physical\nactivity was reported on a scale of 1\u00ad4 (least\nvigorous to most vigorous). Participants\nwere asked whether they had smoked at\nleast 100 cigarettes in their entire life to clas-\nsify their smoking status. Those who an-\nswered \"yes\" were asked whether they\nnow smoke cigarettes every day, some\ndays, or not at all. Current smokers were\nthose who had smoked at least 100 ciga-\nrettes during their lifetime and, at the time\nof the interview, reported smoking either\nevery day or some days. Former smokers\nwere those who reported smoking at least\n100 cigarettes during their lifetime but cur-\nrently did not smoke. Never smokers were\nthose who reported never having smoked\n100 cigarettes during their lifetime. Data on\nanthropometric measurements were ob-\ntained by health staff (28). BMI was calcu-\nlated from measured weight and height\naccording to a standardized protocol. For\nadults aged 20 years or older, normal\nweight was defined as a BMI of 18.5\u00ad\nBMI of 30.0 kg/m2 or higher. These defini-\ntions are consistent with those of the Na-\ntional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and\nthe WHO (29,30). For multiple regression\nanalysis, underweight adults will not be in-\ncluded because they comprise a small pro-\nportion of the sample (;2%). Waist\ncircumference (WC) may correlate better\nwith insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes\nbecause it is a better measure of body fat.\nAbdominal obesity was defined as WC\n(31). WC was measured at a point imme-\ndiately above the iliac crest on the midaxil-\nlary line at minimal respiration to the\nInclusion criteria\nA small number of participants (n = 900,\nviewed and examined in a MEC did not\nhave data on serum 25(OH)D concentra-\ntion.

The flowchart of the ex-\ncluded participants along with the reason is\nsummarized in Fig. 1.\nStatistical analysis\nSAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used\nfor all calculations and analyses. Given the\ncomplex, stratified, multistage probability\ncluster sampling structure used in the\nNHANES survey design, data were ana-\nlyzed using the SAS survey procedures.\nThese include weight, cluster, and strata\nstatements, which allow for the calculation\nof unbiased population-based estimates\nthat reflect the unequal probability of\nselection, nonresponse adjustment, and\nadjustment to independent population con-\nsample weights were used to produce\nstatistically reliable estimates, taking into\naccount the complex survey design.\nDifferences in continuous variables\nwere tested using a Student t test, and\ndifferences in categorical variables were\nassessed using a Pearson x2 test. The\nreported means, standard errors, and pro-\nportions take into account NHANES design\nmethodology. The association between\nor insufficient [,20 ng/mL]) and type 2 di-\nabetes or insulin resistance was determined\nusing multiple logistic regression. The re-\nsults were stratified by BMI (overweight\nand obese versus normal, obese versus nor-\nmal, or overweight versus normal) or WC\n(abdominally obese vs. not abdominally\nobese) and adjusted for age (continuous),\nsex (male or female), race/ethnicity (non-\nHispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexi-\ncan American, or other), education level\n(lessthanhighschool,high schooldiploma,\nor some college education), seasonofexam-\nination (winter or summer), physical\nactivity (continuous), and smoking status\n(never smoker, former smoker, or current\nsmoker). Furthermore, the reference group\nin all models was sufficient 25(OH)D\ninally obese (WC ,102 cm for men and\n,88 cm for women). A cross-product in-\nteraction term was included in the logistic\nregression model to assess multiplicative\ninteraction. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95%\nCIs were calculated using the contrast\nstatement in SAS 9.2. Variance was calcu-\nlated using the Taylor series linearization\nmethod, which leads to an asymptotically\nunbiased estimate.\nThe expected interaction on the multi-\nplicative and additive scale was also calcu-\nlated. It has been argued that interaction on\nthe additive scale better reflects biologic\ninteraction (33). To assess additive interac-\ntion, the relative excess risk due to interac-\ntion(RERI) and attributable proportiondue\nto interaction (AP) were calculated (34).

The stronger interaction\nof 25(OH)D with obesity in regard to in-\nsulin resistance as compared with diabetes\nmay be related to the direct impact of\nvitamin D deficiency on insulin resistance.\nAnimal and in vitro studies provide\nevidence that vitamin D indirectly im-\npacts diabetes through insulin resistance,\nwhich may explain the weaker additive\ninteraction (4).\nWe believe that our results are biolog-\nically plausible. Evidence for deposition of\nfat-soluble vitamin D in adipose tissues\n(14,18) may explain the joint effect of vita-\nmin D insufficiency and obesity on increas-\ning risk of insulin resistance. Abdominal\nobesity is more highly correlated with the\npresence of adipose tissue than general\nobesity, which provides a rationale for the\ndifferences in additive interaction. The\nstorage of vitamin D in fat tissues can result\nin lower vitamin D bioavailability for influ-\nencingpancreaticb-cell function oractivat-\ning vitamin D receptors, thereby increasing\nthe risk of adverse glycemic outcomes (5).\nIn addition, the presence of a vitamin D\nresponse element in the insulin gene pro-\nmoter is another potential mechanism for\nthe observed interaction (35).\nAlthough our study features a large,\nnationally representative sample that en-\nhances generalizability, a limitation of this\nstudy is its cross-sectional nature. Informa-\ntion on vitamin D, obesity, insulin resis-\ntance, and diabetes was collected at the\nsame point in time, so temporality is not\nassured. However, cohort studies with\nlongitudinal follow-up have shown that\nobesity is a risk factor for low 25(OH)D\nconcentration (16) and insulin resistance/\ndiabetes (1,2,4), which supports a tempo-\nral link for the observed interaction. Al-\nthough not adjusting for geographic\nregion may be a potential limitation in\nthis study, because data are collected in\nthe south during the winter and north dur-\ning the summer, adjustment for season\nwould also take into account some of the\ngeographic variation. On a separate note,\nuse of the OR may overestimate the risk\nratio when assessing additive interaction\nfor an outcome as common as type 2 di-\nabetes. But a simulation study has shown\nthat AP is the most robust to direct substi-\ntution of the OR for risk ratio (36). Finally,\na sensitivity analysis was conducted with\nundiagnosed cases so that participants\nwho were under treatment with pharma-\ncological agents (insulin or oral antidia-\nbetes pills) and physician-diagnosed cases\nof diabetes were excluded, but the overall\nresults were similar.\nThe results of this study are consistent\nwith those reported by two other studies.\nHypp\u00f6nen and Power (15) found that\namong obese participants, there was a\nstronger association between serum\n25(OH)D concentration and A1C com-\npared with normal-weight patients. Ou\net al. (19) reported a stronger association\nbetween serum 25(OH)D concentration\nand insulin sensitivity in overweight indi-\nviduals compared with normal-weight indi-\nviduals. However, it is difficult to generalize\nthe results of Ou et al. due to the limited age\nrange and racial diversity and the fact that\nthe participants in the study were not obese.\nFurthermore, Ou et al. defined obesity with\ndifferent cut points than what is conven-\ntionally accepted. In contrast, the current\nstudy used standard definitions of weight\ncategories (using both BMI and WC cut\npoints) (30,31), vitamin D status based on\nserum 25(OH)D concentration (3), insulin\nresistance (27), and type 2 diabetes diag-\nnosis (24) based on laboratory reports.\nAlthough our study is a cross-sectional\nobservational study, we believe that our\nresults have large public health significance.\nIn fully adjusted models, we estimated that\n47% of the cases of insulin resistance can be\nexplained by interaction between low\n25(OH)D and high BMI. This statistical\nevidence supports the notion that the\nburden of insulin resistance in obese in-\ndividuals may be reduced by making\nimprovements in serum 25(OH)D concen-\ntration. Given the difficulty in management\nof overweight or obese status in certain\nindividuals (37), recommendations to im-\nprove vitamin D status may be an inexpen-\nsive and practical means of reducing the\nburden of diabetes. Indeed, it was found\nin a meta-analysis that vitamin D supple-\nmentation reduced the risk of type 2 diabe-\ntes (2) and improved insulin resistance\n(38,39) to a small extent. Future random-\nized, controlled trials should focus on the\nimpact of vitamin D supplementation\namong obese individuals. If results are pos-\nitive, vitamin D may be an avenue for obese\nindividualstoimproveglucosehomeostasis.\n"
