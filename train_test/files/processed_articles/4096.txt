Race/\nethnicity-based disparities in health care utilization for\nasthma are marked, with more frequent emergency\ndepartment (ED) visits or hospitalizations among\nAfrican American and Hispanic children compared to\nWhite children (Akinbami et al., 2011; Ginde, Espinola,\n& Camargo, 2008). Barriers to asthma control include\ninsufficient patient education (Holsey, Collins, &\nZahran, 2013; Oraka, Iqbal, Flanders, Brinker, & Garbe,\n2013), fragmented care and lack of coordination\nbetween clinic and community services (Butz, Kub,\nstressors (Koinis-Mitchell, Kopel, Salcedo, McCue, &\ncial burden (Patel, Brown, & Clark, 2013), and home\ntriggers such as tobacco smoke exposure, mold, pests,\ncoordination for asthma is one comprehensive strategy\nto address these barriers. Care coordination is\na client-centered, assessment-based interdiscipli-\nnary approach to integrating health care and social\nsupport services in which an individual's needs\nand preferences are assessed, a comprehensive care\nplan is developed, and services are managed and\nmonitored by a care coordinator following evi-\ndence-based standards of care. (Brown, 2009, p. 1)\nCare coordination engages multiple stakeholders, such\nas family members, health care providers, social ser-\nvices, schools, and community organizations\n(Bodenheimer, 2008). Care coordination has been\nshown to reduce asthma symptoms, unscheduled\nhealth care use, activity limitations, and school\nabsences, among other positive outcomes (Clark et al.,\nThe Merck Childhood Asthma Network Care\nCoordination Programs\nThe Merck Childhood Asthma Network (MCAN)\nCare Coordination Programs, Phases 1 and 2, aimed to\nreduce pediatric asthma morbidity in vulnerable popula-\ntions. In Phase 1, five sites implemented evidence-based\ninterventions (EBIs) to improve outcomes and explore\nthe factors that led to successful adoption of EBIs in\nurban settings (Viswanathan et al., 2011). These interven-\ntions yielded improvements in symptoms, hospital and\nED use, school absences, and caregiver confidence\nwork in Phase 1 focused on care coordination, in a sec-\nond phase, the four sites selected to continue empha-\nsized care coordination activities. Phase 2 sites are the\nschool-based Los Angeles Unified School District Asthma\nProgram (Los Angeles, California), the health system\u00ad\nbased Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Asthma Care\nNavigator Program (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), the\nFederally Qualified Health Center\u00adbased (FQHC) La Red\nde Asma Infantil de Puerto Rico (San Juan, Puerto Rico),\nand the community-based Addressing Asthma in\nEnglewood Project (Chicago, Illinois). Due to its care\ncoordination focus, the relative strength of its evidence\nbase, and its success with similar vulnerable popula-\ntions, all sites chose to adapt the EBI Yes We Can, a\nmedical-social model of care that deploys health workers\n(referred to as asthma care coordinators [ACCs] for the\npurposes of this article) to provide asthma education,\nlink families to health and social services, and facilitate\ncommunication between the patient and clinicians\nVariation across Phase 2 sites provides a unique\nopportunity to examine the strengths and challenges of\nimplementing asthma care coordination in different\ninstitutional and organizational settings. The effect set-\nting has on the manifestation of care coordination for\npediatric asthma has not been well documented in the\nliterature. The goal of this article is to use qualitative\nimplementation data to assess (1) the influence of these\nsettings on the structure of care coordination activities,\n(2) the strengths of implementing care coordination for\nasthma in a given setting, and (3) the primary chal-\nlenges that arise. This investigation contributes to the\nknowledge base on effective models of asthma care\ncoordination across a range of settings, and findings can\nbe used to inform program planning, reimbursement or\nother funding decisions, and future research priorities.\n>\n>Method\nData Sources\nMembers of the University of Michigan cross-site\nevaluation team used multiple qualitative data sources\nin the analysis (Table 1): annual site report forms that\ntracked program components, reach, partnerships, and\nefforts to effect system and policy change; notes of key\ninformant interviews (verified by audio recordings) with\nprogram leaders and ACCs; minutes from quarterly con-\nference calls with sites; and site-completed surveys\nregarding their perspectives on the influence of the site's\nsetting on care coordination (there was a 100% response\nrate from the sites with respect to these data sources).\nAnalysis\nTo guide data collection and analysis, the cross-site\nevaluation used the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness,\nAdoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework\n(Glasgow, Vogt, & Boles, 1999) as well as the factors\naffecting implementation that were identified by Durlak\nand DuPre (2008), which include those related to set-\nting such as organizational capacity. While collecting\ndata from the sites over time, the researchers induc-\ntively uncovered the concept (which later became the\nstudy hypothesis) that the type of setting in which a\ncare coordination program takes place influences how\nit carries out key functions, representing a form of\ngrounded theory generated from the qualitative data\n(Patton, 2002). As a preliminary step, researchers read\nthrough notes and other data sources and constructed\nnarrative summaries identifying each site's program\nactivities and sequence. A leader from each MCAN site\nreviewed the summary for accuracy. Researchers then\ncompared the verified narrative summaries to identify\ncommonalities and differences across sites.\nNext, two members of the cross-site evaluation team\nconducted an inductive theme analysis (Patton, 2002),\nbased on a review of sources listed in Table 1 (with the\nexception of the Settings Survey), to identify strengths\nand challenges associated with the care coordination\nstructure in each of the four sites. The researchers used\na priori definitions of strengths (i.e., things inherent in\na particular structure/setting that facilitated delivery of\ncare coordination services) and challenges (things\ninherent in a structure/setting that hindered services).\nNext, strengths/challenges were categorized by dimen-\nsions of the care coordination process that emerged\nfrom the analysis. Consensus meetings were held with\na third researcher to reach agreement regarding both the\nstrengths/challenges and the categorization scheme. As\na preliminary step for validating these categories (Miles\nMCAN Asthma Care Coordination Programs Cross-Site Evaluation Data Sources\nSource Data Collected Time Collected\nAnnual cross-site\nreporting forms\nSite reported detailed descriptions of the following Annually\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Policy and systems change efforts undertaken by site to sustain\nchanges in care coordination, including stage of progress,\ncontextual factors that facilitate and hinder progress, and site-\ndetermined priority of each effort\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Care coordination components of each site, including priority\npopulation, reach, and how components relate to each other\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Partners involved in each program: role, level of involvement,\nand aspect of care coordination to which each partner is most\ncritical\nKey informant\ninterviews\nProgram leadership and ACC perspectives on the essential elements\nof the program, facilitating and inhibiting factors related to\nimplementation, and fidelity monitoring; at least two individuals\nin leadership roles and one ACC were interviewed at each site\nCross-site\nevaluation\nconference calls\nEnrollment numbers, successes and challenges reported by the sites,\nand notes of the ensuing discussion among sites, evaluators, and\nfunders\nQuarterly\nSettings survey Site leaders' perspectives on how their settings influence care\ncoordination\nNOTE: MCAN = Merck Childhood Asthma Network; ACC = asthma care coordination.\n& Huberman, 1994), we asked site leaders to complete a\nbrief, open-ended survey on the categories and collect\nany further relevant site perspectives on the topic. Their\nresponses confirmed the categorization, and a few new\nperspectives were added to the initial findings. As a\nfinal verification step, the researchers sought informant\nfeedback (Miles & Huberman, 1994) by presenting pre-\nliminary analysis results in table format to MCAN site\nleaders and making changes as needed.\n>\n>Results\nCare Coordination Activities Common to All Sites\nAs an initial step in examining how setting influ-\nenced the structure of care coordination, an analysis of\nnarrative summaries was conducted to determine the\nsimilarities and differences in care coordination activi-\nties. The comparison revealed a common set of activities\nacross sites, including asthma education, a home assess-\nment, and follow-up calls or visits (Table 2). The\nsequence varies from site to site, and each program\nallows for flexibility in their care pathway; for example,\nan ACC may make additional calls between home visits\nto a high-need family.\nDefining \"Settings\"\nWhile analyzing the narrative summaries, it became\nclear that the functional relationships of the lead\nimplementing unit (LIU) to key partners needed to be\naccounted for in the definition of \"settings.\" For this\nObserved Care Coordination Activities Common Across All MCAN Sites\nResponsibility of Asthma Care Coordinator Description\nEnroll children into program Intake and consent forms completed with children referred into the\nprogram or identified through institutional data sources\nAssess asthma symptoms, medications, and\nhealth care utilization\nInformation collected on measures of asthma symptoms,\nmedications, health care utilization, and asthma triggers,\ncompleted in clinic, home, or community setting\nDeliver asthma education to children and\nfamilies\nEducation provided on asthma triggers, symptoms, medications, the\nuse of equipment (e.g., peak flow meters and spacers), and asthma\naction plans\nConduct home environmental assessment A home assessment conducted to identify asthma triggers; education\nand supplies provided to remediate the triggers\nCommunicate with the clinical care team Information exchanged between ACCs and clinical providers\nthrough a variety of modes depending on the level of infrastructure\nand access available at each care providing institution; timing and\nfrequency of communication vary by setting and patient\nConduct follow-up visits or telephone calls Follow-up phone calls and/or other face-to-face visits conducted to\nmonitor the child's asthma control, reinforce asthma education,\nreview results from possible clinic visits, and check-in on efforts to\nremediate environmental triggers\nRefer families to medical or social services Participants linked to medical or social services and resources by\nACCs as needed: for example, insurance providers, smoking\ncessation counseling, and mental health services\nClose out case and recommend follow-up\nwith provider\nAfter the final follow-up visit has concluded, 12 months after\nenrollment, recommendations made regarding follow-up with\nhealth care providers, and the child's case with program is closed\nNOTE: MCAN = Merck Childhood Asthma Network; ACC = asthma care coordination.\nanalysis, LIU was defined as the group of individuals\nleading the design and implementation of the program.\nIn all four sites, each LIU consists of a project director,\nmanager, and the ACCs, all employed by the institution\nthat is the fiduciary of the grant. Two types of partners\nplayed a critical role in how care coordination is struc-\ntured: those that (1) provide access to the priority\npopulation and (2) provide clinical services to program\nparticipants. The ability of the LIU to identify partici-\npants, exchange information about participants, and\nintegrate ACCs into clinical practice hinges on the sup-\nport of these partners. Table 3 describes each site's LIU,\npriority population, as well as the LIU's relationship to\npartners for access and clinical care.\nTwo broad categories emerged in how setting, as\ndefined above, influences care coordination: (1) identifi-\ncation of participants and (2) the integration of ACCs with\nthe clinical care team. Substantial differences in these\ntwo categories exist across sites. The strengths and chal-\nlenges observed in each setting, according to these catego-\nries, are described below and summarized in Table 4.\nIdentification of Participants\nLos Angeles: School-Based Participant Identifica-\ntion.Enrollees are children with poor asthma control\nwho reside in Los Angeles Unified School District bound-\naries. The ACCs are school nurses who specialize in\nasthma. They receive referrals from the district's nearly\n500 school nurses and school administrators, teachers,\nattendance counselors, parents, and clinicians at the part-\nner clinics, including a mobile asthma van program\n(Breathmobiles). Each ACC works with the Los Angeles\nUnified School District's nurses in a defined geographic\nregion. The program provides comprehensive training for\nschool nurses, which includes assessment of asthma con-\ntrol, and school nurses use a standardized process to refer\nstudents with poor control to the program.\nCharacteristics of participating MCAN Asthma Care Coordination Programs\nSite\nLead Implementing\nUnit Priority Population\nKey Access Partner--\nProvides Access to the\nPriority Population\nKey Clinical Partner--\nProvides Clinical\nServices to Participants\nLos Angeles Los Angeles Unified\nSchool District\nDivision of Student\nand Health and\nHuman Services\nStudents of Los\nAngeles Unified\nSchool District\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 The Los Angeles\nUnified School District,\nSchool Nursesa\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 LA County & USC\nBreathmobile Clinic\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 School-based health\nclinics community\nclinics\nPhiladelphia The Community\nAsthma Prevention\nProgram, Children's\nHospital of\nPhiladelphia\nPatients of Children's\nHospital of\nPhiladelphia's inner\ncity primary care\npractices\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Primary Care Centers\n(physicians and staff;\nED and inpatient\nrecords)a\n\u00b7\n\u00b7 Primary Care\nCenters (physicians\nand staff;

For many low-income\nfamilies, schools are a primary connection with health\nand social services; therefore they are often receptive to\nprogram services. A program is able to reach students\nat school, in a safe and convenient environment, and\nstudents with poor asthma control can be identified\nbased on staff observation, attendance records, and\nacademic performance. However, while an ACC can\neasily reach students, reaching parents can be more dif-\nficult, and the program requires parental consent and\nparticipation. ACCs thus may educate students and\nparents in separate appointments (e.g., one at school,\none at home).\nPhiladelphia: Health System\u00adBased Participant Identi-\nfication.The program in the Children's Hospital of\nPhiladelphia's system identifies high-risk patients\nthrough review of asthma inpatient and ED report and\nelectronic medical records (EMRs) of children seen in\nprimary care centers, and physician referrals.\nEMR access is a significant advantage of working\nfrom within the health system. The combination of\nusing EMR data to identify eligible participants and\nthe recruitment efforts of ACCs, who are, importantly,\nstaff members within the primary care clinic of poten-\ntial participants, is particularly advantageous. In con-\ntrast to programs that rely on primary care provider\n(PCP) records or referrals, the Children's Hospital of\nPhiladelphia's program is able to identify serious\ncases that might otherwise go unnoticed if the family\ndoes not schedule a follow-up visit with their PCP\nafter an ED visit or hospitalization. Additionally,\naccess to EMRs allows the program to easily identify\nthose who meet enrollment criteria. While participa-\ntion is restricted to patients in the health system, the\nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia's reach in the\narea is extensive. Furthermore, the model is replicable\nand will likely appeal to future Accountable Care\nOrganizations.\nSan Juan: Clinic-Based Participant Identification. In San\nJuan, program success depends on the partnership\nbetween the researchers and HealthproMed administra-\ntion and clinicians, and their capacity to partner with\nlocal community leaders and agencies for outreach and\nrecruitment. Project staff identifies eligible children by\nscreening potentially eligible families in the clinic's wait-\ning rooms. These efforts are supplemented by outreach\nstrategies in collaboration with HealthproMed's Commu-\nnity Advisory Board and staff, who identify potential\npatients based on secondary claims data. Potential par-\nticipants are invited to the clinic in order to be screened\nand consented.\nBecause HealthproMed is the only FQHC in San\nJuan, the potential catchment area is geographically\nlarge. Access to claims data allows HealthproMed to\nidentify high ED and hospital users. Finally, children\ncoming in to the clinic with exacerbation of symptoms\nare a \"captive\" population that is likely to be eligible.\nHowever, only clinic patients can be screened and\nenrolled in the program.\nChicago: Community-Based Participant Identifica-\ntion. The priority population in Chicago is a geographi-\ncally defined community on the south side. The ACC\nrecruits families at clinics and community events; par-\nticipants are also referred by physicians, schools, com-\nmunity-based organizations, and word of mouth. One\nbenefit of this approach is that Chicago is able to reach\na broad population within a specific community and is\nnot limited to the population of one institution. This\napproach also allows Chicago to reach children not\nactively engaged with health care through relationships\nwith community members and organizations. Unlike\nthe other programs that only enroll children with poorly\ncontrolled persistent asthma, the Chicago program also\nserves children with intermittent asthma, as (1) com-\nmunity leaders made clear that denying access to chil-\ndren with less severe diagnoses would not be acceptable\nto the community and (2) information about asthma\ncontrol is not always readily available or consistent\nacross the priority population.\nTo reach a geographically defined population, rather\nthan one served by an institution, demands a great deal\nof resources to nurture relationships with the diverse\nreferral sources needed to identify eligible children.\nAdditionally, demonstrating the program's value to\nmultiple organizations may be more challenging than\nwhen programs are embedded within a single institu-\ntion, where established feedback channels to internal\nreferral sources, such as school nurses and PCPs, dem-\nonstrate the program's positive impacts. However, by\ncreating and strengthening relationships with other\ncommunity organizations and institutions, Chicago\nwas able overcome these barriers and link families with\nother needed services in the community.\nIntegration of ACCs\nIntegration of ACCs into the clinical care team is the\nsecond major difference among care coordination sites.\n\"Integration\" represents the acceptance of the ACC role\nby the health care team, incorporation of ACC into the\nclinic's workflow when possible, communication\nbetween ACCs and health care providers, and sharing\nof resources with the ACC to facilitate care coordina-\ntion. Integration of the ACC is an essential element of\nMCAN's Care Coordination Programs. Care coordina-\ntion by the MCAN programs relies on the ACC to pro-\nvide the link between care delivered outside and inside\nof the health care office. Limited integration restricts\nthe level of coordination possible.\nLos Angeles: School-Based Integration.ACCs and other\nschool nurses communicate with each other through the\nelectronic student health record (e.g., with notes on the\ncompletion of program components, results of assess-\nments, supplies and medications provided, and prompts\nfor follow-up). However, due to the separation between\nthe school system and external health care providers,\nintegration with clinical providers is not standardized.\nStudents enrolled in Los Angeles' program receive care\nfrom the Breathmobile or their own private provider. The\nACCs provide updates to clinicians during the Breathmo-\nbile's visits to the participants' schools, and Breathmobile\nclinicians update ACCs on patient visits, health status,\nand requests for follow-up from the ACC. Breathmobile\nclinicians complete an asthma action plan (AAP) for each\nchild that is shared with the ACC. Formal meetings\nbetween the ACCs and the Breathmobile clinical team\noccur every 2 to 3 months in order to discuss program\ncoordination issues. For other providers, communication\nis not as regular or direct. For example, the ACCs ask par-\nents to deliver uncompleted AAPs to be filled out by the\nprovider. In both cases, sharing of protected personal\ninformation is limited by the Family Educational Rights\nand Privacy Act and the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act restrictions as well as the strength of\nrelationships between the program and clinicians.\nPhiladelphia: Health System\u00adBased Integration.Phil-\nadelphia, as a result of being embedded within the\nsame institution providing clinical services, has been\nable to more fully integrate ACCs into a team of health\ncare providers and to influence clinical encounters, for\nexample, physician adherence to national guidelines\nfor asthma diagnosis and management (National Heart,\nLung, and Blood Institute, 2007). To facilitate regular\nACC\u00adprovider information exchange, health system\npolicies were changed to allow ACCs to view EMR\nsnapshots and enter notes on asthma symptoms, envi-\nronmental findings from home visits, psychosocial bar-\nriers, and referrals to community services. Providers\ncan also send requests via the EMR for ACCs to encour-\nage a family to schedule follow-up visits. In addition,\nACCs attend clinical staff meetings to address difficult\ncases and other issues. This two-way information flow\nfacilitated the acceptance of ACCs as valued members\nof the clinical team. The initial barrier to smooth clini-\ncal integration of ACCs was their potential for inter-\nrupting clinic workflow, but they have learned optimal\ntimes to engage the family during clinical visits.\nSan Juan: Clinic-Based Integration. San Juan's program\nis composed of a partnership between a local research\ninstitution, local community leaders and agencies, and\nan FQHC. The ability to integrate ACCs depends on the\naccess and clinical collaboration provided by the FQHC\nand the practical constraints within a busy general\npediatric clinic. The first educational session generally\ntakes place in the clinic immediately following a visit.\nThe ACC works with the family to create an AAP, and\nthe AAP is later entered into a specially created tem-\nplate of the EMR for the PCP to confirm and discuss\nwith the family at the next encounter. By holding the\neducational session immediately following a clinical\nencounter, patients and caregivers come to the session\nengaged on the topic of the patient's health, and ACCs\nare able to reinforce or clarify points discussed between\nthe patient and the clinician. When it is not possible to\nschedule a clinical visit immediately prior to the first\neducational session, the ACCs work with clinic staff to\npromote communication among the family, clinician,\nand ACC. Additionally, ACCs communicate directly\nwith clinicians, including the clinic's social worker, to\naddress issues that emerge, and the educational session\nis documented in the patient's EMR.\nChicago: Community-Based Integration. Like San Juan,\nthe program in Chicago is led by an academic team with\na history of community-focused work. Due to the lack of\na central health care facility in Englewood, Chicago\ndeveloped partnerships with multiple providers. The\nlevels of infrastructure and support at each location\nvary, which requires flexibility of the ACCs with regard\nto implementation. While recruitment and education\nsometimes take place in the clinic, most activities are\nimplemented in participants' homes and over the tele-\nphone. As a result of not being fully embedded within\nthe institutions providing care, Chicago's program has\nlimited ability to exchange information with clinical\nstaff. ACCs encourage clinicians to give completed\nAAPs to the participants, but success varies by provider.\nACCs send the providers written notification of patient\nparticipation in the program and completion; this may\nserve as a prompt for the provider to continue commu-\nnication regarding management of the child's asthma.\n>\n>Discussion\nStrengths and challenges for the implementation of\ncare coordination programs are evident in the settings\nof the four MCAN sites. In addition to attributes inher-\nent in particular settings, a key consideration is the\nrelationship between the LIU and the key access and\nclinical partners. This relationship, including whether\nor not the LIU is embedded in the institutions provid-\ning access and clinical services, influences the pro-\ngram's reach and the extent to which ACCs are\nintegrated in a clinical care team.\nEach site employed unique strategies to identify eli-\ngible participants based on feasibility and acceptability\nfor key access partners. By leveraging the internal\nsources of information within the Children's Hospital of\nPhiladelphia, for example, Philadelphia has been able\nto identify cases through health care utilization data\nfound in EMRs. This approach has the potential to\nreach eligible individuals who are not using primary\ncare services. Similarly, Los Angeles uses internal\nrecords on school absences and nurse visits to identify\npotential enrollees. Those types of data sources were\nunavailable to Chicago due to limitations in infrastruc-\nture and privacy restrictions. Instead, Chicago relied on\ndirect contact with participants and referrals from clini-\ncians and community organizations. Clinician referrals\nengage patients who are already actively involved in\nmanaging their health; this may facilitate engagement\noverall, but the physician referral approach may miss\nthose who have barriers to accessing care. In the case of\nreferrals from trusted community organizations or\nschools, this approach lends credibility in vulnerable\ncommunities that have had negative experiences with\ninterventions led with minimal community input or\nreciprocity (Yancey, Ortega, & Kumanyika, 2006). In San\nJuan, in addition to recruiting directly from clinic wait-\ning rooms and clinician referrals, other outreach strate-\ngies and data sources were used to encourage patients\nto come to the clinic to be screened. A potential limita-\ntion of the recruitment taking place exclusively within\na given institution is the restriction of reach to the\npopulation served by that institution, whereas recruit-\nment through multiple channels expands reaches to a\nbroader population.\nIntegration with the care team can be limited for\nsites that do not offer clinical care directly through the\nlead implementing institution. For example, although\nChicago, Los Angeles, and San Juan have core clinical\npartners, they are limited by the access, support, and\nresources those providers are willing and able to grant\nan external entity. Philadelphia, in contrast, was able to\nintegrate clinical care components to a greater extent.\nThe program's position within the care-providing insti-\ntution, including the ACCs' status as employees of the\nChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia, facilitated the\nexchange of information between members of the clini-\ncal care team and ACCs. That is not to say that care\ncoordination programs cannot be led by institutions\noutside of the clinical setting. Indeed, coordination can\nbe greatly enhanced by the strength of the partnerships,\nthe level of integration with partnering clinics, and\nclinic-provided resources to the care coordination pro-\ngram. For example, in Puerto Rico, the strong partner-\nships and in-kind support of the program by the FHQC\nhave been essential for the successful implementation\nof the program and promotion of sustainability.\nAdditionally, the ability to integrate with the care team\nin an institution is not always a function of institu-\ntional policy; often the sense of mission and belief in\nthe initiative from key individuals responsible for the\nimplementation of care coordination components, such\nas clinicians, limit the level of integration achievable.\nA limitation of this study is that the strengths and\nchallenges described are limited to the perspectives of\nthe leaders and program coordinators at each site. While\nnot all of the findings described in this article may be\ngeneralizable to other similar settings (as resources,\ninfrastructure, and other contextual factors can vary\nboth across and within settings), this article describes\nkey factors that should be considered when developing\nor implementing care coordination initiatives. At the\ntime of this analysis, health outcome data were not yet\navailable, and the sustainability of these programs\nbeyond grant funding is yet to be determined.\nFurthermore, while it would have been beneficial to\nexamine issues such as recruitment efficiency and costs\nof implementing care coordination in different settings,\nthose data were not available from all of the MCAN sites.\n>\n>Conclusions\nThe purpose of this article was to explore the influence\nsetting has on care coordination for childhood asthma and\nto document the strengths and challenges inherent to each\nof four settings in which such work is likely to take place\n(school district, health care system, clinic, and commu-\nnity). While at a high level, care coordination across these\nsettings could be described as somewhat similar, factors\nsuch as the ability to use data sources, leverage infrastruc-\nture, readily communicate with health care providers, and\nintegrate new components of care into practice played a\nkey role in instituting improvements in coordinated care.\nThe analysis also uncovered the importance of the LIU's\norganizational relationships to partners providing access\nto participants and clinical care. Regardless of setting, suc-\ncessful program implementation requires considerable\nresources, time, and buy-in from key stakeholders. Future\nresearch is needed to examine how setting influences the\nfamily's level of engagement, the effects of different care\ncoordination models have on health and health care utili-\nzation, and, importantly, the characteristics of care coordi-\nnation models that facilitate or impede their sustainability.\nWhile these topics are critical in demonstrating to stake-\nholders the value of implementing and sustaining coordi-\nnated care, more translational research and development\nof standardized evaluation tools are needed to facilitate\nadoption and evaluation of evidence-based programs in\ndifferent settings.\nReferences\nAkinbami, L.
