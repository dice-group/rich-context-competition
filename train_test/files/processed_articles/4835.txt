    "abstract": "Abstract\nSexual violence against females is a public health problem. This descriptive cross-sectional study sought to determine the\nprevalence of sexual violence among out-of-school female adolescents in Lagos, Nigeria and examine the context in which\nit occurs. Three hundred and fifty adolescents, between the ages of 10 and 19 years, working in Sandgrouse market, Lagos,\nwere selected using cluster sampling. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Almost half\n(42.9%) of the respondents have had sexual intercourse, and median age at initiation was 17 years. Forced initiation was\nreported by 15.8%, and 36.3% reported that first intercourse was due to coercion. Among the sexually active, only 12.3%\nstated that \"it is what they desire.\" Majority of respondents (64.1%) believe that rape is common in their community, and\n18% of the sexually active have experienced rape. Out-of-school adolescents in this community are at risk of sexual violence.\nThe factors that make them vulnerable need to be addressed.\n",

Globally, one out of three women will experience\nsexual violence in their lifetime (World Health Organization\n[WHO], 2005). Sexual violence is any sexual act that is\nforced against someone's will. It includes coerced sex, sex-\nual abuse, rape, and attempted rape (WHO, 2002). Most\nrapes are committed by persons known to the victim and\nmost victims of sexual violence prefer not to report\nshort-term and long-term consequences on women's physi-\ncal and mental health (WHO, 2003). Rape carries a heavy\nsocial stigma sometimes resulting in rejection by families\ntudes often condone violence against women and stigmatize\nand blame the survivor. Many countries lack adequate health\nand counseling services for survivors and strong mechanisms\nfor protection and legal redress (CARE, 2010).\nAll types of sexual abuse involve victims who do not con-\nsent or who are unable to consent or refuse to allow the act.\nSexual abuse is a serious offense, yet discussion on the topic\nis often avoided and the type of sexual abuse that is rarely\ndiscussed is sexual exploitation of children and youth\n(Kevonne & Janine, 2007). One of the most startling aspects\nof these sex crimes is that many go unreported; therefore,\nrape and sexual assault prevalence is difficult to determine\nthat only 22.9% of respondents who had experienced rape\nreported the offense to the police (Alemika, 2013).\nIn the Nigerian criminal law, rape is defined as\nunlawful carnal knowledge of a woman or girl without her\nconsent or with her consent if the consent is obtained by force or\nby means of threat or intimidation of any kind, or by fear of\nharm or by means of false and fraudulent representation as to the\nDespite the existence of the laws, Amnesty international\n(2012) reported that \"rape and other forms of sexual violence\nagainst women and girls remains rife.\" The authorities con-\nsistently fail to prevent and address sexual violence.\nAdolescent girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual\nabuse. The WHO (2005) has reported that \"younger women,\nespecially those aged 15 to 19 years, are at higher risk of\nsexual violence by a partner in almost all settings\" (p. 8).\n1University of Lagos, Nigeria\nCorresponding Author:\nKofoworola Odeyemi, Department of Community Health, College of\nmedicine, University of Lagos, Lagos 01, Nigeria.\nEmail: kofoodeyemi@yahoo.com\nSexual Violence Among Out-of-School\nFemale Adolescents in Lagos, Nigeria\nKofoworola Odeyemi1, Tolulope Olufunlayo1,\nBabatunde Ogunnowo1, and Adebayo Onajole1\n Keywords\nadolescents, sexual violence, coercion, out of school\n2 SAGE Open\nOut-of-school adolescents are a highly vulnerable group.\nWhereas the National Population Commission (NPC;\nlence rate of experience of sexual violence among girls (ages\n15-19 years), a study conducted among out-of-school adoles-\ncents in Iwaya, Lagos, Nigeria, reported that 18% of the girls\nin the study population had experienced forced sex and 45%\nof them had experienced statutory rape (Kunnuji & Esiet,\nNigeria has the largest number of out-of-school children\nwith a 58% net enrollment ratio for girls in primary school\nand a net secondary attendance rate of 44% for females. Out-\nof-school girls are from the poorest wealth quantiles (British\nCouncil Nigeria, 2012). Poverty may further increase their\nvulnerability to sexual violence. This study was conducted to\ndetermine the prevalence of sexual coercion, abuse, and rape\namong out-of-school adolescents in Lagos, Nigeria and to\ndescribe the context in which this sexual violence occur.\nMethod\nThis descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in\nSangrouse/Sura market, which is one of the major markets in\nLagos, Nigeria. A wide variety of items are sold in stalls\nwithin the market with each item sold in designated sections\nwithin the market. These sections are called \"iso\" and are\nnamed according to what items are sold in that section of the\nmarket. There are several out-of-school female adolescents\nworking or serving as apprentices in the market.\nThe study population was the female out-of-school ado-\nlescents who were unmarried and between ages of 10 and 19\nyears working or serving as apprentices in the market. The\nminimum sample size was estimated using the Cochran's\nThe sampling method used was cluster sampling. The\nmarket is grouped into sections (\"iso\") depending on the\nitems sold. Each section was taken as a cluster. There were\n18 sections (clusters) in the market, including provisions sec-\ntion, yam section, drinks section, ingredients/vegetable sec-\ntion, and toiletries/cosmetics section. Using the clusters as\nsampling units, our sample frame was the list of clusters. A\nsimple random sample of clusters was selected, and all the\nunits (eligible respondents) in the selected cluster were\nrecruited into the study. Eighty-three percent of clusters in\nthe market were surveyed. A representative sample of 350\nrespondents was recruited from the clusters to participate in\nthe study.\nData were collected using pretested questionnaires which\nwere administered by trained interviewers. The question-\nnaire comprised of four sections and was developed guided\nby review of literature of studies on sexual violence. It con-\nsisted of sixty questions to elicit information on socio demo-\ngraphic characteristics, sexual coercion, and violence. The\nquestionnaire was semi-structured and consisted mainly of\nclosed-ended questions. Ten female medical interviewers\nwere trained for 2 days to collect data. The questionnaire was\npretested in a similar market. Epi info 6 statistical software\nwas used for data entry and analysis. Ethical approval to con-\nduct the study was obtained from the ethical committee of\nthe Lagos University Teaching Hospital. Informed consent\nwas obtained from the respondents' parents/guardians and\nfrom all respondents.\nLimitations\nAppropriate measures were taken to reassure respondents of\nconfidentiality and maintain their privacy. However, because\nof the sensitive nature of the questions asked, there might\nhave been some underreporting and respondents may have\ngiven socially accepted responses. Only adolescents attached\nto stalls were used to ensure a fairly stable population.\nTherefore, the \"mobile\" adolescents who hawk goods in the\nmarket were excluded from the study. However, they make\nup a small minority of adolescents in the market.\nResults\nThree hundred fifty female adolescent respondents were\ninterviewed in the market. Majority (89.4%) were older ado-\nlescents between the age of 15 and 19 years (Table 1). Mean\nage was 17 years. Less than a third of respondents (29%) had\ncompleted secondary school. The main reasons given for\nwhy they were out of school was because they were unable\nto afford the cost of formal education (33.0%). Less than half\nof the respondents lived with their parents; 24.3% live with\nboth parents whereas 3.7% and 20.3% live with their father\nor mother, respectively. The others live with employers, rela-\ntives, and guardians and friends, whereas 2.9% live alone\n(Table 1). One hundred ninety-four respondents (57.4%)\nstated that they received enough money from their parents/\nguardians to meet their basic needs. Some respondents\n(35.2%) claimed that they are encouraged to find means to\nsupplement what their parents/guardians give.\nHalf of the respondents (50.6%) believed that sex was\nonly proper (\"okay\") among married people, and 35.1% felt\nit is \"okay\" to have sex when dating steadily; 1.7% felt it was\n\"okay\" among people who are dating occasionally, whereas\n12.6% said they are not sure. None of the respondents con-\nsidered sex as acceptable with a stranger or someone they\nhad just met. Almost half (42.9%) of respondents have had\nsex (Figure 1). Majority of respondents who have had sexual\nintercourse first had intercourse between the ages of 15 and\n19 years. Median age at initiation was 16 years. A boyfriend\nwas the first sexual partner of majority of respondents\n(93.6%). When asked for the reason for having sex for the\nfirst time, only 43.8% said it was what they desired. Others\nsaid it was because they felt they needed to do so to show\nlove/commitment to their partner (20.5%), whereas others\n(15.8%) said they were forced by their sexual partners.\nOthers stated that they were pressurized into their first act of\nOdeyemi et al. 3\nsexual intercourse by their partners (6.8%), and for a few\nothers (2.7%), the reason for the first sexual encounter was to\nreceive gifts (Table 2).\nAmong the 150 respondents who have had sexual inter-\nhad more than one sexual partner in the preceding 6 months\nbefore the study. Majority (77.9%) are having sex in the\nbelief that it is the way to express their love for their partner.\nFor 24.0%, it is because their partner demands it, and for\n7.8%, the reason is \"because they are forced to do so.\" Only\n12.3% stated they have sex because it is what they desire.\nDuring their last sexual encounter, only 28% used condoms.\nMajority of respondents (64.1%) believed that it was\ncommon for females to exchange sex for gifts in their com-\nmunity. However, only 2 (1.3%) admitted to currently being\nengaged in that practice. Most (67.1%) of the girls reported\nthat it is common for girls to be raped in their locality.\nTwenty-seven of the sexually active respondents (18%)\nreported that they had experienced rape (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nAlthough the teenage years should be a relatively healthy life\nstage, many adolescent girls in developing countries are at\nrisk. For many, their well-being is compromised by poor\neducation, violence and abuse, unsafe working conditions,\nand lack of autonomy--all manifestations of gender inequal-\nity and poverty (Temin, Levine, & Oomman, 2010). All the\n350 female adolescent respondents in this study were out of\nschool, and less than a third of respondents (29%) had com-\npleted secondary school. Several reasons have been given for\nthe low participation of girls in secondary education in\nNigeria, including economic status. According to a report by\nthe British Council in Nigeria (2012), \"there is a strong cor-\nrelation between Nigerian girls' net school attendance and\nwealth\" (p. 31). The main reason given by the respondents in\nthis study for being out of school was because they were\nunable to afford the cost of formal education (33.0%). As\nreported by Lloyd and Young (2009), \"the immediate bene-\nfits of education during adolescence are greater safety,\nenhanced social status, and better opportunities for self-actu-\nalization and empowerment\" (p. 36). Less than half of the\nrespondents lived with their parents. Majority live with\nemployers, relatives, guardians, and friends, or live alone.\nThese social, economic, and environmental factors make\nthese female adolescents vulnerable to sexual coercion and\nsexual abuse. The person an adolescent resides with\nTable 1. Socio-Demographic Characteristics of Respondents.\nVariable Frequency %\nAge group (years)\nReligion\nPerson respondent lives with\nYes\nNo\nFigure 1. Percentage of respondents who have had sexual\nintercourse.\nTable 2. Respondents' Reason for Initiation of Sexual\nIntercourse.\nTable 3. Prevalence of Rape.\nExperienced rape Frequency %\n4 SAGE Open\ninfluences their age at initiation of sexual intercourse\n(Odeyemi, Onajole, & Ogunowo, 2009). Individual factors\nthat protect women or put them at risk include, \"the woman's\nlevel of education, financial autonomy, previous victimiza-\ntion, level of empowerment and social support\" (WHO,\nAlmost half (43%) of adolescent females in Nigeria are\nreported to be sexually active, with 20.3% of them having\nengaged in sexual intercourse by the age of 15 years (Federal\nministry of Health (Nigeria) [FMOH], 2008). Similarly in\nthis study, 42.9% of respondents reported that they have had\nsex. Median age at initiation was 16 years. A boyfriend was\nthe first sexual partner of majority of respondents (93.6%).\nThese adolescents therefore require information, goal setting\nskills, refusal skills, and decision-making skills to help them\nmake the right choices about their sexual behavior. Young\nage is risk factor for partner violence. As reported in the\nWHO Multi-Country Study on Women's Health and\nDomestic Violence Against Women (WHOMCS) study,\nyounger women especially those between ages 15 and 19 years\nare at higher risk of current sexual violence in most settings. For\nexample in Urban Bangladesh, 48% of 15 to 19 year olds reported\nphysical or sexual violence compared to 10% of 45 to 49 year\nolds. In urban Peru, the difference was 41% among 15 to 19-year-\nIn this study, respondents were asked to indicate whether\ntheir first experience of sexual intercourse was forced, or by\nchoice. Less than half (43.8%) said they had their first act of\nsexual intercourse because it was what they desired. Others\nhad their first act of sexual intercourse because they felt they\nneeded to do so to show love/commitment to their partner\nthey had their first experience of sexual intercourse because\nthey were pressured to do so by their partners (6.8%), and to\nreceive gifts (2.7%). Similar high rates of forced or coerced\nsexual initiation have been reported in population-based\nstudies conducted in such diverse locations as Cameroon, the\nCaribbean, Peru, New Zealand, South Africa, and Tanzania.\nAccording to these studies, \"between 9% and 37% of adoles-\ncent females, have reported sexual coercion at the hands of\nfamily members, teachers, boyfriends or strangers\" (WHO,\nIn 10 of 15 settings studied, over 5% of women who had ever\nhad sex reported their first sexual experience as forced. The\nfigure was 14% or more in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, provincial\nPeru, and the United Republic of Tanzania. (p. 14)\nThe wide variation may be a reflection of social attitudes\ntoward female sexuality or real cultural differences.\nThere is significant underreporting of sexual violence.\nTherefore, published statistics are unlikely to provide an\naccurate picture of the true scale of the problem. Sexual vio-\nlence is ubiquitous; it occurs in every culture, in all levels of\nsociety and in every country of the world. In many cases, it\nbegins in childhood or adolescence and as reported by the\ndescribe their first sexual experience as being forced.\"\nAmong the 150 respondents who have had sexual inter-\n18.7% stated that they had more than one sexual partner in\nlast 6 months. Majority (77.9%) are having sex in the belief\nthat it is \"the way to express their love for their partner\";\n24.0%, because their partner demands it; and 7.8%, because\nthey are forced to do so. Only 12.3% stated they are sexually\nactive because that is what they desire. This demonstrates\nthat many of these adolescents are in sexual relationships for\nthe pleasure of their partners; they feel they have no other\nchoice and perceive that it is the right thing to do. This atti-\ntude may be an expression of the way these females have\nbeen socialized, as evident from the finding in the Nigerian\nNational HIV/AIDS and Reproductive Health Survey\n(NAHRS) in which many of the females interviewed were of\nthe opinion that \"a wife has no right to refuse sex and\ndeserves to be beaten if she refuses to have sex with her part-\nindividual woman's lack of choice to pursue other options\nwithout severe social or physical consequences (Heise,\nviolence is more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual\nentitlement are strong and where gender roles are more rigid\"\n(p. 162). In Ethiopia and Thailand, a large number of women\nreported having intercourse because they are afraid to refuse\nand report being coerced out of fear (WHO, 2005). Studies in\nBangladesh have also reported that women feel that it is\n\"natural\" for a man to have sex with his partner against her\nwill and the woman always has to conform to his requests. In\nthe provincial sites of Bangladesh, Peru, Tanzania, Ethiopia,\nand Samoa, between 10% and 20% of women felt that\n\"women do not have the right to refuse to have sex with their\nreported lifetime prevalence of sexual violence by a partner\nranged between 6% in city sites in Japan, Sergio, and\nMontenegro and 59% in Ethiopia with rates in most places\nfalling between 10% and 50%. The proportion of women\nphysically forced into intercourse varied from 4% in Serbia\nand Montenegro to 46% in Ethiopia and Bangladesh. These\nhigh rates of forced sexual intercourse are particularly worri-\nsome in the light of the HIV pandemic and the long-term\nchallenges faced by those who are victims. It is therefore\nimportant to challenge the social norms that condone and\ntherefore perpetuate violence against women. During adoles-\ncence, girls need accurate information about risks and\nchoices offered in a nonjudgmental manner, peer and other\nsocial support to make healthy choices, and tools to deal with\nrisks to their health (Temin et al., 2010).\nMajority of respondents in this study (64.1%) believed\nthat it was common for females to exchange sex for gifts in\ntheir community. This is not surprising considering the\nOdeyemi et al. 5\nsocioeconomic status of these respondents and the finding\nthat 42.6% of the respondents stated that they do not receive\nenough money from their parents/guardian to meet their\nbasic needs, and some respondents (35.2%) claimed that\nthey are encouraged to find means to supplement what par-\nents/guardians give. These situations make these adolescents\nvulnerable. Availability of funds to meet basic needs has\nbeen reported to be associated with initiation of sexual activ-\nity among adolescents (Odeyemi et al., 2009). However,\nonly a few respondents (1.3%) admitted to currently being\nengaged in the practice of exchanging sex for gifts, which is\nlikely to be underreporting due to the stigma associated with\ntransactional sex. From the report of the FMOH (2008), the\nproportion of respondents who have ever received gifts or\nfavor for sex is higher in the younger age group (15-29\nyears).\nData from country and local studies published by WHO in\n2003 indicate that \"in some parts of the world at least, one\nwoman in every five has suffered an attempted or completed\nrape by an intimate partner during her lifetime\" (WHO,\n2003, p. 1). Poverty, living in a community with a general\ntolerance for sexual violence, and weak sanctions against\nperpetrators have been identified as being contributory fac-\ntors (WHO, 2002). In Nigeria, concerns have been raised\nabout the prevalence of violence against women and girls,\nincluding sexual harassment. In this study, most (67.1%) of\nthe girls reported that it is common for girls to be raped in\ntheir locality. Twenty-seven out of the 150 respondents\n(18%) who have had sexual intercourse reported that they\nhad experienced rape. Victims are unwilling to report certain\ntypes of violence, such as rape, because of shame and social\nstigma, and so very few cases are brought to court in Nigeria,\nand a conspiracy of silence conceals the nature and extent of\nthe problem (British Council Nigeria, 2012). The inadequate\nsocial and legal sanctions create an environment that allows\nsexual violence to occur. Support needs to be provided for\nthe victims, and the legal environment needs to be conducive\nfor adolescents who desire legal action against perpetrators.\nSexual violence has both physical and psychological effects\non health and well-being; these can be short- and/or long-\nterm. The potential reproductive and sexual health conse-\nquences are numerous, including unwanted pregnancy,\nsexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV/AIDS, and\nincreased risk for adoption of risky sexual behaviors (e.g.,\nearly and increased sexual involvement, and exposure to\nolder and multiple partners; WHO, 2003). According to\nThe mental health consequences of sexual violence can be just\nas serious and long lasting. Victims of child sexual abuse, for\nexample, are more likely to experience depression, substance\nabuse, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide in later\nlife than their non-abused counterparts. Worldwide child sexual\nabuse is a major cause of PTSD, accounting for an estimated\nFurther studies need to be done to document the effects of\nsexual abuse on women in this environment.\nConclusion and Recommendation\nOut-of-school adolescents are at high risk of sexual coercion\nand sexual abuse; 15.8% of respondents stated that their first\nact of sexual intercourse was forced, whereas among the\nsexually active, 18% reported that they have experienced\nrape. These are acts of sexual violence. Appropriate social\nand legal sanctions must be put in place to reduce the preva-\nlence of sexual violence, and support should be provided for\nthe victims. Gender norms that promote violence against\nwomen need to be addressed, and young women need train-\ning on negotiation skills. A national campaign should be ini-\ntiated to tackle gender violence and raise awareness of its\ndetrimental impacts on society.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research and/or\nauthorship of this article.\nReferences\nAlemika, E.
