In a\nstudy examining the experiences of veiled Muslim women\nas victims of Islamophobia, I was both a researcher and a\nparticipant. Specifically, in addition to individual and focus\ngroup interviews with Muslim women who wear the niqab\n(face veil), I employed auto-ethnography whereby I wore\nthe niqab in public spaces at the suggestion of some of my\nrespondents. Wearing the veil myself was something I\ndecided to do after my pilot interviews, when some of my\nrespondents suggested that doing so would enable me to\n`see the world through their eyes'. Indeed, being an Orthodox\nChristian female researcher meant that I was perceived as an\noutsider by my participants; however, wearing the niqab\nallowed me to gain insider knowledge (Keval, 2009). The\naim of this added layer of auto-ethnography was to identify\nthe role of the `visibility' of the Muslim identity in trigger-\ning Islamophobic hostility in public spaces. As such, I used\nmy experiences, together with those of my participants, to\ncomplement the main research methods of interviews and\nfocus groups. Using auto-ethnography allowed for my expe-\nriences to play a valid role in the study because the method\nincludes the researcher as a participant (Smith, 2005).\nWithin the framework of grounded theory (Glaser and\nStrauss, 1967), this approach led to the co-creation of\nknowledge by the participants and myself.\nAuto-ethnography can be understood as the ethnographic\nmethod that uses self-observation and reflexive investigation\nfor the purposes of extending sociological understanding\n`most criminologists do not like to talk about themselves and\nResearching victimisation using\nauto-ethnography: Wearing the\nMuslim veil in public\nIrene Zempi\n Keywords\nAuto-ethnography, Muslim women, veil, victimisation, insider/outsider\nDivision of Sociology, School of Social Sciences, Nottingham Trent\nUniversity, Nottingham, UK\nCorresponding author:\nIrene Zempi, Department of Sociology, Nottingham Trent University,\nNottingham, NG1 4FQ, UK.\nEmail: irene.zempi@ntu.ac.uk\nArticle\n2 Methodological Innovations\ntheir feelings very much'(p. 705). In auto-ethnography, there\nis a considerable emphasis on personal recollections, the\nevocation of feelings and the exploration of characters. This\nmeans that the resulting accounts of auto-ethnography can be\nhighly charged for the author and reader alike (Atkinson,\n2015). Despite recent accounts of the role of emotion in\nself are usually absent. This has often been attributed to the\nways in which the discipline is structured \u00ad requiring\nresearchers to minimise their selves, `viewing self as a con-\ntaminant and attempting to transcend and deny it' (Wall,\nFrom a positivist perspective, the researcher ensures\nobjectivity in the research process by denying their identity.\nHowever, the postmodern era has made it possible for inno-\nvative research strategies such as auto-ethnography to\nemerge (Mannay and Morgan, 2015). Founded on postmod-\nern ideas, auto-ethnography questions the dominant scien-\ntific paradigm and makes room for other ways of knowing\nthrough sharing unique, subjective and evocative stories of\nexperience that contribute to our understanding of the social\nworld and allow us to reflect on what could be different\nbecause of what we have learned (Wall, 2006). However,\nauto-ethnography is rarely used to understand victimisation.\nThere do exist some feminist auto-ethnographies of sexual\nviolence (see, for example, Hayes and Jeffries, 2015; Minge,\nposeful or tactical use of auto-ethnography, as is the case in\nthis study. To the best of the author's knowledge, purposeful\nattempts to research victimisation using auto-ethnography\n(or ethnography) are unheard of within criminology. (A note-\nworthy exception from journalism is Ray Sprigle (1949) of\nthe Post-Gazette (newspaper in Pittsburgh, United States),\nwho posed as a black man to experience first-hand what life\nwas like for Black people living under the system of legal\nsegregation known as `Jim Crow'.)\nAgainst this background, my study of auto-ethnography\non victimisation is extremely novel in criminological\nresearch. In this article, I reflect upon my personal experi-\nences of utilising this method. First, I discuss the main tenets\nof auto-ethnography, exploring how it was ideal for my\nresearch at the same time as it presented challenges. Second,\nI explore the emotional, psychological and physical impacts\nof being targeted because of my adopted Muslim identity\nthrough the wearing of the niqab. Third, I discuss the theo-\nretical and methodological issues that arise from undertaking\nauto-ethnography when researching the Islamophobic vic-\ntimisation of veiled Muslim women as an insider/outsider.\nFourth, I discuss the usefulness of auto-ethnography for\nunderstanding victimisation. It will be concluded that while\nresearchers need to balance the risks presented by this\napproach against the opportunities to generate appreciative\ncriminological data, auto-ethnographic research on victimi-\nsation offers real potential as a criminological method.\nConceptualising auto-ethnography\nAuto-ethnography is an emergent method although its ten-\nets stretch back over much ethnographical research (Taber,\nto anthropological studies by individuals of their own cul-\nture. From this perspective, auto-ethnography was nar-\nrowly defined as `insider ethnography'. More recently,\nhowever, as Ellingson and Ellis (2008) note, `the meanings\nand applications of autoethnography have evolved in a\nmanner that makes precise definition difficult' (p. 449).\nIndeed, an exact definition of the concept of auto-ethnogra-\nphy is rather elusive. Nevertheless, the consensus view is\nthat auto-ethnography relies on using and analysing the\nresearcher's own experiences. Specifically, auto-ethnography\ncan be seen to range from starting research from one's own\nexperience, to studies in which the researcher's experience\nis explored alongside those of the participants, through to\nexamples in which the researcher's experiences of conduct-\ning the research become the actual focus of investigation\n(Ellis and Bochner, 2000). Different approaches in auto-\nethnography can be characterised in terms of different rela-\ntionships between the personal and the wider social world\nthat the writing seeks to enquire into (Denshire and Lee,\n2013). These differences have been classified by Ellis and\nBochner (2006) in terms of `evocative' and `analytic'\napproaches.\nThe evocative (also called `emotive') approach fore-\ngrounds the researcher's personal experiences and high-\nlights the importance of storytelling in understanding\nhuman experiences. In this respect, auto-ethnographers\ntend to focus more on the self than on their social world\nauto-ethnography, which is primarily concerned with the\nresearcher's subjective life experiences. In contrast, ana-\nlytic auto-ethnography connects to `some broader set of\nsocial phenomena than those provided by the data them-\nauto-ethnography is not simply to document personal expe-\nriences and provide an insider's perspective; rather, its pur-\npose is to use empirical data in order to gain insight into\nsome broader set of social phenomena than those provided\nby the data themselves. In the words of Wakeman (2014:\n705), analytic auto-ethnography `is not so much a method\nof self-investigation, but a technique of social investigation\nconducted through the self'. In this regard, the goal is not\njust to capture emotional and evocative content but rather\nto develop a broad critical analysis of any given social phe-\nnomenon through it. This binary classification is useful as\nan initial way of making visible the variation in how auto-\nethnographic writers integrate the strands of self and cul-\nture in their writing (Denshire and Lee, 2013).\nHowever, despite advances made in this field in recent\nyears, auto-ethnography has attracted stern critical attention\nfrom criminologists (Wakefield, 2014). Specifically, auto-\nethnography has been critiqued as a narcissistic preoccupa-\ncareer progression (Poulos, 2010). By using self as a source\nof data, perhaps the only source, auto-ethnography has been\ncriticised for being self-indulgent, introspective and individ-\nstates that\nthe more we celebrate autoethnography, the greater the danger\nthat we treat ourselves as being more interesting than the social\nworlds around us ... The social world is not a vehicle for our\nemotional responses, or blank canvas onto which to project our\nown anxieties and preoccupations. (p. 166)\nthat we must `keep autoethnographic writing in its place'.\nyears that passed between the events their auto-ethnogra-\nphies depict and their putting them to paper as indicative of\ntheir trepidation to engage in such `self-absorption'. Crewe\nhis ethnography, `not because my identity was irrelevant to\nthe study, but because my identity was not what the study\nwas about'.\nHowever, as Wakefield (2014) points out, auto-ethnography\n\u00ad especially analytic auto-ethnography \u00ad can provide a sound\nepistemic platform upon which meaningful challenges to pre-\nvailing theories of criminological subjects can be built.\nCorrespondingly, this study subscribes to the analytic approach,\nusing my personal experiences together with those of my par-\nticipants, as empirical data to gain insight into the targeted vic-\ntimisation of veiled Muslim women in public in the United\nKingdom.BeforereflectingonmyexperiencesofIslamophobic\nvictimisation while wearing the veil, I offer a brief overview of\nthe research study and describe the journey from merely using\ninterviews to undertaking auto-ethnography.\nThe research study\nThe study examined veiled Muslim women's experiences of\nIslamophobic victimisation in public in the United Kingdom.\nAccording to Mythen et al. (2009), the concept of `victimisa-\ntion' is understood as the act by which someone is rendered\na victim, the experience of being a victim in parallel with the\nsocio-cultural process by which this occurs. Following ter-\nrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the United States and 7/7 in the\nUnited Kingdom, there has been much discussion about the\ngrowth of Islamophobia in the West (see, for example, Allen,\nHowever, this discussion has not been accompanied by as\nmuch empirical analysis of Islamophobic victimisation as\none might expect (Moosavi, 2015). In particular, there is a\ndearth of studies examining the lived experiences of Muslim\nwomen who wear the niqab in public in the West. As a result,\nthey remain a relatively invisible population in research\nterms, despite their vulnerability to Islamophobic hostility\nand attacks in public spaces.\nThe research took the form of a qualitative study based on\nindividual and focus group interviews with veiled Muslim\nwomen coupled with auto-ethnography whereby I wore the\nfull veil \u00ad including jilbab (long dress), hijab (headscarf) and\nniqab (face veil) \u00ad for prolonged periods of time in public\n(see image below).\nThe fieldwork took place in Midland City1 between 2011\n20 focus group discussions with veiled Muslim women who\nhad been victims of Islamophobia. Prospective participants\nwere identified through local Muslim organisations, includ-\ning mosques, Muslim schools and Islamic centres.Additional\nsteps were taken to access potential participants who may\nhave remained unidentified by these organisations, and this\nhelped to broaden the sample at least to some extent. For\nexample, I attended a number of social events for Muslim\nwomen in Midland City in order to raise awareness about the\nstudy and identify prospective participants. Additional assis-\ntance in securing access to participants came from the\nStudent Islamic Societies at two local universities.\nParticipants unaffiliated to any local Muslim organisations or\ngroups were also recruited through snowball sampling.\nParticipants were given the option of taking part in either an\nindividual interview or focus group discussion. Individual,\nin-depth interviews allow for `rich' data to be collected with\ndetailed descriptions of participants' lived experiences\n(Hennink et al., 2011). This approach is especially valuable\nfor researching sensitive issues that require confidentiality\nand a more intimate setting for data collection, and this is\nparticularly appropriate for hard-to-access groups such as\nveiled Muslim women. Focus group interviews incorporate\nFigure 1. The Author\n4 Methodological Innovations\nthe strengths of qualitative research in terms of gathering\nrich data while generating additional insights through group\ninteractions (Curtis and Curtis, 2011). In the context of this\nparticular piece of research, the focus group method afforded\nthe possibility of open discussion among veiled Muslim\nwomen with similar or different experiences of Islamophobic\nvictimisation while also highlighting collectively held beliefs\nand attitudes.\nWith respect to employing auto-ethnography, I wore the\nveil for 4 weeks as part of my daily routine in public places\nin Midland City, including streets, shopping centres and pub-\nlic means of transport. This aspect of the research followed\nan open-ended process. I began with a specific question,\n`How does my perceived identity as a veiled Muslim woman\nrender me vulnerable to victimisation in public places?'\nThroughout the fieldwork, I kept a diary in order to record\nmy experiences and reflections. However, it is important to\npoint out that auto-ethnography was not part of my original\nresearch methodology. When I was initially developing my\nresearch project, my plan was to use individual and focus\ngroup interviews with veiled Muslim women. However, dur-\ning the pilot interviews some participants suggested that I\nwear the veil in order to see for myself the level of abuse and\nhostility that they suffered on a daily basis. Some partici-\npants (although not all, as discussed later) actually insisted\nthat I wear the veil in order to accurately interpret their sto-\nries and represent their voices regarding the nature, extent\nand impact of Islamophobic victimisation. I responded to my\nparticipants' suggestion/invitation to dress as \u00ad and therefore\nhave the experiences of \u00ad the insider. As will be discussed\nlater, this approach did improve my ability to understand and\nanalyse the data gathered through the individual and focus\ngroups with veiled Muslim women. Also, adopting this\napproach did get me closer to those participants who sup-\nported this method (particularly in terms of access and qual-\nity of data elicited in interviews and focus groups), although\nfor those who disapproved of this approach I may have actu-\nally constructed barriers and therefore lessened access and\nrapport. With respect to my experiences in the field, the vari-\nous situations that I encountered because of my adopted\nMuslim identity resulted in me being subjected to verbal\nabuse, harassment and potential physical attacks.\nExperiences of victimisation\nVerbal harassment and intimidation\nMy experiences of harassment and victimisation as a result of\nadopting a `visible' Muslim identity included name-calling,\nswearing, threats of physical violence, persistent staring,\nderogatory forms of humour and direct accusatory questions.\nUnderlying all these forms of verbal harassment and intimi-\ndation was a clear sense of Islamophobic sentiment and hos-\ntility, and this was made apparent through the language used\nby the perpetrators. Typical examples of the comments people\nmade included shouting `Muslim terrorist', `suicide bomber'\nand `you lot are terrorists', which indicated people's percep-\ntions of veiled Muslim women as a security or terrorist threat.\nIndeed, research shows that visible Muslims (i.e. those read-\nily identifiable as Muslims through their dress or other aspects\nof their appearance and behaviour) and veiled Muslim\nwomen, in particular, are often targeted because their abusers\nhold the view that all Muslims are terrorists or terrorist sym-\npathisers (Githens-Mazer and Lambert, 2010). Seen in this\nlight, the veiled female body offers a visual representation of\n`radical' Islam. Additionally, I was subjected to swearing\nsuch as `Muslim whore', `fucking bitch', `Muslim scum' and\n`your religion is filth'. The comments and gestures perpetra-\ntors made were sometimes threatening as indicated in the fol-\nlowing diary extracts:\nA skinhead man made knife gestures at me whilst I was walking\non \u00ad-- Lane. I feel like a walking target. I fear for my life.\nIn town a group of white British men shouted at me `we will\nburn your fucking Quran. You Muslims kill Christians, so all of\nus Christians will come kill all of you Muslims. We want to\nteach your kind a lesson'. I think they are EDL [English Defence\nLeague] members because they are carrying EDL flags. I feel\nvery intimidated and I am worried that they might be carrying\nweapons.\nThe wearing of the niqab carries connotations of gender\ninequality, religious extremism, lack of integration and\nthreats to `British/Western ideals' (Chakraborti and Zempi,\n2012). It has been referred to as the `icon of the intolerable\ndifference' between `us' and `them' (Scott, 2007: 5).\nCorrespondingly, there were incidents where the nature of\nthe verbal abuse suggested Islamophobic, racist and xeno-\nphobic sentiments, as demonstrated in the following diary\nextracts:\nI was walking on \u00ad-- Road today and a group of teenagers\nbegan mocking my niqab and swearing at me. They told me to\n`fuck off back to Afghanistan' and one of them also shouted\nI was on the bus going home and an elderly man moved seats as\nI sat next to him.2 When I got off the bus he told me `you're not\nwelcome here, go back to where you came from'.\nAs these quotes demonstrate, Islamophobic attitudes are\noften intertwined with racist and xenophobic sentiments.\nHowever, this is not to overlook the fact that veiled Muslim\nwomen become victims of targeted violence because their\nabusers have been motivated either solely or partially by\nother factors. For example, the sight of the veiled female\nbody might provoke anger in some individuals on sexist as\nwell as Islamophobic grounds. In this sense, the face and\nbody of a woman are an object of sexual attraction, and when\nthese are covered, it disrupts public expectations of how\nwomen should behave and dress in public in order to visually\n`please'men. This emphasises the notion of appropriate fem-\ninine sexuality, which ensures that the behaviour and attire of\nwomen are strictly monitored (Dwyer, 1999). This was evi-\ndent in incidents where I was subjected to sexual harassment\nsuch as whistling, catcalls and kissing sounds. These experi-\nences were typical of those mentioned by my participants.\nThis form of sexual harassment is motivated by a male gaze\nthat desires possession of women's bodies and `wants to see'\nWhile in most cases verbal abuse was momentary when\nwalking on the street or while waiting for the bus, in other cases\nI was subjected to sustained periods of invisible Islamophobic\nvictimisation, particularly when being stuck within a confined\nspace, such as on public transport and in a shop. By invisible\nforms, I am referring to what might be best described as subtle\nand potentially more pervasive manifestations of hostility. This\ncan be the case where Islamophobic prejudice or hostility is\nmanifested in a less overt manner than that typically associated\nwith Islamophobia, and this highlights the importance of appre-\nciating Islamophobic victimisation as a continuum rather than\nas discrete one-off incidents (Zempi and Chakraborti, 2014).\nSpecifically, unnecessary or persistent staring and being\nignored were common experiences as a veiled woman. The fol-\nlowing accounts are taken from my research diary to illustrate\nexamples of invisible Islamophobic hostility in terms of being\nignored or refused to be served:\nI am in the fruit market in town and the stall owner refuses to\nserve me. I feel humiliated and ashamed.\nI am waiting in the queue to pay for an item in a shop in [a\nshopping centre in MidlandCity]. In front of me there is a white\nman who is served immediately. The person at the till seems to\nignore me. I can't help thinking `is it because I'm wearing the\nveil?' I feel angry as I am a regular customer at this store but it\nseems that the moment I put on the veil, the quality of customer\nservice changes from excellent to zero.\nFurthermore, the only example of a physical attack was\nwhen a passing car threw eggs at me, as indicated in the fol-\nlowing diary extract:\nI feel quite upset as a car drove past me on \u00ad-- Lane and a white\nmale threw eggs at me and then he shouted something about\nMuslims. I am so shocked that I did not manage to get the car's\nnumber plate.\nSimilarly, my participants described incidents where they\nhad eggs, stones, alcohol, water bombs, bottles, take-away\nfood and rubbish thrown at them by people on the street or\nfrom moving cars. Nevertheless, I felt somewhat lucky\nbecause, unlike some of my participants who suffered more\nserious incidents of physical abuse, I only experienced rela-\ntively low-level manifestations of Islamophobia. For example,\nseveral participants described suffering physical abuse such as\nhaving their veils taken off, pushing, shoving, experiencing\nsustained physical assaults and even incidents where passing\nvehicles had attempted to run them over. Knowledge of these\nincidents heightened my concerns that verbal abuse could\nescalate into violent assault. Indeed, I was afraid that I could\nsuffer similar experiences. I knew that I was also vulnerable to\nphysical abuse because of the visibility of my perceived\nMuslim identity and as a result, I was scared for my safety in\npublic.\nImpact and responses\nVerbal attacks coupled with the possibility of suffering phys-\nical attacks affected me emotionally, including feeling afraid,\nshocked, upset or angry on particular occasions. Such feel-\nings were particularly pronounced immediately after an inci-\ndent, but they seemed to develop into long-term anxieties. I\nsoon developed sleep problems and lost my appetite.\nMoreover, there were days when I felt reluctant to leave my\nhouse. I started to feel cautious, nervous, suspicious and dis-\ntrustful of people I encountered in public spaces.\nThe possibility of verbal or physical violence meant that I\nfelt anxious, vulnerable and exposed when walking on the\nstreet or travelling on public transport. I soon became iso-\nlated and withdrawn. Experiences of Islamophobic victimi-\nsation also increased feelings of insecurity, vulnerability and\nanxiety among the veiled Muslim women who took part in\nthe study. Bowling (2009) states that persistent victimisation\ncan undermine the security of actual and potential victims\nand induce fear and anxiety. Participants reported panic\nattacks, worry, extreme anxiety and depression, which were\nsaid to derive from the fear of future victimisation.\nClearly, employing auto-ethnography had emotional, psy-\nchological and physiological impacts upon my wellbeing.\nDenshire and Lee (2013) argue that `putting the self into the\npicture at all is challenging enough in this context, but putting\nthe very notion of a self at risk opens up places of vulnerabil-\nity' (p. 224). However, at the time I consciously downplayed\nthe seriousness of the situation and felt a strong need to portray\nmyself as coping with the fieldwork to my PhD supervisors,\ncolleagues and all others around me because I feared that I\nwould be prevented from completing the auto-ethnographic\npart of the research. I suffered in silence and received no sup-\nport for experiencing this victimisation. Nevertheless, as dis-\ncussed below, the value of potentially putting myself at risk\nwas premised on the insights into the victimisation of veiled\nMuslim women that auto-ethnography provided me with,\nwhich would only have been possible through wearing the veil\nmyself. In other words, gaining insider knowledge is some-\nthing that I would not have learnt from the interviews alone.\nOutsider versus insider status in auto-\nethnography\nAs an Orthodox Christian woman investigating Islamophobic\nvictimisation, my research was primarily from an outsider per-\nspective. The researcher's positionality as insider or outsider\n6 Methodological Innovations\nin relation to their participants influences all aspects of the\nresearch process including research design, access, data col-\nlection and data interpretation. Positionality is determined\n``by where one stands in relation to `the other'' (Merriam\nresearch with a group of which he or she is a member, based\non characteristics such as religion, race/ethnicity, gender and\nsexual identity (Kanuha, 2000). Insider research is considered\nto be from an emic perspective, as it involves the description\nof a phenomenon that is understood by the researcher who has\nEmployingauto-ethnographyinresearchintoIslamophobic\nvictimisation allowed me to gain insider knowledge. As\nunderstand the social world `from the point of view' of your\nparticipants; rather, the ability to take the role of the other and\nto enter into some sort of interpretative comprehension is cru-\ncial for producing knowledge. In the context of this study,\nrole adoption includes taking the role of the other in order to\nmake sense of veiled Muslim women's lived experiences and\nthe world around them \u00ad a process of attempting to put into\nwriting `what it is like to be somebody else' (Van Maanen,\nresearcher-participant, offers a window onto the world as\nexperienced by participant (Mykhalovskiy, 1997), one that\ncould have been experienced only through wearing the veil.\nBecoming an insider allowed me to better tell the story of my\nparticipants and incorporate my own views, thoughts, and\npersonal stories of victimisation in public in order to comple-\nment and, as a result, enrich the story of my participants\nA common argument in the research literature is that\ninsiders are more likely to be able to understand and accu-\nrately represent participants' experiences (Labaree, 2002).\nThis can be particularly useful in research with groups that\nhave been under-represented and socially or culturally mar-\nginalised. Similarly, participants might be more willing to\nshare their experiences. It is as if they feel, `You are one of us\nand it is us versus them (those on the outside who don't\nCorrespondingly, outsider researchers are accused of lacking\nunderstanding (Savvides et al., 2014). From this perspective,\noutsiders cannot understand or represent accurately the expe-\nriences of their participants. This is important when research\nis conducted with oppressed, marginalised and `other' com-\nInitially, participants considered me as an outsider to their\nreligion, culture and experiences as victims of Islamophobia\nbecause of my religious identity as an Orthodox Christian.\nSome of my participants insisted that I wear the veil in order\nto accurately interpret their stories and represent their voices\nregarding the nature, extent and impact of Islamophobic vic-\ntimisation. Despite explicit religious differences between\nparticipants and myself, auto-ethnography fostered empathy,\nrapport and trust. In this regard, wearing the veil enhanced\naccess to participants by demonstrating that I was willing to\n`take the extra step' in order to develop in-depth knowledge\nand understanding of their experiences. As Zubair et al.\n(2012) point out, researchers' bodily appearances and bodily\nactions, adaptations and interactions are important markers\nof their identity in the fieldwork. Participants may perceive\nand judge researchers positively or negatively and/or as\ninsiders or outsiders based on their embodied identity\noften have to learn to adapt their bodily performances and\nactions \u00ad including the way they dress \u00ad in order to fit in\nwith, and be accepted among, those they are researching,\nespecially when they are closely scrutinised and instructed.\nAttempts to change, however clumsy, are often interpreted as\nsigns of respect. This demonstrates the important role the\nresearcher's body and behaviour in developing trust and rap-\nport with participants.\nOverall, I won a great deal of approval among most par-\nticipants. I felt accepted by certain individuals, who were\nperhaps reluctant to take part in the study because of my non-\nMuslim background. In addition to providing me access,\nusing auto-ethnography enhanced participant engagement\nand revelation throughout the research process. Sharing sim-\nilar experiences with participants granted me legitimacy in\nthe field, at least with some of the respondents. However,\nalthough the majority of participants were supportive of my\ndecision to wear the veil, some participants expressed disa-\ngreement. One participant felt that it was disrespectful to\nIslamic laws to wear the veil as a non-Muslim. She felt that\nthe veil is not simply a piece of cloth that anyone can wear;\nrather, it is part of practising Islam in line with praying five\ntimes a day, reading the Quran and fasting during Ramadan.\nMoreover, in the context of a focus group discussion in a\nmosque, some participants argued that by wearing the veil as\na social experiment, I was minimising the Muslim woman's\nexperience. They argued that spending a day, a week or a\nyear experiencing the stigma, prejudice and discrimination\nthat veiled Muslim women deal with on a day-to-day basis\ndoes not actually reflect their true experiences. In both cases,\nthe authenticity of my veiled auto-ethnography and my abil-\nity to fathom veiled Muslim women's experiences as victims\nof Islamophobia were questioned.\nAccording to Labaree (2002), the advantage we have in\nknowing the community may be weakened or strengthened\nbased on the ways in which our various social identities may\nshift during interaction with participants or based on the\ndegree of perceived or real closeness to participants as a result\nof shared experience or social identities. On one hand,\nresearcher self-disclosure might reduce the hierarchical\nnature of the researcher\u00adparticipant relationship and encour-\nage participant disclosure and facilitate trust and mutual iden-\ntification within the relationship (McDonald, 2001). However,\nself-disclosure might also make the researchers vulnerable\nand open them to criticism from others, including participants\nand other researchers (McDonald, 2001; MacCormack,\n2001). It is not always easy or, indeed, possible to predict how\none will be placed by the participants \u00ad how commonality or\ndifference will be constructed, interpreted or experienced\nRelatedly, I was often asked (especially by older partici-\npants) whether I wanted to convert to Islam. Since my answer\nwas negative, I was questioned as to why I was interested in\ndoing this research and even wearing the veil. A couple of\nparticipants gave me booklets, which included information\nabout the benefits of converting to Islam, or prayed for me to\nconvert to Islam. For me to ask them not to pray for me or\nrefuse these booklets could have jeopardised rapport and\neven their participation in the study, so I accepted their book-\nlets and prayers. Zubair et al. (2012) point out that research\nparticipants are not necessarily a vulnerable and passive\ngroup vis-\u00e0-vis the researcher but can be active agents who\nexercise considerable power over the research process and\nresearch relationships.\nIrrespective of whether respondents approved or disap-\nproved of my decision to wear the veil, a key concern among\nall participants was the fact that I would be recognised as a\nMuslim. Participants felt that being identified as a follower\nof Islam comes with tremendous responsibility. They\nexplained that the veil is not merely a covering but, more\nimportantly, it is behaviour, manners and appearance in pub-\nlic. They advised me to dress and behave in a religiously and\nculturally appropriate manner throughout the fieldwork,\nwhich I took seriously during fieldwork. For example, they\nadvised me to wear a black veil instead of a colourful one, for\nthe purposes of modesty. Also, they advised me to avoid\nwearing excessive make up (especially in the area around the\neyes). Moreover, they pointed out that it was not appropriate\nto be seen to shake hands with men, to sit or stand next to\nthem or to talk to men unnecessarily. They also advised me\nto avoid eye contact with men in public. Thus, the process of\nbecoming an insider through veiled auto-ethnography\ninvolved learning about cultural and religious norms as well\nas codes of behaviour for veiled Muslim women in Islam, in\naddition to knowledge about Islamophobic victimisation.\nOverall, I usually followed their advice during fieldwork in\norder to minimise the risk of portraying Islam in a negative\nlight. However, it was not always easy to remember to follow\ntheir suggestions, particularly in relation to sitting or stand-\ning next to men.\nThe researcher's positionality is not fixed but dynamic.\nmeet diametrically different demands ... the outsider must to\nsome extent get into the natives' heads, skins, or shoes,\nwhereas the insider must get out of his or her own'.

To present these concepts in a\ndualistic manner is overly simplistic. It is restrictive to lock into\na notion that emphasizes either/or, one or the other, you are in or\nyou are out. (p. 60)\nWithin this framework, researchers are not either insiders or\noutsiders; rather, they continuously negotiate their multiple\nidentities and aspects of the research process by moving flu-\nidly within the space between.\nUsefulness of auto-ethnography for\nunderstanding victimisation\nUsing auto-ethnography for understanding victimisation is\nnovel in criminological ethnography. Purposeful attempts to\nresearch victimisation this way are almost unheard of. My\nexperiences of auto-ethnography on victimisation suggest\nthat this research method can be a double-edged sword. On\none hand, using auto-ethnography offered unique methodo-\nlogical advantages. Specifically, the inclusion of auto-eth-\nnography during fieldwork shows that research participants\nare neither passive nor neutral. It is interactive, creative,\nselective and interpretive, giving meaning and suggesting\nfurther paths of enquiry (Rock, 2015). Concurrently, my\npositionality changed from outsider to insider, thereby oper-\nating in a fluid space somewhere between the two.According\nto Atkinson (2015), flexible fieldwork means that our work\nis a developmental, interactive process. Fieldwork conducted\nin a reflexive mode can help generate insightful perspectives.\nThis ties in with the logic of grounded theory, which entails\ngoing back to the data and forward into analysis and then\nreturning to the field to gather further data and refine the\nemerging theoretical framework (Atkinson, 2015).\nOn the other hand, using auto-ethnography in the form of\ncovert research entailed certain ethical problems. During the\nprocess of auto-ethnography, I assumed a covert role and did\nnot disclose the fact that I was a researcher to members of the\npublic. As Murphy and Dingwall (2007) point out, auto-eth-\nnographers find it especially difficult to establish the bound-\naries of informed consent and whether or not to divulge\nresearchers' identities in certain cases. This is not because\nresearchers wish to engage in covert research, but because of\nthe nature of the research itself, it becomes all but impossible\nto solicit consent to the research that is informed, in the sense\nof being predictable before the research itself is carried out\nAdmittedly, using auto-ethnography in the form of covert\nresearch was perhaps ethically dubious due to there being a\n8 Methodological Innovations\nlevel of deception involved. However, covert research can\nuncover phenomena that would otherwise remain inscrutable\n(see, for example, Prokos and Padavic (2002) who docu-\nmented sexism in a police academy). In the context of this\nstudy, assuming a covert role was essential for the success of\nthe research. It is highly likely that people's awareness of my\nstatus as a researcher would influence how they treated me,\nwhich would potentially mask the true dimensions of public\nexpressions of Islamophobic prejudice and hostility. Also, I\ncaused no harm to those people who victimised me, and I did\npractice self-disclosure with women who wear the veil \u00ad the\nresearch was negotiated with them. Therefore, although there\nare important ethical questions here, with some feminist\nscholars positioning self-disclose as sound and necessary\nremains that in this instance, withholding my true identity\nwas ethically defensible.\nInsider knowledge generated through auto-ethnography\nmakes a substantive contribution to our understanding of\nIslamophobic attacks and the impact they have upon veiled\nMuslim women. Despite putting myself at risk, wearing the\nveil helped me to deepen my understanding of the targeted\nvictimisation of veiled Muslim women. It allowed me to\nexperience many of the emotions that Muslim women feel\nwhen they wear the veil in public, such as depression, fear,\nanxiety, suspicion, anger and isolation. This would not have\nbeen possible through the interviews alone. Consequently,\nauto-ethnography affected the formulation of knowledge\nand its interpretation. At the same time, knowledge is provi-\nsional, bound temporally and contextually, shaped both by\nthe particular purposes and experiences of the researcher\u00ad\nparticipant and by the encounters which researchers had\nwith others in the field (Rock, 2015). From this perspective,\nperhaps I can only claim to have secondary knowledge of\nveiled Muslim women's experiences as victims. My second-\nary knowledge may be useful, public, accessible and illumi-\nnating, and it is also dependent and derivative. Wearing the\nveil for a limited time does not allow me to fully understand\nthe depth of veiled Muslim women's experiences of\nIslamophobia in public. The ultimate authority on experi-\nences of Islamophobia remains veiled Muslim women\nthemselves, and my own experiences can only complement\ntheir stories. As a result, one might argue that employing\nauto-ethnography in this study was not quite authentic and\ncertainly not the real thing itself (Rock, 2015). One might\nalso argue that employing auto-ethnography was not neces-\nsary, and one might even go further and argue that it under-\nmines attempts to assert agency for the female veil-wearing\nMuslim population \u00ad or that it patronises them.\nHowever, although I had a fleeting glimpse of matters\nknown much more intensely and extensively by veiled Muslim\nwomen themselves, auto-ethnography provided a nuanced and\nunique insight into their vulnerability to Islamophobic vic-\ntimisation in public. The use of my own experiences of\nIslamophobia through `veiled auto-ethnography' seems to be\nvery distinctive. Although I am not Muslim, my experiences\nare no less valid to the experiences of my participants. In fact,\nit is my non-Muslim background that makes my experiences\nso useful in terms of recognising the role of wearing the veil as\na `trigger' to Islamophobic attacks. Clearly, these attacks\nwould not have happened to me had I not wore the veil. The\nfact that I do not normally wear the veil allowed me to see the\ndifference in people's behaviour in public spaces.\nFinally, auto-ethnography inspired data analysis and\nwriting. Not only did it inform the construction of the text\n(because of my status as the producer and to some extent,\nthe product of the study) but it also moved me to write.\nDespite my non-Muslim background, I felt connected to\nmy participants, and thus, I became more passionate about\nthis subject. This notion of responsibility to `do justice' to\ntheir experiences, and commitment to maximise the impact\nof the research, stemmed from the fact that I was now `one\nof them'. As such, using auto-ethnography helped the inter-\npretation of the data in terms of understanding veiled\nMuslim women's experiences as victims of Islamophobia\nand inspired me to make a difference in their lives through\nraising awareness about this problem through publications,\nconferences and engagement with local and national organ-\nisations. Despite the emotional, psychological and physio-\nlogical costs, using veiled auto-ethnography enriched the\nstories of my participants and added credibility to the\nresearch and investigation of a marginalised and hard-to-\nreach population.\nConclusion\nIn this article, I have explored the application of auto-eth-\nnography to the study of victimisation. Specifically, I\nreflected upon my personal experiences of undertaking auto-\nethnography on victimisation through wearing the Muslim\nveil in public. I argued for the novelty of using the auto-eth-\nnographic approach for the study of victimisation. Indeed,\nthis approach is extremely novel in criminological research.\nI described the stigma, prejudice and discrimination that\nI experienced when wearing the veil in public. Moreover, I\nprovided a glimpse into the stigma felt by these women who\nwear the veil every day of their lives, and how they have to\nnavigate themselves through a hostile world that most peo-\nple fail to acknowledge. Despite my outsider status, I used\nauto-ethnography purposefully and tactically in order to\nresearch the experiences of victimised others. This approach\nillustrates that we can understand identity as flexible rather\nthan fixed; researchers can use their identity as a tool in the\nauto-ethnographic toolkit. My personal experiences of using\nauto-ethnography on victimisation demonstrate that auto-\nethnography is neither narcissistic nor lazy. In this study, it\ninvolved being directed by participants in the research and\nbeing willing to expose myself, emotionally and physically.\nThis research strategy challenges those who say that auto-\nethnography is too personal, narcissistic and self-indulgent\nand those who fear that the researcher's identity is now what\nthe research is about.\nMy strategy illustrates something new for auto-ethno-\ngraphic methods: the opportunity to research victimisation\nthrough auto-ethnography. In this regard, there are advan-\ntages and disadvantages that can be applied for others who\nmight consider using a similar approach. For example, doing\nauto-ethnography allowed me to gain insider knowledge,\nwhich would not have been possible through the interviews\nalone. Importantly, gaining insider knowledge contributed to\nthe process of understanding, empathising and more accu-\nrately representing victims' experiences. Nevertheless, there\nwere costs involved. Using my own experiences as the vehi-\ncle, I illustrated the harmful effects of victimisation such as\nemotional, psychological and physical impacts. Also, there\nwere ethical issues involved such as putting myself at risk,\ndoing covert research and upsetting some participants by\noffending Islamic sensibilities. Therefore, researchers need\nto balance the risks presented by auto-ethnographic research\non victimisation against the opportunities to generate appre-\nciative criminological data.\nDeclaration of conflicting interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect\nto the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, author-\nship and/or publication of this article.\nNotes\n1. I have anonymised the city where the fieldwork took place.\n`MidlandCity' is one of the most ethnically and religiously\ndiverse cities in the United Kingdom, with a high population\nof Muslims, specifically of veiled Muslim women.\n2. I acknowledge that this could be seen as a contradiction\nbecause, as I will discuss later, appropriate behaviour to\naccompany wearing the niqab included not sitting or standing\nnext to men. However, I sometimes forgot that it would be\ninappropriate for myself (as a veiled Muslim woman) to be\nseen to sit or stand next to men.\nReferences\nAguilar JL (1981) Insider research: An ethnography of a debate.\nIn: Messerschmidt DA (ed.)
