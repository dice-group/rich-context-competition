Many studies have revealed that the\ninteraction between various environmental factors and cer-\ntaingeneticpolymorphismsmayleadtoCHD.Dyslipidemia\nhave been documented as risk factors for CHD.\nApolipoprotein B (apoB) is the sole protein component of\nlow-density lipoprotein (LDL) which plays an important\nrole in atherogenesis. The relationship between CHD and\napoB gene polymorphisms has been a hotspot in recent\nyears. The apoB gene is located on chromosome 2 and\ncomprises 29 exons.1 Numerous studies have focused on\nthe correlation between the apoB gene polymorphism and\nCHD risk. However, these studies result in conflicting con-\nclusions. Previous meta-analyses exploring the association\nbetween the apoB polymorphisms and CHD risk were also\ncontradictory. Chiodini et al. found no evidence of increased\nrisk emerged for XbaI polymorphism,2 but positive associ-\nations were detected for EcoRI and SpIns/Del polymor-\nphisms in CHD patients.

Homozygous subjects for\nthe rare EcoRI allele had significantly decreased levels of\ntotal and LDL cholesterol. Chen et al. performed a study by\ncollecting and sorting the previously published studies in\nChinese individuals,4 providing evidence that EcoRI A\nallele and XbaI C allele polymorphisms were a risk factor\nfor the development of CHD, respectively .\nTo derive a more precise estimation of the relationship\nbetween CHD and these polymorphisms, we conducted a\nmeta-analysis between the three most frequently investi-\ngated polymorphisms (XbaI, EcoRI, and SpIns/Del) of all\nMaterials and methods\nLiterature search\nAll studies that reported the association between the apoB\npolymorphisms and CHD were identified by comprehen-\nsive computer-based searches of PubMed, Web of Science,\nGoogle Scholar, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang Data,\nChina Biological Medicine Database(SinoMed), and\nChina National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). These\ncomputer searches were limited to English and Chinese\nlanguage articles before March 2014, but did not include\nreviews and editorials. The following keywords were used\nfor searching: \"apolipoprotein B\" OR \"apoB\" AND \"poly-\nmorphism\" OR \"mutation\" OR \"variant\" OR \"variation\"\nOR \"genotype\" AND \"coronary heart disease\" OR \"CHD\"\nOR \"coronary artery disease\" OR \"CAD\" OR \"myocardial\nInfarction\" OR \"MI\" OR \"ischemic cardiovascular dis-\nease\" OR \"ischemic heart disease\" OR \"IHD\".\nInclusion criteria\nThe diagnosis of CHD was fitted to the examination results\nof coronary arteriography, clinical symptoms combined\nwith electrocardiogram, treadmill exercise test, echocardi-\nography, and myocardial perfusion imaging in emission\ncomputed tomography. The inclusion criteria for identified\narticles were as follows: (1) studies are limited to three\npolymorphisms (XbaI, EcoRI, and SpIns/Del) of the apoB\ngene and CHD; (2) independent case-control studies using\neither a hospital-based or a population-based design; (3)\nsimilar to the literature research methods; (4) the literature\nhas a comprehensive statistical index, sufficient data for\nestimating an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence inter-\nval (CI); (5) not republished data. Exclusion criteria were:\n(1) studies in which it was not possible to extract data from\nthe published results; (2) studies that did not report appro-\npriate outcomes were also excluded.\nData extraction\nTwo authors independently extracted data. Disagreement\nwas resolved by consensus. If these two authors could not\nreach a consensus, the result was reviewed by a third\nauthor. The extracted data were consisted of the follow\nitems: the first author's name, publication year, eligible\nsubjects, number of genotypes, allele frequency of case,\npopulation, selection criteria, sex, and age of cases and\ncontrols.\nQuality assessment\nTo determine the methodological quality of each study, we\nused the Newcastle\u00adOttawa scale, which uses a \"star\" rat-\ning system to judge the quality of observational studies.5\nThe NOS ranges between zero (worst) up to nine stars\n(best). Studies with a score equal to or higher than seven\nwere considered to be of high quality. Two investigators\nindependently assessed the quality of included studies, and\nthe result was reviewed by a third investigator.\nDisagreement was resolved by discussion.\nStatistical analysis\nThe associations between XbaI, EcoRI, and SpIns/Del\npolymorphisms of apoB gene and CHD were compared by\nusing the OR corresponding to 95% CI. Heterogeneity\nbetween studies was assessed by I2 test, p < 0.10 and I2 >\n50% indicated evidence of heterogeneity.6,7 If heterogene-\nity existed among the studies, the random effects model\nwas used to estimate the pooled OR (the DerSimonian and\nKacker method).8 Otherwise, the fixed effects model was\nadopted (the Mantel\u00adHaenszel method).9 For the apoB\ngene polymorphisms, we investigated associations\nbetween the genetic variant and CHD risk in a recessive\ndominant genetic model and allelic contrast. Z test was\nused to determine the pooled OR and significance was set\nat p < 0.05. Hardy\u00adWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism was assessed for the con-\ntrols in each study using 2 test at a significant level of p <\n0.05. The potential publication bias was investigated by\nusing funnel plots and Egger's test.10 The statistical analy-\nsis was conducted by using Review Manager 5.20\n(Cochrane Collaboration, The Nordic Cochrane Centre,\nCopenhagen). In order to observe the association between\nnumerous polymorphic sites of apoB gene polymorphisms\nand CHD risk in Chinese, studies of Chinese were consid-\nered in the meta-analysis independently.\nResults\nStudy characteristics\nAll of the studies had been approved by the ethics commit-\ntees of their affiliations.

However, no sig-\nnificant statistical association was found in Chinese people.\nCHD is a multi-factorial and polygenic disorder\nwhich is thought to be the result of interactions between\ncomplex factors of gene-gene and gene-environment.\nThe association between apoB gene polymorphisms and\nthe risk of CHD has been widely studied, but the results\nremain inconclusive.11\u00ad64 For example, Baroni et al.\nreported a significant difference in the development of\nCHD between genotype classes of the XbaI polymor-\nphism in an Italian population.13 Duman et al. did not\nobserve significant differences in the frequencies of\napoB XbaI (CC, CT, TT) and EcoRI (AA, AG, GG) gen-\notypes between case and control subjects in Turkish.20\nGallegos-Arreola et al. detected that the apoB XbaI (CC)\ngenotype is associated with CAD patients in the Mexican\npopulation.21 Kallel et al. found a significant but not\nindependent association between the Ins/Del polymor-\nphism of the apoB gene and MI in the Tunisian popula-\ntion.31 Marshall et al. found no evidence that the apoB\nIns/Del polymorphism had a significant influence on the\nrisk of angiographically defined CAD.39 In contrast,\nHong et al. observed that the Ins allele frequency was\nsignificantly higher in patients than in healthy controls\nIn order to generate robust data on apoB gene (EcoRI,\nXbaI, and SpIns/Del) polymorphisms and CAD risk, we\ncarried out an update meta-analysis involving 54 studies\nand focusing on worldwide studies to provide the most\ncomprehensive analysis on the relationship between apoB\ngene polymorphisms and CAD risk. The effects of the\ndominant model, the recessive genetic model, and allelic\ncontrast were estimated.\nThis meta-analysis revealed that EcoRI and SpIns/Del\npolymorphisms of apoB gene significantly increased the\nsusceptibility for CHD. No significant statistical associa-\ntion was observed under XbaI polymorphism. The results\nwere the same as those of a previous meta-analysis per-\nformed by Chiodini et al. in 2003.2 Another meta-analysis\nwas performed by Boekholdt et al. in Caucasians.3 Subjects\nhomozygous for the rare EcoRI allele had significantly\ndecreased levels of total and LDL cholesterol, but unal-\ntered risk of CHD. Homozygotes for the XbaI C allele had\nsignificantly elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)\nand apoB, but a decreased risk of CHD. Homozygosity for\nthe SpIns/Del D allele was associated with similarly\nincreased levels of LDL-C and apoB, and with an increased\nrisk of CHD. In our meta-analysis, in Chinese individuals,\nthe XbaI polymorphism decreased the risk of CHD. The\nresults were in line with a meta-analysis carried out by\nChen et al. in 2006.4 As to SpIns/Del polymorphism, no\nsignificant statistical association was observed.\nHowever, only full text articles published in English\nand Chinese were included in this meta-analysis, miss-\ning some eligible studies which were unpublished or\nFigure 2.

In this case, some inevitable\npublication bias might exist, although the funnel plots\ndid not indicate obvious publication bias in the present\nmeta-analysis. It might influence the interpretation of\nour final results.\nFor better interpreting the results, some limitations of\nthis meta-analysis should be acknowledged. First, hetero-\ngeneity may affect the results of the present meta-analysis\nin our analysis. Second, subgroup analysis was not performed\nby the factors such as gender, age and experimental method\nbecause insufficient data could be extracted from the pri-\nmary article. Further studies with large sample size, espe-\ncially in subgroup analysis of different minority, were\nneeded to confirm our findings.\nDespite these limitations or disadvantages, our meta-\nanalysis still had some advantages. First, a systematic\nreview of the association of apoB gene (EcoRI, XbaI,\nand SpIns/Del) polymorphisms with CHD risk is\n834 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)\nstatistically more powerful than any single study.\nSecond, the studies retrieved were the latest; many of\nthem were published after the previous meta-analysis.\nThird, the quality of case\u00adcontrol studies included in\nour meta-analysis was satisfactory and met our inclu-\nsion criteria.\nConclusions\nIn summary, the present meta-analysis points to an asso-\nciation of EcoRI polymorphism with an increased risk of\nCHD. No significant association between apoB XbaI\npolymorphism and CHD we observed in all studies, but it\nis a reduced risk of CHD in Chinese people. For SpIns/\nDel polymorphism, an association was observed in all\nstudies. However, no significant statistical association\nwas found under Chinese individuals. On the other hand,\nHuang and Xie found that combined polymorphisms of\napoB and APOAI gene are related with CHD.28 Scartezini\net al. observed that individuals with the TT/GG genotype\npresented a 6.1 higher chance of developing CHD than\nindividuals with the other XbaI/EcoRI genotypes in\nBrazilian patients.52 We conclude that the TT/GG geno-\ntype may be in linkage disequilibrium with an unknown\nvariation in the apoB gene or with a variation in another\ngene that affects the risk of CHD. Larger scale primary\nstudies with the consideration of gene\u00adgene and gene\u00ad\nenvironment interactions are still required to further eval-\nuate the interaction of apoB gene polymorphisms with\nCHD susceptibility.\nFigure 4.
