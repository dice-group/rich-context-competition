These mechanisms often come in the form of cognitive biases.\nCognitive biases refer to particular patterns in perception, judgment, or decision making in\nwhich an error is predictably made. Cognitive biases have been understood as evolved\ninformation-processing mechanisms that are biased to err in a specific direction regardless\nof objective reality. Many of these cognitive biases can be understood using signal\nJudgments made under uncertainty are subject to two types of errors: false positives\n(Type I errors) and false negatives (Type II errors). False positives are judgments that are\nerroneously positive when a situation is normal in reality (i.e., null is true); false negatives\nare judgments that are erroneously negative when a situation is abnormal (i.e., null is false).\nIf an antivirus program erroneously designated an uninfected file as infected, it committed\nMen assume the worst\na false positive. If the program erroneously designated an infected file as uninfected, it\ncommitted a false negative.\nAs illustrated in this example, sometimes the costs of one error are greater than the\ncosts of the other. With regard to antivirus programs, false positives are minor annoyances\nwhile false negatives can be fatal to your operating system. Haselton and Buss (2000)\nrecognized that if, for a given adaptive problem, the costs of the errors were asymmetrical\nover evolutionary history, cognitive systems would evolve to make the less costly of the\ntwo errors. That is, cognitive systems will be designed to appropriately manage errors if\nthis proper management had fitness consequences. Below, we briefly review evidence\nregarding motion detection, distance perception, predator avoidance, and social perception\nthat empirically supports error management theory (see Haselton and Nettle, 2006 for a\nmore complete review of the applications of error management theory).\nIn a study on motion detection, male and female observers perceived male point-\nlight figures walking in place as approaching rather than leaving (Brooks et al., 2008;\nVanrie, Dekeyser, and Verfaillie, 2004). Brooks et al. speculated that this cognitive bias\noccurs because it might have been more costly to perceive an ambiguously oriented male\nfigure as leaving rather than as approaching.\nJackson and Cormack (2008) invoked error management theory to predict a\nperceptual bias associated with distance estimate. Because the costs associated with\nunderestimating vertical distance (i.e., heights) were greater than the costs associated with\noverestimating vertical distance, Jackson and Cormack (2008) hypothesized and found that\nobservers overestimated vertical distances and did so at a magnitude related to the vertical\ndistance (i.e., the greater the height, the greater the overestimation). Stimulus lengths\nmeasuring 14 meters long, for example, were perceived as 51% longer, on average.\nA study on predator avoidance has revealed that, under uncertainty, children\ninitially assume that a motionless animal is sleeping, instead of assuming it is dead (e.g.,\nBarrett and Behne, 2005), and this bias probably increases at a magnitude related to the\nanimal's dangerousness or size. \"Poking it with a stick\" is likely a universal phenomenon\ndriven by an evolved cognitive bias.\nResearch on social perception has also uncovered cognitive biases in men's and\nwomen's sexual psychology. Men, for example, reliably overperceive women's sexual\ninterest in them (e.g., inferring sexual interest from a friendly smile) as this bias was less\nreproductively costly throughout human evolutionary history than underperceiving sexual\ninterest and missing a sexual opportunity (Haselton, 2003; Haselton and Buss, 2000). For\nancestral women, however, underperceiving sexual interest was less costly, and\naccordingly, women do not seem biased to overperceive sexual interest. Overperceiving\nmen's commitment (e.g., inferring that commitment displays are genuine), however, would\nhave been costly for ancestral women. In line with error management theory, women\nunderperceive commitment in men (Haselton and Buss, 2000).\nThe Present Research\nDetecting a partner's sexual infidelity was another likely adaptive problem that\ninvolved uncertainty and an asymmetry in the costs of the errors. When perceiving a\npartner's infidelity, an individual can make two possible errors: he or she can suspect\nMen assume the worst\ninfidelity when none has occurred (false positive) or not suspect infidelity when it has\noccurred (false negative). Table 1 illustrates the possible conditions.\nTable 1. Infidelity perception contingency table\n_______________________________________________________________\nTarget's Perceptions\n_______________________________________\nPartner's Actions Suspect No Infidelity Suspect Infidelity\n___________________\nNo Infidelity Correct Inference False Positive\nInfidelity False Negative Correct Inference\n_______________________________________________________________\nFailing to detect a partner's sexual infidelity was costly for both ancestral men and\nwomen. Some of the costs of these false negatives would have included potential\nreputational damage, increased risk of contracting STIs, and possible relationship\ndissolution. Ancestral men, however, were susceptible to an additional and profound cost if\nthey failed to detect a partner's infidelity: cuckoldry--the unwitting investment of\nresources into genetically unrelated offspring. Cuckoldry was one of the most serious\nthreats to fitness our male ancestors faced. Some of the costs associated with cuckoldry\ninclude misdirection of the male's time, effort, and recourses to rearing a rival's offspring,\nloss of time, effort, and resources the man spent attracting his partner, and reputational\ndamage if such information becomes known to others. The sum of these costs provided\nselection pressure for the evolution of an arsenal of anti-cuckoldry tactics in men (e.g.,\nGoetz, Shackelford, Platek, Starratt, and McKibbin, 2008).\nBecause detecting sexual infidelity typically involves uncertainty and because the\ncosts associated with sexual infidelity were likely greater for men than for women, men's\ninfidelity detection system should be designed to overperceive the likelihood of their\npartner's infidelity (Buss, 2000; Haselton and Buss, 2000). That is, because false negatives\nwere more costly for men than for women, men should err on the side of caution and\ngenerate more false positives than women. This bias would lead to men being more\nsuspicious of their partner's future infidelity than women. We hypothesized that, compared\nto women, men would report greater suspicion of their partner's future sexual infidelities.\nWe tested this hypothesis using two different response formats, a Likert-type scale (Study\n1) and a visual analog scale (Study 2).\nStudy 1: Perceptions of Infidelity Using a Likert-type Scale\nThis study used a Likert-type scale to test the hypothesis that men will overperceive\nthe likelihood of their partner's infidelity more so than women. A 7-point scale was\nselected because of its common usage in the psychological literature. Also, data were\nMen assume the worst\ncollected online. In Study 2, we used a visual analog scale, and data were collected in a\nlaboratory setting.\nMethod\nParticipants\nOne-hundred forty-nine students (89 of them women) from a public university in\nSouthern California served as participants in this study. Participants were required to be in\na committed, heterosexual relationship and at least 18 years of age. The mean age of the\nMaterials\nParticipants completed a brief online questionnaire that included several sections.\nThe first section asked two questions to assess the participant's expected likelihood of\nfuture infidelity: (1) \"How likely do you think it is that you will in the future have sexual\nintercourse with someone other than your current partner?\" and (2) \"Please indicate your\nagreement or disagreement with the following statement: `I will probably be sexually\nunfaithful to my partner.'\" Responses were recorded using a 7-point Likert-type scale\nanchored by 1 (Not at all Likely / Completely Disagree) and 7 (Extremely Likely /\nCompletely Agree). The second section asked two questions to assess perceptions of their\ncurrent partner's future infidelity: (1) \"How likely do you think it is that your current\npartner will in the future have sexual intercourse with some one other than you, while in a\nrelationship with you?\" and (2) \"Please indicate your agreement or disagreement with the\nfollowing statement: `My partner will probably be sexually unfaithful to me in the future.'\"\nThe final section requested demographic information, including the participant's sex, age,\nsexual orientation, and length of relationship.\nProcedure\nParticipants were made aware of this online study through a research portal used by\nthe Department of Psychology at the first author's university. Prospective participants were\ninformed that the study was to be completed online and that their responses would remain\ncompletely anonymous. Participants were also informed that they were required to be in a\ncommitted, heterosexual relationship and at least 18 years of age. Participants read an\nimplied consent form and clicked a link to participate.\nResults and Discussion\nPrior to analyses, we created a composite variable for partner future infidelity ( =\n.96) by averaging responses to the two partner infidelity questions, and we created a\ncomposite variable for self future infidelity ( = .71) by averaging responses to the two self\ninfidelity questions.\nTo test our hypothesis that, compared to women, men would report greater\nMen assume the worst\nsuspicion of their partner's future sexual infidelities, we conducted an independent samples\nt test comparing men's perceptions of partner future infidelity with women's perceptions of\npartner future infidelity. As hypothesized, men were more likely than women to report\ngreater suspicion of their partner's future sexual infidelities, t (146) = 3.76, p < .001, d =\n.59. Figure 1 displays the means, error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Moreover,\n50% of men reported at least some suspicion of their partner's future infidelity, whereas\nonly 28% of women reported at least some suspicion of their partner's future infidelity, and\nInterestingly, men were more likely than women to report that they themselves\nratings of their likelihood of committing infidelity in the future were greater than women's\nratings. Although men (relative to women) perceived a higher likelihood of being sexually\nunfaithful in the future, men were still more suspicious of their partner's future infidelity\nthan were women.\nFigure 1.

The\ninclusion of the VAS and the independent reports from a different sample offered an\nadditional test of the hypothesis that men will be more suspicious of their partner's future\ninfidelity than women.\nMethod\nParticipants\nOne-hundred sixty-three students (101 of them women) from a public university in\nSouthern California served as participants in this study. Participants were required to be in\na committed, heterosexual relationship and at least 18 years of age. The mean age of the\n32.9) for women. None of the participants from Study 1 participated in Study 2, making the\ntwo studies independent.\nMaterials\nThe questions in Study 2 paralleled those used in Study 1. Participants reported\ntheir own expected likelihood of infidelity, their perceptions of their current partner's\nfuture infidelity, and their demographic information.\nOne important distinction between the studies is that in Study 2, responses were\nrecorded using a visual analog scale (VAS) measuring 112mm. A VAS is a rating scale that\nconsists of a single horizontal line with an anchor on each end (see Fig. 1) and is scored by\nmeasuring in millimeters the distance to the participant's mark.\nProcedure\nUpon the prospective participant's arrival at the scheduled time and location, the\nresearcher confirmed that the prospective participant was currently involved in a\ncommitted, sexual relationship and at least 18 years old. If the criteria were met, the\nresearcher handed the participant a consent form and the questionnaire. The first page of\nthe questionnaire included instructions on how to respond to a VAS (see Fig. 2).\nMen assume the worst\nFigure 2. Instructions given to participants for responding to a visual analog scale.\nThe participant was instructed to complete the questionnaire and place the\ncompleted questionnaire in a box to maintain anonymity. The researcher gave some privacy\nto the participant as he or she completed the questionnaire. Upon completion, the\nresearcher explained to the participant the purpose of the study, answered any questions,\nand thanked the participant for his or her participation.\nResults and Discussion\nPrior to analyses, two researchers measured with a ruler the participants' VAS\nresponses, and the interrater reliability for the measures was excellent ( = .98). As in\nStudy 1, we created a composite variable for partner future infidelity ( = .95) by averaging\nresponses to the two partner infidelity questions, and we created a composite variable for\nself future infidelity ( = .97) by averaging responses to the two self infidelity questions.\nTo test our hypothesis that men would be more likely than women to report that\ntheir partners would commit sexual infidelity in the future, we conducted an independent\nsamples t test comparing men's perceptions of partner future infidelity with women's\nperceptions of partner future infidelity. As hypothesized, men were more likely than\nwomen to report greater suspicion of their partner's future sexual infidelities [t (157) =\nintervals. Moreover, 74% of men reported at least some suspicion of their partner's future\ninfidelity, whereas 65% of women reported at least some suspicion of their partner's future\ninfidelity, although this difference failed to reach significance, 2 (1) = 1.45, p = .23.\nPlease mark a vertical line through the horizontal line to indicate your response.

Sex difference in perceptions of partner future infidelity.\nAlso paralleling Study 1, men were more likely than women to report that they\nThat is, men's ratings of their likelihood of committing infidelity in the future were greater\nthan women's ratings. Although men (relative to women) perceived a higher likelihood of\nbeing sexually unfaithful in the future, men were still more suspicious of their partner's\nfuture infidelity than were women.\nAs hypothesized, the results of Study 2 replicating those of Study 1: Men reported\ngreater suspicion of their partner's future sexual infidelity than did women. These results\nprovide tentative support for the hypothesis that men's infidelity detection system includes\npsychological mechanisms designed to overperceive the likelihood of their partner's\ninfidelity.\nGeneral Discussion\nGiven that failing to detect a partner's sexual infidelity places men (but not women)\nat risk of cuckoldry, men's infidelity detection system might be designed to overestimate\nthe likelihood of their partner's infidelity (Buss, 2000; Haselton and Buss, 2000). This bias,\nMen assume the worst\nwe predicted, would lead to men being more suspicious of their partner's future infidelity\nthan women. Using two independent samples, two different response formats, and two data\ncollection methods, we found support for our hypothesis. Men's perceptions of the\nlikelihood of their partner's future infidelities were greater than women's.\nOur results complement recent work on perceptions of infidelity. Andrews,\nGangestad, Miller, Haselton, and Neale. (2008) documented that men (compared to\nwomen) were more likely to generate false positives than false negatives when making\ninferences about their partner's past infidelities. These results are in line with ours but are\ndifferent in two important ways. First, while Andrews et al. examined perceptions of past\ninfidelity, our focus was on perceptions of future infidelity. Second, Andrews et al.'s\ninfidelity perception question was not specific to sexual infidelity. They asked participants,\n\"To your knowledge, has your partner ever had an affair behind your back?\" Participants in\ntheir study could have reported suspicions of their partner's emotional infidelity. For men,\nfailing to detect a partner's emotional infidelity is not as costly as failing to detect a\npartner's sexual infidelity. For this reason, we specifically assessed perceptions of sexual\ninfidelity.\nOur results also concur with recent work by Brand, Markey, Mills, and Hodges\n(2007). Using a relatively large sample, Brand et al. (2007) documented that men reported\nbeing more suspicious about their partner's infidelities than women (Study 1). Again, while\nthis finding is in line with ours, our studies depart from Brand and colleagues in two\nimportant ways. First, Brand et al. asked participants to report the number of episodes in\nwhich the partner was suspicious of the infidelity. That is, they secured from participants\nperceptions of their partner's suspicion of their own infidelity. This method has obvious\nlimitations as individuals can be unaware of their partner's suspicions. Second, like\nAndrews et al., Brand et al.'s definition of infidelity was not specific to sexual infidelity. In\ntheir study, they explicitly defined cheating as \"any form of romantic and/or sexual\ninvolvement, short or long-term, including kissing, while the individual is in a relationship\nwith someone else.\" Conflating sexual and emotional infidelity can produce null results\nbecause women might have benefited from overperceiving their partner's emotional\ninfidelities. Brand et al.'s second study supports this conjecture as those results indicated\nthat men were not significantly more suspicious of their partner's general infidelity than\nwomen. Examining sex differences in perceptions of emotional infidelity is a viable future\ndirection.\nThe current studies directly parallel empirical research demonstrating a sex\ndifference in sexual and emotional jealousy: Men (relative to women) experience more\njealousy and distress in response to the sexual aspects of an infidelity (e.g., Edlund and\nSagarin, 2009). This motivational system functioned to reduce a man's risk of being\nincludes mechanisms associated with the overperception of partner sexual infidelity\ndocumented in the current studies.\nAlthough we predicted and found that men were more suspicious of their partner's\nfuture sexual infidelity than women, we acknowledge that this overperception is likely to\nbe naturally constrained. An unchecked and unyielding suspicion of partner infidelity\nwould not have been adaptive as this gross overperception would have generated\nMen assume the worst\nunnecessary vigilance, mate guarding, intimate partner violence, and relationship\ndissolution (see, e.g., Easton, Schipper, and Shackelford, 2007). This design feature of\nmen's infidelity detection deserves attention in future work.\nOne limitation of the current research is methodological. Our studies relied on self-\nreport measures of perceptions of partner infidelity. Although we acknowledge that there\nare limitations to self-report measures, no other method exists for investigating perceptions\nof infidelity. Another limitation involves our design. We assessed perceptions of infidelity\nfrom independent samples of men and women. There are obvious advantages to assessing\nperceptions of infidelity within couples to examine whether there is a true mismatch\nbetween an individual's actual likelihood of infidelity and the partner's perceptions of\ninfidelity (e.g., Andrews et al., 2008).\nA clear future direction is to examine individual differences in perceptions of\ninfidelity. Men possessing purported markers of good genes, for example, might be at a\nreduced risk of cuckoldry (e.g., Gangestad, Thornhill, and Garver-Apgar, 2005), and thus,\ntheir estimates of their partner's future infidelity might reflect this. Just as men's height\nmoderates their jealousy (Buunk, Park, Zurriaga, Klavina, and Massar, 2008), men's sexual\nattractiveness, for example, might moderate their perceptions of their partner's infidelity. In\naddition, individual differences in men's experience with infidelity (e.g., as an extra-pair\npartner, a \"victim\" of infidelity, or \"perpetrator\" of infidelity) may predict individual\ndifferences in men's overestimation of infidelity.\nIn conclusion, we found support for the hypothesis that men's infidelity detection\nsystem should be designed to overestimate the likelihood of their partner's infidelity. Goetz\n(2007) hypothesized that men possess evolved psychological mechanisms dedicated to\ngenerating risk assessments of a partner's sexual infidelity, and that these mechanisms\nselectively process information associated with assessments of time spent apart from the\npartner, the presence of potential mate poachers, the partner's reproductive value and\nfertility, and the partner's personality characteristics. The current results suggest an\nadditional design feature to men's infidelity detection system: an overperception of future\nsexual infidelity.\n"
