Hepatitis C infection is associated with diabetes\nmellitus and insulin resistance and it is suggested that metabolic\nsyndrome is common in patients with hepatitis C. Microalbu-\nminuria is common in patients with diabetes and metabolic\nsyndrome; however, no studies have examined the relationship\nbetween microalbuminuria and hepatitis C infection.\nMethods. We conducted a nested case-control study to ex-\namine the relationship between nondiabetic subjects with hep-\natitis C infection and microalbuminuria by using the Third\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES\nIII) database. Study cohort consisted of 15,336 adults from the\nUnited States who had hepatitis C antibody measured as part of\nthe NHANES III. The prevalence of microalbuminuria and the\nmetabolic syndrome were compared between individuals with\npositive hepatitis C infection antibody (N = 362) and matched\ncontrols (N = 995). Additional analyses were conducted to de-\nfine the association between hepatitis C infection and microal-\nbuminuria.\nResults. Prevalence of microalbuminuria in patients with hep-\natitis C infection was 12.4% and it was significantly higher than\nin controls (7.5%) (P = 0.001). This difference persisted even af-\nter excluding diabetics from the analyses (11.4% vs. 6.7%) (P =\n0.001). However, there was no difference in the prevalence of\nthe metabolic syndrome between two groups (19% vs. 19%)\n(P = 0.9). After controlling for relevant covariates, hepatitis C\ninfection was independently associated with microalbuminuria\n(P = 0.008). Older age and African Americans were indepen-\ndently associated with microalbuminuria in nondiabetic hepati-\ntis C patients.\nConclusion. Hepatitis C infection is independently associ-\nated with microalbuminuria but not the metabolic syndrome.\nOlder age and African Americans are strongly associated\nwith microalbuminuria in nondiabetic hepatitis C subjects.\nMore research is needed to explore the implications of these\nobservations.\nKey words: microalbuminuria, metabolic syndrome, hepatitis C.\nC 2005 by the International Society of Nephrology\nChronic hepatitis C infection is associated with higher\nprevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus [1\u00ad8]. Stud-\nieshavealsoshownthatnondiabeticpatientswithchronic\nhepatitis C have higher prevalence of insulin resistance.\nBecause of the association between hepatitis C and di-\nabetes and insulin resistance, it is of interest to explore\nif individuals with hepatitis C have higher prevalence of\nthe metabolic syndrome. In one uncontrolled study, the\nprevalence of the metabolic syndrome in patients with\nhepatitis C was nearly 63% [9]. However, there are no\ncontrolled studies that systematically evaluated the asso-\nciation between hepatitis C and the metabolic syndrome.\nMicroalbuminuria is defined as subclinical urinary ex-\ncretion of albumin and it has been shown to predict the\nprogression of renal disease in patients with diabetes as\nwell as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the\ndiabetic and the general population [10\u00ad12]. It clusters\nwith the metabolic syndrome and studies have shown\na relationship between microalbuminuria and individual\ncomponents of the metabolic syndrome (hyperglycemia,\ninsulin resistance, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and\nhypertension) [10\u00ad15]. As patients with hepatitis C are\nknown to have higher prevalence of some components of\nthe metabolic syndrome, one could hypothesize that in-\ndividuals with hepatitis C may have higher prevalence of\nmicroalbuminuria.However,thishypothesishasnotbeen\nformally tested. Additionally, hepatitis C infection is also\ncommonly associated with chronic renal disease. This ex-\ntrahepatic manifestation is either related to intrinsic renal\ndisease or cryoglobulinemia. Because of the strong asso-\nciation between hepatitis C infection and chronic renal\ndisease, it would be of importance to explore if unselected\npatients with hepatitis C infection have higher prevalence\nof microalbuminuria.\nWe have conducted a nested case-control study by\nusing NHANES III (the Third National Health and\nNutrition Examination Survey) database to examine if\n(1) individuals with hepatitis C had higher prevalence\nof metabolic syndrome and microalbuminuria than the\nmatched controls, (2) hepatitis C was independently asso-\nciated with microalbuminuria in nondiabetic individuals,\n286 Liangpunsakul and Chalasani: Relationship between hepatitis C and microalbuminuria\nExclude subjects aged <20 yrs\nincomplete plasma glucose\nHepatitis C\nEligible to be\n(e.g., excessive alcohol,\nunexplained elevations in\nALT, HBV, etc.)\n(one subject with hepatitis C not included due to\nlack of matched controls)\nFig. 1.

The NHANES III used complex, multistage,\nstratified, clustered samples of civilian, noninstitutional-\nized populations with age 2 months and older to collect\ninformation about the health and diet of people resid-\ning in the United States. A detailed description of the\nsurvey and its sampling procedures are available on its\nWeb site (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/\nNHANESIII Reference Manuals.htm). This study was\napproved by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) In-\nstitutional Review Board and all participants provided\nwritten informed consent.\nStudy cohort and definitions\nDuring the survey period, 18,162 subjects underwent\nphysical examination and laboratory assessment at a\nmobile examination center. After excluding subjects\n<20 years old who lacked plasma glucose values (N =\nplasma glucose (N = 674) or urine albumin data (N =\nstudy cohort (Fig. 1).\nIndividuals with detectable antihepatitis C infec-\ntion antibody [by second generation enzyme-linked im-\nmunosorbent assay (ELISA)] in the absence of a positive\nhepatitis B surface antigen and serum transferrin satura-\ntion >50% were considered to have hepatitis C.

The\naverage alcohol consumption was calculated based on\ntheresponsestotwosurveyqueriesthatquestionedabout\nthe number of days of drinking over the past 12 months\nand the number of drinks per day on a given drinking\nday. The average alcohol consumption >one drink/day\nin women and >two drinks/day in men was considered as\nsignificant alcohol consumption [16].\nSubjects were considered to have diabetes mellitus if\ntheir fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dL or if they re-\nported ongoing usage of antidiabetic medications, either\noral hypoglycemic agents or insulin injection [17]. Sub-\njects were considered to have hypertension if their sys-\ntolic pressure 140 mm Hg or diastolic pressure 90 mm\nHg, as defined by the recent Joint National Committee\non Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of\nHigh Blood Pressure (JNC VII) guidelines, or if they re-\nportedcurrentusageofantihypertensivemedication,orif\nLiangpunsakul and Chalasani: Relationship between hepatitis C and microalbuminuria 287\nthey were told by their physicians of having hypertension\nThe presence of the metabolic syndrome was deter-\nmined based on the guidelines proposed by Third Report\nof the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult\nTreatment Panel (ATP III) [19].

All venous blood\nsamples were immediately centrifuged and shipped\nweekly at -20C to a central laboratory. Antibodies\nto hepatitis C infection were measured by a second-\ngeneration enzyme immunoassay (Abbott Laborato-\nries, Chicago, IL, USA). Serum transaminases were\ndetermined using the alpha-ketoglutarate reactions.\nBlood glucose was measured by modified hexokinase\nmethod. Cholesterol and triglycerides were measured\nquantitatively by a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction and\nHDL cholesterol was measured following the precipita-\ntion of the other lipoproteins (Boehringer Mannheim,\nIndianapolis, IN, USA). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)\ncholesterol was calculated by using the formula: LDL =\ntotal cholesterol - (triglyercide/5) - HDL. Serum crea-\ntinine level was measured by the modified Jaff\u00b4\ne reaction\n(Hitachi 737 analyzer; Boehringer Mannheim). Urinary\nalbumin was measured by a solid-phase fluorescent im-\nmunoassay.\nStatistical analysis\nQuality control procedures, database management,\nand statistical analyses were performed using SAS soft-\nware for Windows, version 8 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,\nUSA).

This difference in the prevalence\nof microalbuminuria persisted even after excluding sub-\njects with diabetes from the analyses (11.8% vs. 6.0%)\nDISCUSSION\nSeveral important findings have emerged from this\ncase-control study. First, we found that individuals with\nhepatitis C have significantly higher prevalence of mi-\ncroalbuminuriathanthematchedcontrolsafterexcluding\nsubjects with diabetes. Second, we found that hepati-\ntis C was independently associated with microalbumin-\nuria. Third, the association between hepatitis C and\nmicroalbuminuria was independent of diabetes, insulin\nresistance, or the metabolic syndrome. Finally, we failed\nto find an association between hepatitis C and the\nmetabolic syndrome.\nOurfindingthathepatitisCisindependentlyassociated\nwith microalbuminuria is novel and may have important\nclinical implications. In general, microalbuminuria is con-\nsidered to be a predictor of progressive renal disease and\ncardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetics and\ngeneral population. It is clearly established that hepatitis\nC infection is associated with renal disease [24]. Hepati-\ntis C is not only associated with membranoproliferative\nglomerulonephritis (related or unrelated to cryoglobu-\nlinemia) [24\u00ad27], but studies have also demonstrated that\nsubjects with hepatitis C increase the risk of protein-\nuria following liver or kidney transplantation [28\u00ad30].\nRecently, Ishizaka et al [31] suggested that hepatitis C\ninfection is associated with atherosclerosis. In this study\nconsisting of 4784 individuals from Japan, authors have\nshown an association between hepatitis C seropositivity\nand carotid atherosclerosis that was independent of tradi-\ntional risk factors for atherosclerosis. However, we would\nlike to point out that our patients with hepatitis C had sig-\nnificantly more favorable lipid profile (lower LDL and\nhigher HDL) than the controls. More research is needed\nto confirm if individuals with hepatitis C have increased\natherosclerosis and if microalbuminuria can predict renal\ndisease and/or atherosclerosis in individuals with chronic\nhepatitis C.\nOur study has several limitations that deserve further\ndiscussion. First, we defined the presence of microal-\nbuminuria based on a single measurement of urinary\nalbumin, rather than multiple measurements as recom-\nmended by the American Diabetes Association. Al-\nthough it would be ideal to define microalbuminuria\nbased on multiple urine collections, unfortunately the\nNHANES III was a cross-sectional study, and as such\nit lacked sequentially collected urine samples. There is\nprecedent in the literature that examined the associa-\ntion between metabolic syndrome and microalbumin-\nuria using the NHANES III database [32]. Second, as\nliver histology data were not available, we could not as-\nsess the relationship between the severity of liver dam-\nage and the prevalence of microalbuminuria. Third, our\nobservations are descriptive in nature and do not offer\nmechanistic clues to why patients with hepatitis C infec-\ntion have higher prevalence of microalbuminuria. The\nNHANES III did not measure cryoglobulin levels and it\nalso lacked adequate data on the rheumatoid factor mea-\nsurements. Finally, because of the cross-sectional nature\nof the survey, temporal relationships between hepatitis C\nand microalbuminuria could not be established. Despite\nall these limitations, we believe that our study makes sev-\neral important and hypotheses-generating observations.\nCONCLUSION\nHepatitis C is an independent predictor of microal-\nbuminuria in subjects without diabetes. The prevalence\nof the metabolic syndrome in patients with hepatitis C\nis not significantly different than the matched controls.\nOlder age and African Americans are strongly associ-\nated with microalbuminuria in nondiabetic hepatitis C\nsubjects. More research is needed to confirm these find-\nings and to examine their implications.\n290 Liangpunsakul and Chalasani: Relationship between hepatitis C and microalbuminuria\n"
